Savchenko made a career as a political officer in the Red Army during World War II. A prot√©g√© of Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev, Savchenko transferred to the Ministry of State Security (the predecessor to the KGB) in 1951.De Leeuw, Bergstra, p. 506. In 1952 he was promoted to the chief of the Special Services Department (GUSS, a cryptanalysis and information security branch of the Central Committee), in 1953 to the Chief of the KGB's Eighth Chief Directorate. His record at the national Party and KGB levels was lackluster, and 1959 he was transferred from Moscow to Chi≈üinƒÉu as the head of the Moldavian SSR KGB. In 1967‚Äì1979 Savchenko represented the KGB in Romania and Bulgaria.  Service in Moscow  In June 1951 Savchenko, who already earned special operations experience in the fight against Ukrainian nationalists, held an insignificant bureaucratic appointment in the national offices of the Central Committee in Moscow. In July 1951, after the fall of State Security chief Victor Abakumov, colonel Savchenko was hastily recruited to the Ministry of State Security (MGB).Kolpakidi, Seriakov p. 460. Savchenko temporarily held the post of the Deputy Chairman of the MGB, but apparently had not done anything notable in this office.Kolpakidi, Seriakov p. 461. One year later he was transferred back to the Central Committee, and appointed chief of its Special Services Department (GUSS), a SIGINT and cryptanalysis service. GUSS was created in 1942 by (then) major Ivan Shevelev. In 1949 the service was transferred from the NKVD control under direct management of the Central Committee. Shevelev, otherwise a capable SIGINT officer, was not able to overcome the shortage of qualified staff and the departmental rivalry with the stronger GRU force. In June 1952 Shevelev, now a Lieutenant General, was replaced by Savchenko.Kolpakidi, Seriakov p. 479. After the death of Joseph Stalin GUSS was reincorporated into the KGB as its Eighth Directorate, with Savchenko in command. Savchenko, a career apparatchik without technical or intelligence background, \\"proved to be a major disappointment given his lack of understanding of the technical aspects ... and his well-advertised ambition to get promoted out of GUSS.\\"  Service in Moldova  In 1959 Savchenko was transferred to Moldova and appointed chief of the State Committee of Security of Moldavian SSR. He assumed control over Moldovan KGB at the time when its rights were limited and duties extended. The border guard troops, reporting to KGB general Iosif Mordovets, once subordinated to the Moldovan KGB, now reported directly to Moscow. Savchenko, a Party apparatchik tasked with increasing the Party influence in the KGB, established himself as a capable executive with good interpersonal communication skills. He refused to recruit anyone with less than a university degree, and willfully recruited Moldovan nationals. His rule in Moldova was marked by the food crisis of the 1960s and its consequence, the rise in black market trading which the KGB was never able to control. In line with Khrushchev's anti-religious campaign, Moldovan KGB actively repressed the church. Many churches and monasteries were closed, the remaining ones infiltrated by the KGB agents and directly regulated from the KGB offices. As the number of foreign tourists increased, Savchenko had to focus on this threat too. The Council of Ministers, concerned about foreign infiltration, installed tight controls over the contacts between foreigners and locals, particularly scientists and academic. Savchenko's influence was gradually diluted since 1962, with the rise of Yuri Andropov, an enemy of Khrushchev. In the late 1960s Major General Savchenko was relieved from his Moldovan appointment and transferred to less important foreign service in the Soviet bloc. He died in Moscow at the age of 92.

The trophy is currently presented in five official categories: *Global Operations *Intercontinental Ballistic Missile *Strategic Aircraft Operations *Strategic Bomber Operations *Submarine Ballistic Missile Selection for the award in each of the categories is based on formal evaluations, meritorious achievement, safety, and other factors, such as community involvement and humanitarian actions. History The Omaha Trophy was created by the Strategic Command Consultation Committee, located in Omaha, Nebraska. The trophy was originally presented as a single trophy to a unit of the U.S. Air Force's Strategic Air Command (SAC) on behalf of the citizens of Omaha. The committee requested the trophy be presented annually to the command's best wing as a token of recognition and appreciation. It was first presented in 1971, with the number of awards increasing over the years as the U.S. Strategic Command's mission and structure changed. After the inactivation of Strategic Air Command and the creation of U.S. Strategic Command in 1992, the committee authorized two awards. One was for the best ICBM or fleet ballistic missile submarine unit, and the other was for the unified command's best strategic aviation unit. In 1998, the missile category was divided into two separate awards, with one to be presented to land-based units, and the other to sea-based missile units. In 2003, a fourth category was added. This new category was strategic space and information operations, which was used until 2006. It became the cyberspace category in 2007, and global operations in 2008. The current award of the Omaha Trophy reflects the command's primary missions, emphasis on strategic deterrence, and evolving role in global operations. The trophy rotates between installations annually. Officials present a miniature, replica trophy or plaque and certificate to each winning unit after the presentation trophy has been returned at the beginning of the next competitive cycle.

The complete title was Temple Bar ‚Äì A London Magazine for Town and Country Readers. It was initially edited by George Augustus Sala, and Arthur Ransome was the final editor before it folded, while he developed his literary career. It was also edited by Mary Elizabeth Braddon. History Temple Bar was founded a year after the first publication of William Thackeray's The Cornhill Magazine, by one of Charles Dickens' followers, Sala, who promised his readers that the periodical would be \\"full of solid yet entertaining matter, that shall be interesting to Englishmen and Englishwomen‚Ä¶and that Filia-familias may read with as much gratification as Pater or Mater-familias\\", appealing to a solid, literate middle-class. A rather congratulary review of the arrival of the impending publication appeared in the New York Times in October 1860 saying that it promised \\"The name is a happy one; pregnant with good things and seasoned with the promise of Attic salt\\". It sold for about one shilling, and was one of the leading literary magazines of the era. 553 issues were published ‚Äì up to 1906, about one a month. It published work by writers such as Amy Levy, Jane Austen, Wilkie Collins, Charles Reade, Robert Louis Stevenson, Anthony Trollope, Arthur Conan Doyle, E. F. Benson and Jessie Fothergill. Initially the magazine achieved a circulation of some 30,000 which eventually settled at around the 13,000 mark in the late 1860s. In 1868 Bentley's Magazine was merged into it.

Introduced in mid-1970, it was based on its immediate predecessor, the QT-8D introduced in late 1969, but it replaced the QT-8D's integrated power supply with a rechargeable battery pack. It has the same calculating integrated circuits as the QT-8D and is of similar appearance and dimensions; the power supply is the only major difference. The QT-8B's release price in Japan was 117,000 yen. The U.S. price in mid-1971 was $495, equivalent to about $2,700 in 2010. These prices were somewhat higher than those for the preceding QT-8D. The QT-8B's battery pack contains six nickel-cadmium C batteries connected in series, giving a total voltage of 7.5 volts and, with the original batteries, a total capacity of 1200 milliampere-hours. (Modern nickel-cadmium C batteries have much greater capacity.) For recharging, the calculator accepts 12-volt DC external power, with an input power rating of 6.5 watts. Normally the calculator is recharged from AC power by plugging it into an external charging station (model QTA-2) which is a little longer than the calculator and has a plug that fits into the calculator's charging socket. The calculator sits on top of the base of this charging station and can be used while charging; it can also be locked into the station for extra stability. An adapter for using 12-volt DC automobile power was also available. There is a slight difference between the QT-8D and the QT-8B in the operation of the right-hand display tube, which contains both a minus-sign indicator and a large dot. On the QT-8D, this dot is used as an overflow error indicator. But on the QT-8B, it acts as a low-battery indicator; overflow errors are signalled by displaying all zeroes with all the decimal point indicators lit. Sharp made an OEM version of the QT-8B for Burroughs, the Burroughs C3146, which has some significant differences from Sharp's own version. The QT-8B needs an external station for recharging its batteries and for AC operation, but the C3146 has its AC power supply built in, along with the batteries and charging electronics, and can thus be plugged directly into AC power. Since the C3146 has both a battery pack and an AC power supply, it also has a larger case to accommodate them. Like the Sharp, the Burroughs machine can also use 12-volt DC automobile power via an adapter. Otherwise, the C3146's electronics are identical to those of the QT-8B.

Founded in 1995, it is organised as a GmbH wholly owned by the Bavarian Government. The company does not provide any services or own tracks or rolling stock. Instead, it purchases services from railway companies that actually operate the trains.  History  In 1995, when the Act on the Regionalisation of Public Local Passenger Transport (Gesetz zur Regionalisierung des √∂ffentlichen Personennahverkehrs) transferred the responsibility for local passenger transport from the federal government to the L√§nder, the Bavarian Ministry of Economy, Infrastructure, Traffic and Technology founded the Bayerische Eisenbahngesellschaft to organise the local passenger rail transport in Bavaria. Owing to the market situation at that time, in 1996 it awarded the contract for most of the network to Deutsche Bahn, the national rail company owned by the federal government, without public tender. The first contract put out for public tendering in 1998 was the operation of the railway lines between Munich and the Bavarian Oberland and was eventually awarded to Bayerische Oberlandbahn, a newly founded subsidiary of Connex (now Transdev GmbH). However, improvements planned for the service were hampered by technical difficulties caused by the Integral trains, which were a completely new model that had not been used before. Since 2003, more and more railway services have been converted to contracts awarded on the basis of competitive tendering, which contracts awarded to Regentalbahn, DB Regio, Transdev GmbH, BeNEX and others.

It is located at 79 Tithebarn Street and serves LJMU's City Campus, located mostly on Byrom Street. The award-winning Tithebarn building was designed by the architect firm Austin-Smith:Lord, and was built in 1997 (who also designed the Aldham Robarts Library). It is additionally well-known for being the current home of the Superlambanana, located in front of its main entrance. The building is alternatively known locally by students as, the Tithebarn (after the building) or (Super)lambanana building (after the statue in front). The Avril Robarts Library has a gross floor area of , which makes it the largest of the three university libraries, the other two being; the Aldham Robarts Library, and the IM Marsh Library. The four-storey building contains 308 personal computers alongside countless books and online catalogues that cater mainly to the students of the Faculties of Science, Engineering and Technology and Education, Health and Community. Wi-Fi is available throughout the complex, which can be entered by scanning a relevant student ID card by the ground floor turnstiles. Other services available in the Library include research and learner support, IT Support, Skills@LJMU, welfare and counselling and employability advice. The Avril Robarts LRC is open 24/7 during term time to student card holders, albeit some services are restricted. It is a member of the Libraries Together: Liverpool Learning Partnership (evolved from Liverpool Libraries Group) which formed in 1990. Under which, a registered reader at any of the member libraries can have access rights to the other libraries within the partnership.  History  In the 1990s, LJMU embarked on an initiative of improving the study spaces and libraries for its students. The first library constructed through this initiative was the Aldham Robarts Library, located on Maryland Street, serving LJMU's Mount Pleasant Campus. The library was described to be a great success for the university and its students, leading to the decision to construct another LRC near LJMU's City Campus, with the initial proposal made in early 1992, and after governors considered the financing of the project, the LRC's relationship with the capital development programme, and the estates strategy, the proposal was clarified in the Strategic Plan 1992‚Äê1996 (Liverpool John Moores University, 1993). = Planning =  Existing libraries  The, then Avril Robarts Learning Resource Centre was intended to replace two existing LJMU libraries in the area, which were deemed too close to teaching areas. The Humanities Library, covering , served the Division of Education, Health and Social Sciences. The library only contained 16 PCs for student use within the library itself, with additional 106 PCs located in the computer rooms on the floor below. This limited capacity, followed by a growth in LJMU's student numbers, put increased pressure on the library, leading into a search for possible solutions, which ultimately was decided to be a new library. The other LRC, Avril Robarts replaced, was the engineering and science \\"library\\", containing 110 PCs in a mix of two teaching rooms and an open space area. It occupied the second and third floors of the James Parsons Building, on Byrom Street.  Alternatives considered  Earlier proposals for constructing a new LRC included a building alongside a Technology Transfer Centre (TTC), the latter was later built as the Peter Jost Enterprise Centre, on Byrom Street. With Austin‚ÄêSmith: Lord being the building's architect. However, the LRC aspect in a building on Byrom Street failed to materialize. Another site considered was the area adjacent to Trueman Street, near the Henry Cotton Building, but space in these sites at the time was either unavailable or too expensive.  Tithebarn Street  After the other proposals were discarded, the idea of developing the LRC adjacent to the former College of Commerce, located between Tithebarn Street and Smithfield Street, which had been part of the original polytechnic in 1970, had been put forward. The nearby car park, located next to the building, on the intersection of Tithebarn Street, and Vauxhall Road, was considered. The site provided a reasonable area, the original proposals asked for 7,400m2 of space, however, to reduce costs, a 5,500m2 site was ultimately decided, with the university retaining the use of computing suites on the Trueman Street site, and the second floor of the James Parsons Building, to make up for the smaller LRC. Concerns following the decision were expressed, most notably the distance of the LRC from Byrom Street, with the distance being a 10-minute walk from first floor to first floor. Although these issues can be minimised in multiple ways, such as block timetabling, which gave students the possibility of having complete half days free, allowing students the use of the LRC without impacting their timetable or study time. This would lead to the LRC being used for more long-stay purposes, rather than a short stay to return materials or check references, a student would stay longer in the centre to make better use of the facility, leading to longer stay study becoming the norm. According to Revill, the attraction of a new building, hosting a larger capacity of 200 PCs, meant that the usage of the centre would be equal to the two libraries it replaces, with the usage of the centre expected to increase to about double a year after opening. To improve connectivity between the LRC and Byrom Street, initiatives to install improved pedestrian crossings along the A59 Byrom Street dual-carriageway were followed through. Further proposals including the creation of a university square in front of the LRC, at the intersections of Tithebarn St, Vauxhall Rd, Hatton Garden and Great Crosshall St, a student dubbing as a \\"Harvard Square\\", were not followed through. = Development = The architects Austin‚ÄêSmith: Lord, the mechanical and electrical consultants Ernest Griffith and Son, and quantity surveyor Gleeds, and structural engineers and planning supervisors Wright Mottershaw, were appointed for the project. A small design team was then later established, with the team visiting many other institutions at the time including: Thames Valley University, Anglian Polytechnic University, University of North London, Edge Hill College of Higher Education, and the Aytoun Library of Manchester Metropolitan University. The total budget for the project was set to ¬£8,700,000 including, construction, professional fees, and acquisition of the site. Construction was under a management contract with John Mowlem Construction plc. Wright Mottershaw were the planning supervisors for the project under the construction (design and management) regulations. The client for the contract was JMU Learning Resource Development Ltd.  Naming  The building is named after Avril Robarts, the wife of Aldham Robarts, a businessman and the benefactor for the first LRC, who has made a significant contribution towards the costs of the second LRC. Local students commonly refer to the library by other unofficial names, such as the Tithebarn building (or simply Tithebarn), or the (Super)lambanana building. = Refurbishment = Completing in 2020, the Avril Robarts Library underwent a complete refurbishment, with the 2nd & 3rd floors refurbished first, opening in early 2020, and the remaining ground & 1st floor reopening in October 2020. The project consisted of the refurbishment and alteration of the university facilities in the building to provide internet caf√© facilities, offices, reception and meeting areas. The construction and development of the refurbishment was conducted by Whitfield Brown Ltd and Willmott Dixon Construction, and the architect for the project was Weightman & Bullen. The project's value was ¬£310,000, over a 33 week contract period. The works aim to make the Avril Robarts Library, a modern environment for online, physical, and digital resources, host new study and social spaces and contain more visible spaces for key student support teams. The refurbishment is being carried out in three phases with overall completion in late 2020. The library refurbishment is part of the wider Tithebarn Building project by LJMU, which will also see the extension and enhancement of the nearby School of Nursing and Allied Health in an extension of the Tithebarn Building. The refurbishment and wider Tithebarn Building project is part of LJMU‚Äôs estates masterplan, which involves the construction of a new Student Life Building and Sports Building on Copperas Hill, a new Pavilion at Aldham Robarts Library and a new School of Education building on Maryland Street. The latter two within the existing Mount Pleasant Campus, the Copperas Hill is located adjacent to Mount Pleasant and Liverpool Lime Street Station.  Building  The Avril Robarts Library is housed within the Tithebarn Building. The building is curved with a 72-metre radius, covered with a long brick and glass facade, which rounds the curve from Tithebarn Street to Vauxhall Road. The curved structure is made of a steel frame on piled foundations. The large amount of windows aim to lighten the internal space of the building providing a calm environment for students, ideal for learning and studying. The building also hosts the university's School of Health, a 200‚Äêseat Stanton Fuller lecture theatre, and a cafe.  General information  = Location = Avril Robarts Library is located at 79, Tithebarn Street in Liverpool, England, United Kingdom, L2 2ER.

It was intended to be a heavy load lifter, initially aimed at the Canadian logging industry. A proof of concept vehicle flew at times during the 1980s, but no large production aircraft were built. Design and development AeroLift Inc was set up in 1980 by CycloCrane inventor Arthur Crimmins, with funding from five major Canadian logging companies, with the objective of building a hybrid airship capable of conducting aerial logging at remote sites inaccessible by conventional means. The CycloCrane was a most unusual aircraft, utterly unique in its method of three-dimensional drive and attitude control. Arthur Crimmins during Cyclocrane flight tests in 1984 Two proof of concept versions were built, identical in size and varying in some details. Each had a fabric, oblate spheroid gas bag, or aerostat, to provide aerostatic lift sufficient to support the aircraft and fifty percent of the payload. Airfoils attached to the structure generated forces used to control the airship and to lift the other half of the load. The aerostat contained a rigid internal axle along its long axis. Halfway along the axle, two long beams were fixed at right angles to it and to each other, passing through the aerostat (envelope) where they carried four wings of symmetric airfoil section, or blades as AeroLift termed them. Each blade carried at its tip another, shorter wing mounted with its long axis perpendicular to the plane of the blade, making a T shape. Aerolift termed the blade and wing assembly a \\"stalk\\". The stalks could be rotated from their orientation in hover (wherein the blade surfaces were perpendicular to the long axis of the airship and the eventual direction of flight) toward the direction of flight. At the end of the blades, above the wing, were pylons that carried propeller driving engines, oriented at right angles to both wing and blade long axes, so they powered the aircraft forward in normal flight. A \\"hybrid airship\\" is defined as an airship that employs two forms of lift; aerostatic and aerodynamic, or buoyancy from gas that is lighter than air and lift from aerodynamic surfaces like wings and rotors. In the Cyclocrane the lighter than air gas, which was either helium or a helium and hydrogen mixture, carried the weight of the aircraft, including fluids and crew, and half the payload. The wings on the ends of the blades generated the lift needed to either carry the rest of the payload or to hold the airship down if it was unloaded. In a two- ton slingload Cyclocrane, for example, (which was the nominal size of the proof of concept models) the lifting gas would lift the weight of the vehicle, fluids and crew and one ton of payload. The wings would produce one ton of force to either lift one ton of payload or to hold the ship down against one ton of buoyancy when the payload was released. Flights began with the airship either attached to the slingload, or tethered, and allowed to rise until the net buoyancy is transferred to the tether or the load. The \\"stalk\\" (the assembly the engine is mounted on) that is hanging beneath the aerostat (the gas bag) is pointed forward and the engine started. The other three stalks are oriented with their blades, wings and engine centerlines perpendicular to the long axis of the airship. Once the lower engine is warmed up and running at full power that stalk is quickly rotated ninety degrees. As soon as the stalk begins to point forward the thrust generated by that engine starts the airship center body into rotation. After a revolution or two the other engine (or engines) are started. When the rate of rotation (in the two ton slingload Cyclocrane) reaches thirteen revolutions per minute the relative wind over the wings, is sixty-miles-per-hour. That airspeed is sufficient to create the lift needed to lift one ton, if the airship is loaded, or to hold the ship down against one ton of buoyancy if it isn't. To fly to his destination the pilot executes a cyclic command to the wings that causes them to change their orientation through each revolution to either lift the load or counteract the aerostatic lift. Once hovering at the desired altitude a collective command is issued by the pilot to the blades, rotating them toward the direction of flight, causing them to function as propeller blades and pulling the airship forward (or backward). This forward velocity component allows for a reduction in the rate of rotation to maintain the necessary sixty-mile-per-hour relative wind over the wings. The result of this mixing of velocity components means that the path that the wings trace through the air as the ship reaches full forward flight is a helix, the rotation rate decreases as the horizontal speed increases and at full forward flight the ship is no longer rotating. Cyclocrane flight test ‚Äì 1984 ‚Äì Pilot Colonel JJ Morris, Flight Engineers Bill Giordano and Arthur Crimmins To come to a stop so the load can be released or to moor the airship the process is reversed. The stalks are gradually rotated in the opposite direction causing them to act as a propeller again to take the ship back into rotation and hover. The load is then released and the ship can return for another load or if the ship is to be moored it can be secured to a tether or mast. Both versions of the CycloCrane were 178 ft (54.25 m) long. The first version, completed in 1982 had four piston engines and was fitted with a large, inverted Y shaped tail needed to stabilise it at its moorings by keeping it pointed into wind. That version was destroyed at its moorings in a storm and was never flown. It was rebuilt by 1984 and fitted with an 18 faceted, ring shaped tail wire braced to the central axis. The aerostats in both versions were 68 ft 0 in (20.73 m) in diameter and 136 ft 0 in (41.45 m) long and manufactured by ILC Dover of Frederica, Delaware, USA. Partly to save weight, this version had only two engines, a pair of 150 hp (112 kW) Textron Lycoming AEIO-320 horizontally opposed piston engines driving 4-bladed propellers. This left the CycloCrane rather underpowered, particularly in lift. Cyclocrane Internal components including the longitudinal structure and two of four stalk support struts The revised CycloCrane began unmanned flights in August 1984 and made its first manned flight on October 15, 1984 with Colonel JJ Morris as the pilot, Robert Crimmins as co-pilot, Bill Giordano as the flight engineer and Arthur Crimmins as flight engineer and commander. The first untethered flight was made eight days later. By mid-1985 it had accumulated 7 hrs of flight under a US Forest Service contract, but the lack of power limited the spin rate to 10 rpm, rather than the designed 13 rpm so that the aircraft was less nimble in its movements than intended and also only able to lift loads of about half of the target 2 tons. AeroLift received several military contracts in the late 1980s to keep the CycoCrane idea afloat, particularly one from DARPA in 1988 for mooring investigations on a 36 ft model and renewal of the proof of concept aircraft for military suitability tests. For its final flights the tail was altered again into a combination of the early inverted Y within the ring of the first rebuild. When the defense funding ended in 1990, the company ceased to trade.

Probably Herod's most magnificent secular construction, the three-aisled structure was described by Josephus as deserving \\"to be mentioned better than any other under the sun.\\" A center of public and commercial activity, the Royal Stoa was the likely location of Jesus' Cleansing of the Temple. The Royal Stoa overlooked Jerusalem's residential and commercial quarters, and at its southwestern corner was the place from which a ram's horn was blown to announce the start of holy days. The Royal Stoa was destroyed by the Roman army during the sack of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Its site on the Temple Mount esplanade is currently inaccessible to archaeologists. However, artifacts from the Stoa have been recovered both from excavations at the foot of the platform and in secondary use in later constructions. This evidence has confirmed details given in the accounts of the historian Josephus, and has also allowed comparison of the Royal Stoa's decoration with that used in other, contemporaneous monumental buildings. History =Construction= Herod's reconstruction of the Second Temple was one of his principal building projects. Construction began during the last quarter of the 1st century BCE. It was both a monumental architectural feat and an important political achievement. Herod invested a great deal of effort in the expansion of the Temple platform, especially at its southern side where the Temple Mount descends into the Tyropoeon and Kidron valleys. This expansion along the southern edge of the esplanade served as a base upon which the Royal Stoa was erected. The building was basilical in form, but open on one side, which led it to being described as a portico, a stoa or cloisters in various sources. It was likely Herod's most magnificent secular edifice. The historian Josephus praised the Royal Stoa as \\"more worthy of mention than any other [structure] under the sun\\", and described the building in detail: Model of the Herodian Temple Mount: Temple (center), Royal Stoa (left), and Antonia Fortress (right) A basilica with four rows of columns running lengthwise, each made of 40 columns, the Royal Stoa thus contained three parallel halls, with a central wide hall and two flanking wide halls. Each column was approximately in diameter and, according to Josephus, tall, though classical proportions would have had it at roughly . The central hall was twice as tall as the aisles, probably nearly tall. Israeli archaeologist Ehud Netzer estimates the Royal Stoa was roughly wide and long, though Josephus gives its length as a stade (approximately 600 ft). The central aisle had a higher ceiling than the side-aisles. Light was provided by clerestory windows in the upper part of the central hall. It is also possible that an apse stood at the eastern wall of the Stoa. Josephus describes the columns as Corinthian in style and Corinthian capitals have indeed been found in excavations along the mount's southern wall, as well as reused in later Roman, Byzantine and Islamic structures. The ceilings were ornamented with deeply cut wood-carvings while other parts of the interior were apparently covered with stucco. The southernmost row of columns was incorporated into the southern wall of the Temple mount, while the northern side opened onto the plaza in the middle of which stood the Temple. From the outside, the southern wall was distinguished from the retaining wall of the platform by a series of pilasters running along the length of the superstructure. The main entry to the Stoa from the city was via a monumental staircase which led up from the Tyropoeon Valley and then across Robinson's Arch, passing over the street and shops below. The Royal Stoa was built upon the artificially raised portion of the Temple Mount platform. Arches underneath supported the columns of the Stoa, and provided service areas for the structures above. The Huldah Gates at the bottom of the southern wall led through corridors beneath the Stoa, rising to the Temple plaza, and served as the main entrance to the Temple compound for worshipers. Additional passages led to storage areas, and possibly provided secondary access to the Stoa and the Temple beyond. An arched overpass on the eastern side of the Temple Mount led to a gate which opened into the so-called Solomon's Stables just beneath the eastern end of the Stoa. It is widely assumed that at least part of this area was used as a storage area in conjunction with business conducted in the Stoa. The expansion of the Temple Mount platform and the erection of the Royal Stoa required Herod's engineers to overcome the difficult topographic conditions. It was thus necessary to build tall foundations above the slope of the Tyropoeon valley and equivalent tall foundations above the Kidron. The great effort invested in the construction of the Royal Stoa is a testimony of its immense importance to Herod and his status on the Temple Mount. Unlike his predecessors, the Hasmonean kings who had also served as High Priests, Herod was not of the priestly caste and was therefore unable to participate in priestly rituals. A client king appointed by the Romans, lacking legitimacy and unpopular with his subjects, Herod had initiated the Temple reconstruction to win favour among the Jews, but was forbidden from even entering the inner sanctum of his crowning achievement. It was thus the monumental Royal Stoa which gave Herod his rightful status on the Mount, a showcase of his majesty and grandeur. =Purpose= Silver shekel minted during the Great Revolt. The archaizing, paleo-Hebrew inscription reads: \\"Shekel of Israel\\" \\"Year 3\\" (obverse); \\"Jerusalem the Holy\\" (reverse) Every major Roman city had a basilica which was used for banking, law courts, and other commercial transactions. In Jerusalem, the Royal Stoa was the center of this activity. In the forty years prior to the Great Revolt it served as the seat of the Sanhedrin, Judaism's supreme judicial court, which was moved from the Chamber of Stone to the \\"Shop\\" (Chanuyot in the Talmud), referring to the commercial activities conducted in the Stoa. A fragment of a monumental inscription found near the eastern Huldah gates below the Stoa refers to the Zeqenim (elders) and may indicate the Sanhedrin's meeting place near the gates or in the Stoa above. This center of commercial activity within sight of the Temple was considered irreverent to many devout Jews. It was also a site of commerce related to the Temple ritual, where sacrificial doves could be bought and coins bearing prohibited images could be exchanged. It is therefore a likely location for Jesus' confrontation with the dove sellers and money changers which is related in chapter 21 of the Gospel of Matthew. Special coinage was used for sacred contributions and other purposes. The Israel Antiquities Authority's numismatist Donald T. Ariel has proposed that the Royal Stoa as the site for a mint, run by the priesthood. During the Great Revolt against Rome, this may have been the site where silver shekels were produced. The stoa's convenient proximity to the Temple's silver stores and the area's use for other commercial purposes argue for identification of the stoa as the location of minting operations. Other \\"Revolt\\" coinage was in base metal, and these may have been struck elsewhere in Jerusalem. Above the basilica, either on a parapet or tower, was a place from which a trumpet or ram's horn would be blown to signal the start of the Sabbath and holy days. On the pavement below the southwest corner of the Royal Stoa complex, a piece of stone coping was excavated which bears a dedicatory inscription which reads \\"to the Place of Trumpeting\\". This location overlooked most of Jerusalem's neighborhoods, and the recovery of the inscription confirms that the southwest corner is the site where the trumpeting took place. =Destruction= The Great Revolt and the subsequent sacking of Jerusalem in 70 CE brought about the destruction of Herod's Temple, including the Royal Stoa, by members of the Roman X Fretensis, XII Fulminata, XV Apollinaris and V Macedonica legions under the command of emperor Vespasian's son Titus. It is likely that the stoa was modified during the initial phases of the revolt when the Temple Mount was fortified, first by Simon Bar Giora and then by John of Gischala. The main entry at Robinson's Arch was destroyed and towers built. Excavated remains of the Stoa provide evidence of its demise in a great fire. Chemical analysis of the remains has shown that some of the materials underwent transformations requiring a minimum temperature of ‚Äîa result of sustained, high-temperature burning consistent with Josephus's account of destruction in a large conflagration. Some remains also contain the mineral apatite, a component of bone, though its origins, human or animal, are unknown. Temple Mount excavations The Al-Aqsa Mosque above the Temple Mount's southern Wall. On the left are the remains of Robinson's Arch The site of the Royal Stoa is currently occupied by the Al- Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third-holiest shrine, and is therefore unavailable for archaeological exploration. Between 1968 and 1978, however, professor Benjamin Mazar of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem carried out excavations at the foot of the southern wall. These uncovered over 400 architectural fragments in the destruction debris below the site of the Stoa, some of which were incorporated in secondary use in later Byzantine and Ummayad construction. Despite their fragmentary nature, these provide some of the largest and richest Second-Temple era assemblages ever found, a testament to the splendor described by Josephus. Finds include Corinthian capitals, Doric friezes and modillion cornices. The motifs featured on the fragments found occasionally match patterns witnessed in other Second-Temple era public buildings unearthed in the region, while others reflect unique architectural characteristics. These include floral motifs, rosettes, cable patterns similar to finds in the Hauran region of southern Syria and acanthus leaves featured in Roman architecture. In 1999, the Muslim Wakf authority controlling the Islamic structures atop the Temple Mount began illegally excavating large amounts of fill from the former site of the Royal Stoa in order to construct a new access to the newly established (or, as the Waqf would put it, restored and expanded) Marwani Mosque. Material dug from the site was dumped in the Kidron Valley, so that all the important information which could have been acquired through proper excavation of the material in its archaeological context has been lost forever. Trying to save what could still be saved, an operation to sift through the debris was started by Zachi Zweig and Gabriel Barkay. The ongoing Temple Mount Sifting Project has resulted in the recovery of many architectural fragments from the Second Temple buildings as well as remnants from all other historical periods since the First Temple Period.

He attended Liberty High School in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Early life and high school career Persa was born on November 20, 1988, to parents Dan Sr. and Jane Persa in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. His mother and sister both graduated from Pennsylvania State University, resulting in Persa wishing to play for the Nittany Lions as a child. While attending Liberty High School, Persa played football for three years and competed on their track and field team as a sprinter. As a football player, Persa became the first Pennsylvania high school student to throw over 2,000 yards and rush over 1,000. Off the field, Persa maintained a 4.3 GPA and volunteered with the Special Olympics and local youth programs. In his senior year of high school, Persa committed to Northwestern University on June 23, 2006. He chose to attend Northwestern over football scholarships from the University of Akron, the University of Connecticut, Temple University, and the West Virginia University. Upon graduating, he was ranked 93rd nationally by ESPN/Scouts, Inc. and received 2006 Pennsylvania 4A A.P. Player of the Year. In 2017, he was inducted into the National Football Foundation Lehigh Valley Chapter Hall of Fame. =Recruitment= College career =2010= Persa ruptured his Achilles tendon while throwing the game-winning pass Persa became Northwestern's starting quarterback in 2010 following Mike Kafka's graduation. In the season- opener against Vanderbilt, Persa went 19-for-21 and passed for three touchdowns. In week 2 against the Illinois State Redbirds, Persa went 19-for-23 and passed for 240 yards and two touchdowns. On November 13 against the Iowa Hawkeyes, Persa went 32-for-43 for 318 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. After throwing a 20-yard touchdown pass to Demetrius Fields to win the game in the fourth quarter, Persa suffered an Achilles tendon rupture that required season-ending surgery to repair the injury. Evan Watkins replaced him at quarterback for the remainder of the season. Persa finished the season with 2,581 passing yards and 15 touchdowns. In the 2010 season Persa set the Big Ten single-season record for completion percentage at 73.5%. =2011= Northwestern started a campaign for Persa for the Heisman Trophy before the 2011 season by promoting the slogan \\"Persa Strong\\" on billboards in Bristol, Connecticut, and Chicago. Bruce Feldman of ESPN.com had called Persa the strongest quarterback in the country. Persa bench pressed , squatted , and hang cleaned . He sat out the 2011 season-opener against Boston College on September 3, with Kain Colter starting in his place. Northwestern took Persa's Heisman billboards down on September 9; the University said that the billboard campaign was scheduled to end after one month and it had nothing to do with his injury. He missed the next two games of the season, and, as a result of the injury, stayed in the passing pocket more than he did in 2010. Following the season he participated in the 2012 East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game on January 21, 2012. Professional career After going undrafted in the 2012 NFL Draft, Persa received a tryout with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during the team's rookie mini-camp in May 2012. He injured his ankle during a practice, and the Indianapolis Colts medical team that examined him also diagnosed him with a second Achilles tear that required surgery. The surgery prevented him from playing in 2012. Post-career After failing to enter the NFL, Persa began working as an intern for Duke Realty Corporation under Steve Schnur and in sales at IT firm Computer Aid Inc. He was hired by real estate company CBRE Group in 2014. He was also hired to do color commentary for one Northwestern spring football game on April 5, 2014.

It is the largest popular gathering in France. L'Humanit√© was created in 1904 by French socialist Jean Jaur√®s, but the first f√™te de l'Humanit√© took place in September 1930 to raise funds for the newspaper L'Humanit√© and 1000 people attended it.

Hundreds of stalls are scattered around the venue offering food and drinks with the stall holders coming from all over the world to be part of the event. The f√™te is a unique mix of politics and entertainment, with concerts happening alongside many debates, art exhibits, movies, etc. Because of the proximity of l'Humanit√© with the French communist party, most of the volunteers are communists, even though most of the attendants are not. The festival comprises many stages (Grande Sc√®ne (main stage), sc√®ne Zebrock (rock stage), sc√®ne reggae, P'tite Sc√®ne (smaller stage), and tens of smaller stages inside stalls). The Main Stage can accommodate about 100,000 spectators. Due to its size, this festival is considered the kickoff of the left-wing's \\"political year\\" each year in September.

The figure subsequently went up to an approved $1.2 billion. |}  Expansion of table games Governor Martin O'Malley promised to look to expand Maryland's array of gambling in the 2012 legislative session. On February 7, 2012, Senator Douglas JJ Peters introduced legislation in the Maryland State Senate that would legalize an additional casino in Prince George's County. His legislation would legalize a certain number of slot machines and table games in Prince George's as well as table games for the other two open and three yet-to-open casinos in Maryland. The legislation would set aside 2.5% of the Prince George's County casino revenue for an economic development fund and an additional 2.5% of revenue to fund the construction of a new hospital in the County. Such legislation must be approved by the House of Delegates, Senate, Governor, statewide voter referendum, and county-wide voter referendum. At the time, there was speculation that a casino license in Prince George's County would be awarded to a company that plans to build it at either National Harbor or Rosecroft Raceway. While this proposal failed during the regular 2012 legislative session, Governor O'Malley championed a special session in July of that year to address the issue of gambling expansion, which passed in the Maryland legislature. The casino legislation required it to pass a Maryland referendum in November. On November 6, 2012, the casino referendum passed, allowing table games at the existing authorized casinos and allowing a sixth casino to be built in Prince George's County. On November 6, 2012, Question 7 has voted legalizing table games On December 20, 2013, the Prince George's County casino license was awarded to MGM Resorts International for a casino resort, which opened on December 8, 2016, at National Harbor.

The film was based on a popular rural novel of the time by Tickner Edwardes, and was filmed largely on location on the Sussex Downs. Tansy is a rare survival among Hepworth's feature-length films of the late 1910s and early 1920s, most of which are believed to have been irretrievably lost following Hepworth's bankruptcy in 1924, when his film stock was seized and melted down by administrators to release its saleable silver nitrate content. A full print of the film is held in the British Film Institute's National Archive. Hepworth once remarked: \\"It was always in the back of my mind from the very beginning that I was to make English pictures with all the English countryside for background and with English idiom throughout.\\" Critical assessment of Tansy tends to confirm the ability to capture beautiful English rural landscapes on film as Hepworth's greatest skill, albeit sometimes to the detriment of dramatic narrative when the scenery seems to command more of his attention than the actors or the plot.Tansy (1921) Petley, Julian. BFI Screen Online. Retrieved 2 October 2010 Plot George Firle (Rolf Leslie) is a shepherd, helped in his work by daughter Tansy (Taylor) who has learned shepherding skills from her father. One evening Tansy slips out of the house after her father has gone to the pub to meet up with farm labourer Clem (Ames). George returns, finds Tansy absent and goes to look for her. He finds her in Clem's caravan, trying to fight off unwanted advances, and rescues her. The owner of the farm hears about the incident and assumes that it shows Tansy's immorality and that she must have been leading Clem on to end up in such a compromising situation. He orders George and Tansy to leave the farm. George and Tansy set out on foot for the nearest town. On the journey, George collapses. Local farmer's son Joad Wilverley (Carew) comes across the stricken pair while driving by and offers his help. Arriving at the Wilverley farm, they discover that George has died. The Wilverleys offer shelter to the distraught Tansy, and later she overhears Joad talking with his younger brother Will (Hugh Clifton) about their need for a shepherd. Tansy offers her services, initially to the brothers' amusement, but she proves her worth by expertly rounding up a flock of sheep and is given the job. Tansy's skills give the farm one of its best ever lambing seasons. Meanwhile both brothers have fallen in love with her and begin to realise that they are rivals. Joad, as the elder brother, believes he should have first claim; however Tansy is more drawn to Will, and allows him to kiss her while they are walking together. The fraternal rivalry intensifies and Joad attempts to win over Tansy by buying her expensive gifts. Will finally offers to marry Tansy and she accepts the proposal. Will goes to break the news to Joad, who responds by provoking a fight during which he badly beats his brother. At the same time Clem appears back on the scene and again tries to force himself on Tansy. She manages to break free and flees in panic to the Wilverley house. However Joad has been stricken with remorse for his treatment of Will and orders Tansy to leave, saying she has been the cause of all the trouble between the two. After Tansy has departed, a Wilverley servant tells Joad that Tansy has always loved Will and he must tell Will to go after her. Joad realises the truth that Will and Tansy should be free to marry. He sends Will off in pursuit. Clem has once again caught up with Tansy and is trying to accost her when Will catches up with them and deals appropriately with him. Will and Tansy embrace.

A sharif is a descendant of Hasan ibn Ali, Muhammad's grandson. In Western sources, the prince of Mecca was known as Grand Sherif, but Arabs have always used the appellation \\"Emir\\". The Sharifate existed from about 968 to 1925. From 1201, the descendants of the Sharifian patriarch Qutada ruled over Mecca, Medina and the Hejaz in unbroken succession until 1925. Originally a Zaydi Shi'ite emirate, the Hasanid Sharifs converted to the Shafi'i rite of Sunni Islam in the late Mamluk or early Ottoman period.Politics, Patronage and the Transmission of Knowledge in 13th - 15th Century page 339 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gHsMAQAAMAAJ&q;=shia+sharifs+hijaz&dq;=shia+sharifs+hijaz&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjw7OCn1pDjAhXCLFAKHWFnB9QQ6AEIUTAHRichard T.

Encyclopedia Iranica. www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiites-in-arabia Early history Originally, the sharifs of the Hejaz had generally avoided involvement in public life. This situation changed in the second half of the 10th century, with the rise of the Qaramita sect. The Qaramita directed tribal raids towards Iraq, Syria and much of Arabia, interrupting the flux of pilgrims to Mecca. In 930, Qaramita raiders attacked Mecca, and stole the holy Black Stone from the Kaaba, gravely embarrassing the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad. Abu al-Misk Kafur, an Abbasid vassal and ruler of Egypt, persuaded the Qaramita to end their raids and return the Black Stone to Mecca in return for an annual tribute. As a measure to enhance the safety of the pilgrims he chose one of the sharifs of Hejaz,and installed him as emir of Mecca in about 964. In 1012, the Emir of Mecca Abu'l-Futuh al-Hasan declared himself caliph, but he was persuaded to give up his title in the same year. The first Sulayhid ruler conquered the whole of Yemen in 1062, and proceeded northwards to occupy the Hejaz. For a time, they appointed the Emirs of Mecca. As Sunni power began to revive after 1058, the Meccan emirs maintained an ambiguous position between the Fatimids and the Seljuks of Isfahan. After Saladin overthrew the Fatimids in 1171, the Ayyubids aspired to establishing their sovereignty over Mecca. Their constant dynastic disputes, however, led to a period free of external interferences in the Hejaz. In 1200 circa, a sharif by the name of Qatada ibn Idris seized power and was recognised as Emir by the Ayyubid sultan. He became the first of a dynasty that held the emirate until it was abolished in 1925. The Mamluks succeeded in taking over the Hejaz, and made it a regular province of their empire after 1350. Jeddah became a base of the Mamluks for their operations in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, leading it to replace Yanbu as the main maritime trade centre on the Hejaz coast. By playing off members of the sharifian house against one another, the Mamluks managed to achieve a high degree of control over the Hejaz. Ottoman era 1695 map of the Sharifate of Mecca During the Ottoman period the Emirate was not hereditary, and owed its succession to direct nomination by the Ottoman Porte. A dual system of government existed over the Hejaz for much of this period. Ruling authority was shared between the Emir, a member of the ashraf or descendants of Muhammad, and the Ottoman wƒÅli or governor. This system continued until the Arab Revolt of 1916. Apart from the Emirs of Mecca, Ottoman administration in the Hejaz was first at the hands of the Governor of Egypt and then the Governors of Jeddah. The Eyalet of Jeddah was later transformed into the Hejaz Vilayet, with a governor in Mecca. For much of the 19th century, the northernmost place of the Emirate was Al-Ula, while the southern limit was usually Al Lith, and sometimes Al Qunfudhah; to the east, it never stretched further than the Khaybar oasis. Mecca, Medina and Jeddah were its largest cities. Most of the population of these cities consisted of non-Arab Muslims, including Bukharis, Javanese, Indians, Afghans, and Central Asians. =Early period= The Hejaz region was formerly under the Mamluk Sultanate until its defeat and take over by the Ottomans in 1517.Hejaz (region, Saudi Arabia) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia In the same year, Sharif Barakat of Mecca acknowledged the Ottoman Sultan as Caliph. When the Sharifs accepted Ottoman sovereignty, the Sultan confirmed them in their position as rulers of the Hejaz. Ottoman authority was only indirect, as the arrangement left real power with the Emir. The Sultan assumed the title of \\"H√¢dim√º‚Äôl-Haremeyni‚Äô≈ü-≈ûerifeyn\\", or Custodian of the Two Holy Cities. In 1630, a flood swept Mecca, almost completely destroying the Kaaba. It had been restored by 1636. In 1680, about 100 people drowned in another flood in Mecca. Initially, the Ottomans administered the Hejaz under the Eyalet of Egypt. The Emirs were appointed by the Sultan taking into consideration the choice of the sharifs, as well as the opinions of the walis of Egypt, Damascus and Jeddah (after it was established), as well as that of the qadi of Mecca. The emir of Mecca was always from the Hashemite clan of Muhammad. This situation was ended in 1803, when fundamentalist Wahhabis deposed the ruling Emir of Mecca, Sharif Ghalib. =Wahhabi invasion and Egyptian control= The Wahhabis started to be a threat on the Hejaz from the 1750s onwards. They had risen as a religious movement in Dira‚Äôiyya in the Nejd in 1744-1745. Their doctrine found few sympathisers in the Hejaz, and the Mufti of Mecca pronounced them heretics. They were able to take the two holy cities in 1801. In 1803 the Wahhabis, led by Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, attacked Mecca. Sharif Ghalib fled to Jeddah, which was besieged shortly thereafter. Sharif Ghalib was sent back to Mecca as a Saudi vassal. First Tosun Pasha led the army in 1811 and occupied Medina in 1812 and Mecca in 1813. After his death ƒ∞brahim Pasha, who had accompanied Mehmed Ali's personal visit to the Hejaz in 1814, took over and chased the Wahhabis into the Nejd. Upon the news of the victory, Mahmud II appointed ƒ∞brahim Pasha governor of Jeddah and Habe≈ü. He was the nominal ruler of Hejaz on behalf of the Ottomans from 1811 to 1840. The Wahhabi were ousted from the Hejaz in 1818, when Mehmed Ali Pasha, by then Governor of Egypt, was able to succeed in final victory. The Hejaz then fell under his domination. The 1840 Convention of London forced Mehmed Ali to pull out from the Hejaz. =Vilayet of Hejaz= After 1872, the Sharifate was coterminous with the Hejaz Vilayet. After the Hejaz was restored to the Ottomans, the provincial administration was restructured, and it was organised as the Vilayet of Hejaz. This led to the creation of two parallel political and administrative bodies: the Emirate and the Vilayet. After the Governor started to reside in Mecca, the Vilayet in a way took the Emirate into its jurisdiction, leading to a situation of dual government. The reform provided for the loss of the near-autonomy of the Emir, leading to a conflict between Emir and wali that lasted for the rest of the 19th century. Even then, the Emir of Mecca was not relegated to a position where he would be subordinate to the wali. The Emirs of Mecca continued to have a say in the administration of the Hejaz alongside the governors. The two had an uneasy parallel coexistence: while ruling over the same geography, they divided authority in a complex way, leading to a continuous negotiation, conflict or cooperation between them. As early as the 1880s, there was talk of British occupation of the Hejaz with the support of the ≈üerifs. The British also challenged the Sultan's caliphate by claiming that Britain should appoint the Emir, as it ruled over four times as many Muslims as the Ottomans. Kingdom of Hejaz On 23 December 1925 King Ali surrendered to the Saudis, bringing the Kingdom of Hejaz and the Sharifate to an end.

The KC-130J is the latest variant operated by the United States Marine Corps, with 48 delivered out of 79 ordered. It replaced older KC-130F, KC-130R, and KC-130T variants, while one USMC reserve unit still operates 12 KC-130T aircraft. Development The KC-130F made its first test flight in January 1960 as the GV-1 under the old Navy designation system. First entering service in 1962, the KC-130F was designed to undertake aerial refueling missions in support of USMC aircraft. It was developed from the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. The newest Hercules, the KC-130J, shares 55 percent of the same airframe as preceding models, but in fact is a greatly improved airplane. It is based on the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules and provides significant increases in operational capability and performance margins over preceding KC-130F/R/T (legacy) aircraft. Additionally, The KC-130J reduces cost of ownership through system reliability and reduced maintenance man-hours per flight hour. The new HC-130J combat rescue tanker and MC-130J special operations tanker are both derived from a KC-130J baseline. Technological development has led to the incorporation of interior/exterior night vision lighting, night vision goggle head-up displays, global positioning system, and jam-resistant radios. Some KC-130s are also equipped with defensive electronic and infrared countermeasures systems. Design USMC KC-130 and CH-53Es over the Gulf of Aden, 2003 The KC-130 is a multi-role, multi-mission tactical tanker/transport which provides the refueling support required by the USMC for its aircraft. This versatile asset provides in-flight refueling to both tactical aircraft and helicopters within a operating radius, as well as rapid ground refueling when required. Additional tasks performed are aerial delivery of troops and cargo, emergency resupply into unimproved landing zones within the objective or battle area, emergency medical evacuation, tactical insertion of combat troops and equipment, and evacuation missions. =KC-130J= The KC-130J offers a 27,215 kg (60,000 lbs) fuel capacity that it can allocate between its own flight requirements against aerial refueling offload capacity using its wing and external tanks while in the air. When more fuel is needed, an additional 11,064 kg (24,392 lbs) of fuel can be offloaded from a specially configured internal fuselage 13,627 L (3,600-gallon) aluminum fuel tank. The system also functions without the fuselage tank, so the cargo compartment can be used for cargo on the same mission, giving the aircraft even greater flexibility. The aircraft is ready to fuel fixed-wing, tilt-rotor, or rotary-wing aircraft using the standard probe and drogue technique. The two wing-mounted hose and drogue refueling pods (made by Sargent Fletcher) can each transfer up to 300 gallons (1,136 L) per minute to two aircraft simultaneously allowing for rapid cycle times of multiple-receiver aircraft formations (a typical tanker formation of four aircraft in less than 30 minutes). The KC-130J also provides for rapid ground refueling of helicopters, vehicles and fuel caches. The aircraft has a unique propeller feathering feature (known as ‚Äúhotel mode‚Äù, derived from the term hotel electric power, when a vessel or other means of transport is equipped with a power plant with the sole purpose of generating electric power for lighting, etc., rather than propulsion) which can slow (at 25% rotation speed) the propellers while the turbines continue to run and energize the generator, providing power to the electric fuel pumps. This reduction of the propellers' speed helps to eliminate prop wash behind the KC-130J. This allows ground forces to operate in relative calm while the aircraft offloads up to 2,271 L, 1,823 kg (600 gallons, 4,018 pounds) per minute. The U.S. Marine Corps has chosen the KC-130J to replace its aging KC-130 legacy tanker fleet. The new KC-130J offers increased utility and much needed improvement in mission performance. As a force multiplier, the J-model tanker is capable of refueling both fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft as well as conducting rapid ground refueling. The refueling speed envelope has been widened from 100 to indicated airspeed, offering more capability and flexibility. Offload rates per refueling pod can be up to 300 gallons (1,136 L) per minute simultaneously. The KC-130's offload is significantly greater than previous Hercules tankers. As an example, at 1,000 nautical miles (1,852 km), the fuel offload is well over 45,000 pounds (20,412 kg). =Harvest HAWK= With the addition of the Marine Corps's ISR / Weapon Mission Kit, the KC-130J will be able to serve as an overwatch aircraft and can deliver ground support fire in the form of Hellfire or Griffin missiles, precision-guided bombs, and eventually 30mm cannon fire in a later upgrade. This capability, designated as \\"Harvest HAWK\\" (Hercules Airborne Weapons Kit), can be used in scenarios where precision is not a requisite, such as area denial. The AN/AAQ-30 Target Sight System (TSS) integrates an infrared and television camera, and is mounted under the left wing's external fuel tank. It is the same TSS used on the upgraded AH-1Z Viper attack helicopter .\\"From Hueys to Harvest Hawk: Ordnance Marine arms aircraft in Afghanistan\\" by Cpl. Samantha H. Arrington, DVIDS. 19 May 2011 The typical loadout is four Hellfire missiles and 10 Griffin GPS guided missiles. The weapons systems operator uses a Fire Control Console mounted on an HCU-6/E pallet in the KC-130J's cargo compartment. The aircraft retains its original capabilities in refueling and transportation. The entire system can be removed in less than a day if necessary. The USAF MC-130W Dragon Spear program uses a similar concept. The USMC plans to acquire three kits per active-duty KC-130J squadron for a total of nine kits, each costing up to . It was first test flown on 29 August 2009 by VX-20, and first deployed in October 2010 with VMGR-352. Operational history A VMGR-152 KC-130F landing at Dong Ha, Vietnam, in 1967. The KC-130 has supported operations in the Vietnam War, Operation Desert Shield, Operation Desert Storm, Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom and other USMC operations over the last fifty years. It also participated in the Falklands War for Argentina. VMGR-252, Cherry Point, NC, was the first fleet squadron to transition to the KC-130J. Contrary to most military squadrons when they transition to a new aircraft, VMGR-252 did not \\"stand down\\" to train and equip for the new airframe. Instead, they continued full- time fleet support with their \\"legacy\\" Hercs until fully converted to the J model. This trend was continued by squadrons as they transitioned to the KC-130J. In February 2005, VMGR-252 made the first operational combat deployment of the KC-130J when six aircraft were deployed to Al Asad, Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During this time VMGR-252 experienced many \\"firsts\\" with the new J model conducting aerial refueling, delivery of cargo and passengers, the first combat aerial delivery of supplies by any J model user (the USAF subsequently conducted aerial delivery in Afghanistan with their new J models later that year) and battlefield illumination. VMGR-252 maintained the sole KC-130J presence for a year while VMGR-352 took delivery of and transitioned to the J model. The semi-permissive threat environment and the state of the art defensive systems of the J model permitted it to operate over the battlefield, providing fuel for the jets close to the fight, versus the tanker being far behind the lines in relative sanctuary. On more than one occasion VMGR-252 aircraft came under fire from insurgents, as did VMGR-352 aircraft during subsequent deployments to Iraq. In 2006, VMGR-252 and 352 shared a joint detachment in Iraq and this paradigm continued for a number of years. In the summer of 2006, VMGR-252 provided a two KC-130J detachment in support of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (24MEU) to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus during the Lebanon/Israeli conflict that summer. Also during this time VMGR-252 began extensive operational training and tactics development with the new MV-22 Osprey, refining long range tanker procedures with the new tilt- rotor aircraft. In Spring 2008, VMGR-252 again made KC-130J history by providing the KC-130J aircraft detachment to 24MEU as they reestablished the USMC presence in Kandahar, Afghanistan. This deployment experienced numerous great KC-130J successes conducting all manner of expeditionary type missions routinely landing at austere dirt runways, tactical aerial delivery of goods, and the traditional logistic support and refueling missions that are the hallmark of USMC KC-130 support. KC-130J Harvest Hawk weapon launch markings in Afghanistan, 2011. Though the USMC KC-130Js have left Iraq, a continuing KC-130J presence has now been maintained in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, with aircraft and crews provided by both VMGR-252 and 352 during different periods. In May 2009, the Okinawa-based \\"SUMOS\\" of VMGR-152 provided two aircraft and crews to support the OEF presence. This was VMGR-152's first operational combat deployment since Vietnam, and they have been maintaining a continuing presence in Afghanistan with VMGR-352/252. USMC KC-130J aircraft from VMGR-252 and 352 have additionally been deployed to Djibouti for operations in the Horn of African supporting counter-terrorist operations in the region. After the 2010 Pakistan floods, KC-130Js from USMC VMGR-352 squadron delivered over 90,000 kg (200,000 lbs) of cargo across Pakistan in support of flood relief efforts. The Harvest Hawk weapons system for USMC KC-130J aircraft began its first deployment during October 2010 in Afghanistan with Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 352 (VMGR-352). Its first weapons engagement was on 4 November supporting the 3rd Battalion 5th Marines in Sangin. One Hellfire missile was fired and five enemy insurgents were killed. The battle damage assessment stated there were no civilian casualties or property damage during the fire fight. A KC-130J from the 26th MEU participated in a pilot rescue during Operation Odyssey Dawn. Variants The VMGR-252 KC-130R, in this case BuNo 160625 (ex-AF Ser.

Brerewood was the son of John Brerewood who had been Sheriff of Chester. The Brerewood family over several generations filled many public offices in Chester. In 1605 Brerewood was sent to Brasenose College, Oxford and was later admitted to Middle Temple. He was called to the bar on 13 November 1615, and practised for twenty-two years. He also published some of the literary works of his uncle Edward Brerewood. In 1637 he was appointed a judge of North Wales and was appointed reader at the Middle Temple in Lent term in 1638. He was chosen Recorder of Chester in 1639.Dictionary of National Biography 1885-1900, Volume 6 In April 1640, Brerewood was returned as Member of Parliament for Chester for the Short Parliament. Also in 1640 Brerewood became serjeant-at-law and in 1641 he was appointed king's serjeant. He was knighted in 1643, and raised to the bench as one of the Judges of the Common Pleas. He was sworn in at Oxford where King Charles I then was, and continued to sit until the end of the Civil War but never in Westminster Hall. After the execution of Charles I he retired into private life. Brerewood died at the age of 66 and was buried in St Mary's Church, Chester. Brerewood married twice, firstly to Anna Mainwaring, daughter of Sir Randall Mainwaring of Over Peover, Cheshire, and secondly to Katherine Lea, daughter of Sir Richard Lea of Lea and Dernhall, Cheshire, and had several children by each of his wives.

They were opened on October 2, 2010. The total cost was around ISK 12 billion ($106 million).  Social, economic and cultural impact of the tunnels  In 2008, a seven-year research project was initiated to evaluate the social, economic, and cultural impact of the H√©√∞insfj√∂r√∞ur tunnels. The project was directed by Professor Thoroddur Bjarnason and implemented by a research team at the University of Akureyri. The results show that the tunnel traffic is above expectations. There is considerable commuting between √ìlafsfj√∂r√∞ur and Siglufj√∂r√∞ur, and the vast majority of residents travel between them for shopping, services, events, and social participation. The regional economy has strengthened, and satisfaction with prices and diversity of goods and services has increased. Siglufj√∂r√∞ur has become part of the Eyjafj√∂r√∞ur tourism region and a destination for tourists between Akureyri and the Reykjav√≠k capital region. There has not been an increase in the number of overnight stays, and the predicted tourism circle around the Tr√∂llaskagi peninsula has not materialized. The services of state and municipality have been reduced, in part as result of the economic crisis of 2008. Residents are more satisfied with their educational opportunities but less satisfied with policing and access to health services. Tensions between residents of the two towns do not appear to have increased, even though √ìlafsfj√∂r√∞ur residents tend to think that they do not receive their fair share in public services. A population increase has been observed in Siglufj√∂r√∞ur, while population decline appears to have been halted in √ìlafsfj√∂r√∞ur.

Background and beginnings  King Ludwig I had constructed the Glyptothek and the Pinakothek to house art collections. Part of his intention was to attract intellectual luminaries to Munich, with little result before the efforts made by his successor Maximilian II. Among others came the chemist Justus von Liebig, the ethnologist Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl and the historian Heinrich von Sybel. Two poets who arrived in Munich were Emanuel Geibel and Paul Heyse. In 1852 they joined the cultural society Die Zwanglosen, founded in 1838, which was intended to serve as a meeting- place for both native Bavarians and the new arrivals, the so-called Nordlichter (\\"northern lights\\"). However the two groups became fractious and in 1858 Geibel left. Heyse had already created a new society, following the model of the Tunnel √ºber der Spree in Berlin, of which both he and Geibel had been members. Heyse and Julius Grosse held the inaugural meeting on 5 November 1856 in the coffee-house Zur Stadt M√ºnchen. In the first years Friedrich von Bodenstedt, Felix Dahn, Wilhelm Hertz and Hermann Lingg joined. It was claimed by Felix Dahn that the name of the society came about because of the coincidence that both Geibel and Lingg had recently written poems about crocodiles, but it seems more probable that Lingg's poem Das Krokodil von Singapur was the sole inspiration. :{Das Krokodil von Singapur Im heil'gen Teich zu Singapur Da liegt ein altes Krokodil Von √§u√üerst gr√§mlicher Natur Und kaut an einem Lotusstil. Es ist ganz alt und v√∂llig blind, Und wenn es einmal friert des Nachts, So weint es wie ein kleines Kind, Doch wenn ein sch√∂ner Tag ist, lacht's. ||The Crocodile of Singapore The Holy Pond of Singapore Contains an ancient Crocodile, The glummest kind you ever saw: It chews upon a lotus stem. It's old and now completely blind, And when the night is freezing cold, It weeps just like a little child: But in the day's warm light it laughs. |} \\"The sublime character of this amphibian seemed to us an admirable example to idealistic poets, and we hoped that in our 'holy pond' we should be able to armour ourselves against the base prosaic world, just as we always used to, minding nothing except maybe changes in temperature.\\" (Paul Heyse: Jugenderinnerungen und Bekenntnisse) At meetings, recent works both foreign and local were examined and discussed. As in the Tunnel √ºber der Spree, members adopted pseudonyms: Geibel for example was the Urkrokodil. A complete list of members has not survived.  Literary influence  The group is distinguishable from the Young Germany movement by its non-political stance. The Crocodiles preferred to see poetry as a pure and almost sacred art, ideally following ancient, medieval, and even Oriental models; the result was an eclectic body of work, often of the highest craftsmanship but lacking literary substance. Not coincidentally, most of what has survived has been translations and adaptations, such as Bodenstedt's reworking of Oriental sources and Hertz's poems based on medieval material. After the death of Maximilian II in 1864, policies changed and the grooming of immigrant artists was discontinued. Die Krokodile had lost their main sponsor and public role. An attempt to produce a second group anthology in 1866 was a failure. The society remained in existence chiefly as a social club.

This seaway had split North America into two massive landmasses due to a multitude of factors such as tectonism and sea-level fluctuations for nearly 40 million years. The seaway eventually expanded, divided across the Dakotas, and by the end of the Cretaceous, it retreated towards the Gulf of Mexico and the Hudson Bay. This left the island masses joined in the continent of North America as the Rocky Mountains rose. From the Cenomanian to the end of the Campanian ages of the Late Cretaceous, Appalachia was separated from the rest of North America. As the Western Interior Seaway retreated in the Maastrichtian, Laramidia and Appalachia eventually connected. Because of this, its fauna was isolated, and developed very differently from the tyrannosaur, ceratopsian, hadrosaurid, pachycephalosaur and ankylosaurid dominated fauna of the western part of North America, known as \\"Laramidia\\". Due to high sea levels, subsequent erosion, and the lack of orogenic input of sediment into the Western Interior Seaway unlike the east coast of Laramidia, no terrestrially formed deposits have survived, with most dinosaur remains originating from seaborne carcasses that were transported into marine environments. This same lack of terrestrial sediments is also present on the western coast of Laramidia. Some sediments in the northern part of the range have been removed by glacial erosion of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during Quaternary glaciations, but it is difficult to ascertain how much sediment has been removed, or whether these sediments would have been any more productive than those that remain. Thus relatively little is known about Appalachia in comparison to Laramidia, with the exception of plant life, marine life and the insects trapped in amber from New Jersey. In addition, due to a lack of interest in Appalachia, many fossils that have been found in Appalachia lie unstudied and remain in the inaccurate genera to which they were assigned in the days of E. D. Cope and O. C. Marsh. Only a few fossils of the terrestrial creatures that were found in this region have given us a brief glimpse into what life was like here during the Cretaceous period. However, the area has seen a bit of a resurgence of interest due to several discoveries made in the past few years. As mentioned earlier, not much is known about Appalachia, but some fossil sites, such as the Woodbine Formation, Navesink Formation, Ellisdale Fossil Site, Mooreville Chalk Formation, Demopolis Chalk Formation, Black Creek Group and the Niobrara Formation, together with ongoing research in the area, have given us a better look into this forgotten world of paleontology. Geography Appalachia stretched from Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador all the way down to the Eastern United States and west to the Midwestern United States. Fossils found in these regions indicate that the area was covered in coastal plains and coastal lowlands during the Cretaceous period. Some scientists have proposed the idea that an archipelago of islands had formed during the time that the Western Interior Seaway had divided Laramidia and Appalachia apart until the near end of the Cretaceous. This would allow dinosaurs to migrate into the Gulf Coast and why it would possibly explain why there are some noticeable distinctions with the fauna in the two assemblages of Appalachia. For instance, the southeastern assemblage (which consists of the Carolinas and the Gulf Coast sites) has some tyrannosauroids such as Appalachiosaurus, some hadrosauroids such as Eotrachodon and Lophorhothon, nodosaurs, dromaeosaurs, and new leptoceratopsian while the northern assemblage (which consists of New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland) has some tyrannosauroids such as Dryptosaurus, hadrosauroids such as Hadrosaurus, smaller theropods, and a possible lambeosaur in the area. Range Vertebrate fossils have been found along the Atlantic Seaboard as well as other states like Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and Minnesota. Parts of Canada that were a part of Appalachia during the Cretaceous include, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Nunavut, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia. Fauna =Dinosaurs= From the Cenomanian to the Maastrichtian, Appalachia was inhabited by various groups of dinosaurs including, hadrosauroids, hadrosaurs, nodosaurs, leptoceratopsians, indeterminate ornithopods, tyrannosauroids, dromaeosaurs, ornithomimids, and indeterminate maniraptors lived in the area. There is also fossil evidence of possible chasmosaurs, lambeosaurs, sauropods, allosaurs, caenagnathids, and troodontids that might have inhabited the area. In Late Cretaceous North America, the dominant predators were the tyrannosaurs, huge predatory theropods with proportionately massive heads built for ripping flesh from their prey. Tyrannosaurs were the dominant predators in Appalachia too, but rather than the massive Tyrannosauridae, like Gorgosaurus, Albertosaurus and Lythronax, which evolved around the same time that the Western Interior Seaway had fully separated Laramida from Appalachia, the smaller dryptosaurs were the top predators of Appalachia. Rather than developing the huge heads and massive bodies of their kin, dryptosaurs had more in common with the basal tyrannosaurs like Dilong and Eotyrannus, having long arms with three fingers, and were not as large as the largest tyrannosaurids, though fossils from the Potomac Formation in New Jersey show that some of them did evolve some of the large-bodied features that can be found on other tyrannosaurs. Three genera of valid Appalachian tyrannosaurs are known, Dryptosaurus, Appalachiosaurus, and the recently discovered Teihivenator while other indeterminate fossils lie scattered throughout most of the southern United States like Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Fossil foot bones from Appalachian deposits indicate another, unnamed tyrannosauroid measuring , indicating that diversity in these basal tyrannosauroids remained high during the latest cretaceous. These fossilized teeth possibly belong to a species of Appalachiosaurus or an undescribed species of a new tyrannosaur. There is also the possibility of a fourth tyrannosaur known from Applachia known as Diplotomodon, but this is highly unlikely seeing how the genus is considered to be dubious. Fossils from New Jersey and Delaware, most notably in the Mt. Laurel Formation and Merchantville Formation respectively, have revealed that the primitive tyrannosauroids were much more diverse than expected, and some of them grew to lengths of 8 to 9 meters long, making them around the same size as some of the more advanced tyrannosaurs found in Laramidia. Fossils in Cenomanian deposits further indicate tyrannosauroids had been a constant presence in Appalachia since the middle cretaceous. The dryptosaurs weren't the only predatory dinosaurs in Appalachia. Indeterminate dromaeosaur fossils, possibly belonging to Velociraptorinae and Saurornitholestinae, and teeth, most closely matching those of Saurornitholestes, have also been unearthed in Appalachia as well; mostly in the southern states like Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. Finds from the Campanian Tar Heel Formation in North Carolina indicate that there may have been dromaeosaurids of considerable size; intermediate between genera such as Saurornitholestes and Dakotaraptor. Though known only from teeth, the discovery indicates large dromaeosaurids were part of Appalachia's fauna. Along with the dromaeosauridae remains, tyrannosauroidea and possible ornithomimid remains have been unearthed in Missouri as well. It should also be noted that dromaeosaur remains are more commonly found in the southern region of Appalachia when compared to the northern region, with their sizes ranging from smaller forms to gigantic forms. Recent fossils unearthed in New Jersey show that maniraptors were present in Appalachia as well. Various ornithomimid bones, such as Coelosaurus, have also been reported from Appalachia from Missouri, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and as far north in states like Maryland, New Jersey, and Delaware, but it is now believed that some of these are the bones of juvenile dryptosaurs while others belong to various undescribed species of ornithomimids. As of 2019, no distinct species of ornithomimosaurs have been identified yet, mostly due to the fact that no complete skeleton has been unearthed yet. However, it can be assumed that most of them were around the same size of their Laramidian relatives, though there is one specimen that could have reached a large size similar Gallimimus or Beishanlong. Fossils from the Woodbine Formation, which is one of the few fossil sites which is one of Appalachia's more well preserved fossils, in Texas reveal that other theropods might have roamed Appalachia around the time when the Western Interior Seaway first formed, they include possible specimens of allosauroids, troodontids, caenagnathids, dromeosaurs, and tyrannosaurs. Another common group, arguably the most wide spread species in the area, of Appalachian dinosaurs were the Hadrosauromorpha, Hadrosauroidea, and the Hadrosauridae which is now considered to be their \\"ancestral homeland\\"; eventually making their way to Laramidia, Asia, Bolotsky, Y.L. & Kurzanov, S.K. 1991. [The hadrosaurs of the Amur Region.] In: [Geology of the Pacific Ocean Border]. Blagoveschensk: Amur KNII. 94-103. [In Russian] Europe, South America and Antarctica where they diversified into the lambeosaurine and saurolophine dinosaurs, though some of the primitive hadrosaurs were still present until the end of the Mesozoic. While the fossil record shows a staggering variety of hadrosaur forms in Laramidia, hadrosaur remains for Appalachia show less diversity due to the relative uncommon number of fossil beds. However, a decent number of hadrosaurs are known from Appalachia with Protohadros, Claosaurus, and Lophorhothon representing Hadrosauromorpha, Hypsibema crassicauda and Hypsibema missouriensis representing Hadrosauroidea, and Hadrosaurus and Eotrachodon representing Hadrosauridae. These hadrosaurs from Appalachia seem to be closely related to the crestless hadrosaurs of Laramidia like Gryposaurus and Edmontosaurus, despite the fact that they are not considered to be saurolophines. Claosaurus is known from a specimen which floated into the Interior Seaway and was found in Kansas, might also be from Appalachia, since it was found closer to the Appalachia side of the seaway and is unknown from Western North America. Hadrosaur remains have even been found in Iowa, though in fragmentary remains, Tennessee, most notably from the Coon Creek Formation. Hypsibema crassicauda, over fifty feet long, was one of the largest eastern hadrosaurs, outgrowing some of more derived western hadrosaurs like Lambeosaurus and Saurolophus. The genus likely took the environmental niche occupied by large sauropods in other areas, possibly grown to colossal sizes to that of Magnapaulia and Shantungosaurus. Hypsibema missouriensis, was another large species of hadrosaur, but it grew up to 45 to 49 feet, which wasn't as large as Hypsibema crassicauda. When it was first discovered in 1945, it was mistaken for a species of sauropod. Hypsibema missouriensis, possibly even all of the other hadrosaurs living on Appalachia, had serrated teeth for chewing the vegetation in the area. Hadrosaur fossils from the Kanguk Formation in Axel Heiberg Island in Nunavut, Canada show that hadrosaurs were rather widespread through out Appalach. The fossils found in the Kanguk Formation also revealed the dietary preferences of hadrosaurs, which revealed that they had a diet of conifers, stems, twigs, and various deciduous plants. Indeterminate lambeosaurinae remains, mostly similar to Corythosaurus, have been reported from New Jersey's Navesink Formation, Bylot Island and Nova Scotia, Canada. It cannot yet be explained how lambeosaurines might have reached Appalachia though some have theorized that a land bridge must have formed sometime during the Campanian. The nodosaurids, a group of large, herbivorous armored dinosaurs resembling armadillos, are another testament to Appalachia's difference from Laramidia. During the early Cretaceous, the nodosaurids prospered and were one of the most widespread dinosaurs throughout North America. However, by the latest Cretaceous, nodosaurids were scarce in western North America, limited to forms like Edmontonia, Denversaurus and Panoplosaurus; perhaps due to competition from the ankylosauridae; though they did thrive in isolation, most notably in Appalachia, as mentioned earlier and in the case of Struthiosaurus, Europe as well. Nodosaurid scutes have been commonly found in eastern North America, while fossil specimens are very rare. Often the findings are not diagnostic enough to identify the species, but the remains attest to a greater number of these armored dinosaurs in Appalachia. Multiple specimens have been unearthed in Kansas in the Niobrara Formation, Alabama in Ripley Formation, Mississippi, Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey, possibly belonging to a multitude of different species. Five possible and best-known examples of Appalachian nodosaurids, from both the early and late Cretaceous period, include Priconodon, Propanoplosaurus, Niobrarasaurus, Silvisaurus and possibly Hierosaurus, though its validity is disputed. Just like the Claosaurus specimen, it is possible that the specimens of Niobrarasaurus, Silvisaurus and Hierosaurus floated into the Interior Seaway from the east, since these two species of nodosaurids were discovered in the famous chalk formations of Kansas and are not known from any location from Western North America. Kansas was also a part of Appalachia when the other parts were covered by oceans, which were a part of the Western Interior Seaway. While remains of the advanced ceratopsians, most notably the centrosaurines and chasmosaurines which were very common in Laramidia during this time period, where not found in Appalachia, the leptoceratopsids somehow managed to inhabit that location. A Campanian-era leptoceratopsid ceratopsian has been found in the Tar Heel Formation, marking the first discovery of a ceratopsian dinosaur in the Appalachian zone. This specimen bears a uniquely long, slender and downcurved upper jaw, suggesting that it was an animal with a specialized feeding strategy, yet another example of speciation on an island environment. Recently, a ceratopsian teeth were unearthed in Mississippi's Owl Creek Formation, which have been dated to be 67 million years old. The owner of this one particular tooth was probably a chasmosaurine since by the end of the Cretaceous, the centrosaurines had completely vanished from North America, though they were thriving in Asia as in the case of Sinoceratops. While leptoceratopsid remains, the few that have been discovered in recent years, have been unearthed in the southern part of Appalachia, they appear to be completely absent from the northern part of Appalachia, states like New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland. Suggesting the idea, proposed by paleontologist David R. Schwimmer, that there was a possible providence during the Late Cretaceous. It is not completely understood how the leptoceratopsians were able to reach Appalachia, however, the most commonly accepted theory was that they island hopped during the time that the Western Interior Seaway split the North American continent into two different land masses in a way that some species of leptoceratopsids, most notably Ajkaceratops, were able to reach Europe. It should also be noted that there is a distinct difference with how the leptoceratopsians evolved in Appalachia and Laramida. The Appalachian leptoceratopsian that was unearthed in the Tar Heel Formation, which grew to the size of a large dog, had a more slender jaw that teeth that curved downward and outward in its beak. This would imply a specialized feeding strategy for feeding on the foliage that was native to Appalachia during the Campanian. Several bird remains are known from Appalachian sites, most of them sea birds like Hesperornithes, Ichthyornis, Enantiornithes like Halimornis and Ornithuraes like Apatornis and Iaceornis, possibly indicating that Appalachia might have had a diverse variety of birds that were endemic to the region. Of particular interest are possible lithornithid remains in New Jersey, arguably one of the best records for Cretaceous birds as some specimens were preserved in the greensands in the area,Palaeogene Fossil BirdsA lithornithid (Aves: Palaeognathae) from the Paleocene (Tiffanian) of southern California which would represent a clear example of palaeognath Neornithes in the Late Cretaceous. However, this issue is still under debate. Examples of birds that were endemic to Appalachia include a few groups such as the Charadriiformes, which consisted of Graculavus and Telmatornis, Anseriformes as represented by Anatalavis, Procellariiformes, with Tytthostonyx being one such example, and Palaeotringa and Laornis belonging to a currently unknown group of birds. Hesperornithid fossils have also been unearthed in Arkansas. Some birds found in Canada such as Tingmiatornis and Canadaga were found in areas that were a part of Appalachia. =Non-dinosaur herpetofauna= Through the Ellisdale Fossil Site, a good picture of Appalachia's non-dinosaurian fauna is present. Amidst lissamphibians, there is evidence for sirenids (including the large Habrosaurus), the batrachosauroidid salamander Parrisia, hylids, possible representatives of Eopelobates and Discoglossus, showing close similarities to European faunas, but aside from Habrosaurus (which is also found on Laramidia) there is a high degree of endemism, suggesting no interchanges with other landmasses throughout the Late Cretaceous. There is also a high degree of endemism in regards for its reptilian fauna: among squamates, the teiid Prototeius is exclusive to the landmass, and native representatives of Iguanidae, Helodermatidae, and Necrosauridae. Amidst turtles, which are rather common finds in Appalachia, Adocus, Apalone, and Bothremys are well represented, the latter in particular more common in Appalachian sites than Laramidian ones. Crocodiles were rather abundant in Appalachia with nine local crocodilian genera belonging to several confirmed families, with the possibility of much more undiscovered crocodiles waiting to be unearthed. Goniopholididae is represented by Woodbinesuchus, Alligatoridae is represented by Bottosaurus, Neosuchia is represented by Scolomastax and Deltasuchus, Alligatoroidea are presented Deinosuchus and Leidyosuchus, Gavialoidea are represented by Thoracosaurus, Eothoracosaurus, and Crocodilia is presented by Borealosuchus, are well established in Laramidia as well, probably indicative of their ocean crossing capacities. Deinosuchus, being one of the largest crocodilians of the fossil record, was an apex predator that did prey on the dinosaurs in the area, the same case applies for Laramidia as well, despite the fact that the majority of its diet consisted of turtles and sea turtles. However, crocodiles still preyed on the endemic dinosaurs whenever they got the chance to do so; there is evidence of crocodile bite marks on the femur of large ornithomimosaur that indicates the predatory behavior of native crocodiles. Fossils unearthed in South Carolina and New Jersey shows that some of the crocodilians endemic to Appalachia survived the extinction of the dinosaurs and even persisted into the Cenozoic. Dyrosauridae, most notably Dyrosaurus and Hyposaurus fossils, are also known form Appalachia, particularly in New Jersey, Alabama, and South Carolina. Only one species of Pholidosauridae is known to have lived in Appalachia; Terminonaris whose remains have been unearthed in Texas and Kansas. Pterosaur fossils, mostly similar to Pteranodon and Nyctosaurus, have been unearthed in Georgia, Alabama and Delaware. On a similar note, azhdrachid remains, which belong to Arambourgiania, have been unearthed in Tennessee. There have been a number of specimens of pterosaurs unearthed in areas that were a part of Appalachia during the time that the Western Interior Seaway had divided North America into two landmasses. Fossils of Appalachian pterosaurs have also been unearthed in Kansas and Texas. Pteranodontidae seem the most common groups of pterosaurs in Appalachia and represented by five species: Pteranodon, Nyctosaurus, Geosternbergia, Dawndraco, and Alamodactylus. Members of the Ornithocheiridae and Anhangueridae are represented by Aetodactylus and Cimoliopterus respectively. No fossilized remains of snakes have been discovered in Appalachia during the Cretaceous period, only being found in Laramidia. =Mammals= Several types of mammals are also present on Ellisdale and in the both of the Carolinas. The most common are ptilodontoidean multituberculates, such as Mesodma, Cimolodon and a massively- sized species. The sheer diversity of species on the landmass, as well as the earlier appearance compared to other Late Cretaceous locales, suggests that ptilodontoideans evolved in Appalachia.Late Cretaceous Multituberculates of the Carolinas: My...What Big Teeth You Have! Metatherians are also known, including an alphadontid, a stagodontid,Denton, R. K. Jr., & O‚ÄôNeill, R. C., 2010, A New Stagodontid Metatherian from the Campanian of New Jersey and its implications for a lack of east-west dispersal routes in the Late Cretaceous of North America. Jour. Vert. Paleo. 30(3) supp. and a herpetotheriid. Unlike ptilodontoideans, metatherians show a lesser degree of endemism, implying a degree of interchange with Laramidia and Europe. Research in this area has revealed that theTaeniolabidoidea mammals can trace their origins here and that there were several species of multituberculates endemic to Appalachia. Eutheria fossils, most notably molars, have also been unearthed in Mississippi. It is possible that they belong to a creature rather reminiscent to Protungulatum. The genus Alphadon as well as other members of the Allotheria family have had their remains unearthed in New Jersey. =Marine life= While not much was known about Appalachia's land-based fauna until recently, the marine life that in the area, as well as the life that lived in the nearby Western Interior Seaway, has been well studied by paleontologists for years. Such examples of fossil sites that have preserved the remains of marine life from that period include the Niobrara Formation, the Demopolis Chalk Formation, and the Mooreville Chalk Formation are just a few examples of the fossil sites that have successfully preserved the skeletal remains of various marine creatures from the Cretaceous. Examples of the marine fauna that lived near Appalachia include Chondrichthyes, Osteichthyes, Chelonioidea, Plesiosaurs, and Mosasaurs, which were the apex predators of their environment at the time. Mosasaur remains have even been unearthed in Missouri. Fish fossils are rather common throughout Appalachia, especially in locations abundant in marl, shale, and limestone. Fish fossils, as well as a lot of Cretaceous era marine fauna, are rather abundant in regions like the Niobrara Formation in Kansas, which is made up of shale, sandstone and limestone, as well as the Woodbury Formation in New Jersey. Flora While the fossil sites from the southern part in Appalachia, places like Alabama and the Carolinas, have a very scant amount of Cretaceous plant fossils with the exception of Georgia, the northern parts of Appalachia, such as New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware have a much better record in terms of plant species being unearthed there, especially with fossils sites like the Ellisdale Fossil Site, and have given us a better glimpse into a forgotten world. In the Ellisdae Fossil Site, excavations have revealed that plants like Picea, Metasequoia, Liriodendron, and possibly Rhizophora inhabited the region during the late Cretaceous period, implying that the environment during that time period was a coastal forest with a few types of marine environments as well including estuarine, lagoonal, marine, and terrestrial. Plant fossils found in neighboring states such as Delaware and Maryland have revealed that ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms did indeed inhabit the area. Angiosperm fossils were unearthed in the Dakota Formation in Nebraska. As mentioned earlier, Georgia has a rich fossil record of plant life dating back to the Cretaceous. Some of the examples of flora that was present in that area include Salicaceae, Lauraceae, Sequoioideae, Moraceae, Pinophyta, Malpighiales, Monocotyledon, Ericaceae, Cinnamomum, Ranunculales, Salicaceae, Torreya, Cupressaceae, Magnoliaceae and Rhamnaceae. Plant fossils of Minnesota have revealed that cycads, evergreens, Equisetum, laurels, ferns, willows, redwoods, poplars, tulip trees, and pomegranates were present in the area during the Creataceous. There is also a huge concentration of Normapolles unearthed in the southeastern United States, suggesting that there was a distinct phytogeography through the area during the Cretaceous. Fossils unearthed near from the Redmond Formation in Labrador have revealed that many of the modern-day angiosperms first appeared in Appalachia. Plant fossils found in Crawford County, Georgia show a wide variety of plant diversity such as sporophytes, gametophytes, Detrusandra, Hamamelidaceae, Actinidiaceae, and a multitude of 63 species of plants have been unearthed in this region. Angiosperm plants have been found in the Woodbine Formation. Pinaceae and Lauraceae fossils have been unearthed in Mississippi and North Carolina respectively. Plant fossils found in Massachusetts and Rhode Island indicate that the climate here was sub-humid and paratropical too, indicating that some of Appalachia's habitats largely consisted of coastal plains and deciduous forests. Plants of Pinaceae, Taxodioideae, Araucariaceae, Taxaceae, Cycas and Thallophyte have been found in Georgia and South Carolina.

Uppland Runic Inscription 485 or U 485 is the Rundata catalog number for a Viking Age memorial runestone that is located in Marma, which is about six kilometers northeast of Knivsta, Uppsala County, Sweden, which was in the historic province of Uppland. Description This inscription consists of runic text in the younger futhark carved on a serpent or lindworm that circles a central area where it then becomes intertwined with a ribbon beast in the center. A Christian cross is near the top of the inscription. The granite runestone, which is 1.8 meters in height, was placed on its current base in 1925. It is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr5, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. This stone is considered to be a good example of an inscription in style Pr5. The inscription is signed with the runes ofaigr ybi Ä by the runemaster √ñpir, who was active in the Uppland area in the late 11th and early 12th centuries. The first word in Old Norse is Of√¶ig Ä, which combines a negative prefix √≥ with feigr to mean \\"death bound\\" or \\"fated to die\\" but without any negative connotations intended, thus making a name meaning \\"Not Doomed.\\" This is the only runic inscription of √ñpir with this first name, and it has been suggested that this was the given name of √ñpir. p. 16. The name he used in his other surviving signed inscriptions was the sobriquet or nickname √ñpir, which means \\"Shouter.\\" The runic text states that the stone was raised by two brothers named √ûr√≥tti and Ingulfr as a memorial to their father Sigvi√∞r and by a woman named Ingifastr to her husbandman. The name Ingifastr was carved in runes as inkifa=st, which uses a bind rune to combine an a-rune and an s-rune. Another inscription which used a bind rune to combine these same two runes, which was also signed by √ñpir, is the Varangian runestone S√∂ 308 from Vid J√§rnav√§gen. Bind runes appear disproportionately in names in runic texts, and it has been suggested that they may have been sometimes used to draw attention to a name, similar to the way that initial capital letters are used to start names in European languages today. p. 194-195.

Hepworth, featuring an exploding automobile scattering the body parts of its driver and passenger. \\"One of the most memorable of early British trick films\\" according to Michael Brooke of BFI Screenonline, \\"was one of the first films to play with the laws of physics for comic effect.\\" It features one of the earliest known uses in a British film of the stop trick technique discovered by French filmmaker Georges M√©li√®s in 1896, and also includes one of the earliest film uses of comedy delay - later to be widely used as a convention in animated films - where objects take much longer to fall to the ground than they would do in reality. It is included in the BFI DVD Early Cinema: Primitives and Pioneers and a clip is featured in Paul Merton's interactive guide to early British silent comedy How They Laughed on the BFI website. Synopsis On a quiet suburban road a motor car appears from around a corner in the distance. Two male pedestrians cross the road in front of the vehicle. As the car approaches it is seen to contain a male driver and three high-spirited female passengers waving handkerchiefs towards the camera. The car reaches the foreground and explodes without warning, leaving a smouldering pile of twisted wreckage. A policeman (played by Hepworth himself) happens to be passing, takes out a telescope and looks up to the sky. After a lapse of several seconds he has to dodge out of the way as torsos and severed limbs (but no heads) start to rain down around him. Unperturbed, the helpful policeman takes out his notebook and begins the task of reassembling the assorted body parts, still neatly clothed, into identifiable human beings, conscientiously making notes as he goes.

He campaigned for education, the poor, and the rights of Dalits. Early years Odhavram was born in Jakhau, a small village located on the west coast of Gujarat, India in District Kutchh. He was born in a Bhanushali family on the auspicious day of Hindu festival of \\"Ram Navami\\" in 1889, he was named Udhav. His parents were mother Chaagbai & father Hemraj. Udhav had one elder brother & two sisters. As a kid Udhav was special. He did behave as a child but was more inclined towards spirituality. He loved Music and Bhajans from the age of 5 and when he grew 9, he always carried the Bhagwad Geta to school and at play too. He used to narrate single lines from the sacred Geeta to his friends and at times discuss the same with Pandits too. Udhav got his first Guru at the age of 9, Shanakaranand from Mandvi Takula in Kutch. Udhav learnt Sanskrit and the Vedas from Shankaranand for 6 months and following a life-threatening accident in the ashram was returned to Jakhau. Later, Udhav came to Bombay and worked as a gunny-bag laborer for 8 years but finally left Bombay dedicating his life for the mankind and for the up-liftment of Kutch and Gujarat. Ishwar Ashram Odhavram came to Vandhay in Kutchh. Lalram was the Mahant at the Ishwar Ashram, Vandhai. The Vandhai Ashram follows the Harihar parampara. The Harihar Parampara was started by Deva Saheb in Hamla, Kutchh and a few decades later his disciple Ishwarram settled in Vandhai. After Ishwarrm, Lalram took care of the Ashram and after Lalram, Odhavram was declared the Mahant of the Ishwar Ashram. Kutch gurukul Odhavram always believed that society cannot progress without Education. Odhavram went door to door and person to person in Mumbai, Calcutta & Madhya Pradesh asking people to contribute funds to start the first gurukul in Kutch. As the construction of the gurukul began, Odhavram walked from house to house, village to village preaching the need of education. At times Odhavram used to work as a laborer carrying bricks overhead, make the cement mix and feed workers with food & water. The first gurukul of Kutch was named Ishwarram Gurukul & inaugurated on Vasant Panchami of year 1937 A.D. Odhavram welcomed his first batch of 330 students. Odhavram was firm and dedicated in his decisions and this dedication made his gurukul dream come true. Now he wanted to push the gurukul barriers further by wanting to teach and educate the blind. He believed and preached that we all are children of God and we all deserve love and respect in the society. A blind person has no option but to beg or rely on family. He wanted to gift the blind self-reliance and respect in society. The school for the blind began in 1938. He called for the brail script from Bombay and his first batch had 7 or 8 students. Apart from book knowledge he used to teach them the intelligence of senses. He revealed to them, their power of ears, nose and fingers. Sadhu Sevadas who studied in the blind school, still resides at the Ishawar Ashram, Vandhai, Kutchh. The 19th & 20th century was the period of illiteracy & poverty. People inclined towards Spirituality could be easily cheated in the name of God. In the same era, the Kadwa Patidar Samaj fell into the hands of some greedy spiritual Gurus and got converted to a religion that has had no existence in history called the Peerani Panth. Odhavram struggled for 16 years to bringing the entire Patidaar Samaj back to Sanatan Dharma. In this struggle Odhavram faced 3 to 4 life- threatening attacks but escaped without a scratch. Once a guy entered his Sadhana Kutir (meditation place) & tried to shoot at him from point blank range but failed. Once he was attacked by a mob of 8-10 people with swords but they failed. Odhavram was a believer of \\"Ahimsa Paramo Dharma\\" (Non violence the highest religion). In his entire life span he never ever touched a weapon & still succeeded in his mission on faith & dedication. Follower of Gandhi In 1943, Odhavram supported Gandhi‚Äôs movement to accept the untouchables as part of the society. In Odhavram‚Äôs life this was the only decision that sparked off the society against him. Villagers throughout Kutch revolted but Odhavram stood firm on his decision. Some unsocial elements started provoking the villagers & People started leaving him. But as every night has a day, Harijans got their rightful place in the society & Odhavram won his battle for humanism with pride and dignity. Odhavram was a firm believer of Mahatma Gandhi & follower of his deeds. Odhavram accepted Gandhi's Swadeshi Apnao slogan & put it to practice the same day. He started weaving his own clothes on the charkha and made it compulsory for every student of the Gurukul to learn & weave. Odhavram used to say one should first practice what he preaches. In 1945, a convention was called under the leadership of Meher Ali in Mundra. Odhavram was also invited for this convention as his speeches had a very strong impact on people. When Odhavram was invited to give some spiritual discourses a strange incident happened. Odhavram said \\"I cannot die in peace till my motherland is freed from these invaders. In this freedom fight write my name first followed by my 330 students of the Gurukul. I would be honored to sacrifice my life for my motherland\\". In 1947, India was declared independent and Odhavram continued to serve mankind. 1940 drought The year 1940 saw the worst drought of Kutchh. Cattle were dying in thousands. In this period Odhavram sidelined all his other activities & dedicated his life for the suffering cattle & villagers. Odhavram said \\"Saving these speechless cattle is the first and foremost responsibility of a true Hindu. If one has to give away everything he has and even his life for this noble cause it worth\\". In thousands cattle started flowing in Vandhai and Odhavram offered sufficient food, water & shelter for all. At times he, his students and ashram had to starve but thousands of cows & other cattle was saved. Bhanushali movement In 1942, Odhavram started a movement for the Bhanushali community. Bhanushalis are Surya Vanshi but due to illiteracy & poverty were being harassed by society. Odhavram decided to draw a path for his own community & give them their real place in the society. He traveled across villages & cities preaching the importance of education & finally succeeded in starting the first boarding in Mandvi. Bhansuhali Haridas Pradhan Joisar sold off almost all his properties & life savings to manage the required funds for this cause. A few years later Odhavram also struggled to build home shelter for the Bhanushalis who had migrated from Kutch to Bombay for work & with funds provided by Bhanushali Haridas Velji Joisar of Bombay. The Bhanushali wadi in Bombay, came into existence in year 1952. During this era there was a 9-year- old girl who came very close to Odhavram. Odhavram blessed her with his knowledge & today she is serving mankind & showing all the divine path to happiness. She is Param Pujya Sant Mataji Rama Devi of Haridwar. Later years In year 1954, Odhavram handed over the Vandhai Ashram to \\"Dayaddasji\\" and reached Haridwar to spend the rest of his life at the Ganges but when he saw a few Kutchi‚Äôs roaming on the streets of Haridwar without any place to stay, He felt the need of a Dharmashala for people to stay & spend their last days peacefully. He wrote several letters asking for funds & help. Among his very close follower & associate, was Manji Jeram Rathod of Madhapar belonging to Kutch Gurjar Kshatriya Samaj. Manji Jeram took the leadership to build Kutchi Ashram in Haridwar and started with a large personal donation and roamed whole India to collect monies from rich families of his community as well Patidar, Bhanushali, Mistri and other communities of Kutch. Finally, the Kutchhi Lalrameshwar Ashram at Haridwar was established in 1956. Pujya Jashoda Maa gave a helping hand & worked day & night in setting up the ashram. In Haridwar, Odhavram found a holy soul who would follow his path of serving mankind after he was gone. His name was ‚ÄúValji‚Äù. Valji took Diksha from him and became Valdas. Valdas started serving mankind & followed the path laid by Odhavram.

The game features a time travel theme as well as an organized weapon select screen at the beginning of each stage. Story In the year 2090, mankind invents a supercomputer called Desmoura to manage Earth's environment. Capable of replicating itself in various technological inventions, Desmoura achieves sentience as it sets itself around Earth's orbit. It becomes so powerful when it gains the capabilities to build a time machine in a matter of twenty years. Without warning or reason, Desmoura sends various war machines back in time by 100 years and starts attacking mankind's past technological feats possibly to change Earth's history. Special space fighters called STEALTHs are sent to fly against Desmoura's forces, attack the affected timelines and eventually destroy Desmoura. Gameplay Players travelled back in time starting in Great Britain 1945, Germany 1915, Japan 1945, Germany 1944, Vietnam 1974, France 1914, Russia 1974 and finally the space station in the present time, 2110. Each time stage has two levels, both ending in a boss battle save for the final stage, resulting in a total of 15 Areas. The STEALTH ship weapon system is accessed in the beginning of each stage. The ship's main shot consists of a semi-automatic Wave Shot. The ship's bomb weapons include forward firing Missiles, Fire Balls, Homing missiles and the Buster bomb. The ship can be equipped with only one bomb weapon from either category at a time. The ship can only be loaded with a certain number of Bomb weapons and they can only be resupplied at the end of the level. The only pick-up item in the game is a parachuting human pilot shot down from malfunctioning fighter planes/jets; collecting these pilots results in random Bonus Points.

Muller (born October 12, 1948, in Flushing, New York) is an American historical theologian. Life Muller obtained his B.A. in History from Queens College, City University of New York in 1969, his M.Div. from Union Theological Seminary, New York in 1972, and his Ph.D. in Reformation studies from Duke University in 1976. He has taught at Fuller Theological Seminary (1980‚Äì1992), has been awarded a Mellon Post-Doctoral Research Grant and has held the Belle van Zuylenleerstoel at Utrecht University (1999). He has served on the editorial boards of Sixteenth Century Journal and Reformation and Renaissance Review. He is P. J. Zondervan Professor of Historical Theology Emeritus and is Senior Fellow of the Junius Institute for Digital Reformation Research at Calvin Theological Seminary in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Work Muller's research and writing has been largely focused on the reassessment of the development of Protestant thought after the Reformation, with emphasis on the nature and character of Protestant orthodoxy and Reformed scholasticism in the seventeenth century. Muller is one of the historians credited with setting aside the \\"Calvin against the Calvinists\\" theory of developing Reformed thought. W. J. van Asselt et al., Inleiding in de Gereformeerde Scholastiek (Zoetermeer: Boekencentrum, 1998): 28, 73‚Äì74, 91‚Äì92. His argument is that the attempt to define the entire Reformed tradition in terms of the thought of Calvin is a historical error, inasmuch as Calvin was one of several second generation codifiers of the tradition and inasmuch as the tradition itself was, early on, rather diverse and variegated. The \\"Calvin against the Calvinists\\" thesis tended to claim in a rather reductionistic way that Calvin was a \\"christocentric\\" theologian in contrast to later Reformed thinkers who had developed a radical predestinarian or deterministic metaphysics. By contrast Muller has argued that the later Reformed thinkers did not develop a predestinarian system but instead understood theology in terms of a series of biblically and traditionally based loci or topics. Their thought does differ in places from Calvin's, but the differences are to be explained on the basis of other sources of the Reformed tradition, such as the thought of Martin Bucer, Heinrich Bullinger, Peter Martyr Vermigli, and others, on the basis of alterations in debate and historical context.Richard A.

The ONUB operation would replace the African Union mission in the country. Resolution =Observations= The Security Council reiterated its support for the Peace and Reconciliation Agreement signed in Arusha in 2000, calling on the relevant parties to honour their commitments under the agreement. Transitional institutions were urged to enact legislation for election preparations before the transitional period ended on 31 October 2004. It noted that two ceasefire agreements were signed between the rebel National Council for the Defense of Democracy ‚Äì Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD) and the transitional government, though hostilities in parts of Burundi continued. The preamble of the resolution also condemned all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, including mass rape, and the need to bring the perpetrators to justice. There was concern at the economic and humanitarian situation of the majority of the civilian population. Meanwhile, the Council welcomed progress in preparing the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) programme for combatants, and the efforts of a mission of the African Union deployed in Burundi were praised. It was also aware of the difficulties of maintaining stability in Burundi unless it was achieved in neighbouring states, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo. =Acts= Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council authorised the ONUB operation for an initial period of six months, beginning on 1 June 2004. It would be headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and consist of 5,650 military personnel and 120 police. Furthermore, it was authorised to use all necessary means to fulfill the following mandate: * Monitor and investigate any violations of the ceasefire; * Promote trust between the Burundian forces, collecting and securing weapons; * Disarm and demobilise combatants; * Monitor the cantonment of the armed forces and their heavy weapons; * Monitor the illegal arms trade; * Provide secure conditions for humanitarian aid delivery and the return of refugees; * Provide a safe environment for the electoral process; * Protect the population against imminent threats; * Protect United Nations personnel and facilities, co-ordinate demining efforts. ONUB was also tasked with assisting the Burundian government through monitoring of the country's borders; institutional reforms; training of the army and police; electoral activities; reforming the judiciary and penal systems; promoting and protecting human rights; extending the authority of the state throughout the country; and running the national DDR programme. The resolution asked Burundi to conclude a Status of Forces Agreement with the Secretary-General Kofi Annan within 30 days, and all parties were called upon to co-operate with ONUB. It was also necessary that ONUB had access to effective public channels such as radio, television and newspapers to promote the peace process and the role of the operation in Burundi. Meanwhile, donors were urged to contribute towards the long-term development of Burundi. Finally, the Council directed the operation in Burundi and the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) to co-ordinate their activities and share military information, particularly with regard to movement of rebels and weapons. The Secretary-General was asked to report on the situation in Burundi at regular intervals.

It reduces the count of transistors used to make different logic gates, by eliminating redundant transistors. Transistors are used as switches to pass logic levels between nodes of a circuit, instead of as switches connected directly to supply voltages.Jaume Segura, Charles F. Hawkins CMOS electronics: how it works, how it fails, Wiley-IEEE, 2004 , page 132 This reduces the number of active devices, but has the disadvantage that the difference of the voltage between high and low logic levels decreases at each stage. Each transistor in series is less saturated at its output than at its input.Clive Maxfield Bebop to the boolean boogie: an unconventional guide to electronicsNewnes, 2008 , pp. 423-426 If several devices are chained in series in a logic path, a conventionally constructed gate may be required to restore the signal voltage to the full value. By contrast, conventional CMOS logic switches transistors so the output connects to one of the power supply rails, so logic voltage levels in a sequential chain do not decrease. Simulation of circuits may be required to ensure adequate performance.  Applications  SRAM cell. M5 and M6 are bidirectional pass transistors. gated D latch, similar to the ones in the CD4042 or the CD74HC75 integrated circuits. Pass transistor logic often uses fewer transistors, runs faster, and requires less power than the same function implemented with the same transistors in fully complementary CMOS logic. Norimitsu Sako. \\"Patent US7171636: Pass-transistor logic circuit and a method of designing thereof\\". 'It is known in the art to employ a \\"pass- transistor logic circuit\\" to reduce a number of elements and power consumption, and to improve operating speed.' XOR has the worst-case Karnaugh map‚Äîif implemented from simple gates, it requires more transistors than any other function. The designers of the Z80 and many other chips saved a few transistors by implementing the XOR using pass-transistor logic rather than simple gates. Ken Shirriff. \\"Reverse-engineering the Z-80: the silicon for two interesting gates explained\\". 2013\\\\. Basic principles of pass transistor circuits The pass transistor is driven by a periodic clock signal and acts as an access switch to either charge up or charge down the parasitic capacitance Cx, depending on the input signal Vin. Thus there is two possible operations , when the clock signal is active (CK = 1) are the logic \\"1\\" transfer (charging up the capacitance Cx to a logic-high level) and the logic \\"0\\" transfer (charging down the capacitance Cx to a logic-low level). In either case, the output of the depletion load nMOS inverter obviously assumes a logic-low or a logic-high level, depending upon the voltage Vx. Complementary pass transistor logic Some authors use the term \\"complementary pass transistor logic\\" to indicate a style of implementing logic gates that uses transmission gates composed of both NMOS and PMOS pass transistors. Gary K. Yeap. \\"Practical Low Power Digital VLSI Design\\". 2012\\\\. p. 197.

Other authors use the term \\"complementary pass transistor logic\\" (CPL) to indicate a style of implementing logic gates using dual-rail encoding.

Complementary pass transistor logic or \\"Differential pass transistor logic\\" refers to a logic family which is designed for certain advantage. It is common to use this logic family for multiplexers and latches. CPL uses series transistors to select between possible inverted output values of the logic, the output of which drives an inverter The CMOS transmission gates consist of nMOS and pMOS transistor connected in parallel. Other forms Static and dynamic types of pass transistor logic exist, with differing properties with respect to speed, power and low-voltage operation.Cornelius T. Leondes Digital signal processing systems: implementation techniques Elsevier, 1995 page 2 As integrated circuit supply voltages decrease, the disadvantages of pass transistor logic become more significant; the threshold voltage of transistors becomes large compared to the supply voltage, severely limiting the number of sequential stages. Because complementary inputs are often required to control pass transistors, additional logic stages are required.

He was well known as a virtuoso on the baritone horn, having extensively performed, written, and educated on the instrument. Falcone was best known as Director of Bands and Professor of Tuba and Euphonium at Michigan State University and as director of the Spartan Marching Band from 1927 through 1967. During Falcone's tenure at MSU the band expanded from a small ROTC auxiliary band to a large nationally known Big Ten marching band. Scholarship endowments at Michigan State University and Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp were established in his honor, as was the Leonard Falcone International Tuba and Euphonium Festival. Early Life and Family Born Leonardo Vincenzo Falcone in Roseto Valfortore, Italy on April 5, 1899.Michigan State University Archives - Leonard Falcone Collection https://www.msu.edu/unit/msuarhc/falcone1.htm First playing Alto Horn and Violin, Falcone became active in the local town band in Italy. He studied multiple instruments and conducting under Maestro Donatto DonatelliLeonard Falcone and His Baritone, Crest Records RE7001 (late 1950s) Copyright Michigan State University in Naples in his teens. At age 16 Falcone followed his brother Nicholas, who had emigrated in 1912, to the United States. There he enrolled in the University School of Music in Ann Arbor, Michigan,Windsong Press Biographical information - Leonard Falcone https://www.windsongpress.com/brass%20players/tuba/falcone.htm which would eventually become the University of Michigan School of Music, where he met many of his lifelong professional and personal colleagues and friends. Nicholas followed professor Wilfred Wilson as Director of Bands at the school in the 1920s. Nicholas first hired Leonard as a tailor's assistant since he had found work as a tailor and theater clarinet player. Nicholas later hired Leonard again to play trombone at the Ypsilanti Michigan silent movie theater when Nicholas began conducting the pit orchestra. Leonard Falcone proudly became a citizen of his adopted country in 1924. Two years later, he would graduate from college with a degree in violin.Dean of America's Bandmasters, Edward Deeb, MSU Alumni MAgazine Nov.1960 Leonard and Beryl Falcone around 1960. Leonard married Betty Beryl Cromer (October 29, 1920 - December 5, 2015) of Kalamazoo on December 19, 1948. Beryl, as she was known, met Leonard while playing in one of his summer bands at MSU during her graduate studies. Leonard and Beryl had two children: Mary Beryl (August 6, 1950 ‚Äì January 18, 2015) and Cecilia (b. May 25, 1952). They also raised their only grandchild Mary Lisa Fulton (b. September 3, 1968). For most of their marriage and until Leonard's death, the Falcone family lived at 519 Charles St. in East Lansing, Michigan.Comstock, Rita Griffin. (2011). Solid brass: The Leonard Falcone Story (Twin Lake, Mich: Blue Lake Press, 2011), 156-162. Michigan State University In 1927 Falcone applied for the band directorship at Michigan State College and was awarded the position. The entire college at the time had roughly 2500 students and the band only 65. Because the Institute of Music and Arts, which the College of Music was first known as, was not formally created until the following year, he began as director of the military band, professor of wind instruments, and Italian. As the programs grew along with the Falcone brothers' own reputations as bandmasters, both brothers also competed as prolific arrangers of music for concert band. In 1935 Nicholas lost his hearing and for a year, until longtime U. of M. director William D. Revelli was hired, Leonard commuted between East Lansing and Ann Arbor, serving as Director of Bands at both schools. He was the only person to do so at these schools (which are historic rivals) until the arrival of Kevin Sedatole, the current director of bands, who served as associate director of bands at the University of Michigan previously.Faculty profile for Kevin Sedatole, Michigan State University College of Music website http://people.music.msu.edu/detail.asp?ContactID=76&RecPos;=60 Wikipedia Page Michigan Marching Band History Falcone enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps on September 23, 1942. He served eight months as a member of the Air Force Band at Maxwell Field, Alabama. He later organized the 388th Air Force Band at Stuttgart, Alabama. In Falcone's absence the MSC band was placed under the temporary directorship of Dale C. Harris. Falcone returned to campus for good on October 1, 1943. During the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, Falcone expanded the role and performances of the band and established himself as a leading teacher and performer on baritone horn (and euphonium).Life and Work of Leonard Falcone, Myrna Delford Welch, University of Illinois Press, 1973 Performances by the band at the White House, the New York World's Fair, and televised performances at the Rose Bowl parade in 1954, 1956, and 1965, along with the multiple recordings of both the MSC bands and Falcone on baritone, would bring his name and music at Michigan State onto the national stage. He was initiated as an honorary member of the Gamma Epsilon chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity at Michigan State in 1940, an honorary member of the Zeta Epsilon chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi fraternity at Michigan State in 1972, and an honorary member of the Zeta Epsilon chapter of Tau Beta Sigma in 1978. Falcone retired in 1967 and Michigan State bestowed an honorary doctorate on him in 1978. He remained Professor Emeritus of Baritone and Euphonium for the rest of his life. Falcone's career at MSU was pivotal in transforming a military auxiliary band of 65 into today's MSU College of Music with hundreds of students and tens of thousands of alumni.Spartan Marching Band History Artist and Teacher Leonard Falcone toured as a solo artist for decades as well as publishing several solo recordings. Michigan State University owns the rights to these recordings and republishes them from time to time as students of Baritone and Euphonium still seek them out. He was regarded by some as the 20th century master of his instrument as Simone Mantia had been regarded before him. Many of those recognized by the Falcone Competition and other similar authorities as the current masters, either studied under, or under students of, Falcone.Falcone Festival website http://falconefestival.org Brian Bowman, who acknowledged in an interview studying the recordings instead of studying with the man,Leading Euphonium Artists, The Instrumentalist, proper citation needed for date (late 70s) was an oft-noted exception. Falcone's students include leading artists such as Roger Behrend, Earle Louder, and many others. Falcone offered the facilities of Michigan State College for summer youth music camps for many years and later assisted the Stansel family with making the Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp, a leading facility for the same.Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp - The Early Years, Fritz Stansel, RDR Books, Muskegon, Michigan, 2007 - P.215 In 1941, at the urging of friends and colleagues in southeast Michigan who had formed the predecessor to today's Michigan School Band and Orchestra Association in 1934, Falcone hosted the Band and Orchestra Festival at MSC. These festivals became an ongoing annual event and also include marching band, solo, and ensemble festivals where thousands of Michigan schools and students compete at regional and then, if qualified, state levels where they are adjudicated by experts in the field each year.Michigan School Band and Orchestra Association Website https://www.msboa.org Falcone wrote, lectured extensively, and presented many clinics on band technique and playing.Allen House Museum, Birmingham Michigan - Music in the Birmingham Schools Collection He published lists of Euphonium repertoire and conducted master classes and clinics at music education venues such as the annual midwestern music conference. He enjoyed working with young people at Blue Lake and also often worked with high school groups as both soloist and clinician - rehearsing the groups with whom he would then play. Falcone continued to teach well after his official retirement in 1967 and maintained an office on campus until his death in 1985. Only months earlier, he had still been coaching a young student on Euphonium, planning an Italian tour for an alumni band, and working to arrange an oriental march for concert band. While the march arrangement was never finished, the alumni band did tour Italy the following summer. Death and Legacy Leonard Falcone at roughly age 80 works with a young euphonium player. Leonard Falcone passed away May 2, 1985 at the St. Lawrence Dimondale Center in Dimondale, Michigan. Among Falcone's final visitors, besides his family, were Spartan Marching Band alumni and students who sang and played to him. Former Spartan Marching Band director Kenneth G. Bloomquist visited Falcone the day before his death. Bloomquist recalled his final interaction with Falcone in Solid Brass:The Leonard Falcone Story: \\"He was very, very quiet, very tired - he had no energy at all. When he would talk I had to get my ear an inch or two to his mouth to hear him, and he whispered, 'Ken, why is this happening to me?'\\"Comstock, Rita Griffin. 2011. Solid brass: the Leonard Falcone story. Twin Lake, Mich: Blue Lake Press. Falcone's playing, as well as his devotion to teaching and advancing the instrument, led his students to create the Falcone International Tuba and Euphonium Festival, which seeks to give a stage to new talent and future artists on his instrument and Tuba. Each August, the festival competition welcomes masters of the instruments and new students alike to Twin Lake, Michigan. While still retaining some aspects of its military origins, the Michigan State University Spartan Marching Band lives on in the modern form established by Falcone, with most of its cherished traditions and values deriving from his 1927 to 1967 tenure. The band was and is nationally recognized for excellence and has been seen by millions through its many performances on television and at major events, including performing for five sitting US Presidents.Wikipedia Page Michigan State University Spartan Marching Band Falcone left to the concert band movement a wealth of arrangements of classical orchestral and operatic music that he adapted to the instrumentation and timbre of the band as well as many military marches from cultures around the world adapted to modern western instrumentation. Michigan State University's marching band continues to play its iconic version of the MSU Fight Song, affectionately known to the band as \\"Falcone Fight\\". During his tenure at Michigan State University, the fight song was a very dynamic arrangement, ever subject to changes, as can be heard in the various recordings found throughout the University archives. The Spartan Marching Band now recognizes a specific one of his many arrangements as \\"Falcone Fight\\". (However, it also plays another variation, \\"Pregame Fight\\" arranged by former SMB assistant director, William Moffit, for pregame performance and as an in- game celebration.) Falcone published many articles, solo literature repertoires, and even a beginning baritone method in two volumes co-authored with Birmingham Michigan teacher Arnold Berndt and published by Belwin. His most enduring publication, however, has been the recordings which live on today in CD and mp3 formats in many places both with and without the permission of Michigan State University. His legacy to future musicians at Michigan State University will continue, including the Leonard Falcone Scholarship, established by the alumni in 1967 and funded by many contributions as well as the proceeds from the legitimate sale of Falcone recordings.

It was written by Dave Mustaine for inclusion in the 2010 music video game Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, which was released on September 28, 2010 in North America. The song itself was released as a single with cover art on iTunes on September 24, 2010, and on September 28, Roadrunner Records made the song available for streaming on its website. It is Megadeth's first release with bassist Dave Ellefson since 2002, following his return to the band in 2010. The song was well received by critics and was described as one of the hardest songs in the Guitar Hero franchise. Roadrunner Records submitted the song to consideration for Best Metal Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. Several months later it was nominated, making it the band's second consecutive nomination, following \\"Head Crusher\\" in 2010, and band's ninth overall nomination in the category. Although the song was not originally recorded for an album, it was later included as the opening track on the band's 2011 album, Thirteen, as a remixed version by Johnny K. Development In early February 2010, it was reported that Megadeth was working on a yet unnamed secret song project. What the project was about or how it would be released was not known or announced at the time. Several weeks later, ultimately after much speculation, the project was reported to be a promotional recording by Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine. In early March the song had its name announced: \\"Sudden Death\\", though some sites had mistakenly reported the song as \\"Sudden Deth\\". A few months later it was confirmed that the song was written exclusively for Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and would be featured in an important part in the game. The Megadeth songs \\"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\\" and \\"This Day We Fight!\\" were also set to be featured in the game. It was the first song Megadeth recorded with original bassist Dave Ellefson following the replacement of James LoMenzo in early 2010. \\"Sudden Death\\" was the first release with original bassist Dave Ellefson since 2002 About the recording of the song, Mustaine remarked, \\"I thought it was a great idea for us. We've had experience with games in the past, and our songs have been in sports games and Grand Theft Auto, but we never really got into the Guitar Hero thing. When they talked to us about doing this, I never imagined it would be something this honorable.\\" Later in the same interview he continued, \\"Only once in my career have I had this happen before,\\" referring to 1991's soundtrack for Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, to which Megadeth contributed \\"Go to Hell\\". \\"We had written something and Interscope told me to make the lyrics even darker. Activision heard the track, and said, 'We want more solos on it.' And I said, OK, I can do that.\\" Before release, for promotional purposes, Dave Mustaine had publicly played the song on Guitar Hero showcasing the high level of difficulty of the song, to a high degree of media coverage. To further promote the game and the band, a T-shirt was released featuring the cover artwork. The full lyrics were later confirmed and released officially after the release of the song, along with official single cover art, featuring the band's iconic mascot Vic Rattlehead falling from the sky with a failed parachute and burning angel wings. Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock \\"Sudden Death\\" was featured in a pivotal point during the game's storyline. During the last level of the story-mode of the game, the game's narrative culminates during a level called the \\"Battle of the Beast\\", or also renowned as \\"level ten\\". The finale is set to a new 2-part arrangement by Megadeth. Two other Megadeth songs, \\"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\\" and \\"This Day We Fight!\\" were also featured during the same level, making the finale of the game three consecutive Megadeth songs. When the player has completed the \\"Battle with the Beast\\", they have the opportunity to return to the previous venues and have otherwise beaten the game. Dave Mustaine co- composed the song as a means of \\"challenging the Guitar Hero community\\", and contains portions that he believed were \\"the most difficult parts\\" he has written in his life. Reception Initial sales of Warriors of Rock were below estimates. The NPD Group reported 86,000 units sold in the United States across all platforms for the last five days of September during which it was available. This figure fell below the initial sales of the previous games, such as 1.5 million and 500,000 units in first-week sales for Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and Guitar Hero World Tour, respectively. The game was released September 24, 2010 in Europe, September 28, 2010 in North America and September 29, 2010 in Australia, and the game itself received mixed though generally positive reviews. However, Megadeth's contributions were in particular well received, with \\"Sudden Death\\" being described as one of the hardest songs in the franchise's history. In December 2010, the song was announced as a nominee for Best Metal Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. This was the band's second straight nomination, being nominated for \\"Head Crusher\\" the year prior in the same category. This is also the band's ninth nomination overall. Until 2017, Megadeth had never won a Grammy Award, and were one of the most nominated bands ever without a win and are now the second most nominated metal band in history. It was producer Andy Sneap's 3rd Grammy nomination and his second with the band. \\"Sudden Death\\" was nominated against Iron Maiden's \\"El Dorado\\", Korn's \\"Let the Guilt Go\\", Lamb of God's \\"In Your Words\\" and Slayer's \\"World Painted Blood\\".

Biography Born in Mantua, he studied mathematics and physics at the University of Vienna. From 1876 to 1879 he was professor at the University of Graz. In 1882 he went to the Graz University of Technology and in 1884 he went to the University of Vienna, where he also was president of the university in 1903/04. Together with Emil Weyr he founded the journal Monatshefte f√ºr Mathematik und Physik and together with Ludwig Boltzmann and Emil M√ºller he founded the Austrian Mathematical Society. Escherich died in Vienna. Work on hyperbolic geometry Following Eugenio Beltrami's (1868) discussion of hyperbolic geometry, Escherich in 1874 published a paper named \\"The geometry on surfaces of constant negative curvature\\". He used coordinates initially introduced by Christoph Gudermann (1830) for spherical geometry, which were adapted by Escherich using hyperbolic functions. For the case of translation of points on this surface of negative curvature, Escherich gave the following transformation on page 510: :x=\\\\frac{\\\\sinh\\\\frac{a}{k}+x'\\\\cosh\\\\frac{a}{k}}{\\\\cosh\\\\frac{a}{k}+x'\\\\sinh\\\\frac{a}{k}} and y=\\\\frac{y'}{\\\\cosh\\\\frac{a}{k}+x'\\\\sinh\\\\frac{a}{k}} which is identical with the relativistic velocity addition formula by interpreting the coordinates as velocities and by using the rapidity: :\\\\frac{\\\\sinh\\\\frac{a}{k}}{\\\\cosh\\\\frac{a}{k} }=\\\\tanh\\\\frac{a}{k}=\\\\frac{v}{c} or with a Lorentz boost by using homogeneous coordinates: :(x,\\\\ y,\\\\ x',\\\\ y')=\\\\left(\\\\frac{x_{1}}{x_{0}},\\\\ \\\\frac{x_{2}}{x_{0}},\\\\ \\\\frac{x_{1}^{\\\\prime}}{x_{0}^{\\\\prime}},\\\\ \\\\frac{x_{2}^{\\\\prime}}{x_{0}^{\\\\prime}}\\\\right) These are in fact the relations between the coordinates of Gudermann/Escherich in terms of the Beltrami‚ÄìKlein model and the Weierstrass coordinates of the hyperboloid model - this relation was pointed out by Homersham Cox (1882, p. 186),} see History of Lorentz transformations#Escherich.

The species is solely known from the early Miocene, Burdigalian stage, Dominican amber deposits on the island of Hispaniola. Protosialis casca is one of only two known alderfly species present in the West Indies, the only other species is the living Protosialis bifasciata native to Cuba. History and classification The species is known only from the holotype, number \\"Mact 2090\\", which is a single male specimen currently residing in the private collection owned by Ettore Morone of Turin, Italy, and was first studied by Michael Engel and David Grimaldi. Engel and Grimaldi's 2007 type description paper was published in the journal American Museum Novitates. The specific epithet \\"casca\\" was derived by the authors from the Latin ', which translates to \\"old\\" in reference to the age of the specimen. When first described P. casca was named Sialis (Protosialis) casca by Engel and Grimaldi. They used the alderfly classification system put forth by Dr. Michael Whiting in his 1994 paper on the phylogeny of North American alderflies which treated Protosialis as a subgenus of Sialis. Currently most taxonomists treat Protosialis as a separate genus from Sialis making this species Protosialis casca and Sialis (Protosialis) casca a synonym. Description The holotype of Protosialis casca is in length with a forewing length of between . The forewing length cannot be determined more precisely due to the apical portions of the wings being missing. The orange and black coloration of the head and pronotum combined with the reduced number of crossveins in the costal region of the forewing are unique to the genus Protosialis. The legs display black and white color patterning, with the area of the protibia and mesotibia white and the rest of the leg is black. The wing membranes are overall a dusky brownish gray, with veins a darker brow to black. The abdomen, light brown in color, is bend downwards near the midpoint and slightly distended.

The films included in airing order are Graveyard Disturbance, Until Death, The Ogre, and Dinner with a Vampire. Production In the late 1980s Italian film productions began to flounder, so director Lamberto Bava decided to make a jump to television. He struck a deal with executive producers Gianfranco Transunto and Gianlorenzo Battaglia to make a cable television series that would consist of four full-length films. The plan was to have each film have a different tone: Graveyard Disturbance and Dinner with a Vampire having a comical approach and Until Death and The Ogre having a more serious approach. All four films would be co- written by legendary Italian writer Dardano Sacchetti with music composed by Simon Boswell. Home video release The series have never been released together, but each film has been released around the world separately, sometimes released under different titles. In the United States The Ogre was the first film in the series to be released on DVD in 2003 through Media- Blasters subsidiary Shriek Show (which retitled the film Demons III: The Ogre on the DVD artwork).

It can be physical, verbal, and/or emotional. Definition The NSPCC has defined sexual bullying as \\"any bullying behaviour, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person's sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys or girls towards other boys or girls ‚Äì although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person's face, behind their back or through the use of technology.\\" The erstwhile Beatbullying organisation (now defunct) had a similar definition. It can be the use of sexual words to put someone down, like calling someone a slut, a slag, or gay, or spreading rumours about someone's alleged sex life. In its most extreme form, it can be inappropriate touching, sexual assault, or even rape. This term is primarily used in the United Kingdom and is not yet used in other areas. Definitions and descriptions of bullying and of sexual bullying can be problematic, however. Offensive terms are often deployed in a friendly way, so the context of such exchanges is very important, and adults sometimes misinterpret them. Conversely, while much sexual bullying is overt, a great deal is not, and appears to be ordinary bullying. An example of this is the teasing by tough boys of a 'geeky' boy for his academic ability. What is actually happening is that the boy is being mocked for his lack of machismo, or his lack of engagement in heterosexist banter with girls or boys. Superficially, the bullying has no sexual content, but is underpinned by the aggressors staking a claim to dominance for their 'type of boy' (See Mac An Ghaill, 1994 and Duncan, 1999). Prevalence As part of its research into sexual bullying in schools, the BBC Panorama programme commissioned a questionnaire aimed at young people aged 11‚Äì19 years in schools and youth clubs across five regions of England. The survey revealed that of the 273 young people who responded to the questionnaire, 28 had been forced to do something sexual and 31 had seen it happen to someone else. Of the 273 respondents, 40 had experienced unwanted touching. UK Government figures show that in school year 2007/8 there were 3,450 fixed period exclusions and 120 permanent exclusions from schools in England due to sexual misconduct. That equates to 19 exclusions per school day for incidents including groping and using sexually insulting language. From April 2008 to March 2009, ChildLine counselled a total of 156,729 children. Of these, 26,134 children spoke about bullying as a main concern and 300 of these talked specifically about sexual bullying. 25% of children who have attended Kidscape free ZAP anti-bullying sessions have reported some form of sexual bullying. A significant proportion of LGBT students experience homophobic and transphobic violence in school. This is shown consistently by data from Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, North America and the Pacific, with the proportion affected ranging from 16% in Nepal to 85% in the United States. LGBT students are also more likely to experience such violence at school than at home or in the community. LGBT students report a higher prevalence of violence at school than their non-LGBT peers. In New Zealand, for example, lesbian, gay and bisexual students were three times more likely to be bullied than their heterosexual peers and in Norway 15‚Äì48% of lesbian, gay and bisexual students reported being bullied compared with 7% of heterosexual students. Types of interactions A survey by the UK National Union of Teachers suggests that sexual bullying is most often carried out by boys against girls, although girls are increasingly harassing girls and boys in a sexual manner. ResearchSexual Bullying: Gender Conflict and Pupil Culture in Secondary schools, Neil Duncan, Routledge,1999 shows that sexual bullying starts at primary school level and usually takes the form of verbal insults by boys directed at girls and women through demeaning sexually abusive and aggressive language. A NUT study shows that these verbal insults are generally centred on girls' sexual status including terms such as 'bitch', 'slag', 'tart' and 'slut'. Other researchers cite similar evidence.The Great Divide: Gender in the primary school, M Clark, 1990 These incidents are typically dismissed as playful behaviour or justified through humour, however. The research also shows that boys are also subjected to a range of sexual bullying by other boys and by girls although this is said to be less obvious. The most prevalent issue is sexual verbal abuse and being called obscene names. The names that cause most offence to boys are homophobic terms and those that are associated with the 'absence' of high status masculinity. Sexual bullying can involve spreading rumours about someone's sexuality or sex life, or showing or posting sexual comments, photos, or videos, such as revenge porn. Some people, including the UK charity Beatbullying, have claimed that children are being bullied into providing 'sexual favours' in exchange for protection as gang culture enters inner city schools. Other anti-bullying groups and teachers' unions, including the National Union of Teachers, challenged the charity to provide evidence of this, as they had no evidence that this sort of behaviour was happening in schools. Associated effects and risks Bullying victimization occurs more frequently in sexual minorities than heterosexual individuals. Sexual orientation-related physical bullying significantly correlates with mental distress and symptoms of trauma. When bullying co- occurs with adverse childhood experiences (see: Adverse Childhood Experiences Study), greater lifetime health disparities and health risk behaviours appear. Bullying, especially in adolescents, can lead to depression and suicidal ideation. Bullied sexual minority females are more likely to experience depression and suicidal ideation than their sexual minority male and heterosexual counterparts. Anti-gay physical bullying, along with sexual abuse and verbal bullying, can lead to psychosocial health problems, which can be a predictor of risky sex behaviours. Men who have sex with men in the United States and Canada have a higher prevalence of HIV than any other cohort.

In her early career she was known as Loretta Clemens and in her later career she was known as Loretta Tupper She featured in numerous television commercials and was famous for playing the old lady in the Fruit of the Loom television commercials from the 1980s. She was a character on the PBS Television show Sesame Street called Mrs. Mae Trump in the 1980s. She played small roles in numerous movies.  Early career  In the early 1930s, Loretta and her brother Jack Clemens played music in a band called Loretta and Jack. They recorded a number of songs including \\"Stop! You're Breaking My Heart\\" from the album Jazz Guitar Varieties, written by Ted Koehler and Burton Lane, \\"(What Did I Do To Be So) Black and Blue\\" written by Harry Brooks and Andy Razaf and composed by Thomas \\"Fats\\" Waller, from the album Jazz Guitar Varieties and \\"Just A Little Girl\\" written by S. B. Fishburne. In the early 1930s Loretta was a member of a trio band called The Triolettes, along with Eunice Miller and Marjorie Sullivan. Radio programs Jack and Loretta Clemens also starred in The Gibson Family, an hour-long musical comedy radio series on NBC from 1934 to 1935. The program did not do well in the ratings, and in 1935 it was reworked and renamed Uncle Charlie's Tent Show. While the format had changed, many of the characters from The Gibson Family were in the new version of the show. Jack and Loretta Clemens remained on the show, playing the same characters that they played originally. Uncle Charlie's Tent Show was broadcast for less than three months before it too was canceled. From 1933 through 1939 Jack and Loretta Clemens had their own program, Jack and Loretta Clemens, a brother-sister piano-patter-and-song- duo broadcast on various networks including NBC, CBS, Blue Network and Blue.The program was 15 minutes long and was broadcast up to six times per week. Between 1934 and 1937 Loretta sang on the NBC radio program Johnny Presents. In 1936 Jack and Loretta starred in the radio program Studio 7, which aired three times a week on NBC. They played themselves in the 1937 musical film Vitaphone Frolics. Personal life, later career and awards Sometime during the 1930s Loretta married violinist, jazz musician, and big band arranger Fredrick H. Tupper who was born October 5, 1904 and died May 31, 1974. In 1942, she gave birth to her daughter, Rettadel Tupper, and decided to semi-retire from show business. She opened a talent school in Queens, New York, where she taught future stars, including Eileen Brennan. In 1969 the father of one of her students took some photos of her and sent them to some agents in New York. Shortly after that, Mrs. Tupper had her first new acting role advertising Parker Pens. After the death of her husband, she returned to show business, and appeared in numerous television commercials and small film roles. Directors nicknamed her One-Take Tupper for her ability to complete her part in just one take. In 1977 she won a Clio award for her first Fruit of the Loom commercial. She was in numerous commercials including Hertz, The New York Yankees, Midas Mufflers, Audi and Morton's Doughnuts. In 1985 she won another Clio award for her work in a commercial for the Baltimore Orioles. She worked steadily until the last two years of her life. In 1985, she had a small role as a music shop owner in Woody Allen's film The Purple Rose of Cairo. References # ^ Pancakes and Patter, by Dora Albert.

Building) is an International style skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Formerly called the Celanese Building, it was completed in 1973 as part of the Rockefeller Center extension, that started in the late 1950s with the Time- Life Building. The Celanese Corporation would later move to Dallas, Texas. Currently, 1211 is owned by Ivanho√© Cambridge. The structure has a simple slab-like shape devoid of any decoration, its prosaic fa√ßade consisting of vertical alternating limestone and glass stripes. The fa√ßade stone piers are supernumerary; there are twice as many of them as structurally necessary. The glass bands are continuous and offer no indication of floor levels. These features ably create the visual lack of scale, so the tower does not look overly bulky. Background The building was part of the later Rockefeller Center expansion (1960s-1970s) dubbed the \\"XYZ Buildings\\". Their plans were first drawn in 1963 by the Rockefeller family's architect, Wallace Harrison, of the architectural firm Harrison & Abramovitz. Their letters correspond to their height. 1251 Avenue of the Americas is the \\"X\\" Building as it is the tallest at 750 ft (229 m) and 54 stories, and was the first completed, in 1971. The \\"Y\\" is 1221 Avenue of the Americas, which was the second tower completed (1973) and is the second in height (674 ft and 51 stories). The \\"Z\\" Building, the shortest and the youngest, is 1211 Avenue of the Americas with 45 stories (592 ft). The structure is LEED certified (silver level designation) by USGBC.

Diccionario Maya, 3rd edition. Mexico, DF: Editorial Porrua, S. A. The current name of the site is believed to be relatively modern, but its origin has resisted attempts to be traced. History Ka ºKabish is believed to have been initially occupied during the Maya Late Pre-Classic Period (ca. 400 BCE- 200 CE) with one temple securely dated to this time and a second tentatively dated to this period.Haines, Helen R. 2008. \\"Causeway Terminus, Minor Centre, Elite Refuge, or Ritual Capital? Ka ºKabish, A New Puzzle on the Ancient Maya Landscape of North-Central Belize\\". In Research Reports in Belizean Archaeology Volume 5. Institute of Archaeology, NICH, Belize Material recovered from the tops of some of the buildings suggest that the city was in use at least until end of the Classic Period (900 CE), while evidence from the residential zone surrounding the city indicates a thriving occupation as late as the end of the Early Post-Classic Period (1200 CE). Site description The site has only recently become the focus of intensive investigation. A mid-1990s study of the site core revealed a total of 27 monumental structures arranged around two plazas, a subsequent study increased the number of structures to 55. Within several of these structures the looted remains of tombs belonging to high status, possibly royal individuals, were discovered. One of these tombs was found to have possessed painted glyphs. The style is part of a tradition of painted tombs first noted at Rio Azul in Northern Guatemala.Adams, Richard E.W. 1999 Rio Azul: An Ancient Maya City. University of Oklahoma Press, Norman. Archaeological Investigations Ka ºKabish was first visited by David M. Pendergast of the Royal Ontario Museum while he was working at the nearby site of Lamanai, although the lack of a reliable road made work at the site unfeasible at that time. What was noted at the time was the evidence of wholesale illicit excavations, in which virtually every structure had been looted.Pendergast, David M. 1991 \\"And the Loot Goes On: Winning Some Battles, But Not the War.\\" Journal of Field Archaeology, vol. 18:89-95. The site was identified initially for potential study in 1990 by members of the Maya Research Program. Due to potentially dangerous conditions in the area, a team did not return to Ka ºKabish until 1995, when formative mapping and surveying of the site was conducted.Guderjan, Thomas H. 1996. \\"Kakabish: Mapping of a Maya Center\\". In Archaeological Research at Blue Creek, Belize. Progress Report of the Fourth (1995) Field Season, edited by T. H. Guderjan, W. D. Driver and H. R. Haines, pp. 117-120. Maya Research Program, St. Mary's University, San Antonio. Dr. Helen R. Haines (TUARC, Trent University) began establishing the groundwork for the Ka ºKabish Archaeological Research Project (KARP) in 2005, with the permission of Belize's Institute of Archeology, a branch of the National Institute of Culture and History (NICH). KARP's first field season was 2007, with a focus on clearing vegetation from, and remapping, the site's South Complex. The North Complex of the site was remapped in 2009. Since its inception, the Ka ºKabish Archaeological Research Project has expended efforts on mapping the site to gain an understanding of the extent of the site and the types of buildings present. Knowledge of the architectural arrangements provides significant clues as to the importance of the site and the role it might have played in the larger Maya political landscape. Under a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, first excavations at Ka ºKabish began in 2010 and have continued in the intervening years, with excavation seasons in 2011, 2013, and 2015. As of 2013, survey and excavations have located 90 structures, located in 8 groups. Architectural features include two major temples, a ball court with circular ball court marker, and several large platforms (or range buildings) that likely served as royal or high status elite residences and/or administrative structures. Research has also been conducted on the numerous chultuns located at Ka ºKabish. Fundraising and Purchase Previously, the site sustained damage during the construction of the Indian Church to San Filipe Road, and two buildings were removed and their limestone material used for road fill for the road. Looting has also been a problem, and several structures have been destabilized through looter's trenches.Tremain, Cara G. (2011) Investigations in Looters' Trenches at Ka ºKabish, Northern Belize: An Analysis of Ancient Maya Architecture and Construction Practices (M.A. thesis.) Trent University. Until 2015, the land on which the site is located was administered by the San Filipe Land Committee, and was owned by three different landowners. Though the owners were supportive of archaeological research, Ka ºKabish was in danger due to encroaching agricultural expansion. This prompted an attempt to purchase the land and, under the auspices of NICH, establish Ka ºKabish as a National Park. A fundraising campaign raised $20,030 CND of a needed $70,000 CND, providing enough money to make a down payment on the site in July 2015. The funds for the campaign were managed by Trent University, and the land was successfully removed from the Agricultural Land Registry. Fieldschool In 2013, field school credit for college archaeological students began being offered via Trent University. Students participating in the field school stay in the village of Indian Church during their time with the project.

Whilst there are 17 white horse hill figures in England, with nine being nearby in Wiltshire, this is the only example in Hampshire. The horse was constructed crudely of rough flints, painted white and pushed into the ground to form the shape of the horse. The earliest documentation of the horse is in 1846. The horse for many years was covered by the surrounding bushes but in 1999, the site was cleared so the horse become visible again. There was also a hill figure of a cross nearby only a few yards from Winchester Road, constructed using the same method. This was lost in 1944.

Compass Centre is alongside but slightly askew from Heathrow's northern runway, with the Northern Perimeter Road, T5 Long Stay car park and Compass Centre car park between the runway and the Compass Centre. In 1995 Penny McGuire of The Architectural Review said that \\"Its shining glass and bright blue clad exterior reminds you, particularly when seen glowing at night, that one of the largest and busiest airports in the world is otherwise encumbered with a really grim collection of buildings. Decent ones are a rare sight around here.\\" It was designed to house up to 800 British Airways employees. British Airways wanted a large, on-airport facility close to its operations, so it decided to use the Compass Centre. Compass Centre consists of a linear arrangement of three blocks. Each block is serviced independently and has a glass atrium with glass links in between. The design stems from a client's request for a building that could be easily divided between tenants. The building can accommodate sub-letting and flexibility involving several tenants. Reinforced concrete was used to construct the structural frame due to economy, fire resistance, and speed. The frame has a raked roof slab and circular columns. Glass was the primary material used to construct the shell, because glass has little radar interference, and in the words of McGuire, can be \\"acoustically efficient.\\" The design limits heat gain and solar glare, and the building environment is sound-proofed.

(born Philip Roux; 6 August 1883 - 24 October 1962) was Catholic priest and church architect. Although he was educated as a Belgian Oblate (Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate), he is remembered for his work in Canada with the Eastern Catholic Ukrainian Canadian community building over forty Byzantine Rite churches and several grottos in a unique architectural style that mixed Byzantine, Latin, and modern Canadian influences. The style is often called prairie cathedral, which is a common nickname for several of his churches, even though only two of them are properly cathedrals. The Ukrainian Catholic Church of the Immaculate Conception in the Rural Municipality of Springfield, Manitoba was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1996 as being one of Ruh's most accomplished works. Priesthood Ruh was born in Bickenholtz, Alsace- Lorraine [then part of the German Empire], to poor parents. When he wasn't at school, he worked in the fields. In his autobiography written two years before his death, he wrote, \\"There was no time for play except on Sundays after Mass.\\" After leaving school, he worked in the fields until deciding to become a priest. He joined the priesthood in the Oblates order in 1898 and he moved to the Netherlands for training. After completing his novitiate, he studied for another six years in Germany. Then he was sent to be the Oblate missionary to the Ukrainian Catholic immigrants in Canada. Ruh knew nothing about Ukrainians except that they were a Slavic nation. He received additional training in the Ukrainian language and the Eastern Rite. Ruh had his first experience in architecture when he received an assignment to design a path up a hill and a play field for schoolchildren. Ruh received two more years of training before he was sent to Canada; he arrived in April 1913. There were few clergy for almost 250,000 Ukrainians. Ruh arrived at his new home at the village of Stry, north of the North Saskatchewan River. He remained there until his death at St. Boniface, Manitoba, aged 79.

Tade (March 15, 1883 ‚Äì January 5, 1961) was a provincial politician from Alberta, Canada. He briefly served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta twice. The first time briefly in 1935 and the second time from 1938 to 1940 sitting with the Social Credit caucus in government both times. Political career Tade ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature in the 1935 Alberta general election. He stood as a Social Credit candidate in the electoral district of Athabasca. Tade defeated incumbent Frank Falconer and another candidate with a solid majority to pick up the seat for his party, the election saw Social Credit sweep to power to form government. Shortly after the election Premier William Aberhart appointed his cabinet. He needed a seat for himself and the new Minister of Lands and Mines Charles Ross. Tade decided to resign his seat on October 8, 1935 along with William Morrison. Aberhart wanted Ross to hold a northern seat to deal quell complaints about lack of cabinet representation in the northern part of the province despite the fact that Ross was from Calgary. The decision to resign became a controversy after allegations were made that Tade was forced to resign his seat. After resigning his seat Tade was made President of the Social Credit Party. Charles Ross died a few years after being elected forcing a by-election again in Athabasca. Social Credit had asked prominent Liberal James Cornwall to run under the Social Credit banner to which he refused. Tade also sought out the nomination but his candidacy was initially refused because the government believed that he would not be able to command any support. A hotly contested nomination race ensued between Tade and Reed Dorry whom the Social Credit party felt to be a Communist and had the backing of 150 supporters. Tade was chosen as the candidate by members of the selection committee on October 18, 1938 at a meeting held in his home town of Colinton, Alberta. In the by-election campaign Tade won the two race with a solid margin of victory on November 7, 1938 to return to the Legislature. The early results from the northern part of the riding in the race initially had Liberal candidate Whitley leading by a very close margin. The southern results put Tade in the lead and allowed him to win. Tade ran for the nomination to run as the Social Credit candidate again in the 1940 Alberta general election. He was defeated by Gordon Lee who was the returning officer in the 1938 by-election. Tade retired from the legislature at dissolution of the assembly in 1940 rather than seeking re-election as an Independent. Upon declining health, Tade and his wife moved to Penticton, British Columbia in the early 1950s. His wife, Edna Tade died there late in the 1950s and Clarence moved to live with his daughter in California, dying there in 1961.

He was born in Gibeon; Hendrik Witbooi was his grandfather. He was selected to be the successor of his uncle David Witbooi who died in 1955. Together with Hosea Kutako, Samuel Witbooi was involved in the drafting of a petition to the United Nations in 1947 to put Namibia under British trusteeship. The petition was signed at the occasion of the 1947 Herero Day gathering and subsequently presented to the UN by Reverend Michael Scott, because neither Kutako nor Witbooi were allowed to leave South-West African territory. In 1956, Witbooi addressed the UN again, \\"on behalf of the non-European inhabitants of SWA\\". The results were that the UN rejected a request to divide South-West Africa and allocate its southern parts permanently to South Africa. They also extended their own mandate on South-West Africa for one more year. Witbooi was a strong opponent of the South African system of Bantu Education which deprived black learners of an appropriate access to education. He then established the African Methodist Episcopal Church Private School which used English as medium of instruction. He was a strong opponent of the South African Homeland policy. Furthermore, he aggressively opposed the enforced resettlement of the «ÉGami-«Çnun (Bondelswarts) from the Warmbad area to Gibeon. Throughout November 1967 he advised the «ÉGami-«Çnun in Warmbad to reject any South African resettlement plans. Witbooi joined SWAPO in 1977 but died not long after that, in 1978. Hendrik Witbooi, Jr. succeeded him as chief of the «ÄKhowesin. Hendrik Samuel Witbooi is regarded a hero of the Namibian struggle for independence. He is known for the quote > \\"I don't want to possess a part of our country ‚Äî I want to have the whole > Namibia.\\" which resulted in a criminal charge laid against him by the South African administration.

However, molecular analysis showed in 2004 that these two varieties of truffle are one species. The differences between them are therefore likely due to environmental factors.Hall et al., 61-63Paolocci et al. This article uses the older of the two binomial names, T. aestivum, to designate the species,As recommended by Hall et al., 63. while discussing the characteristics of the two varieties separately. Burgundy truffles Burgundy truffles (; or scorzone, \\"bark\\"; ; ), have an intense, hazelnut-like aroma and are highly prized for their gastronomic qualities. They are used in the haute cuisine of France and Italy, as well as a substitute for the P√©rigord black truffle (T. melanosporum). Like other truffles, they are also canned and bottled for export. With bodies (ascocarps) from in diameter, burgundy truffles are relatively large. Their brown or black outer skin (peridium) forms pyramidal warts about wide, resembling rough bark. Burgundy truffles are harvested from September to late December, sometimes also until late January. They have a wider distribution than any other truffle species. Burgundy truffles are found across Europe, from Spain to eastern Europe and from Sweden to North Africa. In France they are found mainly in the north-east and in Italy, in the north. In the United Kingdom they were plentiful prior to the 20th century, but are now rare. Their distribution may not yet be definitively established: there are as of 2007 unconfirmed reports of findings in China. Summer truffles The flavor, size and color of summer truffles () is similar to that of burgundy truffles, but their aroma is less intense and the flesh (gleba) is a paler hazel color. As their name suggests, summer truffles are harvested earlier than burgundy truffles, from May to August. They are most often found in the southern part of the distribution area of the species, notably in the Mediterranean climate areas of France, Italy and Spain.

Plot summary  While driving back from a seaside holiday, a young man discovers that a camera has dropped mysteriously into his car. When he develops the negatives, one of the pictures appears to show a murder taking place while the others offer clues to where the event has taken place.

Most such films were cheaply made supporting features which became known as \\"quota quickies\\". Hagen's Twickenham company developed a reputation as a leading producer of popular quota quickies. The film's director, Bernard Vorhaus, had arrived in Britain from America in 1930 and established himself as a director of quota films in Britain's rapidly growing film industry.Richards p.185-188 His films became notable for featuring rapid editing (he often used the young David Lean as editor, who claimed that Vorhaus was a major early influence on him) and location shooting, both of which were relatively rare for supporting films. Reception The film premi√®red in September 1933 at MGM's flagship Empire Cinema in Leicester Square as the supporting feature on a double bill headed by Turn Back the Clock.

Mobile phones can be recycled at the end of their life. Rapid technology change, low initial cost, and even planned obsolescence have resulted in a fast-growing surplus, which contributes to the increasing amount of electronic waste around the globe. Recyclers consider electronic waste a \\"rapidly expanding\\" issue. In In the United States, an estimated 70% of heavy metals in landfills comes from discarded electronics, while electronic waste represents only 2% of America's trash in landfills. Mobile phones are \\"considered hazardous waste\\" in California; many chemicals in such phones leach from landfills into the groundwater system. Environmental advocacy group Greenpeace claims that the soldering of the iPhone battery into its handset hinders its being recycled. It also states that its scientists found toxic phthalates on iPhone cables, and it holds that this contravenes California's Proposition 65, which requires warning labels on products exposing consumers to phthalates. Because the U.S. has not ratified the Basel Convention or its Ban Amendment, and has no domestic laws forbidding the export of toxic waste, the Basel Action Network estimates that about 80% of the electronic waste directed to recycling in the U.S. does not get recycled there at all, but is put on container ships and sent to countries such as China. Guiyu in the Shantou region of China, and Delhi and Bangalore in India, have electronic waste processing areas. Recycling Humans toss millions of cell phones each year in favor of newer technology‚Äîand all those discarded phones may be taking a toll on the environment. Electronic scrap accounts for 70% of the overall toxic waste currently found in landfills in the U.S.A. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 141 million mobile phones were discarded in 2009 and only 12 million of those were collected for recycling. A cell phone's shelf life is only about 24 months for the average user. This means that newer cell phone models are constantly put up on the market to replace older ones. This is as a result of the rapid progression of technology in the mobile industry. According to Matt Ployhar of Intel, the industry is rapidly evolving, possibly even at ‚ÄúMoore's law pace or faster.‚Äù This means that newer cell phone models are continually on the rise of consumerism and more outdated models are likely to end up in landfills. Most cell phones contain precious metals and plastics that can be recycled to save energy and resources that would otherwise be required to mine or manufacture. When placed in a landfill, these materials can pollute the air and contaminate soil and drinking water. Cell phone coatings are typically made of lead, which is a toxic chemical that can result in adverse health effects when exposed to it in high levels. The circuit board on cell phones can be made of copper, gold, lead, zinc, beryllium, tantalum, coltan, and other raw materials that would require significant resources to mine and manufacture. This is why it is important to recycle old cell phones and source these increasingly scarce materials whenever possible. Electronic waste (e-waste) is a global problem; especially since many developed countries, including the U.S., ship their discarded electronic devices to less developed parts of the world. Oftentimes, the e-waste is improperly dismantled and burned, producing toxic emissions harmful to waste site workers, children, and nearby communities. Therefore, it is important for cell phone users to dispose of and recycle their devices responsibly and ethically. Global impact Mobile phones currently pose a huge problem for numerous countries around the world. Manufacturers and agencies are slowly adapting new programs in an effort to curtail the amount of waste that has been rising over the years. = Australia = Australia currently has a national recycling program that was established under the name of MobileMuster. This program originated in 1998 after a successful recycling trial in one of their states. Currently, its main focus is centered around mobile phones, batteries and any related accessories. They collaborate with over 1,400 retailers, local councils, government agencies and businesses in their recycling efforts. In 2005 MobileMuster launched a campaign that gathered statistical data showing 46% of the Australian population was aware of the option to recycle their mobile devices and its accessories. The greatest benefit that arose from this research was the simple fact that raising public awareness of a recycling program actually lead to a large spike in the number of devices being recycled. In March 2006, awareness had increased to 54%. By the end of June more than 590,000 devices and 1.5 million batteries had been collected by MobileMuster. This amounts to roughly 367 tons of material, which is the equivalent to a 16% increase in the number of devices over the span of a year. Today, they are placing a heavy emphasis on not only recycling phones but rather reusing them. The reasoning behind this is that reusing leads to a decreased amount of resources being extracted from the environment, therefore minimizing the impact. = North America = It was originally predicted that volumes for the US mobile phone recycling industry would see a notable increase until at least 2019, due to an upturn in mobile phone ownership and therefore a larger base of phones would be available for recycling.US phone recycling industry 'poised for growth' , Recycling International, August 28, 2014, Editorial Staff However the amount of ownership has succeeded most historic industry expectations - approximately 150 million mobile phones are discarded each year in the USA. Approximately 17 tonnes of copper and 0.3 tonnes of silver can be recovered per 1 million devices recycled. A 'marginal' amount of gold and palladium can also be extracted. A report released in early 2014 found that when it comes to mobile phone recycling programs, cash is the single biggest incentive for consumers in recycling phones.Cell Phone Recycling Revenue to Increase, Environmental Leader, August 26, 2014 As more people became aware of the monetary value of their old cell phones and other small electronics such as tablets, comparison websites showing users the latest buying prices grew in popularity. The first cell phone buying comparison website to launch in North America SellMyCellPhones.com launched in 2010 and is still allowing users to sell their devices to trusted buyers today. The first mobile phone recycling company in the U.S. was ReCellular, which was founded in 1991 when there were only 16 million mobile subscribers worldwide; it went bankrupt in 2013.https://www.mlive.com/business/ann- arbor/2013/12/recellular_sells_to_texas-base.html = United Kingdom = Both the United Kingdom and mainland Europe have a significant problem with e-waste. Researchers at Plymouth Universityhttps://www.plymouth.ac.uk/news/scientists-use-a-blender-to-reveal- whats-in-our-smartphones found that for each mobile phone produced, 15kg of ore needs to be mined, including 7kg of high-grade gold ore, 1kg of typical copper ore, 750g of typical tungsten ore and 200g of typical nickel ore. In the UK, only around 12% of all mobile phones that have been sold have gone on to be recycledhttps://www.sellcompare.co.uk/apple/phonehttps://www.apple.com/jp/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Responsibility_Report_2019.pdf.  Value of recycling  Mobile phones have value well after their intended use. Yet the value of these phones to recyclers is marginal and relies on high volume to become profitable. The economic value of recycled cell phones is split into two categories; refurbished units that are resold to end users and phones that have no value to retail consumers that are recycled for their precious metals. The University of California Santa Barbara published a study in 2010 on the subject called, \\"Economics of Cell Phone Reuse and Recycling\\" that states the value of reused and recycled cell phones. In 2006, according to the study the average cost for U.S. cell phone refurbishers ReCellular, PaceButler and RMS was $2.10 while the average revenue from said phones was $17. Of the two recycling methods, refurbishment of cell phones is significantly more profitable than recycling the internal parts. The study also describes the value of all precious metals inside of cell phones as well as the cost of extracting said metals. The average cost in 2006 to extract the precious metals for the U.S. cell phone recycling company ECS Refining was $.18 while the average revenue from the recycled metals was $.75.\\"End-of-Life Management of Cell Phones in the United States\\" With a profit margin significantly smaller than refurbished units, this method of gaining economic value from the recycling of cell phones is significantly more volume dependent. The most valuable precious metal in cell phones is Gold which is used in the unit's microprocessor. This precious metals percentage of the total mass of phones has constantly decreased over time. From 1992 to 2006, gold as a percentage of total mass of cell phones dropped from .06% to .03%.Else (2003) Internal documents. Else Refining & Recycling Ltd., Shefford There is a significant amount of volume in the U.S. market with Americans in 2009 throwing away on average 350,000 cell phones a day but with thinning margins, volume starts to become irrelevant. Therefore, the economic incentive for recycling the precious metals in cell phones is decreasing in the United States as manufacturers look for more cost effective ways to produce cell phones. Refurbishing and reselling cell phones continues to be the most economically viable option for recycling this form of e-waste.

He composed roughly 25 tunes in the Irish traditional style. Although his mother Brigid Flynn played the concertina and fiddle, Martin, the youngest of her ten children, was the only one to become a musician. He began his study of music at the age of nine. From a violin player in the neighboring town of Glin, he learned the rudiments of the fiddle and how to read and write music; from his mother he learned the Irish traditional style. His early repertoire was learned both from written sources such as the Roche Collection of Traditional Irish Music, Ker, and O'Neill's 1001, and from local musicians. In 1940 at age 17, he joined the Irish Army. After his discharge, he played with Meade's Dance Band in Glin. In 1951 he emigrated to Northampton, England; there he married Olive McEvoy from County Offaly, with whom he had his four children, Brendan, Brian, Gail, and Dawn. Mulvihill continued playing music during this time, expanding his skills to include button accordion and piano accordion. The latter became his main instrument for several years. In 1971 the Mulvihill family relocated to New York City. He began teaching music lessons part-time, but as his reputation grew this quickly became his full- time occupation. He taught in Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and New York. Former students include Eileen Ivers,Profile of Eileen Ivers Mary Rafferty (of Cherish the Ladies), Willie Kelly, and Patrick Clifford. In 1984, Mulvihill was honored with a NEA National Heritage Fellowship. In 1986, he self- published a songbook titled First Collection of Traditional Irish Music.

On the other hand, the continent experienced a tough agricultural crisis at the beginning of 2008.Poverty Declines Slightly in Latin America and the Caribbean, in Spite of Global Financial Crisis, ECLAC Notes N¬∫ 59 (9 December 2008) Food prices have increased a lot, due to a lack of arable land. One of the main reasons for the loss of agricultural land was the high value offered by the production of biofuels. However, second generation biofuel processes is slowly being implemented in order to extend the amount of biofuel that can be produced sustainably by using biomass consisting of the residual non-food parts of current crops, such as stems, leaves and husks. Other crops that are not used for food purposes (non food crops), such as switchgrass, grass, jatropha, whole crop maize, and miscanthus could be used to produce biofuels without starving the population that are dependent on food products. Industry waste products (i.e., woodchips, skins and pulp) from fruit pressing would also replace the need to waste arable land for biofuels; possibly improving the South American economy. Food prices, rising since 2002, ascended from 2006, reaching a peak during the first quarter of 2008. In one year the average price of food rose by about 50%. Then South American countries were affected by both the global slowdown and the decrease in food prices due to the declining demand. In June 2008, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) declared it expected a 4% growth for 2009. However at the end of the year it predicted that the year 2009 would put an end to six years of prosperity during which Latin America has benefited from high raw material prices. Production in the region is likely to decline and unemployment to increase. However, the Center for Economic and Policy Research has estimated that the region may be able to cope with the global downturn with the right macro-economic policies, as these countries no longer depend on the U.S. economy. Countries =Brazil= While previously thought immune to the global financial crisis, the economy of Brazil shrank 3.5% in the fourth quarter of 2008, with industrial production in January 2009, 17.2% below that of January 2008. Growth for 2008 as a whole was 5.1%.

The country has been seeing slower economic growth recently, seeing its growth rate forecast reduced from nearly 7% in 2008 to 0% in 2009, and due to the steep drop in commodities prices, plus a long, damaging drought in the farm provinces, local economists believe the country may fall into recession. To combat the effects of the financial crisis, the government announced a $32 billion stimulus package that is intended to create some 380,000 jobs and favor small and medium-sized businesses, with investment in infrastructure, gas pipelines and electricity generators, as well as the completion by 2010 of a new nuclear power plant. However, former President N√©stor Kirchner, the husband of the current president, Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner and leader of the ruling Justicialist Party, said in a speech on February 17, 2009, that due to the international crisis, Argentina in 2009 will face \\"the most difficult year in the last century.\\" =Ecuador= Ecuador is seeking ways to default on sovereign debts incurred under the government of Gustavo Noboa, which the present government deems to have been incurred illegally.Ecuador renews default threats If Ecuador defaults, it will be the first developing country to default on sovereign debt since the crisis began.Stratfor.com homepage, December 5, 2008 =Caribbean Islands= The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said as soon as February 2008 that a U.S. slowdown would hurt the economies of the Caribbean Islands, especially those in the Eastern Islands. Indeed, the tourism sector makes up a large part of the Islands' economies, so that they are heavily dependent on the number of U.S. visitors each year. However, the lower inflation and currency depreciation in several Latin American and Caribbean nations can have offset this impact of the financial crisis, sustaining the activity.

This commonly comes up due to the standard practice (in English and many other languages) of automatically capitalizing the first word of a sentence. It can also arise in badly cased or noncased text (for example, all-lowercase or all- uppercase text messages). Truecasing is unnecessary in languages whose scripts do not have a distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters. This includes all languages not written in the Latin, Greek, Cyrillic or Armenian alphabets, such as Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Hebrew, Arabic, Hindi, and Georgian. Techniques * Sentence segmentation can be used to determine where sentences begin, to implement the rule that the first word of every sentence must be capitalized. * Part-of-speech tagging can be used to identify proper nouns, which must be capitalized. In some cases, the same word can be used as different parts of speech, and is capitalized differently. For example, Xerox the company, as a noun, is capitalized, but to xerox a document, as a verb, is not capitalized. A xerox, as in the copy of a document, can be recognized by the presence of a determiner, which is not used for proper nouns. * Named entity recognition can be used to identify proper nouns, which must be capitalized. * A spell checker can be used to identify words that are always capitalized. Applications Truecasing aids in other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition, automatic content extraction, and machine translation. Proper capitalization allows easier detection of proper nouns, which are the starting points of NER and ACE. Some translation systems use statistical machine learning techniques, which could make use of the information contained in capitalization to increase accuracy.

Biography Synadenos appears in 1276/1277, when, along with the megas konostaulos Michael Kaballarios, he led an army against the independent ruler of Thessaly, John I Doukas. The Byzantine army was routed at the Battle of Pharsalus, and Synadenos himself was captured, while Kaballarios was killed whilst trying to escape.... He was released or ransomed from captivity, and in 1281 he participated in the campaign against the Angevins in Albania which led to the Byzantine victory at Berat.; . Finally, in 1283, he participated in another campaign against John Doukas, under Michael Tarchaneiotes. Eventually, Synadenos retired to a monastery with the monastic name Joachim. After his death (sometime between 1310 and 1328), his wife, Theodora Palaiologina, the daughter of Constantine Palaiologos, the half-brother of Michael VIII, became a nun with the name Theodoule, and founded the Convent of the Mother of God Bebaia Elpis (\\"Certain Hope\\") in Constantinople.

History Lazarus Hallgarten arrived in the United States in 1849. His initial activity was as a note and exchange broker opening an office at 20 Exchange Place in 1850. This yielded a moderate income and enabled him to start as a banker.American Jewish history: the colonial and early national periods ..., Volume 2 By Jeffrey S. Gurock, American Jewish Historical Society page 71, Initially the firm was called Hallgarten & Herzfeld (the other partners being Joseph Herzfeld, Samuel Neustadt, William Rosenheim and Hallgarten's two sons), which eventually became Hallgarten & Co. from January 1, 1867 after Herzfeld retired. After 1865 the firm developed into a stock and bond dealing house. The founder maintained his connections back in Europe and cultivated the flow of German capital into American railroad investments in the post-Civil War era.The history of foreign investment in the United States to 1914 By Mira Wilkins Lazarus Hallgarten died in 1875, and Rosenheim and Neustadt left the partnership. Both retiring partners returned to Germany with Rosenheim (who was married to Maria Hallgarten - daughter of L. Hallgarten) founding Wilhelm Rosenheim & Company in Berlin and Neustadt founding Gebruder Neustadt in Frankfurt. Two of the three sons of Lazarus carried on the New York business with new partners (Bernhard Mainzer and Sigmund Neustadt - Samuel's son).History of Hallgarten & Co 1850-1950, unpublished One of these sons was Julius Hallgarten (founder of the Hallgarten Prize at the National Academy of Design), who died in Davos, Switzerland in 1883,New York Times January 10, 1884 while the other was Charles Hallgarten (Karl Lazarus Hallgarten) who died in Frankfurt am Main in 1908. The firm became a member of the New York Stock Exchange on January 1, 1881. \\"Our Crowd\\" The firm was part of the interlinked group of Wall Street investment banks that had been founded in the second half of the 19th century by German-Jewish bankers,Our Crowd by Stephen Birmingham, Harper & Row 1967 pgs 9-11 sometimes known as the Our Crowd bankers. The group included such firms as Bache & Co., Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, J. & W. Seligman & Co. and Kuhn Loeb. The \\"Our Crowd\\" firms were tightly intermeshed by marriage. As Stephen Birmingham notes in his book ‚ÄúOur Crowd‚Äù: ‚ÄúAt Hallgarten & Company four principal partners Charles Hallgarten, Bernard Mainzer, Casimir Stralem, and Sigmund Neustadt were similarly intertwined: Hallgarten married to Mainzer's sister, and Stralem married to Neustadt's daughters. Heidelbach, Ickelheimer & Company was founded, in 1876, as the result of a marriage, when Isaac Ickelheimer married Philip Heidelbach's daughter. At a Westchester party recently, a Klingenstein, related to Lehmans, and a Kempner, related to Loebs, were asked if they weren't also related to each other. \\"I suppose so\\" was the reply\\". The firm was also connected to Wertheim & Co., whose founder Maurice Wertheim had originally been a Hallgarten partner. After the Hallgarten family faded from the scene the firm‚Äôs fortunes were intertwined to the aforementioned Stralem family. Casimir I. Stralem (1886‚Äì1932), of 14 East 82nd Street, New York, was for a long time the chief partner in the firm, while his wife, Edith, was the daughter of another partner, Sigmund Neustadt. Their son was Donald S. Stralem (1903‚Äì1976) who became a Hallgarten partner in 1932. His wife was Jean Ickelheimer (1908‚Äì1994), a philanthropist and art collector (owning works by Picasso, Matisse, Degas and Renoir). She was a granddaughter of the banker Philip Lehman.London, Christie's Catalogue, 13.XII.1984, Donald S. Stralem was also noted as a prominent book collector. His daughter, Sandra, married Robert Russell who was also a partner at Hallgarten from 1950 until 1966, when Stralem and Russell left to start a new investment bank, Stralem & Company, which still exists today as an asset management firm in New York. Donald's brother, Pierre Stralem (known as Pete, 1911‚Äì1997) became a partner in 1942 and carried on with the firm into its later merged state. Another partner of note was Arthur Zankel, the philanthropist (for whom the Zankel Recital Hall at the Carnegie Hall is named) who at the start of his career was a general partner of Hallgarten & Company from 1953 until 1965.UPenn Alumni Obituaries, 2006 International Finance Pioneer The bank had close relations with German financial institutions. In 1904, the , which was active in the sale of American securities in Germany had two partners at Hallgarten & Company in New York. Hallgarten & Company claimed to be the first New York Stock Exchange firm to open an office in London. This occurred in 1912. In 1968, it was the first US firm to request membership of the London Stock Exchange. In a controversial (and close) vote by the Admissions Committee it was turned down due to the Stock Exchange wishing to restrict US competitors from that market. In January 1926, Hallgarten took over the firm of Boissevain & Company (including its Amsterdam office). This was a banking firm facilitating transactions between the US and the Netherlands. Hallgarten had its offices from 1922 until 1941 at 40-44 Pine Street (a ten-story building it owned). The Pine Street building was demolished in 1960 to build the One Chase Manhattan Plaza. However the firm had moved out in 1941 to the seventh and eight floors at 44 Wall Street. The firm remained in the top rank of Wall Street firms right through to the 1970s. At its apogee it had offices in Chicago, London, Paris, Geneva and Brussels. It had also maintained offices in Amsterdam, Rome and Berlin earlier in the 20th Century. It was never a mass- market firm and had a somewhat exclusive private clientele in addition to its investment banking functions. The Merger Hallgarten & Company was eventually merged into Moseley Hallgarten & Estabrook in early 1974,Mergers and acquisitions: issues from the mid-century merger wave By Michael Keenan, Lawrence J. White, pg 307-310 which had its headquarters in Boston. The other component firm was F.S. Moseley, a long-established Boston firm founded by Frederick Strong Moseley in 1879. Shortly thereafter Weeden & Company and C.B. Richard Ellis (no connection to the realtors of exactly the same name) were merged into the structure. The holding company for this whole structure was Moseley Securities Corporation which had its stock listed on the NYSE. Financial problems beset the firm in the 1980s, particularly in relation to the Crash of Black Monday (1987). Shortly thereafter, in November 1987, Moseley Hallgarten & Estabrook announced it would quit the retail broking component of its operations. During 1987, the retail brokerage unit with 30 offices provided just under half of the firm's revenues. About 325 of the firm's 870 employees were retail brokers. In November 1987 the company signed a letter of intent providing for the acquisition by Gruntal & Co. of selected assets of Moseley, including its retail securities brokerage business and related assets, and its investment advisory business, for approximately $15 million in cash.PR Newswire Article date:November 9, 1987 This deal fell through and then the company negotiated a sale of its retail business to both Gruntal & Co. and Fahnestock.The Boston Globe (Boston, MA) Article dated February 2, 1988 The plan was that Moseley would remain an institutional brokerage but difficult trading conditions and its connections to the so- called Wedtech scandal (the IPO of which it has underwritten)Thinking about political corruption by Peter DeLeon.

The majority of the population of Northern Ireland wanted to remain within the United Kingdom (see unionism and loyalism). Most of these were the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain. Literature of Northern Ireland includes literature written in Northern Ireland, and in that part of Ireland prior to 1922, as well as literature written by writers born in Northern Ireland who emigrated. It includes literature in English, Irish and Ulster Scots. The impact of Irish nationalism that led to the partition of the island of Ireland in 1921 means that literature of the Republic of Ireland is not considered to be British ‚Äì although the identity of literature from Northern Ireland, as part of the literature of the United Kingdom, may fall within the overlapping identities of Irish and British literature where \\"the naming of the territory has always been, in literary, geographical or historical contexts, a politically charged activity\\". Writing from Northern Ireland has been described as existing in a \\"double post-colonial condition\\"Ulster-Scots Writing, ed. Ferguson, Dublin 2008 being viewed as not British enough, not Irish enough, and (for writings in Scots) not Scottish enough to be included in consideration within the various national canons. The identity of literature of Northern Ireland is as contested as the identity of Northern Ireland itself, but Northern Ireland writers have contributed to Irish, British and other literatures as well as reflecting the changing character of Northern Ireland society. As Tom Paulin put it, it should be possible \\"to found a national literature on this scutching vernacular\\". Literature of this part of Ireland before 1922 Irish language literature was the predominant literature in the pre-Plantation period. The Ulster Cycle is pertinent to the history of literature in the territory of present-day Northern Ireland. Ulster Scots literature first followed models from Scotland, with the rhyming weavers, such as James Orr, developing an indigenous tradition of vernacular literature. Writers in the counties which now form Northern Ireland participated in the Gaelic Revival. =Literature in English= Though the books of Forrest Reid (1875‚Äì1947) are not necessarily well known today, he has been labelled 'the first Ulster novelist of European stature', and comparisons have been drawn between his own coming of age novel of Protestant Belfast, Following Darkness (1912), and James Joyce's seminal novel of growing up in Catholic Dublin, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916). Reid's fiction, which often uses submerged narratives to explore male beauty and love, can be placed within the historical context of the emergence of a more explicit expression of homosexuality in English literature in the 20th century. =Literature in Irish= Poetry in Irish by Robert McAdam (1808‚Äì1895) in paving, Writers' Square, Belfast \\"The Blackbird of Belfast Lough\\", a fragment of syllabic verse probably dating from the 9th century, has inspired reinterpretations and translations in modern times. The blackbird serves as symbol for the Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry at Queen's University, Belfast. The Annals of Ulster () cover years from AD 431 to AD 1540 and were compiled in the territory of what is now Northern Ireland: entries up to AD 1489 were compiled in the late 15th century by the scribe Ruaidhr√≠ √ì Luin√≠n, under his patron Cathal √ìg Mac Maghnusa on the island of Belle Isle on Lough Erne. The Ulster Cycle written in the 12th century, is a body of medieval Irish heroic legends and sagas of the traditional heroes of the Ulaid in what is now eastern Ulster and northern Leinster, particularly counties Armagh, Down and Louth. The stories are written in Old and Middle Irish, mostly in prose, interspersed with occasional verse passages. The language of the earliest stories is dateable to the 8th century, and events and characters are referred to in poems dating to the 7th.Garret Olmsted, \\"The Earliest Narrative Version of the T√°in: Seventh-century poetic references to T√°in b√≥ C√∫ailnge\\", Emania 10, 1992, pp. 5‚Äì17 =Literature in Latin= The Book of Armagh is a 9th-century illuminated manuscript written mainly in Latin, containing early texts relating to St Patrick and some of the oldest surviving specimens of Old Irish. It is one of the earliest manuscripts produced by an insular church to contain a near complete copy of the New Testament. The manuscript was the work of a scribe named Ferdomnach of Armagh (died 845 or 846). Ferdomnach wrote the first part of the book in 807 or 808, for Patrick's heir (comarba) Torbach. It was one of the symbols of the office for the Archbishop of Armagh. The custodianship of the book was an important office that eventually became hereditary in the MacMoyre family. It remained in the hands of the MacMoyre family in the townland of Ballymoyer near Whitecross, County Armagh until the late 17th century. Its last hereditary keeper was Florence MacMoyer. By 1707 it was in the possession of the Brownlow family of Lurgan. It remained in the Brownlow family until 1853 when it was sold to the Irish antiquary, Dr William Reeves. In 1853, Reeves sold the Book to John George de la Poer Beresford, Archbishop of Armagh, who presented it to Trinity College, Dublin,Atkinson, E.D., R.S.A.I. (1911). Dromore An Ulster Diocese, p.19. =Literature in Ulster Scots= Scots, mainly Gaelic-speaking, had been settling in Ulster since the 15th century, but large numbers of Scots-speaking Lowlanders, some 200,000, arrived during the 17th century following the 1610 Plantation, with the peak reached during the 1690s.Montgomery & Gregg 1997: 585 In the core areas of Scots settlement, Scots outnumbered English settlers by five or six to one.Adams 1977: 57 Literature from shortly before the end of the unselfconscious tradition at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries is almost identical with contemporary writing from Scotland. W G Lyttle, writing in Paddy McQuillan's Trip Tae Glesco, uses the typically Scots forms kent and begood, now replaced in Ulster by the more mainstream Anglic forms knew, knowed or knawed and begun. Many of the modest contemporary differences between Scots as spoken in Scotland and Ulster may be due to dialect levelling and influence from Mid Ulster English brought about through relatively recent demographic change rather than direct contact with Irish, retention of older features or separate development. The earliest identified writing in Scots in Ulster dates from 1571: a letter from Agnes Campbell of County Tyrone to Elizabeth I on behalf of Turlough O'Neil, her husband. Although documents dating from the Plantation period show conservative Scots features, English forms started to predominate from the 1620s as Scots declined as a written medium.The Edinburgh Companion to Scots, ed. Corbett, McClure, Stuart-Smith, Edinburgh 2003, In Ulster Scots-speaking areas there was traditionally a considerable demand for the work of Scottish poets, often in locally printed editions. Alexander Montgomerie's The Cherrie and the Slae in 1700, shortly over a decade later an edition of poems by Sir David Lindsay, nine printings of Allan Ramsay's The Gentle shepherd between 1743 and 1793, and an edition of Robert Burns' poetry in 1787, the same year as the Edinburgh edition, followed by reprints in 1789, 1793 and 1800. Among other Scottish poets published in Ulster were James Hogg and Robert Tannahill. Poetry in Ulster Scots by Robert Huddlestone (1814‚Äì1887) inscribed in paving in Writers' Square, Belfast That was complemented by a poetry revival and nascent prose genre in Ulster, which started around 1720.The historical presence of Ulster-Scots in Ireland, Robinson, in The Languages of Ireland, ed. Cronin and √ì Cuillean√°in, Dublin 2003 The most prominent being the 'rhyming weaver' poetry, of which, some 60 to 70 volumes were published between 1750 and 1850, the peak being in the decades 1810 to 1840, although the first printed poetry (in the Habbie stanza form) by an Ulster Scots writer was published in a broadsheet in Strabane in 1735.Rhyming Weavers, Hewitt, 1974 These weaver poets looked to Scotland for their cultural and literary models and were not simple imitators but clearly inheritors of the same literary tradition following the same poetic and orthographic practices; it is not always immediately possible to distinguish traditional Scots writing from Scotland and Ulster. Among the rhyming weavers were James Campbell (1758‚Äì1818), James Orr (1770‚Äì1816), Thomas Beggs (1749‚Äì1847), David Herbison (1800‚Äì1880), Hugh Porter (1780‚Äì1839) and Andrew McKenzie (1780‚Äì1839). Scots was also used in the narrative by novelists such as W. G. Lyttle (1844‚Äì1896) and Archibald McIlroy (1860‚Äì1915). By the middle of the 19th century the Kailyard school of prose had become the dominant literary genre, overtaking poetry. This was a tradition shared with Scotland which continued into the early 20th century. Scots also regularly appeared in newspaper columns, especially in Antrim and Down, in the form of pseudonymous social commentary employing a folksy first-person style. The pseudonymous Bab M'Keen (probably successive members of the Weir family: John Weir, William Weir, and Jack Weir) provided comic commentaries in the Ballymena Observer and County Antrim Advertiser for over a hundred years from the 1880s. A somewhat diminished tradition of vernacular poetry survived into the 20th century in the work of poets such as Adam Lynn, author of the 1911 collection Random Rhymes frae Cullybackey, John Stevenson (died 1932), writing as \\"Pat M'Carty\\".Ferguson (ed.) 2008, Ulster-Scots Writing, Dublin, p. 21 From 1922: Literature of Northern Ireland  The year 1922 marked a significant change in the relationship between Britain and Ireland, with the setting up of the Irish Free State in the predominantly Catholic South, while the predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom. The outbreak of The Troubles in the 1960s provided a theme for writers; some were engaged in the social and political background, others reacted against the tensions by looking at nature. =Literature in English= Blue plaque for Brian O'Nolan Helen Waddell is best known for bringing to light the history of the medieval goliards in her 1927 book The Wandering Scholars, and translating their Latin poetry in the companion volume Medieval Latin Lyrics.

Her first play was The Spoiled Buddha, which was performed at the Opera House, Belfast, by the Ulster Literary Society. Her The Abb√© Pr√©vost was staged in 1935. Her historical novel Peter Abelard was published in 1933. It was critically well received and became a bestseller.Jennifer Fitzgerald, \\"'Truth's Martyr or Love's Martyr': Helen Waddell's Peter Abelard\\" in the Colby Quarterly, vol. 36, 2 June 2000, pp. 176‚Äì7. Brian Moore ( 25 August 1921 ‚Äì 11 January 1999) was a novelist and screenwriter from Northern Ireland who emigrated to Canada and later lived in the United States. He was acclaimed for the descriptions in his novels of life in Northern Ireland after the Second World War, in particular his explorations of the inter-communal divisions of The Troubles. He was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1975 and the inaugural Sunday Express Book of the Year award in 1987, and he was shortlisted for the Booker Prize three times (in 1976, 1987 and 1990). His Belfast-set novel Judith Hearne, remains among his most highly regarded. Cal is a 1983 novel by Bernard MacLaverty, detailing the experiences of a young Irish Catholic involved with the IRA. Ripley Bogle is the debut novel of Robert McLiam Wilson, published in 1989 in the UK. Written when he was 26 it is arguably his most acclaimed, winning the Rooney Prize and the Hughes Prize in 1989, and a Betty Trask Award and the Irish Book Awards the following year. The Miracle Shed is a 1995 collection of short stories by Philip MacCann, published to great critical acclaim and winning the Rooney Prize in 1995. One story, Grey Area, describes total disassociation and bitter cynicism of teenaged Irish Catholics living in Belfast in the early 1980s at the time of the hunger strikes towards the Northern Ireland Troubles and the armed struggle of the IRA. In many ways it is a study of the semiology of propaganda and the politics of colour. Colin Bateman's Dan Starkey novels are mostly set in Northern Ireland. Anna Burns' third novel Milkman, won the Man Booker Prize in 2018.https://themanbookerprize.com/fiction ;Poetry in English 1922‚Äì45 John Hewitt (1907‚Äì1987), whom many consider to be the founding father of Northern Irish poetry, also came from a rural background but lived in Belfast and was amongst the first Irish poets to write of the sense of alienation that many at this time felt from both their original rural and new urban homes. Louis MacNeice (1907‚Äì1963) was associated with the left-wing politics of Michael Roberts's anthology New Signatures. MacNeice's poetry was informed by his immediate interests and surroundings and is more social than political. As an urban Northerner, MacNeice could not idealize his native landscape as did John Hewitt, and with his Belfast Anglican background could not sympathize with a romantic view of Catholic Ireland. He felt estranged from Presbyterian Northern Ireland with its \\"voodoo of the Orange bands\\", but felt caught between British and Irish identities. Richard Rowley's early poems, in The City of Refuge (1917), were rhetorical celebrations of industry. His next volume, City Songs and Others (1918), included his most quoted poem The Islandmen, and is regarded as containing his most original work: Browning- like monologues straight from the mouths of Belfast‚Äôs working-class. ;Poetry in English after World War II Robert Greacen (1920‚Äì2008), along with Valentin Iremonger, edited an important anthology, Contemporary Irish Poetry in 1949. Greacen was born in Derry, lived in Belfast in his youth and then in London during the 1950s, 60s and 70s. He won the Irish Times Prize for Poetry in 1995 for his Collected Poems, after he returned to live in Dublin when he was elected a member of Aosdana. Other poets of note from this time include Roy McFadden (1921‚Äì1999), a friend for many years of Greacen. Another Northern poet of note is Padraic Fiacc (1924‚Äì ), who was born in Belfast, but lived in America during his youth. In the 1960s, and coincident with the rise of the Troubles in the province, a number of poets began to receive critical and public notice. Prominent amongst these were John Montague (born 1929), Michael Longley (born 1939), Derek Mahon (born 1941), Seamus Heaney (born 1939), and Paul Muldoon (born 1951). Some critics find that these poets share some formal traits (including an interest in traditional poetic forms) as well as a willingness to engage with the difficult political situation in Northern Ireland. Others (such as the Dublin poet Thomas Kinsella) have found the whole idea of a Northern school to be more hype than reality, though this view is not widely held. The Belfast Group was a poets' workshop which was organized by Philip Hobsbaum when he moved to Belfast in October 1963 to lecture in English at Queen's University. Seamus Heaney attended group meetings from the start. Heaney has said that the group \\"ratified the idea of writing\\". Michael Longley started attending after his return to Belfast in 1964. He has said that the group gave \\"an air of seriousness and electricity to the notion of writing\\", and that he was \\"surprised by the ferocity of Hobsbaum's attack\\". Other participants over the years included: James Simmons, Paul Muldoon, Ciar√°n Carson, Stewart Parker, Bernard MacLaverty, Frank Ormsby and the critics Edna Longley and Michael Allen. Louis Muinzer, the translator and theatre director was also a member of the group. In 1965 and 1966, the Belfast Festival at Queen's published pamphlets by some of the members of the group, including Heaney, Longley, and this attracted a certain amount of publicity. After Hobsbaum's departure for Glasgow in 1966, the Group lapsed for a while, but then was reconstituted in 1968 by Michael Allen, Arthur Terry, and Heaney. Meetings were held at Seamus and Marie Heaney's house on Ashley Avenue. May 1968 saw the first issue of The Honest Ulsterman, edited by James Simmons. The Belfast Group ceased to exist in 1972. Heaney is probably the best-known of these poets. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995, and has served as Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory and Emerson Poet in Residence at Harvard, and as Professor of Poetry at Oxford. Seamus Heaney in his verse translation of Beowulf (2000) uses words from his Ulster speech A Catholic from Northern Ireland, Heaney, however, rejected his British identity and lived in the Republic of Ireland for much of his later lifeSameer Rahim, \\"Interview with Seamus Heaney\\". The Telegraph, 11 April 2009. until his death in 2013. Derek Mahon was born in Belfast and worked as a journalist, editor, and screenwriter while publishing his first books. His slim output should not obscure the high quality of his work, which is influenced by modernist writers such as Samuel Beckett. Paul Muldoon is Howard G. B. Clark '21 Professor in the Humanities at Princeton University. In 1999 he was also elected Professor of Poetry at the University of Oxford. Belfast Confetti is a poem about the aftermath of an IRA bomb by Ciar√°n Carson. The poem won the Irish Times Irish Literature Prize for Poetry. =Literature in Irish= Gear√≥id Mac Lochlainn, a Belfast-based poet who learned Irish in school, has produced several poetry collections in Irish, including Sruth Teangacha/Stream of Tongues, which included translations by a number of prominent poets both in Irish and English, including Ciaran Carson, Medbh McGuckian, and Rita Kelly. =Literature in Ulster Scots= A somewhat diminished tradition of vernacular poetry survived into the 20th century in the work John Clifford (1900‚Äì1983) from East Antrim. A prolific writer and poet, W. F. Marshall (8 May 1888 ‚Äì January 1959) was known as \\"The Bard of Tyrone\\", Marshall composed poems such as Hi Uncle Sam, Me an' me Da (subtitled Livin' in Drumlister), Sarah Ann and Our Son. He was a leading authority on Mid Ulster English (the predominant dialect of Ulster). In the late 20th century the Ulster Scots poetic tradition was revived, albeit often replacing the traditional Modern Scots orthographic practice with a series of contradictory idiolects.Gavin Falconer (2008) review of \\"Frank Ferguson, Ulster-Scots Writing: an anthology\\" James Fenton's poetry, at times lively, contented, wistful, is written in contemporary Ulster Scots, mostly using a blank verse form, but also occasionally the Habbie stanza. He employs an orthography that presents the reader with the difficult combination of eye dialect, dense Scots, and a greater variety of verse forms than employed hitherto. Philip Robinson's (born 1946) writing has been described as verging on \\"post-modern kailyard\\". He has produced a trilogy of novels Wake the Tribe o Dan (1998), The Back Streets o the Claw (2000) and The Man frae the Ministry (2005), as well as story books for children Esther, Quaen o tha Ulidian Pechts and Fergus an tha Stane o Destinie, and two volumes of poetry Alang the Shore (2005) and Oul Licht, New Licht (2009). The polarising effects of the politics of the use of English and Irish language traditions limited academic and public interest until the studies of John Hewitt from the 1950s onwards. Further impetus was given by more generalised exploration of non-\\"Irish\\" and non-\\"English\\" cultural identities in the latter decades of the 20th Century. Michael Longley has experimented with Ulster Scots for the translation of Classical verse, as in his 1995 collection The Ghost Orchid. Longley has spoken of his identity as a Northern Irish poet: \\"some of the time I feel British and some of the time I feel Irish. But most of the time I feel neither and the marvellous thing about the Good Friday agreement was that it allowed me to feel more of each if I wanted to.\\" He was awarded the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry in 2001. A team in Belfast has begun translating portions of the Bible into Ulster Scots. The Gospel of Luke was published in 2009 by The Ullans Press.

(; ), named Cottus, Briareus (or Aegaeon) and Gyges (or Gyes), were three monstrous giants, of enormous size and strength, with fifty heads and one hundred arms. In the standard tradition they were the offspring of Uranus (Sky) and Gaia (Earth), who helped Zeus and the Olympians overthrow the Titans. Names The three Hundred-Handers were named Cottus, Briareus and Gyges. Cottus (ŒöœåœÑœÑŒøœÇ) is a common Thracian name, and is perhaps related to the name of the Thracian goddess Kotys.West 1966, pp. 209-210 on line 149 ŒöœåœÑœÑŒøœÇ, which says that Cottus was the name of \\"various Thracian princes\\"; Bremmer, p. 76; Caldwell, p. 37 on lines 147-153\\\\. Ker√©nyi, p. 19, translates Cottus as \\"the striker\\". The name Briareus (ŒíœÅŒπŒ¨œÅŒµœâœÇ) was probably formed from the Greek Œ≤œÅŒπŒ±œÅœåœÇ meaning \\"strong\\".West 1966, p. 210 on line 149 ŒíœÅŒπŒ¨œÅŒµœâœÇ; Kirk, p. 94; LSJ, s.v. Œ≤œÅŒπŒ±œÅœåœÇ. Ker√©nyi, p. 19, translates Briareus as \\"the strong\\". Hesiod's Theogony also calls him \\"Obriareus\\".Hesiod, Theogony 617, 734. According to West 1966, p. 210, the \\"o'- being an old prepositional prefix\\". The name Gyges is possibly related to the mythical Attic king Ogyges (·Ω®Œ≥œçŒ≥Œ∑œÇ).Caldwell, p. 37 on lines 147-153; West 1966, p. 210 on line 149 ŒìœçŒ≥Œ∑œÇ. Caldwell notes that the name Ogyges came to mean \\"primaeval\\", so that, for example, the \\"primal water\\" of Styx at Hesiod, Theogony, 805 is \\"hydor ogygion.\\" \\"Gyes\\", rather than Gyges, is found in some texts.According to West 1966, p. 210 on line 149 ŒìœçŒ≥Œ∑œÇ, although some manuscripts of the Theogony contain Gyes (ŒìœçŒ∑œÇ), Gyges is the \\"correct form\\" of the name, \\"and should be preferred\\" as well in Apollodorus, 1.1.1, and Ovid, Tristia 4.7.18. Compare with Ovid, Fasti 4.593, which has \\"Gyges\\". West notes that the form Gyes perhaps came \\"from association\\" with \\"Œ≥œÖ·øñŒøŒΩ\\" (limb, hand: LSJ, s.v. Œ≥œÖ·øñŒøŒΩ) and \\"·ºÄŒºœÜŒπŒ≥œçŒµŒπœÇ\\" (strong in both arms: Autenrieth, s.v. ·ºÄŒºœÜŒπ-Œ≥œÖŒÆŒµŒπœÇ); see also Beekes, Etymological Dictionary of Ancient Greek, s.v. Œ≥œçŒ∑œÇ. Homer's Iliad gives Briareus a second name, saying that Briareus is the name the gods call him, while Aegaeon (Œë·º∞Œ≥Œ±ŒØœâŒΩ) is the name that men call him.Willcock, p. 12; Homer, Iliad 1.403-404. The root Œ±·º∞Œ≥- is found in words associated with the sea: Œ±·º∞Œ≥ŒπŒ±ŒªœåœÇ \\"shore\\", Œ±·º∞Œ≥ŒµœÇ and Œ±·º∞Œ≥Œ¨Œ¥ŒµœÇ \\"waves\\".Fowler 2013, p. 69, which also mentions the possibly sea-connected Œ±·º∞Œ≥ŒØœÇ (see LSJ, s.v. Œ±·º∞Œ≥ŒØœÇ); Fowler 1988, p. 100. The name suggests a connection with the Aegean Sea.Willcock, p. 12. According to Arrian apparently, the Aegean Sea was said to have been named after an Aegaeon, see Sprawski, p. 107; Fowler 2013, p. 68; Arrian, Bithyn. fr. Roos = FGrHist 156 F 92. Poseidon was sometimes called Aegaeon or Aegaeus (Œë·º∞Œ≥Œ±·øñŒøœÇ).Fowler 2013, pp. 68-69; Fowler 1988, p. 101; Kirk, p. 95; Leaf, p. 32 1.403. For \\"Aegaeon\\" see Callimachus fr. 59.6 Trypanis, pp. 44, 45 = fr. 59.6 Pfeiffer = Lloyd-Jones and Parsons, SH 265.6; Lycophron, Alexandra 135; for Aegaeus, see Aristas (TrGF 9 F 1); Strabo, 9.2.13; Virgil, Aeneid 3.74. Aegaeon could be a patronymic, i.e. \\"son of Aegaeus\\",See Lattimore's translation, of Iliad 1.404, p. 70, which considers \\"Aegaeon\\" to be a patronymic by formation, translating it as \\"Aigaios' son\\", with glossary entry, p. 498: \\"Aigai'os: God of the sea, father of Briareos\\"; Willcock, p. 12; Fowler 1988, p. 99 n. 11. At Hesiod, Theogony 817-819, Briareus is the son-in-law of Poseidon, and Iliad scholia describe him as a son of Poseidon, see West 1966, p. 210 on line 149 ŒíœÅŒπŒ¨œÅŒµœâœÇ. or it could instead mean \\"the man from Aegae\\".Fowler 1988, p. 101. The name Hecatoncheires derives from the Greek ·ºëŒ∫Œ±œÑœåŒΩ (hekaton, \\"hundred\\") and œáŒµŒØœÅ (cheir, \\"hand‚Äù or \\"arm\\"). Although the Theogony describes the three brothers as having one hundred hands (·ºëŒ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ Œº·Ω≤ŒΩ œáŒµ·øñœÅŒµœÇ),Hesiod, Theogony 150. the collective name Hecatoncheires (·ºôŒ∫Œ±œÑœåŒ≥œáŒµŒπœÅŒµœÇ), i.e. the Hundred-Handers, is never used.West 1966, p. 209 on line 147; Fowler 2013, p. 26; Hard, p. 66. The Theogony once refers to the brothers collectively as \\"the gods whom Zeus brought up from the dark\\",West 1966, p. 209 on line 147; . otherwise it simply uses their individual names: Cottus, Briareus (or Obriareus) and Gyges.Cottus, Briareus, Gyges at Theogony 149, 714, 816; Cottus, Obriareus, and Gyges at Theogony 617-618, 734; Cottus at Theogony 654. The Iliad does not use the name Hecatoncheires either, although it does use the adjective hekatoncheiros (·ºëŒ∫Œ±œÑœåŒ≥œáŒµŒπœÅŒøœÇ), i.e. \\"hundred-handed\\", to describe Briareus. It is possible that Acusilaus used the name,West 1966, p. 209 on line 147; Fowler 2013, p. 26; Acusilaus fr. 8 Fowler pp. 8-9 = FGrHist 2 8. but the first certain usage is found in the works of the mythographers such as Apollodorus.Apollodorus, 1.1.1. See also Palaephatus 19 (Stern, p. 50). Mythology =The Hundred-Handers= The Hundred- Handers, Cottus, Briareus and Gyges, were three monstrous giants, of enormous size and strength, with fifty heads and one hundred arms.Hard, pp. 65-66; Hansen, pp. 159, 231; Gantz, p. 10; Brill's New Pauly, s.v. Hekatoncheires; Tripp, s.v. Hundred-handed pp. 307-308; Grimal, s.v. Hecatoncheires p. 182. They were among the eighteen offspring of Uranus (Sky) and Gaia (Earth), which also included the twelve Titans, and the three one-eyed Cyclopes. According to the Theogony of Hesiod, they were the last of these children of Uranus to be born, while according to the mythographer Apollodorus they were the first.Hesiod, Theogony 126-153; Apollodorus, 1.1.1-3. In the Hesiodic tradition, they played a key role in the Greek succession myth, which told how the Titan Cronus overthrew his father Uranus, and how in turn Zeus overthrew Cronus and his fellow Titans, and how Zeus was eventually established as the final and permanent ruler of the cosmos.Hard, pp. 65-69; Hansen, pp. 66-67, 293-294; West 1966, pp. 18-19; Dowden, pp. 35-36. According to the standard version of the succession myth, given in the accounts of Hesiod and Apollodorus, the Hundred-Handers, along with their brothers the Cyclopes, were imprisoned by their father Uranus.Hesiod, Theogony 154-158, says that Uranus \\"put them all away out of sight in a hiding place in Earth and did not let them come up into the light\\", while according to Apollodorus, 1.1.2, Uranus \\"bound and cast [them] into Tartarus\\", the two places perhaps being the same (see West 1966, p. 338 on line 618, and Caldwell, p. 37 on lines 154-160). Gaia induced Cronus to castrate Uranus, and Cronus took over the supremacy of the cosmos.Hesiod, Theogony 159-182; Apollodorus, 1.1.4. With his sister the Titaness Rhea, Cronus fathered several offspring, but he swallowed each of them at birth. However, Cronus' last child Zeus was saved by Rhea, and Zeus freed his brothers and sisters, and together they (the Olympians) began a great war, the Titanomachy, against the Titans, for control of the cosmos.Hesiod, Theogony 453-500; Apollodorus, 1.1.5-1.2.1. Gaia had foretold that, with the help of the Hundred-Handers, the Olympians would be victorious, so Zeus released them from their captivity and the Hundred-Handers fought alongside the Olympians against the Titans and were instrumental in the Titans' defeat. The Titans were then imprisoned in Tartarus with the Hundred- Handers as their guards.Hesiod, Theogony 624-735; Apollodorus, 1.2.1. As for the Hundred-Handers as the Titans' warders, this is explicitly stated at Apollodorus, 1.2.1. This is also the usual interpretation of Theogony 734-735 (e.g. Hard, p. 68; Hansen, pp. 25, 159, adding the caveat \\"presumably\\"; Gantz, p. 45). However according to West 1966, p. 363 on lines 734-5: \\"It is usually assumed that the Hundred-Handers are acting as prison guards (so Tz. Th. 277 œÑŒø·Ω∫œÇ ·ºôŒ∫Œ±œÑœåŒ≥œáŒµŒπœÅŒ±œÇ Œ±·Ω∫œÑŒø·øñœÇ œÜœçŒªŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÇ ·ºêœÄŒπœÉœÑŒÆœÉŒ±œÇ). The poet does not say this-- œÄŒπœÉœÑŒø·Ω∂ œÜœçŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒµœÇ ŒîŒπ·Ω∏œÇ probably refers to their help in battle, cf. 815 Œ∫ŒªŒµŒπœÑŒø·Ω∂ ·ºêœÄŒØŒ∫ŒøœÖœÅŒøŒπ\\". Compare with Theogony 817-819. The lost epic poem the Titanomachy (see below), although probably written after Hesiod's Theogony,West 2002, p. 109 dates the Titanomachy as \\"late seventh century [BC] at the earliest\\". perhaps preserved an older tradition in which the Hundred-Handers fought on the side of the Titans, rather than the Olympians.Bremmer, p. 76; West 2002, pp. 110-111; Tsagalis, p. 53. According to a euhemeristic rationalized account, given by Palaephatus, Cottus and Brriareos, rather than being hundred-handed giants, were instead men, who were called the Hundred-Handers because they lived in a city called Hecatoncheiria (\\"Hundredarm\\"). They came to the aid of the residents of the city of Olympia (i.e. the Olympians) in driving away the Titans from their city.Hawes, p. 60; Grimal, s.v. Hecatoncheires p. 182; Palaephatus, 19, see Stern, p. 50. =Briareus/Aegaeon= Briareus, summoned to Olympus by Thetis to quell a revolt against Zeus by Poseidon, Athena and Hera. Etching by Tommaso Piroli (1795) after a drawing of John Flaxman. Briareus was the most prominent of the three Hundred-Handers.West 1966, p. 210 on line 149 ŒíœÅŒπŒ¨œÅŒµœâœÇ; Grimal, s.v. Aegaeon p. 16. In Hesiod's Theogony he is singled out as being \\"good\\", and is rewarded by Poseidon, who gives Briareus his daughter Cymopolea (otherwise unknown) for his wife.Hesiod, Theogony 817-819; West 1966, p. 379 on line 819 ŒöœÖŒºŒøœÄœåŒªŒµŒπŒ±ŒΩ. In Homer's Iliad, Briareus is given a second name, Aegaeon, saying that Briareus is the name the gods call him, while mortals call him Aegaeon. It is told in the Iliad how, during a palace revolt by the Olympians Hera, Poseidon and Athena, who wished to chain Zeus, the sea goddess Thetis brought to Olympus: This second name does not seem to be a Homeric invention.Fowler 1988, p. 98 with n. 5; Sprawski, p. 107; Schol. on Apollonius of Rhodes 1.1165c. According to the scholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes, the legendary seventh-century BC poet Cinaethon apparently knew both names for the Hundred-Hander. The name also appears in the lost epic poem the Titanomachy. Titan ally While in Hesiod and Homer, the powerful Hundred-Hander Briareus was a faithful and rewarded ally of Zeus, the Titanomachy seems to have reflected a different tradition.Fowler 2013, p. 69; Bremmer, p. 76; West 2002, p. 111. Apparently, according to the Titanomachy, Aegaeon was the son of Gaia and Pontus (Sea), rather than Gaia and Uranus, and fought on the side of the Titans, rather than the Olympians.Eumelus fr. 3 West [= Schol. on Apollonius of Rhodes 1.1165c]. See also Tsagalis, pp. 19-20. The scholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes, tells us that according to Cinaethon, Aegeaon was defeated by Poseidon.Fowler 2013, p. 69; Cinaethon, Herakleia (fr. dub. 7 Bernab√© = Heraclea fr. A Davies p. 142) = schol. Apollonius of Rhodes 1.1165c. Apollonius of Rhodes mentions the \\"great tomb of Aegaeon\\", seen by the Argonauts when \\"they were passing within sight of the mouth of the Rhyndacus ... a short distance beyond Phrygia\\".Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica 1164-1166. The scholiast on Apollonius, says that the tomb marked the spot where Aegaeon's defeat occurred.Hasluck, p. 54. As in the lost Titanomachy, for the Latin poets Virgil and Ovid, Briareus was also an enemy of the gods, rather than an ally. In his Aeneid, Virgil has Aegaeon make war against the gods, \\"with fifty sounding shields and fifty swords\\".Virgil, Aeneid 10.565-568\\\\. Compare with Antimachus fr. 14 Matthews (= 14 Wyss) p. 108, which perhaps here Virgil followed, see Matthews, p. 109. Ovid, in his poem Fasti, has Briareus on the side of the Titans. As Ovid tells us, after the Titans had been overthrown, apparently in order to restore the Titans to power, Briareus sacrificed a bull, about which it had been prophesied that whoever burned its entrails would be able to conquer the gods. However just when Briareus was about to burn the entrails, birds snatched them away, and were rewarded with a home among the stars.Heyworth, p. 248 on 8.805-8; Frazer, p. 143 on 3.805; Ovid, Fasti 3.793-808\\\\. Compare with Ovid, Fasti 4.593, Amores 2.1.11-18, where the Hundred-Hander Gyges is also mentioned as having fought against the gods. Association with the sea In the lost epic Titanomachy, Aegaeon was the son of Pontus (Sea), and lived in the sea. Briareus/Aegaeon's association with the sea can perhaps already be seen in Hesiod and Homer. In the Theogony, Briareus ends up living, apart from his brothers, with Cymopolea the (sea-nymph?)As her name suggests, see Kirk, p. 95. daughter of Poseidon the god of the sea, where it might be supposed the couple dwells, while in the Iliad one might also suppose that Briareus dwells in the sea, since it was the sea goddess Thetis that fetched him to Olympus.So West 2002, p. 111, which says that in the Theogony, \\"It is implied that [Briareus] lives somewhere else, presumably in the sea\\", and in the Iliad, \\"It must have been from the sea\\" that the sea goddess Thetis fetched Briareus. See also West 1966, p. 210 on line 149 ŒíœÅŒπŒ¨œÅŒµœâœÇ; Tsagalis, p. 54; Fowler 1988, p. 97. Apparently, this was made explicit by the fifth-century BC poet Ion of Chios, who referring to the Homeric story of the Olympians' revolt against Zeus, said that Aegaeon was the son of Thalassa (Sea) and that Thetis \\"summoned him from the Ocean\\".Ion of Chios fr. 741 Campbell [= Schol. on Apollonius of Rhodes 1.1165c]. A connection to the sea can also be seen in the name Aegaeon (Œë·º∞Œ≥Œ±ŒØœâŒΩ·æΩ) itself. The root Œ±·º∞Œ≥- is found in words associated with the sea: Œ±·º∞Œ≥ŒπŒ±ŒªœåœÇ 'shore', Œ±·º∞Œ≥ŒµœÇ and Œ±·º∞Œ≥Œ¨Œ¥ŒµœÇ 'waves'.Fowler 2013, p. 69, which also mentions the possibly sea-connected Œ±·º∞Œ≥ŒØœÇ (see LSJ, s.v. Œ±·º∞Œ≥ŒØœÇ); Fowler 1988, p. 100. while Poseidon himself was sometimes called Aegaeon.Fowler 2013, pp. 68-69; Kirk, p. 95; Leaf, p. 32 1.403. Later writers also make Briareus/Aegaeon's association with the sea explicit. According to Aelian, Aristotle said that the Pillars of Heracles (i.e. the Strait of Gibraltar) had been previously named the Pillars of Briareus.Sprawski, p. 107; Bos, p. 73; Boffa and Leone, p. 386; Aelian, Varia Historia (Historical Miscellany) 5.3 [= Aristotle fr. 678 Rose]. Compare Euphorion fr. 169 Lightfoot; Parthenius fr. 34 Lightfoot. Ovid, in his Metamorphoses, describes Aegaeon as a \\"dark-hued\\" sea god \\"whose strong arms can overpower huge whales\\",Ovid, Metamorphoses 2.8-10. while according to Arrian apparently, the Aegean Sea was said to have been named after Aegaeon.Sprawski, p. 107; Fowler 2013, p. 68; Fowler 1988, p. 100 n. 15; Arrian, Bithyn. fr. Roos = FGrHist 156 F 92. For the various ancient explanations for the name of the Aegean Sea, see Fowler 2013, pp. 68-70\\\\. For other marine connections see West 2002, p. 111 n. 10. As reported by Pliny, according to the Euboean Archemachus, the first man to sail in a \\"long ship‚Äù was Aegaeon.Sprawski, p. 106; Boffa and Leone, p. 385; Pliny, Natural History 7.207 = Archemachus FGrHist 424 F 5 (see Sprawski, p. 118). Euboea Briareus/Aegaeon had a particular connection with the Greek island of Euboea.Bakhuizen, p. 126: \\"In an early epoch the whole of Euboea ... was the world of Aigaion.\\" For a detailed discussion of the Euboean connection see Boffa and Leone. According to the third-century Latin grammarian Solinus, Briareus was worshipped at Carystus, and Aegaeon at Chalcis.Boffa and Leone, p. 385-386; West 1966, p. 210 on line 149 ŒíœÅŒπŒ¨œÅŒµœâœÇ; Fowler 1988, p. 101 n. 20; Solinus 11.16 (quoted in Latin by Farnell, p. 26 note c). Aegaeon was said to be the name of a ruler of Carystus, which had also been named Aigaie (ŒëŒØŒ≥Œ±ŒØŒ∑) after him, while Briareus was said to be the father of Euboea, after whom the island took its name.Bremmer, p. 76; Sprawski, p. 107; Fowler 1988, p. 100; West 1966, p. 210 on line 149 ŒíœÅŒπŒ¨œÅŒµœâœÇ. See Schol. on Apollonius of Rhodes 1.1165 (Wellauer, p. 61); Stephanus of Byzantium s.v. ŒöŒ¨œÅœÖœÉœÑŒøœÇ; Eustathius, 281.3; Hesychius s.v. Œ§ŒπœÑŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ¥Œ±. Aegeaon was perhaps associated with the place name Aegae mentioned by Homer (Il. 13.21, Od. 5.381) as Poseidon's home, and located by Strabo (8.7.4, 9.2.13) in Euboea north of Chalcis, as a place where Poseidon had a temple.Fowler 1988, pp. 100, 101 with n. 20; Boffa and Leone, p. 383; Strabo, 8.7.4, 9.2.13; Homer, Iliad 13.20-22, Odyssey 5.380-381\\\\. Bakhuizen, pp.126-127, argues that Euboean Aegae, rather than being the name of a town, was the name of a mountain. Poseidon Briareus/Aegaeon seems also closely connected with Poseidon.Fowler 1988, pp. 101-102; Boffa and Leone, p. 385. The name Aegaeon has associations with Poseidon. As noted above, Homer locates Poseidon's palace in Aegae.Fowler 1988, pp. 100, 101 with n. 20; Homer, Iliad 13.20-22, Odyssey 5.380-381. Poseidon was sometimes himself called Aegaeon, or Aegaeus (Œë·º∞Œ≥Œ±·øñŒøœÇ),Fowler 2013, pp. 68-69; Fowler 1988, p. 101; Kirk, p. 95; Leaf, p. 32 1.403. For \\"Aegaeon\\" see Callimachus fr. 59.6 Trypanis, pp. 44, 45 = fr. 59.6 Pfeiffer = Lloyd-Jones and Parsons, SH 265.6; Lycophron, Alexandra 135; for Aegaeus, see Aristas (TrGF 9 F 1); Strabo, 9.2.13; Virgil, Aeneid 3.74. and Aegaeon could mean 'son of Aegaeus'.See Lattimore's translation, of Iliad 1.404, p. 70, which considers \\"Aegaeon\\" to be a patronymic by formation, translating it as \\"Aigaios' son\\", with glossary entry, p. 498: \\"Aigai'os: God of the sea, father of Briareos\\"; Willcock, p. 12; Fowler 1988, p. 99 n. 11. Homer says that Briareus/Aegaeon \\"is mightier than his father\\", but who Homer is referring to as the father is unclear.See Boffa and Leone, p. 385; Fowler 1988; Kirk, p. 95. It has been sometimes supposed that contrary to Hesiod, who makes Uranus the father of Briareus, Cottus and Gyges, the father being referred to here is Poseidon,So for example, Leaf, p. 32 1.403. although this interpretation of Homer is uncertain at best.Fowler 1988, argues extensively against Homer meaning Poseidon as the father. See also Boffa and Leone, p. 385, which says \\"there is no solid evidence to support this idea [of Poseidon as the father]\\", and Kirk, p. 95, which calls this interpretation \\"rather uncertain\\". While Iliad scholia say that Briareus was a son of Poseidon (see: Fowler 1988, p. 96 n. 1; West 1966, p. 210 on line 149 ŒíœÅŒπŒ¨œÅŒµœâœÇ) Fowler 1988 discounts these scholia as based solely on an uncertain inference. In the Theogony Briareus becomes the son-in-law of Poseidon, while Poseidon, whether regarded as the father of Briareus/Aegaeon, or not, is a central figure in the story told about the Hundred-Hander in the ‚Äò‚ÄôIliad‚Äô‚Äô. Both are sea-gods with a special connection to Euboea.For both of their connections to Euboea, see Boffa and Leone. As noted above Poseidon was sometimes called Aegaeon, and it is possible that Aegaeon was an older cult-title for Poseidon, however according to Lewis Richard Farnell, it is more likely that Poseidon inherited the title of an \\"older Euboean sea-giant\\".Farnell, p. 26 note c. As mentioned above, the scholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes, tells us that according to Cinaethon, Aegeaon was defeated by Poseidon.Fowler 2013, p. 69; Cinaethon, Herakleia (fr. dub. 7 Bernab√© = Heraclea fr. A Davies p. 142) = schol. Apollonius of Rhodes 1.1165c. Possibly then, Briareus/Aegaeon was an older (pre-Greek?) sea-god eventually displaced by Poseidon.According to Fowler 2013, p. 69,\\"the guess is easy that [Aegaeon] was a pre-Greek sea-god, perhaps the pre-Greek sea-god, ousted by Poseidon upon arrival.\\" See also Fowler 1988, pp. 101-102. According to a Corinthian legend, Briareus was the arbitrator in a dispute between Poseidon and Helios (Sun) over some land, deciding that the Isthmus of Corinth belonged to Poseidon and the acropolis of Corinth (Acrocorinth) to Helios.Fowler 1988, p. 98 n. 5; Pausanias, 2.1.6, 2.4.6. Buried under Etna, inventor of armour The third-century BC poet Callimachus, apparently confusing Briareus as one of the Giants, says he was buried under Mount Etna in Sicily, making his shift from one shoulder to the other, the cause of earthquakes.Tripp, s.v. Hundred-handed or Hecatoncheires, pp. 307-308; Callimachus, Hymn 4 (to Delos) 141-146; Mineur. p. 153 on line 142 f. Like Callimachus, Philostratus also makes Aegaeon the cause of earthquakes.Philostratus, Life of Apollonius of Tyana 4.6. According to an Oxyrhynchus papyrus, ‚Äúthe first to use metal armour was Briareos, whilst previously men protected their bodies with animal skins.‚ÄùBoffa and Leone, p. 385, citing P.Oxy. X 1241 col. IV. These stories are perhaps connected to a myth which may have made Briareus, like the Olympian god Hephaestus, a subterranean smith, who used the fires of Mount Etna as a forge for metalworking.Boffa and Leone, p. 385. Possible origins Briareus and Aegean, were perhaps originally, separate entities.See West 2002, p. 111 n. 9, which says that Briareus and Aegean are ‚Äúpresumably separate in origin\\". Boffa and Leone, p. 385, further suggest that they were ‚Äúa fusion of two entities: ‚Äòthe strong one‚Äô, Briareos, referring to the strength due to his 100 arms, and the sea-god, Aigaion, perhaps belonging to pre-Greek tradition.‚Äù Briareus/Aegaeon may have once been a many-armed sea monster, personifying the uncontrolled power of the sea itself.West 2002, p. 111 says: \\"it seems likely that this many-armed figure was a marine monster in origin, a demonized giant polyp, an embodiment of the sea itself in its unruly strength\\". As noted above, Briareus/Aegaeon may have been an older god of the sea, replaced by Poseidon. He was perhaps a Greek reflection of Near-Eastern traditions in which the Sea challenged the storm-god, such as in the Ugaritic tradition of the battle between Yammu (Sea) and the storm-god Baal.West 2002, p. 111; Dowden, p. 36; Bachvarova, p. 257; Tsagalis, p. 54. Principal sources =The Theogony= According to the Theogony of Hesiod, Uranus (Sky) mated with Gaia (Earth) and produced eighteen children.Hard, pp. 65-66; Gantz, p. 10; Hesiod, Theogony 126-153\\\\. Compare with Apollodorus, 1.1.1-3 First came the twelve Titans, next the three one-eyed Cyclopes, and finally the three monstrous brothers Cottus, Briareus and Gyges. As the Theogony describes it: Uranus hated his children, including the Hundred-Handers,Hesiod, Theogony 154-155\\\\. Exactly which of these eighteen children Hesiod meant that Uranus hated is not entirely clear, all eighteen, or perhaps just the Cyclopes and the Hundred-Handers. Hard, p. 67, West 1988, p. 7, and Caldwell, p. 37 on lines 154-160, make it all eighteen, while Gantz, p. 10, says \\"likely all eighteen\\", and Most, p. 15 n. 8, says \\"apparently only the ... Cyclopes and Hundred-Handers are meant\\" and not the twelve Titans. See also West 1966, p. 206 on lines 139-53, p. 213 line 154 Œ≥·Ω∞œÅ. Why Uranus hated his children is also not clear. Gantz, p. 10 says: \\"The reason for [Uranus'] hatred may be [his children's] horrible appearance, though Hesiod does not quite say this\\"; while Hard, p. 67 says: \\"Although Hesiod is vague about the cause of his hatred, it would seem that he took a dislike to them because they were terrible to behold\\". However, West 1966, p. 213 on line 155, says that Uranus hated his children because of their \\"fearsome nature\\". and as soon as each was born, he imprisoned them underground, somewhere deep inside Gaia.Hesiod, Theogony 156-158\\\\. Theogony 619-620, says the Hundred-Handers were imprisoned by Uranus because of their \\"defiant manhood and their form and size;\\" compare with Acusilaus fr. 8 Fowler pp. 8-9 [= FGrHist 2 8], which says that Uranus imprisoned the Hundred-Handers because he was afraid that they would rise up against him, see Fowler 2013, p. 26. The hiding place inside Gaia is presumably her womb, see West 1966, p. 214 on line 158; Caldwell, p. 37 on lines 154-160; Gantz, p. 10. This place seems also to be the same place as Tartarus, see West 1966, p. 338 on line 618, and Caldwell, p. 37 on lines 154-160. As the Theogony describes it, Uranus bound the Hundred-Handers Eventually Uranus' son, the Titan Cronus, castrated Uranus, freeing his fellow Titans (but not, apparently, the Hundred-Handers), and Cronus became the new ruler of the cosmos.Hesiod, Theogony 173-182\\\\. Although the castration of Uranus results in the release of the Titans, it did not, apparently, also result in the release of the Hundred-Handers or Cyclopes, see Fowler 2013, p. 26; Hard, p. 67; West 1966, p. 206 on lines on lines 139-53. Cronus married his sister Rhea, and together they produced five children, whom Cronus swallowed as each was born, but the sixth child, Zeus, was saved by Rhea and hidden away to be raised by his grandmother Gaia. When Zeus grew up, he caused Cronus to disgorge his children, and a great war was begun, the Titanomachy, between Zeus and his siblings, and Cronus and the Titans, for control of the cosmos.Hesiod, Theogony 453-500. Gaia had foretold that Zeus would be victorious with the help of the Hundred-Handers, so Zeus released the Hundred- Handers from their bondage under the earth, and brought them up again into the light.Hesiod, Theogony 624-629\\\\. When exactly the Hundred-Handers were released from Tartarus and joined the battle is not entirely clear. Theogony 636 says that the Titanomachy raged for \\"ten full years\\". And although, for example, Hard, p. 68, Caldwell, p. 65 on line 636, and West 1966, p. 19, understand Hesiod as implying that the Hundred-Handers are released in the tenth year of the war, according to Gantz, p. 45, \\"Hesiod's account does not quite say whether the Hundred-Handers were freed before the conflict or only in the tenth year. ... Eventually, if not at the beginning, the Hundred- Handers are fighting\\". Zeus restored their strength by feeding them nectar and ambrosia, and then asked the Hundred-Handers to \\"manifest your great strength and your untouchable hands\\" and join in the war against the Titans.Hesiod, Theogony 639-653. And Cottus, speaking for the Hundred-Handers, agreed saying: And so the Hundred-Handers \\"took up their positions against the Titans ... holding enormous boulders in their massive hands\\",Hesiod, Theogony 674-675. and a final great battle was fought.Hesiod, Theogony 676-686. Striding forth from Olympus, Zeus unleashed the full fury of his thunderbolt, stunning and blinding the Titans,Gantz, p. 45; Hesiod, Theogony 687-710. while the Hundred- handers pelted them with enormous boulders: Thus the Titans were finally defeated and cast into Tartarus, where they were imprisoned.Hesiod, Theogony 721-733. As to the fate of the Hundred-Handers, the Theogony first tells us that they returned to Tartarus, to live nearby the \\"bronze gates\\" of the Titans' prison, where presumably, they took up the job of the Titans' warders.Hesiod, Theogony 734-735; Hard, p. 68; Hansen, pp. 25, 159; Gantz, p. 45. According to West 1966, p. 363 on lines 734-5, \\"It is usually assumed that the Hundred-Handers are acting as prison guards (so Tz. Th. 277 œÑŒø·Ω∫œÇ ·ºôŒ∫Œ±œÑœåŒ≥œáŒµŒπœÅŒ±œÇ Œ±·Ω∫œÑŒø·øñœÇ œÜœçŒªŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÇ ·ºêœÄŒπœÉœÑŒÆœÉŒ±œÇ). The poet does not say this--œÄŒπœÉœÑŒø·Ω∂ œÜœçŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒµœÇ ŒîŒπ·Ω∏œÇ probably refers to their help in battle, cf. 815 Œ∫ŒªŒµŒπœÑŒø·Ω∂ ·ºêœÄŒØŒ∫ŒøœÖœÅŒøŒπ\\". However, later in the poem, we are told that Cottus and Gyges \\"live in mansions upon the foundations of Ocean\\", while Briareus, \\"since he was good\\" became the son-in-law of Poseidon, who gave him \\"Cymopoliea his daughter to wed\\".Hesiod, Theogony 817-819\\\\. Although at 734-735 all three brothers seem to reside just outside the gates of the Titans' prison, the situation appears different here. Cottus and Gyges, although still apparently in the underworld, seem no longer to reside near the Titans, and Briareus seems no longer to be living with them, see West 2002, p. 111; West 1966, p. 358 on lines 720-819, p. 379 on line 816. =The Iliad= In a story that survives nowhere else, the Iliad briefly mentions Briareus (where it is said he was also called Aegaeon), referring to his having been summoned to Zeus' defense when \\"the other Olympians wished to put [Zeus] in bonds, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene.\\"Gantz, p. 59; Fowler 1988, pp. 96-97: \\"very likely Homer's invention\\"; Willcock, p. 11 on lines 396-406; Homer, Iliad 1.396-400. Achilles, while asking his mother the sea goddess Thetis to intercede with Zeus on his behalf, reminds her of a frequent boast of hers, that, at a time when the other Olympians wished to bind Zeus, she saved him by fetching the hundred-handed Briareus to Olympus: Who Homer means here as the father of Briareus/Aegaeon is unclear.See Boffa and Leone, p. 385; Fowler 1988; Kirk, p. 95. Iliad scholia say that Briareus was a son of Poseidon, see Fowler 1988, p. 96 n. 1; West 1966, p. 210 on line 149 ŒíœÅŒπŒ¨œÅŒµœâœÇ, but according to Fowler: \\"It is easy to infer that Poseidon is Aigaion's father because he is the only male god among opponents of Zeus here mentioned ... But the inference is uncertain. The ease of inference is I believe responsible for the information about Poseidon in Homeric scholia, ...\\". =The Titanomachy= The lost epic poem the Titanomachy, based on its title, must have told the story of the war between the Olympians and the Titans.West 2002, p. 110. Although probably written after Hesiod's Theogony,West 2002, p. 109 dates the Titanomachy as \\"late seventh century [BC] at the earliest\\". it perhaps reflected an older version of the story.West 2002, p. 111, gives evidence for the Titanomachy preserving an \\"older version\\". Only references to it by ancient sources survive, often attributing the poem to Eumelus a semi-legendary poet from Corinth. One mentions Aegaeon, the name identified with the Hundred-Hander Briareus in the Iliad. According to a scholion on Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica: Thus the Titanomachy apparently followed a different tradition than the more familiar account in the Theogony. Here Briareus/Aegaeon was the son of Earth (Gaia) and Sea Pontus) rather than Earth and Sky (Uranus), and he fought against the Olympians, rather than for them.Bremmer, p. 76; West 2002, pp. 110-111; Tsagalis, p. 53. For Hundred-Handers fighting against the Olympians, compare with Antimachus fr. 14 Matthews (= 14 Wyss) p. 108; Virgil, Aeneid 10.565-568; Ovid, Fasti 3.793-808, 4.593, Amores 2.1.11-18; Statius, Thebaid 2.595-601; Servius, On Aeneid 6.287, 10.565. As for Aegaeon's association with the sea, West 2002, p. 111, sees a connection already in Hesiod and Homer, since, at Theogony 815-19 \\"It is implied that he lives somewhere else, presumably in the sea\\" and \\"It must have been from the sea\\" that the sea goddess Thetis fetched Briareus at Iliad 1.400-406; see also West 1966, p. 210 on line 149 ŒíœÅŒπŒ¨œÅŒµœâœÇ. For later marine connections, compare Ion of Chios fr. 741 Campbell [= Schol. on Apollonius of Rhodes 1.1165c]; Euphorion fr. 169 Lightfoot; Ovid, Metamorphoses 2.8-10; see also West 2002, p. 111 n. 10; Tsagalis, pp. 54-56\\\\. According to Arrian apparently, the Aegean Sea was said to have been named after Aegaeon, see Sprawski, p. 107. =Ion of Chios= According to the same scholion on Apollonius of Rhodes mentioned above, the fifth-century BC poet Ion of Chios said that Aegaeon (who Thetis summoned in the Iliad to aid Zeus),Homer, Iliad 1.396-406. lived in the sea and was the son of Thalassa.Ion of Chios fr. 741 Campbell [= Schol. on Apollonius of Rhodes 1.1165c]; Gantz, p. 59. =Virgil= The first-century BC Latin poet Virgil, in his Aeneid, may have drawn on the same version of the story as that given in the lost Titanomachy. Virgil locates Briareus, as in Hesiod, in the underworld, where the Hundred-Hander dwells among \\"strange prodigies of bestial kind\\", which include the Centaurs, Scylla, the Lernaean Hydra, the Chimaera, the Gorgons, the Harpies, and Geryon.Virgil, Aeneid 6.282-294. Later Virgil describes the \\"hundred-handed\\" Aegaeon (the Iliad's Briareus): Here Virgil has the Hundred-Hander as having fought on the side of the Titans rather than the Olympians, as in the Titanomachy,O'Hara, p. 99; West 2002, pp. 111-112. with the additional descriptive details of the fifty fire-breathing mouths and breasts, and the fifty sets of sword and shield, perhaps also coming from that lost poem.West 2002, p. 112. =Ovid= The late first-century BC Latin poet Ovid, makes several references to the Hundred- Handers Briareus and Gyges in his poems. Briareus figures in a story that Ovid tells in his Fasti about how \\"The star of the Kite\\" (presumably a star or constellation named after the bird) came to reside in the heavens.Ovid, Fasti 3.793-808. According to Ovid, there was a monstrous offspring of \\"mother Earth\\", part bull, part serpent, about which it had been prophesied that whoever burned its entrails would be able to conquer the gods. Warned by the three Fates, Styx penned up the bull in \\"gloomy woods\\" surrounded by three walls. After the Titans were overthrown, Briareus (whom Ovid appears to regard as a Titan, or Titan ally)Heyworth, p. 248 on 8.805-8; Frazer, p. 143 on 3.805. \\"sacrificed\\" the bull with an adamantine axe. But when he was about to burn the entrails, the birds, as commanded by Jupiter (Zeus), snatched them away, and were rewarded with a home among the stars. In his Metamorphoses, Ovid describes Aegaeon (the Iliad's Briareus) as a \\"dark-hued\\" sea god \\"whose strong arms can overpower huge whales\\".Ovid, Metamorphoses 2.8-10. In both of these poems, Ovid appears to be following the same tradition as in the lost Titanomachy, where Aegaeon was the sea god son of Pontus and a Titan ally.Eumelus fr. 3 West [= Schol. on Apollonius of Rhodes 1.1165c]; West 2002, p. 111 with n. 10; Heyworth, p. 248 on 8.805-8. Besides in the Titanomachy, the Hundred-Handers were already fighting against the Olympians in Virgil's Aeneid 6.282-294, and Ovid's Amores 2.1.11-18 (see below). Ovid mentions \\"Gyas of the hundred hands\\" in his Amores, when \\"Earth made her ill attempt at vengeance, and steep Ossa, with shelving Pelion on its back, was piled upon Olympus.\\"Ovid, Amores 2.1.11-18. In his Fasti, Ovid has Ceres (Demeter), complaing about the abduction of her daughter, say: \\"What worse wrong could I have suffered if Gyges had been victorious and I his captive.\\"Ovid, Fasti 4.593. In both of these poems Ovid has apparently confused the hundred-handers with the Giants (a different set of monstrous offspring of Gaia) who tried to storm Olympus in the Gigantomachy.Artley, p. 20; Frazer's note to Ovid, Fasti 4.593. Ovid perhaps also confused the Hundred-Handers with the Giants in his Metamorphoses, where he refers to the Giants having tried to \\"fix their hundred arms on captive Heaven\\".Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.182-184; Anderson, p. 170, note to line 184 \\"centum with bracchia\\". Ovid also refers to \\"a hundred- handed Gyes\\" in his Tristia.Ovid, Tristia 4.7.18. According to West 1966, p. 210 on line 149 ŒìœçŒ≥Œ∑œÇ, \\"Gyges ... should be preferred\\" here, as in Fasti 4.593. =Apollodorus= The mythographer Apollodorus, gives an account of the Hundred-Handers similar to that of Hesiod's, but with several significant differences.Hard, pp. 68-69; Gantz, pp. 2, 45. As for Apollodorus' sources, Hard, p. 68, says that Apollodorus' version \\"perhaps derived from the lost Titanomachia or from the Orphic literature\\"; see also Gantz, p. 2; for a detailed discussion of Apollodorus' sources for his account of the early history of the gods, see West 1983, pp. 121-126. According to Apollodorus, they were the first offspring of Uranus and Gaia, (unlike Hesiod who makes the Titans the eldest) followed by the Cyclopes, and the Titans.Apollodorus, 1.1.1-3. Apollodorus describes the Hundred-Handers as \\"unsurpassed in size and might, each of them having a hundred hands and fifty heads.\\"Apollodorus, 1.1.1. Uranus bound the Hundred-Handers and the Cyclopes, and cast them all into Tartarus, \\"a gloomy place in Hades as far distant from earth as earth is distant from the sky.\\" But the Titans are, apparently, allowed to remain free (unlike in Hesiod).Hard, p. 68; Apollodorus, 1.1.2. When the Titans overthrew Uranus, they freed the Hundred-Handers and Cyclopes (unlike in Hesiod where they remain imprisoned), and made Cronus their sovereign.Apollodorus, 1.1.4. But Cronus once again bound the six brothers, and reimprisoned them in Tartarus.Apollodorus, 1.1.5. The release and reimprisonment of the Hundred- Handers and Cyclopes, was perhaps a way to solve the problem in Hesiod's account of why the castration of Uranus, which released the Titans, did not also apparently release the six brothers, see Fowler 2013, p. 26; West 1966, p. 206 on lines on lines 139-53. As in Hesiod's account, Cronus swallowed his children; but Zeus, who was saved by Rhea, freed his siblings, and together they waged war against the Titans.Apollodorus, 1.1.5-1.2.1. According to Apollodorus, in the tenth year of the war, Zeus learned from Gaia, that to win he needed both the Hundred-Handers and the Cyclopes, so Zeus slew their warder Campe and released them: =Others= The fifth-century BC philosopher Plato, in his dialogue Laws, mentions, in passing, \\"Briareus, with his hundred hands\\".Plato, Laws 795.c. The first-century AD Latin poet Horace, twice mentions \\"centimanus\\" ('hundred-handed') Gyges. In one poem Gyges and the \\"fiery Chimaera\\" are given as examples of fearsome creatures.Anderson, p. 170, note to line 184 \\"centum with bracchia\\"; Horace, 2.17.13-14. In another poem, Gyges is used as an example of \\"power\\" hated by the gods \\"that devises every kind of evil in its heart.\\"Horace, 3.4.69. According to the second-century AD geographer Pausanias, a Corinthian legend said that Briareus was the arbitrator in a dispute between Poseidon and Helios (Sun) over some land. Briareus adjudged that the Isthmus of Corinth belonged to Poseidon and the acropolis of Corinth (Acrocorinth) to Helios.Pausanias, 2.1.6, 2.4.6. Servius, the late fourth-century, early fifth-century AD commentator on Virgil, also seems to know of two versions of the Titanomachy, one in which the Hundred- Handers fought on the side of the Olympians, as in Hesiod, and the other in which they fought on the side of the Titans, as in the lost Titanomachy.West 2002, p. 112; Servius, On Aeneid 6.287, 10.565.

The department operates prisons and jails in Jamaica. The current Commissioner of Corrections is Ina Hunter. Operations A male inmate who has served one year in prison and has no more than nine months left in his sentence may apply to stay in the Howard Hostel in Kingston; the inmate may work during the day, but he must stay in the hostel from 7 PM to 7 AM. Hostel services are not available for female inmates. In Jamaica juvenile facilities house children from ages 12 to 17. Prisons There is a total of eleven facilities on the island. Due to sentencing laws, the majority of inmates are held at the two maximum security facilities. These facilities are St. Catherine Adult Correctional Centre and Tower Street Adult Correctional Centre. While the lower security facilities are below capacity, these two facilities regularly hold high above their maximum capacity. The high population in some of the facilities and lack of funding has led to substandard living conditions. Many of the inmates are held inn cells that are infested with fleas, lice, and cockroaches. As many of these cells are only designed to hold one or two individuals, any additional inmates are forced to sleep on the floor. They are often only allowed out of their cells twice a day to visit the washroom. Despite an effort for reform, corruption in the prison system allows guards to abuse inmates, sometimes to the point of death. In early 2017 the South Camp facility became the new women‚Äôs facility. The women were moved there from the aging Ft. Augusta facility. The women‚Äôs facility faces many of the same issues of overcrowding, poor living conditions, and abuse that the other facilities do. Jamaica has made great effort to improve the juvenile side of their corrections system. Their four juvenile facilities are run like schools. The children are offered education and vocational training that will give them more job opportunities as adults. Unlike the adult facilities, the youth are allowed to occasionally leave the facility with special permission. Juvenile boys ages 12‚Äì17 are initially sent to St. Andrew Remand Centre. At the disposal of their court cases, they are sent to Hill Top Juvenile Correctional Centre or Rio Cobre Juvenile Correctional Centre, the two residential prisons for boys. All juvenile females ages 12‚Äì17 are sent to the Armadale Juvenile Correctional Centre.

The business began as two separate entities (Ferguson's Cakes and Plarre's Cakes) with the families coming together to form Ferguson Plarre Bakehouses in 1980. Ferguson Plarre now has 76 stores across Victoria. In 2012, members of the Plarre family bought out the Ferguson's stake and it is now owned by Ralph Plarre (40%), Steve Plarre (25%), Mike Plarre (25%) and their independent chairman, Rod Douglas (10%). Steve Plarre is CEO.\\"You can't unbake a business\\" by Alan Kohler, The Age, 7 November 2013. Retrieved 7 November 2013. The bakery's family history has links to many of Melbourne's culinary institutions (such as Jimmy Watsons). One of its best-known outlets is in Melbourne's Queen Victoria Market, where locals have purchased the bakery's cakes and pastries for decades. Ferguson Plarre has won over 100 awards for its baked goods including a gold medal in the Official Great Aussie Pastie Competition 2016 for their Traditional Steak & Potato Tiddly Oggie, \\"Australia's Champion Dairy Dessert\\" as judged at the Australian Grand Dairy Awards (Chocolate Moussecake) Overall Cake and Pastry winner at the Victorian Baking Industry Awards as judged by BIAV. In addition to these awards Ferguson Plarre has been recognised for its response to climate change through sustainable baking and business practices. In 2007 the bakery opened its environmentally friendly central baking facility in Keilor Park. There, the tier 1 and 2 emissions from every good baked is carbon offset. This offset is achieved by the planting of trees as part of the ‚ÄòFerguson Plarre Forest‚Äô. 2009 saw Ferguson Plarre's environmental action rewarded with the Origin Gold Banksia Award for excellence in sustainability. __TOC__  History  Ferguson Plarre Bakehouses is a family owned and operated business. The Fergusons commenced their bakery business in 1901 and the Plarres in 1911. Both businesses focused mostly in the Northern and Western suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. After decades as separate businesses they merged in 1980 to become 'Ferguson Plarre Bakehouses'. The Ferguson family exited the business in 2012 and Plarre family members now run it.  Sustainability  Ferguson Plarre supports sustainable business practices. This has influenced the design and construction of a sustainable central baking facility in Keilor Park where 100% of their tier 1 and 2 carbon emissions are offset through tree planting. In addition to their sustainable baking facility, Ferguson Plarre has planted trees to offset greenhouse gas emissions at Mt Worth which is in Victoria, Australia, 15 km south of Warragul. All suppliers to Ferguson Plarre must meet minimum sustainability requirements as established through the company's Sustainable Purchasing Questionnaire. In collaboration with Sustainability Victoria, Ferguson Plarre Bakehouses launched the first hybrid truck to hit Victoria's streets. Ferguson Plarre's sustainable practices have received a number of awards in relevant sectors.

His aim was to help humanity achieve a collective memory with such a machine and avoid the use of scientific discoveries for destruction and war Douglas Engelbart in 2008, at the 40th anniversary celebrations of \\"The Mother of All Demos\\" in San Francisco, a 90-minute 1968 presentation of the NLS computer system which was a combination of hardware and software that demonstrated many hypertext ideas Hypertext is text displayed on a computer or other electronic device with references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can immediately access, usually by a mouse click or keypress sequence. Early conceptions of hypertext defined it as text that could be connected by a linking system to a range of other documents that were stored outside that text. In 1934 Belgian bibliographer, Paul Otlet, developed a blueprint for links that telescoped out from hypertext electrically to allow readers to access documents, books, photographs, and so on, stored anywhere in the world. History Recorders of information have long looked for ways to categorize and compile it. There are various methods of arranging layers of references/annotations within a document. Other reference works (for example dictionaries, encyclopaedias) also developed a precursor to hypertext: the setting of certain words in small capital letters, indicating that an entry existed for that term within the same reference work. Sometimes the term would be preceded by an index, ‚òûlike this, or an arrow, ‚ûßlike this. Janet Murray has referenced Jorge Luis Borges' \\"The Garden of Forking Paths\\" as a precursor to the hypertext novel and aesthetic:\\"Inventing the Medium\\", Janet H. Murray > \\"The concept Borges described in 'The Garden of Forking Paths'‚Äîin several > layers of the story, but most directly in the combination book and maze of > Ts'ui Pen‚Äîis that of a novel that can be read in multiple ways, a hypertext > novel.

The New > Media Reader. (29). The MIT Press. . Umberto Eco has also referenced Finnegans Wake in the same way. Later, several scholars entered the scene who believed that humanity was drowning in information, causing foolish decisions and duplicating efforts among scientists. These scholars proposed or developed proto-hypertext systems predating electronic computer technology. For example, in the early 20th century, two visionaries attacked the cross-referencing problem through proposals based on labor-intensive, brute force methods. Paul Otlet proposed a proto-hypertext concept based on his monographic principle, in which all documents would be decomposed down to unique phrases stored on index cards. In the 1930s, H.G. Wells proposed the creation of a World Brain. Michael Buckland summarized the very advanced pre-World War II development of microfilm based on rapid retrieval devices, specifically the microfilm based workstation proposed by Leonard Townsend in 1938 and the microfilm and photoelectronic based selector, patented by Emanuel Goldberg in 1931.Buckland, Michael K. \\"Emanuel Goldberg, Electronic Document Retrieval, And Vannevar Bush's Memex\\", 1992 Buckland concluded: \\"The pre-war information retrieval specialists of continental Europe, the 'documentalists,' largely disregarded by post-war information retrieval specialists, had ideas that were considerably more advanced than is now generally realized.\\" But, like the manual index card model, these microfilm devices provided rapid retrieval based on pre-coded indices and classification schemes published as part of the microfilm record without including the link model which distinguishes the modern concept of hypertext from content or category based information retrieval. =The Memex= All major histories of what we now call hypertext start in 1945, when Vannevar Bush wrote an article in The Atlantic Monthly called \\"As We May Think\\", about a futuristic device he called a Memex. He described the device as an electromechanical desk linked to an extensive archive of microfilms, able to display books, writings, or any document from a library. The Memex would also be able to create 'trails' of linked and branching sets of pages, combining pages from the published microfilm library with personal annotations or additions captured on a microfilm recorder. Bush's vision was based on extensions of 1945 technology‚Äîmicrofilm recording and retrieval in this case. However, the modern story of hypertext starts with the Memex because \\"As We May Think\\" directly influenced and inspired the two American men generally credited with the invention of hypertext, Ted Nelson and Douglas Engelbart. =The invention of hypertext= Ted Nelson gives a presentation on Project Xanadu, a theoretical hypertext model conceived in the 1960s, whose first and incomplete implementation was first published in 1998 Starting in 1963, Ted Nelson developed a model for creating and using linked content he called \\"hypertext\\" and \\"hypermedia\\" (first published reference 1965). Ted Nelson said in the 1960s that he began implementation of a hypertext system he theorized which was named Project Xanadu, but his first and incomplete public release was finished much later, in 1998. He later worked with Andries van Dam to develop the Hypertext Editing System (HES) in 1967 at Brown University. HES was the first hypertext system available on commercial equipment that novices could use, and it didn't have arbitrary limits on text lengths. Douglas Engelbart independently began working on his NLS system in 1962 at Stanford Research Institute, although delays in obtaining funding, personnel, and equipment meant that its key features were not completed until 1968. In December of that year, Engelbart demonstrated a hypertext interface to the public for the first time, in what has come to be known as \\"The Mother of All Demos\\". Funding for NLS slowed after 1974. Andries van Dam Later in 1968, van Dam's team incorporated ideas from NLS into a successor to HES: the File Retrieval and Editing System (FRESS), which was the first hypertext system to run on readily-available commercial hardware and OS.Steven DeRose and Andries van Dam. \\"Document structure and markup in the FRESS hypertext system\\" (sometimes cited as \\"The Lost Books of Hypertext\\"). In *Markup Technology* Vol. 1, Issue 1 - Winter 1999. Cambridge: MIT Press. https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=313600 The user interface was simpler than NLS. By 1976 FRESS received NEH funding and was used in a poetry class in which students could browse and annotate a hyperlinked set of poems and discussion by experts, faculty and other students, in what was arguably the first online scholarly community, which van Dam says \\"foreshadowed wikis, blogs and communal documents of all kinds\\". Influential work in the following decade included NoteCards at Xerox PARC and ZOG at Carnegie Mellon. ZOG started in 1972 as an artificial intelligence research project under the supervision of Allen Newell, and pioneered the \\"frame\\" or \\"card\\" model of hypertext. ZOG was deployed in 1982 on the U.S.S. Carl Vinson and later commercialized as Knowledge Management System. Two other influential hypertext projects from the early 1980s were Ben Shneiderman's The Interactive Encyclopedia System (TIES) at the University of Maryland (1983) and Intermedia at Brown University (1984). =Early hypertext applications= The first hypermedia application was the Aspen Movie Map in 1978. In 1980, Tim Berners- Lee created ENQUIRE, an early hypertext database system somewhat like a wiki. The early 1980s also saw a number of experimental hypertext and hypermedia programs, many of whose features and terminology were later integrated into the Web. Guide was the first significant hypertext system for personal computers. In 1983, a hypermedia authoring tool, Tutor-Tech, designed for Apple II computers, was produced for educators. In August 1987, Apple Computer released HyperCard for the Macintosh line at the MacWorld convention. Its impact, combined with interest in Peter J. Brown's GUIDE (marketed by OWL and released earlier that year) and Brown University's Intermedia, led to broad interest in and enthusiasm for hypertext and new media. The first ACM Hypertext academic conference took place in November 1987, in Chapel Hill NC, where many other applications, including the hypertext literature writing software Storyspace were also demoedHawisher, Gail E., Paul LeBlanc, Charles Moran, and Cynthia L. Selfe (1996). Computers and the Teaching of Writing in American Higher Education, 1979-1994: A History Ablex Publishing Corporation, Norwood NJ, p. 213 Meanwhile, Nelson, who had been working on and advocating his Xanadu system for over two decades, along with the commercial success of HyperCard, stirred Autodesk to invest in his revolutionary ideas. The project continued at Autodesk for four years, but no product was released. van Dam's research groups at Brown University continued working as well. For example, in the late '70s Steve Feiner and others developed an ebook system for Navy repair manuals, and in the early '80s Norm Meyrowitz and a large team at Brown's Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship built Intermedia (mentioned above), which was heavily used in humanities and literary computing. In '89 van Dam's helped Lou Reynolds and van Dam's former students Steven DeRose and Jeff Vogel spun off Electronic Book Technologies, whose SGML-based hypertext system DynaText was widely used for large online publishing and e-book projects, such as online documentation for Sun, SGI, HP, Novell, and DEC, as well as aerospace, transport, publishing, and other applications. Brown's Center For Digital Scholarship (n√©e Scholarly Technology Group) was heavily involved in related standards efforts such as the Text Encoding Initiative, Open eBook and XML, as well as enabling a wide variety of humanities hypertext projects. =Hypertext and the World Wide Web= In the late 1980s, Berners-Lee, then a scientist at CERN, invented the World Wide Web to meet the demand for simple and immediate information-sharing among physicists working at CERN and different universities or institutes all over the world. In 1992, Lynx was born as an early Internet web browser. Its ability to provide hypertext links within documents that could reach into documents anywhere on the Internet began the creation of the Web on the Internet. Early in 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois released the first version of their Mosaic web browser to supplement the two existing web browsers: one that ran only on NeXTSTEP and one that was only minimally user-friendly. Because it could display and link graphics as well as text, Mosaic quickly became the replacement for Lynx. Mosaic ran in the X Window System environment, which was then popular in the research community, and offered usable window-based interactions. It allowed imagesWWW-Talk Jan-Mar 1993: Re: proposed new tag: IMG as well as text to anchor hypertext links. It also incorporated other protocols intended to coordinate information across the Internet, such as Gopher.WWW-Talk Jan-Mar 1993: Support for CSO and gopher type 2 After the release of web browsers for both the PC and Macintosh environments, traffic on the World Wide Web quickly exploded from only 500 known web servers in 1993 to over 10,000 in 1994. Thus, all earlier hypertext systems were overshadowed by the success of the Web, even though it originally lacked many features of those earlier systems, such as an easy way to edit what you were reading, typed links, backlinks, transclusion, and source tracking. In 1995, Ward Cunningham made the first wiki available, making the Web more hypertextual by adding easy editing, and (within a single wiki) backlinks and limited source tracking. It also added the innovation of making it possible to link to pages that did not yet exist.

In total there are 200 apartments in Taft, housed in separate wood framed buildings. The Taft Homes are currently in the early stages of a redevelopment project that calls for the demolition of all current units, with the lots then transformed into mixed-income housing. History The Taft Homes were originally built in 1952 as a temporary means of shelter for veterans returning from the Korean War. The buildings soon transitioned to low income housing and during the 1960s and 70s the housing project saw multiple violent riots. In 1968 ten police officers and a reporter were wounded after a minor incident turned into a race riot that lasted for around 3 hours. A second major race riot occurred in 1970 after the police evicted two female residents from the Taft Homes; resulting in rioting that spread throughout other public housing projects in the city. In 1996 all 220 units in the complex underwent comprehensive rehabilitation efforts by the city; the units received new siding, flooring and plumbing in order to make the buildings more energy efficient. The renovation efforts also added, and updated parking, lighting, sidewalks as well as various landscaping work. Durings its modernization effort the Housing Authority decided to demolish the 15 buildings closest to the river, that were known for illicit activities. The United States Marine Corps, U.S. Navy Seabees and Illinois Air National Guard helped in the demolition effort. =Redevelopment plan= Following the rehabilitation project of 1996 Peoria Public Housing decided to pursue a redevelopment of the units.

His nom de plume for two books was Isaac Bl√ºmchen. Orphaned as a young man, Gohier took the surname of his adoptive father, and the issue of his family origin remained a lifelong personal issue. A brilliant high school student at Coll√®ge Stanislas in Paris, he obtained a BA and a law degree. In 1884, he became editor of the royalist daily Le Soleil. In 1897, upon the foundation of the socialist daily L'Aurore, its director Ernest Vaughan called Gohier to join the writing team. He became a leading journalist there, along with Georges Clemenceau. An indefatigable pamphleteer, Gohier - a \\"monarchist- unionist\\" - maintained a policy that was pro-Dreyfus, anti-Semitic, anti- militarist, and socialist. He took a strongly anti-military position in the Dreyfus affair. Perhaps because his willingness to stand up for justice was stronger than his anti-Semitism, √âmile Zola was one of his friends. He provoked the resignation of Clemenceau from L'Aurore. In 1898, he was prosecuted after the publication of the anti-militarist pamphlet L'arm√©e contre la nation (The Army Against the Nation); he was ultimately acquitted. In December 1905 he was sentenced to a year in prison for his participation in an international anti-militarist action allied with anarchists. At the turn of the century, he joined the neo-Malthusian movement alongside Paul Robin, Andr√© Girard, Clovis Hugues, Albert Lantoine, A. Daud√©-Bancel, Laurent Tailhade, and George Yvetot. Gohier edited the newspaper Grenoble The Right of the People in 1902, then The Old Friar in 1903 and the Cri de Paris in 1904, then became editor of the anti-Semitic Vieille France from 1916 to 1924. Gohier was also a leading publisher of the anti-Semitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion in France, circa 1920. He also contributed to The Libertarian. During World War II, Gohier supported the Vichy government. Convicted in 1944, he died in oblivion in 1951, leaving a considerable body of pamphleteering along with other such anti-Semitic polemicists of his time as √âdouard Drumont, L√©on Daudet, Henri B√©raud, Dominique Pierre and Ren√© Benjamin.

They typically lived in the monastic communities that began forming during that time, though sometimes they lived as hermits. Other women from that era who influenced the early ascetic or monastic tradition while living outside the desert are also described as Desert Mothers. The Desert Fathers are much more well known because most of the early lives of the saints \\"were written by men for a male monastic audience\\"‚Äîthe occasional stories about the Desert Mothers come from the early Desert Fathers and their biographers. Many desert women had leadership roles within the Christian community. The Apophthegmata Patrum, or Sayings of the Desert Fathers, includes forty-seven sayings that are actually attributed to the Desert Mothers. There are several chapters dedicated to the Desert Mothers in the Lausiac History by Palladius, who mentions 2,975 women living in the desert. Other sources include the various stories told over the years about the lives of saints of that era, traditionally called vitae (\\"life\\"). The lives of twelve female desert saints are described in Book I of Vitae Patrum (Lives of the Fathers). Notable examples Melania the Younger, from the Menologion of Basil II Syncletica of Alexandria from the Menologion of Basil II The Desert Mothers were known as ammas (\\"spiritual mothers\\"), comparable to the Desert Fathers (abbas), due to the respect they earned as spiritual teachers and directors. One of the most well known Desert Mothers was Amma Syncletica of Alexandria, who had twenty-seven sayings attributed to her in the Sayings of the Desert Fathers. Two other ammas, Theodora of Alexandria and Amma Sarah of the Desert, also had sayings in that book. Desert Mothers described in the Lausiac History include Melania the Elder, Melania the Younger, Olympias, Saint Paula and her daughter Eustochium, and several women whom the author does not name. According to written accounts, Amma Syncletica might have been born around AD 270, since she is said to have lived to her eighties in about AD 350, to wealthy parents in Alexandria and was well educated, including an early study of the writings of Desert Father Evagrius Ponticus. After the death of her parents, she sold everything she had and gave the money to the poor. Moving outside the city with her blind sister, she lived as a hermit among the tombs outside of Alexandria. Gradually a community of women ascetics grew up around her, who she served as their spiritual mother. Even though she was an ascetic and hermit, Syncletica taught moderation, and that asceticism was not an end in itself. Theodora of Alexandria was the amma of a monastic community of women near Alexandria. Prior to that, she had fled to the desert disguised as a man and joined a community of monks. She was sought out by many of the Desert Fathers for advice‚Äîreportedly Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria came to her for counsel. Sarah of the Desert's sayings indicate that she was a hermit living by a river for sixty years. Her sharp replies to some of the old men who challenged her show a distinctly strong personality. According to one story, two male anchorites visited her in the desert and decided, \\"Let's humiliate this old woman.\\" They said to her, \\"Be careful not to become conceited thinking to yourself: \\"Look how anchorites are coming to see me, a mere woman.\\" She replied, \\"According to nature I am a woman, but not according to my thoughts.\\" Melania the Elder, the daughter of a Roman official, became widowed at a young age and moved to Alexandria, and then to the Nitrian Desert. She met several of the Desert Fathers, following them in their travels and ministering to them using her own money. At one point she was thrown into prison for supporting them, after several of the Fathers had been banished by the officials in Palestine. She eventually founded a convent in Jerusalem which had about fifty nuns. Her granddaughter, Melania the Younger, was married at the age of thirteen and had two sons, both of whom died at a young age. When she was twenty, she and her husband Pinianus renounced the world, both founding convents and monasteries. According to Averil Cameron, women were quite prominent in the desert tradition, even though early accounts often leave women nameless. In Cameron‚Äôs opinion there is no distinction between the men‚Äôs wise sayings and that of Amma Sarah and Amma Syncletia. One text refers to Theodora, who had monks listening to her counsel and asking questions. Some women converted their houses into religious establishments and there were gender-mixed social/religious groups. Women could not obtain ordination as a deacon or a priest. Sayings *Amma Sarah said, \\"If I prayed God that all people should approve of my conduct, I should find myself a penitent at the door of each one, but I shall rather pray that my heart may be pure toward all.\\" *Amma Syncletica said, \\"In the beginning there are a great many battles and a good deal of suffering for those who are advancing towards God and afterwards, ineffable joy. It is like those who wish to light a fire; at first they are choked by the smoke and cry, and by this means obtain what they seek ... so we must also kindle the divine fire in ourselves through tears and hard work.\\" *Amma Syncletica said, \\"There are many who live in the mountains and behave as if they were in the town; they are wasting their time. It is possible to be a solitary in one's mind while living in a crowd; and it is possible for those who are solitaries to live in the crowd of their own thoughts.\\" *Amma Theodora said that neither asceticism, nor vigils, nor any kind of suffering are able to save. Only true humility can do that. There was a hermit who was able to banish the demons. And he asked them: \\"What makes you go away? Is it fasting?\\" They replied: \\"We do not eat or drink.\\" \\"Is it vigils?\\" They said: \\"We do not sleep.\\" \\"Then what power sends you away?\\" They replied: \\"Nothing can overcome us except humility alone.\\" Amma Theodora said: \\"Do you see how humility is victorious over the demons?\\" See also * Blaesilla * Catherine of Alexandria * Christian monasticism * Demiana * Domnina of Syria * Eastern Christian monasticism * John Chryssavgis * Macrina the Elder * Macrina the Younger * Margaret the Virgin * Mary of Egypt * Melania the Younger * Menodora, Metrodora, and Nymphodora * Saint Pelagia * Sarah of the Desert * Syncletica of Alexandria * Theoktiste of Lesbos References =Citations= =Works cited= : : : : : : : : : =Further reading= : * Asceticism Christian monasticism Christian orders Christian religious occupations Christian terminology Egyptian hermits Late Ancient Christian female saints ","title":"Desert Mothers"},{"id":"29034136","text":"The Ministry of National Security (MNS) is a statutory under the government of Jamaica.

It was targeted at children between the ages of 12-17 years who had been exposed to the Department of Correctional Services (DCS), employing educational training and personality building skills in order to transform them into productive citizens. Amidst the goals was to contribute a decrease in youth offending and recidivism and in turn build self-esteem, imbue a sense of purpose and advocate good virtues.

In conjunction with this it has listed ten major policy elements to be undertaken. Citizen Safety and Security is the primary objective with the reduction of the threat of crime and violence throughout Jamaica being the integral goal. Public Order is another element which will dictate how the ministry controls the way people operate and conduct business within the public domain and in order to achieve this the ministry seeks to introduce new laws, regulations, establish entertainment zones and enhance stability in public transport. Corruption is also a major element within the ministry‚Äôs plan to revamp the Jamaican community through demolishing engrained structures and procedures for selfish benefit and gain that would not otherwise accrue. Community Safety is planned to be reinvigorated by introducing positive leadership and comprehensive planning at the local level in place of the illegitimate systems of governance currently thriving. Territorial Integrity is also a vital element within the ministry‚Äôs policy prioritisation as it looks to assure the preservation and command of Jamaica‚Äôs marine, air and land space for the benefit of all citizens. Crisis Response and Resilience which will endeavour to develop and reaffirm Jamaica‚Äôs ability to survive disasters of any nature through the establishment of government protocol and a national risk management strategy. Education although not pertinent under the ministry‚Äôs purviews, it is an essential policy element as a lack of essential education is one of the root causes of lawlessness and violence. This is due to its role in cultivating poor conflict resolution management, and unskilled, unemployed individuals, which lead to the proliferation of gangs and criminality. Cyber security encompasses the safeguarding of confidential business and state information as it is a fundamental aspect of maintaining a prosperous Jamaica. Critical Infrastructure Protection, which involves ensuring crucial infrastructure is safe and secure including the country‚Äôs water and electricity supplies, hospitals and government installations.

During the action, the American submarine attacked three Imperial Japanese warships anchored off Kiska island. It was the first action of Growlers career and ended with the loss of dozens of Japanese sailors. Background Over the course of the Pacific War, Growler‚Äîunder various commanders‚Äîsank 17 enemy vessels, including many armed ships. She was a and had a complement of 60 officers and men. Her armament included ten torpedo tubes and one /50-caliber deck gun. On her first patrol from Pearl Harbor to Alaska, she was commanded by Lieutenant Commander Howard Gilmore. Japanese forces included the with 240 crewmen and six guns, several anti-aircraft guns, eight large torpedo tubes and 36 depth charges. There were also the two s and , each with about 200 men and mounting the same armament as Shiranui. The three vessels were assigned to the occupation of Kiska and had participated in the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Action Shiranui Imperial Japanese Navy and Imperial Japanese Army troops had occupied the island since 6 June 1942 and had met little resistance. The following action proved to be the deadliest encounter between the opposing forces in the Kiska area. Growler was cruising east of Kiska Harbor naval base when she came across the three Japanese destroyers at anchor a fair distance away. Submerged, the submarine closed on the enemy and launched a spread of torpedoes from her six forward torpedo tubes at a position in which the enemy vessels appeared to be overlapping one another. Growler then surfaced. The Japanese were completely unaware of Lieutenant Commander Gilmore's attack, of the six torpedoes fired, at least three struck their targets. Two of the destroyers were hit amidship almost simultaneously and were severely damaged. Just before the third destroyer was hit in the bow, it maneuvered and fired two torpedoes of her own. Growler was almost destroyed when one of the torpedoes swished by just off her port side and the other off her starboard. Both missed their target though so the Americans dived deep to avoid depth charges and escaped. Japanese forces did not continue the battle however, Arare exploded, so Shiranui moved to rescue the survivors while Kasumi was out of action. Over 200 Japanese naval personnel were killed or wounded. Of Arares 200 man complement, only 42 men were saved by Shiranui, while the Americans sustained no damage or casualties. Aftermath Kasumi Finding no more enemy ships in Aleutian waters, Growler returned to Hawaii and ended her first patrol. For his distinguished leadership, Howard Gilmore was promoted to the rank of commander and received the Navy Cross. Gilmore was later killed off the Bismarcks during the Action of 7 February 1943 when he rammed Growler into a Japanese gunboat. In a quick surface action, Commander Gilmore was wounded by machine gun fire and ordered his ship to submerge while he was still on deck. The commander became the first of seven American submariners to be awarded the Medal of Honor for duty in World War II. Growler went on the engage in nine more successful patrols in the Pacific.

Biography Juan Antonio was born somewhere in the vicinity of Mt. San Jacinto in 1783. In 1840, the Ute leader Walkara led a great raid through the Cajon Pass into Southern California to capture a large number of horses from the Mexican ranchos. In some of these raids, his raiders clashed with Juan Antonio and the Cahuilla Mountain Band. In 1842, Juan Antonio greeted the explorer Daniel Sexton and gave him access to explore the area near the San Gorgonio Pass. Following Walkara's raid, Jose Carmen del Lugo invited New Mexican colonists to settle in Politana to in exchange for defending his Rancho San Bernardino and its herds of horses and cattle from raids by bandits and Native American raiders. Following a dispute with the Lugo's the New Mexicans moved south to build the settlements of Agua Mansa and La Placita de Trujillo on the Rancho Jurupa. Chief Juan Antonio was then invited to move a group of his Cahuilla Mountain Band to Politana in their place. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Chief Juan Antonio led his warriors to join Californios led by Jose Carmen del Lugo in attacking their traditional enemy, the Luise√±o. Lugo led this action in retaliation for the Pauma Massacre, in which the Luiseno had killed 11 Californios. The combined forces staged an ambush and killed 33‚Äì40 of the Luiseno warriors, an event that became known as the Temecula Massacre of 1847. Juan Antonio also lent support to a U.S. Army expedition led by Lieutenant Edward Fitzgerald Beale, defending the party against attacks by Walkara and his band of Ute warriors. For his help Beale awarded him a pair of military epaulets, which he wore thereafter. In the summer of 1851, Juan Antonio and a group of his fellow tribesmen pursued and destroyed the outlaw Irving Gang in San Timoteo Canyon. This band of ruffians had stolen and robbed in the San Bernardino Valley including at the Rancho San Bernardino, near Juan Antonio's village of Politana. Acting on the orders of the Jose Carmen del Lugo, Justice of the Peace and proprietor of the rancho, whose house the brigands were looting at the time, the Cahuilla pursued them into the canyon and in a running fight chased them into a box canyon, surrounded and killed eleven of them with arrows. Working on the ranchos and hunting down native raiders and bandits was a role that Juan Antonio's people had played in the San Bernardino region under the Mexican authorities. Under American rule, they believed themselves duly authorized by the Justice of the Peace to carry out their actions as before. However, the newly arrived American settlers in Southern California resented the killing of white men by Indians and took it to be the beginning of an Indian uprising. A company of militia from San Diego was sent against them.All of what is now San Bernardino and Riverside Counties was part of San Diego County at that time. The Cahuilla fled to the mountains and discovering the truth of the matter, the leader of the militia, Major General Joshua H. Bean, restrained the militia from attacking the Cahuilla with difficulty, preventing a war. The Native Americans of Southern California, 1852.

Judge Benjamin Ignatius Hayes held a hearing and subsequently found their actions had legal justification. However the resentment of local Americans at the killing of fellow Americans led Juan Antonio to move his people away from white settlements in the valley to the mountains. Closely following the outcome of the Irving Gang incident, in late 1851, Juan Antonio, his warriors and their families, moved eastward from Politana, toward the San Gorgonio Pass and settled in a valley which branched off to the northeast from San Timoteo Canyon, at a village named Saahatpa. In November 1851, the Garra Revolt occurred, wherein the Cupe√±o leader Antonio Garra attempted to bring Juan Antonio into his revolt of native people in Southern California. Juan Antonio, friendly to the Californios and Americans, was instrumental in capturing Antonio Garra and turning him over to authorities helping to end that revolt. Juan Antonio and his people remained in Saahatpa until he and many of his people died in the smallpox epidemic that struck Southern California in 1862-1863. It reduced the once numerous Cahuilla, to a minority of the population in the region. Juan Antonio was buried at Saahatpa. His body was discovered there in a 1956 archeological expedition, identified by his epaulets and reburied with military honors.Carole A.

(1999). The Reptilian Renal Portal System - A Review Bulletin of the Association of Reptilian and Amphibian Veterinarians Vol. 9 No. 1 Description The main channel is the renal portal vein, developed from the posterior cardinal vein, which brings venous blood circulation from the tail and groin to the kidney, where it is shunted into a capillary network around the convoluted tubules. The blood then enters the renal vein, passing either through the subcardinal veins and into the posterior cardinal veins or through the posterior vena cava.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Anatomy Variations In lungfish and tetrapods, the renal portal vein is joined by a vein traveling upwards from the abdominal vein,Pet Plaec.com Retrieved November 20, 2015 which can bring venous blood from the hind limbs and ventral body wall into the renal portal system, or alternatively, enable blood from the tail and groin to pass into the hepatic portal system, already served by blood from the gut, via the hepatic portal vein, and from the hind legs and ventral body wall, via the abdominal vein. In fishes and salamanders, the renal portal vein branches and enters a capillary network very similar to the ones in the nephric portal system. In frogs and amniotes, metarterioles appear, with capillary networks connected to them, and sphincter muscles around the entrances to the capillaries. In birds, the system is very complex, with sphincters around the metarterioles themselves. In fishes and salamanders, due to the lack of metarterioles, all the blood passes through the capillaries. However, in frogs and amniotes, most of the blood usually passes through the metarterioles instead, although it can still be diverted through the capillary networks if need be. The system is completely abandoned in mammals, with the result that all the blood from the tail (if present), groin, pelvic area, and hind legs is forced to pass directly into the posterior vena cava, and the only blood passing out of the kidney through the renal vein is that that entered it through the renal artery. The subcardinals become the part of the posterior vena cava between the hepatic vein and the renal veins, and other portions become the internal gonadal (spermatic or ovarian) veins, and the suprarenal veins. The posterior cardinal veins become the veins of the pelvis, tail, and hind legs, and the part of the azygos vein that is closest to the heart.Romer, Alfred Sherwood (1989).

She made a successful operatic debut in Kassa, Hungary, (now Ko≈°ice, Slovakia) in Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia in 1847. After a few years on the road singing in K√∂nigsberg (1856‚Äì1857) and Potsdam (1857), she arrived at the Hamburgischerer Stadttheater where, among other roles, she received recognition for Valentine in Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots which became one of her starring roles.√ñsterreichisches Biographisches Lexikon (1815‚Äì1950) Here she met Richard Mulder (1822‚Äì1874), a Dutch musician and impresario whom she married in 1858.

The greatest anxiety prevails in musical circles concerning the new prima donna, Madame INEZ FABBRI, who is known to be great not only as a singer but as a lyric actress. Her admirers maintain that she is a new Jenny Lind, and the publics of Brazil, Peru and other South American States, even go further than that. In Rio Janteiro she was, preferred to LA GRANGE and LA GRUA, -- about whom there can be no mistake. On the 9th of April Mr. MARETZEK will commence operations, and then we shall both see and hear for ourselves. In the meantime we may satisfy public curiosity by stating that there is not the slightest doubt about Madame FABBRI being entitled to the place of honor among all the prime donne now in this country.\\" NYT (5 March 1860) Her highly acclaimed American debut was as Violetta in Verdi's La Traviata.\\"Madame FABBRI is the best Violetta we have had in this City. We say this without the slightest idea of underrating the excellencies of her predecessors. LA GRANGE was finished but cold; GAZZANIGA passionate but inartistic, and soon. Each singer illuminated a page of the story by some special flash of genius. Madame FABBRI lightens up the whole. In the first act she sings with the \\"joyaunce of rude strength; \\"in the second with, the broken accents of a sudden and stupifying calamity; in the third with the protesting vehemence of one wronged; in the fourth with the sunken tones of wretched because retrospective despair. Her perception of the emotional phases of the part are so varied and distinct, that a person seeing her in the first act, where she is all hilarity and voice, can form no idea of what she is in the last, where by consummate management she presents the spectra! and vocal wreck of her former self. The mezzo-voce by which this is effected is the best that we have heard in a singer of such prodigious power, and the acting with which it is accompanied, has not been surpassed in propriety, if it has even been exceeded in intensity.\\" NYT (13 April 1860) Shortly thereafter, she sang Elvira in Ernani in which The New York Times wrote that \\"she was more dramatic and powerful\\" [than in her role as Violetta] and \\"a dramatic actress of the first class\\". \\"Mme. Fabbri was called out twice after each act, and the finale to the third act was encored.\\"The newspaper also reported a near disaster when her dress caught on fire from the footlights. The baritone was able to extinguish the fire by folding the dress over the flames. \\"As it is, the lesson will not, we trust be thrown away on the proprietors of the Winter Garden. No footlight should be allowed to exist without a wire guard. Madame Fabbri's courage in an emergency which would have taxed the nerves of the strongest man, was extraordinary. She did not even break the continuity of the note she was singing, until compelled to do so by a torrent of applause.\\" NYT (17 April 1860) Her debut at the Winter Garden was followed by tours in the American Mid-West, Canada and the Caribbean Islands. She was especially well received in Puerto Rico but lost all her possessions in a fire. In 1862‚Äì1863, she and her husband returned to Europe on a tour. From May 1863 to March 1864, she sang thirty-seven performances at the Wiener Hofoper in roles which included Elvira and Leonore in Verdi's Ernani and Il Trovatore, Raquel in Hal√©vy's La Juive, and Alice and Berthe in Meyerbeer's Robert le diable and Le Proph√®te. From 1864‚Äì1871 they lived in Frankfurt am Main where Fabbri was engaged to sing at the Stadttheater in roles which included Elisabeth in Wagner's Tannh√§user. She was described by critics at this time as a soprano with a strong, clear voice suitable for both coloratura and dramatic roles. After a guest performance at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, she returned to New York in 1872 for an engagement with the Habelmann- Formes opera company. =San Francisco= Inez Fabbri in San Francisco in 1872 In 1872, she went to San Francisco with the company where she sang at the California Theatre. She and her husband settled there and from 1873 to 1874 they produced forty-three operas, staging the first production of Die Zauberfl√∂te in the city. Her husband founded a music school in San Francisco which she took over on his death in 1874. She continued to give concerts and to produce operas, many of which she performed in herself.

In general a strake is longer than it is wide, in contrast to a winglet or a moustache. Leading edge root extensions (LERX) are also sometimes referred to as wing strakes. Nose strakes On both supersonic and subsonic types, smaller strakes are sometimes applied to the forward fuselage to control the fuselage flow at high angles of attack; for example, the Concorde SST had small nose strakes \\"to get a better directional stability\\".Andr√© Peyrat- Armandy, Les avions de transport modernes et futurs, Teknea, 1997, p. 229 Wing strakes Double delta wing aircraft (Concorde, Tupolev Tu-144, Boeing 2707 SST project) featured a forward extended leading edge that may be considered as a wing strake; it provides the same additional vortex lift at high angle of attack by leading edge suction.Hoerner, Fluid Dynamic Lift, Double Delta Wings Nacelle strakes On jet aircraft where the engines are mounted in nacelles slung under the wings, strakes may be added to one or both sides of each nacelle to produce vortices that energize the airflow over the wings in times of high angle of attack, such as during takeoff and landing, thus improving wing effectiveness. Ventral strakes Socata TB-200 ventral strakes One or two ventral strakes are sometimes positioned under the fuselage, as large vortex generators, to provide a better tail surfaces efficiency. Typical examples can be seen on the SOCATA TB family or the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. Rear strakes‚Äîtail fins One or two large fins or strakes are sometimes positioned under the rear fuselage or below the empennage, to provide adequate stability at high angles of attack when the tail fin is shielded from the main airstream by the fuselage and/or the wing wake. Typical examples can be seen on the Piaggio P.180 Avanti, Learjet 60 and Beechcraft 1900D. The Grumman X-29 research aircraft had rear fuselage lateral fins or \\"Tail fins\\",In Hoerner Fluid Dynamic Lift, \\"Tail fins - Dorsal and others fins on fuselage\\" sometimes called strakes,Miller, J.; The X-Planes, 2nd Printing, Speciality Press (1985) continuous with the trailing edge of the main wing. This allowed the positioning of a rear control surface at the end of each fin. Together with the main and forward (canard) wing control surfaces, this effectively gave it a three-surface configuration. =Anti-spin strakes= DHC-1 Chipmunk Anti-spin leading edge strakes, or spin strakes, or antispin fillet Nasa TN D-6575, Summary of spin technology as related to the light general-aviation airplanes, fig. 10 may be placed at the tailplane roots of generally aerobatic aircraft, such as the de Havilland Tiger Moth (British version), Scottish Aviation Bulldog, and de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk.Daroll Stinton, The design of the aeroplane, Lateral and directional stability and spinning, p.461. Ventral or dorsal fins increasing the directional stability are also used as anti-spin devices. Munitions Certain air-deployed munitions, particularly \\"dumb\\" or unguided bombs, are often retrofitted with bolt-on strake sets. Designed as an open collar with strakes fitted to the outside face, these strake sets are used to alter and normalize the aerodynamics of the weapon, yielding greater accuracy. As most such munitions were manufactured with only tail-mounted stabilizer fins, the addition of longitudinal strakes proves a much cleaner flow of air around the weapon during its glide, reducing the tendency to yaw and improving terminal accuracy. Strakes are also often found on \\"smart\\" or guided munitions as an aid to the guidance system. By stabilizing the slipstream of air traveling over the weapon, the actions of control surfaces are much more predictable and precise, again improving the accuracy of the weapon.

He was a member of the secret revolutionary society turned revolutionary government Katipunan with his other siblings Ciriaco and Espiridiona. His eldest brother Andr√©s Bonifacio was one of the founders and, eventually, president of the Katipunan.  Family background and early life Procopio was the third of the six children of Santiago Bonifacio and Catalina de Castro. His siblings were Andres, Ciriaco, Troadio, Espiridiona and Maxima. During childhood he, with his other siblings, sold paper canes and fans made by their brother Andres for their living. Eventually, he was employed as a baggage porter in the government-owned Philippine National Railways until the revolution broke out. Marriage Procopio was said to have married a woman from Mindoro whom he met while organizing the Katipunan chapter in the island  Katipunan  Procopio became a member of Katipunan adopting the name Pisaw. He was responsible for the founding of Katipunan chapter in the island of Mindoro. With Andres Bonifacio, Candido Tirona, Emilio Jacinto and Pio Valenzuela they founded the Council of the Ancient Assignment in Kawit, Cavite. Procopio was led into light, which is a two part of such council. He was present during the Cry of Balintawak in August 1896 in Caloocan which signaled the start of the Philippine Revolution.  Revolution  Procopio fought the Spanish authorities side-by-side with his brothers Andres and Ciriaco. He was given the rank of Colonel. In December 1896, he and Ciriaco accompanied their brother Andres and wife Gregoria to Cavite through the invitation of Cavite's provincial head of the revolution Mariano Alvarez to mediate between the growing conflict of the two rival factions of the Katipunan in the province, that of Magdiwang headed by Alvarez and Magdalo headed by cousins Emilio and Baldomero Aguinaldo. The mediation turned out to be a lost cause for the Bonifacios. Andres Bonifacio who was recognized as the over-all leader of the revolution and of the Katipunan, was insulted and disrespected by a Magdalo officer. The revolutionary leadership of Andres Bonifacio then shifted to Emilio Aguinaldo who was elected as president through the Tejeros Convention.  Death  Due to the insults experienced by them from the Cavite revolutionary leaders, he and other leaders of the Katipunan signed the Acta de Tejeros, proclaiming that the Tejeros Convention had been disorderly, that its decisions were illegitimate and invalid. They opted to leave the province and go back to Manila or Morong. While they were leaving Cavite, they were the target of a surprise attack (ARREST ORDER due to Treason as initially evidenced by the ACTA de Tejeros itself) by Emilio Aguinaldo's men led by Gen. Agapito Bonzon and Gen. Jos√© Ignacio Paua due to some events while they were encamped in a village in Indang. Ciriaco was shot and died on the spot, while Procopio was beaten and Andres was shot in the arm and stabbed in the neck by Paua. The two remaining brothers were then brought to Naik for a trial, then to Maragondon, and were subjected to a court-martial as ordered by the war council under the new revolutionary government. They were sentenced to death. The two brothers were taken into the mountains. Procopio, 24 years old, was shot dead before Andres suffered the same fate.

The position was hereditary and passed down through his family, eventually becoming the fully independent Tangut state of Western Xia from the 11th to 13th centuries.  Background  It is not known when Tuoba Sigong was born. His family was of Tangut stock from the Pingxia () branch. Late in the Xiantong () era (861‚Äì874) of Emperor Yizong, he seized control of You Prefecture (ÂÆ•Â∑û, in modern Ordos, Inner Mongolia), which had been established by the Tang imperial government to govern the Tangut, and claimed the title of prefect.  Campaign against Huang Chao  Around new year 881, during the reign of Emperor Xizong, the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao attacked and captured the Tang imperial capital Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xizong to flee to Chengdu. Huang established a new state of Qi as its emperor. A number of Tang generals near Chang'an gathered their troops to prepare to attack Huang to recapture Chang'an. Tuoba Sigong gathered his own troops and went to Fu Prefecture (ÈÑúÂ∑û, in modern Yan'an, Shaanxi) to rendezvous with Li Xiaochang () the military governor of Fuyan Circuit (ÈÑúÂª∂, headquartered at Fu Prefecture). They swore an oath to attack Huang, and subsequently advanced south toward Chang'an. In light of Tuoba Sigong's display of loyalty, Emperor Xizong made him the acting military governor of Xiasui Circuit ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. Subsequently, with Tang forces gathered around Chang'an, Huang abandoned Chang'an. The forces under the Tang generals Tang Hongfu (), Cheng Zongchu (), and Wang Chucun entered the city, but did not notify Tuoba, Li Xiaochang, or Zheng Tian the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). The Tang forces that entered the city became bogged down in pillaging the city, and Qi forces counterattacked, crushing them and recapturing Chang'an. Subsequently, Qi forces engaged those under Tuoba and Li Xiaochang at Wangqiao (ÁéãÊ©ã, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), defeating them. Tuoba and Li Xiaochang nevertheless stayed in the area, and Huang sent his general Zhu Wen to defend against them. Soon thereafter, Emperor Xizong made Tuoba full military governor and renamed his circuit Dingnan Circuit (meaning, \\"those who stopped disaster\\"). Tuoba and Li Xiaogong then engaged Zhu and the major Qi general Shang Rang, but could not prevail, and withdrew. Subsequently, Tuoba was also made the acting mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the Chang'an region). However, the extent of his participation in the subsequent Tang victory over Huang is not known‚Äîalthough the Song Dynasty work the New History of the Five Dynasties, which referred to him as Tuoba Sijing in the biographies of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period military governors of Dingnan Circuit, for reasons unclear, had the semi- laudatory, semi-derogatory explanation that because Tuoba had neither great accomplishments nor rebellious acts against the imperial government, his deeds went largely unrecorded.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 40. After Huang was destroyed, Tuoba was created the Duke of Xia, and given the imperial surname of Li. At some point, he also apparently seized Fuyan Circuit, an act that later was referred to by Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258.  Death  In 886, after Emperor Xizong fled to Xingyuan (ËààÂÖÉ, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) due to a major dispute between the powerful eunuch Tian Lingzi (who controlled Emperor Xizong's court) and Li Keyong and Wang Chongrong the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), Tian's erstwhile ally Zhu Mei the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang) declared Emperor Xizong's distant relative Li Yun the Prince of Xiang the new emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. Emperor Xizong ordered Li Sigong to attack Zhu. Before Li Sigong could launch his troops, however, he died. Emperor Xizong gave Li Sigong's younger brothers Li Sijian Dingnan Circuit and Li Sixiao () Baoda Circuit (‰øùÂ§ß, i.e., Fuyan).

The origin of the Knights of the Hare At the beginning of the Hundred Years' War Edward III and Philip VI of France both assembled armies in France, but they did not engage in any decisive battle. On 23 October 1339, both armies were formed in sight of each other in the fields between La Flamengerie and Buironfosse, when a hare, caught in the field between them, started running towards the French lines. The French troops greeted the approaching hare with a lot of noise. Some troops at the rear of the French formation mistook the noise as a sign of an imminent English attack and prepared for battle. As a preparation for the battle the William II, Count of Hainaut quickly knighted 14 distinguished squires as was the common chivalric custom. However the English attack never came and, after the reason for that became clear, those knights became known as the Knights of the Hare. As the knights were created on the French side, it is doubtful however, whether Edward III really created a formal order for those knights.

It stars Michelle Williams, Kenneth Branagh, Eddie Redmayne, Dominic Cooper, Julia Ormond, Emma Watson, and Judi Dench. Based on two books by Colin Clark, it depicts the making of the 1957 film The Prince and the Showgirl, which starred Marilyn Monroe (Williams) and Laurence Olivier (Branagh). The film concerns the week during the shooting of the 1957 film when Monroe was escorted around London by Clark (Redmayne), after her husband Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) had returned to the United States. Principal photography began on 4 October 2010, at Pinewood Studios. Filming took place at Saltwood Castle, White Waltham Airfield, and on locations in and around London. Curtis also used the same studio in which Monroe had shot The Prince and the Showgirl in 1956. My Week with Marilyn had its world premiere at the New York Film Festival on 9 October 2011, and was shown at the Mill Valley Film Festival two days later. The film was released on 23 November 2011, in the United States, and on 25 November in the United Kingdom. For her portrayal of Monroe, Williams was awarded the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Motion Picture ‚Äì Comedy or Musical, and earned Best Actress nominations from the Academy Awards and British Academy Film Awards. Plot Following his graduation from university in 1956, aspiring filmmaker Colin Clark travels to London to get a job on Laurence Olivier's next production. Production manager Hugh Perceval tells Colin that there are no jobs available, but he decides to wait for Olivier, whom he once met at a party. Olivier and his wife, Vivien Leigh, eventually show up and Vivien encourages Olivier to give Colin a job on his upcoming film The Prince and the Showgirl, starring Marilyn Monroe. Colin's first task is to find a suitable place for Marilyn and her husband, Arthur Miller, the famous playwright, to stay at while they are in England. The press discover the house, but Colin reveals he secured a second house just in case, impressing Olivier and Marilyn's publicist, Arthur P. Jacobs. The paparazzi find out about Marilyn's arrival at Heathrow and they gather around the aircraft when it lands. Marilyn brings Arthur, her business partner, Milton H. Greene, and her acting coach, Paula Strasberg, with her. Marilyn is initially uncomfortable around the many photographers but relaxes at the press conference. Olivier becomes frustrated when Marilyn is late to the read- through. She insists Paula sit with her, and when she has trouble with her lines, Paula reads them for her. The crew and the other actors, including Sybil Thorndike, are in awe of Marilyn. Colin meets Lucy, a wardrobe assistant to whom he is attracted, and they go on a date. Marilyn starts arriving later to the set and often forgets her lines, angering Olivier. However, Sybil praises Marilyn and defends her when Olivier tries to get her to apologise for delaying the shoot. Marilyn struggles to understand her character and leaves the set when Olivier insults her. Colin asks Olivier to be more sympathetic towards Marilyn before he goes to Parkside House to check on her. He hears an argument and finds a tearful Marilyn sitting on the stairs with Arthur's notebook, which contains the plot of a new play in which Arthur seems to mock her. Arthur later returns to the United States. Vivien comes to the set and watches some of Marilyn's scenes, then argues with her husband. She breaks down, saying that Marilyn lights up the screen and that she wishes Olivier could see himself when he watches her. Olivier tries unsuccessfully to reassure his wife. Marilyn does not show up to the set following Arthur's departure and she asks Colin to come to Parkside, where they have a talk. The crew becomes captivated by Marilyn when she dances for a scene, during which Milton pulls Colin aside to tell him that Marilyn breaks hearts and that she will break his too. Lucy also notices Colin's growing infatuation with Marilyn and breaks up with him. Colin and Marilyn spend the day together and are given a tour of the library of Windsor Castle by Owen Morshead. Colin also shows Marilyn around Eton College, and they go skinny dipping in the River Thames. Marilyn kisses Colin and they are found by Roger Smith, Marilyn's bodyguard. Colin is called to Parkside one night as Marilyn has locked herself in her room. Colin enters her room and Marilyn invites him to lie next to her on the bed. The following night, Marilyn wakes up in pain and claims she is having a miscarriage. A doctor tends to her. Marilyn tells Colin that Arthur is coming back and that she wants to try being a good wife to him, so she and Colin should forget everything that happened between them. She later returns to the set to complete the film. Olivier praises Marilyn but reveals she has killed his desire to direct again. Lucy asks Colin if Marilyn broke his heart and he replies that she did \\"a little\\", to which she replies that he needed it. Marilyn comes to a local pub, where Colin is staying, and thanks him for helping her. She kisses him goodbye and Roger drives her to the airport.

My Week with Marilyn is based on Colin Clark's The Prince, The Showgirl and Me (1995) and My Week with Marilyn (2000); two diary accounts, which document his time on the set of the 1957 film The Prince and the Showgirl and the time he spent with Monroe. After reading the two books in 2004, Simon Curtis approached producer David Parfitt about making a film based upon them. Parfitt said everyone liked the idea, but because Monroe is so familiar and iconic to people, they wondered what was left to say. Adrian Hodges, who wrote the screenplay, told David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph \\"If you'd said to me one day I'd write a film about her, I'd have been amazed, because I wouldn't have known where to start.\\" Gritten reported the saving grace for Hodges was that Clark's books were written about Monroe at a specific time. Curtis and Parfitt went to BBC Films and the UK Film Council and they put up the money for development. They then had to wait for eighteen months while Parfitt negotiated the rights to the books with Clark's estate. The producer and director had to wait a further six months for Hodges' screenplay. Once it was ready, a search for finance and a cast began. Curtis went to Harvey Weinstein and told him about his idea for making a film based on Clark's books. Weinstein told Michael Hogan of The Huffington Post that he had read the books for fun, but had never considered them adapted into a film. He read Hodges' script, which he described as \\"quite good\\", charming and fun. Weinstein chose to finance My Week with Marilyn as he was keen to work with Michelle Williams again, following Blue Valentine. The film is produced by Trademark Films and is also financed by LipSync Productions. My Week with Marilyn marked Curtis' feature film debut. =Casting= Michelle Williams as Marilyn Monroe and Dougray Scott as Arthur Miller on set in Mayfair, London Michelle Williams was the only actress that producers met with during the casting process and Curtis said she was the only actress he had sought for the role. She committed to My Week with Marilyn two years before production began. Williams told Adam Green of Vogue that the notion of portraying Monroe was daunting, but as she finished reading the script, she knew she wanted the role. She then spent six months reading biographies, diaries, letters, poems, and notes about and from Monroe. She also looked at photographs, watched her films, and listened to recordings. Williams had to gain weight for the role, and she worked with a choreographer to help perfect Monroe's walking. In September, it was announced that Eddie Redmayne had been cast as Clark. Parfitt commented that finding an actor for the role had been difficult. He said \\"It's a devilishly tricky part to find the right person for because Colin went to Eton, studied at Oxford and flew for the RAF.\\" That same month, it was also announced that Emma Watson had been cast in the small role of wardrobe assistant, Lucy. Watson was scheduled to spend only a few days on set shooting her scenes to prevent her studies at Brown University from being interrupted. Kenneth Branagh began talks with producers for the role of Laurence Olivier in July 2010 after Ralph Fiennes had to drop out to direct his adaptation of Coriolanus. Branagh was later cast in the role. Dominic Cooper was given the role of Milton H. Greene, a photographer and Monroe's business partner. Of Greene, Cooper said, \\"He was quite an old man, but they had a very close relationship. I think Marilyn felt very supported by him in the beginning. But ultimately he became her agent and business partner, which is rather a lot.\\" Cooper filmed his scenes in between his work on Captain America: The First Avenger. Catherine Zeta-Jones was offered the role of actress Vivien Leigh. But Zeta-Jones turned down the role as she did not want to spend more than a week away from her husband Michael Douglas, who was being treated for throat cancer at the time. Curtis and the producers began auditioning other actresses and they ultimately cast Julia Ormond in the role. Ormond's casting was announced at the same time as Dougray Scott's, who portrays Arthur Miller. Derek Jacobi was cast as Sir Owen Morshead, the royal librarian at Windsor Castle, Philip Jackson plays Monroe's private detective and Judi Dench plays Sybil Thorndike. Zo√´ Wanamaker is Paula Strasberg, Monroe's acting consultant and Richard Clifford was cast as Richard Wattis. The film's cast also includes Toby Jones, Geraldine Somerville, Simon Russell Beale and Michael Kitchen. It was announced on 8 October 2010, that casting for the film had been completed. =Filming= Principal photography on My Week with Marilyn commenced on 19 September 2010. Dench filmed her scenes during that month as she had to go to India to start working on The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Filming took place at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire from 4 October 2010. Three days later, White Waltham Airfield was turned into a 1950s London Heathrow Airport to recreate the moment when Monroe arrived in England to begin production on The Prince and the Showgirl. Curtis used the studio in which Monroe shot The Prince and the Showgirl in 1956 to film scenes for My Week with Marilyn. Williams was given the same dressing room Monroe had used at the time of her shoot. Filming also took place on locations in and around London. One such location included Parkside House in the village of Englefield Green, where Monroe and Miller lived during their stay in Britain. The film's production designer, Donal Woods, toured the house with Curtis prior to filming and noticed the exterior looked much as it did when Monroe posed for some publicity shots there fifty years ago. British Cinematographer reported the production had filmed scenes at Saltwood Castle, near Folkestone, where Clark grew up as a young boy. The film was also shot at Eton College, which Clark attended, and outside Windsor Castle for a few hours during one Saturday morning. Cinematographer Ben Smithard said the creative and visual references in My Week with Marilyn came from stills of American photographer and painter, Saul Leiter. Smithard told British Cinematographer that a significant amount of time was spent in pre-production. He said \\"On an historic film like this, you need to do as much prep as you can get. It's like a history lesson, and you can learn about a point in time.\\" The cinematographer framed My Week with Marilyn in the standard anamorphic format as it is \\"very good for personal stories\\" and suited the film. He added that it is easy to frame two actors, but the format is not so good for architectural features. Principal photography on My Week with Marilyn lasted seven weeks and wrapped in November 2010. Post-production lasted from 28 November 2010 to 31 August 2011. =Costumes and make-up= The costume designer for My Week with Marilyn was Jill Taylor. Taylor, who previously worked on Sliding Doors (1998) and Match Point (2005), created the costumes for the film in six weeks and she dressed the entire cast. She sourced many of the items from vintage shops, auction houses and markets. Speaking to Estella Shardlow of Vintage Seekers, Taylor said \\"I trawled through loads and loads of antiques fairs and vintage shops to see if we could find original vintage pieces that would suffice for the film. We were pretty successful but we also had to reproduce a lot from original photographs ‚Äì for example, we had to do the scene where she lands in this country, which is well-documented on newsreel.\\" Taylor told Shardlow it was difficult to find fabrics that looked as \\"lush\\" as they did in the fifties and she had some challenging costumes to make, including a dress from The Prince and the Showgirl for Dench's character, Sybil Thorndike. The designer also said she had to make some adaptations to a suit worn by Ormond, as she is a completely different body shape to her character, Vivien Leigh. During research for Watson's character, Lucy, Taylor found an original photograph of the cast and crew of The Prince and the Showgirl. One of the girls in the picture was wearing a tartan dress, so Taylor went out and found Watson an original tartan dress to wear. She said she and her team had fun with Watson's character, as she is a young and fashion-conscious girl. The designer said \\"Given the American influence to England in the 50s, her style is quite Sandra Dee and girlie.\\" Taylor told Sarah Smith of InStyle that she worked from many photographs of Monroe, particularly ones taken on her honeymoon with Miller. Taylor said she drew upon a certain picture of the actress wearing a man's shirt and a pencil skirt and she made the outfit for the film. Taylor added \\"There was also one scene when [Michelle as Marilyn] is in a car and she's got a black chiffon headscarf and there was a coat I did for her that was actually in the Sotheby's catalogue. We reproduced that coat, which was like an oatmeal silk coat with a black velvet collar, and we made it into a jacket for Michelle, rather than a coat.\\" Taylor also worked with Williams during the design process and she explained the actress would bring picture references for her. Taylor would do sketches for Williams as they talked and the designer said \\"it was a collaboration about what she thought she would like to wear and what I thought.\\" The designer told Smith she was very pleased with how successful the white dress she had made for Williams during The Prince and the Showgirl scenes turned out. Taylor used a fitting photograph of Monroe with The Prince and the Showgirl costume designer to help her make the garment. She explained that the dress was quite intricate to make and there were no doubles, so Williams had to wear the same dress for eleven days. Taylor worried that something would happen to the dress and was relieved when the shoot was over. When asked if Williams had a favourite outfit, Taylor said the actress particularly enjoyed wearing a black dress and the skirt and shirt combination. The hair and make-up designer for the film was Jenny Shircore. She told Joe Nazzaro of Make-Up Artist Magazine that the biggest challenge for her was transforming Williams into Monroe. Shircore said Williams' features are quite different from Monroe's, but she did not want to use prosthetics to shape her face as the emotion Williams was conveying in her performance had to come through the make-up. Shircore explained \\"There are times in the film when she's actually wearing very little make-up but we still kept tiny aspects of Marilyn, such as the eyebrows, the shading and the shape of the lips, so we would keep three or four major points that helped us towards Marilyn. Some of it was quite difficult, because Michelle's eyes are completely different. Marilyn had very distinctive eyelids, so we had to try and form that shape on Michelle's eyes by the use of light and shade.\\" The make-up artist said most of the scenes in the film see the actors from The Prince and the Showgirl in their film make-up, so Shircore had to copy the original scene for My Week with Marilyn and get it right. She also revealed a few minor prosthetics were used on some cast members to help recreate the characters. Shircore told Nazzaro \\"I'm not going to give them away, but they are things that make a difference and they're all beautifully conceived, produced and worn by the actors.\\" =Music= The film's original score was composed by American composer Conrad Pope. French composer Alexandre Desplat wrote a piece titled \\"Marilyn's Theme\\", which Pope adapted into his score. Pianist Lang Lang is a featured performer on several of Pope and Desplat's compositions. Williams also features on the soundtrack singing \\"I Found a Dream\\", \\"That Old Black Magic\\" and a medley of \\"When Love Goes Wrong, Nothing Goes Right\\" and \\"Heat Wave\\". Other songs include \\"Autumn Leaves\\" and \\"Memories Are Made of This\\". The soundtrack was released digitally on 1 November 2011.

She also received her first Golden Globe award for her performance in this film. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with Williams' performance receiving acclaim. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 83% of 185 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.13 out of 10. According to the site's summary of the critical consensus, \\"Michelle Williams shines in My Week with Marilyn, capturing the magnetism and vulnerability of Marilyn Monroe.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a score of 1‚Äì100 to individual film reviews, gives the film an average rating of 65 based on 38 reviews. David Rooney from The Hollywood Reporter praised Williams' performance and said she nailed Monroe's vocal style. Rooney also praised Redmayne as Clark, saying his scenes with Williams were captivating. However, Rooney went on to say \\"Fault lies with both Hodges' workmanlike script and Curtis' failure to excavate much psychological depth.\\" He added My Week with Marilyn is starchy and short on perspective, making it \\"superficial showbiz pageantry.\\" Ronnie Scheib of Variety said My Week with Marilyn \\"flits uneasily between arch drawing-room comedy and foreshadowed tragedy\\" and is too stagily directed by Curtis, who lines up the characters with \\"no attention to spatial logic or rhythmic flow.\\" Scheib added the film coasts on Williams' performance, while the story feels like it has been ripped from film fan magazines of the time. Rex Reed of The New York Observer called My Week with Marilyn \\"pure perfection.\\" Adam Green of Vogue said the film does not quite reach \\"the high drama and urgency of a period piece like The King's Speech\\", but it does evoke a vanished era in filmmaking. Green added Williams is the main attraction and she brings Monroe to life \\"with heartbreaking delicacy and precision without resorting to impersonation or clich√©.\\" Regina Weinreich of The Huffington Post called My Week with Marilyn a \\"gem\\" and said the story \\"manages to convey so much of Marilyn, particularly her child-like vulnerability, her insecurity as an actress, her natural charm and talents. While we have seen Michelle Williams tap dance and heard her sing before -- she was superb in last year's Blue Valentine -- her moves and voice as Marilyn evoke the subject's understated, magnetic performances.\\" Weinreich went on to praise the rest of the cast, including Redmayne, Branagh and Dench, saying they are \\"especially good.\\" A writer for indieWire said My Week with Marilyn is like a \\"superficial Lifetime made for TV-movie.\\" The writer went on to say the film is not terrible, but there is \\"very little meat on the bone.\\" They added the film has a terrific cast who do their best with an average script. Robbie Collin, writing for The Daily Telegraph gave the film three out of five stars and said \\"Michelle Williams makes a mesmeric Monroe in My Week With Marilyn, but the film falls disappointingly short on boop-boop-be-doo.\\" The Miami Herald's Rene Rodriguez gave the film three out of four stars. He said \\"One of the chief pleasures of My Week with Marilyn ‚Äî which should not be approached as anything other than fluffy entertainment ‚Äî is watching Williams bring to life Monroe's inner demons and her movie-star allure with equal aplomb.\\" The New Yorker's film critic David Denby also praised Williams' performance as Monroe, saying \\"In My Week with Marilyn, Williams makes the star come alive. She has Monroe's walk, the easy, swivelling neck, the face that responds to everything like a flower swaying in the breeze. Most important, she has the sexual sweetness and the hurt, lost look that shifts, in a flash, into resistance and tears.\\" The critic called the film \\"charming and touching\\" and said it is expertly made. Writing for Time, Mary Pols called My Week with Marilyn \\"nothing more than a lively confection.\\" Pols went on to say \\"Williams locates a central truth, the contradictory allure of this utterly impossible woman ‚Äî mercurial, vain, foolish, but also intelligent in some very primal way and achingly vulnerable.\\" Upon giving the film three and a half out of four stars, critic Roger Ebert said \\"What matters is the performance by Michelle Williams. She evokes so many Marilyns, public and private, real and make-believe. We didn't know Monroe, but we believe she must have been something like this. We're probably looking at one of this year's Oscar nominees.\\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times thought Branagh was miscast as Olivier, but she said he made up for that with \\"his crisp, at times clipped, enunciation and a physical performance that gives Olivier enough vitality so that when, early in, the character sweeps into his production office with his wife, Vivien Leigh (Julia Ormond, a wan placeholder for the original), he dazzles Clark and jolts this slow-stirring movie awake.\\" Of Williams, the film critic said she \\"tries her best, and sometimes that's almost enough.\\" Dargis said the main problem is with Hodges' script, which \\"offers a catalog of Monroe stereotypes.\\" Stella Papamichael of Digital Spy gave the film four out of five stars and she praised many of the cast's performances. Papamichael added \\"While you won't learn anything new about Marilyn Monroe, you can revel in the silky feel of nostalgia.\\" Empire magazine's Angie Errigo gave My Week with Marilyn three out of five stars and she said \\"At moments hilarious and others touching, it's a sweet, slight affair, more pretty pageant than pithy biographical drama. Expect awards nominations to stack up for Williams and Branagh.\\" The Wall Street Journal's film critic, Joe Morgenstern was negative about the film saying, \\"When bad movies happen to good people, the first place to look for an explanation is the basic idea. That certainly applies to \\"My Week with Marilyn,\\" a dubious idea done in by Adrian Hodges's shallow script and Simon Curtis's clumsy direction.\\" Nishi Tiwari of Rediff.com said Williams is \\"a fascinating watch\\", but there is nothing about Monroe in the film that we did not know already. =Accolades= For her performances in My Week with Marilyn, Meek's Cutoff and Take This Waltz, Williams was given the Best Actress award at the 2011 Hollywood Film Festival. On 25 November 2011, it was announced Williams would receive the 2012 Desert Palm Achievement Actress Award from the Palm Springs International Film Festival in recognition of her performance in My Week with Marilyn.

Early life Dorothy Ruth Morris was born and raised in Hollywood. She attended Hollywood High School and acted in productions at the Pasadena Playhouse. She was a student in Maria Ouspenskaya's School of Drama. She was the younger sister of Caren Marsh Doll, who later became a dancer and stand-in for Judy Garland. Morris studied acting under famed drama teacher Maria Ouspenskaya. She did a screen test for the female lead in The Courtship of Andy Hardy (1942), but lost to Donna Reed.Morning News, January 10, 1948, Who Was Who in America (Vol. 2).  Career  Appearing in bit parts in several of the studio's more successful films, Morris was signed to a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contract in 1941. For one of her early film roles, Cry 'Havoc' (1943), she affected a British accent. Her next picture was the well-received drama The Human Comedy, which featured a star cast, headed by Mickey Rooney, Frank Morgan, James Craig and Marsha Hunt. Morris' role was Mary Arena; the girlfriend of Van Johnson's character. The highlight of her career, however, came in 1945 when she starred as the doomed Ingeborg Jensen in Our Vines Have Tender Grapes. Other screen roles included Someone to Remember (1943), Pilot No. 5 (1943), Rationing (1944) and None Shall Escape (1944). Morris is often remembered for her featured appearances in MGM short subjects. She appeared in several of the studio's short films including the Pete Smith Specialties, The Passing Parade, and Crime Does Not Pay series. The Crime short turned out so well that MGM expanded it into a full-length feature, Main Street After Dark in 1945, for which the actress was billed as Dorothy Ruth Morris. (Morris reminisces about her short-subjects experience in the Turner Classic Movies documentary Added Attractions: The Hollywood Shorts Story, first broadcast in 2002.)  Later career  After she married in 1943, she took a hiatus from movie making. In the late 1950s, she made guest appearances on television series such as The Untouchables, The Donna Reed Show, Rawhide, Casey Jones, and Wagon Train. She made two film appearances during the 1950s in Macabre and The Power of the Resurrection (both 1958). Her last film role was in Seconds (1966) starring Rock Hudson. Her last television appearance was in a 1971 episode of Marcus Welby, M.D..  Personal life  Morris was married twice. Her first marriage was to math professor Marvin Moffie in 1943. They had two children. The marriage ended in divorce in 1966. Her second marriage was to church minister Roger E. Miller in 1969, but their union was short-lived and ended in a 1972 divorce. Morris adhered to Methodism.Morning News, January 10, 1948, Who Was Who in America (Vol. 2).  Death  Morris resided in Palm Springs, California until her death on November 20, 2011 at the age of 89. Upon her passing, her body was donated to medical science at the University of California Riverside.

He was the son of Sheikh Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani.  Early life  Kamal al-Din al-Nabhani was born on January 3, 1929, in Beirut, Lebanon.  Thoughts  = Philosophy and theology = In his books Thought and System of Islam 2 (based on the work of his father Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani), Nabhani placed heavy emphasis on modes and models of the psychology behind human thought and its concepts. He defined the thought process and how it becomes a conviction or concept. He discussed the internal working of thoughts, convictions, and concepts in shaping the Nafs (emotions and sentiments). He also explained how people reach conclusions and the psychology behind the process. This process derives from his father's roots in non-Ascetic legalistic Sufism and from his first teacher and maternal grandfather, Ismail al-Nabhani. Nabhani's definitions of thought have been used in the study of computer science, artificial intelligence, and information processing and in London South Bank University's information technology department. After many philosophical discussions on the nature of thoughts and emotions, Nabhani concludes that the only way to bring about change is through discussion, refutation, and revival of the relevant thoughts and emotions. From this philosophical basis, he argues that force does not work to change peoples' ideas. He also argues that a decline in Muslims' mental, emotional, and conceptual lives led to the decline of Muslim culture and the eventual destruction of the Caliphate. He believed the first major step in the decline of Muslim culture was confusion and conflict with new foreign ideas, mainly Greek, Persian, and Eastern philosophy. He argues that the Islamic world does not know how to address and contextualize these ideas because they have become insular and complacent instead of preserving Islamic thought and philosophy and keeping it relevant to a world in flux. The heavy emphasis on pinpointing, defining, and changing peoples thoughts, convictions, or emotions via stronger thoughts, diagnosis, and refutation of the process an individual uses to reach their particular \\"incorrect\\" view has become a recurring argument used by the Hizb ut-Tahrir political party on most issues. =Faith vs. rational belief= Nabhani claimed that Islam is founded on the rational belief and not blind faith, quite similar to Ghazali's Kalam argument. However, both Nabhani and Ghazali argued that after Aqeeda (belief) is established, divine laws in the Quran are beyond question due to the \\"mind\\" of God being beyond human comprehension. Nabhani loosely affirmed rationalism (though not that of the Mu'tazili), but argued that it can establish belief in a God just like Ghazali and Ghazali's teacher al-Juwayni, contrary to the common western notion of rationalism. Nabhani tried to outline materialist arguments and axioms to prove that one unlimited creator of the universe, God (Allah), can be proven by rational deduction. He believed that both the dependency and limited physical nature of every tangible thing within human perception ultimately point to an unlimited creator who is beyond need and dependency, an absolute infinite.

The latter is located in the southeast corner of present-day Stouffville. It is the largest Wendat ancestral village excavated to date. The same community was formerly thought to have left the Mantle site circa 1550 to establish the so-called Ratcliff site and the Aurora or Old Fort site to the north-west in what is today the Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville. New analysis in 2018 established that the Mantle site was active from 1587 to 1623. In early 1975 and 1978, the largely undisturbed Draper Huron village site was completely excavated.

After joining the U.S. Navy he was stationed aboard the as a chief machinist. On January 21, 1903 the Leyden was wrecked. For his actions during the incident received the Medal of Honor on December 26, 1903. Walsh received the Medal of Honor (MOH) for heroism on a little vessel that became celebrated for the valuable service performed and the many fights and incidents in which it was present - the tugboat USS Leyden, a vessel of only 500 tons. The tug was stationed at Key West, Florida, and, on April 22, 1898, delivered to Admiral William T. Sampson on board the armored cruiser USS New York, the information that war was declared, and that he should proceed, with the fleet, to Cuba. The following morning, the fleet sailed with the Leyden following the New York. After reaching Cuba, the Leyden was sent back to Key West and was outfitted with guns. Upon return to Cuba, the Leyden was used as one of the blockading squadrons on the Cuban coast. Leyden participated in many fights and captured several prizes. At the close of the war, Leyden was sent back to Newport, Rhode Island for repairs. Walsh received the Medal of Honor for a heroic deed by which the lives of the crew were saved. The little vessel that had passed through so many dangers during the Spanish War, and had so many fights, fell a victim to the wind, being wrecked January 21, 1903 on the rocks of Block Island, Rhode Island. During the storm and wreck, Walsh, instead of seeking his own safety, thought of only duty, and in the engine room closing the valves, releasing the main injecting valve, releasing the safety valve on the main boiler, he thus prevented an explosion. The life boats were all sunk by the heavy seas and the lives of the crew saved by being pulled ashore in a breeches buoy. Walsh was a member of the United Spanish War Veterans. Walsh died on June 29, 1913 and is buried in Saint Columba Catholic Cemetery in Middletown, Rhode Island. Medal of Honor citation Rank and organization: Chief Machinist, U.S. Navy.

Origins and education Born Jakob Degen in Schorndorf, son of the citizen Bernhard Degen, he adopted the name Schegk/Schegkius which he used his entire adult life. A prodigy in classical languages, having studied with Johann Reuchlin‚Äôs student Johann Thomas in Schorndorf, Schegk made rapid progress upon enrolling at the University of T√ºbingen in 1527, taking his M.A. in 1529. He was received by the university senate and began lectures in philosophy and classics while only twenty. He remained in T√ºbingen for his entire career.Arthur Richter, \\"Degen, Jakob‚Äú in Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, herausgegeben von der Historischen Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Band 5 (1877), pp. 21‚Äì22, Digitale Volltext-Ausgabe in Wikisource, URL: (Version vom 6.

He likewise studied law prior to turning his attention to medicine in the 1530s. He took a doctorate in medicine in 1539 after studying with Leonhard Fuchs and Michael Rucker. He remained on the arts faculty until joining the medical faculty in 1553. Nevertheless, his philosophical expertise was too great to go untapped, and the university gave him the unusual dual commission to hold lectures in both medicine and Aristotle from 1564 onwards. His poor eyesight hampered his mobility, and he became totally blind by 1577. He nevertheless continued his academic career. In philosophy, he was a leading German Lutheran Aristotelian and was regarded as one of the greatest philosophical authorities of his age.Arthur Richter, \\"Degen, Jakob‚Äú in Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, He died at T√ºbingen. While somewhat neglected by modern scholarship, his numerous commentaries upon the Aristotelian corpus are highly regarded, especially his De demonstratione libri XV.

Lubhu is a sub-urban Newar place situated seven kilometers east of Kathmandu in northern part of Lalitpur, Nepal. Etymology There are interesting folklores explaining how Lubhu, which in Newari means ‚ÄúGolden Plate‚Äù got its name. It is believed that there was a homosexual resident who worshipped Maha Laksmi and Gobhrateshwar Mahadev to resolve his confused sexual orientation. After three years of devoted worship, the Gods were finally happy and granted the worshipper the body of a ‚Äúcomplete man‚Äù. Knowing no bounds for his happiness upon this, the devotee is said to have offered both the deities plates made of gold, and hence named the place ‚ÄúLunbhu‚Äù, meaning the same. In ancient time, Lubhu was hit by disease. Ganga Maharani, the ruler of the city, sold her golden plate and resettles the city. So, the city was called Lubhu which means Golden Plate. God Bhairav laid under golden umbrella to save the people from disease. The place was then called ‚ÄòSubarna Chhatrapur‚Äô but was called ‚ÄòLubhu‚Äô, which means the same in Newari. Culture The Lubhu people have their own unique Jatras and festivals, the most famous being the Maha Laxmi-Maha Bhairav Jatra observed in the month of Baishakh (April - May). This is the time of the year when the whole of the Newari community of Lubhu gets out of their daily monotonies to celebrate in a truly carefree fashion. The two chariots inside the temple of Maha Laksmi are loaded with the gold-plated masks of deities that are house in the same. While one of the chariots is used to carry a set of Maha Laksmi, Ganesh and Kumar statuettes, the other carries another set of Maha Bhairav, Ganesh and Kumari. The chariot is then hoisted by drunken revelers to make a complete tour of all the houses in the locality followed an elaborate Bhoj (feast), which is an essential part of the merrymaking. Bringing the Maha Laksmi closer to your home is believed to bring you auspices of peace and prosperity. And so is the existence of the Maha Laksmi Temple in the sunny vicinity of simple but very social people. In fact, there is another temple further up the location of the main Maha Laksmi Temple that houses the mother of Goddess Maha Laksmi. That place is called Devisthan. During the Jatra or procession, the statuette of the same Raths or chariots are taken to her mother‚Äôs temple so that the mother-daughter meeting can take place, marking the climax of the carnival. The temple‚Äôs religious architectures date back to the Malla periods, according to stone inscriptions. The head of the Maha Laksmi template is called the Thakali and is also the eldest member of the Guthi (guild, trust). There are altogether five layers of gold-plated masks of the above mentioned deities enshrined in the template. As soon as the existing one gets even a slight damage, the figurines are covered by yet another layer of the masks made of precious metals and plated by gold. There is also a tall white template of the Gobhrareshwar Mahadev built in the same style as that of the Krishna Mandir of Patan that makes for an interesting piece of structure to study as well as revere.  Demographics  The settlement in the 730 acres of land of Lubhu is mostly populated by an ethnic Newari community of mainly Shresthas, Maharjans, Rajthala and Gubhaju in the main town area and Brahmin and chhetri in the outskirts.  Economy  Lubhu is a major textile-production area producing locally made garments. Lubhu is a major source of garments of many Nepalese cloth industries and tourist areas like Thamel. A majority of households have their own small to large scale factories to produce such garments. While some still have the traditional wooden hand looms, many residents own textile factories with electric looms. Agriculture is also a major occupation.

It helps urban school districts and states recruit and train new teachers, staff challenged schools, design evaluation systems, and retain teachers who have demonstrated the ability to raise student achievement. TNTP is a non-profit organization and was founded by Michelle Rhee in 1997. Overview A national nonprofit organization founded by teachers, TNTP is driven by the belief that effective teachers have a greater impact on student achievement than any other school factor (even to the exclusion of social factors). In response, TNTP develops customized programs and policy interventions that enable education leaders to find, develop and keep great teachers. Since its inception in 1997, TNTP has recruited or trained approximately 43,000 teachers - mainly through its Teaching Fellows programs - who have taught an estimated 7 million students.What We Do, TNTP, tntp.org.

In a New York Daily News opinion piece, Timothy Daly, President of TNTP, advocated for \\"making student test scores one of many factors in the tenure decision.\\" History TNTP was founded in 1997 by Michelle Rhee. It began with the aim of giving poor and minority students equal access to effective teachers, and during its first 10 years, TNTP initially focused on helping urban districts improve the way they recruited, trained, and hired new teachers. In 2000, TNTP began the Teaching Fellows and Academy programs, which served as alternate routes to teacher certification for high-need schools. Today, TNTP also works with states and public school districts in the areas of measurement and management of teacher performance.Our History, TNTP, tntp.org. Accessed 2012-7-29. As it became increasingly familiar with the needs of urban districts, TNTP began helping districts identify and address additional challenges, including hiring teachers earlier, staffing challenged schools and providing rigorous teacher certification training. It also began identifying policies counterproductive to overcoming these challenges and publishing reports to offer solutions and encourage reform.Philanthropy Roundtable, Achieving Teacher and Principal Excellence: A Guidebook for Donors, philanthropyroundtable.org, 2008. Accessed 2012-7-29. Business model TNTP is a revenue-generating nonprofit. The majority of its revenue comes from contracts with districts and states to supply services; additional funding for new program development and research is provided by donors such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.Our Funding Model, TNTP, tntp.org. Accessed 2012-7-29. Reports =The Widget Effect (2009)= In 2009, TNTP published The Widget Effect: Our National Failure to Acknowledge and Act Upon Teacher Effectiveness. The report, which surveyed over 15,000 teachers and 1,300 principals in 12 school districts, concluded that the U.S. public education system treats teachers as interchangeable parts, rather than individual professionals. American Federation of Teachers (AFT) President Randi Weingarten provided a public statement of support for the report, saying it ‚Äúpoints the way to a credible, fair, accurate and effective teacher evaluation system that would improve teaching and learning.‚ÄùWidget Effect Supporters, widgeteffect.org, 2009. Accessed 2012-7-29. The National Education Policy Center (NEPC) review of The Widget Effect praised the overall quality of the report but said, \\"'it is unclear ... how and why particular districts were selected, and whether they represent the range of teacher evaluation practices being implemented in school districts and states across the United States.' Omissions in the report's description of its methodology (e.g., sampling strategy and survey response rates) and its sample lead to questions about the generalizability of the findings.\\" =Teacher Evaluation 2.0 (2010)= The National Education Policy Center was critical of TNTP's report Teacher Evaluation 2.0, which, it said, contained \\"recommendations for teacher evaluation [that] boil down, for the most part, to truisms and conventional wisdom, lacking a supporting presentation of scholarly evidence.\\" The review also claimed that \\"many of the ideas and recommendations are neither new nor innovative.\\" =The Irreplaceables (2012)= In 2012, TNTP published The Irreplaceables: Understanding the Real Retention Crisis in America‚Äôs Urban Schools.‚Äú, TNTP, tntp.org. Accessed 2013-3-29. The study identified the failure of public schools to keep more of their strongest teachers (or ‚Äúirreplaceables‚Äù) in the classroom than their weakest as the fundamental problem with teacher retention in urban school districts. The report, which focused on four large urban school districts, also offered solutions for how districts and schools can help keep more of their best teachers. Upon The Irreplaceables‚Äô release, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan publicly supported TNTP‚Äôs findings and the National Education Association (NEA) praised the report, noting that TNTP had ‚Äúhelped focus attention on one of our nation‚Äôs most valuable assets: the dedicated professionals who educate our children.‚Äù Teacher Preparation Programs 2008 data from Louisiana showed ‚Äúthat TNTP teachers outperform beginning and experienced teachers in math, reading, and language arts.‚Äù In 2010, a state- sponsored study assessed the effectiveness of newly certified teachers in Louisiana.

In 2009, a report by the Center for American Progress, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the American Enterprise Institute included TNTP along with certain public school districts, charter school entrepreneurs, and other independent organizations as ‚Äúaddressing stubborn challenges by pursuing familiar notions of good teaching and effective schooling in impressively coherent, disciplined, and strategic ways.‚ÄùLeaders and Laggards: A State by State Report Card on Educational Innovation , Center for American Progress, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and Frederick M.

In particular, it stated that TNTP has \\"demonstrated a strong record, validated by independent research, of bringing nontraditional applicants into the classroom.\\" Controversy In June 2009, TNTP published its Widget Effect report on teacher evaluation, conducted in collaboration with over 50 district and state officials and 25 teachers union representatives. Although the American Federation of Teachers agreed that the ‚Äúoverall conclusions of the report are sound,‚Äù the union disputed the data on the number of teachers dismissed in Toledo, Ohio.

History The 500 class were diesel shunter locomotives operated by the South Australian Railways. Thirty-four were built at Islington Railway Workshops. The first 27 were built with broad gauge bogies and the last seven equipped to operate on the standard gauge. They operated in yards at Gladstone, Murray Bridge, Naracoorte, Peterborough, Port Pirie, Tailem Bend and Wallaroo as well as being extensively used in Adelaide. In March 1978 all were included in the transfer of the South Australian Railways to Australian National. Some were transferred to Port Augusta.

He was a second rower with the St. George Dragons during their eleven- year premiership winning run from 1956 to 1966, playing in six winning grand final teams. He was the inaugural captain of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in that club's foundation season of 1967. After football, he had a successful career as a Sports Administrator. Career =Footballer= Born in Peak Hill, near Coolah in the central north of New South Wales, Porter grew up in Werris Creek where his father, a country schoolteacher was posted.Never Before, Never Again, Writer pp396-403 He played schoolboy rugby league at Tamworth High and later for East Tamworth, where as a twenty-year-old he turned out against the touring 1954 Great Britain side. He played for Thirroul and Wests in the Southern Division. After an obligatory period national service he arrived in Sydney in 1955 getting a start in the NSWRFL Sydney competition with Western Suburbs. He spent the season in reserve grade making just four first-grade appearances that year. He left the club in 1956 after spending the first six games of that season in the lower grade. He trialled with Thirroul in the Southern Division using a false name to circumvent the residential qualification rules of the time and spent the rest of the 1956 season in their top grade. He moved to the St. George club in 1957 and was called into the first-grade team during the 1958 finals series at prop- forward, helping the side to their 3rd successive premiership. He cemented his spot from 1959, enjoying great success as a second rower.http://www.nswrl.com.au/default.aspx?s=article- display&id;=33001&title;=vale---monty-porter Obit at nswrl.com The club won the premiership every year he was at the club. In 1966 he signed for the newly formed Cronulla club and became their foundation captain in their inaugural year in 1967. He made one representative appearance for New South Wales in 1960. =Administrator= He retired from playing in 1968 and became the Club Secretary of the Cronulla-Sutherland club until 1970. He remained actively involved with the club as chairman of selectors and under-23s coach until 1973. He won a job managing the New South Wales State Government's sports administration arm Sports House which during the 1970s and 1980s provided free administration facilities for amateur sports. He progressed to the role of Assistant Director of Sport in New South Wales which he held for four years. In 1983 he became a member of the first ever NSWRFL Board of Directors. That same year the NSWRFL found itself administering the Cronulla Sharks when the club ran into financial difficulties; Porter accepted a post as President of the club from 1984 to 1988. In 1994 he accepted a caretaker role as acting General Manager of the Sydney International Aquatic Centres at Homebush. The facilities were built ahead of the Sydney 2000 Olympics and required management prior to the appointment of full-time operators. =Accolades= In his role as a sports administrator, Monty was awarded in the 1993 Queen's Birthday Honours List as a recipient of The Public Service Medal,which acknowledges outstanding service by employees of the Australian Government and/or state governments. During the Australian Rugby League's 2008 Centenary Year a college of the game's historians were asked to retrospectively give a Man-of-the-Match award for each of the 32 Grand finals held between 1954 and 1986 before the official Clive Churchill Medals came into existence. Porter was the winner of the 1960 award for his grand final performance against Easts.http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/greats-to-get-man-of-match- awards/story-e6frexnr-1111117632362 Retrospective Man-of-the-Match Sports author Larry Writer describes Porter's role in the elite Dragon's side as \\"a tradesman in a team of stars, a self-described 'plugger' who did his job each game with minimum fuss and maximum efficiency\\" whose primary job was to \\"tackle, tackle, tackle\\" and whose dependability was highly prized by his teammates. Writer suggests that such specialists hadn't come into vogue in the 1960s in Australian rugby league but by the 1970s at least one such second- rower was a critical for every successful side and players such as Steve Folkes and David Gillespie are examples of those whose playing and later coaching careers were forged entirely on their defensive capabilities with playing styles similar to Porter's. Since 2008 the Cronulla club has awarded the Monty Porter Medal to its first grade Player of the Year. Personal life His marriage to his wife Nola Messiter was long-standing and they had three children. His son Michael made 154 first-grade appearances for the Cronulla club in an injury-affected career between 1984 and 1994. Monty Porter had suffered from Parkinson's disease for some years before his death. He died on 24 January 2011 aged 76.

It was released on September 3, 2008 through King Records. This album is the first and only to feature vocalists Takashi Utsunomiya, Yoshimi Iwasaki and Ayaka Naito. It is also the first album with vocalists Miki Masuda and Minami Kuribayashi and the last to feature long time vocalists YUUKI, KAORI, and Haruka Shimotsuki. The album debuted at No. 3 on the Oricon weekly album charts, selling over 45,000 copies in its initial week. Moira's plot and Greek setting is very loosely modeled after real-life Greek mythology, the Iliad, and Heinrich Schliemann's discovery of the lost city of Troy (Ilion) using the epic as his guide during the late 19th century. Plot The album begins with Thanatos, the god of death, revealing his plan to overthrow his mother Moira, the goddess of destiny and creator of all life, whom he sees as cruel and merciless, by using a human who will become his vessel (\\"Lord of Hades - Thanatos\\"). The frame story concerns a Russian rags-to-riches billionaire named Alexei Romanovich Zvolinsky (based on the real-life Schliemann), who pursues his lifelong dream to unearth physical evidence of the Elefseya (–≠–õ—ç—Ñ—Å–µ–∏–∞), an ancient epic he has read and held dear since childhood, despite mockery from his peers. Eventually, with the support of his wife Eirene and his men, Zvolinsky succeeds in discovering the ruins of the lost city of Ilion (\\"Life's like a Nesting Doll - Matryoshka\\"). The Elefseya begins with an account of Moira's creation of gods and men out of Chaos (\\"Myth - Mythos\\"), before moving on to the story of Elefseus (Elef) and his twin sister Artemisia (Misia), who grew up in the countryside of Arcadia without a care in the world until one day when their parents, Polydeuces and Elfina, were killed by a general named Scorpius (\\"The Fated Twins - Didymoi\\"), who sells them into slavery (\\"The Slave Market - Douloi\\"). Meanwhile, the crown prince of Arcadia, Leontius, son of King Demetrius, is concerned about the invading Barbaroi peoples in Anatolia and a certain prophecy that foretells the destruction of Ilion by \\"a beast clad in iron\\" (\\"The Hero of the Thunderer's Realm - Leontius\\"). It is revealed that Elef and Misia are Leontius' biological siblings who were adopted by Polydeuces after an oracle declared that \\"The one born when darkness (Erebos) devours the sun (Helios) will weave destruction.\\" Misia briefly becomes the apprentice of courtesans named Cassandra and Melissa, while Elef is placed among the workers building Ilion's wall, where he is physically abused and molested by the sadistic high priest Nestor. Elef discovers that he can see shadows swarming over those destined to die soon and soon grows to resent the gods and fate, thereby slowly molding him into a vessel fit for Thanatos. Eventually, Elef is reunited with Misia after rescuing her from Nestor. They and another slave child named Orion then escape captivity on a boat before the three are separated during a shipwreck (\\"Wind City of Death and Laments - Ilion\\"). While a blinded Misia ends up on the island of Lesbos and taken under the sibyl Sophia (\\"The Island of Holy Poets - Lesbos\\"), Elef becomes an apprentice to the blind poet Milos, joining him in his travels until they come upon the ruins of the youth's home. Milos then releases Elef from his service and advises him to go to Lesbos where \\"an old friend\\" resides who could ease his heart (\\"Towards the Other Side of the Distant Horizon - Horizontas\\"). Years later, Elef is still on his quest to find Misia. Arcadian troops defeat and conquer the Amazons ruled by Queen Alexandra; she is smitten with Leontius after he nobly refuses to kill her. Scorpius, resenting the fact that he is King Demetrius' illegitimate son born of a concubine, secretly plots to seize the throne (\\"The Chronicles of the Dying - Historia\\"). Under Sophia's guidance, Misia has grown into a young woman who can read the stars to foretell the future (\\"Sibyl of the Star Goddess - Artemisia\\"). Though concerned by foreboding events relating to herself and her brother, Artemisia accepts her fate has in store when she offers herself to Scorpius as a sacrifice to the water god Hydra in place of Sophia's assistant Phyllis. Elef arrives to Lesbos too late to find Artemisia already dead (\\"The Dying Virgin with the Moon's reflection in Her Hand - Parthenos\\"); consumed in grief and utter hatred, he embraces Thanatos's temptation to enact revenge on those who wronged him. Killing his former slave masters in Ilion, Elef - now going by the name of 'Amethystos' - allies himself with the Barbaroi and gathers an army of freed slaves. Orion, who had become a famed archer in the Arcadian army and (mistakenly) believed by many to be Leontius' lost sibling, is implied to have assassinated the aged Demetrius in the meantime; he is killed by Scorpius, who is in turn defeated by Leontius (\\"Hero of the Slaves - Elefseus\\"). As the battle between Elef/Amethystos and Leontius become inevitable, Queen Isadora (who knows the truth about Amethystos) unsuccessfully tries to dissuade her son from fighting his own brother, but Leontius leaves before she can divulge the truth. Amethystos and his army invade Ilion, thereby fulfilling the prophecies of its destruction. He then fights Leontius in single combat, but as he was about to launch the killing blow, Isadora steps in between them, resulting in both Leontius' and Isadora's deaths (\\"The Battle of the Dying Heroes - Heromachia\\"). Fulfilling Thanatos' prediction that he will be fully united with his human vessel once he slays his own mother, Elef/Amethystos - now fused with the god - opens the Gates of Hades before confronting Moira, at which point the Elefseya abruptly ends. The album concludes with Alexei musing on how the battle between Thanatos and Moira may have ended, as Eirene arrives to reveal that she is pregnant with twins, implying that history is going to repeat itself (\\"The Myth Ends - Telos\\").

As of August 2019, it had 579 stations and 4,981 bicycles, all owned by these local governments and operated by contractor Motivate International. Opened in September 2010, the system was the largest bike sharing service in the United States until New York City's Citi Bike began operations in May 2013. History =Genesis= Eastern Market Metro station The SmartBike DC bike sharing service, a predecessor to Capital Bikeshare, debuted in 2008 with 10 stations and 120 bicycles. It was the first of its kind in the United States. D.C. Department of Transportation Director Gabe Klein came into office four months later and was eager to expand it, but found the private partner had a \\"lackluster commitment.\\" Because the agreement specifically prohibited DDOT from paying for anything related to SmartBike, an expansion required DDOT to renegotiate the contract. But in his first meeting with Clear Channel he found that Clear Channel believed they had gotten a bad deal on the original contract that created SmartBike; that following their purchase by Bain Capital they were no longer interested in \\"municipal street furniture\\" and that they had neither desire nor obligation to expand the program. In addition, it was difficult and expensive to install new stations, because they required the local utility company to bring electricity to each station. As a result, Klein chose to end the program and instead work with Arlington County, Virginia, to build a new, regional bikesharing program to be called Capital Bikeshare. Capital Bikeshare was to be owned by the local governments and operated by a private operator. Alta Bike Share received the operations contract. Planning and implementation costs for the new system totaled $5 million. =Launch= The new service launched in September 2010 with 400 bicycles at 49 stations. Shortly thereafter, in January 2011, SmartBike DC ceased operations. Planning and implementation costs for Capital Bikeshare totaled $5 million, with additional first-year operating costs of million for 100 stations. The District's share of planning, implementation and first-year operating costs was partially financed by a $6 million grant by the United States Department of Transportation. Arlington County's operating cost share of the plan was $835,000 for the first year, funded by public contributions including a grant from the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation as well as subsidies from Arlington County Transportation, Crystal City Business Improvement District, and the Potomac Yard Transportation Management Association. In April 2011, Capital Bikeshare administrators said they expect earned revenue to cover 50% of the system's annual operating costs. The District of Columbia also planned to sell advertising on Capital Bikeshare stations with the goal of raising . By February 2011, Capital Bikeshare had expanded to 100 stations in the District of Columbia and 14 stations in the Pentagon City, Potomac Yard, and Crystal City neighborhoods in Arlington. In April 2011, it had 11,000 members and 1,100 bikes in circulation. In September 2011, Capital Bikeshare announced it had reached 18,000 members and one million rides in its first year of operation, doubling initial expectations. During the summer of 2013, riders averaged almost 300,000 rides per month. That means that during the peak season, each bike was being used about four times per day. Throughout 2013, users traveled almost 2.5 million miles and burned 100 million calories. The average weekly savings was calculated as $15.39; the total annual savings for the roughly 24,000 members was about $370,000. The National Park Service originally prohibited Capital Bikeshare stations on the property it manages, including large areas such as the National Mall. However, the agency later reversed itself and said that it would work to include new stations in future expansions. The first two of five approved Capital Bikeshare stations opened on the National Mall on March 16, 2012, shortly before the start of the 2012 National Cherry Blossom Festival. In 2010, an unlisted Bikeshare station was installed on the White House grounds, inaccessible to the public. It was removed in August 2017 at the request of the Trump Administration. Also in March 2012, the Arlington County government gave away 550 red Capital Bikeshare helmets and twice as many flashing safety lights as part of a promotion. =Expansion= Capital Bikeshare demonstration in Times Square, New York City Capital Bikeshare has grown steadily, which has driven demand for more stations and bikes. Transportation agencies in each jurisdiction select the location of the rental stations, as well as the number of bike docks, depending on planners' estimates of local demand. Most of the system's users live in or near the city center; stations in the poorer eastern portion of the city are comparatively underused. Station in the George Washington University In 2010, a local transportation official said that the system could be expanded further throughout the D.C. area and have as many as 5,000 bicycles within a few years. In fall 2011, the District Department of Transportation announced plans to add 32 stations and expand 18 existing ones by year's end, then add 50 more in 2012. Arlington County also announced plans to add 30 stations in fall 2011, primarily along the densely populated corridor between the Rosslyn and Ballston neighborhoods, and 30 more in 2012. In October 2011, the neighboring city of Alexandria, Virginia, approved plans to deploy 54 bicycles at six stations in the Old Town and Carlyle neighborhoods in 2012, then add six more stations in 2013. The cost of the first year would be $400,000, including operating costs of $100,440. The first eight Alexandria stations were deployed in August 2012. Montgomery County, Maryland, similarly approved plans to install 20 stations and 200 bikes in the Rockville and Shady Grove areas near Washington Metro stations and high- traffic destinations such as Montgomery College and Rockville Town Center. The expansion will be paid for by a $1.288 million grant from the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board with a $688,000 local match. Officials also cited plans to add 50 stations and 400 bicycles in southern areas of the county, including Bethesda, Silver Spring, Friendship Heights, and Takoma Park. However, bicycling advocates cautioned that clusters of stations in the county could be too far from each other as well as the larger network of stations within neighboring Washington, D.C. There was also concern that the county has too few bike lanes and trails to support the expected number of users. Despite these concerns, Montgomery County added its first stations in May 2013. By September 2012, these additions and expansions were to have brought the network to 288 stations and 2,800 bikes in four jurisdictions. In 2014, plans to add about 60 stations were put on hold after CaBi's main source for the bikes, the Montreal-based Public Bike System Co., went bankrupt. Over the next year, Capital Bikeshare bought used bikes and docks from the Ottawa bikeshare system, and new bikes from Motivate, a \\"New York-based company formed by investors who purchased previous operator Alta Bicycle Share.\\" The expansion resumed in late 2015. In August 2015, Capital Bikeshare announced that it had found a new equipment supplier and would add 435 bikes and 40 stations in D.C. and 140 bikes and 20 stations elsewhere. It also reported having 29,000 members who had taken a total of more than 10.5 million trips. On September 1, 2016, the system celebrated the installation of its 400th station at Division Ave & Foote St NE in Washington, DC. On October 21, 2016, Fairfax County, Virginia deployed 29 stations and 212 bikes in the Reston and Tysons Corner areas. On June 1, 2018, Capital Bikeshare expanded its territory for bike rentals, establishing itself in Prince George‚Äôs County, which became the sixth jurisdiction to join the system. An official ceremony kicking off the service was held on June 1. Stations are located in Largo and Hyattsville with an expansion planned along the Route 1 corridor and National Harbor. In September 2018, Capital Bikeshare offered e-bike as pilot, Capital Bikeshare Plus, but brake problems ended the pilot on April 14, 2019. In May 2019, 11 new stations were added in the seventh member jurisdiction, Falls Church, Virginia.Link  Technology  Capital Bikeshare automated rental facilities are powered with solar panels. Capital Bikeshare uses the BIXI-branded system provided by Montreal-based PBSC Urban Solutions. The platform behind the bike share system is created by 8D Technologies, who also supply the server technology for BIXI Montr√©al, Citi Bike in New York City, Santander Cycles in London, and others. Rental stations are automated and powered by solar panels, allowing them to be located anywhere space is available. A wireless data link connects the docks and station kiosk to a central bike-tracking and billing database. Riders can use the Capital Bikeshare website and smartphone applications to see where rental stations are located and how many bikes and empty docks they have. Each bike dock has a repair button; users press this to report a damaged or malfunctioning bike and take it out of service. Riders are expected to notify Capital Bikeshare if a bike is unable to dock at a station and are responsible for the rented bike until it has been returned. The red- colored aluminum unisex bicycles have three gears, an adjustable seat, and a front basket as well as a headlight and twin red taillights that are powered whenever the bicycle is in motion. Unlike some other networks, Capital Bikeshare maintains service year-round except during severe weather. While all seven member jurisdictions own the physical infrastructure (bikes and docks), operations are handled by Motivate which has been owned by Lyft since 2018.https://www.motivateco.com/bike-share-leader-motivate-announces- transformative-agreement-with-lyft-to-advance-the-future-of-urban- transportation/ In May 2011, it cost $41,500 to install a station with six docks and $49,300 each for larger stations with 14 docks. Each bicycle cost about $1,000, and the annual operating cost per bike was $1,860. Pricing Capital Bikeshare users in the Dupont Circle neighborhood , Capital Bikeshare has two payment options: swiping a credit card at a dock or signing up online. At any dock, riders may purchase a single trip ($2), a 24-hour pass ($8), or a 3-day pass ($17), swiping a credit card at the station's kiosk to receive a code to unlock a bike. Online, riders may purchase passes for a month ($28) or a year ($85 if paid in one lump; $96 if paid in monthly increments of $8); these riders are mailed an RFID key that can unlock bikes without a code, or can pick their key up at select docking stations. Any rider may take unlimited trips of up to 30 minutes, measured from when the bike is withdrawn from a dock to when it is returned. (If a destination station is full, riders can use the kiosk to get 15 more free minutes to return the bike to another location.) Longer trips incur fees for each additional half-hour on a scale that rises from $1.50 to $8.00. These prices are designed to encourage short trips from place to place instead of longer leisure rides. A replacement fee of $1,000 is charged to the credit card on file if a rented bike is not returned within 24 hours. The one-trip fare was introduced in June 2016 during WMATA's SafeTrack program, which would shut down segments of the Washington Metro for the following year.

An example is an infantryman reloading before entering a hostile building, concerned about ammunition. Tactical doctrine states that one should always have a full magazine before entering the building or hostile situation, but it is also a bad practice to throw away ammunition in case it is needed. A tactical reload is executed by ejecting the magazine with the hand holding the weapon while drawing a new magazine from its place on the shooter's body. Before the used magazine drops out, the shooter takes it with the fourth and fifth finger of the hand holding the fresh magazine, and inserts the fresh magazine with the thumb and index finger. This retains the partially expended magazine for use later. Advantages and disadvantages The main advantage of performing a tactical reload as opposed to a speed reload is the retaining of the rounds left in the partially spent magazine for future use.

This is quite similar to a regular reload of a weapon, but when well performed can have a large time advantage. The tactical advantage here is lost with closed bolt weapons that do not have a round in the chamber, as the gun will then require cocking with the new magazine inserted to chamber the new rounds. This does not apply to open bolt weapons, as they do not require charging. A speed reload is often thought to be more or less the opposite of a tactical reload. Advantages and Disadvantages The main advantage of a speed reload is quite simply speed. If done right, it should take less than three seconds. The main disadvantages of a speed reload are that if there are rounds left in your ejected magazine, you will lose them, and it is much louder than a tactical reload.

Trail developed a passion for writing, quitting school at the age of 16 to devote his time to it. Likewise, his interest in gangsters such as Al Capone began at a young age, and it was stated by Hannibal Coons that his brother Maurice \\"was interested in gangsters as other men are interested in postage stamps, old coins, or spread-eagled butterflies.‚Äù Throughout the rest of his teens and early twenties, Maurice Coons used a variety of pseudonyms, writing various crime and detective stories for pulp magazines. During this time, he visited New York City, eventually quitting home to live in the vicinity of Chicago, where he wrote Scarface. = Chicago & Scarface = Not much is known about Trail's time in Illinois. He lived in Oak Park, Illinois, a town adjacent to the west side of Chicago, where he worked on composing Scarface daily in his sun-room. He did not live there long enough to be recorded by an official U.S. Census. Trail spent much of the rest of his time in Chicago, supposedly being associated with local Sicilian gangs by an Italian-American lawyer with whom he was acquainted. From then on, Trail spent his nights socializing with gang members in order to gain ideas for his novel. Trail published Scarface during 1930. Though Trail never formally met Al Capone, with whom his novel was mainly concerned, Capone may have known of the work. = Selling Scarface = Producer Howard Hughes eventually approached Trail about his novel with the interest of adapting it as a movie. Trail sold the rights to Scarface to Hughes for $25,000, relocating to Los Angeles in the process, where he lived at 3811 Delman Torrace St.Ancestry.com - \\"1930 United States Federal Census.\\" Accessed February 2, 2017. After selling the rights to Scarface, W.R. Burnett, who worked on the screenplay, stated that Trail began to struggle with alcoholism. Trail lived flamboyantly in Hollywood, rapidly gaining weight, wearing wide-brimmed Borsalino hats, and hiring a servant named Elijah Ford. = Death = Trail never lived to see the movie Scarface finished, as during October 1930 he died of heart failure at the Paramount Theatre.Wilson, Scott.

The Thirteenth Guest  Trail's first novel, published first during 1929, was named The Thirteenth Guest, and concerned the investigation of the murder of fictional character Marie Morgan.

The scene is Morgan's grandfather's mansion, where he was also murdered 13 years prior.‚ÄúSpeed Dugan.‚Äù Accessed January 27, 2017. http://www.thrillingdetective.com/more_eyes/13th_guest.html.

Scarface  Trail's most famous novel, published first during 1930, details the life of Tony \\"Scarface\\" Camonte, a character based on gangster Al Capone. The protagonist has the same first name for all three of the Scarface works. After the release of the 1932 movie, at which time Trail was already dead, Capone reportedly sent some of his men to question screenwriter Ben Hecht after Capone was offended at the movie's portrayal of him by actor Paul Muni.

It proposed amendments to Chapter 113 of Title 18 of the United States Code that would authorize the Attorney General to bring an in rem action against any domain name found \\"dedicated to infringing activities\\", as defined within the text of the bill. Upon bringing such an action, and obtaining an order for relief, the registrar of, or registry affiliated with, the infringing domain would be compelled to \\"suspend operation of and lock the domain name.\\" The bill was supported by the Motion Picture Association of America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Screen Actors Guild, Viacom, and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States. It was opposed by organizations and individuals such as Center for Democracy and Technology, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Demand Progress, the Distributed Computing Industry Association, Tim Berners-Lee, the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights Watch.Web Censorship Bill Sails Through Senate Committee, Wired, November 18, 2010 The bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee with a vote of 19-0 but never received a full vote on the Senate floor. Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) announced he would take the steps necessary to halt COICA so it is not enacted into law in 2010, and was successful, effectively killing this bill and requiring it to be resubmitted and for it to make it through a new committee again in 2011 with a different makeup of its members. The Act was rewritten as the Protect IP Act. Scope =Definition of infringement= The text of the bill defined an infringing website as one that is: > (A) primarily designed, has no demonstrable, commercially significant > purpose or use other than, or is marketed by its operator, or by a person > acting in concert with the operator, to offer: > >> (i) goods or services in violation of title 17, United States Code, or enable or facilitate a violation of title 17, United States Code, including by offering or providing access to, without the authorization of the copyright owner or otherwise by operation of law, copies of, or public performance or display of, works protected by title 17, in complete or substantially complete form, by any means, including by means of download, transmission, or otherwise, including the provision of a link or aggregated links to other sites or Internet resources for obtaining such copies for accessing such performance or displays; or (ii) to sell or distribute goods, services, or materials bearing a counterfeit mark, as that term is defined in section 34(d) of the Act entitled 'An Act to provide for the registration and protection of trademarks used in commerce, to carry out the provisions of certain international conventions, and for other purposes', approved July 5, 1946 (commonly referred to as the 'Trademark Act of 1946' or the 'Lanham Act'; (d)); and > > (B) engaged in the activities described in subparagraph (A), and when taken > together, such activities are central to the activity of the Internet site > or sites accessed through a specific domain name. =Powers granted= The bill, if passed, would have allowed the Attorney General to bring an in rem action against the infringing domain name in United States District Court, and seek an order requesting injunctive relief. If granted, such an order would compel the register of the domain name in question to take the following actions: > Upon receipt of such order, the domain name registrar or domain name > registry shall suspend operation of, and may lock, the domain name. =Nondomestic domains= If the infringing website had not been located in the United States, the bill empowered the Attorney General to bring a similar action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Should an order for injunctive relief been granted, the Attorney General would then have been empowered to serve said order upon, and compel to perform the actions listed: > (i) a service provider, as that term is defined in section 512(k)(1) of > title 17, United States Code, or other operator of a domain name system > server shall take reasonable steps that will prevent a domain name from > resolving to that domain name's Internet protocol address; (ii) a financial > transaction provider, as that term is defined in section 5362(4) of title > 31, United States Code, shall take reasonable measures, as expeditiously as > practical, to prevent-- > >> (I) its service from processing transactions for customers located within the United States based on purchases associated with the domain name; and (II) its trademarks from being authorized for use on Internet sites associated with such domain name; and > > (iii) a service that serves contextual or display advertisements to Internet > sites shall take reasonable measures, as expeditiously as practical, to > prevent its network from serving advertisements to an Internet site accessed > through such domain name. =Enforcement= Should a party fail to comply with an order served upon it by the Attorney General, the Attorney General would have been able to bring an in personam action against the party in question. =Justice Department lists= The bill also called for the creation, by the Justice Department, of two publicly available lists of domain names. The first list would have been composed of domain names against which the Attorney General has obtained injunctions. Domestic domains would be required to be locked by their registrars, and service providers, financial institutions, and advertisers would be required to block service to any nondomestic domains on this list. The second list would be a list of domains alleged by the Justice Department to be infringing, but against which no action had been taken. Any service provider who willingly took steps to block access to sites on this second list would gain immunity from prosecution under this bill. Proposed amendment Due to various concerns from outside parties, Senator Patrick Leahy proposed an amendment to the legislation that responded to these concerns, while preserving the purpose of the legislation. The amendment:COICA Managers Amendment judiciary.senate.gov, archived version of November 6, 2010.Outcry prompts amendments to online IP protection bill By Jaikumar Vijayan, computerworld.com September 29, 2010 * Struck provisions that would have authorized the Justice Department to publish a listing of domain names that provided access to websites dedicated to infringing activities, but against which it did not to seek a court order under the Act, in response to concerns from Internet service providers (ISPs), online companies, and public interest groups. * Eased the burden on ISPs and payment processors that are required to take action pursuant to this Act. The amendment specified that an ISP shall not be required to modify its network or facilities to comply with an order or take steps with respect to domain name lookups performed by others. In addition, the amendment requires only that ISPs and payment processors act as expeditiously as reasonable. * Provided more explicit protection from legal liability for any third-party registrar, registry, ISP, payment processor or advertising network that takes action pursuant to this Act. * Required the Attorney General to develop a process in consultation with other law enforcement agencies to coordinate related investigations. Public reaction Public reaction to the bill was negative by consumer groups, while the bill was generally lauded by artist's rights groups, various labor unions, and the entertainment and publishing industries. The announcement of the bill was rapidly followed by a wave of protest from digital rights activists, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation.Demand Progress's petition against COICA garnered more than 300,000 signatures. On September 30, 2010, the EFF posted an update to their Deeplinks Blog, announcing that the hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee had been delayed until after the 2010 midterm elections. On November 18, 2010, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the bipartisan bill. On November 26, 2010, the New York Times reported that the U.S. government had seized the domain names of 82 websites, which digital rights advocates used as an example of overreaching enforcement that can already occur under current law, which they believe will take place more frequently and on a broader basis under the more lenient enforcement requirements set by COICA. =Senate opposition= Oregon Democratic Senator Ron Wyden opposed the bill after it passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on November 18, 2010, saying that unless it is changed, he will prevent it from coming to a vote on the full Senate floor this year. He said: > It seems to me that online copyright infringement is a legitimate problem, > but it seems to me that COICA as written is the wrong medicine. Deploying > this statute to combat online copyright infringement seems almost like using > a bunker-busting cluster bomb when what you really need is a precision- > guided missile. The collateral damage of this statute could be American > innovation, American jobs, and a secure Internet.

He published a number of novellas and stories in the 1880s and 1890s, including A Greedy Peasant (1886), and the two epic novels The Gardenins (1889), and Change (1891). When The Gardenins was republished in 1908, it featured a preface by Leo Tolstoy, who admired Ertel‚Äôs work. After his death, his widow Marya Vasilievna lived in Moscow, taking in paying guests who had come to learn Russian; she was helped by their younger daughter, Elena (Lolya or Lola), who became a literary translator. Their elder daughter also became a literary translator, working in England as Natalie Duddington. Among Madame Ertel‚Äôs pupils was Bruce Lockhart; in his famous Memoirs of a British Agent (1932) he recorded that, thanks to her and Lolya, he became proficient in Russian, acquired a modicum of culture, and developed a deep affection for all things Russian. Marya died in the typhus epidemic in 1919; Lolya survived it and managed to escape to Britain in 1927.

New DDOT Director Gabe Klein came into office four months after the program launched eager to expand it, but found the private partner had a \\"lackluster commitment.\\" The agreement specifically prohibited DDOT from paying for anything related to SmartBike, so an expansion required DDOT to renegotiate the contract. In his first meeting with Clear Channel he found that Clear Channel believed they had gotten a bad deal on the original bus shelter contract, that following their purchase by Bain Capital they were no longer interested in ‚Äúmunicipal street furniture‚Äù and that they had neither desire nor obligation to expand the program. As a result, Klein chose to fold the program and instead partner with Arlington County, VA to build the regional bikesharing program Capital Bikeshare. A few months after Capital Bikeshare started in late 2010, Smart Bike DC ceased operations. Afterwards, the bikes were donated by ClearChannel to a Baltimore charity, the stations were removed at ClearChannel's expense and the contract was modified to remove all references to SmartBike. Once closure was guaranteed, the program was criticized by The Washington City Paper for its low usage and limited number of bike stations.DePillis, Lydia, R.I.P. SmartBike, Good Riddance, Washington City Paper, September 16, 2010: Daily SmartBike use rarely exceeded one ride per bicycle per day, with a total of only 1,696 SmartBike subscribers - 220 of whom had never activated their subscription cards, and 242 of whom had never rented a SmartBike. Despite this, the program is considered a success by others as it provided proof of concept for its improved and vastly expanded replacement, Capital Bikeshare, as well as other bikeshare systems across the nation. It also allowed DDOT to develop in-house knowledge of bikesharing. See also *Capital Bikeshare *Transportation in Washington, D.C. References Community bicycle programs Cycling in Washington, D.C.

Life Caroline Wuiet, daughter of an organist, was born in Rambouillet, France. She was considered a child prodigy at age five and was presented to Queen Marie-Antoinette by Princess de Lamballe. The queen took her as an adopted daughter and saw that she received an education in the arts. Wuiet studied music under Andre Gr√©try, painting with Greuze and theater with Beaumarchais.David Charlton, \\"Wuiet, Caroline,\\" Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online (Oxford University Press), accessed 2017. Wuiet began her career as a composer and librettist at the age of eighteen with Le trompeur tromp√©, but was disappointed that the opera was not performed. She was given the opportunity to write a sequel to Gretry's L'√©preuve villageoise (1784), and wrote both the music and libretto for L'Heureuse erreur with more success. She later became a concert pianist, still enjoying the patronage of Marie- Antoinette. As a Royalist, Wuiet went into hiding during the French Revolution and remained there through the Reign of Terror, leaving journals regarding the years of the French Revolution.Jacqueline Letzter and Robert Adelson, Women Writing Opera (Berkeley: Univ of California Press, 2001) . Under the French Directory, Wuiet began composing again and enjoyed more success with sonatas. During this time, she also established a newspaper and wrote for other publications. She married Colonel Baron Joseph Auffdiener in 1807 and went with him to Lisbon where he was imprisoned and died. Wuiet returned to France and continued writing and composing, but suffered from mental disorders and died homeless after living in the park at St. Cloud, France. She also wrote and composed under her married name, Aufdiener, and the pseudonym Donna Elidora.

Setting This ecoregion covers the Piedmont region of the eastern United States, stretching in a broad arc from extreme southwest New Jersey southwest to Mississippi. It is distinguished from neighboring ecoregions by elevation and vegetation. At lower elevations to the east are the Middle Atlantic coastal forests on the Atlantic coastal plain. Similarly, the Southeastern conifer forests occupy the Gulf coastal plain to the south. Higher, and to the north and west, are the Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests and the Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests of the Appalachian Mountains. Small stands of these forests extend into north Florida. Climate This ecoregion lies within the Cfa K√∂ppen climate zones, and the Cf and Do Trewartha climate zones, placing it in the humid subtropical climate category, with hot, humid summers, and mild to cool winters. The coldest month mean temperature at or above freezing, and significant precipitation in all seasons. Flora Both oaks (Quercus spp.) and hickories (Carya spp.) are abundant in this ecoregion. Additionally, some 3,635 species of native herbaceous and shrub species have been recorded here. American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was formerly an important tree in this ecoregion, but its population was destroyed by the chestnut blight in the early 20th century. It still persists as an understory tree, but is often killed by the blight before it matures. =Oak-hickory forests= The most common oaks (Quercus spp.) of this ecoregion are white oak (Quercus alba), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), black oak (Quercus velutina), and scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea). Black and scarlet grow in open forests. Black oak grows in nearly single-species stands on dry, exposed sites. Scarlet oak grows in various habitats. Chestnut oak (Quercus prinus) is found on ridgetops. The hickories (Carya spp.) of this ecoregion are identifiable by their pinnately compound leaves. They include pignut (Carya glabra) and mockernut hickory (Carya tomentosa), both of which grow on a variety of sites from dry ridges to mesic habitats. Understory trees include sassafras (Sassafras albidum), hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), and green hawthorn (Crataegus viridis). Flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) blooms in early spring. Shrubs include highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium), mapleleaf viburnum (Viburnum acerifolium), huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata), mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia). Common pine (Pinus spp.) species are shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). The pine forests are regenerated by fire. Without fire, hardwood species grow in below the pines. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum), a shade tolerant tree, grows amid the oaks and hickories in the northern part of this ecoregion. Small stands of these forests extend into North Florida Mesic forest in Belt Woods, Maryland =Mesic forests= Mesic forests occur in fertile, mesic, low-elevation habitats such as deep ravines and sheltered north- or east-facing slopes. Dominant trees include American beech (Fagus grandifolia), tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera), northern red oak, white ash (Fraxinus americana), black maple (Acer nigrum), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), basswood (Tilia americana), and bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis). Understory trees include pawpaw (Asimina triloba) and painted buckeye (Aesculus sylvatica). Small stands of these forests extend into North Florida. =Mesic mixed hardwood forests= Mesic mixed hardwood forests grow on mesic uplands, ravines, lower slopes, and well-drained flatwoods. Typical trees are American beech, tulip tree, various oaks and hickories, and several other hardwoods. Understory trees include American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), and American strawberry-bush (Euonymus americanus). Small stands of Mesic mixed hardwood forest extend into North Florida. =Successional forests= Successional forests include eastern juniper (Juniperus virginiana), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), and quaking (Populus tremuloides) and bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata).

Unit history =Background= On 2 April 1982, Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. Intelligence from a submarine reported the laying of a defensive minefield off the approaches to Port Stanley (the capital of the islands). Great Britain had supplied Argentina with modern influence mines, both combination magnetic and pressure activated, and had recently actually serviced them for the Argentinian Navy. The Royal Navy's mine warfare capacity was purely coastal with s with a range of around , totally unsuitable for either the distance or the conditions. A plan existed from the Cold War years for the sweeping of Soviet minefields in the English Channel and North Sea, in the event of needing to reinforce Europe in time of war with Russia. It revolved around a number of deep sea trawlers (approx ) being earmarked and kept in \\"readiness\\" for conversion. Five ships were called to Rosyth dockyard where in three days they were stripped of their fishing equipment, their holds were emptied of frozen fish, and Extremely Deep Armed Team Sweep (EDATS) equipment was fitted. They were hastily commissioned, and crews, mainly from the Rosyth-based 1st MCM Squadron were assembled, bolstered by technical specialists from elsewhere. The group was designated the 11th MCM Squadron under the command of Lieutenant-Commander Martyn Holloway, the captain of . The plan was based on the assumption that the Argentinians would have surrendered by the time they got there, and the sweepers would simply clear the minefields. They were unarmed except for two light machine guns on the bridge wings, with a single engine, single screw configuration, only two or three watertight compartments, and were inherently difficult to handle. =Training and preparation= After a two-day work-up, basic drills on operating unfamiliar equipment were carried out with instruction from the merchant service crews, who then disembarked. Four of the ships sailed on 25 April and followed the next day, to catch them up en route. Drills were practised with the mainly unfamiliar EDATS in the waters off North Africa. As the weather warmed, the daily task of locating discarded fish around the ships became more important, the stench often leading to fish that had slid under equipment before decaying. On 11 May, the squadron anchored off Ascension Island, and refuelled, although the ships had the capacity to travel the to the operational area and return to the UK on one tank. The ships were then ordered to sail for South Georgia on the 13th, arriving on 25 May. They were used there as utility vessels, transporting stores and men, particularly Gurkhas, Scots and Welsh Guards between the ships they had made the journey down on, to the generally smaller craft which would take them to the landing, often in appalling conditions of force 10 katabatic winds and driving snow. They were then ordered on 5 June to sail to the edge of the Total Exclusion Zone (TEZ) which was in theory outside the range of land-based aircraft. After the landings, the squadron sailed into and anchored in \\"bomb alley\\" in San Carlos Water on 9 June. =The war zone= The Argentines had not surrendered, so these ships were then used at night to transport Special Forces, such as SAS and Royal Marines, mainly into West Falkland, where they were inserted covertly by Gemini RHIB. They had to be back inside the Rapier (air defence missile system) protection of San Carlos or Teal Inlet by dawn as they were defenceless to air attack in the open sea. This was a hazardous undertaking, operating in confined and shallow waters with photocopies of hand drawn charts from the 1920s in many cases. On one occasion, HMS Pict was dropping troops at Saunders Island with an onshore force 7 and struck a reef just as the Geminis were slipped down the rear trawlnet chute. Luckily the ship came off with no more than a large dent in the bottom. On the night of 11 June, HMS Pict was ordered to sweep the entry to Berkeley Sound and mark a cleared channel for a frigate to enter and shell with fire support (NGFS), the Argentinian mountain positions guarding Port Stanley for the final infantry assault. The five ships were utilised as general workhorses, often in circumstances where their potential loss was viewed as a good alternative to a major fleet unit. The Argentinian forces in the Falklands surrendered on 14 June, and the ships were ordered to proceed as soon as possible to Port Stanley and clear the immediate approach to the harbour. After entering port, there followed several days of uncertainty as to whether or not the forces on the Argentine mainland would carry on the fight. Minesweeping, especially in EDATS, leaves a minesweeper extremely vulnerable to air attack. Whilst in harbour, the MCD specialists in the squadron had set up a Trisponder network, which allows navigational accuracy to in the Port Stanley approaches. Two Argentinian officers presented a chart showing the locations that 21 mines were laid, in two fields with a defined channel between them. The more sophisticated influence mines had apparently been utilised in a defensive pattern off Buenos Aires, in case of a British attack on the mainland, and very simple contact moored mines were laid in the Falklands. It was eventually judged safe on 22 June to commence the clearance operations. Initially using the safer but less sure Oropesa system, the squadron swept 11 of the mines. Bad weather‚Äîup to force 12 on occasions‚Äîseemed to have moved the rest out of position. The very accurate EDATS system was then used to ensure full clearance. The operation was completed on 5 July. On the 13th, the squadron was released for a return to the UK via Gibraltar, a total distance of , arriving in mid-August, when the individual ships were returned to their owners.

It is part of a group of macroraptorial sperm whales which all shared several features for the purpose of hunting large prey, such as deeply-rooted and thick teeth. Acrophyseter measured , making it the smallest raptorial sperm whale. Because of its short pointed snout, and its strong curved front teeth, it probably fed on the large marine vertebrates of its time, such as seals and other whales. Taxonomy Acrophyseter, together with Brygmophyseter, Livyatan, and Zygophyseter, belong to a group of macroraptorial sperm whales, which have adaptations to hunting large prey. They all have large, deeply rooted teeth coated in enamel in both the upper and lower jaws, unlike the modern sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) which lacks enamel and teeth in the upper jaw. Raptorials are thought to have either evolved these adaptations from a basilosaurid-like ancestor or independently once or twice within the group. The extinct subfamily Hoplocetinae has been proposed to house this group, alongside the genera Scaldicetus, Diaphorocetus, Idiorophus, and Hoplocetus. This subfamily is paraphyletic, in that it does not consist of a common ancestor and all of its descendants. The genus Acrophyseter houses two species. The type species, A. deinodon, was discovered in the Sud-Sacaco locality of the Pisco Formation in Peru, dating back to the Tortonian‚ÄìMessinian stages of the Miocene around 8.5‚Äì6.7 million years ago (mya); the holotype specimen, MNHN SAS 1626, represents a mature individual and consists of a skull and jaw with most of the teeth intact. The second species, A. robustus, is known from a skull also from the Pisco Formation in the Cerro la Bruja locality, named MUSM 2182, dating back to the Serravallian‚ÄìTortonian stages of the Miocene, older than at least 9.2 mya. A second A. deinodon specimen of a right parietal bone from the Aguada de Lomas locality was named MNHM F-PPI 272 and dated to the Messinian 6.9‚Äì6.7 mya, though it is possible it actually represents A. robustus. MUSM 1399 of a skull with the front half of the snout missing from the Cerro La Bruja locality was referred to Acrophyseter but has not been given a species designation. A. robustus had a more pointed snout, straighter teeth, a decreasing width of the mandible from front to back, a groove on the side of its snout, and a more well-defined supracranial basin which housed the melon organ than A. deinodon. The genus name Acrophyseter is derived from the Greek ‚Äìmeaning acute, which describes the short, pointed, upturned snout‚Äìand ‚Äìwhich is the genus name for the modern sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus. The species name deinodon is from the Greek ‚Äìmeaning terrible‚Äìand ‚Äìtooth. Description Top and bottom teeth Acrophyseter was estimated to be using the distance between the cheek bones in comparison to the dimensions of Zygophyseter, which is relatively small, being the smallest of the raptorial sperm whales. Unlike the modern sperm whales, A. deinodon had teeth on both its upper and lower jaws. The teeth were robust and deeply set into the roots, particularly the front teeth, the tooth roots were comparatively thick with the thin tooth crown. The front teeth were more conical than the back teeth. The lower back teeth were close together, and the space between the teeth increased from front to back, suggesting they were used for shearing, unlike the suction-feeding modern-day sperm whales which lack teeth in their upper jaws. The front teeth were more worn on the sides, whereas the bottom teeth were more worn along the middle. It had 12 teeth in the upper jaw and 13 teeth in the bottom jaw, and like other raptorials, it had tooth enamel. The premaxillae bore three teeth, and the maxillae had nine teeth. The last bottom teeth may have contacted the roof of the mouth. Discovered along the teeth sockets was buccal exostoses, bony growths, which may have developed during biting to strengthen the teeth, acting as buttresses. The back teeth had larger buccal exostoses as they experienced more pressure during biting. The tooth count of A. robustus is unknown though thought to be similar or the same. Cementum was continually added to the teeth as they were growing, as in killer whales (Orcinus orca). Like other sperm whales, Acrophyseter had a deep basin on the top of its skull, the supracranial basin. This basin in Acrophyseter overhung the orbit around the eye, but did not extend onto the snout, unlike in other raptorials. Unlike later species of sperm whales, Acrophyseter had two nostrils. The temporal fossae on the sides of the skull were as high as they were long, unlike in Zygophyseter and Brygmophyseter, which displaced the brow ridge. The area between the condyloid process, which connects the jaw with the skull, and the teeth was probably where the masseter muscles were. The brow ridge slopes down at an angle of around 55¬∞. The nuchal crest on the back side of the skull had overhung the supracranial basin. The cheekbones were thin plates which limited the ear canals. The snout was short and, unlike in other sperm whales, had a distinct upward curve. Unlike other sperm whales, the top of the premaxillae near the vomer lacked a deep groove. The left nostril was five times bigger than the right nostril, measuring across respectively. Paleoecology The short and pointed snout, coupled with the robust, curved front teeth suggests Acrophyseter targeted large prey and perhaps used their back teeth for shearing. The Sud-Sacaco locality of the Pisco Formation has yielded several marine vertebrates, which the Acrophyseter may have preyed upon: the whale Piscolithax, the whale Piscobalaena, the seal Acrophoca, the penguin Spheniscus urbinai, the marine sloth Thalassocnus natans, the crocodile Piscogavialis, megalodon, and the broad-toothed mako shark (Cosmopolitodus hastalis). The Cerro La Bruja locality has borne the dolphin Brachydelphis, the dolphin Atocetus iquensis, the kentriodontid dolphin Belonodelphis, an unspecified beaked whale, unspecified baleen whales, an unspecified monk seal, the penguin Spheniscus muizoni, megalodon, the broad- toothed mako shark, and a species of Carcharhinus shark.

The postseason was contested by four of the six teams participating in the regular season, with the teams with the best winning percentages qualifying. In the semi-finals, the Melbourne Aces were the first team eliminated, defeated by the Adelaide Bite two games to nil in Adelaide in the minor semi-final series. The Perth Heat became the first team to qualify for the championship series, by sweeping the Sydney Blue Sox two games to nil in the major semi-final series, held in Sydney. The Blue Sox were then eliminated by the Bite in the preliminary final series, losing the series two games to one. The Heat became the inaugural ABL champions when they defeated Adelaide two games to nil in the championship series.  Format  At the conclusion of the regular season, the postseason involved the teams in a three-round structure. Each round consisted of a best-of-three game series between the respective teams. The first- and second-place teams played each other in the major semi-final, the winner of which proceeded directly to the grand final and the loser to the preliminary final. The winner of the minor semi-final between the third- and fourth-place teams also qualified for the preliminary final, while the loser was eliminated. Likewise, the winner of the preliminary final qualified for the championship series, the loser being eliminated. As in the finals series of previous Claxton Shield tournaments, though each series was hosted by a single team, the role of home team and away team alternated from game to game. For the second game in each series, the visiting team took the role of home team, fielding first, batting second, and wore their away uniform for the game.  Bracket  = Qualification = The Perth Heat and Sydney Blue Sox both clinched positions in the top four of the league at the same time: when Perth defeated the Melbourne Aces in the final game of their series at the Melbourne Showgrounds. The Adelaide Bite were the next team to secure a position in the finals, after winning the third of an expanded six-game series against the Brisbane Bandits at Coopers Stadium in Adelaide. Like Sydney, Melbourne secured fourth position through a result that did not involve them: Brisbane's loss in their final game against Adelaide eliminated them from contention for the finals, and since the Canberra Cavalry had already been eliminated by Melbourne's win in its second-last game, Melbourne qualified.  Major semi-final series  The Sydney Blue Sox hosted the Perth Heat in the major semi-final series at Blacktown Olympic Park. The Blue Sox and Heat split their season series 4‚Äì4. This included back-to-back sweeps for each team, with Perth winning the second of the two series, played in Sydney. = Game 1 = = Game 2 =  Minor semi-final series  The Adelaide Bite hosted the Melbourne Aces in the minor semi-final series at Coopers Stadium.

The albums were released in 1999 and 2003 respectively. The music for these albums was written during a four-year period when the group was working on a single song that was around an hour in length. Sleep had signed with London Records, which financed the album. When recording had finished, London Records was unhappy with the finished product and refused to release it. The album was later released in various forms by different record labels. All versions of the album received very positive reception from music critics, who described it as a high-water mark in both the stoner metal and doom metal genres.  Production  After positive reviews from the heavy metal press and the release of the album Sleep's Holy Mountain (1992) on Earache Records, Sleep's label announced that they would release their follow- up record. Sleep had been touring in Europe with Cathedral and in the United States with Hawkwind in support of Sleep's Holy Mountain when the group felt they had to write new material.Bennett, 2009. p.294 The new album was going to be an hour-long song. This song was written and practiced at sound checks, motel rooms and in friends' houses.Bennett, 2009. p.295 Matt Pike said the songwriting process was long and that they were \\"working on [the song] for like four years. We also had two other songs that were working on that were really long, too‚Äîlike 15 and 20 minutes. But we never recorded them.\\" Al Cisneros stated that smoking cannabis was important to the song's creative process: \\"I was really dependent on the space I got into when I was using it, and some of the lyrics are about that...The line, 'Drop out of life [with bong in hand],' was kind of a creed at that point.\\" The song was originally known and performed live under the title \\"Dopesmoker\\". After their tour, the group began to be interested in a Middle Eastern desert theme which led to Sleep referring to the song as \\"Jerusalem\\" during later practice sessions.Bennett, 2009. p.297 Sleep were ready to record the album in 1995 but did not record it until 1996 as the band was still contracted with Earache. Cisneros said that there was \\"about a year and half of legal wrangling between their managers and lawyers at Earache\\" and that Earache owner Digby Pearson \\"waited to make the most prime conditions for himself before he let [Sleep's] contract [go].\\" Sleep were in talks with both London Records and Elektra Records to release their next album. They chose to sign to London, as they were promised complete artistic freedom and more money, and since the label did not have any metal bands, Sleep felt they would receive special treatment.Bennett, 2009. p.293 The members of Sleep were poor, and used the majority of money they received from London Records to cover for the debt they were in at that time. The song was recorded at Record Two Studio in Comptche, California.Bennett, 2009. p.296 While recording the song, it began to develop differently from the original vision. Pike stated that the \\"song was getting slower and slower and then it got weird. We started tripping out and second guessing ourselves.\\" Recording the album was difficult. Pike recalled that \\"there was so much to memorize for that album, and we had to do it in like three different sections because a reel-to-reel only holds 22 minutes. It was really cool, but it was one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life.\\" Sleep were in the studio for one month then went home to rehearse and returned for another month. Pike noted that they ended up with two or three different versions of the song. Part of the song's signature sound is thanks to custom-built amps designed to be so loud, no one from the band was capable of going into the same room as them. More than half a dozen microphones were used to pick up the sound from the amps.  Release  Within a few weeks of signing with London, the A&R; member who was negotiating with Sleep had been transferred and replaced. After sending the finished album to London Records, the label told Sleep that they were not going to release the album in its current format.Bennett, 2009. p.298 London Records had David Sardy remix the album but the label were still confused as to what to do with the album.Bennett, 2009. p.299 Sleep refused to have the album released in any edited form which led to a deadlock between London and the band. The members of Sleep have mixed feelings whether the album should have been released in general. Cisneros felt it should not have been released, while Pike was content with its release, saying \\"We did all the work so why leave it sitting around?\\"Bennett, 2009. p.301 By 2009, there had been four versions of the album released: a rare London Records promotional disc, a bootleg with cover art by Arik Roper, the Rise Above/Music Cartel Records album, and a release by Tee Pee Records.Bennett, 2009. p.300 The Rise Above/Music Cartel release was an unauthorized edited version, released in 1999 under the title Jerusalem. Jerusalem runs at 52 minutes and is a single composition split into six identically named tracks. The version of the album titled Dopesmoker was released on April 22, 2003, by Tee Pee Records on compact disc and vinyl with a 63-minute running time. Cisneros spoke most positively about the 2003 Dopesmoker release, saying \\"I don't think the Dopesmoker thing is the exact version that we submitted, but that's the closest one that's come out of the four. If I had to pick a favorite, that would be it.\\"Bennett, 2009. p.300 Parts of the song were used in the film Broken Flowers by Jim Jarmusch. Jarmusch stated that he was a fan of Sleep and listed them along with Earth and Sunn O))) as an influence for creating the film: \\"I love these kind of visual landscapes they make, and they really inspired things for me for my film The Limits of Control\\".  Reissue  In March 2012, Southern Lord Records announced plans for a deluxe reissue of the album, adding of the pending release that \\"The audio is clearer, louder, and at last brings a true representation of Sleep's hour-plus Weedian chronicle\\". The reissue features new artwork by the band's artist Arik Roper, a recording mastered from the original studio tapes by From Ashes Rise guitarist Brad Boatright, and a live version of the song \\"Holy Mountain\\", recorded at the I-Beam in San Francisco in 1994. This version of the album reached number 14 on the Top Heatseekers chart.  Critical reception  Both Dopesmoker and early releases of the album received positive reviews from the music press. In the December 2000 issue of Spin the album was referred to as \\"brilliant\\" and as a \\"stoner touchstone\\". CMJ New Music Monthly wrote positively about the song, saying that the \\"monotony rarely becomes tedious, because Al Cisneros and company are unpredictable and sensual in their drug-induced pounding of early Sabbath terrain.\\" Online music database AllMusic gave the Jerusalem album four stars out of five stating that \\"Either version is worth investigating for adventurous metal enthusiasts, but Dopesmoker is clearly the final and definitive presentation of this work\\". In 2006, the extreme metal magazine Decibel included the album in their hall of fame of \\"extreme metal masterpieces\\".Bennett, 2009. p.292 The album continued to receive praise after the release of Dopesmoker. Eduardo Rivadavia of online music database AllMusic gave the album four and a half stars out of five stating \\"Dopesmoker is [...] an instant doom metal classic‚Äîsome might even say a masterpiece\\". The British music magazine Mojo gave the album a rating of five out of five stars proclaiming that Dopesmoker is \\"A benchmark by which all that dares call itself stoner rock must surely be judged.\\" Exclaim! praised Dopesmoker's production value and noted that the album was an \\"ultimately better version of 1999's stoner opus Jerusalem.\\" Stylus Magazine's Stewart Voegtlin defined Dopesmoker as \\"a 60-minute song about the spliff, a monstrous rock ode to stinky buds\\". Voegtlin pointed out that London Records' refusal to \\"share Sleep's affection or vision, [led the band to] disbanding in disgust. Matt Pike went on to form High on Fire; Al Cisneros and Chris Hakius contemplate the universe's navel with Om.\\" A New York Times critic wrote: \\"What seems disorienting and monochromatic at first grows richer and more rewarding upon repeated exposure. It‚Äôs like a Mark Rothko painting hitting you over the head with a bag of hammers.\\"David Rees for the New York Times Magazine. Jan 21, 2016. Letter of Recommendation: Sleep, ‚ÄòDopesmoker‚Äô The 2012 Southern Lord Records re-issue was also praised. On Metacritic, it has a score of 94 out of 100, based on 9 reviews. Exclaim! noted that this issue was \\"cleaner and more powerful, the guitars sound heavier, with a much larger presence, and the mesmerizing complexity of the track has been reinvigorated.\\" Pitchfork Media gave the album an 8.5 out of 10 and listed it as one of \\"the best new reissues\\" noting that \\"It's an hour of adventure and momentum, where the lumber and the repetition somehow always push ahead.\\" Consequence of Sound gave the album three and a half stars out of five, stating that \\"It's not for everybody, certainly; all but the biggest potheads/metalheads may burn out after so much grinding. It's no showcase for songwriting, either, but it makes up for that with heady atmosphere.\\"  Track listings  All music written and composed by Sleep.

Raghavendra Matha is located on the bank of Tungabhadra River in Mantralayam in Adoni taluk of Kurnool district in Andhra Pradesh, India. Raghavendra Math, along with Uttaradi Math and Vyasaraja Math are considered to be the three premier apostolic institutions of Dvaita Vedanta and are jointly referred as Mathatraya . It is the pontiffs and pandits of the Mathatraya that have been the principle architects of post-Madhva Dvaita Vedanta through the centuries. History According to Surendranath Dasgupta, Raghavendra Matha is one of the two mathas which branched off from the Uttaradi Math (main lineage) to spread the tattvavada in the southern part of India. It was named Kumbakonam Matha and later it was changed as Sri Vijayendra Mutt after Vijayendra Tirtha or Vijayendra Swamigal by Sudhindra Tirtha, a disciple and successor to the pontificate of Kumbakonam Matha after Vijayindra Tirtha. After Sudhindra Tirtha his disciple, the most venerated dvaita saint Raghavendra Tirtha continued in the pontifical lineage as the pontiff of the matha. After small stay at Kumbakonam, he seems to have gone on a pilgrimage tour visiting Rameshwaram, Ramnad, Srirangam, and Mathura then he moved westwards to Udupi and Subramanya, and thence to Pandharpur, Kolhapur and Bijapur. At Kolhapur, he is said to have made long stay and at Bijapur, he made many converts. After that he returned Ultimately to Kumbakonam. By 1663 he left to Mysore where he got grant from Dodda Devaraya Odeyar. Later he moved to further north and finally settled down at Mantralayam, a village on bank of river Tungabhadra in Adoni taluk in Andhra Pradesh. There on the sacred river he took Samadhi in 1671. The matha was later named after Raghavendra Tirtha as Raghavendra Matha.

It is one of the major temples in erstwhile Travancore state. Padanilam is the cultural center of Nooranad region. The temple is situated 17 km east of Kayamkulam and 7 km south west of Pandalam. The temple is dedicated to Lord Parabrahma, also known as omkaram. History http://lsgkerala.in/nooranadpanchayat/history/ Padanilam Temple is believed to be swayambhu. Its actual history and the facts about how worship started there are unknown. Padanilam has been the administrative centre of Nooranad and it has the history of intense conflict between various karakal (territories) around the temple. This was for gaining control over the temple administration and thereby controlling the entire village. Due to this pada (battle/conflict), the place is said to have got its name. It is believed that the army troops of Kayamkulam Kingdom was camped near the temple for protecting the kingdom from the attack of neighbouring kings. During this period, the village had some chieftains and their supporters. They include Noorukodi Unnithans, Kadackal Kuruppans, Vettathasaans and Vettadickal Kuruppans. Kayamkulam Raja withdrew his troops about four centuries ago. This initiated tensions between the chieftains for control of the village. Thus they divided into south and north, starting battle. The south side consisted of Noorukodi Karuppans and Kadackal Kuruppans. The other side had Vettathasans and Vettadickal Kuruppans with them. Twenty-two karakal supported their respective sides. During the battle, many soldiers of both the sides died in large numbers. They were buried in the chira near the temple. Even from very earliest of times, this temple was a blessing for the people in the surrounding areas. It is also believed that the battle was between Marthanda varma King on one side and Kayamkulam King on the other. The twenty-two karakals of Nooranad took side with the two kings. The common people started worrying about the devastation of the war and approached the Pazhoor Panamana Thampuran to find a solution to end the war. He tried to intervene but the parties were not in a position to stop. He made a tent in the eastern part of the temple and started fasting unto death. But that also did not deter the warring parties. But when he was on the verge of death due to the fast, they fearing the Brahmanasaapam, agreed to stop war. They demarcated the boundary in the north-south direction and stopped the war in the name of Parabrahma, the presiding deity of the temple. Padanilam Sivarathri Nandikeshan from Edappon kara Sivarathri is the main festival in the temple. Giant effigies of bulls, known locally as kettukala,are pulled to the temple from 15 territories (kara) of the temple. Some of these have a height of more than 50 feet. Its one of the largest festivals of its kind in Kerala. There are many people in the Nooranad area, who are involved in the making of these colossal effigies. There is a proposal in front of the Kerala Government to recognize this village as the Nandikesha Paithruka Gramam due to its cultural importance. Thousands come to the temple on Sivarathri day to see the kaavadiyattam for Lord Subrahmanyan in the morning. Kaavady from all parts of the area come separately and meet at the temple. Kettulsavam is the most spectacular sight of the festival and is held in the evening. Kettulsavam from the distinct areas of the village come to the temple at around 4 p.m. The rituals and programmes only end at midnight.

Little is known of Simeon's early life, but at some time he left his homeland and spent some years living as a hermit in Palestine. After this, he is known to have visited Rome, where his exoticism led to his harassment by a Roman mob. Papal intervention calmed this situation. By order of Benedict VII, he was examined and found to be orthodox. He was renowned for his piety and heroic charity, and for numerous miracles performed during life and after death. In the following period, Simeon traveled across Italy, France, and Spain before returning to northern Italy, joining a Benedictine monastery near Mantua, where he became known for his kindness and generosity. He died in Mantua in 1016. His cult was approved by Benedict VIII (1024) and Leo IX (1049). In 1913 his relics were solemnly exposed. His tomb was a reported site of numerous miracles, which contributed to his canonization in the mid 11th century. A local noble, Marchese Boniface III of Montferrat, later rebuilt a local church and dedicated it in Simeon's honor. References Sources *Southern, R.W.. The Making of the Middle Ages.

Coote has umpired the fourth highest number of AFL games for a boundary umpire Coote is from Pomberneit, near Camperdown in south-western Victoria. Coote began umpiring with the Colac and District Football Umpires Association when he was 14. Australian Football League (AFL) umpires manager Jeff Gieschen has said that Coote is one of the most powerful boundary umpires in the AFL. Coote practised throw-ins with half a brick at his house to build his strength. Coote completed a Bachelor of Applied Science (Exercise and Sport Science) at Deakin University in 2004. Coote was named the Victorian Runners and Trainers association Athlete of the Year for the 2009/10 season. This came after he won the 800-metre title at the Stawell Gift in 2010. For the 2011 Stawell Gift, Coote switched from middle distance to sprinting to contest the more prestigious 120-metre sprint. He made the semi finals, but came third and did not qualify for the final. In 2012 he again competed in the sprint, and despite umpiring an AFL game in Brisbane on the Thursday before, Coote won his heat and semi final before finishing third in the final. Coote again competed in the Stawell Gift in 2013, running second in his heat and earning a semi- final berth. He felt \\"flattened\\" from umpiring the Carlton vs Richmond game on the preceding Thursday. Coote was then scratched from the semi-final after tearing his hamstring in the warm up. Coote returned to professional sprinting for the 2013/2014 season, recording a very narrow loss in the SAAL Bay Sheffield final on 28 December 2013 won by Queensland beach sprinter Ben Mispelhorn. Coote then ventured to Tasmania for the Burnie Gift on New Year's Day. He excelled in the wet and windy conditions, winning by 3 metres, the biggest winning margin in recent times, in a time of 12.78 seconds from his 9.50m handicap.

The museum includes displays on the geology of the mountains, the religious significance of mountains in the lives of people, and the history of mountaineering and alpine tourism. MMM Juval at Juval Castle in the Burggrafenamt in Vinschgau is dedicated to the \\"magic of the mountains\\", with an emphasis on mystical mountains and their religious significance. MMM Dolomites at the Cibiana Pass at , housed in an old fort, is dedicated to the subject of rocks, particularly in the Dolomites, with exhibits focusing on the history of the formation of the Dolomites. This museum contains a summit observation platform that offers a 360¬∞ panorama of the surrounding Dolomites. MMM Ortles at Sulden on the Ortler is dedicated to the history of mountaineering on ice and the great glaciers of the world. MMM Ripa at in South Tyrol is dedicated to the mountain peoples from Asia, Africa, South America and Europe, with emphasis on their cultures, religions, and tourism activities. MMM Corones on the summit plateau of Kronplatz (2,275 m), is dedicated to traditional mountaineering.  Projects  = Firmian = Sigmundskron Castle The centrepiece of the Messner Mountain Museum is based in Sigmundskron Castle () near Bolzano, Italy, and addresses the subject of man's encounter with the mountains. The castle dates to the Late Middle Ages and houses the museum's headquarters, administration and event facilities. There is a rock theatre that seats 200 people. The museum was opened on 11 June 2006 after three years of restoration to the virtually ruined castle. The concept at MMM Firmian, as this hub of the museum is known, is based on three strands: the castle, the restoration and the exhibitions. The appearance of the castle has not been destroyed by modern alterations. The architect, Werner Tscholl, paid attention to the fact that the historical building had to retain its originality; for example, the new glass roof structures and pipes or cables of any kind are not visible from the outside. The MMM Firmian itself covers an area of 1,100 square metres. The theme of the museum is the history and art of mountaineering. Messner wants to show \\"what effect the mountain has on people\\". as well as giving an understanding of mountains and mountain peoples. He demonstrates this by means of pictures, sculptures, symbolic objects and memorabilia of various expeditions, which are portrayed as part of a tour through the castle. Messner also displays the history of alpinism and the impact of alpinism and tourism on nature and the environment. A separate exhibition on the history of the castle and the region is in a tower. = Juval = Juval Castle This part of the MMM is housed within Juval Castle () near Naturns, a late-medieval castle, and was opened in 1995. This castle is privately owned by Messner and he uses it as his summer residence. This MMM deals with the mountains as places of mystery and spirituality. Its main focus is the sacred mountains of the world such as Kailash, Mount Fuji or Ayers Rock. In addition, Tibetan exhibits such as precious Buddha sculptures and a giant prayer wheel are displayed. There is also an exhibition on Gesar Ling, an epic Tibetan king, a tantric room and an expedition room in the basement. Finally there is a collection of masks, displays on aspects of animism and mountain images in the keep. = Dolomites = Messner Mountain Museum in Monte Rite, Dolomites. MMM Dolomites is housed in a First World War fort at a height of 2,181 metres on () between Cortina d‚ÄôAmpezzo and Pieve di Cadore. This \\"museum in the clouds\\" was opened in 2002 and has the \\"vertical world\\" of the Dolomites as its theme. It covers the history of the opening up of the Dolomites as well as aspects of Alpine history and its protagonists. = Ortles = The fourth part of the MMM is laid out underground below the Ortler in Sulden. Since opening in 2004, subjects such as the eternal ice and the Ortler are covered in an exhibition space of 300 square metres, with exhibitions on skiing, ice climbing, the Arctic and the Antarctic. Visitors are able to go inside the mountain and its glacier. Also in Sulden is the museum Alpine Curiosa () in a twelve square metre little old cottage called Flohh√§usl, with portrayals of 13 legendary mountaineering stories (from Yogi Milarepa to Messner himself), which offers a different interpretation of mountaineering and where alpine curiosities are displayed. = Ripa = Bruneck Castle The fifth part of the MMM is MMM Ripa at () above the town of Bruneck. This is planned to open in Spring 2011 and is intended as an interactive museum, which will offer a forum for various mountain peoples to exchange experiences with the local farming community. Guests from other mountain regions will spend a summer here and talk about their lives. Examples that Messner has given include the Sherpas, South American Indians, Tibetans, Mongols or Hunzas. = Corones = Messner Mountain Museum on the Kronplatz The sixth and last museum of the MMM network, the MMM corones, was built on the top of the Kronplatz mountain (Plan de Corones in Ladin and Italian) at an altitude of 2,275 meters above sea level. Opened in July 2015, the museum, a modern structure designed by renowned British architect Zaha Hadid, has a floor area of 1,000 square meters and features a permanent exhibition dedicated to traditional climbing and mountaineering.  Cost and financing  The cost of the project is estimated at up to ‚Ç¨30 million, split between Messner and the province of South Tyrol. The latter funded the restoration and expansion of the old buildings; in return, Messner has to maintain the exhibitions without subsidy for 30 years. The restoration of the old fort on the Monte Rite was undertaken by the region of Venetia together with the municipality of Pieve di Cadore.Ein Treffpunkt in den Wolken (dolomiti.it) For renovating and developing the MMM Bergv√∂lker costs of between three and four million euros have been suggested, 80% of which will be borne by the province of South Tyrol in order to provide financial support to the municipality of Bruneck.Pressemitteilung der S√ºdtiroler Landesregierung dated 28 January 2008  References  External links *Official website Bolzano History of mountaineering Museums in South Tyrol Sports museums Natural history museums in Italy Mountaineering in Italy ","title":"Messner Mountain Museum"},{"id":"29038244","text":"\\"Masakali\\" is a Hindi song from the 2009 Bollywood film Delhi-6.

According to think tank CPPR, the liquor market in India is the third largest and fastest growing one in the world . A significant part of this liquor demand is met by domestic production.

It was held on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to demand better jobs, immigration and education reform and as an \\"antidote\\" to the Tea Party movement. Rally With crowds assembling as early as 6:00 AM EST, the rally began with an interfaith service at 11:00 AM, followed by the beginning of musical performances by various recording artists and groups at noon. The event progressed with a series of speeches by various figures before concluding at 4:30 PM. One of the masters of ceremonies for the event was television personality Ed Schultz. The coordinator for the event was Leah D. Daughtry. The rally attracted criticism from the right because the Communist Party USA and International Socialist Organization were among the 400 sponsors who endorsed the rally. =Speakers= * Harry Belafonte * Mary Kay Henry * Jesse Jackson * Benjamin Jealous * Van Jones * Bob King * Joe Madison * Marc Morial * Al Sharpton * Richard Trumka =Performers= * Black Ice * George Clinton * Charlie Hill (comedian) =Attendance= There is no official police or Parks Department estimate of Washington DC mass events. Most media outlets, including The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, and The New York Times estimated the crowd was in the tens of thousands. Organizers said the crowd was between 175,000 and 200,000. Organizers claimed the rally had more attendees than the Restoring Honor rally, but various media outlets rejected this claim. The Associated Press said \\"Saturday‚Äòs crowds were less dense and didn‚Äôt reach as far to the edges as they did during Beck‚Äôs rally.\\" The New York Times said \\"significant areas of the National Mall that had been filled during Mr. Beck‚Äôs rally were empty.\\" ABC News, Politico, and NPR agreed. Foreshadowing the photos edited by the Trump administration in support of his inflated statements of crowd size at his 2017 inauguration, conservative Michelle Malkin posted a report on her blog showing that the \\"One Nation\\" websiteas of two days after the rallywas showing a photograph of the crowd that was actually taken at Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The image included text thanking the participants who attended and asking for them to share their stories from October 2010. While One Nation updated its website by the next day, posting an image from October 2, 2010, President Trump and his representatives continued to boast of his fake crowd for nearly two years, until a September 2018 release of documents from a Freedom of Information Act request showed the 2017 photos had been doctored, at the explicit direction of the President. Reactions \\"This is true democracy and good old-fashioned organizing at work,\\" said Leah Daughtry, national campaign director of One Nation Working Together, adding that the turnout exceeded her expectations, marking \\"an important moment in the progressive movement.\\" Ben Jealous of the NAACP said that \\"we're not an alternative to the Tea Party. We want to be an antidote... We want to make the mainstream of the country visible to itself.\\" Communist Party USA sponsored and participated in the rally, and Sam Webb, CPUSA national chair, said, \\"There's never been anything quite like this march. The great thing is that it happened, who was there, who spoke, the spirit and politics.\\" Before the event took place, it received derision from right-wing oppositional circles, with Glenn Beck criticizing the participation of Marxist and Communist groups. He also criticized it as \\"truly, truly Astroturf\\" and said labor unions paid travel expenses for many while Restoring Honor attendees paid for themselves. From the other side, many on the left offered advance criticism for it being organized as a \\"pep rally\\" for the Democrats, and limiting criticism of the War in Afghanistan and the Obama administration. The United Methodist Church's General Board on Church and Society withdrew its endorsement the day before the rally, saying what \\"began with a clean, clear message consistent with the social teachings of The United Methodist Church\\" devolved into nothing more than a gathering organized in opposition to the Restoring Honor rally. It also denounced the \\"un-Christ-like tone\\" of discourse in the country, including within the church itself. It was the only major endorser to withdraw.

Roerich wrote about these conditions: > \\"Institutions, collections and missions, registered under Roerich Pact, > exhibit a distinctive flag which gives them the right to special protection > and respect from belligerent countries and peoples of all countries > participating in the treaty.\\" It is seen from above words that in order to get the right for exhibition of the distinctive banner one must be registered by Pact bodies. The same standing exists concerning a distinctive banner of Red Cross (which also created on the basis of ancient symbol ‚Äì cross).  Important cultural events with the Banner of Peace  In 1990, Russian cosmonauts Aleksandr Balandin and Anatoly Solovyev performed a space flight on orbital station Mir with the banner of peace on board. This flight lasted from February to August, including nine days with the banner outside the craft, completing 144 orbits of the Earth. An international scientific \\"banner of peace\\" project was conducted in 1997, with the banner of peace again delivered into the orbiting Mir. The aim of this action was to call for protecting life and beauty on Earth. Many international crews worked in Mir with the banner aboard. Cosmonaut Paul Vinogradov, a participant of the project, said: > \\"We have raised the banner of peace over the Earth in order that a space of > culture excludes the space of war and animosity forever. We call all the > peoples and nations to building of new spiritual, scientific and artistic > cooperation.\\" After completing the project and returning from orbit, the banner of peace was passed to the International Centre of the Roerichs. It is now exhibited there. On January 5, 1999, the banner of peace was presented to President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan. Space pilot A.A. Leonov and professor S.P. Kapitsa participated in the ceremony, which was conducted in the Presidential Palace in Almaty.\\"Museum named after N.K. Roerich.\\" Museum guide.

The banners from these expeditions are now exhibited in the International Centre of the Roerichs. In October, 2004 during the celebration of Roerich's 100th anniversary, the banner of peace which had been to the space station was presented to the Indian Parliament. Taking the banner, Speaker S.

Biography Nysa was of Greek Macedonian and Persian descent. She was a daughter the Seleucid Prince Antiochus and Seleucid Queen Laodice IV.Laodice IV, at Livius.org Her parents were blood siblings and her parent‚Äôs marriage was the first sibling marriage to occur in the Seleucid dynasty.Grainger, A Seleukid prosopography and gazetteer p.48 The grandparents of Nysa were the Seleucid King Antiochus III the Great and Seleucid Queen Laodice III. Her father Antiochus, was appointed by Antiochus III to succeed him as his first heir.Antiochus III, at Livius.org Nysa was born between 196 BC and 193 BC. In 193 BC, her father had died. Her family grieved over his death, in particular, Antiochus III.Grainger, A Seleukid prosopography and gazetteer pp. 36-37 Laodice IV, later married her brothers Seleucus IV Philopator and Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who were both uncles and stepfathers of Nysa. Through her mother‚Äôs marriages, she had various half brothers and sisters. In the year 172 BC or 171 BC, thanks to the diplomatic efforts of her maternal half-brother Seleucid King Demetrius I Soter, Nysa married the King Pharnaces I of Pontus.Grainger, A Seleukid prosopography and gazetteer p. 52 The marriage between Pharnaces and Nysa represented a continuation and a strengthening of the pro-Seleucid orientation of Pontus' foreign policy. Through his marriage to Nysa, Pharnaces tried to increase his political influence and Pontian power and affairs in foreign political relations with the Roman Republic and across Anatolia. Nysa and Pharnaces were related as he was a first cousin to Nysa‚Äôs parents, thus Pharnaces was related to the Seleucid dynasty. Little is known on Nysa‚Äôs relationship with Pharnaces and how she reigned as Queen of Pontus. Honorific statues and inscriptions have survived that were dedicated to Nysa. Pharnaces set about establishing good relations with the citizens of Athens and the Greek island of Delos. Pharnaces made a donation to the people of Athens. While the exact nature of the donation is unknown, it is thought that Pharnaces' donation to Athens occurred soon after 183 BC.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus p.32 A lengthy inscription from the Athenians on Delos honours Pharnaces and Nysa. Pharnaces and Nysa received a crown of gold from them and bronze statues of themselves were set up on Delos. Their lengthy Athenian honorific inscription is dated during the archonship of the Athenian Tychandrus or Tychander which is now generally accepted to around 160 BC or 159 BC. Nysa bore Pharnaces two children: a son called Mithridates V of Pontus and a daughter called Nysa of Cappadocia, who was also known as Laodice. Nysa is believed to have died during childbirth.

David Colville & Sons, a Scottish iron and steel company, was founded in 1871 and it opened its Dalzell Steel and Iron Works at Motherwell in 1872. By the first World War, it was the largest steel works in Scotland and it continued to expanded afterwards taking over a number of other steel works in Cambuslang and Glengarnock. Nationalised in 1951, it became part of the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain. It was privatised in 1955 and the construction of Ravenscraig steelworks resulted in the closure of a number of its other works. It was renationalised in 1967, becoming part of British Steel Corporation. Formation and expansion David Colville & Sons was founded in 1871. The company's first plant was the Dalzell Steel and Iron Works in Motherwell, which was opened in 1872, and by World War I this plant was the largest individual steel works in the country. Colville's quickly grew into a substantial concern, and by 1900 they were the largest employers in Motherwell. During World War I the Government of the United Kingdom asked Colville's to intervene in some of the nearby struggling steel plants, and to that effect they took over the running of the Clydebridge Steel Company works in Cambuslang in 1915, and the Glengarnock works in 1916. Nationalisation, privatisation and renationalisation 1951 saw the company taken into public ownership, under the direction of the Labour government of Clement Attlee, as part of the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain. Public subsidy underwrote the start of Colville's Ravenscraig steelworks project in 1954, although Colville's was subsequently returned to private ownership by the Conservative government of Anthony Eden in 1955. In 1957 construction of the integrated Ravenscraig steelworks at Motherwell was completed at a cost of ¬£20 million, and as a result of this, a number of older Colville furnaces were demolished. In 1967, Colville's was renationalised, and became part of British Steel Corporation. 21st Century at the plants Tata Steel closed the Dalzell and Clydebridge works in 2015, but both reopened in 2016 following the sale of the sites to Liberty House Group.

For the first vertical, the couloir inclines at about 47¬∞, and the last is narrower and steeper with about a 60¬∞ average incline. To the east on the north face with less angle is the much larger Norton Couloir.  Name  The couloir was named after a member of the 1963 U.S.A. Everest Expedition, Thomas Hornbein, who was on the first ascent. First ascent The first ascent of the couloir was made on 22 May 1963, by Tom Hornbein and his partner, Willi Unsoeld, who were with the 1963 U.S.A. expedition attempting to reach the Everest summit from the Nepalese southern side by two routes. The majority of expedition members used the same route climbed ten years earlier by Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary. This entailed negotiating the Western Cwm and the flank of Lhotse to the South Col, then up the southeast ridge to the peak. Hornbein and Unsoeld, however, took a more challenging, different and unknown route up the west ridge from Camp 2 in the Western Cwm, traversing over the north face to ascend the steep and narrow couloir. After summiting, they descended the southeast ridge, bivouacking high up. Subsequent ascents Since the initial ascent, there have only been another nine summiters with five expeditions through the Hornbein Couloir, the last one in 1991. 10 May 1980: Japanese Tsuneoh Shigehiro and Takashi Ozaki made the first full ascent of the north face up the Japanese and Hornbein Couloirs from the Rongbuk Glacier in Tibet. 20 May 1986: Canadians Sharon Wood and Dwayne Congdon climbed a new west shoulder route from the Rongbuk Glacier and continued to the summit via the Hornbein Couloir. She became the first North American woman to summit Everest. 30 August 1986: Swiss Erhard Loretan and Jean Troillet, unprecedented and unrepeated, climbed the north face in a single alpine style push without oxygen, ropes, or tents in 37 hours, and glissaded down in under 5 hours. They climbed mostly at night and carried no backpacks above 8000m, a style that became known as \\"night naked\\". This is the first ascent outside of the month of May. 24 May 1989: Pole Andrzej Marciniak climbed the west ridge and the Hornbein Couloir. 20 May 1991: Swede Lars Cronlund climbed the Japanese and Hornbein Couloirs.

He is of Irish descent. Orchard started his career playing for Ballarat local Catholic junior club YCWCYC and St. Patricks College in Ballarat, then East Ballarat and was playing for the town's Under-18s when Collingwood selected him in the 1994 AFL Draft. He made six appearances in each of his first two seasons and was then given up by Collingwood in order to secure Sydney's Anthony Rocca. Orchard, Ben Wilson and two draft picks ended up at Sydney. Despite his new club coming off a successful 1996 campaign where they were grand finalists, Orchard managed to find a place for himself in their midfielder and played in the first 19 rounds in the 1997 AFL season as well as a qualifying final against the Western Bulldogs. He participated in finals again at the end of the 1998 season, where he added another 21 games. After two years with Sydney, Orchard requested to be traded back to Collingwood. He was part of a trade in the 1998 AFL Draft which saw Sydney also lose Paul Licuria and a draft pick in exchange for the third pick of the draft, Nic Fosdike. He averaged 15 disposals a game in 1999 and missed several games mid season with a torn hamstring. The following year he put together 18 appearances but was de-listed by Collingwood. As a schoolboy Orchard was a champion runner. He held a number of Australian primary schools athletic records in the 100m, 200m and still holds a long jump record.

Leonardo da Vinci is frequently credited with creating the first design for a human-powered ornithopter in 1485. Since that time, many people have tried to make human-powered flight like a bird happen. In 1991, the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI) awarded a ‚ÄúDipl√¥me d‚ÄôHonneur‚Äù for the first remotely operated engine-powered ornithopter, which was developed by Professor James DeLaurier and UTIAS. In 2006, the UTIAS Ornithopter No.1 flew. It required the assistance of a jet engine to take off, and its flapping wings were driven by an 18 kW (24 HP) gasoline engine. =Ornithopter Project= The Human-Powered Ornithopter Project (HPO) started in the summer of 2006, as a spin-off of the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS) flapping-wing research program.http://english.ntdtv.com/ntdtv_en/ns_na/2010-10-14/990839619086.html The design was run in simulations to check feasibility before committing to construction. The aircraft has a wingspan of https://ottawacitizen.com/dreams+flies/3581043/story.html (comparable to a Boeing 737), and weighs . It cost $200,000 CDN (approx. US$200,000), not including donated material and time.

The name came about when, during testing on a snowy field, the cockpit became filled with snow. The team expects that revised iterations of the aircraft with greater performance will be made. Flight test history The Snowbird completed successful free- flights prior to its officially monitored record run. It took to the air on 31 July 2010. =Record run= For its official aviation-first flight, it was piloted by Todd Reichert, a 28-year-old PhD graduate student of the University of Toronto's Institute for Aerospace Studies. The record flight was observed by a certified official from the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI), and GPS data detailing the altitude and length of flight were given to the organization for certification. Snowbird flew for 19.3 seconds in a straight- and-level powered flight run under human power alone. It averaged ,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS161728911820100928 over a length of . Take-off was assisted with a tow from a car to get the aircraft up to speed, before flapping for lift-off. A total of 16 flaps were used on the run to maintain height. At the start of the flight, data indicates that the Snowbird was able to gain height, while maintaining speed, indicating that there was more power than necessary to maintain straight-and-level flight.http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/blogs/aviation_week/on_space_and_technology/index.jsp?plckController=Blog&plckBlogPage;=BlogViewPost&newspaperUserId;=a68cb417-3364-4fbf-a9dd-4feda680ec9c&plckPostId;=Blog:a68cb417-3364-4fbf-a9dd-4feda680ec9cPost:a2ef8e7d-8aec-40aa- bdd1-fc57be8e693f&plckScript;=blogScript&plckElementId;=blogDest The run occurred at the Great Lakes Gliding Club, in Tottenham, Ontario,[_id]=48001 on 2 August 2010, at around 6:45am. Reichert estimates that each stroke needed , with on each stroke. Analysis of the flight afterward indicated that 15-20 power strokes is the limit of endurance for the pilot. The validity of the record claim has been disputed due to prior claims and, apparent in Reichert's flight data, a downward trend in total energy and airspeed during the 19.3 second interval claimed as a sustained flight.Chronister, Nathan. \\"Human- Powered Ornithopter Flight\\".

It is headquartered in Mumbai, India and is part of the RPG Group, engaged in EPC works for Power Transmission, Distribution, Railways, Cables, Solar, Civil and Smart Infrastructure. It has operations in the regions of India, SAARC, EAP, Africa, Middle East and the Americas.  History  Ramjibhai Kamani founded Kamani Engineering Corporation (KEC) in 1945 which became the first electric power transmission company in Asia and a pioneer in the field of electric power transmissionPiramal, Gita; Herdeck, Margaret, India's industrialists, Vol. 1, Rev. ed. 1986, Three Continents Press, Washington, D.C. and railway electrification. In 1950, the company received an order from the Indian government to supply transmission towers for the prestigious Bhakra Nangal Dam project and a steel tower fabrication plant was established in Bombay in partnership with R. Foures, France. This was augmented by a second unit in Jaipur, Rajasthan and by 1967, KEC was supplying three-fifths of India's demand for transmission towers.Ramji H. Kamani on Wikipedia By the 1970s KEC had carried out turnkey power transmission projects in Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Egypt, Nigeria, Algeria, Mauritius, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, The Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, the United States and Canada. With eighty per cent of its turnover of almost being earned through exports, KEC soon became the largest manufacturer of transmission towers in India and the second largest in the world, next in rank to SAE of Italy.

The company struggled but was bound to completing its project commitments. This resulted in the company incurring heavy losses. Financial institutions such as IDBI (Industrial Development Bank of India) had invested some in KEC and began to worry when KEC's financial reports showed a record loss of . They began to press for \\"professional management\\". Around this time, Texmaco, a K.K. Birla company began to show interest in KEC, but their bid to control the company was frustrated and they backed away. Financial institutions stepped in and appointed their nominees to take over control from the Kamani family. The company soon began to limp back to profitability as KEC's sales climbed from in 1972 to in 1982. R.P. Goenka, chairman of the RPG Group had been vying for KEC shares for a long time. Even after financial institutions stepped in, some members of the Kamani family continued to hold a small number of shares in the company. Goenka carefully maneuvered to purchase these shares making sure that he did not get trapped in the same pitfalls that had defeated the Birla's attempts to take over KEC. Shareholding negotiations and approvals from financial institutions were sought before the company was put up for court auction by the government.  The company today  Today KEC International is a turnover flagship company of the RPG Group.

Most members of the stable were alumni of Jim Crockett Promotions, once a prominent member of the NWA before selling most assets to Turner Broadcasting, which became the basis of World Championship Wrestling (WCW).  History  On December 30, 1997 (shown January 5, 1998), Jim Cornette brought NWA promoters/officials Howard Brody and Dennis Coralluzzo to WWF Raw is War and made a match between Jeff Jarrett and Barry Windham for the vacant NWA North American Heavyweight Championship. Jarrett would defeat Windham to win the title after Cornette interfered. On January 12, 1998, The Rock 'n' Roll Express debuted and joined Cornette and Jarrett. The Rock 'n' Roll Express were awarded the NWA World Tag Team Championship and would successfully defend the titles from The Disciples of Apocalypse by losing by disqualification on the January 12 Raw. At the 1998 Royal Rumble, Jarrett entered the Royal Rumble at #18 but was eliminated a minute later by Owen Hart. The following night on the January 19 Raw, Jarrett would successfully defend the North American Championship against Blackjack Bradshaw. After the match, Blackjack Windham turned on Bradshaw and joined the NWA. By February 1998, Jarrett and Windham began to feud with Bradshaw while The Rock 'n' Roll Express began to feud with The Headbangers. At No Way Out 1998, Bradshaw defeated Jarrett by disqualification. Two days later on February 17, The Rock 'n' Roll Express lost the NWA World Tag Team Championship to The Headbangers. In March, the NWA lineup changed as Jarrett left the group on March 2 and reverted to his \\"Double J\\" persona and vacated the North American Championship. Cornette then awarded the vacated title to Windham, but the NWA stripped Windham of the belt just one day later. On March 17, 1998, after The Rock 'n' Roll Express failed to win the NWA Tag Team Championship from The Headbangers, they were kicked out of the stable after Cornette's new team The New Midnight Express (Bombastic Bob and Bodacious Bart) attacked them. At WrestleMania XIV, the New Midnight Express appeared at the 15 team battle royal and finished as the runners up. Barry Windham also appeared during the match and eliminated Bradshaw's partner Chainz, thus costing Bradshaw the match. The following night on the March 30 Raw Is WAR, The New Midnight Express defeated the Headbangers to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship. After the match, NWA World Heavyweight Champion Dan Severn debuted and joined the NWA by attacking the Headbangers. After winning the titles, The New Midnight Express would feud with The Rock 'n' Roll Express over the titles throughout April with the Midnights coming out on top in every encounter, most notably at Unforgiven: In Your House. By May, the group began to shrink as Barry Windham left the WWF for WCW and Severn went on his own in the WWF. The NWA's last hurrah occurred at the 1998 King of the Ring where they challenged The New Age Outlaws for the WWF Tag Team Championship but lost. On August 14, 1998, the New Midnight Express lost the NWA World Tag Team Championship to The Border Patrol at an NWA event. After the title loss, Cornette broke the NWA stable up on orders from WWF owner Vince McMahon, who told Cornette that he was banning anymore NWA matches from taking place on his shows.

The card replaces several previous documents, including the Bilhete de Identidade (BI; Identity Card), Social Security card, National Health Service card, Taxpayer card and voter registration card, in one secure card. The Citizen Card was first issued in the Azores in mid-2006. However, BIs continued to be issued in some cases. The Citizen card is a valid travel document within all of Europe (except Belarus, Russia and Ukraine) as well as Egypt, French overseas territories, Georgia, Montserrat (max. 14 days), Turkey and on organized tours to Jordan (through Aqaba airport) and Tunisia. However, to enter to Egypt visa is required through the e-visa system or upon arrival (passport photo is required on the arrival). Objectives The main reason to introduce the new card was to reduce the number of separate documents required by citizens in dealings with the various institutions of the state. The CC is a smart card with a data storage chip capable of storing encrypted personal data. According to the Portuguese government, this device guarantees its privacy: for example, stored medical information cannot be accessed by officials with access to the financial database of the citizen, to prevent abuse of power in obtaining data and protecting citizens' privacy. Another problem with the Bilhete de Identidade was that it was widely counterfeited. In addition to introducing the newer, more secure, CC, from 2008 identity documents could no longer be issued by Portuguese consulates as previously; identity documents could only be issued in Lisbon (although applied for elsewhere). Other identity documents In many circumstances, a passport or driver's license can still be used as an identification document. However, the \\"identity card\\" or \\"citizen card\\" is required by the Portuguese authorities. Foreigners, including European Union nationals, must carry a passport or valid identity card of their country of origin, and show it whenever required by officials. In the future however, as part of the Simplex + 2018, a new \\"card of citizenship\\" (cart√£o de cidad√£o) for foreigners residing in Portugal will arrive, which will include tax identification, social security and the national health system.https://www.lisbob.net/en/blog/citizen-card-cartao-cidadao-expat- portugal Appearance Reverse of a Cart√£o de Cidad√£o issued to a Brazilian citizen under the Porto Seguro Agreement Reverse of a Cart√£o de Cidad√£o issued to a Stateless Person The card is of similar size and appearance to a credit card.

The present building dates mostly from 1738, when Lord of the manor Thomas Western rebuilt the original 13th-century structure (part of which remains inside), and 1905 when Charles Stanley Peach's renovation and enlargement gave the house its current appearance. The manor house passed through several owners, including the Stanfords‚Äîreputedly the richest family in Sussex‚Äî after several centuries of ownership by the Diocese of Chichester and a period in which it was Crown property. Since 1932, when the Stanford family bequeathed the building to Brighton Corporation, Preston Manor has been a museum and exhibition venue evoking upper-class life during the Edwardian era. A walled garden, designated as being of historic interest, has old flint walls, a ruined wellhouse and a pet graveyard, among other features. The manor house is reputed to be one of the most haunted buildings in Britain: it has been the subject of ghost tours and television programmes, and a wide range of ghostly sightings have been alleged over a long time period. English Heritage has listed the house at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance; some other structures in the garden are listed at the lower Grade II. History Preston village originated in the Saxon era‚Äîprobably during the 9th or 10th century‚Äîas evidenced by its name (derived from Preste-tun, meaning \\"priest's farmstead\\"). The old spelling was still in use in the 11th century; by the 16th century, the term \\"Bishops Preston\\" or \\"Preston Episcopi\\" was in common use to avoid confusion with other Prestons elsewhere. Roman occupation of the area was confirmed in 1877. In its original form, the ecclesiastical parish covered a area north of Hove and Brighton. By 1086, when the Domesday survey was carried out, Preston's importance had grown, and it had the status of a manor. A manor house‚Äîlikely to have been a simple timber-framed structure‚Äîwould have existed at this time, but no trace survives. The manor was held by the Episcopal See at Selsey, then by the Bishop of Chichester after the See transferred there in 1075. The Domesday survey calculated the manor's value to be ¬£25, and recorded 12 ploughs (a team of eight oxen), a church, the manor house and a mill of unspecified type. A parish population of about 50 is suggested by the existence of 12 ploughs. The present St Peter's Church, built in the mid-13th century, stands on the site of two earlier churches. Although the manor belonged to the Bishopric of Chichester, it would have been administered on their behalf by a steward or bailiff. By 1510 the bishops had given up on farming and began renting out their lands. The first tenant at Preston was Edward Elrington and his wife Beatrix Shirley. Edward died in 1515 (his tomb is in St Peter's Church) and his family, including his son Richard, stayed at Preston to farm sheep. The present manor house has its origins in a simple mid-13th century stone-built building with two rooms of unequal size. Remnants of this house, which has been dated to 1250, survive in the basement. It faced north and measured . The stone walls were thick. The main hall was on the right-hand (western) side; it measured and was raised slightly above the steeply sloping ground to provide space for a cellar underneath. The second room, on the left-hand (eastern) side, measured . Both rooms had a centrally oriented chimney-stack on the south (rear) side, rising from fireplaces in the rooms to the roof. Only the general layout of these rooms can now be made out; parts of two original arched doorways between the two medieval rooms, and a chamfered arched opening, are the only other 13th- century features. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the Crown took possession of the manor and the Elrington family became tenants of the Crown. The transfer was completed in 1561, at which time the property was valued at ¬£38.12s.4d. When he died with no sons in 1569, Richard Elrington left his property to his widow, who in turn left it to her son by her previous marriage to William Shirley, named Anthony. He married several years later and eventually had twelve children. Anthony's wife pre-deceased him by one year, and when he died in 1624 the manor passed to their son Thomas. In 1628 he bought the reversion of the lease of the manor from the Crown and became the first Lord of the Manor. It was either Anthony or his son Thomas who undertook the first significant structural changes to the manor house during the 1600s. Elaborate (but \\"clumsily executed\\") moulded entrance doors were added in the east and west walls; designed in the Classical style, with flanking pilasters, architraves and cornices with a frieze. These survive, although not in their original condition. An extension may have been built during the time the manor was in the Shirley family: the lower part of the staircase (most of which dates from 1738) terminates at a first-floor landing and may date from about 1685. East of the staircase, there is a late 17th-century marble chimney- breast. The walled garden was also established at this time. St Peter's Church and Preston Manor have stood together since the 13th century. The west wing was added in 1905. Edwardian appearance. Thomas also named his eldest son Thomas, and in 1654 this Thomas's son, named Anthony inherited the estate. Sir Anthony Shirley, 1st Baronet Shirley of Preston, was involved in public life as a Member of Parliament for Arundel (1654), Sussex (1656) and Steyning (1660). In April 1658 an enquiry was held at Preston Manor by Oliver Cromwell's Council of State concerning a Royalist plot in Sussex. After serving the Commonwealth, Anthony somehow gained the favour of King Charles II and became a baronet in 1666. He was succeeded by his son Sir Richard, 2nd Baronet Shirley of Preston, in 1683, and when Richard died the property passed to his son, also named Richard, 3rd Baronet Shirley of Preston. Richard Shirley died unmarried in 1705 and Preston Manor was inherited jointly by his three sisters named Anne, Mary and Judith. Anne married Robert Western in 1698 and Mary married Robert's nephew Thomas Western in 1712. Judith died unmarried in 1711 and her share was split between the two surviving sisters. Thomas Western then purchased Anne's portion for ¬£6,275 the following year. By the early 18th century, therefore, the Western family were in possession of the manor. Thomas Western had estates in Essex and came from a mercantile family. When he died in 1733 he was succeeded by his son, also called Thomas. Under this Thomas Western's oversight, Preston Manor was rebuilt around the core of the 13th-century building and was given a new interior. He may have designed the additions and alterations himself: a foundation stone in the basement is carved with the date 1738 and the name \\"Thos. Western\\". He gave the building a symmetrical five-bay Palladian/Georgian-style fa√ßade across its full width. This had five entrances (of which the centre one formed a porch leading to an entrance hall), but the unequal width of the two medieval rooms inside meant the interior layout would not match the symmetry of the exterior. The lopsided appearance (unusual for this era and the chosen architectural style) was perpetuated when Western added unequally sized western and eastern wings, in the style of pavilions, containing a dining room and library respectively. When Thomas died, the succession then passed jointly to two of his sons, Charles Western and Reverend Thomas Walsingham Western. Thomas exchanged his estates for lands in Essex, while in 1766 Charles married Frances, daughter of a colonial agent in the American colonies. Their married life was short as during a phaeton ride, the horse stumbled and her husband was killed. Their eldest son, also named Charles, was saved when Frances threw him from the phaeton into the safety of a bush. Soon after her husband's death, Frances took their children to Essex and never returned to Preston Manor. In 1794, Preston Manor which included about 1,000 acres of land was sold to a tenant William Stanford for ¬£17,600 ending the long association of Preston with the Western family. William Stanford came from an established farming family near Horsham in West Sussex. When he bought Preston Manor it included the house, farm and surrounding lands in Brighton and Hove. He was already a wealthy man. Around this time, the interior was redecorated in the Adam style, and a columned screen was added in the entrance hall. William married Elizabeth Avery, and they had two children, both of whom died in 1790. Their mother died the following year. In 1802, he took another wife, Mary Tourle of Lewes, and had seven children with her. He sold his farm produce in the growing town of Brighton and was awarded a contract by the Town Commissioners to clear night- soil (sewage) from the streets and cesspools. In 1808, he became High Sheriff of Sussex. When he died in 1841, he was considered to be one of the richest private individuals in the county. His eldest son, William Stanford the younger, inherited Preston and continued the life of a rich country farmer. In 1842, he married Eleanor Montague Morris, the daughter of a London solicitor. Their first child, a son, died aged only five months. A daughter, named Ellen, was born in 1848. William died in 1853 and Ellen became the heir to the Stanford Estate. The following year Eleanor married Captain George Varnham Macdonald, and the couple went on to have three daughters, Flora (born 1857) and later twins Diana and Christiana, known as Lily (born 1866). Ellen was educated at Miss Russell's private school in Montpelier Road, Brighton and after graduating spent two social seasons in London. In October 1867, she married Vere Fane Benett-Stanford (1840-1894) of Pythouse near Tisbury, Wiltshire in a ceremony at St Peter's Church, after which a wedding breakfast for forty guests was held at Preston Manor. After the marriage, under the terms of William Stanford's will, Vere took the Stanford surname. Vere and Ellen spent their married life at Pythouse or their London townhouse in South Kensington. Vere and Ellen had one child, a son named John Montague Benett- Stanford (born 1870). After an unspectacular academic career, he left Eton at sixteen for an apprenticeship on the railways and then joined the army. In later life, he gained a reputation for erratic and eccentric behaviour, and had a very difficult relationship with his mother. The Stanford family's influence grew in the nineteenth century as they acquired more land in strategically important places around Brighton and Hove: they were able to control the two towns' expansion by choosing when to sell land and stipulating how it would be developed. The rapid expansion of Brighton in the early nineteenth century made for high income from rents and William Stanford the elder made a steady income from the collection of fees for surrendering his feudal rights over building land on the Adelaide and Brunswick estates. When the railway lines crossed the Stanford estate he received ¬£30,000 compensation for the loss of his land and the spoiling of the westerly view from Preston Manor. William Stanford the younger's complicated will prevented the selling of freehold building land but a subsequent Act of Parliament, the 1871 Stanford Estate Act, allowed Ellen to grant building agreements with the option to purchase the freehold within seven years at a price equivalent to the ground rent for twenty-five years, clearing the way for the transformation of the Stanford estate from agricultural lands to building sites. To offset the sale of land in Brighton, the Stanford estate trustees acquired freeholds in Wiltshire, Sussex, Middlesex and Croydon and leaseholds in London. In 1891 Vere and Ellen persuaded the trustees of the Stanford Estate to purchase his family's estates at Pythouse and Norton Bavant in Wiltshire. The profit made from this transaction enabled Vere and Ellen to purchase a yacht and a property on the island of Madeira called Quinta Vigia, where they began spending the winter months for the sake of Vere's health. He died there in 1894. The widowed Ellen Benett-Stanford divided her time between London, Wiltshire, Brighton and Madeira. In 1896 in Madeira she met Charles Thomas, a bachelor who had been fortune seeking in the mines of South Africa and Rhodesia, and they married the following year. Charles took the Stanford name and arms, and the couple went to live at Pythouse. They travelled extensively and took summer holidays to Charles's house in Norway, a base for his fishing trips, and winter visits to a new holiday home in Madeira which they purchased in 1902 and renamed Quinta Stanford. Charles pursued his interests in history and archaeology and published several books. Meanwhile, Ellen's son John was in Africa hunting big game, serving with the Tirah field force and working as a freelance war correspondent. He was one of the earliest newsreel photographers and was wounded while filming during the Boer War. He had married Evelyn Hume in 1893, and they had two children: Vere (born 1894) and Patience (born 1899, d.1904). Ellen's mother, Eleanor, died in 1903 and by 1905 Ellen and Charles had decided to make Preston Manor their main residence. Charles Stanley Peach, a friend of the Stanfords, was commissioned in 1905 to make substantial alterations to the house and grounds. He built a verandah to the right of the entrance, built an extension containing a new dining room and rooms for visitors and servants to the west, built a porch on the rear (south) elevation, and added lavishly decorated corridors on the northeast and northwest sides. Alterations were made to the basement servants' rooms and new attic rooms were added. The entrance hall was also widened. About five years later, a verandah was added to the left of the entrance to match the original on the right. The 1905 alterations provided more space for entertaining in style, which became particularly important as Charles became involved in local politics. In 1910 he was elected Mayor of Brighton, a position he held until 1913, and Preston became the setting for a series of high-profile social and civic events. In 1914 Charles was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament, a position he held until 1922. During the First World War Ellen and Charles were involved in the organising of gifts for Indian soldiers being treated in military hospitals in Brighton, and Ellen was busy writing letters of condolence to all Sussex families who had lost someone serving in the conflict. Her much-loved grandson Vere was serving in field artillery units on the Western Front, where his promotion was rapid. Despite several hospitalisations he remained in the army after the war but was finally diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1920 and sent to a sanitorium in Switzerland. In January 1922 he returned to England where he died at Pythouse a few months later. As early as 1918 Ellen was thinking of selling Preston Manor to Brighton Corporation; years of feuding with her son had left a legacy of bitterness. Charles and Ellen were probably influenced by their friend Henry Roberts, Director of the Royal Pavilion, but they also feared that if John did inherit he would demolish the house or turn it into a girls' school. In 1925 Charles bought Preston Manor from his wife's trustees and made provision in his will that, subject to the respective life interests of himself and Ellen, Preston Manor and four acres of adjoining land should pass to Brighton Corporation by deed of gift on the condition that it be preserved in its historic condition and be used as a museum with exhibits relevant to Brighton and Sussex. The frontage to Preston Road and Preston Drove was purchased by the Corporation for the sum of ¬£5,000 (although the sale was not completed until after Charles and Ellen died). Also in 1925 Charles and Ellen were given the honorary freedom of Brighton and in 1929 Charles was made a baronet in recognition of his years of public service. Sir Charles and Lady Ellen Thomas- Stanford continued to live at Preston Manor until their deaths in 1932. Charles died in March having willed to the Corporation 'all my books, documents, ancient deeds and papers relating exclusively or primarily to the County of Sussex'. (The rest of his library went to the National Library of Wales). Ellen died in November, bequeathing to the corporation the furniture and contents of the house. The transfer to the Corporation (a forerunner of the present Brighton & Hove City Council) was completed in January 1933, after which the building was opened to the public as a museum of Edwardian life, showing how a wealthy rural family would have lived and entertained at that time. As stipulated by Ellen Thomas-Stanford, Henry Roberts became Curator of Preston Manor and he and his family took up residence in the west wing. In 1936 the Preston Road frontage was set back and the main road widened. At this time the lodge, stables and gardener's cottage were demolished and the grounds to the north and west were laid out with grass and shrubs. In 1939 the Macquoid Bequest was installed in what had been Sir Charles's library and is now known as the Macquoid Room. During the Second World War Preston Manor became an Air Raid Precaution report centre, control centre and a base for a mobile First Aid post. In November 1945 HRH Princess Elizabeth came to tea at Preston Manor at the invitation of the Mayor of Brighton. It was her first public occasion. On 20 July 1947 a funeral tea was held in the drawing room for Christiana (Lily) Macdonald, with the Manor closed to the public that afternoon in respect. In 1951 Henry Roberts died and his daughter Margery became honorary curator of Preston Manor, a position she held until 1970. The Victorian servants' quarters in the semi-basement were restored and opened to the public in 1988. The walled garden was restored in the 1990s with money from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The way Preston Manor is presented to the public today reflects the way of life of a rich gentry family and their servants in the period before and after the First World War. Architecture The rear elevation of Preston Manor stands in front of a garden which is bounded by a Grade II-listed wall (in foreground). Preston Manor is a two- storey building with a symmetrical Palladian/Georgian fa√ßade, now clad in stucco, and a roof laid with Welsh slates. The design is characteristic of the mid-18th century, when such symmetrical compositions were fashionable. More space is provided by the basement (in which the remains of the medieval manor house are visible) and the attic, which has dormer windows. The entrance is on the north side and has a five-window range on the main fa√ßade. Its east and west wings, added in the 1738 rebuilding, have windows at ground-floor level only (except for a single first-floor window on the east side), and Charles Stanley Peach's additions of 1905 have two- and three-window ranges. All windows retain their original sashes and louvre-style shutters. The hipped roof, with a centrally placed chimney, sits behind a parapet; the side wings have similar roofs. A parapet continues around the roof of the south fa√ßade, which has several chimneys at the sides. The north-side main entrance, in the centre of the ground floor and reached by steps with iron railings, is flanked by a Classical-style porch with Doric columns topped by paterae (round decorative elements) and a cornice. The sides of the porch have rectangular windows, and the door is panelled. Although remodelled during Peach's work in 1905, the porch dates from about 1800. Flanking the porch are a pair of extensively glazed early 20th-century cast-iron verandahs with copper roofs. The south (rear, garden-facing) front has a centrally oriented flint and stone porch flanked by paired entrances with segmental arched pediments and keystones, windows with architraves and a panel with a coat-of-arms carving. The five-window range on the main fa√ßade is similar to that on the north side, but the side wings have arched French windows and balconies. The visitor route covers four levels and includes the entrance hall, a former library (now the Macquoid Room), a morning room, ground-floor corridors on the northeast and northwest sides, the Cleves Room, a drawing room and dining room and a substantial staircase leading to a first-floor landing with former bedrooms on the northwest, north, northeast, southwest and southeast sides, as well as two servants bedrooms and an Edwardian bathroom. At attic level there is a former maids workroom now presented as a nursery, a lavatory and bathroom and housekeeping storage rooms, and restored Victorian servants quarters can be visited in the basement. Gardens and other structures This ruined wellhouse (west face pictured) dates from the 1730s. The 18th-century walled garden (whose flint walls survive from that era) is between the manor house and St Peter's Church. A hedge-flanked wooden bridge leads to it. The layout follows the sloping contours of the land, and consists of four linked gardens: the walled section, a formal lawn at a lower level, a sensory garden for blind people and an area with lily ponds. An unusual feature is a pet cemetery, believed to be the only one in Sussex. Four cats and 16 dogs are buried in the plot in the southwest corner of the garden. English Heritage has designated the manor's grounds in their entirety as a Garden of Historic Interest. The 18th-century flint walls, which are a Grade II-listed structure, are about long and surround the garden on three sides. The west wall is a 20th-century reconstruction. When the manor house was rebuilt by Thomas Western in 1738, a 16th-century arched doorway was removed from the building and inserted in the south-facing wall. A wellhouse east of the manor house, also a Grade II-listed building, dates from the 1730s. It is now in poor condition, and has lost its original iron pump (operated by a horse) and capstan. The rectangular structure is principally of flint with some red brickwork on the quoins and elsewhere. The east, west and north faces have respectively one, two and three brick-dressed arches (now blocked); the south side cannot be seen. A brick wall surrounds the structure. Haunted reputation Preston Manor has a long- established reputation as a site of paranormal activity, and it has been described as one of Britain's most haunted houses. Ghosts allegedly seen since the 19th century include a grey-clad woman, a blonde woman who revealed herself to be an excommunicated nun, a floating hand and a phantom riding a toy tractor. The blonde nun (often called \\"The White Lady\\") is the earliest and most famous purported ghost. First mentioned in the 16th century, the frequency of its reported appearances peaked at the end of the 19th century, and it was last recorded in 1903. One of Eleanor Stanford's children from her second marriage, already familiar with the descriptions of the ghost, claimed to have encountered it in 1896, walking from the drawing room to the staircase, and said that the apparition disappeared when she tried to touch it. Soon afterwards, another daughter apparently saw the same figure at the top of the stairs. Later in 1896, a friend of the Stanford family, who was staying at Preston Manor in the hope of seeing the White Lady, reported encountering it in the entrance hall. The man found out (supposedly through talking to the ghost) that it was the spirit of a nun who had been excommunicated and buried on unconsecrated land. More details‚Äîincluding that there were two ghosts, both of whom were nuns who had been excommunicated in about 1535 by a friar, even though one had done no wrong‚Äîwere suggested at a s√©ance held in late 1896. Early in 1897, the skeleton of a middle-aged woman, whose remains were dated to the 16th century by a doctor, was found behind the house during building work; it was secretly buried on consecrated ground in St Peter's churchyard, with help from the Stanford family. A s√©ance held in 1898 reputedly made contact with the now pacified spirits, and only two more sightings were recorded of a spirit with the characteristic long fair hair: both in 1903, once in a billiard room and once in a bedroom. White-clad female spirits were later reported by passers-by in 1976 and 1992 in the grounds of the manor. The same daughter who allegedly saw the ghost on the staircase also reported seeing two phantom men apparently fighting on another staircase on the southwest side earlier in the 19th century. Early in the 20th century, she also reported an \\"immensely evil\\" presence in the southwest bedroom, moving around the room and then leaning over the bed. In the same room, a visitor to the house once thought she saw a floating hand, not attached to any arm, attaching itself to her four-poster bed and moving up and down it. Another visitor later reported an identical experience, and also said that the bed seemed to be shaking during the encounter. The southwest side of the building was apparently a focus for paranormal activity: strange noises, objects being moved, dresses being cut with regular patterns of holes, and doors opening and shutting were all reported there. A grey-clad female ghost was reported several times throughout the 20th century. Reputed sightings included one in the boiler room of the house, early in the 20th century; two in quick succession by a World War II firewatcher, first on the main staircase then on the parapet of the roof; and one by a security guard. Another security guard reported a ghost in old-fashioned black clothing walking across a landing in the 1990s. In the 1960s, a ghost apparently riding a toy tractor was reported in the grounds. Preston Manor's extensive history of purported paranormal activity has led to the establishment of regular \\"ghost tours\\", and the Living television channel's programme Most Haunted filmed an episode there in June 2006. The building today Preston Manor was listed at Grade II* on 13 October 1952. Such buildings are defined as being \\"particularly important ... [and] of more than special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. The garden walls on the southeast side of the house, and the ruined wellhouse in the grounds, were listed at the lower Grade II (a designation given to \\"nationally important buildings of special interest\\") on 20 August 1971. As of February 2001, they were two of 1,124 Grade II-listed buildings in the city. Preston Manor is part of the Preston Village Conservation Area, one of 34 conservation areas in the city of Brighton and Hove. This area was first designated on 24 September 1970 and has since been expanded. The manor house and the adjacent St Peter's Church are considered to be the core buildings of the conservation area. The manor house is owned by Brighton & Hove City Council and administered as part of the Royal Pavilion, Museums and Libraries department, which also controls the Royal Pavilion, Brighton Museum & Art Gallery and its counterpart in Hove, the Booth Museum of Natural History, the Brighton History Centre and the city's libraries. It is run as a museum displaying and commemorating the Edwardian era and the Stanford family (its name was originally the Thomas-Stanford Museum when it opened in 1933), demonstrating the everyday life of its residents and servants.

It is only available in the Japanese language. Its name comes from the singing software Vocaloid, for which AH-Software also develops voicebanks. Both AH-Software's first Vocaloids and Voiceroids went on sale on December 4, 2009. It differs from regular text-to-speech programs in that it gives users more control over settings like tempo, pitch, and intonation. Overview Voiceroid uses an engine called AITalk developed by AI Inc. The user is able to adjust the tempo, pitch, and intonation to make the program sound more natural. The original two products, Tsukuyomi Shouta and Tsukuyomi Ai, were packaged with the animating software, Crazy Talk SE. On October 22, 2010, a new version of the engine was introduced, known as Voiceroid+. The first voicebank released for this new engine featured a character from the children's anime Eagle Talon, known as Yoshida-kun. Much like Shouta and Ai, he is aimed at young audiences. The first three Voiceroids were subject to censorship, and inappropriate words were filtered out. However, Tsurumaki Maki was designed specifically for a more mature audience and is the first of the series to have no form of censorship.Vocaloid news article Yuzuki Yukari is also the first Vocaloid Vocaloid to have a Voiceroid voicebank. For Tohoku Zunko's release the software was vastly improved compared to previous Voiceroid+ voices. The first two Voiceroids to come in one package are Kotonoha Akane and Aoi. In 2015, the software was upgraded to Voiceroid+ EX. In 2017, the newest version of the software, \\"Voiceroid 2\\", was announced. This version has a number of new features and differences, though users can still import the past Voiceroid and its variants into it. However, older engine versions will not be able to use any new features. A number of releases for the software have been produced after successful crowdfunding campaigns; since 2016, this has become the main source of funding for new voicebanks.

The play features three stories, Fire Station Flood Alert, Dilys' Attic Fire and Pontypandy Fireworks Party, and was filmed and released straight to video. The film was released on 1 April 1996 on BBC Video. The opening sequence of this film was filmed on location at Aldenham Country Park, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, England. It features children learning fire safety with Sam played by Gary Lucas. The show, created by Paragraph International (based at Pinewood Studios) toured worldwide with Writer and Director, Charles Savage for 7 years along with a Postman Pat Musical.  Plot  The video is made up of three separate stories. They are essentially live action adaptations of stories from the animated series, with a few significant changes. Penny Morris appears in all three stories, though she only appeared in one episode in the show. Also, each story includes a subplot which was not in the series - Elvis being sacked as Fire Station cook, the training film, and Norman's pet hedgehog were all created for the stage play. Bella Lasagne is not introduced until the second story, because Bentley the Robot is played by the same actress. = Fire Station Flood Alert = Station Officer Steele fires Elvis Cridlington as the station cook. This gives Fireman Sam an idea; He invents Pancake Prototype One and a robot called Bentley to be Elvis' replacement (\\"Gently, Bentley\\"). Whilst spring-cleaning, Elvis, exasperated with Bentley's constant whistling, decides to place his Elvis Presley cassette into the robot. This causes Bentley to malfunction and ends up breaking the stopcock, causing a flood inside the fire station. When it's all sorted, the crew start having what Bentley has cooked, bangers and mash. It turns out that Bentley isn't a good replacement, and everyone decides Elvis should be reappointed (\\"Elvis Cooks The Lunch\\"). = Dilys' Attic Fire = A few weeks later, the fire station crew set to work on a training film with Norman Price as Trevor's \\"gopher\\". Production of the training film begins. Norman gets bored of being a gopher, so Penny suggests he play a victim in their staged rescue, along with Sam's niece and nephew Sarah and James. Later, Dilys Price looks for treasure in her attic after reading a magazine article, but the candle she uses for light starts a fire in the house. When she's getting rescued, she argues about not letting go of a valuable vase that she found and could be in danger of breaking, and it ends up in Trevor's hands. Dilys lavishly praises the fire brigade, but they say it's all in a day's work (\\"By Jupiter, By Jupiter\\"). = Pontypandy Fireworks Party = On 5 November, the crew are preparing a bonfire for Bonfire Night, under the command of Station Officer Steele (\\"The Person In Charge Is Station Officer Steele\\"). Norman is dressed as a tree and pinches Bella and Dilys' bottoms. His plan is foiled by some railings, in which he ends up getting stuck. After the crew rescue him from the railings, Norman introduces his pet hedgehog, which he calls Brian. Brian scampers into the bonfire and Norman panics to get him out. The crew set up the guy and light the bonfire, but Norman, who is searching for Brian, is in danger of being killed. After he's rescued, it's revealed that Brian was a female hedgehog and had just had babies. Sam renames the hedgehog Bronwyn, but advises Norman to let the hedgehogs off into their natural habitat. Trevor and Elvis light the bonfire, and the celebrations are underway (\\"Remember, Remember The Fifth of November\\").

Together with the neighbouring Nahegau and Speyergau, it belonged to the central Rhenish Franconian possessions of the Imperial Salian dynasty.

She was known to have written one of the first biographies of Florence Nightingale as well as several volumes of meditative and lyrical poetry. Because her poems were primarily centered on the ethical and spiritual experience of life, several Christian denominations have been known to appreciate her work. As evidenced by her several publications, she greatly advocated for the alleviation of poverty and social injustice in hope of reform. Alt URL She contributed to several contemporary periodicals by writing short essays and biographies. Although she published several works, there is no significant biographical account of Matheson's life.  Life  Annie Matheson was born in Blackheath, Kent on 29 March 1853. She was the daughter of Rev. James Matheson, a Congregationalist minister in Nottingham and his wife Elizabeth n√©e Cripps, and older sister to Percy Ewing Matheson besides 9 other siblings.Class: RG 9; Piece: 2468; Folio: 59; Page: 11; GSU roll: 542975.

Privately educated in Nottingham, Matheson discovered a passion for writing as she began to contribute to literary journalism. Her religious family background seems to have greatly influenced her outlook and writing. Her work exhibited both selflessness and confidence. Though one of a large family, she neither married nor had children. The 1911 England Census records her as living at the age of fifty-eight at Beutham, Maybury Hill, Woking as a \\"spinster\\" and head of the household, whose occupation was literature and journalism.\\"Annie Matheson.\\" Class: RG14; Piece: 3028; Schedule Number: 46 Ancestry.com. 1911 England Census [database on-line].

Literary Work  At the age of thirty-seven, she published her first book, The Religion of Humanity and Other Poems (1890). In 1899, Matheson published Selected Poems Old and New as a compilation of popular shorter poems. Many preceding publications encompassed her strong faith and the beauty of God's nature. In her book, Leave of Prose...With Two Studies by May Sinclair (1912), her writing shifted to a more social-critical perspective as she evaluated hard work and knowledge. Children were her primary audience as she wrote The Story of a Brave Child: A Child's Life of Joan of Arc (1910) because she wanted them to understand the power of faith upon an individual. In her well-known book Florence Nightingale: A biography (1913), Matheson described Nightingale's greatest accomplishment, the invention of modern nursing, in 374 pages. She acknowledged Nightingale's generous motivations and tireless efforts during the Crimean War to care for the British wounded. By reading this biography, contemporary readers learned of Nightingale's campaign for sanitation and her establishment of public-healthcare in Britain. Following this publication, Matheson returned to publishing several volumes for children in a series called \\"Rose and Dragon,\\" which includes A Plain Friend (1920) However, the series was never finished due to her death on 16 March 1924 in London.  Critical Reception  Critics of Matheson at St. James Gazette pointed out that she was \\"not one of those women poets who strive to write as men; she has the characteristics of her sex, and is before all things gentle, sympathetic, humane.\\" Others, like The Westminster Review, criticized her work as \\"poetry of the head and not the heart...which binds it and restraints it so as to let no free abandonment of utterance\\". According to a critical essay by Alfred Miles, Matheson's The Religion of Humanity and Other Poems (1890), has \\"impressed those able to discriminate by its earnestness of purpose, nobility of thought, and distinction of style and form.\\"  Publications  *(1890) The Religion of Humanity and Other Poems *(1894) Love's Music and Other New Poems * (1898) Love Triumphant, and Other New Poems *(1899) Selected Poems Old and New * (1900) Snowflakes and Snowdrops.

It is served by a Regionalbahn service called Der L√ºner. History  The line was built by the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (German State Railway Company) to create a direct connection between the Westphalian cities of Dortmund and M√ºnster. The new line was built from the station of Preu√üen on the Dortmund‚ÄìEnschede line to Munster and opened on 18 October 1928. On 8 March 1990, the line had to be closed due to the collapse of an embankment. Repairs continued for more than a year, until the line was re-opened to passenger traffic was on 2 June 1991. Planned upgrade The line was originally built with a single-track with the embankment wide enough for a second track. With the increasing traffic volumes serving the mining and steel industry, the line was expected to be duplicated. However, this never occurred because of war and inflation. Furthermore, there was a plan to build a line from a branch on the Dortmund‚ÄìHamm line east of Dortmund-Scharnhorst station to Werne on the line to Munster. This would have sped up long-distance services between Dortmund and M√ºnster by avoiding the tight curves at the station exit from Dortmund and at L√ºnen and the tight curve on the approach to Werne. It would have also avoided the disruption to services caused by incoming and outgoing trains crossing each other's tracks on the eastern approach to Dortmund station. These plans were never implemented in practice. The duplication of the line and upgrading of the track for a top speed of 200 km/h was listed in the 2003 Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan and classified as a \\"priority project\\". On 12 December 2008 the upgrading of the line was approved. The implementation of the plans, however, is still expected to take a few years. The development cost was estimated in December 2008 to be ‚Ç¨180 million. After in-depth investigations, the cost had increased at the end of April 2010 to around ‚Ç¨ 377 million. On 20 August 2009, the German Ministry of Transport and Deutsche Bahn AG signed a contract for the project. The plan is to complete technical planning in late 2011 with environmental approval procedures beginning in 2012. The German government funded the cost of preliminary planning. Operations  The Regionalbahn service RB 50 (Der L√ºner) from Dortmund (running via the Dortmund‚ÄìEnschede line) runs once an hour in the window between long-distance trains, stopping at all stations. Since the distance between L√ºnen and M√ºnster is only single track until the planned upgrade is carried out no increase of this service is possible. InterCity trains from the Ruhr area to the north of Germany run over the one- track line between Dortmund and M√ºnster only on the basis of one train per hour in each direction. Every two hours, a pair of trains run on the Wanne- Eickel‚ÄìHamburg line.

The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians, \\"put on the new man, which after God is created\\" (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, Healing the paralytic at Capernaum (). The first movement is written on words from Romans 7:24, stressing the need of the sinner for redemption.

Bach first performed the cantata on 3 October 1723.  Scoring and structure  The cantata is structured in seven movements, and scored for alto and tenor soloists, a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of trumpet, two oboes, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. # Chorus: # Recitative (alto): # Chorale: # Aria (alto): # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (tenor): # Chorale:  Music  An instrumental chorale melody is present in the opening chorus. It may refer to the words \\"\\", but also creates a connection to the closing chorale, which was sung on the same tune, and therefore may also quote its first verse. This chorale is played by the trumpet in canon with the oboes. The strings present themes in the instrumental introduction which are later used as a countersubject to the lamentative theme of the voices. A recitative of the alto, accompanied by the strings, leads to a chorale, concluding the ideas of the first section in expressive harmonization. A different mood prevails in the following aria, the voice and the oboe being equal partners in the request to spare the soul. In the last aria the tenor is accompanied by the strings with oboe, music dominated by a lilting rhythm changing between time and time.

The lake, which is spread over , is located near the city of Hyderabad. The lake is also known as Secret Lake because it is hidden between the localities of Jubilee Hills and Madhapur.  History  Under the rule of the Qutub Shahi dynasty (ca. 1518‚Äì1687), this lake served as the drinking water source for the residents of Golkonda fort  Tourism  In 2001, the tourism department of the local government initiated steps to promote the lake as a tourist destination. As a part of this, five boats were to be deployed at the lake. In 2002, the lake started to become a destination for people who go for fishing as a pastime. Few citizens from the nearby city of Hyderabad travel to this lake on the weekends to relax and enjoy fishing. To capitalise on the visitors, the local agencies expanded their tourism plans by turning the lake into a fishing zone. As a part of the various beautification steps, the area surrounding the lake was illuminated, artificial waterfalls, a rock garden and a floating fountain were added. In addition to this, proper seating arrangements, a walkway and restaurants were established. Adventure activities like rock climbing, trekking, rappelling, an art gallery and a sculptor park for artists were also introduced as attractions. An amphitheater, with a capacity to hold 1,500 people at a time, was also added for public access. The entire exercise was completed at a cost of . 2018 - The lake bund has been upgraded with walkways as part of CSR activity by K Raheja group.  Controversies and pollution  Because of the unique rock formations abutting the lake, it was designated as a protected area. In 2001, the state high court issued an order to the local pollution board and the city's water supply and sewerage board not to allow development of new residential localities near the lake. Furthermore, the court order also asked these agencies to take immediate steps for prevention or collection and treatment of domestic sewage flowing into the lake from the residential colonies in the vicinity and catchment area of the lake. Despite these notifications, the local agencies have failed in controlling both pollution and illegitimate constructions on the lake bed. To tackle pollution in the lake, sewage treatment plants were set up by the local pollution control board in 2006. As years passed by, the plant became non-functional. Durgam Cheruvu in 2013 is now a place to relax. There is an amphitheatre, and the On the Rocks cafeteria. Boating is also available. Harichandana Dasari IAS of GHMC had transformed the lake front into an amazing park. A cable bridge with dancing fountain will adorn the lake.

Following the murder of a German couple, \\"El Brujo\\" became the most wanted criminal by Spain's security forces. Due to the severity of his crimes and the media coverage surrounding them, Mart√≠n is regarded as the Canary Islands' most famous killer. Biography =Birth and early years= D√°maso Rodr√≠guez Mart√≠n was born on December 11, 1944, in the place known as Las Monta√±as, in the village of El Bat√°n (municipality of San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain).\\"El Brujo\\", la bestia de El Moquinal His parents were Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez Silveria and Celestina Mart√≠n Perdomo, and he had four brothers. His family was very poor, but despite this, his parents tried to give him a good education. However, D√°maso started to perform criminal acts at a very young age. When he was just 17, he was accused of theft and arrested, and after his release a year later in September 1963, he joined the Spanish Legion and was sent to Western Sahara. In 1966, he graduated from the Spanish Legion. Subsequently, D√°maso went back to Tenerife, and in 1967 married Mercedes Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez and settled in a place known as El Peladero, in the village of Las Mercedes in San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna. In 1973, their first child would be born, and in 1975 - the second. =Murders and escape= He committed his first murder on November 11, 1981 when he killed a young man who was with his girlfriend in his Mazda, in the area of El Moquinal. D√°maso was a voyeur who liked to watch couples having sex. He then killed the young man and beat and sexually assaulted the girl in the car with the body. He then drove the body and the girl to \\"Llano de los Viejos\\", where he abandoned them.D√°maso, \\"El Brujo\\" de El Moquinal (in spanish) Investigators from the National Police asked around the area about a violent individual, a \\"night stalker\\", who knew the mountains and also strolled about at night looking for couples. All information pointed to D√°maso. \\"El Brujo\\" was sentenced to 55 years in prison for murder, rape, theft of a firearm and unlawful possession of weapons. D√°maso escaped from prison on January 17, 1991 and fled to the mountains of Anaga. On January 23rd, the body of German tourist Karl Flick was found on the forest road leading to El Sol√≠s. The next day, at 3:15 PM, in a remote area of the Roque de El Moquinal, the Civil Guard recovered the body of his wife, Marta K√ºpper, who had obvious signs of strangulation. Everybody seemed to indicate that they had pleaded for their lives, but Mart√≠n had no compassion. Speculations, sightings, the fugitive's escape at the last moment, robberies in caves and in the houses of hunters or farmers fed the legend of \\"El Brujo\\". These events overlapped the celebration of the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife of that year, mainly due to the fear that aroused among the people that the murderer would show up in a costume, and could easily escape. =Death= On February 19th, a family moved to a house in the area near El Sol√≠s, only to find their door was forced open. They alerted the police, who dispatched two Civil Guards from Tacoronte, fronted by a sergeant commander, whom detected Mart√≠n's presence in the home. When the noncommissioned officer tried to enter, he was met with shotgun fire. The agent returned fire, shooting several times, but \\"El Brujo\\" had no intentions of surrendering. Instead, he opted to end his life, placing his hunting shotgun under his chin and with the fingers of one of his feet, firing. However, due to the length of the weapon, he survived. Subsequently, there was another exchange between the officer and Mart√≠n, whom successfully killed himself in the second encounter. In popular culture * In 2003, the Televisi√≥n Canaria premiered a series entitled \\"Noche del Crimen\\" that reconstructs the most famous crimes that have taken place in the Canary Islands in recent years. The series was directed by the Canarian filmmaker Javier Caldas. One of the episodes of the series was dedicated to D√°maso Rodr√≠guez Mart√≠n, being the most successful reconstruction of the case. On this occasion, the reconstruction of the crimes was scripted and directed by Aaron J.

The band formed in Beirut, Lebanon, in 2008 as a music workshop at the American University of Beirut. The band has released four studio albums: Mashrou' Leila (2009), Raas√ºk (2013), Ibn El Leil (2015) and The Beirut School (2019); and an EP, El Hal Romancy (2011), while causing many controversies due to their satirical lyrics and themes. History =Background and name= The band was formed in February 2008 at the American University of Beirut, when violinist Haig Papazian, guitarist Andre Chedid, and pianist Omaya Malaeb posted an open invitation to musicians looking to jam to vent the stress caused by college and the unstable political situation. Out of the dozen of people who answered the call, seven would remain to form Mashrou' Leila. Band members were encouraged by friends to perform in front of a live crowd; they put on a show as the opening act for a concert on the AUB campus. During the event, Mashrou' Leila proved to be the only band that composed and performed their original compositions. The band continued to play small venues and gain ground on the underground music circuit until they emerged onto the indie music scene during the Lebanese 2008 \\"F√™te de la Musique\\" event (the yearly Music festival held by the Beirut municipality) sparking controversy for their unabashed and critical lyrics on Lebanese society, failed love, sexuality and politics. Mashrou' Leila's members enjoy the wordplay and ambiguity surrounding their band's name. In English, the name can be interpreted as either \\"One Night Project\\" or \\"Leila‚Äôs Project\\"; Leila being a very common given name in Lebanon. When asked during an early interview about the origin of the name Mashrou' Leila, band members teasingly retorted that the band is a project started to collect money for a girl they knew called Leila. According to the band‚Äôs official Facebook page, Mashrou‚Äô Leila means \\"An Overnight Project\\", named for the nocturnal nature of the project characterized by all- night jam sessions. =Mashrou' Leila= In 2009, Mashrou‚Äô Leila participated at Radio Liban's Modern Music Contest held at Basement (club) winning both the jury and popular awards in part due to their breakthrough single \\"Raksit Leila\\" (Leila's dance). The first prize was a record deal. Mashrou' Leila‚Äôs self-titled debut album produced by B-root Productions (established by Raed El Khazen and Jana Saleh) was released in December 2009 at a steel factory in Bourj Hammoud (a suburb of Beirut) where an unprecedented number of attendees crowded the factory yard. The gig turned out to be Beirut's biggest non- mainstream event in recent years and has been a big hit among Indie and Rock fans in Lebanon. Shortly after the release of their first album, the band burst into the spotlight of the Lebanese music mainstream when they were announced to be headlining the Byblos International Festival on July 9, 2010. The concert was one of the most anticipated events of the summer and was attended by scores of fans as well as the Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri. =El Hal Romancy= In 2011, Mashrou' Leila released the El Hal Romancy EP, a recording the band describes as \\"tackling lyrically more intimate, personal, and theatrical subject matter that is less about the city and its politics proper, and more about the social residue of the city. This is a collection of songs that happen in a weathered bedroom with ruffled bed sheets, stained carpeting, and a book shelf of references, while a string section plays on a rusty vinyl player to a couple of young lovers trying to survive the city\\". One week before the release concert in Beirut Hippodrome, Mashrou' Leila announced that the album was available for free download on the band's website. In 2012, the band headlined Baalbeck International Festival. The concert was filmed and released as a live concert. =Raasuk= Mashrou' Leila's anticipated 3rd release Raasuk was recorded at Hotel2Tango in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was described as \\"an arresting, heady mixture of retro-Beirut music ‚Äì the signature sound being Haig Papazian's razor-sharp violin\\". The album was released in August 2013. The video of the lead single \\"Lil Watan\\" (\\"for the nation\\") was awarded the gold prize at the Dubai Lynx 2015 festival. To promote the album, the band managed to crowd fund over $60,000; an unprecedented feat for a Middle East art project. On April 6, Mashrou' Leila became the first Middle Eastern artist to be featured on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. On November 25, 2013, Mashrou' Leila played the Red Bull Soundclash with Who Killed Bruce Lee in the Forum de Beyrouth. During a show at The Middle East club in Boston, Sinno introduced \\"Abdo\\" off the Raasuk release by explaining that, \\"This one is about something typical in Beirut which is people selling stuff on trolleys in the street. It‚Äôs about a flower salesman called Abdo.\\" =Ibn El Leil= The first hint of new material arrived when the band started a campaign asking the members of their social media pages to submit lyrics and video ideas to be incorporated in the band's upcoming single. \\"3 Minutes\\" was released on March 17, 2015. Contrary to their common method of writing and producing songs, the band decided not to test their new material in live concerts, opting instead for secrecy and mystery about their fourth album. The band recorded the 13 tracks in studio La Frette in France over the summer with French-Lebanese producer Samy Osta, and worked on orchestral and brass arrangements with the Macedonian Radio Orchestra in F.A.M.E's Studios in Macedonia. The band has said that this album is their most pop album to date, and deals with topics that range from the euphoric to the destructive and depressive, all taking place in the politically, socially, and sexually charged spaces of Beirut's night. The band experimented with drum machines, loops, samples, and several synthesizers in a new method of composition, trying to accommodate for the departure of keyboard player Omaya Malaeb. \\"Maghawir\\" narrates a possible version of a club shooting in Beirut, drawing on references to real Lebanese case histories from two different shootings that took place within the same week, both of which resulted in the deaths of extremely young victims, each of who was out celebrating their birthday.\\" During a show in Boston, the band explained that the song \\"Tayf (Ghost)\\" is about a shuttered gay club, and \\"Bint Elkhandaq\\" tells the story of a friend who learned, \\"as hard as it is to be a woman in Beirut, it‚Äôs just as hard to be brown in the West.\\" The album is heavily loaded with allusions and references, both to contemporary figures of pop, and to mythological figures of gods and demons. On the November 28, the band released Ibn El Leil at the Barbican in London with live broadcasting on MTV Lebanon available to the entire world to positive reviews. \\"In the seven years since Mashrou‚Äô Leila formed at the American University of Beirut, the quintet ‚Äì whose name, in fact, means 'overnight project' ‚Äì have won comparisons to everyone from Arctic Monkeys and Radiohead to Roxy Music and Wild Beasts.\\" https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/29/mashrou-leila-review-barbican- london On December 1, Ibn El Leil debuted at the number one spot on local iTunes channels, and charted as number 11 on the international world Billboard charts. \\"It‚Äôs such an impressive performance that stadiums seem not only possible but imminent.\\" The band released a music video for their single \\"Roman\\" on July 19, 2017. The single was included on the deluxe version of Ibn El Leil released July 21, 2017. =The Beirut School= On February 8, 2019, Mashrou' Leila released a new single, \\"Cavalry\\", the first from their upcoming album The Beirut School. The Beirut School was released on March 1, 2019. The group toured North America in 2019 in support of the album.

The band is critical of the problems associated with life in Beirut and they are known for their liberal use of swear-words in some of their songs. Their debut album's nine songs discuss subject matters such as lost love, war, politics, security and political assassination, materialism, immigration and homosexuality. \\"Latlit\\" one of the Mashrou' Leila album tracks is a caricature of the Lebanese society overridden by gossip. \\"Shim el Yasmine\\" (literally Smell the Jasmine), a song reminiscent of Jay Brannan's \\"Housewife\\", was described as an ode to tolerance for same- sex love where a young man wants to introduce his bride to his parents but the bride turns out to be a groom. \\"Fasateen\\" (literally meaning \\"dresses\\") is a ballad that discusses the issue of interfaith or inter-religious marriage, a growing phenomenon in Lebanon. The song's music video shows the band members deconstructing nuptial symbols and defying the pressure of romantic relationships. Some of the distinctive features of the band's music is the prominence of the violin in passages redolent of Armenian folk music and the use of a megaphone in some songs to alter lead vocalist Hamed Sinno's voice.  Magazine appearances  Hamed Sinno got his first solo magazine theater cover in 2012https://www.facebook.com/mykalimag/photos/a.195619710449436.52011.149318815079526/526630724014998/?type=1& when he fronted the December issue of the first LGBTQI magazine in the MENA region, My.Kali.My.Kali magazine Hamed was also featured on the cover of October 2013 issue of French gay magazine T√™tu. The interview in the same issue was titled \\"On peut poursuivre son r√™ve apr√®s son coming out\\", literally \\"You can pursue your dream after coming out\\".T√™tu October 2013 cover of Hamed Sinno Papazian fronted the December 2013 My.Kali issue. Carl Gerges landed his first solo cover on the November issue of L'Officiel Hommes-Levant, 2013. Controversy Roman theater in Amman, Jordan August 2015 In August 2010, during a concert at the Byblos Festival, the band's lead Hamed Sinno unfurled a rainbow flag that was handed to him by a member of the audience. This was the first public display of a gay pride flag by an artist in Lebanon. During that same festival appearance, the band performed songs denouncing police brutality and corrupt politicians while then prime minister Saad el-Din Hariri was in attendance. Mashrou' Leila's satirical lyrics and themes regarding politics, religion, sexuality and homosexuality have led to an unofficial ban on performing in Jordan on April 26, 2016. The band announced on its Facebook page that their planned concert was denied approval by the Amman Governorate. The ban was reverted by the relevant authorities two days later.https://www.facebook.com/CITARRAme/posts/970460682990905 On June 13, 2016, the band again posted a message on their official Facebook page that claimed their upcoming concert in Amman had been cancelled by the Jordanian Ministry of the Interior: \\"The inconsistency of the Jordanian authorities in this respect (inviting us, then banning, then cancelling the ban, then inviting us again, then banning us again - all within the course of 14 months - has culminated in a clear message, that the Jordanian authorities do not intend to separate Jordan from the fanatical conservatism that has contributed in making the region increasingly toxic over the last decade.\\"https://www.facebook.com/mashrou3leila/posts/10154686996733806 In September 2017, while the band was playing in Egypt, members of their audience were arrested for unfurling rainbow flags in support of LGBT rights. Sarah Hegazi was among those arrested and later fled to Canada. One man was sentenced to six years in jail for 'practicing debauchery' on his way home from the concert; seven other concert attendees were arrested. = Byblos Festival concert cancellation = The band was set to play at the Byblos Festival on August 9, 2019; a few weeks before the concert, local church officials called for the show to be cancelled amidst an online homophobic campaign by right wing Christian activists who claimed that the band songs are blasphemous and promote homosexuality. Two song in particular \\"Djin\\" and \\"Idols\\" were cited as violating Christian sensitivities. During a 2016 NPR Tiny Desk Concert, the band lead singer Hamed Sinno explained the \\"Djin\\" lyrics as drawing from scholar Joseph Campbell's comparative mythology and religion works. The song references parallels in Christian and Greek Dionysian mythology but the crux of the songs is about \\"getting [...] messed up at a bar\\". Since July 17, 2019, protesters against the gig circulated conspiracy theories claiming the band is a \\"Masonic-Zionist\\" project to morally corrupt Lebanon, citing the band's support of gay and transgender rights. Right wing social media activists circulated an image shared by the band's lead singer on his personal Facebook account in 2015 depicting a byzantine icon of the Virgin Mary with the singer Madonna's head in place of Mary's; they accused the band of devil worship, rallied priests and politicians in their bid to stop the concert. Some campaigners including Free Patriotic Movement official Naji Hayek called to forcibly stop the band's appearance if Lebanese authorities don't cancel the show. Sinno posted a reply denouncing the mounting sectarian and fundamentalist rhetoric and explained that the Madonna image is a cover of a facebook article discussing pop art he shared and deleted in 2015; he added that he neither drew the image nor wrote its caption. Senior clergyman and head of the Catholic Media Center Abdo Abou Kasm, said the church is prepared to take legal action against the band, that he contacted members of parliament and other Christian officials, and informed them that this concert poses a \\"danger to [our] community,\\" adding \\"We won‚Äôt let this go through.\\" On July 22 the Maronite Catholic Eparchy of Byblos issued its first call to cancel the concert. Members of the band and prospective festival audience members received a flurry of violence and death threats on social media. In an attempt to defuse the situation, a Byblos Festival spokesperson claimed that a compromise was reached and that the concert will be held if the band members hold a press conference and apologize to all those who may have been offended\\" and that the two offending songs will be pulled from the festival set. Lawyer Christiane Nakhoul, filed a lawsuit on behalf of a right-wing activist against Mashrou' Leila for \\"insulting sanctities and religions and stirring sectarian sentiments.\\" On July 24, 2019, Mount Lebanon Prosecutor Ghada Aoun ordered the release of the band members after their interrogation by the State Security agency dismissing charges of blasphemy and inciting sectarian strife offenses. The prosecutor added that those members who were outside Lebanon (Sinno) can return because there is no memo against them. Lebanese singer Marcel Khalife who was himself the target of a libel campaign earlier voiced his support and called his followers to rally behind the band. On July 29, 2019, the Maronite Catholic Eparchy of Byblos communicated on its Facebook page, a statement by the Episcopal Commission for Social Communication claiming that two of the band members had acknowledged, during a meeting with church officials, that some of the band's songs violated religious values. The statement added that the band members who were questioned agreed to remove content that was deemed disrespectful to religious sensitivities and to issue an apology. On that same day, supporters of the band rallied in downtown Beirut rejecting attempts by Christian clergymen and right-wing groups to stop the concert. On July 30, 2019 the Byblos Festival organizers cave in to pressure from online groups, church officials and politicians and announced the cancellation of the show to prevent civil unrest and bloodshed. On July 31, 2019, following the concert cancellation, Mashrou' Leila shared a statement on its social media accounts condemning the unfounded libel campaign, saying that the songs at the center of the controversy were subjected to \\"misinterpretation and twisting of lyrics\\". The band added: \\"We have been tried on the streets, judged and convicted by anyone wishing. This is a departure from the logic of the state, one that strikes at the core of our sense of our safety and ability to be artistic and creative.\\" Social activist Khaled Merheb filed a lawsuit against members of the right wing campaign group who threatened the band and attendees with the use of weapons, beatings and killing. On August 1, 2019, the Byblos Festival filed another lawsuit against individuals involved in threatening the band and the public with violence. In the aftermath of the concert cancellation, a number of human rights organizations voiced concern. Middle east director of Human Rights Watch stated: ‚ÄúThe cancellation of Mashrou‚Äô Leila‚Äôs concert reflects the government‚Äôs increased reliance on over-broad and abusive laws to stifle and censor activists, journalists, and artists.‚Äù Amnesty international denounced the church position and hate speech against vulnerable populations: ‚ÄúIt is unconscionable that there continue to be such calls emanating from institutions that are meant to serve as role models to their constituencies, and can and should be upholding the right to freedom of expression and protection of vulnerable groups, instead of enabling hate speech, including homophobia\\". On August 4, 2019, Dutch metal band Within Temptation who was set to perform at Byblos on August 7 pulled out of the festival in solidarity with Mashrou Leila and \\"in support of tolerance, freedom of speech and expression\\". The cancellation of the Mashrou Leila concert triggered protests and a solidarity campaign on social media. Supporters described the cancellation as a shameful and dangerous precedent. On the date of the concert, independent activists gathered to put on a show in solidarity with the band and against censorship under the banner ‚ÄúThe Sound of Music Is Louder.‚Äù The event gathered dozens of sympathetic musicians, bands and comedians at 'The Palace' venue in Beirut's Hamra district. Over a thousand people attended the show while hundreds waited in droves at the venue's entrance in waiting. At 9pm, pubs and restaurants across the city played Mashrou' Leila songs in solidarity with the band. On August 24, 2019, Internationally renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma played Tayf at the end of his Byblos festival concert as a tribute to the band.

The Manchester Incorporated Law Library Society website describes him as \\"famous\\" although it is hard to determine whence his fame derives as the Library appears to be his only documented building. Hartas also appears not to have an entry in the RIBA Directory of British Architects 1834-1914 which is an exhaustive survey of practising architects of the period. In 2015 the building was put up for sale. The Law Library relocated to new premises on Deansgate where it remains a private library open only to subscribing members of the legal profession.

On Saturday 14 January 1928, the church hall at 409 Adelaide Street was opened. Costing ¬£19,000, it had two floors. The ground floor had shops, offices and social rooms, while the upper floor was a large hall. On 27 May 1928 the new pipe organ was used in services for the first time. The intention was to use the hall for services while funds were raised over the following two to three years to enable the construction of the church itself on the Queen Street side of the property.Fine Building: New Congregational Church Hall, Brisbane Courier, Monday 16 January 1928, page 20 However, during the Great Depression, the funds to build the church were not raised and services continued to be conducted in the church hall. World War II and Wickham Terrace Wickham Street church (about 1889) World War II began, and in September 1941 evening services at the City Congregational Church were shifted to the late afternoon to accommodate the black-out. In January 1942, the church hall was commandeered by the Australian Government Department of Munitions and Supplies. The Albert Street Methodist Church offered their church as a venue for services for the Congregational community. In October 1942, the congregation found a new home in a former Presbyterian church on Wickham Terrace. This church had been acquired in 1905 for extensions to Brisbane's Central Railway Station (the Presbyterian congregation established St Andrew's Presbyterian Church to replace their Wickham Terrace church). As the extensions to the railway station did not take place immediately, the railways used the building as for storage of records until 1929, after which they leased it out as a gymnasium until 1941. The Congregational community leased the Wickham Terrace church building from 1942 to 1960, after which the church was demolished for road works. Ministers The initial minister was Rev. Percival Watson, who had transferred with the congregation from the former Wharf Street church. He served (at Wharf Street, Adelaide Street and Wickham Terrace) for 22 years until he left in May 1947 to take up the ministry of the Pitt Street Congregational Church in Sydney. T. Rees Thomas was minister from 1947 to 1981. He was inducted in February 1948 by his old principal Rev. E. S. Kiek and distinguished wife Rev. Winifred Kiek.

Svetlana Medvedeva is among the most active promoters of the new holiday. Its symbol is a white daisy.  History  The Day of Saints Peter and Fevronia since the days of Kievan Rus and until 1917, was broadly celebrated in Russia because it is believed that the saints Peter and Fevronia are the patrons of marriage and family, as well as the symbols of love and fidelity. On this day it was common to go to church, where the people asked for love and family grace. The Tale of Peter and Fevronia of Murom (which literary treatment relates to the period of the mid-16th century), Duke Peter was the second son of Duke Yuri Vladimirovich of Murom. He ascended the throne in 1203. A few years before Peter‚Äôs principality he became seriously ill that no one could cure him. One day the duke had a dream that he could be healed by a peasant girl, named Fevronia. Fevronia (Greek Œ¶ŒµŒ≤œÅœâŒΩŒØŒ±) was beautiful, pious and good, plus she was a wise woman, she knew the properties of herbs and could cure ailments. Fevronia promised the prince that she could indeed cure him, but she said that he must also marry her. Since she was a commoner, the prince believed that he could not do such a thing because of his noble status, but he desperately wanted to be cured, so he vowed to marry her after the healing. The girl cured the duke, but he went back on his promise and did not marry her. The disease came back, this time even worse, and, humbled by this situation he returned to Fevronia, and Fevronia cured him once again. This time the duke married the girl. This marriage was marked by Peter and Fevronia's profoundly deep love for one another, which they nourished by God's grace for their whole lives. After the death of his brother Peter inherited the throne. The nobles (or boyars) respected his duke, but the haughty nobles‚Äô wives disliked Fevronia, not wanting to be ruled by the peasant. The nobles demanded that the duke leave her. Peter, after he heard of the intentions of separating him from the beloved wife, chose to voluntarily relinquish the power and wealth and go with her in exile. So Peter and Fevronia left Murom. Soon the unrest began in Murom, nobles were quarreling, fighting for the throne. Then they came around, gathered a council and invited the duke and his wife back. The duke and duchess returned and Fevronia managed to earn the love of the urban counterparts. They ruled after that long and happily. In his declining years, Peter and Fevronia took the vows in various monasteries and asked God to die in one day. They bequeathed to bury them in a specially prepared coffin with a thin partition in the middle. Peter and Fevronia died, each in his or her own cell, on the same day and hour ‚Äì on 8 July 1228. But people wickedly refused to honor their request to be buried in one coffin and they broke the will of the dead: their bodies were placed in the different realms. But the very next day they were found together. Twice their bodies were carried out to the different churches, but twice they miraculously were found side by side. And the spouses were buried together in the city of Murom at the cathedral church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin. Since that time the history of the spouses of Peter and Fevronia is the embodiment of the unquenchable love and loyalty and every year on 8 July the Orthodox Church celebrates the memory of Saints Peter and Fevronia. The symbol of Peter and Fevronia Day is a bouquet of daisies Controversy The two saints feast day is like the Orthodox antipode of the Roman Catholic feast of couples in love ‚Äì St. Valentine. Part of St. Valentine‚Äôs relics was deposited in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow several years ago, during the life of late Patriarch Alexiy II. According to a recent opinion poll, St. Valentine's Day has become popular among Russians, yet this holiday has more opponents than supporters. Some Russians said's ‚Äúour culture does not benefit from foreign holidays‚Äù or \\"it is a commercial holiday: not for people but for merchants\\". According to sociological data, the demand for flowers, souvenirs and perfume in Russia grows by almost 15% ahead of All Lovers‚Äô Day. At the same time, statistics shows that the number of those who mark All Lovers‚Äô Day becomes smaller every year. This may be explained by the fact that the Russian Orthodox Church introduced its own lovers‚Äô day in 2008.

History  King Harald Fairhair is the monarch who is credited by later tradition as having first unified Norway into one kingdom. According to the sagas, he ruled Norway from approximately 872 to 930. Modern historians, including Claus Krag, assume that his rule may have been limited to the coastal areas of western and southern Norway. The tendency in recent research has been to perceive unification of the nation to have been a more time-consuming process.Rikssamling (Det Norske Kongehus) The sagas recount that Harald succeeded, on the death of his father Halfdan the Black Gudr√∂darson, to the sovereignty of several small, and somewhat scattered kingdoms in Vestfold, which had come into his father's hands through conquest and inheritance. In 866, Harald made the first of a series of conquests over the many petty kingdoms which would compose Norway, including V√§rmland in Sweden, and modern day south-eastern Norway, which had sworn allegiance to the Swedish king Erik Eymundsson. In 872, after a great victory at the Battle of Hafrsfjord near Stavanger, Harald found himself king over the whole country.Samlinga av Noreg (vikingtida.wikispaces.com) His realm was, however, threatened by dangers from outside, as large numbers of his opponents had taken refuge, not only in Iceland, then recently discovered; but also in the Orkney Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides Islands and Faroe Islands. His opponents' leaving was not entirely voluntary. Many Norwegian chieftains who were wealthy and respected posed a threat to Harald; therefore, they were subjected to much harassment, prompting them to vacate the land. In time, Harald was forced to make an expedition to subdue these islands.Rikssamlingen i Norge fra ca. 900 til ca. 1300 (Prezi Inc.) After Harald's death, the unity of the kingdom was not preserved. In following centuries, the kingdom was variously ruled, wholly or in part, by descendants of King Harald or by earls under the suzerainty of Denmark. Kings of Norway until King Olav IV, who died in 1387, commonly claimed descent from Harald Fairhair.Rikssamlingen (Cappelendamm.no)History of The Royal House of Norway (Det Norske Kongehus)  Saga descriptions  In the Saga of Harald H√•rfagre from Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson, the consolidation of the rule of Norway by Harald Fairhair was somewhat of a love story. The tale begins with a marriage proposal that resulted in rejection and scorn from Gyda, the daughter of Eirik, king of Hordaland. She said she refused to marry Harald \\"before he was king over all of Norway\\". Harald was therefore induced to take a vow not to cut nor comb his hair until he was sole king of Norway, and that ten years later, he was justified in trimming it; whereupon he exchanged the epithet \\"Shockhead\\" or \\"Tanglehair\\" for the one by which he is usually known. Most scholars today regard this story as a literary tale inspired by the Romance stories that were popular at the courts by the time Heimskringla was written.Bruken av en heroisk fjern fortid: Kulturarvskonflikter omkring Harald H√•rfagres minnetradisjon (Haugalandmuseene)Norway ‚Äì Rulership and power before Christianization (S.

Challenges to Corporate and Class Dominance (2009), Who Rules America? Power and Politics (2013), Who Rules America? The Triumph of the Corporate Rich (2013), and Studying the Power Elite: Fifty Years of Who Rules America (2017). WRA is frequently assigned as a sociology textbook and documents the dangerous concentration of power and wealth in the American upper class. More recent editions have brought the discussion up to date and include the rise of Barack Obama, his campaign finance supporters, and the nature of his administration. Summary Domhoff argues in the book that a power elite wields power in America through its support of think-tanks, foundations, commissions, and academic departments. Additionally, he argues that the elite control institutions through overt authority, not through covert influence. In his introduction, Domhoff writes that the book was inspired by the work of four men: sociologists E. Digby Baltzell, C. Wright Mills, economist Paul Sweezy, and political scientist Robert A. Dahl.

On 7 June 2011, Tan announced that he would be running for the presidency. Following this, he promised to donate a significant part of the S$4 million presidential salary to a specially formed charity and circulated several statements outlining his position on the role of the president, including a controversial statement on safeguarding the reserves. The statements drew a mild rebuke from senior members of the Singapore government, who attempted to publicly clarify that the elected President has only \\"custodial powers\\" and not \\"executive powers\\". In response, Tan issued another statement, where he agreed with the limitations but nevertheless stressed that \\"the president does not need to be armed with strong executive powers to make an impact. A well qualified and properly elected President will make his impact through the power to persuade, to influence, to counsel, to convey feedback and if necessary, to articulate informed positions on specific issues\\".

In response to rumours circulating that Tan would be dropping out of the presidential race early, he refuted such claims and expressed that he would be filing his nomination papers as planned.

Tan advocated on the need for the burden of National Service to be shared by all segments of the society, including females and noncitizens. Tan's symbol is a \\"Hi-5\\". He explained \\"the raised hand signifies willingness to do public service, while the five fingers signify his values of honesty, fairness, positive attitude, courage and public service.\\" He got the lowest number of votes of all the candidates, with only 4.9% of the votes. For failing to achieve at least 12.5% of the votes, Tan also lost his S$48,000 deposit.

He is mainly known for his authoritative biographies of Scottish artists but he also wrote several articles on Robert Burns and his family.  Life  According to census records, Edward Pinnington was born in Blairgowrie, Perthshire in 1846, though no birth records are available to confirm this. His father was John Hardman Pinnington, an Excise Officer, and his mother, Ann Fishwick. The family seems to originate from Lancashire, England and they lived in various parts of Scotland, namely, the 1841 census: Rose Street, Dundee; and the 1851 census: Logie in Clackmannanshire. The family eventually settled in the Rowans, Cupar Road, Auchtermuchty. Pinnington married Margaret Forbes (1861‚Äì1936) on 21 October 1885 in Edinburgh. They subsequently had three sons John Noel (1886‚Äì1917), Edward Forbes (1888‚Äì1939) and Donald Stanley (1891‚Äì1976). Edward Pinnington died in Thornton, Fife on 22 June 1921, aged 75.  Career  According to his obituary,'The Late Mr. Edward Pinnington.' Unattributed obituary in The Montrose Standard. Pinnington began his working life as a journalist in the United States and was for a number of years the editor of Scotch American. However, there is as yet no corroborating record of this part of his life, though his style of writing suggests a training in journalism. In 1881, he was living in Edinburgh and by 1891 he had settled in Montrose, living with his spinster sister, Mary Ann, while his wife and family lived with her parents in Glasgow.Census information for 1881 and 1891, It seems that his interest in art history began when he researched and published the life and work of the Montrose artist, George Paul Chalmers. Only a hundred copies of this massive tome were printed in 1896, and it is likely that Pinnington was commissioned to write and edit it. Between 1896 and 1912, he produced a formidable stream of books and articles and was an art critic for several Scottish newspapers. It appears that around 1912, the family moved to Argentina. At any rate, his wife and two elder sons are recorded as incoming passengers from Buenos Aires arriving at Liverpool on 22 October 1914.UK Incoming Passenger Lists, 1878‚Äì1960, available at www.ancestry.com. Pinnington himself presumably returned separately. According to his obituary, the family settled in Auchtermuchty at the family home, around 1914. Pinnington seems to have published nothing thereafter, though extracts from his unpublished biography of Sam Bough were published in The Carlisle Journal in 1922, after his death (for details see below).  Unpublished letters  Twenty one letters and a postcard written by Pinnington to George B. Simpson (1820‚Äì1892) have survived. They are held in the Royal Scottish Academy's George B. Simpson Collection.Cf. These cover the period from 9 March 1891 to 29 September 1891.

The rafts were used to transport industrial quantities of unprocessed timber at one time over hundreds of miles of waterway. The technique of building barges this way was efficient and saved transportation costs. John A. Fastaben was the key raft- building specialist that Simon Benson hired as a construction supervisor to assemble his unique log barge rafts. This innovation resulted in lower cost of finished lumber and contributed to the boom of the construction industry in the first part of the twentieth century for builders in Southern California. The building of these ended in 1941 when mysterious fires broke out in a short period of time and sabotage was suspected. History Simon Benson, a lumber baron of Portland, Oregon, developed the first practical transportation industrial barge to reliably transport millions of board feet (1000 board feet is ) of timber at one time through the open ocean on the west coast of the United States. This was done by tying together hundreds of logs into one bundle and floating the assembled stockpile raft down waterways by means of tugs. A finished constructed log raft barge assembly went from the outlet of the Columbia River in northwestern United States into the Pacific Ocean and south to San Diego, California. Once there, the logs were cut into lumber by the Benson Lumber Company for marketing. The majority of the milled lumber went to San Diego builders. The entire timber enterprise venture of logging and lumbering was a commercially successful business for Benson because of being able to save the extravagant transportation costs charged by the railroads. The first Benson raft was launched in 1906 by the Benson Logging Company. John A. Fastabend was Benson's supervisor for the collection and assemblage of the needed logs for an industrial size commercial timber barge raft. He was a self taught raft-building specialist and began his sea-going assembled log raft barge building in 1894. His was the first such raft constructed on the Pacific coast and built for the Robinson Rafting Company in Stella, Washington. The town is up the Columbia River inland from the Pacific Coast of the United States. The raft he assembled consisted of fir logs to be used in wharf construction at the San Francisco harbor. The raft contained a half-million board feet of piling and was long. It was a failure since it broke up after leaving the mouth of the Columbia River traveling only south into the Pacific Ocean. It scattered over 400,000 lineal feet of high grade piling over miles of the Clatsop beaches on the Oregon coast. Fastabend tried again and built a second raft the next year in 1895 that was about the same size, but secured together better with more logging chains. It held together as it was being towed south in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of northern California. However, just before finally arriving at its destination port it also broke apart scattering all the logs. Fastabend constructed a third industrial log raft assembly two years later in 1897. This time he was successful in the project. His product of fir piling went down the California coast intact. It arrived in San Francisco undamaged and brought its owners an excellent price. The profit they made because of savings in transportation overhead costs almost paid for the loss of the two previous log raft failures. He made several more such rafts for the Robinson Rafting Company over the next several years. Benson saw Fastabend's success and hired him for the Benson Logging Company in 1904. He became their supervisor for the collection and assemblage of the needed logs for the industrial size commercial timber rafts. The construction site for these rafts was at a tributary body of water called Wallace slough near Astoria, Oregon. Fastabend had a crew of about a dozen men that worked under him at any one time. He was 69 years old in 1922 and considered an elderly, keen-eyed, gray-haired man. He was then constructing five rafts a year and had already built 57 log rafts for Benson. These were sent to San Diego pulled by a steamship towboat with 1,200 to 1,500 horse power. The 112th Benson log raft barge was launched in 1938 and the last of 120 total was launched in 1941. Four of the 120 Benson rafts were lost due to fire or storms. The last Benson log barge had a fire that broke out on it from an unknown origin and it burned for two days before it broke apart scattering loose logs into the Pacific Ocean, causing a navigational hazard off the coast of San Francisco. The previous two barges broke apart within a year under mysterious fires. Only three in the previous 34 years of over 100 constructed Benson barges ever had fires before, so sabotage was suspected. It was then decided to cancel any further building of the Benson barges.  Construction  Benson rafts were built to float like a gigantic tree trunk. They were constructed of felled trees and tied together with giant logging chains. The raft's cargo of logs began with a roughly cigar-shaped temporary \\"cradle\\" of wood resembling the frame of a large wooden sailing ship. A derrick placed logs in the cradle over a period of four to seven weeks, lacing them with tree-length timbers for added strength and stability. Large logging chains tied the raft together. When complete, one half of the cradle was removed and the raft was launched sideways into the water. Most were about to long, wide, and thick from top to bottom‚Äîusually drafting to deep and hauled between and of logs. A typical Benson log raft took anywhere from four to six weeks to assemble. The assembly involved 125 tons of chain. Fastabend had a special technique for tying the logs together with logging chains and steel cable. The pattern of these was known as a \\"herring-bone\\" arrangement. As the logs were placed into a shipyard type cigar-shaped wooden cylindrical cradle they were periodically tightened with donkey engines to keep the mass of logs tight as it was being assembled into one ultimate giant barge. The periodic tightening technique of the encircled bands of chain and cable made the assembly stiffer and stouter therefore becoming worthy of traveling through ocean currents. Many of the Benson sea-going log rafts were \\"deck loaded\\", with fence posts, telephone poles, and processed lumber such as shingles, stacked on top the log rafts for transportation cost savings.Journal of Forest History, Volumes 14-15, Forest History Society, 1970 It is estimated that building in Southern California doubled in just four years following the arrival of cheaper lumber via Benson rafts. Benson log rafts dramatically lowered shipping costs from that of railroad and traditional ocean barge transportation. They were the first ever seagoing ocean-worthy logging rafts to transport intact millions of board feet over a long distance on the Pacific Ocean. A proposal was brought up to use them to ship timber to China, but there is no evidence it ever occurred.\\"Mammoth Timber Raft\\", The Evening Telegram (St. John's NL), August 26, 1905  References   Sources    Barges of the United States History of Oregon History of Southern California Logging ","title":"Benson raft"},{"id":"29039919","title":"Kaisyuan metro station"},{"id":"29039927","text":"The Hajvalia mine is one of the largest lead and zinc mines in Kosovo.

It provides life, health and general insurance products. It currently has seven branches and seven lite branches across Singapore. History The idea of co-operatives, also known as social enterprises, was first conceived at the Modernisation Seminar in 1969, where delegates from NTUC affiliated unions gathered to discuss the challenges Singaporean workers were facing. Then, Singapore was a developing nation with a population comprising mostly blue-collar and low income workers. One of the founding leaders of NTUC, Mr Devan Nair, articulated the need for the Labour Movement to turn into a social institution to serve Singaporean workers in various ways. Then Finance Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee supported this call and urged NTUC to set up social enterprises in areas such as life insurance and essential consumer goods to meet the needs of the working population. This led to the establishment of NTUC co-operatives or Social Enterprises. Income was established in 1970 with the objective of providing insurance protection to the masses. At that time, life insurance was something only the higher income group could afford. Today, Income serves over two million customers. It is the top composite insurer in Singapore and one of the largest general insurers and health insurance providers. Income is also the largest motor insurer in Singapore, covering about one in four vehicles in Singapore. Initiatives =Income Family Micro-Insurance and Savings Scheme = The Income Family Micro-Insurance and Savings Scheme (IFMISS), a free insurance scheme for low- income households with young children, was launched in April 2010. The Scheme covers eligible families with children registered at NTUC‚Äôs My First Skool and families receiving financial assistance from the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (MOE FAS) for Primary Schools. In the unfortunate event of death or total and permanent disability (TPD) of a parent or guardian, IFMISS offers a pay-out of $5,000 to help the family cope financially during this difficult period, upon approval of the claim. Income also offers an additional pay-out (capped at $5,000) that matches the collective bank balances of the parent/guardian and his/her family unit. =SpecialCare= In August 2013, Income became the first insurer in Singapore to provide insurance coverage specially designed for children with autism. The plan, called SpecialCare (Autism), provides coverage for medical expenses from accidents and infectious diseases. This includes outpatient and hospitalisation expenses, daily hospital income, personal liability, death and disability due to accidents. They include reimbursement for mobility aids, psychiatric treatment and physiotherapy, home modifications and caregiver training following an accident. Income expanded its insurance coverage for the special-needs community in December 2014, when it unveiled SpecialCare (Down Syndrome). =OrangeAid= Income‚Äôs community development and involvement arm, OrangeAid, focuses on empowering youth-in-need through education. Established in 2010, OrangeAid champions marginalised children and youth in Singapore. Under this initiative, Income commits 1% of its annual insurance operating profits to fund OrangeAid programmes. OrangeAid‚Äôs flagship Future Development Programme (FDP) seeks to support tertiary students from the lowest income households through partnership with all the five Polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education. Beyond providing financial assistance for their school fees and living expenses, OrangeAid also believes in developing other important holistic aspects of their lives. Since 2015, the OrangeAid has disbursed a 1000 bursary awards, amounting to $2.55 million, through the Future Development Programme.

He is often described as the first bishop of Larino, but also as a bishop somewhere in the Peloponnese (or possibly Myra) who after being driven from his see took refuge in Rome. There is also some uncertainty in Pardus's chronology: he is usually connected with the 7th century, and the conventional year of his death is 650, but there is a strong tradition linking him to Pope Gregory II (715-731). After Pardus had sought refuge in Rome, the pope (whether Gregory II or another) offered him many possible bishoprics. Pardus however chose to retire to the region around Lucera in Foggia, where he intended to spend the rest of his life in prayer. This was not a random choice, as Lucera had formed part of the ancient Magna Grecia and many communities of Greek descent were established there. On his way to Lucera however Pardus spent three years in Larino, the ancient Larinum, where he preached the Gospel.

Born in England, he came to Dunedin as a young man and practised as a lawyer, and was then a judge. He entered provincial politics and was elected as the fourth Superintendent of the Otago Province. He then became Mayor of Dunedin and was called to the Legislative Council. Early life Harris was born in 1826 in Deddington, Oxfordshire, England. His parents were John Harris and Ann (n√©e Hyde). He trained in law and came out to New Zealand in September 1850, arriving in Dunedin on the Poictiers. Private life in New Zealand Harris married Annie Cunningham Cargill in Dunedin on 3 September 1851. She was the daughter of William Cargill, who was to become the first Superintendent of Otago in 1853. Harris and Cargill had different political views, but Harris often agreed with William Cutten, who was married to another of Cargill's daughters. Annie Cunningham died on 18 January 1881, aged 51. They had three daughters and six sons. Harris remarried on 3 November 1881, to Kate Philomena Dunphy, daughter of William Wallis Dunphy. Professional life After his arrival in Dunedin, Harris practised as a lawyer for several years and was in partnership first with John Gillies and, in addition, since July 1857 with his son Thomas Gillies. In 1858, he was appointed judge at the District Court and he held that position until 1862 when the office was abolished. Harris speculated with land. He had extensive holdings in Waihola, Otokia (south-west of Mosgiel), Lee Stream (inland from Outram), and West Taieri. He lost ¬£28,000 over a four-year period and this was a major reason for his resignation in 1865 from the Superintendency. After his political career had finished, he continued working in the legal profession. He never recovered from his financial losses and was even imprisoned for one year for his debts. Political career John Harris in 1867 Harris was elected onto the Provincial Council in 1853, representing Port Chalmers until 1859. He was a member of the executive in 1858‚Äì59. In 1862, he was elected Deputy-Superintend for Otago Province. He was Superintendent of Otago Province from 16 April 1863 until his resignation on 23 June 1865. He claimed significant differences in opinion with his executive, as well as a need to devote more time to his private financial affairs, as reasons for his resignation. During his Superintendency, he championed the first New Zealand Exhibition and was its chairman when it was held in Dunedin in 1865. In 1867, he contested the Dunedin mayoralty. There were four candidates running for the second time that the mayor was elected. Harris, James Turner, Thomas Birch and John Millar received 340, 273, 200 and 101 votes, respectively. He served for one term and was succeeded in 1868 by Thomas Birch. He was twice called to the Legislative Council. His first term was from 1858 to 1864. During his second term from 1867 to 1868, he was a member of the second Stafford Ministry (from 9 September 1867), holding the role of Solicitor-General from 26 October 1867 until 13 May 1868. Harris was a man of influence and standing in the community. According to Bernard Foster, if it had not been for his financial difficulties, Harris \\"would probably have played an even more important part in provincial and colonial politics\\".

Life Beatrice's parents resided in Palermo, where Beatrice was likely born. In 1335, she was betrothed to John Henry IV of Gorizia, a cousin twice removed of her mothers. Her mother renounced her rights to Tyrol and Carinthia on Beatrice's behalf.Wilhelm Baum, I conti di Gorizia (LEG, 2000), p. 139 However, the betrothal was cancelled by John Henry's mother who decided to settle with the new Habsburg rulers of Carinthia instead.Wilhelm Baum, I conti di Gorizia (LEG, 2000), p. 139 In 1345, Beatrice married Rupert, Count Palatine of the Rhine from the House of Wittelsbach.

Plot  Prior to the film, an apocalyptic event had eradicated all humanity (and possibly all organic life) from the world. The only animate things left in the world are machines, who continue their programmed tasks as they slowly deteriorate. Among these machines is Malice, a Doll (prostitute robot) who resides in a derelict red light district with her fellow Dolls and continues looking for clients, despite knowing there are no more humans left. Her other friends include Joe Administrator/Joe Admin (a robot that governs the area), Freddy (a cleaning robot), and Meliza Piper (a robot that works in the plumbing) After having a ‚Äúdream‚Äù of a bouncing ball, which is dismissed as a memory replaying from Malice's memory banks, Malice goes looking for clients. Upon discovering she's damaged, Joe Admin sends Malice to the repairer that resides in an upper area, warning her that Devo Leukocyte, a former bodyguard unit of the area, had forgotten his original programming and became hostile to anything it crosses. After narrowly escaping Leukocyte (with the help of Meliza), Malice happens upon an area she hadn't seen before and is guided by a little spectral girl holding a ball to a room containing a large, stone-like structure/machine. Upon speaking to the machine, a tentacle-like monster bursts out of it and brutally assaults Malice, causing her to black out as the spectral girl watches. Malice awakens in her room, shocked to find that she had become human. Though enjoying her newfound humanity at first, she's rejected by Joe Admin, who upsets her enough to run away. However, Malice is attacked by the Leukocyte, who defeats Joe Admin when he tries to come to Malice's rescue. Malice hides with the help of Maliza, but accidentally gives away their position and causes the Leukocyte to bisect Maliza. Heartbroken, Malice kisses Maliza, causing the latter to revive and mutate into a monster that defeats Leukocyte (but at the cost of her own life). An encounter with the repairer unit she originally sought out upsets Malice even further, causing her to return to the red light district to seek comfort with her fellow Dolls. However, she is shunned by them and flees back to her room, where she hallucinates about her life as a prostitute. Horrified by the visions, she's comforted by Heather, a fellow Doll who normally teases Malice. After a conversation, Malice kisses Heather, resulting in Heather mutating and becoming alive like Meliza. Malice and Heather spread the infection to all the machines in the area, their intent to bring happiness to the despairing, broken machines. The only one to truly resist the temptation is Joe Admin, who shows Malice the result of her actions; namely, the pain and perverted madness within the hosts of the infection. Malice is led from her room by the little ghost girl again, only to find Heather dying in an alley, Heather professing her affection for Malice before passing on. With Joe Admin by her side, Malice resolves to return to the room with the tentacle monster. Upon reaching the area, Joe Admin discovers he can't see the room nor the ghost girl. He asks Malice to kiss him, as to allow him to see the world she sees. She seems to reluctantly oblige at first, but pushes Joe Admin away and sprints to the door, separating the two. In the room, Malice finds the tentacle creature lying on the ground, seemingly dead. She angrily begins tearing the structure that held the creature apart, ultimately discovering a glowing version of herself within. The glowing double talks to Malice about a dream she had about ‚ÄúDolls having a body like this,‚Äù to which Malice speaks of a dream she had about Dolls having their robotic bodies and unfeeling hearts. Malice begins to question whether or not she was truly a Doll or if that was a ‚Äúdream‚Äù as well. She begins to fuse with the structure as Joe Admin, having been transformed into an organic being, walks in and tries to save her. The structure reforms around Malice, trapping her within, and Joe Admin kisses it. Malice states she'll ‚Äúdream a different dream‚Äù and becomes a glowing angelic being, making the structure vanish before flying away. As she flies away, it's revealed that the machines (and status quo) has been restored. However, Malice is only referred to as ‚Äúa voice,‚Äù denoting that in this altered reality, she's vanished from her once-friends‚Äô memories as a Doll. Malice flies out of the machine world, singing as Heather gleefully chasing her.
