It was a continuation of the Prescott Paraclete, a weekly newspaper that was published from February 14, 1855, until its final issue on September 21, 1855. The first issue of the Prescott Transcript was published on September 28, 1855, as number 32 in the first volume of the newspaper. With seven volumes in total, the final issue of the Prescott Transcript was published on Sept. 14, 1861, and is issue number 29 in volume seven. As with the Prescott Paraclete, Charles E. Young and Oliver Gibbs Jr. served as the initial editors and proprietors of the Prescott Transcript. However, in later issues of the Transcript, the publishers were referred to as Young and Brother Publishers. In some of the first issues of the Transcript, the slogan of the paper was ‚ÄúEnterprise, Education and Morality, the Essential Elements of Civilization,‚Äù which was the same slogan that was used for the Paraclete. In terms of the layout design of the newspaper, the Transcript possesses the same style format as the Paraclete, with six columns occupying four sheets of paper in every issue. On the first page of almost every issue, advertisements occupied the two left-hand columns, while the remaining four columns were devoted to poetry, stories and fables. The second page of the newspaper, in most issues, was the page that contained the majority of the paper‚Äôs journalistic news, covering topics that might have been of particular interest or concern for residents of Pierce County, Wisconsin at the time. The third page of the paper consisted heavily of advertisements but also contained short sections of notable information such as the Steamboat Record, which listed the names of the people who arrived at Prescott‚Äôs Steamboat Landing, along with the date on which they arrived. The fourth page of the paper contained a column with short jokes and puns, a story column, and four remaining columns which were consumed entirely by advertisements. The office of the Transcript, according to the paper, was originally located at Prescott‚Äôs Dunbar Building on Front Street, which is the street closest to where the St. Croix River conjoins with the Mississippi River. According to the Transcript, this location was also very close in proximity to Prescott‚Äôs Steamboat Landing. However, the office of the Transcript was eventually relocated to the Strauss‚Äô Building on Broad Street, which is located just one block over from Front Street. An annual subscription to the Transcript cost $2.00, while the price for purchasing a single issue of the paper cost $.05. In the final known issue of the Transcript, a business notice appearing on the second page provides information to readers, subscribers and advertisers about immediate adjustments to the office and firm of Young & Brother. Though the notice in the final issue does not explain the reason for the immediate adjustments, page 181 of the Annotated Catalogue of Newspapers from the Wisconsin Historical Society says, ‚ÄúIn Sept., 1861, Young enlisted in Federal army.‚Äù The page also explains that Lute A. Taylor ‚Äúunder title of River Falls Journal; in Sept., 1861, absorbed Prescott Transcript.‚Äù On page 187, the catalogue tells that the River Falls Journal had a suspension in 1861, and in May, ‚Äúremoved to Prescott.‚Äù  References   External links  * Annotated Catalogue of Newspapers * The Prescott Paraclete *The Prescott Transcript *Wisconsin Historical Society *Front Street *Broad Street Category:Defunct newspapers published in Wisconsin Category:Pierce County, Wisconsin ","title":"Prescott Transcript"},{"id":"57320927","text":"Dysdercus concinnus, known generally as the pale red bug or Turk's cap red bug, is a species of red bug in the family Pyrrhocoridae.

also spelt pongyibyan or phongyibyan pwe) is a Burmese language term for the ceremonial cremation of high-ranking Buddhist monks, in particular monks from Myanmar's largest Buddhist order, the Thudhamma Nikaya. Controversy has surrounded the expenses involved in financing such expensive ceremonies.  Regional observances  hintha bird. Phongyibyan is widely observed by Buddhists throughout Myanmar, including the Bamar, Mon, Rakhine, and Shan peoples. Similarly elaborate cremation ceremonies, congruous with those in Myanmar, are also held by the Northern Thai people. Among the Shan and Lanna peoples, the ceremony is known as poy law (·Äï·ÄΩ·ÇÜ·Ä∏·Äú·Ä±·ÇÉ or ‡∏õ‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏•‡πâ‡∏≠), which literally means \\"ceremony of the cart,\\" whereby poy is a Burmese loanword meaning \\"festival\\" or \\"ceremony\\" (cf. Poy Sang Long).  Timing  A temporary prƒÅsƒÅda erected for a notable monk in Pa-auk, Mon State The ceremonial cremation does not necessarily occur immediately after a monk's death. In Northern Thailand, they are typically held between December and March; and in Myanmar, these ceremonies are not held during the Vassa (Buddhist lent). The ceremony typically lasts between 3 and 7 days, depending on the ability of worshippers to organize and finance the ceremonies.  Ceremonial rituals  Some rites have parallels to accounts of the Buddha's own funeral found in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta. An elaborate set of ceremonies, including staged plays, ritual performances, and construction of temporary pyre structures, constitute the cremation. Immediately after the monk's death, the body is embalmed. After the cremation, the remains are collected and housed in a reliquary. The funerary pyre tower or laungdaik. A temporary mortuary chapel called neibban kyaung (·Äî·Ä≠·Äó·Äπ·Äó·Ä¨·Äî·Ä∫·ÄÄ·Äª·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏), with a multi-tiered pyatthat roof, is constructed to house the coffin. The monk may lie in state for several months, while donations are gathered to fund the cremation ceremonies. A massive funerary pyre tower called laungdaik (·Äú·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÄ·Ä∫), representing Mount Meru, along with numerous subsidiary towers, is also constructed by specialist bamboo artisans called sat-hsaya (·ÄÖ·Äï·Ä∫·ÄÜ·Äõ·Ä¨). Crematory hearse in Yangon Ceremonial crematory hearses are often constructed for the cremation, often featuring mythical animals. These hearses or floats are used to transport the coffin to the funerary pyre. The Burmese use hearses featuring hamsa. While the Shan construct hearses featuring the karaweik (a mythical bird), their Northern Thai counterparts build hearses featuring the nok hatsadiling (‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏´‡∏±‡∏™‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡πå), a mythical elephant-headed bird. The pyre is often ignited using rockets or fireworks. Another important ritual during the phongyibyan is a tug-of-war of the funerary pyres, called lun hswe (·Äú·ÄΩ·Äî·Ä∫·ÄÜ·ÄΩ·Ä≤) in Burmese, and lak prasat (‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏ó, lit. \\"pulling of the prasat\\") in Thai. This tug-of-war is believed to generate merit. The Rakhine people perform the tala aka (·Äê·Äú·Ä¨·Ä∏·Ä°·ÄÄ) during the cremation ceremony, whereby around two dozen men carry the bedecked coffin using a bamboo frame, while dancing in unison to the tune of a Burmese hsaing waing orchestra. A staged play called eiyin (·Äß·Äö·ÄÑ·Ä∫), which reflects the pain of the living mourning the departed and combines the Buddhist concept of rebirth and the monk's virtues and life, is performed from the moment the coffin leaves the monastery to the time of cremation. These performances are held during the daytime, generally held in temporary gilt pavilions called san kyaung (·ÄÖ·Ä∂·ÄÄ·Äª·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏), which are erected in the monastery grounds or the village squares.

These are aside from the various overseas landholdings of the Marcos family, which are spread around the world. Along with the Marcos jewels, their overseas landholdings, art collection, and Imelda Marcos' shoe hoard, the Marcos mansions are frequently cited to illustrate the Marcos family‚Äôs wanton spending during the dictatorship. Because the estimated cost of these mansions is much more than the income recorded in Marcos‚Äô sworn statement of assets and liabilities (SALN), the number, size, and opulence of these mansions is interpreted by the Philippine government as prima facie evidence that the Marcoses plundered the Philippine economy. Some of these properties are titled in the name of Marcos family members, but others are titled in the name of identified ‚ÄúMarcos cronies,‚Äù but reserved for the use of the Marcos family. In some cases, several such mansions were located close together, with specific mansions meant for individual members of the family, as was the case of the Marcos mansions on Outlook Drive in Baguio. Many of the Marcos mansions were sequestered by the Philippine government when the Marcoses were expelled from the country as a result of the 1986 EDSA Revolution.  Locations  Locations of houses considered \\"Marcos mansions\\" include properties in Philippines' \\"Summer Capital\\" of Baguio City, in the Ilocos region where the Marcoses trace their ancestry, Leyte where Imelda Marcos' family came from, and throughout the Greater Manila Area and its outskirts. = Baguio properties= Among roughly 50 Marcos mansions scattered throughout the Philippines, the nine properties located in Baguio city are among the most commonly covered by media reports, because of their reported opulence and because of their closeness to each other and to major tourist attractions: including Minesview Park, Wright Park, and the Baguio mansion house which was constructed in the early 1900s to be the summer residence of the Philippine head of state. Four of these houses occupy roughly 5 hectares of land on Outlook Drive, just across from the mansion, and were each designated for a member of the Marcos family; the \\"Wigwam house compound\\" for Bongbong Marcos, the \\"Fairmont house compound for Imee Marcos, the \\"Hans Menzi house compound\\" for Irene Marcos, and a fourth house for Ferdinand Marcos' mother, Do√±a Josefa Edralin Marcos. Located on the same road is a two story house called the \\"Lualhati residence\\", whose title was held by Marcos crony, Jose Y. Campos, on behalf of the Marcoses. Another property, the Banaue Inn compound, is located just behind the Campos house. = Metro Manila properties= Closer to the main seat of power, Marcos mansions were located in Makati, Para√±aque, Pandacan, and San Juan. Houses were once again designated for each of the three Marcos children: a residence in Seaside subdivision, Para√±aque was designated for Bongbong Marcos, one in Wack Wack subdivision in Mandaluyong was designated for Imee Marcos, while a house in Forbes Park, Makati, was designated for Irene Marcos. = Marcos mansions in other provinces= Other locations where Marcos mansions were built include several in Ilocos Norte and Leyte, the home provinces of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos respectively; and in Mariveles, Bataan, and in Cavite. Particularly notable is the Malaca√±ang of the North mansion in Paoay, Ilocos Norte, which was built by the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA) in 1977, in time for Ferdinand Marcos's 60th birthday. The Sandiganbayan anti- graft court stripped the Marcoses of the property in 2014, voiding a 1978 agreement between Marcos and the then PTA, deciding that since it is a national park, the Marcos family had no legal rights over it since national parks are \\"inalienable public domain\\". Bongbong Marcos objected to the decision, saying the property was owned by the family. In Olot, Leyte, a muti- million dollar seaside resort was constructed in 1974, in time for the Marcoses to entertain participants of the 1974 Miss Universe beauty contest, which was being held in the Philippines that year. The property was severely damaged by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. A different mansion, in Tacloban City, is noted for having been the former site of the \\"impoverished quonset hut\\" which was Imelda Marcos' childhood home. When her husband became president of the Philippines, Imelda transformed the site into a 2000 square meter mansion with a shrine to the Sto Ni√±o and a museum, which has since been dubbed the \\"Sto Ni√±o Shrine and Heritage Museum\\". The site was less damaged by Typhoon Haiyan than the Olot mansion was, but still sustained at least PhP20 nillion worth of damages. The Philippine Commission on Good Government, which had sequestered the property, decided to repair the site since it had been converted to a tourist site which was a major money-earner for Leyte.  Use of government money for construction and maintenance Verification by the Philippine government's Commission on Audit after the ouster of the Marcos family revealed that the construction, renovation, and maintenance of these various houses were paid for by the Philipine government through the office of the President. Maintenance and upkeep alone cost at least USD 3.2 million in 1984 and USD 10.5 million in 1985, all at prevailing exchange rates and not yet adjusted for inflation. According to the calculations of author Ricardo Manapat, this would have been sufficient to feed \\"a small town of 48,000 people,\\" or \\"8,000 starving families of 6\\" for a year.

It runs through Shakhriyar Park (formerly Dzerzhinkiy Park) on a long line with a gauge of between two terminus stations. The railway was opened on 10 August 1947 as one of the many pioneer railways in the Soviet Union.Dmitry Sutyagin: Children's Railways of the former USSR - Past and Present: Baku. It was taken out of service and dismantled in June 2009.  History  The idea of building a children's railway in Baku dates back to 1945 when the decision of the Council of Ministers of Azerbaijan on 15 June 1946 defined the beginning and end of the construction of the railway. Construction began on 14 March 1947 and ended on 1 May 1947, the railway line was located in Dzerzhinsky Park (later Shahriyar Park). Pupils and students from Baku also helped to build the railway. About 120 young railway workers were involved in the work. The opening of the Baku Children's Railway took place on 10 August 1947, The first manager of the Baku Children's Railway was M. Achundov. The Zoopark station had three tracks so that the locomotives could be moved to the other end of the train. The railway station Bagar had a triangle for turning the trains, which was later dismantled.Dmitry Sutyagin: Children's Railways of the former USSR - Past and Present: Baku ChRW, Track Plans. According to the construction plan, two phases were originally planned. The first section in Dzerzhinsky Park led to the Republican Stadium, which existed there until 2009, and the second section should have led to the Montin settlement so that the railway would have had a total length of 4 km. But the second section was not built. So there was only the long distance from Dzerzhinsky Park to the Republican Stadium. During the early 1990s, the children's railway lost importance and was removed from the list of Azerbaijani State Railways. As a result, it was in crisis. Since January 2002, however, interest in the Baku Children's Railway has again increased, and the decision of the 1990s has been classified as wrong. The warehouses were repaired and modernized, the rails were renewed in some places, and the signals and contacts were completely repaired. In June 2002, the line was put back into operation after the repair work. In June 2009 the children's railway in Baku was shut down and dismantled and brought to the Bilajari reservoir in order to rebuild it from time to time, but this has not yet been done.Harvey Smith: Steam Age Relics in Azerbaijan 2010.

History  Plans to build the Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii began in 1982, when the Honolulu Japanese Chamber of Commerce began planning to create a space where groups involved with Japanese culture could meet and practice their traditions. The Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii opened on May 28, 1987 in Moiliili, a majority-Japanese neighborhood in Honolulu. By 1989, the fundraising committee had raised $7.5 million from the Keidanren and other Japanese organizations to buy land and construct a new building to house the organization. Construction of the first phase of the building was completed in 1991, while the second was completed in 1994. = \\"Save the Center\\" = In 2002 the JCCH announced that it would sell off the building and the land it sat on in order to pay off millions of dollars in debt accrued during the construction of the second phase of the building. JCCH members started a committee to \\"Save the Center\\", headed by Colbert Matsumoto. They raised $6 million in 47 days, and the lenders forgave the $1.5 million in interest on the loan. The organization reduced the number of board members, changed leadership, and rewrote their mission statement. Once the debt was paid off, they were also able to focus more of their revenue and attention on programs and community outreach. = Finding Honouliuli Internment Camp = After receiving an inquiry about the location of the Honouliuli internment camp from KHNL in 1998, volunteers in the JCCH Resource Center rediscovered the site of the camp in 2002. After completing archaeological surveys with the University of Hawaii West Oahu, the JCCH pushed for the camp site to be included in the National Parks system as a National Monument. In 2014 the JCCH began producing short documentaries about internment, such as \\"The Untold Story: Internment of Japanese-Americans in Hawaii\\". Honouliuli became a National Monument in February 2015. The JCCH also received a series of grants to study and preserve the site, as well as to educate the public about internment in Hawaii.  Exhibits  = Okage Sama De: I am what I am because of you = The shop scene from the JCCH \\"Okage Sama De\\" permanent exhibition. The main exhibit at the Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii is called \\"Okage Sama De: I am what I am because of you\\". It opened in 1995 and shows the history of Japanese immigration to Hawaii from 1868 to present. The exhibit begins by showcasing values that the issei immigrants brought with them, then moves on to depictions of plantation life, picture brides, World War II, the 442nd and 100th Battalion. There is a theater in the middle of the exhibit showing short documentaries produced by the Center. The exhibit then finishes with a section on post-war life in Hawaii. It has held several travelling exhibits, such as the Go For Broke National Education Center's \\"Courage and Compassion: Our Shared Story of the Japanese American WWII Experience\\". After the closure of the Ellison Onizuka Space Center in Kona, some of Onizuka's memorabilia that were on display there, including a moon rock, were put on display in the Japanese Cultural Center's exhibit. = Honouliuli Education Center = The Honouliuli Education Center opened on October 26, 2016. It is an extension of the permanent exhibition \\"Okage Sama De\\", and focuses on the experiences of Japanese-American internees at the Honouliuli internment camp. It includes photographs, videos, artifacts used and created by the internees, and a virtual tour of the camp site.  Events  = New Years Ohana Festival = The Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii has held the New Years Ohana Festival annually since 1993. The festival includes mochi pounding, performances, games, and a craft fair. Many vendors also serve Japanese food. There are also demonstrations of cultural arts such as tea ceremony, bonsai, and sumo. = Sharing the Spirit of Aloha Gala = The Gala is the Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii's largest fundraiser. During the Gala the Center recognizes people who have contributed to the Japanese American community and promoted Japanese culture.

Born in 1917, having spent a long time in Italy in the 1920s when her father directed the Villa M√©dicis, she was a pupil of Marguerite Long and pursued a career as an international virtuoso pianist after the war and until the 1970s. She then became a piano teacher at the Conservatoire de Saint-Denis while beginning a second career as a painter. She merged her two artistic expressions in the 1980s by creating concert exhibitions where she played works by composers who had inspired paintings exhibited and projected during concerts - notably around Debussy, Ravel and Mussorgsky. Her repertoire included an important religious dimension, since she began with the Way of the Cross in St. Peter's Church in Brusc (at Six-Fours-les-Plages, Var) and ends, in the early 2000s, with the Way of the Cross of the Church of L√¥nes, still in Six-Fours-les- Plages. She died in 2007. She was the wife of G√©rard Caillet, French writer, author of several booklets for Marcel Landowski. She was also the mother of the ethnologist Laurence Caillet-Tchang, a Japan specialist, and Elisabeth Caillet-Durieu, a philosopher.

The Italo-Venezuelan team traveled to the Maracan√£ Stadium and took home a 1:0 victory against the Fluminense FC. The goal was scored by central defender Tenorio. The Fluminense of famous Lobo Zagalo, Champion of Brazil, was defeated that year for the first time in its own Maracan√£. The Caracas daily El Universal wrote that: The Deportivo Italia ‚Äì under the direct supervision of Mino D'Ambrosio (who ruled the team with his brother Pompeo D'Ambrosio)‚Äì that night went to the match with Vito Fasano (who for his performance was recruited in Brazil, Vito is Italian) as goalkeeper. At the defence there were Carlos \\"Chiquichagua\\" Mar√≠n, Tenorio, Vincente Arrud and Freddy Elie, while as midfielders Delman \\"Pito\\" Useche, Negri and Rui. In the attack played Alcyr (who was replaced by Bahia), Beto and Militello. In the magazine \\"Incontri\\" of Caracas, Bruno D'Ambrosio (grandson of Mino who attended the match) wrote that in the final half hour the goalkeeper Vito Fassano did miracles: three hits to the poles helped him, but while two knocked externally the door defended by Fassano, the third would have been goal if the goalkeeper had not deflected it with his fingers stretching in an incredible way. Fassano made the best game of his life, according to all the persons who saw the match. Santander Laya-Garrido, who wrote the book \\"Los Italianos forjadores de la nacionalidad y del desarrollo economico en Venezuela\\", said (like others in many newspapers and magazines that since then no other Venezuela football team has obtained a similar international result: until now the \\"Little Maracanazo\\" is the top international victory in the history of the soccer in Venezuela.

She is regarded as the master of \\"uhadi\\" music and the master of Xhosa Thembu song productions such as The Bow Project. Early life She was born in 1928 as Notreyeni Booi in the village of Ngqoko approximately 10 kilometres south of the town of Lady Frere in the Glen Grey District east of Queenstown in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Nofinishi Dywili was a Xhosa person from the Thembu tribe, in the Gcina clan. She was baptised in a Catholic church and practised both African and catholic traditions. She learned how to play the traditional Xhosa \\"Uhadi\\" musical bow from an early age by observing and imitating other uhadi players. She also learned Xhosa lore and practices which related to the training of women and young girls. An African traditional musical bow Personal life At the age of 23, Nofinishi married Mr Qongqothwane N. Dywili with whom she had a son, Makwedini, and six daughters. Her name, Nofinishi, was given to her by her father-in-law. Culturally this was his right, as the one who paid the bride-price (ikhazi) for her on behalf of his son. The name Nofinishi is derived from the word \\"finish\\", and means \\"Mother Finish\\", with the probable implication that her father-in-law was at last finished with paying bride- price for his sons. Qongqothwane worked in mines in Johannesburg however, he left the mines to work on maize and sorghum fields around Ngqoko with his wife soon after their marriage. Nofinishi also worked in her vegetable garden during her spare time. One of her daughters, Nongangekho Dywili also became a traditional Xhosa musician and played the \\"umrhubhe\\" which is a mouth bow. Nofinishi was described as a physically strong woman and could work on the fields for many hours. Her physical strength allowed her to hold the \\"uhadi\\" for long periods of time.Dave Dargie. SAMUS: South African Music Studies, \\"The redoubtable Nofinishi Dywili, uhadi master and Xhosa song leader\\". Volume 30-31 Number 1, January 2010, p. 1‚Äì30. Accessed 20 April 2018 Career Nofinishi Dywili was recognised by the people of her village as a teacher of traditions and customs, she played a significant role in the training of girls and young women to help them prepare for marriage. She shared advice with women at initiation schools and outside of traditional ceremonies. Dywili's musical talents started becoming known to the world in 1981 when Andrew Tracey brought some traditional village musicians including Nofinishi, to perform at the ethnomusicology symposium at Rhodes University. This was her first performance in a South African city. Soon after the symposium she began referring to herself as \\"Nofinishi waseRhini\\" which translates to \\"Nofinishi of Grahamstown\\". Soon after her performance at Rhodes University, other South African universities requested for her to perform during their events. In 1986, Nofinishi and 14 other people from the village of Ngqoqo were requested to perform at the Grahamstown Festival where each person received a payment of R450. Nofinishi along with the rest of the performers from Ngqoqo village who performed at the Grahamstown Festival, including Nokontoni (later Nokoleji) Matiso, the chief diviner of Ngqoko, had a meeting with the aim of seeking further performance opportunities. The outcome of the meeting was the decision, prompted by Nofinishi and Nokontoni, to create a traditional music group. This was the beginning of the increasingly well-known Ngqoko Traditional Xhosa Music Ensemble, also known as the Ngqoko Cultural Group. In 1989, Nofinishi made her first trip outside of South Africa where she visited Paris, France with six other performers from Ngqoko to perform in the Autumn Festival there. One of the attendees of one of their performances included Madame Mitterrand, the wife of the French president at the time. Nofinishi has also performed for the visiting Queen of England in Cape Town in 1999 and various other prominent people in South Africa. Throughout her career, she made many more trips to Europe and the United States of America. Traditional Xhosa music does not place much emphasis on giving accreditation to composers as the majority of the music is passed down from generation to generation. However, Nofinishi often improvised and recreated the traditional music. She also known to have composed her own work including Makwedini, a song for her son Makwedini and UYehova ngumalusi wam (The Lord is my Shepherd). She described her music as \\"iingoma zesiXhosa\\" ‚Äì \\"songs of Xhosa culture\\". She was acknowledged as the leading uhadi player in Ngqoko, and was also regarded as one of the most important Xhosa song leaders of the 20th century.2004\\\\. Performance at the Home of Nofinishi Dywili 5/11/1998, handbook accompanying the DVD (Dargie 2005E). Grahamstown: ILAM Xhosa women in traditional Xhosa attire performing Traditional Xhosa songs are in a call-and-response form. The song leader leads the song by singing the \\"call\\", and the rest of the people respond to the call in song. The song leader also chooses the songs to be sung, and helps structure and organise the different traditional ceremonies. In Ngqoko, Nofinishi was the most important leader of beer songs, these were ancestor songs sung at beer gatherings. She knew and could lead diviners' songs, songs for the young men's dance gatherings, and for the boys' and girls' dances, as well as songs for other rites and ceremonies. She also led the celebratory' dance songs, however she would sometimes cede this role when leader of a higher ranking was present.Alberti, Ludwig. 1968.

Xhosa Music: Its Techniques and Instruments, with a Collection of Songs. Cape Town: David Philip By the end of the 20th century, there were very few people available with the broad skills that Dywili had as she became a living embodiment of the traditions and lore of the Xhosa people. She had vast knowledge of the songs, customs, rites and traditional language of her people regardless of having never learnt to read or write. She called herself \\"iQaba nomRoma\\" which translates as \\"someone who paints him/herself with ochre\\", i.e., who lives in the traditional way, Christian missionaries often incorrectly translated \\"iQaba nomRoma\\" as pagan.Kirby, Percival R. 1968.

It is difficult for new uhadi performers to emulate the complex rhythms used by Nofinishi however it is her contribution to the Xhosa Thembu music which inspired the introduction of \\"uhadi performance\\" into the University of Fort Hare music syllabus in the 1990s. Other universities that have incorporated \\"uhadi\\" music into their African music teaching include Walter Sisulu University, the University of Cape Town and Rhodes University.

Description These bees are very small being around 5 mm in size, however, when compared to their body size they have relatively large wings. They are moderately hairy with hair covering a majority of its body. Their appearance is described as fly-like.,Donovan, B. J. (2007) Fauna of New Zealand, Ko te Aitanga Pepeke o Aotearoa, (Insect; Hymenoptera), Lincoln, Canterbury, New Zealand, 2007 and small and agile.Godley EJ 1979. Flower biology in New Zealand. New Zealand Journal of Botany 17: 441‚Äì466. They have short tongues, but this has no restriction to gather pollen.Goulson D 2003. Effects of introduced bees on native ecosystems. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 34: 1‚Äì26. Females have wider abdomens than the males. They appear very similar in colour and shape to a honey bee, however, the small native bee is not as stout. Because Lasioglossum sordidum are small and fly like looking they often get mistaken for flies or go completely unnoticed.Donovan BJ 2007. Apoidea (Insecta: Hymenoptera). Lincoln, New Zealand, Manaaki Whenua Press. 295 p. Distribution =Natural global range= Lasioglossum sordidum is endemic to New Zealand. =New Zealand range= Lasioglossum sordidum can be found all over New Zealand, with it being one of the most abundant ground-nesting bees.Quinn P 1984. Survey of native bees (Hymenoptera, Colletidae and Halictidae) in the MacKenzie Basin. New Zealand Entomologist 8: 41‚Äì44. The east coast South Island of New Zealand has the most adult numbers of all the native bees. There are known to be Lasioglosssum sordidum in the Christchurch Botanic Gardens, this is due to the great variation of woody and herbaceous plants, with a mixture of exotic ad native plants. =Habitat preferences= The small native bee nests on the ground, with the nest being constructed of many branching tunnels going down to 400mm below the surface in fine grained soils.Wojcik VA, McBride JR 2012. Common factors influence bee foraging in urban and wildland landscapes. Urban Ecosystems 15: 581‚Äì598. Within a few square meters of bare soil, there can be up to hundreds of females nesting. They have been observed to travel rather large distances from their nests to forage for pollen.Primack RB 1978. Variability in New Zealand montane and alpine pollinator assemblages. New Zealand Journal of Ecology 1: 66‚Äì73. Lasioglossum sordidum females are classed as solitary but many forage within the same nest and with many generations active at any given time, this suggests some limited social organization.Donovan BJ 1980. Interactions between native and introduced bees in New Zealand. New Zealand Journal of Ecology 3: 104‚Äì116. Life cycle/Phenology Overwinter females that have been fertilized stay in nests, coming out in late winter as the ground begins to get warmer. During the winter prepupae are in moist soils to survive the cold temperatures, in late spring and early summer new males and females begin to appear, being active during the warmer months. An individual bee is unlikely to live longer than eight weeks. Due to the lengthy time they spend nesting they forage on a wide range of flowering plants. Lasioglossum sordidum are described to have a eusocial life cycle Michener, C. D. (2000). The Bees of the World. Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins University Press. this means that there is a mix of juveniles and adults. Eusociality is used by all bees as a system to raise young. There is limited social organization shown within the behaviours of the bee as they are usually solitary however females forage from one nest. Diet and foraging Lasioglossum sordidum forage over large distances, on both native and introduced plant species, they have been observed to feed on Discaria toumatou flowers.Primack RB 1983. Insect pollination in the New Zealand mountain flora. New Zealand Journal of Botany 21: 317‚Äì333 Introduced legumes and composites are favored by the females. Because of the length of time that they nest they have a large foraging distance. These bees will visit anything that has colours yellow and orange, and will visit flowers in a wide range of flowering plants. Members of the family Asteraceae are reported to be foraged on by Lasioglossum sordidum.Webber CJ, Peterson AJ, Kelly D, Clemens J 2012. Native and exotic flower visitors in the Christchurch Botanic Gardens and their contrasting plant preferences. New Zealand Natural Sciences 37: 37‚Äì49 they are also reported to forage on Hebe (plant). Females have been identified visiting 139 species in 56 families, they have the ability to forage on almost any plant that is flowering, if they can get nectar or pollen from it. Lasioglossum sordidum are polylactic which means that they can collect the pollen from many plants that are usually unrelated Other information Lasioglossum sordidum were found to visit Kiwifruit flowers, and to carry over half a million male pollen grains, this is around the same as a bumble bee.Macfarlane RP, Ferguson AM 1983. Kiwifruit pollination: a survey of the insect pollinators in New Zealand.

But the country is still uneasy: the bourgeois Koreans, who lost power and property, together with the US military advisers are preparing a terrorist plot against Kim Il Sung to overthrow him. On March 1, 1946 a rally is opened in Pyongyang, dedicated to the 27th anniversary of the first March anti-Japanese movement in Korea. At the rally the Chairman of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea Kim Il Sung begins to speak. Suddenly, one of the conspirators throws a grenade in his direction. Junior Lieutenant Novichenko quickly runs up to him, takes it in his hand and, not knowing where to throw it, lies down on it with his body.

It is located in the corner of the southern frontage of the Town Square and Srebrna Street.  History  Initially, until 1496, Cieszyn town hall was made of wood and situated in the middle of the old market square. When the borders of the market square were marked in 1496, prince Casimir II ordered the building of a brick town hall with a wooden tower. This town hall burned down in 1552. It was rebuilt but damaged once again during the Thirty Years‚Äô War. The town hall was renovated in 1661. Krzysztof Palm decorated its fa√ßade with rich painting. It included, inter alia, a picture of Virgin Mary with Baby Jesus and St. Wenceslas and coats of arms of the Duchy of Cieszyn and the town as well as personifications of Faith, Hope, Wisdom and Justice entwined in a ribbon with a sentence in Latin: Haec domus odit, punit, conservat, honorat: nequitiam, pace, orimina, iura, probus (This house hates iniquity, loves peace, punishes crimes, supports the virtuous, honours the worthy). In approx. 1670 on the spot of the former wooden tower a new one, made of brick, was built. The town hall was damaged once again in the fire of 1720. Another building was finished in 1788 thanks to an initiative of father Leopold Szersznik and then destroyed by another fire on 6 May 1789 - the largest fire in the history of Cieszyn. A new Classicist, two-storey town hall with a seven axes fa√ßade was designed by Ignacy Chambrez. The building was inaugurated in 1800. Construction of the hall tower lasted from 10 March to 1 September 1801. The town hall had a storied guard room with a high, garett roof. A part adjacent to the town hall had an arcade passage that joined the market square with Ratuszowa Street. In 1818 an architect Florian Jilg added a theatre hall. The town hall burned down partially in 1836. The interior was rebuilt in 1846 according to the plans of Joseph Kornh√§usel, the fa√ßade was designed by Andrzej Kmenta. The meeting hall of the Town Council was decorated by a frieze designed by Albin Prokop, composed of armorial shields of the Cieszyn gentry and guilds operating in the town. A solemn opening of the town hall was carried out by the emperor Franz Joseph I. By 2006 his portrait was hanging on a wall of the meeting hall and was replaced by a 19th-century coat of arms of Cieszyn. Summer 1984 saw the renovation of the town hall tower, which was in a poor condition.  Architecture  tympanum. The town hall has been rebuilt many times and currently its style may be described as Baroque-Classicistic. Located in the southern frontage of the market square it was built on the plan of a square with a slightly indented northeastern corner. The town hall has three storeys with a dominant clock tower incorporated centrally in the corpus of the building. The facade of the building was built according to the plans of Andrzej Kment. In its central part there is a 6-axes projection based on six pillars surmounted by a triangle pediment with the coat of arms of Cieszyn and a floral ornament. Vertical divisions of the fa√ßade form rusticated pilaster strips, between which a window in profiled frames is located. The second floor is separated by a ledge. The town hall tower is erected on the square plan with rounded corners, decorated by Corinthian pilasters that support a notable ledge on cantilevers and a porch with an iron balustrade. Windows of the tower in its lower part are closed by a full arch. In the upper part the windows are square. All of them have profiled frames. The tower is covered by a tin tent roof crowned by a quadrilateral lantern with doubled columns in the corners. The access to the tower is a 19th-century slatted door with fittings. The tower clock is equipped with a mechanism made by Johan Chris Boeck from Austria in 1851. There are bells from the 18th century in the tower; the first one has a badge with a presentation of Saint Michael; the second was made by Johan Grosmein from Weiten. The interior is arranged according to a three-tract corridor plan. In the basement there are rooms with barrel vaults on straps and sail straps. On the ground floor in the central part of the built there is a hallway with cross-and-barrel vault with straps based on pilasters and wall-contacting pillars. From the side of Srebrna Street there is a second hallway, covered by a modular arch and partly by a sail vault, with additional light provided by a skylight with two windows. The main staircase has a barrel vault with a segment arch. The stairs have three legs, the central leg opened to the inside of the staircase by three arches with a pattern of a basket arch, based on pillars. The walls of the corridor are decorated by wall-contacting pillars. Some of the rooms on the ground floor have a barrel vault with lunettes, cross-barrel; vault or sail vault. On the first floor there is a hall with three fields of sail vaults on straps in the back tract of the building, and on the second floor there are two rooms in the front tract with a sail vault and a vault on straps and a representatives meeting hall.  Session hall  In 1906 the District Court was moved to a building at Garncarska Street. The premises formerly used by the court were used for offices of the town management and for meetings: a smaller room for sessions of various commissions and a bigger one for sessions of the Town Council. A new meeting hall of the town council was equipped with richly decorated elm panelling and a door frame, manufactured by the carpenter Maximilian Schubert. In two corners of the hall two art nouveau stoves - fireplaces with coats of arms of Cieszyn, made in \\"Thonoffenfabrik\\" of R. Weiss in Frydek were placed. In the third corner a cabinet clock made in the workshop of Francis Dibon, a clockmaker from Cieszyn, was located. The decoration of the hall was a heraldic frieze placed under a partially gilded, stucco ceiling. The ceiling was composed of 24 bas-relief crests of Cieszyn guilds made by a sculptor Francis Karger according to a design of Jerzy Frisch and Leonard Hulk. The second part of the frieze included 39 coats of arms of Dukes of Cieszyn, representatives of the gentry of Cieszyn as well as coats of arms of Silesia and Cieszyn. They were painted by Maximilian Salomon. The meeting hall was equipped with a set of furniture including seats, benches and tables. On the front wall an oil portrait of the emperor Franz Joseph was framed to the wood panelling. Between the windows seven portraits of parliamentarians painted by an Austrian painter Jan Daniel Donat were hung. On 6 May 1779 they signed the Treaty of Teschen. On the opposite wall there were seven oil portraits of the Habsburgs, who at the same time were Dukes of Cieszyn. The back wall was decorated by portraits of three founders of town foundations - count Adam Wac≈Çaw Paczy≈Ñski from Tenczyn, baron Karol Cselesta and baron Adam Borek. The author of the concept of the meeting room and its heraldic frieze was the construction adviser of the Chamber of Cieszyn Albin Teodor Prokop, who left a manuscript with a description of the hall with a history of its creation. The meeting hall of the town council was put into service on 2 September 1906, when the emperor Franz Joseph visited the town and paid a visit to the town hall.  Trivia  Since 2014 the historic interior of the session hall of the Cieszyn town hall has been made available for wedding ceremonies. At noon from the tower of the town hall a bugle call is played composed to commemorate 1150th anniversary of the legendary foundation of Cieszyn. It is based on a popular folk song: \\"Helo...Helo...Helenko...jakus Ci sie pasie?\\".

It is a multi-site SAC with an area of 27003.07 ha consisting of 10 separate sites including the summit of Scafell Pike, which at 977 m (3,206 ft) is the highest mountain in England. The SAC takes its name from the English Lake District and \\"Fell\\" , the local word for a mountain. It protects 16 habitat types listed in the European Union's Habitats Directive. As is usual with SACs in England, the protected areas are also covered by Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) designations. The ten component sites are as follows: *River Eden & Tributaries SSSI (overlaps the SAC) *River Derwent & Tributaries SSSI (overlaps the SAC) *Buttermere Fells SSSI *Armboth Fells SSSI *Skiddaw Group SSSI *Helvellyn & Fairfield SSSI *Wasdale Screes SSSI (Wast Water is a separate SAC protecting the lake) *Scafell Pikes SSSI *Pillar & Ennerdale Fells SSSI *Honister Crag SSSI *Birk Fell SSSI *Shap Fells SSSI Management issues Much of the land is used as pasture. At the time the SAC was designated, the view was expressed that sheep grazing had had by far the biggest man-made impact on the condition of almost all of the features in the SAC. Less than 1% of the SAC is woodland. The scarcity of trees is partly explained by the fact that some of the SAC lies above the tree line (in the Lake District the climatic tree line is estimated to lie at about 535 m.). However, the natural climax vegetation would in many places be woodland. In the context of the habitats of scientific interest, a problem of \\"inappropriate grazing\\" has been identified. One of the SSSIs underpinning the SAC where there is woodland is in Ennerdale, which is the home of a rewilding project. The SAC is within the Lake District National Park which has a duty to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the area. Since the SAC was designated, the significance of the National Park as a cultural landscape has been endorsed by UNESCO, which gave the Lake District World Heritage Site status in 2017. However, the sheep farming tradition is not without its critics. The environmentalist George Monbiot has described the High Fells as a \\"sheep museum\\". In 2018 it was revealed in answer to a parliamentary question that English Nature had failed to inspect a number of SSSIs, including Scafell Pike, within the required six-year timescale. Budget cuts were blamed. References External links * High Fells.

Graphene is one of the most promising nanomaterials for the future because of its various characteristics, like strong stiffness and high electric and thermal conductivity. Still, reproducible production of Graphene is difficult, thus many different techniques have been developed. The main advantage of epitaxial graphene growth on silicon carbide over other techniques is to obtain graphene layers directly on a semiconducting or semi-insulating substrate which is commercially available. History The thermal decomposition of bulk SiC was first reported in 1965 by Badami. He annealed the SiC in vacuum to around 2180 ¬∞C for an hour to obtain a graphite lattice. In 1975, Bommel et al. then achieved to form monolayer graphite on the C-face as well as the Si-face of hexagonal SiC. The experiment was carried out under UHV with a temperature of 800 ¬∞C and hints for a graphene structure could be found in LEED patterns and the change in the carbon Auger peak from a carbided character to a graphite character. New insights in the electronic and physical properties of graphene like the Dirac nature of the charge carriers, half-integer quantum Hall effect or the observation of the 2D electron gas behaviour were first measured on multilayer graphene from de Heer et al. at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2004. Still, the Nobel Prize in Physics ‚Ä≥for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene‚Ä≥ in 2010 was awarded to Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov. An official online document of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences about this awarding got under fire. Walter de Heer mentions several objections about the work of Geim and Novoselov who apparently have measured on many-layer graphene, also called graphite, which has different electronic and mechanical properties. Emtsev et al. improved the whole procedure in 2009 by annealing the SiC-samples at high temperatures over 1650 ¬∞C in an argon environment to obtain morphologically superior graphene. Process The underlying process is the desorption of atoms from an annealed surface, in this case a SiC-sample. Due to the fact that the vapor pressure of carbon is negligible compared to the one of silicon, the Si atoms desorb at high temperatures and leave behind the carbon atoms which form graphitic layers, also called few-layer graphene (FLG). Different heating mechanisms like e-beam heating or resistive heating lead to the same result. The heating process takes place in vacuum to avoid contaminations. Approximately three bilayers of SiC are necessary to set free enough carbon atoms needed for the formation of one graphene layer. This number can be calculated out of the molar densities. Today's challenge is to improve this process for industrial fabrication. The FLG obtained so far has a non-uniform thickness distribution which leads to different electronic properties. Because of this, there's a demand for growing uniform large-area FLG with the desired thickness in a reproducible way. Also, the impact of the SiC substrate on the physical properties of FLG is not totally understood yet. The thermal decomposition process of SiC in high / ultra high vacuum works out well and appears promising for large scale production of devices on graphene basis. But still, there are some problems that have to be solved. Using this technique, the resulting graphene consists of small grains with varying thickness (30 nm-200 nm). These grains occur due to morphological changes of the SiC surface under high temperatures. On the other side, at relatively low temperatures, poor quality occurs due to the high sublimation rate. The growth procedure was improved to a more controllable technique by annealing the SiC-samples at high temperatures over 1650 ¬∞C in an argon environment. The desorbed silicon atoms from the surface collide with the argon atoms and a few are reflected back to the surface. This leads to a decrease of the Si evaporation rate. Carrying out the experiment under high temperatures further enhances surface diffusion. This leads to a restructuring of the surface which is completed before the formation of the graphene layer. As an additional advantage, the graphene domains are larger in size than in the initial process (3 x 50 Œºm2) up to 50 x 50 Œºm2 . Of course, the technology always undergoes changes to improve the graphene quality. One of them is the so-called confinement controlled sublimation (CCS) method. Here, the SiC sample is placed in a graphite enclosure equipped with a small leak. By controlling the evaporation rate of the silicon through this leak, a regulation of the graphene growth rate is possible. Therefore, high-quality graphene layers are obtained in a near- equilibrium environment. The quality of the graphene can also be controlled by annealing in the presence of an external silicon flux. By using disilane gas, the silicon vapor pressure can be controlled. Crystallographic orientation between the SiC and graphene layers SiC is bipolar and therefore the growth can take place on both the SiC(0001) (silicon-terminated) or SiC(000) (carbon- terminated) faces of 4H-SiC and 6H-SiC wafers. The different faces result in different growth rates and electronic properties. =Silicon-terminated face= On the SiC(0001) face, large-area single crystalline monolayer graphene with a low growth rate can be grown. These graphene layers do have a good reproducibility. In this case, the graphene layer grows not directly on top of the substrate but on a complex (6 \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{3} \\\\times 6 \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{3}) \\\\mathrm{R}30^\\\\circ structure. This structure is non-conducting, rich of carbon and partially covalently bonded to the underlying SiC substrate and provides therefore a template for subsequent graphene growth and works as an electronic ‚Ä≥buffer layer‚Ä≥. This buffer layer forms a non-interacting interface with the graphene layer on top of it. Therefore, the monolayer graphene grown an SiC(0001) is electronically identical to a freestanding monolayer of graphene. Changing the growth parameters such as annealing temperature and time, the number of graphene layers on the SiC(0001) can be controlled . The graphene always maintains its epitaxial relationship with the SiC substrate and the topmost graphene, which originates from the initial buffer layer, is continuous everywhere across the substrate steps and across the boundary between regions with different numbers of graphene layers. The buffer layer does not exhibit the intrinsic electronic structure of graphene but induces considerable n-doping in the overlying monolayer graphene film. This is a source of electronic scattering and leads therefore to major problems for future electronic device applications based on SiC-supported graphene structures. This buffer layer can be transformed into monolayer graphene by decoupling it from the SiC substrate using an intercalation process. It is also possible to grow off axis on 6H-SiC(0001) wafers. Ouerghi obtained a perfect uniform graphene monolayer at the terraces by limiting the silicon sublimation rate with N2 and silicon fluxes in UHV at an annealing temperature of 1300 ¬∞C. A growth on the 3C-SiC(111) face is also possible. Therefore, annealing temperatures over 1200 ¬∞C are necessary. First, the SiC loses silicon atoms and the top layer rearranges in a SiC(\\\\sqrt{3} \\\\times \\\\sqrt{3}) \\\\mathrm{R}30^\\\\circ structure. A loss of further silicon atoms leads to a new intermediate distorted stage of SiC(\\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\times \\\\sqrt{3}) \\\\mathrm{R}30^\\\\circ which matches almost the graphene (2 x 2) structure. Losing the residual silicon atoms, this evolves into graphene. The first four layers of cubic SiC(111) are arranged in the same order as SiC(0001) so the findings are applicable to both structures. =Carbon-terminated face= The growth on the SiC(000) face is much faster than on the SiC(0001) face . Also the number of layers is higher, around 5 to 100 layers and a polycrystalline nature appear. In early reports, the regions of graphene growths have been described as ‚Ä≥islands‚Ä≥ since they appear on microscopy images as pockets of graphene on the substrate surface. Hite et al. however found out, that these islands are positioned at a lower level than the surrounding surface and referred them as graphene covered basins (GCBs). The suggestion is, that crystallographic defects in the substrate act as nucleation sites for these GCBs. During the growth of the graphene layers, the GCBs coalesce with each. Because of their different possible orientations, sizes and thickness, the resulting graphene film contains misoriented grains with varying thickness. This leads to large oriental disorder. Growing graphene on the carbon-terminated face, every layer is rotated against the previous one with angles between 0¬∞ and 30¬∞ relative to the substrate. Due to this, the symmetry between the atoms in the unit cell is not broken in multilayers and every layer has the electronic properties of an isolated monolayer of graphene. Evaluation of number of graphene layers LEEM images and reflectivity data of graphene on 4H-SiC(0001), showing a number of dips in reflectivity corresponding to the layer number. Adapted from To optimize the growth conditions, it is important to know the number of graphene layers. This number can be determined by using the quantized oscillations of the electron reflectivity. Electrons have a wave character. If they are shot on the graphene surface, they can be reflected either from the graphene surface or from the graphene-SiC interface. The reflected electrons (waves) can interfere with each other. The electron reflectivity itself changes periodically as a function of the incident electron energy and the FLG thickness. For example, thinner FLG provides longer oscillation periods. The most suitable technique for these measurements is the low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM). A fast method to evaluate the number of layers is using optical microscope in combination with contrast-enhancing techniques. Single- layer graphene domains and substrate terraces can be resolved on the surface of SiC. The method is particularly suitable for quick of the surface. Applications Furthermore, epitaxial graphene on SiC is considered as a potential material for high-end electronics. It is considered to surpass silicon in terms of key parameters like feature size, speed and power consumption and is therefore one of the most promising materials for future applications. =Saturable absorber= Using a two-inch 6H-SiC wafer as substrate, the graphene grown by thermal decomposition can be used to modulate a large energy pulse laser. Because of its saturable properties, the graphene can be used as a passive Q-switcher. =Metrology= The quantum Hall effect in epitaxial graphene can serve as a practical standard for electrical resistance. The potential of epitaxial graphene on SiC for quantum metrology has been shown since 2010, displaying quantum Hall resistance quantization accuracy of three parts per billion in monolayer epitaxial graphene. Over the years precisions of parts-per-trillion in the Hall resistance quantization and giant quantum Hall plateaus have been demonstrated. Developments in encapsulation and doping of epitaxial graphene have lead to the commercialisation of epitaxial graphene quantum resistance standards =Hall Sensors= =Other= The graphene on SiC can be also an ideal platform for structured graphene (transducers, membranes). Open problems Limitations in terms of wafer sizes, wafer costs and availability of micromachining processes have to be taken into account when using SiC wafers. Another problem is directly coupled with the advantage. of growing the graphene directly on a semiconducting or semi-insulating substrate which is commercially available. But there's no perfect method yet to transfer the graphene to other substrates. For this application, epitaxial growth on copper is a promising method. The carbon's solubility into copper is extremely low and therefore mainly surface diffusion and nucleation of carbon atoms are involved.

In 1960, he returned to Wales as Assistant Keeper of the Welsh Folk Museum at St Fagans, and nine years later he secured promotion as Keeper of Material Culture. He then moved in 1977 to the Welsh Industrial and Maritime Museum in Cardiff, to be closer to the sea and his interest in maritime history; he regarded the decade he spent there as the happiest of his career. In 1981, the University of Wales conferred on him a doctor of science degree. But his move back to St Fagans and the Folk Museum in 1987 to be its Curator was less happy, owing in part to clashes with management and what Jenkins regarded as English interference.

The tower is available for visitors (admission tickets). The tower offers a panoramic view of Cieszyn and Czech Cieszyn on the both banks of Olza river. Visibility permitting, one can admire an interesting panorama of Silesian Beskids and Moravian-Silesian Beskids.  History  The Piast Tower was built in the first part of the 14th century and was a part of the upper castle. As one of the four towers it was an important element of the defence system of the castle of Cieszyn in the times of the Piasts. The tower was enlarged in the second half of the fourteenth century and decorated with corner heraldic shields depicting the eagle of the Piasts. At the end of the 15th century another storey was added with machicolation and brick crenellation covered by a high tent roof. The tower is almost 30 metres high with 120 stairs leading to the top. It is composed of four major parts. The underground part, six metres deep, was a dungeon in the past. The lower part is 9 metres wide and 10 metres high. This part of the tower housed non- residential premises. The middle part was 15 metres high and 8.5 metres wide. This was a residential part. The highest level, 4 metres high, served defensive purposes. In the Middle Ages the top of the tower was covered by a roof under which there was a circular defensive porch. The corners of the upper part were equipped with protrusions in the form of round pinnacles. The interior of the tower was illuminated by defensive window holes of various shapes and sizes. The castle and the tower as well burned many times. The fires in 1484, 1520, 1552, 1570 and 1603 affected the condition of the tower, although the worst damage was done in the course of the Thirty Years War. In 1647 Austrian troops besieged the castle, that was in the hands of a Swedish crew. As the result of the fights and cannon firing the roof of the tower and the corner pinnacles with a considerable part of the upper part of the tower were damaged. From that time the condition of the Piast castle gradually deteriorated. The tower has been renovated many times, inter alia between 1819 and 1840 when the tent roof was replaced by a recessed roof, and on the tower a clock was installed. In the 20th century the tower was renovated in 1976-89, adding, inter alia, an observation deck on the top of it, restoring battlements and the shields with the Piast eagles. The last renovation took place in 2015 at the upper part of the Piast Tower - in the so-called crenellation. Concrete stairs were renovated, damaged rails were repaired, the platform and the ceiling of the last level were restored. Throughout the ages the tower has been recognised as a symbol of Cieszyn, a testimony of its Piast past and Poles keeping guard on the Olza river.  Architecture  The Piast Tower is located on the top of the hill, in its north-western part. Gothic, masonry, built in the first half of the 14th century of broken stone and building stones in the corners and frames of the window holes, in the upper part it is built of brick in Polish layout. Built on a square plan, with extensive and cellars partially filled with debris and earth that were supposed to lead to an underground exit beyond the castle walls[8]. Five- storey, 24 meters high. In the lower part the walls are 2 metres thick and from the inside get narrower gradually upwards. Rectangular windows, with Gothic or semi-circular arches. Additional parts built in the 15th century - added brick porch based on solid stone cantilevers, with machicolations and crenellations. As can be seen in an engraving from 1735, initially the tower was covered by a tent roof with separate needles over the corner protrusions of the crenellations. Under the corner protrusions there are four Gothic heraldic shields from the end of the 14th century with the Piast eagles made of a flat relief, according to tradition sculptured by the Prague master Peter Parler.  Opening hours  The Piast Tower is open to the public daily with few exceptions of (Easter,and Christmas day): * June - August: 9.00 A.M. - 7.00 P.M. * January, February, November, December : from 9.00 A.M.-4.00 P.M * March, April, October: Mon-Fri 9.00 A.M.- 5.00 P.M. * May and September: 9.00 A.M. - 6.00 P.M.  Trivia  Persons awarded by a special identity card issued by Castle Cieszyn are allowed to stay overnight in the Piast Tower free of charge. There is a website available on the Internet showing the panorama of Cieszyn recorded from the Piast Tower. In the vicinity of the Piast Tower there is the longest in Europe (65 metres) underground ice tunnel dug in the rock under the Castle Hill. The entrance to the tunnel was located in the Brackie Castle Brewery (the Piast Tower is a distinctive element of the label of Brackie beer) and was used for storing beer. The Piast Tower is depicted next to Saint Nicolas Rotunda on a tourist badge (No. 173).

Benn argued that as he had not applied for a writ of summons, he was not a member of the House of Lords and that the voters had the right to choose who they wanted to represent them. The court made a ruling of undue election because the voters were aware that Benn was legally disqualified from sitting in the House of Commons, their votes had to be counted as being \\"thrown away\\" and Malcolm St Clair as the runner-up would take the seat instead.  Background  Anthony Wedgwood Benn had been elected as the MP for Bristol South East since 1950 as a Labour Party candidate. During that time he was heir to the Viscount Stansgate title held by his father William Wedgwood Benn, 1st Viscount Stansgate, which Benn tried several times to renounce his right to. When his father died in 1961, Benn called the Speaker of the House of Commons to inform him of this. The Speaker told Benn that because he was now legally a peer, he was disqualified from sitting and speaking in the House of Commons. A by-election was called and Benn decided to fight it anyway. The Conservative Party candidate, Malcolm St Clair, ran several adverts in local papers telling voters that there was no point in voting for Benn as he was disqualified from sitting in the House of Commons as he was a hereditary peer. Despite this, Benn won the election and went to the door of the House of Commons to take his oath of allegiance. However the doorkeeper of the House had been told by the Speaker to not allow Benn access, specifically authorising the use of force to prevent him entering, because he was not legally allowed in the Commons as a hereditary peer. St Clair issued an election petition against the results stating that Benn could not take his seat as he was disqualified. The petition was accepted by the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales and the case would be heard by an election court. During the two months preceding the case, Benn along with his sons Stephen and Hilary, and his legal advisor Michael Zander were granted permission by the Speaker to access the House of Commons Library to help with their case.  Court hearing  Against legal advice of the Labour Party's Queen's Counsels, Benn represented himself in pro per during the proceedings. During his opening address, Benn took 22 hours to make it and took 537 questions while doing so. Sir Andrew Clark QC, acting as St Clair's barrister argued in his response that a peer upon succession, regardless of whether they had asked for one or not, was entitled to a writ of summons to the House of Lords which the Crown could not refuse to grant. He argued that merely having that right was grounds for disqualification as being a member of the House of Lords was incompatible with being an MP in the House of Commons. Benn argued that to expel an elected member of the House of Commons on the grounds that he had the right for a writ of summons, was to punish him for doing something he had not done. He cited that there was no precedent to punish a hereditary peer for refusing a writ of summons and referenced the Garter King of Arms's Register of Lords Spiritual and Temporal, where there were forty instances in 500 years of peers not claiming their right to a writ. Since 1955, if a peer did not reply to the Lord Chancellor in relation to their right, they were deemed to be on a leave of absence and attendance was not expected.  Verdict  Justices Gorman and McNair delivered their verdict, which took two hours to read out. During it they praised Benn for \\"the magnificent way he had presented his case\\". However, they found the election of Benn to be undue, as he had succeeded his father as Viscount Stansgate and thus was disqualified from being elected as a hereditary peer. They stated that a hereditary peerage was \\"an incorporeal hereditament affixed to your blood and annexed for posterity\\". They made their judgement in favour of St Clair as despite the voters knowing that Benn was disqualified during the election campaign, their votes were to be treated as being \\"thrown away\\" as they had been given notice by St Clair of Benn's ineligibility. Benn's attempts to renounce his title were stated as being too technical for voters to have easily understood. As a result, St Clair was elected in place of Benn.  Aftermath  Despite losing the court case, Benn continued to campaign to be able to renounce his peerage. The Peerage Act 1963 was passed which allowed for hereditary peers to disclaim their peerage and surrender their right to sit in the House of Lords. This act was created partially as a result of Benn's campaign but also because of the Conservative Party wishing for either Alec Douglas-Home, Earl of Home or Quintin Hogg, Viscount Hailsham to become Prime Minister and it was considered constitutionally inappropriate for the Prime Minister to sit in the House of Lords. Benn took the opportunity to disclaim his title 22 minutes after the bill had come into law. St Clair, acting pursuant to a promise he made to respect the wishes of the people of his constituency, agreed to take the position of Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead, an office of profit under the Crown, in order to disqualify himself from his seat. This forced a by-election which Benn won, allowing him to reclaim his seat in the House of Commons. Benn remained an MP until 2001 when he retired. Upon leaving the Commons, hints were dropped to Benn to see if he would take a life peerage to re-enter the House of Lords but Benn rebuffed them saying \\"I wouldn't be seen dead in the place\\".

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. History Beginning in the late nineteenth century, Bloomfield Township became a fashionable area for wealthy Detroit businessmen wanting a country estate. One of those wealthy businessmen was John Endicott. Endicott graduated from Harvard in 1889 and arrived in Detroit in 1891 to work in his uncle's dry goods business, Newcomb, Endicott & Company. The company had been established in 1868, and by the 1890s was a prosperous Detroit retail store. Endicott started as a bookkeeper, was admitted as a partner in 1896 upon his uncle's death, and was appointed treasurer of the firm in 1903 when it incorporated. John Endicott married his second wife, Mary Elizabeth Booth, in 1902, after the death of his first wife in 1900. In 1905, the couple purchased this lot of 94 acres for their country estate. The property contained a mill pond and a farmhouse, and in 1906 the Endicotts moved into the farmhouse permanently. They established a stock farm, constructing new barns on the property. They constructed this new house at some later point, likely around 1910. The Endicotts continued to live in this house, although John Endicott continued his business dealings in Detroit, first at Newcomb, Endicott & Company until its sale to Hudson's in 1927, and then in other capacities. In 1928 the Endicotts subdivided part of their farm acreage into 26 lots, keeping the 64 acre section around the house. They lived there until Mary's death in 1944. John Endicott lived in the house until 1954, when he sold the property to Donald and Florence James, who subdivided the remaining acreage into 38 lots, leaving two acres around this house. Description The Endicott House is a two-story wood-frame Dutch Colonial Revival house with Arts and Crafts influences. The front facade has a wraparound porch with a center projection, supported by fieldstone piers. A central entrance door is flanked by multi-light sidelights. Four one-over-one wood sash windows are on each side of the entry. On the second floor are two arched dormers with paired nine-over-one windows, linked by a shed-roofed dormer containing four six-over-one windows. The wraparound porch continues to the side elevations, where it accesses decorative French doors on each side. At the rear are two gambrel roofed projections.

She is also a children's book author who writes predominantly utilizing Native American folklore and themes. Among these books are Blue-Wings-Flying and TayTay's Tales. In writing these children's books, and other works by her like Kaw-eh and Say the Bells of Old Missions: Legends of Old New Mexico Churches that are not necessarily children's books, DeHuff is instrumental in documenting Native American folklore and providing authenticity in the telling of it. Overall, she wrote 65 works in 118 publications. These other works included non children's books and periodical articles Native American, Hispanic, and New Mexico subjects. Life and career Elizabeth Willis DeHuff was likely born in 1886, though some people say 1892, in Augusta, South Carolina, to John Turner and Ann Boyd Wilson Willis as one of their five children. She went to school at Lucy Cobb Institute in Athens, Ga.. Later, she went to Barnard College in New York City for her teaching degree, and then she went to the Philippine Islands to teach in 1910. During her time there, she met her husband, Jeff David DeHuff. Upon returning to the United States, she married John David and then went to live in Pennsylvania in 1913. Her husband's job was at the Carlisle Indian School there. However, it wasn't until 1916 that she first really started to get involved with Native peoples by following her husband to Santa Fe, New Mexico. She was twenty-four at the time. Her fascination with Native American culture quickly started developing as she became involved with the community surrounding the Santa Fe Indian School, which her husband had become the superintendent of. As a result of the Bureau of Indian Affairs prohibiting arts training,\\"Velino Shije Herrera.\\" St. James Guide to Native North American Artists. Gale, 1998. Gale Biography in Context. Web. October 4, 2011.Arthur Silberman. \\"Herrera, Velino.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. October 4, 2011 she became an art instructor, particularly on that of painting, starting from inside her own home. Some of her students came to include natives from the Hopi tribe, like Fred Kabotie and Otis Polelonema, and those from the Zia Pueblo tribe, like Velino Shije Herrera, and other Native American tribes. Awa Tsireh was also among the students she taught. As an instructor, her contributions in art are seen to help represent the Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas. Her teaching of painting to these students has been described as a seminal event in the development of the Southwest Movement of Native American painting.Saradell Ard, et al. \\"Native North American art.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. October 4, 2011 In 1919, the work of DeHuff's students was displayed at the Museum of New Mexico. As a result of her instruction methods, some people accused her lessons of pushing beliefs of paganism onto students. This was because the works resulting from her instruction reiterated tribal stories and customs of Native Americans. DeHuff's first children's book was published in 1922 called Taytay's Tales. Art from Fred Kabotie and Otis Polelonema, her students, were included in this work. This was the first book illustrated by Native Americans. She often had students or former students illustrate her works for children. Her next children's book was published in 1924, Taytay's Memories. In 1924, a play DeHuff wrote, Kaw-eh, was performed by students from Santa Fe Indian School. While she was in Santa Fe, DeHuff also took part in many civic and artistic events. In general, she also wrote multiple periodical articles on American Indian, Latin American, and New Mexico historical and cultural topics as well as publishing regularly in the magazine of the Museum of New Mexico, El Palacio. By 1927, DeHuff was no longer directly in contact with students as she left for another school with her husband. From about this time till about 1945, she took part in the Santa Fe Indian Detours where she lectured several nights a week at La Fonda Hotel. Her closeness thus continued with Native Americans throughout her life. As a result, she maintained her friendship and encouragement of Indian artists, especially that of Fred Kabotie, who she was especially close to. In 1943 she published her book, Say the Bells of Old Missions: Legends of Old New Mexico Churches, in which DeHuff is noted for her documentation of thirty different folktales as presented by Catholic Native Americans of New Mexico. Like all of her works, it is also noticed for its use of illustrations. Unlike her other works, the illustrations in this book are that of photographs while her other works contain significantly more artwork created by hand. It also provides readers with history on New Mexico missions initiated by the Catholic Church. Two years later, 1945, DeHuff's husband, John David, died, resulting in DeHuff going back to Georgia. She continued her writing there and took on genealogical research writing until she died in 1983. In 1977, DeHuff wrote her final children book, Blue-Wings-Flying. In life, DeHuff had three children by the name of David, Ann, and Frances. Postmortem, DeHuff's collection of Native American artwork became most of the work incorporated in the Elizabeth Willis DeHuff Collection of American Indian Art, which contains 199 pieces of art from different Native American artists from various tribes. Represented in it are more than fifty-five Native American artists. Historians note that DeHuff and her husband were significant patrons of Pueblo culture.

It stars Joey King, Jacob Elordi, Joel Courtney and Molly Ringwald. The film follows Elle (King), a quirky, late blooming teenager whose budding romance with high school senior and bad boy Noah (Elordi) puts her lifelong friendship with Noah's younger brother Lee (Courtney) in jeopardy. The Kissing Booth was released on Netflix on May 11, 2018, and was dubbed a commercial success by the service, due to it being widely viewed by subscribers. The film received largely negative reviews from critics, who deemed its storyline and themes to be clich√©d and misogynistic. A sequel, The Kissing Booth 2, was released on July 24, 2020, and a third film, The Kissing Booth 3, is in post- production and is scheduled for a 2021 release. Plot Rochelle \\"Elle\\" Evans and Lee Flynn, born at the same time in the same hospital in Los Angeles, have been best friends all their lives due to their mothers, Joni Evans and Sara Flynn, growing up together and having a deep bond. As the two grow up, they develop a love of dancing, specifically on an arcade dance machine on the Santa Monica Pier modeled after Dance Dance Revolution. When Elle is 11, her mother becomes terminally ill and, three years later, passes away. As she grows up, Elle's crush on Lee's older brother, Noah, deepens, but she tries her hardest to ignore it. On the first day of junior year after summer break, Elle's school uniform pants split and all of her backups are at the dry cleaners. She has to wear her school uniform skirt from freshman year and becomes the centre of attention after reaching school. An older student, Tuppen, inappropriately slaps Elle's buttocks. Lee tries to defend Elle but Noah steps in and fights Tuppen. Tuppen, Noah, and Elle are served with detention, where Tuppen apologizes, and vamps in a school uniform skirt. Elle later accepts his request for a date. Tuppen does not show up though, later confessing to Elle that Noah has warned everyone to not pursue Elle romantically. Elle and Lee dream up the idea of a \\"Kissing Booth\\" for their Los Angeles Day School \\"Annual Fiesta Fundraiser.\\" During a party, Elle tells the popular OMG girls (the trio of Olivia, Mia, and Gwyneth) that Noah will be part of the booth, despite Noah having already refused her request. The Kissing Booth opens to a roaring crowd, with Ollie and Olivia kicking it off as the first masked kissers. Everything goes well until Lee serves as the Flynn family kisser instead of Noah. The crowd of disappointed girls starts leaving the booth and Rachel steps up to kiss Lee. Lee and Rachel leave the booth in Elle's hands as they enjoy the fair. Annoyed that Elle lied about Noah's participation, the OMG Girls set up Elle to kiss an undesirable student. At the last second, the student waves Noah ahead. Noah kisses the blindfolded Elle, and when she lifts her blindfold and sees Noah in front of her, they kiss again in front of all the whole school. Cleaning up the booth, Elle is upset to see Noah flirting with another girl, and starts running home. Noah offers her a ride on his motorcycle, but the rain forces them to take shelter in a park gazebo. Elle kisses Noah, but then tells him she cannot be just another sexual conquest. Hurt, Noah reveals he has feelings for her. They kiss again but are interrupted by a security guard who recognizes Noah, telling him to stop bringing girls there, angering Elle. Near the end of a raucous beach party, complete with a slip-n-slide, drinking games, beer pong, and bonfires, Warren tries to convince Elle to go to a hot tub, much to Elle's objections. Noah comes out of nowhere to Elle's defense. Warren taunts Noah for his protectiveness and Noah body slams Warren while Elle runs away from the situation. Noah catches up to her and gives her a ride home. Along the way, he apologizes for his feelings for her as they detour to the Hollywood Sign. They profess their mutual feelings for each other, establishing rules for their relationship, most importantly that Lee never finds out. Elle and Noah keep seeing each other secretly. Noah's mother almost catches them in his room. While hiding under his bed, Elle overhears Noah's mother say he has been accepted to an Ivy League school. Noah swears Elle to secrecy that he has been accepted to Harvard University. They spend a lot of time sneaking around, hiding their relationship from friends and family. While fixing Noah's motorcycle, Elle falls and cuts her face. Lee walks in while Noah is taking care of her wound in his room - confused, Lee accuses Noah of having hurt Elle. Lee asks Elle if she and Noah are dating and Elle swears there is nothing going on. As Noah and Elle share a kiss after agreeing to tell Lee the truth, he walks in on them. Lee is furious that Elle has broken their friendship rules. Lee is very upset with both Elle and Noah and finds out that they have been having sex and lying to him. Lee runs to his car, and tells Elle that their friendship is the one thing his brother never had, and that now he has nothing. Lee peels off in his car. Elle lashes out at Noah, blaming him for exposing their relationship. Noah rides off on his motorcycle. One day, Mrs Flynn visits a despondent Elle and explains that even she and Elle's mother had fights sometimes but they always forgave each other because that's what best friends do. The next couple of weeks, Noah is MIA at school, risking graduating, and Lee completely ignores Elle. Elle's dad pays for driving lessons as she now has to commute to school on her own. She all of a sudden remembers Rule #7: \\"No matter how mad you are at your best friend, you have to forgive them if they give you ice cream.\\" She offers him a chocolate ice cream cone, but he throws it in the garbage can. Noah visits Mr. Evans to apologize for letting his feelings for Elle surface. Mr. Evans says that while he does not necessarily support their relationship, Elle has to decide what is best for herself. While sitting at the arcade, Elle sees Lee enter the arcade, pop four quarters in for Player 1 on the dance machine, and then, four more quarters for Player 2, inviting Elle to dance with him as the music starts up. Lee forgives Elle and they reconcile. Elle goes to prom with Lee and his girlfriend Rachel. The three of them enter the Los Angeles Country Day Prom, where the party is in full swing with a live band. Huge black and white photographs taken by \\"The Yearbook Guy\\" adorn the walls of Memory Lane, a special prom exhibit. Deeper into Memory Lane lies the Kissing Booth. The crowd cheers for both Lee and Elle. Lee puts the blindfold on to reenact his and Rachel's first kiss. Noah emerges from the back of the Kissing Booth, inviting Elle up to the stage. Elle tries to leave, while Noah confesses his love for her publicly. Elle says she cannot keep hurting the people that love her and Noah asks her what she wants. Elle runs and Rachel runs after her. Lee walks off the stage. At home, Noah apologizes to Lee for everything and tells Lee that he is serious about Elle and will be leaving for Boston the next day to get settled in for college. At Elle and Lee's birthday costume party the next day, devastated Elle tells Lee she loves him and always wants to be close to him. Reminding him that they made up their rules when they were six years old and could not have accounted for what's happening now, she confesses her love for Noah. If he cannot accept her and Noah's relationship, he should not be a part of her life. Lee relents and just wants Elle to be happy and agrees to help her find Noah, who is likely en route to the airport. Driving Lee's car, Elle shares her true feelings for Noah with Lee, dressed in his Batman costume, only to find out that it's actually Noah who is underneath the Batman costume. Elle is ecstatic to find out that Lee has invoked Rule #18: \\"Always be happy for your bestie's successes\\" and that Noah stayed behind for a few minutes to watch Elle blow out the candles to her birthday cake. Elle and Noah spend the following weeks together before he leaves for college. Watching him go, she is unsure if the relationship will last, but knows a part of her heart will always belong to him, and rides his motorcycle into the sunset.

In November 2016, it was announced that Netflix had purchased rights to the film, and Marcello was set to direct as well. In January 2017, Joey King and Molly Ringwald signed on to star. Filming took place in Los Angeles, California, and in Cape Town, South Africa, with scenes shot at the University of Cape Town (UCT) between January and April 2017.  Release  The film was released on May 11, 2018 on Netflix. According to Netflix, one in three viewers of the film have re- watched it, \\"which is 30 percent higher than the average movie re-watch rate on the [streaming service].\\" Deeming the film a substantial success for the service, CCO Ted Sarandos called it \\"one of the most-watched movies in the country, and maybe in the world.\\" Upon the sequel's release in July 2020, the first film was the third-most viewed on Netflix that weekend. Reception =Critical response= The Kissing Booth was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 17% based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 3.59/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"The Kissing Booth deploys every rom-com clich√© in the book with little care given to achieving any real sentiment.\\" IndieWire's Kate Erbland gave the film a \\"D\\" grade, adding that \\"Unfortunately, the high school-set rom-com is a sexist and regressive look at relationships that highlights the worst impulses of the genre.\\" Ani Bundel of NBCNews criticized the film's \\"problematic stereotyping of masculinity and relationships\\" and lack of original ideas. \\"It feels like it was written by someone who simply digested everything she was told 'romance' was supposed to be by the patriarchy, and vomited back at us. Nearly every clich√© in the film feels cribbed from another movie, like a song made completely of samples from better-known hits.\\" Despite being deemed \\"sexist\\" and \\"objectively bad\\" by several critics, The Kissing Booth was widely consumed among audiences. Netflix's CCO Ted Sarandos affirmed the film's success as a \\"hugely popular original movie\\" for the streaming service. Factors that have been cited as reasons for The Kissing Booth's success among audiences include the original novel's popularity on Wattpad, the relative lack of original romantic comedies on the platform, and the publicization of actors King and Elordi's off-screen relationship during the film's production. =Accolades= At the 2019 Kids' Choice Awards, The Kissing Booth was nominated for Favorite Movie and Joey King won Favorite Actress for her role. Sequels On February 14, 2019, a sequel, titled The Kissing Booth 2, was announced. It was released on July 24, 2020 on Netflix.

The brigade headquarters deployed to Iraq with the CFLCC and Iraq Survey Group from February 2003 to April 2004. The brigade was reactivated on November 16, 2019.https://www.usar.army.mil/News/News-Display/Article/2021356/army-reserve- chemical-brigade-reactivated-during-historic-ceremony/ The brigade perpetuated the lineage of the 100th Chemical Mortar Battalion, a unit that fought in the Italian Campaign of World War II, which was inactivated in late 1945 following the end of the war. Briefly reactivated as the reserve 455th Chemical Mortar Battalion in the late 1940s and again inactivated in the early 1950s, it became the 100th Chemical Group in 1952, and was based at Fort McClellan as a training headquarters for chemical units until its 1967 inactivation.  Origins  The brigade traced its lineage back to the 100th Chemical Battalion (Motorized), constituted in the Army of the United States on 7 June 1944 during World War II, and activated on 5 August of that year at La Fagianeria, Italy. Redesignated as the 100th Chemical Mortar Battalion on 15 November 1944, it fought in the Rome-Arno, Po Valley, and North Apennines Campaigns during the Italian Campaign, equipped with the M2 4.2 inch chemical mortar. During its service the battalion lost five soldiers killed in action. After returning to the United States following the end of the war, it was inactivated at Camp Myles Standish on 13 October 1945. The battalion was allotted to the Organized Reserve Corps on 21 October 1948 and redesignated as the 455th Chemical Mortar Battalion, before activation at Boston on 10 November of that year. Its service proved brief, as it was inactivated there on 15 June 1951. On 2 July 1952 it was again redesignated as the 100th Chemical Group (Communications Zone), a Regular Army unit, and activated on 17 July of that year at Fort McClellan, Alabama, responsible for training Chemical Corps units. In July 1957, the group's 85th Chemical Battalion rotated to West Germany as part of Operation Gyroscope, and was replaced by the 1st Chemical Battalion (Service). The latter was inactivated in December 1966, though by then the group also controlled the 2nd Chemical Battalion (Smoke Generator) and the 548th Supply and Service Battalion. It was inactivated on 24 June 1967, though it continued to serve as a provisional unit until it was formally deactivated on 28 March 1969.  Service as Chemical Brigade  The 455th Chemical Brigade was reactivated on 4 June 2000 at Fort Dix, under the command of Colonel Joseph Leonelli. Assigned to the 77th Regional Support Command, it included the 462nd Transportation Battalion at Trenton and the 479th Chemical Battalion at Fort Tilden. After the Collapse of the World Trade Center the 479th's 320th Chemical Company at Jamaica, Queens was alerted in case decontamination was necessary. On 10 February 2003 the 54-man brigade headquarters and headquarters detachment, led by Colonel Robin Byrom, was mobilized for Operation Iraqi Freedom. After deploying to Iraq, it initially supported Defense Threat Reduction Agency operations to eliminate Iraqi weapons of mass destruction while subordinated to the Combined Forces Land Component Command. Subsequently, following the end of major combat operations, it was transferred to the Iraq Survey Group (ISG), which was tasked with finding the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. During this period the unit was responsible for Camp Slayer, provided \\"convoy escort security and decontamination support for WMD teams in Iraq\\", while \\"manning positions in the ISG Survey Operations Center, Sector Control Point‚ÄìBaghdad, and Central Media Processing Center\\", along with the 450th Chemical Battalion. The brigade headquarters returned to the United States on 28 April 2004 before being released from active duty on 1 July. The 455th was inactivated on 15 September 2007 as a result of the modular reorganization of the United States Army. The 455th was chosen by Chemical Officers, BG Jim Blankenhorn and MAJ Charles Hardenstine, to be reactivated in Sloan, Nevada under the 76th Operational Response Command. The 464th Chemical Brigade and the 63rd Chemical Group were considered. Ultimately the 455th Chemical Brigades deployment to Iraq, the only Chemical Brigade to deploy into a theater of war drove the decision. The Brigade Headquarters has been reactivated since November 16th, 2019.

History On 23 May 1735 Felipe V approved the constitution of Real Academia de la Historia. The Academy's first Director Agust√≠n de Montiano y Luyando proposed to create a Diccionario hist√≥rico-cr√≠tico de Espa√±a. However, resources were limited and the Diccionario biogr√°fico espa√±ol did not get underway until the end of the twentieth century. Printed edition The Dictionary was edited by Gonzalo Anes (the then Director of the Academy), Jaime Olmedo, and Quint√≠n Aldea Vaquero. It was written over ten years by 5,000 historians. It consists of 50 volumes with 45,000 pages and 40,000 biographies of notable figures in Spanish history, from the 7th century BC to the present. The first twenty-five volumes were published in 2011 with the remaining volumes completed by 2013. Electronic edition The electronic version of the dictionary was launched formally by the King and Queen of Spain in 2018, although some material had been available online previously. Carmen Iglesias, who became director of the Real Academia de la Historia in 2014, was the historian responsible for the electronic version, which differs in some respects from the printed version which preceded it. It is intended that any errors will be corrected continuously. The printed edition contains information about living persons, whereas so far the electronic edition is restricted to deceased persons. The difficulty of writing objectively about living people was one of the criticisms of the Dictionary when it appeared. (subscription required) Another source of controversy was the treatment of Francisco Franco, who initially was not described as a dictator. His entry was revised for the online version.

Research interests Shaha's research programme is geared towards the understanding of cell death pathways and cellular defense processes in unicellular and multicellular organisms that have important bearing on designing of therapies for various diseases. Kala- azar, a neglected tropical disease remains a huge problem being endemic in certain parts of the country and is caused by the Leishmania parasite. Understanding of how parasite death occurs is important as successful killing of the parasite would reduce disease burden. The research demonstrated the ability of the Leishmania parasite to execute death phenotypes similar to metazoans and experimental evidence demonstrated the involvement of the single mitochondrion in apoptosis like death in one of the earliest eukaryotes. Host- parasite interaction studies show the involvement of Bcl-2 proteins in parasite survival. Other studies with cells having high division index like cancer cells and mammalian germ cells provides insight into the various pathways that are triggered by stress and their functional relevance in cell survival.

Augustus and Agnes Cleveland O'Dell House, also known as the Inch House, is a single family home located at 1945 Tiverton Road in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. The house was designed by architect H. Augustus O'Dell for his personal use, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. History H. Augustus O'Dell was born in 1875, in what is now Port Huron, Michigan. He started his architectural career in 1893 as a draftsman in the Port Huron office of George L. Harvey, In 1895 he moved to Detroit, working as a draftsman for Malcomson and Higginbotham, Rogers and MacFarlane, and theatre architect James M. Wood. In 1902, O'Dell established his own firm, Baxter & O'Dell, in partnership with Frank G. Baxter. The firm was successful, and O'Dell became known for his designs of apartment buildings and large suburban houses. In the late nineteenth century, this area of Bloomfield Hills started becoming suburbanized and transportation made it more accessible to Detroit. Charles Stinchfield, Sr., a wealthy timber man and president of American Radiator Company, established \\"Stonycroft,\\" a 286-acre working farm on this site. In 1925, Stinchfield's heirs platted and landscaped the farm into a real estate development. O'Dell and his wife Agnes purchased this lot, among the first to be sold. The house was constructed in 1926, and O'Dell named it the \\"Inch House\\" after the O'Dell family ancestral home in Athy, Ireland. O'Dell lived there from 1926 to 1943. Description The O'Dell House is a two-story L-shaped house with intersecting gable roofs. It has a mixture of French Eclectic and English Cottage styling, with a dominant, steep, undulating roof sheathed with textured slate. The roofline is broken by dormers with wooden windows. The front facade is made of concrete block, with a protruding entry vestibule of brick. A patio, pool house and pool are behind the house.

Today, due to its history, there is no visible evidence of the site.  Pre-Norman Conquest (1066)  The Rofft had initially been the site of an Iron Age fort encompassing about . Suggested was the continued use of the site was due to its strategic position on a flat-top promontory providing views towards Pulford. Seventh-century Welsh sources stated that Pulford was the Welsh boundary with the Kingdom of Mercia. The Rofft fort, in addition to the other nearby small forts of Caer Alyn and Y Gaer, guarded the approach to the River Alyn valley. The Rofft fort had local administrative and judicial functions for the commote of Marford.  Post-Norman Conquest  In 1071, William I gave the Earldom of Chester to Hugh d‚ÄôAvranches that included modern day Marford. Recorded in the Domesday Book (1086) is that the Norman Lord Osbern Fitz Tesso controlled the commote of Marford and Hoseley. The reason suggested for building the motte and bailey Rofft castle was a desire to widen Norman influences into the area. The bailey was calculated to be higher than the natural ground level and protected by a dry moat. Documentary evidence about the castle is vague and disputed. Stated is that in March 1140 the castle was severely damaged, and rebuilt by Madog ap Maredudd, along with the castles at Doddington, Pulford and Wrexham. Uncertainty exists if Rofft Castle was damaged and suggested is that record may instead refer to Wrexham castle, if so, making the first confirmed written reference to the Rofft in 1161‚Äì62. left An administrative task related to the castle was the collection of Tolls at the nearby Pant Olwen. The presence of the Rofft influenced the local environment. It initially controlled the medieval Mersley Park, in a subdivision known as Horsley. Religion was focused at St. Leonards chapel, the only nearby place of worship, and under the jurisdiction of the castle.  The declining influence of the Rofft  Pratt wrote the influence of the Rofft declined due to a combination of events. The completion of the stone castles, such as Dinas Bran, Llangollen by Gruffydd Maelor II, affected the significance of the areas motte and bailey castles. Wrexham had become the centre of local trade. Changes in the local politics diluted the importance of the Rofft. In 1282, the commotes of Marford, Wrexham and Yale were combined to create the Marcher Lordship of Bromfield and Yale. The Royal Bailiffs moved from the Rofft to reside at Wrexham. In 1284, when William de Warenne received the Bromfield seisin, he chose to do so at Wrexham rather than at the Rofft. In the mid-thirteenth century, the importance of the Chapel of St. Leonard lessened due to the foundation of the All Saints' Church, Gresford.  Post-14th century  alt=The View Eastwards from Marford A 1315 survey recorded a manor house on the Rofft bailey, and by 1575, Rofft Hall covered the site of the former Iron Age hill fort. In the 1840s the construction of the railway partially destroyed the Rofft earthworks. Between 1927 and 1958, gravel quarrying obliterated the Rofft site. The Rofft survives only in name as land near the Rofft is called Castle Croft. The name of the Rofft Primary School, Marford acknowledges the site. Mersley Park became associated with Holt, and latterly known as Holt Park, and in the seventeenth century disparked. The remaining traces of the park are within the local names of places such as Parkside and Lower Park. The Chapel of St. Leonard stood until the fifteenth century. The site of the chapel is unknown but remembered through the road name Pont-Y-Capel.

He sat, briefly, as a Communist member of the Reichstag (national parliament) in 1924/25. He fell out with the party leadership after he was appointed party treasurer in 1924, and investments made with party funds turned sour. There was no evidence or lasting support for initial suggestions that K√∂nig had enriched himself personally, but a significant amount of money was nevertheless lost and his influence within the fractious Communist Party was permanently diminished. During the twelve Nazi years he was involved in resistance but no details survive. It is thought that he died when he was shot, early in 1945, by Nazi paramilitaries, in Strausberg near Berlin. Artur/Arthur K√∂nig/Koenig's name is variously spelled in the different sources.  Life  Artur K√∂nig was born in Breslau (as Wroc≈Çaw was then known) into a family registered as \\"non-religious\\" (which in Germany confers certain tax advantages). After completing his mandatory schooling he worked in machine and paper factories, later also working in domestic service and as a newspaper courier. He was a dedicated autodidact, and after he had sufficiently enhanced his learning he became a book dealer. From 1904 K√∂nig engaged with the trades union movement. This was also the year in which he joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). At some point he had relocated to the industrially dynamic Ruhr region, where from 1912 he was employed in an SPD bookshop in Dortmund. The First World War broke out in July 1914: between 1916 and 1918 K√∂nig served as a soldier on the Western Front. A couple of months before the war ended, however, in September 1918 he deserted from the army and joined the pacifist Spartacus League. He participated, as a delegate from Dortmund, in the \\"founding congress\\" of the Communist Party which took place over three days in Berlin, starting on 31 December 1918. In 1920 he became party chairman for the Essen district and took a paid secretarial position with the party. During the abortive (and brief) Ruhr uprising which broke out in March 1920 he took a leading role in the Ruhr Red Army. In December 1920 the party's sixth party conference took place and sealed a merger with the left wing majority of the disintegrating Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD). This was also the conference at which K√∂nig was first elected to the party's powerful Central Committee. In August 1921 the party conference took place in Jena and he was re-elected. In 1922 he became Secretary (i.e. regional group leader) in the party's administrative district (\\"Unterbezirk\\") of Dortmund. Further advancement within the party hierarchy followed, both at regional and at national levels. The 1923 \\"Deutscher Oktober\\" (failed insurrection) did not, as had been hoped, trigger a German version of the Russian October Revolution, but it did demonstrate the intensity of revolutionary aspirations within the Communist Party of Germany. As a representative of the party's left wing from the western part of Germany, in January 1924 K√∂nig travelled to Moscow to take part in discussions with the leadership of the Communist International (Comintern) and to denounce Heinrich Brandler, a disgraced former leader of the German party who was now being blamed for the failure of the \\"Deutscher Oktober\\". At the Fifth World Congress of the Comintern, in June/July 1924, K√∂nig was elected a member of the organisation's \\"International Control Commission\\". Back in Germany, at the regional party conference for the Ruhr region in March 1924 K√∂nig delivered the main speech on behalf of the party left wing. Then in April 1924, at the ninth party conference held in Frankfurt, he was elected national party treasurer (\\"Hauptkassierer\\"). Additionally, at the General Election of May 1924, and again at the General Election of December 1924, Artur K√∂nig was elected to the Reichstag (national parliament), where he sat as a Communist Party member, representing the D√ºsseldorf electoral district (\\"Wahlkreis 22\\"). The Communist Party invested its funds in various factories and other businesses, selected to maximise financial returns. One of the companies in which the party had invested was even engaged in producing gramophone records, an investment which the party leadership would later deride as crazy, because it was obvious that the gramophone record industry would be destroyed by the rapidly emerging world of Radio broadcasting. There were naturally calls on party funds. During K√∂nig 's time as party treasurer there were unplanned additional expenses in connection with the start-up costs for the party news-sheet \\"Sichel und Hammer\\" (which was relaunched in 1925 as the Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung (\\"Workers' Illustrated Newspaper\\")).Kurt Koszyk: Deutsche Presse 1914‚Äì1945. Geschichte der deutschen Presse. Part III. Colloquium, Berlin 1972, p. 331. In 1925 it emerged that ill-judged investment/spending decisions had led to a loss of party funds assessed, initially, at 100,000 Marks. The party's \\"business dealings\\" had previously been celebrated, and when information about the losses came out, wild rumours began to circulate within the party, hinting at wild parties and embezzlement. Still in 1925, Artur K√∂nig was replaced as party treasurer and an enquiry was launched into what had happened. The scandal attracted the attention of the Comintern) which used it to try and discredit other party comrades who had fallen out of favour with the leadership, notably Werner Scholem and Ruth Fischer. In the aftermath of the affair K√∂nig was also obliged to resign his parliamentary (Reichstag) seat in November 1925. The seat was taken on by his party comrade Agnes Plum. Nevertheless, although the middle 1920s were characterised by serious party ructions and many expulsions from the party, Artur K√∂nig was not expelled from the party. The investigation evidently concluded very quickly that he had not enriched himself at the party's expense. His name continued to appear on party lists till the early 1930s. However, he never again held any important positions in the party structure. After January 1933 political activity (except in support of the Nazi Party) became illegal, and many previously active communists were arrested and/or killed by the authorities. Others managed to flee abroad. Information on Artur K√∂nig's final twelve years is sparse and based on hearsay. It is thought that he became involved in an underground antifascist resistance group in the Lusatia area. According to Robert Neddermeyer, a Reichstag and Communist Party contemporary who was also actively involved in antifascist resistance (and survived), Artur K√∂nig died when he was shot, early in 1945, by Nazi paramilitaries, in Strausberg near Berlin.

Personal life She was married to Samuel Molebatsi Lekgetha (date unknown) and had 4 children with him, namely Mokgadi Anna Lekgetha and Lennox Lekgetha. She died on 2 February 1992 in Mmabatho, Mafikeng having devoted her life in nursing education and governance.Women Marching Into the 21st Century: Wathint' Abafazi, Wathint' Imbokodo. HSRC Press, 2000. page 211http://www.bloemfonteincourant.co.za/on-this-day-in- history-14-february/ Education As a rural woman who used 'western' medicine, she regarded her role as a bridge between western and indigenous medicine. She trained for nursing at Elim Mission Hospital as well as McCord Hospital in Durban, Kwa-Zulu Natal.Anne Digby. Diversity and Division in Medicine: Health Care in South Africa from the 1800s. Peter Lang 2006.pg 271-272 Career She was appointed as a district nurse in Hammanskraal in 1944 where she became the first nurse to provide health services in the rural area. There were very few health services which were targeted at black women in rural areas at the time. Lekgetha started antenatal care services for the women in the rural area of Hammanskraal making this programme the first of its kind. She started a rural immunisation programme, which was initially only provided by doctors, making her the first nurse to roll out such a programme in the country. She placed much attention on preventative health care and health promotion through initiating clinic committees as well as voluntary health support groups. She was also involved in general comprehensive health care provision in Jubilee Hospital in Hammanskraal. She was the leader of the local branch of the Bantu Nurses Association at McCord Hospital during the 1940s. The South African Nursing Association (SANA) was racially segregated during most of Lekgetha's career. She was elected as a member of the advisory board for the Bantu people on the South African Nursing Association in 1960, making her the first chairman of the board. Soon after in 1964, she was awarded honorary membership of SANA for her devotion to the nursing profession and public. The Bophutatswana government appointed her as the Deputy Minister of Health and Social Services in November 1987. She co-founded the Baphuthutswana Nursing Association as well as the Bophuthatswana Nursing Council which further motivated her to establish the Department of Nursing Sciences at the University of Bophuthatswana. During her nursing career, her interests included primary health care, comprehensive health care and midwifery.Women Marching Into the 21st Century: Wathint' Abafazi, Wathint' Imbokodo. HSRC Press, 2000. page 211 Political Views She was quoted saying, 'You are not a politician, you work in a political milieu'. She did not believe in compromising patient care during times of protests and was against strike action. However, she often advocated for better working conditions for black nurses in South Africa. She also publicly opposed the Nursing Act (Act No. 69 of 1957) which introduced racially segregated nursing registers. However, she also believed that the racially segregated SANA would compel black nurses to establish their own knowledge systems.Susan McGann, Barbara Mortimer.

It was released for the PlayStation Vita by Idea Factory in 2016 in Japan and by Aksys Games in 2018 in North America and Europe. The player reads through the story, making choices that determine its direction, and takes the role of college student Ichiko Hanamaki, who goes to the town of Okunezato to investigate the disappearance of her brother together with her friend Hino Kagutsuchi. The game was directed and written by Tomio Kanazawa, with character designs by Chinatsu Kurahana and music by Yuki Sugiura. Although Kanazawa initially wanted to set the game in the real-life town Karuizawa, he ended up creating a fictional, crescent-shaped town based on it instead, with some features such as the main street remaining largely unaltered compared to their real-life counterparts. The game was well received by critics. Gameplay 7'scarlet is a visual novel in which the player reads through the story, and makes choices that affect the direction of the story; they need to replay the game multiple times and take different paths to uncover the whole story. The player character has a default name, but the player may change it if they wish; if they use the default name, dialogue mentioning the player character by name will be voiced. Throughout the game, items are added to the player's \\"TIPS\\" glossary, including explanations of terms and background stories for characters and locations. Plot The game follows Ichiko Hanamaki, a college student whose brother has disappeared in the town of Okunezato a year prior to the start of the game. She and her childhood friend Hino Kagutsuchi find a website discussing mysteries surrounding the town, which will host an offline meetup in the town during the summer; Ichiko and Hino go there to investigate Ichiko's brother's disappearance. Development and release alt=A 2007 daytime photograph of the Old Karuizawa Ginza Avenue in Karuizawa, Nagano in Japan 7'scarlet was developed by Otomate and Toybox Inc., and was directed and written by Deadly Premonition producer Tomio Kanazawa, with character designs by Chinatsu Kurahana, and music by Yuki Sugiura. The opening theme, \\"World's End Syndrome\\", was performed by Kaori Oda and composed by Myu; the ending themes \\"Me no Mae no Hohoemi\\", \\"Koboresou na Tsuki\\" and \\"Itoshisa o Daita Hana\\" were performed by Mao, Oda, and Haruka Shimotsuki, respectively; and the insert song \\"Lovesick\\" was performed by A-TO and Auk Zero. The town of Okunezato was based on the real-life town Karuizawa; Kanazawa had wanted to set a game in the actual Karuizawa, but was asked to make it a fictitious place, so he took artistic liberties with the location and changed it to a crescent-shaped town surrounded by forests and rivers; some specific areas remained largely unchanged, such as Okunezato's main street, based on the Old Karuizawa Ginza Avenue. The game was announced along with several other Otomate games at their Otomate Party event in 2015. It was released for the PlayStation Vita by Idea Factory in Japan on July 21, 2016, and by Aksys Games in North America and Europe on May 25, 2018. Along with Psychedelica of the Black Butterfly and Psychedelica of the Ashen Hawk, it is part of Aksys Games' \\"Summer of Mystery\\" campaign; players who purchase all three can get a set of enamel pins. The North American physical release of 7'scarlet includes a set of character cards, and the Japanese deluxe edition of the game includes postcards, pin badges, a towel, and two audio dramas. The game's original soundtrack album was released by Muzzle Duzzle Musik Allerlei on November 25, 2016. Reception Famitsu gave the game their Gold Hall of Fame award, saying that they enjoyed its mystery theme and how it was well integrated with the otome format despite how it was unusual to see the two elements combined. They also enjoyed learning more of the mystery on each new route they played through. 4Gamer.net enjoyed the music, saying that they liked the sense of mystery, and that the song \\"Through the Woods\\" in particular gave them goose bumps. 7'scarlet was the 16th best selling game in Japan during its debut week, selling 3,128 copies.
