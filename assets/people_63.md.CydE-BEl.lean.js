Background  Born in Behbahan, Haji Rais belonged to a wealthy family of merchants that traded on the coastal areas of the Persian Gulf and eventually established trade connections with India, under the British Raj. A Consular official described him as an ‚Äòexcessively acute‚Äô man and ‚Äòa born diplomatist‚Äô. By 1904 he was about 50 years old, ‚Äòweak and fragile‚Äô and had lived in Muhammareh for 20 years.

Official roles and duties  When in June 1897, Khaz‚Äôal Khan Ibn Haji Jabir Khan succeeded his brother Miz'al as the new Sheikh of Mohammerah, the former duly sent his right-hand man, Haji Rais, to the Persian capital to elicit official recognition. Haji Rais also reached out to the British Legation, whereby they responded that they would do all they could to \\"protect the Shaikh‚Äôs interests, and [that] the Shaikh should in return do all he can to further British interests now and in the future\\". Eleanor Franklin Egan described him as a wonderful man about five feet five, that made up in loftiness of intelligence what he lacks in physical stature. She further added, that he was the commanding intellect which has stood at the Sheikh‚Äôs right hand for more years than most people can remember. Haji Rais was, for a brief period, the President of the Khazaliah school in Mohammerah.

Sergey died on 9 January 1945 in a Nazi concentration camp located in Neuengamme. He was brother to Vladimir Nabokov.  Life  = Russia = Sergey was born into the noble Nabokov family. His father was the noted Russian lawyer and statesman Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov. His mother, Elena Ivanovna, was the daughter of philanthropist Ivan Rukavishnikov. Sergey was the second son, being 11 months younger than Vladimir. Unlike his older brother, Sergey was a shy, awkward boy. He had poor eyesight and a severe stutter. He developed a strong passion for music around the age of ten, playing fragments of piano operas and going to concerts with his father. He talked little with Vladimir. The Nabokov children in 1918 (from left to right): Vladimir, Kirill, Olga, Sergey and Elena Sergey spent the first years of his life at the Nabokov house on Bolshoy Morska Street in Saint Petersburg, and at the family's suburban estate in Vyra, near Siversky. He began his education at Tenishevski's school, where he studied for five years, and then transferred to the First Junior High School. When Sergey was 15, Vladimir found a page of his diary and gave it to his tutor, who later passed the page to the father. It implied that Sergey was homosexual. The family reacted relatively calmly to this fact, partly because Sergey's uncles Konstantin Nabokov and Vasiliy Rukavishnikov were homosexuals. According to Brian Boyd, delayed remorse provoked the intensiveness with which Vladimir Nabokov later protected his own private life. Sergey gradually became more alienated in family relations. The father, being a progressive liberal politician, ran a campaign aimed at abolishing criminal prosecution of homosexuals. The October Revolution forced the Nabokovs to move to the Crimea. On November 2 (O.S.; 15 N.S.) 1917, Sergey and Vladimir Nabokov left Saint Petersburg forever in the sleeping car of the train to Simferopol. During their journey, soldiers escaping the front entered the carriage. According to Vladimir, his brother \\"a first-rate actor\\",¬´a first rate actor¬ª ‚Äì Nabokov, Vladimir Conclusive evidence.

In April 1919, before the beginning of Bolshevik rule, the Nabokov family left Russia forever and settled in Berlin. = Europe = , Matrei, East Tyrol Sergey and Vladimir studied Russian and French philology at Trinity College, Cambridge. They spent much time together, often playing tennis. The brothers were quite different, with Sergey being tall, slim, blond, with pink skin, with an elegant aesthetic, and cheerful but sensitive. After graduating in 1922, the brothers returned to their family in Berlin. Both tried to work in the banking sector, but were unable to do such work. Vladimir worked for only several hours total, and Sergey lasted a week. In Berlin, the brothers split up. Given the atmosphere of tolerance in Germany at the time, Sergey behaved freely, participating actively in the gay community and meeting Magnus Hirschfeld. He soon moved to Paris, where he lived in the tiny apartment of his immigrant friend Pavel Tchelitchew and Pavel's lover Allen Tanner, who introduced him to the gay cultural elite of Paris, such as Jean Cocteau, Sergei Diagilev, Virgil Thomson, and Gertrude Stein. From 1924‚Äì1926 he was romantically involved with a Polish painter living in Paris, J√≥zef Czapski; the relationship ended when Czapski, who was suffering from typhus, went to London for treatment. According to contemporaries, Sergey Nabokov was a nice, intelligent young man who spoke four languages fluently, knew French and Russian poetry, and loved music and theater, which made him very different from his brother.

In the Paris of the late 1920s, Sergey met Hermann Thieme, the son of the Austrian insurance tycoon Carl Thieme, who became the love of his life. The two moved to Weissenstein Castle, Matrei in East Tyrol. In the 1930s, they traveled together around Europe. In the early 1930s, relations with his brother Vladimir got better: Sergey even taught him German. = Arrest and death = In 1936, Vladimir's wife, Vera, was dismissed from work as a result of the intensification of the anti-Semitic campaign in Germany. In 1937, the Nabokovs left Germany and fled to France. In May 1940, the family left Paris and came to the United States on the last New York voyage of the ocean liner . Sergey, not knowing his brother had left, arrived in Paris and found the apartment empty. He decided to stay in the country with his lover. However, considering the criminal proceedings against homosexual men, they decided to meet rarely so as not to arouse suspicion. Sergey continued to work as a translator in Berlin. Despite precautionary measures, Sergey was arrested by the Gestapo in 1941 on charges of having homosexual contacts forbidden by paragraph 175 of the German Penal Code. After five months in prison, he was released due to lack of evidence, thanks to the efforts of his cousin Oni (Sofia Dmitrievna Fazold, n√©e Nabokova, 1899‚Äì1982, elder sister of the composer Nicolas Nabokov–°–≤—è–∑–∏ —Å–µ–º–µ–π –°–ª—É—á–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏ –ù–∞–±–æ–∫–æ–≤—ã—Ö) and was put under observation.

On January 9, 1945, four months before the liberation of the concentration camp, Sergey Nabokov died of dysentery and hunger. Ivan Nabokov (the son Nicolas Nabokov and cousin of Vladimir and Sergey) remembered that, after the war, people called the family to tell them of Sergey's brave behavior in the camp. Hermann Thieme was also arrested, and sent to the front in Africa. At the end of the war, he lived in his castle, taking care of his disabled sister, and died in 1972.  Legacy  = Sergey's death and Vladimir's germanophobia = During the war, Vladimir Nabokov thought that Sergey was living safely in Hermann's castle. In autumn 1945, he had a dream in which Sergey died on a bunk in a concentration camp. The next day he received a letter from his younger brother Kirill, informing him of the death of Sergey. Sergey's death undoubtedly strengthened Nabokov's Germanophobia, which had taken root in the late 1930s. For example, in a letter of December 21, 1945, he informs the pastor of Christ Church, Cambridge‚ÄîGardiner M. Day‚Äîthat his 11-year-old son Dmitry would not participate in the collection of clothes for German children. \\"I consider that every item of food and clothing given the Germans must necessarily be taken from our allies‚Ä¶ When I have choose between giving for a Greek, Czech, French, Belgian, Chinese, Dutch, Norwegian, Russian, Jewish or German child, I shall not choose the latter one\\".Nabokov, Vladimir Selected letters 1940‚Äì1977. San Diego, NY, L.: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. 1989. P. 63. After returning to Europe, Nabokov never visited Germany, despite having lived there for 15 years.Zimmer Dieter E.

According to Brian Boyd, Vladimir was tormented by the thought that he did not love his brother enough, and there was a long history of inattentiveness, mindless ridicule, and neglect. In 1945, Nabokov wrote, in a letter to E. Wilson: \\"The Germans sent my second brother to one of the worst concentration camps (near Hamburg), where he disappeared. This message struck me because in my opinion Sergey was the last person who, in my opinion, could have been arrested (for his \\"Anglo- Saxon sympathies\\"): a harmless, idle, touching person...\\" Some literary scholars point to the possibility of Sergey Nabokov's character informing the main characters of the novels The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, Bend Sinister, and Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle. Others point to the complex interactions of the gay character Kinbote in the novel Pale Fire. The death of his brother and other war tragedies led Nabokov to reflect deeply on the nature of evil in the world, while also attempting to distance himself from terrible events. While he was writing Lolita, Vladimir Nabokov began to write a novel about conjoined twins, one of whom was in love with the other, but he abandoned this idea in favor of Lolita. = Other works = In the film Mademoiselle O (1993), based on the autobiographical works of Vladimir Nabokov, the role of Sergey is played by Grigory Klalov. According to critics, the film is partly a tribute to Sergey. His image is compared with the image of the governess \\"Mademoiselle\\": after many years the author feels guilty and regrets both. In the movie, Sergey is portrayed as a nice, emotional younger brother, in sharp contrast to the cold and distant older brother. Sergey's life is a topic of a fictionalized novel The Unreal Life of Sergey Nabokov by Paul Russell.

Publishing history Unlikely Stories, Mostly was released as a Canongate hardback in 1983; an erratum slip was inserted into the first edition that read \\"This slip has been inserted by mistake.\\" A Penguin Books paperback was issued in 1984. \\"Five Letters from an Eastern Empire\\" was issued as a stand-alone work in 1995 as part of Penguin's '60 shilling' series. A revised edition with the extra stories \\"A Unique Case\\" and \\"Inches in a Column\\" in thirteenth and fourteenth place, and a new postscript by Douglas Gifford, was released in 2010. \\"Logopandocy\\" is retitled \\"Sir Thomas's Logopandocy\\", and \\"Prometheus\\" as \\"M. Pollard's Prometheus\\" in this edition. In 2012 the entire work was included in Gray's collection Every Short Story 1951‚Äì2012. Summary Like Gray's best-known work Lanark, the book was published in the 1980s but contains work going back thirty years. *\\"The Star\\" *:A fantasy in the style of H. G. Wells about a star falling into an urban back garden. Written when Gray was a teenager, it was first published in Collins Magazine for Boys and Girls in 1951. *\\"The Spread of Ian Nicol\\" *:A riveter who begins to undergo fission. *\\"The Problem\\" *:A man has an unsatisfactory conversation with the Sun. *\\"The Cause Of Some Recent Changes\\" *:Some bored art school students dig a tunnel with terrible consequences. *\\"The Comedy of the White Dog\\" *:A sexual comedy set in the 1950s, involving a woman and a dog. *\\"The Crank That Made The Revolution\\" *:Vague McMenamy invents an enhanced duck. *\\"The Great Bear Cult\\" *:Pete Brown features in a story, written as a television script, about a 1930s cult when people dressed up as bears. *\\"The Start of the Axletree\\" *:The two \\"Axletree\\" stories are inspired by Franz Kafka's telling of the Tower of Babel story. They satirise multinationalism and capitalism. In this first part, an emperor ruling a vast circular swathe of territory conceives a building project which will be his tomb and symbol of power, and the building of which will provide a perpetual central focus for the empire. *\\"Five Letters From An Eastern Empire\\" *:The story examines the power of state artists Bohu and Tohu to make a political difference in a hierarchical society where whole sectors of the population are declared \\"unnecessary people\\". It was inspired by a line from Ezra Pound's Cantos: \\"Moping around the Emperor's court, waiting for the order-to-write\\". *\\"Logopandocy\\" *:Written in the persona of Sir Thomas Urquhart of Cromarty, who is trying to create a \\"multiverbal logopandocy\\", or universal language. *\\"Prometheus\\" *:A radical intellectual discovers the limits on his ability to change how language is used. *\\"The End of the Axletree\\" *:The second part of the \\"Axletree\\" story begins two thousand years after the events of the first. Generations of work on the building culminate in reaching the sky, which is a physical object. Competing teams of scientists from different nations try to be the first to penetrate the sky to explore what lies beyond. When they succeed, an enormous flood washes away the building and the entire civilisation. *\\"A Likely Story in a Nonmarital Setting\\" *\\"A Likely Story in a Domestic Setting\\" Critical responses Writing in the London Review of Books, Daniel Eilon contrasted the variable quality and experimental nature of the first seven stories with the next five, which he called the \\"real achievement of this work\\", and the final two shorter pieces. While suggesting the collection could have benefited from some editing out of weaker material, he described \\"Logopandocy\\" as \\"an extraordinary feat of imaginative insight.\\" Theo Tait, in The Guardian, wrote that Unlikely Stories, Mostly is Gray's best short-story collection, and is influenced by Kafka, Jonathan Swift, and Samuel Johnson's Rasselas. He considered \\"Five Letters From An Eastern Empire\\" to be the highlight of the collection. In the Financial Times, Angel Gurria-Quintana compared Gray's illustrations with those of William Blake. Gray used his epigram \\"Work as if you were living in the early days of a better nation\\" in the book. Dave Langford reviewed Unlikely Stories, Mostly for White Dwarf #55, and stated that \\"an uneven but excellent collection of fantasies and parables, mostly.\\" Unlikely Stories, Mostly won the Cheltenham Prize for Literature in 1983.

Wagner and published by Yale University Press, that aims to dispel myths surrounding the Jallianwala Bagh massacre that took place in Amritsar, India, on 13 April 1919. In the absence of any photographs of the event and with significant differences between British and Indian accounts of how many were killed and how and why it happened, Wagner examines primary sources to trace the events leading up to the massacre and then discusses its aftermath. According to Wagner, the background to the massacre starts with the Indian rebellion of 1857 and the subsequent British fear of a recurrence. By 1919, Indians aspired to greater self-governance, a wish frustrated by the proposals of the Rowlatt Act. The result was Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha movement, which persuaded Indians to pursue nonviolent resistance to the British. Fearing another 1857, events in Amritsar unfolded into Indian political agitation, the arrest of two key Indian political leaders, and British panic. Then came General Dyer's action towards a large peaceful crowd and the killings at Jallianwalla Bagh. British authorities responded with martial law and the arrest and torture of a number of Indians in Amritsar. Contrary to a number of widely held beliefs, Wagners research reveals an alternative number of how many were killed in the massacre, how many were found in the well and an account of why General Dyer acted as he did. The book was released in 2019, the 100th anniversary of the massacre, and triggered responses in a number of publications including The Hindustan Times, The Telegraph and the London Review of Books. Amongst the reviewers have been Sathnam Sanghera, Andrew Lycett, Tunku Varadarajan, Ferdinand Mount and Trevor Grundy. Publication Amritsar 1919: An Empire of Fear and the Making of a Massacre was published in 2019 by Yale University Press. It is available in hard back, paper back and an audio version narrated by Neil Shah. The author is Kim A. Wagner, who lectures on colonial India and the British Empire at Queen Mary, University of London. He previously authored The Skull of Alum Bheg: The Life and Death of a Rebel of 1857 and Thuggee. The book has 360 pages, 26 black and white illustrations, four maps and 12 chapters preceded by an introduction and a section on acknowledgements. Following the twelfth chapter is a conclusion and epilogue. Summary Wagner explains that \\"the Amritsar Massacre isn‚Äôt understood very well\\", particularly in the absence of any photographs of the 13 April 1919 and with a significant variation in British and Indian accounts of how many were killed and how and why it happened. In his book, he examines primary sources to trace the events leading up to the massacre and discusses its aftermath. =Beginning= The book begins with a scene from Richard Attenborough‚Äôs 1982 film Gandhi, what Wagner cites as the most popular depiction of the Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre and ‚Äúhow many people today think of what was arguably the bloodiest massacre in the history of the British Empire‚Äù. =Events= According to Wagner, understanding the massacre requires beginning with the Indian rebellion of 1857. In 1919, the continuing fear of a revolution led to the proposal of the suppressive Rowlatt Act which would give the British powers to quash any political agitation, and contradicted the simultaneous British promises with the Indian National Congress to give greater involvement to Indians in government. Mahatma Gandhi responded by proposing that all Indians oppose the Act and make a Satyagraha pledge, a promise to resist without using violence. The subsequent call for general strikes in late March 1919 then led to the arrest of two local Indian leaders. On 10 April 1919, upon hearing of the arrests, a crowd of Indians issued a petition for the release of their leaders. When British officials panicked and fired in reaction to seeing the approaching crowd, riots erupted. On that day, Wagner explained, ‚ÄúEuropean civilians had been killed by Indian rioters, and white women had been attacked by brown men‚Äù, for the first time since 1857. The British subsequently banned all future gatherings. However, the ban was not widely acknowledged and ‚Äúmany either unaware of the proclamation or not believing that the British would actually resort to violence, proceeded to announce a meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh that would take place on April 13, 1919‚Äù. =Jallianwala Bagh= The crowd at Jallianwalla Bagh was composed of mainly men and many from out of town, making up to 20,000 people, who had mostly come to celebrate a religious festival. Speeches focussed on the Rowlatt Act, the call to release the two arrested local Indian leaders, and effects on Indians of the First World War. In Wagner's words \\"on the 13th of April, 1919, there was nobody in Jallianwala Bagh who thought about independence. They were not heroic freedom fighters. They still had an abiding belief in the ultimate justice of the Raj, and they still thought of the British government as being the arbiter of justice\\". When General Dyer arrived \\"he was overwhelmed by the sheer size of the gathering that he had walked in on\\" and assumed it was a rebellion. Wagner explains that the British response was of \\"racialized fear and violent suppression\\". Afterwards, there was no British help with removing the dead or medical assistance for the injured. Instead, the British authorities imposed curfews, a crawling order and martial law and those suspected of being involved in the 10 April riots were arrested and tortured. British censorship ensured suppression of the details of the Amritsar troubles and the massacre, until October 1919. In July 1920, the matter was discussed in the House of Commons. Some noted the ‚Äúun-English‚Äù nature of what happened and took his actions as a \\"blemish on an otherwise untarnished British rule\\". Others saw Dyer's actions as necessary. =Dispelling myths= Using primary sources to gather evidence, Wagner has clarified that the book aims to dispel a number of myths surrounding the events of the massacre in Amritsar on 13 April 1919. Contrary to a number of widely held beliefs, Wagner's research reveals 500 to 600 is a more likely ‚Äúplausible estimate‚Äù of the number killed at the Bagh on 13 April 1919, and that ‚Äúeyewitness accounts recall only one or two bodies as having been recovered from the well inside the park‚Äù. That number, however, he says, does not \\"actually change the enormity of what happened\\". Response In 2019, coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the massacre at Jallianwalla Bagh, the book triggered responses in a number of publications including The Spectator by William Dalrymple, who noted that Wagner had used extensive primary sources in his research and \\"almost every sentence is footnoted ‚Äî gets as close as we are ever likely to get to the truth of what happened in Jallianwalla Bagh. In the process, he demolishes a large number of myths that have grown up around the event, both imperial and nationalist\\". Andrew Lycett, writing in The Telegraph, described the book as having skilfully mapped out the events. Reporting in The Times, Tunku Varadarajan agreed with Wagner that the book is a \\"a microhistory of a global event\\", aimed at neither those with \\"Raj nostalgia or Indian Nationalism\\". These responses were also supported by John Newsinger. However, Newsinger, with regards to the fear of another 1857, pointed out \\"one disagreement with Wagner's discussion of this is that on occasions it [the book] seems to suggest that the massacre was the result of a misunderstanding, that if the British had not been so obsessed with the events of the 1850s then the massacre might never have taken place\\". Trevor Grundy recommended the book be taught at schools and colleges. Ferdinand Mount in the London Review of Books, noted that General Dyer's evidence is quoted at length in the book. Both Grundy and Mount compared Amritsar 1919 with Nick Lloyd's The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story of One Fateful Day (2011) and with Nigel Collett's The Butcher of Amritsar (2005). Mount argued that Wagner had underplayed the personality of General Dyer, portraying him as \\"nothing exceptional ... and nothing extraordinary\\", instead emphasising that it was \\"brutality\\" in general that was the \\"driving principle of the Raj\\" rather than the personality of individuals. Wagner responded to Mount's view that \\"Dyer and the massacre were unique\\" and that the massacre \\"was all down to the personality of one officer\\", by citing the other brutal incidents mentioned by Mount \\"in which British officers in India from 1857 onward resorted to exemplary and indiscriminate massacres\\", such as those ordered by Hector Munro, Frederick Cooper and General James Neill. Amritsar 1919 has also been reviewed along with other books revolved around the massacre, including Anita Anand's The Patient Assassin. Reviews also appeared in The Hindustan Times, and other commentators have included Sathnam Sanghera.

The case was being litigated in a state appeals court, but it was thought that the conservative-dominated Wisconsin Supreme Court would be likely to support Malloy's ruling. Ozaukee County is heavily Republican, having voted for a Democratic presidential candidate only once after 1936 when it voted for Lyndon Johnson in 1964. The purge was felt to be intentionally targeting voters living in the cities of Madison, and Milwaukee, and college towns, which all exhibit Democratic voting strength. Two of the three plaintiffs in the case heard by Malloy were significant contributors to state Republican party candidates' campaigns, including former state representative and senator, David W.

Early life and education Adolf Cornelius van Hemert Engert was born in Vienna on New Year's Eve 1887, to a Russian citizen father and a Hungarian Jewish mother. His father, John Cornelius Engert, a trader by profession, was of Dutch origin; he died within a year, leaving his mother, Irma Babetz, to raise him in Austria- Hungary. As his granddaughter, Jane, would later state, however, Engert had a habit of \\"trying to purge all records and accounts that conflicted with the [...] identity he was trying to create\\": by sixteen, after attending gymnasium in Zurich, Engert's given name was spelled Adolph. That was the name under which he and his mother, a physician, emigrated to the United States in 1904, on the SS Kaiser Wilhelm II; he would later claim that he had been brought to the United States as a child. As Engert had only attended gymnasium for three years, he claimed to have attended Ferndale High School in California for one year, 1905, though Ferndale had no graduating class until 1906. Nevertheless, he matriculated into the University of California system, graduating from Berkeley with a Bachelor of Letters in 1908, and his master's (again, in letters) the next year. Though his professor of Slavic languages, George Rapall Noyes, would later describe him as \\"[t]he best student of those early years [of teaching]\\" and a \\"youth of many talents\\", Jane Engert would describe her grandfather's academic performance as \\"not at all distinguished\\", though \\"decent enough\\". He then proceeded to study law and teach until 1911, when he took the Le Conte Memorial Fellowship then offered by the University to study for a year at Harvard University, where he befriended A. Lawrence Lowell, the President of Harvard University at the time. Although he left his heart in San Francisco, Engert would modify his background as it suited him throughout his life: to The New York Times and other newspapers, he was of \\"Dutch parentage\\"; to others, he presented himself as having German relatives, or English and Dutch parentage. Indeed, though it was preserved in federal records, including his naturalization papers in 1910, by the time of his entry into graduate school, Engert had dropped his misspelled first name. All the same, in 1912, when Engert began his service in the American diplomatic corps, he declared his state of residence to be California and his name to be \\"Adolph Cornelius\\". Only in 1924 was he finally able to remove his first name from State Department records. Early career In March 1912, Engert began his career as a student interpreter in Constantinople; after becoming a full-fledged interpreter, he would become vice consul there two years later. As Engert himself would later note: he had a \\"Foreign Service career that went from one calamity to another‚Äîand was always exciting.\\" Indeed, he would have the misfortune of serving as vice-consul during World War I, during which he witnessed the sinking of the Mesudiye by a British submarine. He later struck up an acquaintance with the British sailor commanding the submarine during the attack, Norman Douglas Holbrook. After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Engert returned to the newly-established state of Turkey, where he continued to serve in the consulate in Constantinople as vice-consul; he later became consul. Interwar years In the early 1920s, Engert briefly served in Iran as acting U.S. minister; as he was proceeding to his post, he happened to witness the Iraqi revolt of 1920 against Arnold Wilson. During his time in Iran, before and after the 1921 Persian coup d'√©tat, he catalogued the rise of Reza Shah. In 1922, upon leaving his Persian post, Engert became the first U.S. diplomat to travel through Afghanistan, ostensibly to search for business opportunities through oil drilling. He also successfully convinced Amanullah Khan to allow Lowell Thomas and David Wooster King through as well. Thomas would later write Beyond Khyber Pass from this experience, and Engert a report for the State Department; Thomas's book was a popular success, as was Engert's report (though, admittedly, in different circumstances). The former would be forgotten; the latter used even into the twentieth century by Harry S. Truman. Engert later served at The Hague, in Peking, and in Latin America. Ethiopia In the summer of 1935, Engert was assigned to Addis Ababa, to serve as the United States charg√© d'affaires there; he was received by Emperor Haile Selassie in August. The Second Italo-Ethiopian War began in October, and, during the war, Engert attempted to protect Foreign Service personnel with bomb shelters and communications systems. As the war raged in Ethiopia, Engert was promoted to minister resident in late January 1936; the Senate confirmed his promotion a few days later. The conclusion of the Second Italo- Ethiopian War began in May 1936, with the Italian capture of Addis Ababa. Despite Engert's attempts to protect American personnel, the intervening days between the flight of the Emperor on May 2, the immediate collapse of civil order, and the Italian march toward Addis Ababa left his charges vulnerable: Engert, his wife, and the rest of the legation staff, along with Greek civilians and American journalists, came under attack from Ethiopian bandits in the attack on the United States embassy in Addis Ababa. For several tense days, beginning on May 2, the American legation was repeatedly assaulted with gunfire, while looting and disorder spread throughout the city. The diplomatic staff managed to harm at least one attacker, but the attacks only abated with the Italian occupation of the capital on May 5, 1936. A few days later, President Roosevelt promoted Engert for his heroism. Even though he now lived in an occupied city, through the early half of 1937, Engert remained at his post, sheltering refugees during the events of Yekatit 12, where the Italian occupiers massacred thousands of Addis Ababa residents; he also attempted to restrain them on multiple occasions. In March 1937, Engert finally left Ethiopia; his post was terminated a few weeks later. Iran Engert returned to Iran in June 1937, this time as charg√© d'affaires (in the modern sense). This time, his job was to help restore diplomatic relations, which had been severed the year before over issues regarding newspaper coverage and a speeding incident. Engert was ultimately successful in this duty. He was also able to document Iran's relations with the Axis powers and the Allies at the beginning of World War II. Additionally, Engert offered his opinion on the waning years of Reza Shah's regime: repressive and stifling in its lack of political debate, floundering in its meager attempts at a census, yet courageous in introducing mandatory unveiling of women. As the war continued, Engert also noted the impact of German victories early on, the closeness of the Shah to the Germans, the Russian pressure on the government of Iran, and Iranian steps to shake free from British influence. His mission complete, Engert was replaced with Louis G. Dreyfus in December 1940. Afghanistan In 1941, whilst serving in Beirut, Engert witnessed the Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign, as Vichy France requested that he mediate ceasefire negotiations which were promptly rejected by the British; ultimately, the Allies emerged victorious in the region. In May 1942, though still in Beirut, Engert was nominated as the United States Minister to Afghanistan; he took up his post later that year. During his time in Afghanistan, Engert was instrumental in the opening of the Afghan economy to the world, and created opportunities for economic development, which, in the words of Leon B. Poullada, were later \\"wasted through ignorance, apathy, and bumbling diplomacy\\". After returning to the United States, Engert retired from the State Department at the end of the year; as the Foreign Service Journal noted, he retired effective January 1, 1946. Later work Immediately after his retirement, Engert joined the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration as a diplomat, heading a mission to Turkey in March 1946. Engert was a founding member of American Friends of the Middle East in 1951, serving as secretary-treasurer. Later, he joined the World Bank and also lectured at various universities. Personal life After a courtship of more than two years, Engert married Sara Morrison Cunningham on December 16, 1922, at St. Luke's Church in San Francisco. Cunningham was a socialite, amateur bookbinder (and life member of the Guild of Book Workers), and former nurse during World War I, for which she had received the Medal of French Gratitude. Sara would join her husband at his posts, most famously at Addis Ababa, for which she was later nominated for a Congressional Medal of Honor by Edith Nourse Rogers for her actions during the embassy attack. Ultimately, Sara predeceased Cornelius on July 14, 1972, while on vacation in Brussels. The couple had two children, Roderick (1925-2018), a military historian with the United States Army; and Sheila. Roderick's daughter, Jane, would go on to write a biography about her grandfather. Later life In January 1981, at the age of 93, Engert reminisced about his State Department years with colleagues, all the while claiming he was 95, in front of a Washington Post reporter. Cornelius van Hemert Engert died on May 12, 1985, at his son's home. His papers are located at the Lauinger Library, a part of the Georgetown University Library.

It was the first Loyalist bombing in the Republic of Ireland during The Troubles. Background In March and April 1969 the UVF and Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV) carried out a number of sabotage bombings in & around Belfast and blamed them on the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in an attempt to get rid of the current Northern Ireland Stormont government who hardline Loyalists felt was too liberal towards Irish nationalism . Bombing The attack took place on 5 August 1969 at 1:30 am at the RT√â studios. The blast was heard over a wide area of Dublin city, nobody was injured. The bomb is believed to have been planted at the rear wall of the studio building and not much structural damage was done to the building, except for the shattering of glass panels. Later that morning all Irish daily newspapers had front-page coverage of the blast. Aftermath This was the start of a Loyalist campaign of bombings in the Republic of Ireland that would continue until the mid 1970s, with the deadliest being the Dublin and Monaghan bombings which killed 34.

The statement added: \\"so long as the threats from √âire continue, so long will the volunteers of Ulster's people's army strike at targets in Southern Ireland\\".

Lac Hocquart is located in the unorganized territory of Lac-Achouakan, in the Lac-Saint-Jean-Est Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of the Saguenay- Lac-Saint-Jean, in the province of Quebec, in Canada. This lake is located in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. This small valley is served indirectly by the route 169 and a few secondary routes for forestry, recreational tourism activities.Open Street Map - Accessed January 31, 2019 Forestry is the main economic activity in the sector; recreotourism activities, in second. The surface of Lake Hocquart is usually frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March, but safe circulation on the ice is generally made from mid- December to mid-March.  Geography  The main watersheds near Lake Hocquart are: * north side: Pika Lake, Pika River, Custeau Lake, Scott Lake, Clarence- Gagnon Lake, Pikauba River; * east side: Gobeil stream, Gobeil lake, rivi√®re aux Canots Est; * south side: Lac Larivi√®re, Lac du Panache, rivi√®re aux Canots; * west side: Pika lake, Neptune Lake, Pluto Lake, Cadieux Lake, Audubon Lake, Raquette Creek, √âcluse Creek, Sancto Creek, Rivi√®re aux √âcorces. Hocquart Lake is in the shape of a pallet hat, a width of and an altitude of . This lake is mainly fed by the Pika River (coming from the west), by the Gobeil stream (coming from the east) and by the outlet (coming from the south) of Lac Larivi√®re. The mouth of this lake is located at: * north-east of Pika Lake; * north of Lac du Panache (slope of the Rivi√®re aux Canots); * southeast of Lac Morin; * north-west of the confluence of the Rivi√®re aux Canots and Rivi√®re aux Canots Est; * southwest of route 169; * south of the confluence of the Hocquart river and the Pikauba River; * east of the Rivi√®re aux √âcorces. From the mouth of Lake Hocquart, the current follows the course of the Pika River consecutively on to the north, the course of the Pikauba River on north to the confluence with Kenogami Lake; it crosses this lake on north-east to Barrage de Portage-des-Roches; the course of the Chicoutimi River on to the east, then the northeast and the course of the Saguenay River on east to Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.  Toponymy  This toponym evokes the life work of Gilles Hocquart (1694-1783), born in Mortagne- au-Perche (France). After having been controller of the port of Rochefort, he came in 1729 to settle in Quebec (city), as authorizing commissioner and interim intendant of New France, in order to replace Claude -Thomas Dupuy; he was confirmed in his functions in 1731. In about twenty years, Gilles Hocquart advanced settlement and agriculture, notably by granting seigneuries in the region of lac Champlain and in Nouvelle-Beauce. He ensured the completion of chemin du Roi, on the left bank of St. Lawrence River, in addition to encouraging shipbuilding, export development, industrial production at Forges du Saint-Maurice, while maintaining a fairly good balance in public finances. Returning to France in 1748, he was first, until 1763, steward of the port of Brest and, as such, he remained in contact with the colony by helping several Acadians deported to establishing themselves in France and ensuring the fitting out of ships bound for Quebec (city) during the Seven Years' War. Gilles Hocquart was appointed State Councilor in 1764 and, until his death, he was entrusted with the stewardship of the Navy classes. One of his main achievements was the construction of a depot at the Intendant's palace in Quebec (city), where all of the colony's timed registers and documents are stored. Despite the refusal of the king of France, Gilles Hocquart arranged for this place to keep the official documents of the colony in a safe place. Several historians of French Canada emphasize that his stubbornness in front of the king would have made it possible to preserve a substantial part of the archives written in the XVIIth and XVIIIth centuries. The toponym \\"Lac Hocquart\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968, by the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec.

The album is noted for its comic effects and has been described as one of the \\"weirdest\\" and most novel releases of its type.  Description  The album came about when two artists, Jeff St. Pierre and Philip Antoniades, found themselves bored one evening at the office and began creating Christmas music out of rubber bands, staplers, tape and other office supplies to hand. After entertaining themselves through the night with this diversion, they forwarded the results as a \\"seasonal thank you\\" to friends and associates. The recording was sufficiently well received that Artist Development Associates of Framingham, Massachusetts, decided to release it as a CD, under the title A Rubber Band Christmas, with St. Pierre and Antoniades going by the name \\"The Rubberband Band\\". The CD was re-released on October 24, 2000. The album's fourteen tracks typically feature a rubber band twanging out the melody, while a ruler struck at different lengths adds a bass accompaniment. Rhythm is sometimes supplied through the use of \\"quickly- yanked frosty tape\\". The tracks featured are a selection of traditional and popular Christmas carols and ballads, with the word \\"rubber\\" substituted at some point in the title, yielding names such as \\"Rubber Bells\\" (for Jingle Bells), \\"Rudolph the Rubber-nosed Reindeer\\" (Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer) and \\"Feliz Rubberdad\\" (Feliz Navidad), etc.  Reception  AllMusic states that in spite of the unusual instrumentation, the tracks are \\"still recognizable asand a whole lot sillier thanthe original carols.\\" The reviewer concludes that while the 14 tracks \\"may be too much of a good thing\\", the release constitutes \\"easily the most novel holiday novelty album in a long while. It must be heard to be believed.\\" Scott Frampton of CMJ New Music Monthly wrote that the album would have strong appeal to \\"aficionados of the pop-culturally weird\\". Kyle Brown of Rubber and Plastic News wrote that \\"The snaps and twangs aren't always pitch-perfect, but a lot of spirit comes through. Even the off notes sometimes sound catchy in new and interesting ways.\\" Canadian broadcaster and columnist MC Gilles included the album at number three in a list of his five top Christmas novelty albums, describing it as \\"unbearable, but nice.\\" Brian Boyd of the Irish Times included the album at number four on a list of \\"5 weirdest albums of all time\\", describing it as \\"a unique listening experience ...

Some critics noted that these punitive sanctions are likely to backfire or have unintended consequences; i.e., instead of impeding or curtailing the Syrian government, it will increase its authority, as ordinary Syrian people will now have less economic resources due to these sanctions, and will need to rely on the Syrian government and its economic allies and projects even more.https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/12/29/assad-is-growing- stronger-under-trumps-nonexistent-syria-policy/ Assad is growing stronger under Trump‚Äôs nonexistent Syria policy, Washington Post.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-sanctions/long- reach-of-u-s-sanctions-hits-syria-reconstruction-idUSKCN1LI06Z Long reach of U.S. sanctions hits Syria reconstruction, Angus McDowall, Sept 2018. Critics said that such economic sanctions have little realistic chance of promoting real reform and democracy; their impact on the political ruling class will be limited, while they will likely affect ordinary Syrians disproportionately.

The Apica River flows through a narrow, steep valley. Visitors can admire the panorama from a rest area located a few kilometers north of the route 169 bridge over it. This river turns out to be the outlet of a series of small aligned lakes, located to the south, Lake Micoine constituting its head. At the end of the route, the Apica river flows at the foot of Apica mountain, culminating at . The lake of the same name is located to the southwest of Mount-Apica; however, this lake is integrated into the watershed of the rivi√®re aux √âcorces. The upper part of the Apica valley is accessible by the route 169 (route d'Iberville); other secondary forest roads have been developed in the sector for forestry and recreational tourism activities. Forestry is the primary economic activity in the sector; recreational tourism, second. The surface of the Apica River is usually frozen from late November to early April, however safe circulation on the ice is generally from mid-December to late March.  Geography  The Apica River intersects the route 169 connecting Quebec (city) to Lac Saint-Jean, halfway between Jacques-Cartier Lake and the northwest limit of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. The main watersheds adjacent to the Apica River are: * north side: Pikauba River, F√©lix stream, Damasse stream, Suzor C√¥t√© lake, Petite rivi√®re Pikauba; * east side: Pikauba River, Lac Godin, Petite rivi√®re Pikauba, Cyriac River; * south side: Mignault Lake, Madeleine Creek, Pikauba River, Rivi√®re aux √âcorces North-East; * west side: Rivi√®re aux √âcorces, Lake Paris, Jacqueline Lake. The Apica River rises at the mouth of Lake Micoine (altitude: ). The mouth which is on the north shore of this head lake is located at: * south-west of a curve in the course of the Pikauba River; * east of the source of the rivi√®re aux Canots; * north-east of rivi√®re aux √âcorces North-East; * south-west of route 169; * south-east of the confluence of the Apica river and the Pikauba River; * south-east of the confluence of the rivi√®re aux Canots Est and the Rivi√®re aux Canots. From the mouth of Lake Micoine, the course of the Apica River flows over entirely in the forest zone, with a drop of , according to the following segments : * north-west crossing Mitchell Lake (altitude: ) over its full length, up to its mouth. Note: Mitchell Lake is contiguous to Micoine Lake and has a bay extending to the southeast on the west shore. A mountain (summit at ) is located on the east side; another mountain located on the peninsula forming the west bank rises to the summit at ; a third summit located south of Lac Mignault is . A breakwater is built at the mouth on the northwest bank; * towards the north-west notably by crossing Lake Lemay (length: ; altitude: ) to its mouth. Note: About 90% of the area of this lake constitutes a marsh area; * north-west, to the outlet (coming from the south-west) of Lake Dagenay; * north-west, to the outlet (coming from the south-west) of Molson Lake; * towards the north, meandering, to the outlet (coming from the northeast) of Lac du L√©don; * towards the north by forming a loop towards the east by crossing the zone of the old village of Mont-Apica, until route 169; * north, to its mouth. The Apica river flows on the west bank of the Pikauba River. This confluence is located at: * north- east of route 169; * north of the village center of Mont-Apica; * north-west of the junction of route 169 and route 175; * south-east of the confluence of the Pikauba River and Kenogami Lake; * south-west of the confluence of the Chicoutimi River and the Saguenay River; * south-east of the shore of lac Saint-Jean. From the confluence of the Apica river with the Pikauba River, the current descends successively the Pikauba river on to the northeast, then the current crosses the Kenogami Lake on north-east to Barrage de Portage-des- Roches, then follows the course of the Chicoutimi River on to the east, then the northeast, and the course of the Saguenay River on east to Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.  Toponymy  The Dictionary of Rivers and Lakes of the Province of Quebec (1914 and 1925) calls this stream \\"Upika River\\". The toponymic designation of this river appears under the spelling \\"Upica\\" on the map of the province of Quebec by Eug√®ne Tach√© (1870), in Studies by Stanislas Drapeau on the developments of the colonization of Lower Canada (1863), and in an 1850 report from the Commissioner of Crown Lands, JH Price, with the spelling \\"Upika\\". The Innu term \\"upica\\" means \\"it is constricted\\" when speaking of a watercourse. This term could also mean \\"carrying strap\\", according to an interpretation known formerly. Long used, the name \\"Upica\\" was changed in 1961 to \\"Apica\\" as was the new designation \\"Mount Apica\\".

History  The first Catholics to settle in Wake Forest were George Bolus and his wife in 1910. Soon after, the Wilkinson family moved to the area from New Orleans, becoming the second Catholic family in the town. Catholics who soon after settled in the town had to travel to Raleigh to attend mass. As more Catholics settled in the area, a traveling priest John A. Beshel, the Chaplain of the Nazareth Orphanage, occasionally celebrated mass in the living room of the home of the Bolus family, using a closet as a confessional. In 1938 St. Peter's Chapel, a Railroad chapel car built by the Catholic Extension Society of Chicago in 1892, was given to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh to use as a house of worship for Catholics in Wake Forest. The train car, which included a bedroom and kitchen for the priest, an altar, and sixty seats for congregants, was parked at the Seaboard Railroad by Bishop Eugene J. McGuinness, and was used until February 1940. In the 1930s Bishop McGuinness' cousin, the papal countess Katherine E. Price, visited Wake Forest and was surprised that the college town did not have a Catholic Church. She donated a large amount of money for the construction of a church and rectory. A plot of land was purchased at 701 South Main Street and construction began in 1939. The architect for the original church was Frank Frimmer of Tampa, Florida. The Gothic church was built using granite from the nearby town of Rolesville. The church was dedicated by Bishop McGuinness on February 25, 1940 and named after Catherine of Siena, the patron saint of Price. In 1947 Father Tevlin, the priest at St. Catherine's, built St. Eugene's Church in Wendell as a daughter parish. In 1948 John Hyland succeeded Tevlin as priest of St. Catherine's and St. Eugene's. Hyland, who was the first superior of Bishop Vincent Stanislaus Waters' Missionary Apostolate. He made Wake Forest the headquarters of the Missionary Fathers from a mobile trailer-chapel called Madonna of the Highways, located near St. Catherine's. The trailer was dedicated on May 6, 1948 by the Apostolic Delegate Amleto Giovanni Cicognani at the annual convention of the North Carolina Catholic Laymen Association in Wilmington. On August 14, 1966 a transport tractor trailer struck a power pole and trees along the front side of the church. A large marble statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was knocked into the church, destroying part of the south wall, foundation, and interior of part of the church. On September 4, 1977, the parish rectory caught on fire. On August 27, 1979 lightning struck the church bell tower, severely damaging it. In May 1987 the pastoral administrative duties were granted to Sister Joanne DiGiovanni of the Sisters of Mercy until a new priest was hired in July of that year. In 1988 the church purchased 18.625 acres of land near West Holding Avenue for $172,212.50 in order to build a larger facility. In 1997, new buildings were built on the plot on West Holding, including a parochial school. In 1999 St. Catherine's founded its second daughter parish, Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Church in Louisburg. In 2001 St. Catherine's purchased over 20 acres of land west of new property for $800,000, building a new school buildings. In 2009 the church hired the architect Jim O‚ÄôBrien and Clancy & Theys construction company to build a 33,000 square foot church in the Romanesque style, with seating for 1,700 people. The new church cost $9 million to build.

Part of the Royal Irish Army of Charles II, it was initially garrisoned around Dublin. During the 1688 Glorious Revolution the Foot Guards under their commanding officer William Dorrington stayed loyal to James II, and fought on the Jacobite side in the Williamite War in Ireland. After the 1697 Peace of Ryswick and the formal disestablishment of James‚Äôs army in exile, the Foot Guards were immediately reconstituted in French service as Dorrington‚Äôs Regiment, retaining their red coats and Saint George's Cross standard. As part of the Irish Brigade they distinguished themselves in a number of campaigns. Renamed the Regiment Roth after a subsequent colonel, Michael Roth, and later still as the Regiment Walsh, the regiment did not formally disband until 1791. Formation At the time of the Restoration, most of the 7,500-strong army under Charles II's command in Ireland was not formally regimented, remaining so until the 1670s, and contained many Cromwellian veterans of doubtful loyalty. Intending to create an effective and reliable unit for Irish service, Charles II issued the order for the Foot Guards' creation in April 1662. Leading Royalist James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormond was given the commission to raise the regiment and authority to appoint junior officers; the experienced Anglo-Irish soldier Sir William Flower was made lieutenant-colonel, while Ormonde‚Äôs son Richard Butler, 1st Earl of Arran was gazetted colonel, with captaincy of a company. Other commissions were given to members of Ormonde's circle such as Sir Nicholas Armorer and Sir John Stephens of Finglas. The regiment was initially established at 1200 men in 12 companies, plus officers; it also included a chaplain, surgeon, drum-major and 24 drummers along with a piper to the \\"King's Company\\". Many of the rank and file were raised in England, apparently to minimise Cromwellian influence, with further recruits from the ranks of the Irish ‚ÄúIndependent Companies‚Äù. Up until 1688 members of the Guards were quartered either in Dublin Castle or in the city gatehouses. Early service James Butler, Duke of Ormonde, who was given the commission to raise the Foot Guards in 1662 Under Arran, the Guards were employed largely on peacetime duties in Ireland: they were used to suppress a mutiny by other regiments in Carrickfergus in 1666, while in 1673 two companies were ordered to Chester and saw service on board ship during the Third Anglo-Dutch War. Nevertheless the regiment retained a high prestige: a Major Billingsley recorded that \\"to be a Major of the Royal Regiment of Guards is better and more honourable than to be a Lieutenant-Colonel of any other regiment\\", while the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Clarendon, wrote approvingly of their appearance on parade. For the first twenty years of its history the regiment was almost exclusively Protestant, with most of its officers drawn from the Irish Protestant gentry. However the 1685 accession of Charles‚Äôs Catholic brother James accelerated the recruitment of Catholics, particularly as officers. James‚Äôs associate Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell replaced a number of the rank and file, giving the pretext that ‚Äúthe King would have all his men young and of one size‚Äù; veteran lieutenant-colonel Sir Charles Feilding was replaced by William Dorrington, an English Catholic. Dorrington continued reforming the regiment, though Clarendon criticised him for recruiting at the Catholic shrine St James's Well, feeling it would harm relations with the Catholic community. Arran died in 1686 and his nephew James, Lord Ossory, later the 2nd Duke of Ormonde was briefly made colonel of the Guards: at the time of the Glorious Revolution, Ormonde switched his allegiance to William of Orange. He was replaced as colonel by Dorrington and the majority of the regiment stayed loyal to James, although one of its two battalions, sent to England immediately prior to William's landing, was taken prisoner. The Guards subsequently fought on the Jacobite side in the War in Ireland, including at the Siege of Derry, the Battle of the Boyne and at Aughrim, where their lieutenant-colonel William Mansfield Barker was killed. Several hundred of their number were among those permitted to leave for France after the Jacobite defeat. Following their departure, there would be no Irish Guards regiment until the formation of the Irish Guards in 1900. French service In France the regiment continued to recruit from among Irish Jacobite exiles, the so-called ‚ÄúWild Geese‚Äù, and saw further service in the Nine Years' War. The terms of the Peace of Ryswick included the disbandment of James‚Äôs former army, but the same day as the Guards regiment was broken up, 27 February 1698, it was immediately reconstituted as Dorrington's Regiment in the French Army. The regiment continued in French service in several campaigns. It fought at Malplaquet, Dettingen and Fontenoy. Dorrington ended his active service in c.1710 and died in 1718; Michael Roth, who had begun service with the Foot Guards as a lieutenant in 1686, became colonel, followed by his son Charles Edward, Comte de Roth, in 1733. It retained its prestige status, being nicknamed \\"the Pretender's body-guard\\". Elements of the regiment returned to Britain during the Jacobite Rising of 1745. Between 1766 and 1770 the regiment‚Äôs colonel was the 9th Earl of Roscommon; its last colonel was Antoine Walsh, also known as the Comte de Walsh-Serrant. In 1791, following the French Revolution, it was merged into the 92nd Regiment of the French Army. The latter, today based in Clermont-Ferrand, is considered the last French regiment to descend directly from the regiments of the Irish Brigade.The 92nd Infantry Regiment, Embassy of France in Dublin Uniform and colours Throughout most of its existence, even in French service, the regiment was issued with red coats with blue facings. Its colours, a Saint George's Cross with a central crown surmounted with a crowned lion, reflected its original status as a Guards regiment of the King of England.

Memorial plaque at Mirbach's house, Alleestra√üe 10, in Potsdam Maimi von Mirbach came from an old noble family. Her father, the merchant Wilhelm Freiherr von Mirbach (1858-1914) was a brother of the Prussian lieutenant general and court official Ernst von Mirbach (1844-1925). Through her mother Carmen Laura, n√©e von Bary (1876-1938), Maimi von Mirbach was directly related to Cornelio Saavedra, the first president of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata.Kurt Metschies: Mirbach, Maria Celina Gabrielle Antoinette (Maimi) Freiin v . In: Friedrich Beck (Hrsg.): Brandenburgisches Biographisches Lexikon. Verlag f√ºr Berlin-Brandenburg, Potsdam 2002, . S. 284 In this cosmopolitan and international parental home, she enjoyed a Christian-liberal education with a strong musical orientation. In 1914, the family had to leave Belgium within 24 hours of the beginning of the First World War, moving to Potsdam. Shaped by her experience as a member of a minority, Maimi von Mirbach turned early to people who needed help. Already in the 1920s, she recognized the nationalistic and anti-Semitic development in Germany. After the Nazi seizure of power, she helped persecuted Jews. also following the values of the Confessing Church. She abhorred the racial ideology of the Nazis and, as a cellist, continued to cultivate numerous contacts with Jewish musicians, even though this repeatedly put her in danger. Maimi von Mirbach helped Fritz Hirschfeld, with whom she played in a private string quartet, escape in 1938. Hirschfeld, chairman of the Potsdam Labor Court for six years from 1927, was arrested after Kristallnacht and remained in Potsdam police prison for three weeks. He was only released on the condition that he would leave the country. The German authorities demanded a Reich Flight Tax of 35,000 Reichsmark and a Jewish property tax of 38,000 Reichsmark. To raise this sum, Maimi von Mirbach acquired the Hirschfelds' house and property. His \\"Aryan\\" wife Grete stayed in the house free of charge until her death in April 1941. Maimi von Mirbach gave Fritz Hirschfeld 8,000 Reichsmark in cash for his escape to Holland. In August 1942, he was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp and finally deported to Auschwitz, after which it is unknown what happened to him. Maimi von Mirbach visited him several times in the internment camp and gave him food, jewelry, and money. Von Mirbach hid Jews wanted by the Gestapo in her house several times in order to save them from deportation. At the end of 1941 she accepted the former music student Gisela Distler-Brendel, a pupil of the composer and piano teacher Ilse Fromm-Michaels, as a lodger. Gisela Distler- Brendel was a \\"first-degree half-breed\\" who was not allowed to study at a university. She also had a forbidden relationship with a gentile, from whom she expected an illegitimate child. Maimi von Mirbach kept this relationship secret from the authorities, and was thus guilty of racial disgrace under the Nuremberg Laws. After 1945, Maimi von Mirbach was subjected to many humiliations and restrictions in the Soviet occupation zone and in the early days of the GDR. In 1956, she left Potsdam and moved to Berlin-Charlottenburg. Until her death, she told students about her experiences during the period of National Socialism in schools and youth institutions. In 2005, the Potsdam Administrative Court dismissed an action brought by Maimi von Mirbach's heirs against the reassignment to Hirschfeld's daughter Aenne Dorothy Scott of the property in Klein Glienicke lawfully acquired by Fritz Hirschfeld and expropriated by the GDR.

She is a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. She has been involved in the detection of several exoplanets, including Barnard's Star b.  Early life and education  Haswell was born in Saltburn-by-the-Sea, North Yorkshire, and grew up in Dormanstown. Her father worked on an ammonia recovery plant at Imperial Chemical Industries. She became interested in space as a child, when her father told her about the Apollo astronauts as they gazed at the moon while on Redcar beach. Although she originally wanted to be an astronaut, she realised at the age of ten that this was impractical. She attended Huntcliff School where she worked towards her GCE Ordinary Levels. Whilst a student at Prior Pursglove and Stockton Sixth Form College, Haswell was interested in art, mathematics and physics, and was a fan of the television show Star Trek. One of her physics teachers was rumoured to be biased against girls, and despite Haswell achieving the highest grades possible in her A-level exams, refused to write her a reference to study physics at university. She eventually studied mathematics at the University of Oxford, but wanted to apply mathematics to the real world and became tired of abstract proofs. Haswell eventually spoke to Donald Blackwell who helped her transfer courses, and enrolled on a physics degree at University College, Oxford. During her time as an undergraduate student, Haswell was President of the Oxford University Astronomical Society and rowed in the Summer Eights. Haswell earned her doctorate at the University of Texas at Austin, where she worked on black hole binaries. She attended the Hubble Space Telescope launch in 1990. She later joined the Space Telescope Science Institute, where she worked on accretion flow and multi-wavelength observations.  Research and career  In 1994, Haswell moved to Columbia University, where she worked on black hole X-ray transients and cataclysmic variable stars. She was made a lecturer at the Barnard College where one of her students was Lauryn Hill. Haswell moved back to the United Kingdom in 1996 and was made a lecturer at the University of Sussex. Since 1999, she has been at the Open University, at first still working on black holes and accreting binary stars and switching to exoplanet research in 2003. Early work on exoplanets was not well funded, and Haswell has spoken about using second hand Canon camera lenses to make suitable telescopes. First working on accreting binary stars, and then exoplanets. In particular, Haswell studies short period exoplanets. Since 2012 she has led the Dispersed Matter Planet Project, which involves the analysis of light from nearby stars to identify which host mass- losing planets. In 2018 Haswell was part of the team that was first to identify a planet around Barnard's Star, the closest single (non-binary) star to Earth, a red dwarf star that is six light years away from Earth. Using the radial velocity method, the team discovered Barnard's Star b. The solar system around Barnard's Star touches on the edge of the Oort cloud. Barnard's Star b has a mass three times that of Earth and orbits Barnard's Star in 233 days. Haswell has predicted that the planet may have a similar surface temperature to Europa. In 2019 Haswell used the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) to discover six extraordinarily hot exoplanets (with surface temperatures between 1100 and 1800 ¬∞C). At temperatures this high the atmosphere and surface levels of the planet can be lost, and the materials disperse into a thin sheet of gas. The gas filters the light from nearby stars, which allowed Haswell and colleagues to study the chemical composition of the atmosphere of the gas sheet. The planets have masses equivalent to 2.6 times the mass of the Earth with almost half the mass of Jupiter. Haswell has proposed that these planets could be used to understand the geology of the rocky planets in Earth's solar system. She is part of the team for CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS), which will examine known exoplanets to improve our understanding of their sizes. CHEOPS, which features a 35 cm telescope, launched in December 2019. = Public engagement and academic service = Haswell has been featured in a Royal Astronomical Society exhibition on women fellows. She regularly provides expert opinion to the national media and is involved with various outreach programmes through the International Astronomical Union.

Her victory over the Nazi officers at the 1937 race, seen as a symbol of Czech resistance against Nazi Germany, was celebrated with parades attended by thousands of people. She is the subject of Richard Askwith's book Unbreakable: The Woman Who Defied The Nazis In The World‚Äôs Most Dangerous Horse Race.  Early life and family  Brandisov√° was born on 26 June 1895 at Sch√§ffer Castle in √ömon√≠n, Austria- Hungary (now the Czech Republic) to Count Leopold von Brandis and Johanna von Sch√§ffer. She was a member of an old Tyrolean family that had been ennobled in 1580, but later became impoverished. Her father, a horse breeder, had served as a lieutenant colonel in the Austrian army. Her mother was the daughter of Christian Ritter von Sch√§ffer. Her paternal grandmother, Countess Barbara Kinsk√°, was the sister of Count Oktavian Kinsky, who was one of the founders of the Great Pardubice Steeplechase. She had a twin sister, Countess Marie Krist√Ωna Brandisov√°. In 1897 they moved from Sch√§ffer Castle to a chateau in ≈òitka owned by her mother.  Equestrian career  Brandisov√° began horseback riding when she was eight years old and grew up attending horse races with her father. In 1916, at the age of 21, she competed in her first horse race. During the First World War, her father and brother, Count Nicholas von Brandis, went off to fight. Her brother was killed in action in Italy. Much of their property was seized y the government during the war. After the establishment of Czechoslovakia, the family lost much of their remaining property. She continued her training at the Prague-Velk√° Chuchle Racecourse and, in 1921, won her first women's race. In 1926 her cousin Count Zdenko Radslav Kinsk√Ω, a nephew of Oktavian, invited her to Orl√≠k Castle to breed Kinsky horses for hurdle racing. She continued to train as a horse racer at Velk√° Churchle and Veve≈ô√≠ Castle under the coaching of Karel ≈†mejda. In 1927 she signed up to race in the Great Pardubice Steeplechase. Her enlistment in the race caused controversy, and she was faced with protests as the race was seen as too dangerous for a woman. Petitions were made to the Czechoslovak Jockey Club to have Brandisov√° removed from the race. The Jockey Club decided that she would be allowed to race, following advice from the Royal Jockey Club in Great Britain. The Great Pardubice of 1927 was the first time a woman raced, and the first time a French rider raced (Count Alexandre de la Forest). Brandisov√° placed fifth, after falling three times on the race track. In 1933 she raced in the Great Pardubice on a mare named Norma and placed third. A year later she placed second, and in 1935 she placed fifth. In 1937 she raced with Norma in the 56th Great Pardubice. At this time, there was extreme tension between Czechoslovakia and the neighboring Nazi Germany, with the Czechs fearing an invasion. Over 40,000 people attended the race, hoping to see a Czech jockey defeat the Germans, who had been consecutive champions in the Great Pardubice over the last few years. On 17 October 1937, Brandisov√° became the first woman to win the race, seven lengths ahead of a German rider. Celebrations culminated with a 10,000 person parade from the racecourse to town square in Pardubice. The race was not held again until after World War II. Germany invaded Czechoslavkia in 1939, and Brandisov√°'s estate was seized by the Nazi government. During the war, she joined the Czech Resistance, providing food for resistance fighters and tending to wounded soldiers during the Liberation of Prague. After the war, Brandisov√° raced again in the Grand Parduice, failing to finish in 1947. After the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'√©tat brought the country under Communist control, she and her sisters moved into cottage in the woods, where they lived in relative poverty throughout the Communist regime. She died from pneumonia in Reiteregg, Austria on 12 May 1981.

It was considered notable at the time for providing employment specifically for women engineers, who were barred from many engineering works and apprenticeships.  Founding  Dora Turner and Annette Ashberry, who were working for Galloway Engineering at their Tongland Works, decided to set up a company that would allow women to gain experience in engineering. They then approached the founders of the Women's Engineering Society for support and financial backing. There were eight people involved in foundation of the company. The company's chair was Lady Katherine Parsons, who was also one of the principal shareholders along with Lady Eleanor Shelly- Rolls. Annette Ashberry was a director, along with Rachel Parsons, Caroline Haslett, Dora Turner, and Herbert Schofield, the head of Loughborough College of Technology.  Manufacturing  The first headquarters of the organisation consisted of three walls and a mud floor, and was occupied by pigs and chickens. The founders completed the building work to make the space habitable, including a concrete floor, lathes and a gas supply. They manufactured oil burners and surface plates. In 1922, the company moved to London and added adjustable spanners, screwdrivers and drilling jigs to their list of manufactured products.  Social goals  The objective of the company was to provide careers for women who had been employed in engineering during the First World War and were made redundant at the war's end, often as a result of the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act 1919, which forced women to give up their posts in favour of returning servicemen unless they had been working in the same role before the war. It also aimed to provide further training, initially at Loughborough College of Technology, where both Ashberry and Turner were studying. In the 1920s, publications such as The Engineer, Flight international, Practical Engineer, and Engineers' Gazette published articles about the company, remarking on its novel social mission to employ women. The organisation also featured in feminist papers and in the Woman Engineer journal. The Woman Engineer explained that the company had been founded by women who 'seeing no scope for their activities, and having the natural road of success barred to them... decided to risk their all and to establish an engineering works where there will be absolute freedom for them to use the ability and skill which they possess.'  Legacy  The company ceased manufacturing in 1928. According to historian Carroll Pursell, it ended in 'failure and recriminations' but inspired other organisations including the Electrical Enterprise, Ltd., and the Electrical Association for Women. Atalanta still exhibited in 1929 and 1931 at The Shipping, Engineering and Machinery Exhibition at Olympia. It was removed from listed companies in 1937. It is not related to the company Atalanta Ltd founded in 2008, or the social enterprise Atalanta, incorporated in 2017.

The Talbot Lake is part of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. The area around the lake is served indirectly by the route 175 which passes on its west bank. Some secondary forest roads serve this area for forestry and recreational tourism activities Open Street Map - Accessed February 6, 2019. Forestry is the main economic activity in the sector; recreational tourism, second. The surface of Talbot Lake is usually frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March, however the safe circulation on the ice is generally done from mid-December to mid-March.  Geography  The main watersheds near Talbot Lake are: * north side: Tourangeau lake, Vermette stream, Cyriac River, Beaver stream; * east side: Pikauba River, Pikauba Lake, rivi√®re √† Mars North-West, rivi√®re √† Mars; * south side: Pies stream, Hell stream, Black stream, General-Tremblay lake, rivi√®re aux √âcorces North-East; * west side: Leboeuf stream, C√¥t√© stream, Apica River, rivi√®re aux Canots, Willie stream. Talbot Lake turns out to be a widening of the Petite rivi√®re Pikauba, a tributary of the Pikauba River. Its current outline is dependent on the erection of a dam at its discharge; its southern and western shores are formed of marshy soil. Talbot Lake has a length of , a width of and an altitude of . This lake is mainly fed by the Petite rivi√®re Pikauba which crosses this lake to the northeast, by riparian streams, by the outlet (coming from the southwest) from Lake Maskwa and by the outlet (coming from the north -est) of several lakes including Decoigne, Beloeil, Lanct√¥t, Lalonde and Dumais. This lake is surrounded by mountains on the east and south sides, whose peaks reach to the northeast and to the east. The dike at the mouth of Talbot Lake is located to the northwest, at: * east of route 175; * south-east of the confluence of the outlet of Talbot Lake and the Rivi√®re aux √âcorces North-East; * south of Lac Tourangeau; * north of Croche stream; * north-east of the course of the Pikauba River; * south-west of the Cyriac River; * north-west of the junction of route 175 and route 169; * south-east of the center of the ex-hamlet of Mont-Apica; * south-east of the confluence of the Pikauba River and Kenogami Lake. From the mouth of Talbot Lake, the current follows the course of: * the Petite rivi√®re Pikauba on generally towards the northeast; * the Pikauba River on generally towards the north; * the Kenogami Lake on towards the northeast to Barrage de Portage-des- Roches; * the Chicoutimi River on to the east, then the northeast; * the Saguenay River on eastward to Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.  Toponymy  The term \\"Talbot\\" is a family name of French origin. The Quebec Geography Commission adopted the toponym \\"Talbot Lake\\" in 1949; this toponym evokes the work of life of Antonio Talbot (1900-1980). This lawyer, born in the Montmagny region, first settled in Quebec, where he practiced law after his studies at Laval University. In 1928, he lived in Saguenay, his new adopted homeland; he was deputy for Chicoutimi in Quebec from 1938 to 1965. Ardent defender of his region, Antonio Talbot as Minister of Highways, from 1944 to 1960, ensures the completion of the road connecting Quebec to Saguenay ‚Äì Lac-Saint-Jean. This long-awaited road link finally makes this region more accessible, which could then only be reached through the Baie-Saint-Paul hinterland. The road was completed in 1951 and, since 1999, the section has been known as the Antonio-Talbot road Book: Names and places of Quebec, work by the Commission de toponymie published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of a dictionary illustrated printed, and under that of a CD made by the company Micro-Intel, in 1997, from this dictionary..

It is thought that the sacristy and the cemetery were built in the 15th century. In 1778, a wooden porch was added. The windows in the southern and eastern walls were enlarged in the 18th century. It was built by local inhabitants. By 1863, the church became too small, and Aln√∂n new church was built nearby. After that, the old church was disused and only restored in the 1927 under direction of Erik Salv√©n. Medieval frescoes from around 1500 have been preserved. The church used to keep a wooden baptismal font made in the 13th century, however, it has been moved to the new church.

The song was often used to close Creedence Clearwater Revival concerts and was later covered by several other artists including Fogerty as a solo artist. The song popularized the neologism \\"chooglin'.\\" Lyrics and music According to John Fogerty, he began working on \\"Keep On Chooglin'\\" (as well as \\"Born on the Bayou\\" and \\"Proud Mary,\\" which also appeared on Bayou Country) during his time in the US Army Reserves. He continued working on those songs after his discharge and throughout most of 1968, during which time he came up with the idea to cross-reference the songs as part of a \\"swamp bayou myth.\\" John Fogerty biographer Thomas M. Kitts describes \\"Keep On Chooglin'\\" as \\"an energetic rave.\\" The song builds into a boogie as John Fogerty plays variations on the opening guitar riff and incorporates solos on his harmonica. John Fogerty claims that some of his guitar playing on \\"Keep on Chooglin'\\" is based on the playing of Charlie Christian. Kitts describes Doug Clifford's drums as \\"pounding,\\" Stu Cook's bass guitar as \\"thumping\\" and Tom Fogerty's rhythm guitar chords as \\"slashing.\\" Music writer Steven L. Hamelman praises Clifford's drumming on the song as \\"a brilliant groove, never wavering.\\" The song popularized the term \\"chooglin', which may have been invented by Fogerty.\\" The lyrics tell the listener that he or she should \\"keep on chooglin'.\\" John Fogerty explained the term chooglin' as \\"what happens when 'you got to ball and have a good time.'\\" Similar to Fogerty's explanation, Cook viewed chooglin' as a metaphor for sex. Lyrics of the song such as \\"Here comes Louie, works in the sewer, he gonna choogle tonight\\" imply that chooglin' is especially done by the working class, but other lyrics such as \\"if you can choose it, who can refuse it, y'all be chooglin' tonight\\" imply that everyone can choogle. Clifford described the message to keep on chooglin' as inspirational, \\"It means keep on going, keep on truckin'. Things may be bad and look bleak, but believe in yourself, pull up the old bootstraps and get the job done.\\" According to Village Voice critic Robert Christgau, the verb \\"choogle\\" \\"has more to do with vigor than with potency, more to do with simple activity than with sexuality.\\" \\"Keep On Chooglin'\\" has some relationship to \\"Bootleg,\\" another song from Bayou Country in that the singer appears to be a marginalized figure. The two songs also share similar riffs, and were both designed as \\"concert ravers.\\" \\"Keep On Chooglin'\\" and \\"Bootleg\\" (as well as some other Creedence songs) were both used to demonstrate the similarities between different songs as part of Fogerty's defense in the lawsuit brought against him by Fantasy Records, in which Fantasy claimed that Fogerty's solo song \\"The Old Man Down the Road\\" copied the melody from \\"Run Through the Jungle,\\" a song which Fantasy held the rights to. \\"Keep On Chooglin'\\" also relates to several other songs on Bayou Country as one of several songs that maintain an illusion that the band is from the Louisiana backwoods, a group that also includes \\"Born on the Bayou,\\" \\"Proud Mary\\" and \\"Graveyard Train.\\" Creedence Clearwater Revival often used \\"Keep On Chooglin'\\" as their final song in live concerts. Although the album version lasted a little under 8 minutes, in concert the song could extend for more than 15 minutes. Live versions have been included on several Creedence Clearwater Revival live albums, including Live in Europe, The Concert and Live at Woodstock. \\"Keep On Chooglin'\\" was included on the soundtrack of the 1980 Art Linson film Where the Buffalo Roam and on the compilation album The Long Road Home.https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-long-road-home-the-ultimate-john- fogerty-creedence-collection-mw0000349198 Cover versions John Fogerty has frequently played \\"Keep On Chooglin'\\" in his live solo concerts.

It is Muir's debut novel and the first in her Locked Tomb trilogy, followed by Harrow the Ninth (2020) and Alecto the Ninth (2021). Plot Gideon the Ninth is a science fantasy set in a galactic empire with nine planets, each ruled by a house that practices its own unique type of necromancy. Although advanced technology exists, the Nine Houses primarily rely on necromancy and wars are fought with archaic close combat weapons (very few people actually know what firearms are and they appear to be ancient artifacts). The emperor, who rules the First House, uses his most powerful necromancers (known as \\"Lyctors\\") and his army (known as the \\"Cohort\\") to wage a war against an unknown enemy. The Emperor invites the heirs and their bodyguards (called cavaliers) of the Nine Houses to compete to become new Lyctors. The narrative begins on the planet controlled by the Ninth House, a death cult tasked by ancient commandment with guarding The Locked Tomb, a vault believed to contain an incredibly dangerous secret. 18-year-old orphan Gideon Nav attempts to escape from the Ninth House, where she was raised in indentured servitude. Gideon was adopted by the Ninth House after her mother mysteriously appeared on the planet, dead, with baby Gideon in her arms. Gideon's plan is foiled by her longtime rival, the Ninth House's heir, Harrowhark \\"Harrow\\" Nonagesimus, who enlists Gideon as her primary cavalier in Harrow's bid to become a Lyctor. For unexplained reasons, Gideon and Harrowhark are among the only children in the Ninth House, and so Gideon (a warrior who dreams of joining the Cohort) is Harrow's only real choice for cavalier. Harrow and Gideon travel to the planet ruled by the First House, where they explore a decaying mansion known as Canaan House along with the heirs and cavaliers primary of the other houses. The contestants are tasked with discovering and deciphering ancient secrets housed in Canaan House that represent the most advanced necromancy techniques in the galaxy, and then use those secrets to perform the process that will turn them into Lyctors themselves. Gideon and Harrow quickly pull ahead of most of the other contestants, due to Harrow's immense, once-in-a-generation skill with necromancy and Gideon's perceptiveness and combat skills. In their investigations they work alongside Palamedes Sextus, the brilliant heir of the scholarly Sixth House, and his lethal cavalier Camilla, as well as Dulcinea Septimus, heir of the Seventh House, who is dying of a terminal disease and bound to a wheelchair, who Gideon starts to fall in love with. They also contend with the Eighth House, practitioners of dangerous soul-manipulation magic, religious fanatics who believe that the Ninth House are heretics who deserve to die. After a series of unexplained deaths, the remaining Houses turn to bribery, blackmail, and unsteady alliances. Harrowhark eventually admits to Gideon that the source of her immense necromantic powers as well as the reason that she and Gideon grew up alone is that Harrow's parents, in an attempt to reverse their House's declining fortunes by producing the greatest necromancer of a generation, performed a ritual to sacrifice every child of that generation to imbue Harrow with the power of their souls, a secret that Harrow has carried the guilt of her entire life. She and Gideon realize that despite their long rivalry, they do not hate one another, and they admit their emotional dependence on one another and begin a shaky romantic relationship. As events in Canaan House build towards a climax and more and more of the contestants die mysterious deaths, Gideon and Palamedes eventually learn that Dulcinea Septimus has actually been dead for months, and she has been replaced by the Emperor's first Lyctor, Cytherea the First. Cytherea has been murdering the others in an effort to draw the Emperor to the planet, where she can attempt to kill him in revenge for some supposed crime in the distant past. Palamedes sacrifices himself in an attempt to kill Cytherea, but fails; Lyctors are revealed to be immortal beings wielding both limitless necromantic power and superhuman fighting skills. Harrowhark finishes her and Palamedes' research and discovers that the ritual to become a Lyctor involves sacrificing the life of a necromancer's cavalier, devouring their soul to create a 'battery' of unlimited magical energy as well as absorbing their combat skills. They also discover that Ianthe Tridentarius, the glamorous but arrogant and merciless necromancer of the Third House, has already learned this and sacrificed her own cavalier, successfully becoming a Lyctor. All the surviving players battle one another as well as Cytherea, who seems to be invincible, until Gideon commits suicide to complete the ritual and make Harrow a Lyctor (against Harrow's will). Harrow uses her new power to kill Cytherea and then falls unconscious. Harrow wakes up on the Emperor's flagship to learn that Gideon is dead and she and Ianthe are the only ones to reach Lyctorhood. The Emperor, the godlike king of the Nine Houses, states that his Lyctors have been slowly going insane or dying for the past few millennia, explaining his call for new recruits. The Empire is in danger, and Harrowhark agrees to serve the Emperor as Harrowhark the First.  Reception  Gideon the Ninth was named one of the best books of 2019 by several publications and organizations, including NPR, Vox, the New York Public Library, Wired, Polygon, Bustle, Paste, Shelf Awareness, Book Riot, and Gizmodo Australia, and was selected by Amazon's editors as the best science fiction and fantasy book of 2019. It has received endorsements from authors V. E. Schwab, Charles Stross, Robin Sloan, Warren Ellis, Martha Wells, Amal El-Mohtar, Kiersten White, Annalee Newitz, Genevieve Cogman, Kameron Hurley, Django Wexler, Yoon Ha Lee, Rebecca Roanhorse, Richard Kadrey, Rin Chupeco, Max Gladstone, and Brooke Bolander. Writing in The New York Times, El-Mohtar called Gideon the Ninth a \\"devastating debut that deserves every ounce of hype it‚Äôs received\\" and praised it as \\"deft, tense and atmospheric, compellingly immersive and wildly original.\\" Jason Sheehan's NPR review also praised the novel's originality, appreciating its ability to balance many different genres: \\"Gideon the Ninth is too funny to be horror, too gooey to be science fiction, has too many spaceships and autodoors to be fantasy, and has far more bloody dismemberings than your average parlor romance.\\" Constance Grady in Vox said the novel was \\"sleek and compulsively readable,\\" and commended Muir's ability to slide her \\"voice seamlessly from Lovecraftian gothic mode into a slangy contemporary mode without ever undercutting one or the other for cheap comedy.\\" Adam Rowe in Forbes also commented on the Muir's incorporation of \\"2019 language tics,\\" calling it enjoyable. In Rowe's interview with Muir, she said of the novel's prose that the \\"irreverent tone\\" was intended \\"to balance out the horror aspect and some of the heavier, more Gormenghastian stylings.\\" Critics also complimented the fight scenes, which Muir wrote in consultation with an experienced sword-fighter. Liz Bourke and Carolyn Cushman gave a more critical review in Locus, saying that the novel failed \\"in its interrogation of the central hate-co-dependence-need relationship between Gideon and Harrow.\\" The novel was shortlisted for the 2020 Nebula Award for Best Novel, the 2020 World Fantasy Award, and the 2020 Hugo Award for Best Novel,Announcing the 2020 Hugo Award Finalists, at Tor.com; published April 7, 2020; retrieved April 7, 2020 and won the 2020 Locus Award for Best First Novel.

It was designated as a SSSI in 1995 because it supports a number of wintering birds, including a large flock of goosander. This site is \\"one of the most northerly inland breeding populations of reed warbler in Britain.\\" Hay-a-Park was once part of a royal park, an early landowner being Edward II. Site history The area once belonged to the Crown; then Edward II gave it to his favourite, Piers Gaveston. After Gaveston was executed, it passed back to the Crown, but was subject to poaching for some time. In the 14th century the area was known as Park de la Haye where Edward III bred horses. Edward's fifteen-year-old wife Philippa of Hainault was given this land on the occasion of her marriage; she was later the mother of the Black Prince (whose statue stands in Leeds City Square) and John of Gaunt. Another story says that in the 11th or 12th century Henry I conferred the lands to Gamel de Scriven, and they remained in the family under various names including Edward II until the last heir, Sir Charles Slingsby, died falling from his horse into the river in 1869, leaving no issue. Tree-lined lakeside footpath The area later became known as Haya Park. By the seventeenth century the land was at least partly wooded, and managed for timber. By the end of that century it was owned by Lady Hewley, who used its rents to support the Church and charities. When its farmland was valued in 1755 by Robert Moody of York, the land was considered potentially good for cultivation, but contemporary farmers were \\"poor idle drunken ignorant fellows\\" who spent Sundays in the alehouse; so that the land was \\"miserably run and full of weeds,\\" with no prospect of land improvement. In the 19th century the leasehold of Haya Park was purchased for the purpose of rectorial tithes by York Minster; it was still a royal park, where deer were protected. Part of Hay-a-Park later became a gravel works, and the site occupies a section which has been \\"largely undisturbed since the completion of extraction in the early 1970s.\\" Site location and designation Unlabelled entrance to Hay-a-Park Gravel Pit Hay-a-Park Gravel Pit is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), consisting of \\"standing open water and canals.\\" This reserve has no parking area, no visitor facilities, and no official public footpaths. Fishing and swimming are not permitted, and dog- walking is discouraged due to disturbance of water birds. The site is adjacent to the eastern edge of Knaresborough, accessible by public footpath from two unlabelled entrances on Park Lane, one located near the railway bridge, and the other next to Knaresborough Rugby Club. The site was first notified on 15 June 1995, being \\"of interest for its breeding birds and wintering wildfowl.\\" It is one of about eight SSSIs in the Harrogate region, others being Ripon Parks, Farnham Mires, Hack Fall Wood, Brimham Rocks, Cow Myers, Kirk Deighton Mar Field Fen, Quarry Moor, and Bishop Monkton Ings. As described by Natural England in 1995, the site contains the 24-hectare Hay-a-Park Lake at the north end of the site, \\"three small ponds\\" at the south end, and \\"associated areas of reedbed, scrub, mature hedgerow and grassland,\\" however as of 2019 much of the scrub had become woodland. Significant site content =Fauna= Of \\"national importance\\" are the goosander which winter here, numbering up to 315 birds as counted in 1995. Of \\"local importance\\" are wigeon, greylag, coot and mallard. In spring, oystercatcher, wigeon and various geese graze on the adjacent field. Tufted duck, mallard and great crested grebe breed on or near Hay-a-Park Lake, as do common sandpiper and ringed plover. Grasshopper warbler and sedge warbler breed on the small ponds. The reed warbler breeds here too, being \\"one of the most northerly inland breeding populations of reed warbler in Britain.\\" The fly Raphium laticorne has been found in \\"nine lowland localities\\" in Yorkshire including at Hay-a-Park, and Campsicnemus marginatus has also been found here.

This is for the benefit of wintering waders and feeding ducks and geese. Shallow waters allow aquatic plants to receive light, thereby allowing breeding conditions for dragonflies and damselflies. \\"Protection of appropriate water quality\\" is required, as is regulation of potential incoming water and sediment. \\"Bottom feeding coarse fish\\" must be removed, because they may \\"uproot plants and disturb sediments.\\" \\"Appropriate nesting and feeding conditions are maintained\\" with regard to open land, scrub and reeded areas. \\"Recreational activities should be managed sympathetically to avoid conflict with the management of the waterbody for nature conservation,\\" and \\"recreational use of woodland should be discouraged\\" should the site contain a heronry. Development and risk assessment A 2012 assessment of the site was \\"unfavourable, declining.\\" Notices have been erected at two entrance points of the site, to remind the public that there has been a continuing concern about \\"illegal fishing\\" here. There are also issues of freshwater fish-stocking, public access and disturbance. A woman was photographed swimming recreationally in the lake in winter 2019, putting greylags to flight. Some visitors to Hay-a-Park have been carrying out three categories of \\"operations likely to damage the special interest,\\" namely articles 16a, 27 and 28 of Natural England's views about management of the SSSI. Nevertheless, the published audit for the Knaresborough Development Plan of 2016 described the site as being available for recreational use, and designated it as an \\"important community area\\" (ICA).

In June of 1942, during World War 2, she departed Victoria Harbour on her maiden voyage to England with zinc, lead, plywood, timber and other raw materials. On 20 June 1942 the Japanese submarine I-25, under the command of Commander Meiji Tagami, torpedoed the Fort Camosun while she was 70 miles south-southwest of Cape Flattery. Fort Camosun was torpedoed just eleven hours out of port at 11:00pm. The torpedo hit the number two hold on the port side. The crew abandoned ship into the remaining good lifeboats. The submarine then surfaced used deck guns to fire 18 shells at the Fort Camosun causing further damage to the ship. While badly damaged the Fort Camosun did not sink, as she was loaded with plywood, timber and other floatable cargo. The crew radioed for help and later an American Flying Fortress located the crew.

Whitaker, who had a criminal history involving grand theft, burglary, aggravated robbery, felonious assault, and sexual battery, took DeFreeze to an abandoned house where he raped her, and stabbed and beat her to death using a hammer, a screwdriver, a nut driver, a box cutter, and a drill. DeFreeze, who attended school at E Prep & Village Prep Woodland Hills, was reported missing, causing a city-wide search. Her body was discovered three days later. Whitaker‚Äôs murder trial occurred in February 2018. Defense attorneys argued that Whitaker's drug use impaired his ability to control impulses and obey the law while prosecutors disagreed, saying that he knew what he was doing. The jury convicted Whitaker on February 13, 2018. Later, the jury recommended that Whitaker receive the death penalty and the judge upheld it. Whitaker is currently on death row. In 2019 DeFreeze‚Äôs parents filed a lawsuit against several people and entities arguing that the school's failure to notify them about DeFreeze‚Äôs absence and the failure to monitor abandoned properties led to her death. In 2019 Governor John Kasich signed a law named after DeFreeze which requires schools to notify parents of unexcused absences within two hours.  Background  =Alianna DeFreeze= Alianna DeFreeze, the daughter of Damon DeFreeze and Donnesha Cooper, was a seventh- grader at E Prep & Village Prep Woodland Hills. She was fourteen-years-old and had a developmental disability. She would take the RTA bus to school, which her mother and grandmother did not like, though the fact that one stop was in front of a police station made them feel better about her means of transportation. =Christopher Whitaker= Christopher Whitaker (born 1973) was a native of Fayetteville, Tennessee with a long criminal record. His crimes and alleged crimes include: * In 1998 he was charged with grand theft and burglary. He was also charged with aggravated robbery and felonious assault, though the case was dismissed. * On April 8, 2005, he committed sexual battery and felonious assault against a woman in her home after she let him in so that he could use the bathroom. According to the victim, he came out of the bathroom with a pair of scissors and began choking her. He proceeded to stab her in the neck with the scissors. She passed out and woke up on the floor with neck pain and with her pants and underwear removed. An evaluation determined that she had been sexually assaulted. Whitaker was sentenced to four years in prison for third-degree felony sexual battery and second-degree felonious assault. He was released in 2009 and was registered as a sex offender. * In 2012 he was charged with aggravated theft.  Crime  RTA surveillance footage recorded on the morning of January 26, 2017, shows DeFreeze exiting a bus while surveillance video from a business shows her crossing East 93rd Street. She was then stopped outside the True Gospel Missionary Baptist Church by Whitaker, who, according to video recorded from the church, had been pacing around the area for several hours. DeFreeze took a step back from Whitaker, who then followed her. According to a witness, Whitaker grabbed her as she walked along East 93rd Avenue. The witness did not contact the police because he was unsure of the relationship between DeFreeze and Whitaker. Surveillance video then shows Whitaker leading DeFreeze through a field to Fuller Avenue. Whitaker took DeFreeze to an abandoned house. There, he raped her. Whitaker then used a Black and Decker drill, a Phillips-head screwdriver, a nut driver, a box cutter, and a hammer to stab and beat her to death. DeFreeze died as a result of the stab wounds and blunt force injuries which were numerous and severe. Whitaker claimed that he was high on cocaine and blacked out during the crime. After murdering DeFreeze, in the late morning hours, Whitaker assisted a pastor at the Gogatha Missionary Baptist Church to unload food pantry items from a truck. The pastor described Whitaker's demeanor as calm.  Criminal proceedings  =Investigation= At 4:00 pm when DeFreeze had still not returned home from school her mother became concerned. She called E Prep and was informed that DeFreeze never arrived at school. DeFreeze was reported missing, prompting a city-wide search. On January 29, DeFreeze's body was found at the house where Whitaker had murdered her by three Cleveland police officers. The officers entered the house after noticing that the back door was open and found a trail of blood leading from the dining room into a room behind a closed door. After kicking open the door, they found DeFreeze's deceased body crumpled in a corner in a pool of blood. She was naked except for her socks and had wounds to her head. The boxcutter was used to slash DeFreeze's neck while the drill had been used to put four puncture wounds into her cheek, as well as a wound on her forehead that dislodged her right eyeball from the socket. Because many of the wounds showed signs that they had started healing, they were inflicted on her several hours before she died. DeFreeze appeared as if she had been dragged and thrown into the room. DeFreeze‚Äôs clothing, including a tie soaked with blood and a sweater that was torn open down the front, were found strewn about the house. Along with DeFreeze's clothing, police also found her backpack, and tools including a drill, box cutter, a screwdriver, and a hammer, all of which had blood on them. The tools were laid out on a built-in bench in the dining room, which prosecutors described as a makeshift workstation. DeFreeze‚Äôs body was identified using dental records by the medical examiner's office. An autopsy performed by Cuyahoga County Deputy Medical Examiner Dr. David Dolinak revealed that she suffered wounds caused by tools found in the house including a drill, a screwdriver, and a box cutter. She had so many injuries and her injuries were so severe that Dolinak could not identify which one caused her death. Forensics analysts also found Whitaker's DNA on DeFreeze's body. Whitaker was identified using the DNA and was arrested at 7:00 pm on February 2 at the Villa Serena Apartments in Mayfield Heights with the assistance of U.S. Marshalls. Whitaker was interrogated by Cleveland Police, and changed his story several times, initially denying any involvement in the murder and then going on to admit his involvement, but still denying responsibility by blaming his actions on crack-cocaine use. Whitaker said that he had blacked out after punching DeFreeze and that he would not have committed the crime if he were sober. \\"People are going to look at me like a monster. I'm not a monster‚Äù he told investigators, adding that he was ‚Äújust an addict who made a mistake that shouldn't have happened.\\" Whitaker also told investigators that he did not want his face in the news. =Trial and death sentence= DeFreeze's murder trial began on February 1, 2018. Whitaker's defense attorneys acknowledged his crimes but said that his drug use made him less able to control his impulses and follow the law. Prosecutors disagreed, with assistant prosecutor Mahmoud Awadallah saying: ‚Äúthe evidence does not point to a drug-induced frenzy, does not point to a blackout. It points to that he knows what he was doing.‚Äù On February 13, 2018, Whitaker was found guilty of ten counts. After convicting Whitaker jurors had to decide whether or not he should be sentenced to death or life in prison. On February 23 the jury recommended that he be put to death and Judge Carolyn Friedland agreed and formally sentenced him on March 26, saying that the mitigating circumstances \\"pale in comparison to the barbarity of the evidence.\\" DeFreeze's mother told the court that ‚Äúdeath is too good for him and I won‚Äôt believe he has any remorse until he suffers like my daughter suffered.‚Äù DeFreeze‚Äôs father told Whitaker ‚Äúwhen you get where you‚Äôre going, you‚Äôre going to get what you got coming, before you get to the gas, lethal injection chamber, and that ‚Äúmy baby didn‚Äôt have a chance.‚Äù The woman Whitaker had attacked in 2005 supported his death sentence. Along with his death sentence, Whitaker was sentenced to forty-eight years in prison for aggravated burglary, felonious assault, rape, obstruction of justice, and gross abuse of a corpse. Whitaker is currently imprisoned on death row at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution in Chillicothe, Ohio for aggravated burglary, kidnapping, rape, aggravated murder, tampering with evidence, and abuse of a corpse.  Aftermath  Hundreds of people attended DeFreeze‚Äôs funeral on February 11. Shortly after the murder, DeFreeze's mother became homeless. DeFreeze‚Äôs family began a nonprofit foundation in her name called the Alianna DeFreeze Let‚Äôs Make A Change Foundation. The foundation works to address the issues of abandoned homes, help children obtain safe routes to school, and address domestic violence, homelessness, and police-community relations. In January 2019, DeFreeze's parents filed a wrongful death lawsuit in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas naming the Cleveland Metropolitan School District, E Prep and Village Prep Woodland Hills, Friends of Breakthrough Schools, the City of Cleveland, the man who owned the abandoned house where the crime occurred, murderer Christopher Whittaker, and others as defendants. The lawsuit claims that there was a system in place in which administrators at E Prep would send an automated message notification to parents to alert them about news involving their children, including unexcused absences. DeFreeze's parents were signed up to receive text messages in the case of their daughter's unexcused absence but did not receive any such notification, only finding out about her absence at 4:00 pm after she did not make it home. The lawsuit alleges that the school was aware of DeFreeze‚Äôs absence but did not contact her parents and that if DeFreeze's parents had been notified immediately or within a reasonable amount of time, she may have been located before being raped, tortured, and murdered. The lawsuit also alleges that the school lied when they said they tried to send an alert but failed, and that they should have been immediately concerned about DeFreeze's absence because of her developmental disability and because it was uncharacteristic of her to miss school. The lawsuit states that because of the defendants' negligence DeFreeze‚Äôs last hours \\"were spent in excruciating, paralyzing, debilitating and unthinkable physical and mental pain.\\" The lawsuit also claims that the City of Cleveland and city employees failed to monitor abandoned properties and prevent illicit activities from occurring in them and names the owner of the house where the murder occurred, saying that he failed to maintain, operate and monitor it. DeFreeze‚Äôs family is seeking fifteen million in damages. In March 2019, the DeFrezes filed an amended complaint, which E Prep moved to dismiss. E Prep argued that it is immune from liability due to its status as a political subdivision. The motion was denied by the trial court and E Prep appealed to Ohio's Court of Appeals for the Eighth District, which ruled in their favor. In January 2019, Ohio Governor John Kasich signed into law the Aliana Alert bill after it passed the House of Representatives 85-4. The law requires schools to call parents within 120 minutes of the start of the school day if their child is absent without the parents having previously notified the school. It went into effect in April 2019. DeFreeze's mother also expressed an interest in having more police protect the streets.

The protests continued to be buoyed up by the success of the pan-democrats at the November 2019 District Council Elections, but also continued to feel the effects of the mass arrests at the November 2019 siege of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. With the notable exceptions of protests on New Year's Day and on 19 January, protests remained smaller-scale but took place almost every day. Towards the end of the month, as the first cases of what would develop into the COVID-19 pandemic were detected in the city, protests began to turn towards the perceived shortcomings in the handling of the outbreak by the Hong Kong government. Events = 1 January: New Year's Day = In the evening hours of New Year's Eve, Hong Kong police fired tear gas in Mong Kok, as they continued to try and clear the streets of protesters who had set fires to roadblocks on Nathan Road. Armoured vehicles were seen clearing roadblocks set up by protesters using a variety of objects. The crowd also chanted \\"Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our time\\" during the last few seconds of 2019. The march on New Years' Day, named \\"Stand shoulder to shoulder\\", was aimed at pressuring Carrie Lam and the government to accept protesters' five core demands. Further demands of the police- approved protest included calls for increased union representation, for police to take responsibility for misconduct such as arresting medical staff at protests, and for the Hong Kong government not to increase the salaries of police who had been involved in such misconduct. Thousands gathered filling up the lawn of Victoria Park, from where the organisers started the march 20 minutes ahead of the planned 3:00 pm start. As people marched out of Victoria Park, more people were waiting to get in. Secondary school students, families with children, and elderly people had turned up to join the march. The marchers called chants commonly heard throughout the protests, such as \\"Five demands, not one less\\" and \\"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\\". The Civil Human Rights Front said the police asked them to end the march after clashes broke out in Wan Chai. Officers soon began firing tear gas and pepper spray there. The front said it immediately complied and asked people to leave. It said they received notice from police at 5:30 pm, asking to end the rally by 6:15 pm. Organisers claim over one million participated in the protest. Police said 60,000 people attended the march at its peak. The CHRF said the police decision to end the march showed that the government is unwilling to listen to the voices of the people and is infringing on the right of assembly of Hong Kong residents. They warned that peace will not return to Hong Kong if police continue to adopt such methods.

At about 1 pm, about 100 citizens gathered in and around Statue Square in Central. Participants chanted slogans in the square, other held signs to protest police use of allegedly excessive force. At about 1:45, the crowd walked towards Pedder Street. The crowd then shouted \\"See you tomorrow\\" and disbanded.

Early life and career Ratabon was born in Montpellier, the son of Jean de Ratabon, an equerry, and Catherine Pache from Servien, near Mende. He became Ma√Ætre d'H√¥tel Ordinaire of King Louis XIV, Tr√©sorier G√©n√©ral de France at Montpellier, and Intendant des Gabelles of Languedoc. B√¢timents du Roi In Paris he became First Assistant to Fran√ßois Sublet de Noyers, who was the Surintendant des B√¢timents under Cardinal Richelieu, and continued in this role under √âtienne Le Camus, who succeeded Sublet de Noyers as Surintendant after the latter's dismissal under Cardinal Mazarin in 1643. Ratabon succeeded Le Camus in 1656. Ratabon relinquished the post to Jean-Baptiste Colbert on 1 January 1664.Gordan 1996, p. 134.Cojannot 2003, pp. 141, 173‚Äì174. In his role as Surintendant des B√¢timents, Ratabon ordered the demolition of the H√¥tel du Petit-Bourbon in October 1660 to make way for the eastward expansion of the Louvre and construction of the Louvre Colonnade. The order resulted in the eviction without warning of the troupe of Moli√®re from the theatre of the Petit Bourbon and their transfer to the disused and run-down theatre of the Palais-Royal.

They are known from Cuba, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, but are absent from Jamaica. While they were formerly placed in the Megalonychidae alongside two-toed sloths and ground sloths like Megalonyx, recent mitochondrial DNA and collagen sequencing studies place them as basal to all other sloths. They displayed significant diversity in body size and lifestyle, with Megalocnus being terrestrial and probably weighing several hundred kilograms, while Neocnus was likely arboreal and similar in weight to extant tree sloths, at less than 10 kilograms.  Origin  jugal. It is thought that sloths arrived in the Caribbean from South America (where they arose) around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary about 33 Ma ago, when there was a significant sea level drop caused by a glaciation episode. This has been associated with the GAARlandia (Greater Aves Antilles Ridge) hypothesis, where the Aves Ridge formed a land bridge during the interval, allowing overland migration into the Greater Antilles. The existence of such a land bridge has been questioned because of the lack of geological evidence for the Aves Ridge having been subaerially exposed as well as the fact that many other South American animals (such as marsupials and ungulates) are absent from the Greater Antilles, making a complete land bridge unlikely. The earliest evidence suggesting the presence of sloths in the Caribbean is a partial femur from the Early Oligocene of Puerto Rico. More definitive remains are known for Imagocnus from Early Miocene Cuba.  Taxonomy  The taxonomy of Caribbean sloths is in flux, with the number of species present among the Pleistocene-Holocene taxa in question; some species are likely junior synonyms, while the diversity of some genera is probably understated. The mitochondrial DNA study suggests that Acratocnus ye and Parocnus serus are deeply divergent from each other, having split during the Oligocene, suggesting an early radiation within the group; they proposed the families Acratocnidae and Parocnidae within a new superfamily, Megalocnoidea. Based on White and MacPhee (2001): *Megalocnus ‚Ä†M. rodens Pleistocene to Holocene of Cuba. M. zile junior synonym of Parocnus serus *Acratocnus  ‚Ä†A. odontrigonus Pleistocene of Puerto Rico  ‚Ä†A. ye Pleistocene to Holocene of Hispaniola  ‚Ä†A. antillensis Pleistocene to Holocene of Cuba *Parocnus  ‚Ä†Parocnus browni Pleistocene to Holocene of Cuba  ‚Ä†Parocnus serus Pleistocene to Holocene of Hispaniola *Neocnus ‚Ä†N. gliriformis Pleistocene to Holocene of Cuba ‚Ä†N. major Pleistocene to Holocene of Cuba  ‚Ä†N. comes Pleistocene to Holocene of Hispaniola  ‚Ä†N. dousman Pleistocene to Holocene of Hispaniola  ‚Ä†N. toupiti Pleistocene to Holocene of Hispaniola *Imagocnus I. zazae Early Miocene of Cuba Paulocnus from Pliocene - Early Pleistocene deposits in Cura√ßao has been suggested to be part of Megalonychidae while Megalocnidae was considered part of the group, its location close to mainland South America and considerable displacement from the Greater Antilles make referral to Megalocnidae questionable. For other sloth taxa of the Caribbean, see Pilosans of the Caribbean. =Phylogeny= The following sloth family phylogenetic tree is based on collagen and mitochondrial DNA sequence data (see Fig. 4 of Presslee et al., 2019).  Extinction  Sloths in the Caribbean survived about 5000 years longer than ground sloths on the mainland. On Cuba the latest date for Megalocnus is calibrated 4700 BP. while dates for Parocnus browni are around 6250 BP. On Hispaniola the dates for some indeterminate sloth specimens are around 5000 BP; these dates roughly coincide with the first settlement of the Caribbean, which suggests that humans were the cause of the extinction.

The first ascent of the mountain was made August 31, 1901, by John E. Bushnell, August S. Eggers, Karl Schuluneggar, and Friedrich Michel via the southeast couloir. The first ascent of the north ridge was made in 1921 by Neal Carter, Tom Fyles, and Don Munday. The west ridge was first climbed by Georgia Engelhard and Ernest Feuz in 1933. The mountain's name was adopted in 1906, then re-approved September 8, 1932, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. It was so-named because of its proximity above Bear Creek (since renamed Connaught Creek), and in keeping with the bear theme of other nearby features such as Ursus Major Mountain, Ursus Minor Mountain, Bruins Pass, and Balu Pass. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Grizzly Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. Precipitation runoff from the mountain and meltwater from a small unnamed glacier on its northwest slope drains into tributaries of the Beaver River and Illecillewaet River.

Location Oola Castle is located east of the village of Oola. It lies in the Golden Vale, southeast of Limerick. It should not be confused with the castle in Ballyneety nearby, which is sometimes called \\"Oola Castle.\\" History The current building dates to the late 16th century and was built by the O'Briens. It is classified as a \\"later\\" tower house; according to Claire Foley and Colm Donnelly, \\"greater provision of heat and light, married to Renaissance concepts of symmetry, was incorporated into the traditional building form to create a new tower-house paradigm, as expressed at buildings such as Oola [Castle].\\"https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/files/6377691/Parke_s_Castle_second_edit.pdf In 1825, antlers of the Irish elk were discovered; and, in 1828, a bronze trumpet, spear and arrow heads of bronze were found. Both were placed in the museum of Trinity College, Dublin. A local legend concerns a princess named Theresa who lived in the castle in the 18th century; she was very fond of oranges and was later forced to move to County Cavan for unclear reasons. Castle View of Oola castle The castle is a square six-storey limestone tower house. There are circular bartizans on the northeast and southwest corners. The upper windows have hood moulding, and the east and west walls have their original fireplaces. When it was in use, it would have had whitewashed walls, gables crowned with chimneys and mullioned windows.

She serves as Editor-in-Chief of the journal Plant, Cell & Environment.  Early life and education  Amtmann studied mathematics and biology at the University of Paris and Heidelberg University. She was an Erasmus Programme student at the University of Barcelona. Amtmann completed her graduate degrees in biology in the laboratory of Dietrich Gradmann at the University of G√∂ttingen. Her doctoral research involved the use of electrophysiology to study unicellular marine algae, in an effort to understand how they maintain homeostasis for calcium and sodium ions.  Research and career  In 1993, after earning her PhD, Amtmann investigated ion transport properties in barley in Dale Sanders' laboratory at the University of York. Whilst at York she developed microarrays that could be used to monitor how ion transporters responded to nutrient deficiency and salinity. Amtmann was appointed a lecturer at the University of Glasgow in 2001 and was promoted to Professor in 2014. She spent 2007 on sabbatical at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Golm. Her research considers the mechanisms by which plants adapt to nutrient deficiency, drought and salinity. She has explored how solar-powered microorganisms could be used to extra salt from seawater. Salt is toxic in seawater because it causes dehydration in cells and can distort the shape of proteins. Marine organisms have developed strategies to avoid toxicity, and Amtmann looks to identify these organisms, fit them with molecular engines and encourage them to take up salt until they are saturated with salt. The salt-packed cells will die and can be removed from the system, leaving fresh water and a waste product that can be used for bio-cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Amtmann's research has been supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. She leads Algae UK, one of six Networks in Industrial Biotechnology and Bioenergy (NIBBs) that look to support the UK's transition to a low carbon economy. Algae UK looks to increase research and development into high value products created from microalgae and macroalgae, as well as increasing attention to cyanobacterial synthetic biology.

It was squatted in 1990 and legalised in 1991 as an autonomous housing project and self-managed social centre. The yard was used as a wagenplatz for people living in vehicles. It is a left-wing project, connected to punks, anarchists and Autonomen. The building has become a symbol for the radical left in Berlin in the same manner as Rozbrat in Pozna≈Ñ or Ungdomshuset in Copenhagen. It has survived several eviction attempts both through political pressure and because the developers have always run out of money. History of building The building was constructed in 1905 for a Jewish businessman. A symmetrical Gr√ºnderzeit facade stands flanked by two short wings. What can be seen from the street used to be the back of the building, since the front half was destroyed by bombing at the end of World War II and was never rebuilt. The surfaces of the building are damaged from the bombs and subsequent neglect, with most of the stucco gone. During World War II, the building was used by the Allgemeine Elektrizit√§ts- Gesellschaft (the general electricity company) to house French forced labourers. After the war, the building lay in East Berlin. Under the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the building was used for sports activities and there was a bowling alley in the basement. By 1990, it had become vacant and was scheduled to be demolished.  Occupation  K√∏pi in 2006. In translation the writing on the building reads There are no borders between people, only between the top and the bottom. K√∏pi was squatted on February 23, 1990, by Autonomen from West Berlin. Despite the terrible state of the building, the squatters were attracted by the large rooms. The police did not attempt to evict the occupation, which marked the first time people from West Berlin had squatted in East Berlin. The squatters legalised their occupation with the district council of Mitte in 1991. From the very beginning, K√∏pi was a radical left space where anarchists, socialists, queers and musicians were welcome. The building itself is covered in banners and graffiti. It became known as K√∏pi because the squatters chose to use the Danish √∏ despite the name coming from the name of the street (K√∂penicker Stra√üe). K√∏pi is also spelt Koepi, K√∂pi and even occasionally Kopi in English or Spanish texts. K√∏pi has become a important symbol for the radical left in Berlin, linked to projects elsewhere such as the Ungdomshuset in Copenhagen and Rozbrat in Pozna≈Ñ.  Ownership  The building was owned by the GDR and then by the state which succeeded it. In 1995, the government sold the building to Volquard Petersen, who wished to develop the site into the Sun Courtyards (German: Sonnenh√∂f). He then ran out of money and the project was shelved. Petersen fell into debt with the Commerzbank and the building was foreclosed. In 1999, the district of Mitte carried out a forced auction. The auction was unsuccessful with none of almost 30 participants offering to buy the property, which had an estimated value of 5.4 million marks. The offer of K√∏pi residents to buy the building for one mark was rejected, alongside their request for the terrain to be declared a 'special use site for experimental living' (German: Sondernutzungsfl√§che f√ºr experimentelles Wohnen). In the meantime, the residents carried out essential repairs such as plumbing and preferred not to repair the facade, since they wanted to remember the chequered history of the building. They also carried out many political actions designed to ensure their survival in the house and this made the building unattractive to investors. For example, when another auction of the building was held in 2007, outside the courtroom there were 300 supporters of K√∏pi and also 300 police officers. Beforehand, the police had voiced concerns about violence, warning that the political situation was already tense after a solidarity demonstration for Ungdomshuset. The auction was this time successful, the building being sold for ‚Ç¨835,000 (half the estimated market value) to an agent of the new owner called Besnik Fichtner, an Albanian managing director of the company Plutonium 114. He also bought two neighbouring properties for ‚Ç¨900,000. The actual new owner was the company Novum K√∂penicker Stra√üe 133-138 GmbH. Other sources reported the new owner as the previously unknown company VKB GmbH & Co. KG. The Versicherungskammer Bayern in M√ºnich and the Volkskreditbank in Linz were forced to deny they had anything to do with the company, despite having the same initials as it. K√∏pi was immediately threatened with eviction. After one week, the K√∏pi residents had uncovered a paper trail leading to Berlin-based real estate developer Siegfried Nehls. They visited Nehls' parents unannounced and his father invited them to drink tea before Nehls' brother called the police. After one month, the police raided Nehls' headquarters (named as Vitalis Beteiligungsgesellschaft f√ºr Altbauten mbH) and twenty other properties, investigating financial irregularities. By 2008, Fichtner had fallen out with Nehls and signed a 30 year rental contract with the inhabitants of K√∏pi. There had been no actual signed agreement between Plutonium 114 and Nehls, so Fichtner was entitled to make a contract. However, Fichtner then fell into debt and Commerzbank again called for a forced auction of K√∏pi in 2013. There were also several auctions related to the wagenplatz, which was not covered by the new rental agreement.  Activities  There were 50 people living in the house in 2016 and 50 in the wagenplatz, a yard next to the house where people lived in vehicles and wagons. In addition to being a housing project, the building hosted a variety of activities, including a bar, vegan caf√©, concert venue, cinema, infoshop, gym, printing workshop, rehearsal space and a climbing wall. The project is run by a weekly plenary which takes place on Sundays. Only inhabitants of K√∂pi and members of projects using the space are allowed to attend. No mobile phones are permitted. A report by the Senate Department of Internal Affairs and the police in 2017 stated that \\"in general, it can be determined that the object K√∂pi 137 serves both as a retreat for left-motivated criminals and as a starting point for crimes.\\" In response, a K√∏pi spokesperson stated that \\"the presence of police on our site is often met with hostility, the parking of tourist buses and structural changes in the area are perceived as an expression of gentrification processes. Displeasure about these things occasionally results in criminally relevant actions.\\"  See also  * Hafenstra√üe * Kunsthaus Tacheles * Rote Flora  References   Bibliography        External links  * Official website Category:Buildings and structures in Mitte Category:1990 establishments in Germany Category:Squats in Germany Category:Legalized squats ","title":"K√∏pi"},{"id":"62659681","text":"John Stephen Benezet (22 Jun 1683, Abbeville - 4 Apr 1751, Germantown) was a French Huguenot refugee who fled France first to Rotterdam, then London before settling in Germantown, Pennsylvania, USA He was the son of Jean Benezet and Marie Madeleine Testart In 1715 he left France after all his goods had been seized.

Saviola (July 13, 1945 ‚Äì November 23, 2019) was an American disability rights activist, executive director of the Center for the Independence of the Disabled in New York from 1983 to 1999, and vice president of Independence Care System after 2000. Saviola, a polio survivor from Manhattan, New York, is known nationally within the disability rights movement for her advocacy for people with disabilities and had accepted many awards and honors for her work.  Early life and education  On July 13, 1945, Saviola was born in Manhattan at the New York Hospital. Her parents, Peter Saviola and Camilla 'Millie' Saviola, who had no other children, were Italian immigrants who ran a candy shop/luncheonette in the Bronx. In August 1955, a few weeks after her tenth birthday, Saviola contracted polio. She was hospitalized at Willard Parker Hospital, a communicable disease hospital, and placed in an iron lung for two months. The polio caused her quadriplegia; she used a wheelchair and a ventilator. Because her family's home was not accessible, Saviola lived at Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island during her teen years. Saviola was part of creating the hospital's ward for young adult patients, with more age-appropriate routines, activities and outings. She attended Long Island University, earning a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1970. For her freshman year, she and another Goldwater patient attended classes remotely, by telephone, and took tests by mail, an arrangement \\"believed to be the first of its kind used in a hospital in the state\\". She later earned a master's degree in rehabilitation counseling from New York University. She met activist Judy Heumann at LIU, where they were both students.  Career  Saviola was a rehabilitation counselor for 11 years at Goldwater Memorial Hospital in the 1970s and early 1980s. While working at Goldwater Memorial, Saviola assisted individuals with severe physical disabilities and helped them with transitioning from living in the hospital to living in the community. She was executive director of the Center for the Independence of the Disabled in New York from 1983 to 1998,\\"Walk For Justice To Protest Pataki Budget On Anniversary Of Dr. King's Assassination\\" New York Beacon (April 14, 1995): 2. via ProQuest and vice president of Independence Care System after 2000. She chaired the Manhattan Borough Disability Advisory Group, and served on the boards of the Association of Independent Living Centers in New York, Disabled in Action, and the New York City Medicaid Managed Care Task Force. Saviola worked for state legislation to support community living and independence for disabled New Yorkers. Saviola had particular interest in disabled women's rights and health issues. In 1979, she spoke at one of the first conferences on disabled women's lives, sponsored by the New York City Commission on the Status of Women and the Mayor's Office for the Handicapped. Her fellow speakers included disability rights activists Sandra Schnur, Maria Nardone, and Frieda Zames. Her advocacy work was credited in 2019 at the opening of a new radiology unit at NYC Health + Hospitals' Morrisania location in the Bronx, which featured accessible examination tables and mammography equipment. In 2015, she received the Henry Viscardi Achievement Award for her lifetime of work in disability rights and in 2017, the New York State Disability Rights Hall of Fame inducted Saviola as part of their inaugural class of inductees.  Personal life  On November 23, 2019, Saviola died at her home in Brooklyn at age 74 years. At the time Robert Geraghty was her long-term partner. An oral history interview with Saviola, about her life and activism, was recorded in 2001, is archived with the Disability Rights and Independent Living Movement (DRILM) Oral History Project at the Bancroft Library in Berkeley, California.

Owen, later identified as Artemus Ogletree, died at a hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, United States of beating and stabbing injuries. His death was preceded by a two-day stay in Room 1046 at the Hotel President in the city's Power & Light District marked by communication with someone named \\"Don\\", and unusual behavior and incidents noted by the hotel's staff, before he was found wounded in his room the morning of his death. When no next of kin could be located, leading to suspicions that his name was an alias, his body was stored in a local funeral parlor for almost two months. A planned burial in the city's potter's field was averted when an anonymous donor provided funds for a funeral and a floral arrangement signed \\"Louise\\". The man's true identity remained unknown for a year and a half until Ruby Ogletree, an Alabama woman who had seen a photo of a distinctive scar on his head in the news, identified him as her son Artemus. She said he had left Birmingham in 1934 at the age of 17 to hitchhike to California. Later she received two letters purportedly from him, some from as far away as Egypt. In August 1935 a caller claiming to be from Memphis, Tennessee told her that Artemus was in Cairo. The letters had also been sent after Artemus's death. Records kept by shipping companies found no records that Ogletree had gone to Egypt. No other suspect has ever been identified. The letters later were used to link the killing to a 1937 murder in New York, but no charges were filed against the man arrested in that case, one of whose aliases had been \\"Donald Kelso\\". The FBI later investigated but was unable to produce any new leads. In 2012, a historian at the Kansas City Public Library wrote two posts on the library's blog about the case. At the end of the last one he revealed that in 2003 or 2004, he had taken a call from someone out of state related to the case. The caller said that they had been helping to inventory the belongings of a recently deceased elderly person when they found a box with newspaper clippings about the Ogletree case and an item mentioned repeatedly in the stories, but they refused to say what that item was. The Kansas City police continue to investigate. Biography Artemus Ogletree was born in Florida in 1915, one of three children. During his childhood an accident with some hot grease left a sizable scar on his head above his ear, which remained hairless afterward. In 1934 he left his family, by then living in Birmingham, Alabama, to hitchhike to California. He kept them updated on his progress by mail; they wired him money. President Hotel stay alt=A 14-story brick building against a clear blue sky, seen from a block away. Its upper- and lowermost sections are ornate. Early on the afternoon of January 2, 1935, Ogletree walked into the Hotel President, in the Power & Light District of Kansas City, Missouri, and asked for an interior room several floors up, giving his name as Roland T. Owen, with a Los Angeles address. Staff remembered him as dressed well and wearing a dark overcoat; he brought no bags with him. Ogletree paid for one night. The staff noted that in addition to the visible scar on his temple, he had cauliflower ear, and concluded he was probably a boxer or professional wrestler. They believed him to be in his early 20s. Randolph Propst, a bellhop, accompanied Ogletree up in the elevator to the 10th floor. On the way, Ogletree told him that he had spent the previous night at the nearby Muehlebach Hotel but found the $5 ($ in current dollars) nightly rate too high. Propst opened Room 1046, which per the guest's request was on the inside, overlooking the hotel's courtyard rather than the street outside. He watched as Ogletree took a hairbrush, comb and toothpaste from his overcoat pocket, the extent of his unpacking. After Ogletree put those items above the sink, he and Propst left the room. The bellboy returned to lock it, and gave Ogletree the key. After returning to the lobby, he saw Ogletree leave the hotel. A short time afterward, Mary Soptic, one of the hotel maids, returned from a day off to work the afternoon shift. She went into Room 1046 and was surprised to find Ogletree there, since the previous night a woman had been in the room. She apologized, but he said she could go ahead and clean the room. While she did, she noticed that he had the shades drawn and left only one dim lamp on. This would remain the case when she encountered Ogletree in the room on other occasions during his stay. \\"He was either worried about something or afraid\\" in addition to this preference for low light, she told police later. After she had been cleaning for a few minutes, Ogletree put his overcoat on and brushed his hair. He then left, but asked her to leave the room unlocked as he was expecting some friends in a few minutes. Soptic did as he asked. At 4 p.m., she returned to the room with freshly laundered towels. Inside, the room was dark. She saw Ogletree lying on the bed, fully dressed. Visible in the light from the hallway was a note on his bedside table that read \\"Don: I will be back in fifteen minutes. Wait\\". =January 3= The next morning, Soptic returned to Room 1046 around 10:30. The door was locked, which led her to assume that Ogletree was out since it could only be locked from the outside, but when she opened it with her own key Ogletree was present, sitting in the dark just where he had been the previous afternoon. The phone rang and he answered it. \\"No, Don, I don't want to eat. I am not hungry. I just had breakfast ... No, I am not hungry\\", he said. Still holding the phone, Ogletree asked Soptic about her job as she cleaned. He wanted to know if she was responsible for the entire floor, and if the President was residential. He repeated his complaint about the Muehlebach's exorbitant rates, after which she finished cleaning, and left. Again at 4 p.m., Soptic returned with fresh towels. Inside Room 1046, she could hear two men talking, so she knocked. A voice she described as loud and deep, probably not Ogletree's, asked who it was. She responded that she had brought fresh towels, to which the voice said \\"We don't need any\\". Yet Soptic knew there were no towels in the room, as she had taken them herself in the morning. Two hours later, Jean Owen of Lee's Summit, near Kansas City, checked into the President after having shopped in the city for a few hours. Feeling sick, she had decided not to drive back home that night. She was given Room 1048; her boyfriend, who worked in a flower shop in the city, came to visit her there at 9:20 p.m. and stayed for two hours. Later that night, she told police, she heard men and women talking loudly and profanely all over the floor. Owen was not the only person to note unusual late night activity on the President's 10th floor. Elevator operator Charles Blocher, who began his shift at midnight, reported later that he was fairly busy until 1:30 a.m. After that time, most of the hotel quieted down for the night, except for a loud party in Room 1055. Blocher recalled one visitor in particular, a woman he had seen at the hotel visiting male guests in their rooms on other occasions and thus believed to be a prostitute, a conclusion shared by other hotel staff who were familiar with her. She came in first sometime during his first three hours; he took her to the 10th floor where she asked about Room 1026. Five minutes later, the elevator was summoned there again; it turned out to be the same woman, who expressed puzzlement that her client was not in Room 1046 since, she said, he had called her and on previous visits with him he had always been present. She wondered if, in fact, he was in Room 1024 since she could see through the room's transom window that the light was on in there. She remained on the floor after the conversation. A half-hour later, Blocher got another signal to take the elevator back to the 10th floor. The woman was waiting again and he took her down to the lobby. An hour later he took her, and a different man, to the 9th floor. At 4:15 a.m., a call from that floor turned out to be the woman; he took her to the lobby and she left the hotel for the night. Another call to the 9th floor 15 minutes later turned out to be the man who had come up with her. He told Blocher he could not sleep and was going out for a walk. Possible encounter outside hotel Whether these activities are related to the Ogletree case has not been established. He may not have been at the hotel earlier that night. At 11 p.m. Robert Lane, a city worker driving on 13th Street near Lydia Avenue, saw a man dressed in only an undershirt, pants and shoes run into his path and flag him down. When Lane stopped, the man apologized, saying he had taken Lane's car for a taxi. The man asked Lane if he could take him to somewhere he might be able to get a taxi. Lane agreed and let the man in. \\"You look as if you've been in it bad\\", he observed; the man swore he would kill someone else tomorrow, presumably in retaliation for whatever had been done to him. In the mirror Lane saw a deep scratch on the man's arm; he also noticed that he was cupping his arm, possibly to catch blood from a more severe wound. At the nearby intersection of 12th Street and Troost Avenue, where taxi drivers often waited for fares during the overnight hours, Lane stopped and let the man out. The man thanked him, got out, and honked the horn of a taxi parked nearby, drawing the driver from a nearby restaurant, after which Lane drove away. After Ogletree's death, Lane went to view the body. He saw the same scratch on the arm and went to the police, telling them he believed Ogletree had been the man he picked up. =January 4= At 7 a.m., a new switchboard operator, Della Ferguson, came on shift. She was preparing to make a requested wakeup call to Room 1046 when she noticed a light indicating that the phone there was off the hook. Propst, who had led Ogletree there two days earlier, was on shift again and drew the assignment. The door to Room 1046 was locked, with a \\"Do Not Disturb\\" sign hanging from the doorknob. After several loud knocks, a voice from inside told him to enter; however he could not as the door had been locked. The same voice told him, after another knock, to turn on the lights, but he still could not enter. Finally, Propst just shouted through the door to hang the phone up, and left. Propst told Ferguson that the guest in Room 1046 was probably drunk and she should wait another hour. At 8:30 a.m., the phone had still not been hung up. Another bellboy, Harold Pike, was sent to the 10th floor. The \\"Do Not Disturb\\" sign was still on the door, and it was still locked, but Pike had a key and let himself in. Inside he found Ogletree in the dark, lying on the bed naked, apparently drunk. The light from the hallway showed some dark spots on the bedding, but rather than turn on the room light Pike went to the telephone stand, where he saw the phone had been knocked to the floor. He put it back on the stand, replacing the handset. Shortly after 10:30 a.m., another operator reported that the phone in Room 1046 was once again off the hook. Again Propst was sent to the room to see what was going on; the \\"Do Not Disturb\\" sign remained on the knob. This time he had a key, and after his knocks drew no response, he opened the door and found Ogletree on his knees and elbows two feet (60 cm) away, his head bloodied. Propst turned the light on, put the phone back on the hook, and then noticed blood on the walls of both the main room and bathroom, as well as on the bed itself. Propst went downstairs immediately for help. He returned with the assistant manager, but when they did they could only open the door six inches (15 cm), as Ogletree had in the interim fallen on the floor. Eventually Ogletree got up and when the two hotel employees were able to enter the room, he went and sat on the edge of the bathtub. The assistant manager called the police; they were joined by Dr. Harold Flanders of Kansas City General Hospital. Ogletree had been bound with cord around his neck, wrists, and ankles. His neck had further bruising, suggesting someone had been attempting to strangle him. He had been stabbed more than once in the chest above the heart; one of these wounds had punctured his lung. Blows to his head had left him with a skull fracture on the right side. In addition to the blood Propst had seen, there was some additional spatter on the ceiling. Dr. Flanders cut the cords from Ogletree's wrist and asked him who had done this to him. \\"Nobody\\", Ogletree answered. Asked, then, what had caused these injuries, he said he had fallen and hit his head on the bathtub. The doctor asked if he had been trying to kill himself. After saying no, Ogletree lost consciousness and was taken to the hospital. He was completely comatose by the time he arrived and died shortly after midnight on January 5. Investigation The Kansas City Police Department (KCPD) began investigating immediately by interviewing Jean Owen, whose identical last name and proximity to the dead man overnight struck them as interesting. They detained her while she told them what she had heard the night before. After her boyfriend came to the police station and corroborated her account, she was released and returned to Lee's Summit. =Cause of death= Doctors performed an autopsy on Ogletree and determined he had died from his wounds. Dr. Flanders had examined not just the body but the bloodstains in the room. Since much of it had dried by the time he had arrived, he estimated the wounds had been inflicted between 4 and 5 a.m. that day, consistent with what Pike had seen and before Propst's first visit. Detectives searching Room 1046 took note as much of what they did not find as what they did. Consistent with what Propst had observed, there were no clothes in the closets or drawers. The only evidence of anything other than what Ogletree had been wearing was the tag of a necktie, indicating it had been made by a New Jersey company. Also missing from the room were the soap, shampoo, and towels provided by the hotel to every room. There were no knives, which led to the dismissal of suicide as a cause of Ogletree's death since the stab wounds in his chest could not be accounted for; the cords tying him up also suggested the involvement of others. One of the room's two glasses was found in the sink, missing a piece; the other was on the shelf. Detectives found some other items that might have been evidence: a hairpin, safety pin, unsmoked cigarette, and a full bottle of diluted sulfuric acid. Four fingerprints, small enough that detectives believed they had been a woman's, were found on the room's phone; they could not be matched to Ogletree or to any of the hotel employees who had been known to have entered the room. The police sought help through the press. Both of the city's evening newspapers carried the story on their front pages the next day. \\"There is no doubt that someone else is mixed up in this\\", Detective Johnson told reporters, confirming that the case was considered a homicide. Identity It soon became apparent that \\"Roland T. Owen\\" was in all likelihood an alias. Officers in Kansas City contacted the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) to notify next of kin, but were informed that they could find no record that anyone under that name was living in the California city at the time. The dead man's fingerprints were sent to what was at the time the Justice Department's Bureau of Investigation (later the FBI) to find a possible match in their collection. A woman called the Hotel President that night to ask what \\"Roland T. Owen\\" looked like. She told the desk that he lived in Clinton, southeast of Kansas City. On January 6, the Sunday newspapers reported that the man in Room 1046 had died under an assumed name, and tips began coming in. Members of the public went to the local funeral home where he had been laid out, leading Lane to tell police of his encounter with the man. After interviewing Lane, Johnson was not as certain as Lane was that the man had been Ogletree, since none of the hotel staff had reported seeing him leave or return during the night of January 3‚Äì4. Police were able to establish one sighting of Ogletree outside the hotel, a report that he had been seen with two women at several \\"liquor places\\" on 12th Street. Wire services began picking up the story, and it ran in newspapers and on radio around the country, with requests to send photographs to Kansas City. More leads on the man's identity came in as a result, and the KCPD had to devote considerable time to corresponding with police all over the country via mail and telegram to follow up on leads. Eventually they were able to eliminate many. In Kansas City, an early lead proved false when a bloodied towel found at the hotel turned out to have been used to clean up Room 1046 after the police had left. Officers recalled Propst's account that on his way there after he checked in, the man had said that he had left the nearby Muehlebach Hotel after one night due to their high rates, and checked with that hotel's staff. No Roland T. Owen had checked in there, but staff recalled a man of Ogletree's appearance checking in under the name Eugene K. Scott, also giving Los Angeles as his address, and requesting a room on the interior of the building. Again, after investigating, the LAPD reported that there was no one by that name in their city. The mystery seemed solved when a man identified the body as his cousin, but then when the man's sister came to view the body, she confirmed that the cousin had in fact died five years earlier; the resemblance between the two had been very strong. A week into the investigation, Toni Bernardi, a wrestling promoter from Little Rock, Arkansas, said after viewing the body that the man, identifying himself as Cecil Werner, had approached him around the beginning of December 1934 about wrestling some matches. Bernardi had referred him to another promoter in Omaha, Nebraska, but that promoter did not recognize Ogletree. Within a few days, two new homicides in the city drew detectives' attention away from the case, even as more were assigned to the homicide squad. Leads were still followed, but less vigorously than they had been in the week after the case, and none of them yielded any significant information. Newspaper coverage likewise dwindled. Funeral The case returned to the newspapers on March 3, when the funeral home where the body had been kept announced it would be burying the man in the city's potter's field the next day. That day, the funeral home received a call from a man who asked that the funeral be delayed so they could send the funeral home the money for a grave and service at Memorial Park Cemetery in Kansas City, Kansas, so, the caller said, the dead man would be near his sister. The funeral director warned the caller he would have to tell the police about the call; the caller said he knew and that did not bother him. The caller was slightly more forthcoming when the funeral director asked why Ogletree had been killed. According to the caller, Ogletree had had an affair with one woman while engaged to marry another. The caller and the two women had apparently arranged the encounter with him at the President in order to exact revenge. \\"Cheaters usually get what's coming to them!\\" the caller said, and hung up. The service was postponed per the anonymous caller's request. On March 23, the funeral home received a delivery envelope, the address carefully lettered using a ruler with $25 ($ in current dollars) wrapped in newspaper; it was enough to cover the expenses. The sender was unknown. Two additional envelopes with $5 each were sent to a local florist for an arrangement of 13 American Beauty roses to go with the grave, after a similar call was made to them; both phone calls turned out to have been made from pay phones. Included with this payment was a card, with disguised handwriting, reading \\"Love Forever ‚Äì Louise\\". The funeral was held shortly afterwards. Besides the officiating minister, the only attendees were police detectives, some of whom served as pallbearers. Other detectives, posing as gravediggers, staked out the grave for the next several days, but no one came to visit. Several days after the funeral, a woman called the Kansas City Journal-Posts newsroom to inform them that their earlier story that the dead man from Room 1046 would be buried in a pauper's grave was incorrect, that he had in fact been given a formal funeral. She said the funeral home and flower shop could verify this. Asked to identify herself, she said \\"Never mind, I know what I'm talking about\\", Pressed for what that was, she responded, \\"He got into a jam\\", and ended the conversation. Identification Images of the dead man continued to be circulated nationwide in the hope of identifying him. One of these finally did, when a friend of Ruby Ogletree in Birmingham, Alabama, showed her an issue of The American Weekly, a Sunday newspaper supplement published by the Hearst Corporation, with an article about the case. The unidentified man looked a great deal like her son Artemus, whom the family had not seen since he left to hitchhike to California in 1934, although he had kept up correspondence with them. Ruby contacted the KCPD, and was able to provide enough information about the previous pseudonymous corpse, including a description of his head scar, which she explained was the result of a childhood accident in which some hot grease had spilled there. In November, another issue of the supplement carried a story identifying the man as Artemus Ogletree and explaining how his identity had been determined. While that question had been answered, Ruby's account raised more questions. She had received several letters purportedly from her son after he had been killed. The first, early in 1935, postmarked in Chicago, aroused her suspicions since it was typewritten, and Artemus as far as she knew did not know how to type. It was also written in a highly colloquial style, with much slang, that was not consistent with his previous letters. In May 1935, another letter purportedly from Artemus said he was going to Europe. It was followed by a special-delivery letter saying that his ship was sailing that day. Both missives were sent from New York. Three months later, in August, Ruby received a telephone call from Memphis, Tennessee. A man on the other end of the line told her that Artemus had saved his life in a fight. Artemus himself could not call because he was now living in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, where he had married a wealthy woman and was well. He was unable to write, the caller said, because he had lost one of his thumbs in the fight where he had saved the caller. Ruby talked with the man for a half-hour. She recalled that he had talked wildly and irrationally, but seemed to have firsthand knowledge of Artemus. She gave the police the name the man identified himself by; it has never been made public. If Artemus had, at some point before his death, gone to Egypt or anywhere else overseas, he had not done so under his own name. No steamship company at the time had any record that he had traveled with them. The consular section at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo was unable to find any evidence he had been there. Later developments Information developed through the police's conversations with Ruby Ogletree helped them establish a third hotel in Kansas City, the St. Regis, where Artemus had stayed. There, he had roomed with another man. Whether that had been \\"Don\\" could not be established. In 1937 the New York City police arrested a man named Joseph Martin on a murder charge, after he had killed a man he roomed with and put the body in a trunk to be shipped to Memphis. Among the several aliases he was found to have used was \\"Donald Kelso\\". According to a story about the case in The New Yorker, the KCPD had matched samples of his handwriting to that in the letters written to Ruby Ogletree. No charges were filed against the man for the Ogletree case, and the KCPD kept the case open. The files show that different detectives reviewed the case every few years through the 1950s. Each time they noted that they would keep the case open and follow up, but no new evidence was uncovered. Gradually the case went cold. In 2003 or 2004, John Horner, a local historian at the Kansas City Public Library, fielded a call from someone out of state who said they had been helping to inventory the belongings of an elderly person who had recently died. Among them was a shoebox which turned out to be filled with newspaper clippings related to the case, as well as, according to them, one item mentioned in the newspaper stories. The caller identified neither themselves nor the item. Horner did not make this public until the conclusion of the second of two posts he made on the library's blog retelling the story in 2012. Theories The absence of suspects has not prevented theories about the case from arising. The telephone calls alleging that Ogletree was killed in retaliation for his broken engagement have provided support for that theory. Organized crime has also been considered, since the name \\"Don\\" can also be a title for a Mafia boss. Lastly, it has been suggested that \\"Don\\", whoever he was, killed Ogletree for some personal reason, either with the help of the \\"commercial woman\\" Blocher saw in the hotel late that night or by himself.

Anderson studied at Bethany College in Lindsborg, Kansas and the Augustana Theological Seminary before being ordained by the Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church in 1912. He held a succession of posts in the American Mid West before volunteering for missionary service. Anderson was sent to the British colony of Tanganyika in 1924 to review the situation there. As a former German colony the territory had hosted missions of the German Lutheran Church but these were expelled in 1917 during the First World War. Anderson reported favourably and a formal Augustana Church mission was sent in 1926, with Anderson at its head. Anderson oversaw the expansion of the church's role in the territory and in 1944 was appointed President and director of its General Administrative Committee, becoming responsible for the church's entire operation in Tanganyika. He retired in 1956 and died in the United States two years later.  Early life  George Nathanael Anderson was born on August 8, 1883 in Morganville, Kansas. He graduated from Bethany College in Lindsborg, Kansas in 1909. He later graduated from the Augustana Theological Seminary; studied at the University of Minnesota and the Union Theological Seminary and was awarded a doctorate. Anderson was ordained as a pastor in 1912 and found work preaching in the Midwestern United States with the Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church. At one point he was at the First Lutheran Church in Saint Paul, Minnesota where he ministered to a congregation of over 1,500 people. In 1919 he was amongst a group of people praying at a church meeting for a new bible school to train Lutheran missionaries. Amongst the attendees was Annette Elmquist, who had attended a non-Lutheran bible school and was keen for the church to have its own. Soon afterwards Elmquist and Anderson were married.  Tanganyika  The Lutheran church had been active in missionary work in Tanganyika before the First World War, however the largely German missionaries were expelled by British forces in 1917. The Augustana Church was asked to take over the abandoned missions by the German Lutheran Church and in Summer 1924 Anderson with his wife and three sons (LeRoy. Paul and Marcus) visited the colony. Anderson reported good potential in the area and a formal mission was dispatched by the church in 1926, with Anderson being appointed a missionary by the church's Board of Foreign Missions. After some deliberation (he would have to leave behind his family, including daughter Dorothy who was then ill with tuberculosis) Anderson agreed and returned to Tanganyika on January 6, 1926 with fellow missionaries Herbert S Magney and Ludwig Melander. Anderson initially spent his time teaching new pastors at the mission's seminary in Marangu but reported to the church that there was a good appetite for the Lutheran faith in Iramba and it was decided to establish a mission there. Anderson was appointed head of the mission and led four American missionaries and one from Leipzig (who held Russian citizenship and so was permitted entry by the British authorities). Anderson's speciality was in evangelism and the study of the Iramba language, into which he translated the New Testament and various hymns, liturgies and catechisms . Anderson's wife and children joined him at Iramba from 1927 and remained with him until his retirement in 1956, though Annette would sometimes reside in the United States with some of the children to ensure their education. One son, Marcus, died in Iramba of Malaria. They had seven surviving children of which four sons became pastors, including one who was a missionary in Tanganyika. One of Anderson's daughters married a missionary and served for her entire life at a mission in Iramba. Anderson occasionally returned to the United States on leave and during these periods worked to generate support for the African missions. During one such visit he helped to found the Lutheran Bible Institute. From 1944 he was appointed president and director of the General Administrative Committee of the Augustana Lutheran Church (which until 1944 was known as the General Committee of Former German Missions). In this role, which he held until 1952, he was responsible for liaising with the Tanganyikan government. One key task was to negotiate with the colony's government over the ownership of land and property formerly held by the German Lutheran Church.

The story is about the teenaged David \\"Dave\\" Roberts, who becomes a fan of his local football club, Bromley F.C., a club who at the time were, \\"the worst football team in Britain\\". The film touches briefly on the euphoria caused by England winning the World Cup in 1966, but mainly recounts the events in the protagonist's life during the 1969/1970 season of the Bromley team.Movie Nation, Movie Review: Football is everything to the \\"Bromley Boys\\" by Roger Moore, August 6th, 2019, https://rogersmovienation.com/2019/08/06/movie-review-football-is-all-to-the- bromley-boys/The Guardian, Culture, Film, Movies, \\"The Bromley Boys review - 70's football Britcom shoots wide\\", Cath Clarke, Fri 1 June, 2018, 04.00 EDT, https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/01/the-bromley-boys- review-70s-football-britcom-shoots-wide Plot summary In the late 1960s, a young British teenager, David (Dave) Roberts (Brenock O'Connor), is living in his parents' house in Sevenoaks. He wishes to follow a major football (soccer) team, but because of his father's strong disapproval, he is forced into secretly following his local club, Bromley FC, who at that time were losing almost every game they played. Nonetheless, David instantly becomes a devoted fan. He attends, and carefully analyses every match, and keeps a scrapbook of every press mention they get, no matter how negative. His favorite player is the team's star, center forward Alan \\"Stoney\\" Stonebridge (Ross Anderson). David meets and become close friends with three adult Bromley FC fans (TJ Herbert, Mark Dymond, Ewen MacIntosh) who encourage and support him. Dave also meets, and rapidly falls in love with, Ruby McQueen (Savannah Baker), the pretty and bright teenage daughter of Charlie McQueen (Jamie Foreman), the tough scary Chairman of the football club. Having sneaked into Charlie McQueen's office, and noticed some notes on player's files, Dave believes that McQueen has received large cash offers from both Manchester United and Leeds United to sell Stoney away from Bromley. It seems to Dave that McQueen is planning to accept, in order to pay off his massive gambling debts, which have rendered the club bankrupt. Dave happens to accidentally meet Stoney, who turns out to be very kind, and strikes up a friendship with him. The news of the supposed offer to buy Stoney is leaked to the press. The Chairman see this news on television, and now imagines he will be able to pay off all his gambling debts and come out ahead. He announces the good news about Stoney at a party, and explains he can now afford to send his daughter Ruby to university to become a doctor, her dream. But Dave suddenly understands that he misinterpreted what he read: the notes he saw were not about cash offers from leading football clubs, instead they were about offers to Ruby from Manchester University and Leeds University. There will be no money coming in. In order to save Bromley, Dave browbeats the Chairman into selling his expensive sports car, and betting all of the cash on Bromley FC to win their final game of the season, at odds of 10 to 1. Dave also demands that the Chairman allow him to manage the team for this one final game. Despite Dave's attempts to suggest a new game plan, the first half of the game goes poorly, with Bromley scoring an own goal. But then Dave accidentally finds out that his father was originally a brilliant athlete who played youth soccer for England, before being crippled in an accident on the field  the source of his bitterness towards football. Before the Bromley team goes out for the second half, Dave gives an impassioned speech, which Stoney endorses, and which causes the team to play better than anyone would have thought possible. First a goal to draw the game is scored, and then Stoney manages to score a very challenging goal on a free kick, and Bromley FC wins 2-1. Dave is carried off the field in triumph, to joy all round.

Background  In early 1996, Emilio Estefan and EMI Latin president Jos√© Behar planned to bring together the most important Spanish-speaking artists and create material for the upcoming Olympic Games, as a reaction to several English-speaking artists that were preparing their albums for the Olympic Games. Estefan and Behar had a conversation about the project with Atlanta Olympic Games committee, among them marketing vice-president Lous Wayne Cunningham. Behar said \\"Hispanics, in Latin America and Spain, have different cultures and customs, but there is something spiritual that unites us, and that is the language\\".

Reign Though Pratap Manikya is stated in the Rajmala to be a son of Dharma Manikya I, later scholarship proved this to be chronologically improbable. It is instead believed that he was Dharma's grandson, with his father being Ratna Manikya I. There were also uncertainties regarding the years of Pratap's rule. A coin supposedly minted during his reign bears the year Saka 1412 (1490 CE), though the modern-style script has led to doubts regarding its authenticity. It is notable that Pratap's immediate successors struck coins in 1488 and 1489 respectively. A younger son of his father, Pratap's rule had been propped up by the support of prominent army generals in opposition to his elder brother Dhanya, against whom he waged a civil war. According to the Rajmala, because of his impiety, Pratap soon lost the support of these nobles, who launched a conspiracy against him. The chronicle continues that due to his formidable physical strength and stoutness, Pratap had to be killed at night while he slept. He was succeeded in quick succession by the minor Vijaya Manikya (who may have been his son) and Pratap's younger brother Mukut, before the throne finally settled on Dhanya, whose long reign lasted until 1515.

Gauthier (; April 14, 1943 ‚Äì December 12, 2001) was an attorney known for a variety of major class action lawsuits. He is best known for his leading role in Castano v. American Tobacco Company which established that large tobacco companies could be liable for injury to its users. The dramatic case was fictionalized into John Grisham's bestselling novel Runaway Jury and directly led to numerous other \\"Son of Costano\\" suits and the $246 billion Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, the largest settlement in history.  Early life  Wendell Gauthier was raised in Iota, Louisiana, a small town in the Acadiana region of Louisiana. His father was a construction foreman as well as a city councilman and his mother was a school teacher. His father managed Edwin Edward's first political campaign when Wendell was 11 and the two developed a close relationship. Gauthier graduated from Iota High School before earning an undergraduate degree from the University of Southwest Louisiana (Now University of Louisiana at Lafayette) where he met his future wife, Anne Barrios. He moved to New Orleans and taught high school, as well as driver's education across the metropolitan area while simultaneously earning his Juris Doctorate from the Loyola University New Orleans College of Law. He was the first member of his family to attend college. There he became best friends with Peter Castano whose death would trigger the start of the third wave of Tobacco litigation.  Legal Practice  Gauthier used his unsophisticated background to full effect in the courtroom, connecting with jurors through a \\"infectious, perpetual, coprophagous grin\\", \\"soft cajun accent\\", and numerous \\"country-lawyer malapropisms\\". Further, he complimented his casual style with pranks and showmanship influenced by Melvin Belli. Gauthier was also a coalition builder in a field that was normally extremely competitive and looked beyond his field to form close partnerships with politicians including dozens of city mayors including Mayor Marc Morial as well as Governor Edwin Edwards, and President Clinton. = Louisiana Gas Explosions = Wendell Gauthier's first notable cases were a series of seven gas explosions at homes in the metro area. Gauthier agreed to be part of a panel of experts that fixed the problem, preventing more explosions and therefore more lawsuits. Gauthier said that it \\"put me out of the gas pipe business, but I was glad to be a part of the panel\\". = MGM Grand Fire Litigation (1980) = The MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas caught fire November 21, 1980 with approximately 3,400 registered guests inside. Eighty-four people died and more than a thousand more suffered injury. Gauthier, along with a team of eight other named attorneys and their firms successfully reached a $170 million dollar settlement.  Illness and Death  Wendell Gauthier died in his home of Liver cancer Wednesday, December 12, 2001.  Legacy  Wendell Gauthier's daughter, Celeste Gauthier now continues the Gauthier name in the firm that Wendell founded in the 1970s and which still operates out of the same building. They undertake a variety of suits but have expanded, under the direction of managing partner John Houghtaling, to represent property owners against insurance companies. During his life, Wendell Gauthier served as a visiting member of his alma matar's faculty and after his death, Anne Gauthier donated a new 17,657 square foot wing to the law school. This was the largest gift the college ever received from an individual. The \\"family and friends of Mr. Gauthier\\" also established the Wendell H. Gauthier Lectureship in Trial Advocacy and Practice at Tulane University's Law School. The Wendell and Anne Gauthier Family Foundation supports \\"music, visual arts, and Catholic education\\". The foundation funds the Peter J. Castano Endowed Scholarship and the Michael St. Martin Chair in Environmental Law at Loyola New Orleans. The foundation also supports the Musical Arts Society of New Orleans, the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra , and the George Rodrigue Foundation. The family foundation purchased the Saga of the Acadians in order to allow it to tour throughout the Acadiana and the rest of the state.  In Popular Culture  Wendell Gauthier is portrayed as Wendell Rohr in John Grisham's bestselling 1996 novel Runaway Jury as well as the movie adaptation. The novel uses the Castano v. American Tobacco Company case as its setting while the movie, released in 2003 substitutes gun control as the issue being litigated. Celeste Wood, another major character, may be named for Wendell's daughter Celeste.

The mountain's name was adopted in 1906, then re-approved September 8, 1932, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. It was so-named by the survey party because of its proximity above Bear Creek (since renamed Connaught Creek), and in keeping with the bear theme of other nearby features such as Ursus Minor Mountain, Grizzly Mountain, Bruins Pass, and Balu Pass.

Uncommitted at the beginning of the American Revolution, he was recruited by Lord Dunmore to become a Loyalist privateer. By his own estimation, he destroyed five hundred vessels in the service of the British Crown.  Family  Goodrich was born in Virginia in 1722, one of several children of John Goodrich (d. 1746). Unlike many Loyalists, Goodrich had deep roots in colonial America; his immigrant ancestor, \\"John Guttreidge\\", had patented land in Virginia in 1654.Boddie, John Bennett, \\"Seventeenth Century Isle of Wight County, Virginia\\", pp. 222-4 In 1747 he married the descendant of another prominent local family, Margaret Bridger, a descendant of the 17th-century Virginia political figure General Joseph Bridger.Boddie pg. 430 They raised a large family, including a number of sons that would follow their father into mercantile pursuits and, later, privateering. One of his daughters, Agatha, married Robert Shedden, who would also become a prominent Loyalist as well as Goodrich's business partner.Virginia Historical Society, \\"Collections of the Virginia Historical Society, Vol. 10\\", pg. 46 Some of his close relatives ended up on the opposite side of the conflict, including two nephews who served as officers on the Patriot side.  Before the Revolution  A keen businessman, Goodrich spent his early adult years expanding his landholdings. Over the course of several years, he purchased hundreds of acres of land in Nansemond and Isle of Wight counties. By 1771 he owned over 2,000 acres of land, some of it described as the best land in the county. Starting in the 1760s, he began to turn his interest from farming to shipping. He and his sons owned and operated a dozen ships by 1774, and Goodrich also owned his own wharves, dry goods stores, warehouses, and other establishments useful to his shipping business. Operating primarily out of Portsmouth, his small fleet shipped agricultural and timber commodities to the West Indies and to other ports in the colonies.Curtis, George M. ‚ÄúThe Goodrich Family and the Revolution in Virginia, 1774-1776.‚Äù The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, vol. 84, no. 1, 1976, pp. 49‚Äì74. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4248008.  Early Revolutionary War activities  The Revolutionary War posed a serious threat to merchants like Goodrich, with blockades cutting off imports and exports, and privateers from both sides attacking merchant vessels. Goodrich himself does not seem to have been particularly ideological; both sides of the conflict apparently understood he was more motivated by profit than politics. Regardless, the Patriot side decided to enlist the aid of the Goodrich family. Using one of Goodrich's sons, William, as a go-between, they provided ¬£5,000 for the purchase of powder in the West Indies, with the understanding that John Goodrich, the father, would assist him in successfully bringing the cargo back without attracting notice. The family elected to also purchase other cargo on the trip, risking the wrath of both the British and Patriot sides. This mission proved to be a debacle for the Goodriches. Though the powder did reach its destination, an intercepted letter to John Goodrich from his son-in-law Robert Shedden revealed the conspiracy to Dunmore, who took Shedden and another of Goodrich's sons into custody. With John Goodrich, Jr., held as hostage, the elder John Goodrich sought an audience with Dunmore, where he expressed \\"sincere repentance of what was past and his earnest desire of returning to his duty\\". Though he recognized Goodrich's essentially mercenary character, Dunmore seized the opportunity to augment British forces with a family of experienced, capable, and ambitious ship captains. Having been convinced that his family's interests would be better served by the British, Goodrich and his family turned to the Loyalist cause. The start of Goodrich's career as a Loyalist was not auspicious. He set out to the West Indies to reclaim some of the money that had been left with a merchant there to purchase additional powder, but was quickly captured by British forces unaware of his new loyalties and promptly sent back to Dunmore. The Patriots were, likewise, initially confused regarding his loyalties. He was actually imprisoned by the Commonwealth of Virginia, which suspected him \\"of being unfriendly to the Colony\\", but when witnesses failed to appear he was released on a bond of ¬£1,000 and the condition that he not be of assistance to America's enemies.Tormey, James, \\"The Virginia Navy in the Revolution\\", pg. 57 Goodrich and two of his sons were almost immediately charged again, this time with violating the Articles of Association. On 9 March 1776, the Virginia Committee of Safety sequestered the lands and property of the Goodrich family, and when one of the Goodrich sons was caught attempting to transport slaves and stock from the sequestered property, the committee had the property confiscated and put up for auction. This marked a decisive break with the Patriot side; General Charles Lee ordered Goodrich's house, as well as two of his ships, burned, justifying it on the grounds that Goodrich was one \\"of the most notorious Traitors\\", and that it would be a warning to others not to work with Dunmore.  Loyalist privateer  Under his agreement with Dunmore, Goodrich's ships had been commissioned directly into government service, and he and his sons became some of the most notorious of the Loyalist privateers. He was captured in North Carolina on 17 April 1776 while engaged in privateering, and by May was in a Virginia jail. Being found guilty of treason, his entire estate was confiscated and he was imprisoned under guard, effectively a prisoner of war. His sons vehemently rejected the committee's offer of neutrality and continued in royal service, with one joining Simcoe's Rangers, and John Goodrich himself returned to privateering after escaping prison. Later in the war, Goodrich's privateering operation moved to New York, and grew over the course of the war to four fighting vessels; the largest, The Dunmore, was a sixteen-gun ship.Tormey pg. 98  After the war  After the war, Goodrich and several of his family members left the United States and settled in England. He died in November of 1785, aged 63 years, and was interred at Topsham Church in Devon. Edmund Randolph, in his History of Virginia, remarked regarding Goodrich and his sons that \\"Virginia never repaired the loss which she sustained in these men.\\" In England, the descendants of John Goodrich were known as the Goodriches of Energlyn. His son John Goodrich, Jr. was High Sheriff of Glamorganshire in 1798, while another descendant, James Pitt Goodrich, was High Sheriff of Denbighshire in 1878.\\"Genealogies of Virginia Families\\", pg. 22 His Shedden descendants prospered as well; they lived for several generations at their estate at Spring Hill, East Cowes.

Early life and education  Dale started his graduate studies in biblical theology at Western Theological Seminary in Portland, Oregon, however he never graduated and currently has no degree from any seminary or school.  Career  In his early days, Partridge pursued a baseball career which ended early due to an arm injury. He quickly switched to entrepreneurship and eventually founded Sevenly.org and StartupCamp.com. At Sevenly, he experimented with social/charitable cause-based business ecosystems by using art and fashion to raise funds and awareness for a new charity every week. Eventually, the business model of Sevenly was featured by several reporting outlets including Entrepreneur Magazine. Dale has been featured in various business and editorial publications, including the cover of Entrepreneur Magazine, INC Magazine, Mashable, Forbes and the Los Angeles Times. He has also appeared on FOX News, Today, and other various talk shows. Prior to entering into the ministry, Partridge was a businessman and wrote People over Profit published by Thomas Nelson, which became a Wall Street Journal bestseller.

Stokes (1 April 1927 - 26 January 1997) was an American political scientist and dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Stokes was a founder of public opinion research, and a coauthor of the seminal book The American Voter. Early life and education Stokes was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on April 1, 1927. He obtained a bachelor's degree from Princeton University in 1951, and a PhD from Yale University in 1958. Career Stokes began to work at the University of Michigan in 1958. There he collaborated with fellow University of Michigan social scientists Angus Campbell, Philip Converse, and Warren Miller to write The American Voter, which was one of the first major empirical studies of voting behavior. Through thousands of interviews with American citizens during the election periods in 1948, 1952, 1954, 1956 and 1958, the authors first identified several of the core results in voting behavior that would form the Michigan model. These include the importance of party identification, the low information level of many voters, and the large number of voters who remain undecided until immediately before an election. In 1966, Campbell, Converse, Miller, and Stokes followed The American Voter with another book, Elections and the Political Order. Stokes studied the politics of the United Kingdom as well as American politics; he and David Butler conducted the first British Election Study, and coauthored the 1969 book Political Change in Britain. In 1971, Stokes became the dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies at the University of Michigan. He held that position until 1974, when he moved to Princeton University. At Princeton, he became the dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, which expanded significantly under his oversight. Towards the end of his career, Stokes published the book Pasteur's Quadrant, which studied the connection between basic science, applied science, and government policies. Stokes is one of the most cited political scientists of all time, and is widely regarded as a founding scholar in the empirical study of political behavior. Harold Tafler Shapiro, who was president of the University of Michigan and then of Princeton University, called Stokes \\"a pioneer in the development of modern political science\\".

Background In 2009, the Palestine Authority lodged an ad hoc declaration to the ICC accepting the jurisdiction of the Court for crimes committed since 2002. Almost three years later, the Office of the Prosecutor decided not to open an investigation on the situation in Palestine until the Assembly of States parties of the Court or the United Nations gave clarification on the statehood issue of Palestine. On 29 November 2012,UN General Assembly resolution 67/19 passed, upgrading Palestine to \\"non-member observer state\\" status in the United Nations. The change in status was described as \\"de facto recognition of the sovereign state of Palestine\\". In a 2014 opinion piece, the Prosecutor said that, as a result of this new status, Palestine could now join the Rome Statute. A preliminary investigation had been ongoing since 2015. Israel is not a member of ICC, but the State of Palestine was allowed to join in 2015. Israel has argued that the court has no jurisdiction because Palestine is not a sovereign state, as Israeli attorney general Avichai Mandelblit argued in a brief released hours before Bensouda's announcement. On three previous occasions, Bensouda has refused to open investigations against Israel related to the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid. Report According to Bensouda, the criteria for a full investigation had all been met, but jurisdiction had not been established. Bensouda stated, \\"I am satisfied that war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip\\". According to Bensouda's report, the Israeli judicial system already makes provision for punishing those accused of war crimes‚Äîmeaning that the ICC may not have jurisdiction over alleged Israeli violations; Bensouda wrote that she will have to keep reviewing the ‚Äúscope and genuineness of relevant domestic proceedings‚Äù that remain ongoing. Bensouda also found \\"a reasonable basis to believe that members of Hamas and Palestinian armed groups\\" are guilty of war crimes, but these groups have no mechanism for punishing such violations. Israel is accused of illegally establishing West Bank settlements and violating the laws of war during the 2014 Gaza War, including claims of targeting Red Cross installations. Armed Palestinian organizations, including Hamas, are accused of deliberately attacking Israeli civilians and using Palestinians as human shields. Developments Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the investigation as \\"a black day for truth and justice\\" and \\"pure antisemitism\\", while Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth denounced \\"The Hague's hypocrisy\\" in a headline. In an interview with Times of Israel Bensouda described the charge of antisemitism as \\"a particularly regrettable accusation that is without merit\\" and emphasized that the court strives to be fair and impartial. United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated, \\"We firmly oppose this and any other action that seeks to target Israel unfairly.\\" Australia argued that the issues should be resolved by negotiation, while Germany stated that it trusts the court and wants to avoid politicising the case. Hungary announced that it agrees with Israel's arguments about jurisdiction. The Palestinian Authority issued a statement declaring that \\"Palestine welcomes this step as a long overdue step to move the process forward towards an investigation, after nearly five long and difficult years of preliminary examination\\". On 16 March 2020, following the submission of amicus curiae briefs, Bensouda requested another month to weigh the question of Palestinian statehood and jurisdiction over the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. About 50 countries and NGOs have filed such briefs for consideration and on April 29, 2020, over 180 Palestinian and international organizations, and individuals filed an open letter in support of Palestine. On 30 April, 2020, Bensouda stood by her initial finding, writing \\"The Prosecution has carefully considered the observations of the participants and remains of the view that the Court has jurisdiction over the Occupied Palestinian Territory,\\"Prosecution Response to the Observations of Amici Curiae, Legal Representatives of Victims, and States Further reading Nathaniel Berman, 'Jerusalem before the International Courts: Utopias 2020', http://opiniojuris.org/2020/08/10/jerusalem-before-the-international- courts-utopias-2020/ External links *ICC - Preliminary examination State of Palestine *B'tselem reaction to Mandelblit position paper References Category:Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict Category:December 2019 events Category:International Criminal Court investigations Category:Politics of the State of Palestine ","title":"International Criminal Court investigation in Palestine"},{"id":"62661103","text":"Bronwyn Katz (born 1993) is a South African sculptor and visual artist.

Biography  Alpert was born in Jerusalem in 1949. On his father's side he is the fourth generation in Jerusalem - his great-grandfather came to Israel from Slonim-Russia in 1867 and was a teacher (Melamed, in Hebrew) in the Hurva Synagogue in the Old city. Alpert studied until the age of 6 in his grandfather's \\"Cheder\\", then in the \\"Etz-Haim\\" Talmud-Torah in the Zichron-Moshe neighborhood of Jerusalem. Then, he moved in 1957 to the ‚ÄùMoriah\\" school in the Bucharim neighborhood in Jerusalem. His high school was ‚ÄùDugma. After finishing high school he was accepted to the academic reserve (in Hebrew ◊î◊¢◊™◊ï◊ì◊î ◊î◊ê◊ß◊ì◊û◊ô◊™) and studied Physics-Mathematics at the Hebrew University, in a special program which included computer studies for the first time in Israel. Following his B.Sc., he continued to M.Sc. in Physics during his IDF service. In the IDF he became in 1973 a weather forecaster in the Air Force meteorology unit. He later became the commander of meteorology for the Air Force‚Äòs transport base, for 3 years. In 1977 he left the IDF with the rank of captain, and later became a major during his reserve service. Alpert was asked to continue his reserve service in the IDF, as an exception, until the age of 56, since he had developed the modeling scientific basis for the modern forecasting infrastructure at the Meteorological Service and the Air Force. Alpert is married to Rachel, RN, and is the father of eight children.  Academic career  During his service as a Meteorology officer in the Israel Air Force, Alpert was confronted with the severe difficulty of flood forecasting. This motivated him to develop new techniques to predict and monitor rain, as well as to develop high-resolution models to improve forecasting. In parallel with his military service, he began to work at the Hebrew University on light scattering from atmospheric aerosols. After his release from the IDF he began his Ph.D. studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , during which he built his own meteorological model, which successfully explained the typical summer afternoon storms over the Sea of Galilee (Lake Kinneret). Upon finishing his Ph.D. in 1980, he was invited to a post-doctorate at Harvard University. For two years Alpert worked with Richard Lindzenand studied the Indian Monsoon. During his post-doctorate he developed a physical model incorporating feedback from the moist surface. After two years in Boston, in 1982, he was invited by the Department of Geophysics and Planetary Sciences at Tel-Aviv University (now the Department of Earth Sciences) to become a faculty member. In the year 2004 he was elected an honorary member of the world Jewish Academy for Sciences. During the years 2005-2008 Alpert served as Head of the Department of Geophysics at Tel-Aviv University, and then in 2008-2013 he served as the Head of the TAU Porter School for Environmental Studies.  Research  Alpert's research group is engaged in theoretical studies and observations of the dynamics of atmospheric processes, using hydro-dynamical models for numerically solving the development of different phenomena. He was the first to investigate theoretically several synoptic systems in Israel, including Sharav low, Cyprus low, Red Sea Trough, etc. Remote sensing observations include satellites, radar, and recently data collected by cellular antennas used for communication. This last source was first identified in his research, published in \\"Science\\" Magazine. Recently this method was applied for novel flood warning and monitoring of rain, fog, and humidity. In order to investigate atmospheric phenomena Alpert devised a method allowing for the identification of the effect by different factors, including separation of synergistic effects. The atmospheric models applied by Alpert are of three different types: The first is used for study of weather forecasting difficulties, and investigating phenomena such as rain, cyclone genesis, winds, etc. The second type is of climate models which can be run ~100 years into the future, and with this method Alpert was the first to investigate detailed potential climate changes due to global warming in the Middle-East. The third type of models focuses on aerosols in the atmosphere, with emphasis on mineral dust mainly from the Sahara and the Middle-East region, as well as sea-salt particles, and their effect on weather and climate.  Publications  Alpert has published over 240 articles in scientific peer-reviews journals, and an additional ~100 chapters in books. In 2011 his book \\"Factor Separation in the Atmosphere: Applications and Future Prospects\\" was published by Cambridge Academic Press. The book describes the factor separation method that he developed since 1993 for investigating interactions in the atmosphere. The method was adopted globally by many research groups, and the book describes many and various applications.

Before becoming goddess, she was a 10,000-year-old demoness. It was originally a stone and was born outside the heavens and the earth, during the Chaos era and the Xuanhuang era. Shiji was originally a major villain from the mythical classic Compendium of Information on the Gods of the Three Religions (‰∏âÊïôÊêúÁ•ûÂ§ßÂÖ®), and featured in the Chinese novel Fengshen Yanyi as a major antagonist of Nezha. Legends Shiji was originally a stone, who receives the essence of the sun and the moon, that was born beyond the cosmos and has become a divine spirit by undergoing earth, water, fire and air. After countless thousands of years, it became spiritual. After 10,000 years of cultivation, this stubborn stone finally became a human figure. Shiji was later accepted by the heavenly master Tongtian Jiaozhu as a student. After attaining Taoism, it took thousands of years to practice. Although the speed of practice is very slow, because of countless years, Shiji has a profound understanding of Tao. As far as its comprehensive strength is concerned, it is still above Taiyi Zhenren. = Compendium of Information on the Gods of the Three Religions= Shiji is a demon leader who is detrimental to the world and opposed the heaven. She gave birth to the monsters and demons because the world were flooded, so the Jade Emperor was furious. The Jade Emperor has ordered Nezha down to earth incarnate demon slayer. One day, Nezha used the bow and arrow of Rulai to shoot kill Shiji's children, and finally Shiji was also killed with a magic pestle (È≠îÊùµ). = Fengshen Yanyi= Shiji lives in the White Bone Cave of Skull Mountain, and there are two apprentices under the gate, Biyun Tongzi and Caiyun Tonger. One day, Nezha shot an arrow and unexpectedly killed the gatekeeper Biyun Tongzi. She came to seek revenge Nezha and his father Li Jing to be justified. Nezha could not beat Shiji and his master Taiyi Zhenren came to protect him. Taiyi attacked Shiji and burned her with Nine-dragon-fire-net (‰πùÈæôÁ•ûÁÅ´ÁΩ©). While trapped in this net, Taiyi summoned several dragons which unleashed a large volley of fire into the net; instantly killing Shiji and turning her back into her original form as a molten rock. After her death, Jiang Ziya deified Shiji as the Yue Youxingjun (ÊúàÊ∏∏ÊòüÂêõ \\"Star of Moon Tour\\"). Overview Shiji is although on the side of law and order, is depicted as rigid and lacking compassion. Moreover, although divine, both Ao Guang and, especially, Shiji are demonic figures in the Fengshen Yanyi. Nezha's crimes against them are accidental, and he defends himself‚Äîalbeit excessively‚Äîfrom their aggressive attempts to punish him. In line with preceding argument, one might also view these circumstances as contributing to the author's careful construction of sympathy pathy for Nezha. Shiji is also related to the stone born from the heaven and earth of Sun Wukong or Jia Baoyu.  Religion Shiji is worshipped in Chinese folk religion and is called \\"Shiji Niangniang\\" (the goddess of stone) or \\"Yue Youxingjun\\" (the deity of moon tour star). Located in Caishiji, five miles southwest of Ma'anshan City, the Sanyuan Cave Temple (‰∏âÂÖÉÊ¥û) is built with a sitting statue of Shiji.

As a rule they are dwelling in landfills, public transit stations, junkyards, or under the bridges of major cities. The country's legal system defines the term \\"street children\\" as children who either left their family or have been abandoned by their parents. Violence against them is considered to be a widespread and serious national problem because in Ukraine they can become victims of commercial sexual exploitation, police violence, civil rights abuses and human trafficking.Julia Galustyan The Situation Of Children In Ukraine And Their Vulnerability To Commercial Sexual Exploitation, Ukrainian Institute of Social Research, 2003 General background In 1991 Ukraine proclaimed its independence after collapse of the Soviet Union. The process was followed by transition to free market economy and rapid social changes, like impoverishment of population, high unemployment, and subsequently ‚Äî sky- rocketing juvenile delinquency, wide spread of street drugs and adolescent suicides during the mid-1990s. Living on the streets exposes the youngsters to a wide number of risk factors, and due to their effect the great part of the infants falls behind in the schooling. The main risks of street life in Ukraine are physical and sexual violence, drug abuse, malnutrition, police abuse and harassment, risky sexual activity, forced sex, unintended pregnancy, and different kinds of infections, like HIV, tuberculosis, STDs and hepatitis. The risks contribute to the psychological and emotional condition of the street youngsters instigating among them traumatism, depressions, sense of isolation, and insufficient self-esteem. In addition, their opportunities to make a living are very limited by beggary, collection of empty bottles and so on. As a result their everyday surviving can be characterized as deviation from the ethical norms of the civil society since the street children tend to be inclined to criminal activities (theft, robbery and property damage), vagrancy, substance abuse and prostitution regardless of their gender. It was reported that the use of drugs among Ukrainian homeless minors acquired a special meaning of symbolic ritual. In order to strengthen their subgroup solidarity they have developed a ceremony to inject a so called baltrushka (mixture of vinegar, water and flu medicine) up to six times a day. Another popular method of drug taking in Ukraine is inhaling glue.Marcel Theroux: life with Ukraine's street children The Guardian, 2012 The uncontrolled use of injection drugs, sharing needles and unprotected sex make the street children extremely vulnerable to HIV.Prevalence, Abuse & Exploitation of Street Children. Ukraine http://gvnet.com The spread of HIV among the Ukrainian street children attracted a lot of special research interest due to their way of life. The available data show that the street children and youth of the major cities make up about 33 % of total population at risk. Testing of HIV samples collected in different Ukrainian cities demonstrates that HIV prevalence among street children may be as high as 50 %. According to the obtained data around 15.5% of street minors in Ukraine used the injected drugs at least once, 9.8% of boys reported anal sex experience when only 36 % of them acknowledged using condom during their most recent sexual encounter. An access of the street minors to public health services in Ukraine is a serious problem too due to cumbersome bureaucratic protocol and negative attitude of the medical personnel to the homeless people. Some providers of the health services may refuse to treat them or provide just a limited treatment only in life-threatening condirion. Ukrainian Police for Minors treats the street children as \\"potential criminals\\". The police attitude towards the youngsters may include sexual harassment and physical violence. According to some reports around 75 % of the Ukrainian street children have experienced a harassment from the police and 41 % have been harassed more than tree times in the past year. Available statistics Unfortunately, official data about a total number of street children in Ukraine are not available. As a result, there is a huge range of different evaluations between 30,000 and 300,000. An assessment of Ukrainian Ministry of Health indicated that there is around 115,000 of adolescents aged 10‚Äî18 who need a protection. Nevertheless, there is no doubts that their number went up significantly during last 17 years. As of 2003, the Ukrainian government estimated their number of 50,000 using data collected from street shelters. A main factor, which pushes the minors to the street life is an extreme poverty of Ukrainian population. The adults has to work longer hours or seek for employment in neighbor countries, while their children are being left unattended. Other factors are widespread alcoholism and substance abuse, physical or sexual violence and ignoring the parenting responsibilities within their families.

The grenade was designed for the Mk 47 Striker. The Mk 47 is a candidate for replacing the Mk 19 grenade launcher, first fielded in 1968, and still in widespread service, around the world. The Mk 47 is considerably lighter than the Mk 19, is designed to fire all the same suite of grenades as the Mk 19, together with more modern grenades the Mk 19 could not fire with full functionality, like the MK285 grenade. The MK285 contains a programmable fuse, initially designed by Bofors but finalized by Nammo, that sets the distance at which the grenade will explode, when the weapon's trigger is pulled. The weapon's computerized sight will have measured the distance to the target the gunner was aiming at, and that distance will be transferred to the grenade's fuse. The munition spins, on its way to the target, and the fuse counts rotations to measure the distance travelled. This airburst capability means that the grenade can damage or disable soft targets, like trucks, with a near miss. It also means the grenade can injure or kill soldiers who are behind walls or in trenches, through indirect fire, who could not be hurt by more conventional grenades that exploded when hitting those walls. The manufacturer characterizes the grenade as a weapon that can hit around corners. As of 2015 the Mk 19 remained the frontline grenade launcher used by the US military. Limited numbers of Mk 47 weapons had been issued to special forces units. The grenade is manufactured by the Norwegian firm Nammo Raufoss. The explosive in the grenade is classed as \\"insensitive\\" - ie. less likely to sympathetically explode due to the nearby explosion of other munitions.

Used to be the permanent participant of Leningrad, all- Russian, all-Union, international exhibitions and International Poster Biennale. He was awarded the medal \\"For Distinguished Labour\\".  Biography  Nikolay Belkov was born in 1950 in Leningrad. As a child, he was fond of football, showed excellent results playing in the youth team. But there was also a passion for drawing, because of which for some time the sport took a back seat. However, living on Krestovsky Island, it was impossible to completely abandon sports. He was fascinated by pentathlon. Modern pentathlon is a multidimensional and exciting sports all-around, forming strength and endurance, as well as a strong friendship and cohesion of all team members, especially since the Olympic –°hampion in modern pentathlon A.A. Tarasov was the coach. Nikolay became a master of sports and had every chance to enter the national team of the USSR. And yet the main serious business was studying at the Leningrad Higher Art and Industrial School named after V. I. Mukhin.  Creation of System of Pictograms for the Olympic Games in 1980  System of pictograms of Olympic sports (designer N. Belkov, Olympic games-80) In 1977, Nikolay Belkov graduated from the evening department of the faculty of industrial art of Leningrad Higher Art and Industrial School named after V. I. Mukhin. His graduated work was dedicated to a system of pictograms developed by him for all Olympic Sports for the 1980‚Äôs–ñ—É–∫–æ–≤ –í. –í. –ü–õ–ê–ö–ê–¢. 1967‚Äî2007. / –ê–ª—å–±–æ–º. ‚Äî Saint-Petersburg, 2010. Olympics Games. Of course, the creation of its own graph-semiotic system for the Olympic Games was extremely prestigious. Smoothness of the figures on the icons is achieved by building with coner of 30-60 degrees After finishing his studies at the school, Nikolay Belkov chose to design a set of equipment for pentathletes as his graduation project. Together with this, he worked on the creation of emblems of the five sports included in the pentathlon. Having developed dozens of options, he at some point caught the General principle of graphic construction. In this regard, the idea was born to try to portray all sports as icons. Schematic images of different sports were once used at the Olympics in London, Tokyo, Munich, Montreal. Nikolay studied the experience of foreign designers in detail and contrasted their dancing men with a new system of symbols–û–ª–∏–º–ø–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π –º–∏—à–∫–∞ —Ä–æ–¥–∏–ª—Å—è –Ω–∞ –±–µ—Ä–µ–≥–∞—Ö –ù–µ–≤—ã // –ù–¢–í.Ru. The basis for the work was the famous system of icons designed by Otto Aicher that was created for the Olympics in Munich[kAk).ru  –ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞–ª –æ –¥–∏–∑–∞–π–Ω–µ . However, Belkov managed to create a fundamentally new improved image model. Unlike Aicher's models, the figures designed by Nikolay Belkov are based on corners of 30¬∞ and 60¬∞, rather than 45¬∞-90¬∞-135¬∞, as in the Munich system, which allowed to \\"revive‚Äù the depicted athletes, bringing their movements closer to the real ones. Belkov's pictograms are built on a new principle: if before the artists left their athletes \\"levitate\\" on the empty field of the square, the figures in this case are clearly fixed in space. He also made it possible to apply images in forward, reverse, contour and reverse contour color solutions. They can have color and shadow gradations, increase or decrease; greatly reduced, they formed the basis of the Tangier grid and were used in printing tickets and passes. The system of pictograms was patented and successfully implemented at the Olympic games in Moscow in 1980. And the graduated work on its development became one of the best final works of the Stieglitz Academy–ê–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—è –®—Ç–∏–≥–ª–∏—Ü–∞. –õ—É—á—à–∏–µ –≤—ã–ø—É—Å–∫–Ω—ã–µ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—ã –∑–∞ 140 –ª–µ—Ç. / –ü–æ–¥ —Ä–µ–¥. –¢. –í. –ì–æ—Ä–±—É–Ω–æ–≤–æ–π. ‚Äî Saint- Petersburg: –°–∞–Ω–∫—Ç-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–∞—è –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-–ø—Ä–æ–º—ã—à–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∞–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—è –∏–º. –ê. –õ. –®—Ç–∏–≥–ª–∏—Ü–∞, 2015.. The use of icons remains relevant in modern life.

This sports complex is the base for the training of Olympic reserve swimmers.

The policy was embraced by Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour and the Historical Right upon Italian unification and carried over into the post- Risorgimento liberal state.Denis Mack Smith, \\"Cavour and Parliament\\" Cambridge Historical Journal 13#1 (1957): 37-57Denis Mack Smith, Cavour (1985). Agostino Depretis, the Prime Minister in 1883 who was a member of the Left continued the process. He moved to the right and reshuffled his government to include Marco Minghetti's Liberal-Conservatives. This was a move Depretis had been considering for a while. The aim was to ensure a stable government that would avoid weakening the institutions by extreme shifts to the left or right and ensuring calm in Italy. At this time, middle class politicians were concerned more with making deals with one another rather than with political philosophies and principles. Large coalitions were formed with members being bribed to join them. The Liberals, the main political group, was tied together by informal gentleman's agreements, but these were always in matters of enriching themselves. Actual governing did not seem to be happening at all, but limited franchise led to politicians not having to concern themselves with the interests of their constituents. One of the most successful politicians was Giovanni Giolitti, who succeeded in becoming Prime Minister on five occasions over twenty years. Under his influence the Liberals did not develop as a structured party, instead being a series of informal personal groupings with no formal links to political constituencies. However, trasformismo fed into the debates that the Italian parliamentary system was weak and actually failing and it ultimately became associated with corruption. It was perceived as a sacrifice of principles and policies for short term gain. The system of trasformismo was little loved and seemed to be creating a huge gap between politicians and their constituents. This system brought almost no advantages, as illiteracy remained the same in 1912 as before the unification era, and backward economic policies combined with poor sanitary conditions continued to prevent the country's rural areas from improving.  Use in Gramscian theory  The Italian Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci described trasformismo as a strategy to prevent the formation of an organized working-class movement by coopting and neutralizing its ideas and leaders within a ruling coalition. Gramsci cited Giovanni Giolitti's attempt to forge an alliance with the industrial workers of northern Italy under the banner of protectionism as one example of this method. On this account, trasformismo is connected to the process of passive revolution, by which capitalism can be developed in a particular country without the need for overt mobilization of the people.  Trasformismo in Canada  Drawing upon Gramsci's observations, Canadian historian Ian McKay has suggested that trasformismo has also played an important role in Canadian politics. The MacDonald‚ÄìCartier coalition, the basis of the Conservative Party which dominated Canadian federal politics for most of the latter half of the 19th century and the Liberal Party which had dominated Canadian politics for the 20th century, are portrayed as examples of a Canadian variant of trasformismo. In the 1930s, Professor Frank H. Underhill of the University of Toronto also argued that Canada's two major political parties, the Liberals and the Conservatives, had operated in similar ways, advancing the same policies appealing to the same variety of sectional/regional and class interests. In doing so, Canada had perfected the two-party system and had marginalized liberalism and radicalism. Underhill argued the result was a pervasive poverty in Canadian political culture. Not coincidentally, Underhill was centrally involved in the formation of the Co- operative Commonwealth Federation, a farmer-labour coalition born during the Great Depression which became Canada's first successful federal third party, the social democratic New Democratic Party.

The southern part of Lac aux Martres is served indirectly by the route 381 (north- south direction) which runs along the eastern limit of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. Several other secondary forest roads serve the lake sector for forestry and recreational tourism activities.Open Street Map - Accessed January 10, 2019 Forestry is the main economic activity in the sector; recreational tourism, second. The surface of Lac aux Martres is usually frozen from the end of November to the beginning of April, however the safe circulation on the ice is generally done from mid-December to the end of March.  Geography  Lac des Martres is located between the territory of Hautes-Gorges-de-la-Rivi√®re-Malbaie and that of Grands-Jardins National Park. The main hydrographic slopes neighboring Lac aux Martres are: * north side: Freddo lake, Second Paul lake, √ârables lake, Croix lake, Porc-√âpic Lake, Carabine stream; * east side: rivi√®re du Gouffre, Malbaie River, Petit lac Malfait, Lac du Coeur; * south side: Barley Lake, Petit Malbaie Lake, √âcluse Lake, Rivi√®re du Gouffre; * west side: Saguenay River, Baie des Ha! Ha!. Lac aux Martres has a length of in the shape of a boat anchor, a maximum width of , an altitude is and an area of . Lac aux Martres has a relatively round peninsula with a maximum diameter of and with a mountain peak reaching . A dam is built at its mouth which is located on the east bank, at: * south-west of the dam at the mouth of Lac Malfait; * south of the confluence of ruisseau des √ârables and rivi√®re des martres; * south-west of the confluence of the rivi√®re des martres and the Malbaie River; * east of the confluence of the Malbaie River and the Saint Lawrence estuary.

Toponymy  The toponym ‚ÄúLac des Martres‚Äù is indicated in the ‚ÄúDictionary of rivers and lakes of the province of Quebec‚Äù, by Eug√®ne Rouillard, Department of Lands and Forests, 1914, page 270. This work indicates that the land surveyor, F Vincent, in 1886, described it as being located in mountainous terrain, surrounded by fir and spruce; it also notes the presence of trout in its waters. This name evokes the presence of the Canada marten, carnivorous mammal also called fisher, whose fur has long adorned the collars of coats. The toponym \\"Lac aux Martres\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968, by the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec.

The JavaScript sublanguages Source ¬ß1, Source ¬ß2, Source ¬ß3 and Source ¬ß4 are designed to be just powerful enough to support all examples of the respective chapter of the textbook.  Purpose and design principle  During the development of SICP JS, starting in 2008, it became clear that purpose- designed sublanguages of JavaScript would contribute to the learning experience. Initially called \\"JediScript\\" and inspired by , Douglas Crockford, the Source sublanguages follow the chapters of SICP JS; each language Source ¬ßx is a sublanguage of the next language Source ¬ß(x+1).  Features  Source ¬ß1 is a very small purely functional sublanguage of JavaScript, designed for Chapter 1 of SICP JS. Source ¬ß2 adds pairs and a list library, following the data structures theme of Chapter 2. Source ¬ß3 adds state-full constructs, and Source ¬ß4 adds support for meta-circular evaluation. Chapter 5 of SICP JS does not require language support beyond Source ¬ß4. All Source languages are properly tail recursive, as required by Chapter 1 of SICP and as specified by ECMAScript 2016.  Implementations  Since the Safari browser is ECMAScript 2016 compliant, including proper tail calls, it can serve as an implementation of all Source languages, provided that the necessary libraries are loaded. The Source Academy is a web-based programming environment that implements all Source languages, regardless of browser support for proper tail calls, and features various tools for the readers of SICP JS. The language implementation in the Source Academy is an open-source project.

This is a measure provided for in the Penal Code of Brazil (CPP) as a means of compelling the appearance of a person to attend an action to which he was summoned, but who failed to do so without justification. According to some jurists, this is a form of short-term \\"precautionary detention\\" () whose purpose is to ensure the convenience of the production of proof. If equated with precautionary detention, is contrary to the Brazilian Constitution of 1988 Article 5, paragraph LXI, even though the procedure is in the Penal Code of Brazil, instituted in 1941. The CPP authorizes the enforcement of the of victims, witnesses, defendants, and experts who refuse to appear in court, and who may even be handcuffed and brought by police vehicle. Article 218 of the CPP refers to the requirement of prior summons (). Thus, some argue that even with the justification of providing clarification to the police investigation and even in the interests of justice, the warrant without a summons violates the right to liberty of witnesses and defendants. According to this line of thinking, the only ones who can be compelled to appear by a are those witnesses who were appropriately summoned beforehand and who fail to attend the act to which they were summoned, without valid cause, may be compelled to appear via a warrant. There is some controversy concerning the exact legal foundation and even constitutionality of the warrant. From a legal perspective, it is not the same as an arrest warrant.

Forester wrote about his most popular character, Horatio Hornblower, written in 1940, and published in Collier's magazine. Sanford Sternlicht, author of C. S. Forester and the Hornblower Saga notes the story has multiple inconsistencies with later stories. He also notes elements of the story that Forester re-used, in later stories. In the story Hornblower is 20 years old, and has just been promoted to Lieutenant. Sternlicht places the story in late 1796. Forester has Hornblower recently transferred from serving under Edward Pellew, the genuine naval hero who is Hornblower's first mentor. But Sternlicht notes that in Mr Midshipman Hornblower Hornblower serves under Pellew until 1797. The Hand of Destiny has Hornblower serving on board the fictional HMS Marguerite, under despotic Captain Courtney. In the short story Hornblower is shocked by Courtney's cruelty. Courtney has goaded some of his men to revolt. Hornblower is assigned to negotiate with the rebellious sailors. Courtney is careless in the instructions he gives Hornblower, and is very angry with him when Hornblower promises them Courtney will not retaliate against them. Courtney plans to brutally punish the men without regard to Hornblower's assurances to them. A battle forces a delay in Courtney's plans. Hornblower leads the rebellious sailors in boarding the hostile Spanish warship, the Castilla. Courtney is pleased with Hornblower, and assigns him the task of sailing the captured vessel to port. Hornblower seizes the opportunity that, instead of punishing the alleged mutineers he assign them to serve as his prize crew. Sternlicht notes that Forester re-used the premise of Hornblower angering a senior officer whose instructions gave him the leeway to be lenient with mutineers. Forester wrote the Hornblower stories out of order. Beat to Quarters, set in 1810, the first Hornblower novel, takes place relatively late in his career. In Chapter IX Hornblower dons his dress uniform, when preparing to meet an important person. His preparation includes strapping on his dress sword, \\"(a sword of the value of fifty guineas, the gift of the Patriotic Fund for Lieutenant Hornblower's part in the capture of the Castilla six years ago)\\". In Chapter XIII Hornblower is embarrassed when Lady Barbara admires his hands, which he thinks are ugly. In particular he is embarrassed by an \\"ingrained powder stain\\" on his left hand, dating to his leading the boarding party that captured the Castilla. Forester's second and third novels, A Ship of the Line, and Flying Colours also refer to the sword he was awarded for his role in the capture of the Castilla. In the fifth novel, Lord Hornblower, an older Hornblower reminds himself that he remains the brave officer who lead the boarding of the Castilla. Sternlicht notes that the eighth novel Forester wrote, HMS Atropos, set in 1805-1806, contains a completely different account of the capture of the Castilla. In that novel Hornblower is a junior Post- Captain, and the capture occurs off the coast of Turkey.

He studied under his father and at the universities of Franeker, Utrecht and Leiden, also spending two years in France where he obtained an M.D. degree in Angers. Returning to Groningen in 1651, he joined the staff at the Rijkshogeschool Groningen, which eventually became the University of Groningen. Here he taught for 24 years as professor of botany and chemistry. On his father's death he assumed management of the Hortus Botanicus Groninganus, from 1658 to 1683. His botanist friends sent him seeds from the Dutch East- and West Indies, Africa and the Americas. His daughter, Hester, died after eating Deadly Nightshade from the Garden. Munting subsequently developed a particular interest in the medicinal uses of plants. Munting's best known work Naauwkeurige Beschryving Der Aardgewassen (1696), was published after his death and is an improved version of earlier editions of Waare Oeffening der Planten. The work enjoyed popularity, partly because of its departure from traditional botanical illustration, in that plant species were depicted against a background of classic or pastoral landscapes, often floating in midair with little regard for perspective and relative sizes. Illustrated were trees, shrubs, flowers, and grasses of temperate zones, with some tropical and subtropical plants that had been introduced to the Netherlands. Albrecht von Haller (1708-1777) criticised some of the plates as being of suspicious authenticity.General Biography: Or, Lives, Critical and Historical, of the Most Eminent Persons (Volume 7) - John Aikin (London, 1808) In 1702 the work was translated into Latin by Franz Kiggelaer. After his death in 1683 his son Albert Munting took over the running of the Garden. The genus Muntingia (1753) was named by Linnaeus in honour of Munting.

Life Gess was a teacher of theology in Basel from 1850 to 1864. After that, he became Professor of Systematic Theology in G√∂ttingen, and frpom 1871 in Breslau. In 1879 he succeeded the deceased General Superintendent in Posen, Friedrich Cranz (1809‚Äì1878). Gess entered upon his duties in April 1880 and as general superintendent of the Old Prussian, he headed the Church province of Posen until 1884. He was succeeded by Johannes Hesekiel, and settled down in Wernigerode. The historian Felician Gess (1861‚Äì1938) was his son. Theology Gess is known as the main representative of Kenosis. His main work was The Scripture Doctrine of the Person of Christ. (1878‚Äì1887). Rejecting the Chalcedonian Definition, he sees Christ's incarnation as a transition from the state of being \\"self-positing\\" to the state of \\"being posited\\". At conception, Logos was united with the body of Jesus, instead of God creating a human soul, as he does with other men. The Logos reduced himself to what was compatible with existence as a human soul. Controversially, Gess thinks that the humanity of Jesus required him to allow his self-consciousness to be extinguished at birth, only to begin to flash through at a certain stage of his physical maturity, and then developing with the goal of sanctification, which is achieved step by step in the choices he freely makes. Furthermore, Gess argues that a change took place in the Trinity for the duration of the incarnate Logos' earthly life. The Son no longer proceeds from the Father, and the Spirit proceeds from the Father alone, rather than from the Father and the Son. David Fergusson (Ed.): W.F.

It is a grass surfaced football (soccer) arena with a total area of 30,000m2. It can seat up to 32,000 spectators and has other sports-related facilities. It was designed and built by Nurol Construction. It is owned by the Federal government of Iraq and is home to Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya. It will be inaugurated in early 2020. The stadium has changed its name three times. It was called \\"Al Sadr City Stadium\\" but the Ministry of Youth and Sports decided in 2017 to name it \\"Al Habibya Stadium\\" in reference to the stadium's location. Finally, in early December 2019, the name \\"Al-Shohada Stadium\\" was definitively chosen as a tribute to the martyrs of the Tishreen Revolution.

The area around the lake is served by the route 169 which passes to the west and by the rang Saint-Isidore road (north shore), for the needs of recreational tourism activities, especially the resortOpen Street Map - Accessed February 4, 2019. Recreational and tourist activities, especially vacationing, are the main economic activities in this area; agriculture and forestry, second. The surface of Lake K√©nogamichiche is usually frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March, however the safe circulation on the ice is generally made from mid-December to mid-March.  Geography  The main watersheds near Lake K√©nogamichiche are: * north side: Rivi√®re des Aulnaies, Petite rivi√®re B√©dard, Rivi√®re B√©dard, Raquette River, La Petite D√©charge; * east side: Kenogami Lake, Pikauba River, Chicoutimi River, Bras des Angers, Rivi√®re aux Sables, Cascouia River; * south side: Vert Lake, La Belle Rivi√®re, ruisseau L'Abb√©, lac de la Belle Rivi√®re, rivi√®re du Milieu, M√©tabetchouane River; * west side: Belle Rivi√®re, M√©tabetchouane River, ruisseau de la Belle Rivi√®re, Grignon River, Ouiatchouan River, lac Saint-Jean. Lac K√©nogamichiche has a length of , a width of and an altitude of . This lake is mainly fed by riparian streams, by the outlet (coming from the south) of Vert Lake and by the stream of the Floating Bridge (coming from the northeast). On the south side, this lake is separated from Vert Lake, by a strip of land with a width varying between and , along the entire length of the lake. The mouth of this lake is located to the northeast, at: * south-east of the confluence of the Rivi√®re des Aulnaies; * north-east of route 169; * west of Kenogami Lake; * south-east of the village center of H√©bertville; * east of lac Saint-Jean; * south-east of the mouth of the La Belle Rivi√®re; * south of downtown Alma. From the mouth of Lake K√©nogamichiche, the current follows the course of the Aulnaies river consecutively on towards the northwest, the course of the Belle Rivi√®re on towards the north-west (via a bay), then crosses the eastern part of Lac Saint-Jean towards the north on , follows the course of the Saguenay river via the Petite D√©charge on to Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.  Toponymy  This body of water is located in the hollow of a kettle formed following global warming 10,500 years ago, which followed a glaciation whose cover was about three kilometers thick. Located in the municipality of H√©bertville, it is located on the old waterway that once connected the Saguenay to Lake Saint-Jean via Lake K√©nogami. A plateau, where the Beau Portage lake is located, allows communication between these two lakes. This toponym appears in the form Kinougamichis in the Jesuit Relations of 1672 under the pen of Father Albanel. This name turns out to be a diminutive of kenogami, meaning \\"small long lake\\". It was once famous for the multitude of long-tailed frogs that inhabited it and made a continuous croaking. In addition, various spellings have been inventoried for this toponym, including Kinogamichiche, Kinougamisis, Tshnuagamitshish, etc.Book: Quebec names and places, work of the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec, published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of a printed illustrated dictionary, and under that of a CD-ROM produced by the company Micro-Intel, in 1997, from this dictionary. The toponym \\"lac K√©nogamichiche\\" was formalized on September 5, 1968, by the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec.
