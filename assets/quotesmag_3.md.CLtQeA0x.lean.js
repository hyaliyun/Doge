It is west southwest of Mildura, 13 kilometres south of the Sturt Highway opposite Lake Cullulleraine. At the , Werrimull and the surrounding area had a population of 112, declining from 320 in 2011. Werrimull is an indigenous Australian word believed to mean Eagle. Werrimull is sometimes misspelt Werrimul possibly because it is confused with an indigenous group from the Horsham region.Werrimul History The Millewa was opened up to farming in the 1920s, the Post Office opening on 24 June 1924. The railway reached Werrimull in 1923, officially opened 1924, but closed by 1989. Much of the native Eucalyptus trees were cleared to make way for farming. This has given rise to soil salinity in the area. Most of the Werrimull area was a Soldier Settlement with blocks of approximately allocated. This was found to be too small and many were unable to make a living in this region. The population of the Millewa has been in steady decline over many years. The area of the locality contains a number of previous localities which existed when the population was larger, namely Bambill which had a post office open from 1926 until 1959, Bambill South with a post office from 1928 until 1930, Karawinna with a post office from 1924 until 1970, Karawinna North on the Sturt Highway with a post office from 1928 until 1951, Yarrara with a post office from 1926 until 1978 and Yarrara North on the Sturt Highway.

The game tells the comic fantasy story of Brad, a teenage boy from modern Earth who was magically abducted to the world of Enchantia by an evil witch-queen. Brad needs to escape and take on the forces of darkness to find a way back to his own dimension. Curse of Enchantia, at first known as Zeloria, was Core Design's first attempt in the adventure genre as they set up to compete with LucasArts and Sierra On-Line. The game features several highly unconventional and controversial game mechanics and design choices for an adventure title from that era, including having many simple action game style sequences and being practically devoid of in-game text and conversations. Nevertheless, Curse was generally well received upon its release, especially by the Amiga magazines, where the game's graphics and animation received particular praise even as its illogical puzzles and unusual design choices were often criticized. A direct sequel was briefly planned but eventually turned into a spiritual successor game titled Universe and released in 1994.  Gameplay  icon-driven user interface bar (Amiga screenshot) Curse of Enchantia uses a point and click style user interface, similar to Sierra's Creative Interpreter from the King's Quest series.Tony Gill, \\"Braving wicked witches and shark infested waters\\". CU Amiga, November 1992, pages 72-73. The player character is commanded with an icon based control bar that is accessible by pressing the right mouse button, which also pauses the game. The control bar features seven main actions: inventory, pick up/take, manipulate/use (opening up a sub-menu with eight further actions: unlock, insert, push/pull, eat, wear, throw, give and combine), look, talk (only either \\"Help!\\" or \\"Hi!\\"), attack, and jump. Usually, the protagonist has to stand in the immediate vicinity to the game's objects and characters, which then appear as icons in a separate bar, in order to interact with them. A joystick or computer keyboard input can also be used. DDF/Kate, \\"Bradley und die Hexe\\". ASM 8/1992. Unusually for an adventure game genre, Curse of Enchantia does not feature text-based object descriptions or conversations. Its few short scenes of rudimentary communication with friendly non-player characters use only a minimalist system of pictograms in comic book-style speech balloons, usually displaying the objects that the characters need to be delivered. Instead, the game features several action-style sequences, such as dodging hazards or timing the use of items. This resulted in some classifying it as an action-adventure game. However, the character is never at risk of dying, being effectively 'immortal' no matter the dangers, and thus every such task can be repeated until successfully completed, risking only losing a few points from the score. Jewels, gold coins, and other objects of value can be collected throughout the game for a higher score.Curse of Enchantia game manual by Robert Toone and Kevin Norburn.  Plot  In a parallel universe, a fantasy world of Enchantia is suffering under the cruel rule of a powerful coven of wicked witches. Their vain and terrible queen, who managed to surpass the rest in depravity, seeks a live male child from another dimension as the main ingredient of her desired spell of eternal youth. Having borrowed magic powers from all the other witches in Enchantia on the promise to make them too young forever, she created an invisible portal connection to Earth. One day in the 1990s, Joystick 29 (8/92), page 30. a young English teenager named Brad plays a baseball practice with his sister Jenny when the witch spots him through the portal and incants a summoning spell, making him suddenly vanish in a flash of light. The game begins as Brad, dressed in medieval-style clothing, wakes up in a dungeon cell. But the boy soon manages to escape, and then sets out on a journey to return home safely. In the course of his surreal adventure, he braves various dangers, meets a host of friendly and hostile characters, and rises to become a reluctant hero who just might break the titular curse and bring down the evil's reign.Zero 36 (October 1992), page 87. After breaking out from his prison, Brad falls into a moat before coming to a halt in a cavern maze. Reaching the surface, he arrives at a nearby village; this location is repeatedly revisited throughout the game, as Brad comes back there after traveling to the various corners of the land, encountering bizarre characters and experiencing absurd adventures: the Edge of the World cliff, the Ice Palace, and the Valley of the Lost (a place where all kinds of things lost on Earth have gone to), all while searching for an unlikely set of items that would help him emerge victorious from the game's final showdown (including a fire extinguisher and a mechanical fan). In the end, the boy enters the evil Queen's castle to find and defeat her once and for all. Once she is no more, he gets instantly transported back to the baseball field where it all had started.Tim Tucker, Amiga Power 21, 22, 23 (the game walkthrough in three parts).Keith Grabban, \\"Giving the game away: Curse of Enchantia\\". Amiga Action 41 (February 1993), pages 78-81. R. M√ºller, \\"Curse of Enchantia\\". BiT 06/94 (June 1994), page 11. Luis Luque, \\"Curse of Enchantia: Contra las fuerzas del mal. Os ense√±amos a golpear a una bruja con un bate de b√©isbol.\\" Microman√≠a Segunda Epoca issue 61, pages 61-65.  Development and release  Core Design's original concept for the game had been to make it more of an action title rather than an adventure one,\\"First impressions: Curse of Enchantia\\", CU Amiga 29 (July 1992), page 43. initially being envisioned as an isometric-view role-playing action role-playing game in the style of Core's own 1991 Heimdall, before the project has evolved into a more classic, completely 2D, side-scrolling adventure game (yet still sometimes being described as a role-playing game). It was proposed as \\"an adventure for people who hadn't played that kind of game before.\\" The protagonist's effective invincibility was a late demand by the executive producer Jeremy Heath-Smith. The game's co-designer and the Amiga version's chief programmer Rob Toone said that their idea was to make these parts of the game \\"interesting without being difficult.\\" Co-designer and the PC version programmer Ian Sabine stated that the lack of text \\"speeds up gameplay\\".Computer Gaming World 99, page 84: \\"Over There: enCore! enCore!\\". Regarding the decision to keep the onscreen text to a minimum, Toone said that \\"too much reading can slow the game or kill it, like The Adventures of Willy Beamish,\\" with the main artist Rolf Mohr adding that \\"hopefully, a picture will say a thousand words and make this system easy to use.\\"\\"Work in progress: We need a hero! Curse of Enchantia\\", The One Amiga 47 (August 1992). According to Toone, \\"Lucasfilm gets most of its humour out of its text, whereas we hopefully get ours from comical animations and daft happenings.\\" Core's Richard Barclay described it as \\"a huge icon-driven epic of the Sierra On- Line/Lucasfilm ilk.\\" Mohr named Sierra's King's Quest and Space Quest series as his big influences. alt= It took a month for the project to be storyboarded before any actual art and programming work started on it. Mohr recalled: \\"Back then there was not much in the way of 'game design', much less 'concept art'. I was shown extremely brief paragraphs or diagrams of each scene/puzzle and given full latitude to make up pretty much whatever I wanted. It was a lot of fun, although I found myself questioning some of the gameplay choices.\\" The both versions of the game, for the PC and the Amiga, were developed separately and simultaneously, in order to make the best possible product for each platform rather than a quick port from one system to another. A version for the Amiga CD32 had also been planned. The game mixes backgrounds hand-drawn with acrylic paint and then digitized by Mohr, and sprite bitmap graphics made in Deluxe Paint and Brilliance on the Amiga with some rotoscoped animations. The animators Billy Allison and Stuart Atkinson created \\"huge\\" DPaint-made character sequences but they had to implement them in game in more efficient way due to computer memory limitations.Stuart Campbell, \\"Things to come: Curse of Enchantia\\". Amiga Power 17 (September 1992), page 20. In addition, the PC version used the full 8-bit color of a 256-color palette, but the Amiga version had to be downscaled to only 32 colors (including 24 colors for the background and eight colors for the main character; the other characters had to be drawn with these colors).\\"Life, Core Design and everything\\", The One Amiga (January 1994), pages 36-37. The game also uses various digitized sound effects.Amazing Computer Magazine Volume 8 Issue 3 (June 1993), pages 83-84. The game's design and plot has evolved over time, including the title change. Several revisions resulted in some of the already made some graphics and other content being cut from the game, in particular in the final area of the castle's interior (which at first was intended to be much larger and to feature monsters that would guard it, but in the end was reduced to a small area with the task basically limited to finding a secret chamber).Allison said, \\"there were whole sections that never made it in, like a roller skating frankenstein, that shattered into loads of tiny versions of him if you 'killed' him, I did the sprites etc, it just never made it to the game.\\" Its working title had been at first Zeloria,\\"Verhext\\", Power Play Magazine 10/92, p. 17-18. which later caused some confusion as a number of video game magazines have continued to use \\"Zeloria\\" as the name of the world in the game;Jonathan Maddock, \\"Let's do the time warp...\\", Amiga Computing 55 (December 1992), pages 129-130.The One Amiga 46 (July 1992), page 119. some other magazines also incorrectly assumed \\"Enchantia\\" to be the name of the game's antagonist, G√©n√©ration 4 52 (pages). Michael Anton, \\"Curse of Enchantia: Im tiefen Tal der B√∂sen Hexe\\". ASM Special 18, p. 16-20. who is actually nameless (some articles feature also other names such as \\"Malizia\\" or \\"Meilbrum\\"). Some articles also featured an earlier and slightly different version of the plot, which involved a castle of three witches, who needed to drink a special potion every hundred years or else they would turn to dust, Volker Weitz, Power Play 11/92: \\"Hexensabbat: Curse of Enchantia \\" (Kultboy.com). and the protagonist Brad's original task involved a rescue of his captured sister Jenny. \\"Lo historia de una antigua maldici√≥n\\", Microman√≠a 53. In 1991, Zeloria was described as \\"a mystical and fantastic land, full of lost objects and witches - in fact, Zeloria is the land of the lost where all those loose socks and TV remote controls go.\\" The name \\"Enchantia\\" was only proposed by Mohr late in the development as more fitting, to which the producer added \\"Curse of\\" to create the title (Mohr would later \\"accidentally\\" name Killzone as well). Allison described the projects as a \\"zany Pythonesque take on the classic fairy tales.\\" The game's story and elements were partially inspired by The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, The Snow Queen, and Disney animated films, and relies heavily on surreal humor and slapstick. It contains several Easter egg pop culture references, including the shop called \\"Benn's Costume Shop\\" complete with a costume of Batman, a band named \\"The Slugs\\" consisting of four humanoid slugs, getting into a frozen realm through a wardrobe, and encountering the wreck of Marie Celeste. Other connections might be accidental, such as its likeness to Lure of the Temptress, another fantasy adventure game that was developed at the same time (released in June 1992). Stuart Campbell, who described as Curse of Enchantia as \\"a funny version of Lure of the Temptress with a different plot,\\" was not the only one who noted the both games' similarities to each other, especially regarding the initial dungeon-escape scenes in both games. As written in adventure gaming magazine Red Herring, \\"obvious similarities abound as you find that: 'the downtrodden villagers are praying for a return to a peaceful life, and the death of the evil one', which Is pretty much what they are doing in Lure of the Temptress.\\" Curse of Enchantia was officially revealed under this title at the European Computer Trade Show (ECTS) in April 1992, after missing the original March/April release date announced when it was known as Zeloria. The game was planned to be released in September 1992,Brian Sharp, \\"Blue Print: Curse of Enchantia\\". Amiga Action 36 (September 1992), page 56. but got delayed again to November 1992. The game's original release was accompanied by a promotional campaign with valuable prizes (computers and money) in some magazines such as France's Joystick. Joystick 32 (11/92) pages 116-117. Owners of computers with newer PC operating systems need to run it using DOSBox. Curse of Enchantia was one of the first CD-ROM adventure games, however it can not be played from the CD directly and had to be installed on the hard drive. Virgin Games bundled it with many of the earliest PC CD-ROM drives in 1993. The game was also re-released on CD as part of Encore Multipack, together with Heimdall and Thunderhawk.  Reception  Critical reception of Curse of Enchantia was mostly positive, especially in regard to its graphics and animation. According to The One, overall the game \\"was reasonably well-received.\\" However, the game was derided by some for its confusing user interface system, often illogical puzzle solutions and what some reviewers thought was a lack of quality humor, plot development and atmosphere, attributing it to the absence of text and dialogue. British reviewers in particular have often praised the Amiga version of the game. Brian Sharp of Amiga Action gave this \\"well-made and cleverly constructed package\\" the Amiga Action Accolade award, calling it \\"flawless\\" and \\"easily the best adventure game on the Amiga to date.\\" It hinted that using a joystick for control may make certain sections of the game \\"less annoying to play.\\" Amiga Computing gave it the Gamer Gold award, calling the game \\"excellent\\", \\"down-right bloody enchanting\\" and Core Design's \\"easily greatest and most impressive game yet,\\" and even advising to \\"buy it today because if you don't you will more than likely commit suicide, it's that good.\\" Tony Gill of CU Amiga gave the game the CU Gold Screen award and said that while \\"some of the puzzles are a bit illogical, the further into the game you get the more luxurious it becomes. Around each bend the graphics get better and better.\\" Les Ellis of Amiga Power said it was one of funniest games he has ever played and called it \\"a classic adventure, which with a few tweaks could have easily beaten the Monkey Island [series] and a worthy addition to any collection and will stand as a challenge to any adventurer.\\" According to Amiga Power one year later, \\"with such a high degree of humour this adventure is well on its way to becoming a classic. It's slightly overpriced and some of the puzzles are a little obscure but these are minor quibbles. Overall this is a great game.\\"Amiga Power (1993-09) 29 (Future) p. 108. Atari ST User even called it a \\"contender for the best game of the year.\\"Atari ST User 86, page 77. There was also much positive reception in the gaming press elsewhere in the English world. The \\"absolutely enchanted\\" Ken Simpson from Australia's ACAR said the game's \\"delightful\\" graphics and animation \\"are among the most tastefully executed [he has] ever seen,\\" but noted the problems with its interface system and difficulty.Ken Simpson, \\"Curse of Enchantia\\". Australian Commodore & Amiga Review Volume 10 Issue 4 (April 1993), page 73. One preview in North American magazine Computer Gaming World called it \\"a pretty looking product\\" of \\"a Loom / KQV / Legend of Kyrandia approach,\\"Computer Gaming World 101, page 108: \\"Over There: Foreign Correspondence\\". even as another called it \\"actually more of a multi-screen puzzle game than a traditional animated adventure,\\" adding that \\"gamers with a strong penchant for puzzle should find it entertaining\\" despite its \\"a bit clumsy\\" interface.Computer Gaming World 113, page 266: \\"Sneak Peak\\". Bill Holder of Australia's OZ Amiga called it \\"a light-hearted and funny adventure that appeals to almost everyone\\" and \\"one of the better releases of 1993.\\"Bill Holder, OZ Amiga Vol 1 No 6 (April - May 1993), page 32. On the other hand, Ed Ricketts of Amiga Format called Curse of Enchantia \\"light years behind\\" Monkey Island with \\"no comparison\\" to Monkey Island 2, as \\"the textless interface just doesn't work - despite the designers' belief, you do need words\\" and there is \\"no humour to speak of, no genuinely amusing humour, anyway.\\"Ed Ricketts, \\"Game Review: Curse of Enchantia\\". Amiga Format 41 (December 1992), pages 136-137. Even as a preview in The One Amiga called it a \\"game set to rival even the mightiest of American adventures,\\" the magazine's David Upchurch wrote that \\"the game lacks real humour and atmosphere. This may be partly due to the lack of text in the game - it's hard to relate to the characters you meet,\\" and \\"although entertaining, Curse of Enchantia is to Monkey Island 2 what Smash is to mashed potato,\\" that is \\"just a weaker substitute.\\"David Upchurch, \\"Review: Curse of Enchantia\\". The One Amiga 50 (November 1992), pages 68-70. Lee Perkins of The Age opined that \\"Curse of Enchantia might be seen as a mite disappointing by fantasy gamers with moderately sophisticated tastes.\\"Lee Perkins, \\"Get your kixx from a package\\". The Age, 05/07/1995. PC Gamer UK described it an \\"average generic fare\\" as \\"the graphics are pretty\\" but the game \\"lacks atmosphere and feels too much like a succession of annoyingly vague puzzles rather than an adventure story.\\"PC Gamer UK (August 1994), page 88. In France, Curse of Enchantia was given the high ratings of 84% in G√©n√©ration 4 (PC), and 90% / 91% (Amiga & PC) in Joystick. Joystick 32 (11/92), pages 244-245. The game also received the scores 46/60 from Slovenian Moj Mikro, 79% from Sweden's Datormagazin,G√∂ran Fr√∂jdh, Datormagazin 1/93 (January 1993), pages 42-43. and 8/10 from Serbian Svet Igara. German magazine PC Player gave it only 38%, saying that the game may make the players \\"nostalgic for Sierra titles,\\" PC Player 2/93, page 74. but the reviews from other German magazines were generally better, including the scores of 8.3/12 in Amiga Magazin, 53/60 (Amiga & PC) in Aktueller Software Markt, Michael Anton, \\"Von Hexen & Helden\\". ASM 11/1992, pages 6-8. 68% in both PC Joker and PC Games, PC Joker 1/1993, page 41. Thomas Brenner, \\"Comic Abenteuer: Von Hexen und Baseballspielern\\".

Italian magazines K and The Games Machine gave it their high scores of 802/1000 and 91%, respectively, with K noting the game as accessible for those not speaking English. K 43, pages 68-69. Reception was also strong in Poland, where Curse of Enchantia was positively reviewed in C&A; (95%) and Secret Service (77%), Bartek \\"VOYAGER\\" Dramczyk, \\"Curse of Enchantia: KlƒÖtwa czarownicy\\". Commodore & Amiga 8/93, pages 14-17. Piotr \\"micz\\" Ma≈Ñkowski, \\"Curse of Enchantia\\".

Mariusz Czarnecki, \\"Curse of Enchantia\\". Computer Studio 1/93, pages 18-21. However, in a 1993 ranking of graphic adventures games by Spanish magazine PCman√≠a, Curse of Enchantia received only three stars out of six due to its \\"strange\\" design and despite Core Design's \\"trademark\\" good graphics. PCman√≠a 10, pages 77-78. = Retrospectives = In 1995, Amiga Action ranked it as the eleventh best adventure game on the Amiga. A 1996 feature by France's PC Soluces gave it three stars out of five, stating that the game's interesting characters, surrealist feel and varied graphics were dragged down by \\"a bit weak\\" plot and an interface that was not intuitive enough. PC Soluces 5 (July‚ÄìAugust 1996), page 52. Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the 27th best Amiga game, but noted that \\"proponents of adventure genre's purity\\" to this day dislike the game for its \\"unwise flirt\\" with action-adventure, as well as the 19th best adventure game in history, opining that the lack of written text \\"perfectly\\" fits with the game's story and specific type of humor. It was also ranked as the 26th best Amiga game by Polish console gaming magazine PSX Extreme, noted for its strong playability. In more recent reviews, the website GamersHell found the lack of any text messages and dialogue in the game to be \\"an interesting design element.\\" However, Gry-Online included the lack of even partial descriptions of objects among the reasons why Curse of Enchantia failed to become an outstanding game, along with a too many user interface icons and \\"useless\\" features. An advertisement for Curse of Enchantia was featured in GamesRadar's humor article about \\"what game ads looked like when the SNES was alive\\".Matt Cundy, What game ads looked like when the SNES was alive , GamesRadar, June 23, 2012. Curse of Enchantia was also the first Amiga video game owned by Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw, who in 2012 made a Let's Play video of the PC version of the game, saying it had \\"great graphics, great animation, appalling game design.\\", and lamented much on the fact that the game contained \\"no kind of logic whatsoever\\"Yahtzee Croshaw and Gabriel Morton, \\"How Enchanting\\". Fully Ramblomatic, September 30, 2012. Yahtzee had earlier, in a 2005 interview, said, \\"it was a game I had difficulty putting down, with beautiful scenery and a great sense of humour, although I understand it's looked down upon by modern standards\\", something which he opposed in the 2012 Let's Play, then stating that the game lacked humour, and got a warning from co-commentator Gabriel Morton regarding rose-tinted glasses who likened playing the game to \\"eating a bowl of psilocybin\\".  Legacy  A direct sequel for the game was briefly planned by Core Design. Few details were made available, but it would continue Brad's fight against the witches PCman√≠a 8, page 48. but his sister Jenny was considered to play a much larger role. However, it was never released (in part because of Robert Toone's departure from the company), as the new game \\"has grown up so much during the development that it has simply became a follow up.\\"\\"First impressions\\". CU Amiga (January 1994), pages 70-71. Its working title has still remained \\"Curse of Enchantia 2\\", Joystick 39 (June 1993), page 96. but only \\"for practical reasons\\".Cam Winstanley, \\"The shape of the things to come: Universe\\". Amiga Power 34 (February 1994), pages 16-17. This spiritual successor game ultimately became known as Universe. Released in 1994, the game uses an upgraded game engine of Curse of Enchantia and a similar user interface. Responding to some of the criticism directed at Curse of Enchantia, Core Design described Universe as being \\"a lot\\" more logical and less linear than their first adventure game.\\"Across the Universe\\". Amiga Format 55 (January 1994). They also described the text-based system as an improvement over the use of only icons, its benefits including allowing conversations between characters. They also acknowledged that Curse of Enchantia has \\"suffered considerably\\" due to inclusion of action sequences, something that \\"adventure gamers don't want in their games.\\"Amiga Computing 74 (August 1994), page 143. The game's plot premise has remained notably similar to that of Curse of Enchantia, featuring a young man (the protagonist's name was changed from Brad to Boris, but he also has a sister named JennyDave Cusick, \\"Universe\\". Amiga Computing 78, October 1994.) who is transported to another world which has to save from an evil mage-king. However Universe is more serious in its tone, as the game's humor only serves as comic relief and \\"it was never intended to be as silly as Enchantia.\\" Simon the Sorcerer, a 1994 adventure game similarly featuring a modern boy protagonist transported to a fantasy world where he has to vanquish an evil wizard, was partially inspired by Curse of Enchantia,CU Amiga (April 1993), page 40. Joystick 46, page 76. and a similar cover art was used for King's Quest VII. The game has also inspired the name of the Polish reggae band Enchantia, who chose this name because they thought it \\"feels warm\\". The game's chief artist Rolf Mohr said the cover art for Disney's 2007 film Enchanted could have been inspired by his cover art for Curse of Enchantia. He called it \\"a case of Art imitating Disney imitating Art,\\" since he has been himself \\"definitely\\" inspired by Disney while working on the game.¬øSwipes Encantados?, Rolf Mohr's blog, January 1, 2010. The \\"magical world of Enchantia\\" is the setting of the video game Enchantia: Wrath of the Phoenix Queen, but it does not appear to be otherwise related. Curse of Enchantia was also a \\"pretty big\\" influence on Yahtzee's own adventure games.

His name has been given to revolutionary methods of processing steel and metals used in every industrialized nation of the world. Sendzimir was a holder of the Polish Golden Cross of Merit (from 1938), the Bessemer Gold Medal (from 1965) and the Brinell Gold Medal from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm (from 1974). On the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty he was one of those prominent immigrants honored for their contributions to America. In 1990 Poland's large steel plant in Krak√≥w (formerly the Lenin Steelworks) was renamed to Tadeusz Sendzimir Steelworks. The AIST Tadeusz Sendzimir Memorial Medal was established in the same year. Early years Ostoja Sendzimir was the eldest son of Kazimierz Sƒôdzimir belonging to the Clan of Ostoja and Wanda Jask√≥≈Çowska. Fascinated by machinery as a child, he built his own camera at the age of 13. After studying at the 4th Classical Gymnasium (Gimnazjum Klasyczne) in Lw√≥w he entered the Politechnika Lwowska. However when Lw√≥w was captured by Russian troops the Polytechnic Institute was closed and he moved to Kiev. There he worked in auto services and in the Russian-American Chamber of commerce where he learned Russian and English. The Russian Revolution of 1917 forced Sendzimir to flee to Vladivostok, then to Shanghai, where Sendzimir built the first factory in China which produced screws, nails and wire. Financial support was provided by the Russian-Asian Bank, at the time headed by Poles (W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jezierski and Zygmunt Jastrzƒôbski). Immigration and researches In 1922 Sendzimir married Barbara Alferieff. His first son Michael was born two years later. Designing and making his own machines, Sendzimir began experimenting with a new way to galvanize steel. Despite galvanization, the products still had a tendency to oxidize. Sendzimir discovered that the problem was due to the zinc bonding to a thin layer of iron hydroxide on its surface, rather than to the iron. In 1929 Sendzimir approached several American industrialists with his findings, but since the Great Depression had begun, he was unsuccessful in gaining their interest. Returning to Poland in 1931, he obtained support for the construction of the first industrial-scale galvanizing unit and put several cold strip mills into operation. This process was explained by him as follows: \\"Let's imagine a piece of a hard pastry. We are rolling it on the pastry-board to decrease its thickness. However it would be faster and easier if we asked someone to stretch it by holding the edges\\". A steel mill in Butler, Pennsylvania was established by Sendzimir in 1936. By 1938 Armco Steel became interested in his work and they formed a partnership with him, the Armzen Company, to oversee the worldwide expansion of his galvanizing and mill technology. In the spring of 1939 Sendzimir moved to Middletown, Ohio. Sendzimir's patented mill could roll hard materials down to very light gauges. The U.S. company, T. Sendzimir, Inc., was formed by him in Waterbury, Connecticut, in the 1940s In 1945, he married Bertha Bernoda. The following year he became a citizen of the United States. With the beginning of the Cold War, Sendzimir and his achievements were ignored by Communist Poland and he was not even mentioned in the Polish Encyklopedia Powszechna (Universal Encyclopedia). This changed when Edward Gierek, a new leader of the Polish United Workers' Party, came to power. Sendzimir was awarded an Officer Cross of the Order Polonia Restituta (Krzy≈º Oficerski Orderu Odrodzenia Polski). In 1975 Sendzimir received the honorary degree of doctor honoris causa from the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krak√≥w. Sendzimir's successful methods for galvanizing steel eventually were implemented in the first Z-mill rolling silicon steel, making it pliable enough for use in air defense radar. Between 1953 and 1989 he introduced the first productive Z-mill to Great Britain, and to Japan and Canada in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1974 Sendzimir invented a spiral steel looper used in both the United States and Japan. Ninety percent of the world's galvanized steel production went through the Sendzimir process by the early 1980s. Poland, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Canada purchased his steel mills and technologies over the years. Most notably, Sendzimir was a major financial and personal supporter of the Ko≈õciuszko Foundation, the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America and Alliance College in Pennsylvania. Sendzimir died after a massive stroke and was buried by his family in a zinc-plated coffin made according to his design.

It is native to grassland and similar habitats in a large part of Eurasia, extending from Belgium to the Altai mountains and Yenisey River in Russia. Where abundant the animal is considered a farmland pest, and historically it has also been trapped for its fur. It has declined drastically in recent years and is considered critically endangered. Description Skull of a European hamster Skeleton The European hamster has brown dorsal fur with white patches. The chest and belly are black. The tail is short and furred. It is much larger than the Syrian or dwarf hamsters, which are commonly kept as pets. It weighs and can grow to long with a tail of . Its dental formula is . Behaviour The common hamster is a nocturnal or crepuscular species. It lives in a complex burrow system. It eats seeds, legumes, root vegetables, grasses and insects. It transports its food in its elastic cheek pouches to the food storage chambers. The storage chambers may be quite large and on average contain of food, but exceptionally can be up to . It hibernates between October and March. During this time, it wakes every five to seven days to feed from the storage chambers. The adults reach sexual maturity when they are about 43 days old and breed from early April to August. The gestation period is 18‚Äì20 days and the size of the litter ranges from three to 15 young, which are weaned when aged three weeks. They are usually solitary animals. Distribution and conservation status It is typically found in low-lying farmland with soft loam or loess soils, although it may also inhabit meadows, gardens or hedges. It is found from Belgium and Alsace in the west, to Russia in the east, and Bulgaria in the south. In captivity, the European hamster has an unusually long lifespan, living up to eight years. The Court of Justice in Luxembourg, the European Union's highest court, ruled in 2011 that France had failed to protect the European hamster. The court said that if France did not adjust its agricultural and urbanisation policies sufficiently to protect it, the government would be subject to fines of up to $24.6 million. By 2014, France had started a captive-breeding program, which aimed to release 500 hamsters each year into fields that farmers were paid not to harvest. In 2020, the European hamster was classified as critically endangered across its global range by the IUCN Red List. Although the reasons for its drastic decline are not fully understood, it has been linked especially to habitat loss (for example due to intensive agricultural practices and the building of roads that fragment populations), but also pollution (even light pollution appears to significantly reduce local populations, unless counterbalanced by other factors), climate change and the historical fur trapping.

On July 17, 1806, on the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, the counties of Nassau-Usingen and Nassau-Weilburg both joined the Confederation of the Rhine. Under pressure from Napoleon, both counties merged to become the Duchy of Nassau on August 30, 1806, under the joint rule of Prince Frederick August of Nassau-Usingen and his younger cousin, Prince Frederick William of Nassau-Weilburg. As Frederick August had no heirs, he agreed that Frederick William should become the sole ruler after his death.

It is in the civil parish of Frindsbury Extra, in the Medway Unitary Authority, that is Medway Council. By 1950 it had been absorbed into the neighbouring residential areas of Strood. Wainscott itself is located immediately next to Frindsbury, and is surrounded by beautiful agricultural land, as well as ancient woodlands. It is speculated that the name is derived from the OE meaning Wagonner Cot or Wagon Shed.The Place Names of Kent, Judith Glover, 1976, Batsford. Wainscott History. Archaeological excavations in 2007 on the north-eastern edge of Wainscott revealed evidence for human activity dating from the early prehistoric through to the post-medieval period, and provided important new evidence for Bronze Age, Romano-British and Saxon settlement. By the mid-8th century the kings of Kent were granting estates in the area by charters to the bishops of Rochester and their cathedral. In 738 King Eadberht gave 10 ploughlands at Andscohesham (Stoke) in the territory of Hoo to Bishop Ealdwulf. In 764 King Sigered of west Kent gave 20 ploughlands of arable land at √Üslingaham on the west side of the Medway to Bishop Eardwulf, with seven named denes in the Weald, and this grant was confirmed by King Offa of Mercia. This charter was later regarded as including Frindsbury and Wich, and it seems likely that it included the Wainscott area. These grants were also confirmed to Bishop W√¶rmund in 789 by King Offa, who in later centuries was regarded as the benefactor who had given Frindsbury to the bishopric, under the name of Eslingham cum appendiciis. In 889 Bishop Swithwulf and the cathedral community at Rochester granted to a certain Beorhtwulf half of a ploughland with specified boundaries at Haddun (Haven Street in Frindsbury) with detached meadows at Beckley and Strood. The boundaries include ealden strete, perhaps to be identified as Hoo Road, wen weg, (perhaps an early form of Wainscott?) and Ciolmundesland. By the Late Saxon period the estates of Kent were divided up into lathes and hundreds. The Wainscott area lay in the Lathe of Aylesford and the Hundred of Shamwell. In the late eleventh century the hamlet of Wainscott may have been established by this time at the junction of the crossroads, although there is no written evidence for it. Its name probably means ‚Äòwagon shelter‚Äô, suggesting a subordinate role in the larger estate of Frindsbury. At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086 the manor of Frandesberie (Frindsbury) was held by the bishop of Rochester. It had been assessed at 10 sulungs (971 ha) in 1066. There was a separate manor of Wainscott which had emerged from the parent manor of Frindsbury by the early 14th century. It was also called ‚ÄòParlabien‚Äôs Yoke‚Äô (or ‚ÄòPerleben‚Äôs Yoke‚Äô) after the family which held it at this time. It afterwards descended to the Colepeper family, which held it until the late 16th century. In the years 1494‚Äì1504 it was divided into two halves, and court records survive for one of these moieties. However, very little business was transacted beyond the collection of fines from tenants who failed to attend. If the extent of the manor was really one yoke, it would not have been more than 50 acres (c. 20.2 ha). The fields underlying the north excavation area to the north of Hoo Road were in the manor, as were a series of smaller fields along the south side of the road as far as the stream. Beyond the stream to the north-east were the fields of Islingham manor; to the south of the road lay parts of the manors of Frindsbury and Chattenden. At the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s, the manor of Frindsbury with its appendages was confiscated from Rochester Priory by Henry VIII, but was subsequently passed on to the Dean and Chapter of Rochester in 1542. The manor of Wainscott was sold in the late 16th century, and passed by a series of descents and sales to John Boghurst, who held it in the late 18th century. He still held a court leet and a court baron for the manor at this time. Post-medieval and modern maps and documents indicate that the area of the site comprised a number of agricultural fields, both within Islingham and Wainscott manors ‚Äì extracts taken from www.kentarchaeology.org.uk ‚Äì Prehistoric and Romano-British Activity and Saxon Settlement at Hoo Road, Wainscott, Kent by Nicholas Cooke and Rachael Seager Smith. Tilemaking at Wainscott Chalk Mining & Associated Industries in Frindsbury by Adrian Pearce and Dave Long A map dated 1711 shows this hamlet as consisting of a house and a few cottages known as Windscott, the name probably referring to a collection of cottages in an exposed or windy place. The house was called 'White Horse' and, since the hamlet was situated on a crossroads on the road to the Isle of Grain, it may well have been an inn. By 1838, the name had been corrupted to Wainscott and a local pottery industry was already in existence by 1842. The main works was the Wainscott Pottery owned by a Henry Hone and next to this was a smaller operation owned by Thomas Fox. The reason for their location is easily explained by investigation of the local land ownership at this time. Nearby at Four Elms Hill were two clay pits owned by a William Beadle, who was something of an entrepreneur. Beadle also owned the land to the immediate east of the road in Wainscott and it was here that the potteries were set up. Thus, not only did he sell the clay to the potteries but he also got the rent from their premises as well as the adjacent workers‚Äô cottages. It must have been quite a monopoly for him as well as being rather lucrative. Both potteries produced tiles for the expanding building industry and some may have found their way to London together with the local brick trade. The tithe records also list an Edward Hone (limeburner at Upnor) and a John Hone (brickmaker at Bill Street). It is not known if they were related to Henry Hone but it is possible that this was an example of a family diversifying into all aspects of supplying the building industry. Henry later went on to own the Kings Arms pub and John the Old Oak Inn. By 1858, there had been a change of proprietors and the potteries were now owned by Thomas Baker and Jesse Clark Foster. It is likely that the larger premises belonged to the latter since, in 1877, Foster bought the clay pits from the Executors of Beadle who had by then died. With this assumption, Baker must have sold out after a few years to Messrs Charlton & Matthews since, in the book \\"Industrial Medway\\" by J.M. Preston, they are mentioned in an advertisement dated 1868. This reference is interesting since it shows the diverse range of products being produced i.e. oven & paving bricks and tiles; pan, plain & ridge tiles; sanitary & land drainage pipes; chimney, flower & paint pots; garden & edging tiles. In the meantime, Foster continued to expand his pottery and took his son Theophilus into partnership in 1867. In 1871 they were shown as brick and tile manufacturers but there is no evidence that they had the necessary equipment at their clay pits to make bricks on site. Since it was a competitive business locally, it is more likely that they produced specialised bricks at their premises. In 1882 they sold out to Francis Hazell, who produced bricks, tiles, drainpipes and chimney & garden pots. The 1862 Ordnance Survey map shows a draw well next to each of the potteries. Whereas these may only be water wells, there is also the possibility that they were chalk wells. The census of 1871 lists a William Eloine of Wainscott who was described as an ‚Äòexcavator‚Äô. This is a peculiar term since men who dug clay were normally described as merely labourers and it seems to imply extraction at depth. He could of course have been a local well sinker but, again, the latter term is usually used in census job descriptions. One clue is given in an article on deneholes written by F.J. Spurrell in 1882, when he mentions a denehole (properly termed a chalkwell) which was then being used at Plumstead for a tile works. It is known that a small quantity of chalk was added to normal bricks to prevent shrinkage during firing and possibly this was also done in the case of tiles. If products of a yellow colour were required, like the Stock Bricks, a greater proportion of chalk would have to be added to get the colouration. Thus, it is possible that the local tile works had chalkwells on the premises to obtain their own supplies of chalk. Enumerator‚Äôs Description of Wainscott on 1861 Census Part of the Parish of Frindsbury without the boundary of Rochester. Comprises all the houses and cottages which lies on the south west side of the Land Water Sewer from White Wall Creek to the High Road leading from Hoo to Wainscott, Small‚Äôs Farm and Brompton Farm including the Quarry Farm and Cottages, Chatt Home houses, White Wall Cottages, Manor Farm and cottages. Wainscott both sides, Home Street both sides, and Bill Street both sides with Brompton Farm The History of the Stag Inn, 56 Wainscott Road The 1851 census shows that living at 58 Wainscott Road was a Henry Hove with his family and he was a ‚Äòretailer of beer‚Äô. The 1861 census reveals that Henry Briggs (an agricultural labourer) was living in the same area of Wainscott with his family, his niece and four lodgers. His 22-year-old son George Briggs was described as a ‚Äòlicensed victualler‚Äô & a ‚Äòlabourer in the War Department‚Äô. An Ordnance map for 1871 denotes a BH (beer house) where the current Stag Inn is located. The 1871 census shows a William Perch, a ‚Äòlicensed victualler‚Äô aged 70 was living in the beer house with his wife Anne. 1878 licensing records show that George Cheeseman was then the licensed victualler. The 1881census shows Robert Harris aged 27 ‚Äòlicensed victualler‚Äô living there with his wife and a 16-year-old general servant. The 1891 census reveals that 49-year-old licensed victualler John Potterton lived there with his wife, a bar maid and a general servant. An 1897 Ordnance map denotes a P (Public House) and also states ‚ÄòStag Inn‚Äô. The 1901 Ordnance map denotes ‚ÄòStag Inn‚Äô. The 1901 census shows Jane Potterton aged 59, a widow and licensed victualler living there with a servant, a 14-year-old pot boy barman and two visitors. The 1911 census shows A Francis H Jones aged 46, a licensed victualler living there with his family. In 1918 licensing records show a William B Day, a licensed victualler living there. A 1927 Ordnance map shows ‚ÄòStag Inn‚Äô. The 1930 licensing records show a Samuel Pope, licensed victualler living there. The 1939 Register shows a John Henry Miles aged 68, a licensed victualler living there with a 99-year-old housekeeper. WAINSCOTT MURDERS MOST FOUL The Brompton Farm Road Murder 1942 Ellen Ann Symes had been visiting her parents Thomas & Florence Overy in their Dickens Terrace home in Wainscott. She was widowed and lived in 114 Brompton Farm Road with her four-year-old son Robin J Symes. Her parents walked part of the way home with her up Hollywood Lane with Robin in a pushchair, but then left her to complete the journey whilst they returned home. A man approached Ellen and her son in Brompton Farm Road and stabbed her in her neck, killing her. Robin was able to tell the police that it was a soldier who had attacked his mother. The police quickly found Reginald Sidney Buckfield wandering in army uniform in Strood, they established that he was a deserter and although he protested his innocence, he was charged. Whilst awaiting trial and in custody Buckfield wrote a fictional account of a murder similar in all respects to the Brompton Farm Road murder and it was this hand-written book that was to sway the jury to find him guilty. In his book he cast himself as a private investigator and a mysterious Mr. X as the villain who slaughtered the young damsel (a thinly disguised version of Ellen Ann Symes). His habit of constantly grinning had earned him the nickname ‚ÄòSmiler‚Äô and true to form, he smiled broadly all through his trial and even when he was finally convicted of murder at the Central Criminal Court on the 26th. January 1943. He was given the death sentence, but it was later commuted to life imprisonment. 1 Forsters Terrace Murder 1960 On the 18th. March 1960, William Southon was murdered at his home in Forsters Terrace. William had been drinking at the Steam Packet in Strood and had been befriended by Frank Williams and Herbert Marsh. When William left the pub, he was accompanied by both men. Marsh had said that he would be visiting his girlfriend in Wainscott. Arriving back in the village the two men waited several minutes whilst the victim had settled down in the house. Gaining access via the rear of the premises, Marsh smashed a window and both entered the property. William Southern was tied and gagged with his own shirt. A neighbour having heard a disturbance and muffled screams dialled 999. The police it is reported were on scene in 10 minutes and a search upstairs revealed the two offenders hiding. William Southon had by this time died of suffocation. Wainscott is now bypassed to the east by the 'Wainscott Eastern Bypass' and to the north by 'Wainscott Northern Bypass'. These roads, both named the A289, lead traffic from the A2 to the Medway Tunnel. These two roads meet at the 'Four Elms Roundabout', where the A228 climbs 'Four Elms Hill' and onto the Hoo Peninsula, where the A228 becomes the Ratcliffe Highway, that then passes the Deangate Ridge Golf Club on the left and takes the second roundabout exit on the Main Road into Hoo itself. At the top of Four Elms Hill is the village of Chattenden, that has much MOD land, especially in and around Chattenden Army Barracks. The village has had many homes erected within it on ex-farm/MOD land. These homes were developed by Crest Nicholson and the estate is known locally and officially as 'Liberty Park'. The development includes many different types of accommodation including homes and elderly accommodation for the local residents later years. Wainscott is situated within the parish of Frindsbury Extra. Retail The Wainscott Club as shown in 2014. The site is now home to the Co-operative Food shop. Wainscott holds many different businesses such as a Co-operative Food, a Premier Stores paper shop, a fish and chip shop (The Golden Fish Bar), a Chinese takeaway (Dynasty Chinese) and two pubs (The Stag and The Hop & Rye Micro Pubhttps://whatpub.com/pubs/MED/11919/hop-rye-wainscott). The Wainscott Working Mens Club closed on 28 February 2014. The village of Wainscott also used to have a vehicle garage, known as Hills Motors, which has now re-located to Medway City Estate. The garage was later replaced with accommodation provided by MHS Homes. ReferencesExternal links *Frindsbury Extra Parish Council. Retrieved 22 November 2015.

History Spofforth grew as a village at the time that Knaresborough was the important town in the area with Harrogate and Wetherby being less so. The village saw the building of the castle in the thirteenth century. Eighteenth century Knaresborough road builder Blind Jack Metcalf spent the latter years of his life in the village and is buried in the church yard. Stockeld Park, a Palladian villa was built in the 19th century. The railway came to Spofforth in 1847 with the building of the Harrogate to Church Fenton Line with Spofforth being the only intermediate station between Wetherby York Road station and Harrogate station. The line closed to passengers in 1964 and to goods in 1966 as part of the Beeching axe. Part of this forms the Harland Way cycle path which runs as far as Thorp Arch.  Churches  All Saints' Church is the parish church of Spofforth and Kirk Deighton with Follifoot and Little Ribston. The date of the church's foundation is unknown and it is not mentioned in the Domesday Book. In 1893 a portion of an Anglo-Saxon cross was found built into the stairs of the tower. It is likely that an earlier church existed and was rebuilt between 1175 and 1200, with the doorway in the south porch dating from around this time. The first rector was Henry de Evesham inducted in 1280. Another was William de Melon (1310‚Äì1317) Treasurer of England and keeper of the great seal. The church tower was built in 1450. The earliest bell dates from between 1570 and 1593. The church was restored \\"in an elegant and substantial manner\\" during 1854‚Äì5 under the supervision of the architect, Mr J W Hugall of Cheltenham. It was re-opened in September 1855 by the Lord Bishop of Ripon. There was criticism at the time of the \\"most ugly and objectionable pew\\" which occupied the south side of the church, and the fact that \\"the seats on the north are, consequently, incorrectly arranged\\". James Tripp (1847‚Äì1879) built the church and school at Follifoot and also built the schools at Linton and Spofforth. Spofforth Methodist Church, no longer in active use, is on School Lane. Pubs The village has two pubs, the Castle and the Railway. The Castle is the larger pub in the village and has a single open plan room. The Railway is a small pub owned by Samuel Smith's Old Brewery with a traditional lounge and tap room configuration and was converted from two railway cottages. Two other pubs in the village did exist, the King William IV which closed in the early 2000s and the Prince of Wales in Castle Street closed in around 1927 and is now a private residence (Oulton House). The Prince of Wales served as the place where village inquests were held during the 1800s.

It lies north-west from the center of Budapest. Etymology The name comes from Slavic drug—ä (drug) - a partner, comrade, \\"brother\\". History North of Dorog with the power plant Housing estate The valley between the Pilis and Gerecse mountains has been inhabited since the Neolithic. A Roman military road westwards from Aquincum passed by the present-day town of Dorog, where Roman dwellings with floor heating have been found, along with conduits, graves and milestones. When Hungary's kings resided at Esztergom in the 11th and 12th centuries, Dorog was where the cooks of the castle lodged. Roads from all directions met here in the Middle Ages, and the Chapter of Esztergom had the right to levy custom duties. The name, which appears in the form Durug, Drug and Durugd, is first mentioned in an extant document in 1181. The medieval settlement, destroyed in the Ottoman invasion, remained uninhabited from 1542 until 1649. German settlers then arrived in three waves, followed by Hungarians again. Dorog in the 18th century became a centre of communications again. Regular 19th-century visitors to the posting inn on the Buda‚ÄìVienna road included philologist Ferenc Kazinczy, statesman Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi and magnate Ferenc Wessel√©nyi. New houses and streets sprang up round the baroque Roman Catholic church built in 1767‚Äì1775. The first written contract on mining coal at Dorog, dating from 1845, was drawn up between the Capter of Esztergom and the colliery managers Ferenc Wasshuber and J√≥zsef J√°nos J√ºlke. Thereafter, many great engineers became involved in developing the Dorog mines, including Vilmos Zsigmondy, the geologist Miksa Hantken, and the mining engineers Henrik Drasche and S√°ndor Schmidt, who opened up and directed exploitation of richer and richer seams. Dorog, around the start of the 20th century, was a major mining centre, connected by rail (originally H√âV) with Budapest and by canal with the Danube. In 1906, Dorog's power plant was constructed (which was rebuilt in the 1980s with a high chimney). In 1900 Dorog had 1966 inhabitants (1369 Germans, 477 Hungarians, 55 Slovaks). Budapest's factories and population needed more and more coal in the interwar period, so Dorog developed rapidly. Several housing colonies for the immigrant miners were built in the 1920s and 1930s. So were a large worker's hostel, a new Catholic church, a Reformed church in Transylvanian style (which was constructed by Transylvanian coalminers who moved there after the Treaty of Trianon), two new schools, a kindergarten, a modern hospital, a mine manager's club, mine manager's residences, a town hall, a World War I memorial and a recreation ground. Most of these were designed by the engineer Zolt√°n G√°thy. Some 300 men of Dorog lost their lives in the Second World War. A few years after the war, many Germans were expelled. During the socialist era, Dorog became a typical socialist town with prefabricated blocks of flats. The mines gradually closed, so the government planted several factories (Gedeon Richter company, Hungaroton record plant, a machine factory). Dorog became a town in 1984, the industrial park was established in 1999. Economy There are several factories in Dorog, including: * Panasonic Corp.

In her 35-year history the ship was registered in the merchant navies of the United Kingdom, Latvia and Poland. She was built as Czaritza and later bore the names Lituania, Ko≈õciuszko, Gdynia and Empire Helford. The name Ko≈õciuszko refers to Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko (1746 ‚Äì 1817), a military leader, statesman and Polish national hero. Construction The Russian American Line ordered the ship before World War I to be an ocean liner to carry up to 1,000 passengers between New York and Arkhangelsk. Barclay, Curle & Co Ltd of Glasgow laid her keel in 1914, launched her as Czaritza on 14 February 1915 and completed her that May. Her yard number was 512. As built, Czaritzas tonnages were and . She had twin four-cylinder quadruple-expansion engines driving twin screws. Each engine had a stroke and cylinders of , , and bore. Between them the engines developed 889 NHP and gave her a speed of . The engines were fed by six 215 lbf/in2 single-ended boilers with a total heating surface of . Her boilers were heated by 18 corrugated furnaces with a grate surface of . First World War and Russian Civil War She spent the remainder of the war as a troopship. She was evacuated from Russia during the Russian Civil War. Cunard Line bought her in 1917 and used her to carry troops between the USA and Europe and between the UK and Malta. In 1920 she returned to Arkhangelsk, this time with the Allied expeditionary forces intervening in the Russian Civil War. Between the wars The Russian American Line was a subsidiary of the Danish East Asiatic Company. In January 1921 the ship was transferred to another East Asiatic Company subsidiary, Baltic American Line, who renamed her Lituania. She worked various trans-oceanic routes, including a circular route Halifax ‚Äì New York ‚Äì Copenhagen ‚Äì Gda≈Ñsk ‚Äì LiepƒÅja. In 1930 the East Asiatic Company sold Baltic American Line to Polish owners who renamed the company Polskiego Transatlantyckiego Towarzystwa Okrƒôtowego (\\"Polish Transatlantic Shipping Company Limited\\" or PTTO) and renamed the ship Ko≈õciuszko. On 8 June she reached Gdynia, which became her port of registry on 20 June. She was operated by Gdynia America Line, at first with a mixed Polish and Danish crew, but from 1931 her crew was entirely Polish. She served on the Gdynia ‚Äì Copenhagen ‚Äì Halifax route, and also made short tourist cruises. In 1935 Ko≈õciuszkos tonnages were re-assessed as and and her old code letters were replaced with the radio call sign SPEA. By 1938 she was equipped with wireless direction finding navigation equipment. The delivery of the modern motor ships in 1935 and in 1936 displaced Ko≈õciuszko from transatlantic service. She started to work the Constan≈£a ‚Äì Haifa route in 1935 and a route to South America in October 1936. The delivery of the smaller motor ships and in 1939 made Ko≈õciuszko surplus to requirements so early in 1939 Gdynia America Line withdrew her from service. World War II At the outbreak of World War II the Polish Navy requisitioned Ko≈õciuszko and evacuated her to Dartmouth in the UK before the Invasion of Poland. On 10 November 1939 she was commissioned as ORP Gdynia. Initially she was a troopship, but she was considered unsuitable for service at sea and served instead as a base ship in the UK. She housed a canteen, a hospital, a Naval NCO school and several other offices. In her naval service the ship was visited by, among others, Winston Churchill and King George VI. During a German air raid on Denver, Norfolk, on 25 September, she was hit by two aerial bombs, but swift action by the crew prevented the ship from catching fire. On 30 June 1941 she was decommissioned, restored to Gdynia America Line and reverted to her name Ko≈õciuszko. She was placed under the management of the British Lamport and Holt Line, but was crewed entirely by Poles except for a Lamport and Holt liaison officer. She served as a troopship in the Indian Ocean and Malaya. Japanese aircraft attacked her several times. In 1943 a torpedo hit her but did not explode. She was transferred to the Mediterranean and took part in the Allied Invasion of Sicily. Then she returned to Indian Ocean, this time as a part of United Maritime Authority. After World War II In 1945 the UK repatriated Batory to Poland but the crews of Ko≈õciuszko and another Gdynia America Line ship, Pu≈Çaski, refused to be repatriated. All crew members of both ships signed UK articles and the ships were transferred from Gdynia America Line to the UK Ministry of War Transport, who kept her under Lamport and Holt management. Ko≈õciuszkos port of registration was changed from Gdynia to London. Her call sign was changed to GLSW and she was given the UK official number 142335. In April 1946 the MoWT renamed Ko≈õciuszko as Empire Helford and sold her to Lamport and Holt. She continued to serve as a troop transport and for transportation of displaced persons. In 1949 she was withdrawn from service, and on 2 May 1950 she reached Blyth, Northumberland to be scrapped.

In 2004, Matsuura won the First Penguin Award at the Game Developers Choice Awards in San Jose. This was in recognition for his \\"trailblazing work with beat-rhythm and music games.\\" = Chaka ‚Äì Mami Yasunori ÂÆâÂâáÁúûÂÆü = (Born 16 July 1960) ‚Äì from Osaka. Chaka was the vocalist and lyricist of the band. She began her career at age eighteen, working as a professional jazz singer in an Osaka jazz club, and joined Psy„ÉªS soon after. With Psy„ÉªS, her voice was intensely powerful and lent the band a vocal style instantly recognizable amongst the pop scene of 80s and 90s Japan. After the band's breakup, Chaka began her solo career, reverting to her jazz roots and releasing the albums Delicious Hip (1997), I Found Love (1999), Chaka Jazz (2002), and Love (2003). In 2004, she released an album titled Believin' ~Chaka Jazz in New York, in which she collaborated with famous faces from the jazz world such as Henry \\"Hank\\" Jones. Chaka also recorded some anime songs like \\"Hare tokidoki Buta\\" (theme song, 1998); \\"Card Captor Sakura ‚Äì Ashita e no Melody\\" (opening theme, 2000); \\"Zenmai Zamurai\\" (opening theme, 2006). Today, Chaka performs live jazz gigs in her native Japan and lend her awesome voice to many famous Japanese artists. Among them, she recently participate in chorus for the Tsuyoshi Doumoto' solo unit \\"Endlicheri Endlicheri\\" (album \\"Coward\\", single \\"The Rainbow Star\\", all along \\"The Rainbow Star\\" Tour) and in the single \\"Man & Woman\\" from Chage & Aska.  History  Chaka (Mami Yasunori) met Masaya Matsuura in 1983, and two years later they released an independent album under the band name Playtechs. At this point they were merely an indies unit, and performed no live shows for the album. However, this became the basis of what would become Psy„ÉªS. Psy„ÉªS debuted in 1985 by releasing their first Psy„ÉªS album, Different View, with Sony Music. Their first single from the album, Teenage, went on simultaneous sale. This was their major debut, and a music video was created for Teenage. Psy„ÉªS' activity and popularity continued through the late 80s to mid 90s, where their music was used on TV shows (\\"Mamatte kirei!?\\" ‚Äì 1991), anime (To-y ‚Äì 1987, and City Hunter ‚Äì 1988), and movies (Sweet Home ‚Äì 1989). In particular, Masaya Matsuura was given full musical supervision over the sound of the acclaimed anime adaptation of Atsushi Kamijo's manga To-y (an anime set-piece developed by a \\"dream team\\" of famous Japanese names in terms of directing, character design and art direction), creating a soundtrack which has garnered much praise in anime journalism. As the Anime News Network notes, \\"No mention of TO-Y is complete without speaking of the music, which plays like a best-of album of Japan's progressive pop scene‚Ä¶ For TO-Y, Psy„ÉªS' amazing opening and ending themes, Lemon no Yuuki and Cubic Lovers, are as essential to the show as the characters themselves.\\" During their 1985‚Äì1996 history, Psy„ÉªS released eleven original albums, one live album, three \\"best of\\" collections, seven videos and a DVD. Finally, in the June 1996 issue of Japan's PC Music magazine, Masaya Matsuura officially announced the breakup (later referred to as the \\"demise\\") of Psy„ÉªS. In 2002, a CD collection of their best singles, Golden Best (Singles+), was released, and a live DVD (the band's first) was released in 2005 containing footage from their 1988‚Äì1989 Non-Fiction Tour, when the band were at the height of their popularity.

Early life Schumann was born on 1 May 1906 in Halle an der Saale. His father, Paul Schumann, was also a doctor. Schumann entered the Nazi party in 1930 and joined the Sturmabteilung in 1932. In 1933, he received his medical degree after producing a thesis entitled \\"Frage der Jodresorption und der therapeutischen Wirkung sog. Jodb√§der\\" (\\"The Question of Iodine Absorption and the Therapeutic Effects of so-called Iodine Baths\\"). He started his career as an assistant doctor in the Surgical Clinic of the clinic of Halle University. Nazi doctor From 1934, Schumann was employed in the Public Health Office in Halle. He was recruited to the air force as a physician in 1939. He joined the Aktion T4 Euthanasia program in early October 1939, after a meeting with Dr. Viktor Brack in Hitler's chancellery. In January 1940, Schumann became head of the Grafeneck euthanasia centre in W√ºrttemberg, where mentally ill people were gassed with carbon monoxide in the first gas chamber. In the early summer of 1940, he was ordered to the Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre. Schumann also belonged to a commission of doctors called \\"Action 14f13\\", who transferred weak and sick prisoners from Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Dachau, Flossenb√ºrg, Gross-Rosen, Mauthausen, Neuengamme and Niederhangen concentration camps to the euthanasia killing centers. Auschwitz On 28 July 1941, Schumann arrived in Auschwitz. He worked at Block 30 in the women's hospital, where he set up an x-ray station in 1942. Here men and women were forcibly sterilized by being positioned repeatedly for several minutes between two x-ray machines, the rays aiming at their sexual organs. Most subjects died after great suffering, or were gassed immediately because the radiation burns from which they suffered rendered them unfit for work. Men's testicles were removed and sent to Breslau for histopathological examination. Schumann \\"...chose his test persons himself. They were always young, healthy, good-looking Jewish men, women and girls who looked like old people afterwards. The parts of the body that were treated with the rays were burnt, suppurating. Often the intestines were also affected. Many died. Part of Schumann's control tests, to check whether the radiation had worked, was the so-called semen check: a stick covered with a rubber hose was inserted into the rectum of the victim and the glands stimulated until ejaculation occurred so that the ejaculate could be tested for sperm...\\"Klee, 53 Both kinds of samples were sent to the University of Breslau (today Wroc≈Çaw) for examination. Auschwitz II (Birkenau) where Schumann committed his medical atrocities. Schumann selected some of the women in Block 10 in the main camp of Auschwitz. In this Block Jewish women had been imprisoned for human experiments. To control the radiation on women, prisoner doctors (Dr. Maximilian Samuel, Dr. Wladislaw Dering) had to remove an ovary.Lang, 132-143 Schumann also performed typhus experiments by injecting people with blood from typhus patients and then attempting to cure the newly infected subjects. Schumann left Auschwitz in September 1944 and was appointed to the Sonnenstein Clinic in Saxony which had earlier been converted into a military hospital. Medical career after the war While serving as a military doctor on the Western Front, he was captured by the Americans in January 1945. He was released from captivity in October 1945. In April 1946, he began to work as a sports doctor for the city of Gladbeck. An application for a license for a hunting gun led to his being identified in 1951 so the GDR issued an arrest warrant. According to his own statement, Schumann served as a ship's doctor for three years and because he did not have a German passport, he applied for one in Japan in 1954 and received it under his own name. Schumann then fled, first to Egypt and eventually settled in Khartoum in the Sudan as head of a hospital. He was forced to flee from Sudan in 1962 after being recognized by an Auschwitz survivor. Then he went to Ghana, where he received the protection of the head of state, Kwame Nkrumah, until the dictator was overthrown.https://www.jta.org/1966/10/28/archive/nazi-doctor-in- ghana-admits-sterilizing-30000-jews-killed-80000 In 1966, Schumann was extradited from Ghana to West Germany where the trial against him was opened in Frankfurt on 23 September 1970. Charged with killing 30,000 Jews, Schumann admitted to killing as many as 80,000 Jews, saying \\"I have no numbers\\".https://www.jta.org/1966/08/30/archive/ghana-court-orders- extradition-of-auschwitz-doctor-to-w- germanyhttps://www.jta.org/1966/10/28/archive/nazi-doctor-in-ghana-admits- sterilizing-30000-jews-killed-80000 However, Schumann was released from prison on 29 July 1972 due to his heart condition and generally deteriorating health. He died on 5 May 1983, 11 years after he had been released.

The National Kidney Foundation Singapore scandal, also known as the NKF saga, NKF scandal, or NKF controversy, was a July 2005 scandal involving National Kidney Foundation Singapore (NKF) following the collapse of a defamation trial which it brought against Susan Long and Singapore Press Holdings (SPH). This sparked significant controversy, causing a massive backlash and fallout of donors to the charity; it then subsequently resulted in the resignation of chief executive officer T.T Durai and its board of directors. Allegations surrounding the scandal included the false declarations on how long NKF's reserves could last, its number of patients, installation of a golden tap in Durai's private office suite, his salary, use of company cars and first-class air travel. Former NKF patron Tan Choo Leng, wife of Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, sparked further outrage when she remarked that T.T Durai's pay of \\"S$600,000 a year is peanuts\\". President of the National Council of Social Service, Gerard Ee, has since been appointed as interim chairman of the organisation. A full independent audit on its finances was conducted by KPMG, and a 442-page report released on 19 December 2005 revealed a host of malpractices by the former NKF board and management. Durai was apprehended on 17 April 2006 and charged under the Prevention of Corruption Act by the Police. A S$12 million civil suit to recover funds by the new NKF board against Durai and four other former board members began on 8 January 2007. Initial accusations In August 1997 and December 1998, NKF volunteer Archie Ong and aero-modelling instructor Piragasam Singaravelu respectively were hauled to court separately for defamation when both said that T.T. Durai had been flying first class. The former mentioned in April 1997 that the NKF \\"squandered monies\\" in a casual conversation with former chairman of NKF's finance committee Alwyn Lim,\\"Why so silent, Mr Alwyn Lim?\\", Low Ching Ling, The New Paper, 24 December 2005 while the latter made claims that he had personally seen Mr Durai in Singapore Airlines' first-class cabin. Both paid an undisclosed amount of damages to the NKF, and apologised.\\"T. T. Durai: I should have said, I travel on first class\\", Bertha Henson, The Straits Times, 12 July 2005 News of the suit affected Ong's cancer-suffering father, who eventually passed away in hospital. Shortly after the 2005 scandal broke, Ong mentioned to the press that he felt \\"fully vindicated now. I had more than a hundred calls today to wish me well.\\"\\"Mr NKF, the court-happy combatant\\", Conrad Raj, The New Paper, 13 July 2005 In 1999, NKF tracked down and again sought legal action against Tan Kiat Noi, who allegedly circulated an e-mail from her company e-mail on 5 April, claiming that \\"the NKF did not help the poor and needy, paid its staff unrealistically high bonuses\\"\\"NKF acts against e-defamation\\", Samantha Santa Maria, The New Paper, May 1999 and discouraged members of the public from donating. She later also published a public apology on local broadsheets The Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao, while paying a total of S$50,000 in damages.\\"NKF: Controversially ahead of its time?\\", Susan Long, The Straits Times, 19 April 2004 48 additional workers who forwarded the same e-mail were also sued by the organisation, but the suit was later dropped in consideration that they would face possibly extenuating financial circumstances.\\"Action dropped, don't do it\\", Ng Wan Ching, The New Paper, 22 May 1999 Days since the 2007 civil suit began, there have been calls by the public to redress the grievances of the three abovementioned whistle- blowers.\\"Pay back damages in ' flew first class' suits\\", Lau Guan Kim, The Straits Times Forum, 13 January 2007 In 2001, the National Council of Social Service refused to renew the NKF's \\"Institution of Public Character\\" (IPC) status (which allows it to collect tax-free donations), citing that subsidy figures had been inflated, staff costs had increased by 30% and a \\"disproportionate\\" amount of money was spent on fundraising. Concerns were first raised by both by the Health Ministry and NCSS two years ago. However, the former decided to intervene in January 2002 and reinstated the NKF's IPC status for a full three years.\\"NCSS warned NKF and raised alarm back in 2001\\", The Straits Times, 22 December 2005\\"Regulators wasted opportunity to prevent NKF saga: KPMG report \\", Julia Ng, Channel NewsAsia, 19 December 2005 NKF v. SPH=Allegations in article= The Straits Times published an editorial \\"NKF: Controversially ahead of its time?\\" on 19 April 2004, written by senior correspondent Susan Long. This article became the subject of the dispute, and eventually the lawsuit that led to the scandal. Durai and NKF challenged the first six lines of the article, which claimed that a retired contractor (who declined to - and cannot - be named, for fear of being sued) had 'lost it' when he was asked to install \\"a glass-panelled shower, a pricey German toilet bowl and a (S$1,000) gold-plated tap\\" in Durai's office.\\"Home is home but this office is for charity\\", Low Ching Ling, The New Paper, 26 December 2005 The tap was said to have been replaced later with a different material. NKF shortly issued a letter of demand for an apology, retraction, and payment of damages from the paper's publisher, Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), within 24 hours. Four days after the article's publication, NKF and Durai served a writ on Long and SPH for defamation, demanding S$3.24 million in damages. They claimed that the six paragraphs in the article insinuated the mismanagement of donors' funds, that the installations were scaled down only due to the contractor's protests, and that it had avoided providing further details on that matter. =The proceedings= The trial began on 11 July 2005, with Long and SPH represented by Senior Counsel and MP Davinder Singh, while NKF and Durai were represented by Senior Counsel Michael Khoo. Under cross- examination, it was revealed that Durai collected a monthly salary of $25,000 and collected a 10-month bonus in 2002 and a 12-month bonus in both 2003 and 2004, for a total of $1.8 million over three years. He had access to a fleet of eight chauffeured cars and the NKF paid the taxes and maintenance costs of his personal Mercedes-Benz.\\"The NKF Saga\\" , Siva Arasu, The Straits Times, 17 July 2005 =Case dropped= The case was dropped by Durai on 5 PM on the second day of the trial. Aftermath The Ministry of Health demanded that NKF pay for damages. =Public backlash and controversy= T.T Durai and Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan at a press conference. Durai and NKF's board of directors resigned amidst the scandal. The focus of the scandal turned to the revelation of Durai's S$600,000 pay, which caused widespread feelings of outrage, anger, and betrayal among the general public. Some 3,800 regular donors cancelled their contributions the day after the trial, and NKF's headquarters was vandalised with graffiti. =Mrs Goh's remarks= Following questions about Durai's pay, wife of Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong and patron of the NKF Tan Choo Leng defended Durai, commenting that \\"for a person who runs a big million-dollar charitable organisation, with a few hundred million in reserves, S$600,000 a year is peanuts.\\",\\"Patron: It Must\\", (archived) The New Paper, 14 July 2005\\"Public anger over charity chief's salary\\", John Burton, Financial Times, 14 July 2005 much to the indignation of Singaporeans. The statement was taken as an insult by many, who earn much less a year or even struggle for a living. Blogs and online message boards were quickly flooded with angry comments, and a second online petition requesting Mrs Goh to apologise was started. Jokes on the issue were later circulated, in particular, local satirical website TalkingCock.com published a post featuring a parody 1 peanut bill with a value equivalent to S$600,000.\\"New Singapore Dollar Note Unveiled\\" , Anonymous, TalkingCock.com. Retrieved 23 December 2005 On 16 July 2005, SM Goh said that Mrs Goh regretted the statement. He also said to have explained and shown her several e-mails and letters he had received after the remark was made. In what SM Goh claims to be a separate matter, Mrs Goh has also resigned as patron of the NKF,\\"Ex-NKF patron Mrs Goh Chok Tong regrets remarks about TT Durai's pay: SM Goh\\" , Wong Siew Ying, Channel NewsAsia, 16 July 2005 despite an earlier announcement to remain on the board. =Interim board= On 14 July 2005, TT Durai and the NKF board resigned en masse. Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan appointed Gerard Ee as interim chairman and CEO. =Government responseIndependent investigation= In July 2005, KPMG was commissioned by the new NKF board to study past practices. KPMG published its reporthttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0By83v5TWkGjvdEVONlJXeDZNQ0U in December 2005, with key findings including: * The Board delegated its authority to the Executive Committee, and the Executive Committee in turn delegated its authority to Durai. * In 2003, only ten cents out of every dollar raised were used for dialysis costs. In its 2004 annual report, NKF had claimed that 52 cents out of every dollar went to its beneficiaries. * NKF awarded contracts worth $3 million to Forte Systems and $4 million to Protonweb, second one run by Pharis Aboobacker, a close friend of Durai. Neither project was successfully completed, but no action was taken against the companies. In KPMG's judgment, the terms of the contracts were \\"unusual\\" and the ExCo's disregard of the lack of performance was \\"extraordinary\\". =Apprehensions and subsequent lawsuits= Durai was arrested on 17 April 2006. He was out on bail, but will stand for trial with other members of the old National Kidney Foundation board of directors. He has also agreed to pay back S$4 million to the new NKF and was sentenced to 3 months jail for misleading NKF by fabricating a $20,000 invoice. Richard Yong (the former chairman), Mathilda Chua (ex-director) and Loo Say San (ex-treasurer) were all declared bankrupt on 16 May 2007. After selling personal properties worth $7.5 million, the former left Singapore without permission early on the morning of 17 May but was apprehended on 4 July 2007 in Hong Kong and extradited back to Singapore on 3 August 2007 where he was charged the next day for charges that the NKF levied on him as well as his flight (or fleeing) from Singapore hours before being declared a bankrupt. Yong said that he had left to settle some personal matters. He was sentenced to 15 months in jail for the three charges. Five separate charges were taken into consideration during the sentencing. His sentence will commence from the day that he was extradited back to Singapore. Yong has said that he plans to appeal, but lost the appeal and had to serve out his sentence. However, he was given permission to serve half of his jail term (five months) at home on an electronic tag. =Long-term consequences= The scandal has raised questions about the level of transparency in other institutions in Singapore. Opposition politicians, notably Chee Soon Juan, have noted that the issues at NKF would probably not have been revealed had T.T. Durai not sued the Straits Times. Four people linked to the Singapore Democratic Party held a silent demonstration outside the Central Provident Fund (CPF) headquarters in July 2005, wearing T-shirts emblazoned with \\"GIC HDB NKF CPF Transparency now!\\", thus demanding greater transparency from the Government Investment Corporation (GIC), the Housing Development Board (HDB) and the CPF. The protesters were arrested but later dismissed without charges, with their own countersuit for unlawful detention dismissed with costs. On 21 April 2006, Chee Soon Juan and 12 other defendants were sued for defamation for questioning the government's handling of the NKF scandal in the Singapore Democratic Party's newsletter The New Democrat. New NKF v. Old NKF The civil trial by the new board against the old executive committee ‚Äì former CEO TT Durai, chairman Richard Yong, treasurer Loo Say San, board member Maltilda Chua and business associate opened on 8 January 2007.\\"NKF civil trial kicks off with focus on the way the former CEO controlled the charity\\" , May Wong, Channel NewsAsia, 8 January 2007 Damages of S$12 million are sought for alleged mismanagement, breach of duty and damage and loss to the organisation. Durai was accused of running the charity to his advantage, destruction of documents, and the like, with the new committee asserting that as a charity, NKF as a charity, and Durai as CEO, should be subjected to a higher and more rigorous standard of care. On the third day, Durai accepted all liabilities and all claims against him. The only public statement by Rajah ‚Äì Durai's lawyer ‚Äì was to confirm that his client had dropped out of the matter. Later that day around 17:00 (SST), NKF's lawyer, Shanmugam, confirmed to reporters that Durai conceded; the amount of damages to be paid to the NKF are still to be settled. However, the decision by the other defendants to continue will have implications to other equally liable directors and third parties (Alwyn Lim, Lawrence Chia, Kweh Soon Han and Chow Kok Fong). The result of Durai conceding will make the trial shorter rather than an expected eight-week trial.\\"Durai concedes\\", Bertha Henson, The Straits Times, 11 January 2007 The revelationsSee also * Chilling effect * Corporate abuse * Corporate scandal * Accounting scandals * National Kidney Foundation Singapore * Phua Chu Kang The Movie (2010), which featured the antagonist Lim Lau Pek, owner of an old folk's home, who uses the majority of phone-in donations on lavish personal expenditure ReferencesExternal links * The full chronology of events * ChannelNewsAsia's coverage on the NKF scandal * KPMG's independent audit report into old NKFS (PDF document, 4.4MB) Category:Trials in Singapore Category:2005 in Singapore Category:2005 scandals Category:Singaporean case law Category:Health in Singapore Category:Hoaxes in Singapore Category:Charity scandals ","title":"National Kidney Foundation Singapore scandal"},{"id":"3944566","text":"Secteur √Ñ was a 1990s French rap association based in Sarcelles, France and named after a sector in the region.

She is perhaps best known for her Diccionario de uso del espa√±ol, first published in 1966‚Äì1967, when she completed the work started in 1952. Biography Mar√≠a Juana Moliner Ruiz was the eldest daughter of Enrique Moliner, a doctor and son of a doctor, and Matilde Ruiz. At the age of two, her family moved from Zaragoza to Almaz√°n in the border province of Soria. While a teenager her father left for Argentina and never came back, while Moliner, according to her son Fernando, lived with her mother, sister Matilde and brother Enrique in severe poverty. She pursued her Bachillerato at the Instituto General y T√©cnico Cardenal Cisneros, and obtained a degree in History in 1921 from the University of Zaragoza. She married Fernando Ram√≥n Ferrando, a physics graduate, in 1925 and had four children. Years later the couple moved to Valencia. In 1946, Moliner was put in charge of the library at the Superior Technical School of Industrial Engineers in Madrid, until her retirement in 1970. In the early 1950s, she started work on her Diccionario de uso del espa√±ol, getting up at about five in the morning, working a little, watering her flowers, going to work, having a small siesta before returning to her dictionary work. Her method was to look up words, read newspapers and note words she had heard in the street.  Diccionario de uso del espa√±ol  In 1952 her son Fernando brought her a book from Paris that caught her attention, the Learner's Dictionary of Current English by A.S. Hornby (1948). She had noticed the shortcomings of the DRAE, the official dictionary published by the Real Academia Espa√±ola (Spanish Royal Academy), she was already making notes on terms, so this English book gave her the idea of making a dictionary. By then, she began composing her Diccionario de uso del espa√±ol which she thought she would have finished within two years but in reality it took more than fifteen years of work at her home. In 1955, at the request of the academic D√°maso Alonso, who followed her work with interest and had connections with the Gredos publishing. Moliner eventually signed a contract with them for the future publication of her dictionary, whose typographic edition was extremely laborious. The first edition (and the only one authorized by her) was published in 1966-67 by Editorial Gredos. It was immediately successful and the high regard in which it was held is summed up in Miguel Delibes' observation that \\"it is a work that justifies a whole lifetime\\" (\\"Es una obra que justifica toda una vida\\"). In 1998 a second edition that consisted of two volumes and a CD-ROM, as well as an abridged edition in a volume was published. The third and last revision was published in September 2007 and consists of two volumes. A Mar√≠a Moliner reading campaign is supported by the Ministry of Culture of the Government of Spain. Since 1998, the campaign for the promotion of reading in Spanish towns of less than 50,000 inhabitants has been in the format of a competition aimed at towns meeting these criteria, giving prizes to the best projects or activities for promoting reading among children and young people. It is held under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture and the collaboration of the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces and, since 1992, with the collaboration of the Coca-Cola Espa√±a Foundation. 350 libraries are awarded a prize of books made up of 200 children's and young adults' books. Since 2002 the three best projects receive cash prizes as well. The competition is held annually and all settlements with up to 50,000 inhabitants that have a staffed local library may submit their projects.  Relationship with the Real Academia Espa√±ola  On November 7, 1972, the writer Daniel Sueiro interviewed Mar√≠a Moliner in the Heraldo de Arag√≥n. The headline was a question: \\"Will Mar√≠a Moliner be the first woman to join the Academy?\\". D√°maso Alonso, Rafael Lapesa and Pedro La√≠n Entralgo had recommended her. But the linguist and philologist Emilio Alarcos Llorach was elected instead. Moliner observed: > Yes, my biography is very short, since my only achievement is my dictionary. > I mean, I don't have a long list of works to justify me being admitted [...] > My work is clearly the dictionary. Of course, the fact is that a philologist > has been admitted to the Academy and not me; but if the dictionary had been > written by a man, people would say, \\"Why is this man not a member of the > Academy?\\" She was nominated again in 1979 but this time she lost out to the female poet and academic, Carmen Conde. Violeta Demonte, Spanish professor at Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid remarked about Moliner's dictionary: \\"Since the theoretical bases and the criterion for analysis are not always clear and the basic principles have intuitive origin, the usefulness of her dictionary is uneven.\\" Moliner received the \\"Lorenzo Nieto L√≥pez\\" prize in 1973, awarded by the Academy. In 1981, L. Permanyer wrote a strong critique about what he considered the stance of most academics toward Moliner. Biographical Play In June 2013 Moliner's story was portrayed in a new play by Manuel Calzada P√©rez, El Diccionario (The Dictionary) performed first in Madrid and subsequently brought to London as part of the Festival of Spanish Theatre in London (Festel√≥n), with the actress Vicky Pe√±a in the lead role, alongside Helio Pedregal and Lander Iglesias. Tribute On 30 March 2019, search engine Google commemorated Mar√≠a Moliner with a Doodle on her 119th birth anniversary.

Biography  Petrus Comestor was born in Troyes and was a member of the Church of Notre-Dame, referring to himself as \\"Presbyter Trecensis\\". In approximately 1148, he became Dean of the Chapter and received a benefice. In 1160, he formed one of the Chapters of Notre-Dame at Paris. He then replaced Odo as ecclesiastical chancellor and took charge of the theological school. While in Paris, Petrus Comestor composed and finished his Historia Scholastica dedicated to the Bishop of Sens, Guillaume aux Blanches Mains (1169‚Äì76). Pope Alexander III ordered the Cardinal Peter of St. Chrysogonus to allow Chancellor Peter to charge a small fee on conferring the license to teach. This authorization was personal. In conversation with Alexander III shortly thereafter, Cardinal Peter of St. Chrysogonus described Petrus as one of the three most cultured men in France. Petrus's nickname \\"Comestor\\" (\\"Devourer\\") demonstrated the esteem in which his learning was held. He was a bibliophile and prolific author, although much of his work was not published. Some of his unpublished work included commentaries on the Gospels, allegories on Holy Scripture, and a moral commentary on St. Paul. His Historia Scholastica is a kind of sacred history composed for students. The author begins the sacred narrative at the Creation, and continues it to the end of the incidents related in the Acts of the Apostles. All the books of the Bible are contained therein, except those whose nature is purely didactic ‚Äì the Book of Wisdom, the Psalms, the Prophets, the Epistles, etc. The discourses are abbreviated. Petrus Comestor borrowed frequently from profane authors, especially Flavius Josephus for the beginning of the Gospels. The text is as though paraphrased in a commentary where all data, cosmological, physical, philosophical, theological, geographical, etc., are found. There are numerous inaccuracies and fables. The work consists of twenty books, and often small \\"additions\\" supply geographical or etymological appendices at the end of the chapters. This Biblical history met with great success, as witnessed by the large number of manuscripts, by the mention of his name in all the libraries of the Middle Ages, and the lists of classical books for the universities and schools. The quotations and eulogies where the author was named (cf. the canonist Huguccio, about 1190) and its numerous translations, the first written by the Flemish poet Jacob van Maerlant (‚Ä† c. 1288) and finished on March 25, 1271: Scolastica in dietschen better known as Rijmbijbel, but most of all the Bible Historiale in French. In the fifteenth century, the work was still in great demand, as can be seen by the editions made before 1500 of the Latin text, or of the French translation.Strasburg, 1469, 1483, 1485, 1847; Reutlingen, 1473; Lyons, 1478; Basle, 1486; Paris 1487, etc. MignePatrologia Latina CXCVIII, 1053‚Äì1844. reproduces the Madrid edition of 1699. The sermons of Peter Comestor have left us numerous manuscripts, often under different names. However, the complete and continued series has not yet been published. A series of fifty-one sermons was placed wrongly under the name of Peter of Blois and printed among his work.Migne, CCVII, and CCVIII, 1721, etc. Some believe the work of Hildebert de Mans was also included.Migne, CLXXI, sermon, 7, 15, 17, 21, 22, 23, etc. The sermon in which the word \\"transubstantiation\\" occurs, the ninety third (not seventy third), is not Hildebert's but Peter Comestor's; the word however is already found in Roland Bandinelli (the later Pope Alexander III) before 1150. Other collections, like that of the 114 sermons copied at St. Victor before 1185, are still unpublished. More than twelve manuscripts are in Paris libraries, and all have not yet been unraveled. As a preacher, Peter was subtle and pedantic in his style in keeping with the taste of his time, and of his audience of scholars and professors assembled around the pulpit of the chancellor. The sermons attributed to him during his stay at St. Victor are simple in style, instructive, and natural in tone. Also some verses are attributed to Peter Comestor and a collection of maxims entitled Pancrisis, perhaps that which still exists in a manuscript of Troyes. He often referred his surname in his sermons and in his own epitaph, which he allegedly composed. The words included \\"Petrus eram ... dictusque comestor, nunc comedor.\\" (\\"Peter was I... and called the devourer: now I am eaten.\\") Afterwards, he withdrew to St. Victor's Abbey, Paris and made a profession of canonical life. Petrus Comestor died in Paris, around 21 October 1178 and was buried at St. Victor's. The necrology of the canons mentions him as \\"one of themselves\\".

On 29 August 1996, at 10:22:23 Central European Summer Time, a Tupolev Tu-154M operating this flight crashed in Operafjellet, Svalbard, during the approach to Svalbard Airport, Longyear. All 141 people (11 crew members and 130 passengers, of which 3 were children) aboard the plane were killed, making it the deadliest aviation accident ever in Norway. The accident was the result of a series of small navigational errors causing the aircraft to be from the approach centerline at the time of impact. The Vnukovo Airlines aircraft, registration number RA-85621, had been chartered by Arktikugol, a Russian state-owned coal mining company, to fly Russian and Ukrainian workers to its Pyramiden town on Svalbard. The passengers all belonged to the Russian communities of Barentsburg and Pyramiden. The accident was a contributing cause for Arktikugol's closure of Pyramiden two years later. The accident was investigated by the Accident Investigation Board Norway with assistance from the Interstate Aviation Committee and became known as the Operafjell Accident (). After the accident, there were a series of lawsuits to determine the compensations to the victims' families. History= Flight = The aircraft involved in the accident in January 1993, then operated by BosnaAir Flight 2801 was a chartered flight flown by Vnukovo Airlines on behalf of Arktikugol, which operated mines at the two company towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden in Svalbard. The aircraft was a Tupolev Tu-154M, with registration RA-85621, and serial number 86A 742. Its manufacture date was 14 January 1987. The flight crew consisted of captain Evgeny Nikolaevich Nikolaev (44), first officer Boris Fedorovich Sudarev (58), navigator Igor Petrovich Akimov (50), flight engineer Anatoly Matveevich Karapetrov (38), five cabin crew, and two technicians. The captain had previously landed at Svalbard Airport; the first officer had not. On board were 130 passengers, consisting of Arktikugol employees and their families, three of whom were children. Waiting at the airport for the return flight were another 120 employees and their families. The aircraft left Vnukovo Airport at 04:44 UTC (08:44 MSD). Estimated flight time was three and a half hours, and alternative airports were Murmansk Airport and Severomorsk-3, both in Murmansk Oblast. The flight proceeded normally until descent, following the routing W 29 from Moscow to Padun (west of Murmansk), before crossing to Bod√∏ Flight Information Region over the Barents Sea cruising at FL 350 at an average airspeed of . It then proceeded over non-directional beacons over Bj√∏rn√∏ya, Isfjorden, and Adventdalen. Svalbard Airport, Longyear, is the main airport serving the Svalbard archipelago. It is located on the south shore of Isfjorden, with high terrain to the south, southeast and east. It has a single, 10/28 runway, running roughly east‚Äìwest. The airport has an elevation of above mean sea level (MSL), and has an aerodrome flight information service (AFIS), which is subordinate to Bod√∏ Air Traffic Control Center (Bod√∏ ATCC). The airport is regarded as uncontrolled and does not provide approach service. On that day, all aircraft had used runway 28 due to favorable wind conditions, climb-up conditions, and short distance from the terminal. The weather at the accident area was dominated by a low pressure trough, causing rain showers and wind from at 240‚Äì270¬∞. Visibility exceeded . Between 08:00 and 09:00, a weak trough passed, reducing visibility to and a cloud base at . =Accident= The Tu-154's route of flight and accident location At 07:55 UTC (09:55 local Central European Summer Time, CEST), the crew requested clearance to start their descent. Because of lack of communication with Bod√∏ ATCC, this was not obtained. At 07:56, information from Longyear AFIS was given that there was no conflicting traffic, allowing a descent to MSL. The crew tried to request use of Runway 10, but this was, due to language problems, not understood as such by AFIS. Instead, Longyear communicated the actual weather and informed that Runway 28 was in use. An additional request for use of Runway 10 was again not understood, because of the misunderstanding of the term \\"runway in use\\". Because of this, the crew decided to instead use Runway 28. The crew used Jeppesen charts dated 21 January 1994. According to procedures, both horizontal situation indicators (HSI) were set to 283¬∞, but the magnetic localizer course of 300¬∞ was not set. A global positioning system (GPS) was used as a back-up. No requests were made for VHF direction finding. From MSL until impact, the flight was carried out in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and the flight controlled by automatic stabilization mode, with lateral navigation controlled by the navigator. At 08:10 UTC, the aircraft reached MSL, which is the minimum altitude to Advent and the initial approach altitude. At 08:15:32 UTC, it reached Advent and entered a base turn, reaching a magnetic heading of 160¬∞ at 08:16:28 UTC. While the crew had adjusted for the wind drift, they did not attempt to intercept the magnetic course 155¬∞ outbound from Advent. During this turn, there was a malfunction in the electric trimming mechanism, which caused the piloting pilot to deactivate the aircraft flight control systems' servogear in the pitch channel at 08:15:58. This was again activated at 08:16:42 UTC. At 08:17:08 UTC, the crew started the turn to bring the aircraft to 300¬∞ magnetic inbound, however, the lateral deviation from the outbound magnetic course was 155¬∞, or to the left. At 08:17:57 UTC, the navigator said \\"Ah, abeam eight miles 2801 inbound\\", to which AFIS replied two seconds later \\"Correct\\". This was the last radio communication between the crew and Longyear. At 08:18:30 UTC, the piloting pilot turned off the autopilot pitch channel. For the rest of the flight, the plane continued with autopilot only in roll. Following the aircraft passing through the localizer centerline and having rolled out on 290¬∞, there was a discussion among the crew if the turn had been made at the right time. The initial comment about this was made by the first officer at 08:19:06 UTC. This resulted in a roll out of the turn to final approach and corrective turn to magnetic heading 306¬∞. At this time, the aircraft was from the airport and right of the centerline at MSL with an airspeed of . Instead of intercepting the centerline, the crew continued to track on the right side, nearly paralleling the localizer course. At 08:20:17 UTC, the pilot in command ordered the aircraft turned to 291¬∞, which adjusted for drift resulted in a course close to 300¬∞. At this time, the aircraft had a lateral deviation from the approach centerline of . The aircraft started descending at 08:20:24 UTC. A corrective turn was made at 08:21:13 UTC and completed 11 seconds later at magnetic heading 300¬∞. At the time, the aircraft was descending . The aircraft started turning left at 08:22:05 UTC, and immediately entered an area of turbulence created by the surrounding mountains. During initial approach, the radio altimeter warning had been activated several times, which indicated less than from the aircraft to the terrain. During final approach, the ground proximity warning system was activated nine seconds before impact, which lasted until impact. Six seconds before impact, the radio altimeter warning was activated. At 08:22:23 UTC (10:22:23 local CEST) the aircraft collided with the top of Operafjellet at elevation, located from Svalbard Airport and right of the approach centerline. The aircraft was destroyed and all occupants perished. It is the single deadliest plane crash to have occurred on Norwegian soil. =Recovery= Adventfjorden with Operafjellet, the location of the accident, in the background The Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Northern Norway received a message about the crash at 10:30 CEST (8:30 UTC) and the search and rescue service was immediately deployed. This included seven Norwegian aircraft that were in the area. The area had bad weather with a low cloud height, resulting in difficult searching conditions. The aircraft was found at 12:06 CEST at Operafjellet, east of Svalbard Airport. Most of the aircraft was located on the mountain's plateau, although some debris had slid down a vertical cliff and was scattered along the valley and partially covered by an avalanche. Rescue workers and medics from Longyearbyen Hospital arrived at 12:36, and quickly established that there were no survivors. The responsibility of the recovery was transferred to the Governor of Svalbard on 30 August, since there were no survivors. In addition, police personnel from the mainland were transferred to Svalbard to work with the investigation and recovery. The work was supplemented by local volunteers. Because of the bad weather, which included fog and snow, it was often impossible to transport workers to the plateau, and work therefore started in the valley. Governor Ann-Kristin Olsen traveled to Barentsburg on 30 August to inform the communities about the accident, and distributed ample written information in Russian about the then-known details about the crash. Later in the day, a Russian aircraft arrived with Deputy Minister Aleksandr Petrovich of the Ministry of Emergency Situations along with a team of 11 rescue workers, and representatives from the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC), the Embassy of Ukraine in Moscow, the Federal Air Transport Agency and Vnukovo Airlines. In a meeting that evening, the Governor accepted Russian assistance, while it was confirmed by international agreement that the investigation would be led by the authorities in the country where the accident occurred, Norway. On 31 August, Minister of Justice Grete Faremo visited the Russian settlements as a representative from the Government of Norway. The accident had a large impact on the community, with only 1,600 people living in the two Russian settlements. The population in the communities do not speak Norwegian, and do not have a road connection to Longyearbyen. This made it difficult for the Governor to give accurate and detailed information. Issues were further complicated by erroneous reports in Russian media that there were five survivors. The Governor's cabin in Barentsburg was manned during the aftermath, and bulletins were distributed with updated information in Russian. The accident was one of the factors causing Arktikugol to abandon Pyramiden in 1998. Investigation Agreements between Norwegian and Russian authorities were made on 31 August, where Norway resumed full responsibility for the recovery and investigation, but Russian help was accepted. To allow the Russian workers access from the morning of 1 September, the crew was allowed to fly in and establish a base camp, but no work was to be done until Norwegian supervisors arrived in the morning. However, two people were observed at the wreck at about 20:00 CEST, who were brought to the Governor's offices for questioning. As they were both members of the Russian team, it was decided that the base would be disbanded. There was still fog on the plateau on 1 September, but by 15:00 CEST it was possible to fly a team there by helicopter. Because the fog stayed, the team retained work until 03:00 CEST in the night. In the following days, the fog lifted, making work and transport easier. By 5 September, all bodies had been recovered and the work at the plateau could be terminated. The recovery in the valley was completed two days later. The accident resulted in about 40 journalists staying in Svalbard to cover the story. The Norwegian authority's costs related to the investigation and other activities related to the accident were estimated at 30 million Norwegian krone (NOK). All identification of people was performed in Troms√∏, as a cooperation between Troms Police District, National Criminal Investigation Service and the University Hospital of North Norway. By 18 September, all people had been identified, and the bodies were transported to Russia and Ukraine on 20 September after a short memorial in Troms√∏hallen. An autopsy was performed on all crew members, without finding any abnormalities. The official responsibility for investigating the incident lay with the Air Accident Investigation Board/Norway (AAIB/N), although the investigation and report was a close cooperation with the Interstate Aviation Committee and to a lesser extent, the Federal Air Transport Agency. AAIB/N had the primary responsibility for investigations at the crash site, cooperation with the Norwegian police and the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration, and writing the report. IAC was responsible for handling the investigations in Russia, the reading of the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder, the relationship with Vnukovo Airlines and a test flight. Both agencies agreed that English was to be the language of the final report; English is one of the ICAO languages. =Cause= The official investigation concluded that the flight, regarded as a controlled flight into terrain, was caused by pilot errors and that there was no fault with the aircraft. Contributing factors causing the accident were lack of a procedure for offset localizer approach for setting approach course on the HSIs. Thus, both HSIs were set incorrectly, which along with the course deviation indicator hinted that the plane was being blown to the left and needed to adjust course to the right. Because he was in a stressed situation, the navigator set the GPS in the wrong mode. He also did not have sufficient time to recheck his work, allowing mistakes to happen, and his work was not monitored by the pilots. As the navigator was overworked, it was inappropriate for the first officer to transfer the responsibility of lateral control to him. The AFIS air controller has a different role in Norway than in Russia, and the crew were not aware that they were being given information and advice, rather than orders. Communication with AFIS was left with the navigator, which is a breach of norms. Communication between air control and the crew was problematic, since the crew lacked sufficient English skills. The pilot in command had insufficient crew resource management. After the crew decided to carry out the approach to Runway 28, a new approach briefing was not accomplished. The aircraft overshot the approach centerline when turning inbound, because they did not try to intercept the outbound track from Advent. The crew showed a lack of situational awareness following their uncertainty of the aircraft position in relation to LLZ 28, caused by indications on the HSIs. Situational awareness was also reduced because the pilots did not have a chart in front of them at all times. The crew was not aware that they could check the aircraft location in relation to the centerline with a VDF (VHF direction finder). The crew probably put too much emphasis on the indications displayed by the GPS. The aircraft descended into mountainous terrain without control over the lateral navigation. Despite uncertainty and disagreement in the group, the approach was not abandoned, as the aircraft should have climbed to a safe altitude while the problem was solved. Aftermath The accident was a contributing cause for Arktikugol's closure of Pyramiden two years later. Pyramiden was closed in 1998 and has since remained largely abandoned with most of its infrastructure and buildings still in place. On 20 September, the surviving relatives of each decedent received 2 million Russian rubles (about US$40,000) for each person who died in the accident. Ukrainian relatives stated to Norwegian media that they had not received information about the cause and other issues surrounding the accident. At the time, Ukraine was experiencing very high unemployment, and Arktikugol offered wages many times what was then offered in mainland Ukraine. Many miners not only had to support their immediate family, but also relatives. Vnukovo Airlines stated on Ukrainian television that the relatives would receive US$20,000 per deceased person. About a year after the accident, all relatives had been offered US$20,000, but about two-thirds of them chose not to accept the amount, and instead started a process to sue the insurance company. Their lawyer, Gunnar Nerdrum, stated that according to both Norwegian and Russian law, they could demand at least US$140,000. In February 1998, the Norwegian Ministry of Justice stated that the relatives did not have a right to occupational injury compensation from the Norwegian National Insurance. Because of the Svalbard Treaty, the archipelago is an economic free zone and Arktikugol is exempt from paying social insurance, so its employees did not have a right to Norwegian benefits. Had this been the case, widows would have received about NOK 600,000 per worker. By 1998, a few of the relatives had accepted the US$20,000 compensation, while the rest of them were planning to sue both the airline's insurance company and Arktikugol. Among the issues in the case, which took place at Nord-Troms District Court, was whether the accident was to be considered a working accident, and thus result in injury compensation from the mining company. In November, it was decided that the Ukrainians needed to make a guarantee for NOK 2.5 million to run the case, which they could not afford. They therefore had no alternative than to accept the proposal from the insurance company. In June 1999, the parties agreed on a settlement, where the compensation was not disclosed to the public. It was later disclosed that the settlement was about three times the initial offer from the insurance company. In 1999, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs established a scholarship to help children who lost a parent in the accident to take senior secondary and tertiary education.

All of the inhabitants live in the urban area since there is no rural area. The population has grown by over 25,000 inhabitants since the first census in 2000. Commerce, small industries and service-providing enterprises are the base of the economy. The potential for development, with its stands of trees, water sources, abundant energy and strategic location make it an attractive city for investment. The city is cut by highway BR 040, with a daily traffic of approximately 50,000 vehicles, in addition to the railway line, and this is attracting companies specializing in cargo transport. Where the less privileged economic sectors could afford housing, it is still very dependent on the informal economy, which represents 40% of the base, with civil construction representing 30%, and the rest made up of workers commuting to Bras√≠lia. In recent years Valpara√≠so has been attracting furniture industries and the city has implanted a center (polo) for 120 new furniture factories. At the date of this writing there were approximately 100 furniture stores in the city operated by micro businessmen, with 500 carpenters registered in the area. Health and education In 2007 there were no hospitals. The infant mortality rate was 18.98, well below the national average of 33.0. There were 3 institutions of higher learning. In 2000 the adult literacy rate was 93.1%, one of the highest in the state and well above the national average of 86.4%. *MHDI: 0.795 (2000) *State ranking: 12 (out of 242 municipalities) *National ranking: 679 (out of 5,507 municipalities) History The history of the city is very recent, appearing in 1979 as a housing development with precarious services.

It was constantly beset with shortage of capital for the construction, and was eventually forced to sell its line to the dominant Great Western Railway. It was famous for building the majestic Royal Albert Bridge over the River Tamar, and because of the difficult terrain it traversed, it had a large number of viaducts; because of the shortage of money these were built as timber trestle viaducts, proving to be iconic images but a source of heavy maintenance costs, eventually needing to be reconstructed in more durable materials. Its main line was the key route to many of the holiday destinations of Cornwall, and in the first half of the 20th century it carried holidaymakers in summer, as well as vegetables, fish and cut flowers from Cornwall to markets in London and elsewhere in England. The section from Truro to Falmouth, originally part of its main line, never fulfilled its potential and soon became a branch line. Nonetheless the entire route (with some minor modifications) remains open, forming part of the Cornish Main Line from Plymouth to Penzance. The Truro to Falmouth branch continues: the passenger service on it is branded the Maritime Line. General description Map of the Cornwall RailwayThe Cornwall Railway was conceived because of fears that Falmouth would lose out, as a port, to Southampton. Falmouth had for many years had nearly all of the packet trade: dispatches from the Colonies and overseas territories arrived by ship and were conveyed to London by road coach. The primitive roads of those days made this a slow business and Southampton was developing in importance. The completion of the London and Southampton Railway in 1840 meant that dispatches could be taken on to London swiftly by train. =Controversy over the route= At first the promoters wanted the most direct route to London, even if that meant building a line all the way there, bypassing important towns in Cornwall and Devon. Before the interested parties could raise the money and get parliamentary authority for their line, the Government actually removed the bulk of the packet trade to Southampton, so that most of the income for any new line was removed. Some interests continued to press for the best line to London, hoping that the packet trade would return; if necessary they would link with another new railway, but the huge cost of this proved impossible to raise. A more practical scheme running to Plymouth gradually took priority, and at first the trains were to cross the Hamoaze, the body of water at the mouth of the River Tamar on a steam ferry. This was shown to be unrealistic, and Isambard Kingdom Brunel was called in to resolve the difficulty. He designed the bridge over the River Tamar at Saltash, the Royal Albert Bridge: when it was built it was the most prodigious engineering feat in the world.John Binding, Brunel's Royal Albert Bridge, Twelveheads Press, Truro, 1997, He also improved the details of the route elsewhere. By reaching Plymouth, the company could connect with the South Devon Railway and on to London over the Bristol and Exeter railway and the Great Western Railway. The line was built on the broad gauge. Deprived of the lucrative packet trade, the promoters now discovered that it was impossible to raise the money needed to build the line, and there was considerable delay until the economy of the country improved. The object of linking Falmouth to London was quietly dropped, and the line was built from Truro to Plymouth. At Truro another railway, the West Cornwall Railway, fed in, linking Penzance to the network. Falmouth was much later connected too, but only by a branch line. =Brunel designs a practical route= The terrain crossed by the railway was exceptionally difficult because of the number of north-south valleys intersecting the route. Because of the extreme shortage of money when the railway was being built, Brunel designed timber trestle viaducts; these were much cheaper but they incurred heavy maintenance costs and were eventually reconstructed in masonry or brick, or in a few cases made into embankments. The spindly appearance of these high viaducts made passengers nervous, but they provided a marked impression associated with the line (although Brunel did use the form of construction elsewhere). The shortage of money at construction also forced the company to install single track only. Once in operation, the line was still short of money, but it made some progress in converting the viaducts to more durable materials, and in doubling some sections of the route, but the need to convert to standard gauge in addition was too much and the company was obliged to sell out to the Great Western Railway. If the original plan had been to carry the packet trade, the railway as built developed a considerable agricultural business when it emerged that horticultural produce could be got to London markets quickly. In addition, holiday trade developed as Cornwall became a desirable holiday destination, and as numerous resorts served directly by the railway found favour. The area became branded as \\"the Cornish Riviera\\", rivalling the French Riviera for the well to do and the middle classes. Many branch lines were built to coastal resorts, nearly all by independent companies or later by the Great Western Railway. =The twentieth century= Carnon Viaduct near Perranwell on the Falmouth line, over the route of the Redruth and Chasewater RailwayIn the twentieth century the Great Western Railway encouraged these two traffics by running fast goods trains from the area to London and other population centres, and by heavily marketing the holiday opportunities of Cornwall and providing imaginative train services for the purpose. Mineral traffic developed too. Having been built cheaply, the route was difficult to operate as speeds and traffic density increased, as many sharp curves and very steep gradients militated against efficient operation. On summer Saturdays in later years serious delay due to congestion. Although the Great Western Railway made some improvements in capital schemes in Cornwall, the constructed topography of the main line made large scale improvement prohibitively expensive. From the mid-1960s when holidaymakers began to look abroad for holidays in the sun, the Cornish Riviera inevitably declined, although a significant residual traffic remains. The mineral traffic also continues. Through passenger trains from London continue to operate and the original Cornwall railway route remains the backbone of rail business in the County.P W B Semmens, The Heyday of GWR Train Services, David & Charles Publisher plc, Newton Abbot, 1990, Origins At the time of the accession of Victoria to the throne in 1837, Falmouth (with Penryn) was the largest population centre in Cornwall, at 12,000.Hugh Howes, The Struggle for the Cornwall Railway‚ÄîFated Decisions, Twelveheads Press, Truro, 2012, It had been an important victualling station for merchant shipping during the Napoleonic Wars, but Southampton was increasingly favoured for the continuing packet traffic,Packet traffic was mail and small packages considered to be urgent, that were consigned from the Colonies and other overseas locations and destined for London and commercial centres in England, and vice versa due to its more convenient road and coastal shipping connection to London. Although official assurances had been given about the retention of certain traffics, the construction of the London and Southampton Railway, seriously proposed in 1830 and completed in 1840, alarmed interested businessmen in Falmouth, and it was generally agreed that a railway connection to London was urgently needed. (In fact the Government announced the transfer of all but the South American packet traffic to Southampton in 1842.) Early proposals, in 1835 and 1836, for the railway favoured a route broadly following the Old Road through Launceston and Okehampton, and on to Basingstoke or Reading. This huge undertaking failed for lack of funds, but it established the presumption that the part of this route west of Exeter, the Central Route, was the natural choice, and that the coastal route was not. The Central Route had the principal advantage of providing the shortest route to London, as the object was to secure the packet traffic. The intermediate terrain was largely unpopulated; the route traversed high altitudes, but the topography was easier than a route following the south coast because of the multiple valleys and river inlets near the coast. Later proposals were put forward, now reduced to joining the London and South Western Railway (L&SWR;) near Exeter; the L&SWR; was very gradually extending westward, but these proposals all failed for lack of financial support. Nonetheless a Committee to form a Cornwall Railway had been formed and Captain William Moorsom had prepared detailed plans for a route. False starts in Parliament Torpoint Ferry in 1894 looking west; Moorsom planned to use this for conveying passenger trains; note the gradientsOn 29 May 1842 the Government announced that nearly all the packet traffic would be transferred to Southampton. The traffic forecast for the Cornwall Railway had assumed an income of ¬£123,913 out of total income of ¬£160,548. Thus the Central Route, by-passing the south Cornwall population centres, had lost 80% of its potential income at a stroke. At the same time, the Bristol and Exeter Railway had reached Exeter, and the South Devon Railway to connect to Plymouth was definitely planned. A southerly route for the Cornwall Railway, to reach Plymouth, would secure considerable intermediate traffic, and shorten the route that the company would need to construct. In August 1843 W. Tweedy, Chairman of the Cornwall Railway provisional committee, and William H. Bond, its secretary, approached the Great Western Railway (GWR) and found that the GWR was favourable to the idea of a connection between the Cornwall Railway and the South Devon line (with which the GWR was on friendly terms), but only if the Cornwall Railway adopted the southern route. =Crossing the Hamoaze= Map of Plymouth and Devonport about 1854 Moorsom's route to the \\"Steam Ferry\\" is shown as \\"New Passage Branch\\" (not actually built). The South Devon Railway was originally going to build a branch to Devonport, and the Cornwall Railway was to start from thereDirect assistance was refused, but they were encouraged to promote an independent scheme, and in the autumn of 1844 the prospectus of the Cornwall Railway was produced. The Committee had firmly favoured the southern route, but many interested parties continued to support the northern alignment. Indeed this controversy dogged the company for years, even extending to supporters of the northern route opposing the Cornwall Railway bill in parliament. Moorsom designed a route with constant sharp curves and exceptionally steep gradients, which exposed him to criticism by respected railway engineers. View down Milne Place towards the ferry; Moorsom's route would have descended this gradientThe line was put forward for the 1845 session of Parliament. Captain Moorsom was again the Engineer. The line was to run from Eldad in Plymouth, the intended western terminus of the South Devon Railway, to Falmouth. From Eldad it was to descend at 1 in 30 (close to the present-day Ferry Road) to reach the steam chain ferry (described at the time as a \\"floating bridge\\" or \\"steam bridge\\") at Torpoint, or \\"New Passage\\", and run westwards, south of the River Lynher, climbing to cross Polbathick Creek by a wooden drawbridge, to St Germans. From a few miles west of that point, it would follow the course of the present-day route, but with more numerous and sharper curves and steeper gradients, via Liskeard, near Bodmin and Lostwithiel, then Par and St Austell to near Probus. From that point the line would have diverged (from the present-day route) to Tresillian, crossing the Truro River by a 600 feet viaduct south of the city, to Penryn, crossing the Penryn River from the north by embankment and drawbridge to enter Falmouth. The Torpoint ferry had been in operation since at least 1834, having been developed by J M Rendel. Moorsom appears not to have given much thought to the practicalities of using the crossing, which would have involved through trains being divided and each portion then being propelled down a very steep gradientHowes says 1 in 10 (page 127) onto the ferry boat; and each portion being hauled up a steep gradient and re-formed on the other side. The supporters of the Central Route were able to point out the practical difficulties; Rendel himself gave evidence: > Mr Rendell , engineer, deposed that he constructed the present steam ferry > boats or bridges at the Hamoaze. These were worked by chains, which extended > to either shore; and when wind and tide was strong, the chains formed a > species of arc, and the platform [the deck of the boat] was not at right > angles with the landing place. Considerable difficulty would therefore arise > in bringing the rails of the bridge so immediately in contact with the rails > of the landing place, [in order] that the trains might easily and safely run > on and off the bridge; besides that, a difficulty arose from the great fall > in the tide, which at spring was no less than . [He] was of opinion that by > a train being stopped, divided, and placed upon the steam bridge, and landed > on the opposite side of the Hamoaze, tackled together, and put in motion, a > great delay would be occasioned, independent of the seven or eight minutes > in crossing, of from eight to twelve minutes on each side.Evidence of Rendel > in Lords Committee hearing, reported in Woolmer's Exeter and Plymouth > Gazette, 10 July 1845 =Penryn= Falmouth Harbour showing successive route designsThe embankment across Penryn Creek was similarly ill thought through. There was to be an embankment (or viaduct) with a drawbridge to pass ships to Penryn Harbour; the waterway was tidal, of course, and the sailing ships needed sea room to beat up the channel, and needed to do so at the top of the tide. Steep railway gradients were necessary either side of the crossing. Evidence was given that the obstruction by Moorsom's embankment made it quite unacceptable, and several \\"memorials\\" had been submitted to that effect. In his evidence at the Lords Committee, Moorsom seemed to know little of the formal objections to the scheme.Moorsom's evidence before the Lords Committee, 29 May 1845, quoted in Howes pp 94‚Äì95 =The atmospheric system= Moorsom planned to use the atmospheric system of traction. In this system a tube was laid between the rails, and a wagon with a piston running in the tube led the train. No steam locomotive was required; stationary steam engines at intervals evacuated air from the tube. The advantages seemed considerable: there was no need to convey the weight of the engine, and its fuel and water, on the train; more tractive power could be applied than the early locomotives could provide; and head-on collisions were considered to be impossible. The system had been operating, apparently successfully, on a section of the Dublin and Kingstown Railway (D&KR;) and, less successfully, on the London and Croydon Railway. It appeared particularly appropriate for steeply graded lines like the Cornwall Railway, and it was planned for use on the South Devon Railway. After an inspection of the Dalkey section of the D&KR;, Moorsom reported to the Provisional Committee: > I am of opinion that the system is applicable with certainty and efficiency > to the Cornwall Railway. That a sufficient power may be obtained so as to > work the trains, which I think your traffic will require, at an average > speed of 30 miles an hour for passenger trains, and from 15 to 20 miles an > hour for goods, including stoppages in both cases, and that special trains > may be despatched at greater speed if necessary. The capital cost including the laying of the tube and building the engine houses would apparently be no more expensive than a locomotive line without them: > I am inclined to believe that ... we may find the original or prime cost not > to exceed that which we have all along contemplated for establishing the > locomotive line, ¬£800,000. ... The annual cost will, probably, be reduced by > 20 per cent below what we have heretofore contemplated, and the public will > have the convenience of more frequent trains, which will again re-act in an > increase of traffic.Captain Moorsom to the Provisional Committee of the > Cornwall Railway at a meeting \\"recently\\" held at Truro, reported in the > Taunton Courier, September 11, 1844; original orthography retained. The newspaper report continues: > Captain Moorsom was then instructed to survey the line between Falmouth and > Plymouth, the distance of which he found to be about 66 miles over the line > selected. By using the atmospheric traction on this line, the trains may run > from Falmouth to Plymouth in hours, the Tamar being crossed without change > of carriage by means of the steam-bridge.Editorial in the Taunton Courier > September 11, 1844 The 1845 Bill accordingly included the intention to use the atmospheric system. However, a Parliamentary reportReport from the Select Committee on Atmospheric Railways, House of Commons, 24 April 1845, quoted in Howes on the application of the atmospheric system on railways in general was inconclusive, and only muddied the waters. =The 1845 Bill rejected= The result of the 1845 Bill submission was that the preamble was proved but that the Committee stage in the House of Lords rejected the Bill: this meant that the desirability of the line was accepted, but that the detail of Moorsom's design was considered unsafe. A practical scheme at last Despite the setback, the supporters of the line knew that they were close to getting approval. As a result Moorsom was dismissed and Isambard Kingdom Brunel was asked to design a new scheme for the 1846 session. Brunel brought in William Johnson, whom he fully trusted, to survey and redesign the line. This was a full fresh survey and not simply a tidying up of Moorsom's work. It was ready within three months and was lodged in Parliament with a new Bill on 30 November 1845. Starting from Eldad, the route would curve to the north and cross the River Tamar about two miles above Torpoint, by a fixed bridge, running close to the north bank of the Lynher to St Germans. West of that place, following the general course of Moorsom's design, he considerably improved the curves and gradients. From Probus the line would now run to the northern margin of Truro and then south to Falmouth. This avoided the crossing of the Truro River and the objectionable crossing at Penryn. By now the shortcomings in the atmospheric system were becoming apparent, and nothing more was heard of that system for the Cornwall Railway. Share of the Cornwall Railway Company, issued 16. December 1846 Although the magnitude of the Tamar crossing was daunting, Brunel was persuasive in giving evidence supporting it. In fact the Bill admitted the possibility of using the Hamoaze ferry but Parliament mandated the bridgeHowes, page 133 Detail of how the bridge at Saltash was to be made was vague at this stage, and it may be that Brunel's powers of persuasion deflected detailed examination of this.Howes, pp 134‚Äì135 The line was to be . The authorised share capital was ¬£1,600,000 with borrowing powers of ¬£533,333, and the Associated Companies (the GWR, the B&ER; and the SDR as a bloc) were authorised to subscribe. There were to be branches to Padstow, to the Liskeard and Caradon Railway, and to the quays at Truro and Penryn, and the Company was authorised to purchase the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway, the Liskeard and Caradon Railway and the Liskeard and Looe Union Canal. (None of the branches and purchases were activated in the form envisaged in the Act.) The line was to be of the same track gauge as the GWR. The scheme obtained the Royal Assent on 3 August 1846. Work starts A Cornwall railway boundary stone near Penryn At this time the general financial depression following the railway mania had set in, and apart from a small amount of work near St Austell, little progress in constructing the line was made, except for an investigation of the river bed for the Saltash crossing; this was completed by March 1848. The railway mania was a phenomenon in which a huge number of railway schemes were put forward, when investors imagined that huge gains on investment were certain. Investors overcommitted themselves, and many lost substantial sums; money became scarce even for respectable schemes as subscribers simply had no money to pay calls on their shares. At the same time labour and material prices escalated substantially. At a meeting in February 1851, Brunel informed the directors that if the scheme were reduced to a single line, the whole route could be constructed for ¬£800,000, including the Tamar crossing and all stations. In April 1852 the directors proposed a capital reconstruction that reduced the commitment of subscribers. Many subscribers defaulted on their commitment nonetheless, but the financial reconstruction enabled the directors to proceed with construction between Truro (from the West Cornwall Railway near Penwithers Junction) and St Austell, and shortly after to Liskeard, about in total, as well as, in January 1853, the letting of a ¬£162,000 contract for construction of the bridge over the Tamar. However the severe shortage of money further inhibited progress, with shareholders failing to respond to calls (in which they should have paid for their shares in instalments) and by summer of 1854 more than half the company's shares had been forfeited from this cause. The directors now approached the Associated Companies (a consortium of the Great Western Railway, the Bristol & Exeter Railway and the South Devon Railway) for financial help, and in June 1855 a lease of the line was agreed, by which the Associated Companies guaranteed the Cornwall company's debentures (bank borrowings). This considerably eased the financial difficulties, enabling further contracts to be let. Construction of the Saltash bridge started in May 1854 with the floating out of the \\"Great Cylinder\\"‚Äîthe caisson to be used for founding the central pier in the tideway. In October 1855 the contractor, Charles John Mare, building the Tamar bridge failed, and after a delay, the company started undertaking the continuation of the work itself, under the supervision of Brunel's assistant, Robert Pearson Brereton. The huge undertaking proceeded slowly, but it was completed in 1859. The bridge is about long, with the two great main spans each of and numerous side spans. The total cost was ¬£225,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). A fuller description of the bridge and its construction is in the article Royal Albert Bridge. East of the bridge, the South Devon Railway had planned a Devonport branch from its Plymouth station at Millbay, opened with their line in April 1849. The Cornwall company purchased the branch from them in 1854, and extended it by 1858 to join with the Tamar bridge. The South Devon company extended their station to handle the Cornwall's traffic, and agreed to use of the first half-mile of their railway from Millbay to the divergence of the Cornwall Railway. A Joint Committee with the South Devon company was established to oversee the operation of the Mill BayIn the early days the station name was spelt as two words. station. Construction of the section of route between Truro and Falmouth had been let to a contractor, Sam Garratt, but he had become bankrupt, and the Falmouth section was not pursued at this stage.Howes, page 159 =Opening at last= All was practically ready now, and a train had run from Plymouth to Truro on 12 April 1859. in a ceremony on 2 May 1859 the Prince Consort opened the new bridge, giving consent to naming it the Royal Albert Bridge. The line was opened throughout from Plymouth to Truro for passenger trains on 4 May 1859, and goods trains started on 3 October 1859. Passenger trains were limited to throughout and goods trains to ; due to the shortage of money, the rolling stock fleet was very small and the train service sparse, with correspondingly low income. There was a difficulty about the construction of the Bodmin station (now Bodmin Parkway); it was planned to be at a place called Glynn, but the landowner \\"had originally pressed for the railway to be concealed in a tunnel, a luxury that the company would not be able to afford.\\" There was accordingly a temporary station at Respryn, a little to the west; until the proper station could be completed, \\"the Bodmin traffic will be accommodated at a temporary wooden shed erected near [Respryn]\\".West Briton newspaper, quoted in Howes. Howes cites the date of the newspaper as 5 September 1845, but this seems to be far too early. The proper station was \\"completed shortly after the opening [of the railway\\"]. St Germans station, opened in 1859 and still standingAfter a slow start commercially, by August 1861 the directors of the company recorded their pleasure that large volumes of fish, potatoes and broccoli had been carried from West Cornwall. This had been transported to Truro by the West Cornwall Railway which had a line from Penzance to Truro; the West Cornwall company was a narrow gauge line, and all goods had to be transshipped into different wagons at Truro due to the break of gauge there. =Extension to Falmouth but loss of control= The directors wished to extend their line to Falmouth, the original objective of the line, but money was still very difficult to obtain, and once again the company had to resort to asking the Associated Companies for finance. This was forthcoming in return for a 1000 year lease of the line to the Associated Companies, an arrangement that was authorised by Act of Parliament in 1861. A Joint Committee of Management was set up, consisting of four Cornwall Railway directors, three from the South Devon company, three from the Bristol & Exeter and two from the Great Western. A new start was made on constructing the Falmouth extension, and this was opened on 24 August 1863 (and for goods trains on 5 October). A new dock had been opened at Falmouth since the original plans for the railway, and despite the decline in the significance of Falmouth docks to the railway company, an extension to that location was made, and a connection to the Dock Company's own rail network was made in January 1864. The West Cornwall Railway had been opened as a standard gauge line but there was a legal provision that enabled the Cornwall Railway to demand that they install broad gauge rails. Since this was obviously conducive to more efficient operation, the Cornwall company activated the requirement in 1864. The West Cornwall company was in the same severe financial difficulty as the Cornwall Railway, and had to surrender its line to the Associated Companies, who themselves installed the broad gauge rails. The takeover took effect from 1 July 1865, and broad gauge goods trains started running on 6 November 1866, with passenger trains from 1 March 1867. This significantly improved operations, and with through passenger trains running from Penzance to London, the subordinate status of the Falmouth line was emphasised: it was now simply a branch line, thought of recapturing the packet traffic having long since been forgotten. The Associated Companies amalgamated as the Great Western Railway early in 1876, and that company was now the only lessee of the Cornwall line, and the Joint Committee of Management now consisted of eight Great Western directors and four Cornwall directors. Income creeps up but expenditure accelerates Some small improvement in the financial situation of the company took place over the ensuing years, but the timber viaducts had always been a liability due to their very high maintenance cost, at about ¬£10,000 annually. Replacement of some of them on the grounds of urgent technical need had started in 1871 and was continuing progressively; they were being built of a width suitable for a double narrow gauge line, although for the time being the line was a single broad gauge line. The work was being ordered by the Joint Committee of Management, but in November 1883, the minority Cornwall Railway directors asserted themselves and pointed out that authorising such major works was a matter for the board of directors instead; and the original Cornwall Railway directors were a majority there. The impasse went to arbitration and the arbitrator ruled that under the terms of the lease, the railway was to be maintained as a broad gauge line. As the ultimate cessation of broad gauge operation was by now plain, this frustrated any practical progress on the reconstructions, and in fact no new viaduct reconstructions were started as long as the Cornwall company remained in existence.John Binding, Brunel's Cornish Viaducts, Atlantic Transport Publishers, Penryn, 1993, In the year ending June 1879, the gross receipts were ¬£125,034 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), compared with an average of ¬£130,000 per annum in previous years. Accumulated losses since June, 1866 amounted to ¬£149,384 (equivalent to ¬£ in ); an average of ¬£11,000 per year. A meeting in September 1879 optimistically concluded that it may be some years before there is a surplus for the paying out of dividends, but there was still an ultimate value in Cornwall shares. In fact the separate existence of the company was nearing its end, and in 1888 ordinary shareholders accepted a cash purchase of their shares, and the Cornwall Railway Company was dissolved on 1 July 1889, the line passing fully into Great Western Railway ownership. Now part of the Great Western Railway The St Germans deviationThe train service during the Cornwall Railway years had been of five passenger trains each way daily, calling at all stations; there was an additional train each way in the summer months. As well as the stations themselves there were stops at ticket platforms at Truro and Falmouth, and the journey time was two hours 30 minutes Plymouth to Truro () and a further half-hour to Falmouth (). (The service from Penzance to London was by through carriage, shunted from one train on to another.) For the time being, the Great Western Railway made no effort to improve the train service, and other issues dominated. The decision had been taken to convert the gauge to standard, and preparations for this culminated in the prodigious task of the actual conversion of the Cornwall Railway route in common with the rest of the broad gauge parts of the route over a single weekend, opening as a standard gauge line with a full train service on the morning of Monday 23 May 1892. The line was single track throughout except for a little over a mile from near Millbay to Devonport, but in 1893 further sections of the line were progressively opened in double track, and by early 1904 only the Royal Albert Bridge and a section of about five miles from there to St Germans remained single. Similar work was being undertaken on the line of the former West Cornwall Railway, the route from Plymouth to Penzance now being treated as a unit. The Saltash to St Germans section was by-passed by an inland deviation which was opened for goods trains on 23 March 1908 and for passenger trains on 19 May; the former route section was then closed and abandoned. This left only the Royal Albert Bridge as the only single line section on the main line to Truro (Penwithers Junction). The Falmouth branch was never doubled. Following the amalgamation, plans were put in place for the gauge conversion, which took place over the weekend of 21 May 1892. The replacement of the timber viaducts, started by the Cornwall Railway itself and then suspended, was resumed and between 1896 and 1904 all the remaining timber viaducts on the Plymouth to Truro line were replaced by masonry, or masonry and iron, structures. However, the structures on the lightly trafficked Falmouth branch continued for some years, finally being replaced by 1927.MacDermot, E T, History of the Great Western Railway, vol II, published by the Great Western Railway Company, London, 1931R J Woodfin, The Cornwall Railway to its centenary in 1959, Bradford Barton, Truro, 1972, Remaining Cornwall Railway structures Of the structures built by the Cornwall Railway, the most impressive is the Royal Albert Bridge, still fully operational. Many of the piers of Brunel's original timber viaducts remain today, having been left in place when the replacement viaduct was built alongside. The original viaducts are fully discussed in the article Cornwall Railway viaducts. Many smaller masonry bridges, and the stations at Liskeard and St Germans remain in use. The stations standing at Par and Saltash were also built by the Cornwall Railway, although these were later constructions. The footbridge at St Austell is a rare example of a Great Western Railway footbridge that still retains a roof. On the Falmouth extension there is an original goods shed at Perranwell and a group of 20 workers' cottages at Falmouth. Branches Apart from a short branch at Keyham opened on 20 June 1867 to serve the naval dockyards, no branches were ever built by the Cornwall Railway. Independent railways did however form junctions: the West Cornwall Railway to Penzance (1859), Lostwithiel and Fowey Railway (1869), and the Newquay and Cornwall Junction Railway (1869). Other independent lines were proposed but failed during the economic depression following the collapse of the Overend, Gurney and Company bank, notably the Saltash and Callington Railway, and the Bodmin and Cornwall Junction Railway. The Cornwall Loop was opened at Plymouth on 17 May 1876, forming the north chord of a triangle there, to avoid reversing trains in the terminus at Millbay. It was mainly used by London and South Western Railway trains at first but later found use for fast passenger and perishable goods trains, and is now the main line.

These were all six-wheel vehicles. By 1889 there was 1 less second class but 3 more third class carriages plus 6 luggage vans. Initially 30 mineral and 20 cattle trucks were provided, along with 8 brake vans, 10 carriage trucks, 8 ballast trucks, and 2 timber trucks. By 1889 this fleet had grown to 421 vehicles. There were also 15 vans for carrying meat, and 9 horse boxes.

It is often identified with the hypothetical Nordwestblock. While it remains a matter of controversy, the linguist Maurits Gysseling, who attributed the term to SJ De Laet, hypothesised a Belgian that was distinct from the later Celtic and Germanic languages.Rolf Hachmann, Georg Kossack and Hans Kuhn. V√∂lker zwischen Germanen und Kelten, 1986, pp. 183‚Äì212. According to the theory, which was further elaborated by Hans Kuhn and others, traces of Belgian can be found in certain toponyms such as South-East-Flemish Bevere, Eine, Mater and Melden. Overview The borders of the Belgian Sprachraum are made up by the Canche and the Authie in the south-west, the Weser and the Aller in the east, and the Ardennes and the German Mittelgebirge in the south-east. It has been hypothetically associated with the Nordwestblock, more specifically with the Hilversum culture. The use of the name Belgian for the language is to some extent supported by Julius Caesar's De Bello Gallico. He mentions that the Belgae and the Galli spoke different languages. It is furthermore supported by toponyms in present-day Belgium, which, according to Kuhn, point at the existence of an Indo-European language, distinct from Celtic and Germanic languages. Proponents of the Belgian language hypothesis also suggest that it was influenced by Germanic languages during a first, early Germanicisation in the 3rd century BC, as distinct from the Frankish colonization in the 5th to the 8th centuries AD. For example, the Germanic sound shifts (p ‚Üí f, t ‚Üí th, k ‚Üí h, ≈è ‚Üí ƒÉ) have affected toponyms that supposedly have a Belgian-language origin. Characteristics of Belgian are said to include the retention of p after the sound shifts, a trait that it shared with the Lusitanian language. Names of bodies of water ending in -ara, as in the name for the Dender; -ƒÉnƒÅ or -≈ènƒÅ, as in Matr≈ènƒÅ (Marne River and also the current Mater) and settlement names ending in -i≈èm are supposedly typically Belgian as well. According to Gysseling, traces of Belgian are still visible. The diminutive suffix -ika, the feminizing suffixes -agj≈çn and -astrj≈ç and the collective suffix -itja have been incorporated in Dutch, sometimes very productively. In toponymy, apa, poel, broek, gaver, drecht, laar and ham are retained as Belgian loanwords. See also *Germanic substrate hypothesis  References Sources * M.

History=Early years= The business was founded in 1800 as Richardson, Overend and Company by Thomas Richardson, clerk to a London bill discounter, and John Overend, chief clerk in the bank of Smith, Payne and Company at Nottingham (absorbed into the National Provincial Bank in 1902), with Gurney's Bank (absorbed into Barclays Bank in 1896) supplying the capital. At that time, bill-discounting was carried on in a spasmodic fashion by the ordinary merchant in addition to his regular business, but Richardson considered that there was room for a London house which should devote itself entirely to the trade in bills. This idea, novel at the time, proved an instant success. Samuel Gurney joined the firm in 1807 and took control of Overend, Gurney and Co. in 1809. The Gurneys were a well known Quaker family that had founded Gurney's Bank in Norwich.Gurney family wealth: In Gilbert and Sullivan's 1875 comic opera Trial by Jury, a character describes his accumulation of wealth until at length I became as rich as the Gurneys. Elliott, p. 235 The bank's core business was the buying and selling of bills of exchange at a discount. It was well respected, and expanded rapidly, reaching a turnover double its competitors combined. For forty years it was the greatest discounting-house in the world. During the financial crisis of 1825, the firm was able to make short loans to many other bankers. The house indeed became known as \\"the bankers' banker\\", and secured many of the previous clients of the Bank of England. Samuel Gurney died in 1856. =Liquidation= After Samuel Gurney's retirement, the bank expanded its investment portfolio, and took on substantial investments in railways and other long-term investments rather than holding short-term cash reserves as was necessary for their role. It found itself with liabilities of around ¬£4 million, and liquid assets of only ¬£1 million. In an effort to recover its liquidity, the business was incorporated as a limited company in July 1865 and sold its ¬£15 shares at a ¬£9 premium, taking advantage of the buoyant market during the years of 1864‚Äì66. However, this period was followed by a rapid collapse in stock and bond prices, accompanied by a tightening of commercial credit. Railway stocks were particularly badly affected.The Times, 21 December 1866, p. 8; Issue 25687; col E, \\"Two embarrassed Railway Companies\\" (noting that railway joint stock companies had led the earlier boom, but in the subsequent revaluation both the London, Chatham and Dover Railway and the North British Railway fell insolvent during 1866) Overend Gurney's monetary difficulties increased, and it requested assistance from the Bank of England, but this was refused. The bank suspended payments on 10 May 1866. A run on the bank ensued as panic spread across London, Liverpool, Manchester, Norwich, Derby, and Bristol the following day, with large crowds around Overend Gurney's head offices at 65 Lombard Street.The Times, 12 May 1866, p. 12; Issue 25496; col C \\"The Panic\\". A further article on 14 May 1866, p. 7; Issue 25497; col C, also entitled \\"The Panic\\", reported that events were calming down a bit. The failure of Overend Gurney was the most significant casualty of the credit crisis, although dozens of banks also failed due to the banking panic.Fenn's Compendium of the English and foreign funds. Introduction to the 10th edition, 1869 The firm went into liquidation in June 1866.Ackrill, Margaret and Leslie Hannah. Barclays: The Business of Banking, 1690-1996 (2001) Cambridge University Press, Chapter 1 The financial crisis following the collapse saw the bank rate rise to 10 per cent for three months. More than 200 companies, including other banks, failed as a result.Weedon, A. Victorian Publishing: The Economics of Book Production for a Mass Market 1836-1916 (2003), Ashgate, pp. 47‚Äì48 The directors of the company were tried at the Old Bailey for fraud based on false statements in the prospectus for the 1865 offering of shares. However, the Lord Chief Justice Sir Alexander Cockburn said that they were guilty only of \\"grave error\\" rather than criminal behaviour, and the jury acquitted them. The advisor was found to be guilty. Although some of the Gurneys lost their fortunes in the bank's collapse, the Norwich cousins succeeded in insulating themselves from the bank's problems, and the Gurney bank escaped significant damage to its business and reputation.

Powlett was the younger son of Lord William Powlett, brother of the second Duke of Bolton, by his wife Louisa, daughter of Armand Nompar de Caumont, Marquis de Montpouillon, and granddaughter of Henri Nompar de Caumont, 3rd Duc de La Force. He joined the Army, rising to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Wight from 1733 to his death. Powlett stood for Newtown at the 1727 British general election and after losing in the poll was returned as Member of Parliament on petition on 25 April 1729. At the 1734 British general election he was defeated at St Ives. He was returned as MP for Christchurch at a by election on 3 April 1740, and on 27 December of that year he became Colonel of a newly raised regiment of Marines, which took his name and was later ranked as the 52nd Regiment of Foot. He was returned unopposed for Christchurch in 1741 and 1747. His regiment was disbanded on 7 November 1748. On 2 May 1749 Powlett was made a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath, and on 1 November he was appointed Colonel of what had been George Reade's Regiment, later the 9th Regiment of Foot.

It lies seven miles north of Abergavenny on an old road to Hay-on-Wye at Llanthony. The priory ruins lie to the west of the prominent Hatterrall Ridge, a limb of the Black mountains. The main ruins are under the care of Cadw and entrance is free. The priory is a Grade I listed building as of 1 September 1956. Within the precincts of the Priory are three other buildings with Grade I listed status: the Abbey Hotel, listed on 1 September 1956; St David's Church, listed on the same date, and Court Farm Barn, listed on 9 January in the same year. History=Foundation= The priory dates back to around the year 1100, when Norman nobleman Walter de Lacy reputedly came upon a ruined chapel of St. David in this location, and was inspired to devote himself to solitary prayer and study. He was joined by Ersinius, a former Chaplain to Queen Matilda, the wife of King Henry I, and then a band of followers. A church was built on the site, dedicated to St John the Baptist, and consecrated in 1108. By 1118, a group of around 40 monks from England founded there a priory of Canons Regular, the first in Wales. In 1135, after persistent attacks from the local Welsh population, the monks retreated to Gloucester where they founded a secondary cell, Llanthony Secunda. However, around 1186 another member of the de Lacy family, Hugh, the fifth baron, endowed the estate with funds from his Irish estates to rebuild the priory church, and this work was completed by 1217. There are also letters from Pope Clement III (CSM,i,p. 157‚Äì159), between 1185 and 1188, confirming further grants and gifts to the priory from Adam de Feypo and Geoffrey de Cusack in Ireland. The Priory became one of the great medieval buildings in Wales, in a mixture of Norman and Gothic architectural styles. Renewed building took place around 1325, with a new gatehouse. On Palm Sunday, April 4, 1327, the deposed Edward II stayed at the Priory on his way from Kenilworth Castle to Berkeley Castle, where he is alleged to have been murdered. Llanthony Priory tower and nave =Dissolution= Following Owain Glynd≈µr's rebellion in the early 15th century, the Priory seems to have been barely functioning. In 1481 it was formally merged with its daughter cell in Gloucester, and after 1538 both houses were suppressed by Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. =The 18th and 19th centuries= 1780 engraving of Llanthony Abbey, viewed from the West door The buildings at Llanthony gradually decayed after the Dissolution to a ruin, although in the early 18th century the medieval infirmary was converted to the Church of St David.The Buildings of Wales:Gwent/Monmouthshire, page 339 In 1799 the estate was bought by Colonel Sir Mark Wood, the owner of Piercefield House near Chepstow, who converted some of the buildings into a domestic house The Abbey Hotel, Llanthony:: OS grid SO2827 :: Geograph British Isles ‚Äì photograph every grid square! and shooting box. He then sold the estate in 1807 to the poet Walter Savage Landor. Landor needed an Act of Parliament, passed in 1809, to be allowed to pull down some of Wood's buildings and construct a house, which was never finished. He wanted to become a model country gentleman, planting trees, importing sheep from Spain, and improving the roads. There is still an avenue of trees in the area known as \\"Landor's Larches\\" and many old chestnuts have been dated back to his time.John Sansom \\"Note for Brecon Beacons Park Society St David's Landor described the idylls of country life, including the nightingales and glow-worms in the valley to his friend Robert Southey. However the idyll was not to last long as for the next three years Landor was worried by the combined vexation of neighbours and tenants, lawyers and lords- lieutenant and even the Bishop of St David's. Many of his troubles stemmed from petty squabbles, arising from his headstrong and impetuous nature. He wasted money trying to improve the land, and the condition of the poorer inhabitants. The final straw was when he let his farmland to one Charles Betham whom Landor viewed as incompetent and extravagant and who paid no rent. After an expensive action to recover the debts from Betham, Landor had had enough, and decided to leave the country, abandoning Llanthony to his creditors ‚Äì principally his mother. The estate was administered in his absence by his mother and cousin, but many of the buildings continued to disintegrate thereafter. The Abbey Hotel In 1869, Joseph Leycester Lyne (known as Father Ignatius) founded an Anglican monastic institution in nearby Capel-y-ffin which he named Llanthony Abbey. It survived until 1908, and its buildings were later the home of artist Eric Gill. =Later history= The ruins have attracted artists over the years, including J. M. W. Turner who painted them from the opposite hillside. The priory was acquired by the Knight family in the 20th century. Wood‚Äôs house later became the Abbey Hotel. The remaining ruins are protected by Cadw and entrance to the ruins is free. Footpaths The Offa's Dyke Path runs close by on the Hatterrall Ridge above the Llanthony Valley, and marks the Wales‚ÄìEngland border here. There are numerous footpaths which run from the large car park at the priory up to the Hatterall ridge, and circular walks to the ridge and back are possible.

Rossmore Castle, also known as Rossmore Park, was a castle on the outskirts of Monaghan in County Monaghan, Ireland. It was built in the Gothic style in 1827 and was the seat of the Barons Rossmore, but fell into disrepair in the 1940s when the family moved to Camla Vale, and was demolished in the 1970s. History The building was a 19th- century country house built in the style of a castle. It was originally built for The 2nd Baron Rossmore in 1827 in the Gothic style by the Irish architect William Vitruvius Morrison. The building was dominated by a large square tower with turret and crow-stepped battlements, and had a series of gables and oriel windows. It was extended and remodelled in 1858 by the Irish architect William Henry Lynn. There was rivalry between Lord Rossmore and the Shirleys of Lough Fea, and they competed for many years as to who could boast the largest room in County Monaghan; as a result, the drawing room at Rossmore was extended on five occasions, and the house ended up with three towers, and more than 117 windows in at least 53 assorted sizes and shapes. In latter part of the century was known for its social gatherings and gaiety, with the Prince of Wales being a friend of Derrick Westenra, 5th Baron Rossmore. The 5th Baron was Lord Lieutenant of Monaghan from 1897 until his death in 1921, when he was succeeded by his son William Westenra, 6th Baron Rossmore. After the Second World War, dry rot forced the abandonment of the castle; the family moved to Camla Vale, a more modest Georgian house situated within the estate grounds, and the castle fell into ruins; it was demolished in 1975.

Not to be confused with the later \\"Carry On\\" film-clip compilations or the stage play of the same name. Carry On Laughing is a British television comedy series produced in 1975 for ATV. Based on the Carry On films, it was an attempt to address the films' declining cinema attendance by transferring the franchise to television. Many of the original cast members were featured in the series. Carry on Laughing ran for two series, the first for six half-hour episodes and the second for seven episodes. The episode Orgy and Bess featured the final Carry On performances of both Sid James and Hattie Jacques. The TV series is not as widely known as the original films, which - by contrast - are broadcast regularly on British television. Production The series was conceived after the departures of two long-serving Carry On contributors: writer Talbot Rothwell and actor Charles Hawtrey. Furthermore, Kenneth Williams declined to appear in the series. Other Carry On regulars only appeared in a minority of episodes: Sid James in only the first four, Hattie Jacques in only one; and Bernard Bresslaw appeared only in the second series. In the absence of Rothwell, other writers were brought in. Lew Schwarz and experienced Carry On writer Dave Freeman each wrote six, while Barry Cryer and Dick Vosburgh penned Orgy and Bess. Each episode parodied a famous TV series, film or book. Three episodes feature a character based on Lord Peter Wimsey - Lord Peter Flimsy. Another two episodes are nods to Upstairs, Downstairs, with the character of Hudson the butler parodied as Clodson, and the cook Mrs. Bridges as Mrs. Breeches. The series provided an opportunity for David Lodge - little more than a bit-part player in some of the later Carry On films - to play leading characters. Note ATV had already helped to bring the Carry Ons to the small screen in 1973, when it broadcast What A Carry On, a one-off show hosted by Shaw Taylor featuring clips from the stage play Carry On London and interviews with its stars - Sid James, Barbara Windsor, Bernard Bresslaw, Kenneth Connor, Peter Butterworth and Jack Douglas. It is believed that this footage is missing from the archives. What A Carry On was also the title of a BBC series of classic clips from the films.

The engine was originally ordered from Stephen Balzer (1864‚Äì1940) in New York, but his five-cylinder radial engine design failed to live up to its claims. Langley's chief assistant, Charles Manly, then reworked the engine to produce a design that held the record for power-to-weight ratio for any engine for many years. Manly later worked for Glenn Curtiss, and was one of the team-members who designed the mass-produced Curtiss OX-5. Background The problem with powering the Aerodrome had been known as early as 1898 when work on the person-carrying versions first started. At the time the gasoline engine was a fairly new invention, and no engine in the world had the needed performance. After a short search they decided to contract the development to one of the few engine builders in the area, New York's Stephen M. Balzer. Balzer was a Hungarian immigrant who had a mechanical bent and started designing various devices while working in the watch repair department in Tiffany's. He followed this with a night course in engineering, and struck out on his own to develop what would become New York's first car in 1894, a small four-wheel carriage powered by a three-cylinder rotary engine of his design. Balzer was convinced he could build an engine to Langley's requirements by scaling up his existing design into a larger five-cylinder one. Langley gave him a contract in December 1898, and work started on the new design. Engine development The engine was completed fairly quickly, but proved to be underpowered, delivering compared to the Langley wanted. As would be rediscovered by many engineers after him, Balzer found that scaling up his existing design simply didn't work. Manly worked with him to try to improve the design, but by 1899 it was clear that it wasn't going to work any time soon. Balzer never gave up on the engine, and continued to work on it for years, eventually going bankrupt. Every engineer Manly met on a trip to Europe in 1900 told him the rotary design was hopeless. Manly eventually became convinced as well and started work on adapting one of the existing Balzer engines into a non-rotating radial engine. The main concern was cooling, which he solved by welding a jacket to each cylinder and filling it with water. The results were promising, and the engine was soon delivering , double its previous output. This version was soon in place on a -scale model of the \\"Great Aerodrome\\", which flew successfully in 1901. Encouraged by this success, Manly started scaling up the engine with larger cylinders and new lightweight pistons. The resulting design weighed , and delivered , making it by far the most powerful lightweight engine of its era, far outperforming the one that would eventually be successful on the Wright Flyer. The engine was delivered in March 1903 and installed on the Aerodrome for testing that summer. In September the aircraft was moved to a launch platform on a houseboat in the Potomac River. With Manly aboard as pilot, the Aerodrome crashed in spectacular fashion in its first test on October 7. Langley had also fallen prey to the \\"scale it up\\" problem, and the full-sized model of what was a sturdy -scale model was hopelessly fragile. A second test also ended in a crash into the river on December 8. Manly survived both times. In 1914 Glenn Curtiss used the engine in the heavily modified Aerodrome in an effort to break the Wright brothers aircraft control system patent. In additional flight tests the Curtiss team used a different and more modern engine. Years later the Smithsonian Institution asked Manly for a monograph about the engine, and he wrote an account that significantly downplayed Balzer's contribution, reducing it to supplying a non-working design that he rebuilt. Balzer's family was upset, and the Smithsonian eventually wrote a much more balanced version.

() is a Philippine television variety show broadcast by GMA Iloilo and GMA Bacolod.https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2006/08/14/352784/smooth- silk-takeover/amp/ Hosted by Jigo Mambo, John Arceo, Leez Quimpo, Em Capalla and Joan Jalandoni, it premiered on October 1999. The show concluded on September 2, 2007. The show was popular for its segments \\"Pok Gi Pok\\", a gay boxing challenge where two gay contestants battle it out using oversized hand gloves; and \\"Bongga Babes\\", a bikini-open contest featuring the sexiest babes in Western Visayas. It also featured some of the hottest Ilonggo bands and dance groups in Western Visayas, with the special participation of some of the most popular GMA Kapuso stars flown in from Manila every now and then to join the \\"Bongga!\\" gang. Because of the show's own brand of fun and vibrant entertainment rarely seen in other local variety shows in Visayas and Mindanao, \\"Bongga\\" has earned the tag \\"Pinasahi sa Tanan\\" (Different among others). Early years Launched in October 1999, \\"Bongga\\"'s format was musical variety. Its shows were previously taped-as-live alternately from different shopping malls in Iloilo and Bacolod. The original hosts were Hector Gloria, Lara Alba, Debbie Pelor and Ansab Urpiana, with 93.5 Campus Radio (now Barangay 93.5) DJs Jigo Mambo and Billy d' Kid acting as on-air video jocks (VJs). However, after the show's first season, \\"Bongga\\" was reformatted as a gay-oriented variety program, with Jigo Mambo and Billy d' Kid joining Hector as main hosts. It started dishing out portions like \\"Palarong Pambakla\\", \\"Pok Gi Pok\\" and \\"Binibining Bonggay\\" that generated a lot of controversy among the conservative groups in Western Visayas. Despite the criticism, \\"Bongga\\" got high ratings basing on these segments alone and it helped them overcome the more established \\"Barkadahan sa S na S\\" of ABS-CBN TV 4 Bacolod. Soon after, \\"Bongga\\" began touring other places and campuses in the Philippines, conquering places like Cebu, Boracay, Sagay City, Guimbal, Miag-ao, Dumaguete, Davao and Baguio. \\"Bongga!\\" also marks the distinction as the only musical variety show that aired live from a prison building, when they held a show at the Iloilo Rehabilitation Center in 2002. The show earned a tagline \\"Kalingawan sg Masa\\" (Entertainment of the Masses/Aliwan para sa Masa) as viewership slowly increased and soon became the top local variety show in Western Visayas. The Biggest Local Variety Show in Western Visayas In August 2005, the show set a record in Western Visayas as the only local variety show that attracted more than 20,000 live audience when they taped an episode at SM City Iloilo featuring stars from \\"Darna\\" and \\"Encantadia\\" led by Angel Locsin, Dennis Trillo, Sunshine Dizon, Karylle and Jennylyn Mercado. \\"Bongga\\" also served as a front-act for Eat Bulaga during the Grand Kapuso Fans Day held at the Iloilo Sports Complex in Iloilo City last September 17, 2005, performing before a record crowd of 60,000 people. Among the stars that graced the Kapuso Fans Day Special were the SexBomb Girls, Janice de Belen, Gelli de Belen, Carmina Villaroel, Ogie Alcasid and German Moreno. The All- New \\"Bongga!\\" In October 2005, \\"Bongga\\" was relaunched with a new logo banner unveiled by two gay impersonators who jumped from the top of the Iloilo Business Hotel, which was then the tallest structure in Iloilo City. Prior to the relaunch, the show reformatted back to its original musical variety format in 2003, while retaining the gay-oriented portions it was famous for. Original host Jigo Mambo was joined by new hosts John Arceo (who came from \\"Bongga\\"'s defunct rival show \\"Barkadahan sa S na S\\" of ABS-CBN Bacolod and also a character actor), Gilbert \\"Onal\\" Golez (who was born in Iloilo and had a short stint in Manila as a singer), and Ilonggo talents Joan Jalandoni, Apol Arro and Leez Quimpo. The show also had a grand anniversary show held at the Iloilo Freedom Grandstand with Kapuso stars Nadine Samonte, Ara Mina and Alfred Vargas as special guests. Over 20,000 people witnessed the event. Milestone episodes Last January 27, 2006, talents of \\"Bongga\\" hosted the GMA Kapuso Night at the Iloilo Freedom Grandstand that featured some Kapuso stars from \\"Etheria\\", GMA KiliTV, and \\"SOP\\". The event was attended by more than 30,000 people. On April 2, 2006, 24 Oras news anchor and TV host Mel Tiangco guested in \\"Bongga!\\" to promote the upcoming Easter Sunday episode of \\"Mel and Joey\\" where the entire show will feature the tourist spots and delicacies of Iloilo and Bacolod together with the StarStruck Final 4 of Marky Cielo, Jackie Rice, Gian Carlos and Iwa Moto. The particular episode was shown on Easter Sunday. On April 29, 2006, \\"Bongga!\\" host Cherry Mae Barbo participated during the Aliwan Festival's Reyna ng Aliwan pageant as Iloilo's representative. Barbo won 2nd runner-up despite not winning any special awards. On August 5, 2006, \\"Bongga!\\" once again successfully staged a big show during the 2nd Grand Kapuso Fans Day held at the Iloilo Sports Complex Covered Gym in Iloilo City. Over 10,000 people attended the event. In October 2006, \\"Bongga!\\" was active on tour again as part of GMA's Kapuso Weekend Fever which featured big-named GMA Kapuso Stars touring Iloilo, Bacolod, Cebu and Davao. The show also celebrated its 7th anniversary on October 13, 2006 at the Iloilo Freedom Grandstand, with Nadine Samonte, Marvin Agustin and Cueshe as guests. On January 26, 2007, \\"Bongga!\\" once again staged a successful show at the Iloilo Freedom Grandstand during GMA's Kapuso Night where selected GMA stars led by Wendell Ramos and Jennylyn Mercado performed before a huge crowd. On January 27, 2007, the show promoted the new telefantasya \\"Super Twins and \\"Lupin during the Dinagyang eve show at SM City. During the summer season, \\"Bongga!\\" was able to cash in on GMA's nationwide \\"Sumamer Ka Na\\" campaign by bringing viewers to different festivals around the country like \\"Aliwan Festival\\" and \\"Wow Villa\\". Reformat On the second week of July, the show underwent a major revamp as GMA Iloilo publicly announced auditions for new on-cam talents and will hire people to be part of their production staff. Positions for TV director, writers and segment producers were also declared as open. In the coming weeks, the show introduced new segments and new hosts. While the transition was on-going, Jigo Mambo, Leez Quimpo, Em Capalla and Angel handled the hosting chores. The fate of other hosts like John Arceo, Onal Golez and Joan Jalandoni were not known, although John and Joan has since returned to the show. Last July 26, 2007, \\"Bongga!\\" held a musical special entitled \\"Kapuso Serbis-Yo! Live Bongga!\\" (Service! Live Extravagant!) at the Iloilo Freedom Grandstand. Despite the intermittent weather, the show went on and showcased different local talents from the field of music and dance from different genres. It was a total deviation from the usual fare that \\"Bongga!\\" offers every week to Ilonggo televiewers as the hosts talked less and gave the spotlight to local talents complemented with an explosive performance by Kamikazee band from Manila. The new format of \\"more production numbers, less talk\\" was introduced on July 14, 2006 at Robinson's Place Iloilo. \\"Bongga\\"'s new all musical variety format is meant to keep the show a notch higher than its competitors and be at par with the Manila variety shows. In August 2007, \\"Bongga!\\" lost out to rival show \\"Sabado Barkada\\" of ABS-CBN 4 Bacolod in the ratings game based on the July ratings for Nielsen Media Research in Iloilo City. Although both shows were airing on different days (Sabado Barkada airs on Saturdays), the comparative ratings showed that \\"Sabado\\" posted higher ratings. \\"Bongga!\\" decided to bring back the parlor games it was known for, complete with elements of reality TV. The Dinagyang Controversy On January 28, 2007 \\"Bongga\\" hosts Jigo Mambo and Joan Jalandoni joined forces with some talents of ABS-CBN to host the Dinagyang awarding ceremonies. As part of the ceremonies, both ABS-CBN and GMA Network provided their talents to entertain the crowd while waiting for the results. One character on the show, Josef Mary, enjoys the taste of his own pee. The show was supposed to start at around 5 pm Philippine time. However, because of some delays in the preparation, the Dinagyang Foundation organizers decided to start the program proper at 6 pm. At the same time, the organizers gave 30 minutes each for both networks to provide entertainment. GMA Network was allowed to go first, and brought in Gabby Eigenmann and Sunshine Dizon to perform. Each talents were allowed to perform 2 songs. Gabby was able to perform while Sunshine's performance was abruptly cut. Video footages from GMA Iloilo's newscast \\"Ratsada\\" showed two instances that Sunshine Dizon's performance was sabotaged. The first came after Sunshine's first song, Jigo Mambo approached her for a short interview but their microphone audio went off and instead an audio from Sky Cable's talent came in. The second incident came after Sunshine's supposed 2nd song when in the middle of her performance, a lady host from ABS-CBN came up the stage and hyped the crowd with the arrival of ABS-CBN talent Matt Evans of \\"Pedro Penduko\\" fame. With her was \\"Bongga\\"'s Joan Jalandoni who was there to control the situation but her microphone went off. The apparent sabotage earned the ire of Sunshine Dizon and her mother Dorothy Laforteza. Also the management of ABS-CBN Iloilo was hands off after the incident, denying any involvement on their part. The Dinagyang incident gave 15 minutes of nationwide fame for the two \\"Bongga\\" hosts Jigo and Joan, since the whole incident was aired over GMA's \\"24 Oras\\". Joan was also among those interviewed about the incident together with Sunshine Dizon, Gabby Eigenmann and ABS-CBN Iloilo Station Manager Charie Ginete-Ilon. Farewell Episode \\"Bongga!\\" aired its farewell episode last September 2, 2007 without much fanfare. Conspicuously, its main hosts Jigo Mambo and John Arceo were absent while female host Joan took hosting duties with 2 gay hosts. At the closing credits, the message that read Madamo nga salamat, Kapuso! 1999-2007 (Thank you very much Kapuso) was shown on the screen capped with the Kapuso logo. \\"Bongga!\\" went off the air at the height of its popularity, and it consistently retained its status as one of the premier top-rating local variety shows outside of Metro Manila.

It opened a short section to Nanpean in 1869, the remainder being built by the Cornwall Minerals Railway who took over the company in 1874. Its main traffic has always been china clay. Chronology * 1864 Newquay and Cornwall Junction Railway Act * 1869 Line opened * 1874 Taken over by the Cornwall Minerals Railway * 1892 Converted to standard gauge * 1896 Amalgamated with Great Western Railway History Map of Newquay and Cornwall Junction Railway at opening Joseph Treffry had opened a tramway to connect mines and pits in the Hendra and St Dennis area of Cornwall in 1849. His tramway was horse-operated and led to Pontsmill, where transshipment was necessary to a canal, also built by Treffry, for onward conveyance to Par Harbour. The practical limitations of his line were insignificant at first, but as time passed were seen to inhibit trade. The Cornwall Railway opened in 1859, providing a broadly west-to-east line giving easier access to markets for the extracted minerals, but although the lines crossed at Par, there was at first no connection; moreover the Cornwall Railway was built on the broad gauge and Treffry's line on the standard gauge, then usually referred to as \\"narrow gauge\\". The Cornwall Railway opened a station at Burngullow in 1863 and this was used as a railhead for some china clay production, which was carted to the station. On 4 July 1864 the Newquay and Cornwall Junction Railway was authorised by Act of Parliament to build a 5¬º mile line from Burngullow to connect with the St Dennis branch of Treffry's Newquay line.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959John Vaughan, The Newquay Branch and its Branches, Oxford Publishing Company, Sparkford, 1991, Burngullow is located about 2 miles (3 km) west of St Austell station, on the Cornwall Railway main line. The authorised capital was ¬£36,000.Date of Act according to Carter; Vaughan says 14 July 1964. Vaughan quotes the capital as ¬£27,000; probably borrowing powers of ¬£9,000, the usual one-third proportion, was authorised, making the ¬£36,000 total. The company was authorised to make agreements with the Treffry Estate Trustees to convert the Newquay tramway line to broad gauge and take it over, connecting Newquay to the Cornwall Railway. The company would reach Hendra, \\"affording direct communication with Newquay, Par, Fowey and Falmouth\\".From a prospectus partly quoted in Vaughan, page 127; there is ambiguity whether this prospectus was issued prior to the first Act, or after it. Access over the Treffry lines would involve a break of gauge. In fact difficulties in raising the required funds prevailed for some time; in addition the route was required to be alter; an authorising Act was obtained in 1868 for an 82 chain (1.65 km) deviation, as well as permitting more capital. At last the short main line ( in length) was opened from Burngullow to Drinnick Mill Clay Works, near Nanpean on 1 July 1869. The company had exhausted its funds and abandoned plans to extend further. The offices for the company were at Par and shared with the Lostwithiel and Fowey Railway.Bradshaw's Railway Manual, Shareholders' Guide and Directory (1871).E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway, vol II, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931: page 289 In 1872 it was agreed to lease the line to the newly formed Cornwall Minerals Railway which would complete the connection to the Newquay Railway. It would also convert both this and the Par Tramway for steam engines, and connect these together and with quays at Fowey. The lease took effect from 1 June 1874 but the company never received everything that it had been promised and took legal action against the Cornwall Minerals Railway. The Newquay and Cornwall Junction Railway directors stopped meeting in 1885. The Great Western Railway took over the operation of the Cornwall Minerals Railway from 1 October 1877 and was amalgamated with this company on 1 July 1896. In the meantime, the line had been converted to standard gauge along with all the other lines west of Exeter over the weekend of 21 May 1892, finally enabling through trains from Burngullow to St Dennis Junction.Alan Bennett, The Great Western Railway in Mid Cornwall, Kingfisher Railway Publications, Southampton, 1988, The railway has only ever carried goods traffic. The line no longer extends to St Dennis, but the original line still carries china clay from Parkandillack to Fowey. Locomotives The contractor who built the line, William West of St Blazey, also contracted to operate the railway. The Cornwall Minerals Railway operated the same or similar locomotives, but these were withdrawn when the Great Western Railway took over operation. An engine shed was provided at Burngullow. It is unclear how many locomotives were operated but two have been positively identified. * Newquay, an 0-4-2ST which had previously worked the South Wales Mineral Railway. * Phoenix, a tank engine which may have come from Roland Brotherhood, an engineer at Chippenham. Present day trains are usually powered by EWS Class 66 locomotives.

Designed and built by architect Jean- Pierre Cluysenaer between 1846 and 1847, they precede other famous 19th- century European shopping arcades such as the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan (Italy) and The Passage in St Petersburg (Russia). Like them, they have twin regular facades with distant origins in Vasari's long narrow street-like courtyard of the Uffizi in Florence, with glazed arched shopfronts separated by pilasters and two upper floors, all in an Italianate Cinquecento style, under an arched glass-paned roof with a delicate cast-iron framework. History The galleries were designed by the young architect Jean-Pierre Cluysenaer, who determined to sweep away a warren of ill-lit alleyways between / and / and replace a sordid space where the bourgeoisie scarcely ventured into with a covered shopping arcade more than in length. His idea, conceived in 1836, was finally authorised in February 1845. The partnership , in which the banker Jean-Andr√© Demot took an interest, was established by the summer, but nine years were required to disentangle all the property rights, assembled by rights of eminent domain, during a process that caused one property owner to die of a stroke and a barber, it was said, slit his throat as the adjacent house came down. 19th-century view of the south entrance to the galleries Construction started on 6 May 1846. It lasted for 18 months, and the passage was inaugurated on 20 June 1847 by King Leopold and his two sons. In 1845, the named the three sections of the new passage the /, the / and the /. The ensemble, called the (\\"Saint-Hubert Passage\\") has borne its present name since 1965. Under its motto (\\"Everything for everybody\\"), displayed in the fronton of its palace-like facade, the Saint-Hubert Passage attracted people of fashion. Brilliantly lit, it offered the luxury of outdoor caf√©s in Brussels' inclement climate, in an ambiance of luxury retailers that brought to Brussels the true feel of a European capital. In the premises of daily newspaper, on 1 March 1896, the first public showing of moving pictures took place of the cinematographers Lumi√®re, fresh from their initial triumph in Paris. A theatre inside the galleries, the Th√©√¢tre des Galeries Saint-Hubert, was designed by Cluysenaer and opened 7 June 1847. It became one of three royal theaters of Brussels, playing operetta and revues. Its interior was rebuilt in 1951. In 2008, the Royal Galleries were submitted for World Heritage inscription and are included in UNESCO's \\"Tentative List\\" in the cultural heritage category. Nowadays, the King's Gallery is home to the Museum of Letters and Manuscripts and honours the greatest men and women of art, history, music, the humanities and science. Architecture The galleries consist of two major sections, each more than in length (respectively called /, meaning \\"King's Gallery\\", and /, meaning \\"Queen's Gallery\\"), and a smaller side gallery (/, meaning \\"Princes' Gallery\\"). The main sections (King and Queen's Gallery) are separated by a colonnade at the point where / crosses the gallery complex. At this point, there is a discontinuity in the straight perspective of the galleries. This \\"bend\\" was introduced purposefully in order to make the long perspective of the galleries, with its repetition of arches, pilasters and windows, less tedious.

Founded in August 1983, the school was proposed by the founder of the Science Park Kwoh-Ting Li. NEHS is administered by the Ministry of Education, National Science Council and the Science Park Administration. With the exception of the rigorous \\"Advanced Math and Science Class\\" of the Senior High School department, NEHS only admits children of employees of private enterprises in the Science Park, government organizations, the Industrial Technology Research Institute, National Chiao Tung University, and National Tsing Hua University. In 2009, the school adjusted qualification and number of enrollment in response to the national decline of birth rate and to late-2000s financial crisis (which impacts the employment status of parents working in the Science Park). International Bilingual School at Hsinchu Science Park (IBSH), formerly known as the Bilingual Department, is affiliated with NEHS and provides a rigorous American-style curriculum supplemented with a mandatory Mandarin Chinese language program in addition to other national education requirements dictated by the Taiwanese government. IBSH is located on the same campus as NEHS. Location The school is in a residential district of \\"Phase I\\" of Hsinchu Science Park, on its eastern border with \\"Phase III.\\" The school is about 5 km southeast from Hsinchu Station, the center of downtown Hsinchu City. The school is close to the Hsinchu city's eastern border with Zhudong, Hsinchu county. This map cannot be directly linked. See \\"Hsinchu City\\" -> \\"East District\\" in the menu; English translation of the place names in the map is based on the \\"Principle of Place Names Translation\\" published by Ministry of Interior on December 30, 2003. It is built on a westward slope. Lake Placid (also called \\"Artificial Lake\\", a pond built by the Science Park) is in the northwest of the school, next to its field and track ground. In the west of the school is the Jinshan Temple, first built by Chinese settlers in 1853, renovated in 1889, preserved as a class three historic site in 1986, and renovated in 1991. (This webpage is written by Ho, a teacher from the elementary department, and some of her students. This is written before Taiwan Geographical Name Information System, and many names are transliterated or translated in irregular forms.) The temple is the center of a broader historic region called \\"Jinshan Mian\\" including today's Science Park. Jinshan Mian (, also written as \\"Kin-San-Mian\\") was named and developed by Hakka and Hokkien settler organization in the late 18th century. Before the development, this region was a mountainous buffer between Chinese immigrant territory in the west and aboriginal territory in the east. Further west is the residential district of the Science Park, where many students live. In the southwest and the south is the industrial district of the Science Park, where many parents of the students work. In the east of the school, before its main entrance and across Jieshou Road, is the \\"Jinshan Road area\\". This is a grid-planned area with Jinshan Road as its main street. It is a residential and commercial district developed by the Science Park in the late 1990s to accommodate houses relocated by \\"Phase III\\" development of the park. There are many restaurants in this area. In the north of the school (along the Jieshou Road) is Guandong Police Station. Further north is the World Senior High School. Further north is the northern end of Jieshou Road () which connects to Guangfu Road (), a main east-west artery of Hsinchu City. This section of Guangfu Road is known as \\"Guandong Bridge\\" (), which is also a commercial district thriving on the Science Park. There are stations of Hsinchu City Bus and many students take buses from here to go west to the downtown or go east to Hsinchu county. History On March 23, 1982, Kwoh-Ting Li, the then Minister of the Executive Yuan, chaired a special meeting, during which the proposal of establishing National Experimental High School at the Science-based Industrial Park was formally approved by representatives from the Ministry of Education, National Science Council, academic and research institutions, and as well as universities in the neighborhood of the Science Park. Later, in August 1983, National Experimental High School at the Science-based Industrial Park was formally founded. The first enrollments included one senior high class, three junior high classes, and three bilingual classes with one kindergarten class. =Principals= Deputy Director Ning-Ruo-Chu of Park Administration served concurrently as the first principal of the school. On March 1, 1984, the Ministry of Education appointed Yu-Cheng Chang as the second principal to replace Ning-Ruo-Chu who had resigned. The Elementary Department was established later in August of the same year. Four years later, in September 1988, Principal Yu-Cheng Chang's resignation was approved. I-Ming Chiu was then appointed by the Ministry of Education as the third principal. In February 1995, Chiu retired, then after that, Dean of Academic Affairs Hsiao- Yin Tai served as acting principal. In June of the same year, a committee made up of representatives from the Ministry of Education and the National Science Council, as well as scholars, parents, and teachers, elected Dr. Li-Ming. Later, in September 1988, Principal Yuri-Cheng Chang's resignation was approved. I-Ming Chou was then appointed by the Ministry of Education as the third principal. After Chiu retired in February 1995, Dean of Academic Affairs Hsiao-Yin Tai served as acting principal. In July 1995 a committee made up of representatives from the Ministry of Education and the National Science Council, as well as scholars, parents, and teachers, elected Dr. Li-Ming Tai as the fourth principal through an open process, which was the first case of its kind in this country. In September 2003 principal Li-Ming Tai's term ended, and Dr. Wu Rong-Fong elected as principal. In August 2009 principal Wu Rong-Fong resigned to accept the post of principal at The Affiliated High School of National Chengchi University, Dean of Academic Affairs Hsing-Neng Chung served as acting principal. In September 2009 Dr. Christine Huang, dean of the Bilingual Department, was appointed as principal.  Uniforms  The High school uniform is: Pink shirt, Dark blue skirt and pants.

Commissioner of the President of Ukraine for the Affairs of the Crimean Tatar People (2014-2019). He is the recognized leader of the Crimean Tatar National Movement and a former Soviet dissident. Biography=Life in the Soviet Union= Dzhemilev was born on 13 November 1943 in Ay-Serez, Crimea, then Russian SFSR, though at the time under Nazi German occupation. He was only six months old when his family, with the rest of the Crimean Tatar population, was deported by Soviet authorities in May 1944, soon after Soviet forces retook the peninsula.International Committee for Crimea ‚Äì Surgun: Deportation of Crimean Tatars (18 May 1944) He grew up in exile, in the Uzbek SSR. At the age of 18, Dzhemilev and several of his activist friends established the Union of Young Crimean Tatars. He thus began the arduous and long struggle for the recognition of the rights of Crimean Tatars to return to their homeland. Between 1966 and 1986, Dzhemilev was arrested six times for anti-Soviet activities and served time in Soviet prisons and labor camps and lived under surveillance.Crimean Prosecutor Threatens Tatar Council With Crackdown by Philip Shishkin, Wall Street Journal (5 May 2014) Dzhemilev is also remembered for going on the longest hunger strike in the history of human rights movements. The hunger strike lasted for 303 days, but he survived due to forced feeding. He was expelled in the second year from the Tashkent engineers of irrigation and reclamation of agriculture \\"for unworthy behavior\\", namely the writing of historical work on the history of Turkic culture in the Crimea before the elimination of the Crimean Khanate from \\"nationalist\\" positions.–î–∂–µ–º–∏–ª–µ–≤ –ú—É—Å—Ç–∞—Ñ–∞ In May 1989, he was elected to head the newly founded Crimean Tatar National Movement.

After the preliminary results of the referendum were announced, he held a joint press conference with the Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davutoƒülu. Dzhemilev declared that the Mejlis had a stance identical with Turkey in considering the referendum illegal and claimed that the results were manipulated by Russia.Davutoƒülu: Referandumun sonu√ßlarƒ± kabul edilemez, H√ºrriyet (17 March 2014) In April 2014, Dzhemilev was handed a document on the Ukrainian border informing him he is banned by federal law from entering Russian territory for five years. The typewritten document was unsigned, with no official heading, and was made public by the Crimean Tatar parliament, the Mejlis. A spokesman for the Russian Federal Migration Service (FMS) said the agency did not have any information on the travel ban. On 3 May, Dzhemilev tried to cross the \\"border\\" between the Kherson oblast and the breakaway Republic of Crimea, but he was unable to do so, due to Russian occupational forces blocking the road with tanks. Russian authorities then issued an arrest warrant for Dzhemilev and placed him on the federal wanted list, allegedly for trying to illegally cross the border when he attempted to return to Crimea.  Awards  Dzhemilev has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize several times, by various NGOs and persons. In October 1998, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees awarded Dzhemilev the Nansen Medal for his outstanding efforts and \\"his commitment to the right of return of the Crimean Tatars.\\" In an interview Dzhemilev gave shortly after receiving the Nansen Medal, he emphasized that \\"when violent means are used, innocent people die, and no just cause can justify the taking of innocent lives.\\" The Crimean Tatar National Movement has been marked by persistent reliance on non-violence. On 14 April 2014, Dzhemilev was awarded the Order of the Republic by Turkish President Abdullah G√ºl. On 3 June 2014, Dzhemilev was awarded as the first recipient of the Solidarity Prize, by the Republic of Poland. *Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise of the V grade (2001, Ukraine) *Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise of the IV grade (2003, Ukraine) *Order for Merits to Lithuania (2015, Lithuania) *Order of Liberty (2018, Ukraine) See also * Crimea * Crimean Tatars * List of Crimean Tatars * Islam in Ukraine NotesReferences For more information about Mustafa Dzhemilev and related links to his interviews and writings, see the Web site of the International Committee for Crimea.

S√∏ren Kierkegaard was a 19th-century Danish philosopher who has been labeled by many as the \\"Father of Existentialism\\"McGrath, Alister E. The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Modern Christian Thought. Blackwell Publishing, 1993. p 202, although there are some in the field who express doubt in labeling him an existentialist to begin with. His philosophy also influenced the development of existential psychology.Matustik, M. J. and M. Westphal (eds). Kierkegaard in Post/Modernity, Indiana University Press, 1995, Kierkegaard criticized aspects of the philosophical systems that were brought on by philosophers such as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel before him and the Danish Hegelians. He was also indirectly influenced by the philosophy of Immanuel Kant.Green, Ronald M. Kierkegaard and Kant: The Hidden Debt. SUNY Press, 1992, He measured himself against the model of philosophy which he found in Socrates, which aims to draw one's attention not to explanatory systems, but rather to the issue of how one exists.See for example, Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments: \\"Socrates' infinite merit is to have been an existing thinker, not a speculative philosopher who forgets what it means to exist‚Ä¶ The infinite merit of the Socratic position was precisely to accentuate the fact that the knower is an existing individual, and that the task of existing is his essential task.\\" Swenson/Lowrie translation (1941), pp. 184‚Äì5. One of Kierkegaard's recurrent themes is the importance of subjectivity, which has to do with the way people relate themselves to (objective) truths. In Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, he argues that \\"subjectivity is truth\\" and \\"truth is subjectivity.\\" Kierkegaard conveys that most essentially, truth is not just a matter of discovering objective facts. While objective facts are important, there is a second and more crucial element of truth, which involves how one relates oneself to those matters of fact. Since how one acts is, from the ethical perspective, more important than any matter of fact, truth is to be found in subjectivity rather than objectivity.Hong, Howard V. and Edna H. \\"Subjectivity/Objectivity.\\" S√∏ren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers. Vol. 4. Indiana University Press, 1975, pp. 712‚Äì13. Note on pseudonyms Many of Kierkegaard's earlier writings from 1843 to 1846 were written pseudonymously. In the non-pseudonymous The Point of View of My Work as an Author, he explained that the pseudonymous works are written from perspectives which are not his own: while Kierkegaard himself was a religious author, the pseudonymous authors wrote from points of view that were aesthetic or speculative. One exception to this is Anti-Climacus, a pseudonymous author developed after the writing of The Point of View: Anti-Climacus is a religious author who writes from a Christian perspective so ideal that Kierkegaard did not wish it to be attributed to himself.Kierkegaard, S√∏ren. Papers and Journals, trans. A. Hannay, London, Penguin Books, 1996. Because the pseudonymous authors write from perspectives which are not Kierkegaard's own, some of the philosophy mentioned in this article may not reflect Kierkegaard's own beliefs. Just as other philosophers bring up viewpoints in their essays to discuss and criticize them, Kierkegaard assigns pseudonyms to explore a particular viewpoint in-depth, which may take up a whole book or two in some instances, and Kierkegaard, or another pseudonym, critiques that position. For example, the author, Johannes Climacus is not a Christian and he argues from a non-Christian viewpoint. Anti-Climacus, as mentioned earlier, is a Christian to a high degree and he argues from a devout Christian viewpoint. Kierkegaard places his beliefs in-between these two authors. Most of Kierkegaard's later philosophical and religious writings from 1846 to 1855 were written and authored by himself, and he assigned no pseudonyms to these works. Subsequently, these works are considered by most scholars to reflect Kierkegaard's own beliefs.Watts, Michael. Kierkegaard. Oneworld, 2003, Where appropriate, this article will mention the respective author, pseudonymous or not. Themes in his philosophy=Alienation= Alienation is a term philosophers apply to a wide variety of phenomena, including any feeling of separation from, and discontent with, society; feeling that there is a moral breakdown in society; feelings of powerlessness in the face of the solidity of social institutions; the impersonal, dehumanised nature of large-scale and bureaucratic social organisations. Kierkegaard recognizes and accepts the notion of alienation, although he phrases it and understands it in his own distinctly original terms. For Kierkegaard, the present age is a reflective age‚Äîone that values objectivity and thought over action, lip-service to ideals rather than action, discussion over action, publicity and advertising over reality, and fantasy over the real world. For Kierkegaard, the meaning of values has been removed from life, by lack of finding any true and legitimate authority. Instead of falling into any claimed authority, any \\"literal\\" sacred book or any other great and lasting voice, self-aware humans must confront an existential uncertainty. Humanity has lost meaning because the accepted criterion of reality and truth is ambiguous and subjective thought‚Äîthat which cannot be proven with logic, historical research, or scientific analysis. Humans cannot think out choices in life, we must live them; and even those choices that we often think about become different once life itself enters into the picture. For Kierkegaard, the type of objectivity that a scientist or historian might use misses the point‚Äîhumans are not motivated and do not find meaning in life through pure objectivity. Instead, they find it through passion, desire, and moral and religious commitment. These phenomena are not objectively provable‚Äînor do they come about through any form of analysis of the external world; they come about through a direct relationship between one and the external world. Here Kierkegaard's emphasis is on relationship rather than analysis. This relationship is a way of looking at one's life that evades objective scrutiny. Kierkegaard's analysis of the present age uses terms that resemble but are not exactly coincident with Hegel and Marx's theory of alienation. However Kierkegaard expressly means that human beings are alienated from God because they are living too much in the world. Individuals need to gain their souls from the world because it actually belongs to God. Kierkegaard has no interest in external battles as Karl Marx does. His concern is about the inner fight for faith. Albert Camus wrote about the idea of being a stranger in the world but reversed Kierkegaard's meaning. A stranger for Camus was someone living in the world who is forced to exist in a Christian way even though the individual does not want to be a Christian. But Kierkegaard was discussing the Christian who wants to be a Christian living in a world that has abandoned Christianity. Both Camus and Kierkegaard had in common an equal distaste for a Christian Democracy where all are forced to take a positive part in Christianity because freedom of choice would be lacking and in a non-Christian Democracy where none are allowed to take an active part in Christianity. Kierkegaard was against voting about Christianity, for him, Christ was the only authority. Camus called \\"the existential attitude philosophical suicide.\\" This is how he put it in The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Writings: Kierkegaard put it this way in Three Edifying Discourses 1843 and Concluding Unscientific Postscript (1846): =Abstraction= An element of Kierkegaard's critique of modernity in his socio-political work, Two Ages, is the mention of money‚Äîwhich he calls an abstraction.Kierkegaard, S√∏ren. The Two Ages, trans. Howard and Edna Hong. Princeton University Press, Perkins, Robert L. Two Ages: International Kierkegaard Commentary. Mercer University Press, An abstraction is something that only has a reality in an ersatz reality. It is not tangible, and only has meaning within an artificial context, which ultimately serves devious and deceptive purposes. It is a figment of thought that has no concrete reality, neither now nor in the future. How is money an abstraction? Money gives the illusion that it has a direct relationship to the work that is done. That is, the work one does is worth so much, equals so much money. In reality, however, the work one does is an expression of who one is as a person; it expresses one's goals in life and associated meaning. As a person, the work one performs is supposed to be an external realization of one's relationship to others and to the world. It is one's way of making the world a better place for oneself and for others. What reducing work to a monetary value does is to replace the concrete reality of one's everyday struggles with the world ‚Äîto give it shape, form and meaning‚Äî with an abstraction. Kierkegaard lamented that \\"a young man today would scarcely envy another his capacities or skill or the love of a beautiful girl or his fame, no, but he would envy him his money. Give me money, the young man will say, and I will be all right.\\"Two Ages, p.75, Hong translation. But Kierkegaard thinks this emphasis on money leads to a denial of the gifts of the spirit to those who are poor and in misery. Below are three quotes concerning Kierkegaard's idea of abstraction which cannot be thought about without thinking about concretion. He moves from the world historical, the general, to the single individual, the specific. The first from the esthete and the second from the ethicist in Either/Or and the third from the book that explained all his previous works; Concluding Unscientific Postscript. =Death= Death is inevitable and temporally unpredictable. Kierkegaard believed that individuals needed to sincerely and intensely come to realize the truth of that fact in order to live passionately. Kierkegaard accuses society of being in death-denial. Even though people see death all around them and grasp as an objective fact that everyone dies, few people truly understand, subjectively and inwardly, that they will die someday. For example, in Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Kierkegaard notes that people never think to say, \\"I shall certainly attend your party, but I must make an exception for the contingency that a roof tile happens to blow down and kill me; for in that case, I cannot attend.\\"Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Hong 1992 p. 88. This is jest as far as Kierkegaard is concerned. But there is also earnestness involved in the thought of death. Kierkegaard said the following about death in his Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1844: =Dread or anxiety= For Kierkegaard's author, Vigilius Haufniensis, anxiety/dread/angst (depending on the translation and context) is unfocused fear. Haufniensis uses the example of a man standing on the edge of a tall building or cliff. From this height he can see all the possibilities of life. He's reflecting on what he could become if he only threw himself into the power of his own choice. As long as he stands there he stands at the crossroads of life, unable to make a decision and live within its boundaries. The mere fact that one has the possibility and freedom to do something, even the most terrifying of possibilities, triggers immense feelings of dread. Haufniensis called this our \\"dizziness of freedom.\\" In The Concept of Anxiety, Haufniensis focuses on the first anxiety experienced by man: Adam's choice to eat from God's forbidden tree of knowledge or not. Since the concepts of good and evil did not come into existence before Adam ate the fruit, which is now dubbed original sin, Adam had no concept of good and evil, and did not know that eating from the tree was evil. What he did know was that God told him not to eat from the tree. The anxiety comes from the fact that God's prohibition itself implies that Adam is free and that he could choose to obey God or not. After Adam ate from the tree, sin was born. So, according to Kierkegaard, anxiety precedes sin, and it is anxiety that leads Adam to sin. Haufniensis mentions that anxiety is the presupposition for hereditary sin. However, Haufniensis mentions that anxiety is a way for humanity to be saved as well. Anxiety informs us of our choices, our self-awareness and personal responsibility, and brings us from a state of un-self-conscious immediacy to self-conscious reflection. (Jean-Paul Sartre calls these terms pre-reflexive consciousness and reflexive consciousness.) An individual becomes truly aware of his or her potential through the experience of dread. So, anxiety may be a possibility for sin, but anxiety can also be a recognition or realization of one's true identity and freedoms. =Despair= Most emphatically in The Sickness Unto Death, Kierkegaard's author argues that the human self is a composition of various aspects that must be brought into conscious balance: the finite, the infinite, a consciousness of the \\"relationship of the two to itself,\\" and a consciousness of \\"the power that posited\\" the self. The finite (limitations such as those imposed by one's body or one's concrete circumstances) and the infinite (those capacities that free us from limitations such as imagination) always exist in a state of tension. That tension between two aspects of the \\"self\\" that must be brought into balance. When the self is out of balance, i.e., has the wrong understanding of who it is because it conceives itself too much in terms of its own limiting circumstances (and thus fails to recognize its own freedom to determine what it will be) or too much in terms of what it would like to be, (thus ignoring its own circumstances), the person is in a state of despair. Notably, Anti-Climacus says one can be in despair even if one feels perfectly happy. Despair is not just an emotion, in a deeper sense it is the loss of self, i.e., it describes the state when one has the wrong conception of oneself. In Either/Or, A and Judge William each has one epistolary novel in two volumes. The A is an aesthete well aware that he can use the power of interpretation to define who he is and what he takes to be valuable. He knows he can shape and reshape his own self-identity. Nothing binds him to his relationships. Nothing binds him to his past actions. In the end though, he also knows he lacks a consistent understanding of who he is. He lacks a self that resists his own power of reinterpretation. His older friend Judge William, argues that a deeper concept of selfhood is discovered as one commits to one's actions, and takes ownership of the past and present. A concept of oneself, as this particular human being, begins to take form in one's own consciousness. Another perspective, one in which an individual can find some measure of freedom from despair, is available for the person with religious \\"faith.\\" This attunes the individual so that he or she can recognize what has always been there: a self to be realized within the circumstances it finds itself right now, i.e., this inner attunement brings about a sort of synthesis between the infinite and the finite. In Fear and Trembling, Johannes de Silentio argues that the choice of Abraham to obey the private, unethical, commandment of God to sacrifice his son reveals what faith entails: he directs his consciousness absolutely toward \\"the absolute\\" rather than the merely ethical, i.e., he practices an inner spirituality that seeks to be \\"before god\\" rather than seeking to understand himself as an ethically upright person. His God requires more than being good, he demands that he seek out an inner commitment to him. If Abraham were to blithely obey, his actions would have no meaning. It is only when he acts with fear and trembling that he demonstrates a full awareness that murdering a son is absolutely wrong, ethically speaking. Despair has several specific levels that a person can find themselves, each one further in despair than the last as laid out in The Sickness Unto Death. The first level is \\"The despair that is ignorant of being despair or the despairing ignorance of having a self and an eternal self.\\" Essentially this level is one which has the wrong conception of what a self is, i.e., is ignorant of how to realize the self one already potentially is. In this sense, the person does not recognize his own despair because he often measures the success of his life based on whether he himself judges himself to be happy. Regardless of whether you know you are in despair or not, Kierkegaard asserts, you can still be in that state. He notes that this is the most common in the world. The next level of despair is \\"The despair that is conscious of being despair and therefore is conscious of having a self in which there is something eternal and then either in despair does not will to be itself or in despair wills to be itself.\\" This becomes further subdivided into three categories: the despair not to will or want to be oneself, the despair not to will to be a self, and lowest, the despair to wish for a new self. These three divisions are mostly the self-worth the person has and the amount to which they understand their own despair. The despair to not be oneself is pretty straightforward. A person sees themself as unworthy and as such does not see themself as worthy before something they do not understand. The despair not to be a self is deeper, because to not wish to be a self is to wish to not have a relation to God or at the very least see one's relation to God as unworthy, and thus shrink from it. The lowest form of this group, however, is the desire to be a new self. This is logically the deepest form as it assumes the deepest understanding of one's despair. Once in despair, without a complete relation to God one will always be in despair, so to be in this level one understands the permanence of the despair. The despair in this group arises from the nature of sensate things and physical desires. These three sub groups are also grouped under the heading \\"Despair over the earthly.\\" The second level of conscious despair under the heading \\"Despair over the eternal.\\" Someone in this level views themself in light of their own weakness. Unlike in the upper level, this weakness is understood and as such, instead of turning to faith and humbling oneself before God, they despair in their own weakness and unworthiness. In this sense, they despair over the eternal and refuse to be comforted by the light of God. The last and lowest form of despair is the desire \\"In despair to will to be oneself.\\" This last form of despair is also referred to by Kierkegaard as \\"demonic despair\\" (Note that the term demonic is used in the Classical Greek Sense, not the modern sense). In this form of despair, the individual finds him or herself in despair, understands they are in despair, seeks some way to alleviate it, and yet no help is forthcoming. As a result, the self becomes hardened against any form of help and \\"Even if God in heaven and all the angels offered him aid, he would not want it.\\" At this level of despair the individual revels in their own despair and sees their own pain as lifting them up above the base nature of other humans who do not find themselves in this state. This is the least common form of despair and Kierkegaard claims it is mostly found in true poets. This despair can also be called the despair of defiance, as it is the despair that strikes out against all that is eternal. One last note is that as one travels further down the forms of despair, the number of people in each group becomes fewer. =Ethics= In Fear and Trembling, Johannes de Silentio analyzes Abraham's action to sacrifice Isaac. Silentio argues that Abraham is a knight of faith. Many philosophers who initially read Kierkegaard, especially Kierkegaard's (written under the pseudonym of Johannes de Silentio) Fear and Trembling, often come to the conclusion that Kierkegaard supports a divine command law of ethics. The divine command theory is a metaethical theory which claims moral values are whatever is commanded by a god or gods. However, Kierkegaard is not arguing that morality is created by God; instead, he would argue that a divine command from God transcends ethics. This distinction means that God does not necessarily create human morality: it is up to us as individuals to create our own morals and values. But any religious person must be prepared for the event of a divine command from God that would take precedence over all moral and rational obligations. Kierkegaard called this event the teleological suspension of the ethical. Abraham, the knight of faith, chose to obey God unconditionally, and was rewarded with his son, his faith, and the title of Father of Faith. Abraham transcended ethics and leaped into faith. But there is no valid logical argument one can make to claim that morality ought to be or can be suspended in any given circumstance, or ever. Thus, Silentio believes ethics and faith are separate stages of consciousness. The choice to obey God unconditionally is a true existential 'either/or' decision faced by the individual. Either one chooses to live in faith (the religious stage) or to live ethically (the ethical stage). In Either/Or, Kierkegaard insists that the single individual has ethical responsibility of his life. However, everyone wants to enjoy themselves and ethics gets in the way of a person's enjoyment of life if taken to extremes. This results in a battle between those who want to live for pleasure and those who demand an ethical existence. But Kierkegaard always points toward the religious goal, an \\"eternal happiness\\", or the salvation of the soul as the highest good. He says, be whatever you want, but remember that your soul belongs to God, not to the world. In Works of Love and Purity of Heart, Kierkegaard skillfully examines Christian ethics and the maxim, Love Thy Neighbour.Here are some verses from the Bible about loving your neighbor Love thy neighbor Kierkegaard stressed that it was Christianity that \\"discovered the neighbor\\".Works of Love, Hong p. 44 =Individuality= For Kierkegaard, true individuality is called selfhood. Becoming aware of our true self is our true task and endeavor in life‚Äîit is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist at a level that is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures‚Äîour immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or: In Sickness Unto Death specifically Kierkegaard deals with the self as a product of relations. In this sense, a human results from a relation between the Infinite (Noumena, spirit, eternal) and Finite (Phenomena, body, temporal). This does not create a true self, as a human can live without a \\"self\\" as he defines it. Instead, the Self or ability for the self to be created from a relation to the Absolute or God (the Self can only be realized through a relation to God) arises as a relation between the relation of the Finite and Infinite relating back to the human. This would be a positive relation. An individual person, for Kierkegaard, is a particular that no abstract formula or definition can ever capture. Including the individual in \\"the public\\" (or \\"the crowd\\" or \\"the herd\\") or subsuming a human being as simply a member of a species is a reduction of the true meaning of life for individuals. What philosophy or politics try to do is to categorize and pigeonhole individuals by group characteristics, each with their own individual differences. In Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 Kierkegaard says the differences aren't important, the likeness with God is what brings equality. Kierkegaard's critique of the modern age, therefore, is about the loss of what it means to be an individual. Modern society contributes to this dissolution of what it means to be an individual. Through its production of the false idol of \\"the public\\", it diverts attention away from individuals to a mass public that loses itself in abstractions, communal dreams, and fantasies. It is helped in this task by the media and the mass production of products to keep it distracted. Even the fight for temporal equality is a distraction. In Works of Love he writes: Although Kierkegaard attacked \\"the public\\", he is supportive of communities: =Pathos (passion)= For Kierkegaard, in order to apprehend the absolute, the mind must radically empty itself of objective content. What supports this radical emptying, however, is the desire for the absolute. Kierkegaard names this desire Passion.Kangas In line with this philosophy, some scholars have drawn similarities between the Stoics concept of Apatheia and Subjective Truth as the highest form of Wisdom. For the Stoics, Pathos (Passion) is a Perturbation which man has to overcome in a similar manner to Kierkegaard's concept of Objective Truth., Kierkegaard and the Greek World: Aristotle and other Greek authors. According to Kierkegaard, the human self desires that which is beyond reason. Desire itself appears to be a desire for the infinite, as Plato once wrote. Even the desire to propagate, according to Plato, is a kind of desire for immortality‚Äîthat is, we wish to live on in time through our children and their children. Erotic love itself appears as an example of this desire for something beyond the purely finite. It is a taste of what could be, if only it could continue beyond the boundaries of time and space. As the analogy implies, humans seek something beyond the here and now. The question remains, however, why is it that human pathos or passion is the most precious thing? In some ways, it might have to do with our status as existential beings. It is not thought that gets us through life‚Äîit is action; and what motivates and sustains action is passion, the desire to overcome hardships, pain, and suffering. It is also passion that enables us to die for ideals in the name of a higher reality. While a scientist might see this as plain emotion or simple animal desire, Kierkegaard sees it as that which binds to the source of life itself. For Kierkegaard all Christian action should have its ground in love, which is a passion. One can also look at this from the perspective of what the meaning of our existence is. Why suffer what humans have suffered, the pain and despair‚Äîwhat meaning can all of this have? For Kierkegaard, there is no meaning unless passion, the emotions and will of humans, has a divine source. Passion is closely aligned with faith in Kierkegaard's thought. Faith as a passion is what drives humans to seek reality and truth in a transcendent world, even though everything we can know intellectually speaks against it. To live and die for a belief, to stake everything one has and is in the belief in something that has a higher meaning than anything in the world‚Äîthis is belief and passion at their highest. Kierkegaard wrote of the subjective thinker's task in his Concluding Unscientific Postscript. Intellectual reason had been deified by Hegel in his theology and Kierkegaard felt this would lead to the objectification of religion. =Subjectivity= Johannes Climacus, in Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, writes the following cryptic line: \\"Subjectivity is Truth\\". To understand Climacus's concept of the individual, it is important to look at what he says regarding subjectivity. What is subjectivity? In very rough terms, subjectivity refers to what is personal to the individual‚Äîwhat makes the individual who he is in distinction from others. Another way to interpret subjectivity is the unique relationship between the subject and object. Johann Fichte wrote similarly about subjectivity in his 1799 book The Vocation of Man: Scientists and historians, for example, study the objective world, hoping to elicit the truth of nature‚Äîor perhaps the truth of history. In this way, they hope to predict how the future will unfold in accordance with these laws. In terms of history, by studying the past, the individual can perhaps elicit the laws that determine how events will unfold‚Äîin this way the individual can predict the future with more exactness and perhaps take control of events that in the past appeared to fall outside the control of humans. In most respects, Climacus did not have problems with science or the scientific endeavor. He would not disregard the importance of objective knowledge. Where the scientist or historian finds certainty, however, Climacus noted very accurately that results in science change as the tools of observation change. But Climacus's special interest was in history. His most vehement attacks came against those who believed that they had understood history and its laws‚Äîand by doing so could ascertain what a human's true self is. That is, the assumption is that by studying history someone can come to know who he really is as a person. Kierkegaard especially accused Hegel's philosophy of falling prey to this assumption. He explained this in Concluding Unscientific Postscript: Hegel wanted to philosophize about Christianity but had no intention to ever become a Christian. For Climacus, the individual comes to know who he is by an intensely personal and passionate pursuit of what will give meaning to his life. As an existing individual, who must come to terms with everyday life, overcome its obstacles and setbacks, who must live and die, the single individual has a life that no one else will ever live. In dealing with what life brings his way, the individual must encounter them with all his psycho- physical resources. Subjectivity is that which the individual‚Äîand no one else‚Äîhas. But what does it mean to have something like this? It cannot be understood in the same way as having a car or a bank account. It means to be someone who is becoming someone‚Äîit means being a person with a past, a present, and a future. No one can have an individual's past, present or future. Different people experience these in various ways‚Äîthese experiences are unique, not anyone else's. Having a past, present, and future means that a person is an existing individual‚Äîthat a person can find meaning in time and by existing. Individuals do not think themselves into existence, they are born. But once born and past a certain age, the individual begins to make choices in life; now those choices can be his, his parents', society's, etc. The important point is that to exist, the individual must make choices‚Äîthe individual must decide what to do the next moment and on into the future. What the individual chooses and how he chooses will define who and what he is‚Äîto himself and to others. Kierkegaard put it this way in Works of Love, 1847: The goal of life, according to Socrates, is to know thyself. Knowing oneself means being aware of who one is, what one can be and what one cannot be. Kierkegaard uses the same idea that Socrates used in his own writings. He asks the one who wants to be a single individual the following questions in his 1847 book, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits: Subjectivity comes with consciousness of myself as a self. It encompasses the emotional and intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is to decide how to choose‚Äîwhat rules or models is the individual going to use to make the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests‚Äîthe individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being. Kierkegaard decided to step up to the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil for himself, replacing Adam, and make his choice in the presence of God, where no one was there to accuse or judge him but his Creator. This is what he had Abraham do in Fear and Trembling. This is how Kierkegaard thought learning about oneself takes place. Here is where the single individual learns about guilt and innocence. His book, The Concept of Anxiety, makes clear that Adam did have knowledge when he made his choice and that was the knowledge of freedom. The prohibition was there but so was freedom and Eve and Adam decided to use it. In Kierkegaard's meaning, purely theological assertions are subjective truths and they cannot be either verified or invalidated by science, i.e. through objective knowledge.Robert C. Solomon, No Excuses: Existentialism and the Meaning of Life, The Great Courses, The Teaching Company, http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=437 For him, choosing if one is for or against a certain subjective truth is a purely arbitrary choice. He calls the jump from objective knowledge to religious faith a leap of faith, since it means subjectively accepting statements which cannot be rationally justified. For him the Christian faith is the result of the trajectory initiated by such choices, which don't have and cannot have a rational ground (meaning that reason is neither for or against making such choices). Objectively regarded, purely theological assertions are neither true nor false. =Three stages of life= Early American Kierkegaard scholars tried to reduce the complexity of Kierkegaard's authorship by focusing on three levels of individual existence, which are named in passing by one of Kierkegaard's pseudonyms, Johannes Climacus, who wrote Concluding Unscientific Postscript. Though the stages represent only one way of interpreting Kierkegaard's thought, it has become a popular way of introducing his authorship. In continental European circles, stage theory never took hold in the same way. This typifies what Kierkegaard was talking about throughout his writing career. \\"Early American scholars\\" and \\"European circles\\" denote partitions of thought concerning the writings of his works. He was against \\"reflecting oneself out of reality\\" and partitioning the \\"world of the spirit\\" because the world of the spirit cannot be objectively divided. Hegel wrote about his stages in his book, Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion and Kierkegaard replied in his Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments 1846: In one popular interpretation of stage theory, each of the so-called levels of existence envelops those below it: an ethical person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment, for example, and a religious person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment and ethical duty. The difference between these ways of living are internal, not external, and thus there are no external signs one can point to determine at what level a person is living. This inner and outer relationship is commonly determined by an individual by looking to others to gauge one's action, Kierkegaard believed one should look to oneself and in that relationship look to Christ as the example instead of looking at others because the more you look at others the less you see of yourself. This makes it easier to degrade your neighbor instead of loving your neighbor. But one must love the person one sees not the person one wishes to see. Either love the person you see as that person is the person he is or stop talking about loving everyone.See Works of Love and Practice in Christianity Stage one: aesthetic Kierkegaard was interested in aesthetics, and is sometimes referred to as the \\"poet-philosopher\\" because of the passionate way in which he approached philosophy. But he is often said to be interested in showing the inadequacy of a life lived entirely in the aesthetic level. Aesthetic life is defined in numerous different ways in Kierkegaard's authorship, including a life defined by intellectual enjoyment, sensuous desire, and an inclination to interpret oneself as if one were \\"on stage.\\" There are many degrees of this aesthetic existence and a single definition is thus difficult to offer. At bottom, one might see the purely unreflective lifestyle. At the top, we might find those lives which are lived in a reflective, independent, critical and socially apathetic way. But many interpreters of Kierkegaard believe that most people live in the least reflective sort of aesthetic stage, their lives and activities guided by everyday tasks and concerns. Fewer aesthetically guided people are the reflective sort. Whether such people know it or not, their lives will inevitably lead to complete despair. Kierkegaard's author A is an example of an individual living the aesthetic life. Stage two: ethical The second level of existence is the ethical. This is where an individual begins to take on a true direction in life, becoming aware of and personally responsible for good and evil and forming a commitment to oneself and others. One's actions at this level of existence have a consistency and coherence that they lacked in the previous sphere of existence. For many readers of Kierkegaard, the ethical is central. It calls each individual to take account of their lives and to scrutinize their actions in terms of absolute responsibility, which is what Kierkegaard calls repentance. If we compare Kierkegaard's idea of ethics with Vedic system of four aims of life, this Ethical system probably correlates most with Dharma‚Äîfollowing this or that religion, set of rules, laws etc. (Hindus would call any religion as \\"dharma\\", though dharma is also a law). \\"Judge Wilhelm,\\" a pseudonymous author of Either/Or and the voice who defines the ethical consciousness, argues that the commitment to take responsibility for one's own choices must be made individually. To take responsibility for the various relationships in which an individual finds him- or herself is a possibility open to every human being, but it does not follow that every human being chooses to do so as a matter of course. The meaning of a person's life for Wilhelm depends on how he takes responsibility for his current and future choices, and how he takes ownership of those choices already made. For Wilhelm, the ethically governed person takes responsibility for past actions, some good and some bad, seeks consistency, and takes seriously the obligation to live in a passionate and devoted way. Stage three: religious The ethical and the religious are intimately connected: a person can be ethically serious without being religious, but the religious stage includes the ethical. Whereas living in the ethical sphere involves a commitment to some moral absolute, living in the religious sphere involves a commitment and relation to the Christian God. Kierkegaard explained this in Concluding Unscientific Postscript like this: The Kierkegaardian pseudonyms who speak of stage theory consider religion to be the highest stage in human existence. In one discussion of religious life, one of Kierkegaard's pseudonyms, Johannes Climacus, distinguishes two types within this stage, which have been called Religiousness A and Religiousness B.See Concluding Unscientific Postscript p. 555ff One type is symbolized by the Greek philosopher Socrates, whose passionate pursuit of the truth and individual conscience came into conflict with his society. Another type of religiousness is one characterized by the realization that the individual is sinful and is the source of untruth. In time, through revelation and in direct relationship with the paradox that is Jesus, the individual begins to see that his or her eternal salvation rests on a paradox‚ÄîGod, the transcendent, coming into time in human form to redeem human beings. For Kierkegaard, the very notion of this occurring was scandalous to human reason‚Äîindeed, it must be, and if it is not then one does not truly understand the Incarnation nor the meaning of human sinfulness. For Kierkegaard, the impulse towards an awareness of a transcendent power in the universe is what religion is. Religion has a social and an individual (not just personal) dimension. But it begins with the individual and his or her awareness of sinfulness. Here are several quotes from Kierkegaard's where he discusses his concept of sin. Kierkegaard's thoughts on other philosophers=Kierkegaard and Fichte= Fichte Kierkegaard wrote much about Johann Gottlieb Fichte in his thesis The Concept of IronySee The Concept of Irony, p. 272ff as well as in his first book De omnibus dubitandum est, written under the pseudonym Johannes Climacus, and his Journals. Fichte wrote the book The Vocation of Man (1800) which called for a progression in the life of the human being from doubt to knowledge and then to faith. De omnibus dubitandum est is from Descartes and means everything must be doubted. Both Kierkegaard and Fichte were interested in this idea of beginning with doubt as well as subjectivity. Kierkegaard wrote: \\"In Fichte, subjectivity became free, infinite, negative. But in order for subjectivity to get out of this movement of emptiness in which it moved in infinite abstraction, it had to be negated; in order for thought to become actual, it had to become concrete.\\"Soren Kierkegaard, The Concept of Irony, Hong p. 275 =Kierkegaard and Hegel= Hegel Many philosophers think that one of Kierkegaard's greatest contributions to philosophy is his critique of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Indeed, many of Kierkegaard's works are written in response to or as a critique of Hegel. Although Kierkegaard strongly criticized some aspects of Hegelian philosophy, his work also shows that he was also positively influenced by Hegel, and had respect for Hegel himself. In a journal entry made in 1844, Kierkegaard wrote: While Kierkegaard was a student of theology at the University of Copenhagen, Hegelianism had become increasingly popular. Johan Ludvig Heiberg and Hans Lassen Martensen were key figures in Danish Hegelianism. Kierkegaard remarked in his journal on 17 May 1843 that Heiberg's writings were \\"borrowed\\" from Hegel, implying Heiberg would have been a nobody without Hegel. Kierkegaard objected to Hegel's claim that he had devised a system of thought that could explain the whole of reality, with a dialectical analysis of history leading the way to this whole. Hegel claimed that the doctrines and history of Christianity could be explained as a part of the rational unfolding and development of our understanding of the natural world and our place within it. Kierkegaard considered Hegel's explanation of Christianity as a necessary part of world history to be a distortion of the Christian message and a misunderstanding of the limits of human reason. He attempted to refute this aspect of Hegel's thought by suggesting that many doctrines of Christianity‚Äîincluding the doctrine of Incarnation, a God who is also human‚Äîcannot be explained rationally but remain a logical paradox. However, he was in favor of youthful striving after truth. To refute Hegel's claim that Christianity should be understood as a part of the necessary evolution of thought, or in Hegelians terms, Spirit, in Fear and Trembling, Kierkegaard attempts to use the story of Abraham to show that there is a goal higher than that of ethics (questioning the Hegelian claim that doing one's ethical duty is the highest that can be said of a human being) and that faith cannot be explained by Hegelian ethics, (disproving Hegel's claim that Christianity can be rationally explained by philosophy). Either way, this work can be read as a challenge to the Hegelian notion that a human being's ultimate purpose is to fulfill ethical demands. By doing this, Hegelian critics accuse Kierkegaard of using the dialectic to disprove the dialectic, which seems somewhat contradictory and hypocritical. However, Kierkegaard would not claim the dialectic itself is bad, only the Hegelian premise that the dialectic would lead to a harmonious reconciliation of everything, which Hegel called the Absolute. Kierkegaard stated this most clearly in his book The Concept of Anxiety: Kierkegaardian scholars have made several interpretations of how Kierkegaard proceeds with parodying Hegel's dialectic. One of the more popular interpretations argues the aesthetic- ethical-religious stages are the triadic process Kierkegaard was talking about. See section Spheres of existence for more information. Another interpretation argues for the world-individual-will triadic process. The dialectic here is either to assert an individual's own desire to be independent and the desire to be part of a community. Instead of reconciliation of the world and the individual where problems between the individual and society are neatly resolved in the Hegelian system, Kierkegaard argues that there's a delicate bond holding the interaction between them together, which needs to be constantly reaffirmed. Jean-Paul Sartre takes this latter view and says the individual is in a constant state of reaffirming his or her own identity, else one falls into bad faith. This process of reconciliation leads to a \\"both/and\\" view of life, where both thesis and antithesis are resolved into a synthesis, which negates the importance of personal responsibility and the human choice of either/or. The work Either/Or is a response to this aspect of Hegel's philosophy. A passage from that work exemplifies Kierkegaard's contempt for Hegel's philosophy. Note the comparison between \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" (Judge Vilhelm) in Either/Or and Stages on Life's Way. Here are two more from 1846: The whole idea of one generation spending all its time studying past generations and then the next generation spending their time studying past generations and making moral and social comments about preceding generations was called, \\"The Hegelian cud-chewing process with three-stomachs‚Äîfirst immediacy‚Äîthen regurgitation‚Äîthen down again.\\" He said, \\"Maybe a succeeding master-mind could continue this with four stomachs, etc., down once more and up again. I don't know if the master-mind grasps what I mean.\\"Journals and Papers 25 August 1936 1A229 =Kierkegaard and Schelling= Schelling In 1841‚Äì1842, Kierkegaard attended the Berlin lectures of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling. Schelling was a critic of Georg Hegel and a professor at the University of Berlin. The university started a lecture series given by Schelling in order to espouse a type of positive philosophy which would be diametrically opposed to Hegelianism. Kierkegaard was initially delighted with Schelling. Before he left Copenhagen to attend Schelling's lectures in Berlin, he wrote to his friend Peter Johannes Sprang: At Berlin, Kierkegaard gave high praises to Schelling. In a journal entry made sometime around October or November 1841, Kierkegaard wrote this piece about Schelling's second lecture: As time went on, however, Kierkegaard, as well as many in Schelling's audience, began to become disillusioned with Schelling. In a particularly insulting letter about Schelling, Kierkegaard wrote to his brother, Peter Kierkegaard: Kierkegaard became disillusioned with Schelling partly because Schelling shifted his focus on actuality, including a discussion on quid sit [what is] and quod sit [that is], to a more mythological, psychic-type pseudo-philosophy. Kierkegaard's last writing about Schelling's lectures was on 4 February 1842. He wrote the following in 1844: Although Schelling had little influence on Kierkegaard's subsequent writings, Kierkegaard's trip to Berlin provided him ample time to work on his masterpiece, Either/Or. In a reflection about Schelling in 1849, Kierkegaard remarked that Schelling was \\"like the Rhine at its mouth where it became stagnant water‚Äîhe was degenerating into a Prussian 'Excellency'.\\" (Journals, January 1849) =Kierkegaard and Schopenhauer= Arthur Schopenhauer Kierkegaard became acquainted with Arthur Schopenhauer's writings quite late in his life. Kierkegaard felt Schopenhauer was an important writer, but disagreed on almost every point Schopenhauer made. In several journal entries made in 1854, a year before he died, Kierkegaard spoke highly of Schopenhauer: However, Kierkegaard also considered him, a most dangerous sign of things to come: Kierkegaard believes Schopenhauer's ethical point of view is that the individual succeeds in seeing through the wretchedness of existence and then decides to deaden or mortify the joy of life. As a result of this complete asceticism, one reaches contemplation: the individual does this out of sympathy. He sympathizes with all the misery and the misery of others, which is to exist. Kierkegaard here is probably referring to the pessimistic nature of Schopenhauer's philosophy. One of Kierkegaard's main concerns is a suspicion of his whole philosophy: Little else is known about Kierkegaard's attitude to Schopenhauer. On Schopenhauer himself, Kierkegaard felt that Schopenhauer would have been patronizing. \\"Schopenhauer interests me very much, as does his fate in Germany. If I could talk to him I am sure he would shudder or laugh if I were to show him [my philosophy].\\" (Journals, 1854) Kierkegaard and Eastern philosophy Because Kierkegaard read Schopenhauer, and because Schopenhauer was heavily influenced by Eastern philosophy, it would seem that Kierkegaard would have shown an awareness of Eastern philosophy. There is, however, little direct reference to Asian thought in Kierkegaard's writings. Anyone who is familiar with such Asian traditions as Buddhist, Taoist, or Shinto philosophy, will quickly see the philosophical similarities that Kierkegaard shares with these traditions. These similarities perhaps explain the Japanese reception of Kierkegaard and the fact that Japanese awareness and translations of Kierkegaard were appearing at least 30 years before any English translations.Masugata, Kinya, \\"A Short History of Kierkegaard's Reception in Japan\\", in J. Giles (ed.) Kierkegaard and Japanese Thought, Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp. 31‚Äì52 There is also extensive Japanese scholarship on Kierkegaard, a scholarship that interprets Kierkegaard's philosophy in terms of Asian thought.Mortensen, Finn Hauberg, Kierkegaard Made in Japan, University Press of Southern Denmark, 1996 This interpretation is understandable when one sees that Kierkegaard's central concerns of subjectivity, anxiety, freedom, despair, and self-deception, are also of central concern to Buddhism and, consequently, that there is nothing exclusively Christian about such concerns.Giles, James \\"Introduction: Kierkegaard's among the Temples of Kamakura\\", in J. Giles (ed.) Kierkegaard and Japanese Thought, Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp. 1‚Äì30 Both Kierkegaard and Zen Buddhism, for example, have seen the predicaments of existence in very similar ways.Jacobson, Nolan Pliny, \\"The Predicament of Man in Zen Buddhism and Kierkegaard\\", Philosophy East and West 2, 1952, 238‚Äì253 A specific example of the similarities here can be seen in Purity of Heart where Kierkegaard describes the state of awareness that one must enter in order to partake of confession. Kierkegaard's description of this state is similar to the state of meditation described by Buddhist philosophers.Giles, James, \\"To Practice One Thing: Kierkegaard through the Eyes of Dogen\\", in J. Giles (ed.) Kierkegaard and Japanese Thought, Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp. 87‚Äì105 It is distinct, however, in that the aim of confession, for Kierkegaard, is \\"to center itself upon this relation to itself as an individual who is responsible to God\\" (cf. Kierkegaard, \\"Purity of Heart\\"). Kierkegaard aims to claim back the subject from the \\"crowd\\" mentality of Christendom (cf. Kierkegaard, \\"On the Dedication to 'That Single Individual' \\")http://www.ccel.org/k/kierkegaard/untruth/untruth.htm and reaffirm the absolute responsibility to God, which is our telos (cf. Kierkegaard, \\"Fear and Trembling\\").S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Fear and Trembling, ed. and trans. Howard and Edna Hong, (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983), 81. Harald Hoffding (1843‚Äì1931) helped introduce Kierkegaard to Western Europe in the early years of the 20th century.

The Keep Sunday Special campaign was set up and is run as a conventional secular civil society organisation with support from trade unions, churches, political parties, private businesses, and members of all faiths and of none. It has no connection to the Lord's Day Observance Society. History In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, before 1994 only small shops were allowed to open on Sunday, with large stores forced to remain shut. There were many rules at the time, which resulted in perceived idiosyncrasies such as the legal ability to buy a pornographic magazine but not a Bible or birthday card on a Sunday. Strict observance of Sabbath was declining, and other religions either had different days of rest, or none. However, some Christians set up letter- writing campaigns. Trade unions and employers gave assurances that no worker would be forced to work on Sundays and surveys showed that even among Christians, many shopped on a Sunday so it was passed into law for a limited time. Under the Sunday Trading Act 1994, large shops are allowed to open for up to six hours on a Sunday between 10am and 6pm. The UK Department of Trade and Industry conducted a review of the Act in early 2006 to consider whether to extend opening hours to nine hours or to remove restrictions entirely. \\"Large\\" means having a retail area of or more. Keep Sunday Special believed that such moves would have a damaging effect on families, communities and local economies, as did organisations like the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (USDAW), which launched a Save our Sundays campaign, the Relationships Foundation, Working Families.Usdaw members launch campaign in Bridgwater against extending Sunday shopping hours , USDAW, 1 June 2006 An Early Day Motion was also signed by nearly 300 MPs. On 6 July 2006, the then Trade and Industry Secretary, Alistair Darling, confirmed that, having considered all the evidence from the review, the Government concluded there should be no change to the Sunday trading laws. The news was welcomed by trade unions and small shops who were afraid large stores would undercut their prices and were opposed to any change in the law.

He was 28 when he was murdered by three white supremacists in November 1988 in Portland, Oregon. They were convicted, and Mulugeta's father and sonwho was six years oldfiled (and won) a civil lawsuit against the killers and an affiliated organization, holding them liable for the murder. (Mulugeta did not have a surname; \\"Seraw\\" is a patronymic  the first name of his father). Background On the night of November 12, 1988, Kenneth Murray \\"Death\\" Mieske, Kyle Brewster, and Steve Strasser, members of groups known as East Side White Pride and White Aryan Resistance (WAR), were driving around Portland with their girlfriends, intending to return home. The three confronted two black men, including Mulugeta, who had been dropped off in front of his apartment. Mulugeta was beaten to death with a baseball bat on Southeast 31st Avenue. The three perpetrators and their girlfriends left him in a puddle of blood. He died the next day. Mieske said he, Brewster, and Strasser killed Mulugeta \\"because of his race.\\" In response, hundreds of people turned out for rallies against racism. Meanwhile, Tom Metzger, head of WAR, said the supremacists did a \\"civic duty\\" by killing the Ethiopian student. After one week of investigation, Mieske, Brewster, and Strasser were arrested. Brewster and Strasser were convicted of manslaughter and assault. Brewster was released in November 2002, but in 2006 violated parole and was sent back to prison.Herzog, Boaz, \\"Man in Infamous Hate-Crime Killing Arrested on Violation of Parole Terms\\", The Oregonian, May 20, 2006 In 1990, Mieske was convicted of first-degree murder and given a life sentence; he died on July 26, 2011 at the age of 45. At the time of his death, he was still being referred to as a \\"Prisoner of War\\" by white power groups. In October 1990, Mulugeta's father and son, represented at no cost by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, won a civil case against White Aryan Resistance's operator Tom Metzger and his son John Metzger for a total of $12.5 million.The jury divided the judgement against the defendants as follows: Kyle Brewster, $500,000; Ken Mieske, $500,000;, John Metzger, $1 million; WAR, $3 million; Tom Metzger, $5 million; in addition, the jury awarded $2.5 million for Mulugeta's unrealized future earnings and pain and suffering.

Villard Books, 1993. page 277 As Metzger was unable to cover the damages, the Seraws' lawyer decided to file legal documents in order to have his Fallbrook, California home and his assets seized. As a result, the house was transferred to Seraw's estate for a value of $121,500; Metzger was allowed to keep $45,000 under California's Homestead Act. Metzger was warned that any damage caused to the house would result in a lawsuit; nonetheless, he chose to leave the property \\"a mess\\" with cracked windows, but apparently did not cause any serious damage. The Metzgers declared bankruptcy, but WAR continued to operate. Metzger himself was forced to move into an apartment and collect welfare. As of 2007, he was still making payments to Seraw's family. Reaction to the murder In the same year, approximately 18 months after Mulugeta's death, 1,500 people attended a rally along the South Park Blocks. Among the participants were assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Brown, prosecuting deputy district attorney Norm Frink, Margaret Carter, Bud Clark, and several city commissioners, as well as at least five members of Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice. 150 police officers were on hand, as up to 300 skinheads were expected to oppose the rally; previously, the largest numbers of police officers needed for Portland events were for an Elvis Presley concert in 1957, in which 90 officers took part, and a Run-DMC concert in 1987. Bomb disposal squads, bomb-sniffing dogs, riot police, and a police helicopter were used, but the rally occurred without any major incident. Also in 1990, members of the Oregon chapter of the American Leadership Forum formed an experiential anti-discrimination youth camp in response to Seraw's death. Operating from 1990 to 2002, Camp Odyssey facilitated a week-long journey for teenagers in the Pacific Northwest, examining systems of oppression and fostering communication amongst a widely diverse group of participants. In early 2010, a small group of alumni formed a not-for-profit organization called The Piece, which achieved designation as an Oregon Solutions project, and oversaw the revival of Camp Odyssey which ran again from 2011 through 2015.https://orsolutions.org/osproject/camp-odyssey ReferencesFurther reading *Morris Dees.

The village of West End is small and generally classed as an area in the outer suburbs or rural urban fringe of the borough of Eastleigh because of the surrounding woodland and countryside, including Telegraph Woods and Itchen Valley Country Park. The village is mainly known for being home of the Rose Bowl, the stadium where Hampshire County Cricket Club plays, and occasionally England. Aside from a typical number of listed houses, main landmarks of the parish are Moorgreen Hospital  a large, ornate Victorian building, the original St James School, built in 1901, on the high street, and West End Fire Station  a museum in the centre of the village. History=Early history= A series of round barrows, dating from the Bronze Age (2000-600 BC), have been discovered in the Moorgreen area of the parish. There were five of these to the north of the former Moorgreen Hospital site. A hilltop fort from the Iron Age was built on the ridge above the village around 600-100BC. A shutter telegraph station operated from the site during the Napoleonic Wars, forming part of the line connecting London to Plymouth. It was this station that gave the name to the nearby Telegraph Woods. The village was originally a hamlet which grew up around a track between Romsey and Portsmouth. The hamlet had a chapel by 1552 primarily for the use of the lords of the manor of Allington. When the track became a turnpike road in the early 19th century, the hamlet began to grow. =19th century= The main building of Moorgreen Hospital, originally a workhouse In 1838, a national school was opened to house 192 children. The hamlet was within the parish of South Stoneham until the ecclesiastical parish of West End was established in 1840, two years after the construction of the original St James' Church. In 1846 a Bible Christian chapel was constructed in Chapel Road. A poor house had existed at the eastern end of the village for some time, and in 1848 this was replaced by a red-brick workhouse. This eventually became Moorgreen Hospital. An extra room was added to the national school in 1866. In 1871 an independent school for younger children was opened, having been built by Mrs Harriet Hazlefoot. In 1890, the spire of St James' was struck by lightning and the building was replaced. The civil parish was established in 1894. A number of boundary changes have taken place since then. Harriet Hazlefoot's school became the infants' department of the national school in 1894. =20th century= During the 20th century, the school moved again into a new (third) building and was renamed St James' Primary School. The second school building became Hilldene Community Centre, where a number of adult education courses and other activities take place. In 1900, two further Methodist chapels were built, one in the Moorgreen area and one in Swaythling Road. In September 1904 the children of the national school were moved to a new location with the old school building becoming the parish hall. The fire station was opened in May 1939 by Mrs Pearson of Oaklands in Allington Lane. The station was crewed by a mixture of National Fire Service and Auxiliary Fire Service personnel, and the station housed a Dennis New World fire engine. In 1954, Harefield was transferred out of the civil parish and into Southampton. During the 1970s, Maurice Robinson represented the ward on Hampshire County Council as a member of the Conservative Party. A Roman Catholic church building was opened in the village in 1961. Richard St. Barbe Baker did a lot of his career work in West End, where he made a Project costing ¬£180,000 to improve West End's High Street, by upgrading pavement slabs, plus adding safety rails, better lighting, removing all graffiti and damaged planters. The scheme also produced CCTV cameras managed by S & P Southampton Ltd. Near the end of the High Street, a plaque in his honour was made to thank all good things he has done for West End, plus a road named after him (Barbe Baker Avenue) was also created. The fire station was closed in 1996 and the building was transferred to the parish council to run as a community venue. West End Local History Society established at the same time set up its museum in the building. =21st century= Rose Bowl. The Rose Bowl (or Ageas Bowl) cricket ground was built in 2000 along with an accompanying hotel and conference facilities and a 18-hole golf course. It has hosted several international cricket games and a number of well known musical acts such as Oasis, the Who, Neil Diamond, R.E.M. and Billy Joel. Government Matters such as social events, footpaths and sports facilities are governed by the (civil) parish council. Much greater expenditure is managed by the local Borough and Hampshire County Councils. The civil parish council has 14 seats across three wards: West End North, West End South and Kanes Hill. All of the council members at present are either affiliated to the Liberal Democrats or sit as independents; no other political party contested any of the seats at the last election on 6 May 2012. Culture and community The annual West End Carnival takes place each June, although it did not run in 2009 or 2010 due to a lack of volunteers. The parish has an active local history society which runs a museum in the old fire station in the village centre. Education There is one primary school in the village of West End, St. James School. Its predecessor is on the High Street built in 1901 which for a time during the late 20th century became St James's Pre-School. Sport Hampshire County Cricket Club's home ground, the Rose or Ageas Bowl, is in the east of the parish between the M27 and Telegraph Woods. It has a hotel adjoining. Notable people Forester and environmental activist Richard St. Barbe Baker was born in West End. =RMS Titanic rescuer and engineer=Sir Arthur Henry Rostron In the West End's Old Burial Ground, Sir Arthur Henry Rostron is buried. As captain of the he was famous for rescuing 706 of her passengers and crew when sank on 15 April 1912 and was awarded many honours, including being created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE), as well as being awarded a Congressional Gold Medal. In the latter part of his life, he decided to spend his retirement in West End, where he stayed until he died in 1940.

Its name is also spelled Bykche, Biccke, Bykcze, Biczke, and Bitske. It is around west of Budapest. Its administration has undergone many changes; it has been a settlement, a village, a market town, and a village constituting an administrative division. History The name of the Byckche family has been known since 1258 when some members got a large donation of land from the king. According to a document dating from 1306, Botond's sons J√°nos (John) and P√©ter were granted permission to levy tolls in the locality of Bicske. Aerial view of Bicske Castle From 1596 onward, Bicske belonged to the Ottoman Empire. Count √Åd√°m Batthy√°ny bought the land in 1642. The Batthy√°ny family built a castle in 1754‚Äì1755, and made it their residence. The Batthy√°ny family also built an observatory and a little castle (Hegyi-kast√©ly) for the astronomers. During the Batthy√°ny era, the village, which had been destroyed by the Turks, became a prosperous town. From 1688 to 1877, it was the chief town of the district. A Jewish community developed in Bickse during the 18th century; most of its members were associated with the Neolog or Reform Judaism movement. They built a synagogue and a school, which was open to both Christian and Jewish students.https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/bicske Beit Hatfutsot Jewish Genealogy Databases By the 19th century Bicske was a well-developed market town and cultural centre. From 1877 to 1946 it belonged to the district of V√°l. After World War I, an era known as \\"The White Terror,\\" lasting from 1919 - 1921, saw the Jewish community of Bikse under attack by Christians, as homes were looted and citizens were murdered. In 1940, during World War II, Jewish farms and shops were confiscated and nationalized and able-bodied Jewish men were sent to the Ukraine to work in the mines. In May 1940, a ghetto was erected in Bickse and Jews from neighboring towns were brought there for confinement. In June 1940, the ghetto was liquidated and its entire Jewish population was sent to the Komarom ghetto and, that same month, to Auschwitz concentration camp for extermination. The town's synagogue was completely destroyed. Bicske was captured on 24 December 1944 by Soviet troops of the 3rd Ukrainian Front in the course of the Budapest Offensive. On the night of 4 January 1945 the German Nazi 5th SS Panzer Regiment, under the command of Fritz Darges, advanced towards Bicske but was stopped by the 41st Guards Rifle Division of the Soviet 4th Guards Army. The Germans retreated, but destroyed more than thirty Soviet tanks during the battle. In 1947 Bickse became independent. There were 12,000 inhabitants in 1986.

Al has appeared in every episode since \\"Who Are You?\\", with the exception of \\"Still Life\\" from season six and \\"The Greater Good\\" from season fifteen. He has the highest number of episode appearances in both the series and the franchise, with a total of 327 appearances. Early life and background Albert \\"Al\\" Robbins was raised by his mother, who was also a registered nurse. Consequently, Al spent most of his childhood in hospital environments. From a very early age, he was able to understand the cycle of life (healing, birth and death) and as a young man graduated with a Masters Degree in Physiology from Johns Hopkins University. At a young age, Al was hit head-on by a drunk driver and lost both of his legs. He walks with the use of prosthetic limbs and a crutch. Al's accident runs parallel to a similar accident that Hall had at age 32. Al took his first job as a coroner in Arlington, Virginia, where he remained for several years before moving to Las Vegas, Nevada, with his wife and three children; he has since remained there as the Chief Medical Examiner of the graveyard shift at LVPD CSI. Robbins's first appearance was in the Season One episode \\"Who Are You?\\" He became a series regular from Season Three onwards. Career with LVPD Dr. Albert Robbins (known around the lab as \\"Doc\\") is the Chief Medical Examiner (coroner) of the Las Vegas Police Department, working in close conjunction with Dr. Gil Grissom and his nightshift team of CSIs. He is Grissom's intellectual equal ‚Äì the two often carry out academically acquired banter ‚Äì and, like Grissom, Dr. Robbins seems neither nonplussed nor disturbed by the actions and habits in the various subcultures and miscarriages of humanity. Since Grissom's departure, Robbins has been shown to be developing a similar sort of friendship with new CSI Raymond Langston. He offers his \\"fellow sawbones\\" (both men are pathologists) office space in the morgue when he arrives at the lab, and the twosome are occasionally seen singing blues or exchanging \\"medical banter\\" about their hospital experiences while examining bodies and conducting investigations. Robbins even allows Langston to set up an office temporarily in a back room until a more permanent one could be found. Due to his age and disability he usually sends his assistant David Phillips to examine the body on site, though he occasionally goes himself. Despite having a somewhat informal and friendly relationship with the rest of the team, Robbins is the master of his domain. While he may occasionally overlook a minor infraction, if an event or someone's actions put the lives of himself, David or the CSI's in danger, he will have no problem defending his domain or dressing down those who make egregious errors. In \\"Turn On Tune In Drop Dead\\", after a \\"dead\\" body rose from the autopsy table and left the building, a visibly angered Robbins browbeats an EMT who used a miscalibrated mobile heart monitor to erroneously determine the person was dead. He rather bluntly stated that the way it was configured, it wouldn't even detect his own heartbeat, thus risking David's and the CSI's lives in the process. Relationship with colleagues Robbins has a good working relationship with his colleagues. He acts as a mentor to Phillips, especially in Season 3 when Phillips performs his first exhumation. In the season nine premiere, \\"For Warrick\\", an obviously distraught Robbins tells the team that he is going to have the day shift coroner do the postmortem on his friend and colleague Warrick Brown. Personal life Little was revealed of Robbins' personal life for the first several seasons. He was a twin, though the other was stillborn. His mother attributed his career choice to \\"spending so many days next to a dead body.\\" He is married with at least three children; according to the episode \\"Overload\\", the youngest child was born in 1987. He has a Siamese cat which had kittens in season 5; in \\"Cats in the Cradle\\" he stated he is more of a dog person, but he contradicted this in the season six episode \\"Dog Eat Dog\\", stating he preferred cats while doing an autopsy on a woman who had her throat ripped out by a pet dog. He is also terrified of rats, and suits up in a hazmat suit before hunting for an escaped rat in the mortuary in the season seven episode \\"Lab Rats\\". In the season 12 episode \\"Genetic Disorder\\", it was revealed that he and his wife Judy (n√©e Rubino) are grandparents as their daughter Pam just had a baby boy and that their cat was named Cinder. Robbins has a fondness for coffee, specifically macchiatos (\\"Table Stakes\\") and plays guitar in a band he has formed with the day shift coroner. He also keeps an album of autopsy photos of celebrities who have died in Las Vegas and wound up on his table, including Tupac Shakur and The Who bassist John Entwistle (\\"Room service\\"). He walks with a limp and uses crutches because of his prosthetic legs. It is not clear what happened to him, although it is probably due to the accident with a drunk driver which resulted in the amputation of both his legs. In the Season 6 episode \\"Dog Eat Dog\\", Robbins brings in a vegan pie he had baked for his co-workers, although he has never stated he is vegetarian, like co-worker Sara Sidle. He tells Warrick the pie is \\"low fat, low sugar, low carb.\\" Warrick, with a grimaced expression on his face and a mouthful of pie, replies \\"low taste\\". In \\"The Theory of Everything\\", he mentions that he suffers from bradycardia and subsequently wears a pacemaker. In the season 12 episode \\"Genetic Disorder\\" his wife Judy reports a murder that happened at their house, which suggests to Jim Brass that she had an affair. Robbins tells Brass that his past with his own ex-wife makes him assume the worst of the case and calls in a lawyer to help Judy. After the case is closed, Brass apologizes to Robbins for making such an assumption. It is revealed in the episode that Robbins and his wife have been married for 25 years. Judy had engaged the victim, a genealogist, to present Al with a family tree. At the end of the episode Al can finally take a look at the gift and find out he is a direct descendant of William \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody.

He is well known for his popular podcast, The Rock and Roll Geek Show, one of the earliest podcasts and a featured program on Mevio (formerly PodShow), a podcasting start-up and Butler's employer from late 2005 to 2013 as Director of Programming. He left that company to start his own multimedia video production company, \\"MySourceTV\\", with business partner Laura Rose. Butler plays bass guitar and performs vocals with his own band, American Heartbreak. He also previously played bass in the Florida hardcore band Stevie Stiletto, and thrash metal band Exodus. Since 2006 he has also been playing with the San Francisco band Jetboy, although he was kicked out of the band live on his podcast in early November 2009 after expressing disappointment and frustration that the drummer had just quit. In July 2009 Butler joined Ginger from the UK band Wildhearts, as well as former Cult bass player Billy Morrison, for shows at Los Angeles El Ray Theater and The Viper Room. Butler currently plays in a couple different coverbands including \\"The Butlers\\" & \\"FeatherWitch\\". In his spare time he makes \\"Photo Quality Inkjet paper\\" custom buttons featuring pictures of bands (such as The Babys), and '80s adult movie actresses and actors. Aside from the Rock and Roll Geek Show, Butler also hosts several spin-off podcasts such as Cooking With Butler, Rock and Roll Geek Indie Cast, Bangin' With Butler, and Hairbanger's Ball. In 2008 he started another podcast, The Good Clean Fun Show, in which he discusses the details of his week with his co-host Jasper Plan9. The show contains reoccurring comedy segments such as \\"The Beer of the Week\\" where beers are reviewed badly by a simpleton with no taste, and \\"What Would You Do For Love?\\" (in which hypothetical questions about Love\\\\Sex\\\\Marriage\\\\Death are debated). This show pod-faded sometime in 2013. In 2015 he started another podcast, Mad At Dad, with fellow podcaster Dave Slusher of The Evil Genius Chronicles.

He studied at Bologna, probably under Gandolphus, and taught canon law in the same city, perhaps in the school connected with the monastery of SS. Nabore e Felice. He is believed to have become Bishop of Ferrara in 1190. Among his supposed pupils was Lotario de' Conti, afterward Pope Innocent III, who held him in high esteem as is shown by the important cases which the pontiff submitted to him, traces of which still remain in the \\"Corpus Juris\\" (c. Coram, 34, X, I, 29). Two letters addressed by Innocent III to Huguccio were inserted in the Decretals of Gregory IX (c. Quanto, 7, X, IV, 19; c. In quadam, 8, X,III,41). However, Innocent probably was not well acquainted with Huguccio's ideas on the Eucharist when he issued the decretal Cum Marthae (X 3.41.16).For an excerpt from this text with an English translation, see . He wrote a \\"Summa\\" on the \\"Decretum\\" of Gratian, concluded according to some in 1187, according to others after 1190, the most extensive and perhaps the most authoritative commentary of that time.For a recent edition, see Huguccio Pisanus, Summa Decretorum, I: Distinctiones I-XX, ed. O. P≈ôerovsk√Ω, Vatican City 2006. He omits, however, in the commentary the second part of the Causae of the Decretum of Gratian, Causae xxiii-xxvi, a gap which was filled by Johannes de Deo. Huguccio argued, in a widely known opinion, that a pope who fell into heresy automatically lost his see, without the necessity of a formal judgment.See the text from Huguccio's Summa printed in Appendix 1 of Brian Tierney, Foundations of the Conciliar Theory, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1955). Huguccio the grammarian Huguccio the canon lawyer has traditionally been identified with the grammarian Huguccio Pisanus (Hugh of Pisa; Italian Uguccione da Pisa). The grammarian's principal work was the Magnae Derivationes or Liber derivationum,See Darko Senekovic, \\"Ugutius \\"Magnae derivationes\\" ‚Äì √ºber den Erfolg einer lexikographischen Sprachphilosophie,\\" In: Archivum latinitatis medii aevi 64 (2006), pp. 245-252. which dealt with etymologies, and was based on the earlier Derivationes of Osbernus of Gloucester. This identification of the two Huguccios as the same man dates back to a short biography compiled by the Italian historian Mauro Sarti, published posthumously in 1769. However, it has been challenged by Wolfgang M√ºller.M√ºller 1994, pp. 21‚Äì66. While there is too little biographical evidence to be certain either way, M√ºller argues that the canon lawyer who went on to become Bishop of Ferrara is to be distinguished from the grammarian who was born in Pisa.

SANZAAR meets annually and is composed of the CEOs from its member unions. It was formed as SANZAR in 1996 as a joint venture of the South African Rugby Union, the New Zealand Rugby Union and the Australian Rugby Union. From the 2016 season, its name was changed to SANZAAR following the inclusion of the Argentine Rugby Union as a full member of the organisation.  History = Tri-Nations and Super 12: 1996 = SANZAR was formed in 1995, shortly after rugby's move to professionalism, to counter the threat of Australia's Super League, a new rugby league competition that offered large salaries to players. SANZAR proposed the Super 12, an annual provincial competition with teams from all three countries, and the Tri Nations Series, an annual competition between each country's Test teams. This concept was developed by Queensland Rugby Union CEO Terry Doyle, New South Wales Rugby Union CEO David Moffett and Australian Rugby Union CEO Bruce Hayman. Rian Oberholzer was the first CEO of SANZAR. SANZAR's proposals were under serious threat from the World Rugby Corporation (WRC), a company formed by lawyer Geoff Levy and former Wallaby player Ross Turnbull. Both wanted a professional worldwide rugby competition funded by Kerry Packer, who had already developed professional cricket. At one point the WRC had a majority of the All Blacks and Wallaby teams signed up to their competition. However, the South African Rugby Union told the Springboks players that they would never play for their country again if they committed to the WRC, and they remained with the SARU. Most of the All Blacks then followed them, and finally the Wallabies did too. To fund the competitions, SANZAR looked to News Limited, who was the Super League's broadcaster, eventually being offered $555 million over 10 years for worldwide television rights. = Expansion to Super 14 = In 2002, a proposal to expand the Super 12 to fourteen teams, supported by Australia and South Africa, was vetoed by the New Zealand Rugby Union. This led to calls for the Australian and South African teams to withdraw from the competition, but the partnership continued and the issue was revisited before the end of the original 10-year broadcasting deal. For the 2006 season, SANZAR agreed to expand the Super 12 competition with two new teams and to increase the number of Test matches played in the Tri-Nations. Licences were granted for franchises based in Bloemfontein and Perth, creating the Cheetahs and Western Force teams for the expanded Super 14 competition. The SANZAR partnership was tested in 2007 after New Zealand removed its top 22 players from the Super 14 competition, and South Africa's removal of players from the Tri-Nations prompted calls for the Australian Rugby Union to cancel future matches against the Springboks.  Potential South African departure  In 2009 there emerged concerns that South African Rugby Union might opt to break away from the alliance over a dispute about the proposed plan to expand Super Rugby to fifteen teams in 2011, voicing its support for the concept generally but disagreeing over its length and format. On 6 May 2009, however, ARU Chief Executive John O'Neill warned that the South Africans would be the real losers, missing out altogether and potentially losing players if they went ahead with the split. \\"The joint venture must remain intact\\", he urged. \\"I have dealt with the South Africans for years in business and sport. Part of their DNA is to take it to the brink. There's a moment when they will realise they have taken it far enough.\\" On 20 May 2009, SANZAR announced it had reached agreement on a new deal involving all three nations beginning in the 2011 season. = The Rugby Championship and Super Rugby: 2011 = The deal for 2011 to 2015 included: * Super Rugby expanded to 15 teams, and split into three conferences, each with five teams and based in one of the three nations. The four current Australian teams would be joined by a new team in the Australia conference; this license was later awarded to the Melbourne Rebels. * At the same time, the regular season expanded to include 16 matches (8 home, 8 away) per team, with each country playing a double round-robin within its home conference, and playing single matches against four teams from each of the other conferences. * Super Rugby taking three weeks off in June for the mid-year Tests. * The play-offs expanded to six teams, with the conference winners joined by the three non- winners with the most competition points without regard to conference affiliation. The two conference winners with the most competition points received a first-round bye in the play-offs. * The Rugby Championship opening each year in South Africa, and concluding with the two of the three Bledisloe Cup matches between Australia and New Zealand that fall within the Rugby Championship. This allowed Springboks to be released early for their domestic competition, the Currie Cup. = Super Rugby to Argentina and Japan: 2016 = Further expansion was agreed in 2015 to include the Argentine Rugby Union as a full member of SANZAAR from 2016. Three additional teams were included in the Super Rugby competition, one each from South Africa, Argentina and Japan. Two regional groupings were formed: the Australasian Group, with five teams in the Australian Conference and five teams in the New Zealand Conference and the South African Group, with six South African teams, one Argentinean team and one Japanese team split into a four-team Africa 1 Conference a four-team Africa 2 Conference. While a Japanese team has been invited to participate in the Super Rugby competition from 2016, Japan is not a member of SANZAAR at this stage. 2020 will be the Sunwolves (the team from Japan) last year in Super Rugby competition. In 2017, the Australian Rugby Union was rebranded to Rugby Australia.

He soon won admirers throughout the 1930s as a writer with a genuine proletarian viewpoint, as distinct from the purveyors of middle-class Marxist fiction. He was invited in 1930 by John Middleton Murry, founder and editor The Adelphi, who had noticed an essay he had written, to become circulation promoter and later assistant editor of the magazine. For a period in 1936 he was acting editor, and a collection of his articles The Freedom of the Streets appeared in 1938. V.S. Pritchett considered the book to have been the most influential in his life, and George Orwell heard in the essays 'the authentic voice of the ordinary working man, the man who might infuse a new decency into the control of affairs if only he could get there, but who in practice never seems to get much further than the trenches, the sweatshop and the jail.'The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 1 ‚Äì An Age Like This 1945‚Äì1950 (Penguin) E.

(p.291) Common's writings about the day-to-day realities of workers lives include descriptions of how work was performed and production organized, and how knowledge was transmitted from worker to worker. Common's writing also reflects on the separation between the ideas of middle-class intellectuals and the ideas of workers. In his usual warm tone, he wrote \\"Very likely we will have to await the arrival of the intellectuals-in-touch, the unemployed man at present reading in public libraries, the young stoker spending the mornings of his back-shift week ploughing through Shaw and Lawrence, fumbling his way through acceptances and rejections towards a cultural consciousness which squares with this communal experience.\\" Revolt against an Age of Plenty p 32-41 He inspired, prefaced and edited the compilation Seven Shifts (1938), in which seven working men told of their experience. Common and Orwell became friends,http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/george-orwell- hailed-heaton-author-10505289 corresponding and occasionally meeting when Common was running the village shop in Datchworth, Hertfordshire, about ten miles from Orwell's Wallington cottage. The impractical Orwell asked Common's advice on setting up his own shop. After the war he was engaged in writing film scripts including Good Neighbours (1946), about a community scheme in a Scottish town; he also travelled to Newfoundland and Labrador on another film assignment. In 1951 Turnstile Press published Common's best-known book, the autobiographical Kiddar's Luck, in which he vividly describes his childhood on the streets of Edwardian Tyneside, as seen through the lens of his adult socialism. There are four chapters on his life before five years old ‚Äì a feat of detailed memory ‚Äì while his mother's alcoholism and the overbearing father whom Jack at length dramatically defies, form the dark background to the vigorous, at times bravura, narrative. The book found praise as a slice of Geordie naturalism, a convincing depiction of 'the other England' which so beguiled the imagination of contemporary intellectuals. On the other hand, its irony and subtly bitter universality went largely unrecognised. In The Ampersand (1954) Common took the story further, but his publishers went into liquidation two years later.https://jackcommon.com/ Neither book had been a commercial success and Common had not completed the trilogy with his long- promised Riches and Rare, a novel set in Newcastle at the time of the General Strike. Too early (or too old) to be an angry young man of the 1950s, Common was unable to sustain a career in writing. His political attitudes were by now out of fashion, and when he sent the manuscript of In Whitest Britain (1961) to his friend Eric Warman in London, Warman replied in a letter of 7 June 1961 that he was sorry 'such a bloody good writer' could not achieve success. There was too much 'class distinction' in the book, and the downtrodden, golden- hearted workman was a dated 'leading clich√©'. Thus Jack Common, perhaps the finest chronicler of the English working class to follow Robert Tressell, spent his last years in Newport Pagnell writing film treatments at poor rates. Personal life=Newcastle= He was born in Heaton, Newcastle upon Tyne,http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/george-orwell-hailed- heaton-author-10505289 close to the rail-sheds where his father worked as an engine-driver. After attending Chillingham Road School, where he developed a lifelong love of Shelley, and Skerry's College, Newcastle, where he gained some secretarial skills, Common found it difficult to extend his education or get a rewarding job. He became a vigorous speaker in socialist circles at the Royal Arcade in Newcastle and began submitting articles to left-wing journals. =London= In 1928, against the wishes of his father, Common went to London with hope of a better chance of finding work than at home. After a stint as a mechanic in a machine factory, where he was sacked for making suggestions to improve work procedures, he was invited in 1930 by Murry, founder and editor The Adelphi, who had noticed an essay he had written, to become circulation promoter and later assistant editor of the magazine. At this time Common and his partner, Mary Anderson (1901‚Äì1942), a childhood friend from Newcastle who went south to join him, had a son, Peter; another son, Robert, was born later. Though they never married, touching love letters survive from their courtship. Common was poor enough by now to be subsidised by Orwell on occasion, and when the latter was in Morocco in 1938 Common and Mary Anderson looked after the Wallington cottage.Jack Common: Forgotten Geordie Writer, Tom Draper, Reflections on Cinema and Culture, July 8, 2014. Accessed October 2014 In 1939, during the editorship of Max Plowman (1938‚Äì1941), Common left The Adelphi, which by now had become a significant socialist/pacifist publication, closely allied to the Peace Pledge Union. At some time during the Second World War Common moved Peter to Frating Community Farm in Essex, where conscientious objectors, Quakers and refugees attempted to avoid contributing to the war effort by self-sustaining farming. Though many of the men had been in heavy rescue and ambulance work during the Blitz and the women in the Land Army. Mary died in 1942 from cancer, and Common began living with and eventually married Constance Helena (Connie) Wood, n√©e Sambidge (1902‚Äì1979), who had a son Jan from her first marriage to Gilbert Wood, another Newcastle friend of his youth. Their first daughter Caroline Alison (Sally) was born in 1944, followed by twin daughters Mary and Charmian, born in 1946. Meanwhile, Common took part in a number of wartime BBC radio broadcasts, including a lively debate, 'What Matters?', broadcast on 19 June 1942, which featured two opposing sets of speakers representing, roughly, suburbia and 'the streets'. Common remarked: ‚ÄòI like a good argument‚Äô. The family changed residence several times, ending up in a council house at 32 Warren Hamlet, Storrington, Sussex, with Common trying to make ends meet by working at a mushroom nursery, while toiling over scripts and reviews at night, and writing for himself in between. He was acutely oppressed by financial insecurity‚Äîand the lack of beer and tobacco. =Later life= In 1956 Common embarked upon a two-year stint as guide to Chastleton House in the Cotswolds, a position obtained for him through Sir Richard Rees (editor of Adelphi, 1930‚Äì1938). Predictable disagreements with the owner, Alan Clutton-Brock, put an end to an arrangement whereby Common had been able to get some writing done in the winter months. In 1958 a friend from Frating days, Irene Palmer, was instrumental in obtaining a rented Georgian house at 14 St John Street, in the centre of Newport Pagnell. There Common spent hours working on books for film treatment reviews in the 'garden' (a cemetery), walking with Connie in the countryside they both loved, and reading to his children. His daughter Sally later recalled listening to Shelley and Omar Khayyam in the translation of Edward FitzGerald, whose atheistic stance Common was at pains to emphasise. He had always been interested in astronomy (his Uncle Robin was a flat-earther), and Fred Hoyle's theory of an endlessly self-renewing universe, which dispensed with a creator, was attractive. Though not a tactile person, Common was not a stern parent and never struck his children. He had small, feminine hands, badly stained with nicotine, and left domestic work to his wife. He was not a joiner or an activist, nor did he encourage his children to be so. He did, however, blossom in the right setting, often in pubs (a favourite was The Bull in Newport Pagnell), where he enjoyed political arguments with self-taught thinkers like himself. Another favourite haunt was the nearby working men's club on Silver Street, where he took his slippered ease at the bar. He was a connoisseur of beer and was described by his friend Tommy McCulloch as 'fairly jolly' at this period, though he retained his hatred of the 'bulky bourgeoisie' ‚Äì and kept his Newcastle accent. He died of lung cancer in 1968, leaving a mass of unpublished material, which forms the Jack Common Archive, now held in Special Collections at Newcastle University Library.http://www.ncl.ac.uk/library/special- collections/collections/collection_details.php?id=58 In popular culture Sculptor Laurence Bradshaw used Common's brow as a model for his bust of Karl Marx in Highgate Cemetery, saying that he found there a similar patience and understanding. The folk singer/songwriter Jez Lowe has an album entitled Jack Common's Anthem, containing a song of the same name. In 2009, North-East poet and scholar Keith Armstrong published 'Common Words and the Wandering Star' about Jack Common and his work. He has drawn extensively on the archive. North East Folk Band \\"Kiddars Luck\\" formed by John Dixon, Colin McLelland and Alan Beadle have a track on their new album \\"Where the Red Kites Fly\\" called \\"Jack The Lad\\" dedicated to Jack Common.

Early life Scherman was born and raised in Newark, New Jersey, where his parents ran a small grocery store. He attended public school, but in the afternoons joined a Talmud Torah started in 1942 by Rabbi Shalom Ber Gordon, a shaliach of the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn.Horowitz, Rebbetzin Faigie. \\"A Nostalic Look at Jewish Newark\\". Hamodia Magazine, 28 June 2012, pp. 14- 18. Rabbi Gordon influenced many of the 200 boys in his afternoon Talmud Torah to enroll in yeshiva, including young Nosson Scherman, who became a dormitory student at Yeshiva Torah Vodaas at around age 10. Afterwards, he studied in Beth Medrash Elyon in Spring Valley, New York Scherman worked as a rabbi (teacher) for about eight years at Torah VoDaas of Flatbush, later known as Yeshiva Torah Temimah. Afterwards he was a principal at Yeshiva Karlin Stolin of Boro Park for six years. ArtScroll During his tenure as principal, he was recommended to Rabbi Meir Zlotowitz, director of a high-end graphics studio in New York named ArtScroll Studios, as someone who could write copy, and they collaborated on a few projects of brochures and journals. In late 1975, Zlotowitz wrote an English translation and commentary on the Book of Esther in memory of a friend, and asked Scherman to write the introduction. The book sold out its first edition of 20,000 copies within two months. With the encouragement of Rabbi Moses Feinstein, Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetsky, and other Gedolei Yisrael, the two continued producing commentaries, beginning with a translation and commentary on the rest of the Five Megillot (Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations and Ruth), and went on to publish translations and commentaries on the Torah, Prophets, Talmud, Passover Haggadah, siddurs and machzors. In its first 25 years, ArtScroll produced more than 700 books, including novels, history books, children's books and secular textbooks, and is now one of the largest publishers of Jewish books in the United States. Selected bibliography Zlotowitz and Scherman are the general editors of ArtScroll's Talmud, Stone Chumash, Tanakh, Siddur, and Machzor series. They co-authored Megillas Esther: Illustrated Youth Edition (1988), a pocket-size Mincha/Maariv prayerbook (1991), and Selichos: First Night (1992). They have also produced a host of titles on which Scherman is author and Zlotowitz is editor. Scherman contributed translations and commentaries for ArtScroll's Stone Chumash, the ArtScroll Siddurim and Machzorim, and the Stone Tanakh. He served as general editor of the 73-volume translation Schottenstein edition of the Talmud from 1990 until 2005. Scherman attributes his strong English language skills to the stronger general-studies departments that yeshivas had when he was a student, and his correspondence with two out-of-town high school classmates, Mendel Weinbach and Nisson Wolpin. He has said: \\"During the summers we used to write letters. Does anyone correspond today? We wrote to each other - that helped. We tried to outdo each other; we were big-shot teenagers. The only way to learn how to write is to write.\\" He was also among the contributors to The Jewish Observer.Some of his articles are available online including contributions such as The Crisis of Leadership (The Jewish Observer, April 1975, p. 3), Shmittah (The Jewish Observer, December 1972, p. 22), and The Mandate to Communicate Torah in the Vernacular: Excerpts From a Presentation to an Eleventh Grade (The Jewish Observer, April 1998, p. 27).

While attending classes at the synagogue in W√ºrzburg, he met Joseph Sachs, who would become his lifelong friend.Caplan, Sheri J. \\"Marcus Goldman.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 2, edited by William J. Hausman. German Historical Institute. Last modified May 07, 2015. Goldman immigrated to the United States from Frankfurt am Main, Germany, in 1848 during the first great wave of Jewish immigration to America, resulting from the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. Upon arriving in America, his name was changed to Marcus Goldman by US immigration.  Career  Goldman worked as a peddler with a horse-drawn cart and later as a shopkeeper in Philadelphia, where he initially rented the room in a boarding-house previously rented by his old friend Joseph Sachs. In 1869, Goldman relocated to New York City and hung out a shingle on Pine Street in lower Manhattan, with the legend \\"Marcus Goldman & Co.\\", setting himself up as a broker of IOUs. From his earliest days of his business, Goldman was able to singlehandedly transact as much as $5 million worth of commercial paper a year. Successful though he was, Goldman's business was insignificant compared to that of the other Jewish-German bankers of the day. Concerns like J. & W. Seligman & Co., with working capital of $6 million in 1869 (equivalent of $ million in ), were already modern-day investment bankers immersed in underwriting and trading railroad bonds. In 1882, Goldman invited his son-in- law Samuel to join him in the business and changed the firm's name to M. Goldman and Sachs. Business boomed‚Äîsoon the new firm was turning over $30 million worth of paper a year‚Äîand the firm's capital was now $100,000 (equivalent of $ million in ), all of it the senior partners'. For almost fifty years after its inception, all of Goldman Sachs's partners were members of intermarried families. In 1885, Goldman took his own son Henry and his son- in-law Ludwig Dreyfuss into the business as junior partners and the firm adopted its present name, Goldman Sachs & Co. In 1894, Henry Sachs entered the firm, and in 1896, the firm joined the New York Stock Exchange. When Goldman retired, he left the firm in the hands of his son Henry Goldman and his son- in-law Samuel Sachs. In 1904, two of Sachs' sons, Arthur and Paul, joined the firm immediately after graduating from Harvard University.  Personal life and death  Goldman married eighteen-year-old Bertha Goldman, who had also immigrated from Germany. They had five children. Goldman's youngest daughter, Louisa, married Samuel Sachs, the son of close friends and fellow Lower Franconia, Bavaria immigrants. Louisa's older sister and Sam's older brother had already married. His older son, Julius Goldman, married Sarah Adler, daughter of Samuel Adler. Goldman died in Elberon, New Jersey, in the summer of 1904.

Newcastle House is a mansion in Lincoln's Inn Fields in central London, England. It was one of the two largest houses built in London's largest square during its development in the 17th century, the other being Lindsey House. It is the northernmost house on the western side of the square. The house had a complex history. The first version was built in 1641-42 for the Earl of Carlisle. In 1672 it was purchased by William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis and renamed Powis House, but in 1684 it burned down. Reconstruction of a new house - effectively the one which still stands, albeit greatly altered - to designs by Captain William Winde commenced promptly, but in 1688 the house was ransacked by a mob in consequence of Lord Powis's association with the recently deposed James II. The following year Lord Powis's estates were attainted and he fled to France. Powis House was designated the official residence of the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. In 1694 the charter of the newly formed Bank of England was sealed there. By 1705 the house had been returned to the Powis family and in that year they sold it to John Holles,, who had alterations made by John Vanbrugh. Thereafter it was called Newcastle House. The building was a compact block with three main storeys, plus two storeys of basements below and two storeys of attics above. It was built of brick with bold stone quoins, band courses and cornice. There were two projecting wings to the rear, so a large amount of accommodation was fitted into the compact site. Holles left the house to his nephew Thomas Pelham-Holles, who was confusingly also created 1st Duke of Newcastle (his uncle's was the second creation, his the third). This latter duke was a prominent politician and latterly Prime Minister of Great Britain. He held court at Newcastle House for several decades and died there in 1768. He used it as his premier London residence throughout his life (preferring it to 10 Downing Street when he was Prime Minister), and threw many lavish parties there which were attended by much of London society. The Prime Minister was Newcastle House's last aristocratic occupant. His widow sold the house to the banker Henry Kendall for ¬£8,400. He had it divided in two and in 1790 one half was purchased by James Farrer. The solicitors Farrer & Co who still occupy the building, and in the early 20th century they purchased the other half and reunited the building. Also in the early 1900s, the rear wings were removed in connection with the construction of Kingsway, a major thoroughfare which was driven through the small streets just to the west of Lincoln's Inn Fields. Farrer & Co commissioned alternations by Sir Edwin Lutyens in the 1930s, but the building still retains much of its late 17th and early 18th century fabric and appearance. In the 17th century there was a mansion called Newcastle House in Clerkenwell, which belonged to an earlier Duke of Newcastle.

Its purpose was to administer a system of feudal dues; but as well as the revenue collection, the court was also responsible for wardship and livery issues. The court was established from 1540 by two Acts of Parliament, Court of Wards Act 1540 (32 Henry VIII c. 46) and the Wards and Liveries Act 1541 (33 Henry VIII c. 22). As Master of the Court, from 1561, William Cecil was responsible for the upbringing of orphaned heirs to peerages and also, until they came of age, for the administration of their estates. In 1610, King James I attempted to negotiate with Parliament a regular income of ¬£200,000 a year in return for the abolition of the hated Court of Wards. While the negotiations failed, the episode showed Parliament that the royal prerogative could be up for sale.Christopher Hill; God's Englishman : Oliver Cromwell and the English Revolution, page 26; ; In February 1646 (New Style), during the English Civil War, the Court of Wards and Liveries lost its principal function, due to the abolition by the Long Parliament of feudal tenure.'February 1646: Ordinance for removing the Court of Wards', Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660 (1911), p. 833, accessed 19 April 2007 The court was formally abolished soon after the restoration of the monarchy by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660 (12 Charles II c. 24). History Wardship of minor heirs of a tenant in chief was one of the king's ancient \\"feudal incidents\\" (amongst escheat, marriage, relief, custody of an \\"idiot\\",Richardson, 1952, p.167 etc.), that is to say a right of royal prerogative dating back to the feudal principle of seigneurial guardianship.Richardson, 1952, p.118 Such right entitled the king to all the revenues of the deceased's estate, excluding those lands, generally one third of the estate, allocated to his widow as dower, until the heir reached his majority of 21, or 14 if a female. The king generally sold such wardships to the highest bidder or granted them gratis, generally by letters patentRichardson, 1952, p.495 to a favoured courtier as a reward for services, which saved cash having to be found from the privy purse. On attainment of his majority at the age of 21, a proof of age inquisition would be held, resulting in a certification witnessed by prominent men from his local area who certified that he had reached the age of 21. Such certificate then formed the basis for the king to issue a writ to the custodian of the land in question to release it to the heir, who then obtained seizin. An example of such grant made on 20 November 1495 is as follows:Exchequer Accounts, Various, 413/2 (I), folio 8d, quoted by Richardson, 1952, p.166 > Grant to William Martyn, esquire, and William Twynyho, esquire, of the > keeping of the lands late of John Trenchard, tenant in chief, and after the > death of Margaret, widow of the said John, of the lands which she holds in > dower; with the wardship and marriage of Thomas Trenchard, his son and heir. Identification of wardships On the death of every tenant-in-chief the escheator of the county in which he held land was required to hold an inquisition post mortem and report to the Court of Chancery which identified the size and location of the holdings, the rents and services due under feudal land tenure, the name and age of the deceased and the name and age of his heir. A copy was sent to the Exchequer, and after 1540 to the Court of Wards and Liveries.Richardson, 1952, p.493 Increased exploitation of wardships by Tudors The systems for the exploitation of royal feudal incidents fell into decay by the 15th century, but following the accession of King Henry VII (1485‚Äì1509) in 1485, and in order to replenish the royal treasury, a new importance was placed on fully exploiting such rights. Surveyors, commissioners and from 1514 county feodariesRichardson, 1952, p.293 were appointed to actively search for and spy out potential royal wardships, and in each county there were established over wards retained by the king a master, receiver-general, auditor and particular receiver.Richardson, 1952, pp.168‚Äì9 Liberal rewards were paid to anyone providing information allowing the discovery of a new crown ward.Richardson, 1952, p.295 Over all was appointed a \\"Master of the King's Wards\\", to be held at the king's pleasure, first established in late 1503, to supervise royal wardships and administer the lands and revenues of wards during the period of crown control, and to sell those not to be retained. The revenues were paid to the Treasurer of the Chamber, that is to say the king's private funds, not into the Treasury. The master originally was required to declare his accounts orally to the king's own person four times a year, which in 1531 was altered to require the rendering of such accounts to general surveyors.Richardson, 1952, p.295‚Äì6 =List of Masters of Wards= (Source: Richardson, 1952, p. 487) *Sir John Hussey (9 December 1503 ‚Äì June 1513) *Sir Thomas Lovell (14 June 1513 ‚Äì December 1520) *Sir Richard Weston (24 January 1518 ‚Äì November 1526) *Sir Edward Belknap (8 December 1520 ‚Äì March 1521) *Sir Thomas EnglefieldSon of Thomas Englefield(d.1514) (22 May 1526‚Äì1534) *Sir William Paulet (3 November 1526‚Äì1540) Establishment of Court of Wards In 1540 the office of \\"Master of the King's Wards\\" was replaced by the Court of Wards, which assumed complete control of wards and the administration of their lands. This was inspired by the successful establishment of the Court of Augmentations in 1536, and it followed a similar organisation.Richardson, 1952, p.296 The court had a seal and met in quarterly sessions. The other officials included a surveyor, attorney, receiver-general and two auditors.Richardson, 1952, p.296 Amalgamation with Office of Liveries The office of \\"Surveyor of the King's Liveries\\" was in existence between 1514 and 1542, when the office was joined to the Court of Wards, becoming the \\"King's Court of Wards and Liveries\\".Richardson, W.C., Tudor Chamber Administration 1485‚Äì1547, Baton Rouge Louisiana, 1952, pp.487‚Äì8, Appendix 5 =List of Surveyors of Liveries= (Source: Richardson, 1952, p. 487) *Sir Thomas Neville (c. 1514‚Äì1542) *Sir Robert Norwich (15 September 1529‚Äì1535) *Sir Richard Rich (20 April 1535 ‚Äì autumn 1536) *John Hynde (1537‚Äì1542) List of officers of Court of Ward and Liveries (Source: Richardson, 1952, p. 488) =Master= *Sir William Paulet (26 July 1540‚ÄìMay 1554) *Sir Francis Eaglefield (1554 ‚Äì 1558) *Sir Thomas Parry (c.1558 ‚Äì c.1561) *Lord Burghley (1561 ‚Äì 4 August 1598) *Robert Cecil (21 May 1599 ‚Äì 24 May 1612) *George Carew (died 1612) (1612 ‚Äì 13 November 1612) *Walter Cope (c.1553‚Äì1614) (November 1612 ‚Äì 1614) *Sir William Knollys (1544‚Äì1632) (1614 ‚Äì 1618) *Lionel Cranfield (1575‚Äì1645) (1619 ‚Äì 1623) *Sir Robert Naunton (1563‚Äì1635) (30 September 1624 ‚Äì 16 March 1635) *Francis Cottington (c.1579‚Äì1652) (16 March 1635 ‚Äì May 1641) *William, Viscount Saye and Sele (1582‚Äì1662) (1641 ‚Äì ?) =Surveyor= * John Hynde (died 1550) (1542 ‚Äì 1546) * Robert Keilway (by 1515‚Äì1581) (1546 ‚Äì 1581) History of Parliament * Thomas Seckford (1581 ‚Äì December 1587) * Richard Kingsmill (c.1528‚Äì1600) (1590 ‚Äì ?1600) * Cuthbert Pepper (died 1608) (1600 - 1607) * Sir Roger Wilbraham (1553‚Äì1616) (1607 ‚Äì 31 July 1616) * Sir Robert Naunton (1563‚Äì1635) (1617) * Sir Humphrey May (January 1618 ‚Äì April 1618) * Sir Benjamin Rudyerd (1572‚Äì1658) (17 April 1618 ‚Äì 1647) (last surveyor) =Receiver-General= *Philip Paris (2 August 1540 ‚Äì 26 February 1544) *Richard Lee (26 February 1544 ‚Äì 30 January 1545) *John Beaumont (by 1508‚Äì1558/64) (30 January 1545 ‚Äì December 1550) History of Parliament *George Goring (aft.1522-1594)) (3 July 1584 ‚Äì 1594) History of Parliament *Sir William Fleetwood (1551‚Äì1616) (1594 ‚Äì 3 February 1610) History of Parliament *Sir Miles Fleetwood (died 1641) (3 February 1610 ‚Äì 1641) *William Fleetwood (1603‚Äì1674) (1641 ‚Äì 1643) History of Parliament (last receiver) =Attorney= * Thomas Polsted (1540 ‚Äì ) * John Sewster (1541 ‚Äì ) * Richard Goodrich (1546 ‚Äì ) * Nicholas Bacon (1547 ‚Äì ) * Robert Nowell (c.1520‚Äì1569) (1561 ‚Äì 1568) * Richard Onslow (1568 ‚Äì ) * Thomas Wilbraham (1531‚Äì1573) (23 April 1571 ‚Äì ?1573) History of Parliament * Richard Kingsmill (c.1528‚Äì1600) (1573 ‚Äì 1589) History of Parliament * James Morris (1589 ‚Äì ) * Sir Thomas Hesketh (1548-1605) (1597 ‚Äì ?1605) History of Parliament * Sir Henry Hobart (c.1560‚Äì1625) (1605 ‚Äì ?1606) * Sir James Ley (c.1552‚Äì1629) (November 1608 ‚Äì 1621) History of Parliament * Walter Pye (1571-1635) (2 February 1621 ‚Äì 26 December 1635) History of Parliament * Henry Calthorpe (23 January 1636 ‚Äì29 September 1637) * Sir Rowland Wandesford (29 September 1637 ‚Äì ) =Auditor= * Sir John Peryent (1544 ‚Äì 1551) (jointly) * William Tooke (1507‚Äì1588) (1544 ‚Äì 1588) History of Parliament (jointly to 1551) * Walter Tooke (1588 ‚Äì ) * Cuthbert Pepper (died 1608) (1607 - 1608) History of Parliament * John Tooke (22 March 1610 ‚Äì 22 May 1634) * Thomas Tooke (5 June 1624 ‚Äì 9 June 1634) * James Tooke (9 June 1634 ‚Äì 5 February 1638) * Charles Maynard (22 May 1634 ‚Äì 5 Feb 1638) * ?Walter Prichard (1638) ? * John Heath (1614-1691) (1643 ‚Äì 1646) History of Parliament See also *William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester, first Master of the Court Sources *Richardson, W.C., Tudor Chamber Administration 1485-1547, Baton Rouge Louisiana, 1952. *Richard Aldrich, An Introduction to the History of Education, London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1982, p. 96 *Joan Simon, Education and Society in Tudor England, Cambridge: University Printing House, 1966, p. 344 ReferencesExternal links *National Archives Category:1540 establishments in England Category:Dissolution of the Monasteries Category:Former courts and tribunals in England and Wales Category:The National Archives (United Kingdom) Category:1660s disestablishments in England Category:Courts and tribunals established in 1540 Category:Courts and tribunals disestablished in the 1660s ","title":"Court of Wards and Liveries"},{"id":"3945198","text":"Edward J.

Monographs in systematic botany from the Missouri Botanical Garden 85: i‚Äìxlii,. Cultivation Echinodorus are by nature marsh and bog plants that can grow submersed. Many species are grown in aquariums. They prefer good light and grow best in a deep, nutrient-rich substrate. Most will grow in variable water conditions, though the majority need tropical or sub-tropical temperature ranges. Propagation is by division or by adventitious new plants developing on submerged flowering stems. The larger species make magnificent specimen plants for the larger aquarium, though they may form aerial leaves in good conditions. If the inflorescence forms submersed, small plantlets will form instead of flowers. If grown emersed and kept humid, flowers and seeds will normally readily form. The seeds can be grown in damp sand in warm, damp conditions. Additional CO2 often helps in strong growth.The Amazon Swordplant : Origins, Identification and Care Many species are popular in the aquarium or pond.

He discovered the ancient site of Tepe Gawra in 1927 and supervised its excavation between 1931 and 1938. Speiser was married to Sue Gimbel Dannenbaum, granddaughter of Charles Gimbel of the Gimbel Brothers. They had two children together, Jean and Joel. Early life Speiser was born in Skalat, Galicia (then in Austrian Poland, now Ukraine) on January 24, 1902. He went to school in Lemberg (later called Lwow, now Lviv), attending the Imperial Gymnasium of Lemberg and later graduating from the College of Lemberg in 1918. Two years later, at the age of 18, he emigrated to the United States and eventually became a US citizen in 1926. In the United States, Speiser received his M.A. in Semitics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1923, studying under J.A. Montgomery and Max Margolis. He continued his studies under Max Margolis and earned his Ph.D. from Dropsie College in Philadelphia in 1924. Career From 1924 to 1926, Speiser was a Harrison Research Fellow in Semitics at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1926, he won a Guggenheim Fellowship to study the remains of the ancient Mitanni and Hurrians in northern Iraq. The members of the Mittani-Hurrian tribes still spoke Hittite; Speiser was one of few in the United States who could speak the language. In 1927, while in northern Iraq, Speiser discovered the Tepe Gawra (or ‚ÄúGreat Mound‚Äù), one of the earliest known examples of civilization. During this time, he was Director of the Baghdad School of the American Schools of Oriental Research and taught at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. From 1930-32 and 1936‚Äì37, Speiser served as Field Director of the Joint Excavation of the American Schools of Oriental Research and the University Museum, undertaking excavations in Tepe Gawra and Tell Billa, also known as Shibaniba. In 1936, Speiser also took over the position as field director for the excavation of the Sumerian site of Khafajeh after the University Museum took it over from the Oriental Institute in Chicago. In 1928 he was appointed assistant professor of Semitics at the University of Pennsylvania, and full professor in 1931. Only a few years later, he was appointed as Chairman of the Department of Oriental Studies, a position he used to develop the study of Assyriology at the University of Pennsylvania. During World War II, Speiser left academia to become chief of the Office of Strategic Services' Near East Section of the Research and Analysis Branch in Washington, D.C. This position earned him a Certificate of Merit. He was one of many American students and scholars of Orientalism who entered and served in the intelligence services during World War II.

Ground and first floor plans Powis House was an 18th-century mansion in London, England. It stood on the northern side of Great Ormond Street, not far from Queen Square. The first version of Powis House was built in the 1690s for William Herbert, 2nd Marquess of Powis. No drawings of this version survive. At some point it was let for use as the French embassy, and on 26 January 1713 it burned to the ground. Jonathan Swift attributed this event to \\"the carelessness of the rascally French servants\\". A replacement house was soon built. It had three main storeys above an arched basement and was 104 feet (32 metres) wide. The subtle but lively fa√ßade featured Corinthian pilasters and a phoenix above the front door. The architect is unknown, but may have been French. The staircase walls were painted by the Venetian painter of the rococo, Giacomo Amiconi. Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke leased the house in the mid 18th century and from 1764 to 1783 it was the Spanish embassy. However, the locality was rapidly falling from favour with the aristocracy, making the demise of the house more or less inevitable, and by the end of the 18th century it had been demolished. There is now a small access street to Great Ormond Street Hospital called Powis Place.

It stood high, and was the tallest building in Great Britain when it opened some time between 1898 and 1900. Neglected during the First World War and requiring renovation the owners could not afford, dismantling of the tower began in 1919, and the metal was sold for scrap. The building at its base, housing the Tower Ballroom, continued in use until damaged by fire in 1969. The tower was set in large grounds, which included a boating lake, a funfair, gardens, and a sports ground. The sports ground housed, at different times, a football team, an athletics track and a motorcycle speedway track. The Beatles played at the Tower Ballroom 27 times, more than at any other venue in the United Kingdom except the Cavern Club in nearby Liverpool. Location In 1830, James Atherton purchased much of the land at Rock Point, in the north- east corner of Wallasey opposite the city and docks of Liverpool. He renamed it New Brighton and organised its development as a tourist destination. In July 1896 a new group, the New Brighton Tower and Recreation Company, with a share capital of ¬£300,000, purchased the estate of the demolished Rock Point House. Their ambition was to create an observation tower in the grounds, designed to rival the Blackpool Tower, while using the remaining grounds to create a more \\"elegant\\" atmosphere. The New Brighton Tower and Recreation Company had more than of land available to construct the tower, which enabled them to include more attractions than at Blackpool Tower. Construction New Brighton Tower in the early 1900s The company Maxwell and Tuke, who had designed Blackpool Tower buildings and Southport Winter Gardens, was responsible for overseeing and supervising the project, despite the deaths in 1893 of the company founders, James Maxwell and William Charles Tuke. The excavations and laying of the foundations for the tower were contracted to William Clapham of Stockport. The primary contractor for the tower was Andrew Handyside and Company, based in Derby. The ground breaking happened on 22 June 1896, before the formation of the new company, completion of land purchase and announcement of contracts on 26 July 1896. The construction of the steel lattice tower started in July 1897 and was completed some time between 1898 and 1900, 10 years after the Blackpool Tower had been finished. The grounds were opened before then for a short period in 1897 however. New Brighton Tower was the tallest building in England, standing tall, and above sea-level. A total of of mild or low-carbon steel was used, at a cost of ¬£120,000, in contrast to the earlier Blackpool and Eiffel towers, both constructed using wrought iron. The building below the New Brighton Tower, which was to contain the ballroom, was constructed by Peters and Sons of Rochdale. It was a four- storey red-brick building with arched windows and hexagonal, copper-domed turrets. A series of accidents during the tower's construction resulted in the deaths of six workmen and serious injury to another. Two of the men, Jonathan Richardson and Alexander Stewart, were killed when a crane hook snapped and a girder fell and hit the scaffold platform on which they were standing, causing them to fall to the ground. A third man, John Daly, suffered serious injuries. The other four were killed in separate incidents by falling off the tower structure. A fire on the tower at in 1898 resulted in the death of a fire- fighter from the New Brighton Fire Brigade. He fell while walking along a beam wide to try and extinguish the flames. Tower building New Brighton Tower regularly advertised itself as \\"the highest structure and finest place of amusement in the Kingdom\\". A single entrance fee of one shilling (or a ticket for the summer season, costing 10s 6d) was charged for entrance into the grounds, which included the gardens, the athletic grounds, the ballroom and the theatre. An additional charge of sixpence was levied on those who wished to go to the top of the tower. There was a menagerie within the building, containing Nubian lions, Russian wolves (which had eight cubs in 1914), bears in a bear pit, monkeys, elephants, stags, leopards and other animals. There was also an aviary above the ballroom. The Tower Building also contained a shooting gallery and a billiard saloon with five tables. =Tower= The tower had four lifts, each capable of reaching the top in 90 seconds and conveying up to 2000 people an hour. The views from the top included the Liverpool skyline, the River Mersey estuary and the River Dee. On a clear day visitors could see across the Irish Sea to the Isle of Man, along with views of the Lake District and Welsh Mountains. In its first year the tower attracted up to half a million visitors to the top. At night the tower was illuminated by fairy lights. On 7 September 1909 two visitors were left stranded at the top of the tower as the final lift car of the night descended without them. The woman and twelve-year-old child were not noticed during the final round of inspection and so, without a way to communicate with anyone on the ground, they spent the night on the tower until 10 am the following morning. They did not appear too concerned by the ordeal and left without giving their names to officials. =Tower Ballroom= The Beatles plaque in New Brighton The ballroom had a sprung floor and dance band stage. It could accommodate more than a thousand couples dancing and had a separate area for couples to learn the dances before taking to the main floor. It was decorated in white and gold with emblems of Lancashire towns, and had balcony seating for spectators. The composer Granville Bantock was enlisted as musical director in 1897 at the ballroom to provide music each weekday for six hours of ballroom dancing. To begin with, as the tower was being erected, he was in charge of a \\"semi- military band\\" that played outdoors with the fear that the tower might fall upon him and his players. Bantock is quoted as saying, \\"The noise of the riveting of the tower while we were playing ... reminded me of the anvil music in Das Rheingold\\". Bantock often played for the workmen during their lunch breaks, when they could frequently be heard saying, \\"play it again, guv'nor\\". Soon, Granville had a full orchestra at his disposal, so he convinced the management committee to allow him to give classical concerts on Fridays and Sundays. He then embarked on advanced concerts of new composers, as well as his own works. As he had difficulty finding time to practise these works, Bantock used afternoon sessions, in which he was supposed to play dance music, to rehearse his classical pieces. When the classical pieces spread to the afternoon programme, the management felt it was not commercially viable to continue the concerts. After three years at the tower, Bantock was appointed Principal of the School of Music at Birmingham and Midland Institute. The composer Edward Elgar conducted his Enigma Variations at the New Brighton Tower Ballroom in 1898, the second time he performed the piece. In 1900 he conducted Tchaikovsky's Path√©tique symphony at New Brighton Tower. The interior of the ballroom was completely destroyed by fire in 1956, but it was restored in its original style and reopened two years later. On 10 November 1961, The Beatles played for an audience of 4,000 people at the New Brighton Tower Ballroom as the headline act of a five-and-a-half-hour concert named Operation Big Beat. Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, Gerry and the Pacemakers, Remo Four and Kingsize Taylor and the Dominoes also performed at the concert. The Beatles played at the venue 27 times, commemorated in a blue plaque erected in New Brighton in 2011. The only British venue The Beatles played at more often was the Cavern Club. Little Richard and the Rolling Stones also performed at the Tower Building. =Tower Theatre= On 30 May 1898 the Tower Theatre was opened, sited between the legs of the tower. Capable of accommodating an audience of 2,500, it was the largest theatre in England outside London. Each season at the theatre was different; some years it would show a play or an opera, others it would focus on variety acts such as magicians, comedians and lion tamer Mademoiselle Marguerite, with her seven lions. Wrestling was hosted at the theatre as early as 1903, and had become a weekly event by 1937. When the Americans occupied the site during the Second World War, they used the Tower Theatre to show their own roadshows to the troops. Grounds The tower's grounds were enclosed by iron railings, and throughout the gardens the roads and paths were illuminated with 30,000 red, white and green fairy lights at night. The tower's grounds had a band stand, a dancing platform, a fountain, seal pond and tennis courts. The gardens were separated into wooded areas, rockeries and flower beds. There was a lake in the grounds, which had a water chute and gondolas with Venetian gondoliers. There were also a number of venues providing refreshments, including a Japanese restaurant that could cater for up to 700 people, the Parisian Tea Garden, the Rock Point Castle restaurant, which could accommodate 400 people, and an Algerian caf√©. At the grounds of the tower there was a large permanent funfair, with rides including Figure of Eight, Wall Of Death, Donkey Derby, The Himalayan Switchback Railway and The Caterpillar. To give easy access from the promenade entrance to the tower, a chair lift was introduced. In 1898‚Äì99 an acrobat named Hardy performed for a season at the tower without a safety net and often without a balancing pole on the high wire above the dancing platform. In 1908 the 'Himalaya Railway' was replaced with a scenic railway. =Tower Athletic Ground= An area was set aside within the grounds for athletics, aptly named the Tower Athletic Ground. It consisted of a stadium opened in 1896; the hope was to provide additional entertainment for visitors to the tower in the winter months. The capacity of the grounds varied, but at one point was as high as 100,000, although attendances rarely, if ever, approached that figure. The New Brighton Tower and Recreation Company formed a football team, New Brighton Tower F.C., and applied for membership to the Lancashire League. The team joined at the start of the 1897‚Äì98 season and promptly won the league. The club then applied for election to the Football League. Although they were initially rejected, the league later decided to expand Division Two by four clubs and New Brighton Tower were accepted. They carried on playing until 1901 when the company disbanded the team as they did not gain the fan base they were hoping for and so it was no longer considered financially viable. The Tower Athletic Grounds was a multi-purpose stadium and ground that could be laid out for athletics field events. The field was encircled by an athletics track surrounded by a banked cycle track, which hosted the World Cycling championships in July 1922. It was the biggest sporting and motorcycling track in the North of England. In 1933, the athletics track was replaced for use every Saturday by motorcycle speedway racing. Disaster struck the motorcycling in 1911 when T. Henshaw's bike struck six spectators at around . This left Henshaw with serious fractures and one woman with a severe brain injury. In another incident on 18 May 1959 five people were injured while watching a motorcycling stunt when a wide section of stands collapsed, causing the spectators to fall to the ground. On 15 May 1919 a fire destroyed the grandstand. During the Second World War, the United States Army took over the Tower Athletic Grounds as a storage facility for military vehicles to be used in the invasion of France. Following the war the stadium was reopened as the home ground for New Brighton A.F.C., whose Sandheys Park had been requisitioned for housing. They sold it to the Wallasey Housing Corporation in 1977. =Exhibitions= In 1900, New Brighton Tower athletic grounds boasted the UK's first visit from a group known as The Ashanti Village, in which 100 West African men, women and children re-created an Ashanti village, produced and sold their wares and performed \\"war tournaments, songs [and] fetish dances\\". Although they had arrived, delays meant that they were not set up in time for Whitsun the traditional start of the summer season. As was common at fairgrounds of the time, there was a Bioscope exhibition showing the latest wartime pictures to audiences of up to 2,000. In the summer of 1907 there was a Hale's Tours of the World exhibition in the tower's grounds, consisting of short films shown in a stylised railway carriage with sound effects and movements at the appropriate times. Closure The tower was closed in 1914 following the outbreak of the First World War, for the duration of which the steel structure was not maintained and consequently became rusty. During the war the government made unsuccessful attempts to buy the tower for its metal. Controversy still surrounds the decision to dismantle the tower after the war ended; some still believe the structure was safe and could have been repaired. Demolition began in 1919 and by 1921 only the ballroom remained. The metal was sold to scrap dealers. The tower was the tallest structure to be demolished in the UK until 7 September 2016, when a taller chimney at Grain Power Station was demolished. On 5 April 1969 the ballroom was destroyed by fire, the cause of which is unknown. In place of the tower's grounds, including the athletics ground and stadium, a new housing estate was built, River View Park, which has a community football pitch and swing park. In 1997 Wirral Council made an unsuccessful bid for Millennium funding to build a new tower in New Brighton.

It is quite similar to the Cori cycle in the cycling of nutrients between skeletal muscle and the liver. When muscles degrade amino acids for energy needs, the resulting nitrogen is transaminated to pyruvate to form alanine. This is performed by the enzyme alanine transaminase (ALT), which converts L-glutamate and pyruvate into Œ±-ketoglutarate and L-alanine. The resulting L-alanine is shuttled to the liver where the nitrogen enters the urea cycle and the pyruvate is used to make glucose. The Cahill cycle is less productive than the Cori cycle, which uses lactate, since a byproduct of energy production from alanine is production of urea. Removal of the urea is energy-dependent, requiring four \\"high-energy\\" phosphate bonds (3 ATP hydrolyzed to 2 ADP and one AMP), thus the net ATP produced is less than that found in the Cori cycle. However, unlike in the Cori cycle, NADH is conserved because lactate is not formed. This allows for it to be oxidized via the electron transport chain. The alanine cycle also serves other purposes: * Recycling of carbon skeletons in muscle and liver. * Participation in the transport of ammonium to the liver and conversion into urea. This cycle is an important part of mammal physiology, but its presence and physiological significance in non-mammalian land vertebrates is unclear. For example although some fish use alanine as a nitrogen carrier, the cycle is unlikely to take place due to a slower glucose turnover rate and lower release of alanine from exercising muscle tissue. The Cahill cycle ultimately serves as a method of ridding the muscle tissue of the toxic ammonium ion, as well as indirectly providing glucose to energy-deprived muscle tissue. Under long periods of fasting, skeletal muscle can be degraded for use as an energy source to supplement the glucose being produced from the breakdown of glycogen. The breakdown of branch chain amino acids yields a carbon skeleton utilized for energy purposes, as well as free ammonium ions, the levels of which can quickly accumulate. Because skeletal muscle is unable to utilize the urea cycle to safely dispose of the ammonium ion, it must get rid of it in a different way. To do so, the ammonium is combined with free Œ±-ketoglutarate via a transamination reaction in the cell, yielding glutamate and Œ±-keto acid. Alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) then coverts glutamate back into Œ±-ketoglutarate, this time transferring the ammonium to pyruvate resulting from glycolysis, forming free alanine. The alanine amino acid acts as a shuttle - it leaves the cell, entering the blood stream and traveling to hepatocytes in the liver, where essentially this entire process is reversed. Alanine undergoes a transamination reaction with free Œ±-ketoglutarate to yield glutamate, which is then deaminated to form pyruvate and, ultimately, free ammonium ion. Hepatocytes are capable of metabolizing the toxic ammonium by the urea cycle, thus disposing of it safely. Having rid the muscle cells of the ammonium ion successfully, the cycle then provides the energy-deprived skeletal muscle cells with glucose. Pyruvate formed from the deamination of glutamate in the hepatocytes undergoes gluconeogenesis to form glucose, which can then enter the bloodstream and be shuttled to the skeletal muscle tissue, thus providing it with the energy source it needs.

Ironically, it was also the first London bus route to use the Routemaster. In the 1950s, the route was run using AEC Regent IIIs. On 8 February 1956, the first prototype AEC Routemaster ran on route 2 between Golders Green and Crystal Palace and after undergoing modifications the following year, it passed to route 260. On 29 January 1994, route 2 was converted to one man operation with the AEC Routemasters replaced by Leyland Olympians and MCW Metrobuses. In 2003, brand new Alexander ALX400 bodied Volvo B7TLs were introduced. Conversion to the type took place a few months before the contract was renewed. In 2015, the route received a part allocation of Enviro 400's from route 341. Some of its longer 10.6 metre Volvo B7TL's were transferred to Edmonton Garage for use on route 123.

Its common names include white- clawed crayfish and Atlantic stream crayfish. Distribution and ecology It is found from the easterly Balkan Peninsula to Spain and reaches its northerly limit in Great Britain and Ireland, where it is limited to some regions only: its highest densities are in chalk streams. A. pallipes is the only crayfish found in Ireland, occurring over limestone areas in rivers, streams, canals, and lakes. It is absent from the more acidic waters of the west, and occurs in streams with a moderate flow alongside other freshwater invertebrates such as caddis fly, mayfly, and mollusc species. Trout and three-spined stickleback also occur in the same habitat. Tree roots and rocks in the banks provide shelter. Juveniles shelter in vegetation such as watercress and grass mats growing out of the bank. Description A. pallipes is olive-brown, with pale undersides to the claws (whence its specific Latin epithet pallipes, \\"pale feet\\"). It may grow to long and adult sizes below are more common. It typically lives in rivers and streams about 1 metre deep, where it hides among rocks and submerged logs, emerging to forage for food, and in lakes. Conservation In France A. pallipes is found in streams such as the Mornante and Sellon, two small tributaries of the Dorlay in the Loire department. It is protected as a heritage species. It was once found across most of England and Wales. The distribution is rapidly shrinking and in Great Britain it is recorded in: central and northern England, east Kent, eastern Wales, the Candover Brook that flows into the Itchen in Hampshire; parts of Essex, and several long headwaters of the Thames, where it competes with the introduced noble crayfish. Dowdeswell Reservoir, Gloucestershire, has the species and during works of 1998, Severn Trent ensured its protection.‚ÄòConservation of the native crayfish population at Dowdeswell Reservoir during engineering works‚Äô, March 1998, for Severn Trent Water. Disease from invasive species has wiped it from the naturally alkaline River Frome, Bristol, 2007-08. Two main reasons for decline are: *introduction of the invasive North American signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). The former is a carrier of crayfish plague, an infectious disease to which it has resistance - A. pallipes has none. *water pollution: many local extinctions are caused by surface runoff of insecticides and bleached, insufficiently treated, or illegal untreated wastewater.

Among the smaller towns in the Central Transdanubia Region of Hungary, it lies between the V√©rtes and Bakony Hills, in the northwestern corner of Fej√©r County. The historic roots of the present town go back to the Celtic and Roman period. The town is the economical, institutional and cultural centre of the small region of M√≥r including 13 settlements. The development of the town began with the arrival of ethnic German settlers and Capuchin monks in 1697. The Battle of M√≥r on December 30, 1848 was a crucial victory for the Austrian Empire's forces in crushing the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Lamberg Palace of M√≥r The Wine Region of M√≥r Antiquarian artefacts show that vine growing occurred even in the Roman period. Vine growing came to stay from the 11th century in this area. The ethnic German settlers and the Capuchin monks started to grow grape vines in the beginning of the 18th century. The oenological boom lasted until the Phylloxera bane in 1875-1880 that killed most of the vineyards. Afterwards, Ezerj√≥ became the most important type of wine in M√≥r, which now belongs to the Hungaricums. Ezerj√≥ is a heavy, late-ripening sort of vine. Unlike other parts of Hungary that produce sweet dessert wines, the wines from Mor tend to be clear and dry similar to a sauvignon blanc. Smaller, locally owned vineyards are giving away to commercial growers who have discovered Mor's perfect climate, soil, and humidity. Timed to coincide with the grape harvest is the annual Wine Days of Mor festival, usually occurring in late September or early October. For one week each year, the town's population explodes to support this rural festival that highlights local culture. It includes the selection of a \\"Wine Princess\\" who oversees the festival, a multi-national parade celebrating Hungary's equestrian roots as well as the local wine culture, a stage for music, drama and dance, row upon row of stalls filled with regional food, crafts, local wines and palinka. On the final Saturday evening of the festival a street party is held and the entire town turns into a big dance party.  The M√≥r massacre  On May 9, 2002, around noon, two armed men entered an Erste Bank office in M√≥r. For reasons unknown, they shot everyone in the building, including the customers, and left with 7.3 million Forints. Six people died instantly, the two survivors died in the hospital the following day. The case was not only notable for the brutality shown by the perpetrators, but also for the police confusion that followed: four days after the incident, police claimed that they had apprehended the two gunmen, Szil√°rd Horv√°th (who voluntarily gave himself up) and R√≥bert Farkas; the claim turned out to be false, however, as Horv√°th proved his alibi, and Farkas turned out to be an unlikely suspect as well.Index - Politika - A m√≥ri √ºgy √∂t √©ve: k√©pek, esem√©nyek On July 22, police arrested Ede Kaiser and L√°szl√≥ Hajd√∫, who were also suspected to have committed the robbery. This claim seemed more plausible, as both suspects had criminal records, and the witness reports seemed to fit their likeness; a month later, however, police major L√°szl√≥ Ferenczi admitted that all evidence in the case was indirect, and that the DNA tests failed to bring a result. The two men were arraigned, found guilty and sentenced between 2004 and 2006. In February 2007, however, events took a sharp turn when a person apprehended after a murder of a postman at Tatab√°nya claimed to be one of the attackers at M√≥r. Investigation eventually revealed that the evidence collection in the case of Kaiser and Hajd√∫ was blatantly cursory, and that the key witness of the case might have lied in court; the guns used at the robbery were eventually found at the apartment of one of the new suspects.

RSTA operations are designed to support military operations at a strategic (national defense policy), operational (theater level), or tactical (individual unit) level, either by dedicated RSTA forces or those which possess the capability. Additionally, an RSTA squadron is a type of unit in the United States Army. These are small reconnaissance units based on cavalry squadrons, and act at the squadron (battalion) level as a reconnaissance unit for their parent Brigade Combat Teams. Doctrine Overview RSTA operations are concerned not only with the collection of military intelligence, but ensuring that it is accurate, relevant, and distributed in a timely manner to the appropriate user. This includes maintaining Operational Security (OPSEC) so that critical information cannot be exploited by an opposing force. Likewise, RSTA can play a role in Operational Deception (OPDEC) operations to confuse opposing forces. Across the strategic, operational and tactical level, RSTA operations fall within three areas: =Indications and Warning (I&W;)= Indications and Warnings (I&W;) are \\"intelligence activities intended to detect and report time- sensitive intelligence information on foreign developments that could involve a threat to the United States or allied and/or coalition military, political, or economic interests or to US citizens abroad.\\" On a strategic and operational level, RSTA operations may provide continuous surveillance or as- required reconnaissance, in order to provide warnings of impending threats or attacks, as well as to monitor compliance with international agreements. =Planning and Employment= Strategically, RSTA Planning and Employment operations are used to support the planning of military operations, by monitoring foreign nations' centers of warmaking capability, and providing information on enemy system capabilities, locations, and installations for the National Target Base and other target lists. This information is used to assist in formulation of the U.S. military's Single Integrated Operational Plan, Limited Attack Option plan, Unified Command Plan, and Joint Strategic Capabilities Plans. Operationally, RSTA operations are similar to both the strategic and tactical levels, in that they provide commanders with data on areas such as environment, organization, infrastructure, and enemy forces to assist in planning theater wide operations. Tactically, RSTA operations provide detailed information about enemy orders of battle, movement plans, offensive and defensive capabilities, terrain, and enemy disposition. RSTA units provide target detection and acquisition ( and in some cases, elimination), and real-time intelligence and surveillance. =Assessment= At all three levels of command, RSTA units provide combat assessment before, during and after military operations. This includes tasks such as bomb damage assessment or determining if an OPDEC mission has succeeded. RSTA assessment can help to decide if a military operation was successful in achieving its objectives, whether additional resources need to be directed to complete the objectives or if they can be redirected to another operation. The RSTA Squadron As part of its current modernization and reorganization plan, the US Army has transitioned to the use of a modular Brigade Combat Team (BCT) scheme. For each of its three main types of BCTs, whether infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT), Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCT), or Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT), there is a reconnaissance squadron which is tasked with performing reconnaissance and security missions for the BCT.FM 3‚Äì20.96 Reconnaissance and Cavalry Squadron. Department of the Army. May 2016. Ch. 1 Sec. 1 Related to these units are Reconnaissance & Surveillance Squadrons which operate as part of Battlefield Surveillance Brigades. The primary task of the RSTA squadron is to carry out reconnaissance and security missions for its parent BCT or for higher commands, whether as part of offensive or defensive operations. Reconnaissance missions can include area, route, zone, and reconnaissance-in-force. Security missions can include screening (whether stationary or mobile), guard, cover, area security and local security. When necessary, the squadron can be augmented with additional forces to help in carrying out its missions. =ABCT Squadron= The ABCT Cavalry squadron is composed of a headquarters troop, two cavalry troops (transitioning to three cavalry troops), an armored company, and a forward support company attached from the Brigade Support Battalion.FM 3‚Äì20.96 Reconnaissance and Cavalry Squadron. Department of the Army. May 2016. Ch. 1 Sec. 3 *The headquarters troop includes a command group, the troop headquarters section, the squadron primary staff, a medical platoon, an attached fire support cell, and a tactical air control party. Total strength includes 149 personnel, two Bradley Fighting Vehicles, three M577A1 Command Post Carriers, two M577A1 Medical Treatment Vehicles, eight M113A3 Ambulances, fourteen HMMWVs, and six FMTVs, with appropriate equipment carried in additional trailers.The U.S. Military‚Äôs Force Structure: A Primer. Congressional Budget Office. June 2016. Chapter 2 - Army Armored Brigade Combat Teams *Each cavalry troop consists of a headquarters section, two scout platoons, and a mortar section. The headquarters section includes the troop commander, executive officer, first sergeant, unit supply, and attached fire support team and combat medics. Each scout platoon consists of three M3 Bradley vehicles (each carrying two scouts) and five HMMWVs equipped with long-range multisensor systems, with plans to transition each troop to have six M3 vehicles. The mortar section has two 120-mm mortars and a fire direction center. Total strength for each cavalry troop includes 93 personnel, seven Bradley vehicles, eleven HMMWVs, two M1064 mortar carriers, an M113 Armored Personnel Carrier, an M577A1 Command Post Carrier, and an FMTV. *The armor company consists of a headquarters element and three tank platoons. The headquarters consists of two tanks commanded by the company commander and executive officer, with attached fire support team and combat medics. Total strength includes 62 personnel, fourteen M1 Abrams, an M577A1 Command Post Carrier, two HMMWVs and an FMTV. The ABCT Cavalry squadron can fight against comparable armor forces, including tanks and other armored fighting vehicles, in order to conduct its missions. However it has significant logistical and maintenance requirements and the use of different vehicle types creates a mix in survivability between platforms. The limited number of scout platoons reduces the size of the area the troop can operate in. =IBCT Squadron= The IBCT Cavalry squadron includes a headquarters troop, two mounted cavalry troops, and a dismounted cavalry troop. A forward support company will also be attached from the brigade support battalion for sustainment purposes. *The headquarters troop includes a command group, the troop headquarters section, the squadron primary staff, a medical platoon, an attached fire support cell, and a tactical air control party. Total strength includes 130 personnel, seventeen HMMWVs, ten M997 Ambulances, three M1117 Armored Security Vehicles, and five FMTVs, with appropriate equipment carried in additional trailers.The U.S. Military‚Äôs Force Structure: A Primer. Congressional Budget Office. June 2016. Chapter 2 - Army Infantry Brigade Combat Teams *Each mounted cavalry troop consists of a headquarters section, three scout platoons and a mortar section. The headquarters section includes the troop commander, executive officer, first sergeant, unit supply, and attached fire support team and combat medics. Each scout platoon has two HMMWVs, each with a crew of three of which one is available for dismounted scouting. The scout platoons are equipped with six M220 TOW-2 anti-armor systems firing the BGM-71 TOW missile backed up by FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missiles; four of the six HMMWVs are also equipped with the Long-Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System. The mortar section consists of two HMMWV- towed 120mm mortars and a fire direction center. Total strength includes 92 personnel, nine HMMWVs, and two FMTVs. *The dismounted cavalry troop includes a headquarters section, two scout platoons, a mortar section, a sniper squad and attached fire support team; it can also include up to eight two-man dismounted forward observer teams. The headquarters section includes the troop commander, executive officer, first sergeant, unit supply, and attached fire support team and combat medics. Each scout platoon is divided into three sections, while the sniper squad consists of a squad leader, two three-man sniper teams, and an HMMWV. The mortar section consists of two 60mm mortars and a fire direction center. While largely lacking organic transport, the dismounted cavalry troop is easily deployable from both fixed-wing and rotary- wing aircraft. Total strength includes 79 personnel, four HMMWVs and an FMTV. The IBCT Cavalry squadron is able to support its parent unit through the combination of the firepower and mobility offered by its mounted forces and the ability to operate in complex and difficult terrain with its dismounted forces. However the mix of mounted and dismounted troops creates a mismatch in maneuvering ability and may require augmentation with additional transportation resources. =SBCT Squadron= The SBCT Cavalry squadron includes a headquarters troop and three cavalry troops, along with a forward support company attached from the brigade support battalion. *The headquarters troop includes a command group, the troop headquarters section, the squadron primary staff, a medical platoon, an attached fire support cell, and a tactical air control party. Total strength includes 131 personnel, six Stryker CVs, fifteen HMMWVs, and seven FMTVs, with appropriate equipment carried in additional trailers.The U.S. Military‚Äôs Force Structure: A Primer. Congressional Budget Office. June 2016. Chapter 2 - Army Stryker Brigade Combat Teams *Each cavalry troop consists of a headquarters section, two scout platoons and a mortar section. The headquarters section includes the troop commander, executive officer, first sergeant, unit supply, and attached fire support team and combat medics. Each scout platoon has four Stryker RVs (with plans to transition to six Stryker RVs) and four FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missiles. The mortar section consists of two Stryker MCVs and a fire direction center. Total strength includes 92 personnel, one Stryker CV, thirteen Stryker RVs, two Stryker MCVs, and two FTMVs. The SBCT Cavalry squadron can cover a large area thanks to its three cavalry troops equipped with extremely mobile Stryker vehicles. The squadron is limited though in its ability to conduct dismounted reconnaissance or engage enemy armor units. The four-vehicle cavalry troops also face additional risks during route reconnaissance as individual Strykers are forced to reconnoiter lateral routes and terrain adjacent to the route. =Training= RSTA line troops are a mix of 19D (cavalry scout) and 11B (Infantryman) MOS's, which serve as scouts and snipers. Also included are 11C (Indirect Fire Infantryman), which operate a 60 mm M224 Mortar Section, as well as various intelligence and communications soldiers. The MTOE of the infantry troop includes organic Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (Zodiac F470) to insert the infantry. The infantry troop (being in a cavalry squadron, makes it a \\"troop\\", not a company) has few wheeled vehicles which directly belong to the troop. The operational cycle for the infantry troop is plan, insert, infiltrate, execute, exfiltrate, extract, and finally debrief. In squadrons supporting an airborne brigade combat team, 100% of the RSTA soldiers are qualified paratroopers.

The right-hander reached his highest singles ATP ranking on 12 December 1988, when he became the number 126 of the world when he was still 3 weeks short of his 19th birthday. Career He remained in the top 130 (with the exception of a couple of weeks) until August 1989. His singles highlights in 1988 included winning the Indian Satellite Circuit, making R2 of the ATP tour event in Schenectady (losing to Kriek in R2) and at the Seoul Olympics (where he lost to Hlasek in R2), making the finals of a Challenger in New Haven (losing to Vijay Amritraj) and the semifinal of a Challenger in Indonesia. Those performances had taken Zeeshan to 178 in the singles rankings in November 1988, but he then dominated a Satellite circuit in Japan to finish the year as 126 in singles. At the end of 1988, Zeeshan's doubles ranking was at 154. In 1989, Zeeshan made the quarter finals of a Challenger in Nigeria early in the year, and then qualified into tour events in Key Biscayne, Tokyo (where he beat Leif Shiras before losing to Stefan Edberg in R2), Singapore and London (Queen's Club). In 1989 he played his only Grand Slam match in singles, losing in straight sets to Wally Masur at Wimbledon. In 1989, he made third round in doubles at Wimbledon with Jonathan Canter (losing to the seeded pair of Curren and Pate in four sets), and won two Challenger doubles titles (in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing). In 1988, he also made the second round of the Wimbledon doubles (with Mark Ferreira), two Challenger doubles finals (one with Mark) and four Challenger semi-finals (one of them with 37-year-old Anand Amritraj). Even in 1990, he won a Challenger doubles title (in Winnetka, IL) and made another Challenger doubles final (in Kenya), although playing a much lighter schedule. But after 1991, Zeeshan was mainly playing Challengers and Satellites in India and Asia. He won the Gold in the Asian Games in 1994 and Bronze in 1990. Zeeshan was also ranked number 2 in the world and #1 in Asia in the Juniors in 1986. Zeeshan won a total of 14 ITF junior tournaments that year and reached the semi finals of singles at Junior Wimbledon.

The first director-general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), he is revered as the \\"father of research laboratories\\" in India. He was also the first Chairman of the University Grants Commission(India) (UGC). In 1958, to honour his name and legacy, the Indian Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) instituted the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology for scientists who have made significant contributions in various branches of science. Early life Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar was born in the Bhera, Punjab region of British India, in a Hindu kayastha family. His father, Parmeshwari Sahai Bhatnagar, died when he was eight months old, and he spent his childhood in the house of his maternal grandfather, an engineer, who helped him develop a liking for science and engineering. He enjoyed building mechanical toys, electronic batteries, and string telephones. From his maternal family he also inherited a gift of poetry. He completed his elementary education from the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic High School, Sikandrabad (Bulandshahr). In 1911 he joined the newly established Dayal Singh College, Lahore (which was later moved to New Delhi, India after independence) where he became an active member of the Saraswati Stage Society and earned a good reputation as an actor. He wrote an Urdu one-act play called Karamati (Wonder worker), the English translation of which earned him the Saraswati Stage Society prize and medal for the best play of the year in 1912. Bhatnagar passed the Intermediate Examination of the Punjab University in 1913 in first class and joined the Forman Christian College,where he obtained a BSc in physics in 1916, and an MSc in chemistry in 1919. Education and early research Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar was awarded a scholarship by the Dayal Singh College Trust to study abroad, and he left for America via England. However, he could not find open berths on English ships, as they were all reserved for American troops, who were then being demobilised due to the First World War. The Trustee permitted him to join the University College London under chemistry professor Frederick G. Donnan. He earned his Doctorate in Science in 1921. While in London, he was supported by the British Department of Scientific and Industrial Research with a fellowship of ¬£250 a year. In August 1921, he returned to India and immediately joined the newly established Banaras Hindu University (BHU) as a professor of chemistry, where he remained for three years. He wrote the ‚ÄòKulgeet‚Äô, or University song. Justice N.H. Bhagwati, the then Vice-Chancellor of BHU said: \\"Many of you perhaps do not know that besides being an eminent scientist, Professor Bhatnagar was a Hindi poet of repute and that during his stay in Banaras, he composed the ‚ÄòKulgeet‚Äô of the University. Professor Bhatnagar is remembered with reverence in this University and will continue to be so until this University exists.\\" He then moved to Lahore as a Professor of Physical Chemistry and Director of University Chemical Laboratories of the University of the Punjab. This portion of his career was the most active period of his life in original scientific work. His research interests included emulsions, colloids, and industrial chemistry, but his fundamental contributions were in the field of magneto-chemistry, the use of magnetism for the study of chemical reactions. In 1928 he and K.N. Mathur jointly developed the Bhatnagar-Mathur Magnetic Interference Balance, which was one of the most sensitive instruments at the time for measuring magnetic properties. It was exhibited at the Royal Society Soiree in 1931 and it was marketed by Messers Adam Hilger and Co, London. Professional career Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar's first industrial problem was developing the process for converting bagasse (peelings of sugarcane) into food-cake for cattle. This was done for Sir Ganga Ram, the Grand Old Man of Punjab. He also solved industrial problems for Delhi Cloth & General Mills, J.K. Mills Ltd. of Kanpur, Ganesh Flour Mills Ltd. of Layallapur, Tata Oil Mills Ltd. of Bombay, and Steel Brothers & Co. Ltd. of London. His major innovation was an improvement of the procedure for drilling crude oil. The Attock Oil Company at Rawalpindi (representative of Messers Steel Brothers & Co London) had confronted a peculiar problem, wherein the mud used for the drilling operation was hardened upon contact with saline water, thereby clogging the drill holes. Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar realised that this problem could be solved by colloidal chemistry. He added an Indian gum, which had the remarkable property of lowering the viscosity of the mud suspension and of increasing at the same time its stability against the flocculating action of electrolytes. M/s Steel Brothers was so pleased that they offered Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar a sum of Rs. 1,500,000/- for research work on any subject related to petroleum. The company placed the fund through the university and it was used to establish the Department of Petroleum Research under the guidance of Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar. Investigations carried out under this collaborative scheme included deodorisation of waxes, increasing flame height of kerosene and utilisation of waste products in the vegetable oil and mineral oil industries. Recognizing the commercial success of the research, the company increased the fund, and extended the period from five years to ten. Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar persistently refused any personal monetary benefit from his research fundings, and instead advocated for strengthening research facilities at the university. Meghnad Saha wrote to Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar in 1934 saying, \\"You have hereby raised the status of the university teachers in the estimation of public, not to speak of the benefit conferred on your Alma Mater\\". Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar wrote jointly with K.N. Mathur Physical Principles and Applications of Magnetochemistry which is considered a standard work on the subject. =Establishment of CSIR= The first industrial research organisation in India was created as an Industrial Intelligence and Research Bureau, which came into operation in April 1935 under the Indian Stores Department. With its limited budget of Rs. 1.2 lakhs per year, the bureau was virtually inactive. In 1939 there was a strong movement to abolish the bureau, and to replace it with a Board of Scientific and Industrial Research, similar to the British BSIR. Under the persuasive pressure of Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar, the Board of Scientific and Industrial Research (BSIR) was formed on 1 April 1940 for a period of two years. Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar, as a leading scientist of the time, was appointed as the Director, and Mudaliar became the Chairman. The BSIR had an annual budget of Rs. 5 lakhs which was placed under the Department of Commerce. Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar persuaded the government to set up an Industrial Research Utilisation Committee (IRUC) in early 1941 for further investment into industrial research. Mudaliar also won the demand for an establishment of Industrial Research Fund, and that it should have an annual grant of Rs 1 million for a period of five years, at the Central Assembly in Delhi at its session on 14 November 1941. These finally led to the constitution of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) as an autonomous body, which came into operation on 28 September 1942. The BSIR and IRUC became the advisory bodies to the governing body of the CSIR. In 1943 the governing body approved the proposal mooted by Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar to establish five national laboratories ‚Äì the National Chemical Laboratory, the National Physical Laboratory, the Fuel Research Station, and the Glass and Ceramics Research Institute. This was the beginning of scientific laboratories in India. Later years Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar played a significant part along with Homi Jehangir Bhabha, Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis, Vikram Sarabhai and others in the building of India's post-independence science and technology infrastructure and policies. Prime Minister Nehru was a proponent of scientific development, and after India's independence in 1947, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) was set up under the chairmanship of Dr. Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar. He became its first Director-General, and by his works he is largely remembered for having established various chemical laboratories in India. He established a total of twelve national laboratories such as Central Food Processing Technological Institute, Mysore, National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, the National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi, the National Metallurgical Laboratory, Jamshedpur, the Central Fuel Institute, Dhanbad, in addition to numerous other laboratories. While at CSIR, he mentored a number young scientists of the time who were working at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS) in Kolkata, including Syamadas Chatterjee, Santilal Banerjee (MSc Gold Medalist- Dacca University and a DSc from the US) who later moved to the National Physical Laboratory in Delhi at Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar's urging), and Asutosh Mookherjee. Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar also closely followed the work of C. V. Raman and Kariamanickam Srinivasa Krishnan at IACS on the Raman Effect and in particular the work Krishnan and his partner, Santilal Banerjee, were doing on the magnetism of small crystals. He also served as Secretary of the Ministry of Education and Educational Adviser for the government. He played a role both in the constitution and deliberations of the Scientific Manpower Committee Report of 1948. \\"It may be pointed out that this was the first-ever systematic assessment of the scientific manpower needs of the country in all aspects which served as an important policy document for the government to plan the post-independent S&T; infrastructure.\\" Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar was a university professor for nineteen years from 1921 until 1940. First at the Banaras Hindu University and then at the Punjab University and he had a reputation as a teacher. It was as a teacher that he himself was most happy. His research contribution in the areas of magnetochemistry and physical chemistry of emulsion were widely recognised. He also did considerable work in applied chemistry. He played an instrumental role in the establishment of the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) of India, which bridged the gap between research and development. Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar was responsible for the initiation of the Industrial Research Association movement in the country. He constituted the one-man Commission in 1951 to negotiate with oil companies for starting refineries and this ultimately led to the establishment of many oil refineries in different parts of the country. He induced many individuals and organisations to donate liberally for the cause of science and education. He died of a heart attack on 1 January 1955, at the age of 60. Honours and recognition Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar was elected one of the first Fellows of the Indian Academy of Sciences (FASc) in 1934; he was appointed a Foundation Fellow of the National Institute of Sciences of India (FNI; now the Indian National Science Academy) the following year.Prior to 1970, the Indian National Science Academy was named the \\"National Institute of Sciences of India\\", and its fellows bore the post-nominal \\"FNI\\". The post- nominal became \\"FNA\\" in 1970 when the association adopted its present name. For his contributions to pure and applied chemistry, Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1936 New Year Honours List. The British government knighted him in the 1941 New Year Honours List for his contributions to the advancement of science. Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar was appointed a Fellow of the Institute of Physics (FInstP) in 1942, and was also appointed a Fellow of the Royal Institute of Chemistry (FRIC) that year. In 1943 the Society of Chemical Industry, London, elected him as Honorary Member and later as Vice-President. Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1943. In independent India, he was the President of the Indian Chemical Society, National Institute of Sciences of India and the Indian National Science Congress. He was awarded Padma Bhushan by the government of India in 1954. A prestigious Indian science award, Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology was created in his honour.

The CyberARTS program has been honoured by Maclean's magazine as one of the best programs in Canada. Many international delegates come from the UK, Spain, the United States and China to study the unique model of this program. In addition to learning art, design, and technology, the students are also taught about important skills such as organization, work ethic, presentation skills, professionalism, career building and post-secondary planning. Program creation and location The CyberARTS program was created in 1995 by a group of educators, principally Sharron Forrest, Tito Faria, Jon Mergler, Mike Morey, Linda Newman, Terry Wensley, Doris Fleming, Katherine Yamashita and Lesley Monette who saw a need for enriched learning through the arts and had a unique vision for digital arts at the [high school and middle school levels. Their purpose was to develop a program for students wanting to specialize in particular subjects within the combined areas of the arts and technology. Art is the foundation of the digital program. Support for the program initially came from the Don Mills Collegiate Institute, Don Mills Middle School, Northview Heights Secondary School and the North York Board of Education's Computers in Education Program. The program had educational partnerships with businesses such as Alias/SGIWavefront, Apple Canada, Kodak Canada, Rogers Communications and Softimage and organizations like the Textile Museum of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, Ontario College of Art & Design, Sheridan College and the University of Waterloo School of Architecture. CyberARTS is offered at the following middle and high schools: Charles H. Best Middle School, Don Mills Collegiate Institute, Don Mills Middle School, Northview Heights Secondary School, Western Technical-Commercial School, Lakeshore Collegiate Institute and Innisdale Secondary School. Structure CyberARTS is an integrated program in which students gain credits in Visual Art, Media Literacy, Communications Technology, Computer Science, Music, Drama, Dance, Media Studies and Co-op. Curriculum in CyberARTS is designed so that the teacher is a facilitator, manager and producer while students take an active role in problem solving the task at hand whether it be creating or publishing children's books' authoring interactive CD-ROMS, organizing a conference or creating a traditional portrait. Each lesson unit in CyberARTS has an integration of at least two of the main CyberARTS subject areas and results in the completion of a major project. Staff and students at both levels work together to expand and improve the knowledge gained by students participating in the projects. The knowledge gained by students on these projects may assist them to make educational and vocational decisions. CyberARTS is also committed to both formal and informal experiences in Cooperative education and seeks in the development of curriculum to provide \\"real world\\" projects that extend beyond the classroom. Credits are granted for each course delivered to meet the Ministry outcomes. CyberARTS students are expected to contribute to the program, school and/or greater community. These community hours will involve student application of their artistic, creative design and technological abilities in a variety of areas. Some examples include: * Graphic design for the school newspaper or yearbook * Environmental design for the science program * Fashion design for the DMCI Fashion Show * Stage Design for the Drama and Music Program * Web design for individual programs at DMCI Students are encouraged to take on leadership roles in these activities as part of the curriculum and skills training. Teachers of the CyberARTs program specialize in visual art education and have had a background as a working professional involved in some aspect of the visual arts. Former experience includes being artists, filmmakers, curators, art administrators, designers and graphic artists. Entrance Requirements Entry to the high school program is based on a successful interview, and application package. The interview involves completing a creative activity, such as a still life drawing. The potential student will be assessed in a 15-minute face to face interview with two CyberARTS teachers, and two senior CyberARTS students. It is recommended that the student brings a portfolio and sketchbook. The application package includes a student information sheet, an interest and background form (for students applying in grade 7 or 8 only), a parent nomination form, a creative writing piece, a self-portrait (using only a pencil), and a release of information form. Prospective students are required submit this package to the school of their choice by the beginning of the year.

They thus decided to re-create the National Anthem in a year 2000 version, something that should be 'inspiring for young people to listen to.' Bharat Bala Productions roped in A R Rahman to produce the music and 60 artistes were taken to Ladakh in North India to film the video for the instrumental version of the video. The final instrumental was a 40-piece string section along with Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma, Vikku Vinayakram and other instrumental maestros of Indian classical music. Most of the performances included two generations of maestros - fathers and sons. In Kanika‚Äôs words, \\"It was a huge musical unification... this anthem has so much of soul.\\" It is also notable that during the filming of the anthem with the Ladakh Scouts, there were about 500 jawans who fought during the Kargil war. The producers hoisted a huge flag about 40 feet long for the video in their honour. Thota Tharini, an artist based out of Madras painted what is now the Vande Mataram logo for the video. Error and Correction There are many versions of this video in circulation. One of the versions has recitation of the words \\"Jaya He\\" (Victory to thee) four times, instead of three. This fourth time recitation of \\"Jaya He\\" by Asha Bhosle has been omitted in the corrected version.

On 19 November 1908, the route was altered at both ends to run between Oxford Circus and South Croydon. From April 1909 it was extended on Sundays to Purley, then to Whyteleafe in August 1909. A month later, route 3 was extended northwards to Camden Town, and was withdrawn between Streatham Common and Whyteleafe. On 3 March 1910, route 3 was withdrawn between Brixton (Lambeth Town Hall) and Streatham Common and re- routed via Effra Road to Brixton. In the same month the route was extended to Hampstead Heath. From 16 June 1912, route 3 became a Monday to Saturday route only, being replaced by the recently introduced 59 on Sundays. On 11 May 1913, a new daily route 3A was introduced between Camden Town and Crystal Palace via route 3 to Brixton, then via Water Lane, Herne Hill, Croxted Road and South Croxted Road. Routes 3 and 3A only ran as such until 17 July 1913, when both routes became daily and exchanged numbers. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the 3A was withdrawn as an economy measure, but was re-instated in October. Route 3 was extended from Crystal Palace to Upper Norwood a month later. By the end of hostilities route 3A had been withdrawn and route 3 ran between Camden Town to Crystal Palace. On 1 December 1924, a new system of route numbering on London buses came into force under The London Traffic Act of 1924. As a result, the short workings of route 3 from Camden Town to Brixton were renumbered 3A. This situation continued until 3 October 1934 when all 3A journeys were renumbered 3. Just before the outbreak World War II, route 3 was replaced on Sundays by a new 3A route, running from Crystal Palace to Oxford Circus and on to Baker Street, Swiss Cottage, Hendon, Mill Hill and Edgware station. This was withdrawn after 15 October 1939 as a wartime economy measure. Route 3 returned to a 7-day operation and remained virtually unchanged for the next 40 years.

Here meets the √ñreghegy () and the √öjhegy () in Northwest, the Inner Somogy Hill Range in the Northeast and the River Drava in the South. The town can be approached by car or train. It lies on the Domb√≥v√°r-Gy√©k√©nyes Railway Line. History The territory of Csurg√≥ was already inhabited in prehistoric times according to archaeological finds. During the Roman times this place was on the road which connected Pannonia province to the Adriatic Sea. Csurg√≥ was first mentioned in the establishing charter of the Abbey of Zalav√°r in 1019 when Saint Stephen of Hungary donated the village and its goods to the Benedictine monks. During the √Årp√°d era it was one of the lands of the free royal swineherds. Then later the sister of B√©la III, Margit gave it to the Crusaders. They settled on the so-called Fels≈ë-Csurg√≥ () part of the village on a hill in a marsh. Then later the Order of Malta arrived on that place. The Johanniter Order founded their first monastery between 1217 and 1226 which served as a fortress, hospital and church. According to the legends B√©la IV fled through Csurg√≥ after the Battle of Muhi where he stayed for a night and drank from the Holy Mary Well. Csurg√≥ was given market town rights on September 28, 1405 by Sigismund Luxemburg. Its castle was built in the 15th century but was demolished in the 18th century. There was also a church built in the 13th century which was repeatedly rebuilt since 1731. Sebesty√©n Tin√≥di Lantos moved here in 1543 and stayed for two years after his lord was captured by the Turks. During the Turkish occupation the town lost most of its residents. In the beginning of the 18th century Csurg√≥ was almost empty and belonged to the Festetics family who decided to revive the settlement. They allowed Hungarians, Germans, Croats and Slovaks to settle in the village. Its Calvinist secondary school was founded in 1792. Also the famous Hungarian poet, Mih√°ly Csokonai Vit√©z taught there between the May 26, 1799 and February 17, 1800.

Created around the year 515 BC, it is the only complete example of the surviving 27 vases painted by the renowned Euphronios and is considered one of the finest Greek vase artifacts in existence. Part of the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1972 to 2008, the vase was repatriated to Italy under an agreement negotiated in February 2006, and is now in the collection of the Archaeological Museum of Cerveteri as part of a strategy of returning stolen works of art to their place of origin.Stokstad, Marilyn and Michael W. Cothren. Art History. Fourth Edition, vol. 1. Pearson Prentice Hall, 2011. p119. Description The Euphronios Krater stands 45.7 cm (18 inches) in height and has a diameter of 55.1 cm (21.7 inches). It can hold about 45 L (12 gallons). The style of the vase is red-figure pottery, in which figure outlines, details, and the background are painted with an opaque black slip while the figures themselves are left in the color of the unpainted terracotta ceramic clay. The krater is decorated with two scenes. An episode from the Trojan War is shown on the obverse; this illustration depicts the death of Sarpedon, son of Zeus and Laodamia. The reverse of the krater shows a contemporary scene of Athenian youths from the sixth century BC arming themselves before battle. In the scene of Sarpedon's death, the god Hermes directs the personifications of Sleep (Hypnos) and Death (Thanatos) to carry the fallen away to his homeland for burial. While the subject of Sarpedon's death might normally be depicted as a stylized tableau, the figures in this scene are painted in naturalistic poses and with schematic but accurate anatomy. This style is emblematic of the Pioneer Group of late Archaic painters, of whom Euphronios is considered the most accomplished. The scene of the anonymous Greek youths on the reverse shares this naturalistic style, using all the Pioneer Group's characteristic techniques of anatomical accuracy, natural poses, foreshortening, and spatial illusion. Also characteristic of the Pioneer Group is the narrative tension created both by pairing these two scenes on the same piece, and by painting them in a common style. The death of Sarpedon, a quasi-mythological story which would be familiar to anyone viewing the krater, is an episode involving specific historical and mythological figures. The other scene, of the anonymous youths preparing for war, is both more general and explicitly contemporary. The young men are not heroes of legend; with their finely detailed features, they are given personality and character, but they could be any of the youthful soldiers in the Greek army. Both scenes are painted with similar styles, making the historical scene appear more contemporary; likewise, the contemporary scene begins to share some of the other's mythological qualities. The two scenes invite comparison between the narratives they depict; certainly, the hero Sarpedon was no less youthful than these anonymous boys, and Death and Sleep may well come for them as they did for him. The vase is signed both by Euxitheos as potter and Euphronios as painter. While it was customary for the painter to sign the finished work, it was less common for the potter to add his own name. The presence of both signatures indicates that Euxitheos felt the vase to be one of his finest works. Besides the artists' signatures on the obverse side, it also carries the inscription \\"Leagros is handsome.\\" on the reverse. This inscription has allowed art historians to date the krater to approximately 520-510 BC, because at this time Leagros was considered the handsomest man in Greece. All names are written in Attic letters. History Records in Italian courts of an investigation indicate that the krater was looted from an Etruscan tomb in the Greppe Sant'Angelo near Cerveteri in December 1971. The krater was sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by Robert E. Hecht, an American antiquities dealer living in Rome, for US$1.2 million on November 10, 1972. Hecht, who was accused of trafficking in illicit antiquities, claimed to have acquired the krater from Dikran Sarrafian, a Lebanese dealer, whose family had been in possession of the piece since 1920. Evidence suggests that Hecht may have purchased the krater in 1972 from Giacomo Medici, an Italian dealer who was convicted of selling stolen art in 2005. Hecht denied the charges. Thomas Hoving, director of the Met and the primary negotiator in the purchase, later said in his memoirs, Making the Mummies Dance, \\"An intact red-figured Greek vase of the early sixth century B.C. could only have been found in Etruscan territory in Italy, by illegal excavators\\". To allay concerns, some six months after the krater was bought he prompted the Metropolitan Museum to send a private detective to Zurich in an endeavor to reinforce the cited Sarrafian provenance. In 2006, following the trial of Giacomo Medici and related disclosures about antiquities smuggling, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Italian government signed an agreement under which ownership of the Euphronios Krater and several other pieces of art was returned to Italy in exchange for long-term loans of other comparable objects owned by Italy. The krater remained on display at the Metropolitan Museum until January 2008, when it returned to Italy. It was unveiled in Rome on 18 January.Povoledo, Elisabetta, Ancient Vase Comes Home to a Hero‚Äôs Welcome. New York Times (19 January 2008). The krater was displayed at the Villa Giulia National Etruscan Museum in Rome from 2008-14 until it was moved as part of a temporary display in the Cerveteri Museum celebrating the UNESCO World Heritage Site affiliation for the necropolis at Banditaccia. Following the increase of attendance at the museum, the Cultural Heritage Minister, Dario Franceschini, has announced that the krater will remain at the Archaeological Museum of Cerveteri as part of a strategy of returning works of art to their place of origin. Details from the krater's obverse have been used as a book cover illustration. The Penguin Classics deluxe edition of Robert Fagles' English translation of the Iliad employs a close-up of Thanatos for its front cover, and a close-up of Sarpedon for its back cover.

The flight crashed at around 19:07 UTC, killing all on board. The flight was operated as a charter by British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) using the aircraft (\\"Yoke Yoke\\"), with a South African crew of seven, and carrying fourteen passengers. Flight and disaster Gerry Bull and other BOAC engineers examined the aircraft for Flight 201. Previously, the same team had examined BOAC Flight 781 (a Comet that had broken up at altitude in January 1954) prior to its final flight.\\"Comet Air Crash\\" (\\"Crash of the Comet\\"). Seconds From Disaster. Flight 201 took off from London for Rome at 13:00 UTC on Wednesday 7 April 1954, on the first leg southward to Johannesburg, arriving at Rome approximately two and a half hours later, at 17:35 UTC. On arrival at Rome, engineers discovered some minor faults, including a faulty fuel gauge and 30 loose bolts on the left wing, which delayed the aircraft's departure by 25 hours before Yoke Yoke was ready to depart for Cairo on the evening of Thursday 8 April. The aircraft took off for Cairo at 18:32 UTC under the command of Captain William Mostert, and climbed rapidly toward its cruising height of . The crew reported over the Ostia beacon at 18:37 UTC, passing through the altitude of . The weather was good, but with an overcast sky. Another report was made from the aircraft, first at 18:49 UTC at Ponza, where it reported climbing through and another at 18:57 UTC when it reported passing abeam of Naples. At 19:07 UTC, while still climbing, the aircraft contacted Cairo on the long range HF radio and reported an ETA of 21:02 UTC. This was the last message heard from Yoke Yoke as some time later, the aircraft disintegrated in the night sky at around , killing everyone on board. After repeated attempts at re-gaining contact by both Cairo and Rome air traffic control were made and went unanswered, it was realised that another Comet had been lost. Initial news of the accident was leaked to the press by a German radio station which had been monitoring the radio transmissions. The New York Times wrote that: Bull said he found it difficult to accept the fact that the circumstances surrounding the crash of BOAC flight 781 three months earlier had occurred again with the South African Airways flight. Search and recovery As soon as it heard of the crash, BOAC once again voluntarily grounded all of its Comets as it had done three months earlier after the BOAC Flight 781 disaster. The Italian air-sea rescue services were notified, and searching began at dawn the next day, subsequently involving the Royal Navy carrier and the destroyer . Some time later that day, a report was received from a BEA Ambassador aircraft of an oil patch some east of Naples and bodies and wreckage in the water south-east of Stromboli. The depth of the Mediterranean Sea at the crash site meant that a salvage mission was ruled out as impractical, but if the cause of the BOAC crash was found, it would also explain the SA crash due to the close similarities of the two. Official investigation At the time of the accident, the investigation into the crash of BOAC Flight 781 was still in progress, but suspicion of the cause of the crash had fallen on the possibility of an engine turbine failure. During the previous grounding of all Comets, modifications had been made to the aircraft, including Yoke Yoke, that seemed to eliminate this possibility. After an extensive multi-year investigation chaired by Lionel Cohen, Baron Cohen, the official document of findings was released by the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, on 1 February 1955, as Civil Aircraft Accident Report of the Court of Inquiry into the Accidents to Comet G-ALYP on 10 January 1954 and Comet G-ALYY on 8 April 1954. The joint investigation of this accident, and of BOAC 781, revealed manufacturer design defects (square windows) and metal fatigue that resulted ultimately in the explosive decompression that caused both accidents. In popular culture The events of Flight 201 were included in \\"Ripped Apart\\", a Season 6 (2007) episode of the Canadian TV series Mayday (called Air Emergency and Air Disasters in the U.S. and Air Crash Investigation in the UK and elsewhere around the world). This special episode examined aviation emergencies that were caused by pressurization failure or explosive decompression; the episode also featured BOAC Flight 781.

Geological setting and evolution The Perth Basin began forming in the Late Permian during the breakup of Gondwana, as the Australian continental plate began rifting away from the African and Indian continental plates. During the Permian, what is now the Perth Basin was the eastern half of a rift valley that formed as the continental plates were pulled apart. This pulling apart, which continued until the Jurassic, led to the central zone subsiding as a graben allowing the sea to enter with the subsequent deposition of transgressive marine sediments. The Perth Basin architecture is dominated by listric, extensional faulting that formed during sedimentation and controlled the distribution of the sediments. The primary mechanism for sedimentation was originally subsidence creating accommodation (space for sediments to accumulate), followed by fault extension and more recently, sediment loading, i.e. the basin continuing to subside because of the weight of sediments within it. The eastern boundary of the main Perth Basin is the Darling Fault, topographically expressed as the Darling Scarp. Small outliers of the Perth Basin, such as the Collie Sub- basin, lie east of the Darling Fault. Stratigraphy Letters in brackets after the formation name represent shorthand symbols used on geological maps. =Quaternary and recent= The Quaternary and recent sedimentation of the Perth Basin is represented by thin, impermanent sand dune systems, biogenic limestones, sandstones and some shales deposited during the last ~20 million years and during ice ages. = Cretaceous = * Lancelin Formation Upper Cretaceous glauconitic marl, infrequently developed on top of the Coolyena Group. * Coolyena Group - Upper Cretaceous marine sediments.  Poison Hill Greensand (Kcp) consists of pale yellow unconsolidated weathered clay, glauconitic sandstone and shale. It conformably overlies the Gingin Chalk and is in turn overlain by unconsolidated Quaternary sands and alluvium.  Gingin Chalk (Kcg) is a weakly consolidated fossiliferous chalk composed of coccoliths, which interfingers and conformably overlies the Molecap Greensand.  Molecap Greensand (Kcm) is a fine to medium grained marine glauconite sandstone which unconformably overlies the Osborne Formation.  Osborne Formation (Kco) conformably overlies the Triassic Leederville Formation, and is composed of a marine sandstone, shale and interbedded shale-sandstone sequence from base upwards. * Warnbro Group \\\\- Early Cretaceous marine sediments representing a transgression.  Parmelia Formation (J-Kp) forms the topmost hydraulic unit of the Yarragadee Aquifer. It is composed of 100‚Äì200 m thickness of well sorted fluvial sandstone deposited in the latest Jurassic to early Cretaceous. It includes a basal siltstone of lagoonal to lacustrine environment, the Otowiri Siltstone, which acts as an aquitard.  Leederville Formation (Kll) sandstone, siltstone, shale and mudstone deposited in deeper marine environments, with finer sediments predominant in the upper part of the unit. The unit attains a maximum thickness in the axis of the Yanchep Syncline is ~700 m, and thins eastward to approximately 500 m. The Leederville Formation interfingers and merges with the underlying Parmelia Formation in the north of the Perth Basin.  Gage Formation (Kwg) is a shallow lagoonal sandstone and shale deposited in shallow marine beach-dune-lagoonal environments. = Jurassic = * Yarragadee Formation (Jy) is one of the thickest units in the Perth Basin and forms a significant freshwater aquifer. It is composed primarily of non-marine fluviatile feldspathic, poorly sorted sandstones which are porous and poorly cemented, hence allowing for considerable groundwater reserves. The Yarragadee Formation grades from a shale-siltstone dominated base to a cleaner sandstone in the upper portions of the formation, probably representing increased subsidence or filling of the basin during the late Jurassic. * Cadda Formation (Jd) conformably underlies the Yarragadee Formation and is composed primarily of shale and siltstone, with occasional beds of very coarse sandstone. The upper portions of the unit are composed of a marl grading into a marine limestone, representing stable tectonics at this time. * Cattamarra Coal Measures (Jc) are a sequence of non- marine, probably fluviatile sandstones, shales and silts including bituminous coal, and are up to 300 m thick. The Cattamarra Coal Measures conformably overly the Eneabba Formation. * Eneabba Formation (Je) is a lower-Jurassic terrigenous red-bed unit composed of interbedded sandstone with variably coloured limestone. The Eneabba Formation is conformable with the Lesueur Sandstone in the south of the Perth Basin and unconformable with the Kockatea Formation in the north, suggesting it is transgressive. = Triassic = * Kockatea Shale (Trk) * Lesueur Sandstone (Trl) * Woodada Formation (Trw)  Economic geology  Cenozoic sand dune systems are locally being mined for mineral sands, mainly rutile (a source of titanium ) and zircon, by Iluka Resources and other companies. Various formations from Cenozoic to Jurassic age are economically significant freshwater aquifers. Younger aquifers are an important suppliant to reservoir water in the city of Perth and elsewhere. The Yarragadee Formation, one of the thickest formations in the basin, is a very good aquifer in the southern part of the basin. The Perth Basin contains Permian and Jurassic coal measures, the most important being mined primarily for electricity generation in the Collie Sub-basin at Collie in the south-west of the state. The Perth Basin is also prospective for natural gas and oil, with recent exploration wells, including Origin Energy/Arc Energy's Hovea 2, confirming large resources of natural gas, but difficult reservoir geology and characteristics have prevented the full utilisation of these energy reserves. The oil is sourced from the Kockatea Shale. Currently, a junior minerals exploration company is exploring the basin north of Perth for glauconite to produce potash fertilizer.  Regions  Due to its shape and size, the basin has been surveyed and studied in distinctions such as offshore and onshore, north south, and central  See also  * Darling Scarp * South West Seismic Zone  References = Bibliography = * Yarragadee Aquifer Geology report, 115kb pdf  Further reading  * Raine, M.

It is located north-west of Brighton, and is named after Newtimber Place; the parish also includes the hamlet of Saddlescombe. The parish lies almost wholly with the South Downs National Park, with the exception of a small section of the parish north of the B2117 road. The planning authority for Newtimber is therefore the South Downs National Park Authority (SDNPA), the statutory planning authority for the National Park area. The parish covers an area of . At the 2011 Census the population was included in the civil parish of Poynings. Listed Buildings and Scheduled Monuments Newtimber civil parish contains 12 listed buildings. Of these, one is Grade I, one is Grade II* and the remaining 10 buildings are Grade II. The parish contains three scheduled monuments. =Listed buildings= Grade I listed buildings: * Newtimber Place (List Entry Number 1025629), a moated house; the oldest portion was built by the Bellingham family in the 16th century, but the main portion dates from the late 17th century. Grade II* listed buildings: * The Parish Church of St John Evangelist (List Entry Number 1354879), essentially 13th century, though the medieval work has been largely overlaid by restoration work in 1875; the tower was added in 1839. =Scheduled monuments= * Bowl barrow on North Hill (List Entry Number 1014949), a circular mound with a deep central hollow, indicating partial excavation in the past. * Group of three bowl barrows and an Anglo-Saxon mixed cemetery on Summer Down (List Entry Number 1014952), a linear group of three prehistoric barrows and a later Anglo-Saxon cremation and inhumation cemetery. * Cross dyke on Newtimber Hill (List Entry Number 1015717), a roughly north- south aligned cross dyke constructed across a chalk ridge, partly disturbed by flint diggings, tree roots and downland tracks. Saddlescombe Saddlescombe Farm Saddlescombe is a hamlet in the Newtimber parish; it lies on the road from Poynings to Brighton, 5.4 miles (8.7 km) northwest of Brighton. Saddlescombe Farm is a busy little hamlet sitting at the base of the Downs which is owned by the National Trust along with the surrounding countryside. Listed as a working farm since the Domesday Book and having belonged to the Knights Templar for around 100 years Houses of Knights Templar - Preceptory of Saddlescombe  A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 2 (pp. 92)\\\\- there are plenty of historic buildings to explore. The hamlet consists of several threshing barns, large storage barns, a variety of houses, forge, cattle yard and dairy, duck pond, donkey wheel, pig sties, chicken coops and old stables. There is also a very popular organic cafe in one of the courtyards just off the South Downs Way from where you can view the farm and the free range chickens. The farm is open several times a year for open days with group tours and events being organised by the National Trust throughout the year. There is no public parking available within the hamlet, but a free gravel car park can be found on the other side of the road which also leads up to the Devil's Dyke viewpoint - and from where you can catch the 77 bus to and from Brighton Station. Most of the countryside around Saddlescombe is Open Access meaning you can wander freely over the chalkland.

Finlaggan wears a tabard emblazoned with the arms of his employer, the Chief of Clan Donald. A private officer of arms is one of the heralds and pursuivants appointed by great noble houses to handle all heraldic and genealogical questions. History Since the development of heraldry in the Middle Ages and the rise of officers of arms, noble families have appointed heralds and pursuivants to look after the correct marshalling of their coats of arms and research genealogical links. Many noblemen in Britain retained heralds from about 1170 onwards, as did important knights such as Sir John Chandos. The heralds were originally concerned with war and tournaments and identifying people by their arms. As such, they naturally developed an interest in genealogy. Formerly, the Lord of the Isles had Ross Herald and Islay Pursuivant. On the forfeiture of the Lordship these became, and remain, Royal Officers. In 1725, Blanc Coursier Herald was created to serve Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, and the tabard of the office includes Prince Williams differenced arms. Today, most officers of arms are employed by state heraldic authorities. There are, however, some private officers that still exist. Current officers in Scotland The tabard of Blanc Coursier Herald John Anstis created in 1727. In Scotland, there are four private pursuivants of arms that are recognized by the Court of the Lord Lyon King of Arms. These are appointed by clan chiefs to look after matters of clan heraldry and genealogy. The four currently recognized private Scottish pursuivants are listed below: * Slains Pursuivant, appointed by the Chief of the Name and Arms of Hay - currently the Earl of Erroll, Lord High Constable of Scotland * Garioch Pursuivant, appointed by the Chief of the Name and Arms of Mar - currently the Countess of Mar * Endure Pursuivant, appointed by the Chief of the Name and Arms of Lindsay - currently the Earl of Crawford & Balcarres * Finlaggan Pursuivant, appointed by the Chief of the Name and Arms of Macdonald and High Chief of Clan Donald - currently the Lord Macdonald of Slate. This post was revived, after five centuries in August 2005 King of Arms of the Royal House of the Two Sicilies In 10 November 1962 Fernando Mu√±oz Altea was appointed King of Arms of the Royal House of the Two Sicilies by the claimant Prince Ranieri, Duke of Castro, and Head of the Royal House. The Kingdom of Sicily did not have actual heralds (to grant coats of arms and issue certificates of nobility) in recent times, but rather a Commission for Titles of Nobility based in Naples until 1861. This commission concerned itself with administration of certain nobiliary institutions and recognition of titles of nobility. Mu√±oz Altea continues this tradition as a Private Officer of Arms of the Royal House. In addition to his office as King of Arms, Mu√±oz Altea is delegate of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George.

However some may have crossed by resting on Carnac and Garden Islands. The first documented crossing by a swimmer was Gerd Von Dincklage-Schulinburg, on 24 January 1956. This led the Weekend Mail newspaper to hold the first organised race to the island in March later that year, which was completed by four participants.History of the Rottnest Channel Swim The first woman to swim to the island was Lesley Cherriman on 13 April 1969.Regarding Schulinburg, Voigt, and Cherriman The youngest swimmer to compete was Kutraleeswaran from Tamil Nadu, India, who completed the swim at the age of 13 in 1994.Why Kutraleeswaran stopped swimming Despite the modest success of the 1956 event, another organised race to the island would not be held until February 23, 1991, with sixteen solo swimmers and seven teams competing. The success of the swim led to it becoming an annual event. Due to the overwhelming popularity of the race, a ballot has been held since 2006 to limit the number of participants in the competition.

It is one of the two major temples in the city, the other being the Great Temple of the Aten. It is situated next to the King's House and near the Royal Palace, in the central part of the city. Original known as the Hwt-Jtn or Mansion of the Aten, it was probably constructed before the larger Great Temple. Its only contemporary depiction is found in the tomb of Tutu (Amarna Tomb 8). Like the other structures in the city, it was constructed quickly, and hence was easy to dismantle and reuse the material for later construction. It was first excavated in 1931 by the Egypt Exploration Society. Layout The structure was surrounded by a large temenos enclosure wall made of large bricks measuring 37 x 19 x 14.5 cm. The temenos enclosed an area of 127 m by 200 m. On the eastern end the remains of flower beds were found, and an avenue of trees separated it from the surrounding buildings. The main entrance was from the west, through two massive brick pylons. Each pylon had slots for two flag poles. Walls projecting forward from the pylon gateway originally held doors. In the main entrance, a large area of preserved gypsum plaster was found bearing the impressions of blocks and mason's marks. This area of plaster was the base of a later platform with a stepped exterior approach and a ramped interior. The find of a ring bezel bearing the name 'Ankhkheperure' dates this to the reigns of pharaohs Smenkhkare or Neferneferuaten. Smaller entrances, with their own projecting walls, were found on either side of the main pylons. =First court= A ramp of whitewashed mud led down into this area. On either side of this ramp were offering tables of mudbrick and in the centre a large altar of mudbrick. The whole court was paved with mud plaster. This area seems to be the oldest part of the complex, as it overlays clean gravel and its surface underlays the later pylon gateway. This 'Great Altar' was later demolished to ground level and some of its bricks were incorporated into the enlargement of the two altars nearest to the entrance, which may have served as the bases of statues. =Second court= One of the reconstructed papyriform columns in the sanctuary. A second set of pylon gateways with smaller entrances identical to the main entrance lead to this court. Within the pylons were niches for granite stelae. This court had side entrances to the north and south, thought to be private entrances for the king and priests respectively. The southern entrance has a small porters house. Outside this gate was a dump of stone from the destruction of the Sanctuary, like that of the Great Aten Temple. The southern pylon had a small priest's house attached to it. Fragments of a small painted uraeus cornice were found here. =Sanctuary court= The gateway to this court was again flanked by pylons identical to the previous gates. However, there were no additional entrances and no niches for stelae. Trees surround the Sanctuary on the eastern side. The southern half of the court contained a number of buildings. In the southeast corner there was a small brick building that contained a series of rooms including one with a dais. To the northwest of this building was another approached by a ramp which was possibly a subsidiary chapel. To the west of this building was another, consisting of a single room, which was connected to the south wing of the Sanctuary by a series of walls that possibly belonged to a small house. Its walls were thick and well built, and the floor was paved with bricks. =Sanctuary= The outer court of the Sanctuary had projecting wings on either side of the main building. The exterior of these walls were stone and the partitions were of mud brick. A ramp with balustrade led to the first court of the Sanctuary, passing between two thin pylons, and likely continued as a causeway to the altar in the centre. This first court was full of offering tables. The thin gateway to the inner court was flanked by four large columns on each side. It is likely that the life-size limestone statues, fragments of which were found in the dump, once stood in this area. The entrance to the inner court was of the same winding type also seen in the Great Aten Temple. The entire court was filled with offering tables and surrounded by small chapels built into the walls. In 1994, concrete replicas of the papyriform columns were assembled in their original position in front of the inner sanctuary court. These columns were replicas based on the fragments found in the 1931 excavation and were manufactured in Egypt from moulds made in England.

Geography  Kisk≈ër√∂s is the sixth biggest city in B√°cs-Kiskun county by population. It is located in the center of the county, east from the river Danube and south of Budapest. About north of the town lies the nature reserve area (since 1974) of Sz√ºcsi Forest as part of the Kiskuns√°g National Park. The flora includes close to 300 protected plant species, one of them a special species of orchid, which blossoms here in April. Moreover, there are 98 registered, protected bird species. Many of them are songbirds that coexist with birds of prey like kestrels, sparrow-hawks and hobbies. = Climate = Kisk≈ër√∂s has a continental climate combined with a high number of yearly sunlight. The hours of annual sunlight is over 2,000 hours.  History  Kisk≈ër√∂s has been populated since the Stone Age. In the first half of the second millennium before Christ it was populated by the Vatya-culture which was developed around the central area of the Danube basin between 2000 and 1500/1400 BC.http://www.archaeology.wiki/blog/2014/03/14/revealing-the- secrets-of-4000-year-old-settlements-in-hungary/ Archeologists unearthed 161 metal objects - out of them 11 made of gold - in the vicinity of Kisk≈ër√∂s in 2016, representing the biggest ever Middle Bronze Age found - both quantity and quality - in the areas between the Danube and Tisza (in Hungarian: Duna- Tisza k√∂ze).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eTJ0b_qiNAhttp://www.baon.hu/bacs- kiskun/kultura/szenzacios-aranykincsek-a-bronzkorbol-675983/ In addition to bronze and gold jewellery, daggers, spears, axes as well as goldsmith tools were found. Celtic coins from the Late Iron Age (4th century B.C.) have also been found. In the first century Transdanubia (i.e. Pannonia) was invaded by the Romans and its population ran away and settled in the area. Archaeological evidence suggests that Scythian-Sarmatian were settled here, to the border region, to protect the \\"limes\\", who continued to be present up to the 5th century AD. Seven sarmata cemeteries have been found so far within the permiaters of Kisk≈ër√∂s. In the graves of a Jazig-Sarmatian cemetery a necklace of pearls in gold setting and other rare polished jewellery were found.http://www.grunwald.hu/kiskoros/Internat/english.htm In the 1930s five Avar villages and seven cemeteries have been discovered. The archeological findings strongly suggest a strong connection between the Sarmatians living in the area and the Roman provinces. Only a few relics were have been found from the Hun-period (420-454). Nine Avar cemeteries have been dug so far. Their characteristic metal buckles with a griffin fitting are strikingly similar to those found in the Caucasus and along the River Volga. The most beautiful findings of all, a necklace of 5 oval almandine pendants in gold setting and 6 gold pendants were uncovered in a princes's grave.http://www.grunwald.hu/kiskoros/Internat/english.htm The first written documents mentioning Kisk√µr√∂s date back to 1277 issued by the \\"Kuman\\" L√°szl√≥ IV and referred to as \\"Keurus\\". By 1433 K√µr√∂s was an independent town. The peaceful life of the town came to an end in the 16th century when the Turkish army occupied the region. A letter was written on April 11, 1529 by Mih√°ly P√≥sa warning the bishop of Kalocsa about the attacks of the Turks. He informs the bishop that Kisk≈ër√∂s was ruined by the Turks 8 April together with other settlements in the area. The town lceased to exist during the occupation and referred to as \\"puszta\\" (lat. desertum). n 1702 documents show that the area was not fully uninhabited. The rebirth of Kisk√µr√∂s is the work of the Wattay :hu:Wathay csal√°d family. For their contribution to defeat the Turks, Leopold I gave the family the land and the surrounding areas. On May 19, 1718 700 Slovak farmers moved to Kisk√µr√∂s. The population has reached 5,000 by 1785. On January 1, 1823 S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi was born in Kisk√µr√∂s. In the 20th century Hungary lost both world wars and during the years of the Great Depression the economy of the village suffered greatly. Kisk√µr√∂s was occupied by the Soviet Army in 1944. After World War II, most of the income came from agriculture (wine and fruit production).

He represents sensation, and his female counterpart is Enion, who represents sexual urges. He is connected to the God the Father aspect of the Christian Trinity and is the begetter of Los. Tharmas is mostly peaceful, and flees during most of his fights with Urizen. He is depicted in various ways ranging from a youth with wings to an old bearded man. An illustration of the relationship of the Four Zoas from one of Blake's other works: Milton a Poem Character Tharmas is both the last Zoas described but also the first in the number. His aspect as a Zoas is Sensation. As connected to the Trinity, Tharmas is seen as God the Father. As a body part, he is the loins with his Emanation/mate Enion representing sexual urges. He is also represented as a shepherd. Tharmas is connected to the direction point West and his fallen state is to mark the Circumference of the world. His elemental connection is to water and, in turn, to time. His artistic aspect is Painting and his particular sense is Tongue, which represents taste and speech. He represents both free speech but also false speech. In his divine state, Tharmas is peaceful and idyllic. However, during the war among the Zoas, he fights until he is defeated and falls. His name is possibly a back formation from their daughter's name, Enitharmon.Damon 1988 pp. 399, 401 Tharmas is the unifier of the Four Zoas. When Tharmas vanishes, he is replaced by chaotic nature.Bloom 1993 p. 32 As connected to the body and sensation, his fallen state's separation from Enion/sex causes him to turn into the spectre Eternal Death. Through Enion, he creates poetic instinct along with the children forms of Urthona/Los and Enitharmon.Damon 1988 p. 399 When separated from Enion, she creates the \\"Circle of Destiny\\", and, with it, the Gate of the tongue, which Tharmas is connected to, was closed.Bloom 1993 p. 83 He is at conflict with himself, and through the conflict he becomes human. This caused him to hate, and he feels thwarted by being unable to have sex. He seeks out Urthona/Los and Enitharmon to redeem the universe, but Los refuses and Tharmas separates Urthona/Los and Enitharmon, which causes Urthona to become the spectre Los. However, he soon reunites them. Tharmas battles against Urizen, but normally ends up fleeing. During the Last Judgment, Tharmas and Enion are seen as two children and are able to experience an idealistic sexual relationship. They are also able to assume their divine forms and Tharmas awakens both Los the Eternal Prophet and Albion the Eternal Man. They join in with the harvest after the Final Judgment.Damon 1988 pp. 399‚Äì400 Appearances As part of Blake's later myth, Tharmas appears in Milton with a description of Tharmas relationship with Los and the building of Golgonooza. Tharmas creates the foundation but leaves as Los sets about rebuilding the universe. The Four Zoas describes Tharmas's disputes with Urizen and Tharmas constant fleeing from various fights. The work also reveals his origins along with his role within the Last Judgment. Jerusalem defines other aspects of Tharmas, including his connection to the tongue and speech. Tharmas also assumes many forms in Blake's various designs and illustrations. He is depicted in the designs as a young, winged man that lies near the Sea of Time and Space. He is in despair. The designs depicting him in Jerusalem show a bearded man that is shaping the circumference of a sphere while Enion is chasing after the young Los and Enitharmon. In the \\"Circle of Life\\" design, he is young and without a beard, and, in Blake's illustrations of Genesis, he has the head of an ox.Damon 1988 pp. 399‚Äì401 NotesReferences * Bloom, Harold.

He represents love, passion, and rebellious energy. His Emanation (female counterpart) is Vala; his fallen form is Orc. Throughout Blake's mythological system, he is opposed to Urizen, the representation of reason. He is also connected to Jesus, who takes upon his form as the being of love after Luvah falls and turns to a being of hate. An illustration of the relationship of the Four Zoas from one of Blake's works, Milton a Poem Character Luvah represents a generative aspect that is connected to experience.Bloom 1993 p. 49 In Blake's system, Luvah, the third Zoa, represents emotion as the Prince of Love, and his name may be connected to the word \\"lover\\". Love is the supreme emotion, and it is connected to all others, including hate. Luvah is connected to the heart. He is connected to Jesus, and the Incarnation is the result of Luvah transforming into hate; Jesus replaced Luvah's physical form after Luvah descended from his position. As such, Jesus is the physical aspect of Love and he suffers what Luvah would suffer. When Urizen witnesses Jesus in that form, he becomes upset and afraid of the new Luvah.Damon 1988 p. 255 Luvah's emanation, Vala, originated as two innocent individuals that were separated by Vala being impregnated by Albion. From that union, Urizen was created. When the Fallen Man looked upon Vala, she was separated from Luvah, and she hid from him. Urizen joins with Luvah in order to control mankind, with Urizen seeking to dominate the imagination and would allow Luvah to dominate reason. However, Luvah does not accept but does steal Urizen's horses, which sparks a war between the two. During this time, Urthona falls and divides. Urizen soon withdraws from the war, and Tharmas strikes down both Luvah and Vala, which causes them to both fall. As this happens, Albion is brought low, and Urizen becomes the ruler. Urizen punishes Luvah by placing him within the Furnaces of Affliction, with Vala feeding the furnaces. The furnaces causes Luvah to melt, and Urizen uses the metallic remains of Luvah to create the universe, which represents reason's solidification of emotions. This leads to Luvah, in the form of a cloud, constantly tormenting Albion, which represents suppressed desires. Albion opposes Luvah, and he falls. Soon, he is born from Enitharmon in the form of Orc. Thus, he transitions from Love into Hate. From him comes wars, including the Napoleonic Wars, and he stars wrecking the body of Albion.Damon 1988 pp. 255‚Äì257 After Orc is born, the jealous Los uses the Chains of Jealousy to bind Orc upon a mountain. While bound, his imagination is able to exist in a cave located in Urizen's kingdom, which wakes up Urizen. When Urizen seeks out Orc, Orc is freed as he changes into a serpent. The form is corrupted and he is turned into a satanic image. Orc spends his time rebelling against Orc, and it is only when Urizen stops fighting Orc that Orc is able to become Luvah.Damon 1988 pp. 309‚Äì310 After the Final Judgment, Albion makes Luvah the servant of Urizen, which represents reason controlling love and ensuring that there is only creation. Albion tells Urizen to let Luvah rage enough to allow for the hate to burn out. Luvah's role in the harvest, he is a singer and is able to unite with Vala before joining Albion only to be cast away until the Zoas can all join with Albion.Damon 1988 pp. 255, 257 Appearances The first appearance of Luvah is in The Book of Thel, but he is not mentioned again until Vala, or The Four Zoas. The history of Luvah's origins, war on Albion, and his involvement as Orc are described in Vala along with descriptions of his return to his Luvah state after the Final Judgment. Blake's Milton a Poem describes various aspects of Luvah's story, including his tomb at Golgonooza where the dead Luvah resided. In Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion, Luvah is connected with the various warring individuals through Los's dividing of the world of life and death. The work also explains how Jesus allowed for Luvah to fight against Albion, as Luvah's hate must be expressed before it can be purged. NotesReferences * Damon, S. Foster. A Blake Dictionary.

Specifically, he is the Zoa of inspiration and creativity, and he is a blacksmith god. His female counterpart is Enitharmon. Urthona usually appears in his \\"fallen\\" form, that of Los. Character Urthona (likely intended to imply \\"earth owner\\") is one of the Four Zoas and represents both the north and imagination within the individual. He is aligned with the Christian Trinity in the aspect of the Holy Ghost and is opposed to Urizen, the Zoa of reason. He is the last to be created, and his corresponding element is Earth. In his eternal form, he is portrayed as a blacksmith, working in his forge in Golgonooza. In terms of senses, he is represented by the ear, in terms of art he is represented by poetry, and in his fallen form, his profession is religion. He and Luvah are the guardians of the gates of heaven. Unlike the other Zoas, he does not have a direct Emanation counterpart; instead, Enitharmon is usually described as an emanation from Urthona's fallen state, Los.Damon 1988 p. 426 In his original state, Urthona represents the loins of the body. As a blacksmith, Urthona is connected to the animal the Mole, which is symbolic of mining aspects.Bloom 1993 pp. 32, 49 Urthona rarely appears directly in Blake's work, usually taking the form of Los, who plays a prominent role in the fall and redemption of mankind, most notably described in Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion. His place within the fall is as a blacksmith who prepares the items for divine farming, and he is able to realize the problems of the Eternals struggling against each other.Bloom 1993 pp. 83‚Äì84 When Luvah and Urizen went to war over the state of mankind (Albion), Urthona was split from Los, a Spectre of his form, and he became a serpent. The Urthona form joined with the unconscious mind called Nadir. He has four aspects in the fallen world, with Los being Urthona's aspect of humanity, Enitharmon as the Emanation connected to Los, a Spectre form, and a Shadow form. When Los dies (entering the \\"Void outside of Existence\\") and destroys both the sun and the moon, Urthona is reborn but then disappears. At the time of the Last Judgment and the feast in heaven, Urthona is already present when the others arrive. He is subsequently connected to the god Vulcan, and he is the miller during the harvest before he becomes the baker of the \\"Bread of Ages\\". In the end, he is united with all of his aspects.Damon 1988 pp. 426‚Äì427 Appearances Urthona appears on his own in many works. An early mention of Urthona comes in \\"A Song of Liberty\\" that describes how Urizen is buried underneath Urthona's realm. In America a Prophecy, the figure of the Shadowy Female is described as one of his daughters and Orc, as a serpent, is wrapped around Urthona's pillars. In Europe a Prophecy, Los describes that Urthona is resting while Urizen is free from his chains. During most of the poem, Los is not present while Enitharmon dominates the world.Damon 1988 p. 427 Urthona's background and origins are described in Vala, or The Four Zoas. The work describes the relationship between Los and Urthona and how the Emanations of Urthona and Los operate. It also describes his regeneration at the Final Judgment. Blake's poem Milton a Poem describes aspects of Urthona, such as his connection to the North and to Poetry. The work also describes Urthona as dark. In Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion, Blake explains how Urthona is divided within the world and elaborates on other aspects of his history. NotesReferences * Bloom, Harold.

Naval career Brownrigg began his naval career as a Midshipman in 1919. He progressed through the ranks, becoming a Lieutenant in 1923 and a Captain in 1942. He saw service on numerous ships, including pre-war stints on the flotilla leader HMS Montrose, the aircraft carrier , and the light cruiser HMS Cairo.Houterman, Hans and Koppes, Jeroen Unithistories.com Netherlands (undated), accessed 27 November 2008. =World War II= During the Second World War, Brownrigg served on the battleship HMS Warspite as Navigating Officer before taking a staff position under Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham in the planning department of the Naval Expeditionary Force, preparing for D-Day. He then became commanding officer of HMS Scylla for D-Day itself, whilst also serving as Flag Captain for the Eastern Task Force during the landings. He finished the war in command of the Royal Navy Air Station at Rattray. =Post-war= After the war, Brownrigg served briefly on HMS Theseus before taking a series of land- based naval positions. He served as Director of Plans for the Admiralty, Chief of Staff to the Commander-in-Chief for the Mediterranean and finally, in 1952, being briefly Naval Aide de Camp to the Queen. Nevertheless, he had made enemies within the Admiralty due to his idiosyncratic nature and failed to progress beyond the rank of Captain. He was placed on the retired list in July 1952. Bracknell New Town Following his retirement from the navy, Brownrigg became General Manager of the Bracknell New Town Development Corporation.Henry, Brian (Ed.) British Television Advertising: The First Thirty Years London: Century Benham 1986 With his experience in planning for Operation Overlord, he was considered the ideal choice for implementing the development of a New Town as envisaged by Patrick Abercrombie and Lord Reith in their eponymous reports. Associated-Rediffusion The experience of managing Bracknell was put to use in Brownrigg's next post, the one where he would, his war service notwithstanding, gain the most fame. The Television Act 1954 had created the framework for commercial broadcasting in the United Kingdom.Graham, Russ J Vital vulgarity , The Authority from Transdiffusion 1 April 2005, accessed 27 November 2008 British Electric Traction's Broadcast Relay Services subsidiary and Associated Newspapers formed a joint company, Associated-Rediffusion (A-R), to bid for a commercial television contract.Graham, Russ J A Short History , Television House from Transdiffusion 1 January 2004, accessed 27 November 2008 Because of the extensive planning and construction involved, they approached Brownrigg to become their General Manager.

At the same time, he was also actively involved in defining the station's identity, formulating the programme plans, creating an advertising market for television, chairing ITN and negotiating industrial relations with the film and broadcasting unions.

However, personal friends also point out that he had a great sense of humour and an ability to laugh at himself \\\\- many of the anecdotes about him may therefore have derived from him in the first place. =Retirement= Brownrigg's A-R pitched itself as a formal, rigid broadcaster. In order to avoid comparison between A-R and the American networks, Brownrigg ensured that A-R was more \\"British\\" and \\"Empire\\" in its attitudes and identity than even the BBC. This had the desired effect, removing the accusation the commercial television would be \\"vulgar\\" or too light.Rediffusion , Ident from Transdiffusion 24 May 2004, accessed 27 November 2008 However, by the 1960s, increased competition and a change in spending-power demographics was evident in the United Kingdom. With the planned launch of BBC-2, aimed at the young and the upper middle-class, the new pirate offshore radio stations and a rejuvenated Radio Luxembourg, the senior management of the company felt that the future lay in younger viewers. To counter the competition, they decided to relaunch the station as Rediffusion, London and introduce new programming aimed at younger people and a new identity designed to be less \\"stuffy\\" and more able to compete with BBC-2.Graham, Russ J 1964 and all that , Inside TV from Transdiffusion, accessed 27 November 2008 In this new environment there was no place for Brownrigg and he retired to Finchampstead in Berkshire at the end of 1963, although he took on a directorship of the TV Times. One of his last acts before his death was to condemn the Independent Television Authority for forcing Rediffusion into (minority) partnership with ABC Weekend TV to create the new Thames Television.

The \\"Escapees' Medal\\" was established by a 1926 law, intended to honour combatants not only of the First World War, but also of the Franco- Prussian War of 1870. Its statute was later amended to include combatants of the Second World War and later conflicts. Award statute The award criteria for the Franco-Prussian War was established by law on 2 October 1926 and read as follows: * To French soldiers serving during the Franco-Prussian War, who successfully escaped their internment in Germany. The award criteria for the First World War were established by decree on 7 April 1927 and read as follows: * To French soldiers serving during the First World War, who were taken prisoner during combat either in Europe or in an external theatre of operations, and who successfully escaped, regardless of the length of their internment; * To citizens of Alsace-Lorraine, who, between 2 August 1914 and 1 November 1918, deserted from the German army. * To civilians interned in Germany, or living in territories occupied by the enemy, who crossed enemy lines with the intent of making themselves available to the French military authority. The award criteria for the Second World War were long in coming. A decree of 7 February 1959 allowed for award of the medal, followed by an Order on 20 May 1959 and detailed instructions on 10 July 1959. The medal was bestowed to persons able to prove a successful escape: * From a prisoner of war camp; * From a place of internment where they were being held for acts related to the resistance; * From enemy held or controlled territory, an escape including the clandestine crossing of a front line or customs checkpoint; To persons able to prove: * Two escape attempts followed by disciplinary measures; * A single escape attempt resulting in a transfer to a punitive establishment or by deportation measures recognised for the award of the Croix du combattant volontaire de la R√©sistance; * To citizens of Alsace- Lorraine forcibly incorporated into the German armed forces, who deserted in order to serve in the resistance or in the allied armies; * To citizens of Alsace-Lorraine who escaped from their provinces in order to fight the enemy; These actions are only considered for bestowal of the medal if they occurred between 2 September 1939 and 15 August 1945. The medal can be awarded to both French citizens and foreign nationals serving in the ranks of the French armed forces. Civilians and members of the military killed, or who have died as a result of wounds received during an escape attempt, are automatically awarded the medal. A decree of 28 December 1981 states that \\"any person eligible for the \\"Escapees' Medal\\" is asked to put forward a request\\". There is only one military unit that has been awarded the medal, the 2nd Dragoon Regiment, which received it in 1945, after the entire regiment decided to escape the German occupation of Vichy France (Case Anton) in November 1942. Some members of the regiment went into the resistance, and others joined the Free French in Africa; one officer eventually reached Algiers still carrying the regimental standard. A survivor of the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, Joseph Weismann, was awarded the Escapees' Medal in 2014 even though he did not meet the criteria set out in the 1959 decree. At the age of 11, Weismann had escaped from Beaune-la- Rolande transit camp, where the French authorities interned Jews who were to be sent to Auschwitz concentration camp. Weismann had been applying for the Escapees' Medal over a period of about 15 years before the French government finally awarded it to him. Award description The Escapees' Medal is a 30 mm in diameter circular medal struck from bronze. Its design is from the French engraver A. Dubois. Its obverse bears the relief left profile bust of Marianne (representing the French Republic) crowned with branches of oak, along the outer circumference, the relief inscription () \\"FRENCH REPUBLIC\\". On its reverse, at center, the relief inscription on three rows () (ESCAPEES' MEDAL) surrounded by a wreath of oak branches. The medal is suspended by a ring through the suspension loop to a 36 mm wide green silk moir√© ribbon with a 7 mm wide central orange stripe and 2 mm wide longitudinal orange stripes located 2 mm from the ribbon's outer edges.

The earliest known use of this term is by R.G.G. Cattell in his PhD thesisCattell, R. G. G. ‚ÄúFormalization and Automatic Derivation of Code Generators‚Äù. PhD thesis, 1978. Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA on automatic derivation of code generators for compilers. Application For instance, the lexical syntax of many programming languages requires that tokens be built from the maximum possible number of characters from the input stream. This is done to resolve the problem of inherent ambiguity in commonly used regular expressions such as \`[a-z]+\` (one or more lower-case letters).Aho et al., 168. The term is also used in compilers in the instruction selection stage to describe a method of \\"tiling\\" ‚Äî determining how a structured tree representing a program in an intermediate language should be converted into linear machine code. An entire subtree might be converted into just one machine instruction, and the problem is how to split the tree into non-overlapping \\"tiles,\\" each representing one machine instruction. An effective strategy is simply to make a tile of the largest subtree possible at any given point, which is called \\"maximal munch.\\"Page, 470. Drawbacks In some situations, \\"maximal munch\\" leads to undesirable or unintuitive outcomes. For instance, in the C programming language, the statement \`x=y/*z;\` (without any whitespace) will probably lead to a syntax error, since the \`/*\` character sequence initiates a (unintended) comment that is either unterminated or terminated by the end token \`*/\` of some later, unrelated actual comment (comments in C do not nest). What was actually meant in the statement was to assign to the variable \`x\` the result of dividing the value in \`y\` by the value obtained by dereferencing pointer \`z\`; this would be perfectly valid (though not very common) code. It can be stated by making use of whitespace, or using \`x=y/(*z);\`. Another example, in C++, uses the \\"angle bracket\\" characters \`<\` and \`>\` in the syntax for template specialization, but two consecutive \`>\` characters are interpreted as the right-shift operator \`>>\`.Vandevoorde. Prior to C++11, the following code would produce a parse error, because the right-shift operator token is encountered instead of two right-angle-bracket tokens: std::vector> my_mat_11; //Incorrect in C++03, correct in C++11. std::vector > my_mat_03; //Correct in either C++03 or C++11. The C++11 standard adopted in August 2011 amended the grammar so that a right-shift token is accepted as synonymous with a pair of right-angle brackets (as in Java), which complicates the grammar but allows the continued use of the maximal munch principle. Alternatives Programming languages researchers have also responded by replacing or supplementing the principle of maximal munch with other lexical disambiguation tactics. One approach is to utilize \\"follow restrictions,\\" which instead of directly taking the longest match will put some restrictions on what characters can follow a valid match. For example, stipulating that strings matching \`[a-z]+\` cannot be followed by an alphabetic character achieves the same effect as maximal munch with that regular expression.Van den Brand et al., 26. Another approach is to keep the principle of maximal munch but make it subordinate to some other principle, such as context (e.g., the right-shift token in Java would not be matched in the context of a generics expression, where it is syntactically invalid).Van Wyk et al., 63.

The population of the civil parish as of the 2011 census was 6,505. It is in the North East Derbyshire district. The A6175 road from the M1 motorway to the A61 road runs through the village. The village contains the former hamlets of Hepthorne Lane, Hillyfields, Highfields and Church Hill. The Hepthorne Lane area is still called by its name by local residents, as are the Highfields and Church Hill areas. The River Rother flows through the village at the bottom of Hepthorne Lane, next to the Midland Main Line. Brief history St Lawrence's Church, North Wingfield During the Domesday Survey in 1086 the manor of North Wingfield was recorded as Winnefelt. It was noted that there was a church and a priest. Parts of the current church, dedicated to St. Lawrence, date from the Norman era, with some features being Anglo-Saxon in origin. At that time the manor of North Wingfield was in the possession of Walter De Ayncourt. The name eventually became shortened to Deincourt, which was used by the village's secondary school, Deincourt Community School from 1953 until it closed in 2010. Both North Wingfield and South Wingfield have forms of the same place-name, formed from \\"winn\\" (pasture) and \\"feld\\" (open land). The earlier forms of each are not distinguished but in 1284 a Middle English form of South Wingfield occurs. (North) Wingfield is found in Anglo-Saxon records, while the records of (South) Wingfield begin with the Domesday Book.Ekwall, Eilert (1940). The Concise Dictionary of English Place-names; 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press. p. 499 The village Located in the former coalfields, the village was served by several collieries for most of its recent history. Now, partly due to its location near to the M1 motorway and its school, the village has experienced an influx of residents in recent years, and many housing developments have taken place. The village now only has an Primary school, following the closure of Deincourt Community School. Schools There was a secondary school in North Wingfield ‚Äì Deincourt Community School - from 1953 to 2010. In November 2007, Ofsted placed Deincourt Community School under 'special measures', due to inspectors' concerns about falling standards at the school. This gave Derbyshire County Council the opportunity to implement plans to close the school, which, with only 473 students at that time, they felt to be too small to be viable. The proposal was to transfer the students to Tibshelf School, which would be re-built on a new larger site under the Building Schools for the Future scheme. This school building scheme was scrapped by Educational Minister Michael Gove when a Conservative-led coalition Government was elected in 2010. Between 2008 and 2010, Deincourt School was in a ‚Äòfederation', that is to say a loose merger, with Tibshelf School. Despite the cancellation of the Building Schools for the Future Scheme, and the fact that in its 2009 Inspection report the school was rated as a ‚ÄòGood‚Äô School, the process of closing the school was continued. The school therefore closed in July 2010, and was integrated into Tibshelf School. Because of the lack of space at Tibshelf School, students continued to be taught at the Deincourt Site in North Wingfield until June 2012. Because of the overcrowding caused by the merger with the already overcrowded Tibshelf school, Derbyshire County Council itself funded a new build school in Tibshelf, which opened in November 2013. North Wingfield Primary School was founded in Victorian times; it was formerly an infant and junior school on a split site. The original Victorian building has now been demolished and a new school has been built on the old Deincourt site. Neighbouring settlements Neighbouring settlements are Tupton, Grassmoor, Holmewood, Pilsley, Danesmoor and Clay Cross. North Wingfield is quite a distance away from its counterpart South Wingfield, which is around 11 miles southwards.

He was the first representative of East Lothian in the parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain. He continued to hold that seat in all successive parliaments until 1741. He was one of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. Cockburn built Ormiston Hall on his estate at Ormiston. This last Cockburn of Ormiston was an enthusiastic entrepreneur and eventually ruined himself as a result of which his estates were sold to the Earl of Hopetoun.

He attended the Hebrew Reali School in Haifa, and attended military boarding school while in high school. In 1973, his brother Eran, a soldier in the IDF Armored Corps, was killed in action during the Yom Kippur War. Almog married Didi Frida in 1978, and they had three children: Nitzan, Eran, and Shoham. His son Eran, who was named after his brother, was born with brain damage, and suffered from severe autism and mental retardation. He died at age 23 in 2007.http://www.jpost.com/Not-Just-News/Always-lead-378772 His daughter Shoham was born with a severe injury to an artery in her heart, and died a month after her birth in 1991. Almog founded Aleh Negev, a village for the disabled which provides residential, medical and social services to the handicapped of southern Israel. After Eran's death, Aleh Negev's name was changed to Nachalat Eran. Five members of the Almog family from Haifa: Ze'ev Almog, 71, his wife Ruth, 70, their son Moshe, 43, and grandsons Tomer Almog, 9, and Assaf Staier, 11 were killed in the suicide bombing of Maxim restaurant in Haifa on October 4, 2003, while Oren Almog, 10, was grievously injured and blinded. Almog lives in Ness Ziona. Military career Almog (right), then head of the IDF Southern Command, with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Almog was drafted into the IDF in 1969. He volunteered as a paratrooper in the Paratroopers Brigade, and fought as a soldier and as a squad leader during the War of Attrition. His first action was Operation Rhodes.BaMahane: The 30th General Staff, 06.05.1999 In 1971 he became an infantry officer after completing Officer Candidate School. In February 1973, he participated in Operation Hood 54-55, an Israeli raid into Lebanon to destroy Fatah targets. Almog fought in the Yom Kippur War as a company commander at the 202 paratroop battalion on the Sinai front. Later on he commanded the 35th Paratroopers Brigade's Reconnaissance company. Almog led a force of officers and soldiers from the company in Operation Entebbe, and was the first soldier to land on the runway at Entebbe, marking and securing it for incoming Israeli airplanes, then leading the capture of the airfield's control tower in the rescue operation.Doron Almog, The Israeli spirit: 35 years since Entebbe, Israel Hayom, July 4, 2011. In the 1982 Lebanon War he led the 35th paratroopers Brigade's reconnaissance battalion during heavy fighting against PLO operatives and the Syrian Army.Gal Perl Finkel, Win the close fight, The Jerusalem Post, March 21, 2017. In 1984-1985 he commanded Shaldag Unit in the clandestine airlift of 7,000 endangered Beta Israel (or \\"Falasha\\") Jews from Ethiopia to Israel in what was known as \\"Operation Moses\\" and in special operations in Lebanon. Later on he commanded the 35th paratroopers Brigade in counter-guerrilla operations in the South Lebanon conflict. In his most recent post, as head of the IDF Southern Command from 2000-2003 he secured the border of the Gaza Strip against infiltration by Palestinian militants. Controversy On September 10, 2005, as Almog and his wife arrived in London on an El Al flight to do fundraising for Aleh, a handicapped services organization which he helped found, Almog was informed by the Israeli Embassy that a warrant had been issued for his arrest on suspicion of violating the 1949 Geneva Convention in connection with home destructions in Gaza. The warrant was issued by Chief London Magistrate Timothy Workman of the Bow Street Magistrates' Court. The petition had been filed by Daniel Machover and Kate Maynard, attorneys for the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights. http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3143122,00.html Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism officers were stationed at the immigration desk. Almog was to be arrested when he presented himself but the Israeli military attache advised him to stay on the plane and return to Israel. Almog and his wife remained on the plane for two hours before it took off for Ben Gurion Airport. It later emerged that the senior counter-terrorism officer in charge of the operation had feared for public safety and the diplomatic impact of confronting El Al sky marshals and Almog's bodyguards. A second concern was the legal implications of boarding the plane after El Al had refused police entry.cle3396137.ece Israeli general escaped UK arrest because police feared airport gunfightReport: IDF general dodged U.K. arrest as police feared shootoutTerror police feared gun battle with Israeli generalIsraeli general escaped arrest at Heathrow ‚Äòbecause police feared gunfight‚Äô British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw apologized to his Israeli counterpart over the incident and said that the warrant has been withdrawn.

Israel Prize Almog was awarded the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement in 2016. The Israel Prize is awarded by the State of Israel and is generally regarded as the state's highest honor. It is presented annually, on Israeli Independence Day, in a state ceremony in Jerusalem, in the presence of the President, the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the Knesset (Israel's legislature), and the Supreme Court President. When Almog accepted his prize, members of the audience rose to their feet to applaud him. Almog spoke of his work as founder of a rehabilitation village for disabled children, named in honor of his son, Eran, who died in 2007. He noted, \\"\\"in Eran's name and the name of his friends who didn't know what independence is, I ask that this ceremony be the beginning of a journey for tikkun olam (repairing the world), making Israeli society a more patient, more inclusive society.

A positive matrix is a matrix in which all the elements are strictly greater than zero. The set of positive matrices is a subset of all non-negative matrices. While such matrices are commonly found, the term is only occasionally used due to the possible confusion with positive-definite matrices, which are different. A matrix which is both non- negative and is positive semidefinite is called a doubly non-negative matrix. A rectangular non-negative matrix can be approximated by a decomposition with two other non-negative matrices via non-negative matrix factorization. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of square positive matrices are described by the Perron‚ÄìFrobenius theorem.  Inversion  The inverse of any non-singular M-matrix is a non-negative matrix. If the non-singular M-matrix is also symmetric then it is called a Stieltjes matrix. The inverse of a non-negative matrix is usually not non-negative. The exception is the non-negative monomial matrices: a non-negative matrix has non-negative inverse if and only if it is a (non-negative) monomial matrix. Note that thus the inverse of a positive matrix is not positive or even non-negative, as positive matrices are not monomial, for dimension n > 1.  Specializations  There are a number of groups of matrices that form specializations of non-negative matrices, e.g. stochastic matrix; doubly stochastic matrix; symmetric non-negative matrix.

Life and career Before coming to Hollywood, he worked in New York for fashion entrepreneur Hattie Carnegie, where the clientele included Joan Cohn, the wife of Columbia Pictures studio chief Harry Cohn. He worked as head designer for Columbia Pictures from 1944 to 1960. His most famous works include Rita Hayworth's black satin strapless dress from Gilda (1946), Marlene Dietrich's celebrated beaded souffle stagewear for her cabaret world tours, as well as the sheer, sparkling gown that Marilyn Monroe wore when she sang \\"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\\" to John F. Kennedy in 1962. The dress was so tight that he is believed to have actually sewn it while Monroe was wearing it. The idea of dresses being a nude color, with crystals coating it, stunned audiences. It gave the members of the audience the illusion that Monroe was nude, except for discretely placed rhinestones covering them head to toe. Louis had originally designed a version of the dress for Marlene Dietrich, who wore it in her concert shows. An impressed Monroe asked Dietrich about it, who told her how the dress's illusion worked, and sent her to Louis to design a similar dress for her Kennedy appearance. While Dietrich had been seen wearing her version before Monroe, the press coverage surrounding Monroe's appearance at Madison Square Garden in her style of gown swept the globe. This robe became‚Äîbesides the white one from \\"The Seven Year Itch\\"‚ÄîMarilyn Monroe's most famous robe, selling at auction in 2016 for 4.8 million dollars. In 1993, four years after the death of his second wife, Louis married former client Loretta Young; they remained married until his death in 1997. He had designed Young's wardrobe for her TV program The Loretta Young Show (1953‚Äì61), an anthology show noted for Young's show-opening and closing scenes that had viewers tuning in especially to view her high-fashion outfit for that week. Young was known as the best- dressed actress in America at that time. For over forty years, Louis designed clothes for almost every star in Hollywood. Around sixty of his designs appeared in movies, and he was eventually nominated for 13 Academy Awards. Some of his clients included Ginger Rogers, Irene Dunne, Lana Turner, Vivien Leigh, Joan Crawford, Julie Andrews, Katharine Hepburn, and Judy Garland. Some of his film credits included, A Star Is Born, Ship of Fools, From Here to Eternity, Thoroughly Modern Millie, and he won an Oscar for his designs in The Solid Gold Cadillac in 1956. In 1937, a year after Louis immigrated to the United States, he designed a suit that became an icon in the fashion world. The Carnegie suit was one of the first fashions to become very well-liked as an American name design. The fitted blazer and long pencil skirt was worn by several actresses and society women at the time. The Duchess of Windsor became one of his most famous clients, as well as the First Lady Nancy Reagan in the 1980s.

The palace was an act of charity by the spiritual leader of the Nizari Ismaili Muslims, who wanted to help the poor in the neighbouring areas of Pune, who were drastically hit by famine. The Aga Khan Palace is a majestic building. The palace is closely linked to the Indian freedom movement as it served as a prison for Mahatma Gandhi, his wife Kasturba Gandhi, his secretary Mahadev Desai and Sarojini Naidu. It is also the place where Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadev Desai died. In 2003, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) declared the site as a monument of national importance. Aga Khan Palace was major attraction of photographers for various kind of photo shoot because of its special architecture, greenery and perfect for photography lighting, but as commercialization of photography increased nuisance to visitor and tourists, management had stopped allowing any kind of photography within its premises. Even mobile photography is prohibited within the area of Aga Khan Palace. History Historically, the palace holds great significance. Mahatma Gandhi, his wife Kasturba Gandhi and his secretary Mahadev Desai were interned in the palace from 9 August 1942 to 6 May 1944, following the launch of Quit India Movement. Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadev Desai died during their captivity period in the palace and have their Samadhis located over there. Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi have their memorials located in the same complex, near Mula river. Legend goes that the Sultan built the palace to provide employment to the famine ‚Äì struck villagers of the surrounding region; so he employed 1000 people, and the palace was constructed in five years. It was built in Rs 12 lakhs. The total area is 13 acres and built up palace covers seven acres, and the rest is a well maintained garden. The palace housed National Model School until early 1970s. In 1969, Aga Khan Palace was donated to the Indian people by Aga Khan IV as a mark of respect to Gandhi and his philosophy. Today the palace houses a memorial on Gandhi where his ashes were kept. The then prime minister Indira Gandhi had visited the place in 1974 where she allotted a sum of every year, for its maintenance. The amount rose to till the 1990s, after which the national monument of India, was neglected for many years due to improper allocation of funds. There was a protest held at the statue of Mahatma Gandhi near Pune railway station in July 1999 to protest against the worsening condition of the monument. The present condition has improved quite a lot. Significance Aga Khan palace has Italian arches and spacious lawns. The building comprises five halls. It covers an area of , out of which is the built up area. The palace captivates the eye of a spectator with its magnificence and picturesque architecture. It took 5 years and an estimated budget of to complete this Palace. The area of the ground floor is 1756 m, that of the first floor is 1080 m, whereas the second floor has a construction of 445 m. The speciality of this structure is its corridor of 2.5 meters around the entire building. Prince Karim Aga Khan donated this palace to Gandhi Smarak Samittee in 1972 and since then Parks and Gardens organisation is maintaining it.

It is a linear tetrapyrrole compound that, along with the related colorless compound urobilinogen, are degradation products of the cyclic tetrapyrrole heme. Metabolism Urobilin is generated from the degradation of heme, which is first degraded through biliverdin to bilirubin. Bilirubin is then excreted as bile, which is further degraded by microbes present in the large intestine to urobilinogen. Some of this remains in the large intestine, and its conversion to stercobilin gives feces its brown color. Some is reabsorbed into the bloodstream and then delivered to kidney. When urobilinogen is exposed to air, it is oxidized to urobilin, giving urine its yellow color. Importance Many urine tests (urinalysis) monitor the amount of urobilin in urine, as its levels can give insight on the effectiveness of urinary tract function. Normally, urine would appear as either light yellow or colorless. A lack of water intake, for example following sleep or dehydration, reduces the water content of urine, thereby concentrating urobilin and producing a darker color of urine. Obstructive jaundice reduces biliary bilirubin excretion, which is then excreted directly from the blood stream into the urine, giving a dark-colored urine but with a paradoxically low urobilin concentration, no urobilinogen, and usually with correspondingly pale faeces. Darker urine can also be due to other chemicals, such as various ingested dietary components or drugs, porphyrins in patients with porphyria, and homogentisate in patients with alkaptonuria.

The cover of Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists in the Oxford World's Classics series. Oxford World's Classics is an imprint of Oxford University Press. First established in 1901 by Grant Richards and purchased by OUP in 1906, this imprint publishes primarily dramatic and classic literature for students and the general public. Its competitors include Penguin Classics, Everyman's Library, and the Modern Library. Most titles include critical apparatus ‚Äì usually, an introduction, bibliography, chronology, and explanatory notes ‚Äì as is the case with Penguin Classics. History=Grant Richards= The World's Classics imprint was created by London publisher Grant Richards in 1901. Richards had an \\"ambitious publishing programme\\", and this ambition led to the liquidation of Grant Richards in 1905. Henry Frowde, manager of the Oxford University Press, purchased the series in October 1905. The Oxford World's Classics were classed as \\"the most famous works of the English Language\\"Dust Jacket Leaflet (Robbery Under Arms (1949) Oxford University Press: London). and many volumes contained introductions by distinguished authors, such as T. S. Eliot and Virginia Woolf, among others.Oxford World's Classics blurb The books were marketed as a cheap and accessible series for the general public to read some of the greatest works of literature: :‚ÄúCheaply and in little shelf space, the general reader can build up a library of those books, which, having become part of himself, he wishes now to make a part of his home.‚ÄùDust Jacket Leaflet (Rolf, Boldrewood (1949) Robbery Under Arms Oxford University Press: London). World's Classics were first published as 'pocket-sized hardbacks'. =Present day= In response to competition from Penguin, the series was relaunched in paperback format in 1980, with twenty-four initial titles. The World's Classics series was renamed in 1998 as Oxford World's Classics. The new series initially had a dark blue and off-white colour scheme, but this was changed to red and off-white after Penguin Books USA brought a lawsuit in 1998, which argued that the new covers were similar in design to theirs, constituting an infringement on their 'trade dress' rights. A decade later, a major redesign (retaining the basic red and white colour scheme) of all titles was introduced. Many existing titles are reprints of texts established by the earlier Oxford English Novels series, with revisions to the critical material. Some of these titles have since been updated with new introductions and notes by different editors, while retaining the original base text. For example, the Oxford World's Classics edition of Emma has been updated twice with new introductions by different editors since it was first published in the series in 1980, while retaining the base text established by James Kinsley. Series=Oxford English Drama= Oxford English Drama editions offer a selection of plays, selected from an author's ≈ìuvre or as an anthology of plays linked by topic or theme (e. g. Four Revenge Tragedies). Renaissance, Restoration and eighteenth-century plays have glossaries of archaic words appended, in addition to the usual array of critical material. The series' general editor is Michael Cordner of the University of York. Scholar Anne Barton praised the series as a 'splendid and imaginative project', adding that it 'should reshape the canon in a number of significant areas'. =Major works= Major Works are mini-anthologies of an author's most significant works and selected correspondence. For example, the Major Works edition of Alexander Pope includes the major poems like The Rape of the Lock and The Dunciad, alongside prose essays like Peri Bathous, and an excerpt of his translation of Homer. Some editions include whole novels as well; the Major Works edition of Oscar Wilde anthologises many of his plays and prose alongside the whole of The Picture of Dorian Gray. Most titles are often reprints (with revisions) of volumes from an earlier Oxford series, Oxford Authors, under the general editorship of Frank Kermode.

The story follows Professor Paris Catalano, who travels to Venice following the trail of the last known appearance of Nosferatu (Kinski), who was seen at a Carnival in 1786. Catalano learns through a s√©ance that the vampire is seeking eternal death, and tries to put an end to its existence once and for all. After securing Kinski for the lead of Nosferatu, producer August Caminito planned a sequel to Werner Herzog's Nosferatu the Vampyre. Caminito originally secured Maurizio Lucidi as the director but later felt that film would be better with a more well known director and a higher budget, leading Lucidi to be dropped as the director in favor of Pasquale Squitieri. Squiteri made several changes to the script which did not appeal to Caminito, which led to him paying Squiteri and terminating his contract. This led to further budget cuts in the film and hiring Mario Caiano on as the director. After clashing with Kinski on set, Caiano left the film leading Caminito to direct the film himself. During filming, Kinski would not follow rehearsal and demanded change in actors and often had lighting to be changed dramatically on set. According to second unit director Luigi Cozzi, Kinski's behaviour on set became so erratic that the entire crew left the set and did not return until Kinski apologized for his behaviour. After six weeks of filming, Caminito came to the conclusion that he did not have the entire film completed, but that he also could not continue with the project. This led to entire sections of the re-written screenplay by Caminito not being shot, and Caminito making do with what he had. The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival on 9 September 1988 and it was later released theatrically in Italy.  Plot  Professor Paris Catalano goes to Venice to investigate the last known appearance of Nosferatu during the Carnival of 1786. Catalano seems to think that the vampire is searching for a means to put an end to his torment and actually be dead. He stays with a family who, legend says, has the vampire trapped in a tomb in the basement. After a s√©ance, \\"the vampire\\" leading to Catalano to find away to vanquish Nosferatu completely.

Caminito was introduced to the script for Nosferatu in Venice by Carlo Alberto Alfieri who had written the screenplay and its original story with Leandro Lucchetti. The script was originally a sequel to Werner Herzog's film Nosferatu the Vampyre with Alfieri securing the star of that film, Klaus Kinski, to star in this sequel. On December 17, 1985 Caminito and Kinski signed on for a two film deal: Nosferatu in Venice and Paganini, the latter being a film Kinski had been working on getting produced since 1980. The film was initially to be directed by Maurizio Lucidi. Among the crew was Luigi Cozzi, who was a friend of Alfieri and worked on the set as a consultant and during post-production. Cozzi stated that Caminito felt the film would be a bigger success with a larger budget and doubled the films budget and with a more \\"name\\" director. Caminito fired Lucidi who had only shot a few scenes without Kinski at the February 1986 Venice Carnival. Caminito hired director Pasquale Squitieri and got a cast that included Christopher Plummer, Donald Pleasence, Barbara De Rossi and Yorgo Voyagis. Squitieri re-wrote the script, setting it in the near future of 1996 Venice and hired a number of comic book artists to storyboard the film. Caminito found the story board to be \\"too baroque\\" and would be too expensive to film. Squitieri refused to change his script and had been arguing with Kinski. As Caminito felt they could not lose Kinski on the film, Caminito terminated the contract with Squitieri and paid him the agreed sum before the director shot any of the film yet. This then led to Mario Caiano who had worked with Kinski in the past on films such as The Fighting Fists of Shanghai Joe. In mid-1986, Caiano completed casting on the film and Caminto re-wrote the script to make it match the films new reduced budget. Cozzi later stated that several characters and scenes were scrapped in the new re-write of the film. =Filming= Filming began on August 25. Kinski refused to shave his head and wear fake fangs for the role. After arguing with Caiano on the first day of filming, Caiano stated later that Kinski would not listen to him when he called cut and found him the next day locked in his trailer with Caminito. Caiano learned that Caminito had promised Kinski that he would direct the film. According to Caminito, Caiano ran into Kinski's trailer and told him \\"Now you're directing the movie!\\". Caminito felt determined to finish the film and took on directing the film himself. According to Cozzi, Kinski would ignore the staging they did in rehearsals which led to the director of photography Antonio Nardi to have to reset his lighting set-up from scratch as Kinski would not follow cues and would refuse to shoot re-takes. Kinski had Caminito fire Amanda Sandrelli. When Voyagis' girlfriend, Anne Knecht, visited the set, Kinski demanded Caminito to hire Anne Knecht as the female lead. This had the script be changed so Maria was Helietta's adopted daughter. Cozzi began directing scenes as a second unit director, which included scenes following Kinski in Venice at dawn. Cozzi stated later that they ended with about 10 hours of footage which consisted of Kinski walking around. The boom man on set, Luciano Muratori, stated that during a scene where Nosferatu was to turn Barbara De Rossi's character Helietta into a vampire which was supposed to be Kinski pretending to learn over and bite her neck led to Kinski inserting his fingers into the woman's vagina, which had her run from the set in tears. Cozzi stated that Kinski went as far as to slamming her to the floor and psychically and sexually assaulting here by biting her vagina. Barbara De Rossi also stated in the documentary Kinski in Italy that she was \\"assaulted one day. He never respected the script and he was always physical when he had something to do with women. [During filming] he grabbed my breasts and he hurt me.\\" and that \\"It was a mess. We were really scared. We never knew what could have come out of any scene.\\" According to Cozzi, at one point the entire crew abandoned the set in protest of Kinski who later apologized for his behaviour. After six weeks of shooting in Venice, Caminito only had filmed about half the films script set in Venice and had an entire third of the script to film elsewhere. Caminito could not film any further and attempted to compile the film from what footage he had shot. Release Klaus Kinski in 1988 A day prior to its premiere, Caminito claimed Vampire in Venice to be one hour and forty-six minutes in length. The copy submitted to the ratings board had a 98 minute running time and current home video copies run at 89 minutes. It premiered at midnight on 9 September 1988 at the Venice Film Festival where it was shown out of competition. Cozzi stated that Vampire in Venices presence at the festival had more to do with Caminito's status as a major film producer and did not have to with the artistic quality of the film. It was distributed theatrically in Italy by Medusa in 1988. Matthew Edwards, author of Klaus Kinski: Beast of Cinema commented on the films box office in Italy as being \\"a box-office disaster\\" The film was later released in English territories as Prince of the Night in the United States and Nosferatu in Venice. Vampire in Venice was released on home video by the distributor First Fright in 1991. The film was released on DVD in the United States by One-7 Movies as Prince of the Night on September 9, 2014. Reception From retrospective reviews, David Alexander wrote in Rue Morgue found the film to \\"confusing and scattershot\\" with \\"some awkwardly constructed scenes and goofy editing choices, though an overall atmosphere of Gothic dread helps somewhat\\" specifically noting Tonino Nardi's \\"Beautifully hazy cityscapes in Venice\\". Alexander concluded that the film was \\"more of a curiosity than anything\\". Edwards described the film \\"difficult to review\\" noting \\"its rich atmospheric texture, evocative imagery of Venice and Kinski's wild performance.\\" stating that \\"Kinski paints his sadistic vampire with a sneering disgust for those around him\\" as well as noting \\"a decent performance by Christopher Plummer\\" and also praised Nardi's cinematography stating he \\"captures the canals and Gothic architecutre to stunning effect.\\" Edwards concluded that the film was a \\"monumental muddle that has flashes of brilliance but is rendered bereft of any coherency.\\" In his book on Italian gothic horror films of the decade, Curti stated that Plummer gave the best performance in the film, and the film had a few arresting if repetitive images, stating that Venice \\"never becomes a living prescene in the film (as it does in, say, Don't Look Now)\\" Curti also stated that \\"despite the script's ambitions, the dialogue is often poor if not ridiculous\\" but that it was Kinski who ultimately \\"drowns the film\\" See also * Klaus Kinski filmography * List of horror films of 1988 * List of Italian films of 1988 Footnotes=Sources=    External links  Category:Italian films Category:Nosferatu Category:1988 films Category:1988 horror films Category:Italian horror films Category:Films based on works by Bram Stoker Category:Films shot in Venice Category:Films set in Venice Category:Religious horror films Category:Vampires in film ","title":"Vampire in Venice"},{"id":"3946029","text":"Center Hill can refer to several places in the United States: * Center Hill, Atlanta * Center Hill, Florida * Center Hill, Illinois * Center Hill, North Carolina * Center Hill, Texas * Center Hill Lake, a reservoir in Tennessee ","title":"Center Hill"},{"id":"3946045","text":"The Big Knife is a 1955 film noir directed and produced by Robert Aldrich from a screenplay by James Poe based on the 1949 play by Clifford Odets. The film stars Jack Palance, Ida Lupino, Wendell Corey, Jean Hagen, Rod Steiger, Shelley Winters, Ilka Chase, and Everett Sloane.. Plot Charlie Castle, a very successful Hollywood actor, lives in a huge home with all the amenities associated with his stardom. But, his wife Marion has taken their young son and is living separately from him; she is, in fact, on the verge of filing for divorce. She has had enough of his drunken womanizing and of the fact that he has relinquished his ideals for lower Hollywood expectations. Influential gossip columnist Patty Benedict wants the lowdown on the marriage, but Castle refuses to confirm anything for her. Marion does not want him to renew his contract with powerful studio boss Stanley Shriner Hoff, and will not agree to a reconciliation with her husband if he signs. Castle wants to be free of the studio's grip on his life and his career. He is adamantly refusing to agree to the contract. However, Hoff and his right-hand man, Smiley Coy, have knowledge of the truth behind a hit-and-run accident in which Castle was behind the wheel and which resulted in a death. Castle's friend, Buddy Bliss, took the blame for the accident and served time for it. Castle's defiance enrages Hoff, who is willing to do anything, including blackmail regarding the accident, to force the actor to commit to a seven-year deal. An emotionally-tortured Castle wants desperately to win back Marion, who has been proposed to by writer, and friend of Castle's, Hank Teagle. Castle wants to do more inspiring work than the schlock films Hoff pushes on him, but he promises that if the studio head lets him go he will stop acting altogether. To no avail, he pleads with his needy agent, Nat, to help him be free. In the end, the simple fact of blackmail works and Castle signs the new contract. Buddy's aggressively flirtatious wife, Connie, comes by; despondent, Castle allows the darker side of his nature to prevail and he sleeps with her. Subsequently, Marion and Hank attend a gathering at Castle's place after which Castle prevails upon his wife to listen once again to his reasoning as to why they should reunite. She eventually leaves with Hank but is actually having second thoughts about Castle. Meanwhile, Smiley, who has been attending a party at one of Castle's neighbors, drops in to tell the actor that Dixie Evans, a struggling starlet who happens to have been in the car with Castle the night of the accident, is threatening to reveal what she knows about the crash. Smiley suggests Castle invite her over, to talk and see if he can persuade her to keep quiet. Castle does so and is sympathetic to her feelings about being treated shabbily and disregarded as an actress. She wants to damage Hoff, not Castle. Having had Hank take her back to Castle, Marion arrives while Dixie is there. The actress immediately leaves and the couple have an intense conversation; Marion makes it clear she is at least willing to try again to rekindle their marriage. Subsequently, Dixie goes to Hoff's office and causes such an upheaval that the studio head and Smiley decide that she must be permanently silenced. Smiley lays out a plan to achieve this which involves Castle, and murder. Finally spurred to stand up for his ideals, the actor summons Hoff and Nat and, with Marion present and now aware of Dixie's presence the night of the accident, defies these ruthless men who employ him; he also mandates that nothing should happen to Dixie. Hoff and Smiley try one more extortion ploy, producing recordings secretly made of Marion with Hank. Neither Marion nor Castle are moved by this attempt and, finally, an outraged Hoff lets Castle go. \\"You're through,\\" Smiley tells the actor. After a brief, quiet respite, Buddy storms in to reveal that he has discovered Castle's fling with Connie; rather than take Castle up on his offer to allow himself to be hit, Buddy spits in his face. Marion has decided to leave the past behind and reconcile with her husband. Castle asks for a bath to be drawn and, after pledging to Marion \\"a better future\\", goes upstairs. Smiley returns to telephone Hoff and let him know that Dixie, staggering out of a bar and into the street, was struck and killed by a city bus. In spite of seemingly redeeming himself in many ways, Castle is devastated by the fact that he has betrayed a friend, sacrificed his integrity and anguished the woman he adores. He gets into the bath and ends his life.

In modern ferry design over the last 25 years, though, bow visors have given way to clam doors. Instead of one large visor, two halves open horizontally to reveal the loading ramp and deck. These are believed to be safer than bow visor doors, as in a bow visor door, the forces acting on the door from the impact of the waves are absorbed by the hinges and locks, which may fail. With clam doors, the forces of the waves are absorbed by the surrounding bow superstructure. Furthermore, on seagoing vessels there should be inner bow doors or 'collision bulkhead doors' in place behind the loading ramp. These doors are an upper extension of the collision bulkhead and act as a secondary barrier against water entering the car deck, should the primary bow door(s) fail. There have been several recorded incidents in which bow visors have partially opened whilst the ship is in motion, resulting in some ships having to have their visor locking mechanisms strengthened. Bow visor failure has also directly caused the loss of some ships, such as the in 1994.

In Java, the objects are POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects). The mappings are decoupled from the application logic by packaging the SQL statements in XML configuration files. The result is a significant reduction in the amount of code that a developer needs to access a relational database using lower level APIs like JDBC and ODBC. Other persistence frameworks such as Hibernate allow the creation of an object model (in Java, say) by the user, and create and maintain the relational database automatically. iBATIS takes the reverse approach: the developer starts with a SQL database and iBATIS automates the creation of the Java objects. Both approaches have advantages, and iBATIS is a good choice when the developer does not have full control over the SQL database schema. For example, an application may need to access an existing SQL database used by other software, or access a new database whose schema is not fully under the application developer's control, such as when a specialized database design team has created the schema and carefully optimized it for high performance. On May 21, 2010 the development team forked the code creating a new project called MyBatis and making new releases there. As a consequence the Apache iBATIS project became inactive and was moved to the Apache Attic in June 2010. Usage For example, assume there is a database table and a Java class . To read the product record having the key into a new POJO, the following mapping is added into an iBATIS XML mapping file: select PROD_ID as id, PROD_DESC as description from PRODUCT where PROD_ID = #value# A new Java Product object can then be retrieved from the database for product number 123 as follows: Product resultProduct = (Product) sqlMapClient.queryForObject(\\"getProduct\\", 123); In the mapping file example, \`#value#\` refers to the long integer value passed into the query. If the parameter is a Java object, then values from properties on that object can be inserted into the query using a similar \`#\` notation. For example, if the parameter class is a \`com.example.Product\` which has a property called \`id\`, then \`#value#\` can be replaced with \`#id#\`. The \`sqlMapClient\` object is an instance of class \`com.ibatis.sqlmap.client.SqlMapClient\`. Availability The founder of iBATIS has publicly stated his dismay with Java 5, but has continued to release new versions of iBATIS for Java. Versions 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 came out in April 2008, and 2.3.3 in July. The framework is currently available in Java, .NET, and Ruby (RBatis) versions. The jBati project is a JavaScript ORM inspired by iBATIS. The Apache iBator tool is closely related: it connects to your database and uses its metadata to generate iBATIS mapping files and Java classes. History In 2001 a project called iBATIS was started by Clinton Begin. Originally the focus was on the development of cryptographic software solutions. The first product to be released by iBATIS was Secrets,iBATIS Secrets a personal data encryption and signing tool much like PGP. Secrets was written entirely in Java and was released under an open source license. That year Microsoft published a paperCat Fight in a Pet Store: J2EE vs. .NET to demonstrate that its recent .NET 1.0 framework was more productive than Java. For that purpose Microsoft built its own version of Sun's Web \\"Pet Store\\", a Web project that Sun had used to show Java best practices (Java BluePrints). Microsoft claimed that .NET was 10 times faster and 4 times more productive than Java. In 2002 Clinton developed an application called JPetStore to demonstrate that Java could be more productive than .NET and could also do so while achieving a better architecture than was used in the Microsoft implementation. JPetStore 1.0 had a big impactJPetStore 1.0 announcement on TheServerside.com and the database layer that Clinton used attracted the attention of the community. Soon, iBATIS Database Layer 1.0 project started, composed of two components: iBATIS DAO and iBATIS SQL Maps. iBATIS 2.0 was released in June 2004.iBATIS 2.0 announcement It was a complete redesign while keeping the same features. Clinton donated the iBATIS name and code to Apache Software Foundation and the project stayed in the ASF for six years. Eventually iBATIS DAO was deprecated, considering that better DAO frameworks were available, such as Spring Framework. On May 19, 2010 iBATIS 3.0 was published and simultaneously the development team decided to continue the development of the framework at Google Code.iBATIS Project Team Moving to Google Code under a new project called MyBatis. On June 16, 2010 Apache announced that iBATIS was retired and moved to the Apache Attic.

It is one of two major outdoor arenas in the New York metropolitan area, along with PNC Bank Arts Center. The theater was designed to specifications provided by Robert Moses, who created Jones Beach State Park. History left Opened in June 1952 as the New Jones Beach Marine Stadium, the venue originally had 8,200 seats and hosted musicals. Moses had several boxes designated for his own use, and Moses' friend Guy Lombardo performed often in the early years. The opening show was the operetta extravaganza A Night in Venice by Johann Strauss II, produced by film producer, Mike Todd, complete with floating gondolas and starring Enzo Stuarti, Thomas Hayward (tenor), Norwood Smith and Nola Fairbanks. During one of these Lombardo performances, the early phonograph recording star Billy Murray died of a heart attack in 1954. Lombardo's final show was the 1977 production of Finian's Rainbow, with Christopher Hewett in the title role. After Lombardo's death in 1977, the series resumed in 1978 with Annie Get Your Gun, starring Lucie Arnaz. Beginning in the 1980s, the primary focus of the venue would change to concerts. In 1991 and 1992, under contract from concert promoter Ron Delsener, the theatre underwent an extensive renovation, adding a second level and increasing the capacity to 11,200 seats. The capacity was expanded again in 1998 to hold 15,000 seats. The theater's original design featured a moat; the stage was actually situated on Zachs Bay and was separated from the beach. Performers used an underwater tunnel that connected the main theatre to the stage or was brought to the stage by boat, and some scenes had floating scenery. Each night, Guy Lombardo would arrive in one of his luxurious speed boats, hop out and take his place in front of the orchestra and the show would start. The Guy Lombardo Orchestra would pass through the moat on a yacht during the intermissions and play tunes while floating in front of the audience. The moat was covered or filled in during the first renovation and seats were installed closer to the stage. Today right In 2002, the company of clothing designer Tommy Hilfiger purchased the naming rights to the venue, renaming it \\"Tommy Hilfiger at Jones Beach Theater\\" for four years. On April 13, 2006, Tommy Hilfiger's company, under new ownership, declined its option to keep the company's name on the theater, and naming rights were purchased by the camera company Nikon, which renamed the venue \\"Nikon at Jones Beach Theater\\". For a time the venue had a strict no-alcohol policy except in designated VIP boxes located behind the orchestra and the VIP tent area. Separate additional tickets are required to enter the popular VIP tent area. Starting in 2014, alcohol was available for sale to the general public during certain shows and, in 2015, was available for sale to the general public in regular concession stands during most shows. In 2009, Jones Beach introduced The Bay Stage, which has a general admission capacity of 5,000. The performances are staged behind the concessions on the theater property. The theater property is located a short distance from the VIP area but The Bay Stage events cannot be viewed or heard from the VIP area. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy did major damage to the theater. Various structures were destroyed and much of the lower part of the arena was flooded, including the lower section of seats which were flooded more than halfway up.Jones Beach Looking to Rebuild After Wrath of Sandy Nicole Murphy, Wantagh-Seaford Patch, November 5, 2012. Retrieved February 9, 2013. The venue reopened on May 31, 2013, after a $20 million rehabilitation project. Starting January 2017, Jones Beach Theater will undergo a million dollar renovation plan, including energy- efficient LED lighting, more cafes, larger concourses for less crowding and more. Nikon's naming rights contract expired at the end of 2016, and in February 2017, New York health system Northwell Health purchased the naming rights to the venue, revealing the new name - \\"Northwell Health at Jones Beach Theater.\\" The three-year deal includes an option for two additional years. Among the most frequent performers at Jones Beach Theater are Jimmy Buffett, who has played the venue 30 times, James Taylor, and Aerosmith, who have played the venue 21 times.

It is one of a class of chemical relaxation methods pioneered by the German physical chemist Manfred Eigen in the 1950s. In these methods, a reacting system initially at equilibrium is perturbed rapidly and then observed as it relaxes back to equilibrium.Laidler K.J. and Meiser J.H., Physical Chemistry (Benjamin/Cummings 1982) p.362, Atkins P. and de Paula J. Atkins' Physical Chemistry (8th ed., W.H.Freeman 2006) p.805, Steinfeld J.I., Francisco J.S. and Hase W.L., Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics (2nd ed., Prentice-Hall 1998) p.140-3, In the case of temperature jump, the perturbation involves rapid heating which changes the value of the equilibrium constant, followed by relaxation to equilibrium at the new temperature. The heating usually involves discharging of a capacitor (in the kV range) through a small volume (< 1 mL) of a conducting solution containing the molecule/reaction to be studied. In some versions of the apparatus used, the solution is heated instead by the output of a pulsed laser which emits in the near infra-red. When laser heating is employed, the solution need not be conducting. In both cases, the temperature of the solution is caused to rise by a small amount in microseconds (or less in the case of laser heating). This allows the study of the shift in equilibrium of reactions that equilibrate in milliseconds (or microseconds with laser temperature jump), these changes most commonly being observed using absorption spectroscopy or fluorescence spectroscopy. Due to the small volumes involved the temperature of the solution returns to that of its surroundings in minutes. The fractional extent of the reaction (i.e. the percentage change in concentration of a measurable species) depends on the molar enthalpy change (ŒîH¬∞) between the reactants and products and the equilibrium position. If K is the equilibrium constant and dT is the change in temperature then the enthalpy change is given by the Van 't Hoff equation: : {\\\\Delta H^o} = {RT^2}.\\\\frac{d \\\\ln K}{dT} where R is the universal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. When a single step in a reaction is perturbed in a temperature jump experiment, the reaction follows a single exponential decay function with time constant (\\\\tau) equal to a function of the forward (ka) and reverse (kb) rate constants. For the perturbation of a simple equilibrium A <=> B which is first order in both directions, the reciprocal of the time constant equals the sum of the two rate constants :1/\\\\tau = k_a + k_b The two rate constants can be determined from the values of (\\\\tau) and the equilibrium constant :K = k_a / k_b, yielding two equations for two unknowns. In more complex reaction networks, when multiple reaction steps are perturbed, then the reciprocal time constants are given by the eigenvalues of the characteristic rate equations. The ability to observe intermediate steps in a reaction pathway is one of the attractive features of this technology. Related chemical relaxation methods include pressure jump,Espenson J.H.

Due to its soil, which is dominated by gravel, it is planted in grape varieties Cabernet Sauvignon (35%), Cabernet Franc (35%), and Merlot (30%). Most other Saint-√âmilion wines are dominated by Merlot, and Figeac therefore bears a certain semblance to the wines of M√©doc and Graves despite being situated on Bordeaux's right bank. The wine, which is one of the most famous of Saint-√âmilion, is aged in 100% new oak barrels. Ch√¢teau Figeac wine carries the rank of Premier Grand Cru Class√© (Class B) in the official Classification of Saint-√âmilion wine. From 1945 to 2011, the estate produced a second wine named La Grange Neuve de Figeac and since 2006 a special wine named Petit-Figeac.

The estate was managed by Alfred Maquin, as the Villepigues lived in Paris. In 1905, their son Robert Villepigue took over the running of the estate. After Henriette's death in 1942, it was unclear if Robert Villepigue or his sister Ada Elizabeth (who had married Antoine Manoncourt) would inherit the estate, but in 1946 it passed to Ada Elizabeth Manoncourt. In January 1947, Thierry Manoncourt (son of Antoine and Ada Elizabeth Manoncourt) took over the running of Ch√¢teau Figeac, and it was under his leadership that the estate rose to the front ranks of Saint-√âmilion estates.

Produced, written, and directed by Allan Francovich and financed by Tiny Rowland, the film was released by Hemar Enterprises in November 1994.scroll down to Allan Francovich ‚Äì The Maltese Double Cross With a controversial premise, it was immediately threatened with legal action by lawyers acting for a US government official, and the British government prevented screenings at the 1994 London Film Festival, at the Institute of Contemporary Arts and at several universities. But Labour MP Tam Dalyell ignored libel warnings and went ahead and showed the film at the House of Commons on 16 November 1994. Though it was never widely distributed, the film stirred up a great deal of controversy - particularly in the United Kingdom. Reviews of the film in major UK publications were mostly negative, even as they said that the film revealed certain problems in the mainstream account of the Lockerbie bombing. The film came in for fierce criticism from some American family members of victims of Pan Am 103 and from the governments of Britain and the United States. Other (mainly British) family members endorsed the conclusions of the film. Synopsis The Maltese Double Cross - Lockerbie discusses evidence and witnesses that would eventually figure at the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial in 2000: * The Mebo MST‚Äì13 timer fragment, which Thomas Thurman of the FBI's forensic laboratory said that he identified on 15 June 1990; * Mebo's Swiss owner, Edwin Bollier, is interviewed at length; * forensic scientist, Dr Michael Scott, describes DERA's 'forensic expert', Alan Feraday, as a technician without any formal qualifications as a scientist; * A solicitor Alastair Logan criticises DERA's Dr Thomas Hayes for the forensic evidence that was used to convict the Maguire Seven; * Oswald LeWinter, claiming to be a CIA operative, says the appointment of 'Libyan dirty tricks expert', Vincent Cannistraro, to head the CIA's team investigating Lockerbie 'would be funny, if it were not an obscenity'; * Lester Coleman stated that the bomb was linked to a terrorist cell trained by CIA operative, Edwin P. Wilson; and, * A best-selling author, David Yallop, reviews the available evidence and looks at who might have been responsible for the Lockerbie bombing. The documentary disputes the conclusion reached by the official investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, instead advancing the theory that the bomb was introduced onto the aircraft by an unwitting drug mule, Khaled Jafaar, in what the filmmaker claims is a CIA- protected suitcase. Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, a former president of Iran, discusses the idea that Iran took revenge for the shootdown by the USS Vincennes of Iran Air Flight 655 in July 1988. The film quotes Tiny Rowland as disclosing that Pik Botha told him that he and 22 South African delegates were going to New York for the Namibian Independence Ratification Ceremony and were all booked on the Pan Am flight 103. They were given a warning from a source that could not be ignored. Botha and 6 others managed to get on an earlier flight, but the remaining 16 stayed in London and missed the official event. Broadcast and screenings The Maltese Double Cross ‚Äì Lockerbie was to have been shown at the London Film Festival in November 1994 but was withdrawn at the last minute under threat of a libel action by Michael Hurley, a retired US Drug Enforcement Administration operative. The London Film Festival noted at the time that \\"certain statements similar to those made in the film are currently the subject of legal action and, in view of this, it has been decided to withdraw the film.\\" After the cancellation, director Francovich claimed that \\"there is no way in hell they're going to stop this film. It will be shown at film festivals around the world. It will make its way back to Britain.\\" Some family members of victims of Flight 103 who supported the film expressed disappointment over its withdrawal. Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died on the flight, said he had \\"never felt so angry in my life\\" and Pamela Dix, who lost a brother, argued that \\"the festival should have been brave enough to show the film.\\" Several days after the movie was withdrawn from the film festival, Labour MP Tam Dalyell arranged for the film to be screened in the House of Commons on 16 November 1994 where it was viewed by diplomats, members of the press, and bereaved family members of victims of the bombing. The first public showing of The Maltese Double Cross in Britain took place at the Glasgow Film Theatre on 17 November 1994. The UK's Channel 4 had planned to broadcast the film as early as 1994 but apparently backtracked when several American relatives of PA 103 victims wrote a letter to a newspaper alleging that the film was partially funded by Libya and used a number of \\"confidence tricksters\\" as sources. After the Special Broadcasting Service of Australia agreed to screen the film in its entirety, Channel 4 re-entered negotiations with Francovich and reached a compromise to broadcast a slimmed down, 92-minute version of the film which cut material that could have caused legal problems. The shortened version of the film was ultimately shown on Channel 4 on 11 May 1995, but some American relatives of the victims again criticised the decision and accused Channel 4 of giving air-time to what they claimed as \\"Libyan propaganda.\\" A Channel 4 spokeswoman said the decision to broadcast the film was based on the view that it needed to be shown to a wider public. The film was prevented from being shown on television or cinemas in the United States, but eventually played at the Pacific Film Archive in July 1998.https://cinefiles.bampfa.berkeley.edu/cinefiles/DocDetail?docId=18263 Reaction Though it was never released commercially, the film garnered a great deal of attention in the British press, from the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom, and from family members whose loved ones died in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing. =Reviews= After The Maltese Double Cross was broadcast on television, it received several reviews in mainstream British newspapers which were generally negative. Writing in The Guardian, Stuart Jeffries suggested that the complex argument of the film was \\"ill presented\\" and that \\"if future documentarists need an example of how not to make a film about complicated intrigues, they should watch The Maltese Double Cross.\\" In his review of the film in The Independent, Thomas Sutcliffe noted that \\"Francovich wasn't exactly a dispassionate seeker after truth,\\" and that although the film raised \\"some real questions about the official account‚Ä¶it didn't replace it with any reliable truth of its own.\\" Similarly, Lynn Truss of The Times noted that the film had an important and controversial story to tell, but that the \\"obfuscations of the commentary and editing were unpardonable\\". In 2006, Australian journalist and filmmaker John Pilger argued that the Francovich documentary had succeeded in destroying \\"the official truth that Libya was responsible for the sabotage of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie in 1988.\\" =Governmental criticism= The governments of the United States and the United Kingdom and their respective agencies strongly contested the conclusions of the film as well as the character and honesty of some of the film's participants. In January 1995, Francovich claimed that new evidence (in the form of a US intelligence document) added further weight to the argument in his film that Iran had paid to have the bombing carried out, a claim promptly dismissed by the State Department, the British Foreign Office, and the Scottish Office. Her Majesty's Government dismissed the document, which it said was highly redacted and based upon second and third-hand sources, as adding no new information, while the Scottish Office argued that it was an old story. The US State Department claimed that it had investigated a possible Iranian connection over the course of three years, but had uncovered no credible evidence along those lines. The televising by Channel 4 of The Maltese Double Cross on 11 May 1995 provoked an even stronger reaction from official US and British agencies. The Guardian reported, for example, that the American Embassy and the Scottish Crown Office had apparently attempted to discredit the film prior to its broadcast. The embassy had sent a letter to The Guardian ‚Äì and, the newspaper assumed, to other news organisations as well ‚Äì which attacked the credibility of three of the film's witnesses and argued that The Maltese Double Cross was \\"Libyan-financed.\\" The film's production company, Hemar Enterprises, was part-owned by the Lonrho affiliate Metropole Hotels which, in turn, was one third-owned by a state-run Libyan investment company. The Guardian noted that the Crown Office had made similar points in an official statement and argued that they had done so \\"in apparent co- ordination\\" with the US embassy. The Crown Office refused to comment on the specific allegations in the film because of the pending trial of two Libyan men, but noted \\"that the criminal charges in this case were brought on the basis of corroborated evidence supporting these charges and therefore inevitably conflicting with much of what is in the film.\\" The Crown Office did publicly accuse one key witness in the film, Oswald LeWinter, of being a \\"notorious hoaxer\\" and another, Juval Aviv, of being a mere El Al airline security guard - not a member of the intelligence community as he claimed. Additionally, the FBI investigated the film at the request of the Scottish police and argued that LeWinter was \\"a major fabricator\\" and that overall the film was a sham. During the controversy in mid-1994 over whether the film would be shown on Channel 4, filmmaker Francovich said he had been told that several CIA agents had been sent to Europe for the purpose of discrediting his production. Francovich also claimed that phones in his company's London office were tapped and cars of film staff members were sabotaged. He asked, \\"if we are doing such a bullshit movie, why are they putting all these resources into trying to stop us?\\" Press reports of the time did not provide any corroboration of Francovich's claims. In a letter to The Guardian published after Channel 4 broadcast the film, Francovich offered a further response to the US and UK governments: > \\"The attacks by the UK and US authorities on my film The Maltese Double > Cross (\\"UK and US scorn Lockerbie film\\", The Guardian, 11 May) are exactly > what we predicted would happen.

Some American relatives spoke out against plans to televise the film in Britain, accusing Channel 4 of exploiting the victims and of airing \\"Libyan propaganda\\", a reference to the allegation that the film was partly funded with Libyan money. One American man, Daniel Cohen, who lost his daughter on Flight 103 was particularly outspoken against the film, calling Francovich a \\"Libyan dupe\\" and \\"at best a journeyman film maker.\\" A December 1993 Financial Times article revealed that Hemar Enterprises was owned by Metropole Hotels, controlled by Tiny Rowland. Shortly after the indictment of Libya in the Pan Am Flight 103 incident, Rowland had sold a percentage of his interests to the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company (Lafico), controlled by the Government of Libya. This fact led the Cohens to the belief that Libya had backed the film.Cohen, Susan and Daniel. \\"Chapter 16.\\" Pan Am 103: The Bombing, the Betrayals, and a Bereaved Family's Search for Justice.

History  In the early 17th century, two cousins of the Agnikul Chauhan Raja of Mainpuri, Dalthamban Sahi and Dharamel Sahi, were returning from a pilgrimage to Jagannath Puri. They had a small force with them. On their return journey, they halted at the Capital of Surguja State, Ambikapur. They camped near the Joda talab (Bhaiya Bada) which still exists to this day. The Maharaja of Surguja was away from the Capital and some rebel sardars of the State surrounded the palace. The Rani came to know that the Chauhan brothers were camping near the Joda Talab. She sent the traditional Rakhi. Dalthamban Sahi and Dharamel Sahi came to her rescue and drove away the bagi sardars. A major part of their force was killed in the encounter. After some time the Maharaja returned. He thanked the Chauhan brothers for rescuing the Rani and offered them the Jagirdari of the area on the northern part of the state known as Jhilmili Estate. This was accepted by the older brother Dalthamban Sahi. A part of Jhilmili Area was under control of Baland Rajas. The Chauhan brothers settled at Kaskela village on the banks of the Rend River. They drove away the forces of Baland from the area and overpowered the Pakharias who were perpetually rebelling against the Surguja State. They paid an Annual Tribute to the Surguja State. The title of Bhaiya was conferred on the family by Maharajah Amar Singh Deo Bahadoor \\"Surguja State\\". Since after the tying of the Rakhi, the brothers had become bhaiyas of Rani, the ilaka (area) was known as Bhaiyasthan. This was later known as Bhaiyathan.

As an example Flight by Morteza Katouzian is showing the marginalized people who have no freedom as result of political changes. In Iran, the social and political developments of the 1940s radically altered the evolution of this country's plastic arts and entirely altering its natural path.  History  The modern art movement in Iran had its genesis in the late 1940s and early 1950s. This was the period after the death of famous Persian painter, Kamal-ol-molk (1852‚Äì1940) and thus symbolically the end of a rigid adherence to academic painting. The 1949 opening of the Apadana gallery in Tehran by Mahmoud Javadipour and other colleagues, and the emergence of artists like Marcos Grigorian in the 1950s, signaled a commitment to the creation of a form of modern art grounded in Iran. Grigorian found influence for his art in popular Iranian culture, specifically a coffee-house storyteller culture and the visual language of dry earth and mud. One of Grigorian's students at the College of Fine Arts at the University of Tehran was Hossein Zenderoudi, Zenderoudi was interested in the forms and aesthetics of objects made for Shi'a Islam worship. The scholar Karim Emami likened his art to the kind of objects found in saqqakhanas, coining term, the \\"Saqqakhaneh school\\".  Saqqakhaneh movement  In the 1950 and 1960s, a new subgenre of Iranian art called the Saqqakhaneh school (also known as SaqqƒÅ- ·∏µƒÅna, Saqqa-khaneh, Saqakhaneh, Sahakhanah) was pioneered by artists Hossein Zenderoudi, Parviz Tanavoli, Faramarz Pilaram, Massoud Arabshahi, Mansur Qandriz, Nasser Oveisi, Sadeq Tabrizi and Zhazeh Tabatabai. Saqqakhaneh school is a movement of neo-traditional modern art that is found in Iran, rooted in a history of coffee-house paintings and Shi øite Islam visual elements. The word Saqqakhaneh originally referred to a type of water-fountain shrine found locally, and came to represent a movement characterised heavily by symbolism. Other motifs found throughout the region were incorporated into the artistic movement ‚Äì the hand being a prime example. In scholar Karim Emami's articles on ‚ÄúSaqqƒÅ-·∏µƒÅna Paintings,‚Äù he defined in which a, \\"combined religious imagery and traditional decorative elements with modern painting techniques, played a significant role in drawing the attention of the media and art connoisseurs to the genre\\". A visual language was created by drawing on the history of the Shi'a Islamic culture, specifically the saqqakhana, a small public area in which water is given to strangers often decorated with symbols and offerings. The artists of this genre were re-appropriating these symbolic traditions associated with the saqqakhana but with a modernist stance. By the late 1960s into the 1970s he Saqqakhaneh school artists of Iran had international prominence and this helped pave the way for the opening of the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art in 1977. The Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art boasting an important collection of both Western and Iranian artists. The Iranian revolution by 1979 halted the dynamics of the Iranian arts scene. It has been debated by various scholars after the publication of Edward Said's 1978 book Orientalism (which posed similar questions), was the Saqqakhaneh movement affected by the postcolonial view of Iran or rather, did it intensify Orientalism. In 2013, Layla S. Diba and Fereshteh Daftari co-curated the exhibition, Iran Modern (2013) shown at the Asia Society in New York City. The exhibition was the first major exhibition of modern art from Iran, featuring 26 artists which included Ahmad Aali, Abbas, Massoud Arabshahi, Siah Armajani, Mohammad Ehsai, Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian, Mansour Ghandriz, Marcos Grigorian, Ghasem Hajizadeh, Nahid Hagigat, Bahman Jalali, Rana Javadi, Reza Mafi, Leyly Matine-Daftary, Ardeshir Mohassess, Bahman Mohassess, Nicky Nodjoumi, Houshang Pezeshknia, Faramarz Pilaram, Behjat Sadr, Abolghassem Saidi, Sohrab Sepehri, Parviz Tanavoli, Mohsen Vaziri-Moqaddam, Manoucher Yektai, and Hossein Zenderoudi. The exhibition was divided into sections including Saqqakhaneh and neotraditional art styles influenced by folk art history, abstract art, and calligraphy.

Such vector fields find important applications in the study of Lie theory, symplectic geometry, and the study of Hamiltonian group actions. Motivation Important to applications in mathematics and physics is the notion of a flow on a manifold. In particular, if M is a smooth manifold and X is a smooth vector field, one is interested in finding integral curves to X . More precisely, given p \\\\in M one is interested in curves \\\\gamma_p: \\\\mathbb R \\\\to M such that : \\\\gamma_p'(t) = X_{\\\\gamma_p(t)}, \\\\qquad \\\\gamma_p(0) = p, for which local solutions are guaranteed by the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem of Ordinary Differential Equations. If X is furthermore a complete vector field, then the flow of X , defined as the collection of all integral curves for X , is a diffeomorphism of M. The flow \\\\phi_X: \\\\mathbb R \\\\times M \\\\to M given by \\\\phi_X(t,p) = \\\\gamma_p(t) is in fact an action of the additive Lie group (\\\\mathbb R,+) on M. Conversely, every smooth action A:\\\\mathbb R \\\\times M \\\\to M defines a complete vector field X via the equation : X_p = \\\\left.\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\right_{t=0} A(t,p). It is then a simple result that there is a bijective correspondence between \\\\mathbb R actions on M and complete vector fields on M . In the language of flow theory, the vector field X is called the infinitesimal generator. Intuitively, the behaviour of the flow at each point corresponds to the \\"direction\\" indicated by the vector field. It is a natural question to ask whether one may establish a similar correspondence between vector fields and more arbitrary Lie group actions on M . Definition Let G be a Lie group with corresponding Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g . Furthermore, let M be a smooth manifold endowed with a smooth action A : G \\\\times M \\\\to M . Denote the map A_p: G \\\\to M such that A_p(g) = A(g,p) , called the orbit map of A corresponding to p . For X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak g , the fundamental vector field X^\\\\\\\\# corresponding to X is any of the following equivalent definitions: * X^\\\\\\\\#_p = d_e A_p(-X) * X^\\\\\\\\#_p = d_{(e,p)}A\\\\left(-X,0_{T_p M}\\\\right) * X^\\\\\\\\#_p = \\\\left. \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\right_{t=0} A\\\\left( \\\\exp(-tX), p \\\\right) where d is the differential of a smooth map and 0_{T_pM} is the zero vector in the vector space T_p M. The map \\\\mathfrak g \\\\to \\\\Gamma(TM), X \\\\mapsto X^\\\\\\\\# can then be shown to be a Lie algebra homomorphism. Applications=Lie groups= The Lie algebra of a Lie group G may be identified with either the left- or right-invariant vector fields on G . It is a well known result that such vector fields are isomorphic to T_e G , the tangent space at identity. In fact, if we let G act on itself via right-multiplication, the corresponding fundamental vector fields are precisely the left-invariant vector fields. =Hamiltonian group actions= In the motivation, it was shown that there is a bijective correspondence between smooth \\\\mathbb R actions and complete vector fields. Similarly, there is a bijective correspondence between symplectic actions (the induced diffeomorphisms are all symplectomorphisms) and complete symplectic vector fields. A closely related idea is that of Hamiltonian vector fields. Given a symplectic manifold (M,\\\\omega) , we say that X_H is a Hamiltonian vector field if there exists a smooth function H: M \\\\to \\\\mathbb R satisfying : dH = \\\\iota_{X_H}\\\\omega where the map \\\\iota is the interior product. This motivatives the definition of a Hamiltonian group action as follows: If G is a Lie group with Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g and A: G\\\\times M \\\\to M is a group action of G on a smooth manifold M , then we say that A is a Hamiltonian group action if there exists a moment map \\\\mu: M \\\\to \\\\mathfrak g^* such that for each X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak g , : d\\\\mu^X = \\\\iota_{X^\\\\\\\\#}\\\\omega, where \\\\mu^X:M \\\\to \\\\mathbb R, p \\\\mapsto \\\\langle \\\\mu(p),X \\\\rangle and X^\\\\\\\\# is the fundamental vector field of X References Category:Lie groups Category:Symplectic geometry Category:Hamiltonian mechanics Category:Smooth manifolds ","title":"Fundamental vector field"},{"id":"3946233","text":"Jean J√©r√¥me (1906-1990) was a French communist activist and Resistance member. Born as Micha≈Ç Feintuch (in French Mikha√´l or Michel), he took the pseudonym Jean J√©r√¥me in 1940, until his death. Biography Born in Solotvyn, Galicia (part of Austria-Hungary) as one of the seven children of a vendor, he received a religious education in the local yeshiva (Jewish school), and spoke both Hebrew and Yiddish. He started work in menial jobs at a very young age, and he became a communist after Galicia was taken over by Poland at the end of World War I. Feintuch attended meetings of the newly formed and clandestine Communist Party of Poland at the age of sixteen, and he joined a trade union. After two successive arrests, he could no longer find employment, and he ultimately fled Poland in order to elude military service. He lived in Belgium after 1927, working in a steel plant. He also attended lectures at the University of Li√®ge at about the same time. His political activities caused his expulsion, so he illegally crossed into France to work as an electrician in a telephone factory. He became active in the Conf√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale du Travail (CGT-F) and the Polish mission of the Main-d'≈ìuvre √©trang√®re (Foreign Workers Movement) to the Central Committee of the French Communist Party (PCF). In 1931, he was deported to Belgium, but returned once more to become active in the Paris region, remaining a clandestine operative for several years thereafter. Feintuch became an important internal contact for the Comintern and Profintern; he established a relationship with the Comintern's envoy to France, Eugen Fried, and he was one in the Party section charged with sending weapons and supplies to the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War. After the Spanish Popular Front was crushed in 1939, Mikha√´l Feintuch and his section were directed to organize the transit of tens of thousands of former fighters and other refugees into France. He also, probably, engaged in the trafficking of jewels and gold. In June 1940, his central position in the Party was confirmed by Jacques Duclos. Feintuch, newly named J√©rome, became the official supplier of paper and printing material to the Party's illegal press (which had been outlawed after the PCF had outraged public opinion and the Deladier government by condoning the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.) Philippe Robrieux argued that J√©rome replaced Giulio Ceretti, the man charged with obtaining illegal funds for the Comintern. (Ceretti and Maurice Thorez had since been recalled to Moscow.) When the German occupation of France began, J√©rome was charged with maintaining contact with other elements of the Resistance, intellectuals as well as the Free French Forces of General Charles de Gaulle. He was arrested in 1943, an incident still wrapped in mystery. Some speculate that his activities brought the downfall of other communist Franc Tireurs Partisans (MOI), the group pictured in the Affiche Rouge led by Missak Manouchian. Still, Jean J√©rome has since been awarded numerous distinctions for his participation in the underground movement: the M√©daille de la R√©sistance, the Croix de guerre, and the L√©gion d'honneur. The biographical profiles he himself submitted to PCF sources are very succinct. According to Philippe Robrieux, Jean J√©rome acted as fundraiser for the PCF up until the 1970s, through his known business ventures in the People's Republic of Poland and in Czechoslovakia.

Between 1988 and 1992 he worked and staged performances in many countries - Austria, Yugoslavia, Italy, Finland, Israel, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. Among the features characteristic to his plays are the soothing background music of a repetitive pattern throughout the performance, extensive use of dance and movement and unique props on stage, as well as an employment of natural substances as water, fire, wind, ice and stone. The length of a single performance often exceeds conventional viewing time since Nekro≈°ius favours complex and challenging pieces to stage, such as the Song of Songs or The Seasons by Kristijonas Donelaitis.

Parthenocissus vitacea), also known as thicket creeper, false Virginia creeper, woodbine, or grape woodbine, is a woody vine native to North America, in southeastern Canada (west to southern Manitoba) and a large area of the United States, from Maine west to Montana and south to New Jersey and Missouri in the east, and Texas to Arizona in the west. It is present in California, but it may be an introduced species that far west.Jepson Manual Treatment Description Parthenocissus inserta is a climbing and sprawling woody vine (liana), reaching lengths of 20 m, using small branched tendrils with twining tips. The leaves are palmately compound, composed of five leaflets, each leaflet reaching 13 cm in length and 7 cm broad. The leaflets have a coarsely toothed margin. The flowers are small and greenish, produced in clusters in late spring, and mature in late summer or early fall into small blue-black berries. These berries contain oxalates and the plant may cause dermatitis. Parthenocissus inserta is closely related to and commonly confused with Parthenocissus quinquefolia (Virginia creeper). They differ in their means of climbing, with the tendrils twining around plant stems in P. inserta lacking the round, adhesive discs found on the tendril tips of P. quinquefolia, though the ends may be club-shaped when inserted into a crevice. One consequence of this is that (unlike P. quinquefolia) it cannot climb smooth walls, only through shrubs and trees. In addition, the leaflets of P. inserta are shiny when young and only slightly pale below, while those of P. quinquefolia are dull above and pale green, whitened, or glaucous below. P. inserta flowerhead branching is dichotomous or trichotomous, with branches of equal thickness, while P. quinquefolia branches unequally, with a definite central axis. The berries of P. inserta are larger, at 8-12 mm in diameter, versus 5-8 mm broad in P. quinquefolia. The petiolules of mature P. inserta leaflets are typically longer, at 5-30 mm long, versus sessile or up to 10 mm in P. quinquefolia. Taxonomy Parthenocissus inserta was first described in 1887 by Anton Kerner, as Vitis inserta. It was transferred to Parthenocissus by Karl Fritsch in 1922. Separately, in 1893, Ellsworth Brownell Knerr described it as the variety vitacea of Ampelopsis quinquefolia (a synonym of Parthenocissus quinquefolia). Albert Spear Hitchcock raised the variety to the full species Parthenocissus vitacea in 1894. Kerner's epithet inserta has priority over Knerr's vitacea, so the correct name is Parthenocissus inserta. Ecology The flowers of thicket creeper are frequently visited by Mordella marginata, a tumbling flower beetle. Several bee species have been observed collecting pollen from the flowers, including the sweat bees Augochlora pura, Lasioglossum subviridatum, and Lasioglossum zephyrus. The fruits are eaten by birds.

He was the first polar bear cub to survive past infancy at the Berlin Zoo in more than 30 years. At one time the subject of international controversy, he became a tourist attraction and commercial success. Knut became the center of a mass media phenomenon dubbed \\"Knutmania\\" that spanned the globe and spawned toys, media specials, DVDs, and books. Because of this, the cub was largely responsible for a significant increase in revenue, estimated at about five million euros, at the Berlin Zoo in 2007. On 19 March 2011, Knut unexpectedly died at the age of four. His death was caused by drowning after he collapsed into his enclosure's pool while suffering from encephalitis. * Monarch, a male California grizzly bear, was one of the last wild grizzly bears in California, United States. Monarch was captured in 1889 upon orders of newspaper editor William Randolph Hearst and was put on public display by Hearst at Woodward's Gardens in San Francisco. At the time he was thought to be the largest bear in captivity, and over 20,000 people came to see him on the first day of the exhibit. After his death, his stuffed body was used as the model for the bear on the California state flag. * Old Martin was a large grizzly bear given to George III in 1811 by the Hudson's Bay Company. The bear was sent to join the Royal Menagerie, housed at the Tower of London. Although this was the first grizzly bear in England, the king said he would rather have had been given a new tie or a pair of socks. * Pipaluk, a male polar bear, was the first male polar bear born in captivity in Britain, and, like Brumas, became a major celebrity at Regent's Park Zoo in London during early 1968. His name came from an Inuit term meaning \\"little one\\". Pipaluk was moved from London to Poland in 1985 when the Mappin Terraces, which housed the bears, was closed. He died in 1990. * Siku, a male polar bear, was born in November 2011. Abandoned by his mother, who produced insufficient milk to feed him, he was put into care at Skandinavisk Dyrepark (the Scandinavian Wildlife Park, Denmark). A YouTube video of him became an overnight sensation, and invited comparisons with Knut (polar bear). * Wilb√§r, a male polar bear, was born at the Wilhelma Zoo in Stuttgart, Germany in 2007.

The Mission was launched on 24 November 2005 to monitor operations at the Rafah Border Crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt, in accordance with the Agreed Principles for Rafah Crossing of 15 November 2005, part of the Agreement on Movement and Access (AMA), concluded by Israel and the Palestinian Authority. When the Mission was first deployed, it consisted of roughly 70 personnel including a special security team. On 13 June 2007, following the Hamas take over in the Gaza Strip, the EU BAM Head of Mission declared a temporary suspension of operations at the Crossing because the Palestinian Authority could not provide security for the EU monitors. During the 19 months while the EU monitors were present at the terminal (i.e., from the end of November 2005 until June 2007), a total of nearly 450,000 persons used the crossing, with an average of about 1,500 people a day. Since 2007, the European Union has had a policy of no contact with Hamas. Political background The Rafah Border Crossing is vitally important to the Gaza economy and the viability of any future independent Palestinian state, since it is the Gaza Strip's only border crossing with a country other than Israel. Furthermore, after the withdrawal of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from the Gaza Strip and the subsequent closure of the Rafah Crossing Point (RCP), trade relations with neighboring Egypt were inhibited. Given Israeli security- related concerns about handing over control of the RCP to the Palestinian Authority (possible weapons transfers and uninhibited return of exiled extremist leaders and terrorists), EU BAM Rafah's stated aim is to provide a third party presence in the RCP in order to, in cooperation with the European Commission's institution building efforts, contribute to the opening of the Rafah Crossing Point and to build up confidence between the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Furthermore, the broader political objective is to support the Road Map peace initiative through confidence- building and increasing Palestinian capacity in all aspects of border control. Effective border management will facilitate the movement of goods and persons in and out of the Gaza Strip, thus improving the living conditions of the Palestinians and enhancing the prospects of viability of a Palestinian State, while contributing to the security of Israel. Organisation The EU BAM is a civilian and unarmed Mission, composed mainly of Police, Border Police and Customs officers. It was originally intended to have the Mission in the Gaza Strip in a special-built compound at Rafah Crossing Point (RCP), with the Mission Headquarters in Gaza City. However, due to security, the headquarters is currently based in Tel Aviv, Israel, being previously located in Ashkelon. The Mission also has a field office in Gaza city.FAQs . EU BAM Rafah. Accessed September 2015 The number of personnel has been considerably reduced. Despite the suspension of operations at the RCP in June 2007, EU BAM has maintained its capacity to redeploy to the RCP. The Mission retains its expertise in Border Management and Customs Operations and is regularly approached to share its expertise with other stakeholders involved in the issue of Border and Crossing. The mission is also liaising with the parties on a regular basis and on the operational level. Tasks Tasks of the EU BAM Rafah are: # actively monitor, verify and evaluate the PA's performance with regard to the implementation of the Framework, Security and Customs Agreements concluded between the parties on the operation of the Rafah terminal; # contribute, through mentoring, to building up the Palestinian capacity in all aspects of border management at Rafah. # contribute to the liaison between the Palestinian, Israeli and Egyptian authorities in all aspects regarding the management of the Rafah Crossing Point. The EU considers maintaining the acquis of the AMA and the EU's third party role as important and stands ready to redeploy to the crossing point should the political and security conditions allow. The RCP was opened by Egypt on 28 May 2011 and has been operating outside the scope of the AMA ever since. History Until 2007, EU BAM Rafah monitors would use the Kerem Shalom border crossing to get to the Rafah Border Crossing. The EUBAM headed a Liaison Office at Kerem Shalom which received real-time video and data feeds of activities at the Rafah crossing. The live feed would also be received by Israeli monitors. The Liaison Office met regularly to review implementation of the Agreed Principles for Rafah Crossing, to resolve any dispute pertaining to the agreement, and to perform other tasks specified therein. The Liaison Office was manned by liaison officers from EUBAM, the Palestinian Authority, and the IsraelI government. On 13 June 2007, following the Hamas take over in the Gaza Strip, the EU BAM Head of Mission declared a temporary suspension of operations at the Rafah Crossing Point (RCP). In October 2014, EU BAM Rafah launched its PA Preparedness Project aimed at enhancing the PA capabilities for a quick redeployment to the RCP and PA‚Äôs potential for future operating the RCP. On 1 July 2015, Natalina Cea was appointed Head of EU BAM Rafah by the EU Political and Security Committee.POLITICAL AND SECURITY COMMITTEE DECISION extending the mandate of the Head of Mission of the European Union Border Assistance Mission for the Rafah Crossing Point (EU BAM Rafah) (EU BAM Rafah/1/2016) As of 2015, the Mission was limited manned.

One of the earliest Anglo-Catholic congregations in Canada, it was established in 1874, moving twice before settling into its present building, adjacent to the Annex on the western edge of the University of Toronto's downtown campus. The liturgy and music at St Thomas's make it a \\"destination\\" church. Many people who do not live within the boundaries of the parish attend services. History The church is an Arts and Crafts building designed by architect and parishioner Eden Smith (1858‚Äì1949) and was opened on January 17, 1893. The Memorial First World War Baptistery with Bromsgrove Guild stained glass windows was completed in 1922. The aesthetic theorist and poet T.E. Hulme attended St Thomas's while living in Toronto briefly in 1906 after leaving Cambridge University. He is an important figure in Modernist literature, influencing, among others, Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot. The world- famous English pianist Gerald Moore (1899‚Äì1987) grew up and obtained most of his music education in Toronto. In his early life, he was sub-organist at St Thomas's. The parish's logo was designed by Allan Fleming for its centenary celebrations in 1974. Tradition The church is known for its high standards in music and liturgy, and is nicknamed \\"Smoky Tom's\\" for its use of generous quantities of incense. Liturgy at St Thomas's is more formal and complex than would be encountered in all but a few Canadian Anglican churches today. St Thomas‚Äôs draws from the English high-church tradition within Anglo- Catholicism, as distinct from the Anglo-Papalist branch, which took its inspiration from contemporary Roman Catholicism. This tradition, as former rector Fr. Roy Hoult explains, sought Trinity College and Wycliffe College The church has had a long relationship with Trinity College, and more recently with Wycliffe College. As recently as the late 1930s, Wycliffe banned its students from entering St Thomas's. Currently, however, Wycliffe College not only allows students to attend the church, but they have even placed students at St Thomas's for year-long practicums that are required by the College. Liturgy and Music St Thomas's has two full-time priests (Rector and Associate Priest), who are assisted by honorary associate priests. There is also an Organist and Director of Music. The Rector, the Rev'd Mark Andrews, has served in the dioceses of Saskatchewan and Toronto. Prior to coming to St Thomas's, he was the Rector of St Aidan's, Toronto. As a lay person, Fr. Andrews ran an inner-city day camp at All Saints', Ashmont, Boston. Music is an important part of the liturgy at St Thomas's and the high calibre of the music program attracts people to St Thomas's. From 1989 to 2016, the parish's Organist and Choirmaster was John Tuttle. He was also the founding artistic director of the semi-professional Exultate Chamber Singers and previously directed the Hart House Chorus at the University of Toronto, where he has been the Director of Music at Trinity College since 2009 and University Organist since 1979. The famous English accompanist Gerald Moore, who grew up in Toronto, was a sometime assistant organist at St Thomas's. There are three choral services each Sunday. The choristers are mainly volunteers, with paid section leads. To date, the choir has toured to the U.K. three times (2005, 2010, 2013) to serve as choir-in-residence in cathedrals there during the summer. In August 2017, Matthew Larkin was appointed Organist and Director of Music. He was previously the Organist and Director of Music of Christ Church Cathedral, Ottawa, for 14 years. St Thomas‚Äôs celebrates the Eucharist every day of the year. There are services throughout the week. On Sundays, there is an 8 o'clock said Eucharist, a said Morning Prayer at 10:30, and three sung services: * 9:30 a.m.: A contemporary-language sung Eucharist with the priest facing westward, using the 1985 Book of Alternative Services and the Revised Common Lectionary readings * 11 a.m.: A traditional-language eastward-facing Solemn High Mass, using a re-ordered version of the 1962 Prayer Book, and the Revised Common Lectionary readings * 7 p.m.: Solemn Evensong using the 1962 Prayer Book, and Devotions to the Blessed Sacrament. Major Feast Days are usually observed with one or two said Eucharists during the day and a Procession and Solemn Eucharist at 6.15 pm, sometimes followed by a parish supper. The service leaflets and service music are posted on the church's website. Culture St Thomas's publishes a newsletter, The Thurible from time to time. The parish sponsors a Friday Food Ministry program and operates a \\"community garden.\\" All are supported by volunteers from the parish and the community. It also hosts meetings of the Society of Mary and the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament. Many St Thomas's parishioners are active as performers, writers, and artists, and the church has participated in events like Nuit Blanche and Doors Open Toronto. For three years, St Thomas's presented the Gene Stewart Lecture to honour the late Gene Stewart, a long- time and much-beloved parishioner and past warden. Rom√©o Dallaire was the inaugural guest speaker in February 2008. Subsequent speakers were Roberta Bondar (2009) and Anna Porter (2010). Christian Education On Sunday mornings, there is a small church school and a nursery school. The church also conducts an adult Christian Education program, including programs targeted to young adults, Bible study series during the Lent and Advent seasons, discussion groups, and occasional film series. From 2006 to 2015, there was also an active St Elmo's Youth Group; some of its members have gone on to serve as choristers and acolytes. Podcast In October 2006, the parish podcast Smoky Times was launched. Podcasting of services (primarily the Sunday services of 11:00 am Mass and 7:00 pm Evensong) began in April 2007.

Plot The film emphasizes Mary's importance in Jesus's life, suggesting that his parables were inspired by stories she told him in his childhood. This, and similar details about Jesus's upbringing, cannot be confirmed, but are certainly not impossible. The resurrected Jesus also appears to his mother privately. This event is not found in the Gospels, but is probably based on an ancient Catholic tradition (not official teaching) that he appeared to her first of all people. The tradition influenced Ignatius of Loyola's Spiritual Exercises among others. The film closes with Mary suggesting the disciples should start preaching about her son. Production It stars Swedish actresses Pernilla August and Melinda Kinnaman as Mary, English actor David Threlfall as Joseph and British actor Christian Bale as Jesus.

It is a ministry in collaboration with the Cathedral Church of St. James. Located in the Regent Park area of Toronto, the congregation operates several outreach programmes. It is an Anglo-Catholic parish maintaining 'Full Catholic Privileges'. History St Bartholomew's Episcopal Mission Church was founded in 1873 as a mission of All Saints, Sherbourne Street. The architect was Walter Reginald Strickland. St Bartholomew's Church stood until 1910 at the end of Beech Street (now Dundas Street East) on the east side of River Street. The parish of St Matthew's, Riverdale, in its turn, began life as a mission of St Bartholomew's in 1874. A second mission church, St Augustine's, was established on the corner of Spruce and Parliament streets in Cabbagetown in 1888. It became an independent parish in 1905 and was destroyed by fire in 1931. In 1910, the parish church was moved to its present location at the corner of Dundas and Regent streets to make way for the Dundas Street bridge. The structure was pulled west by a team of horses to Parliament Street. While numbers and finances declined just before and during the First World War, two lay guilds, the St Bartholomew's Association (a parish society for the advancement of the spiritual life) and a chapter of the Brotherhood of St. Andrew, appear to have flourished. Fr Pashler (Rector, 1925-1959) with Fr Jack Adam (left) and Fr Gilbody (right) Unlike certain other Toronto parishes of the same era, such as St. Mary Magdalene's, St Thomas's, Huron Street, and St. Matthias, Bellwoods, St Bart's was not an Anglo-Catholic foundation. The first Anglo-Catholic rector of St Bartholomew's was Charles Fredrick Pashler. A veteran of the First World War, who had been severely wounded at Monchy in August 1918, Pashler was influenced not only by the Tractarian and Ritualist movements of the Church of England, but also by the simple Roman Catholic piety he had witnessed in rural France: \\"the kindliness and unaffected piety of the people, the natural practice of their religion, the soutane-clad figures of their pastors in the village streets and country lanes\\" were all to have their influence on his ministry. Pashler was \\"unique among Toronto priests\\" of his generation \\"inasmuch as he always and everywhere wore his cassock, in and out of season\\" (a common practice on the Continent and in Anglo-Catholic parishes in England at the time). In the face of some opposition, especially from members of the nearby Jarvis Street Baptist Church, Pashler was able to introduce weekly, and very soon daily, celebrations, early on in his incumbency. The use of eucharistic vestments, altar candles, and incense were all soon to follow. Pashler's Anglo-Catholic principles were both simple and clear: Pashler died suddenly in 1959. The love of his people for him can be gauged by the City of Toronto's renaming of the street on which the Clergy House stood as 'Pashler Avenue'. Celebrants from other Anglo-Catholic parishes and Trinity College, Toronto, ensured that the daily Mass continued until his successor was appointed. In the fall of 1959, Donald F. Bellway, who had been an assistant priest at St James, Vancouver, arrived as the new rector. The years of his incumbency were dominated by the emerging social problems of the newly built Regent Park public housing project. A series of consultations took place to investigate the possibility of whether the Anglican Diocese, the parish, other Christian denominations, and secular groups might co-operate in finding solutions. Bellway was the prime mover in these discussions, which paved the way for much church and community co-operation for the next quarter of a century. Bellway was succeeded, in 1977, by Robert Greene. A former tank gunner of the Italian Campaign, whose great heroes were the Ritualist slum priests of the late- nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, Greene carried on the work of inner- city co-operation between church and community that Father Bellway had begun. As social problems became more acute through the 1970s and 1980s, several new initiatives were undertaken. A food bank was run out of the basement of the rectory (as it was now being called); two breakfast soup kitchens were set up with the collaboration of a local police sergeant and a staff of volunteers from the parish and St James Cathedral. An indefatigable visitor, Greene continuously visited his way through the parish list and around Regent Park; he also undertook a visitation ministry to the Don Jail. St Bartholomew's Anglican Church, Regent Park In June 1986, Greene's work was recognized by Mother Teresa of Calcutta, who visited the rectory and toured Regent Park with the rector. Today, St Bartholomew's stands in the midst of a major urban revitalization project. In 2012, the then-Dean of St James Cathedral, Douglas Stoute, suggested to the Archbishop of Toronto, Colin Johnson, that the cathedral and diocese should support St Bartholomew's, to help ensure that the parish might re-engage with its community in a time of transition. The parish remains a ministry in collaboration with St James Cathedral. Liturgy St Bartholomew's is an Anglo-Catholic parish and follows the Rite of the 1959 Canadian revision of the Book of Common Prayer with additions from Anglo- Catholic service books such as the Plainchant Gradual, the English Gradual, the Anglican Missal, and the Monastic Diurnal Noted. The ceremonial is that of the Western Rite. A Solemn or Sung Mass preceded by the Asperges and followed by the Angelus is celebrated every Sunday of the year. A Solemn Mass with Procession is sung on many major Feast Days. Low Mass at the Lady AltarLow Mass is celebrated daily from Tuesday to Saturday. From Tuesday through Friday, morning and evening prayer are recited in the Lady Chapel according to the 1959 Canadian Book of Common Prayer. Solemn Evensong, followed by Benediction or the Rosary, is sung weekly on Saturday evenings. Music Healey Willan was a frequent visitor to the Clergy House at St Bartholomew's during the tenure of his student, Alex Shaw (1929‚Äì1963), as Choir Master. After the death of Pashler, Shaw became Organist and Choir Master of . Shaw's successor, Walter Barnes (1963‚Äì1984), had been a prot√©g√© of Willan's student, Walter McNutt, Choir Master at St Thomas's, Huron Street. During Barnes's tenure, the well-known St Bart's Boys' Choir toured widely, including performances at Expo 67, and recorded two long play records on the Arc label. The parish's current Cantrix and Choir Director, Katherine Hill, is a mediaevalist, singer, and multi-instrumentalist, who performs with the Toronto Consort. The parish organist, Sebastian Moreno, is a student of Stephanie Martin and John Tuttle, former organists of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene and St Thomas's, Huron Street, respectively. Catholic devotion at St Bartholomew's St Bartholomew's has many regular corporate devotions. A Holy Hour (eucharistic adoration) is held weekly on Friday evenings (Thursdays in Lent). The Stations of the Cross are held weekly in Lent and more frequently during Holy Week. The Holy Rosary is recited twice weekly throughout the year. St Bartholomew's currently has a parish branch of the Guild of All Souls (American Branch) under the patronage of Our Lady of Solitude and St Dismas. Historically, the parish once had a cell of the Society of the Holy House at Walsingham, as well as a parish ward of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament. Some current parishioners regularly attend meetings of the Toronto Ward of the Society of Mary. St Bartholomew's holds an annual May Procession, Solemn Mass of Our Lady, and May Crowning as part of the Society of Mary's May Festival. Confessions are currently heard weekly, after Saturday evensong, and by appointment. Parish outreach programmes The parish has four major outreach programmes, all of which are fundamentally food ministries: *A breakfast ministry on Thursday mornings providing approximately 200 hot meals each week. ‚Ä¢A Saturday afternoon drop-in ministry, serving between 70 and 100 homecooked meals each week. *A food bank that operates Monday and Thursday mornings. *A Christmas outreach that provides food and toy vouchers to local families. Children's centre The St Bartholomew's Children's Centre operates from the parish hall. The centre has programmes \\"designed for a multicultural community, enabling children to experience\\" Regent Park's \\"rich cultures\\" and to \\"develop the social skills that will make them successful in life and help them to excel in school.\\" Parish priests of St Bartholomew's * Arthur Baldwin ‚Äì Acting Rector, 1873‚Äì1874 * John McLean ‚Äì Rector, 1874‚Äì1878 * George Irwin Taylor ‚Äì Rector, 1878‚Äì1914 * Oswald Rigby ‚Äì Vicar, 1914‚Äì1919 * George B.

Responsible at that stage for all flight instruction of air cadets, its aircraft initially included one Avro Anson, two De Havilland Tiger Moths, and 55 CAC Wirraways.RAAF Historical Section, Units of the Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 38‚Äì39Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 145‚Äì146 In response to demands for more aircrew to fulfil Australia's commitments to the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, RAAF flying training underwent significant change in 1951‚Äì52. No. 1 Initial Flying Training School was raised at Archerfield, Queensland, to impart students with general aeronautical and military knowledge, after which they received flight grading on Tiger Moths. Graduates went on to the newly formed No. 1 Basic Flying Training School (No. 1 BFTS) at Uranquinty, New South Wales, where they underwent further instruction, first on Tiger Moths and then on Wirraways. Finally they transferred to No. 1 FTS, which was renamed No. 1 Applied Flying Training School (No. 1 AFTS) in March 1952, for advanced instruction and combat training on Wirraways.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 199‚Äì200 In May 1958, No. 1 AFTS relocated to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, to re-equip with De Havilland Vampire jet trainers. Pearce's long runway made it more suitable for jet operations than the airfield at Point Cook.RAAF Historical Section, Units of the Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 40‚Äì42 No. 1 AFTS's place at Point Cook was taken by No. 1 BFTS, which transferred from Uranquinty. Fourteen Vampires were delivered to Pearce by July, and all fourteen students on the first course at No. 1 AFTS graduated at the end of the year, making them the first RAAF cadets to do so on jet aircraft. In addition to flying training, the school was responsible for search and rescue operations off the West Australian coast, utilising C-47 Dakotas that were later augmented by a UH-1 Iroquois helicopter. By the mid-1960s, the aging Vampires were increasingly prone to system failures and the RAAF began evaluating replacements. A team led by Air Commodore Brian Eaton selected the Italian Macchi MB-326H as the RAAF's new jet trainer, as it met all requirements, could be licence-built by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in Australia, and was relatively inexpensive.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 161‚Äì163 It began replacing the Vampires of No. 1 AFTS in May 1968.DHA Vampire at RAAF Museum.

At the same time, No. 1 BFTS was disbanded at Point Cook and reformed there as No. 1 FTS. The first Macchi course at No. 2 FTS graduated in September the same year. By this time the Vampires had all been retired and ground staff were fully dedicated to work on the Italian jets, which nevertheless proved a more challenging proposition to maintain than its predecessor. The introduction of the Macchi led to a brief flirtation with \\"all-through jet training\\" in the Air Force between 1969 and 1971, as it was expected to reduce the time necessary to turn out high-quality aviators. The practice was dropped after ten courses, being labelled \\"an expensive way of finding out that some pupils lacked the aptitude to become military pilots\\".

On the West bank of the River Itchen, it shares borders with St Mary's, Bitterne and Bevois Valley. Beside the border with St Mary's is the Chapel area, which has been home to some recent apartment building developments in Northam. The A3024 road runs through the suburb and crosses the Northam Bridge, which links Northam with Bitterne via Bitterne Manor. Although St Mary's Stadium takes its name from the neighbouring St Mary's, the stadium itself is in Northam, and home to Southampton F.C.. History The Northam Railway Bridge was constructed in 1908 and the first Northam Road Bridge was built in 1796. The original bridge was made of wood. During Victorian times, much of Southampton's industry was based around the banks of the Itchen, and Northam was home to the Summers and Day iron works. Summers and Day launched the first iron ship to be built on the Itchen in 1842. Steamship companies (such as the White Star Line and the Cunard Line) were major employers in the district in the early 20th century. Over 350 Northam residents died aboard RMS Titanic when it foundered off the coast of Newfoundland in 1912; 125 students at one school alone were orphaned.Titanic Voices by Donald Hyslop et al. Published by Southampton City Council, 1994. In the early to mid 20th century the road bridge was rebuilt and strengthened, reopening in 1954. Around the same time and into the 1960s, much of the current Northam Estate was built to replace the slum conditions that had existed until that time. In 1965, further work was undertaken on the A3024, the dual carriageway which runs through Northam, to coincide with the opening of the M27 motorway. Aside from Millbank House, which forms part of the housing estate, one of the most dominant buildings in Northam is the Augustine Centre. The building was originally a Church of England church, and subsequently home to Northam Pentecostal Church. It was purchased by Riverside Family Church in the early 1980s and given its new name. The building is a Grade II listed building.Southampton City Council: Listed buildings in Southampton Accessed 13 September 2007. The London and South Western Railway opened a large Motive Power Depot at Northam in 1840, which remained the principal locomotive servicing facility in the area until 1903 when it was replaced by a new depot at Eastleigh. In 2001, South West Trains chose Northam as the location for the maintenance facility for their new Desiro fleet of trains, which replaced the last slam-door trains to run on the network. The Northam Traincare Facility was constructed by Turner & Townsend and opened in July 2003 by Brian Souter. Television Centre, Southampton The television studios, demolished in 2009 Northam was home to Television Centre, Southampton, run by ITV franchises Meridian Broadcasting, TVS and Southern Television, before Meridian moved their operations to Whiteley. The complex was demolished in 2009, leaving just a large, neat pile of rubble still extant throughout 2010. As well as the regional news magazine programme Meridian Tonight, the studios were originally home to the very first series of the popular game show, Catchphrase (before it moved to Maidstone Studios) and handled transmission of Meridian, Anglia and HTV West.

It is famous for its association with composer Healey Willan, who was organist and choir-master for well over four decades. In 2013, SMM celebrated its 125th anniversary. Theology As an Anglo-Catholic parish, St. Mary Magdalene's has always celebrated the Eucharist as the central act of worship. This has historically been done at St. Mary Magdalene's in a liturgical style reflecting the convergence of Roman Catholic and Anglican influences. In 1919, the church shifted more towards Roman-style parish life: the Rev'd H. Griffin Hiscocks began hearing private confession. Statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary at the Church of St. Mary MagdaleneThis period also ushered in the use of incense and the installation of a large statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary (now in the south aisle of the church). Newspaper accounts of the time reveal how controversial the installation was. A chip in the statue's toe shows evidence of a hammer attack made by those hostile to St. Mary Magdalene's Catholic spirituality. Founding and development The church, nicknamed \\"SMM\\" or \\"St. Mary Mag\\", was founded in 1888 by a group from the nearby Church of St. Matthias led by the Reverend Charles Darling. The church's somewhat unusual choice for a patron was probably an homage to the Church of St Mary Magdalene, Paddington, where Darling had served as assistant. The church building was designed by the rector's brothernoted Toronto architect Frank Darling. However, his ambitious plans were tempered by the always modest financial resources of the parish. The exterior was begun in 1888, added to in 1896 and completed in 1908. The choir loft was added in the 1920s. The sanctuary was extensively remodeled in 1963 by Rambush & Company of New York. In 1993 a substantial addition to the building added spaces for instruction, meeting, and church administration. In 2008, another renovation to the liturgical space opened up windows that had been closed in the 1920s. \\"When the Rev'd Canon Eugene Fairweather became priest-in-charge in 1966, St Mary Magdalene's became one of the first Anglican churches in Canada whose priests [celebrated] the Solemn Mass facing the people\\", as Roman Catholics were generally ordered by the Second Vatican Council. \\"In 1967 the Rev'd Mountain \\"Monty\\" Hutt became rector...[and] organized the first outdoor procession of the Blessed Sacrament in 1974.\\" Church of St. Mary Magdalene outdoor procession of the Blessed Sacrament, Corpus Christi 2019 Among other causes of fame of the parish during his time was his being the brother of William Hutt, an actor in the Stratford Festival who also toured nationally and internationally.Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia. Hutt, William. Athabasca University. Retrieved on: May 14, 2008. Over the years, St. Mary Magdalene's has accumulated other pieces of sacred art. A magnificent Rood Cross hangs from the chancel arch to commemorate the parish war dead of World War I. It was designed by architect William Rae, modelled by Frances Loring and originally painted by Frank Johnston (one of the Group of Seven). Sylvia Hahn painted a pastoral scene of a young Jesus in the north aisle. Hahn also painted the triptych behind the Lady Altar in the south aisle. Devotional stations with statues of St. Benedict, St. Joseph, St. Mary Magdalene and others are spread throughout the church. A modern painting by Lynn Donoghue hanging near the baptismal font explores the challenges of faith in the modern age. Music Healy Willan in 1918 St. Mary Magdalene's is particularly well known for excellence in sacred music. In 1940, Robertson Davies reported in the magazine Saturday Night that there were only two things worth doing in Toronto: seeing the Chinese Collection at the Royal Ontario Museum and listening to St. Mary Magdalene's choirs. This owed much to the work of Healey Willan, who came to the parish in 1921 and remained as the organist and choirmaster until shortly before his death in 1968. Willan composed music for St. Mary Magdalene's liturgies and performance elsewhere that have lasting use and influence. He was at one time best known internationally as the only composer outside England who was asked for and provided music for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.Bousfield, Arthur; Toffoli, Gary (2002). Fifty Years the Queen. Toronto: Dundurn Press. p. 98. . He was also an accomplished organist famous for his improvisational skill. He once remarked, \\"You have a sense of home, absolute completion... doing the work you want to do and the work you feel you can do.\\" Composer Stephanie Martin, who served as music director and organist from 2007 to 2012, commented \\"The choir there did not simply rehearse Thursday and sing Sunday. They were a highly skilled and extremely dedicated team.\\" The church of St Mary Magdalene (Toronto) set up for Tenebrae during Holy Week This legacy of excellence in sacred music is demonstrated by the fact that the musical services of Tenebrae celebrated in Holy Week are the best attended services of the year. One distinctive characteristic of the music tradition at SMM is the division of the choir into a \\"Gallery Choir\\" which sings polyphonic music from a balcony in the west end of the church and a \\"Ritual Choir\\" that specializes in performing Gregorian Chant from choir stalls in the chancel. Variety of worship A variety of worship takes place at SMM: daily Masses, Morning Prayer, and Evening Prayer, as well as Solemn Masses on Sundays and important feasts of the Christian calendar. Far from being limited to traditional language liturgies, however, the parish also celebrates contemporary language liturgies based on the Canadian Book of Alternative Services. SMM's role in the development of liturgy in the Anglican Church of Canada can also be seen in claim that the \\"reordered\\" 1962 Eucharistic Rite contained in the BAS was partially inspired by developments at SMM. For some time the parish had experimented by literally cutting and pasting pages of the Canadian Book of Common Prayer into the Anglican Missal. The resulting \\"reordered rite\\" combined the sequence of Roman usage, Canadian BCP prayers, and supplemental liturgical material (e.g. minor propers) from more ancient sources. Cultural references SMM was part of the composite that Robertson Davies used to form \\"St. Aidan's\\" in his novel The Cunning Man. Davies attended Mass there while still a Presbyterian and a student at Upper Canada College. The church is also mentioned in Marian Engel's \\"The Glassy Sea\\". Notable people On 3 July 1989, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother visited, participated in the Solemn Mass and unveiled a national historic plaque to the memory of Healey Willan.

She was the author of a memoir entitled This I Cannot Forget. Biography Anna Larina was born in 1914. She was adopted by Yuri Larin, so she grew up amongst professional revolutionaries who were very high up in the Soviet Union. As a young girl, she came to know Bukharin, who was 26 years her senior, and she constantly wrote girlish love notes to him. She married Bukharin in 1934 and they had a son, Yuri, in 1936. In 1937, when her son was less than one year old, she was separated from him for almost 20 years when the NKVD came and arrested her. In 1937, there were accusations against Bukharin for spying, attempting to dismember the Soviet Union, organising kulak uprisings, plotting to murder Joseph Stalin and attempting mysterious acts towards Vladimir Lenin in the past. Bukharin never understood why he was being slandered but was mentally and psychologically prepared for death. Before they were separated, Bukharin instructed his wife to memorise his final testament (knowing that it would be suppressed by Stalin) in which he implored future generations of communist leaders to exonerate him. Not daring to write it down, she later recalled, she used to lull herself to sleep in prison by repeating her husband's words silently to herself \\"like a prayer.\\" It was not published in full until 1988. Anna was first sent into exile and then arrested on 5 September 1938 and taken to Astrakhan. \\"In December 1938, I was returning to an 'investigative prison' in Moscow following a year and a half of arrests and imprisonments. First came exile Astrakhan, then arrest and imprisonment there; next, I was sent to a camp in Tomsk for family members of so-called enemies of the people; on the way, I was held in transit cells in Saratov and Sverdlovsk; after several months in Tomsk, I was arrested a second time and sent to an isolation prison in Novosibirsk; from Novosibirsk, I was transferred to a prison near Kemerovo, where after three months I was taken out and put on the train for Moscow.‚Äù In Larina's memoir, she wrote mostly about her first year in the Gulag, even though she was in the Gulag for a total of 20 years. Since Anna was the wife of Bukharin, she was constantly under close surveillance and was not allowed out to perform labor. Instead, much of her time was spent dealing with the grinding boredom of doing nothing. \\"By this time, I was an experienced zek (prisoner), having already been detained in many prisons: Astrakhan, Saratov, Sverdlovsk, Tomsk, Novosibirsk. I had become accustomed to an isolated existence without books, paper, or pencil, unable to do anything but string together rhymes and memorize them by endless repetition, read from memory the verses of my favorite poets\\". While in the Gulag, Anna communicated with others by tapping on the walls of their cells. Through this, Anna found out that her husband had been killed. ‚Äú'The bastards murdered Bukharin,‚Äô I heard again, and my doubts faded away. Every single letter of his sentence, like a metal weight, banged into my brain. Although it would be best to cut off the conversation, since I still feared this might be provocation, the temptation was too great. I had a passionate desire to find out as much as I could. During the following days, I grew attached to this condemned man who knew the true story of the trials and loved Nikolai Bartunek still. In the evenings, listening to his distinct tapping on the wall, I could not reconcile the firm even tap of his hand with the death sentence. When I heard his last words I was deeply shaken\\". Twenty years of her life were spent in prison, exile and labour camps. During this time, Anna met her second husband, Fyodor Fadeyev. Her second husband was arrested several times because of Anna and died in 1959. She had two children with Fyodor: Mikhail and Nadia.

He was finally \\"rehabilitated\\" and cleared of all charges in 1988 ‚Äì fifty years after his death.

She also wrote film, radio and television scripts. As a student at the Royal Academy of Music in London, Brahms was dissatisfied with her own skill as a pianist, leaving without graduating. She contributed light verse, and later stories for satirical cartoons, to the London paper The Evening Standard in the late 1920s. She recruited a friend, S. J. Simon, to help her with the cartoon stories, and in the 1930s and 40s they collaborated on a series of comic novels, some with a balletic background and others set in various periods of English history. At the same time as her collaboration with Simon, Brahms was a ballet critic, writing for papers including The Daily Telegraph. Later, her interest in ballet waned, and she concentrated on reviewing plays. After Simon's sudden death in 1948, Brahms wrote solo for some years, but in the 1950s she established a second long-running collaboration with the writer and broadcaster Ned Sherrin, which lasted for the rest of her life. Together they wrote plays and musicals for the stage and television, and published both fiction and non-fiction books. Life and career=Early years= Brahms was born in Croydon, Surrey. Her parents were Henry Clarence Abrahams, a jeweller, and his wife, Pearl n√©e Levi, a member of a Sephardic Jewish family who had come to Britain from the Ottoman Empire a generation earlier.Sherrin, Ned. \\"Abrahams, Doris Caroline [Caryl Brahms (1901‚Äì1982)\\"], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 24 September 2011 She was educated at Minerva College, Leicestershire and at the Royal Academy of Music, where she left before graduating. Her biographer Ned Sherrin wrote, \\"already an embryo critic, she did not care to listen to the noise she made when playing the piano.\\" While at the Academy, Brahms wrote light verse for the student magazine. The London evening newspaper The Evening Standard began to print some of her verses. Brahms adopted her pen-name so that her parents should not learn of her activities: they envisaged \\"a more domestic future\\" for her than journalism. The name \\"Caryl\\" was also usefully ambiguous as regards gender.Raphael, Frederick, \\"Writing in pairs\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 6 June 1986, p. 609 In 1926, the artist David Low began to draw a series of satirical cartoons for The Evening Standard, featuring a small dog named \\"Mussolini\\" (later shortened to \\"Musso\\", after protests from the Italian embassy). Brahms was engaged to write the stories for the cartoons.Watts, Janet. \\"Another helping of Stroganoff\\", The Guardian, 16 August 1975, p. 8 In 1930, Brahms published a volume of poems for children, The Moon on My Left, illustrated by Anna Zinkeisen. The Times Literary Supplement judged the verses to be in the tradition of A. A. Milne, \\"but the disciple's gift is too frequently spoiled by her lack of control. She uses too many capital letters, and too many exclamation marks, too many round O's in long chains, and she is too facetious\\".\\"Rhyme Stories\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 20 November 1930, p. 965 The reviewer quoted with approval an extract from one of her poems, a child's thoughts by candlelight: :I like things round, :I like the moon, :And the smooth inside :Of a silver spoon; :I like pennies ‚Äì :And Sixpence too ‚Äì :I LIKE things round ‚Äì ::Don't you? This was followed the next year by a second volume, Sung Before Six, published under a different pen- name, Oliver Linden.\\"Doris Caroline Abrahams\\", Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, 2003, accessed 24 September 2011 She reverted to her more familiar pseudonym for a third volume, Curiouser and Curiouser, published in 1932. =Brahms and Simon= Towards the end of the 1920s, finding it difficult to keep up the supply of new stories for Low's cartoon series, Brahms enlisted the help of a Russian friend, S. J. Simon, whom she had met at a hostel when they were both students. The partnership was successful, and Brahms and Simon started to write comic thrillers together. The first, A Bullet in the Ballet, had its genesis in a frivolous fantasy spun by the collaborators when Brahms was deputising for Arnold Haskell as dance critic of The Daily Telegraph. Brahms proposed a murder mystery set in the ballet world with Haskell as the corpse. Simon took the suggestion as a joke, but Brahms insisted that they press ahead with the plot (although Haskell was not a victim in the finished work). The book introduced the phlegmatic Inspector Adam Quill and the excitable members of Vladimir Stroganoff's ballet company, who later reappeared in three more books between 1938 and 1945. Some thought that Stroganoff was based on the impresario Sergei Diaghilev, but Brahms pointed out that Diaghilev appears briefly in the novels in his own right, and she said of Stroganoff, \\"Suddenly he was there. I used to have the impression that he wrote us, rather than that we wrote him.\\" Before the novel was complete, Brahms published her first prose book, Footnotes to the Ballet (1936), a symposium edited (or as the title page read \\"assembled\\") by Brahms, with contributors including Haskell, Constant Lambert, Alexandre Benois, Anthony Asquith and Lydia Sokolova. The book was well received; the anonymous Times Literary Supplement (TLS) reviewer singled out Brahms's own contributions for particular praise.\\"Thirty Years of Ballet\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 23 May 1936, p. 431 The reception of A Bullet in the Ballet the following year was even warmer. In the TLS, David Murray wrote that the book provoked \\"continuous laughter. ‚Ä¶ Old Stroganoff with his troubles, artistic, amorous and financial, his shiftiness, and his perpetual anxiety about the visit of the great veteran of ballet-designers ‚Äì 'if 'e come', is a vital creation. ... The book stands out for shockingness and merriment.\\"\\"A Bullet in the Ballet\\", Times Literary Supplement, 26 June 1937, p. 480 The sexual entanglements, both straight and gay, of the members of the Ballet Stroganoff are depicted with a cheerful matter-of-factness unusual in the 1930s. Murray commented, \\"True, a certain number of the laughs are invited for a moral subject that people used not to mention with such spade-like explicitness, if at all.\\" In The Observer, \\"Torquemada\\" (Edward Powys Mathers) commented on the \\"sexual reminiscences of infinite variety\\" and called the novel \\"a delicious little satire\\" but \\"not a book for the old girl\\".Torquemada. \\"Handmaids to Murder\\", The Observer, 11 July 1937, p. 7 In the 1980s, Michael Billington praised the writing: \\"a power of language of which Wodehouse would not have been ashamed. As a description of a domineering Russian mother put down by her ballerina daughter, you could hardly better: 'She backed away like a defeated steamroller.'\\"Billington, Michael. \\"Caryl Brahms\\", The Guardian, 6 December 1982, p. 11 The book was a best-seller in the UK, and was published in an American edition by Doubleday.\\"A Bullet in the Ballet\\", Worldcat, accessed 24 September 2011 The authors followed up their success with a sequel, Casino for Sale (1938), featuring all the survivors from the first novel and bringing to the fore Stroganoff's rival impresario, the rich and vulgar Lord Buttonhooke.\\"New Novels\\", The Times, 20 May 1938, p. 10 It was published in the US as Murder √† la Stroganoff. The Elephant is White (1939), tells the story of a young Englishman and the complications arising from his visit to a Russian night club in Paris. It was not well reviewed.Swinnerton, Frank. \\"Limits to credulity\\", The Observer, 27 August 1939, p. 6 A third Stroganoff novel, Envoy on Excursion (1940) was a comic spy-thriller, with Quill now working for British intelligence.\\"New Novels\\", The Times, 18 May 1940, p. 14 In 1940, Brahms and Simon published the first of what they called \\"backstairs history\\", producing their own highly unreliable comic retellings of English history. Don't, Mr. Disraeli! is a Victorian Romeo and Juliet story, with affairs of the feuding middle-class Clutterwick and Shuttleforth families interspersed with 19th-century vignettes (Gilbert and Sullivan at the Savage Club, for example) and anachronistic intruders from the 20th century, including Harpo Marx, John Gielgud and Albert Einstein.Brahms and Simon (1940), pp. 47, 53, 56 and 104 In The Observer, Frank Swinnerton wrote, \\"They turn the Victorian age into phantasmagoria, dodging with the greatest possible nimbleness from the private to the public, skipping among historic scenes, which they often deride, and personal jokes and puns, and telling a ridiculous story while they communicate a preposterous ‚Äì yet strangely suggestive ‚Äì impression of nineteenth-century life.\\"Swinnerton, Frank. \\"Experiments with time\\", The Observer, 10 November 1940, p. 5 Brahms and Simon depict Shakespeare dithering over the spelling of his signature. To follow their Victorian book, Brahms and Simon went back to Elizabethan times, with No Bed for Bacon (1941). Unlike the earlier work, the narrative and allusions are confined to the age in which the book is set. The plot concerns a young woman who disguises herself as a boy to gain membership of Richard Burbage's and William Shakespeare's, theatrical company (a device later employed by Tom Stoppard as the central plot of his 1999 screenplay Shakespeare in Love).Salvador Bello, Mercedes. \\"Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard 1999: Shakespeare in Love (the screenplay)\\", Atlantis XXI (1999), accessed 24 September 2011 Reviewing the book in the Shakespeare Quarterly, Ernest Brennecke wrote: in 1943, Brahms published her first solo prose work, a study of the dancer and choreographer Robert Helpmann. The reviewer in The Musical Times commended it as \\"a good deal more than a tribute to Robert Helpmann ... its enthusiasm is of the informed variety that inspires respect, the more so as it is balanced and sane.\\" Among Brahms's many digressions from the main subject of the book was a section, praised in The Musical Times, explaining why the appropriation of symphonic music for ballet is as unsatisfactory to the ballet purist as to the music lover. Brahms included snippets of overheard remarks, confirming, as the reviewer noted, that \\"ballet audiences are the least musical of all; are they also among the least intelligent?\\"\\"Robert Helpmann, Choreographer by Caryl Brahms\\", The Musical Times, Vol. 85, No. 1211 (1 January 1944), p. 16 Brahms's own enthusiasm for ballet remained intact for the time being, but it was later to dwindle. With Simon, Brahms completed four more novels and a collection of short stories. No Nightingales (1944) is set in a house in Berkeley Square, haunted by two benevolent ghosts coping with new occupants between the reigns of Queen Anne and George V. It was filmed after the war as The Ghosts of Berkeley Square (released on 30 October 1947), starring Robert Morley and Felix Aylmer. Titania has a Mother (1944) is a satirical jumble of pantomime, fairy tales, and nursery rhymes. Six Curtains for Stroganova (1945) was the collaborators' last ballet novel. Trottie True (1946) is a back-stage comedy set in the era of Edwardian musical comedy, which was later filmed. To Hell with Hedda (1947) is a collection of short stories. In 1948, the collaborators had begun work on another book, You Were There, when Simon suddenly died, aged 44. Brahms completed the work, which she described as \\"less a novel than an out-of-date newsreel\\", covering the period from the death of Queen Victoria to 1928. Reviewing the book, Lionel Hale wrote, \\"The vivacity of this raffish chronicle is unflagging.\\"Hale, Lionel. \\"New Novels\\", The Observer, 11 June 1950, p. 7 Collaborations with S J Simon 1937 A Bullet in the Ballet.

Her solo works from this period were A Seat at the Ballet (1951) a guide for newcomers,\\"Ballet-goers' Guide\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 9 November 1951, p. 706 and a melodramatic romantic novel, Away Went Polly (1952), of which the critic Julian Symons wrote, \\"Miss Brahms is perhaps aiming at elegant sophistication; she achieves more often the ecstatically thrilled note of a saleswoman in a high-class dress shop.\\"\\"Drama and Melodrama\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 12 December 1952, p. 813 She expanded her range as a critic to include opera and drama as well as ballet. In 1954, Brahms received a letter from the young Ned Sherrin asking her permission to adapt No Bed for Bacon as a stage musical. Her first reaction was to ring him to prevent him from going any further, but his voice \\"sounded so young and so nice\\" that Brahms gave in. She agreed to collaborate with Sherrin on the adaptation. It was well-reviewed,\\"Engaging Musical Romp\\", The Times, 10 June 1959, p. 7 but was not a box-office success. Nonetheless, in Sherrin's words, \\"it laid the foundation of a partnership which over the next twenty-eight years produced seven books, many radio and television scripts, and several plays and musicals for the theatre.\\" In 1962 they published a novel, Cindy-Ella ‚Äì or, I Gotta Shoe, described in the TLS as \\"a charming, sophisticated fairy-tale ‚Ä¶ retelling the Cinderella story rather as a coloured New Orleans mother might tell it to her (precocious) daughter\\".\\"Humour and Fantasy\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 14 December 1962, p. 978 It was based on a radio play that Brahms and Sherrin had written in 1957. At the end of 1962 they adapted it again, as a stage musical, starring Cleo Laine, Elisabeth Welch and Cy Grant.\\"An Epic Theatre Cinderella\\", The Times, 18 December 1962, p. 5 In 1963, Brahms published her second solo novel, No Castanets, a gently humorous work about the Braganza empire in Brazil.\\"W. H. Allen\\", The Times, 11 April 1963, p. 15 When Sherrin became a television producer in the 1960s, he and Brahms always wrote the weekly topical opening number for the ground- breaking satirical show That Was The Week That Was and its successors. Their collaboration won them the Ivor Novello award for the best screen song. By the 1960s, Brahms's enthusiasm for ballet was waning. She later commented, \\"Really I've left the ballet behind me because I became very bored with watching the girl in the third row moving forward to be in the second row; and when you have lost that feeling, you are no longer the person to write about ballet.\\" Her professional focus, both as a critic and as an author, was increasingly the theatre. Privately, her enthusiasm for ballet transferred itself to show- jumping, of which she became a devotee. With Sherrin, Brahms wrote and adapted prolifically for the theatre and television. Their collaborations included Benbow Was His Name, televised in 1964, staged in 1969; The Spoils (adapted from Henry James's The Spoils of Poynton), 1968; Sing a Rude Song, a musical biography of Marie Lloyd, 1969; adaptations of farces by Georges Feydeau, Fish Out of Water, 1971, and Paying the Piper (1972); a Charles Dickens play, Nickleby and Me, 1975; Beecham, 1980, a celebration of the great conductor; and The Mitford Girls, 1981. For BBC television, they adapted a long sequence of Feydeau farces between 1968 and 1973 under the series title Ooh! La-la! She was a member of the board of the National Theatre from 1974 until her death. As a critic and columnist, Brahms wrote for many publications, principally The Evening Standard. She included an account of her theatrical experiences in a book of memoirs, The Rest of the Evening's My Own (1964), and left a second volume of reminiscences unfinished at her death, which Sherrin edited and augmented as Too Dirty for the Windmill (1986). For television the collaborators devised a series of programmes about songs from musicals, on which they later based a book, Song by Song ‚Äì Fourteen Great Lyric Writers (1984) published after Brahms's death. Last years In 1975, Brahms published a study of Gilbert and Sullivan and their works. The book was lavishly illustrated, but her text, marred by numerous factual errors,For example, rendering Selina Dolaro as \\"Doloro\\", Helen Lenoir as \\"Lenoire\\" and Sir George Macfarren as \\"Macfarlane\\", wrongly describing the peers in Iolanthe as \\"scarlet-trained\\" and repeating a myth that The Mikado was inspired when a Japanese sword fell from the wall of Gilbert's study: see Brahms (1975), pp. 64, 100, 125, 122 and 137, and merely confused the subject. In The Guardian, Stephen Dixon wrote that Brahms \\"manages to coast over the fact that we've heard it all before by going off at entertaining tangents in a series of anecdotes, personal interpolations, witty irrelevancies and theories.\\"Dixon, Stephen. \\"Regular rummy old world\\", The Guardian, 29 January 1976, p. 9 The following year, she published Reflections in a Lake: A Study of Chekhov's Greatest Plays. Among her last works of fiction were new short stories about Stroganoff, included in her collection Stroganoff in Company (1980), which also included some stories developed from ideas jotted down by Anton Chekhov in his notebooks. The reviewer of the TLS welcomed the reappearance of Stroganoff and judged the Chekhov stories \\"impressive in their evocation of another era and in their tribute to a more serious and formal art.\\"\\"High and low\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 19 September 1980, p. 1047 Brahms never married. Frederic Raphael notes that \\"her one true love\\", Jack Bergel, was killed in the Second World War. She died at her flat in Regent's Park, London aged 80.

This can be done by physically pulling the wires apart or through chemical etching or electromigration. As the wire breaks, the separation between the electrodes can be indirectly controlled by monitoring the electrical resistance of the junction. After the gap is formed, its width can often be controlled by bending the substrate that the metal contacts lie on. The gap can be controlled to a precision of picometers. A typical conductance versus time trace during the breaking process (conductance is simply current divided by applied voltage bias) shows two regimes. First is a regime where the break junction comprises a quantum point contact. In this regime conductance decreases in steps equal to the conductance quantum G_Q=2e^2/h which is expressed through the electron charge (‚àíe) and Planck's constant h. The conductance quantum has a value of 7.74√ó10‚àí5 siemens, corresponding to a resistance increase of roughly 12.9 kŒ©. These step decreases are interpreted as the result of a decrease, as the electrodes are pulled apart, in the number of single-atom-wide metal strands bridging between the two electrodes, each strand having a conductance equal to the quantum of conductance. As the wire is pulled, the neck becomes thinner with fewer atomic strands in it. Each time the neck reconfigures, which happens abruptly, a step-like decrease of the conductance can be observed. This picture inferred from the current measurement has been confirmed by \\"in-situ\\" TEM imaging of the breaking process combined with current measurement. In a second regime, when the wire is pulled further apart, the conductance collapses to values less than the quantum of conductance. This is known as the tunneling regime where electrons tunnel through vacuums between the electrodes.  Use  Break junctions are used to make electrical contacts to study single molecules.

The City criticized Weinstock for his financial caution but after he retired as managing director in 1996, under his successor a series of ill-judged acquisitions led to catastrophic losses. Early life Born in Stoke Newington, Hackney, London, the son of working class Polish-Jewish immigrants Golda () and Simon Weinstock, Arnold Weinstock was educated at the London School of Economics. Career He was a junior administrative officer in the Admiralty in the period 1944‚Äì1947. In 1949, he married Netta Sobell, the daughter of industrialist Michael Sobell. The couple had two children, Simon (1952‚Äì1996) and Susan (b 1955). Lady Weinstock died in 2019.Weinstock In 1954 he joined his father-in law's electronics company, Radio & Allied Industries Ltd., and in 1963 orchestrated its merger with the General Electric Company, becoming the largest shareholder of GEC. He served as a member of the board of directors from 1961 to 1963 and was managing director from 1963 to 1996, thence chairman Emeritus. He transformed the firm, raising its turnover from ¬£100m in 1960 to ¬£11bn at his retirement in 1996. He was a director of Rolls- Royce (1971) Ltd from 1971 to 1973. He was a significant investor in London Weekend Television at its launch in 1968. He was Vice-President of the Friends of the Ravenna Festival (1993‚Äì1994), a trustee of the British Museum (1985‚Äì1996), the Royal Philharmonic Society and the Foundation Fund (1984‚Äì1992). He became a friend of the conductor Riccardo Muti, whose recordings he chose on the Desert Island Discs radio programme. He was also senior trustee of the Next Century Foundation, a peace process organisation he helped establish. He established the Weinstock Fund, a charitable foundation that supports a variety of benevolent and cultural causes. He became an Honorary Fellow of his alma mater, LSE, in 1985. The Guardian newspaper called him \\"Britain's premier post-second-world-war industrialist.\\" He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1970 Birthday Honours for services to export and was created a life peer in the 1980 Birthday Honours as Baron Weinstock, of Bowden in the County of Wiltshire on 17 July 1980. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society, an Honorary Fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge (from 1982), and an Honorary Bencher of Gray's Inn (from 1982). He became a Commander of the Ordine al Merito of Italy in 1991 and an Officer of the Legion of Honour of France in 1992.

DTech Loughborough, 1981; DUniv Anglia Poly., 1994; Hon. DEconSc London, 1997. Horse racing A member of the Jockey Club, Weinstock owned a number of thoroughbred racehorses. He and his father-in-law, Michael Sobell, entered ownership in 1957 and were immediately successful when purchasing London Cry, who won the 1958 Cambridgeshire Handicap. In 1960 they purchased the Ballymacoll Stud in Ireland from the estate of Dorothy Paget. Although they had many winners their first really good racehorse was a colt called Reform, who was the champion miler of 1967 and won amongst other races the St. James's Palace Stakes Sussex Stakes and Champion Stakes. Up until 1971 his horses were trained by Sir Gordon Richards but in 1970 with his father in law he purchased the West Ilsley stables from Jakie Astor, whereupon Dick Hern became his trainer. They had almost immediate success with two good Ballymacoll bred two-year-olds, and subsequent three-year-old milers, in Sallust and Sun Prince. They also owned and bred the St Leger Stakes runner-up Homeric. In 1974 Gaily, a purchased filly, won the Irish One Thousand Guineas. Their next good horse was Admetus who won the Washington International Stakes and the Prince of Wales's Stakes. A few years later they bred and owned Cistus who won the Lupe Stakes, Child Stakes, Nassau Stakes and the Prix de l'Op√©ra. They achieved every owner/breeders dream when Troy won the 200th Epsom Derby in 1979. In 1981 they sold the stables to the Queen. Their next outstanding horse was Sun Princess who won both the Epsom Oaks and St Leger. She in turn bred for them the Champion Two Year Old of 1988 Prince of Dance. In 1990 they had another fine race filly in Hellenic, whose finest day was her victory in the Yorkshire Oaks but who was also second in the St Leger. By now the partnership's horses were being trained by Sir Michael Stoute, although Hern remained as a trainer up until 1997 and other trainers such as Ian Balding, Peter Chapple-Hyam and Roger Charlton trained at various times for them. Upon Sir Michael Sobell's death Weinstock continued his racing activities, in partnership with his son Simon. Their next good horse was the 1995 Irish Two Thousand Guineas and Champion Stakes winner Spectrum. On the premature death of Simon Weinstock the racing activities were continued but soon after raced under the name of the Ballymacoll Stud. He also owned Pilsudski, whose wins included the 1996 Grosser Preis von Baden and Breeders' Cup Turf plus the 1997 Japan Cup; Golan (who won the Two Thousand Guineas Stakes and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes after Weinstock's death) and Islington (who won the Musidora Stakes, and after Weinstock's death won the Nassau Stakes, the Yorkshire Oaks (twice) and the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf). Ballymacoll Stud continues as a stud owned by his family to this day. The Weinstock developed families of Reform (but also of Hellenic, Golan and Islington), Sun Prince (but also of Sun Princess and Spectrum), and Gaily (but also of Pilsudski) continue in the stud.

Well- versed in the study of language, he knew Sanskrit, Tamil, Pali, Tibetan, German, Russian, French, Italian and English. In an obituary appearing in the English-language newspaper The Guardian, he was cited as \\"a man who was widely considered to be one of the more significant thinkers of the age and Russia's greatest philosopher.\\" On Russian television stations he was mourned as \\"the greatest Russian philosopher.\\" School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) Alumni Online Community News. What's New. \\"Remembering 'the Greatest Russian Philosopher'\\", December 2009. Early years Piatigorsky was born in Moscow. His father, Moshe, an engineer and lecturer at the Stalin metallurgical college was sent to a weapons production facility in the Urals (city of Nizhny Tagil) at the outbreak of World War II, where he took up a post as chief engineer in weapons production. Alexander worked in the plant during the war. Being a poor student of mathematics, chemistry and physics, Alexander was expelled from school twice, but at this time he learned Latin and some other languages out of sheer curiosity. He was a voracious reader, and read just about everything he could get his hands on. Studying and work in USSR At Moscow State University he studied philosophy, graduating in 1951. He moved to Stalingrad where he taught high-school history before returning to Moscow to join the Institute of Oriental Studies as \\"a specialist in Tamil languages and Hindu studies.\\"Times on Line, \\"Alexander Piatigorsky: Russian Emigre, Writer and Philosopher,\\" From the Times, 21 December 2009. He compiled the first Russian‚ÄìTamil dictionary in 1960. In 1963, influenced by Yuri Lotman who was working in Tartu University, he was involved with Lotman, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Vladimir Toporov and others, in the establishment of Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School. The School developed the theoretical foundations and nomenclature for a new approach in semiotics for the study of society, consciousness and culture.Piatigorsky, Alexander. \\"A Word About the Philosophy of Vladimir Nabokov\\", Kontinent 4: Contemporary Russian Writers, ed George Bailey, Avon, New York, New York. p. 257. In 1964, Piatigorsky's friend, poet Joseph Brodsky, was handed down a five-year sentence of internal exile. The following year, in support of the writers Yuli Daniel and Andrey Sinyavsky, Piatigorsky with other Russian intellectuals: His investigations and theoretical observations of the role played by thinking and philosophy in ancient South Asian culture and society were viewed with suspicion by some as a subtly indirect way of attacking the Soviet system. Knowing themselves to be likely targets of KGB surveillance, he and his fellow Indologists would gather in a room of the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies where they would enter into \\"fiery debates... in Sanskrit.\\" He was expelled from the Oriental Institute in 1968. Piatigorsky continued to lecture at the University of Moscow. He pursued his Indological investigations, increasingly dealing with Buddhist thought, and continued with more general work on the metatheory of consciousness, psychology, semiotics and philosophy in general, while collaborating with various Russian philosophers and thinkers outside of Indology. Chief among them was his close friend, philosopher Merab Mamardashvili. Influenced by German Idealism, Mamardashvili was a Deputy Editor of the leading journal, Voprosy Filosofii (\\"Problems of Philosophy\\"), and was also a principal representative of the so-called \\"Moscow School of Methodology.\\" Participants in the Moscow School seminars included: Alexander Zinoviev, Evald Ilyenkov, Georgy Shchedrovitsky, Boris Grushin, Lefebvre, and others. The School is believed by some to be the source of the most important developments in philosophy in the post-War period, rivaling anything done in the Western analytical tradition.Zilberman, David. B.The Moscow School of Methodology, unfinished unpublished monograph, Boston, 1977, 676 pp. David Zilberman Archive, The Mugar Memorial Library, Boston University, Special Collections. The School remains virtually unknown in the West because its members were forced to operate behind the \\"Iron Curtain\\" in a context of severely reduced operational visibility and Soviet-style repression. One of his friends was also an indologist and culture theoretician David Zilberman, who in 1968‚Äì1972 was a postgraduate student working under prof. Yuri Levada. Together they used to discuss problems of consciousness development. After they both migrated they kept friendship and continued research co-operation till Zilberman's death in July 1977. Piatigorsky's book\\" Myshlenie i nablyudenie\\" (Thinking and Observation), published in Riga in 2002, was dedicated to David Zilberman and included an explicit confession of Zilberman's influence on the author's thought. In 1972, Piatigorsky's Buddhist teacher Dandaron was arrested by Soviet authorities. A number of Dandaron's students were imprisoned. Dandaron was sent to a Soviet labor camp where he perished in 1974.Piatigorsky, Alexander. \\"The Departure of Dandaron,\\" Kontinent 3: Contemporary Russian Writers ed. George Bailey, New York, 1978. During the same period, Mamardashvili and Piatigorsky co-authored: \\"Symbol and Consciousness: Metaphysical Discussion of Consciousness, Symbolism and Language\\" Jerusalem (1982), in Russian. This abstract and complex text, combining Western and Eastern terms, is considered by some to be the most significant philosophical work written in the Russian language. The text: Written in the two years before Piatigorsky left the Soviet Union for Britain in 1974, the manuscript was spirited out of the country by the British-Czech social philosopher Ernest Gellner. It is worth noticing that the text was written in a deteriorating situation of renewed political repression of the Russian intelligentsia by the Soviet state. The 'tightening of restrictions' followed a brief period of relaxation of Soviet controls on intellectual activity which had taken place from the mid-1960s until the early 1970s.Zilberman, David B. \\"The Post- Sociological Society\\", Studies in Soviet Thought 1979. Leaving Soviet Union and career at SOAS, University of London Departing the Soviet Union in 1974 for Israel, Piatigorsky made his way to Oxford University where he had been invited to give some lectures. But early times in London were severe for his family (at the moment of departure he has some children and pregnant wife). He arrived to London in the summer and had no normal job, he earned only 6.5 pounds a day. He accepted some invitations to lecture, but decided to stay in London. At Oxford he quickly became acquainted with Isaiah Berlin and Leszek Ko≈Çakowski. He joined the staff of the School of Oriental and African Studies, The University of London, as lecturer in 1975 with the commendation of Berlin who at one point is reported to have said: \\"Piatigorsky is quite simply a genius!\\" It is remarkable that Piatigorski didn't consider himself a dissident, he left Soviet Union just because he was bored, he felt that something was missing there. While at SOAS, Piatigorsky wrote numerous journal articles and Introductions and chapters to books in various academic fields. He wrote several larger scholarly works including: The Buddhist Philosophy of Thought (1984), Mythological Deliberations (1993), and Who's Afraid of Freemasons? (1997). The work on Freemasonry was a bestselling book on the sociology and philosophy of religious belief. In 1991, he was made Professor of the Ancient History of South Asia, a position from which he retired in 2001 as Emeritus Professor. During the final two decades of his life, Piatigorsky wrote a number of philosophical novels in Russian, one of which earned him the Andrei Bely prize in 2000. His first, The Philosophy of a Small Street, was published in Moscow in 1994. The book was well-received, further establishing his reputation in Russian intellectual circles, while placing him in the forefront of public consciousness. Remember the Strange Person (1999) and An Ancient Man in the City (2001) followed. As a novelist he joins the select company of those few philosophers who successfully managed to cross over into the world of literature, including Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Umberto Eco, and Alexander Zinoviev. He also crossed over successfully into the world of cinema. He was made the subject of 'Philosopher Escaped' (2005) a documentary film directed by Uldis Tirons about the life of a philosopher, and he played \\"the part of an Indian merchant in his friend Otar Iosseliani's film Hunting Butterflies.\\" Piatigorsky disliked traditional academic jargon and for most of his life he upheld the principle that scholars should publish as little as possible on the grounds that publishing interrupts thinking. His lecture style was lively and distinctive: he was able to speak with considerable effect about the most abstruse and difficult concepts.

Of his many subsequent impersonations, perhaps the best- known is that of Louis XI, at what later became Daly's Theatre in New York. After 1868 he was manager of theatres in St. Louis, New Orleans, and Albany. John was the sole lessee and manager of the Albaugh's Grand Opera House (1884‚Äì1894) in Washington, where he also built the Lafayette Square Opera House. He owned the new Lyceum Theatre in Baltimore, where he made his last appearance in 1899 before retiring from the stage.

He is the older brother of the journalist and author Hutchins Hapgood. He graduated from Harvard University in 1890 and from the law school there in 1893, then chose to become a writer. Hapgood worked as the drama critic of the New York City Commercial Advertiser and of the Bookman in 1897‚Äì1902. He was named the editor of Collier's Weekly in 1903 and remained at that post for about a decade, before leaving to become editor of Harper's Weekly in June 1913. His editorial style attracted much attention for its vigor and range. Hapgood at Harvard (1895) He inspired T. G.

During the latter part of World War I and into the early post-war period Hapgood served as president of the League of Free Nations Association, which advocated in favor of a League of Nations to adjudicate international disputes.\\"Hapgood Backs Nations League As Peace Prop,\\" New York Call, vol. 12, no. 32 (February 1, 1919), pg. 4. In this capacity Hapgood helped advance the agenda of President Woodrow Wilson, who sought the establishment of such a body at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. In 1919 President Wilson appointed Hapgood Minister to Denmark, in which post he served for about six months. He helped expose Henry Ford's antisemitism in his article, \\"The Inside Story of Henry Ford's Jew-Mania\\", Part 4, Hearst's International (September 1922). Hapgood was married twice. His first wife, Emilie Bigelow Hapgood, whom he married in 1896, went on to become famous in her own right as a theatrical producer in New York. They were divorced in 1915. Two years later, he married his second wife, Elizabeth Kempley Reynolds (1894‚Äì1974).Schenectady Gazette, \\"Mrs. Emilie Bigelow Hapgood Dies in Rome\\" (obituary); accessed April 25, 2015.

Early life and career She was born Bridget Crehan in County Limerick, Ireland, one of five siblings born to parents Thomas Crehan (died 1890) and Harriet (or Harriett) Ryan Crehan (died 1901), on April 22, most probably in 1857, although by the time she applied for a U.S. passport she had shaved a few years off and gave 1860 as her year of birth. The family surname was apparently changed to Rehan later.Ada Rehan's U.S. passport application (May 9, 1894), in which she gives 1860 as her year of birth, as she would forever after. When she was a small child her family emigrated to the United States and settled in Brooklyn, New York. Her year of birth was later disputed by a critic who wrote in the Boston Globe on November 24, 1888, when she should have been 31 years old (or 28 by her own reckoning later), \\"Ada Rehan is forty years old and over. She makes up fairly for girlish roles ... but at close sight in the cold light of day she shows her age.\\"Izard, Forrest. Heroines of the Modern Stage (1915), Sturgis & Walton Company, New York. This is incorrect as that would require an 1848 year of birth which has never been established and strains credulity. Other potential years of birth gleaned from travel manifests and other records include 1854, 1854, 1858 and 1859. Ada's siblings found work in the theater. Her sisters Harriet and Kate preceded her onto the stage. Kate married fellow actor Oliver Doud Byron. Their son, Ada's nephew, was actor Arthur Byron. Ada's two brothers, William and Arthur, were involved with the business side of theatre. Her first performance was in Newark, New Jersey, in a play called Across the Continent, written by her brother-in-law, in which she filled in for an actress in a minor role who was sick and unable to go on. Her appearance was competent enough that her family decided she should continue pursuing a career in the theater. It was in her next performance, with Mrs. John Drew's Arch Street Theatre of Philadelphia, that she was misbilled as Ada C. Rehan and the name stuck. Ada then went to Louisville to join the stock company of Macauley's Theatre, where she remained one season (1875‚Äì76). Subsequently, she appeared in Baltimore, Albany, and other cities with John W. Albaugh's company and played supporting roles alongside prominent actors like Edwin Booth and John Edward McCullough. Rehan's autograph on a theatre poster Ada Rehan Fame and Augustin Daly Rehan was performing in one of Daly's own plays, Pique, produced by New York's Grand Opera House and starring Fanny Davenport when the successful theater manager Augustin Daly first took note of her in April 1879. Later that year when he opened his third New York theatre, Daly's Fifth Avenue Theatre, Rehan joined his company. Rehan would continue to work with Daly until his death twenty years later, but their relationship, though marked by enormous professional success for both, was a turbulent one. Rehan was part of Daly's company known as the \\"Big Four\\". John Drew, Jr., Mrs. Ann Hartley Gilbert, and James Lewis made the rest of the group. Under Daly's meticulous direction and management, the foursome won over critics and audiences with their specialties of Shakespearean comedies, Restoration comedies, and translations of German farces. In general the four leads played variations on the same character types. Drew and Rehan were slotted in to the romantic hero and heroine roles, while Lewis and Gilbert took the older, character roles. As one reporter at the Herald described it, \\"They have one way of playing comedy at Daly's and only one. Whether the piece be Sheridan's or Shakespeare's or Schonthan's or Jerome's, the actors are always good, bright, middle-class Americans.\\" While finding much success in \\"breeches roles\\", for her audiences in America and abroad she came to embody an ideal of femininity that was desirable, respectable, and aspirational. In his biography of her, one of Rehan's contemporaries, William Winter wrote, \\"Each part that she has undertaken has been permeated with something of herself...Her soul is given to her profession, and the nature of the woman herself is discerned in that of the character that she represents.\\" It soon became clear that Rehan was the star of Daly's company even within the Big Four, but Daly refused to acknowledge this with top billing or any other prioritizing treatment. Rehan and Daly's professional relationship was further complicated by their personal one. It is generally acknowledged that Rehan became the married Daly's mistress early on in their partnership. Cornelia Otis Skinner writes of their relationship that \\"besides being leading lady, [she] enjoyed the offstage role of grand maitresse...To hold the whip handle by keeping a woman of her beauty and prominence in the compromising position and extra-marital liaison involved in those cautious times was a sop to his will to power.\\" Their romantic entanglement coupled with their professional symbiosis makes it easy to interpret their relationship as Svengali-esque. Daly and Rehan's greatest achievement, and the production that most reflected their own combative power dynamics, was most likely their 1887 The Taming of the Shrew. It ran in both New York and London and that initial run tallied 121 performances, which was quite a feat for a show in the nineteenth century. John Singer Sargent's 1895 portrait of Ada Rehan from The Met collection Rehan was so popular in the 1880s and '90s that she played over 200 parts. George Bernard Shaw, Mark Twain, and Oscar Wilde (who wrote the part of Mrs. Erlynne in Lady Windermere's Fan with her in mind) were among her many admirers. And women everywhere strove to imitate her diction, demeanor, and even her dresses. The Chicago Evening Mail reported on the fad of women impersonating Rehan's speech, ladies' hats were named for her, and dressmakers offered her costumes for free in order to get their designs in front of the public. Retirement When Augustin Daly died in 1899, Rehan deserted the stage for an entire year. She returned with a production of Sweet Nell of Old Drury and a tour that revived some of her classic roles from her career with Daly's company. However, the staleness that Rehan's performances had become susceptible to as the 1890s wore on was even more evident in these post-Daly productions. In a letter to William Winter, Rehan wrote, \\"I am very indifferent toward the future. If I ever go on again with my work, I fear it will be more of the machine than the artiste.\\" After a few more poorly received attempts, Rehan permanently retired from the stage in 1905. Death Rehan lived out her remaining years between her homes in New York and the English coast. She died from arteriosclerosis and cancer in New York in 1916. Her ashes are buried in Greenwood Cemetery, Brooklyn. Legacy Ada Rehan was widely admired in both America and Europe, having acted in Paris, Berlin, Hamburg, London, Edinburgh, Dublin, and Stratford-on-Avon. When she died newspapers across the country mourned her passing, including a prominent obituary in The New York Times. Daly modelled the masthead of his theater, a depiction of Comedy, after Rehan. Rehan was the model for a solid silver statue of Justice that was presented as part of the State of Montana's mining exhibition at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. More than 25 years after Ada Rehan's death, a World War II Liberty ship was named after her, the USS Ada Rehan.

Edward Russell Ayrton. Early life Ayrton was the son of William Scrope Ayrton (1849-1904), a British consular official in China, and his wife Ellen Louisa McClatchie, and was born in Wuhu, China, on 17 December 1882 (coincidentally, the same year as the formation of the Egypt Exploration Fund). His younger sister was the Suffragette Phyllis Ayrton (1884-1975). The Ayrton family originated in Yorkshire. Edward's similarly- named forebear, Edward Ayrton (1698-1774), was mayor of Ripon in 1760, laying the foundations for the family's subsequent prominence. The mayor's son was the leading organist and choirmaster, Dr. Edmund Ayrton (1734-1808) and his son in turn - the mayor's grandson and the great-grandfather of the archeologist - was the theatre-reviewer William Ayrton (1777-1858). Ayrton was educated at St Paul's School, in London. Career He began his career in Egyptology at the age of 20, assisting the pioneer of systematic methodology in archaeology William Matthew Flinders Petrie. He joined Petrie on the Egypt Exploration Fund excavations at Abydos (which began in 1899) from 1902 to 1904. Ayrton's first independent work was the excavation of the Second Dynasty site of Shunet ez Zebib (at Abydos). Later, he worked near Ghurab with William Leonard Stevenson Loat. In 1904-05 he excavated and recorded graves of several ancient princesses found in the funerary temple complex of king Mentuhotep II at Deir al-Bahari, as part of the expedition led by √âdouard Naville and Henry Hall. Working for Theodore M. Davis in Egypt's Valley of the Kings from 1905 to 1908, he discovered the following tombs: * KV47 (of the pharaoh Siptah, in 1905) * KV55 (Amarna Period, interment problematic, in 1907) * KV56 (of a royal child, in 1908) and * KV57 (of the pharaoh Horemheb, in 1908). He also led or participated in the excavation of the following tombs: * KV2, KV10, KV46, KV47, KV48, KV49, KV50, KV51, KV52, KV53, KV54, KV56, KV57, KV59, and KV60. Again working with Loat, in 1908-09 he excavated amongst the Sixth Dynasty tombs at Abydos and also the Predynastic cemetery at El Mahasna. In 1911 he accepted a position with the Archaeological Survey of Ceylon. On the 18 May 1914 he drowned while on a shooting expedition, in an accident on the Tissa Tank lake, Tissamaharama, in southern Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Times Newspaper printed his obituary on the 23 May 1914; and his Probate Administration was published in 1915. The Estate of ¬£457 18s 1d was left to his elder sister, Florence Margaret Ayrton.

It is built on land which once belonged to the house which carries the same name.  History  The Manor of Townhill was granted to Sir William Paulet by Henry VIII in 1536 after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The land was mainly used for farming, and became known as Townhill Farm. Townhill Farm became part of the Manor of South Stoneham, but was purchased in 1787 by Nathaniel Middleton, who had made his fortune in the service of the British East India Company. He turned the farmhouse into a private home, and the estate became known as Townhill Park. He enlarged the farmhouse, but a fire resulted in a complete revamp of the property in 1793. The property later passed into the hands of the Gater family, who also owned the nearby Gaters Mill near Mansbridge. In 1897, Townhill Farm was purchased by Samuel Montagu, 1st Baron Swaythling, for his son Louis (who became the second Baron Swaythling in 1911). In 1912, extensive further modifications were made to the building by architect Leonard Rome Guthrie. The gardens at Townhill Park were laid out by Gertrude Jekyll and were noted for their rhododendrons, azaleas and camellias. The Montagu Family lived in Townhill Park until the mid-1940s. The property was sold in 1948. were sold to Southampton Borough Council for housing, and the suburb of Townhill Park came into existence. Meanwhile the house itself and the remaining of land became a school for underprivileged girls, owned and operated by Middlesex County Council. The housing estate's show home was officially opened on 30 September 1959 by Benny Hill. where he was given a ceremonial key to the new house. Having arrived at Woodmill by Rolls-Royce, he switched to a horse-drawn milk float to make his entrance in Townhill Park. The show house was a three-bedroom detached house, on the market for ¬£3,100, making it one of the most expensive houses on the new estate. The cheapest available property was a single bedroom maisonette, listed at ¬£1,995. The Daily Echo described the new houses as having \\"glass bricks, facing bricks and cement rendering blend with the tapering chimney breast to give a comfortable country look suited well to the surroundings.\\" The school in Townhill Park House closed in 1969 and the building was acquired by Southampton City Council. From 1971, the building was used as a hostel for Merchant Navy cadets, housing 75, until 1984 when the house became a conference centre. In 1994, Townhill Park House was purchased by The Gregg School. The Friends of Townhill Park Gardens was established in 1997 to restore the gardens, which are now open to the public on four days each year. The house, too, is occasionally open for guided tours. The house is a grade II listed building.Southampton City Council: Listed buildings in Southampton Accessed 17 September 2007.  Townhill Park today  The local authority boundary between Eastleigh (borough) and Southampton runs through the old Townhill Farm property, and the area is divided. The house and gardens, and the suburb of Chartwell Green in West End parish, lie within Eastleigh (borough) while the suburb of Townhill Park is governed by Southampton City Council. The Townhill Park suburb consists mainly of blocks of flats, built originally as council housing. The hub of the area is Meggeson Avenue, where a small parade of shops and a small community centre are located. It also contains the Townhill Infant and Townhill Junior schools.  Culture and community = Culture = Several street brawls involving gangs occurred in Townhill Park in 2009, one of which led to a 15-year-old boy receiving stab wounds to the neck., In the most significant brawl, nine arrests were made when the ‚ÄúTownhill Boys‚Äù and the ‚ÄúThornhill Boys‚Äù clashed with axes, knives and pieces of wood, resulting in one of the 'Townhill Boys' being stabbed in the buttock. The violence peaked around the same time as knife related murders in London rose dramatically. In 2012 a man was shot in the Vanguard Road area, but his injuries were not life-threatening. = Community facilities = Townhill Park Community Centre was rebuilt in the early 21st century and is managed by the Townhill Park Community Association.

It starts from the confluence of two rivers springing from Eastern Stara Planina, Golyama Kamchiya (itself formed by the confluence of the rivers Ticha and Vrana) and Luda Kamchiya, flows eastward to the Black Sea and empties into it 25 km south of Varna, in the Resort of Kamchiya. History In antiquity, the river was known as Panisos; later, Slavs gave it the name of Ticha. Its contemporary name is considered to be of Cuman origin. The Romans built the stronghold Erite on its bank. The Kamchia basin played a notable role in the history of the First Bulgarian Empire. Much of the Medieval Bulgarian Navy from the 9th to the 14th century was built at the river mouth thanks to the quality timber of the area. In the 18th century, Lipovans settled along the lower banks. Geography and ecology Running down through Eastern Stara Planina, the Kamchiya meanders through the Longoz or alluvial longose grove, and through the Kamchia (biosphere reserve), a UNESCO- listed biosphere reserve protecting the primeval forest from intensive logging and drainage that had decimated it by mid-20th century. The river mouth forms a sand barrier and often overflows its banks in the valley. The old synclines of the river leave swampy areas called azmatsi. The reserve is 40 km long (stretching throughout the longose grove to the river mouth) and up to 5 km wide. The area around the river mouth is remarkable for its (frequently flooded) old growth forests of a riverine type, up to 450 meter-wide beaches with up to 19 meter-high banks, forested or grass-covered sand dunes, freshwater marshes, and marshy remnants of old riverbeds, cutting deep into the forest. The unusual coexistence of ash, oak, elm, alder and maple trees, sometimes rising up to 40‚Äì50 m with lianas climbing among the branches, creates the impression of a tropical forest, a real tangle of woods. The summer snowflake (Leucojum aestivum) and several buttercup species (Scilla sp.), as well as ferns, grow in the river delta. One can see otter, deer, wild boar and wild cats among the 26 mammal species. There are ospreys, eagles, and up to 200 other bird species, including 56 protected ones, and 25 fish species, among other wildlife. The mouth of the river, as viewed from the south from the Kamchia Biosphere Reserve. Note the spit which has been formed at its mouth The towns the river flows past include Veliki Preslav and Smyadovo in Shumen Province, and Dalgopol and Dolni Chiflik in Varna Province. The Ticha feeds the dam lake Ticha and Luda Kamchiya feeds the dam lakes Kamchiya and Tsonevo], which supply water to Varna and Burgas. Lake Tsonevo is also a preferred fishing spot for much of Eastern Bulgaria. The Luda Kamchiya gorge, which cuts across Stara Planina provides the easternmost of the three railway routes between northern and southern Bulgaria. The river valley is fertile, lined with orchards and vegetable gardens; much of it is irrigated. The lower Kamchiya is navigable for smaller motor boats. A minke whale was seen at the river mouth in 1926 and this was one of two records of any baleen whales in the history along with a stranding of the same species north of Batumi in 1882.–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞ –ß–µ—Ä–Ω–æ –º–æ—Ä–µ, –ß–∞—Ä–ª–∑ –ö–∏–Ω–≥ Environment and pollution A 2006 study conducted by the Institute of Oceanology and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences on the water quality and its impact on the Black Sea coastal zone concluded that > Nutrients content (nitrite, phosphate) in Kamchia River downstream does not > always correspond to national water quality standards.

The water lily, torfaceous snowdrop, and white Kamchia lily are also disappearing according to the World Wildlife Fund. The Storage Battery Plant in Targovishte is a significant polluter (heavy metals) of the Kamchia River. Cattle breeding is the second major source of water pollution and directly affects sources of drinking water. Due to a serious lack of water purification stations on cattle farms, non-purified waste waters pour into the various water basins. The same holds true for the underground waters, as nitrates, phosphates, and other macroelements used in farming are dissolved and washed away by rains, to appear subsequently in water basins and mineral springs. The Kamchia reservoir, which is the primary source of drinking water for Bourgas and a secondary source for Varna, is an example. Water and sewage experts have stated that the \\"Komounari\\" hydroelectric project should not divert waters from the highly polluted Gorna Kamchia River into the Kamchia reservoir. This reservoir, as well as other sources of drinking water for Varna, have old and low-capacity purification stations. During droughts, drinking water is drawn from the reservoir that does not meet sanitary standards. The third main pollutant is waste water from everyday household activities in cities and small towns. One of the major problems at the Kamchia reservoir is the lack of purified water provided to the town of Kotel. The city of Varna discharges too much impure water. However, on a more positive note, as a result of improvements to the Kamchia river, it no longer floods the dense forest. This was responsible for the spread of Dutch elm disease, which had caused great damage to elms and ash trees.  Eponymous honor  Kamchiya Glacier on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Kamchiya River.

Reeder or The Magnificent Malochi, was an American R&B; singer, songwriter and pianist, known for his frenetic performances. He has been credited with influencing rock and roll pioneer Little Richard.Charlie Gillett, The Sound of the City, (1970), p.72 Early life A native of Greenville, South Carolina, he was the son of Elizabeth and Eskew Reeder, and attended Sterling High School in Greenville from 1947 to 1950. Though most reliable sources give his birth name as Eskew Reeder, Jr., some give the name Stephen Quincy Reeder. Although most sources give the year of his birth as 1935, other reliable sources, and his social security records, state 1938. Career=1950s‚Äì1960s= Reeder was a self-taught piano player whose roots were in gospel music. His music career started as a teenager, when he dropped out of high school and joined the gospel group \\"Heavenly Echoes\\" based in New York City. Little is known about Reeder's early career as a secular rock and roll piano player. As Esquerita, he often wore heavy makeup, sunglasses, and two wigs, piling his pompadour high on his head. Reeder's first solo studio recordings came about when Paul Peek got him to record some demos at a Greenville radio station (WESC) around 1958. At that time, Peek was a member of the rockabilly group The Blue Caps, led by manic performer Gene Vincent. Peek even co-wrote \\"The Rock-Around\\" with Reeder, and Reeder played piano on the 1958 recording that launched the NRC (National Recording Corporation) label. From these contacts and Paul Peek's influence with Capitol Records came a record contract for Reeder; Cub Koda described the results as \\"some of the most untamed and unabashed sides ever issued by a major label.\\" At this point, Eskew Reeder, Jr. adopted the stage name Esquerita. The ensuing years found Reeder cutting several singles with various backing musicians in studios in Nashville, Dallas, New Orleans and Detroit. Capitol Records released the LP Esquerita in 1959, his only album in the traditional sense (that is, not a compilation of earlier singles, or re- issues). Some of the musicians he recorded with during this era included Jimi Hendrix, Dr. John, Allen Toussaint, and The Jordanaires (Elvis Presley's backup singers). His best known songs from this time include: \\"Hey Miss Lucy\\", \\"Get Back Baby\\", \\"Getting‚Äô Plenty of Lovin‚Äô\\", \\"Rockin‚Äô the Joint\\", and \\"Oh Baby\\". In 1963, he recorded a session for Berry Gordy's Motown Records but those recordings were never released. In 1968, Reeder changed his name to The Magnificent Malochi and signed with Brunswick Records. He played keyboards on \\"Takin' Care Of Business\\" by John Hammond in 1970. Shortly after this, he began to fade from the music scene, but Linda Hopkins released a song written by Reeder called \\"Seven Days and Seven Nights\\" in 1973. Around this time, Esquerita formed a new group, consisting of Charles Neville (the saxophone player of The Neville Brothers) who then resided in Brooklyn, New York, and drummer Jerry Katz of Queens, New York. They and a few other musicians played a steady gig at Tommy Smalls Night Club on 50th Street and 8th Avenue in New York City. Several months later the group disbanded. =1970s‚Äì1980s= According to an interview with Billy Miller and Miriam Linna in the ReSearch book Incredibly Strange Music, Reeder occasionally performed at African- American gay clubs under the name Fabulash during the 1970s. He was eventually tracked down by a writer for Kicks Magazine in 1983 or 1984, who found him performing in second-rate New York City clubs. According to an article (\\"Who Was Esquerita?\\") by music historian Johnny Carter in an international oldies magazine, music maven Bill Lowery (who originated National Recording Corporation and was involved in the Peek sessions for NRC) was approached by Esquerita on the street in New York in 1985 after a conference at Broadcast Music, Inc.. Lowery confirmed that Esquerita was down on his luck and was working as a parking lot attendant but was still as flamboyant as ever. Later years and death A few months before his death he was seen washing car windshields for tips at an intersection in Brooklyn. In this same article, Esquerita's father, Eskew Reeder Sr., said that his son had died of complications brought on by AIDS in 1986. Esquerita's father (who was born on March 25, 1907) died in February 1989, a little over two years after his son's death. Eskew Sr.'s last known residence was Simpsonville, South Carolina. Posthumous releases On March 13, 2012, it was announced that Norton Records was releasing a new single and new album by Esquerita entitled Sinner Man: The Lost Session. These were to include unreleased recordings from a session in New York City in June 1966. Influence Reeder has been cited as a key early influence on Little Richard (Richard Penniman) (see below); his look and style were in a very similar vein, although Esquerita was much more flamboyant in the 1950s and his music played more wildly than the contemporary music of Little Richard. Reeder did not record until after Little Richard's initial early 1950s recordings for the RCA and Peacock labels and the later hits on Specialty. However, early Little Richard recordings made at WGST Radio Station in Atlanta do not show the style that was to make him famous. According to Richard, Esquerita did influence him and taught him to play the piano. In an interview segment of the South Bank Show documentary in 1988 when the book The Quasar Of Rock was published, Richard states that he saw Esquerita getting off a bus at the Macon, GA Greyhound bus station, but doesn't say which year, presumably in the early 1950s. There's a hint of a sexual connection between the two, but Richard also states that he was inspired by Reeder, and moreover, Reeder was inspired by Richard to go into show business. Little Richard also had not intended to use what came to be his (and Esquerita's) characteristic style during his first New Orleans session for Specialty Records. The session producer, Robert \\"Bumps\\" Blackwell had been unhappy with Penniman's initial songs on the session, so, taking a break from recording, he went with Richard to a local cafe, where Richard jumped on a piano and began singing an X-rated version of \\"Tutti Frutti\\", in true Esquerita fashion. Blackwell felt that a cleaned-up version of the song with the same style of presentation would be just what his boss Art Rupe was looking for, and this song launched Little Richard's career in 1955. Mick Jones (of The Clash) wrote and recorded a song called \\"Esquerita\\" with his band Big Audio Dynamite which appeared on the group's Tighten Up Vol. 88 album from 1988. Alternative rock band Lyres recorded their own version of Esquerita's song \\"Gettin' Plenty Lovin'\\" which was released on Norton Records in 1992. Esquerita was an influence on zydeco performer Lynn August, who played drums for Esquerita in the early 1960s. At the age of 12, August was playing drums for Fats Junior who happened to be opening a show for Esquerita, who let August play a couple of songs with him. After Esquerita spoke with August's mom, he was hired as Esquerita's drummer and played with Esquerita for three years, mostly around New Orleans. August said that Esquerita was playing an organ with pedals and only carried a drummer because he was such a great entertainer. Esquerita also encouraged August to take up piano. Lynn August later became known for his accordion playing. When Esquerita left New Orleans around 1963, August joined Jay Nelson's band from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. August later recorded his own version of Esquerita's song \\"Undivided Love\\" which appears on his Creole Cruiser album from 1992. The Adam Ant and Marco Pirroni song \\"Miss Thing\\", off their 1985 album Vive Le Rock was about Esquerita.

Known as \\"the bravest of the brave\\" and \\"Father of the Cauchois\\" (the people of the region of the Pays de Caux), he is remembered for fighting against the English in Normandy during the Hundred Years War. Jean may have fought at the Battle of Agincourt, and supported the Dauphin, later King Charles VII of France. As a result of their participation in the war against England, Jean and his brother Louis had their lands confiscated by King Henry V of England in 1419 and given to an Englishman. Liberation of Harfleur Harfleur had been occupied by the English since 1415, but by 1435 it was the last place they still held in Normandy. Having learned that a number of Harfleur residents were ready to support any attempt against the enemy, de Grouchy, along with the Cauchois leaders, Floquet, Carnier and Lahire, developed a plan together with 104 of the inhabitants of Harfleur. On the night of 3/4 November 1435, while John de Rieux diverted the enemy‚Äôs attention with 4,000 mounted troops, he approached the town with the Cauchois troops under his banner to enter at the appropriate time and take the city. A fire lit in the suburbs near the Porte d‚ÄôEure by the 104 faithful French residents would be the signal to attack. At daybreak, the English sentries, seeing the high walls of the suburb in flames, gave warning and garrison troops rushed out to extinguish the fire. This was the moment de Grouchy and his men had waited for. They raced up the slope to the breach in the walls where the English had penetrated in 1415 and seized the town, ruthlessly killing their English enemies and anyone else who opposed them. Unfortunately, climbing up a slope at the age of 81 years, Grouchy was one of the 40 attackers that were killed in action. Ten years later, the English returned in Normandy and confiscated the property of the de Grouchy family. Legacy In 1875 a bronze statue of de Grouchy was erected at Harfleur. He is depicted in armour, with sword in hand.

It was formed in 1894 with the passing of the Local Government Act 1894 and extended to incorporate the former parish of Plumpton Wall by a County Review Order in 1934. Part of the historic royal hunting ground of Inglewood Forest, settlement in the area dates back to the Roman occupation. Extent The parish is located between the city of Carlisle and the market town of Penrith, along nine miles of the A6. The parish encompasses the villages of Armathwaite, Calthwaite, High Hesket, Low Hesket, Plumpton and Southwaite, as well as the hamlets of Aiketgate, Morton, Old Town, Thiefside, Petteril Green and Plumpton Foot. It also includes parts of the villages of Ivegill and Wreay, with these villages also part of the parishes of Skelton and St Cuthbert Without respectively. At the 2011 census, the parish population stood at 2,588. History At Castlesteads or Old Penrith just north of Plumpton village are the remains of a Roman Fort known as Voreda. Just north of the site, aerial evidence has located two Roman camps, with limited excavation work in 1977 revealing pottery dating from AD 120. The structures are located near to the main Roman Road connecting the Vale of York to Carlilse, which now forms part of the modern-day A6. Many of the villages in the parish have names with Norse origins, several with the common suffix of 'thwaite', from the Norse clearing or meadow. The name Hesket itself derives from the old Norse for horse ('hestr') and road or race course ('skeid'). In 1822, a viking cairn was discovered in the parish, along the route of the A6, near to the modern day location of Court Thorn GP Surgery, during operations to widen the road. The objects uncovered were incorporated into the collection at Tuille House Museum in Carlisle. The Parish is part of the Royal hunting ground known as Inglewood Forest, established by William the Conqueror and extended by Henry II. In 1885, Police Constable Joseph Byrnes was shot and killed by three assailants in Plumpton. The trio were wanted in connection with a burglary at Netherby Hall. The men were later caught, and sentenced to death by hanging. A memorial to Constable Byrnes was erected in the village, which is now Grade II listed. The civil parishes of Hesket-in-the-Forest and Plumpton Wall were formed with the passing of the Local Government Act 1894. Plumpton Wall was later incorporated into Hesket-in-the-Forest, following a County Review Order in 1934. Governance Hesket is in the United Kingdom parliamentary constituency of Penrith and the Border. Neil Hudson was elected its Conservative Member of Parliament at the 2019 General Election, replacing fellow Conservative Rory Stewart, who announced his intention to stand down from both parliament and the party in October 2019. A district ward named Hesket exists, which incorporates the Parishes of Hesket and Catterlen, electing two representatives to Eden District Council. The ward is currently represented by Conservative Councilor Elaine Martin and Independent Group Councillor David Ryland, both elected in May 2019. At county level, the parish falls within the Greystoke and Hesket ward, electing one County Councillor onto Cumbria County Council. In 2017, the seat was won by Conservative Councillor Tom Wentworth-Waites. Hesket Parish Council is divided into three electoral wards, Armathwaite, Calthwaite and Southwaite, each electing five Parish Councillors. Transport The historic Settle-Carlisle Railway, which opened in 1876, runs through the parish with a station at Armathwaite. Adjacent to the station is a Victorian signal box, restored and maintained by local volunteers and open to the public for viewing. The West Coast Main Line also runs through the parish. At one time there were stations on this line at Plumpton, which closed in 1948, and at Southwaite and Calthwaite, both of which closed in 1952. The M6 motorway and the A6 road run parallel to each other through the parish with a motorway service area at Southwaite. The 104 bus service also runs through the villages of Plumpton, Low Hesket and High Hesket, operated by Stagecoach, running between Carlisle and Penrith. There is also a community bus service, Fellrunner, which provides return journeys to Carlisle and Penrith from various locations within the Parish. The service was established in 1979, spearheaded by local clergyman the Reverend Phillip Canham, and is run entirely by volunteers. Amenities The parish is served by five primary schools, in the villages of Armathwaite, Calthwaite, High Hesket, Ivegill and Plumpton. There are three village halls, in the villages of Low Hesket, Ivegill and Armathwaite, run by local volunteers, and a community centre, housed in a former Methodist chapel, located between the villages of Calthwaite and Plumpton. The villages of Armathwaite, Calthwaite, High Hesket, Ivegill and Plumpton all house parish churches. Armathwaite village has a local village shop and Post Office, two public houses, and a children's play area. Calthwaite houses a public house and a children's play area, as well as a youth football club. The village of Low Hesket also has a public house. The primary school playground in Plumpton also functions as a children's play area out of school hours, and the village houses a garden centre and cafe at the former station yard. Places of interest The parish is home to sixty-six listed buildings including three Grade II* listed buildings: Armathwaite Castle, now a private residence; the Church of St Mary's in High Hesket, dating from the eighteenth century but also incorporating parts of the original medieval church building; and the sixteenth century Southwaite Hall Copper House and barns. It is also home to the Grade II listed Katharine Well, situated at Mellguards just outside the village of Southwaite. The well was built as a memorial to the sister of local architect and philanthropist Sara Losh.

Knights Inn used to be built with all-exterior corridors and medieval-inspired architecture, but the chain now has updated options for all Knights Inn properties. The Knights Inn brand is now spun off for a fresh new start with Red Lion Hotels. History A Knights Inn location Knights Inn started in Columbus, Ohio when its first location opened in 1974. The Columbus-based Cardinal Industries, Inc., former manufacturer of prefabricated buildings such as apartments and motels, developed the chain.Nelton, Sharon. \\"Home, sweet modular home - manufacturer Austin Guirlinger.\\" Nation's Business. April 1988. The chain utilized extensive landscaping and Tudor architecture, and all properties featured only one story. The buildings were also prefabricated, and were shipped on trucks to their sites. Knights Inn introduced Arborgate Inn, a \\"no-frills\\" brand featuring fewer amenities and more modern architecture, along with a higher-end variant called Knights Stop. Knights Inn filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1989, one year after the introduction of Arborgate Inn. Hospitality Management Systems (HMS) acquired the Knights Inn franchise and management contract rights from Cardinal Industries in 1991. At this point, many properties had begun re-branding to other companies, most notably Motel 6, Travelodge, and Days Inn; conversely, HMS began acquiring buildings from other chains and re-branding them to Knights Inn, thus abandoning the chain's architecture standards. HMS successfully sued the owners of properties re-branded from Knights Inn and forced them to alter the appearances of their buildings. Cendant purchased Knights Inn in 1995. At this same time, the sister brands were discontinued. In 2004, Cendant merged the Villager Inn brand, which it had previously acquired, into the Knights Inn division. Cendant spun off its hotel properties as Wyndham Worldwide in 2006. In November 2007, there were 225 properties open in the United States and Canada.

It is famous for the religious celebrations held there in July and is now the third most important pilgrimage site in Brazil. On the west side of the city is a purpose-built raceway where, in 2014, the city hosted a MotoCross World Championship, Grand Prix race. Trindade is part of the Goi√¢nia Microregion, which has over one million six hundred thousand inhabitants. It is located approximately 30 km. west of Goi√¢nia, to which it is connected by a four-lane highway, GO-060. Origin of the City Although Trindade became a city in 1943, its origins go back to 1840, when, according to local folklore, in a small village called Barro Preto, Constantino Xavier and his wife Ana Rosa found in their fields a small clay medallion showing the Holy Trinity crowning the Virgin Mary. Soon a palm covered chapel was raised to be later replaced by a mortar chapel covered with tiles. Lands were donated by local farmers and a religious shrine began to take form. Followers decided to embellish the simple clay medallion and it was taken to Piren√≥polis to be worked on by the greatest artist of the region. The original clay medallion returned to Trindade substituted by a wooden representation and that is what is seen by pilgrims today in the main church. Today this statue is displayed in the Basilica of the Eternal Father, the only basilica in the world dedicated to God the father in the Catholic trinity. Pilgrimage Every year starting on the first Sunday of July thousands of pilgrims arrive in Trindade to pray to the \\"Divino Pai Eterno\\" (Divine Holy Father). The festival lasts for fifteen days and attracts an estimated population of close to one million visitors, one of the largest religious festivals in Brazil. From Goi√¢nia to Trindade the distance is 18 kilometers and the road is called a Rodovia dos Romeiros (The highway of the Pilgrims). It is lined with outdoors lit up by spotlights showing the stages of the cross, the Via Sacra, painted by a local artist Omar Souto. The artist incorporated contemporary events into the pictures, for example, Leide das Neves, victim of the accident with Cesio 137 in Goi√¢nia in 1987. The highlight of the celebration is a procession of several hundred \\"carros de boi\\" (ox carts), from all parts of the state. In 2003 alone 230 ox carts made their way through the streets of the town accompanied by almost two thousand riders. Close to one hundred thousand people witness the parade, perhaps the largest parade of ox carts in the world. See City of Trindade for photos. Basilica of Trindade at Christmas Square of Trindade Trindade (Goi√°s) Political Information In September 2020 the mayor was J√¢nio Carlos Alves Freire. There were 35 members on the city council and the number of eligible voters was 81,150 in September 2020. Demographic Information The population density was 170,72 inhabitants/km2 in 2016. The population has increased by almost 70,000 since 1980. The majority of the inhabitants lived in the urban area‚Äî94,515 in 2007 while there were 2,976 people living in the rural area. The economy In addition to the tourists and pilgrims who flock to Trindade to pray to the Holy Trinity, Trindade is becoming an industrial center. Today there are approximately 150 industries producing ceramic, aluminum byproducts, paint, soft drinks, and clothes, and leather. The biggest employers in the town are Refrescos Bandeirantes (Coca-Cola) and Ind√∫stria e Com√©rcio de Bebidas Taguatinga S/A (Grupo Imperial/Antarctica). In 2006 there was 1 meat-packing plant, 2 dairies, and 4 financial institutions. Despite the proximity to Goi√¢nia and the rapid industrialization, Trindade still has a substantial cattle herd with 78,000 head in 2006, of which 25,000 were milking cows. There were also 11,000 pigs and 64,000 poultry. Trindade is also a big producer of fruits, especially citrus fruits, bananas, and tomatoes.

As the Model T and TT became obsolete and needed to be replaced, Henry Ford began initial designs on the Model A and Model AA in 1926. Basic chassis layout was done rapidly and mechanical development was moved forward quickly. Body design and style was developed and then outsourced to various body manufacturers, including Briggs and Murray. The designs of the Model A shared parts and materials with the Model AA Ford, notably the body, engine and interior. The AA usually received plainer interiors than their car counterparts. The Model AA followed similar design changes to the Model A during the AA's four years in production, often delayed anywhere from three to nine months. The mechanical changes and upgrades were done during production of the vehicles. Body changes that occurred between 1929 and 1930 were also integrated into AA production, but leftover parts were used longer in the heavy commercial trucks. Mechanical details The Model AA Ford is powered by the same 201-cubic-inch (3.3 L) engine I4 engine that the Model A Ford used. The engine produced a maximum of 40 horsepower at 2,200 rpm. The engine featured an up-draft carburetor, six-volt generator, 2 and 4-blade fan, mechanical water pump, mechanical oil pump, electric starter and four-row radiator. All of these features were identical to the Model A Ford except the radiator. The engine could also be crank started if necessary by a hand crank that is inserted through a hole in the radiator shell. The Model AA was based on a chassis that was similar in design to the Model A Ford, except it was substantially larger and heavier to accommodate the work this truck was designed for. Model AA Ford has a four-speed manual gearbox. The additional gear in the transmission is a \\"granny\\" or \\"creeper\\" first gear with a higher reduction ratio than the first gear on a Model A Ford to provide more torque to move a loaded truck. The second through fourth gears on the Model AA transmission were similar ratios to the first through third gears on the Model A transmission. The Model AA transmission also featured a lock-out on the shift knob for reverse that required a lever to be activated with the thumb so reverse could be engaged. This was done to prevent accidental engagement of reverse while the truck was in motion. Early trucks had a worm gear rear-end that limited the top speed of the truck. That rear-end was replaced by a ring and pinion differential to improve the speed of the truck. The later differential came with high speed and low speed options. Later models were fitted with braces on the outer casing of the rear-end to provide additional support to the rear-end housing. The suspension of the AA Truck was similar to the Model A Ford in the front end. A leaf spring is centered in the front ‚ÄòA‚Äô frame over the front axle. Shock absorbers were available for the front end. The rear suspension differed from the Model A Ford. The AA had leaf springs mounted to the chassis and shackled to the rear axle. The rear suspension did not have shocks. Final assembly of the GAZ-AA., 1943 The controls in the Model AA are entirely mechanical, except the windshield wipers in later models. The brakes are mechanical and the truck has four oversized drum brakes to stop the vehicle. The mechanical system is a pull lever system that applies the force from the pedal to a pivot that pulls the brake rods that expand the brakes in the drums. The brake light is activated when the brake pedal is pushed. The brakes are proportioned more toward the rear drums. The parking brake is a chrome lever on the floor with a release button on the top. The windshield wipers started as hand operated and later models were powered by vacuum diverted from the intake manifold. The horn button is mounted in the middle of the steering wheel assembly. Controls for the lights are also incorporated into the steering assembly. The switch was a three-stop switch for parking lights, headlights and high-beams. The tail-light lens colors on the AA underwent several changes during the production run. Two levers are mounted on the steering column to adjust the engine. The left lever controls the manual advance and retard of the timing. Adjusting the timing of the engine changes the time that a spark will occur in the combustion chamber and those changes affect the performance of the engine. The right lever is a manual control for the throttle. The throttle can be adjusted to ease the shifting of the transmission and the idling speed of the engine. Underneath the dash on the right side is the choke rod. The choke can adjust the flow of fuel from the carburetor into the engine. Turning the knob on the choke rod clockwise closes the fuel flow, leaning out the engine; turning the knob counterclockwise opens the fuel flow to the engine. The gauge cluster includes three basic gauges. The cluster is in a diamond formation, with the start key and pop-out locking switch is on the left point. The top of the cluster holds the gas gauge, which directly connects into the gas tank, behind the dashboard. The right point holds the amp gauge, which shows the charge rate of the generator. The bottom of the dash holds the speedometer and odometer. Additional gauges can be mounted below the cluster if desired. During the production of the Model AA, the wheels were also changed. Spoked wheels similar in appearance to Model A wheels but much heavier were used during 1928. Twenty inch 6 slot disc wheels were produced by Budd for Ford during 1929. In 1930, a new style 20 inch 5 slot disc wheel was adopted. These wheels were used for 1930 and part of 1931. The final wheels were a further modification of the 1930 wheel, with a raised center to reinforce the wheels and allow spacing of dual wheels in the rear so the tires would not rub against each other. The dual wheels were used for a variety of body styles, including dump trucks, tow trucks, tankers, fire trucks, and flatbed stake trucks. Wheel nuts changed with each new style of wheel to meet the changes made in the designs of the wheel. Special wheels were produced for ambulances, buses, and funeral coaches (hearses).  Variants  1930 Model AA The Model AA was available with a number of options. Two wheelbases were available, and . Various body styles were available on different chassis. The Model AA Ford was available in a variety of body styles from the Ford Corporation. Specialty bodies include: Funeral Coach, Ambulance, Express Pickup, Dump Truck, and a cab without a bed. The cab only model was sold to customers who wanted a custom body to be built by an after-market company. Corporations could have custom paint and other modifications made by Ford for fleets of vehicles. The U.S. Postal Service purchased a fleet of vehicles from Ford that had custom built bodies by outside builders.  Overseas production  1929 Ford Model AA at the Texas Transportation Museum Ford licensed the manufacture of the Model A and AA to a variety of nations, notably the Soviet Union. More than 985,000 AAs were built by GAZ in the USSR from 1932 to 1950. The GAZ version had a cargo capacity of . A model with stronger engine and wartime simplifications is often named GAZ‚ÄìMM, after the engine.M20 ¬´Pobeda¬ª, nr. 58, DeAgostini, 2014, ISSN 2305-4026 , p.4 In October 1931 a Model AA was the first vehicle produced at Ford of Britain's own new Dagenham plant in England. The Model AA was also built in several nations in mainland Europe under license from the Ford Corporation. At least three Danish armored vehicles (FP-1, FP-2, and FP-3) were based on the chassis.Danish Army Vehicles, retrieved on October 17, 2007.Ford AA truck 1931 (FP 1 - 3)  Present day  A 1929 AA still working in Montevideo, Uruguay, in 2005 Today, enthusiasm for the Model AA continues.

It was published in three volumes by Tokyopop from October 11, 2005 to December 11, 2007. Dramacon is considered one of Tokyopop's best OEL manga. Plot Dramacon focuses on Christie Leroux, a fledgling teenage writer who is debuting her manga with her artist boyfriend, Derek Hollman, at her first anime convention. Christie endures Derek ignoring her along with the culture shock of men in schoolgirl uniforms. During the three-day convention, Christie meets Lida Zeff, a famous manga artist and writer, who gives her advice on improving her manga, and Matt Green, a mysterious sun-glasses wearing cosplayer, whom she develops feelings for. Matt always wears sunglasses to conceal the fact that his eye is missing. Derek witnesses Matt and Christie kissing, and confronts her while drunk. During the argument, he attacks and attempts to rape her; however, she escapes to Matt's room, which leads Derek and Matt to fight. Christie spends her last day with Matt, his sister Sandra, and Greta, a friend of theirs. They have to wait another whole year before they see each other again since Christie is still in high school and lives on the east coast while Matt lives on the west coast and attends college. A year later, Christie returns to the convention with Bethany, a new artist. Christie discovers that Matt now has a girlfriend named Emily. While Christie deals with her feelings for Matt, Bethany faces off with a disgruntled manga purist and is offered a job at Mangapop. Lida Zeff helps the two girls with advice for Bethany about living in a manga publishing world. Emily pulls off Matt's sunglasses in a crowded fast food restaurant after a feud with a bystander, and he is then horrified at the people staring at him, so he runs off. When Christie chases after him, Matt tells her to \\"piss off\\". The next day, Christie runs away from him when he tries to apologize, and refuses his kiss. They part without saying good-bye. Bethany and Christie leave the convention with a promise to cosplay the next year and to continue to work hard on their manga. At the next convention, Christie meets up with Matt, but her friends follow her, and she constantly argues with Matt. She runs into Derek, which brings back the memories of him attacking her, but sees that he now has a pregnant fianc√©e. Matt and Christie try to control their tempers, with Matt particularly trying to hold his biting retorts, and they seem to have made up, even with Emily still around and finding ways to break into their dates as a form of payback for last year. Meanwhile, Bethany refuses to cosplay after learning that her mother is coming to the convention. She argues with her mother about her career choice; after her mom is in a car accident, Beth leaves the convention to be by her side in the hospital and they reconcile. Bethany gains her mother's blessing to pursue a job with Mangapop. Christie and company all leave the convention considerably happier than the past year. Development The initial concept of Dramacon was about \\"a girl who meets a cosplayer, and there would be all kinds of obstacles and drama that they'd have to overcome.\\" Svetlana Chmakova attended anime conventions regularly and came up with the concept of the series when she encountered the same cosplayer at the same convention for two years. She explained: Tokyopop discovered Chmakova through her web comic Chasing Rainbows, rather than through its annual Rising Stars of Manga competition, where many of its OEL manga authors were found. She wrote the first volume as \\"a piece of fluff\\" and \\"just wanted to have fun with it.\\" She left the ending of the first volume open since she was unsure if other volumes would be published. While writing the series, she tried to make the story as realistic as possible. Chmakova also liked the idea of Dramacon being an anime, but did not think that it was likely to happen. Chmakova has moved on to create her next series, Nightschool, and says in regard to future volumes of Dramacon, \\"It is extremely unlikely it will ever happen because Tokyopop has a tight grip on the rights and is not currently publishing new titles.\\" Release Written and illustrated by Svetlana Chmakova, Dramacon is published by Tokyopop in three volumes from October 11, 2005 to December 11, 2007. Tokyopop later re-released in the series in one volume, Dramacon Ultimate Edition (), on October 7, 2008. Madman Entertainment distributes the series in New Zealand and Australia. Dramacon is also licensed in France by Albin Michel, in Germany by Tokyopop Germany, in Portugal by Edi√ß√µes Asa, in Hungary by Mangattack, in Finland by Pauna Media Group, and in Japan by Soft Bank Creative. =Volume list=Reception Dramacon was positively received by English-language readers. The second volume reached the 8th spot in Bookscan's Top 10 and reached the 89th spot on the list of the top 100 best-selling graphic novels with 1,155 copies sold. The third volume debuted at the 82nd spot with 1,246 copies sold. Mike Toole of Anime Jump stated: \\"It's a comic that's sly and indulgent to anime fans, but still accessible, attractive, and wickedly funny.\\" PopCultureShock's Erin Finnegan commented that the second Dramacon volume \\"is a compelling read, but at times it comes off more like an internet forum discussion than an actual volume of manga.\\" Johanna Draper Carlson, a longtime reviewer for Publishers Weekly, recommended the first volume and described it as \\"an instant classic\\". Carlson listed the second volume as one of the best of 2006, but criticized the final volume for focusing mostly on Bethany's struggle as an aspiring artist instead of Matt and Christie's relationship. =Recognitions= Dramacon tied with Fred Gallagher's Megatokyo for About.com's Best Continuing OEL Manga of 2007. Dramacon was nominated for a 2006 Harvey Award, and a 2007 Will Eisner Award. It was also on the 2005 Publishers Weekly list of best comics, and YALSA picked it as one of the top graphic novels in 2007 for teens.

Merriam-Webster‚Äôs Collegiate Dictionary. Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster, Inc., 2003.Soanes, Catherine, and Angus Stevenson, eds. Concise Oxford English Dictionary. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. Homoiousianism arose as an attempt to reconcile two opposite teachings, homoousianism and homoianism. Following Trinitarian doctrines of the First Council of Nicaea (325), homoousians believed that God the Son was of the same (, hom√≥s, \\"same\\") essence with God the Father. On the other hand, homoians refused to use the term (ous√≠a, \\"essence\\"), believing that God the Father is \\"incomparable\\" and therefore the Son of God can not be described in any sense as \\"equal\\" or \\"same\\" but only as \\"like\\" or \\"similar\\" (, h√≥moios) to the Father, in some subordinate sense of the term. In order to find a theological solution that would reconcile those opposite teachings, homoiousians tried to compromise between the essence-language of homoousians and the notion of similarity, held by homoians. Their attempt failed, and by the First Council of Constantinople (381) homoiousianism was already marginalized. Proponents of this view included Eustathius of Sebaste and George of Laodicea.Cross, F. L., and Elizabeth A. Livingstone, eds. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. Background During the period of the development of Christian doctrine and refinement of Christian theological language which ran from AD 360 to 380, the controversy between Arianism and what would eventually come to be defined as catholic orthodoxy provoked an enormous burgeoning of new movements, sects and doctrines which came into existence in the attempt to stabilize and consolidate a unique and universal position on complex and subtle theological questions. One of the central questions concerned the nature of God and the fundamental character of his relationship with his Son Jesus Christ as the preexistent Logos. This controversy was called the \\"trinitarian controversy\\" because it involved solving the riddle of how it was possible that God the Father, His Son Jesus the Word, and the Holy Spirit could be one God. The dominant position among Christian theologians at this point in history was the doctrine of homoousianism, articulated and fiercely defended by Athanasius of Alexandria, according to which Father and Son were identical in essence, divine identity, attributes and energies, and that any deviations from this orthodoxy were to be considered heretical departures from apostolic faith and worship. The Homoians, however, had a powerful ally on their side in the person of Emperor Constantius II. Doctrine The Homoiousians took a moderate stance between that of the Homoousians, and heteroousian such as A√´tius and Eunomius. At a council in 358 at Sirmium, at the height of the movement's influence, the claim was made that the Son is \\"like [the Father] in all [respects]\\" (, h√≥moion kat√† p√°nta), while the use of (ous√≠a) or any of its compounds in theological discussion was strongly criticized but not abandoned, and the Anomoeans were anathematized. This compromise solution, which was satisfying to both the Homoians and the Homoiousians, deliberately set out to alienate the more extreme Neo-Arians. It was successful in this intent but it remained as illegitimate in the eyes of the pro-Nicenes as ever and Basil of Ancyra declared that \\"that which is like can never be the same as that to which it is like\\". On the other side, Constantius was becoming somewhat hostile to the influence of all of the new movements which had sprung up after the Nicene council. The result was that the Homoiousians disappeared from the stage of history and the struggle to define Church dogma became a two-sided battle between the Homoousians and the Homoians. The term \\"homoiousios\\" was also preferred by many Origenists over the term \\"homoousios\\" because they felt it left \\"more room for distinctions in the Godhead\\". Another consideration may have been the association of the latter term with Paul of Samosata and with Gnosticism's Platonic chain of being. ReferencesBibliography  * External links * .

On the basis of his academic record he was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society. In 1874, he had become one of the first African Americans to graduate from Yale College. Although Bouchet was elected to Phi Beta Kappa along with other members of the Yale class of 1874, the official induction did not take place until 1884, when the Yale chapter was reorganized after thirteen years of inactivity. Because of the circumstances, Bouchet was not the first African American elected to Phi Beta Kappa as many historical accounts state; that honor belongs to George Washington Henderson (University of Vermont). Bouchet was also among the first 20 Americans (of any race) to receive a Ph.D. in physics and was the sixth to earn a Ph.D. in physics from Yale.Biography of Dr. Edward A. BouchetPhysicists of the African Diaspora Early life Bouchet at Yale, Edward Bouchet was born at home in New Haven, Connecticut, to parents William Bouchet, a former slave, and Susan (Cooley) Bouchet. At that time, there were only three schools in New Haven that accepted black children. Bouchet was enrolled in the Artisan Street Colored School with only one teacher, who nurtured Bouchet's academic abilities. He attended the New Haven High School from 1866 to 1868 and then Hopkins School from 1868 to 1870, where he was named valedictorian (after graduating first in his class).Edward Alexander Bouchet Bio He ranked sixth in his class on graduation from Yale. Bouchet‚Äôs doctoral thesis centered on measuring the refractive indices of various glasses. Professional life Bouchet was unable to find a university teaching position after college, because of racial discrimination. Bouchet moved to Philadelphia in 1876 and took a position at the Philadelphia's Institute for Colored Youth (now Cheyney University of Pennsylvania), where he taught physics and chemistry for the next 26 years. He resigned in 1902 at the height of the W. E. B. Du Bois-Booker T. Washington controversy over the need for an industrial vs. collegiate education for blacks. Bouchet spent the next 14 years holding a variety of jobs around the country. Between 1905 and 1908, Bouchet was director of academics at St. Paul's Normal and Industrial School in Lawrenceville, Virginia (presently, St. Paul's College). He was then principal and teacher at Lincoln High School in Gallipolis, Ohio from 1908 to 1913. He joined the faculty of Bishop College in its Marshall, Texas in 1913. Illness finally forced him to retire in 1916 and he moved back to New Haven. He died there, in his childhood home, in 1918, at age of 66. He had not married, had no children and was a Republican.Frank Lincoln Mather, \\"Who's who of the Colored Race\\", 1915 Legacy The American Physical Society (APS Physics) confers the Edward A.

The Act specifies that, if two or more people die within 120 hours of one another, and no will or other document provides for this situation explicitly, each is considered to have predeceased the others. However, the Act contains a clause that states if the end result would be an intestate estate escheating to the state, the 120-hour rule is not to be applied. The Act was promulgated in 1940, when it was adopted by all 48 then- existing states. It was last amended in 1993. , 19 states (Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin), as well as the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands have explicitly adopted the Act in its current version. A number of other states have indirectly adopted the Act as part of the Uniform Probate Code. Inheritance The Act primarily helps to determine the heirs of a person who has died intestate. For example, Alice and Bob are a married, retired couple with no offspring. They die in a plane crash, and it cannot be determined which person died first. Neither had executed a will, so both Alice's and Bob's families claim inheritance of the couple's estate. The court uses the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act to resolve the dispute. In accordance with the Act, Alice is considered to have predeceased Bob, but Bob is also considered to have predeceased Alice. The inheritance is divided equally among their closest living relatives, according to degree of kinship. The 120-hour period is intended to simplify estate administration by preventing an inheritance from being transferred more times than necessary. For example, assume that the Act does not exist. Alice dies immediately, but Bob dies in the hospital the next day. Because Bob outlives Alice, he would inherit her estate, and Bob's heirs would inherit the combined estate the next day. This would increase the legal costs involved, and cause Alice's estate to be subject to tax twice: once alone, and once as part of Bob's. However, if tax was paid in Alice's estate, Bob's would receive a Federal Estate Tax credit for the same property transferred by Alice (state death and inheritance tax provisions may differ). Under the Act, neither inherits the other's estate, each is taxed separately, and their heirs inherit both estates once. Insurance The Act may also help to resolve a life insurance case where the insured and beneficiary die in a common disaster. Different rules apply for insurance. For example, Carol has a life insurance policy through her employer. Her husband Dave is its beneficiary. They are both killed in a car crash, dying at or near the same time. If Carol has named a secondary beneficiary in her policy, that person will receive the life insurance benefit. If Carol has not named a secondary beneficiary, then it is assumed that she outlived Dave, and the benefit is inherited through Carol's estate.

His father, John Denny (1793‚Äì1875), fought in the western battles of the War of 1812 and later served in the Illinois state legislature, elected as a Whig. (He eventually traveled west with the Denny Party, but stayed on in Oregon's Willamette River Valley when Arthur and several others moved north to Puget Sound.)Dorothea Nordstrand, Denny Party on the Oregon Trail, HistoryLink, February 15, 2004. Accessed online 10 March 2008. Denny did not have an easy childhood. He cared for his invalid mother while attending half-days in a log schoolhouse. He learned carpentry, taught school, studied surveying, and became a civil engineer and Knox County surveyor starting in 1843. In 1843, he married Mary Ann Boren; together they had six children: Louisa Catherine Frye, Margaret Leona Denny, Rolland Herschell Denny, Orion Orvil Denny, Arthur Wilson Denny, and Charles Latimer Denny. In 1851, he led the Denny Party west. Leaving Illinois in April, they arrived in Portland, Oregon on August 23. In November, he sailed on to Puget Sound, arriving at Alki Point on Elliott Bay on November 13, 1851. It soon became clear that Alki was not the best spot for a settlement. The Denny Party relocated to the east shore of Elliott Bay, near what is now Pioneer Square, the original heart of what became the city of Seattle. Career Denny Hall, University of Washington On February 15, 1852, Denny and others filed their claims. Denny soon established himself selling cargo on commission for ship captains. On November 25, 1852, Denny was a delegate at the Monticello Convention that produced a petition to US Congress to split the Oregon Territory, creating the Washington Territory, which would later become the state of Washington. In 1854 when he began a general merchandise partnership with Dexter Horton and David Phillips. In 1855, he volunteered to serve in the Indian War then taking place in Washington Territory. He served in several political offices. He was a county commissioner first for Thurston County (in what was then still part of the Oregon Territory), and then, after Washington became a separate territory, for King County, where Seattle is located. He also served as Seattle's first postmaster and in the territorial House of Representatives for nine consecutive terms, including serving a term as speaker. From 1861 to 1865 he was registrar of the General Land Office. He served as territorial delegate to the thirty-ninth United States Congress. Denny soon turned from politics to business. He returned to being a partner with Horton and Phillips, this time by taking a half interest in Dexter Horton and Co., the bank founded by Horton and Phillips in 1870, which would eventually become Seattle-First National Bank.Bill Virgin, Come Monday, Seafirst name is history, Seattle Post- Intelligencer, September 24, 1999. Accessed online 8 March 2008. (Seattle- First National Bank was later named Seafirst Bank and after being purchased was later rebranded as part of Bank of America.) He was president of the Seattle and Walla Walla Railroad Company and an investor in the Great Western Iron and Steel Company. Later in life, he was active in Society of Washington Pioneers and wrote a memoir, Pioneer Days in Puget Sound. Among his other achievements, he was involved in founding the University of Washington and donated much of the land for its original site.Debera Carlton Harrell, Getting to know the real Denny, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, October 23, 2003.

Personality and politics Denny was an ascetic,Roger Sale, Seattle, Past to Present, University of Washington Press, 1978, , p. 25. a devout Christian (conservative in his religion to the point of opposing a divorce law), and a lifelong teetotaler. Indeed, he was teetotal to the point where he had the customers of his store buy their liquor direct from visiting ship captains so that he would not be involved in the transactions. He was a political conservative, and a cautious and conservative businessman and investor. Denny, in his memoir, described his decision to head north from Portland to Puget Sound as a \\"desperate venture\\". Lorraine McConaghy, historian at Seattle's Museum of History and Industry, agrees, but characterizes it further as \\"the only one he ever undertook.\\" =Women's suffrage= Denny supported the right of women to vote, going so far as to introduce legislation in 1854 to allow white women of 18 years and older the right to vote. The resolution was voted down. =Argument over land= This dour man is nonetheless remembered for at least one example of his wit. Also in his memoir, recounting his failure in 1853 to reach agreement with David Swinson \\"Doc\\" Maynard over what was intended to be a joint plat of the town of Seattle, he wrote, \\"it was found that the doctor, who occasionally stimulated a little, had that day taken enough to cause him to feel that he was not only monarch of all he surveyed, but what Boren and I had surveyed as well.\\"Arthur Denny, Pioneer Days in Puget Sound (1888). Accessed online 8 March 2008. It was later shown in a review done by a professional engineering firm on behalf of the city that it was in fact Denny that was wrong about the direction the streets should run and had actually violated the law in his plat of the city.

Apaharan was declared semi Hit at the Indian box-office. Plot Ajay Shastri (Ajay Devgn) is an unemployed, honest graduate who dreams of joining the police force. His father, Raghuvansh Shastri (Mohan Agashe) is a highly principled and moralistic man. An ex-schoolteacher and Gandhi follower, now a social activist, Prof. Shastri expects his son to follow in his steps and believe in his ideals and values. When his father's ideals start clashing with Ajay's ideologies, a rift between father and son emerges. Ajay borrows a lot of money, with the help of his friend (Ayub Khan) and bribes higher officials to get his name on the police force merit list. When Ajay's father discloses the corruption scandal to the media, things go awry, and left with pressure from his creditors, Ajay and his friend decide to kidnap a government official to repay the amount. The kidnapping goes wrong at the last minute. It turns out that the victim is under protection of Gaya Singh (Yashpal Sharma), one of Tabrez Alam's (Nana Patekar) henchmen. Tabrez Alam is a powerful MLA and influential Muslim party leader, who is also an underworld don and controller of a large kidnapping racket. Ajay and his friends are brought to jail. Gaya Singh and his men assault and humiliate Ajay and his friends, for meddling in their racket. Ajay pleads with the DSP, Shukla, to save him, who has recently developed strained relations with Gaya Singh due to severe conflict of opinions. DSP Shukla helps Ajay and his friends escape jail. Ajay then kidnaps Sooraj Mal, one of the leading businessman and a rising figure in local politics, who was for long, a target of Tabrez Alam and Gaya Singh, but neither could do the job because of the high security provided to him. Gaya Singh goes frantic upon learning about the kidnapping and is on the lookout of killer. DSP Shukla and Ajay join forces and lure Gaya Singh into a trap. Gaya Singh heads to a location where Ajay is told to be hiding. Gaya Singh soon learns that he has been trapped and Ajay kills him after a brief fight. He surrenders himself to Tabrez, and requests him to recruit him into his gang. Tabrez sees potential in Ajay and allows him to be a part of his gang. Ajay starts working hard and rapidly rises in the ranks of Tabrez's empire. He takes Ajay in and places him higher than his own brother Usmaan (Mukul Nag), with an ulterior motive. Swimming in power, Ajay becomes the state's most powerful gangster and, under Tabrez's authority, the head of Bihar's most successful kidnapping trade, which Ajay consolidates by killing smaller players and removing all competitors. The state's home minister's wife is caught on camera taking money and the scandal becomes the hottest news. The home minister offers Ajay to leave Tabrez Alam and join forces with him. He then provides the taped conversation between him and Ajay (which he surreptitiously records) to Tabrez to create differences between them. Meanwhile, news correspondent Akash Ranjan calls a press conference to clarify the scandal involving the home minister inviting a discussion. Tabrez sends Ajay to kill Akash so that he would bring a no-confidence motion against the government, bringing its fall. He would come to power by taking advantage of the political instability. Ajay is contacted by SP Anwar Khan who makes him aware of Tabrez's real motive. Ajay reaches the press conference venue only to find out that the real person behind the ongoing debate of bribery scandal is his father. He leaves without killing Akash Ranjan and is confronted by DSP Shukla, who is sent by Tabrez Alam to kill Ajay, but Ajay manages to kill Shukla and escape. Ajay surrenders himself to SP Khan and gives his statement revealing everything about Tabrez Alam's illegal activities. This report is presented to the home minister by the commissioner of police citing Tabrez Alam's arrest warrant. The home minister makes a deal with Tabrez Alam, to destroy the evidence against him in exchange for money and power, and both join hands to form new government in the state with the help of their respective MLA support. SP Khan is sorry for Ajay as all his efforts are ruined by the political upheaval. Ajay goes home one last time with the help from SP Khan where he watches his father reminiscing about him and make amends with him after knowing how much he loved him. He goes back to prison where Tabrez comes to meet him after becoming the new home minister of the state. He gloats in front of Ajay at the jail. Ajay suddenly takes out his pistol and guns down Tabrez. Upon hearing then gunshots, Tabrez's men enter the room and shoot Ajay, bringing an end to their lives.

It has been the home stadium of League Two club Forest Green Rovers since 2006. During the 2007‚Äì08 season the stadium was shared with Gloucester City. The stadium has a capacity of 5,140, of which 2,000 is seated. It replaced The Lawn Ground as Forest Green Rovers' home stadium and is expected to be replaced by a new stadium development located near the M5 motorway. Stadium The stadium was due to cost the club ¬£3 million and was approved in October 2003 by local council members, despite much local opposition due to the controversial siting of the development on school playing fields.Stroud News & Journal (26 Feb 2003). Sale of land robs children. Press Release. Work started on the stadium on 3 May 2005. The new ground has facilities to house 230 car parking places, 3 coach parking places, a capacity of 5,147 and two seated stands - the main stand and another seated stand. The stadium also has a leisure club, gym, sauna, conference and meeting facilities as well as a pub and many other facilities. The stadium is used seven days a week for different events. The closest railway station to the stadium is Stroud. The stadium was first used in a pre season friendly against Swindon Town in July 2006 and was officially opened in September 2006 when the England C team played a friendly fixture against Forest Green. The largest attendance so far at The New Lawn was in a FA Cup third round game against Derby County in January 2009 when 4836 watched Forest Green narrowly lose 3-4. For the 2007‚Äì08 season Gloucester City shared the ground due to serious flooding at their home ground but have since moved to Evesham United, after spells at Cirencester Town and Cheltenham Town. In April 2009, The New Lawn hosted the Conference League Cup final between Forest Green and AFC Telford United in which Telford won the game 0-3 on penalty kicks following the 90 minutes finishing goalless. The match was shown live on Setanta Sports. In December 2009 the ground was selected as part of the city of Bristol's 2018 FIFA World Cup bid to act as a training ground facility. In June 2011, work began on the pitch at the stadium to make it the first organic football pitch in the world. This was then followed in December 2011 by the installation of 180 solar panels to the EESI stand to help the club generate its own electricity. In April 2012, the club introduced the first solar powered robotic lawn mower to be used on a football pitch in British football. The Etesia robot mower - known as a 'mow bot' - uses GPS technology to automatically guide it round the pitch without the need for human intervention. In August 2012, a Manchester United XI played a pre-season friendly at the ground in aid of the Sustainability in Sport foundation which was created by Forest Green chairman Dale Vince and Gary Neville. On 25 August 2014, a BT Sport televised Conference National derby game with Bristol Rovers saw 3,781 in attendance, the highest ever recorded league attendance at the stadium. The stadium hosted what is believed to be the world's first ever vegan football match on 1 November 2014 in a Conference National game against Lincoln City. The match received support from Paul and Stella McCartney. Environmental features Following the investment of new chairman and eco- tycoon Dale Vince, and his company Ecotricity, The New Lawn employs a number of eco-friendly features designed to help make the stadium one of the most environmentally sustainable football stadiums in the world. The playing surface features as the world's first organic football pitch, meanwhile solar panels on the roof of the stadium as well as outside will eventually provide enough electricity to power 25 per cent of the stadium. The pitch also collects rainwater to be recycled around the stadium and all waste cooking oil at the club is recycled into biofuel. The club introduced a solar powered 'MowBot' in April 2012 which cuts the grass on the pitch and uses GPS technology to automatically guide it round the pitch without the need for human intervention. It is the first solar powered robotic lawn mower to be used on a football pitch in British football. Local farmers use the grass cuttings from the stadium to condition their soil plus the stadium is the first meat-free football stadium in the country after the club changed to an environmentally sustainable menu in February 2011. The area outside the stadium has also been developed into a habitat for wildlife through the planting of wild flowers and native trees. In December 2012, the club beat 200 other nominees to first prize in the Institute of Groundsmanship awards in the sustainability and environmental category for its organic pitch and the environmental aspects at The New Lawn.

He would eventually rise to the highest heraldic office in England and serve as Garter Principal King of Arms. Family origins Gilbert Dethick claimed descent from a family originally seated at Dethick Hall in Derbyshire. However, Ralph Brooke, York Herald of Arms in Ordinary, claimed his progenitor was one Robert Dericke, a Dutchman who came to England with Erasmus Crukenez, yeoman armourer to Henry VIII. Robert married Agatha, daughter of Matthias Leydendecker, a Dutch barber from Acon, near the Dutch border with Germany, who also became an armourer to Henry VIII. This Robert and Agatha had three sons: Dericke, Matthias and Gilbert. Gilbert later procured denization from Parliament for himself and his brothers. This alone casts doubt upon the later claim of a Derbyshire origin. All three brothers prospered in England. Personal details Gilbert Dethick first married Alice, daughter of Leonard Peterson, a Dutchman, but Alice died on 13 January 1572. Dethick then married Jane, daughter of Richard Duncomb of Moreton, Buckinghamshire and widow of William Naylor, one of the six clerks in chancery. In his first marriage, Dethick had three sons: Nicholas Dethick, who would become Windsor Herald of Arms in Ordinary; Sir William Dethick, who would become Garter Principal King of Arms like his father, and Henry Dethick, Chancellor of the Diocese of Carlisle. In his second marriage, Dethick had one son, Robert, and a daughter, Mary. For notes on William Flower, Norroy king-of-arms, and Robert Glover, Portcullis, see the introduction by F. R. Raines to the 1567 Visitation of Lancaster, pub. 1870 by the Chetham Society, v.81. Like Sir Gilbert, Flower and Glover came from merchant and yeoman families. In the Middle Ages would have been clerks in the household of a monarch or great nobleman, or in the church. These heralds were publicly honoured, if not well remunerated, for careful scholarship. This is another indication that the upper classes in Tudor and Stuart England were more accepting of \\"new men\\" than their continental counterparts. Heraldic career Dethick entered the College of Arms at the age of sixteen and was created Hampnes Pursuivant of Arms Extraordinary on 16 June 1536 at Hampton Court. The office was named for Hampnes, now Hames, a castle and village near Calais. He was appointed Rouge Croix Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary in December 1540, and was advanced to the office of Richmond Herald of Arms in Ordinary later in that same month. At the death of William Fellow, Norroy King of Arms, in December 1546, Dethick was nominated to succeed him, but it was not until the reign of Edward VI, on 16 August 1547, that his appointment was confirmed by letters patent. At the death of Sir Christopher Barker, Dethick was promoted to Garter Principal King of Arms on 20 April 1550. On 14 April 1549 Dethick was granted a knighthood. Dethick served his monarch in many capacities. It is presumed that he was an excellent linguist. He was sent on several missions to the Danish court to reclaim ships and was also sent to the Duke Cleves to negotiate the marriage of his daughter, Ann, with Henry VIII. He was also sent to represent Henry at the Diet of Ratisbon. He was rewarded by Henry VIII with a mansion and acre of land at Poplar, in the parish of Stepney, where his descendants resided for almost two centuries. In 1547 Sir Gilbert accompanied Lord Protector Somerset in his expedition against the Scots, and in 1549 he delivered a summons to surrender to rebels in Kent, Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk. He and William Flower, Chester Herald of Arms in Ordinary, accompanied William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton, in his 1551 mission to Paris, to invest Henry II of France with the Order of the Garter. Both officers of arms received ten shillings per day for food and lodging. During the reigns of both Mary and Elizabeth, Dethick was sent abroad on diplomatic missions, and at home it became his duty to proclaim declarations of war and treaties of peace. As the public voice of the monarch, he may have held an exalted view of his own dignity. Sir Gilbert Dethick was \\"unmanageable when a herald, very unsociable, insolent and tempestuous,\\" according to Mark Noble's History of the College of Arms, p. 186, 201. Sir Gilbert died in London 3 October 1584, and some records infer he was buried in the Church of St Benet Paul's Wharf. However, he is listed in St Paul's Cathedral on a monument in the crypt, as one of the important graves lost in the Great Fire of London in 1666.

Tarbert Island The nearby island is linked to the mainland by a short isthmus - the site of the boat portage that gave its name to both the island and the town. There is a car ferry service from the island to the town of Killimer, near Kilrush in Clare. This service, operated by Shannon Ferries, provides a link between the N69 in Kerry and the N68 in Clare. Also on the island is a small lighthouse and an electricity plant with four oil-fired turbines and a capacity of 640MW. This plant, opened in 1969, was the site of an explosion in 2003 that killed two workers and seriously injured another. The plant was due to be de- commissioned in 2010, with the loss of 130 jobs. However the plant was purchased by Spanish power company Endesa (Spain) in January 2009 securing the jobs for up to 75% of the staff and the remaining 25% will be redeployed within the ESB. The new owners plan to convert the plant to gas turbines by 2012, which should secure the future of the plant for decades to come. =Population=Tarbert Bridewell The Tarbert Bridewell is a former courthouse and prison situated in the village.

The term may cover Paleolithic religion, Mesolithic religion, Neolithic religion and Bronze Age religions.

Picture of a half-animal half-human being in a Paleolithic cave painting in Dordogne, France which archeologists believe may provide evidence for early shamanic practices A number of archeologists propose that Middle Paleolithic societies such as Neanderthal societies may also have practiced early forms of totemism or of animal worship. Emil B√§chler in particular suggests (based on archeological evidence from Middle Paleolithic caves) that a widespread Middle Paleolithic Neanderthal bear-cult existed (Wunn, 2000, p. 434-435). A claim that evidence was found for Middle Paleolithic animal worship c 70,000 BCE (originating from the Tsodilo Hills in the African Kalahari desert) has been denied by the original investigators of the site.World's Oldest Ritual Discovered  Worshipped The Python 70,000 Years Ago The Research Council of Norway (2006, November 30).

Retrieved March 2, 2008, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061130081347.htm Animal cults in the following Upper Paleolithic period, such as the bear cult, may have had their origins in these hypothetical Middle Paleolithic animal cults.. Animal worship during the Upper Paleolithic intertwined with hunting rites. For instance, archeological evidence from Paleolithic art and from bear remains reveals that the bear cult apparently had a type of sacrificial bear ceremonialism in which a bear was shot with arrows, then finished off with a shot in the lungs and ritualistically buried near a clay bear-statue covered by a bear fur, with the skull and the body of the bear buried separately. Neolithic There are no extant textual sources from the Neolithic era, the most recent available dating from the Bronze Age, and therefore all statements about any belief systems Neolithic societies may have possessed are glimpsed from archaeology. Jacques Cauvin suggested that the Neolithic Revolution was influenced by an important theme he termed the \\"Revolution of the Symbols\\", suggesting the birth of \\"religion\\" in the Neolithic. He argued that Neolithic humans were influenced by a change in thinking as much as changes in the environment and noted a series of stages in this process.Olivier Aurenche, Jacques Cauvin et la pr√©histoire du Levant, Pal√©orient, Volume 27, Number 27-2, pp. 5-11, 2001. His work suggested important concepts in the evolution of human thinking, by examining figurines and early art depicting first women as goddesses and bulls as gods, he suggested several important ideas about the evolution of perception and duality. The structures known as Circular Enclosures built in Central Europe during the 5th millennium BCE have been interpreted as serving a cultic function. In the case of the Goseck circle, remains of human sacrifice were found. Many of these structures had openings aligned with sunset and/or sunrise at the solstices, suggesting that they served as a means of maintaining a lunisolar calendar. The construction of Megalithic monuments in Europe also began in the 5th millennium, and continued throughout the Neolithic and in some areas well into the early Bronze Age. Marija Gimbutas, pioneer of feminist archaeology, put forward a notion of a \\"woman-centered\\" society surrounding \\"goddess worship\\" in Neolithic Europe. The Neolithic \\"matristic\\" cultures would have been replaced by patriarchy only with the arrival of the Bronze Age. Gimbutas' views on this matter do not have widespread support today.Archaeologist Sarah M. Nelson criticizes Gimbutas suggesting that she used the same techniques used in the past to disparage women but in this case to glorify them, and quotes another archaeologist, Pamela Russell, as saying \\"The archaeological evidence is, in some cases, distorted enough to make a careful prehistorian shudder\\".

Iron Age While the Iron Age religions of the Mediterranean, Near East, India and China are well attested in written sources, much of Iron Age Europe, from the period of about 700 BCE down to the Great Migrations, falls within the prehistoric period. There are scarce accounts of non-Mediterranean religious customs in the records of Hellenistic and Roman era ethnography. *Scythian mythology (Herodotus) *Indian mythology *Celtic polytheism (Posidonius) *Paleo-Balkan mythology *Germanic polytheism (Tacitus) *Slavic polytheism (Procopius) *Mythology of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples In the case of Circumpolar religion (Shamanism in Siberia, Finnic mythology), traditional African religions, native American religions and Pacific religions, the prehistoric era mostly ends only with the Early Modern period and European colonialism. These traditions were often only first recorded in the context of Christianization. For these reasons, the interpretations and understanding of the Iron Age cult in Europe has to rely primarily on archaeological material.

History Prior to the construction of the Ford Building, the site was the home to the Bell School and Zion Wesley Chapel. Construction of the building began in 1939 as part of the Works Progress Administration program. The building originally housed the United States Census Bureau from 1940 to 1942. Over the years, it was used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to house its Latent Print Unit. Thousands of fingerprint records were housed in the building, requiring manual search techniques to find a match. The unit was one of the first to move to the FBI's J. Edgar Hoover Building upon its completion in 1974. Following the FBI's departure, the building was purchased by the Architect of the Capitol and was renamed House Annex-2. In the late 1980s, the Democratic and Republican parties were each permitted to rename a House Annex building. The Republicans, then in the minority, chose to rename House Annex-2 the Ford Building after former President of the United States and House Minority Leader Gerald Ford, while the Democrats chose to rename House Annex-1 the O'Neill House Office Building after former Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill.

In 1999, she was named Singer of the Millennium along with Tina Turner by BBC Radio. Biography Her father Gomes Soares was a factory worker and guitarist, and her mother Ros√°ria Maria Gomes was a washerwoman. She was born in the Mo√ßa Bonita, a favela in the Padre Miguel neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. During her childhood, Soares played on the streets, spun wooden tops, flew kites, and fought with boys. Despite poverty and having to carry buckets of water on her head, she had a happy childhood. When she was 12, she was forced by her father to marry Lourdes Ant√¥nio Soares, also known as Ala√∫rdes, and within a year later gave birth to her first child, Jo√£o Carlos. Soares liked to sing, and when she needed money for her son, she participated in a vocal contest presented by Ary Barroso at Radio Tupi. She was given money for participating and was then able to buy the medicine. When she was fifteen, she gave birth to her second child, who died. After her husband became ill with tuberculosis, she began working at the Veritas soap factory in the Engenho de Dentro neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. At twenty-one she was a widow, alone to raise her children: four boys and one girl. She dreamed of becoming a singer. When she was thirty-two she had a relationship with soccer player Garrincha. She was vilified by Brazilian society, with many accusing her of breaking up his marriage. She was shouted at in the street, received death threats, and her house was pelted with eggs and tomatoes. On April 13, 1969 her mother died in a car accident. Garrincha, Soares, and her daughter Sara were also injured in this accident. Garrincha was driving drunk on Presidente Dutra highway when a truck merged into the lane. Everyone in the car was hurt, and Dona Ros√°rio was thrown from the vehicle and killed. Soares and Garrincha remained married for sixteen years (1968‚Äì1982). Garrincha's friends did not accept Soares as his wife, instead calling her a \\"witch.\\" Soares tried to curb her husband's dependence on alcohol by visiting bars and pleading with them not to serve her husband. The couple had one child, a boy, born in 1976. He was named after his father, Manuel Francisco dos Santos, and received the nickname Garrincha Jr. In 1983 Garrincha died of cirrhosis, which devastated Soares, though they were already separated. On January 11, 1986, her son died when he was 9 years old in a car accident as he was coming back from visiting his father's hometown, Mag√©. It had been raining and the driver lost control of the vehicle. The door opened and the boy was thrown into the Imbari√™ River. Soares was disconsolate and considered ending her own life. She left Brazil and toured Europe and the United States. After many years of searching for her long lost daughter, they were reunited after Soares returned to Brazil. On July 26, 2015 Soares lost her fifth son, Gerson, when he was 59 years old. He died of complications of a urinary tract infection. Soares had six children: Jo√£o Carlos, Gerson, Gilson, Dilma, Sara, and Garrincha. Career In the late 1950s, Soares spent one year touring Argentina with Mercedes Batista. She became popular with her first single \\"Se Acaso Voc√™ Chegasse\\", on which she introduced scat singing √† la Louis Armstrong, adding a bit of jazz to samba, however, Elza says that she did not know American music at the time.Elza Soares. Roda Viva, She moved to S√£o Paulo, where she performed at theaters and night clubs. Her husky voice became her trademark. After finishing her second album, A Bossa Negra, she went to Chile to represent Brazil in the 1962 FIFA World Cup and met Louis Armstrong. From 1967 to 1969, Soares recorded three albums with the record label Odeon, partnering with singer Miltinho. The albums were titled Elza, Miltinho e Samba (Volumes 1‚Äì3). The songs in these albums were mostly in the potpourri style with duets. The albums were produced by Milton Miranda and Herm√≠nio Bello de Carvalho and re-released on CD in 2003 by EMI-Odeon. In the 1970s, she toured the U.S. and Europe. In 2000, she was named Best Singer of the Millennium by the BBC in London, where she performed a concert with Gal Costa, Chico Buarque, Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, and Virg√≠nia Rodrigues. During the same year, she played a series of avant-garde concerts directed by Jos√© Miguel Wisnik in Rio de Janeiro. Soares scored a number of hits in Brazil throughout her career, including \\"Se Acaso Voc√™ Chegasse\\" (1960), \\"Boato\\" (1961), \\"Cadeira Vazia\\" (1961), \\"S√≥ Dan√ßo Samba\\" (1963), \\"Mulata Assanhada\\" (1965), and \\"Aquarela Brasileira\\" (1974). Elza Pede Passagem produced no major hit singles but it is considered representative of the samba-soul of the early 1970s. In 2002, her album Do C√≥ccix At√© O Pesco√ßo album earned a Grammy nomination. The album was recorded with Caetano Veloso, Chico Buarque, Carlinhos Brown, and Jorge Ben Jor. In 2004, Soares released Vivo Feliz with the single, \\"Rio de Janeiro\\", a homage to her city of birth. While not as successful in sales as her previous release, the album carried on the theme of mixing samba and bossa nova with modern electronic music and effects. The album included collaborations with Nando Reis, Fred 04 (former leader of mangue beat band Mundo Livre S/A), and Z√© Keti. In 2007, she was invited to sing a cappella the Brazilian National Anthem at the opening ceremony of the 2007 Pan American Games. Soares joined Jair Rodrigues and Seu Jorge for Sambistas (2009). In 2016, A Mulher do Fim do Mundo was released internationally with the translated title Woman at the End of the World. She also performed at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, where she sang \\"O Canto de Ossanha\\" by Baden Powell and Vinicius de Moraes. Her album A Mulher do Fim do Mundo was released in 2015. It was praised by critics as one of the best MPB albums of the past years. She won the award for Best Album in pop/rock/reggae/hip-hop/funk. This album was also nominated for Best Album of Brazilian Popular Music and Best Song in Portuguese at the 17th edition of the Latin Grammy Awards.

Summary The book is set in Tokyo in the mid-1990s. Twigger is living with two friends in a tiny apartment near central Tokyo. They all decide to enrol at the Yoshinkan Hombu Dojo in order to get fit and break out of their sedentary life-style. Soon after beginning regular training, Twigger decides that the only way to truly experience aikido is to do the Yoshinkan Senshusei course,Japantimes.co.jp a gruelling 11-month program to train up instructors of Yoshinkan aikido. The course consists of four hours of training, five days a week, in addition to dojo-cleaning duties, special training weekends and demonstrations. Twigger spends most of his time describing the rigor and sometimes agony of the very intensive course. He refers to doing kneeling techniques, or suwari-waza, until his knees bled, only to practice the next day and in so doing tear open the scabs. He describes techniques being performed with such vigor and intensity that smashing one's head into the mat was a frequent occurrence. Other experiences on the course include \\"hajime\\" sessions where one technique is performed repeatedly, without a break, sometimes for up to half-an-hour or more. During these sessions, trainees sometimes pass out or vomit, especially in the summer months. Instructors sometimes dish out punishments to trainees if they feel they are not pushing themselves enough, including rounds of push- ups, sit-ups and bunny hops. Other people featured in the book include several top Yoshinkan instructors, including Chida, Shioda and Chino, as well as Robert Mustard, the chief foreign instructor, David Rubens from England and Darren FriendDarren Friend from Australia. Teachers are sometimes portrayed as being quite cold and occasionally brutal and unsympathetic to the students, whom they are trying to push to greater and greater efforts in order to build their technique and \\"spirit\\". In addition, Twigger describes other aspects of Tokyo and his life there, including his relationship with his girlfriend and her family, his work at a Japanese high-school as an English teacher, and stories of living with his two flatmates. He also gives thoughts and observations about Japan and Japanese culture.Angry White Pyjamas The book was awarded the William Hill Sports Book of the Year in 1998.Telegraph.co.uk See also *Uchi-deshi References Category:1997 books Category:Aikido books ","title":"Angry White Pyjamas"},{"id":"3946892","text":"John O. Meusebach (May 26, 1812 ‚Äì May 27, 1897), born Otfried Hans Freiherr von Meusebach, was at first a Prussian bureaucrat, later an American farmer and politician who served in the Texas Senate, District 22. Early years John O. Meusebach was born May 26, 1814, in Dillenburg, Duchy of Nassau, to Baron Karl Hartwig Gregor von Meusebach, a judge solicitor, and Ernestine von Meusebach n√©e von Witzleben. He was the namesake of brother Orfried Isador (1806‚Äì1808) who died young. He had two older sisters, Ludowine and Caroline, and a younger brother Carl Bernhard. The children grew up in a home filled with music. Mother Ernestine was a pianist, and the family enjoyed entertaining visitors with the singing of poems, folk songs and hymns. The elder Meusebach, a poet himself, took delight in collecting German folk music and literature.King (1967) pp.6,7 As an adult, Meusebach stood 6 foot 2 inches tall with reddish-blonde hair.King (1967) p.52 Waco Indians near New Braunfels called him Ma-be-quo-si-to-mu, (Chief with the burning hair of the head).King (1967) p.67 Penateka Comanche Chief Ketemoczy (Katemcy) named him El Sol Colorado (The Red Sun).Morgenthaler (2007) p.66 Education and career In 1828, the Meusebach sons were enrolled in parochial school in Ro√üleben, and at the Mining and Forest Academy at Clausthal-Zellerfeld in the Harz mountains to study geology and the natural sciences. During this period, grandfather Christian Carl von Meusebach in Vockstedt took the young men on outdoor excursions to share their common interest in botany. Otfried enrolled in the University of Bonn in 1832, majoring in law, cameralism, and finance. He transferred to the University of Halle, where he studied natural science. In 1836, he passed his bar examination at Naumburg.King (1967) pp.15,16,18 Meusebach was appointed administrator of Trier in 1836. He became an assistant judge in 1838 at Berlin and Potsdam. The Meusebach home was a gathering place for intellectual and political discussions of personal freedom and less government versus a nationalist state. Otfried was interested that some German intellectuals had emigrated to the United States, but also voiced opinions that the United States was in contradiction of itself by proclaiming liberty while allowing the institution of slavery.King (1967) pp.21‚Äì28 In 1841, Meusebach held a legal position in Stettin. Because of his expertise at handling a dispute between Stettin and Anklam, he was soon appointed as B√ºrgermeister of Anklam.King (1967) pp.29,30 Adelsverein=Texas land grant= The Adelsverein was formed in Biebrich, Germany on April 20, 1842, by a group of noblemen to promote German colonization in Texas. Co-founder Count Victor August of Leiningen-Westerburg-Alt-Leiningen was president of the society, and Count Carl of Castell-Castell became vice-president and business director.King (1967) pp.33,34 The Republic of Texas issued colonization land grants totaling 4,494,806 acres. These grants were with individuals and conditional upon said individuals establishing settlements in a stated geographical area of Texas, and were limited to a given time period in which the colonization had to take place. On June 7, 1842, Henry Francis Fisher and Burchard Miller received a colonization land grant to settle 1,000 immigrant families of German, Dutch, Swiss, Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian ancestry, known as the Fisher‚ÄìMiller Land Grant. The contract was renewed on September 1, 1843 by the Republic of Texas House of Representatives. On June 26, 1844, Fisher sold an interest in the grant to the Adelsverein. On December 30, 1845, both Fisher and Miller sold their grant rights to the Adelsverein, conditional that Fisher be on the Verein's colonial committee. On April 7, 1844, a second land grant acquired by the Verein was the Bourgeois-Ducos grant, which had actually expired December 3, 1843. The Verein appointed the grant's namesake Alexander Bourgeois d'Orvanne as Colonial Director, who sold them on the promise he could get the grant's deadline extended. In the end, the Bourgeois- Ducos grant was not extended.King (1967) pp.35,36 =Commissioner-General= On October 24, 1844, Meusebach wrote a letter to Count Castell to express his interest in moving to the Republic of Texas in order to pursue his love of geology, botany and horticulture.King (1967) pp.32,33 He had become fascinated by Texas and had been reading everything about the area. At the suggestion of his brother Carl, he read Texas: The Rise, Progress, and Prospects of the Republic of Texas by author William Kennedy and became intrigued by a place named Enchanted Rock. (reprint 2010) The same book had inspired Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels who had been named Commissioner-General of the Verein's colonization. Once in Texas, Prince Solms had become disillusioned because of the financial and logistics difficulties of establishing German colonies in Texas. Fisher had badly mis-managed funds and assets entrusted to him, with Prince Solms lending more money to the expedition. In 1844, Prince Solms asked the Vereins to remove him as Commissioner-General and appoint a successor.King (1967) pp.35‚Äì38 Count Castell replied to Meusebach's October 24 letter by stating that he could buy a share in the Verein for $2,000 and have a chance at becoming Commissioner-General in Texas. The two negotiated a contract for Commissioner-General: Meusebach would receive a $2,000 allowance for equipment and books, an annual salary of $790 plus 2% of the net profits of the Verein, and 500 acres of land in Texas.King (1967) pp.40,41 Before departing, he paid a courtesy call on Prince Frederick of Prussia to secure his support of the effort.King (1967) p.42 Meusebach signed the contract on February 24, 1845 and paid his $2,000 membership fee.King (1967) p.43 Count Castell was vague and evasive in response to Meusebach's questions about the particulars of the colonization endeavor, but gave Meusebach a $10,000 letter of credit.King (1967) p.44 Meusebach added Texas Forever to Tenax Propositi (Perseverance in Purpose) on his family crest. The 32-year-old Meusebach traveled to Liverpool, England to board the steamship Cambria to Boston. As the ship departed, he renounced his title of Baron, as a symbol of his new life in a new land.King (1967) p.45 Upon arrival in Boston on March 14, 1845, he headed to Pittsburgh and boarded a boat for a trip down the Ohio River and then Mississippi River. He arrived in New Orleans on April 10, 1845. From New Orleans, he arrived by boat in Galveston, Texas on May 1, 1845.King (1967) pp.50‚Äì52 Verein agent D.H. Klaener greeted Meusebach's arrival at Galveston and immediately apprised him of the desperate straits of the colonists. The finances were in disarray, due to Prince Solms' lack of business experience and his refusal to keep financial records. To a larger degree, the financial situation happened because the Adelsverein was an organization of noblemen with no practical backgrounds at running a business. They were on the other side of the world and did not witness the situation both Prince Solms and Meusebach were dealing with. Henry Fisher had not supplied transport and supplies for which the Verein advanced money to him.King (1967) pp.52‚Äì53 Fisher had also conspired in February 1845 with Dr. F. Schubbert to coerce incoming immigrants to sign legal documents disassociating themselves from the Verein and to join Schubbert's colony in Milam County.Solms (2000) p.131 Meusebach found Carlshafen (Indianola) to be insufficient as a port of entry, and the route to New Braunfels isolated. He was told Prince Solms chose to keep the Germans from interacting with any Americans. Meusebach found Prince Solms in Galveston trying to return to Germany, detained by authorities for unpaid bills. Meusebach made a full accounting of the situation to the Verein, adding that he felt the less the Verein had to do with Henry Fisher and Burchard Miller the better off everyone would be.King (1967) pp.52‚Äì58 In May 1846, Meusebach received a letter from Count Castell informing him 4,304 emigrants were on their way to Texas, with the Verein unresponsive to pleas for more funding. Embarrassed by a German media story from Klaener, the Verein established a $60,000 letter of credit.King (1967) pp.75‚Äì83 The amount was not adequate for sustaining the total amount of German emigrants in Texas, but Castell also sent Philip Cappes as Special Commissioner to observe the situation. Cappes had also been instructed by Castell to observe Meusebach and to secretly report back every detail.Morgenthaler (2007) p.56 By the time Cappes departed in March 1847, he recommended another $200,000 be advanced.King (1967) pp.96‚Äì101 =Carlshafen (Indianola)= Carlshafen (Indianola) was the port of entry chosen by Prince Solms. =New Braunfels= New Braunfels was founded by Prince Carl of Solms- Braunfels on March 21, 1845. On May 15, 1845, Prince Solms left for Germany and turned the leadership of the settlement over to Meusebach. =Fredericksburg= Meusebach planned the 1846 establishment of Fredericksburg, Texas for the Adelsverein. =Penateka Comanche peace treaty= In order to settle the Fisher-Miller land grant, Meusebach successfully negotiated a non-government peace treaty with the Penateka Comanche in 1847. =Darmstadt Society of Forty= Meusebach and Hermann Spiess of the Darmstadt Society of Forty chose the location for Bettina in 1847 on the banks of the Llano River. The commune was named in honor of Bettina von Arnim, a personal friend of the Meusebach family.King (1967) p.121 =Nassau Plantation= In 1843, the Vereins purchased a 4,428 acre plantation in Fayette County and named it after the Archduke of Nassau. Twenty-five slaves were bought to work on the property. When Prince Solms inspected the plantation in 1844, he recommended the Verein divest itself of the property, rather than be associated with slavery. The Vereins operated the property for five years. =Resignation from Adelsverein= Meusebach had considered leaving Texas as early as November 1845, when he wrote to Count Castell and announced his intention to resign and return to Germany. Meusebach did not feel the Adelsverein was organized enough to achieve its goals. He had survived a hanging mob at his doorstep in New Braunfels on December 31, 1846. The incident had been stirred up by Henry Francis Fisher in an attempt to usurp Meusebach's power.King (1967) pp.103,104 Meusebach was the target of intrigue instigated by Count Castell, who sent his friend Philip Cappes to Texas ostensibly as Special Commissioner to provide additional funding, but in reality to secretly observe Meusebach to find cause to oust him.King (1967) pp.98‚Äì101 In January 1847 in Fredericksburg, Meusebach was again the target of a coup d'√©tat, this time instigated by Dr. Friedrich Schubbert.King (1967) pp.106,107 He again submitted his resignation to accompany a financial report to Castell on January 23, 1847.King (1967) pp.110,125 The effective date of his resignation was July 20, 1847.King (1967) p.129 Hermann Spiess was named his successor. Texas State Senator In 1851, Meusebach made a return trip to Germany to spend time with his remaining family. His father had died in 1847. During the trip, he also took the opportunity to completely sever any remaining ties to the Adelsverein. While in Germany, Meusebach had been elected to represent Bexar, Medina and Comal counties in the Texas State Senate.King (1967) p.140,141 Meusebach took office on November 7, 1851. His first act as Texas senator was to request that the inaugural address of Governor Peter Hansborough Bell be printed in English, Spanish and German.King (1967) p.145 He served on the Committee on State Affairs and the Committee on Education.King (1967) p.146 Special state commissioner In 1854, Meusebach was appointed by Governor Elisha Pease as a special commissioner to settle colonist titles to land promised by the Verein between 1845 and 1846.Solms (2000) p.148 The Republic of Texas had originally promised the colonists 640 acres apiece for a married couple, or 320 acres for unmarried colonists. When the original colonists settled on their promised acreage, the Verein had kept one half of the allotment. Meusebach's position was to rectify the land holdings. He issued 729 colonist land scripts in the amount of 324,160 acres. Three other Texas General Land Office commissioners also issued scripts, for the aggregate total of 1,735,200 acres in colonist land holdings.King (1967) p.154Morgenthaler (2007) p.100 Comanche Spring, Fredericksburg and New Braunfels residences After resigning as Commissioner-General of the Adelsverein, Meusebach moved from New Braunfels to some 2,577 acres he had bought for $2600King (1967) p.126 at Comanche Spring in Bexar County, believed to have been in the vicinity of current-day Camp Bullis.Morgenthaler (2007) p.99 In New Braunfels, botanist Ferdinand Lindheimer began a friendship with fellow botanical enthusiast Meusebach, who appointed him director of a New Braunfels botanical garden.King (1967) p.93 Lindheimer and Meusebach made botanical collections at Comanche Spring, with Lindheimer's 1849 collections bearing the Comanche Spring place tag.King (1967) p.141 During the American Civil War, Meusebach sold his Comanche Spring property and moved to Fredericksburg, where he operated a mercantile business to support his family.King (1967) p.157 In 1867, he sold his Fredericksburg holdings and moved his family to Waco Springs, four miles north of New Braunfels.King (1967) p.161 On September 12, 1869 a tornado destroyed the Meusebach home in New Braunfels. Meusebach, whose foot had been pinned beneath a heavy beam, was the only member of his family to be injured. The foot injury remained with him the rest of his life. Loyal ValleyPersonal life and death Meusebach became engaged to Elizabeth von Hardenberg in 1842. Before they could be married, she died in Germany of Typhoid fever while he was administering the establishments of New Braunfels and Fredericksburg.King (1967) pp.28,139 On September 28, 1852, forty-year-old Meusebach married seventeen-year-old Austrian-born Countess Agnes of Coreth, daughter of his friend Count Ernst of Coreth. The couple had eleven children, but only seven lived to adulthood.King (1967) p.151 Meusebach died on May 27, 1897, on his property in Loyal Valley, and is buried in the family cemetery in Cherry Spring. John and Agnes' daughter Elizabeth married Leo Burchheardt Zesch and had two daughters named Leonie (1882‚Äì1944) and Leota (1886‚Äì1979) . The family moved to California after Leota's birth, and was living in San Francisco at the time of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Leonie von Meusebach‚ÄìZesch became a dentist, living in both Texas and Arizona and providing dental services to military personnel. In Arizona she provided dental services to Hopi people. She relocated to Alaska and became a traveling dentist who served remote areas around the state. When her mother Elizabeth was no longer able to care for herself, Dr. Zesch returned to California and spent the rest of her life and career there. The Alaska Women's Hall of Fame inducted Dr. Leonie von Meusebach-Zesch in 2012. Barons Creek in Fredericksburg, Texas is named after Baron Meusebach.

The word is apparently a variant of the Latin maxima, but this latter word is not found in extant texts of Roman law with any denotation exactly analogous to that of a legal maxim in the Medieval or modern definition, but the treatises of many of the Roman jurists on and are to some degree collections of maxims. Most of the Latin maxims originate from the Medieval era in European states that used Latin as their legal language. The attitude of early English commentators towards the maximal of the law was one of unmingled adulation. In Thomas Hobbes, Doctor and Student (p. 26), they are described as of the same strength and effect in the law as statutes. Not only, observes Francis Bacon in the Preface to his Collection of Maxims, will the use of maxims be in deciding doubt and helping soundness of judgment, but, further, in gracing argument, in correcting unprofitable subtlety, and reducing the same to a more sound and substantial sense of law, in reclaiming vulgar errors, and, generally, in the amendment in some measure of the very nature and complexion of the whole law.Combined with a tract entitled The Use of the Common Law, for preservation of our Persons, goods, and good Names, in a book entitled The Elements of the Common Lawes of England, facsimile reprint by Da Capo Press, 1969, may be viewed at Constitution Society A similar note was sounded in Scotland; and it has been well observed that a glance at the pages of Morrisons Dictionary or at other early reports will show how frequently in the older Scots law questions respecting the rights, remedies and liabilities of individuals were determined by an immediate reference to legal maxims. In later times, less value has been attached to the maxims of the law, as the development of civilization and the increasing complexity of business relations have shown the necessity of qualifying the propositions which they enunciate. But both historically and practically, they must always possess interest and value.

Complicating the situation is the apparent psychiatric breakdown of the mission commander and his definite attempts to injure or kill his fellow crewmembers. On Earth, the Mars Mission Director, working with an agent of the FBI, races to discover who sabotaged the mission before the crew even arrived on Mars‚Äîand who might be trying to strand the crew on Mars now that they're on it. He is shocked to discover that his own Flight Director committed the initial sabotage‚Äîhe was trying to seed Mars with a bacterium that would be taken as evidence of life on Mars, thus ensuring continued funding of Project Ares, the official name for the program. But when the life- sciences specialist falls ill from an actual microbial infection‚Äîfrom live bacteria which she has subsequently discovered‚Äîthe mishaps multiply, with a corresponding increase in the physical danger to the crew. Someone other than the Flight Director is responsible for this. At the very end, that someone is revealed to be a NASA engineer who fears that the crew, now on their way back to Earth, are bringing back a germ that could potentially kill millions of people‚Äîthis although the crew clearly showed that the germ was sensitive to the antibiotics they had carried with them. The mission ends with the psychiatrically challenged commander sacrificing his own life to save the rest of the crew‚Äîand the marriage of the two mission specialists aboard their Earth Return Vehicle.

Allusions/references to other works The Fifth Man is a sequel to Oxygen, an earlier novel in which the same crew suffers damage due to explosion that almost causes them to die of suffocation. Allusions/references to actual history and current science This novel, and its prequel, uses concepts adapted from the Mars Semi-Direct mission profile proposed, and under active research, by the Mars Society. As such, these novels are two of the most realistic novels yet written that describe what the first crewed mission to Mars, and the program of which it is a part, might look like and how it might actually work. Literary significance & criticism The Fifth Man continues the trend in Christian fiction away from the preachy, tract-like novels of the 1990s and toward novels with \\"crossover appeal\\"‚Äîthat is, novels that a non-Christian might appreciate nearly as well as does a Christian. Christian science fiction is very rare, primarily because of the inherent restrictions that apply to a Christian novel‚Äîin this case, that such a novel may not create a character or a situation for which the Bible holds no warrant. Thus, while the title of this work strongly suggests an extraterrestrial visitor as an agent that assaults the astronauts (and ultimately murders one of them), some Christians find it impossible to accept such a concept. Thus the agent of the mayhem that plagues and pursues the astronauts must be a human agent. The realization of this fact has led some readers to criticize The Fifth Man severely, accusing the authors of the literary equivalent of bait-and-switch. Yet a close read of this novel and its prequel Oxygen clearly shows that the same character responsible for killing Astronaut Hampton and almost killing the rest of the crew, was also responsible for the failed \\"lifeboat\\" mission in the earlier novel. More to the point, however, a Fifth Man does exist on Mars. The surviving astronauts see him very briefly before they make their hurried take-off. They do not recognize him, but anyone who has read the third chapter of the Biblical book of Daniel probably will. Thus the Fifth Man is extraterrestrial, after all‚Äîbut not in the usual sense in modern popular culture. =Awards and nominations= The Fifth Man was a finalist for the Christy Award for the best futuristic Christian novel published in 2002. It lost to Time Lottery. Another finalist in that same year was the novel Ice.

He is the principal investigator of the New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Chief Scientist at Moon Express. Stern has been involved in 24 suborbital, orbital, and planetary space missions, including eight for which he was the mission principal investigator. One of his projects was the Southwest Ultraviolet Imaging System, an instrument which flew on two space shuttle missions, STS-85 in 1997 and STS-93 in 1999. Stern has also developed eight scientific instruments for planetary and near-space research missions and has been a guest observer on numerous NASA satellite observatories, including the International Ultraviolet Explorer, the Hubble Space Telescope, the International Infrared Observer and the Extreme Ultraviolet Observer. Stern was Executive Director of the Southwest Research Institute's Space Science and Engineering Division until becoming Associate Administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in 2007. He resigned from that position after nearly a year. In early 2009 Stern's name was mentioned as a potential contender for the position of NASA administrator under President Obama's administration.Who Will Be the Next NASA Administrator? Stern has stated, however, that he is not interested in the position at this time given his desire to spend time with his family. Life and career Stern was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of Joel and Leonard Stern. He graduated from St. Mark's School of Texas in 1975. He then attended the University of Texas, Austin, where he received his bachelor's degrees in physics & astronomy and his master's degrees in aerospace engineering and planetary atmospheres. He earned a doctorate in astrophysics and planetary science from the University of Colorado, Boulder.Stern has earned the following college degrees: \\\\- BS PHY 1978, The University of Texas at Austin \\\\- BA AST 1981, The University of Texas at Austin \\\\- MS ASE 1980, The University of Texas at Austin \\\\- MS CE 1981, The University of Texas at Austin \\\\- PhD Astrophysics/Planetary Science 1989, University of Colorado Boulder (Alan Stern, Distinguished Alumni, Class of 2019) Quote: \\"Before receiving his doctorate from the University of Colorado in 1989, Stern completed twin master's degrees in aerospace engineering and atmospheric sciences at The University of Texas at Austin (1980 and 1981). His two undergraduate degrees are in physics and astronomy, also from UT Austin (1978 and 1981).\\" From 1983 to 1991, Stern held positions at the University of Colorado in the Center for Space and Geoscience Policy, the office of the Vice President for Research, and the Center for Astrophysics and Space Astronomy. He received his doctorate in 1989. From 1991 to 1994 he was the leader of Southwest Research Institute's Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences group and was Chair of NASA's Outer Planets Science Working Group. From 1994 to 1998 he was the leader of the Geophysical, Astrophysical, and Planetary Science section in Southwest Research Institute's Space Sciences Department, and from 1998 to 2005 he was the Director of the Department of Space Studies at Southwest Research Institute. In 1995 he was selected to be a Space Shuttle mission specialist finalist and in 1996 he was a candidate Space Shuttle payload specialist but did not have the opportunity to fly on the Space Shuttle. His research has focused on studies of our solar system's Kuiper belt and Oort cloud, comets, the satellites of the outer planets, Pluto, and the search for evidence of planetary systems around other stars. He has also worked on spacecraft rendezvous theory, terrestrial polar mesospheric clouds, galactic astrophysics, and studies of tenuous satellite atmospheres, including the atmosphere of the Moon. In 2007, Stern was listed among Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in The World. On August 27, 2008 Stern was elected to the Board of Directors of the Challenger Center for Space Science Education. In 2015, Stern was the recipient of Smithsonian Magazine's American Ingenuity Award in the Physical Sciences category. On October 7, 2016, Stern was inducted into the Colorado Space Hall of Fame.Brevard Business News. \\"Foundation names honoree for Colorado Space Hall of Fame, event set for Oct. 7\\", vol. 34, no. 34, (Melbourne, Florida: 22 August 2016), p. 7. Inspiration for Pluto/Kuiper belt mission Alan Stern and the New Horizons team celebrate after the spacecraft successfully completed its flyby of Pluto. On June 14, 2007, in an address to the Smithsonian Institution for their \\"Exploring the Solar System Lecture Series\\", Stern commented on the New Horizons mission: Private sector experience After completing a master's degree in aerospace engineering Stern spent seven years as an aerospace systems engineer, concentrating on spacecraft and payload systems at the NASA Johnson Space Center, Martin Marietta Aerospace, and the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado. Stern is currently active as a consultant for private sector space efforts and has stated: On June 18, 2008, Stern joined Odyssey Moon Limited (Isle of Man), a private industry effort, as a part-time Science Mission Director/consultant in their efforts to launch a robotic mission to the Earth's Moon by participating in the $30 Million Google Lunar X-Prize competition. In December 2008, Stern joined Blue Origin, a company that was founded by Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos as an independent representative for research and education Missions. The company has stated that its objective is to develop a new vertical-take-off, vertical-landing vehicle known as New Shepard that is designed to take a small number of astronauts on a sub-orbital journey into space and reduce the cost of space transportation. The company is located in Kent, Washington and has flight tested some hardware. In 2012, Stern co-founded Uwingu. Space science mission Stern has extensive experience in instrument development, with a strong concentration in ultraviolet technologies. Stern is a principal investigator (PI) in NASA's UV sounding rocket program, and was the project scientist on a Shuttle-deployable SPARTAN astronomical satellite. He was the PI of the advanced, miniaturized HIPPS Pluto breadboard camera/IR spectrometer/UV spectrometer payload for the NASA/Pluto-Kuiper Express mission, and he is the PI of the PERSI imager/spectrometer payload on NASA's New Horizons Pluto mission. Stern is also the PI of the ALI CE UV Spectrometer for the ESA/NASA Rosetta comet orbiter. He was a member of the New Millennium Deep Space 1 (DS1) mission science team, and is a Co-investigator on both the ESA SPICAM Mars UV spectrometer launched on Mars Express, and the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) installed in 2009.COS Website He is the PI of the SWUIS ultraviolet imager, which has flown two Shuttle missions, and the SWUIS-A airborne astronomical facility. In this capacity, Stern has flown numerous WB-57 and F-18 airborne research astronomy missions. Stern and his colleague, Dr. Daniel Durda, have been flying on the modified F/A-18 Hornet with a sophisticated camera system called the Southwest Ultraviolet Imaging System (SWUIS). They use the camera to search for a hypothetical group of asteroids (Vulcanoids) between the orbit of Mercury and the Sun that are so elusive and hard to see that scientists are not sure they exist. Although he is a qualified pilot, Stern and his colleague are not flying these missions but rather operating the instruments at up to 60,000 feet in the F/A-18's. With regards to mission preparation Stern has stated: NASA experience Stern has served on various NASA committees, including the Lunar Exploration Science Working Group (LExSWG) and the Discovery Program Science Working Group (DPSWG), the Solar System Exploration Subcommittee (SSES), the New Millennium Science Working Group (NMSWG), and the Sounding Rocket Working Group (SRWG). He was Chair of NASA's Outer Planets Science Working Group (OPSWG) from 1991 to 1994 and served as a panel member for the National Research Council's 2003-2013 Decadal Survey on planetary science. Stern is a member of the AAAS, the AAS, and the AGU. NASA Associate Administrator Stern was appointed NASA's Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, essentially NASA's top-ranking official for science, in April 2007. In this position Stern directed a organization with 93 separate flight missions and a program of over 3,000 research grants. During his tenure a record 10 major new flight projects were started and deep reforms of the research and also the education and public outreach programs were put in place.http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/stern_nac_08.pdf Stern's style was characterised as \\"hard-charging\\" as he pursued a reform-minded agenda. He \\"made headlines for trying to keep agency missions on schedule and under budget\\" but faced \\"internal battles over funding\\". He was credited with making \\"significant changes that have helped restore the importance of science in NASA's mission\\".http://planetarynews.org/archive08/pen_v02_n09_080205.txthttp://planetarynews.org/archive08/pen_v02_n01_080104.txt On March 26, 2008 it was announced that Stern had resigned his position the previous day, effective April 11.http://planetarynews.org/archive08/pen_v02_n19_080403.txt He was replaced by Ed Weiler, who was to serve his second stint in the position. The resignation occurred on the same day that NASA Chief Michael D. Griffin overruled a decrease in funding for the Mars Exploration Rovers and Mars Odyssey missions that was intended to free up funds needed for the upcoming Mars Science Laboratory. NASA officials would neither confirm nor deny a connection between the two events. Stern left to avoid cutting healthy programs and basic research in order to cover cost overruns. He believed that cost overruns in the Mars program should be accommodated from within the Mars program, and not taken from other NASA programs. Michael D. Griffin became upset with Stern for making major decisions without consulting him, while Stern was frustrated by Griffin's refusal to allow him to cut or delay politically sensitive projects. Griffin favored cutting \\"less popular parts\\" of the budget, including basic research, and Stern's refusal to do so led to his resignation. Casting doubt on the theory that Stern resigned due to conflict with former Administrator Griffin is his statement of March 25, 2009 at spacepolitics.com: On November 23, 2008, in an op-ed in The New York Times, Stern criticized NASA's inability to keep its spending under control. Stern said that, during his own time at NASA, \\"when I articulated this problem... and consistently curtailed cost increases, I found myself eventually admonished and then neutered by still higher ups, precipitating my resignation earlier this year.\\" While complimenting current NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin, Stern suggested that Griffin's decision to again bail out an over- budget mission was motivated by fear \\"that any move to cancel the Mars mission would be rebuffed by members of Congress protecting local jobs\\". Since leaving NASA, Stern has made constructive criticisms of the budgetary process and has advocated for revamping its public appeal. Planetary classification Stern has become particularly involved in the debate surrounding the 2006 definition of planet by the IAU. After the IAU's decision was made he was quoted as saying \\"It's an awful definition; it's sloppy science and it would never pass peer review\\" and claimed that Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Neptune have not fully cleared their orbital zones and has stated in his capacity as PI of the New Horizons project that \\"The New Horizons project [...] will not recognize the IAU's planet definition resolution of August 24, 2006.\\" A 2000 paper by Stern and Levison proposed a system of planet classification that included both the concepts of hydrostatic equilibrium and clearing the neighbourhood used in the new definition, with a proposed classification scheme labeling all sub-stellar objects in hydrostatic equilibrium as \\"planets\\" and subclassifying them into \\"√ºberplanets\\" and \\"unterplanets\\" based on a mathematical analysis of the planet's ability to scatter other objects out of its orbit over a long period of time. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune were classified as neighborhood-clearing \\"√ºberplanets\\" and Pluto was classified as an \\"unterplanet\\". One could take this classification system as planet and dwarf planet respectively, with the major difference of the IAU definition classifying the two as distinct categories of celestial bodies instead of two subsets of planets. =Satellite planets and belt planets= Some large satellites are of similar size or larger than the planet Mercury, e.g. Jupiter's Galilean moons and Titan. Stern has argued that location should not matter and only geophysical attributes should be taken into account in the definition of a planet, and proposes the term satellite planet for a planet- sized object orbiting another planet. Likewise planet-sized objects in the asteroid belt or Kuiper belt should also be planets according to Stern.Should Large Moons Be Called 'Satellite Planets'? Others have used the neologism planemo (planetary-mass object) for the broad concept of \\"planet\\" advocated by Stern.G. Basri & E.M. Brown, 2006.

A youth player at Manchester City, where he went on to appear over 50 times, he spent time on loan at Bristol Rovers, Bolton Wanderers and Luton Town before moving to Southend United on a permanent basis in 1998 where he remained for one season, joining Huddersfield Town in 1999. After signing for Cardiff City in 2002, he went on to win his first and only cap for Wales in a friendly with Canada in May 2004. He retired from playing at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season, becoming a full-time goalkeeper coach at Cardiff City. Career=Manchester City= Margetson began his career with Manchester City, signing as a YTS trainee at the age of 18 where he featured largely as understudy during a downturn in the club's fortunes. His full debut came in May 1990, deputising for the suspended Tony Coton in a Manchester derby at Old Trafford, and he retained his place for the following match against Sunderland. In the next two seasons he made four appearances, but did not make a single first team appearance in the two seasons after. His next first team appearance was an unusual one. In a League Cup match against Wycombe, Manchester City had used both outfield substitutes when Richard Edghill sustained an injury and could not continue. Margetson, the only remaining substitute, was introduced as a striker for the final few minutes of the match. p. 35 Despite performing well in the run-in to the club's relegation battle to the 3rd-tier of English football in 1998, he was guilty of picking up a back pass to concede a free-kick inside the penalty area against Queens Park Rangers. He proceeded to hand the ball to the opposing forward Mike Sheron who then quickly took the free kick, passing to a team-mate who stroked the ball into an unguarded net. This goal later proved to be costly as City were relegated in QPR's stead at the end of the season. =Southend United= Margetson moved on at the end of season on a free transfer for a spell with Southend United, making his debut on 8 August 1998 in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Scarborough. However, he remained at Roots Hall for just one season after losing his place in the side to Mel Capleton. =Huddersfield Town= He came close to signing for Division Two side Blackpool, before eventually joining Huddersfield Town in August 1999. Finding himself as back- up to Nico Vaesen, Margetson was forced to wait until April 2001 to make his debut for Huddersfield during a 2‚Äì0 defeat to Blackburn Rovers after Vaesen was shown a red card for handball. Following the sale of Vaesen to Birmingham City in the summer of 2001, Margetson took over as first choice goalkeeper for the 2001‚Äì02 season and played in every game as they reached the play-offs after finishing sixth, suffering defeat to Brentford, but was released at the end of the season. =Cardiff City= He joined Cardiff City on trial during a pre-season tour in Scotland, before eventually signing a permanent deal at Ninian Park. He made his debut for Cardiff on 11 September 2002 in a 5‚Äì1 victory over Boston United in the Football League Cup. Margetson spent the majority of his first season as back-up to Neil Alexander, but made a bigger impact during the 2003‚Äì04 season, making 25 appearances in all competitions and was rewarded with a new two-year contract, rejecting an approach from the club's South Wales rivals Swansea City. However, after beginning the 2004‚Äì05 season as first choice goalkeeper, he lost his place after spending missing most of the season with injury due to undergoing knee surgery and the removal of two discs from his back. During the 2005‚Äì06 season, he made just two appearances in League Cup ties against Macclesfield Town and Leicester City. Out of contract at the end of the season, Margetson was initially not offered a new deal but, following the departure of the club's goalkeeping coach George Wood, he signed a new one-year deal to take over as a player-coach, rejecting a second offer from Swansea City. He remained as back-up to Neil Alexander throughout the season and announced his retirement at the end of year, becoming the club's full-time goalkeeper coach. International career Having won seven caps at under-21 level, his last appearance coming in 1993, earlier in his career, he was called up to the Wales senior side by manager Mark Hughes for the first time in his career in March 2004 for a friendly match with Hungary, but remained on the bench. Two months later, Margetson received his second call-up for friendly matches with Norway and Canada. An unused substitute against Norway, Margetson was handed his international debut on 30 May 2004 when he replaced Danny Coyne at half-time during a 1‚Äì0 win over Canada. He later received two further call-ups in 2005 under new manager John Toshack for matches against Slovenia and Azerbaijan but was an unused substitute in both games. Coaching During his last season of playing football, Margetson became Cardiff's player-goalkeeping coach, before retiring at the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season and becoming the full-time goalkeeping coach. After Gary Speed's appointment as Wales manager, Margetson was appointed their goalkeeping coach on 15 January 2011, becoming Speed's first back room appointment. On 4 July 2011, Margetson quit his coaching job at Cardiff in order to join up with Sam Allardyce at West Ham United as their new goalkeeping coach. In October 2014, following the appointment of new Cardiff manager, Russell Slade, Margetson returned as goalkeeping coach to Cardiff City. In August 2016, Margetson stepped down from his role with Wales to join the England national football team coaching staff, following the appointment of Sam Allardyce. On 12 January 2017 it was announced that Margetson had joined Crystal Palace as goalkeeping coach. He joined Everton in December 2017, and left on 16 May 2018 after the departure of Sam Allardyce. Margetson joined Swansea City in June 2019 as the club's new goalkeeping coach, which he performs alongside his role with the England national team. Outside football Margetson owns a property business with former Cardiff teammate John Robinson.

Biography His style has been described as in between rock and country. Clayton grew up in Oak Ridge, Tennessee and began to play harmonica and guitar at the age of seven. At nine years old, he received his first steel guitar.Christian Graf, Uwe Wohlschl√§ger: Rock Musik Lexikon (German) - Taurus Press After quitting the Air Force he moved to Nashville in 1968 and began his career as a songwriter. In 1972 he wrote \\"Ladies Love Outlaws\\" for Waylon Jennings. In 1973 he released his first album simply titled Lee Clayton, with which, as Clayton would later say, he was very dissatisfied. In the following years he continued his songwriting. He wrote songs like \\"Lone Wolf\\" for Jerry Jeff Walker and \\"If You Could Touch Her at All\\" for Willie Nelson. In 1978 his second album, Border Affair, was released. It was critically acclaimed but became a flop at the charts. His most successful album was 1979's Naked Child. The songs' style was reminiscent of Bob Dylan and the single, \\"I Ride Alone\\", became very notable. In 1979, he went on a big world tour, which became a huge success. In 1981 he released his fourth studio album, The Dream Goes On, which had a harder sound than his previous work. After that he published two autobiographical books and, in 1990, he released a live album entitled Another Night, which was recorded in September 9, 1988, at the Cruise Cafe, Oslo, Norway. Also in 1990, The Highwaymen, an outlaw country supergroup comprising Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson, had a minor hit with a song of his, \\"Silver Stallion\\", which had previously appeared on Border Affair (1978). In 1994 he released the album Spirit of the Twilight. Cat Power also covered \\"Silver Stallion\\" on the popular 2008 cover album Jukebox. In 2008 a new acoustic song \\"We The People\\" was \\"released\\" on YouTube. Today Clayton's career has largely gone silent.

Career Blackehart began his artistic education at the University of South Florida under BAFTA-winning character actor Paul Massie, before moving overseas to attend the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. While at LAMDA, in addition to the normal study-and-performance curriculum, Blackehart studied swordsmanship under renowned fight masters Rodney Cottier and John Waller, and went on to attain an advanced certification from the Society of British Fight Directors (now called the BASSC). Upon returning to the US, he became an active member of Manhattan's Westside Repertory Theatre (at the time the oldest classical theater company in the city), and by day studied at HB Studio under Uta Hagen and with character actor William Hickey. Blackehart first became known for playing Benny Que in the cult classic film Tromeo and Juliet, though he has since acted in a mixture of B-movies (Retro Puppet Master,The Land That Time Forgot) and mainstream films, many of which are associated with James Gunn (The Belko Experiment, Super, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad), whom he met while working on Tromeo. In addition to his film work, Blackehart has acted in TV series including Grey's Anatomy, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and The Orville. He was a regular on the BBC's The Tromaville Cafe, where he originated the role of Felix, the French Trickster. In 2004, Blackehart produced Jenna Fischer's mockumentary film LolliLove. It was subsequently picked up for distribution by Troma and garnered DVD Talk's distinction as a \\"Collector's Series\\" disc immediately upon its video release. It was also voted #2 by the editors of Amazon in their list of Best DVDs of the Year - Comedy, and completely sold out of all copies within the first day of release. In 2008 and 2009, he produced the comedy web series PG Porn and Humanzee! for filmmaker James Gunn. In November 2014, he published a collection of novellas entitled A Stranger to the Darklands and Other Tales. Personal life Blackehart is from Hell's Kitchen, New York. It has been reported that Blackehart was born as Stefano Brando and is the son of late actor Marlon Brando, though Blackehart denies that he is related.

The bank traces its origins to the British Bank of the Middle East which was acquired by HSBC in 1959. In response to restrictions on foreign ownership of banks in Saudi Arabia, SABB was created in 1978 to manage HSBC branches and assets in the country. SABB is one the five largest Saudi banks by deposits and has over eighty branches across Saudi Arabia and one branch in London, England. In May 2018, prompted by recent changes to Vision 2030 economic reforms, SABB announced its intention to acquire Alawwal Bank in the Saudi banking sector's first merger in twenty years. History The British Bank of Iran and the Middle East, which became British Bank of the Middle East (BBME), opened branches in Jeddah and Al Khobar in 1950. The Jeddah branch in particular depended for its profits on the Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Makkah (Mecca). Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) acquired BBME in 1959. In 1976 the central bank enacted its sweeping policy of banking sector Saudization to address foreign banks' domination of the sector and its impact on the Saudi economy. Consequently, it directed all foreign bank branches to incorporate in Saudi Arabia (i.e., become Saudi companies with Saudi capital) and limited their parent companies to ownership of forty percent of these new entities. As a result, HSBC incorporated in Saudi Arabia in 1978 and opened up to local ownership, renaming itself the Saudi British Bank. Ownership became 60% Saudi and 40% HSBC, and HSBC has a technical services agreement with the bank. HSBC Holdings of Britain held 49% stake in the joint venture with SABB holding 51% until October 2019 when HSBC Group acquired shares from SABB to become the major shareholder with 51% stake.HSBC Group becomes major shareholder of its Saudi subsidiary , zawya.com Services SABB offers services in investment banking, commercial banking, private banking and Islamic banking. SABB Islamic Financial Solutions (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÑŸàŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿßŸÑŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖŸäÿ©), which are part of SABB services, are regulated by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency and a Sharia Supervisory Committee. This ensures that SABB Islamic Financial Solutions conforms to strict adherence to principles of Sharia. 2018 Merger with Alawwal Bank On May 16, 2018, SABB and Alawwal Bank (formerly Saudi Hollandi Bank) entered into a non-binding agreement on a deal for SABB to acquire Alawwal. The agreement concluded nearly one year of negotiations, and SABB will be represented by U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs in the transaction. Alawwal Bank will cease to exist as a legal entity and will be absorbed into SABB, creating Saudi Arabia's third largest bank with a market cap of $17.2 billion. SABB shareholders will own 73 percent of the new bank, which is expected to be chaired by Saudi businesswoman Lubna Al Olayan. Final agreement on a merger deal was announced one week after the Saudi government launched the Financial Sector Development Program, an executive program aimed at overhauling the Saudi financial sector to create an effective capital market capable of supporting the goals of the Vision 2030 economic reform plans. The merger of the two banks was completed on 16 June 2019. Now the integration of the two banks will be completed in about 18 months. Credit rating In August 2011, Fitch Ratings gave SABB's long-term issuer default rating (IDR) at ‚ÄúA‚Äù with a stable outlook as well as The Viability Rating (VR) has also been affirmed at ‚ÄúA‚Äù. In October 2018, in anticipation of its pending merger with Alawwal Bank, Moody‚Äôs reaffirmed local and foreign currency deposit ratings of SABB at A1/P-1 and Alawwal Bank at A3/P-2, respectively.

He was known for his \\"musical sophistication that was uniquely 'Harline-esque' by weaving rich tapestries of mood-setting underscores and penning memorable melodies for animated shorts and features.\\" Biography Leigh Harline was born March 26, 1907, in Salt Lake City, Utah, the youngest of 13 children, to soldier Carl H√§rlin and his wife Johanna Matilda. His parents came from the village of H√§rfsta in Simtuna parish, Sweden. They joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1888 and moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1891. In the U.S., they changed their surname to Harline.:sv:Leigh Harline Leigh was baptized a member of the LDS Church at age eight. Harline graduated from the University of Utah and studied piano and organ with Mormon Tabernacle Choir conductor J. Spencer Cornwall. In 1928, he moved to California and worked at radio stations in San Francisco and Los Angeles as a composer, conductor, arranger, instrumentalist, singer, and announcer. In 1931, he provided music for the first transcontinental radio broadcast to originate from the West Coast. He was then hired by Walt Disney where he scored more than 50 tunes, including for the Silly Symphonies cartoon series in the 1930s. Harline, Frank Churchill and Paul Smith then scored Disney's first animated feature-length cartoon Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937. Snow White contained several classic songs by Churchill and lyricist Larry Morey, including \\"I'm Wishing\\", \\"Whistle While You Work\\", \\"Heigh-Ho\\", and \\"Some Day My Prince Will Come.\\" Harline re-teamed with Smith again to compose the score for Pinocchio for Disney in 1940. He also wrote most of the movie's songs with lyricist Ned Washington. The film won the three the Academy Award for Best Original Music Score and won both Harline and Washington the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the song \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\". The song went on to be featured on Disney's opening logo since 1985 and serve as the official theme song of the Walt Disney Company. Harline left Disney in 1941 to compose for other studios. His credits include Mr. Bug Goes to Town (1941) for Disney's chief competitor Max Fleischer as well as Road to Utopia (1945), Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (1948), The Desert Rats (1953), The Enemy Below (1957), Ten North Frederick (1958), Warlock (1959), The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm (1962), The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters (1963), and 7 Faces of Dr. Lao (1964).

Geography  The Godavari delta is surrounded by the tributaries of Vruddha Godavari, Vasishta Godavari, Gautami and Nilarevu. After crossing the city of Rajahmundry, the Godavari River bifurcates into two distributaries, the Vruddha Gautami (Gautami Godavari) and the Vasishta Godavari, which then further splits into the Gautami and the Nilarevu. Similarly, the Vasishta splits into two branches, the Vasishta and the Vainateya. These branches form a delta 170 km (105 mi) long along the coast of the Bay of Bengal. This delta makes up the Konaseema region. Amalapuram is the largest town in Konaseema, followed by Razole, Ravulapalem, Kothapeta, and Mummidivaram.

A generalized quadrangle is by definition a polar space of rank two. They are the with n = 4 and near 2n-gons with n = 2. They are also precisely the partial geometries pg(s,t,Œ±) with Œ± = 1. Definition A generalized quadrangle is an incidence structure (P,B,I), with I ‚äÜ P √ó B an incidence relation, satisfying certain axioms. Elements of P are by definition the points of the generalized quadrangle, elements of B the lines. The axioms are the following: * There is an s (s ‚â• 1) such that on every line there are exactly s + 1 points. There is at most one point on two distinct lines. * There is a t (t ‚â• 1) such that through every point there are exactly t + 1 lines. There is at most one line through two distinct points. * For every point p not on a line L, there is a unique line M and a unique point q, such that p is on M, and q on M and L. (s,t) are the parameters of the generalized quadrangle. The parameters are allowed to be infinite. If either s or t is one, the generalized quadrangle is called trivial. For example, the 3x3 grid with P = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} and B = {123, 456, 789, 147, 258, 369} is a trivial GQ with s = 2 and t = 1. A generalized quadrangle with parameters (s,t) is often denoted by GQ(s,t). The smallest non-trivial generalized quadrangle is GQ(2,2), whose representation has been dubbed \\"the doily\\" by Stan Payne in 1973. Properties * P=(s t+1)(s+1) * B=(s t+1)(t+1) * (s+t)st(s+1)(t+1) * s eq 1 \\\\Longrightarrow t\\\\leq s^2 * t eq 1 \\\\Longrightarrow s\\\\leq t^2 Graphs Line graph of generalized quadrangle There are two interesting graphs that can be obtained from a generalized quadrangle. * The collinearity graph having as vertices the points of a generalized quadrangle, with the collinear points connected. This graph is a strongly regular graph with parameters ((s+1)(st+1), s(t+1), s-1, t+1) where (s,t) is the order of the GQ. * The incidence graph whose vertices are the points and lines of the generalized quadrangle and two vertices are adjacent if one is a point, the other a line and the point lies on the line. The incidence graph of a generalized quadrangle is characterized by being a connected, bipartite graph with diameter four and girth eight. Therefore it is an example of a Cage. Incidence graphs of configurations are today generally called Levi graphs, but the original Levi graph was the incidence graph of the GQ(2,2). Duality If (P,B,I) is a generalized quadrangle with parameters (s,t), then (B,P,I‚àí1), with I‚àí1 the inverse incidence relation, is also a generalized quadrangle. This is the dual generalized quadrangle. Its parameters are (t,s). Even if s = t, the dual structure need not be isomorphic with the original structure.  Generalized quadrangles with lines of size 3  There are precisely five (possible degenerate) generalized quadrangles where each line has three points incident with it, the quadrangle with empty line set, the quadrangle with all lines through a fixed point corresponding to the windmill graph Wd(3,n), grid of size 3x3, the W(2) quadrangle and the unique GQ(2,4). These five quadrangles corresponds to the five root systems in the ADE classes An, Dn, E6, E7 and E8 , i.e., the simply laced root systems. See Cameron P.J.; Goethals, J.M.; Seidel, J.J; Shult, E. E.

Classical generalized quadrangles When looking at the different cases for polar spaces of rank at least three, and extrapolating them to rank 2, one finds these (finite) generalized quadrangles : * A hyperbolic quadric Q^+(3,q), a parabolic quadric Q(4,q) and an elliptic quadric Q^-(5,q) are the only possible quadrics in projective spaces over finite fields with projective index 1. We find these parameters respectively : : Q(3,q) :\\\\ s=q,t=1 (this is just a grid) : Q(4,q) :\\\\ s=q,t=q : Q(5,q) :\\\\ s=q,t=q^2 * A hermitian variety H(n,q^2) has projective index 1 if and only if n is 3 or 4. We find : : H(3,q^2) :\\\\ s=q^2,t=q : H(4,q^2) :\\\\ s=q^2,t=q^3 * A symplectic polarity in PG(2d+1,q) has a maximal isotropic subspace of dimension 1 if and only if d=1. Here, we find a generalized quadrangle W(3,q), with s=q,t=q. The generalized quadrangle derived from Q(4,q) is always isomorphic with the dual of W(3,q), and they are both self-dual and thus isomorphic to each other if and only if q is even. Non-classical examples * Let O be a hyperoval in PG(2,q) with q an even prime power, and embed that projective (desarguesian) plane \\\\pi into PG(3,q). Now consider the incidence structure T_2^{*}(O) where the points are all points not in \\\\pi, the lines are those not on \\\\pi, intersecting \\\\pi in a point of O, and the incidence is the natural one. This is a (q-1,q+1)-generalized quadrangle. * Let q be a prime power (odd or even) and consider a symplectic polarity \\\\theta in PG(3,q). Choose an arbitrary point p and define \\\\pi=p^{\\\\theta}. Let the lines of our incidence structure be all absolute lines not on \\\\pi together with all lines through p which are not on \\\\pi, and let the points be all points of PG(3,q) except those in \\\\pi. The incidence is again the natural one. We obtain once again a (q-1,q+1)-generalized quadrangle Restrictions on parameters By using grids and dual grids, any integer z, z ‚â• 1 allows generalized quadrangles with parameters (1,z) and (z,1). Apart from that, only the following parameters have been found possible until now, with q an arbitrary prime power : : (q,q) : (q,q^2) and (q^2,q) : (q^2,q^3) and (q^3,q^2) : (q-1,q+1) and (q+1,q-1) References * S.

It excludes specialized learning that can only be obtained with extensive training and information confined to a single medium. General knowledge is an essential component of crystallized intelligence. It is strongly associated with general intelligence and with openness to experience.T. C. Bates and A. Shieles. (2003). Crystallized Intelligence is a product of Speed and Drive for Experience: The Relationship of Inspection Time and Openness to g and Gc. Intelligence, 31, 275-287 Studies have found that people who are highly knowledgeable in a particular domain tend to be knowledgeable in many. General knowledge is thought to be supported by long-term semantic memory ability. General knowledge also supports schemata for textual understanding. In 2019, it was found in a survey that New Zealanders had \\"concerning\\" gaps in their general knowledge. Individual differences=Intelligence= High scorers on tests of general knowledge tend to also score highly on intelligence tests. IQ has been found to robustly predict general knowledge scores even after accounting for differences in age, sex, and five factor model personality traits. However, many general knowledge tests are designed to create a normal distribution of answers, creating a bell shaped curve. General knowledge is also moderately associated with verbal ability, though only weakly or not at all with numerical and spatial ability. As with crystallized intelligence, general knowledge has been found to increase with age. =Long-term semantic memory= General knowledge is stored as semantic memory. Most semantic memory is preserved through old age, though there are deficits in retrieval of certain specific words correlated with aging. In addition, stress or various emotional levels can negatively affect semantic memory retrieval. =Personality= People high in general knowledge tend to be highly open to new experiences and in typical intellectual engagement. The relationship between openness to experience and general knowledge remains robust even when IQ is taken into account. People high in openness may be more motivated to engage in intellectual pursuits that increase their knowledge. Relationships between general knowledge and other five factor model traits tend to be weak and inconsistent. Though one study found that extraversion and neuroticism were negatively correlated with general knowledge, others found that they were unrelated. Inconsistent results have also been found for conscientiousness. Predictor of achievement A number of studies have assessed whether performance on a general knowledge test can predict achievement in particular areas, namely in academics, proofreading, and creativity. =Academic achievement= General knowledge has been found to predict exam results in a study of British schoolchildren. The study examined cognitive ability and personality predictors of exam performance and found that general knowledge was positively correlated with GCSE English, mathematics, and overall exam results. General knowledge test scores predicted exam results, even after controlling for IQ, five factor model personality traits, and learning styles. =Proofreading= General knowledge has been found to robustly predict proofreading skills in university students. A study found that proofreading had a larger correlation with general knowledge than with general intelligence, verbal reasoning, or openness to experience. In a multiple regression analysis using general knowledge, general intelligence, verbal reasoning, five factor personality traits, and learning styles as predictors, only general knowledge was a significant predictor. =Creativity= General knowledge has been found to have weak associations with measures of creativity. In a study examining contributions of personality and intelligence to creativity, general knowledge was positively correlated with tests of divergent thinking, but was unrelated to a biographical measure of creative achievement, self-rated creativity, or a composite measure of creativity. The relationship between general knowledge and divergent thinking became non- significant when controlling for fluid intelligence. Game shows and quizzes Many game shows use general knowledge questions for entertainment purpose. Game shows such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and Fifteen to One centre their questions on general knowledge, while other shows focus questions more on specific subjects. Some shows ask questions both on specific subjects and on general knowledge, including Eggheads and 'Mastermind'. In Mastermind, contestants choose their own \\"specialist subject\\" before answering general knowledge questions, whereas in Eggheads the subjects are chosen at random. Many quizzes also use general knowledge questions for increasing the IQ. Quizzes such as Flipkart Quiz and Amazon Quiz also use general knowledge questions. Mainly their questions are related to general knowledge topics like history, sports, daily updates and much more. Questions drawn from the game Trivial Pursuit have been utilised in a number of psychological experiments concerning general knowledge.

Braulio Carrillo National Park is a National Park in Heredia Province and San Jos√© Province, in central Costa Rica It is part of the Central Conservation Area. Geography The park is located on the volcanic Cordillera Central (Central mountain range) between San Jos√© city and Puerto Lim√≥n on the Caribbean. It is accessible from the Limon Highway, which bisects the park (northwest to southeast), and from Barva canton on the north. The park is separated into three main sectors ‚Äî Zurqu√≠, Quebrada Gonzales, and Barva. History Established in 1978, the park was formed as an agreement with environmental lobbyists to limit and prevent development of the area after the construction of the Limon Highway, a major road linking the capital to Caribbean cargo port of Puerto Lim√≥n. The park was named in honor of former Costa Rican president Braulio Carrillo, whose administration had helped foster the nation's early agricultural economy and had built the first road linking San Jos√© to the Caribbean coast. Natural history The park contains many notable geological features, such as the Barva Volcano; and several dormant volcanoes including Cerro Chompipe, Cerro Cacho Negro, and Cerros las Tres Marias. The Barva sector has three crater lakes ‚Äî Barva, Danta, and Copey. The park also protects areas of the Sarapiqu√≠ River watershed, including large amounts of primary cloud and rainforest, and the flora and fauna that makes it their home. Others in the park include the Hondura River, Patria River, and the mineral-colored S√∫cio River. =Biodiversity= Both the large size (108,970 acres) of Braulio Carrillo National Park, and its varied altitude of between highest and lowest points, make it home to several WWF ecoregions. Ranging from high-altitude cloud forests to lowlands tropical rainforest, it has one of the highest levels of biodiversity in Costa Rica. More than 90% of the park is covered in primary forest. The park contains landscapes representing the WWF ecoregions of Talamancan montane forests at high elevations and the Isthmian-Atlantic moist forests at low elevations. It is significant for its biodiversity with 600 identified species of trees, over 530 species of birds, and 135 species of mammals catalogued. The area near Barva is home to the elusive frog Pristimantis altae, and the venomous snake bushmaster. Examples of birds found include the solitary eagle, the bare-necked umbrellabird, as well as several species of hummingbirds. Recreation Unlike the more popular Costa Rican parks, such as Po√°s Volcano National Park and Manuel Antonio National Park, Braulio Carrillo National Park is relatively unmaintained and untravelled. Three main ranger stations serve the park. Two of them, Quebrada Gonzales and Barva, provide sanitary facilities and drinking water for visitors. S√∫cio River, during dry weather in the park. =Hiking= There are several available hiking trails in Braulio Carrillo National Park, which can be narrow and are not regularly monitored by park rangers. The trail from Puesto Barva to the La Selva Protected Zone in the park's north is a difficult and long route. It can take over 4 days to traverse the entire length. Other shorter trails include Los Botarramas and El Ciebo, both between long. They have steep sections with panoramic views.

They are sometimes known as \\"cycad weevils\\", but this properly refers to a few species from the genera Parallocorynus and Rhopalotria. Agathinus tridens Distribution The Belidae today have an essentially Gondwanan distribution, occurring only in the Australia‚ÄìNew Guinea‚ÄìNew Zealand region up to Southeast Asia, South and Central America (barely reaching North America), some Pacific islands (notably the Hawaiian Islands) and a few places in Africa. Many lineages of belids are notable for their highly relictual distribution; for example the Aglycyderini are found in two areas on opposite sides of the Earth, with no such beetles known from anywhere in between. Belids were more widespread during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, about , when they were found at least in Central Asia, Spain and Brazil. Paleogene species belonging to still-living tribes are known from Europe and North America. Description Rhinotia haemoptera resembles a fire-coloured beetle (Pyrochroidae) in colour. Members of the subfamily Belinae are typically elongated and cylindrical. Some belines resemble other weevils, like the genus Lixus of the true weevil family (Curculionidae), or brentids. Others are mimetic and imitate less closely related Polyphaga beetles such as Lycidae or Pyrochroidae. The adults are distinguished from other ancient weevil lineages by some characteristic traits: The fore tibia of belines is unusual in that it has a comb of bristles (setae) in an apical groove opposite the tarsal articulation; this is used for grooming. Microscopically, the spermathecal gland is several times longer than the spermathecal capsule. Most also have only a few (four or fewer) setae on each mandible (more in Aglycyderini), and the pronotum is constricted at the tip (not in Oxycorynus, Parallocorynus and Rhopalotria). The endocarina is V-shaped. In most, the antennae have a retractable membrane at the base (not in Parallocorynus and Rhopalotria), and the alimentary canal has caeca distributed all over at random (in two clean bundles in Aglycyderini and Metrioxenini). Ecology The Atala butterfly (Eumaeus atala) can only survive because the belid Rhopalotria slossoni pollinates its foodplant. Adults usually eat pollen; the larvae feed on the wood of diseased or dying plants or on deadwood, flower buds or fruits. Though they may appear to be pests because of their association with plants dying off, belids tend to avoid healthy plants. They may occur as a secondary complication in plants already affected by some pest or disease however. But altogether, belids (as opposed to many other weevils) are normally harmless and can be beneficial, the adults as pollinators and the larvae as indicator species for bad condition of their host plants. In Florida for example, Rhopalotria slossoni is important in maintaining populations of the rare Coontie (Zamia pumila); indirectly, the Atala butterfly (Eumaeus atala) also depends on this beetle. The original host plants of belids were probably Araucariaceae, conifers which were extremely common during the time when the family evolved. Some modern genera also feed on angiosperms, usually rather old groups like Balanophoraceae, Myrtaceae or Vitaceae, on cycads, or on palms. The Pacific genus Proterhinus has undergone a vigorous adaptive radiation on the Hawaiian Islands and evolved to utilize a wide range of the limited diversity of plants found there. Systematics The subfamilies have each, at various times, been considered as separate families, but they are grouped together in most recent classifications. There are three living main lineages, variously considered three or, as here, two subfamilies, with the tribe Aglycyderini sometimes considered a distinct subfamily. Other classifications treat the Oxycoryninae as distinct family Oxycorynidae. A prehistoric subfamily only known from Mesozoic fossils are the Eobelinae.

His most notable work is The History of Government from the Earliest Times ‚Äì a three-volume comparative analysis of all significant government systems. He was also a major contributor to the study of civil‚Äìmilitary relations with the publication of his book, The Man on Horseback.Samuel E. Finer. 1988. The Man on Horseback: The Role of the Military in Politics. Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press. Life Samuel Finer, the youngest of six children, was born 22 September 1915 to Romanian- Jewish immigrant parents who had emigrated to the United Kingdom, and who ran a greengrocer's stall at Chapel Street market, Islington. His parents were killed in London in January 1945 by V-2 rockets. One of his brothers, Herman Finer, was also a distinguished political scientist. Although Herman emigrated to the United States, his achievement was, according to Finer, an early source of inspiration. Finer went to Holloway School, where he won a scholarship to Trinity College, Oxford. He obtained a double first in modern history and 'modern Greats' (PPE). After this, he began researching Sir Edwin Chadwick, a Benthamite civil servant. During World War II he served in the Royal Signals, where he attained the rank of captain. From 1946 to 1950, he taught politics at Balliol College, Oxford, acquiring an impressive reputation as a teacher and lecturer. From 1950 to 1966 he served as Professor of Political Institutions at the new University College of North Staffordshire (now Keele University). In 1966, he became head of the Department of Government at the University of Manchester, teaching Government and generally successfully contributing to the revival of the department's reputation. In 1974, he was made Gladstone Professor of Government at All Souls College. He retired from this post in 1982, but continued writing ‚Äì see History of Government below. He has been described as a charismatic lecturer and a very effective administrator. He believed that the academic study of politics required a firm grounding in history, and was sceptical of attempts to convert the subject into a science based on such deterministic frameworks as Marxism and behavioralism. He was chairman of the Political Studies Association of the UK from 1965 to 1969 and was a vice-president of the International Political Science Association. Samuel Finer was a passionate liberal democrat and supporter of the causes of electoral reform and Zionism. He was twice married and had two sons (one of whom is the musician Jem Finer) and one daughter. He died on 9 June 1993, aged 77, leaving a widow, Catherine.  The History of Government  Finer's magnum opus, The History of Government from the Earliest Times, is a comparative analysis of government systems, past and present. Polities covered include the Sumerian city states, the kingdom of Ancient Egypt, the Assyrian Empire, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, the Persian Empire, the Classical Greek city republics, the republic and empire of Rome, the Chinese Empire under the Han, the Tang, the Ming and the Qing, the Byzantine Empire, the Arab Caliphate, Mamluk Egypt, the European feudal kingdoms (including the emergence of representative assemblies), the Italian Mediaeval/Renaissance city republics (e.g. Florence and Venice), Tokugawa Japan, the Ottoman Empire, the Mughal Empire, and the modern state as it emerged in Europe, including themes of absolute versus parliamentary monarchy, the transplantation of European state models overseas, the Age of Enlightenment, the American and French revolutions, the constitutionalisation of the European monarchies, and industrialisation. The conceptual prologue includes a classification of government systems in terms of combinations of four elements: Palace (monarchy), Forum (democracy), Church (organised religion) and Nobility. Government is not analysed in isolation but explained in the context of economics, technology, agriculture, geography, religion, law, warfare, etc. ‚Äì giving a picture of how a state works as a mechanism, explained in language designed for the general reader. Finer had hoped that it would be a single volume, but three volumes were published, about 1,700 pages in all. History of Government occupied Finer's retirement years, 1982 to 1993. After a heart attack in 1987, he was only able to complete 34 out of the projected 36 chapters; the missing two chapters would have been on the exportation of the modern state model outside the West, and on the variations on the theme of modern totalitarianism.

[A] true circumnavigation of the Earth must: start and finish at the same point, traveling in one general direction, reach two antipodes, cross the equator, cross all longitudes, cover a minimum of 40,000km. AdventureStats by Explorersweb  History  In 2006, the Adventure publication of the National Geographic Society honored Canadians Colin Angus and Julie Wafaei as Adventurers of the Year for their \\"journey around the world\\" by human power, however, the Society stated they do not \\"act as an official arbiter of geographic issues\\". Angus' journey did not cross the equator or hit the minimum of two antipodal points as stipulated by the rules of Guinness World Records or AdventureStats by Explorersweb. Additionally, in the February 2013 issue of Outside Magazine, Angus's then traveling partner Tim Harvey went on the record to say the pair \\"put up an emergency sail, using it for about 95 nautical miles\\" crossing the Bering Sea between Alaska and Siberia. As journalist Nick Heil pointed out, this alone was enough to disqualify a human-powered claim of any description. The only other person to have completed a legitimate human-powered circumnavigation is Turkish American adventurer Erden Eru√ß who completed the first solo circumnavigation between July 2007 and July 2012. This unique concept of going around the world by human power first came as a wild idea to Stevie Smith as he worked in his office in Paris. He soon set about making the idea a reality and got the help of his friend Jason Lewis who agreed to come with him. The pair set about spreading the idea, and began to raise money for a pedal boat built by Chris Tipper and Hugo Burnham. The specially-built boat was named Moksha, Sanskrit for freedom. To raise cash Stevie cycled to Marrakesh, Morocco. The pair had no formal training in either cycling or riding pedal boats.  The Expedition =European leg= Smith and Lewis set off on bicycles from Greenwich, London at midday on 12 July 1994. They cycled south-east across Britain to the coast at Rye, then pedalled across the English Channel, and then cycled south again across France through major cities including Paris and Orl√©ans. The pair split up for a short while, meeting back up in Spain. They then travelled through Madrid, across Portugal and through Lisbon, finally arriving at Lagos on 29 September 1994. According to Smith, they slept outdoors, taking their sleeping bags into open places and sleeping under the stars. =The Atlantic Ocean= The trip across the Atlantic took 111 days, pedaling in two-hour day and four-hour night shifts. It ended in Miami. =North America= They crossed the North American continent on bicycles and skates. Skating near Pueblo, Colorado, Lewis was hit by a drunk driver and broke both of his legs. He spent 9 months in Colorado healing and resting.x360 Journal: USA LEG by inline skates (Jason) - Ft. Lauderdale to Pueblo, Colorado.

Early life Hay was born at 26 Newton Road, Faversham, Kent, the second son of Joseph Hay, an Inland Revenue Official, who was the son of Edward Hay of Coleraine, County Londonderry (d.1890), coachmaker, and Janet Robb (1864‚Äì1891) from Alloa, Scotland. His parents had married in Edinburgh in 1884, and their first son, Francis Edward Cecil Hay, died in Peebles in 1885. Joseph and Janet moved to Faversham shortly afterwards. His mother Janet died aged only 26 in January 1891 and was buried in North Merchiston Cemetery, Edinburgh, and the 1891 census finds Edward in the Cottage Hospital in Faversham. Edward moved across to Coleraine in Ireland shortly afterwards to be cared for by aunts. When young he contracted polio, which left him with a permanent limp, and apparently unable to walk until the age of 12.Byers Music. Norman Hay, a brief biography and a list of his works Education and career According to his own account he first studied the violin at the age of eight, but around the age of ten \\"I was suddenly filled with a longing to play a keyboard instrument ... and I took a vow one evening not to sleep until I had learnt the notes of the bass staff\\". He went on to take piano lessons and \\"during my five years with her [the teacher] I proceeded from Clementi and Dussek to the easier Beethoven, with not one trashy piece in between. And I think the finest thing she ever did was to leave Bach alone\\".Burgess, Barry. 'Hay, Edward Norman' in Grove Music Online Hay studied in Belfast, with Dr. Koeller and later with C.J.Brennan, Dr. E.M. Chaundy and Dr. Eaglefield-Hull. He took a Bachelors in Music at Oxford, and later a Doctorate in Music at Balliol College, Oxford for composition (1919). He was also a fellow of the Royal College of Organists (1911). Returning to Ireland he was organist at St. Patrick's Parish Church, Coleraine from 1914-1916, and thereafter was appointed organist at Bangor Abbey Church in 1922. In 1922-3 he served as Head of Music at Campbell College, Belfast, and from 1923-4 was the external examiner (degrees) at Trinity College, Dublin, and shortly before his death was lecturer in music at Queen's University, Belfast. From 1926 he served as the music critic for the Belfast Telegraph using the pseudonym \\"Rathcol\\". He also was the general editor and arranger of \\"Ulster Airs\\" for BBC Northern Ireland. He was also organist at Belmont Presbyterian Church, Belfast. He married a Coleraine girl, Hessie Haughey, at the Fitzroy Avenue Presbyterian Church, Belfast, on 7 April 1920. They had two sons, Michael (1927‚Äì2004) and Joseph Norman Haughey Hay (1924‚Äì2007). Death and legacy Hay died in 1943 in Portstewart, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. His obituary in The Times (13 September 1943) records that he \\"won the Carnegie Award for a String Quartet in A in 1918, and from 1923 to 1924 was external examiner for degrees in music at Dublin University. After working for the BBC for a time he was appointed in 1941 Lecturer on Music, Queen's University Belfast\\". It continued \\"Dr Hay's chief work was 'Paean', performed in 1932 at Worcester at the Three Choirs Festival. Notable orchestral works by him are the symphonic poem 'Dunluce (1921)' and an 'Irish Rhapsody'.\\" Dunluce, mentioned above, was performed at the London Proms in 1925, as was Paean in 1934. His work To Wonder was commissioned for the Belfast Philharmonic Societies Jubilee in 1924, and was performed on the opening of the Belfast Station of the BBC. Other awards include a Feis Ceoil prize for a six-part madrigal in 1908, another Feis Ceoil prize in 1916 for a sonata for violoncello and piano on Irish folk tunes, and in 1917 the Cobbett Prize for a string quartet on Irish folk tunes Barry Burgess describes Hay's music as having expert orchestration and tonal harmony, described in Hay's own words as \\"largely diatonic with chromatic decoration in a free modern manner\\". Burgess also detects the influence of Irish folksongs in his melodic style.

An old Saxon settlement, it was called Sanforda in the 1086 Doomsday Book. Its current name reflects its inclusion in the Honour of Peverel, the lands of William Peverel and his family. His great-grandson, Hugh Peverell (the name had changed spelling), is buried in the village church of St John the Baptist. The parish is surrounded, clockwise from the north, by the parishes of Hockworthy, Holcombe Rogus, Burlescombe, Halberton and Uplowman. The New Rectory was built in 1836, at the expense of the Grand Western Canal Company, in compensation for cutting through the grounds and demolishing the south wing of the Old Rectory which had been built for the use of Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII. The Great Western Railway opened a station at Sampford Peverell in 1932 but it closed on 5 October 1964; the site has since been reused as Tiverton Parkway railway station (opened in 1986). Poltergeist hoax In 1810 it was reported that the house of a John Chave in the village was experiencing dramatic poltergeist activity. The case was discussed in the national press of the time, and Chave's house gained such notoriety that in 1811 it was besieged by a mob of rowdy workmen known as navvies. In the scenes that followed, Chave was forced to open fire on the crowd in self-defence, killing one person, a George Helps, buried in the churchyard. The paranormal activity turned out to be noises made by smugglers behind a false wall.

Previously, Freud attributed most human behavior to the sexual instinct (Eros or libido). With this essay, Freud went \\"beyond\\" the simple pleasure principle, developing his drive theory with the addition of the death drive(s), Todestrieb[e]. (Thanatos is the Greek personification of death, and some of Freud's followers refer to the death drive by this name.)In this work, Freud used the plural \\"death drives\\" (Todestriebe) more often than in the singular.  Importance  The essay describes humans as struggling between two opposing drives: Eros, which produces creativity, harmony, sexual connection, reproduction, and self- preservation; and the \\"death drive\\" (what some call \\"Thanatos\\"), which brings destruction, repetition, aggression, compulsion, and self-destruction. In sections IV and V, Freud posits that the process of creating living cells binds energy and creates an imbalance. It is the pressure of matter to return to its original state which gives cells their quality of living. The process is analogous to the creation and exhaustion of a battery. This pressure for molecular diffusion can be called a \\"death-wish\\". The compulsion of the matter in cells to return to a diffuse, inanimate state extends to the whole living organism. Thus, the psychological death-wish is a manifestation of an underlying physical compulsion present in every cell. Freud also stated the basic differences, as he saw them, between his approach and Carl Jung's, and summarized published research into basic drives (Section VI).  Synopsis  \\"Beyond the Pleasure Principle is a difficult text.\\"Peter Gay, Freud: A Life for Our Time (London 1988). p. 398. As Ernest Jones, one of Freud's closest associates and a member of his Inner Ring, put it, \\"the train of thought [is] by no means easy to follow ... and Freud's views on the subject have often been considerably misinterpreted.\\" Ernest Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (London 1964). pp. 510‚Äì11. What have been called the \\"two distinct frescoes or canti\\"Laplanche, Life. p. 107. of Beyond the Pleasure Principle break between sections III and IV. If, as Otto Fenichel remarked, Freud's \\"new [instinctual] classification has two bases, one speculative, and one clinical\\",Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946). p. 58. thus far the clinical. In Freud's own words, the second section \\"is speculation, often far-fetched speculation, which the reader will consider or dismiss according to his individual predilection\\"Sigmund Freud, Beyond the Pleasure Principle in On Metapsychology (Middlesex 1987). p. 295. ‚Äî it has been noted that \\"in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud used that unpromising word \\"speculations\\" more than once\\".Gay, Freud. p. 704n. =Clinical evidence (sections I‚ÄìIII)= Freud begins with \\"a commonplace then unchallenged in psychoanalytic theory: 'The course of mental events is automatically regulated by the pleasure principle ... a strong tendency toward the pleasure principle'\\".Gay, Freud. p. 399. After considering the inevitable presence of unpleasant experiences in the life of the mind, he concludes the book's first section to the effect that the presence of such unpleasant experiences \\"does not contradict the dominance of the pleasure principle ... does not seem to necessitate any far-reaching limitation of the pleasure principle.\\"Freud, Beyond. p. 280. Exceptions to the pleasure principle Freud proceeds to look for \\"evidence, for the existence of hitherto unsuspected forces 'beyond' the pleasure principle.\\" He found exceptions to the universal power of the pleasure principle‚Äî\\"situations ... with which the pleasure principle cannot cope adequately\\"Jean-Michel Quinodoz, Reading Freud (London 2005). p. 187.‚Äîin four main areas: children's games, as exemplified in his grandson's famous \\"fort-da\\" game; \\"the recurrent dreams of war neurotics ...; the pattern of self-injuring behaviour that can be traced through the lives of certain people [\\"fate neurosis\\"]; the tendency of many patients in psycho-analysis to act out over and over again unpleasant experiences of their childhood.\\"Jones, Life. p. 506. Repetition compulsion From these cases, Freud inferred the existence of motivations beyond the pleasure principle. Freud already felt in 1919 that he could safely postulate \\"the principle of a repetition compulsion in the unconscious mind, based upon instinctual activity and probably inherent in the very nature of the instincts‚Äîa principle powerful enough to overrule the pleasure-principle\\".Sigmund Freud, \\"The Uncanny\\" (1919), in Studies in Parapsychology (Alix Strachey trans.). p. 44. In the first half of Beyond the Pleasure Principle, \\"a first phase, the most varied manifestations of repetition, considered as their irreducible quality, are attributed to the essence of drives\\"Jean Laplanche, Life and Death in Psychoanalysis (London 1976). p. 107. in precisely the same way. Building on his 1914 article \\"Recollecting, Repeating and Working Through\\", Freud highlights how the \\"patient cannot remember the whole of what is repressed in him, and ... is obliged to repeat the repressed material as a contemporary experience instead of ... remembering it as something belonging to the past:\\"Freud, Beyond. p. 288. a \\"compulsion to repeat.\\" Independence from the pleasure principle Freud still wanted to examine the relationship between repetition compulsion and the pleasure principle.Freud, Beyond. p. 290. Although compulsive behaviors evidently satisfied some sort of drive, they were a source of direct unpleasure. Somehow, \\"no lesson has been learnt from the old experience of these activities having led only to unpleasure. In spite of that, they are repeated, under pressure of a compulsion\\".Freud, Beyond. p. 292. Also noting repetitions in the lives of normal people‚Äîwho appeared to be \\"pursued by a malignant fate or possessed by some daemonic power,\\" likely alluding to the Latin motto errare humanum est, perseverare autem diabolicum (\\"to err is human, to persist [in committing errors] is of the devil\\")‚ÄîFreud concludes that the human psyche includes a compulsion to repeat that is independent of the pleasure principle.Freud, Sigmund. Beyond the Pleasure Principle (The Standard Edition). Trans. James Strachey. New York: Liveright Publishing Corporation, 1961. =Speculation (sections IV‚ÄìVII)= Arguing that dreams in which one relives trauma serve a binding function in the mind, connected to repetition compulsion, Freud admits that such dreams are an exception to the rule that the dream is the fulfillment of a wish.Freud, Beyond. p. 304. Asserting that the first task of the mind is to bind excitations to prevent trauma (so that the pleasure principle does not begin to dominate mental activities until the excitations are bound), he reiterates the clinical fact that for \\"a person in analysis ... the compulsion to repeat the events of his childhood in the transference evidently disregards the pleasure principle in every way\\".Freud, Beyond. p. 308. Biological basis for repetition compulsion Freud begins to look for analogies of repetition compulsion in the \\"essentially conservative ... feature of instinctual life ... the lower we go in the animal scale the more stereotyped does instinctual behavior appear\\".Jones, Life. p. 507. Thereafter \\"a leap in the text can be noticed when Freud places the compulsion to repeat on an equal footing with 'an urge ... to restore an earlier state of things'\\"Gunnar Karlson, Psychoanalysis in a New Light (Cambridge 2010). p. 147. ‚Äî ultimately that of the original inorganic condition. Declaring that \\"the aim of life is death\\" and \\"inanimate things existed before living ones\\",Freud, Beyond. p. 311. Freud interprets an organism's drive to avoid danger only as a way of avoiding a short-circuit to death: the organisms seeks to die in its own way. He thus found his way to his celebrated concept of the death drive, an explanation that some scholars have labeled as \\"metaphysical biology\\". Thereupon, \\"Freud plunged into the thickets of speculative modern biology, even into philosophy, in search of corroborative evidence\\"Gay, Freud. p. 401. ‚Äî looking to \\"arguments of every kind, frequently borrowed from fields outside of psychoanalytic practice, calling to the rescue biology, philosophy, and mythology\\".Laplanche, Life. p. 110. He turned to prewar experiments on protozoa ‚Äî of perhaps questionable relevance, even if it is not the case that 'his interpretation of the experiments on the successive generations of protozoa contains a fatal flaw'.Malcolm Macmillan, Freud evaluated (MIT 1997). p. 400. The most that can perhaps be said is that Freud did not find \\"any biological argument which contradicts his dualistic conception of instinctual life\\",Jean-Michel Quinodoz, Reading Freud (London 2005). p. 190. but at the same time, \\"as Jones (1957) points out, 'no biological observation can be found to support the idea of a death instinct, one which contradicts all biological principles'\\"Charles Rycroft, A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis (London 1995). p. 31. either. Masochism as clinical manifestation Freud then continued with a reference to \\"the harbour of Schopenhauer's philosophy\\"; but in groping for a return to the clinical he admitted that \\"it looks suspiciously as though we were trying to find a way out of a highly embarrassing situation at any price\\".Freud, Beyond. p. 322 and p. 328. Freud eventually decided that he could find a clinical manifestation of the death instinct in the phenomenon of masochism, \\"hitherto regarded as secondary to sadism ... and suggested that there could be a primary masochism, a self-injuring tendency which would be an indication of the death instinct\\".Jones, Life p. 509 In a footnote he cited Sabina Spielrein admitting that \\"A considerable part of this speculation has been anticipated in a work which is full of valuable matter and ideas but is unfortunately not entirely clear to me: (Sabina Spielrein: Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens, Jahrbuch f√ºr Psychoanalyse, IV, 1912). She designates the sadistic component as 'destructive'.\\"Freud, Beyond. p. ? To then explain the sexual instinct as well in terms of a compulsion to repeat, Freud inserts a myth from Plato that humans are driven to reproduce in order to join together the sexes, which had once existed in single individuals who were both male and female ‚Äî still \\"in utter disregard of disciplinary distinctions\\";Teresa de Lauretis, Freud's Drive (Basingstoke 2008). p. 77. and admits again the speculative nature of his own ideas, \\"lacking a direct translation of observation into theory ... One may have made a lucky hit or one may have gone shamefully astray\\"'.Freud, Beyond. p. 333. Conclusion Nevertheless, with the libido or Eros as the life force finally set out on the other side of the repetition compulsion equation, the way was clear for the book's closing \\"vision of two elemental pugnacious forces in the mind, Eros and Thanatos, locked in eternal battle\\".  Composition: Freud's defensiveness  Freud's daughter Sophie died at the start of 1920, partway between Freud's first (1919) version and the version of Beyond the Pleasure Principle reworked and published in 1920. Freud insisted that the death had no relation to the contents of the book. In a July 18, 1920, letter to Max Eitingon, Freud wrote, \\"The Beyond is now finally finished. You will be able to confirm that it was half ready when Sophie lived and flourished\\".Gay, Freud. p. 703. He had however already written (in June) to Ferenczi \\"that 'curious continuations' had turned up in it, presumably the part about the potential immortality of protozoa\\". Ernest Jones considers Freud's claim on Eitingon \\"a rather curious request ... [perhaps] an inner denial of his novel thoughts about death having been influenced by his depression over losing his daughter\\".Jones, Life. p. 504. Others have also wondered about \\"inventing a so-called death instinct ‚Äî is this not one way of theorising, that is, disposing of ‚Äî by means of a theory ‚Äî a feeling of the \\"demoniac\\" in life itself ... exacerbated by the unexpected death of Freud's daughter\\"?Maria Torok, in Nicolas Abraham/Maria Torok, The Wolf Man's Magic Word (Minneapolis 1986). p. 90. ‚Äî and it is certainly striking that \\"the term 'death drive' ‚Äî Todestrieb ‚Äî entered his correspondence a week after Sophie Halberstadt's death\\"; so that we may well accept at the very least that the \\"loss can claim a subsidiary role ... [in]his analytic preoccupation with destructiveness\\".Gay, Freud. p. 395.  Fruitfulness  On his final page, Freud acknowledges that his theorising \\"in turn raises a host of other questions to which we can at present find no answer\\".Freud, Beyond. p. 336. Whatever legitimate reservations there may be about \\"the improbability of our speculations. A queer instinct, indeed, directed to the destruction of its own organic home\\",Sigmund Freud, New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (London 1991). p. 139. Freud's speculative essay has proven remarkably fruitful in stimulating further psychoanalytic research and theorising, both in himself and in his followers; and we may consider it as a prime example of Freud in his role \\"as a problem finder ‚Äî one who raises new questions ... called attention to a whole range of human phenomena and processes\\".Howard Gardner, Extraordinary Minds (London 1997). p. 82. Thus for example Andr√© Green has suggested that Freud \\"turned to the biology of micro-organisms ... because he was unable to find the answers to the questions raised by psychoanalytic practice\\": the fruitfulness of the questions ‚Äî in the spirit of 'Maurice Blanchot's sentence, \\"La r√©ponse est le malheur de la question\\" [The answer is the misfortune of the question]'Andr√© Green, in P. B. Talamo et al., W. R. Bion (London 2007). p. 119 and p. 122. ‚Äî remains nonetheless unimpaired. =Freud's later writing= The distinction between pleasure principle and death drive led Freud to restructure his model of the psyche.Angela Richards, \\"Editor's Note\\" Metapsychology. p. 272. With Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud also introduced the question of violence and destructiveness in humans. These themes play an important role in Civilization and Its Discontents, in which Freud suggests that civilization's major function is to repress the death instinct. The instinct persists in the forms of superego and neurosis. Freud's indication \\"that in cases of traumatism there is a ' lack of any preparedness for anxiety '... is a forerunner of the distinction he would later make ... between 'automatic anxiety' and 'anxiety as a signal'\\".Quinodox, Reading Freud. p. 189. * For Lacan, repetition compulsion was one of the \\"four ... terms introduced by Freud as fundamental concepts, namely, the unconscious, repetition, the transference and the drive\\".Jacques Lacan, The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis (London 1994). p. 12. * Eric Berne adapts the way \\"Freud speaks of the repetition compulsion and the destiny compulsion ... to apply them to the entire life courses\\"Eric Berne, What Do You Say After You Say Hello? (Corgi 1975). p. 58. of normals and neurotics alike. * Both Melanie Klein and Lacan were to adopt versions of the death drive in their own theoretical constructs. \\"Klein's concept of the death drive differs from Freud's ... but there is an ever-increasing reference to the death drive as a given cause of mental development\\"L. Stonebridge/J. Phillips, Reading Melanie Klein (London 1998). p. 30. in her works. Lacan for his part considered that \\"the death drive is only the mask of the symbolic order, in so ... far as it has not been realised\\", adding modestly of Beyond the Pleasure Principle \\"... either it makes not the least bit of sense or it has exactly the sense I say it has\\".Lacan, Seminar II. p. 326 and p. 60.  Critical reception  Beyond the Pleasure Principle may be Freud's most controversial text. Jacques Lacan, a self-styled Freudian, called \\"this extraordinary text of Freud's, unbelievably ambiguous, almost confused\\".Jacques-Alain Miller, The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book II (Cambridge 1988). p. 37. One of Freud's most sympathetic biographers wrote that \\"Beyond the Pleasure Principle is a difficult text ... the reassuring intimacy with clinical experience that marks most of Freud's papers, even at their most theoretical, seems faint here, almost absent\\". He went on to quote Freud's personal physician: \\"Max Schur, whom no one can accuse of reading Freud unsympathetically, said flatly: 'We can only assume that Freud's conclusions ... are an example of ad hoc reasoning to prove a preformed hypothesis ... throughout Beyond the Pleasure Principle.Gay, p. 398n. Ernest Jones concluded that \\"This book is further noteworthy in being the only one of Freud's which has received little acceptance on the part of his followers\\".Jones, Life. p. 505. Many of Freud's colleagues and students rejected the theories proposed in Beyond the Pleasure Principle because the idea of a drive towards death seemed strange.Freud, Sigmund.

No Name products are available in stores across Canada that include Loblaws, No Frills, Dominion, Real Canadian Superstore, Your Independent Grocer, valu- mart, Zehrs, Fortinos, Provigo, Extra Foods, Super-Valu, Maxi, Atlantic Superstore, and Shoppers Drug Mart. Launch On March 21, 1978, Loblaw launched \\"No Name\\" with 16 generic or unbranded items in black and yellow packaging. It was initially promoted as \\"basic products in plain packaging at down-to-earth everyday low prices\\", No Name promised savings of between 10 and 40 percent over national brands. The launch beat rival supermarket chain Dominion, with its own line of generic products, by 24 hours. Available at Loblaws' 135 stores across Ontario, full-page ads claimed that No Name offered the best value for money as a combination of price and quality ‚Äì the result of cost controls associated with using standard instead of custom packaging and the efforts of its own \\"task force\\" in negotiating lower priced, bulk orders from suppliers. The introduction of No Name, along with other generics, coincided with a period of rising inflation rates and consumer complaints regarding the high price of food. Two years earlier, French hypermarket Carrefour unveiled Produits Libres, a line of 50 unbranded products. Loblaws Supermarkets president Dave Nichol modelled No Name on Produits Libres. Although Nichol made no guarantee that the product line would be continued beyond the initial launch, after two and a half weeks more than a million units had been sold. With suppliers trying to keep up with demand, and some products sold out, Nichol declared No Name a \\"runaway success\\" that exceeded his own expectations: > But diving headlong into No-Name products, which have had only limited > success in France and the United States, was Nichol‚Äôs idea. Grocery shoppers > have snapped them up at a rate that has astonished even Nichol. In nine > months, Loblaws has sold 15 million of them, which Nichol says is enough to > make Ontario the largest market in the world for unbranded products. And > strangely enough, Loblaws shoppers seem to be developing a brand loyalty to > these unbranded products. The Japan-based unbranded multinational Muji first > products released in 1980 that eventually surpassed No Name in sales. A few months after the launch, Loblaws opened the first No Frills store, a deep discount, limited service and selection supermarket, with only 500 items, which featured No Name among its product selection. The opening proved a success and two more Toronto area stores soon followed. Meanwhile, Nichol continued to heavily promote No Name on television and was dubbed \\"Mr. No Name\\" by news headlines. While one competitor spoke critically of Nichol for spending so much on advertising, thereby increasing the costs associated with a discount product line, Nichol responded that Loblaw had simply redirected more of its promotional budget towards No Name. Four months after the launch, generic products across all Canadian grocery store shelves accounted for nearly 10 percent of supermarket sales. One year later, Loblaw had expanded its generic line-up to over a hundred items. Branding, packaging and promotion No name corned beef In keeping with the generic nature of the product line, the original No Name packaging showed no branding ‚Äì only text with a basic product description and name, such as \\"freshly ground coffee\\" or \\"fabric softener,\\" on a solid background. Years later, a \\"No Name\\" registered trademark appeared. While other generic lines presented their packaging as black on white, Toronto designer Don Watt chose black, boldface text in a Helvetica font, all lower case, on a bright yellow background, as a means of attracting the attention of shoppers. Throughout the 1980s, Loblaw continued to promote No Name as a value-oriented alternative to higher priced, nationally advertised products. In 1981, Dave Nichol went on television with two grocery carts, one with a selection of No Name items and the other with comparable national brands, to demonstrate a 30 percent savings: > For five or six years I did nothing but go into people's living rooms and > say, 'Here's one basket of national brands for $150, and here are the same > products from no name for $100. If you don't like them, we'll give you the > national brands free. By 1982, the number of No Name items had increased to some 500 different products and ranged from canned peas, to spaghetti sauce, to tooth paste and even windshield washer fluid. The Financial Times of Canada noted that in spite of basic packaging and the reputation of generics as inferior, \\"Loblaws No Name line was, in fact, competing directly with national brands.\\" The newspaper also commented that the heavy promotion of No Name by Loblaws president Dave Nichol had helped boost the sale of generics in all supermarkets. Loblaw also expanded the line beyond basic grocery and household items in an apparent bid to appeal to a wider range of consumer tastes. Products such as No Name gourmet barbecue sauce, Dijon mustard, escargot and imported jams from France appeared on Loblaw shelves. In late 1983, \\"President‚Äôs Blend gourmet coffee\\", in the familiar black and yellow packaging, made its debut and sales proved so strong that the decision was made to create a separate, premium line of products called \\"President's Choice\\". Beyond gourmet items, there were also those of a more unusual, albeit still practical, nature such as the No Name raccoon-proof garbage pail, with steel handles that clamped to the sides of the container. But most No Name items continued to be everyday products, with the brand promoted as \\"a sensible solution to rising prices.\\" By the end of the decade there were more than 1,800 No Name products available. By the mid-1980s, No Name had become the best selling brand in the country ‚Äì a somewhat ironic development, considering the generic, non-branded nature of the product line, promoted as an economical alternative to the national brands. Additionally, No Name had achieved such prominence in spite of being available only in Loblaw owned stores. Media reports attributed much of that success to Dave Nichol and his marketing efforts. \\"Under Nichol's supervision, the country's No Name products have become the largest-selling national brand in Canada, one of the few countries in the world where generic brands compete with well-known names\\", wrote Maclean's magazine. But according to Nichol, the big name brands were also vulnerable: > I happened to come along at a time when the national brands had prostituted > the quality of their products. It is so easy to produce products that are > superior to almost every national brand. In the 1980s, No Name diverged from its original plain packaging as red lettering and various product illustrations were added. Meanwhile, a 1987 segment of the CTV Television Network show Live It Up! took the position that the line‚Äôs product packaging wasn't doing enough to adequately distinguish relatively harmless cooking sprays from more dangerous cleaning products. During that same program, a Loblaw executive presented the company‚Äôs solution ‚Äì a No Name spray canister with a red cap to indicate potentially harmful contents. In the 1990s, photography was increasingly incorporated as No Name packaging became more elaborate and less distinguishable from national brand products. Additional formats were also introduced, such as \\"No Name Club Pack\\" and promoted as \\"No Membership Required\\" in order to compete with 'big box' membership-based competitors who offered bulk items at reduced prices. With the increasing popularity of the President's Choice brand through the 1980s and 1990s, attention and advertising dollars shifted to Loblaw's premium line. Nevertheless, the number and range of No Name products grew. The generic line also continued to do well in consumer affairs testing as conducted by media outlets. A 1982 product comparison ranked No Name windshield washer fluid among the top four of eight tested as all \\"equally excellent\\", while No Name disposable diapers came in a close second to Dominion's generic label, beating out the national brands. A 1989 Toronto Star taste testing panel ranked No Name freshly roasted ground coffee fourth out of eleven different nationally available brands. Re-launch of No Name In 2009, Loblaws re-launched No Name, \\"the iconic brand and its unmistakable plain black printing on yellow packaging\\". New product packaging included a return to black Helvetica lettering on a yellow background, along with some limited product illustration. Loblaws executive David Primorac said the company decided to bring back the original colour palette as something familiar to shoppers. \\"It's something recognizable and it's easy for consumers.\\" Also, for the first time since the early 1990s, No Name television commercials were aired which showed Loblaws Executive Chairman Galen G. Weston in a shopping cart comparison reminiscent of the Dave Nichol commercials of the early 1980s: > Pointing at the cart of \\"top selling no name products\\" and then the cart > filled with \\"26 comparable national brands\\", Weston says the national brands > cost $100.38 in its stores, while the No Name brands cost just $73.91. > That's a savings of $26.46, he adds. (Based on average prices from May 25 to > November. 22 in 922 Loblaws-owned stores, the company notes in fine-print.) > He then removes any risk involved in switching by saying if you don't like > the no name version, Loblaws will give you your money back. Weston also made reference to the economic recession, noting that these are \\"challenging times and you need real, no-nonsense ways to stretch your dollar\\". A later series of television commercials simply showed text on a yellow background with various promotional lines on how No Name \\"helps you save\\". One ad noted, \\"We don't have a single item under $2. We have 300.\\" David Rosenberg, creative director for Bensimon Byrne, the Toronto agency which created the TV spots, commented that the ads were produced for a fraction of what a standard Canadian TV commercial costs. With tougher economic times, the company has refocused its attention on its \\"control label\\" program. According to vice president Paul Uys, \\"private brands are very important in a recession.\\" Noting the company's renewed competitive bent, he described how some national brands were infringing on the company's own frozen rising-crust pizza sales. Loblaws switched its product from the President's Choice label to No Name, dropped the price by a dollar and gave it prominent display space. Sales subsequently rebounded. Since the launch of No Name in 1978, the generic line has expanded from the original 16 items to more than 2,900 different products. In 2019, Loblaw launched a multi-platform advertising campaign for the brand (its largest since 2009), with a focus on its \\"Simple Check\\" program‚Äî which covers No Name products produced without ingredients such as hydrogenated oil, or artificial colours and flavouring. The campaign has included social media marketing, such as an official Twitter account containing deadpan quips regarding its products (\\"Social tea biscuits ‚Äî can be consumed alone\\") and \\"liveblogging\\" the Primetime Emmy Awards (\\"a winner has won again\\"), as well as an attempted \\"viral cat video\\". The campaign also included out-of-home advertising, primarily within the Toronto area, including GO trains and a taxi cab with livery mimicking No Name's packaging and social media posts (with the former labelled \\"for going places\\"), as well as billboards, and mural ads at Union Station.  Imitations in other countries  Here is a list of countries where supermarkets have taken the same approach in packing their products. = Italy = Italian supermarket Esselunga launched a new line of products called \\"SMART\\" and featuring the same yellow and generic packaging as No Name. The line is low priced compared to other Esselunga brands. = Sweden = The Swedish consumer co-operative retail group Kooperativa F√∂rbundet had a store-brand product line called \\"BL√ÖVITT\\" (Swedish for \\"blue and white\\") which featured groceries in uniform packaging with the product name in white capital letters over a blue label against a blank or white package. The line was active from 1979 to 2003.

Career He entered Dong-A University on a taekwondo scholarship in 1995 and performed consistently well in national competitions during his college years, though usually overshadowed by the dominant heavyweight champion Kim Je-Gyoung. Upon graduation from Dong-A University in Busan, South Korea in 1999, Moon became a member of the Samsung Corporation Professional Taekwondo team. Many considered Moon to be the next Kim Je-Gyoung, two time Olympic Gold Medalist and also a member of the Samsung Professional Team and graduate of Dong-A University, in the heavyweight division of the Korean National team. Since his high profile win at the Athens Olympic Games, Moon has become a well known celebrity in South Korea, owing to his performance in the Gold Medal round. He has become the official Audi Automobile Company's spokesman and has made numerous television and public appearances. Notable abilities which make him an elite and consistent athlete are: Left leg roundhouse kick, left leg back kick and reverse (with which he knocked out Alexandros Nikolaidis) as well as a solid grasp of other core techniques indispensable to fighting in high level international and Korean domestic competitions.

In April 2012, the research ethics committee of the Kookmin University announced: \\"The research subject of the doctoral thesis by Moon Dae-sung and part of the purpose of the research of his thesis overlap with those of a doctoral thesis by a person surnamed Kim at Myongji University.

In March 2014, Kookmin University officially canceled his PhD.

From Springfield Armory, the Larsons went into partnership with Les Baer to form Les Baer Custom and build custom 1911 pistols. Parting ways with Les Baer in 1993, the Larsons began to build AR-15 type rifles for Eagle Arms in Coal Valley, Illinois. At around the same time, they began their own venture, Tolerance Plus (the name was later changed to Rock River Arms), producing custom 1911 pistols. The Larson brothers severed their connection with Eagle Arms in 1997 when that firm moved to Geneseo, Illinois. At the same time, Rock River Arms began to build AR-15 style rifles.

She was one of the founders of the science of epidemiology, pioneering the use of cohort studies and case-control studies. Early life and education Lane-Claypon was born Janet Elizabeth Claypon in 1877 into an affluent family, in Boston, Lincolnshire, the daughter of William Ward Lane-Claypon, a banker and former first-class cricketer, and Edith (n√©e Stow). Her uncle C. G. Lane was also a first-class cricketer. A few weeks after her birth, her father changed the family name to Lane-Claypon by royal license. She was privately educated and entered the London School of Medicine for Women in 1898, winning numerous honors and fellowships. During her training, the British Medical Society awarded Lane-Claypon a research scholarship‚Äîthe first time it had ever bestowed the honor on a woman. She earned both an MD and DSc (making her an early example of the \\"Doctor-doctor\\" phenomenon). Career Immediately after her education, Lane-Claypon began research at University College, London. During the first phase of her career, Dr. Lane-Claypon's research focused on female reproductive physiology‚Äîspecifically the structure and function of the ovary. In 1912, Lane-Claypon published a ground-breaking study of two cohorts (groups) of babies, fed cow's milk and breast milk respectively. Lane-Claypon found that those babies fed breast milk gained more weight, and she used statistical methods to show that the difference was unlikely to occur by fluke alone. She also investigated whether something other than the type of milk could account for the difference, an effect known as confounding. Having demonstrated the power of cohort studies, Lane-Claypon went on to develop another key type of epidemiological investigation, the case-control study. Lane-Claypon tracked down 500 women with a history of breast cancerthe \\"cases\\"and compared them with 500 women who were free of the disease but otherwise broadly similar, known as \\"controls\\". She showed that breast cancer risk increased for childless women, women who married later than average, and women who did not breast feed. The overall breast cancer risk decreased according to the number of children. For all cases, rapid treatment held the key to survival among women with breast cancer.This study eventually led to the incorporation of risk tables and life expectancy in cancer treatment. In 1916, Dr. Lane-Claypon was named the dean of King's College for Women. However, departmental politics and pressures led her to resign her post and return to research, where she remained until the end of her career. In total, Lane-Claypon published three books and 30 scientific papers. Personal life In 1929, Lane-Claypon married civil servant Sir Edward Rodolph Forber (1878‚Äì1960), as his second wife. Sir Forber held several prominent positions, including Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Health. Lane-Claypon's final paper was published under her married name, and she essentially retired following her marriage, not uncommon for a woman of her class in this era. Lady Forber died in 1967, aged 90.

Born in 1909, he was a Moundang chief of Mayo-Kebbi, in what was then the French colony of Chad.  Political activity in UDT  Sahoulba entered national politics when political parties were officially accepted in 1946 by founding the Chadian Democratic Union (UDT), the first African political party, conservative in its outlook and favoured by the colonial administration, with other traditional leaders. The party had no true opposition in local elections until 1953. Sahoulba also served in the French Senate from 1951-1959. From 1953 the UDT started to be superseded in French and popular support by the Chadian Social Action (AST), to which Sahoulba adhered with other prominent politicians like Ahmed Koulamallah, Bechi Sow and Ahmed Kotoko.  Political activity in GIRT  But the picture radically changed in 1956, with the electoral reforms that greatly expanded the number of eligible voters, giving strength to the Gabriel Lisette's nationalistic Chadian Progressive Party (PPT). Sahoulba decided with others to leave the AST before the 1957 elections for the Territorial Assembly, forming the Groupement des Ind√©pendants et Ruraux Tchadiens (GIRT). In the elections the PPT triumphed, while the GIRT came second with 9 seats out of 65. Gabriel Lisette formed Chad's first African government, but it didn't last long: Sahoulba and Koulamallah formed a new party, the Chadian Popular Movement (Mouvement Populaire Tchadien or MPT) which following a motion of no confidence presented February 11, 1959, was instrumental in causing the downfall of Lisette. Sahoulba succeeded him as President of the Provisional Government, forming a government of which he was the only southern Chadian. This exclusion of the south generated high resentment, and brought Koulamallah to ally himself with Lisette against Sahoulba; as a result, a new motion of no confidence was approved with 35 votes against 30, and a new government was formed by Koulamallah March 13, 1959. Sahoulba now on ceased to play any significant role in Chadian politics; he was to die in 1963.

The screenplay by Reginald Berkeley and Sonya Levien is based on the 1931 play of the same title by No√´l Coward. The film stars Diana Wynyard and Clive Brook. The story presents a view of English life during the first third of the 20th century from New Year's Eve 1899 to New Year's Day 1933, from the point of view of well-to-do London residents Jane and Robert Marryot, their children, their close friends, and their servants. Several historical events affect the lives of the characters or serve as background for the film, including the Second Boer War, the death of Queen Victoria, the sinking of the RMS Titanic, and World War I. Throughout the film, the passage of years is indicated by dates on title cards, with a Medieval cavalcade marching in the background. The film won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Plot On the last day of 1899, Jane and Robert Marryot, an upper- class couple, return to their townhouse in a fashionable area of London before midnight, so they can keep their tradition of celebrating the new year with a midnight toast. Although Jane and Robert have been married for some years and have two young sons, Edward and Joey, they are still very much in love. Jane worries because Robert has joined the City of London Imperial Volunteers (CIV) as an officer, and will soon be leaving to serve in the Second Boer War, where Jane's brother is already fighting in the Siege of Mafeking. Downstairs, the Marryots' butler Alfred Bridges mixes punch for their toast, while Cook dons her finest outfit to attend the public outdoor celebrations. Alfred has joined the CIV as a private and is also leaving soon. His wife Ellen, the Marryots' maid, worries about what will become of her and their new baby Fanny if Alfred is killed or seriously injured, but he is confident despite the pessimistic predictions of Ellen's elderly mother, Mrs. Snapper. At midnight, the Marryot and Bridges families ring in the new century while Cook dances with other revelers in the street. Shortly thereafter, Jane bids an emotional farewell to Robert at the dock when he boards the troop ship bound for Africa, while Ellen tearfully sees off Alfred, who is leaving on the same ship. While Robert is away, Jane's friend Margaret Harris keeps her company and gives her emotional support. Margaret's young daughter Edith plays Boer War games with Edward and Joey Marryot using toy soldiers and cannons, which distresses Jane. While Jane and Margaret are attending a comic operetta at the theatre to take Jane's mind off the war, the relief of Mafeking is announced from the stage, and the audience cheers. Robert and Alfred soon return home unharmed, to the delight of their families, and Robert is knighted for his service. Upon his arrival, Alfred announces to his wife and mother-in-law that he has bought his own pub with money partly provided by Robert, and he and Ellen will be leaving service and moving to a flat, along with Fanny and Mrs. Snapper. As the downstairs staff have a cup of tea to celebrate Alfred's return, they receive news of the death of Queen Victoria. Robert rides in the beginning part of her funeral procession and the family and staff watch it from their upstairs windows. A few years later, in 1908, Alfred has developed alcoholism and is managing the pub poorly and getting behind on the family's rent due to spending the rent money on drink. Ellen and Fanny, now a schoolgirl, are embarrassed and put off by Alfred's drinking and slovenly appearance. Ellen carefully plans a genteel social evening when Jane Marryot and her son Edward, who is now in college at Oxford, pay a visit to the Bridgeses' flat. Ellen does not tell Alfred about the visit and lies to the Marryots that he can't attend due to a leg injury, but just as the Marryots are leaving, Alfred shows up drunk, acts rudely and destroys a doll that Jane had given Fanny, causing Fanny to run away into the street, where she distracts herself by dancing with some Pearlies. An angry Alfred chases Fanny, attacks the Pearlies, and then stumbles into the street where he is fatally run over by a horse-drawn fire engine. The following year, on July 25, 1909, Ellen and Fanny Bridges encounter the Marryot family again at the seaside, where Ellen explains that she and Fanny are living off the proceeds from the pub, now owned by Ellen. Fanny has become a talented dancer and singer. Edward Marryot has fallen in love with his childhood playmate Edith Harris. The family witnesses the historic flight by Louis Bl√©riot over the English Channel. Three years later, by April 1912, Edward and Edith have married and are spending their honeymoon on a luxurious four-funneled ocean liner, which is dramatically revealed by a camera shot on a life preserver on board to be the ill-fated RMS Titanic. Later scenes make it clear that Edward and Edith both perished in the sinking, although the sinking itself, their deaths, and their families' initial reaction to it are not shown but only briefly mentioned in later dialogue. Fanny and Joe Two years later, in 1914, World War I breaks out. Robert and Joe Marryot both serve as officers, thinking the war will be over within a few months. While on leave, Joe happens upon Fanny Bridges, whom he remembers from their childhood, performing as a featured singer and dancer in a nightclub. He re-introduces himself to her, and they bond while witnessing a Zeppelin air raid on London from the rooftop. She later becomes the star of a theatrical production. Fanny and Joe fall in love and Joe, who miraculously manages to survive the next four years of the war despite all his fellow officers being killed in action, spends most of his leave time with her, unbeknownst to his parents. He finally proposes, but she hesitates to say yes due to the difference in their social classes, although she does love him. Just after armistice is announced in 1918, Ellen, who has found out about Fanny and Joe's love affair, goes to see Jane, reveals the affair to her, and demands that Joe marry Fanny when he returns. While a surprised and upset Jane is arguing with Ellen, Jane receives a telegram informing her that Joe has been killed in battle. Later, a grief-stricken Jane walks sadly through armistice celebrations in Trafalgar Square. Following the war, a montage shows daily life becoming even more chaotic and the social order being further disrupted, while some advocate that mankind work towards peace. The film ends on New Year's Day 1933, with Jane and Robert, now elderly, carrying on their tradition of celebrating the new year with a midnight toast to their past memories, as well as to the future.

Frank Borzage was originally going to direct, but he departed in June 1932 to work on another project. Fox production head Winfield Sheehan decided to use a British director due to the film's setting, and Frank Lloyd was brought on board. Production took place from early October to November 29, 1932. The film was one of the first to use the words \\"damn\\" and \\"hell\\", as in \\"Hell of a lot\\". These had been used in the play. There was concern at the Hays Office that this could set a precedent. Fox president Sidney Kent was quoted saying the mild profanity \\"could not offend any person; and, after all, that was the real purpose of the Code. And as far as the use creating a precedent which might be followed by other producers is concerned, the best answer would be that anyone who could make a picture as good as Cavalcade might be justified in following the precedent.\\" The film premiered in New York City on January 5, 1933, but did not go into general theatrical release until April 15. Soundtrack In addition to several original compositions by Coward, more than fifty popular songs, national anthems, hymns, ballads, and topical tunes relevant to the years portrayed were used in the film.

Cohan Reception Cavalcade was an instant commercial success, earning $1,004,000 in North American rentals, and $3.5 million in worldwide rentals. It made over US $1 million in the UK. It ended up making an estimated profit of ¬£2,500,000 during its initial theatrical release. Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times called the film \\"most affecting and impressive\\" and added, \\"In all its scenes there is a meticulous attention to detail, not only in the settings ... but also in the selection of players ... It is unfurled with such marked good taste and restraint that many an eye will be misty after witnessing this production.\\" The film currently holds a 59% approval rating on the film review aggregating website Rotten Tomatoes based on 24 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.34/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Though solidly acted and pleasant to look at, Cavalcade lacks cohesion, and sacrifices true emotion for mawkishness.\\" Awards and honors Cavalcade won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Frank Lloyd won the Academy Award for Best Director, and the Academy Award for Best Art Direction went to William S. Darling. Diana Wynyard was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress but lost to Katharine Hepburn for Morning Glory. Cavalcade was the first film produced by Fox Film Corporation to win the Best Picture Oscar, and the only one before it merged with 20th Century Pictures in 1935 to form 20th Century Fox. Preservation The Academy Film Archive preserved Cavalcade in 2002. Home video Cavalcade's first home video release was on a US VHS, in 1993. Cavalcade was initially released on DVD December 7, 2010, as the earliest entry in the 75-film, three-volume \\"Twentieth Century Fox 75th Anniversary Collection\\", a prestige set with an initial list price of nearly $500. With the DVD and Blu- ray releases of Wings on January 24, 2012, Cavalcade became the only Best Picture Oscar winner not available on a stand-alone DVD in Region 1. It was eventually released separately on a US Blu-ray/DVD set on August 6, 2013, after it received the most write-in votes in a Fox online poll. The film is also available for rental or purchase in HD on various US-restricted digital services. , these are the only official home video releases of Cavalcade anywhere, though several bootlegs are available, most notably a poor quality DVD and BD-R from Spain.

Shown is a two- dimensional slice through a primitive cubic crystal system showing the regular square array of atoms on one face (open circles, o), and with these, places where atoms are missing from a regular site to create vacancies, displaced to an adjacent acceptable space to create a Frenkel pair, or substituted by a smaller or larger atom not usually seen (closed circles, ‚Ä¢ ), in each case resulting in a material that is moved toward being measurably non- stoichiometric. Non-stoichiometric compounds are chemical compounds, almost always solid inorganic compounds, having elemental composition whose proportions cannot be represented by a ratio of small natural numbers; most often, in such materials, some small percentage of atoms are missing or too many atoms are packed into an otherwise perfect lattice work. Contrary to earlier definitions, modern understanding of non-stoichiometric compounds view them as homogeneous, and not mixtures of stoichiometric chemical compounds. Since the solids are overall electrically neutral, the defect is compensated by a change in the charge of other atoms in the solid, either by changing their oxidation state, or by replacing them with atoms of different elements with a different charge. Many metal oxides and sulfides have non- stoichiometric examples; for example, stoichiometric iron(II) oxide, which is rare, has the formula FeO, whereas the more common material is nonstoichiometric, with the formula Fe0.95O. The type of equilibrium defects in non-stoichiometric compounds can vary with attendant variation in bulk properties of the material. Non-stoichiometric compounds also exhibit special electrical or chemical properties because of the defects; for example, when atoms are missing, electrons can move through the solid more rapidly. Non- stoichiometric compounds have applications in ceramic and superconductive material and in electrochemical (i.e., battery) system designs. Occurrence=Iron oxides= Nonstoichiometry is pervasive for metal oxides, especially when the metal is not in its highest oxidation state.N. N. Greenwood & A. Earnshaw, 2012, \\"Chemistry of the Elements,\\" 2nd Edn., Amsterdam, NH, NLD:Elsevier, , see , accessed 8 July 2015. [Page numbers marked by superscript, inline.] For example, although w√ºstite (ferrous oxide) has an ideal (stoichiometric) formula FeO, the actual stoichiometry is closer to Fe0.95O. The non-stoichiometry reflect the ease of oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ effectively replacing a small portion of Fe2+ with two thirds their number of Fe3+. Thus for every three \\"missing\\" Fe2+ ions, the crystal contains two Fe3+ ions to balance the charge. The composition of a non-stoichiometric compound usually varies in a continuous manner over a narrow range. Thus, the formula for w√ºstite is written as Fe1‚àíxO, where x is a small number (0.05 in the previous example) representing the deviation from the \\"ideal\\" formula. Nonstoichiometry is especially important in solid, three-dimensional polymers that can tolerate mistakes. To some extent, entropy drives all solids to be non-stoichiometric. But for practical purposes, the term describes materials where the non-stoichiometry is measurable, usually at least 1% of the ideal composition. =Iron sulfides= Pyrrhotite, an example of a non- stoichiometric inorganic compound, with formula Fe1‚àíxS (x = 0 to 0.2). The monosulfides of the transition metals are often nonstoichiometric. Best known perhaps is nominally iron(II) sulfide (the mineral pyrrhotite) with a composition Fe1‚àíxS (x = 0 to 0.2). The rare stoichiometric FeS endmember is known as the mineral troilite. Pyrrhotite is remarkable in that it has numerous polytypes, i.e. crystalline forms differing in symmetry (monoclinic or hexagonal) and composition (Fe7S8, Fe9S10, Fe11S12 and others). These materials are always iron-deficient owing to the presence of lattice defects, namely iron vacancies. Despite those defects, the composition is usually expressed as a ratio of large numbers and the crystals symmetry is relatively high. This means the iron vacancies are not randomly scattered over the crystal, but form certain regular configurations. Those vacancies strongly affect the magnetic properties of pyrrhotite: the magnetism increases with the concentration of vacancies and is absent for the stoichiometric FeS. =Palladium hydrides= Palladium hydride is a nonstoichiometric material of the approximate composition PdHx (0.02 < x < 0.58). This solid conducts hydrogen by virtue of the mobility of the hydrogen atoms within the solid. =Tungsten oxides= It is sometimes difficult to determine if a material is non-stoichiometric or if the formula is best represented by large numbers. The oxides of tungsten illustrate this situation. Starting from the idealized material tungsten trioxide, one can generate a series of related materials that are slightly deficient in oxygen. These oxygen-deficient species can be described as WO3‚àíx, but in fact they are stoichiometric species with large unit cells with the formulas WnO3n‚àí2, where n = 20, 24, 25, 40. Thus, the last species can be described with the stoichiometric formula W40O118, whereas the non-stoichiometric description WO2.95 implies a more random distribution of oxide vacancies. =Other cases= At high temperatures (1000 ¬∞C), titanium sulfides present a series of non-stoichiometric compounds. The coordination polymer Prussian blue, nominally Fe7(CN)18 and their analogs are well known to form in non-stoichiometric proportions.Metal-Organic and Organic Molecular Magnets Royal Society of Chemistry, 2007, , The non-stoichiometric phases exhibit useful properties vis-√†-vis their ability to bind caesium and thallium ions. Applications=Oxidation catalysis= Many useful compounds are produced by the reactions of hydrocarbons with oxygen, a conversion that is catalyzed by metal oxides. The process operates via the transfer of \\"lattice\\" oxygen to the hydrocarbon substrate, a step that temporarily generates a vacancy (or defect). In a subsequent step, the missing oxygen is replenished by O2. Such catalysts rely on the ability of the metal oxide to form phases that are not stoichiometric.Atkins, P. W.; Overton, T. L.; Rourke, J. P.; Weller, M. T.; Armstrong, F. A., 2010, Shriver and Atkins' Inorganic Chemistry 5th Edn., pp. 65, 75, 99f, 268, 271, 277, 287, 356, 409, Oxford, OXF, GBR: Oxford University Press, , see , accessed 8 July 2015. An analogous sequence of events describes other kinds of atom-transfer reactions including hydrogenation and hydrodesulfurization catalysed by solid catalysts. These considerations also highlight the fact that stoichiometry is determined by the interior of crystals: the surfaces of crystals often do not follow the stoichiometry of the bulk. The complex structures on surfaces are described by the term \\"surface reconstruction\\". =Ion conduction= The migration of atoms within a solid is strongly influenced by the defects associated with non- stoichiometry. These defect sites provide pathways for atoms and ions to migrate through the otherwise dense ensemble of atoms that form the crystals. Oxygen sensors and solid state batteries are two applications that rely on oxide vacancies. One example is the CeO2-based sensor in automotive exhaust systems. At low partial pressures of O2, the sensor allows the introduction of increased air to effect more thorough combustion. =Superconductivity= Many superconductors are non-stoichiometric. For example, yttrium barium copper oxide, arguably the most notable high-temperature superconductor, is a non- stoichiometric solid with the formula YxBa2Cu3O7‚àíx. The critical temperature of the superconductor depends on the exact value of x. The stoichiometric species has x = 0, but this value can be as great as 1. History It was mainly through the work of Nikolai Semenovich Kurnakov and his students that Berthollet's opposition to Proust's law was shown to have merit for many solid compounds. Kurnakov divided non-stoichiometric compounds into berthollides and daltonides depending on whether their properties showed monotonic behavior with respect to composition or not. The term berthollide was accepted by IUPAC in 1960.The Rare Earth Trifluorides, Part 2 Arxius de les Seccions de Ci√®ncies , Institut d'Estudis Catalans, 2000, p75ff. , The names come from Claude Louis Berthollet and John Dalton, respectively, who in the 19th century advocated rival theories of the composition of substances. Although Dalton \\"won\\" for the most part, it was later recognized that the law of definite proportions had important exceptions. See also * F-Center * Vacancy defect ReferencesFurther reading * F.

He spent most of his academic career at the University of T√ºbingen, where he published work influenced by Lebensphilosophie and German Romanticism including The Spirit of Catholicism (1924), which argued for an understanding of the church as a community and for a revitalisation of Christian faith. Following Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933, Adam sought rapprochement between the Nazi regime and the German Catholic Church. In pursuit of this aim, he published work during the Nazi era that sought to reconcile aspects of Catholic and nationalist thought, defended Nazi anti-Jewish legislation and expressed anti- Semitic sentiments. His later work included The Christ of Faith (1954), a collection of lectures on Christology. Life and career=Early life and education= Karl Adam was born in , near Regensburg in the Upper Palatinate, Bavaria on 22 October 1876. He had a brother, August Adam, who would also become a priest and would later in life become a critic of the Nazi regime. Soon after being ordained a priest of the Diocese of Regensburg in 1900, he matriculated at the University of Munich, studying historical and systematic theology. He worked on the Latin Fathers in Munich and received his doctorate in 1904, submitting a thesis on the ecclesiology of Tertullian, and received his habilitation in 1908, completing a Habilitationsschrift on the Eucharistic theology of Augustine. In this period Adam's thought was influenced by Ignaz von Dollinger, Albert Ehrhard and Joseph Schnitzer. =Early career= Adam taught from 1908 until 1917 at the Wilhelmsgymnasium in Munich and was a tutor to the sons of Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria. In 1910 he published an article critical of Pius X's requirement that priests take the oath against modernism, which he described as \\"the official death notice regarding all Catholic scholarship\\" in Germany. This led to an investigation by the Holy Office, which ended when Crown Prince Rupprecht intervened on Adam's behalf. In 1917 he completed monographs on Pope Callixtus I's instruction on penance and on Augustine's account of forgiveness of sins. In the same year he began teaching at the University of Strasbourg, but was required to leave Strasbourg the following year due to a provision of the Treaty of Versailles which prohibited Germans from holding positions in the French civil service. He then moved to the University of T√ºbingen, where he took up a professorship in systematic theology. His work in the years from 1900 to 1918 focused on historical theology. From 1919 Adam's work dealt predominantly with systematic theology. In these years he advocated ecumenism and criticised structures and hierarchies in the church that he saw as outmoded. Upon taking the position at T√ºbingen in 1919 he publicly declared his intention to continue the tradition of the T√ºbingen school, which emphasised scholarly dialogue between Catholic and Protestant theologians. He would remain at T√ºbingen for three decades, where his work focused on the critique of the church, the critique of modernity, and the development of a contemporary theology. In this period he also drew on the tradition of Lebensphilosophie, a school of thought rooted in German Romanticism that emphasised the interconnectedness of life. This aspect of his work, along with his use of the German language rather than Latin and his emphasis on the humanity of Jesus, once again drew scrutiny from the Holy Office, and his book The Spirit of Catholicism (1924) was threatened with placement on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum in 1932. Eventually, however, he was informed that neither The Spirit of Catholicism nor Christ Our Brother (1927) or The Son of God (1933) would be condemned provided he made certain revisions to the texts, which he did in 1933. =Nazi era= Adam was one of several German Catholic theologians who sought rapprochement between the church and Nazi Germany after Adolf Hitler's rise to power. He saw his role as that of a mediator between the church and the Nazi regime, and envisioned a new relationship between the church and state in which the church would exert a greater influence as part of a corporatist or communitarian system. While other Catholic theologians at T√ºbingen did not publicly oppose the Nazi regime, Adam was unusual in publicly seeking to mediate between the church and the regime. Nonetheless, he never became a member of the Nazi Party. Early 1930s In his 1933 essay \\"German Nationality and Catholic Christianity\\" (\\"Deutsches Volkstum und katholisches Christentum\\") Adam argued that the German nation should be primarily the domain of Christians of German heritage, rather than being a pluralistic, secular society. The essay examined the relationship between Catholicism and the \\"German race\\" in terms of the relationship between nature and grace. Building on an argument made by Karl Eschweiler, Adam argued that Protestantism demands the separation of church and state because it sees nature and grace as opposed, whereas in Catholicism nature and grace are intertwined, and thus so must be the church and state. In this model the state would oversee the natural order while the church would have primacy in matters supernatural. The essay argued that the church is capable of observing \\"the blood-given determinations of a race or people\\", such that Catholicism takes different forms in different countries. Adam described the church as \\"the true mother of all ethnic-racial identity\\" and declared that nationalism and Catholicism could complement one another. In the same essay, Adam argued that Nazi anti-Jewish legislation was justified by Germans' obligation to strengthen their own racial identity, an obligation he argued originated in the Old Testament, and implicitly endorsed the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses and the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. Nonetheless, Adam also argued that Christians were obliged to treat Jews justly and lovingly, and that it was wrong to deny the Jewishness of Jesus. Whereas Adam's ecclesiological work in the 1920s had emphasised the universality of the church and its relationship to peoples' common humanity, in 1933 he began to see the unity between Christ and humans in the church as resting on racial and ethnic distinctions. He argued that the church could only flourish among a group of people to the extent that it took on the traits of those people, and that the German-speaking church must encourage the solidification of a German racial and ethnic identity. In a 1934 speech Adam criticised the Nazi state's support for the German Faith Movement, a neopagan religious movement that called for Germans to reject Christianity. Adam argued that the strength of the German nation depended on the continuing dominance of Christianity, and that the neopagans failed to acknowledge the positive influence of Christianity on German culture over the course of centuries. Immediately following the speech he was denounced in a Nazi newspaper and harassed by the Sturmabteilung. Days later his licence to teach was revoked and his courses cancelled. The following week he was reinstated, having pledged to no longer criticise national socialism. \\"The Spiritual Situation of German Catholicism\\" (1939) Adam re-entered the political sphere following the invasion of Poland in 1939. He delivered a lecture entitled \\"The Spiritual Situation of German Catholicism\\" (\\"Die geistige Lage des deutschen Katholizismus\\"), in which he proposed three ways to foster Christian faith in Germany that he thought would also strengthen the nation and contribute to the blending of Catholicism and German culture: that the church should permit priests to be conscripted into the Wehrmacht, that the church should permit the use of the German language in the Catholic Mass, and that the Pope should canonise more Germans. His aim was to encourage Catholicism to modernise by responding to the \\"positive\\" elements of Nazism, and to limit the influence of the German Faith Movement in order to prevent the disintegration of Christianity in the Nazi state. Without naming the German Faith Movement or any other neopagan group, he described \\"a new Weltanschauung, a non-Christian and anti-Christian faith movement\\" filling the vacuum left by Christianity's decline. The lecture pleased pro-Nazi Catholics while angering Catholic opponents of Nazism. Joseph Joos accused Adam of watering down Catholic doctrine and failing to emphasise the divergences between Catholicism and Nazism, while Bishop told Adam the lecture had harmed the church and ordered him to cease speaking publicly about the war. Bernhard Lichtenberg wrote to Adam upon reading the transcript of the lecture, accusing him of offering a \\"fatal vagueness\\" under the pretence of a clear delineation of the status of German Catholicism. Lichtenberg criticised Adam's argument that German Catholics ought to obey the Nazi authorities, argued that Adam accepted Nazi efforts to make Catholic doctrine secondary to other Weltanschauungen, and accused Adam of confusing the concept of Weltanschauung itself by treating it as solely a secular phenomenon then later using the term with regard to theological matters. He argued that Adam overlooked Nazism's anti-Christian and anti-Catholic themes, and objected to Adam's formulation of the concepts of original sin and \\"German nature\\". In concluding, Lichtenberg observed that the practical proposals Adam made had already, to a large extent, been implemented. Lichtenberg was later arrested, convicted of violating the Pulpit Law and the Treachery Act of 1934 and imprisoned, and died while being taken to the Dachau concentration camp. \\"Jesus, the Christ, and We Germans\\" (1943) In 1943 Adam wrote \\"Jesus, the Christ, and We Germans\\" (\\"Jesus, der Christus, und wir Deutsche\\"), which expressed anti- Semitic sentiments while defending Christianity from neopagan critiques. The essay argued that although Jesus was Jewish, he was not purely so, because he came from Galilee, a region where interracial marriage was common, and because the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary meant he lacked the \\"ugly dispositions and forces which we condemn in full blooded Jews.\\" The essay also reiterated the strong connection Adam perceived between the spirit of Christianity and that of Nazism. It was Adam's final effort to connect Catholicism and Nazism. Adam's reasons for accommodating Nazism Krieg has argued that Adam's pursuit of accommodation between the church and the Nazi government was due to his belief that the church should play a central and fundamental role in society and the state. Krieg also argues that Adam's political naivety was in large part the result of his dependence on the ideas and categories of German Romanticism, which led him to envision a national community in harmonious relation to the church, and thus to misjudge political realities and fail to realise the incompatibility of Nazi ideology with Christian faith. In addition to his Romanticism, Krieg argues that Adam's political stance was also informed by the view that Germany was threatened by modernity and the tendencies toward democracy, individualism, secularisation and a modern notion of freedom that promoted diversity. These tendencies, Adam thought, required new social and political formations that would restore order and encourage community, tradition and Christian faith. The theologian argued that Adam's \\"predilection for the 'vital' and 'organic'\\" and his rejection of rationalism and liberalism contributed to his willingness to accommodate Nazism. Robert Spicer argues that Adam's expression of common themes uniting Catholicism and Nazism can be seen as in keeping with the themes of T√ºbingen school theology. Whereas his precursors at T√ºbingen had attempted to situate Christianity within the culture of the day, the specific culture in which Adam operated was one influenced to a great extent by Nazi ideology. Spicer argues that, while Adam's overtures to Nazism were understandable in the early 1930s, by 1939, after Kristallnacht and the Nazis' persecution of the Catholic Church, they became incomprehensible. Spicer claims Adam \\"allowed himself to be so influenced by the National Socialist milieu that he could not properly discern between what he should accept and reject from the movement's ideology.\\" John Connelly argues that Adam saw Hitler as a figure capable of bridging the divide between German Catholics and Protestants, in keeping with his earlier support for ecumenism. =Post-war career and death= The University of T√ºbingen was occupied by the French Army in 1945 as part of the denazification process. Neither Adam nor any of T√ºbingen's other Catholic theologians were among those imprisoned or banned from teaching for promoting Nazism or the Nazi regime's human rights violations. No work was published in postwar Germany questioning or censuring Adam's support for Nazism. Krieg writes that \\"it is not clear ... that Adam ... ever acknowledged his own misjudgment about and complicity with the Third Reich.\\" In the postwar years Adam became involved in the ecumenical movement and stressed the need for co- operation between German Catholics and Protestants. As one of the first German Catholic theologians to contribute to ecumenism, he argued that Protestants and Catholics were united by belief in certain Christian truths, and was motivated in part by his continued belief that Christianity ought to form the foundation of German government and society. Adam retired in 1949, becoming a professor emeritus at T√ºbingen. He withdrew from public life in the 1950s, and was nominated to be part of a preparatory commission for the Second Vatican Council in 1959, but declined for health reasons. Adam died in T√ºbingen on 1 April 1966. Works Adam's best-known works include The Spirit of Catholicism (1924), The Son of God (1934), Christ Our Brother (1929) and The Christ of Faith (1954). Krieg names four central concepts in Adam's theology: first, the view of Christ as the sole mediator between God and creation and as the only figure to unite the divine and human worlds; second, the conception of the church as the Body of Christ, existing to make Christ present in the world; third, an account of Christianity as faith specifically within the context of the community of the church; and fourth, a pessimistic evaluation of Western civilisation, which he thought was experiencing a long decline. Adam's books were directed at the general reader, rather than appealing solely to theologians. =The Spirit of Catholicism (1924)= In The Spirit of Catholicism (1924) Adam critiqued rationalism, which he argued had distanced people from themselves, from their communities and from God; the Enlightenment, which he claimed prioritised intellect over feelings and relationships; and modernity itself. In mounting this critique he drew on the thought of Max Scheler. Arguing along similar lines to Joseph Lortz and Oswald Spengler, Adam diagnosed a centuries-long spiritual and cultural decline in Western civilisation, which he argued had begun in the Late Middle Ages and culminated in the Enlightenment. He argued this decline could be arrested, however, by a revitalisation of belief in Christ and the church. The account of the church in The Spirit of Catholicism differed from neo-scholastic conceptions of the church as an institution and from Protestant understandings of the church as an assembly of individuals. Adam rejected both the First Vatican Council's juridical account of the church and accounts such as that of Friedrich Heiler, who saw the church as \\"a complex of opposites\\" united by papal authority. In their place Adam drew on the work of Johann Adam M√∂hler in describing the church as first and foremost a community, and on Paul the Apostle's description of the church as the Body of Christ. The book also rejects Adolf von Harnack's emphasis on the historical Jesus, emphasising a kerygmatic Christology akin to that of Johannes von Kuhn. Karl Heim, a Protestant colleague of Adam's at T√ºbingen, responded to The Spirit of Catholicism with a series of lectures that were published under the title The Nature of Protestantism in 1925. George Orwell reviewed The Spirit of Catholicism in The New English Weekly in 1932. Orwell differentiated the book from works of \\"Catholic propaganda\\", which focus on the basis of Catholic faith and criticisms of its opponents; Orwell praised Adam, by contrast, for his focus on \\"what goes on inside the Catholic soul\\". The book's main significance for non-Catholics, Orwell argued, was as an example of the \\"Hebrew-like pride and exclusiveness of the Catholic mind\\". The Spirit of Catholicism has been translated into 13 languages, and was an influence on thinkers including Robert McAfee Brown, Dorothy Day, Thomas Merton, Flannery O'Connor, Alec Vidler, Evelyn Underhill and Pope Paul VI, who drew on it in his papal encyclical Ecclesiam suam. It was one of the most widely read works of German Catholic thought in the first part of the 20th century. Krieg has described The Spirit of Catholicism as \\"one of the most important studies in Catholic theology during the period between the First Vatican Council (1869‚Äì70) and the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì65).\\" =The Christ of Faith (1954)= The Christ of Faith (1954), a collection of lectures, is a comprehensive history of Christology and Adam's final major work. The lectures discuss the sources of Christology and recount the history of controversies in the field, then examine the doctrine of salvation. Here Adam defines Christology as the study of images of Christ, of which he identifies three: the \\"dogmatic image\\" found in doctrine, the \\"reflected image\\" found in the Bible, and the \\"living image\\", formed through the meeting of the other two images and the church. Juniper Cummings, reviewing the English translation of The Christ of Faith, declined to endorse the book \\"without reservation\\", noting that certain statements may lend themselves to misrepresentation, while others suffer from inexactitude, but noted that many of its apparent flaws may in fact be \\"legitimate differences of theological opinions\\", while others may stem from insufficient attention to updating the lectures when compiling them. Flannery O'Connor, in her review published in 1958, identified The Christ of Faith as containing an implicit argument against efforts to reconstruct Christianity as a syncretic religion, praised the book's critique of \\"the errors of liberal theology\\", and described it as \\"a master work by one of the Church's greatest living theologians.\\" =Other works= In the essay \\"Faith and the Scholarly Study of Faith in Catholicism\\" (\\"Glauben und Glaubenswissenschaft im Katholizismus\\", 1920) Adam developed an account of faith that differed from neo-scholastic and rationalist approaches, in which faith is essentially private, and argued that faith has a communal character, relating to encounters with Christ that occur in the church. In Christ Our Brother (1927) Adam focuses on the Gospels' accounts of Jesus' life and teachings and argues, again in opposition to neo-scholasticism, for the humanity of Christ: rather than seeing him as passive or weak, Adam describes Christ as embodying humanity's best qualities and achieving its fullest potential. In this reading the incarnation of Christ is seen as the central event in human history, and as representing the meeting of the human and divine not through the ascent of the former but rather through the descent of the latter. Christ and the Western Mind (1928) again drew on Scheler in critiquing modernity, rationalism and the Enlightenment. Here Adam described a process of secularisation, beginning in the Late Middle Ages and incorporating the Reformation and the Enlightenment. He argued again for the necessity of a return to Christ and the church, which would require a clear presentation of Christian doctrine. The Son of God (1933) similarly considers the Gospels' accounts of Jesus, and argues for Christ's humanity and the centrality of the incarnation of Christ. The Son of God was also influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche's Lebensphilosophie and was widely translated. One and Holy (1948), a collection of essays, expressed support for ecumenism. Evaluation Krieg describes Adam as both \\"one of the most creative theologians of the early twentieth century\\" and, due to his support for Nazism, \\"one of the most naive\\". Krieg argues that Adam played a significant role in the renewal of Catholic theology in the first half of the 20th century, but weakened Christian resistance to Hitler by stressing the perceived common ground uniting Nazism and Catholicism. Krieg identifies Adam's pessimistic evaluation of Western civilisation as the fatal flaw in his thought, which led him to seek accommodation with Nazism. Adam's theory of history, Krieg argues, was insufficiently complex and failed to consider the capacity of the church and tradition to adapt. Krieg argues that, although Adam anticipated insights of the Second Vatican Council in his account of Christ's humanity and the church as a community, he remained within the horizon of the First Vatican Council in his rejection of modern ideas of freedom. Krieg suggests that Adam's life and work provides a lesson in the impossibility of \\"turn[ing] back the clock in order to restore the relationship that existed between the Church and the state in an earlier epoch.\\" Adam's theology also provides a positive lesson, however, in Krieg's view, insofar as Adam in The Spirit of Catholicism acknowledged that the church would have to adapt to non-European cultures and to diversify. James Carroll described Adam as \\"perhaps the most notable Catholic theologian of his generation\\" and identified this eminence as the reason why Adam's position on Nazism is significant. Writing in Commonweal in 2008, John Connelly argued that Adam's engagement with Nazism indicates \\"the dangers of speculation, of making judgments about the fulfillment of God‚Äôs will in history.\\" Connelly also described Adam as \\"the rare theologian who made the presence of God seem tangible\\", identifying this as a reason why Adam ought not to be forgotten.

The commune neighbours »öinte»ôti to the north, Smeeni to the east, MihƒÉile≈üti to the south, Movila Banului to the southwest, and Coste»ôti to the west. History The name GherƒÉseni is connected to the name of Ioan (Emanuil) Gerassy, a Greek who had obtained a licence on the boyar monopoly of manufacturing alcoholic beverages in Bucharest during the rule of Alexandru II Ghica (1834-1842). He owned C√¢mpineanca, Sili»ôte and Rotunda estates, which he had bought in the late 1820s. Rotunda estate included a large village which featured an Orthodox church. Gerassy managed to convince the inhabitants of that village to move to the present-day location of GherƒÉseni, 1 km away from the Cremenea village. The first people to settle in the new location apparently arrived around 1829. The Gerassy family also built a new church and a school on the spot.

Architecture The site of Chiripa consists of a large mound platform that dominates the settlement. On the platform is a rectangular sunken plaza with a carved stone in the center of the plaza. (Plaza dimensions: 22 x 23.5 meters, 517 m2). Rituals occurred in specially prepared public places like the plaza suggesting the importance of rituals in the creation and maintenance of legitimacy and power. There are fourteen upper houses with thatched roofs and double walls of cobble and adobe, arranged in a trapezoid surrounding the sunken plaza. These were first identified by Bennet (1936 ). Each had decorative wall paintings, prepared yellow clay floors and between building wall bins, believed to be for ceremonial storage. Access to the plaza and upper houses was limited to two openings, each on the North and South side of complex. Access to individual upper houses was a single stone door. Access to wall bins was by single ornate window. Bennet (1936) excavated burials in the floors of one of the upper houses. Most of the stone-marked burials were children or infants. Adult burials were not usually marked. Gold, copper, shell, and lapis goods were found in many of the stone-marked infant/child graves. While these goods were only found in the one stone-marked adult grave. Adult skeletal remains were often found in bundles in parts of the site above ground. Variability in grave goods and structure of burials may suggest different statuses in society. Middle & Late Chiripa During the Early Horizon period, farmers maintained small gardens where quinoa and other plants grew and were harvested for consumption. Around 800 BCE, we find samples composed almost entirely of quinoa at Chiripa's social and political center, the Mont√≠culo (a type of mound) The Taraco Archaeological Project (TAP), directed by Dr. Christine Hastorf, is investigating the Early and Middle Formative occupation at Chiripa, 1500 BCE-100 CE TAP has subdivided this occupation into three phases: Early Chiripa (1500-1000 BCE), Middle Chiripa (1000-800 BCE), and Late Chiripa (800 BCE-100 CE), based on ceramic styles and architecture and agriculture. During the Middle Chiripa phase the population grew, and the village of Chiripa increased to 4.25 ha. The TAP excavations encountered no domestic architecture, but found one of the earliest examples of corporate architecture in the Lake Titicaca Basin: a huanca (semi- subterranean plaza/court), dating to 1000 BCE. The structure is trapezoidal and two meters deep with a white yellow clay floor and walls made of stone plastered with yellow clay. In Late Chiripa, from 800 BCE-100 CE, the Chiripa settlement grew to 7.7 ha and the inhabitants constructed new, more elaborate corporate structures. Early in the Late Chiripa phase, the structure \\"Choquehuanca\\" was no longer used and another sunken enclosure, \\"Llusco\\", was built in the southern portion of the site . Llusco was closed about 600 BCE, and construction of the site's most prominent feature, a 50-x-50-m platform mound called the Mont√≠culo, was begun. The Mont√≠culo was built in two phases. From 600-400 BCE, the Chiripa residents built a series of rectangular \\"Lower Houses\\", which were probably constructed around a small platform. The inhabitants closed the Lower House level around 400 BCE and began constructing the \\"Upper Houses,\\" which were modified and used until around 100 CE. The final monument included a semi-subterranean court and an open ring of permanent adobe and rock structures. The Mont√≠culo served as public ritual space where ancestors were revered and food was served, and possibly stored, for group events. Agriculture Quinoa Early and Middle Chiripa agricultural production is characterized by small-scale gardening where both quinoa and quinoa negra were grown and harvested. Quinoa negra is not domesticated and is a form of weed of the domesticated quinoa. Around 800 BCE, we find a drastic decrease in the frequency of quinoa negra seeds compared to quinoa seeds, signaling changes in crop management and use. In order to reduce the number of quinoa negra seeds in the yearly harvest, farmers may have begun creating formal fields for the crop, weeding, and practicing more careful seed selection. This shift in agricultural production coincides with the development of new ritual and political practices at Chiripa. The presence of large quantities of quinoa seeds at the Mont√≠culo suggests that this food played an important role in the activities at this location. Early potatoes dating to 800-500 BCE were uncovered at Chiripa.Erickson 1977: 6David R. Harris, Gordon C. Hillman, Foraging and Farming: The Evolution of Plant Exploitation. Routledge, 2014 p495 The place was first described by Padre Pedro Marabini in the 20th century.

The film was produced by Robert L. Lippert and directed by Ubaldo Ragona and Sidney Salkow, and stars Vincent Price and France Bettoia. The screenplay was written in part by Matheson, but he was dissatisfied with the result and chose to be credited as \\"Logan Swanson\\". William Leicester, Furio M. Monetti, and Ubaldo Ragona finished the script. The Last Man on Earth was filmed in Rome, with scenes being completed at Esposizione Universale Roma. It was released in the United States and the United Kingdom by American International Pictures. In the 1980s the film entered the public domain. MGM Home Video, the current owners of the AIP film catalog, released a digitally remastered widescreen print of the film on DVD in September 2005. Plot The Last Man on Earth It is 1968, and Dr. Robert Morgan (Vincent Price) lives in a world where everyone else has been infected by a plague that has turned them into undead, vampiric creatures that cannot stand sunlight, fear mirrors, and are repelled by garlic. They would kill Morgan if they could, but they are weak and unintelligent. Every day Morgan carries out the same routine: he wakes up, marks another day on the calendar, gathers his weapons, and then goes hunting for vampires, killing as many as he can and then burning the bodies to prevent them from coming back. At night, he locks himself inside his house. A flashback sequence explains that, three years earlier, Morgan's wife Virginia and daughter Kathy had succumbed to the plague before it was widely known by the public that the dead would return to life. Instead of taking his wife to the same public burn pit used to dispose of his daughter's corpse, Morgan buried her without the knowledge of the authorities. When his wife returned to his home and attacked him, Morgan became aware of the need to kill the plague victims with a wooden stake. Morgan hypothesizes that he is immune to the bacteria from a bite by an infected vampire bat when he was stationed in Panama, which may have introduced a diluted form of the plague into his blood. One day, a dog appears in the neighborhood. Desperate for companionship, Morgan chases after the dog but does not catch it. Sometime later the dog appears, wounded, at Morgan's doorstep. He takes the dog into his home and treats its wounds, looking forward to having company for the first time in three years. He quickly discovers, however, that it, too, has become infected with the plague. Morgan is seen burying the dog, which he has impaled with a wooden stake. Morgan sinks further into depression and loneliness. After burying the dog, Morgan spots a woman in the distance. The woman, Ruth, is terrified of Morgan at first sight and runs from him. Morgan convinces her to return to his home, but he is suspicious of her true nature. Ruth becomes ill when Morgan waves garlic in her face, who claims that she has a weak stomach. Morgan's suspicion that Ruth is infected is confirmed when he discovers her attempting to inject herself with a combination of blood and vaccine that holds the disease at bay. Ruth initially draws a gun on Morgan but ultimately surrenders it to him. She tells him that she is part of a group of people like her ‚Äî infected, but under treatment ‚Äî and was sent to spy on Morgan. The vaccine allows the people to function normally with the drug in the bloodstream, but once it wears off, the infection takes over the body again. Ruth explains that her people are planning to rebuild society as they destroy the remaining humans, and that many of the vampires Morgan killed were still alive. Ruth desperately urges Morgan to flee, but he inexplicably refuses. While Ruth is asleep, Morgan transfuses his own blood into her. She is immediately cured, and Morgan sees hope that, together, they can cure the rest of her people. Moments later, however, Ruth's people attack. Morgan takes the gun and flees his home while the attackers kill the vampires gathered around Morgan's home. Ruth's people spot Morgan and chase him. He exchanges gunfire with them and picks up tear gas grenades from a police station armory along the way. While the tear gas delays his pursuers somewhat, Morgan is wounded by gunfire and retreats into a church. Despite Ruth's protests to let Morgan live, his pursuers finally impale him on the altar with a spear. In his final moments, Morgan denounces his pursuers as \\"freaks\\" and, as Ruth cradles him, declares that he is the last true man on Earth.

Production=Development= Producer Anthony Hinds purchased the rights to Matheson's novel for Hammer Film Productions. Matheson wrote a script, and Hammer announced in 1958 that they would make it. However, British censors would not allow the film to be produced, so Hinds resold the script to American producer Robert L. Lippert. Lippert had wanted to make a \\"last man on Earth\\" type film for a while. In the late 1950s Charles Marquis Warren and Robert Stabler optioned a novel by science fiction writer George R. Stewart called Earth Abides. Harry Spalding, who worked for Lippert, said the release of The World, the Flesh and the Devil (1959) killed off plans for that project. Spalding then read Matheson's novel and suggested Lippert film that book instead. The project was announced in August 1962. Lippert originally told Matheson that Fritz Lang would direct the film, and Matheson thought that would be \\"wonderful\\". Eventually, however, Sidney Salkow was chosen to direct. Matheson made the follow-up comment: \\"Well, there's a bit of a drop.\\" =Shooting= To save money, the film was shot in Italy with a predominantly Italian cast and crew. Matheson later said the film was the most faithful adaptation of his book, but he also called the result \\"inept\\" and used a pen name for his screenplay. (He later said he thought Harrison Ford as star and George Miller as director would have been the ideal creative combination\\".) Differences from the novel There are several differences between the film and the novel I Am Legend from which it is based: *The protagonist of the novel is named Robert Neville, not Robert Morgan. *The protagonist's profession is changed from a plant worker to scientist. *The vampires are almost zombie-like, whereas in the novel, they are fast and capable of running and climbing. *The dog that shows up on Neville's doorstep in the novel is timid and comes and goes as it pleases, in contrast to the dog in the film. *In the novel the relationship with Ruth differs slightly, in that no transfusion takes place; a cure seems implausible, even as Neville hopes he will find one; and Ruth escapes after Neville discovers that she is infected. *Neville is not captured in the novel until many months later; even then he barely fights back. *The novel ends shortly before Neville is to be executed; Ruth returns to give him suicide pills and finds it ironic that he has become as much of a legend to the new society as vampires once were to Neville's world (hence the title). *The novel implies that the vampire plague resulted from a biological disease; the origin of the disease is never explained in The Last Man on Earth (and is altered in the subsequent adaptations). Release Although the film was not considered a success upon its release, it later gained a more favorable reputation as a classic of the genre. As of August 2020, The Last Man on Earth holds a 80% rating at the film review aggregator Web site Rotten Tomatoes. Phil Hall of Film Threat called The Last Man on Earth \\"the best Vincent Price movie ever made\\". Among the less favorable reviews, Steve Biodrowski of Cinefantastique felt the film was \\"hampered by an obviously low budget and some poorly recorded, post-production dubbing that creates an amateurish feel, undermining the power of its story\\", while Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader remarked, \\"Some would consider this version better than the 1971 remake with Charlton Heston, The Omega Man, but that isn't much of an achievement\\". Among the film's creators, Price \\"had a certain fondness for the film\\" and felt it was better than The Omega Man. Richard Matheson co-wrote the film's screenplay, but was unhappy with the results. To keep receiving residual income from the film, though, he had to be credited, so he used the name \\"Logan Swanson\\", a combination of his wife's mother's maiden name and his mother's maiden name. Matheson said: \\"I was disappointed in the film, even though they more or less followed my story. I think Vincent Price, whom I love in every one of his pictures that I wrote, was miscast. I also felt the direction was kind of poor. I just didn‚Äôt care for it\\".

Biography  Isabella Santacroce was born and lives in Riccione. Her literary startup began in the 1990s with her debut novel Fluo, the first book of the trilogy \\"Trilogia dello spavento\\" (trilogy of the frightened) (the other two are Destroy and Luminal). Destroy in particular is of interest in Italy, described by Alessandro Baricco as a \\"book to read, if Enrico Brizzi is talented, there is double talent in the book IntercoM Science Fiction Station - Isabella Santacroce - Intervista all'Autrice\\". Santacroce was grouped together with the Giovani Cannibali, (young Cannibals) a literary movement developed at the end of the Nineties (representative of that is the volume Giovent√π Cannibale (young cannibals) published by Einaudi), formed by Italian young writers. Among them, Tiziano Scarpa, Aldo Nove, Niccol√≤ Ammaniti, Enrico Brizzi, Tommaso Labranca, Tommaso Ottonieri, Luca Ragagnin and others together with Santacroce, give birth in 1997 to a philosophical-literally movement called, il Nevroromanticismo, (the neuralromanticism) which means to express the unquiteness of existence. In November 1998 Polo Books published Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love. Canzoni maledette, a collection of her translations of the most representative texts and songs regarding the rock band Nirvana and Hole. Her book Luminal, about two young prostitutes on the run from their pimp, was adapted into an award-winning movie directed by Andrea Vecchiato, starring Denis Lavant, and scored by Michael Nyman After the end of the Trilogy of Frighten, Isabella Santacroce continued to work on the language remaining faithful to her own themes. In 2001 she published for Mondadori Lovers. The theme of this book is Love in its various forms: Love of family, love between man and woman, Homosexual love, and unrequited love which inexorably leads to death. The language adopted in the book tries to get as close as possible to writing made of sounds, named by the author a writing for pure feeling. In 1999 started her collaboration with the Italian singer Gianna Nannini, which produced the album Aria in 2002, the cartoon Momo alla conquista del tempo, where the writer collaborated for texts. She helped with the writing of lyrics for the other Gianna Nannini's CD ‚ÄúGrazie‚Äù (Thanks), published in 2006. In January 2004 Revolver, dedicated to Andrea Vecchiato, was published, an intense and violent romance, in which the writer talks about the history of a love not returned between the protagonist Angelica and a thirteen-year-old boy. In this book and in the next one Zoo published in February 2006, Santacroce tries to make the obscures zones of existence come outside into the light, she tells what we usually try to hide. Family is described as an ‚Äúhorrible carnival‚Äù, which deserves to be destroyed. 2007 is the year of \\"V.M.18\\", romance in which she talks about the totally unruled lives of three 14-year-old girls in a college, this book signs the next change in the narrative style of Santacroce, defined by critics \\"seventeenhundreds\\".Da La Repubblica, 3 February 2007 Intervista a Coolclub Intervista a Girodivite Works * Fluo.

Olson and Randall S. Ingermanson. Plot introduction The first crewed ship to fly to Mars suffers damage from an in-space explosion, which severely limits the crew's oxygen supply, forcing them to make some hard, lifeboat-like choices to stay alive. =Explanation of the novel's title= Oxygen is a vital element for life‚Äîand one that the accident to the characters places in perilously short supply. Plot summary=Beginning= As the novel begins, Dr. Valerie (\\"Valkerie\\") Jansen is on a field trip on the slope of Mount Trident on the Alaska Peninsula. In real life, this volcano has not erupted for many years‚Äîbut in the novel, Mount Trident vents sulfur dioxide into the air, and this gas settles into the valley where Valkerie is encamped. She barely survives the experience, at one point taking the air from the tires of her Jeep, which is the only air available for her to breathe. The next morning, the Chief Administrator of NASA, together with one of NASA's senior physicians, lands on the slope of Mount Trident in a helicopter. They are looking for Valkerie, because they wish to interview her for a position as an Astronaut Candidate. The conversation that follows is very confusing to both sides, chiefly because Valkerie is convinced that Mount Trident is about to erupt and all three must evacuate at once. Eventually, however, Valkerie climbs aboard the helicopter with the two NASA officials. Eventually she is summoned to Houston, Texas, and reports for training at NASA's headquarters complex. A hot dispute between the NASA Administrator and Nate Harrington, the Mars Mission Director, results in her beginning a training regimen that is more grueling than usual, leading her to believe that Harrington wants her dropped from the program on any pretext he can invent. But in fact the NASA brass are very much impressed with her academic record and her seemingly unique ability to cope with \\"five-sigma\\" days‚Äîdays remarkable for a series of dire, often life-threatening crises. (Her breathing the air in her Jeep tires to survive the fumarolic venting incident is a case in point.) As for Mr. Harrington, he has never wanted anything more than to have the NASA administrator respect his prerogatives as Mars Mission Director‚Äîand furthermore, he is distracted by a series of events that have nothing to do with Valkerie or her candidacy. Nate's distractions include: a serious budget problem that has forced NASA to sell exclusive broadcast rights to a major television network, a clear threat from a prominent US Senator that he \\"has the votes\\" to terminate NASA's flagship program, a compromise of project security that darkly suggests a terrorist plot against NASA (and requires him to have an FBI agent as a semi-regular on the NASA campus)and a controversy involving the crew selection for Ares 10, which is to be the first crewed mission to Mars. NASA's psychiatrists have abruptly demanded interviews with all members of the Ares 10 crew‚ÄîJosh Bennett, Kennedy Hampton, Alexis \\"Lex\\" Ohta, and Bob \\"Kaggo\\" Kaganovski. Bob in particular fears that the psychiatrists want to remove him from the crew‚Äîbecause he has never felt entirely secure in his position, mainly because he does not have the devil- may-care abandon that is part of the \\"astronaut stereotype\\" and which Kennedy displays in overabundance. So when the psychiatrists call him in for an interview, he tells them that he would gladly obey any order given him by Josh, the assigned mission commander‚Äînot mentioning that he always reserves the right to act as he sees fit if he thinks that Josh, or any other commander, has issued a wrong order. But the psychiatrists are not suspicious of Bob at all, but rather of Josh. Specifically, their protocols inform them that having one man, even the mission commander, dominate the crew is a recipe for disaster. Bob's interview, added to an earlier interview given by Kennedy, only add to their disquiet. During their deliberations, they then run a computer-based decision-analytic model on two possible crew complements‚Äîone including Josh, and the other removing Josh as mission commander and assigning Valkerie Jansen to the flight. To everyone's surprise, a crew complement that includes Valkerie scores very high on their decision-analytic indices. Thus the psychiatrists issue their final \\"recommendation,\\" which carries the force of an order: Josh Bennett is to be dropped from the crew, Kennedy Hampton is to be promoted to mission commander, and the crew will gain a new mission specialist: Valkerie Jansen. Valkerie feels doubly guilty about accepting the assignment. First, she sees herself as usurping the place of another, more experienced astronaut (Josh). Second, she is afraid that a prior association will return to haunt her‚Äîspecifically, her relationship with a fellow student at Yale University who killed himself in a laboratory explosion he had caused because of his notion of Christian duty. (This bombing incident took place during the heyday of Operation Rescue‚Äîand furthermore, the presence of a religious-motivated picket line at NASA's main gate only adds to her apprehensions about having her Christian associations revealed.) Josh is ignorant of her fears concerning her Christian associations, but recognizes that she might feel guilty over supplanting him. So he takes her on a training flight to the Kennedy Space Center and there tells her that her primary duty is to Project Ares, which will shut down completely if she does not accept the assignment. He gallantly offers to take personal responsibility for her remaining training. With this assurance, she returns to Houston and tells Nate Harrington that she will accept the assignment. =Launchand Disaster= In January 2014, Ares 10 launches into space. The launch is very violent, because the mission controllers decide to launch in the face of a crosswind that exceeds NASA's stated limits. This causes damage to multiple habitat systems, including the telemetry bus, the Ku-band antenna, and a solar panel. Valkerie develops serious doubts about continuing the mission, especially when she catches Kennedy in a lie about a chemical fluid spill (he says that he spilled juice from a snack container, but Valkerie knows better) and then appears to threaten her with the non-regulation acetylene blowtorch he has brought aboard. Bob is actually no more eager to continue than Valkerie. But Kennedy insists on continuing the mission and browbeats his crew into telling Houston that they are all agreed. Subsequently, they perform trans-Martian injection, thus committing themselves. Three months later, they have repaired their data telemetry bus, and Kennedy and Bob perform an EVA to repair the Ku-band antenna, a repair that would have been pointless before. After completing the repair, they proceed to inspect the dual solar panels to see whether they can repair the damaged panel. Bob discovers some stray exposed wires that do not appear on anyone's schematics of the habitat. He proceeds to test them with a multimeter‚Äîand by a fateful error, sets the multimeter to measure resistance rather than electromotive potential (\\"voltage\\"). As a result, he inadvertently bridges a circuit between the wires‚Äîand thus causes an explosion. Someone has, quite simply, planted a bomb on board, and Bob has triggered it. The explosion blows away the otherwise intact solar panel, compromises the hull, and dazes Bob and fills his arm with what turns out to be stainless-steel shrapnel‚Äîa detail whose full significance the astronauts will realize only much later. Valkerie, standing by in the EVA suit room, immediately suits up, places the unconscious Lex Ohta into a rescue bubble, hastily repairs the hull breach, and releases the remaining oxygen from the fuel-cell tanks. Only then can she open the airlock to admit Kennedy, who at first insists that Bob is dead. Valkerie, believing that Kennedy acted carelessly, goes outside to fetch him in. Presently Bob recovers enough to discover that Valkerie's repair was incomplete, and simply asks her to help him make a more complete repair. But as a result of the original hull breach and Valkerie's incomplete repair efforts, the crew no longer has enough oxygen on board to survive the transit to Mars. Neither will they have sufficient power for all ship's systems from the remaining solar panel when they reach Mars. When NASA‚Äîrepresented by a very shaken Josh Bennett as CapCom‚Äîfails to inform them of this fact in a timely fashion, the astronauts bleakly conclude that they can no longer trust NASA. =A life-or-death choice= Josh Bennett refuses to give up on the crew. He remembers that an Earth Return Vehicle is on its way to Mars at the same time, and proposes to accelerate it to intercept Ares 10, so that the crew can use it as a lifeboat. Engineer Cathe Willison computes a solution for the intercept‚Äîbut then points out that the oxygen will only last if two of the crew sacrifice themselves. Valkerie, however, proposes another solution: observing that Lex, who is still in a coma, is consuming less oxygen, she proposes that two other astronauts go into drug-induced comas, with one astronaut remaining awake to accomplish the rendezvous and then reawaken the rest of the crew. NASA's doctors conclude that Valkerie could in fact synthesize enough sodium pentathol to accomplish this plan. But this raises the question of which astronaut will remain awake. That question is more than academic‚Äîbecause a review of surveillance tapes made inside the habitat prior to launch identifies six people only who could have planted the bomb‚Äîthe four members of the crew, Josh Bennett, and Nate Harrington. No one suspects Nate or Josh (not yet), and so the astronauts suspect one another‚Äîand furthermore, Kennedy is deliberately manipulating his crewmates' emotions, even to the point of crudely demanding sexual favors from Valkerie (which she refuses to grant). Two further items of evidence eventually decide the issue in Valkerie's favor. One, Josh Bennett discovers that Kennedy in fact manipulated NASA's psychiatric brass in order to have Josh removed from the crew. Two, a computer simulation predicts that if Bob is the one to stay awake, he'll use up all the oxygen. Bob, ever reserving his right to act at discretion, secretly prepares a dose of sodium pentathol to use on Valkerie after she has sedated Kennedy. But at the last minute, Valkerie tells him that she forgives him for not trusting her. He cannot bring himself to rebel against Valkerie, and so allows her to sedate him. =Another disasterand eventual landing= Valkerie now faces a problem with which she almost cannot cope: total isolation, with no one to converse with‚Äînot even Houston, because she must power down the radio to conserve energy. She spends most of the time in prayer, but mostly crying out to God to \\"send her an e-mail\\" and give her a reason to believe. As the ERV continues its approach, Valkerie asks for and receives permission to revive Bob so that he can help her pilot the habitat to a rendezvous with the ERV. Unhappily, the ERV is approaching far too fast. Valkerie's attempt to match velocity with it ends in failure, and worse‚Äîshe uses up more fuel than they can spare. With the ERV speeding past the habitat, Bob and Valkerie suddenly remember that the ERV carries a crew re-entry vehicle with its own engine. They issue orders to detach it from the ERV and bring it to a slow rendezvous‚Äîand then Valkerie makes another spacewalk to cut loose its oxygen tank and bring it aboard. Bob, in turn, receives instructions to build a Sabatier scrubber‚Äîan ultra-low-power device for removing carbon dioxide from the ship's air. They then reawaken Kennedy, who must regain his strength to perform the landing‚Äîand then decide that the only way they can land is to abandon the original mission profile calling for a Martian orbital capture, and instead dive straight down to the Martian surface. This is an incredibly risky maneuver, one which they almost do not complete because they are about to use an aerobrake deployment system that is non-functional. (Another failure of trust is responsible for this predicament, which they avoid only by some last-minute deduction of NASA's true intentions.) They intend to land in a camp that previous missions have already established‚Äîbut they end up landing too far away. However, they manage to pool their remaining oxygen to give to Bob and Kennedy, so that they can retrieve a pressurized powered rover to rescue Valkerie and Lex. When the men return, they find the women unconscious and seemingly dead‚Äîbut Valkerie has found Bob's hidden dose of sodium pentathol and uses that to put her and Lex into a coma once again‚Äîso that they survive, but Valkerie suffers multiple rib fractures when Bob attempts cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Finally, the astronauts realize the significance of the stainless-steel shrapnel with which Bob had been wounded in the initial explosion. None of the ship's systems was made of stainless steel‚Äîin fact, the lack of any material but plastic was a source of great frustration to Valkerie when she first attempted to seal the hull breach. Valkerie and Lex realize that the stainless steel must have come from a bacterial culture vial that Josh Bennett had received from a former girlfriend in Antarctica‚Äîand that the vial contained a radiation-resistant bacterium, the same one that in fact had contaminated some of the ship's systems after the explosion. Now the astronauts realize what has happened to them: Josh Bennett, fearing cancellation of Project Ares and the disbanding of NASA, sought to \\"seed\\" a radio-resistant bacterium on Mars for the astronauts to \\"discover.\\" To accomplish this, he did plant a bomb on board, designed to detonate with the deployment of the aerobrakes. But the damage to the habitat on the rocky launch ultimately caused the bomb to detonate in transit. This also explains Josh's brittle emotional state‚Äîhe realizes that his attempt to give the astronauts something to discover very nearly killed them instead. Bob ultimately tells Josh that Valkerie has figured it out, and that they all forgive him for what he did, knowing as they do that he never meant them any harm. The last scene is a set-up for the sequel: Bob, who is now enamored of Valkerie, proposes marriage to her before a worldwide six-billion-strong television audience that has tuned into watch \\"the first two astronauts to walk on Mars.\\" Characters in Oxygen *Astronaut Joshua \\"Josh\\" Bennett, original Mission Commander, afterwards CapCom. *Astronaut Kennedy \\"The Hampster\\" Hampton, original Pilot Officer, afterwards Mission Commander. *Astronaut Alexis \\"Lex\\" Ohta, original Mission Specialist (Geology), afterwards Pilot Officer. *Astronaut Bob \\"Kaggo\\" Kaganovski, Mission Specialist (Engineering) *Astronaut Candidate Valerie \\"Valkerie\\" Jansen, eventual Mission Specialist (Life Sciences and Crew Medicine) *Nathan \\"Nate\\" Harrington, Mars Mission Director *Steven Perez, Chief Administrator, NASA *Robert Abrams, MD, senior psychiatrist, NASA *Special Agent Crystal Yamaguchi, FBI *Cathe Willison, engineer Major themes Space exploration, the importance of friendship, the power of prayer and faith, the Providential nature of God, and how sometimes humans fail to hear the voice of God because \\"He won't send an e-mail.\\" Allusions/references to other works The book contains scattered allusions to Star Trek, and more specifically to which characters in that 1960's television series are most analogous to various positions on a Mars crew. The narrative also contains an allusion to The Right Stuff, by describing Astronaut Kennedy Hampton as being an astronaut in the \\"fighter jock\\" mold‚Äîaddicted to flying as a physical sport, given to moderately heavy social drinking, sometimes given to driving while intoxicated, and accepting questionable attentions from female hangers-on, also known as groupies. (Note: this novel is devoid of any sexual content beyond Astronaut Hampton crudely soliciting a sexual bribe from Astronaut Jansen, who indignantly refuses.) Allusions/references to actual history, current science, and popular culture Oxygen makes repeated and obvious references to the near-disastrous Apollo 13 mission. The Mars Habitat Unit, the Earth Return Vehicle, the Ares Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle, and various other pieces of equipment are all products of the active research program of Mars Society under the directorship of Doctor Robert Zubrin. The mission profile is an adaptation of NASA's own Mars Design Reference Mission profile, which itself derives from the Mars Society's own Mars Semi-Direct Mission profile. The following real-life institutions and events bear direct reference in Oxygen: the United States Senate, NBC, and the National Football League (and its premier event, the Super Bowl). Specifically: * A US Senator threatens to terminate Project Ares and even NASA itself. * NASA commits with NBC to launch Ares 10 the day before the Super Bowl, on a transit timed to have it land on Mars on Independence Day. This is not an optimal launch profile, and as such it is a source of tremendous frustration and consternation on the part of everyone involved, not least the crew. Literary significance & criticism Oxygen is one of few novels to propose that astronauts might not be the unblemished heroes of the popular legend that has grown about them. This legend dates back to Projects Apollo, Gemini, and especially Mercury. Though the author Tom Wolfe (The Right Stuff) has definitively revealed that the Mercury astronauts were not unblemished heroes (with the possible exception of John Glenn), the notion of an astronaut deliberately manipulating his administrative superiors to influence a flight assignment, and another astronaut resorting to planting a \\"discoverable scientific find\\" in order to ensure continuance of his country's space program, might have proved difficult for readers to accept. The jarring portrait of NASA's finest might serve as one possible explanation for the lack of continued interest in this title. However, Christian critics have consistently praised the work, perhaps because it unabashedly demonstrates that no human beings deserve placement on any sort of pedestal, and that all human beings are quite capable of making mistakes, often disastrous ones, even with the best of intentions. By far, however, the greatest significance of works like this is that they seek to bridge the gap between faith on one side, and pure and applied science on the other. Oxygen forthrightly addresses certain areas of science that might appear to test the Christian faith quite sorely‚Äîamong them the very possibility of finding living organisms on a world other than earth. Regrettably, Oxygen does not offer any explanation that might reconcile the disparate concepts of life on worlds beyond earth, and God having created life on earth and only on earth. One possible explanation might be that Mars harbors living organisms carried to it in the event that caused the Noachic Flood. (See especially the article on Hydroplates.) But neither this novel nor its sequel discuss that possibility at all‚Äîpossibly because the theory remains controversial. Instead, they offer an assurance that the Christian faith is strong enough to stand any test, including a scientific finding that might on the surface appear to contradict Scripture. (In fact, Scripture is silent on the nature of the planets, and indeed on all celestial bodies, except the sun, moon, and stars.) =Awards and nominations= Oxygen won the 2002 Christy Award for the best futuristic Christian novel in its year of release. Allusions/references from other works The Fifth Man, in which most of the above-listed characters reappear, is a sequel to this novel.

It is based on an article written about the Wiley College debate team by Tony Scherman for the spring 1997 issue of American Legacy. The film co-stars Forest Whitaker, Denzel Whitaker (no relation), Kimberly Elise, Nate Parker, Gina Ravera, Jermaine Williams and Jurnee Smollett. The screenplay is written by Robert Eisele, with story by Robert Eisele and Jeffrey Porro. The film was released in theaters on December 25, 2007. Plot Based on a true story, the plot revolves around the efforts of debate coach Melvin B. Tolson (Denzel Washington) at Wiley College, a historically black college related to the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (now The United Methodist Church), to place his team on equal footing with whites in the American South during the 1930s, when Jim Crow laws were common and lynch mobs were a fear for blacks. The fictional Wiley team eventually succeeds to the point where they are able to debate Harvard University. The movie explores social constructs in Texas during the Great Depression, from day-to-day insults African Americans endured to lynching. Also depicted is James L. Farmer, Jr. (Denzel Whitaker), who, at 14 years old, was on Wiley's debate team after completing high school (and who later went on to co-found the Congress of Racial Equality). Another character on the team, Samantha Booke, is based on the real individual Henrietta Bell Wells, acclaimed poet and the only female member of the 1930 Wiley team who participated in the first collegiate interracial debate in the US. The key line of dialogue, used several times, is a famous paraphrase of theologian St. Augustine of Hippo: \\"An unjust law is no law at all.\\" Another major line, repeated in slightly different versions according to context, concerns doing what you \\"have to do\\" in order that we \\"can do\\" what we \\"want to do.\\" In all instances, these vital lines are spoken by the James L. Farmer Sr. and James L. Farmer, Jr. characters.  Historical notes  The film depicts the Wiley Debate team beating Harvard College in the 1930s. The real Wiley team instead defeated the University of Southern California, who at the time were the reigning debating champions. Though they beat the reigning champions, Wiley was not allowed to officially call themselves victors, because they were not full members of the debate society; blacks were not admitted until after World War II.\\"For Struggling Black College, Hopes of a Revival.\\" The New York Times, December 5, 2007.

About the museum Miami Children's Museum logo Miami Children's Museum during the day Founded in 1983, the museum opened its current building on Watson Island to the public on September 7, 2003. The museum was originally titled the \\"Miami Youth Museum\\" and was originally located in two shopping malls, the Bakery Center in South Miami, and then relocated to the Miracle Center in Coral Gables. The facility, designed by Arquitectonica, includes 14 permanent galleries, pre-school classrooms, parent/teacher resource center, Kid Smart educational gift shop, 200-seat auditorium and Subway restaurant. The museum offers hundreds of bilingual, interactive exhibits; programs and classes and learning materials related to arts, culture, community and communication. Location In September 2003, after 12 years of planning, the Museum opened its new $25 million home on Watson Island near Downtown Miami. Over the past twenty years, they have relocated and expanded their space several times in response to public involvement. In the mid-1990s, planning was initiated among community leaders for the construction of its own stand-alone building. Miami Children‚Äôs Museum was established in 1983 as the Miami Youth Museum. Our first home was a 2,000 square foot facility located in a shopping center in West Kendall. Key Events in the Museum's History 1983 Miami Youth Museum was founded by forward thinking community leaders. 1985 The 2,000 square-foot Miami Youth Museum opens in a mall on Sunset Drive. Visitorship is 9,301. 1986 The Museum moves to a 4,000 square-foot facility in South Miami‚Äôs Bakery Centre. Visitorship is 10,525. 1987 Visitorship climbs to 18,871. The museum institutes its Community Outreach Program, which reaches 137,100 people. 1988 The museum increases its exhibition space by 2,000 square feet and visitorship grows to 26,165. Community outreach is expanded. 1990 The museum enlarges again, by 3,000 square feet and visitorship grows to 35,929. Community outreach serves 899,000 people. 1991 The museum reaches visitor capacity of 47,686, where it remains for five years and the museum receives its first State of Florida Cultural Facilities grant. 1992 The museum‚Äôs board plans to build a new facility. A capital campaign is initiated with a $1 million lead gift. The museum receives a prestigious Institute of Museum and Library Services grant. 1994 The museum receives additional State of Florida Cultural Facilities grants, now totaling nearly $2 million and the capital campaign continues to grow. 1996 Pending demolition of the Bakery Center forces the museum to move temporarily to the Miracle Center as fund raising and planning for the new facility continues. 1996 A careful search and a partnership with Miami Dade County lead the museum‚Äôs board to secure a site at the Vizcaya Metro-Rail Station. 1997 The Miami Youth Museum changes its name to Miami Children‚Äôs Museum to distinguish it from its precursor and clarify its scope. 2000 Neighborhood opposition and the threat of protracted litigation caused the Board of Directors of Miami Children‚Äôs Museum to seek a new site for the building of its community treasure. A Leadership Committee to identify a new site was born, chaired by Alan Potamkin and Norman Braman, which raised $8.2 million by the end of 2000. 2001 The plans to build Miami Children‚Äôs Museum on a magnificent waterfront site on Watson Island were finalized. 2002 The State of Florida awarded $500,000 to the museum, bringing funding from the State to $2.4 million. The campaign achieved over 90% of the goal, $16.1 million in the first six months of the year. 2003 The Miami Children‚Äôs Museum (MCM) opened in a new 56,500 square foot facility on Watson Island, near Downtown Miami. 2005 MCM received a grant of $500,000 from the State of Florida Division of Cultural Affairs to support the build-out of our Charter School area, adding a total of 10 new classrooms to our facilities. 2006 In order to accommodate educational classroom programs, the build-out of the facility was completed, adding 10 educational classrooms. 2014 The Museum records more than 430,000 visitors through its doors annually with its services now including one of the best pre-schools in Miami, a Charter School, various classes and seasonal camps.

It was eventually reassembled at 16711 West Dixie Highway, North Miami Beach, Florida, where it is now an Episcopal church and tourist attraction called Ancient Spanish Monastery.  History from 1133‚Äì1926  The Cistercian monastery was constructed during the years 1133‚Äì1141. It was originally named \\"Monastery of Our Lady, Queen of the Angels\\", or the \\"Royal Monastery of Saint Mary\\" (Spanish: Santa Mar√≠a la Real), but it was renamed to honor Bernard of Clairvaux upon his canonization. Use of the building as a Cistercian monastery lasted for almost 700 years until it was seized and sold off to be used as a granary and a stable during a period of social unrest in the 1830s. It was located in an area known as Coto de San Bernardo (St. Bernard land preserve), two miles from Sacramenia in the province of Segovia (Spain). The Monasterio was in a mountain region at 830 m above sea level, on a high plateau near the Sierra de Guadarrama, the region is known for extreme weather. The area has medieval churches, chapels, monasteries, walls, castles, within the natural landscape of the Durat√≥n River Gorges. The traditional access to the monastery was an ancient path with the masonry ruins of a watermill. The monastery was constructed with necessary defensive strength among a web of minor fortresses in an area heavily populated by Muslims. The monastery was founded by Alfonso VII of Castile and Le√≥n and built in the traditional style of Cistercian Romanesque architecture in Spain. Alfonso VII had introduced the Cistercians monasteries into Spain and after the monastery's completion, he settled in place Cistercian monks who had come from France. Alfonso VII, and afterward his grandson Alfonso VIII of Castile, extended privileges to the monastery several times in order to exempt rights of way tax for people and goods, and grant freedom of movement for their grazing flocks. The Christian conquests and reconquests were followed by migrations of Muslims for religious reasons that could cause the depopulation of entire areas. Muslims had populated the surviving cities that had been founded during the Roman Empire and Visigothic civilization. The area of Segovia had a large Muslim population which resisted the Christian reconquest several times after attempts at cultural assimilation. The newly founded monasteries served, among other things, as centers of evangelization and colonization. Abundant irrigation systems, canals, ditches, and castles had already been constructed during the Muslim era. The Muslim people established their cities on the banks of rivers, because their economy was based on agriculture, concentrating on the cultivation of irrigated land. Some areas of the Pyrenees had not been effectively occupied because of the high altitude, but the traffic of people and goods was controlled by establishing fortified steps at the entrance to the valleys. Because of Muslim occupation, the nobles and Christian clergy had settled mostly in the north of present-day Spain, then small independent Christian kingdoms. There they began to organize churches and monasteries around which the Christian communities soon developed. Religious communities revived trade among other Iberian towns especially in wool and salt, also the cultivation of vines and raising of livestock. Differences between newly arrived monks and earlier residents of the area caused altercations concerning the passage of merchant mule caravans, the exploitation of salt, water use in the region's villages, dominion over the towns, pastures, and tithes. Some parts of the monastery were rebuilt after being destroyed by fire in 1641. The abbey remained an active monastic community until 1835. The monastery was closed about 1836-1840 during Isabella II of Spain's rule as a consequence of the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendiz√°bal. The Desamortizaci√≥n caused the exclaustration of the place, brought monastic life to an end and the main church was privatized. Its Romanesque abbey church remains one of the monuments of Sacramenia.  History 1926‚Äì64  The historic monastery building is for the most part in the United States, that is, the cloister, the chapter house and the refectory of the monks. The rest of the monastic compound, that is, the church and other facilities such as Cilla (mullion) remain privately owned in Spain, in Sacramenia village, although the grounds can be visited on certain days. It was declared a Spanish national monument on June 3, 1931. The monastery's cloister and its outbuildings were illegally purchased and moved by William Randolph Hearst in 1926, despite Spanish government restrictions.‚ÄùHearst Buys Cloister of Tenth Century Date‚Äù Evening Star (Washington D.C) (1926, December 14),p.2. In order to be transported to the United States, the structures were carefully dismantled, each piece was numbered and packaged in wooden crates lined with hay. The total shipment comprised 11,000 crates. However, some of the information contained in this labeling process was lost when the shipment was quarantined in the USA because of a break-out of hoof and mouth disease in Segovia. During the quarantine, the crates were opened and the hay filling was burned as a measure to prevent the spread of the disease. During the repackaging, the contents of the crates were not replaced correctly. William Randolph Hearst was ultimately unable to pursue his plan of rebuilding the monastery at San Simeon because of financial difficulties. The dismantled buildings were stored in a warehouse in Brooklyn, New York until they were purchased in 1952 by Raymond Moss and William Edgemon, who eventually reassembled them on the site of a small plant nursery in northern Miami. There the religious buildings became a tourist attraction known as the Ancient Spanish Monastery. Raymond Moss and William Edgemon took charge of the reconstruction of the historic building in 1964. They added other decorative pieces from different Spanish buildings to the original complex, such as the large round carved-stone coat of arms seen in the cloister. The coat of arms originally belonged to the House of Alburquerque and came from the monastery of San Francisco de Cuellar, also in the province of Segovia. The chapel was erected in the 15th century by Beltr√°n de la Cueva, 1st Duke of Alburquerque, favorite of Henry IV of Castile and the first Duke of Alburquerque to be earmarked for the family vaults, which were also sold in the 20th century after the secularization of the monastery. Reassembling the ancient monastic buildings took 19 months and cost almost 1.5 million dollars. Some of the original stones remained unused in the process.  History 1964‚Äìdate  The property was purchased by Bishop Henry I. Louttit in 1964 for the Episcopal Diocese of South Florida, which was later split into the Dioceses of Central, Southeast and Southwest Florida. Eventually financial difficulties forced the three dioceses to sell the monastery, it was purchased by Colonel Robert Pentland Jr., who gave it to the Episcopal parish of St. Bernard de Clairvaux. Three doors from the monastery are now in a private home in Atlanta, Georgia. Wedding in the St.Bernard de Clairvaux Church.

The parish lies immediately to the south of Carlisle itself and comprises the following settlements - Blackwell, Durdar, Carleton, Brisco and Wreay (the first three are usually regarded as outlying parts of Carlisle, although were not part of the former county borough of Carlisle). According to the 2001 census it had a population of 2,043. The civil parish was formed in 1866 and has seen various boundary changes during its existence, mostly due to the expansion of Carlisle, although the former separate parish of Wreay was absorbed in 1934. The parish is named after St Cuthbert's Church in Carlisle city centre. The \\"Without\\" part of the name means this was the part of the ecclesiastical parish of St Cuthbert's that was outside the city boundary or walls. The original civil parish of Carlisle St Cuthbert was split in 1866 to form St Cuthbert Without and St Cuthbert Within - the latter of which became part of a merged Carlisle civil parish in 1904. St Mary's Church (Wreay), built in 1842, is notable for its architecture. At one time the parish included the modern Carlisle suburbs and districts of Botchergate, St Nicholas, Currock, Upperby and Harraby. The M6, A6 and West Coast main railway line all run through the parish. The A6 meets the M6 at junction 42 (the Golden Fleece Roundabout) in Carleton. At different times there have been railway stations at Wreay and Brisco. The main river in the parish is the River Petteril. Blackwell Blackwell () is a village in the parish, just south Carlisle. Carlisle Racecourse is in the village. Brisco Brisco (; postcode district CA4) is a village in the parish. It is located a few miles south of Carlisle, near Junction 42 of the M6 motorway. There is St Ninian's well in the village. In the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales of 1870-72 it had a population of 323. Brisco railway station served the village. Carleton Carleton (; postcode district CA1) is a hamlet on the A6 road, in the parish; it adjoins the suburb of Carlisle known as Harraby. In the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales of 1870-72 it had a population of 181. It is a few miles to the south-east of the city centre of Carlisle and is near the River Petteril. The buildings along the A6 between Junction 42 of the M6 to Barrock Fell including Scalesceugh Hall are all addressed as being part of Carleton. Garlands Hospital (formerly Cumberland and Westmorland Lunatic Asylum) was based in the village until it closed in 1999. Durdar Durdar (; postcode district CA2) is a small suburban area based around a crossroads (with a pub the Black Lion, and a petrol station/garage) in the parish, 2 km to the south of the city of Carlisle.

The treaties define Monaco's independent status and sovereignty, as well as the rights of succession of the princely House of Grimaldi. 1861 Treaty The Franco-Mon√©gasque Treaty of 1861 recognised the sovereignty of Monaco. Previously, under the Treaty of Vienna, the principality had been a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia. 1918 Treaty A second treaty was signed by Stephen Pichon, then the French minister of foreign affairs, and a representative of Albert I, Prince of Monaco on July 17, 1918, owing to the Monaco Succession Crisis of 1918 near the end of the First World War.Text of 1918 treaty; accessed from the U.N. website Dec 2009 At the time the heir to the Mon√©gasque throne had no legitimate children, and the possibility of his German cousins, the dukes of Urach, succeeding in the future to the throne was unacceptable to the French. Pressure was brought to bear on the Mon√©gasques to ratify treaty provisions which would empower France to prevent such an occurrence.Berg and Duffy, LLP. \\"New treaty replaces Franco-Mon√©gasque Treaty of 1918\\". International Business and Commercial Law, 1997-2007. Accessed: January 9, 2009. Article 2 of the treaty stipulated that foreign policy measures concerning Monaco must be agreed upon by the French and Mon√©gasque governments. 2002 Treaty A third, and most current treaty was signed on October 24, 2002. Monaco had become a full Member State of the United Nations in May 1993. The 2002 treaty addressed issues of sovereignty raised by the 2002 revision of Monaco's constitution. Under those constitutional revisions, approved by the 2002 treaty, although only a born member of the Grimaldi line may now wear the Crown, Monaco assumes the unilateral prerogative to alter the order of succession and the principality's independence is explicitly secured. This resolved Mon√©gasque concerns that under the 1918 treaty dynastic acts affecting the succession (such as marriage or adoption within the reigning House of Grimaldi) required French assent, yet if a vacancy on the throne occurred, Monaco would have automatically become a French protectorate. That prospect no longer exists.Monaco Minister Plenipotentiary Georges Grinda (trans. Jorri C. Duursma). The Principality of Monaco: State, International Status, Institutions.

It was released in the US (Hickory LPS 149) in November 1969. The Best of Donovan marked the third Hickory Records compilation of Donovan's 1965 Pye Records material in the United States, following the Like It Is, Was, and Evermore Shall Be from 1968. History Strong sales of Donovan's material continued throughout the late 1960s, prompting many fans to desire a greatest hits compilation of the most popular hits. Donovan and Epic Records responded by releasing Donovan's Greatest Hits in January 1969, which went on to become Donovan's highest selling album, reaching No. 4 on the U.S. Billboard charts. In response to the success of Donovan's Greatest Hits, Hickory Records assembled another compilation of Donovan's 1965 Pye Records recordings and titled it The Best of Donovan. Like Like It Is, Was, and Evermore Shall Be, this compilation was released with psychedelic cover art that fit in with Donovan's late 1960s image rather than his 1965 image as a folk singer. Hickory's marketing strategy worked to a degree, as The Best of Donovan charted at No. 135 in the United States. Though the collection presents some material (including \\"Jersey Thursday\\") in stereo for the first time, a technical flaw was also present.

Since the start of the ongoing Syrian Civil War in March 2011, alternative coats of arms have been created by the Syrian opposition and the Federation of Northern Syria. History Since the declaration of the Syrian Republic on 14 May 1930, Syria has had several coats of arms, albeit fairly consistent in composition - a supporter (often the Hawk of Quraish) bearing a shield, with the official Arabic name of the territory on a scroll beneath. During Syria's union with Egypt in the United Arab Republic (UAR) between 1958 and 1961, the pan-Arab Eagle of Saladin was used as the basis of the coat of arms. Though Syria withdrew from the union in 1961, Egypt continued to use the official name, flag, and coat of arms of the UAR until 1971. Syria reverted to the coat of arms used before the UAR, inverting the colours of the mullets and the orle two years later. During the period of the Federation of Arab Republics between 1972 and 1977, a loose association of Egypt, Libya, and Syria, the Hawk of Quraish was used as the coat of arms. After the end of the union, all three former member states retained the Hawk of Quraish. Egypt finally reverted to the Eagle of Saladin in 1984, which had served as the coat of arms of both Egypt and Libya prior to the abortive union, and which still serves as the basis of the in this arms of Egypt, Iraq, and Palestine. Syria continued to use the Hawk of Quraish, as did Libya under Gaddafi (although the Libyan version faced to the dexter rather than to the sinister, as in the Syrian version).

That was the last time most people saw Spitzer alive. After 20 hours of tense negotiations, during which the hostages did not eat and were not allowed to use the bathroom, the hostages and terrorists were flown by helicopter to F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base from which, the terrorists believed, they would be flown by jet to a friendly Arab nation. Instead, the Bavarian border patrol and Munich police attempted an ill-prepared rescue operation, though 15 minutes before the terrorists arrived 17 West German police officers who had been tasked with ambushing the terrorists, dressed as pilots and stewards, took a vote, decided to abort their mission, and left their ambush. After a two-hour gunfight, Spitzer watched as four of his teammates were killed with machine guns, after which a grenade was detonated inside their helicopter.

After the death of his father Newel Knight, Jesse's family was poor throughout his youth. As a young man, he worked as a prospector and discovered the Humbug Mine in the Tintic Mining District near Eureka, Utah in 1896. As the Humbug proved profitable, he acquired other mines in the vicinity, including the Uncle Sam, Beck Tunnel, Iron Blossom, and Colorado mines. After making his fortune, Knight went on to found the Latter Day Saint settlement of Raymond, Alberta, Canada. In 1964, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. Biography Knight was born in Nauvoo, Illinois to prominent Mormons Newel and Lydia Knight. When Jesse was a one-year-old, his family was forced to flee Nauvoo as Mormon pioneers under the leadership of Brigham Young. Jesse's father died in Nebraska on the Mormon Trail in January 1847; his mother and eight siblings continued on but were not able to reach their Salt Lake Valley destination until early 1850. Knight is significant in Western American mining and entrepreneurial history because in several important ways he differed from the typical \\"robber baron\\" capitalists of the late-nineteenth century Gilded Age. His success, like theirs, depended upon the skillful acquisition and management of such business variables as claims, labor, capital, technology, and government services, and also upon the development of cost-efficient integrated enterprises, such as the Knight Investment Company. However, he also owned more patented mining claims in the Intermountain West than did his counterparts, and he was not inclined to engage in stock manipulation like many other mining entrepreneurs and railroad barons. Moreover, his business methods, especially when dealing with his working men, were far more paternalistic and benevolent than those of the typical big businessmen of the era. While other company town and mine owners often exploited their workers, Knight treated his workers very fairly in his company town of Knightsville, Utah, which he equipped with a meetinghouse, amusement hall, and school instead of the usual hedonistic establishments of mining camp life. Although Knight's philanthropy was not unique for the period, his generous gifts to Brigham Young University (an interest he shared with his wife, Amanda) earned him the reputation as the \\"patron saint\\" of BYU. He also gave freely to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and to many church-related projects. Furthermore, his comfortable but unostentatious home in Provo, Utah, did not rival the extravagantly garish mansions built by big businessmen from San Francisco's Nob Hill to New York's Fifth Avenue. Nor did he seek high political office like mining kings George Hearst, James Fair, William Sharon, John P. Jones, Nathaniel Hill, Jerome B. Chaffee, Horace Tabor, William Clark, or Utah's Thomas Kearns‚Äîall of whom served in the \\"millionaire's club\\" of the United States Senate. Knight was known by the moniker \\"Uncle Jesse\\" during his lifetime due to his image as rich but giving uncle. In his writing, he expressed a belief that his money was for the purpose of doing good and building up his church; he regarded the matter as a \\"trusted stewardship.\\" As he once said, \\"The earth is the Lord's bank, and no man has a right to take money out of that bank and use it extravagantly upon himself.\\" Although he strayed from the LDS Church in his early years and briefly affiliated with the anti-Mormon Liberal Party in Utah, he was a devout member for most of his life and helped to save the LDS Church from financial ruin incurred from legal battles with the federal government over control of the Utah territory and issues such as polygamy. After making his fortune in mining, Knight went on to develop settlement and industry in what is today southern Alberta. In 1901, Knight purchased 30,000 acres (120 km¬≤) of land in Canada's Northwest Territories for $2.50 per acre. On this property he established a ranch; Knight later went on to acquire another 226,000 acres (915 km¬≤) of land near his ranch and established a town built around irrigation farming of sugar beets, which were then processed in a local sugar factory that Knight built. The settlement was named Raymond in honor of his son, Raymond Knight. Within five years, over 1,500 Latter-day Saints‚Äîmostly from Utah‚Äîhad immigrated to Raymond. The town incorporated in 1903, and today Knight is honored as the founder of Raymond, Alberta.

The free surface effect is a mechanism which can cause a watercraft to become unstable and capsize.E.Lewis, Editor, Principles of Naval Architecture, 2nd. Rev., 1988 (The Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers), page 93ff It refers to the tendency of liquids ‚Äî and of unbound aggregates of small solid objects, like seeds, gravel, or crushed ore, whose behavior approximates that of liquids ‚Äî to move in response to changes in the attitude of a craft's cargo holds, decks, or liquid tanks in reaction to operator-induced motions (or sea states caused by waves and wind acting upon the craft). When referring to the free surface effect, the condition of a tank that is not full is described as a \\"slack tank\\", while a full tank is \\"pressed up\\".Ship inspection maritime guide. Stability and equilibrium In a normally loaded vessel any rolling from perpendicular is countered by a righting moment generated from the increased volume of water displaced by the hull on the lowered side. This assumes the center of gravity of the vessel is relatively constant. If a moving mass inside the vessel moves in the direction of the roll, this counters the righting effect by moving the center of gravity towards the lowered side. The free surface effect can become a problem in a craft with large partially full bulk cargo compartments, fuel tanks, or water tanks (especially if they span the full breadth of the ship), or from accidental flooding, such as has occurred in several accidents involving roll-on/roll-off ferries. If a compartment or tank is either empty or full, there is no change in the craft's center of mass as it rolls from side to side (in strong winds, heavy seas, or on sharp motions or turns). However, if the compartment is only partially full, the liquid in the compartment will respond to the vessel's heave, pitch, roll, surge, sway or yaw. For example, as a vessel rolls to port, liquid will displace to the port side of a compartment, and this will move the vessel's center of mass to port. This has the effect of slowing the vessel's return to vertical. The momentum of large volumes of moving liquids cause significant dynamic forces, which act against the righting effect. When the vessel returns to vertical the roll continues and the effect is repeated on the opposite side. In heavy seas, this can become a positive feedback loop, causing each roll to become more and more extreme, eventually overcoming the righting effect leading to a capsize. While repeated oscillations of increasing magnitude are commonly associated with the free surface effect, they are not a necessary condition. For example, in the cases of both the and , gradual buildup of water from fire-fighting caused capsizing in a single continuous roll. Mitigation To mitigate this hazard, cargo vessels use multiple smaller bulk compartments or liquid tanks, instead of fewer larger ones, and possibly baffles within bulk compartments or liquid tanks to minimize the free surface effects on the craft as a whole. Keeping individual bulk compartments or liquid tanks either relatively empty or full is another way to minimize the effect and its attendant problems. Hydraulic tankers use water to displace lighter oil to keep the tank full at all times. Tanks or compartments that do not straddle the vessel's centerline are somewhat less prone to destabilising oscillations. Similarly, narrow compartments (aligned bow to stern) and compartments at the extremes away from the centerline, are less prone to cause instability. Historical examples Flooding, liquid cargo leakage, or unintended water (from precipitation, waves, or hull damage) in any compartments or on any decks of watercraft, and the resulting free surface effect are often a contributing cause of accidents, capsizes, and casualties e.g. the loss of (Wellington, New Zealand, April 1968), (Zeebrugge, Belgium, March 1987), and (Baltic Sea, September 1994). In the case of the RORO ferry al-Salam Boccaccio 98 (Red Sea, February 2006), improper fire- fighting procedures caused flooding leading directly to instability and capsize. In both the cases of the al-Salam Boccaccio 98 and , severe listing followed immediately after the ship had undergone a hard turn, causing unstable volumes of water (from collision damage in the latter) to surge from one side of the ship to the other. Effects on land and aircraft The free surface effect can affect any kind of craft, including watercraft (where it is most common), bulk cargo or liquid tanker semi-trailers and trucks (causing either jackknifing or roll-overs), and aircraft (especially fire-fighting water-droppers and refueling tankers where baffles mitigate but do not eliminate the effects). The term \\"free surface effect\\" implies a liquid under the influence of gravity. Slosh dynamics is the overarching field which covers both free surface effects and situations such as space vehicles, where gravity is inconsequential but inertia and momentum interact with complex fluid mechanics to cause vehicle instability.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on March 26, 2006. The episode follows Stewie as he battles with his half- brother, Bertram (voiced by Wallace Shawn), who is born to two lesbians after Peter donates sperm. Meanwhile, Lois begins excessive eating after Peter undergoes a vasectomy and loses his interest in sex. The episode was written by Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and directed by Dan Povenmire. The episode received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 7.95 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Randy Crenshaw, Gavin Dunne, Bob Joyce, John Joyce, Phil LaMarr, Rick Logan, Wallace Shawn, Tara Strong, Nicole Sullivan and Wally Wingert, as well as several recurring voice actors for the series. Plot After a pregnancy scare, Peter reluctantly agrees to get a vasectomy to prevent further repeats. But in the case he and Lois end up wanting to have another baby, Peter donates sperm before his surgery. While in the sperm bank, Peter accidentally destroys all the existing samples, and decides to replace them with his own to prevent himself from getting into trouble. Nine months later, a lesbian couple, who took away some of Peter's sperm in order to conceive a child, gives birth to Bertram, Stewie's half-brother who first appeared in the episode \\"Emission Impossible\\". Shortly after birth, Bertram declares war with Stewie for control over the playground. They confront each other in the playground with F-117 Nighthawks and AH-1 Cobras, firing numerous bullets at each other. After the air battle ends with no winners, Bertram resorts to biological warfare, and uses Stewie's new-found girlfriend to infect Stewie with chickenpox. After recovering, an enraged Stewie confronts Bertram, and they engage in a sword fight in the play area. Stewie eventually wins by disarming Bertram, and later that night, is seen suspiciously digging a hole with Christopher Moltisanti, but the hole is actually for a young tree. When Christopher questions Stewie on what happened to Bertram, Stewie claims that Bertram admitted defeat to Stewie and ran away, with Christopher calling Bertram a mook. After the vasectomy, Peter loses his sex drive, much to the frustration of Lois, who embraces overeating as a substitute. As a result, she gains some weight and becomes chubby. After Peter makes fun of her weight gain, she decides to gorge herself so she can deliberately gain more weight out of spite. Her increased appetite results in her growing even fatter than Peter is, which ironically ends up reviving their sex life; after accidentally being crushed by a massive Lois in bed, Peter realizes that he finds her new enormous figure far sexier than her old slim one. A new \\"fat sex\\" life arises, where Peter embraces Lois' appetite by feeding her mountains of food to help her grow fatter. Lois enjoys being fattened up, as the sex continues to get better as she grows bigger. Sadly, the fat sex life is not meant to last, as Lois' enjoyment of fat sex causes her eating to spiral out of control; she eventually gains so much weight that her heart finally gives out during sex. She is rushed to the hospital, where she reluctantly agrees to let the doctors remove all of the excess fat from her body, returning her to her normal size. Though she admits that she will miss being huge, she realizes that she should not eat to solve her problems. Production Dan Povenmire directed the episode. The song performed after Lois' pregnancy test comes back negative was written by Alec Sulkin and Alex Borstein, and sung by professional Hollywood studio singers. Orchestrations in this song were performed by Walter Murphy, and described by show producer Seth MacFarlane to be \\"wonderful\\". The sketch of Peter challenging Lois to a race to Boston was removed from television broadcasting in order to save time. As Lois is slowly racing Peter to Boston, a Shania Twain song can be heard on the radio; Dan Povenmire states on the DVD commentary that he often gets into trouble for adding pieces of music into an episode when they're so short, yet cost so much. The producers of both Family Guy and the Ice Age series agreed to collaborate in the episode during its reference to Scrat from the Ice Age series. There was discussion among the producers of the series regarding whether Bertram should be included in the storyline, as he had not appeared in any episodes for several years. An un- used scene was intended for broadcasting which showed Stewie, while trying to find Waldo in an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog, saying to Brian \\"Oh, turn to the next page. I bet they put him in someone's utility pocket\\", but it was never used as it was not deemed funny enough for the episode. Originally, Peter singing \\"Milkshake\\" to inmates at a prison was going to be naked and push his nipples from underneath, but broadcasting standards objected; as a result, the show broadcast Peter wearing underpants and pushing his nipples from the side. When Peter and Lois are in the restaurant and Peter leaves to \\"warn the chef of Lois' arrival\\", Lois was intended to say \\"If he won't put something in me, I will\\", but the gag was never broadcast. The unsafe homeless man with whom Peter was seen leaving a youth-baseball team in Stewie's flashback was originally based on John Wayne Gacy, but people claimed he didn't look scary enough, so Povenmire changed the character completely to that of a homeless man. The idea of Stewie and Bertram laughing as they go down the slide during their sword fight was pitched by Povenmire's wife and, although negative about the idea at first, Povenmire included it in the episode because the original sketch was not going so well. During Peter and Lois' \\"fat sex\\", Peter repeatedly states \\"almost, almost\\"; originally, there was going to be approximately twice as many of these, but they were never included in the episode. The DVD version of the episode shows Peter arriving at the sperm bank and saying to the receptionist: \\"I have an appointment to banish a White Russian from my Kremlin\\", to which she replies with \\"This is a sperm bank, you don't have to use innuendo\\", and Peter concludes the conversation with \\"Where do I splooge?\\". In addition to the regular cast, actors Randy Crenshaw, Gavin Dunne, Bob Joyce, John Joyce, Rick Logan, and Wallace Shawn, and voice actors Phil LaMarr, Tara Strong, Nicole Sullivan, and Wally Wingert guest starred in the episode. Recurring voice actor Ralph Garman, and writers Mike Henry, Chris Sheridan, Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin, and John Viener made minor appearances. Actor Patrick Warburton appeared in the episode as well. Cultural references When in the children's park, Stewie quotes \\"Did ya get me my Cheez Whiz, boy\\" and a man throws one to him, this is a reference to The Blues Brothers. Stewie and Brian attempting to find diversity in an Abercrombie and Fitch catalogue is a reference to the children's book series Where's Wally?, as well as to a lawsuit alleging a lack of diversity in Abercrombie and Fitch's hiring practices. Before the battle between Stewie and Bertram, Stewie says \\"On my signal, unleash hell.\\" This is a reference to the opening scene of Gladiator. An Ice Age reference is made when Scrat, a character from the films, attempts to steal Peter's nuts. When Stewie invades Bertram's camp at the end of the episode Bertram quotes Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, repeating the line Darth Vader says when he senses Obi-Wan Kenobi on the Death Star. When Peter names his kids, Peter mentions the kids from various shows that are currently airing at Nick at Nite. When Brian mentions this, Peter begins naming Street Fighter characters. Brian again points out this fact, after which Peter names various colors.http://www.tvfanatic.com/quotes/shows/family-guy/episodes/sibling- rivalry/ Sauron, the villain from The Lord of the Rings is shown as the Eye of Sauron in a scene where he is trying to find his lost contact lens. A cutaway scene features Peter in a jail surrounded by inmates who force him to strip, squeeze his boobs together, and sing the chorus from Kelis's 2003 hit ‚ÄúMilkshake.‚Äù This is possibly an homage to the scene after the credits in the movie Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story in which Ben Stiller does the same thing in his fatsuit. After Bertram's defeat, the scene cuts away to Stewie and Christopher Moltisanti from The Sopranos digging a hole. The viewer is led to assume that the hole is for Bertram but really it is for a tree Stewie and Christopher are planting. Then Stewie states that Bertram admitted to defeat and ran off after which Christopher calls Bertram a \\"mook.\\" Reception \\"Sibling Rivalry\\" was watched by 7.95 million viewers, making it the 77th most-watched program of the week. In a review of the episode, Bob Sassone of TV Squad noted \\"If there's one reason I'm glad I watched tonight's episode it's because I learned exactly how a vasectomy is done,\\" adding that \\"Peter is going to have a vasectomy, so he decides to freeze his sperm before he does it. This leads to a hysterical, yet truly gross, scene where Peter knocks over an entire shelf of sperm samples, and has to refill them, um, himself.\\" Geoffrey D. Roberts of Real Talk Reviews reviewed the episode negatively, writing \\"many viewers will probably be disappointed with an episode about sibling rivalry between Stewie and newfound half-brother Bertram. Both share the same goal ‚Äì to rule the Universe. With Bertram nothing more than a whinier version of his half-brother, it turns out one Stewie Griffin is more than enough.\\" ReferencesExternal links  Category:Family Guy (season 4) episodes Category:2006 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about obesity ","title":"Sibling Rivalry (Family Guy)"},{"id":"3947788","text":"William Saunders Crowdy (August 11, 1847 - August 4, 1908) was an American soldier, preacher, entrepreneur, theologian, and pastor.

Walker Press, 1955 Crowdy was originally called \\"Wilson\\" by his overseer. Crowdy was born in a one-room slave cabin near the Patuxent River in the middle of a violent nighttime thunderstorm. Crowdy lived his early life in bondage working first by milking the plantation owner's cows. As he grew older he was assigned by the slave overseer to tend the plantation's melon patch, and then to work as a stable boy and tobacco drier. Life was hard on a 19th- century plantation and the cruel overseer on Crowdy's plantation punished the slaves brutally. Despite it being illegal for slaves to read, Crowdy was a religious and caring man from a young age and learned the Hebrew prophets, especially Elijah. According to oral history Crowdy was beaten by the slavemaster at age 7 for taking too much cornpone from the ration cook to feed his sister. He spent the night locked in a barn for punishment but prayed to Moses to be released from bondage of his captors. Ten years to the day later, in 1863, at age 17, Crowdy escaped from his master after an argument. Crowdy shed the name Wilson, regarding it as a slave name,, and became William, which he then used to enlist at the nearest Union army recruiting station.

The Whamola is a bass instrument used in funk-jazz styles of music. The name is a portmanteau of whammy bar and viola. The Whamola is a direct descendant of the washtub bass, an American folk instrument popular with skiffle and jug bands, and features a single string which is manipulated via a pulley-and-lever system. The pulley mechanism is mounted in place of the tuning pegs at the top of a double-bass-style neck, which is attached to a wooden or metal body featuring a bridge, pickup and stand. The Whamola is played by hitting the string with a drum stick and either fretting it against the neck with the other hand or using the lever to alter its tension and change the pitch. Whamolas are rare, and are usually made by musicians for personal use, as opposed to professional luthiers, though the instrument has gained mass exposure and growing popularity in recent years due to its being played by contemporary bassists like Les Claypool. A song prominently featuring the instrument appears on the Les Claypool Frog Brigade's 2002 album Purple Onion, and a remix of that same track is the basis for the opening theme of the tenth season of South Park.

He was the president of the Canadian Bank of Commerce from 1907 to 1924, and a generous patron of the arts, helping to found and nurture many of Canada's cultural and educational institutions, including the University of Toronto, National Gallery of Canada, the Champlain Society, Appleby College, Art Gallery of Ontario and Royal Ontario Museum.Marshall, Barbara Ruth. Sir Edmond Walker, Servant of Canada (thesis) , Department of History, University of British Columbia, June 1971. In 1910, King George V knighted Walker for his contributions to business and the arts.  Early years  Byron Edmund Walker was born on 14 October 1848 on the outskirts of Caledonia in Seneca Township, Haldimand County, Canada West. His grandfather, Thomas Walker, had been a manufacturer of watchcases in London, England. He arrived in Upper Canada (now Ontario) in 1834 with four of his children, some books and some pictures. The loss of his wife and four of his children contributed heavily to his decision to leave London for Canada. The third youngest child was Alfred Edmund Walker, Sir Edmund's father, a farmer who became a clerk. He was also an amateur naturalist, paleontologist and watercolour painter. Alfred Edmund married Fanny Murton of Hamilton in 1845. Fanny's parents also were immigrants from England, having arrived in 1832. Her father, William Murton, was college educated and her mother spoke Italian and French and played the harpsichord. She also ran a private junior school in Hamilton. The Walkers had nine children of which Byron Edmund (or Edmund, as he preferred to be called) was the second oldest. The family moved from their farm near Caledonia, to Hamilton in 1852. There, at the age of four, Edmund began studies at his grandmother's school and then at the Hamilton Central School where he completed all six grades. He hoped to pursue a teaching career but poor health curtailed his enrollment in the Toronto Normal School, the teacher's college founded by Egerton Ryerson in 1851. At the age of 12, Walker entered the service of his uncle, John Walter Murton, who had a currency exchange business in Hamilton.  Banking career  While working at his uncle's bureau de change, Walker became an expert in recognizing counterfeit bills being circulated during the American Civil War. After seven years at his uncle's firm, he spent a few months in Montreal but poor health forced him to return to Hamilton in 1868 where he began work as a discount clerk in the newly opened Canadian Bank of Commerce. The Canadian Bank of Commerce was established by industrialist William McMaster in 1867. McMaster would serve as a guiding light to the young Edmund, who quickly rose through the ranks. In 1872, he was appointed chief accountant at the bank's head office in Toronto. In May 1873, Walker was sent to New York City as junior agent for the bank. Charged with responsibility for loans of gold against currency, he successfully maintained proper margins in spite of his clients' many sudden bankruptcies. The enterprising Walker was then sent to the bank's Windsor branch in 1875. In 1878, he was appointed manager of the London, Ontario branch, a year later was made inspector of the bank, and in 1880 he returned to Hamilton as manager. Walker married Mary Alexander in 1874 while living in New York. Together they had four sons and three daughters. She was the daughter of Alexander Alexander, a carpenter who emigrated from Scotland to Lockport, New York, in 1834. That year, he married Isabella Buchan and moved to Hamilton, Ontario, where he became a green grocer. Together they had five children. From 1881 to 1886, Edmund was again in New York as the bank's joint agent, giving him the opportunity to increase his talents in foreign exchange and to conduct international banking on a much larger scale. There he could expand his cultural interests, visiting galleries and museums, and beginning, in earnest, his art collection. In 1886, at age 38, Walker was recalled to Toronto as general manager of the Canadian Bank of Commerce. By then there were 30 branches in Ontario and agencies in Toronto, Montreal and New York. The bank's assets at its inception were $2,997,081; 50 years later, these were $440,310,703 with branches across the country, largely attributable to Walker's strong leadership. Walker is known for developing the first set of written regulations for dividing a bank into a complex array of departments and is widely credited for the Canadian government's 1881/82 revision of the Canada Banking Act that gave Canada a centralized, panic-proof banking system. Walker was also professionally respected internationally. As vice-president of the American Bankers Association he was invited by a U.S. congressional committee to advise on the drafting of the Federal Reserve legislation. He held many key national and international positions; chairman of the bankers' section of the Toronto Board of Trade from 1891‚Äì92; vice-president of the Canadian Bankers Association (which he helped found in 1891) in 1893 and its president from 1894‚Äì95; chairman of the 1899 Royal Commission on the financial position of the province of Ontario; and chairman of the Section of Money and Credit for the 1904 Universal Exposition in St. Louis. He was a fellow of the Institute of Bankers of England and fellow of the Royal Economic Society of England. In 1906, he was elected director of the Canadian Bank of Commerce. He served as president from 1907 until his death in 1924.  Political ties  The Liberal Party government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier appointed Walker to the National Battlefields Commission in 1908. The commission was charged with the recovery of non-Crown land for a \\"Battlefields Park\\" in Quebec City where the Battle of the Plains of Abraham was fought between French and British forces. The commission was also charged with supervision of the expenditures of the Tercentenary Celebration of Samuel de Champlain founding Quebec in 1608. Later, Walker was made chairman of the Canadian committee of the Peace Centenary, an event planned by the Canadian, American and British governments to commemorate 100 years of peace between Canada and the United States following the War of 1812-14. Although Walker tried to stay out of active politics all his life and never joined a political party, he decided to take a pivotal role in the political arena with a group of 18 prominent businessmen who opposed the Reciprocity Agreement with the United States proposed by the Laurier government. Walker feared that the giant American trusts, once allowed into Canada, would paralyze the Canadian market. Furthermore, as an ardent patriot and staunch imperialist, he feared it would weaken Canada's ties with Britain and lead to annexation by the United States. The anti-reciprocity forces led to the defeat of Laurier's government in 1911. Walker was among those who advised the new Conservative Party prime minister, Sir Robert Borden, on preserving the financial stability of Canada during the First World War.  Interests in education  Walker credited his father for developing his broad interests and love for learning, and always regretted that poor health prevented him from getting a formal education. He believed that the basis of a civilized society was its educational system and that a nation's universities were its most treasured institutions. Throughout his life he took an active interest in educational institutions. One of the first and most lasting of his interests was the University of Toronto. In 1887, the denominational institutions of Victoria College (Methodist), Knox College (Presbyterian), Wycliffe College (Anglican theological school), and St. Michael's College (Roman Catholic) had entered into a federation with the secular University College, the only one funded by the government. After fire destroyed the eastern portion of University College in 1890, Walker was instrumental in persuading the Ontario government to make its first grant to the amalgamated University of Toronto. He was also responsible for leading the last denominational college - Trinity College, affiliated with the Church of England - into the federation in 1904. Trinity awarded him a Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) that same year. In 1905, he was a member of the Royal Commission on the reorganization of the university, which was responsible for securing annual government grants thereafter. Over the course of his 32-year involvement with the university, Walker served as trustee (1892‚Äì1906), senator (1893‚Äì1901), member of the Board of Governors (1906‚Äì10), chairman (1910‚Äì23) and chancellor (1923‚Äì24). The Toronto Conservatory of Music also joined the university through his efforts. He served as a member of its Board of Governors, and later as president (1917‚Äì24). His support for music also included the Mendelssohn Choir, for which he was honorary president (1900‚Äì24). With a lasting commitment to education and the importance of Canadian history in nurturing patriotism and a Canadian identity, he founded the Champlain Society in 1905. Established as a non-profit organization, its mandate was to publish important documents relating to Canadian history, projects that commercial publishers would consider unprofitable. He believed that this Society was his finest achievement. He served as its president until his death. As an author of articles on a variety of subjects - banking, Robert Browning, Italian and Japanese art - it is not surprising that Walker would be one of the founders of the Canadian Society of Authors, established to promote Canadian literature and protect authors with copyright laws. Walker served as president from 1904-09. In 1911, Walker established Appleby School, a boys' private boarding school, for which he purchased the initial property in Oakville. The first headmaster of the school was Walker's son-in-law John Guest.  A love of art  Through his years in New York City and early trips to Europe - including to London in 1887 and Italy in 1892 - Walker developed skills as an art connoisseur and collector, often lecturing on the subject. His collection of art was housed in his Toronto residence - \\"Long Garth\\" at 99 St. George Street. The Victorian brick structure had fine wood interiors, Art Nouveau ceiling decorations by Gustav Hahn, and allegorical murals by George Agnew Reid. \\"Long Garth\\" became a treasure trove of etchings, prints, embroideries and oriental carpets, bronzes, brass and ivory work, porcelain china, not to mention his fossil collection and his extensive library. Walker had a particular fascination with printmaking and it was said that his expert eye for detail in detecting counterfeit banknotes aided his connoisseurship. Walker also was a member of the Japan Society of America and the most notable part of his collection, 1,070 Japanese woodblock prints, were bequeathed to the Royal Ontario Museum on his death. Equally of note is the collection of over 400 works of graphic art, ranging from the 15th to the 9th centuries, which he assembled between 1880 and 1924, including works by Albrecht D√ºrer and Rembrandt. His children gave the collection to the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1926. Beyond purchasing some pictures by Canadian artists, Walker's first real connection with the Canadian art world began when he was approached by a number of prominent Toronto artists to help them organize a guild. With these like-minded laymen and artists who shared his ideals he formed the Toronto Guild of Civic Art. Spearheaded by George Agnew Reid, the guild pressed for civic improvements in the city. Walker served as its first president in 1897. As the Guild's representative on the committee to select the artist for the monument to Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe at Queen's Park, Walker was largely responsible for the commission being awarded to sculptor Walter Seymour Allward. Later, Walker was responsible for Allward's commissions to design the South African War Memorial on University Avenue in Toronto, as well as the Bell Telephone Memorial in Brantford.Ball, Vincent. The Industrialist, The Architect And The Home Boy, Brantford, ON: Brantford Expositor, 27 December 2009. Retrieved from BrantfordExpositor.ca 23 April 2012.  The Art Gallery of Ontario  Walker's relationship with George Agnew Reid led to the founding of the Art Gallery of Ontario. On 15 March 1900, Reid, then president of the Ontario Society of Artists, brought a group of citizens together to consider the formation of an art gallery for Toronto. At that meeting, a Provisional Art Museum Board was set in place with Walker as chairman and Reid as secretary. Through effective lobbying and fundraising ($5,000 each from 10 benefactors), the Ontario Legislature later that year passed a bill incorporating the Art Museum of Toronto. Walker became president of its Board of Trustees and served until his death. The initial challenge was to find a home for the new institution. It was Walker who convinced his friends, writer Dr. Goldwin Smith and his wife, the former Mrs. William Henry Boulton, to leave their historic house, \\"The Grange,\\" to the new museum. Before the news became public, Walker bought surrounding land so that the museum would have space for future expansion. The Art Museum of Toronto (later renamed the Art Gallery of Toronto and then the Art Gallery of Ontario) officially opened its first galleries in The Grange in April 1913. In 1926, two years after his death, when the gallery was expanding, the Canadian Bank of Commerce donated the funds to build the magnificent room that bears his name, the Walker Court.  The Royal Ontario Museum  The campaign for a world-class public museum for Toronto was led by Walker, philanthropist Sir Edmund Boyd Osler, then director of the Canadian Pacific Railway and president of The Dominion Bank, and Dr. Charles Trick Currelly, the first curator of the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology. An archaeologist, Currelly had been doing fieldwork in Egypt, Crete and Asia Minor for the purpose of collecting artifacts as a core collection for the small museum he established at Victoria College in 1907. But he wanted a larger museum for the university and others soon became involved. Walker, Osler and others provided funds and solicited financial support from the government. Together, Osler and Walker created an organizational structure for the museum, including how funding was to be shared between the university and the government. In 1912, the Royal Ontario Museum Act was passed. A Board of Trustees was created, with appointments shared equally by university and government. Walker was its first chairman. The Royal Ontario Museum opened on 19 March 1914. Currelly became director in 1914 until his retirement in 1946 and Walker remained chairman of the Board of Trustees until his death. In the ensuing years he contributed financially, and assisted through generous lines of credit from the Canadian Bank of Commerce, notably for Currelly's substantial acquisitions of Chinese artifacts. Walker's fossil collection became the nucleus of the museum's paleontology collection, and resulted in a dinosaur, Parasaurolophus walkeri, being named after him in 1922. His interest and support of paleontology had led to an earlier association with the Royal Canadian Institute, another scientific institution of which he was president from 1898-1900.  The National Gallery of Canada  At the first official exhibition of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts on 6 March 1880, Canada's Governor General, the Marquis of Lorne, established the National Gallery of Canada at the Clarendon Hotel in Ottawa. An Advisory Arts Council was formed in 1907 and consisted of Sir George Drummond, president of the Bank of Montreal, as chairman; the senator from Montreal, Arthur Boyer, as secretary; and Sir Edmund Walker, then just newly appointed president of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, as member. The council was charged with advising the government on architecture and decoration of public buildings and public monuments. It was responsible for selecting and purchasing artworks for the collection. Drummond favoured the acquisition of European works while Walker was adamant that Canadian art be included. On Drummond's death in 1909, Walker became chairman of the council. Walker's influence as a print collector was crucial in launching the gallery's Prints and Drawings Department, which opened in 1911. Another responsibility of the council was to advise on the Victoria Memorial Museum (Ottawa's present Natural History Museum), which opened in 1913. The same year the National Gallery of Canada Act was passed with an independent Board of Trustees constituted; Walker was appointed chairman and served until his death. Its trustees were charged, among other duties, with the development, encouragement and cultivation of \\"correct artistic taste in the fine arts.\\" By 1924, this collection had over 4,000 items.  Canada's \\"war pictures\\"  Walker was key in the creation of what today is the collection of First World War \\"war pictures\\" now housed in the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa. In 1915, the Canadian financier and expatriate, William Maxwell Aitken (later Baron Beaverbrook), was appointed the Canadian force's official records officer in England. Beaverbrook established the Canadian War Memorials Fund to record for posterity the events of that war. As both a member of the fund's committee and chairman of the Board of Trustees of the National Gallery, Walker insisted that the commissioned artists include Canadians, as well as the British artists Beaverbook proposed. By 1918, a large number of Canadian artists, among them A.Y. Jackson and Frederick Varley, were in Europe sketching munitions factories and various theatres of operations where Canadians were active. Other artists, C.W. Jefferys among them, recorded the war effort at home in Canada. In 1921, the Beaverbrook- funded war collection was deposited with the National Gallery. Walker also served on both the Canadian and British Commissions on War Records and Trophies, formed in 1918. In the Canadian plan, a gallery for the war pictures and a hall of trophies was to be built on Sussex Drive in Ottawa. Efforts to complete the building in 1922 and 1923 were unsuccessful and the paintings and trophies were loaned out. In 1971, the paintings were transferred from the National Gallery to the Canadian War Museum and now are displayed.  Innisfree  For weekend retreats, Walker began to purchase land in 1890 at De Grassi Point in Innisfil Township, Simcoe County. \\"Innisfree,\\" as his wife named it, became the centre of Walker's family life. There, he built \\"Broadeaves\\" designed by leading Canadian architect Frank Darling. Darling was the architect of the University of Toronto and designed many buildings associated with Walker such as Convocation Hall and Trinity College at the University of Toronto and the Canadian Bank of Commerce (now Commerce Court North) on King Street West in Toronto. In 1913-14, Walker built \\"Innisfree Farm\\" to further his interest in livestock husbandry. Innisfree was left in trust to his descendants as a private land trust. Managed today with the assistance of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Innisfree is designated an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest for its prairie grassland and remnants of an old growth forest ecosystem.  Last years  Sir Byron Edmund Walker left his imprint on the financial, artistic, and intellectual development of Canada. A wizard of finance, skilled in the intricacies of exchange and international business, he molded a tiny bank into a national institution and was largely responsible for overhauling the Canadian banking system. Simultaneously he established a wide range of cultural icons - the National Gallery of Canada, the collection of \\"war pictures\\" forming the nucleus of the Canadian War Museum, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Royal Ontario Museum, the Champlain Society, the federation of colleges that became the University of Toronto - and many more. An amateur paleontologist, he was also an author of note. He was knighted by King George V, was a Knight of Grace of the Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, and Japan appointed him Honorary Japanese Consul-General. Walker died at the age of 75, on 27 March 1924. After his death, The Globe and Mail wrote this description of Walker: \\"Possibly no more versatile Canadian existed in his day and age; probably few others have done so much for Canada.\\" Legacy Plaque installed at Innisfil, Ontario An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate Sir Byron Edmund Walker, C.V.O., LL.D., D.C.L. 1848-1924's role in Ontario's heritage.Ontario Plaque  See also  * Bell Telephone Memorial  References  ;Citations ;Bibliography * Ontario Heritage Foundation.

With a population of 18,663 (2012), it is the second largest city in Suriname, after Paramaribo. History It was originally called Kofi Djompo but was renamed by Cornelis Lely (the Dutch governor of Suriname in 1905) and since then it is known as Lelydorp. Lely was responsible for many large water construction projects in the Netherlands. The original name Kofi Djompo is said to refer to a maroon rebel leader called Kofi, who escaped by jumping over creek. Kofi means \\"born on Friday\\" (Kofi Annan, for example, was born on a Friday). Djompo means \\"jump\\". The hamlet started to grow when the Lawa Railway was constructed, but was mainly dependent on agriculture with cassave and asparagus beans as the main crops. Lelydorp is more like a big village instead of a city. Wanica has a population of about 118,000 and an area of about 440 km2. With a population of this size, Wanica is one of Suriname's most populated and most urbanised districts. Lelydorp is the main village of the district with many shops, offices, and businesses, but still needs a clear city structure and has many agricultural areas close to the centre and neighbourhoods. Lelydorp is also the most important halfway stopping point between Paramaribo and Zanderij, where the Johan Adolf Pengel Airport is located. Its population consists of a mixture of Javanese, East Indian, Creoles, and Europeans. Between 1890-1939 many people from Java settled into the area.

Ranken Jordan is a private, not-for-profit, specialty pediatric rehabilitation hospital located in Maryland Heights, Missouri. Ranken Jordan has built a unique, free-standing 60-bed state-of-the-art facility, which was financed on donations and private investment. The hospital treats infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0‚Äì21.  About  For children with complex medical conditions such as brain injuries or complications due to premature birth, Ranken Jordan helps bridge the gap between traditional hospital treatment and the comforts of home. Ranken Jordan provides interdisciplinary, specialized care, rehabilitation, and treatment for children 2-weeks to 21 years of age. Ranken Jordan is equipped with nursing care, education facilitation services, physical, occupational, speech, respiratory, and recreation therapies, outpatient therapy evaluations and treatment services, comprehensive, interdisciplinary child development programming and social services. With a large staff of medical professionals and community volunteers, each child at Ranken Jordan is given individualized attention, so that a stay in the hospital offers all the growth and rewards of being raised at home. The facility treats children with injuries and illnesses including, but not limited to: *Brain injuries *Burns *Complications from prematurity *Complications from obesity *Neuromuscular diseases *Orthopedic injuries *Ventilator dependency *Paralysis The facility includes: 60 inpatient pediatric beds, therapy gym and aqua therapy pool, developmental testing and child-centered activity areas, computer center, art therapy room, music and movement room, life skills kitchen, and a fully accessible playground both indoor and outdoor. Ranken Jordan is currently the only pediatric specialty hospital in Missouri, and one of only five such facilities in the nation. Children are admitted by referrals from other pediatric health care facilities and from children's hospitals. =The Need for Ranken Jordan= Medical advances are saving more sick and injured children than ever before. However, these children often need comprehensive, ongoing care. Ranken Jordan specializes in this growing need for sub-acute, traditional care. In the past five years, Ranken Jordan has created roughly 200 permanent, high-skill jobs without cutting a single position, wage or benefit. The type of medically complex patient's Ranken Jordan treats represent a portion of the one-half of one percent of the healthcare population whose cost of care is an estimated 30% of total healthcare cost of the US population. Many of Ranken Jordan's cases are not covered under insurance. While reimbursement relieves some of the financial burden, Ranken Jordan makes decisions to care for children, regardless of reimbursement or the family's ability to pay. No child is turned away. Mission In a letter to President Obama, Dr. Nick Holekamp (Chief Medical Officer of Ranken Jordan) writes, \\"Since the work of childhood is play, we've built a playful environment that maximizes normal socialization and interactivity while providing a wide array of developmentally stimulating program opportunities.\\" Ranken Jordan is a pediatric bridge hospital providing a continuum of care for medically complicated children and their families. Programs=Inpatient= Ranken Jordan provides 24-hour nursing care and medical supervision for children who are discharged from full-service tertiary care hospitals and are too ill to return home. They provide care for technologically dependent children and patients with high rehabilitative care needs. =Outpatient= This program provides physical, occupational, and speech therapy through an interdisciplinary approach for children who no longer require 24-hour care, yet still need individualized rehabilitation. In 2004, 1,926 quarter-hour sessions of outpatient rehab were provided. =Day treatment= The Day Treatment Program provides intensive therapy services, developmental intervention and caregiver education in an interdisciplinary model to meet the rehabilitative needs of children with medical and physical challenges. The goal is to increase independent function and to assist children in reaching their maximum potential and to transition back into their community. =Art therapy= The Kodner Gallery Art Therapy Program includes many important elements for a medically challenged child's development: muscular (physical) coordination, sensory stimulation, educational appreciation of art and emerging self-esteem expression. The therapy includes working with nationally known artists. =Pulmonary= Pulmonary Care Services are for children who require specialized pulmonary technology and care. =Brain injury rehabilitation= Focus on cognitive, motor skills, communication, and academic achievement smoothing the child's re-entry into home, school, and community. History Ranken Jordan began as a small facility in St. Louis, Missouri on April 9, 1941 through the philanthropy of founder, Mary Ranken Jordan. It was a small, yet state-of-the-art facility, located in the country. Children came to convalesce from polio, osteomyelitis and bone tuberculosis. Located west of Lindbergh Boulevard, the facility had no air conditioning. Many summer nights, the children would sleep on porch roofs, built especially for that purpose. As the children's bodies healed, they went on their way and others arrived to fill the beds. Mary Ranken Jordan visited regularly to have tea and talk with the children, all of whom she knew by name. The total expenses for the first year of Ranken Jordan were just over $15,100. Sixty-five years later, the average cost to run Ranken Jordan for a single day is $8,200. Mary Ranken-Jordan died in 1962 and left a sizable endowment to maintain her dream.

Groningen only began to grow after 1960. Around that time the East-West Link, a road linking Albina via Paramaribo to Nieuw Nickerie was built. This let Groningen become accessible by road. The town features: an office of the district commissioner; a post office; an office for the police commander, an office of the State health foundation(SZF) and the Eliazer Jaques football stadium, named after the founder of the Football Federation of Saramacca and president. There is also a Moravian Church and a Roman Catholic church. Until 1990, Groningen maintained a nursing home for yaws sufferers. In that year it was closed after it was discovered that the disease could be cured within days by applying Salvarsan.  History  A pentagonal fort was built on this site in 1790, which was named by Governor Jan Gerhard Wichers, after his birthplace in Groningen, Groningen. Across the river was a leper colony by the name of Voorzorg, meaning 'precaution'. Fort Groningen was part of a cordon of forts. However the fort itself had only a few plantations and therefore was not very developed. There were plans to expand the fort and build a town that would be called Columbia, however not much more than the fort itself, a few blocks, a cemetery and an 1830s Moravian Church was ever built. During his time as a soldier in Suriname (1836‚Äì1842), August Kappler described the area, and notes about Groningen that \\"besides the main point and houses, one searches in vain.\\"  Colonisation attempt  At the end of 1845 the survivors of a group of Dutch farmers, led by Pastor Arend van den Brandhof, arrived in Groningen. They emigrated to Suriname from the Dutch province of Groningen to help build a new life on the other side of the Saramacca River. Within six months nearly two hundred people had died of typhus and/or yellow fever and the remainder resettled across the river in Groningen. Countless other settlers died. From 1849 small groups of survivors began to move to the areas of Kwatta and Uitvlugt near Paramaribo. Colonisation was considered a failure in 1853, when there was a total of 43 people left living in Groningen. The following year their leader, Arend van der Brandhof, departed, heading back to the Netherlands. His wife, Anna Pannekoek, had died in 1845 and been buried in the cemetery in Groningen. Pannekoekstraat, a street running through Groningen, is named after her. When the districts were established in 1863, Groningen became the capital of the Saramacca district. Van den Brandhof's house, now left alone, became the residence of the district commissioner. In 1945 a monument was built to commemorate the presence of the Boeroes in Groningen. It was unveiled on the 20th of June that year. On the 150-year anniversary in 1995, descendants of the Boeroes donated a medical laboratory to Groningen.

It is a teratogen isolated from the corn lily (Veratrum californicum) that causes fatal birth defects. It prevents the embryonic brain from separating into two lobes (an extreme form of holoprosencephaly), which in turn causes the development of a single eye (cyclopia). The chemical was named after this effect, as it was originally noted by Idaho lamb farmers who contacted the US Department of Agriculture after their herds gave birth to cycloptic lambs in 1957. It then took more than a decade to identify the corn lily as the culprit. Later work suggested that different rain patterns caused the sheep to graze differently, impacting the amount of corn lily ingested by pregnant sheep. The poison interrupts the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway during development, thus causing birth defects.  Discovery and naming  In 1957 Idaho sheep ranchers contacted the US Department of Agriculture when their sheep gave birth to lambs with a fatal singular eye deformity. After collecting local flora and feeding it to mice, they struggled to recreate the cyclopia. After a decade of trial and error, they came across wild corn lilies and advised the ranchers to avoid the corn lilies. Cyclopamine was one of three steroidal alkaloids isolated from corn lily, but the only unknown at the time, and it was named after its effects on sheep embryos. Four decades later a team lead by Professor Phillip Beachy related the sonic hedgehog gene to cyclopamine. Upon experimentation, they recreated cyclopia by silencing the sonic hedgehog gene. Professor Beachy then connected their cycloptic results to the cycloptic sheep noted four decades earlier. none  Source and structure  The biosynthesis of cyclopamine begins with cholesterol. A steroid skeleton has a classic 6-member ring, adjacent to another 6, 6, then a five or ‚Äú6-6-6-5‚Äù. Veratrum was determined to contain five types of alkaloids, each of which had a common cholesterol precursor: (1) solanidine alkaloids, (2) verazine alkaloids, (3) vertramine alkaloids, (4) jervine alkaloids, and (5) the cevanine alkaloids. In biosynthesis, Cyclopamine has a solanide (1) precursor, which itself is made from cholesterol. This was determined by initial studies which isolated alkaloids from corn lily (Veratrum californium), and introduced these to embryonic sheep. At the time, jervine was an already known alkaloid which was isolated from corn lily alongside two other alkaloids: the unknown cyclopamine and veratramine; each with different toxicities. Later studies then demonstrated that jervine degraded to cyclopamine upon a Wolff-Kishner reduction, which helped identify the unknown compound. It was also demonstrated that treatment of cyclopamine with a Lewis acid (pH < 2) leads to the production of veratramine. The stomach provides these conditions, and thus only a small amount of cyclopamine passes through the stomach after ingestion. And even though only a small amount of ingested cyclopamine passes the stomach, it remains unaffected afterwards. Veratramine is highly toxic, even if it does not impact development, as it excites the central nervous system and can cause seizures ‚Äì similarly to serotonin. The mechanism for the production of veratramine focuses on the cleavage of a carbon-oxygen bond, which leads to the formation of a new double bond. From there, this ring is almost aromatic. The driving force to become aromatic then pushes an elimination reaction, creating a third double bond and producing aromaticity, as depicted in the figure below. Production of Veratramine from Cyclopamine in stomach conditions.  Mechanism  Cyclopamine impacts embryonic development by hindering the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway. In healthy development, the Shh gene codes for Shh proteins. These proteins have a high affinity for a surface membrane protein called ‚ÄúPatched‚Äù. Upon binding, Shh proteins inhibit Patched. With Patch inhibited, another surface membrane protein called ‚ÄúSmoothened‚Äù may signal further cascades which impact development. Cyclopamine has a high affinity for Smoothened ‚Äì and upon binding, inhibits the signal. Even though Shh may inhibit Patched, Smoothened cannot signal in the presence of Cyclopamine and thus the pathway is interrupted.  Embryological  Cyclopamine causes the most advanced form of holoprosencephaly. Because it blocks Shh signaling, the embryonic brain no longer divides into lobes (becomes alobar). Thus, only one optical track develops, hence the cycloptic (singular) eye. Furthermore, this disease is fatal and presently has no cure. In this figure, the healthy brain has two lobes whereas the severe state of holoprosencephaly is alobar (has no lobes). One can imagine one half of the healthy brain not dividing, but instead growing out and resembling the alobar brain. This occurs in cases of cyclopamine poisoning. This malformation is always fatal, and it is worth noting that there are lesser cases of holoprosencephaly that aren't always fatal. However, embryonic cyclopamine poisoning causes the most extreme and therefore fatal cases.  Medical potential  Cyclopamine is currently being investigated as a treatment agent in basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma, tumors that commonly result from excessive SHh activity, glioblastoma, and as a treatment agent for multiple myeloma. For example, studies of epithelial cancers have demonstrated that tumor cells secrete Shh ligand to signal adjacent growth factors production by stromal cells which leads to angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, and tumor cell survival. With this in mind, one can imagine cyclopamine as a way of attenuating cancer‚Äôs mechanism. However, while cyclopamine has been demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth in mouse xenograft models, it never reached therapeutic potential as it caused many side effects including weight loss, dehydration, and death in mouse models. Having said that, two functional analogs of cyclopamine have been approved by the FDA; vismodegib in 2012, and sonidegib in 2015. Furthermore, vismodegib was the first Shh pathway drug approved for treating cancer. While cyclopamine and vismodegib do not appear very similar, the development of vismodegib revealed which aspects of cyclopamine give it functionality and used those results to make vismodegib. For example, the added chlorine group in Vismodegib gives the drug a much higher solubility than cyclopamine ‚Äì low solubility is a hindrance towards making cyclopamine a practical drug. The development of vismodegib revealed structure activity relationships (SAR), and determined that hydrogen bonding in two sites, as well as solubility, impact the effectiveness of the drug. Specifically speaking, the two hydrogen bonds work in opposite ways; at one site a tyrosine residue on the Smoothened receptor offers a proton to be accepted whereas a separate arginine residue works as a hydrogen bond acceptor. While the accepting group is more impactful, having both makes for stronger binding. none  See also  * Saridegib (also known as IPI-926), a semisynthetic analog of cyclopamine * Vismodegib, an artificial Hh signaling inhibitor * Sonidegib, an artificial Hh signaling inhibitor * Steroidal alkaloid, the family of molecules cyclopamine falls in  References  Further reading   Cancer Drug Behind Cyclops Birth?, Wired News   * Category:Jervines Category:Teratogens Category:Spiro compounds Category:Secondary alcohols Category:Nitrogen heterocycles Category:Oxygen heterocycles Category:Plant toxins ","title":"Cyclopamine"},{"id":"3948003","text":"Chojnik Castle (pronounced , , 1945‚Äì1948 ) is a castle located above the town of Sobiesz√≥w, today part of Jelenia G√≥ra in southwestern Poland. Its remains stand on top of the Chojnik hill () within the Karkonosze National Park, overlooking the Jelenia G√≥ra valley. The building of the fortress dates back to the times of the Silesian Piasts and for most of its time was in the possession of the Schaffgotsch noble family. Today the semi-ruined stronghold is a major tourist attraction and houses a hotel and a restaurant.  History  The castle of Chojnik was originally raised by the order of Duke Bolko I the Strict in 1292 at the site of a former hunting lodge built by his father Boles≈Çaw II the Bald. The fortress was meant to protect the borders of Bolko's Duchy of Jawor against the menacing Wenceslaus II of Bohemia. Bolko's grandson Bolko II the Small, the last independent Piast duke, had the castle reconstructed starting from 1355. After Bolko II had died without issue in 1368, his widow Agnes von Habsburg sold the castle to one of the courtiers, the knight Gotsche Schoff. Gotsche II Schoff modernized and expanded the castle in 1393. In the same year he donated the Gothic chapel, which was completed in 1403. The chapel devoted to Saint Catherine and Saint George featured artful paintings preserved until World War II. The castle survived the next centuries without damages. It withstood the attacks by the Hussites in 1426 and by King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, who after his campaign of 1469 destroyed many Silesian castles. In 1529 Ulrich I von Schaffgotsch expanded the building with two forecourts, depots and a pillory, and at the end of the 16th century Renaissance modifications were carried out. Lithography of Chojnik Castle from the beginning of the 19th century During the Thirty Years' War Hans Ulrich von Schaffgotsch, Lord of Kynast - though a Protestant - after the 1620 Battle of White Mountain supported Emperor Ferdinand II and served as a general in the Imperial army under Albrecht von Wallenstein. After Wallenstein's persecution and assassination in 1634 Schaffgotsch as his liegeman was arrested, accused of high treason and executed one year later. Ferdinand II seized his property and had Kynast castle occupied by his troops, who resisted the attacks of the Swedish forces. Ferdinand III added new bastions to the castle in 1648 and finally restituted it to Christoph Leopold von Schaffgotsch, Hans Ulrich's son, in 1650. Still during the latter's lifetime, in 1675, the castle that has never been conquered burnt down completely after being struck by lightning and was not reconstructed. The comital family relocated down into the valley to the old palace of Warmbrunn (today Cieplice ≈ölƒÖskie-Zdr√≥j) and the destroyed castle became a tourist attraction already in the early 18th century. It was visited by the Prussian royal family and poets like Heinrich von Kleist and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe as well as Theodor K√∂rner, who immortalized the ruin in one of his poems and made it famous all over Germany. In 1822, the Schaffgotschs added a tavern and harbourage to the castle and three years later rebuilt the tower. In the 1920s the old legends were resuscitated by Waldemar M√ºller-Erhardt, and in the next years these folk plays were performed there. The ruins remained in the property of the Schaffgotsch dynasty until in 1945 the family was expelled. In 1964 the Polish state restored the ruins and rebuilt the mountain hut. Kunegunda legend The ruins of Chojnik are tied to the myth of Kunegunda, a castle lord's daughter desired by many knights. As she had no intention to enter into marriage she promised to espouse the bold man who would complete a circuit along the castle's walls on a horseback, knowing that on the steep slopes horse and rider must fall into the chasm. Many tried and perished until a proud nobleman came along, who appealed to Kunegunda's eyes. Though she declared to abandon the precondition and to marry him right away, the knight insisted to take the risk and he succeeded. Instead of accepting her proposal he scolded her for her cruelty and departed. Kunegunda however, deeply humiliated, lunged into the abyss herself.

Fausto ZeviFausto Zevi, \\"I consoli del 97 d. Cr. in due framenti gia' editi dei Fasti Ostienses\\", Listy filologick√© / Folia philologica, 96 (1973), pp. 125-137 postulated that he was also suffect consul in 97, based on a plausible restoration of part of the Fasti Ostienses, which reads \\"..]us\\". However, two more recently recovered fragments of military diplomas show that the name of this consul is L. Pomponius Maternus, who is otherwise unknown.Werner Eck and Pangerl, \\"Zwei Konstitutionen f√ºr die Truppen Niederm√∂siens vom 9. September 97\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 151 (2005), pp. 185-192 Most authorities have returned to endorsing C.P. Jones' surmise that Sura was consul for the first time as a suffect consul in the year 93.Jones, \\"Sura and Senecio\\", Journal of Roman Studies, 60 (1970), pp. 98-104 He was a correspondent of Pliny the Younger.  Life  He was mentioned by a number of contemporary writers, who provide hints about his personality. The earliest mention of Sura are in three of Martial's epigrams. In the first (I.49), addressed to Licinianus of Bilbilis in 85/86, Sura is described as wealthy. The second (VI.64) is published in 89/90, wherein Martial defends his trifles against criticism by appealing to the highest authorities, who include, besides Sura, Silius Italicus, consul in 68, Marcus Aquilius Regulus, and the emperor himself. The third, dated to the year 92, congratulates Sura on recovering from a serious illness (VII.47); Ronald Syme speculates that Sura was one of the victims of an epidemic that followed one of the Dacian Wars.Syme, Some Arval Brethren, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980), p. 22 Arrian, in his Life of Epictetus, has the title character refer to a rich catamite belonging to Sura.Arrian, Diss. Epict. 3, 17, 4 A third writer is Pliny the Younger, who addressed two letters to Sura on scientific matters.Pliny, Epistulae IV.30; VII.27 Licinius Sura was a close and trusted companion of the emperor Trajan, and Cassius Dio tells how Trajan proved his fidelity: one day, without prior notice, he went to Sura's house; then, after dismissing his bodyguard, Trajan bathed, had Sura shave him, and dined with him. The following day he said to those who had disparaged Sura: \\"If Sura had desired to kill me, he would have killed me yesterday.\\"Dio, LXVIII.15f How Sura came to be a trusted companion is unclear. Edmund Groag surmised that it was Sura who suggested Trajan's name as an heir to the emperor Nerva after the latter was confronted by a mutiny by the Praetorian Guard.Groag, Realencyclop√§die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft, 13 (1926), col. 472 However, this view has been challenged: when discussing the details of Nerva's choice of Trajan as an heir, John D. Grainger simply omits all mention of Groag's theory.Grainger, Nerva and the Roman Succession Crisis of AD 96-99 (London: Routledge, 2003), pp. 89-102 Werner Eck notes that Sura was governor of Germania Inferior from the year 96 to 98;Werner Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), pp. 326-328 Nerva announced his choice of an heir in October 97. During the first campaign against the Dacians, after the Second Battle of Tapae, Trajan dispatched Sura and Tiberius Claudius Livianus to negotiate peace with the Dacian king Decebalus. Nothing was accomplished, since Decebalus did not meet them, but sent envoys instead on this occasion. Nevertheless, because the Romans captured key strongpoints in the mountains and Decebalus' sister was captured, the Dacians agreed to the terms the Romans demanded and peace was agreed to between the Romans and Dacians.Dio, LXVIII.9 For this, Sura was appointed to a second consulate as consul ordinarius in 102 as the colleague of Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus.Alison E. Cooley, The Cambridge Manual of Latin Epigraphy (Cambridge: University Press, 2012), p. 467 He also participated in Trajan's second campaign against the Dacians; while his role in that war is undetermined, it was important enough for Sura to be awarded triumphal ornaments and a third consulate in 107 with Quintus Sosius Senecio as his colleague.Cooley, Cambridge Manual, p. 468 Sura vanishes from the public record after his third consulate; Syme believes he died in 108. According to Cassius Dio, Trajan gave him a public funeral and had a statue erected in Sura's memory.Dio, LXVIII.15.3  See also  * Licinia * Baths of Licinius Sura  References  Licinius Sura Category:Roman governors of Germania Inferior Sura, Lucius Category:Romans from Hispania Category:1st- century Romans Category:2nd-century Romans Category:1st-century births Category:2nd-century deaths ","title":"Lucius Licinius Sura"},{"id":"3948030","text":"Angry Youth Comix is an adult humor comic-book written and drawn by Johnny Ryan.

It is the only other state highway beside NY 7 to completely cross the state, from border to border, in an east-west direction, although NY 17 does so and is partially east-west. It also forms a concurrency when it joins US 44 for 33 miles (53 km). Together with NY 52, which it closely parallels and briefly joins in downtown Liberty, it forms the latitudinal backbone of the Hudson Valley region for non-interstate traffic. It offers the traveler a wide variety of landscapes, from farmlands, mountains and forests to the urban center of Poughkeepsie. Sights along the way include two of New York City's major reservoirs in the Catskills, a dramatic crossing of the Shawangunk Ridge, and the Mid-Hudson Bridge. Route description= Sullivan County = Barryville to Swan Lake  NY 55 begins at a junction with NY 97 at the shore of the Delaware River in the hamlet of Barryville. South of this junction, the right-of-way connects to the Barryville-Shohola Bridge, which connects to PA 434 in the municipality of Shohola Township. Crossing past the former terminus of County Route 11A (CR 11A; named River Road), NY 55 proceeds north out of Barryville through the town of Highland, maintained by Sullivan County as CR 11\\\\. NY 55 and CR 11 proceed northeast through the woods above the Delaware, reaching a small residential area near Old Brook Road. NY 55 and CR 11 wind northeast through Highland for several miles, soon turning northward past multiple residences before winding northeast into the hamlet of Eldred. NY 55 serves as the main north-south road through Eldred, crossing a junction with CR 32 (Proctor Road) and CR 33 (Eldred-Yulan Road). Soon passing the Eldred Central School, NY 55 continues northeast through Highland, now co- designated as CR 12\\\\. At Stege Road, NY 55 and CR 12 bend north past residences overlooking Steges Pond. The route soon becomes more wooded in nature, paralleling the western shore of the pond, and turns northwest past Sunrise Lake. Beginning to wind to the north, NY 55 and CR 12 pass more residences and continue north through Highland. After a couple more turns, the routes leave the town of Highland for the town of Bethel, where the route turns northeast, passing Toronto Lake at a junction with CR 26 (Crystal Lake Road). At this junction, the co-designation changes once again as NY 55 becomes concurrent with CR 13 as it passes the Toronto Reservoir. Winding out of the reservoir area, NY 55 and CR 13 pass multiple homes as the route passes through the hamlet of Black Lake. Passing the namesake body of water, NY 55 and CR 13 bend northeast and soon northward past numerous homes for several miles. A short distance later, the routes reach a junction with NY 17B. At this junction, NY 17B and NY 55 become concurrent (and maintained by NYSDOT). NY 17B and NY 55 proceed eastward through the town of Bethel, running along the southern shore of White Lake, passing numerous lakeside residences. A short distance later, the routes reach the hamlet of White Lake, coming to an intersection with CR 14\\\\. At this junction, NY 55 turns north onto CR 14, and the routes continue through White Lake as a two-lane residential road. At Lake Street, NY 55 and CR 14 turn northwest for several blocks, soon reaching a junction with CR 141\\\\. At this junction, the routes turn north on Swan Lake Drive, while CR 141 connects west to West Shore Road, the latter of which services the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, the site of Woodstock in 1969. NY 55 and CR 14 begin winding northeast through Bethel, leaving the hamlet of White Lake and soon reaching a junction with CR 183 (Airport Road). At this junction, NY 55 and CR 14 run along the northern ends of Sullivan County International Airport. The routes soon turn north, crossing Old White Lake Turnpike at the end of the airport. Paralleling the West Branch of the Mongaup River, NY 55 and CR 14 pass Woods, Pauls and Wheelers ponds before reaching the hamlet of Swan Lake. Now in the town of Liberty, NY 55 reaches a junction with CR 74 (Stanton Corners Road), where it continues north through Swan Lake co-designated with CR 15.  Swan Lake to the Rondout Reservoir  Just north of CR 74, NY 55 and CR 15 cross a junction with the eastern terminus of CR 142 (Briscoe Road). Crossing over the namesake lake, NY 55 and CR 15 soon leave the hamlet of Swan Lake, passing Fieldston Lake and multiple residences as they proceed eastward. Passing Lake Barnabee, the routes turn northeast again, crossing a junction with CR 71 (Ferndale Road). Continuing north through the town of Liberty, NY 55 and CR 15 soon reach the village of Liberty. At the village line, CR 15 terminates while NY 55 continues as Swan Lake Road and turns eastward on West Lake Street. At Carrier Street, NY 55 turns northeast and crosses into the commercial center of Liberty as Lake Street, coming to a junction with NY 52 (South Main Street). NY 52 and NY 55 become concurrent through the village of Liberty, proceeding southeast to become Mill Street. Reaching a roundabout, NY 55 forks off of NY 52 and onto Neversink Road, which becomes concurrent with CR 16 at the village line. NY 55 and CR 16 parallel the Middle Mongaup River, entering an interchange with NY 17 (the Quickway; exit 100A). After NY 17, NY 55 and CR 16 cross the Middle Mongaup and wind eastward through the town of Liberty. At the junction with Clements Road, the routes turn northeast through a rural section of Liberty, soon reaching a junction with Kees Lake. The routes bend eastward past Kees Lake, passing some local residences before crossing into the town of Fallsburg. Past Grants Road, NY 55 and CR 16 cross east through the hamlet of Bradley, soon crossing into the town of Neversink. At the junction with Aden Road, CR 16 terminates. NY 55 along the dam at the Neversink Reservoir NY 55, state-maintained again, bends southeast through Neversink, soon reaching the southern shores of the Neversink Reservoir, one of the reservoirs that serve New York City. Continuing eastward, the route reaches the southernmost point of the reservoir and a junction with CR 105 (Divine Corners Road), which connects to Loch Sheldrake. At this junction, NY 55 continues northeast along the southeastern shores of the reservoir. Crossing the spillway for the reservoir, NY 55 runs northeast into a junction with CR 105A (Hasbrouck Road). Turning away from the Neversink, the route winds north and soon northeast into the hamlet of Neversink. At the junction with Wilson Shields Road, NY 55 becomes concurrent with CR 17, crossing through the center of the hamlet. The residential hamlet of Neversink soon is left behind by NY 55 and CR 17, continuing northeast through the namesake town. Just northeast of the junction with Myers Road, NY 55 and CR 17 cross into the Catskill Forest Preserve. Continuing past a junction with Benton Hollow Road, the route soon bends eastward through Neversink, reaching a junction with Wagner Road, where CR 17 terminates. NY 55 continues eastward alone along Neversink Road, maintained by NYSDOT once more. After a bend to the northeast, the route reaches the hamlet of Curry, where it junctions with CR 19, which connects to the Ulster County line via CR 157\\\\. Passing the Chestnut Creek Covered Bridge nearby, NY 55 quickly leaves Curry and bends southeast through the hamlet of Unionville. Signage along NY 55 in Curry with a reassurance marker for NY 42, giving the false impression that an overlap still exists between the two routes After crossing through the small residential hamlet, NY 55 winds southeast, passing the Grahamsville Fairgrounds and changes names to Main Street as the route enters Grahamsville. Bending southeast through Grahamsville, the route crosses past multiple residences and soon the commercial center. At the center of Grahamsville, NY 55 reaches a junction with the northern terminus of the southern segment of NY 42\\\\. Continuing eastward out of Grahamsville, the route parallels Chestnut Creek and passing Grahamsville Rural Cemetery. Passing the local high school, NY 55 reaches a junction with the western terminus of NY 55A at the westernmost point of the Rondout Reservoir. NY 55 runs along the southern shore of the Rondout, a two-lane woods road running southeast through the town of Neversink. Continuing southeast along the reservoir's southern shore, NY 55 passes a lone house looking over the reservoir and reaches the Ulster County line. = Ulster County = Wawarsing to Tuthilltown  Now in the town of Wawarsing, NY 55 continues southeast along the southern shore of the Rondout Reservoir. Paralleling the widest points of the reservoir, the route makes a gradual bend to the northeast, leaving the Catskill Forest Preserve. Continuing along the shoreline, the route crosses through the dense woods. At the junction with Porter Road, NY 55 reaches Merriman Dam, the dam that runs the control of water for the Rondout. This junction marks the eastern end of the reservoir, which continues east as Rondout Creek. NY 55 then turns south, reaching a junction with the eastern terminus of NY 55A. Crossing back into the Catskills for a moment, NY 55 soon reaches the hamlet of Lackawack. After a southwestern bend, the route turns southeast and leaves the park for the final time. Paralleling Rondout Creek, NY 55 crosses past multiple residences in Wawarsing, soon bending eastward past Bennett Road. Paralleling Sportsman Road, NY 55 turns southeast along the Rondout, soon reaching the hamlet of Honk Hill. Through Honk Hill, NY 55 turns south again, passing Honk Lake, where it turns southwest out of the hamlet. Turning southeast again, the route crosses over Rondout Creek again, reaching the hamlet of Napanoch. Through Napanoch, NY 55 is a two-lane residential street, soon turning south along Rondout Creek into a junction with US 209\\\\. At the junction with US 209, NY 55 becomes concurrent with the U.S. route northeast through Wawarsing, bypassing the hamlet of Napanoch and crossing a junction with CR 128 (Plank Road / Institution Road). CR 128 connects to two local New York State Department of Corrections facilities. alt=A two-lane road gently curves upward from the picture into a wooded area at right. Beyond is a line of distant mountains, green under a blue sky US 209 and NY 55 continue north through the hamlet of East Wawarsing, passing multiple old alignments of US 209 through the hamlet of Wawarsing. Winding northeast, US 209 and NY 55 pass multiple residential areas before reaching a more rural section of the town, paralleling Rondout Creek eastward into the hamlet of Kerhonkson. In Kerhonkson, US 209 and NY 55 reach a junction with the western terminus of US 44\\\\. At this junction, NY 55 turns east on a concurrency with US 44, crossing over Rondout Creek once again. US 44 and NY 55 wind eastward through Wawarsing, reaching a junction with the southern end of CR 77. Crossing southeast into the town of Rochester, US 44 and NY 55 reach a junction with CR 27 (Upper Granite Road), where the routes turn south along or near the town line. The routes soon make a gradual bend to the northeast, crossing multiple residences as the route enters the Minnewaska State Park Preserve. Crossing through the dense woods of the park, US 44 and NY 55 continue eastward, southward and southeastward past multiple entrances to sections of the park, crossing a junction with Milbrook Mountain Road, where the routes soon reach the eastern ends of the park. Crossing into the hamlet of Lake Minnewaska, US 44 and NY 55 cross Trapps Road (which connects to the Trapps Bridge), make another southeast to northeast bend and cross a junction with Clove Road. The hairpin turn near the Mohonk Preserve along US 44 and NY 55 in Gardiner After Clove Road, US 44 and NY 55 become a two-lane road along the slopes of the Shawangunk Mountains, passing a local overlook before reaching the hairpin turn in the town of Gardiner. At this hairpin turn, US 44 and NY 55 turn southwest, winding past multiple homes before turning southeast past a junction with the western terminus of NY 299\\\\. Continuing south away from the Shawangunks, the routes cross North Mountain Road and make a bend to the southeast, reaching a junction with CR 7 at the hamlet of Benton Corners. After Benton Corners, US 44 and NY 55 continue southeast through the town of Gardiner, reaching the hamlet of Tuthilltown and a junction with CR 9.  Tuthilltown to the Mid-Hudson Bridge  Paralleling the Shawangunk Kill, US 44 and NY 55 soon reach the Wallkill River and cross it into the small hamlet of Tuthill. After a short bend to the southeast, the routes enter the hamlet of Gardiner. Now known as Main Street, the routes cross through the center of the hamlet, crossing a junction with CR 19 (Sand Hill Road). Leaving the hamlet of Gardiner, the routes soon reach the hamlet of Ireland Corners, where they meet at a junction with NY 208\\\\. East of NY 208, the routes continue east through the rural sections of Gardiner before crossing into the town of Plattekill. Soon after, the routes reach the hamlet of Modena. In Modena, US 44 and NY 55 junction with NY 32 (Main Street) in the center of the hamlet. Apple orchards along US 44 and NY 55 between Ardonia and Clintondale Leaving Modena, US 44 and NY 55 turn northeast through Plattekill, passing multiple residences and cross under the New York State Thruway (I-87). Just east of the Thruway, the routes cross the northern terminus of CR 13 and soon reach the hamlet of Ardonia. At Ardonia, US 44 and NY 55 turn northeast at a junction with CR 10 (Milton Turnpike). North of Ardonia, the routes cross into the town of Lloyd, soon bending eastward into the hamlet of Clintondale. Passing numerous farms west of Clintondale, US 44 and NY 55 cross a junction with CR 22 (South Street) and through the residential hamlet. The routes soon cross back into the town of Plattekill, passing multiple residences along an eastward stretch near the Pancake Hollow Brook. At the junction with Jenkins Lane, the routes make a dart to the northeast and east, reaching a junction with CR 15 (Tuckers Corners Road). Crossing past several ponds, CR 15 forks off again at the junction with Pancake Hollow Road before US 44 and NY 55 reach the hamlet of Baileys Gap. Just east of Baileys Gap, US 44 and NY 55 cross into the town of Marlborough, reaching a junction with Baileys Gap Road, where they cross back into the town of Lloyd and gain the name Vineyard Avenue. A short distance later, the routes a small residential area and cross a junction with CR 11, which forks off again a short distance later. US 44 and NY 55 continue north along Vineyard Avenue, passing The Highland Cemetery and entering the hamlet of Highland. Crossing through the commercial center of Highland, the routes cross a junction with CR 12 (Vineyard Avenue). At this junction, US 44 and NY 55 turn south and connect to a junction with US 9W. US 9W, US 44 and NY 55 continue south for a distance concurrent together, passing a junction with Haviland Avenue, which connects to the Poughkeepsie Bridge before reaching an interchange, where US 44 and NY 55 turn east and reach the on-ramps to the Mid-Hudson Bridge. Crossing through the toll barrier, bending southward as it reaches the bridge span, crossing over the CSX West Shore Railroad. At the mid-span of the Mid-Hudson Bridge, US 44 and NY 55 cross into Dutchess County and enter the city of Poughkeepsie. = Dutchess County = The Mid-Hudson Bridge, viewed from the Ulster County side on the Hudson River  Poughkeepsie to Beekman  Now in the city of Poughkeepsie, US 44 and NY 55 continue along the Mid-Hudson Bridge across the Hudson River before crossing over Kaal Rock Park into the city. Crossing over the Metro-North Railroad Hudson Line, the routes pass south of the Poughkeepsie station. Just east of the tracks, US 44 and NY 55 cross through an interchange with both directions of US 9 and gain the name of Church Street. Through Poughkeepsie, the routes serve as an arterial road, soon becoming a divided street, with three lanes of US 44 and NY 55 east running along Church Street and three lanes of US 44 and NY 55 west along Mill Street and Columbus Drive with Main Street and much of downtown Poughkeepsie between them. Along Church Street, US 44 and NY 55 cross through the city center, passing multiple city locations, including the Central Business District and the New York State Armory. The westbound US 44 and NY 55 arterial passes other notable locations such as the old Poughkeepsie Almshouse, the current city hall, the Mid-Hudson Civic Center, Poughkeepsie Grand Hotel, and also passes over the Fall Kill. The eastbound route soon passes south of Reservoir Square Park (with the westbound route passing it on the north) and both directions continue as arterial roads through Poughkeepsie. Just east of May Street, US 44 and NY 55 turn southeast along West Baker Street, crossing multiple residential streets, soon crossing into the Arlington district, located in the Town of Poughkeepsie. The routes cross past the junction with the southern end of NY 115 (Worrall Avenue). Several blocks eastward, the routes soon cross a junction with NY 376 (Raymond Avenue), which terminates just to the north at the westbound lanes. A couple blocks south of the junction on NY 376 is the main campus of Vassar College. Continuing east along Haight Avenue, US 44 and NY 55 soon meet up with the westbound lanes, which also marks the eastern terminus of the concurrency with US 44 as NY 55 forks to the southeast. NY 55, now a four-lane boulevard, runs southeast through the Arlington district, becoming known as Manchester Road. The route passes north of the Vassar Golf Course before turning east into the town of LaGrange. In the town of LaGrange, the route crosses through the hamlet of Manchester Bridge, where it passes under the Dutchess Rail Trail and then over Wappinger Creek before it junctions with CR 46 (Overlook Road) and CR 49 (Old Manchester Road). The route soon thins out to a two-lane roadway, changing names to Freedom Plains Road as it bends to the southeast and soon east past the other terminus of CR 49 (Titusville Road). NY 55 continues winding eastward through LaGrange, beginning to become more rural, reaching a junction with the southern terminus of CR 47 (Freedom Road). East of CR 47, the route crosses into the hamlet of Freedom Plains, soon leaving the hamlet for an interchange with the Taconic State Parkway. The route soon crosses over Sprout Creek and becomes a two-lane commercial/rural road through LaGrange, reaching the hamlet of Billings, where it junctions with NY 82\\\\. After Billings, NY 55 proceeds southeast through LaGrange, soon reaching the town line and crossing into the town of Union Vale. The route through Union Vale is short, marked mostly by an intersection with CR 21 (East Noxon Road / Bruzgul Road). After CR 21, NY 55 continues southeast through Union Vale, soon reaching the town line again and crossing into the town of Beekman. NY 55 continues southeast through Beekman, crossing through the rural sections of Dutchess County, soon reaching the hamlet of Poughquag. At Poughquag, NY 55 crosses a junction with CR 9 (Clove Valley Road). Through Poughquag, the route is mainly residential, soon bending southward then southeast along Whaley Lake Stream into a junction with the eastern terminus of NY 216\\\\. Just east of that junction, NY 55 meets CR 32 and parallels the Whaley Lake Stream through the town of Beekman. Paralleling an old alignment of itself, NY 55 soon reaches a junction with the northern terminus of NY 292 as it enters the town of Pawling. alt=A straight two-lane road with trees on either side leading off into the distance toward a ridge  Pawling to the CT state line  Now in Pawling, NY 55 continues southeast on a parallel of the Housatonic Railroad and the Whaley Lake Stream, bypassing the hamlet of Woodinville. After making a gradual bend to the southeast and soon to the east, NY 55 becomes more residential as it approaches the village of Pawling. The route soon parallels CR 69, which is disconnected at NY 55\\\\. The route then crosses over the East Branch of the Croton River and the Metro-North Railroad Harlem Line, passing south of the Pawling station, which is connected via CR 69\\\\. A couple blocks east of the tracks, NY 55 enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with NY 22. NY 22 and NY 55 become concurrent through the village of Pawling, passing the Dutcher Golf Course and bypassing the center of the village. Passing the Pawling High School at Reservoir Road, NY 22 and NY 55 leave the village of Pawling and continue north through the namesake town. Paralleling the tracks of the Harlem Line, NY 22 and NY 55 cross through the hamlet of Hurd Corners, junction with the western end of CR 68\\\\. Just north of CR 68, the routes cross the Appalachian Trail at the site of the Appalachian Trail station. Continuing north through the town of Pawling, the routes parallel the tracks and the Swamp River before crossing into the town of Dover. Through Dover, NY 22 and NY 55 become a residential two-lane road, passing the Harlem Valley-Wingdale station and the Harlem Valley Golf Club. The routes soon reach the hamlet of Wingdale, where NY 22 forks to the north while NY 55 heads northeast past Thomas J. Boyce Park. Following an old alignment of NY 22, NY 55 soon turns east at a junction with CR 6 in the hamlet of Webatuck. Along the eastern stretch, NY 55 crosses through the dense woods of Webatuck and pass a junction with the southern terminus of CR 22 (Dogtail Corners Road). After CR 22, NY 55 turns to the southeast at Old Forge Road, passing Duell Hollow Brook and turning eastward after crossing the brook. Just after the junction with Hoyt Road, NY 55 makes a turn to the northeast and crosses the state line into Connecticut. The route continues east as CT 55, connecting to US 7 at Gaylordsville, Connecticut. History=Origins= The portion of modern NY 55 in Ulster County from the intersection with CR 7 west of Gardiner to U.S. Route 9W (US 9W) follows the Farmers' Turnpike, which was built by the Farmer's Turnpike & Bridge Company, a private company established in March 1808. Its purpose was to allow the transport of agricultural products from the Gardiner area to docks on the Hudson River at Milton. The route at that time followed the north end of Albany Post Road (CR 9) over the Shawangunk Kill and then east along the kill's south bank to ford the Wallkill River just south of the confluence. The turnpike company eventually went bankrupt. The exit for US 44/NY 55 for the Mid-Hudson Bridge from US 9\\\\. In the early 1910s, the state of New York improved the former turnpike to state highway standards at a cost of just over $172,868 (equivalent to $ in ). The section from the Plattekill‚ÄìLloyd town line north of Ardonia to what is now US 9W was added to the state highway system on September 9, 1911, as State Highway 350 (SH 350) while the portion from modern CR 7 to the west end of SH 350 was accepted into the state highway system on October 20, 1913, as SH 351\\\\. Both designations were assigned by the New York State Legislature for inventory purposes and were unsigned. In 1908, the legislature created a statewide system of unsigned legislative routes. No designation was assigned to most of the modern NY 55 corridor; however, the section of highway that NY 55 now shares with NY 22 from Pawling to Wingdale was designated as part of Route 1, a route extending from New York City to Albany. On March 1, 1921, the segment of NY 55 that overlaps with US 209 in Wawarsing was included in Route 40, a new route that generally followed the modern US 209 corridor between Port Jervis and Kingston. =Designation= NY 55's westbound exit from NY 17, merged with NY 52\\\\. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, much of legislative Route 1‚Äîincluding from Pawling to Wingdale‚Äîwas designated as part of NY 22. By 1926, all of legislative Route 40 was designated as NY 50 while a small portion of modern NY 55 between what is now NY 216 and NY 292 near Poughquag was signed as part of NY 39. NY 50 became part of US 6 in 1927. Over the next eight years, the highway went through several designations, becoming US 6N in 1928, NY 279 in 1933 and US 209 . NY 39 was reassigned to another highway in western New York in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the same time, NY 55 was assigned to much of its current alignment between Barryville and Pawling, utilizing the old Farmers' Turnpike in eastern Ulster County and a series of previously unnumbered roads in Sullivan, western Ulster, and Dutchess counties. From Poughquag to West Pawling, NY 55 overlapped with NY 52, which replaced NY 39 east of East Fishkill. Initially, NY 55 continued east from Pawling to the Connecticut state line at Sherman via Quaker Hill and Kirby Hill roads. In the early 1930s, the modern routing of NY 55 between Wingdale and the Connecticut border was designated as NY 341. The alignments of NY 55 and NY 341 east of NY 22 were flipped , placing NY 55 on its current alignment and NY 341 on NY 55's old routing. NY 55 reached Wingdale by way of a overlap with NY 22. When NY 55 was first assigned, it was routed along the northern bank of Rondout Creek between the hamlets of Grahamsville and Lackawack. In the mid-1940s, NY 55 was realigned to follow a new highway along the southern bank while its former routing to the north became NY 55A. Both changes were made in order to accommodate the Rondout Reservoir, which was created following the construction of the Merriman Dam. =Recent construction= The steel truss bridge located near the eastern side of the Roundout Reservoir and the junction with NY 55A was rehabilitated in 2010. The existing reinforced concrete deck was removed, shear studs were installed (there were no shear studs on the steel beams previously), and a new reinforced concrete deck was installed. The reinforced concrete piers were also repaired with concrete after sounding inspections. Care was taken not to introduce concrete debris into the Rondout Creek during concrete removal. The southern portion of NY 55 around the Rondout Reservoir was closed during this period. NY 55A right NY 55A () is an alternate route of NY 55 along the north side of the Rondout Reservoir between Grahamsville and Napanoch. It was assigned in the mid-1940s.

Cheyney is perhaps best known for his short stories and novels about agent/detective Lemmy Caution, which, starting in 1953, were adapted into a series of French movies, all starring Eddie Constantine (however, the best known of these ‚Äì the 1965 science fiction film Alphaville ‚Äì was not directly based on a Cheyney novel). Although out of print for many years, Cheyney's novels have never been difficult to find second-hand. Several of them have recently been made available as e-books. Early life Peter Cheyney was born in Whitechapel 1896, the youngest of five children, and educated at the Mercers' School in the City of London. He began to write skits for the theatre as a teenager, but this ended when the First World War began. In 1915 he enlisted in the British Army as a volunteer, in 1916 was wounded on active service and published two volumes of poetry, Poems of Love and War and To Corona and Other Poems. The next year, 1917, his military service ended. Starting in the late 1920s, Cheyney worked for the Metropolitan Police as a police reporter and crime investigator. Until he became successful as a crime novelist, he was often quite poor. It is said that he got his start through a bet; when Cheyney remarked that anyone could write a book in the idiom of the American thriller, he was wagered five pounds that he could not. Cheyney sold his first story as the result of this bet. Career and characters Cheyney wrote his first novel, the Lemmy Caution thriller This Man Is Dangerous in 1936 and followed it with the first Slim Callaghan novel, The Urgent Hangman in 1938. The immediate success of these two novels assured him of a flourishing new career, and Cheyney abandoned his work as a freelance investigator. Sales were brisk; in 1946 alone, 1,524,785 copies of Cheyney books were sold worldwide. A meticulous researcher, Cheyney kept a massive set of files on criminal activity in London, but these were destroyed during the Blitz in 1941; he however, soon began to replace his collection of clippings. Cheyney dictated his work. Typically Cheyney would \\"act out\\" his stories for his secretary, Miss Sprauge, who would copy them down in shorthand and type them up later. The Caution books read very much like what they are: pulp stories written in ersatz American by a British writer. With the private detective Slim Callaghan however, he invented a non-American who is based in Cheyney's home territory of London. Callaghan in the first book works from Chancery Lane in a Marlowe-type shabby office and he has difficulty paying the bills. However, unlike Marlowe, Callaghan is ambitious and after a success helping a rich female client, he is able to make the step up to having his own agency, with a fancy office and pretty secretary, in swanky Berkeley Square. Subsequent novels in the series follow very much the tried and tested pattern. Callaghan's services are sought by rich and attractive female client. The Lady in question is, of course naturally involved in some upsetting business (often blackmail) that precludes going to police. Callaghan meets the lady, likes what he sees (Cheyney appears to have studied women's fashion for he never fails to describe in detail every lady's clothes and jewellery), is nonchalant and impudent, which simultaneously both upsets and attracts lady. The Lady of course is either afraid to tell all facts or is being deliberately misleading and Callaghan must work out truth for himself. Callaghan begins his investigating, in Marlowe-style, by putting himself about and stirring up trouble, which attracts the attention of a number of people (including at least one shady nightclub owner) involved in the puzzle who supply him with enough pieces to get the whole picture and to plan strategy. During these cases (usually over a period of days) Callaghan will push himself to the limit. He will get no sleep, drink continually ('three fingers of straight whisky'), and drive his Jaguar long distances (to Torquay or Weymouth to visit refined clients, and then back to London all in the same night) as part of his overall plan. At the same time, he will meet s string of attractive women who will, of course, throw themselves at him during the story, but he however only has eyes for his refined client, hand out and receive beatings, tamper with evidence, and outsmart both criminals and the police until the case is solved and his refined client is extricated from trouble and danger. Only then (to the chagrin of his secretary, who has a long-standing crush) will he reap the dual reward of favours from the refined client, accompanied by a substantial checque. The graves of Peter Cheyney and his third wife Lauretta at Putney Vale Cemetery, London, in 2015 Cheyney's \\"Dark\\" series was widely praised during World War II for bringing more realism to espionage fiction. In their casual brutality and general \\"grubbiness,\\" the \\"Dark\\" novels seem to have foreshadowed much of the Cold War fiction of the mid to late 1960s. Anthony Boucher placed these later works in the context of Graham Greene and Joseph Conrad. The characterisation of Ernest Guelvada in the \\"Dark\\" series is one of the high points of Cheyney's career. A cheerfully sadistic war operative whose objective is to deplete the ranks of opposing forces in a leisurely but thorough fashion, the loquacious Guelvada still finds the time to dress immaculately, drink immoderate amounts of alcohol and remain a counter agent. Cheyney published one volume of short stories, advice to critics and a few poems in No Ordinary Cheyney (London: Faber and Faber, 1948). Cheyney makes a cameo appearance in the Dennis Wheatley/J.G. Links \\"dossier\\" mystery \\"Herewith the Clues,\\" published in 1939. Cheyney appears as man-of-fortune William Benson, one of the suspects. Cheyney died at age 55, after having fallen into a coma. He was buried at Putney Vale Cemetery in London. Personal life From all accounts, Cheyney lived much like his characters, working too hard, living the fast and careless life with a breathtaking abandon that eventually caught up with him. In addition to his literary skills, \\"he was a fencer of repute, a golfer, a crack pistol-shot, and a jiu-jitsu expert.\\" Cheyney joined the New Party (set up by Sir Oswald Mosley and precursor to the later British Union of Fascists or BUF) in 1931, heading its youth detachment, which protected public meetings. Cheyney was married three times: in 1919 to the stage actress Dorma Leigh, in 1934 to Kathleen Nora Walter Taberer, and in 1948 to Loretta Theresa Singer. He had no children.

In 1918 George Henry Bonner became the editor. The magazine ceased publication the same year. The Hydra is mentioned in Pat Barker's novel Regeneration about the experiences of patients at Craiglockhart War Hospital during World War I.

Tasby played with the Baltimore Orioles, Boston Red Sox, Washington Senators, and Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball (MLB). Willie was primarily an outfielder, appearing in just two games in the infield in his 583-game career. Career Tasby made his major league debut on September 18, 1958, and played in 18 games for the Orioles at the end of the season. Willie's performance in 1959 was solid as he played 142 games, batted .250 with 13 home runs, while patrolling center field for the Orioles. Baltimore's sixth-place finish in the AL was not impressive, but Tasby's rookie performance was, as he was selected to the inaugural Topps All-Star Rookie Team along with future Hall of Famer Willie McCovey. In 1960, the Orioles were much improved. They contended for the AL pennant until late September. In June, however, with a tenuous hold on first place, they were swept in a four-game series at home by the Detroit Tigers. June 9 was the low point for Tasby, though, as his Orioles lost both ends of a double header to the Tigers and then traded him to the last place Red Sox. Boston plugged Willie right into their lineup, and the center fielder responded with a career-best .281 batting average. Tasby's performance for the Sox garnered some attention as he became an expansion draft selection of the Washington Senators. Washington's opening season showed promise for Tasby. He started in center field for the Senators and hit a career high 17 home runs and collected 63 RBI in 141 games. Unfortunately, it was not as promising as it appeared. After just 11 games in 1962, Willie was traded by the Senators to the Cleveland Indians for a couple of pitchers.

In some jurisdictions, it may serve to amend, rather than replace, a previously executed will. In others, it may serve as an alternative to a will. In still others, there is no recognized distinction between a codicil and a will. Etymology Latin codicillus meaning a short additional text or a small writing tablet. The diminutive of codex see also codeOnline Etymological dictionary  Origins  The concept of a testamentary document is similar to but distinct from a will originated in Roman law. In the pre-classical period, a testator was required to nominate an heir in order for his will to be valid (heredis institutio). Failure to nominate an heir or failure to observe the proper formalities for nomination of an heir resulted in an estate divided pursuant to the rules of intestacy. However, a testator was also able to institute a fideicommissum, a more flexible and less formal indication of the testator's intent, which could have the effect of transferring part or all of his estate after death, although with fewer rights to the beneficiary than those of a nominated heir.Id. at 11‚Äì13 (discussing limited gifts). A codicillus (diminutive of codex) was a written document subject to fewer formal requirements than a will (testamentum) that, in its initial use, could supplement or amend an existing will, provided that the codicil was specified, i. e. confirmed, in the will.Id. at 15‚Äì16, 17. However, if the will did not confirm the codicil, all provisions in the codicil were considered fideicommissa. Furthermore, a will that did not nominate an heir could be considered a codicil. Thus, when a testator did not nominate an heir, his will would be considered a codicil and his bequests would become fideicommissa. This \\"opened a way to save certain dispositions in a will which was invalid due to some formal or substantive defect\\": if a testator failed or chose not to nominate an heir, an estate would pass to heirs pursuant to rules of intestacy, but those heirs would be bound by the fideicommissa in the codicil. By the time of the Codex Justinianus, the formal requirements for wills had relaxed, while requirements for codicils had become more stringent. \\"There was thus little difference between the formalities for a will and for a codicil\\", and an invalid will, when for example, no heir had been nominated, could often be validated as a codicil.Id. at 24. It is acknowledged that classical Roman inheritance law was \\"highly complicated and to a large extent perplexedly entangled\\".  Modern development  The codicil remained a distinct entity to a will (testament) to varying degrees throughout the Roman-influenced legal world. The concept of heredis institutio (a will requires an heir) was part of the jus commune up until modern times.Klein et al. c. 2 p. 33. In the United States, a codicil is a document that changes an existing will. Amendments made by a codicil may alter, explain, add to, subtract from, or confirm ‚Äì and otherwise amend a will in any other way, minor or major, short of complete revocation. It is subject to the same formal requirements as a will.

Information that solicitors obtain about their clients' affairs may be confidential, and must not be used for the benefit of persons not authorized by the client. Confidentiality is a prerequisite for legal professional privilege to hold. The duty and its source The lawyer-client relationship has historically been characterised as one of confidence. This duty also constitutes part of the broader foundation for lawyer's fiduciary duties to their clients. =Rationales for the duty= The maintenance of full and frank disclosure between lawyers and their clients is the main justification for the duty of confidentiality. The basis for this rationale is utilitarianism, in that it works to promote the work of solicitors, who are officers of the court. It allows clients to freely discuss intimate details without fear that such information could be subsequently disclosed to the general public. In turn, public confidence in lawyers and the legal system is maintained and promoted. Further, the duty of confidentiality is a constant reminder to lawyers of the loyalty they owe to their clients. Another rationale is to protect the human dignity of the client. In criminal cases, confidentiality is also justified to prevent the use of tricked confessions or admissions. =Source of the duty= The duty is sourced from a combination of contract law and equity arising from the distinctive relationship between lawyer and client. The solicitor or attorney is an agent of the client under the law of agency. In contract, the duty arises from terms contained in the retainer agreement. Complementarily, equity prohibits unauthorised use or disclosure of confidential information. In most jurisdictions, the duty is codified in the terms of legal professional rules, such as the Model Code of Professional Responsibility. Although the duty of confidentiality and fiduciary duties have common origins, they cannot be equated as not all fiduciary duties attract duties of confidentiality and vice versa. Scope of the duty=In contract= As the lawyer-client duty of confidentiality is primarily sourced in contract law, the wording of implied terms in the retainer agreement determines its scope of operation. Despite its importance, there have been few judicial attempts to resolve the extent of the implied term. =In equity= In equity, protection is attached to information that is capable of meeting the test of confidentiality - whether the information was already public knowledge and whether its communication was for a limited purpose. While this test may indicate a more limited scope of confidentiality under equity, by requiring information to be deemed confidential before falling under the scope, on another level equity may secure a broader temporal protection for confidential information. The duty under contract expires on termination of the legal retainer, whereas the duty under equity remains intact until the information is no longer confidential, which may occur long after the expiration of the contractual retainer. =In professional rules= Legal professional rules have tended to adopt the broad view of the scope of duty recognised in contract law. The obligation to retain information in confidence, according to the professional rules in Australian jurisdictions is premised on its connection with the legal retainer rather than the source of the information. Hence, the professional rules seem to imply that information gained in connection with the legal retainer is deemed confidential. However, though the rules emphasise the importance of the duty of confidentiality, this is not a hard rule. Not all information connected with the retainer meets the legal test of confidentiality. The duty of confidence applies to \\"any information, which is confidential to a client and acquired by [a] practitioner or [a] practitioner's firm during the client's engagement.\\" For barristers, it is \\"confidential information obtained by [a] barrister concerning any person.\\" =Compared to legal professional privilege= Though the duty of confidentiality shares a common origin, goals, and similarities with legal professional privilege, they are distinct in at least three ways. Firstly, privilege is not dependent on a contractual, equitable or professional duty to clients. Rather, it is based upon arguments of public policy. Secondly, communications protected by confidentiality are more numerous than those protected by privilege. Privileged communications are a subset of confidential communication. Nonetheless, loss of privilege does not necessarily automatically destroy the duty to confidentiality if it has arisen independently of the privilege. Finally, privileged information is protected from compulsory disclosure, unless abrogated by statute or waived. Non- privileged confidential information on the other hand must be disclosed to judicial, statutory, or other legal compulsion. In particular, the public interest in discovering the truth trumps private duties to respect confidence. Limits and exceptions to the duty Though the duty to confidentiality is often expressed in absolute terms in professional rules, there are circumstances where the duty can be breached. The breach of the duty in certain contexts is justified through the balancing of the often competing interests of the client and proper administration of justice =Client authorization= As lawyer-client confidentiality exists for the benefit of the client, the confidence is the client's to waive or modify. Hence, the lawyer can reveal confidential information to third parties where the client allows such an action. However, consent to allow the disclosure of confidential information does not entitle the lawyer to disclose or use the information for other purposes than those specified by the client. The authorization does not necessarily have to be explicit. It can be inferred from the terms or nature of the retainer agreement. The idea that all information imparted within a retainer is confidential is impracticable. Often, much of that information is communicated so that it can be disclosed to dispose of a matter, claim, or legal issue. Hence, where information is incidental to the conduct of a retainer, client authorisation can be generally taken as given. Nonetheless, where there is uncertainty, express authority should be sought from the client. =Disclosure compelled by law= Where expressly provided for in statute, lawyers must comply with any parliamentary requirement necessitating breach of the duty to confidentiality. Lord Denning in Parry-Jones v Law SocietyParry-Jones v Law Society [1969] 1 Ch 1 said at 6-7: :\\"the solicitor must obey the law, and, in particular, he must comply with the rules made under the authority of statute for the conduct of the profession. If the rules require him to disclose his client's affairs, then he must do so.\\" Statutory abrogation of the duty is limited in scope and purpose however. Requirements are never blanket decrees for the revelation of confidential information. Rather they are based on upholding the public interest, where such interests override client interests in maintaining confidentiality. =Disclosure ostensibly to support lawyer's own interests= Lawyers may disclose confidential information relating to the retainer where they are reasonably seeking to collect payment for services rendered. This is justified on policy grounds. If lawyers were unable to disclose such information, many would undertake legal work only where payment is made in advance. This would arguably adversely affect the public's access to justice. Lawyers may also breach the duty where they are defending themselves against disciplinary or legal proceedings. A client who initiates proceedings against a lawyer effectively waives rights to confidentiality. This is justified on grounds of procedural fairness - a lawyer unable to reveal information relating to the retainer would be unable to defend themselves against such actions. =Disclosure of information that is not confidential= Clearly, information that is not confidential does not fall under the duty of confidentiality. Disclosure of information that is already in the public domain does not breach the duty. Further, information that was not in the public knowledge at the time of the retainer agreement, is not subject to the duty if it subsequently enters the public domain. The purpose served by maintaining the confidence - the protection of the client - is arguably extinguished. Nonetheless, the lawyer still owes a duty of loyalty, and clients may feel betrayed if such information is disclosed, even if it becomes public knowledge. Though there are no legal ramifications for disclosure, discretion on part of the lawyer may be in the long term interests of maintaining the propriety of the legal profession. =Disclosure for the purpose of probate= Another case is for the probate of a last will and testament. Previously confidential communications between the lawyer and testator are no longer secret for the purpose of proving the Will is the intent of the now deceased decedent. In many instances, the will, codicil, or other parts of the estate plan require explanation or interpretation through other proof (extrinsic evidence), such as the attorney's file notes or correspondence from the client. In certain cases, the client may desire or consent to revelation of personal or family secrets only after his or her death; for example, the Will may leave a legacy to a paramour or a natural child.

After constructing a new school at East 97th Street in 1905, Hathaway Brown moved to its current location at 19600 North Park Boulevard in Shaker Heights. Mary Elizabeth Raymond (1912‚Äì38) and Miss Ann Cutter Coburn (1938‚Äì68) were notable headmistresses. Hathaway Brown offers a coeducation early childhood program, and an all-girls K-12 program with an enrollment of 842 students (29 percent students of color EC-12). Hathaway Brown currently draws families from 93 communities across Northeast Ohio to its 16-acre Shaker Heights campus which houses an aquatics center, an invention lab, a dance studio, visual arts and performance spaces, and a working television studio.

The institute was created to help foster a stronger connection to a particular subject and a more hands-on aspect of learning. Students have the option of choosing one or more centers to join in addition to their core classes, while completing projects and assessments. Each center focuses on specific issues, but can also be combined with another center for a cross- learning experience. The Centers include: * Osborne Writing Center * Center for Technology & Innovation * Center for Civic Engagement * Center for Leadership & Well-Being * Center for Business & Finance * Center for Sustainability * Aspire Program * Center for Global Citizenship * Center for Multicultural Affairs * Science Research & Engineering Program * Center for the Creative Arts Many of the centers contain stipulations to receiving the graduating designation. The Global Scholar program, for example, requires that each student who graduates taking the Global Scholar classes must have completed Global Scholars Seminars 1 and 2 (a 2-year commitment), a 20-40 page senior thesis (and defense), as well as an 80% passing grade on a map of the entire world. Each center varies, but many require certain aspects to prove the designation. Nearly 90% of the students in every grade are global scholars, so many of the girls end up writing a thesis and defending. Traditions=First Day of School= The first day of school at HB begins with students meeting in the courtyard while a bagpiper begins to play. At some point, the students begin to exit the courtyard, two by two, beginning with the freshman and ending with the seniors. All Upper School students then file into the hallways and are cheered on by all faculty that line the sides of the hallways. The respective class presidents for each grade carry a flag with their class's graduating year as well as the class color. At the end, the Class Presidents place the flags on the auditorium stage, and this begins the school year. =Thanksgiving Assembly= The Thanksgiving Assembly occurs the day before Thanksgiving weekend. To commemorate the break, the whole school dresses up for the occasion and celebrates together. Late afternoon, students file two by two into the auditorium, starting with the preschoolers and ending with the seniors. During this time, the Middle School Orchestra plays music. After everyone is seated, there are multiple performances from the HB Singers, Bravuras, and Upper School Orchestra. Afterwards, girls from many grades give speeches for their thankfulness, as well as the headmaster delivering the final speech until dismissal. =Winterfest= Known as \\"Ideo Day\\" to the girls, this day is the celebration right before the girls are dismissed for winter festivities. The tradition arises from a previous headmaster that loved the religious carol \\"Ideo\\". She loved the song so much that she asked the girls if they would sing it. As a gift to her, the day before winter break, the girls would walk down the halls, two by two, and sing the song throughout the school. Her gift to the girls was winter break, and so the tradition continued. Ideo remains fairly the same today. As one of the HB's largest traditions, it is the most popular for alumni to return and remember their own Ideo day memories. Faculty, friends, and family line the hallways starting from the auditorium and ending in the gym. Fifth graders begin the procession, and twelfth graders end it. Students walk two by two and listen to an instrumental version of Ideo. When the seniors reach the gym, they sing a song to the school called, \\"Bless This House\\". After the song has been sung, the headmaster will say a speech to the grade, as well as the school, and then dismisses the girls for Winter Break. =Ohio High School Athletic Association team state championships= * Girls Basketball - 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 * Girls Field Hockey - 2008, 2002 * Girls Soccer - 2007, 2004 * Girls Golf - 2010 * Girls Tennis -2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 Other non- sanctioned state championships: *Girls Tennis -2003, 2004 *Girls Lacrosse-2010, 2012 Science Research and Engineering Program Hathaway Brown's Science Research and Engineering Program is an elective that was initiated in early 1998 by HB Director of Research Patricia K. Hunt. It now enrolls approximately one third of the grade 9-12 student population. Students in the Program are linked with supervising professionals from institutions such as Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals of Cleveland, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, NASA Glenn Research Center, and the Cleveland Museums of Art and Natural History for the purpose of conducting a research project. Once a placement is made, the SREP Director assists as necessary, also helping students prepare for optional competitions. While most projects are scientific in nature, a number of students prefer to develop internship or shadowing experiences in non-scientific areas such as sports and entertainment management, architecture, radio broadcast, and fashion retail and marketing. Current research projects in the Science Research & Engineering Program represent a cross section of the cutting edge research that is occurring in the Cleveland area, such as work on gene therapy, MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) nanotechnology, BioMEMS, and microelectrochemical sensor development, as well as research into cures for many life-threatening diseases. One project, called PEACE, addresses a real erosion problem in low earth orbit, and will fly in space twice, once as a short term exposure experiment aboard the space shuttle, and another time as a long term exposure experiment aboard the International Space Station. That version is in space now. The work of HB's Science Research & Engineering Program students has garnered hundreds of awards at the regional, state, national, and international levels since 1999, including hundreds of thousands of dollars in college scholarships, cash, and other prizes such as computers and all-expense-paid trips to places including London, Germany, and Israel. Four SREP students have US Patents pending for their original inventions, and there are over 70 student authorships or co- authorships on technical publications or presentations. Robotics program In the 2007‚Äì08 school year, Hathaway Brown debuted a FIRST Robotics team. FIRST team 2399 began as a collaborative project between Hathaway Brown and Case Western Reserve University, which provided facilities and mentors. In 2009, the team took home awards in robot design, the Delphi Driving Tomorrow's Technology Award and the General Motors Industrial Design Award, from the Buckeye and Pittsburgh regional competitions respectively and progressed to the semifinals at the 2009 Pittsburgh Regional. The team moved all operations from Case to Hathaway Brown in the 2011 season and continues to compete annually in the FIRST Robotics Competition.

The birch bolete is widespread in Europe, in the Himalayas in Asia, and elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, occurring only in mycorrhizal association with birch trees. It fruits from June to October. This mushroom is also becoming increasingly common in Australia and New Zealand where it is likely introduced. Description The cap is wide. At first, it is hemispherical, and later becomes flatter. The skin of the cap is light gray-brown to reddish gray-brown, later often more or less brown, smooth, bald, dry, and rather slimy when damp. The pores are white at a young age, later gray. In older specimens, the pores on the pileus can bulge out, while around the stipe they dent in strongly. The pore covering is easy to remove from the skin of the pileus. The stipe is long and wide, slim, with white and dark to black flakes, and tapers upward. The basic mycelium is white. The flesh is whitish, later more gray-white and does not change color when broken. In young specimens, the meat is relatively firm, but it very soon becomes spongy and holds water, especially in rainy weather. When cooked, the meat of the birch bolete turns black. Leccinum scabrum has been found in association with ornamental birch trees planted outside of its native range, such as in California. Similar species L. scabrum of different ages Leccinum scabrum (Belarus). Several different species of Leccinum mushrooms are found in mycorrhiza with birches, and can be confused by amateurs and mycologists alike. L. variicolor has a bluish stipe. L. oxydabile has firmer, pinkish flesh and a different pileus skin structure. L. melaneum is darker in color and has yellowish hues under the skin of the pileus and stipe. L. holopus is paler and whitish in all parts. Habitat and distribution Leccinum scabrum is a European species that has been introduced to various areas of the world. In New Zealand, it associates solely with Betula pendula. Uses The birch bolete is edible but considered not to be worthwhile by some guides. It can be pickled in brine or vinegar. It is used also in mixed mushroom dishes, fried or steamed. It is commonly harvested for food in Finland and Russia. A few reports in North America (New England and the Rocky Mountains) after 2009 suggest that leccinums (birch boletes) should only be consumed with much caution.

Meteorological history  Tropical Depression 04W formed on June 19 near Palau where it moved westward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Chebi six hours later. Chebi then moved generally west- northwest and then to the northwest as the tropical storm passed north of the Philippines on June 21 and entered the Luzon Strait on June 23 as a Category 1 typhoon. Later on the 23rd Chebi reached a peak intensity of 85 knots (160 km/h, 100 mph) as the center of the storm was south of Taiwan. A trough forced Chebi west and northwest where it made landfall near Fuzhou City, China. Chebi then weakened and accelerated to the north then northeast, passing southeast of Shanghai before exiting back out to sea. The JMA and other weather centers stopped issuing advisories when the remnants of Chebi dissipated in the eastern Pacific on June 30.  Impact  Chebi killed 82 people, mostly in China, and left $422 million (2001 USD), $457 million (2005 USD). Chebi's heavy rains and strong winds left nine people dead, 28 missing and $13 million (2001 USD) in damage in the Philippines. Four of the nine were from a Belizean freighter that sank during the storm. The Penghu Islands, which took the brunt of the typhoon, suffered considerable damage as 102 fishing boats sank and ten thousand people were left without power. The storm also crippled ground and air traffic. A rain laden typhoon, Chebi produced 100 millimeters of rain across Guangdong. About 73 people were killed in China, most of them in the southeastern province of Fujian. The storm also destroyed several thousand acres of crops, resulting in economic losses. In Ningde, about 321,400 houses were destroyed by the typhoon. About 22 people were killed in Hangzhou when a landslide burst through a construction wall.

A dipmeter and several accessory probe coils. (Mitamusenkenky≈´sho ‰∏âÁî∞ÁÑ°Á∑öÁ†îÁ©∂ÊâÄÊ†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ DELICA DMC-230S2) Grid dip oscillator (GDO), also called grid dip meter, gate dip meter, dip meter, or just dipper, is a type of electronic instrument that measures the resonant frequency of unconnected, nearby radio frequency circuits. It is a variable frequency oscillator that circulates a small-amplitude signal through an exposed coil, whose electromagnetic field can interact with adjacent circuitry. The oscillator loses power when its coil is near a circuit that resonates at the same frequency. A meter on the GDO registers the amplitude drop, or \\"dip\\", hence the name. Dip oscillators have been widely used by amateur radio operators for measuring the properties of resonant circuits, filters, and antennas. They can also be used for transmission line testing, as signal generators, and for measuring inductance and capacitance of components. Measurement with a GDO is called \\"dipping\\" a circuit.  Principle of operation  Central to the dip meter is an HF variable frequency oscillator with a calibrated tuning capacitor and matching interchangeable coils, as shown in the circuit diagram to the right. Resonance is indicated by a dip in amplitude of the signal within the GDO, by a meter on the device. When the oscillator's exposed coil is in the vicinity of another resonant circuit, the coupled pair behaves as a low Q transformer whose coupling is most effective when their respective resonant frequencies match. The degree of coupling affects the frequency and amplitude of oscillation in the dip meter, which is sensed in any of several ways, the simplest and most usual of which is a built-in microammeter. The distance between the coil and the tested circuit needs to be adjusted carefully so that the GDO amplitude is significantly affected by the coupled circuit, but its frequency is not. Oscillator portion of a transistor-based gate-dip meter.  History  Grid dip oscillators were first developed in the 1920s and were then built with vacuum tubes. The devices displayed the amplitude of the tube's grid current, hence the \\"G\\" in GDO. Modern dip meters are solid-state devices, and are sometimes called gate dip oscillators or emitter dip oscillators in reference to the analogous part of the transistor whose current is measured instead of a vacuum tube grid. Solid-state versions of the grid dip oscillator are more versatile, since they can operate at higher Q and lower amplitude, and are not tethered by a power cord. Dip meters of all types are being supplanted by Antenna analyzers, which are more complicated, but perform many of the same functions more conveniently, and require less dexterity.  Operation  Two Heathkit Grid Dip Meters with a set of tuning coils. The dip meter can be used either to measure the relative power lost to a nearby circuit (in which case the amplitude shown on the meter \\"dips\\") or to measure the relative power absorbed from a nearby powered circuit (in which case, the meter amplitude peaks). In either mode of operation, some experimentation is needed to find a distance between the pickup coil and the circuit under test, to ensure that the two circuits are close enough to transfer power, but not coupled so closely that the circuit supplied with power overwhelms the responding circuit, and forces it to oscillate regardless of the frequency. =The art of coupling distance= The heart of the instrument is a tunable LC circuit whose exposed external coil will loosely couple to the measured resonant circuit when held moderately close by. The measuring distance must be skillfully adjusted to be close enough to provide sufficient coupling for the dip to show clearly, but far enough that the meter and the tested circuit oscillate independently, so neither device's frequency is significantly distorted by the other, and so that power lost to the external circuit does not swamp the dip meter's oscillator. The coil and the test circuit can either be inductively or capacitively coupled: Coupling is inductive if the coil wires are held parallel to the nearest wires of the circuit being tested, capacitive if the coil wires and the circuit wires are held perpendicular. Depending on the context desired for the measurement, the circuit under test can be temporarily disconnected from its surroundings to avoid distortion by the parts it is normally attached to, or left wired in place to measure the response of the combined system. =Emission frequency meter= In ordinary use, only the oscillator in the dip meter is powered, and the circuit under test's only power is what it drains from the signal in the GDO coil. When both circuits are resonant at the same frequency, power transfer from the coil to the adjacent tested circuit reaches a maximum, consequently the dip meter's oscillator amplitude reaches a minimum due to the power lost to the circuit under test. The operator adjusts the frequency of the GDO until its meter shows its lowest reading (the \\"dip\\"). The frequency is read off of the dial on the GDO, or the frequency can be measured by finding the dip meter's signal on a well-calibrated radio receiver. Some modern GDOs have a built-in frequency meter, which makes over-coupling somewhat less troublesome. =Absorption frequency meter= Some dip meters can be used in reverse, as ultra-short- range, tuned field strength meters. The operator finds the frequency at which the highest rise in meter power occurs in the unpowered GDO, when its coil is held near the wires of an active resonant circuit. Since the power in the circuit under test must be high enough to register on the meter, this uncommon method is risky both for the operator and the equipment.

It is a Hollandic Dutch dialect but is influenced by West Frisian (Dutch: Westerlauwers Fries, a language of Friesland Province distinct from Dutch), which is related. The dialect in itself is not a fixed one, as there is a diverse number of subdialects (sometimes referred to as the West Frisian dialect group) that consists of some widely spoken regional dialects, namely Wierings in Wieringen, Tessels or Texels in Texel and the dialect of Vlieland known as Vlielands, which has fallen into disuse. The smaller regions and villages, such as Zijpe, Andijk, Enkhuizen and Schagen, have some distinct differences between them. Slightly more different from the rest of the group is Derpers, the dialect of the village Egmond aan Zee. The dialect descends from an older form of the Hollandic dialect. Only about 7-9% of the people speak the strong dialect or a mixture of strong and light. The light dialect is much more widely spoken but is also slowly beginning to become lighter and sound more like Dutch. Since the 1970s, there has been more interest in reading and writing the dialect. Little had been written before then, as it was mostly a spoken language by common people.

Background Over the years, the media has changed dramatically from its early 20th century beginnings as a battlefield for influential lobbies within the local Catholic society (including caste-based elites, or politically divided groups) which were largely controlled by influential and educated local elites. After the end of Portuguese rule in 1961, new newspapers were set up, which were aligned to the influential local mining lobby. This too has changed in recent years, with some sections of the media becoming more politically aligned, or linked to major business houses both within Goa and its neighbourhood (particularly Maharastra).Noronha, Frederick. THE POST-1961 PRESS IN GOA, ITS POLITICS AND PROCESSES (Retrieved 23 Feb 2013) Languages The most widely read newspapers in Goa tend to be published in the English and Marathi languages, with the widely spoken local language of Konkani not receiving much coverage. Konkani-versus-Marathi linguistic battles have led to rivalry between these two language camps around the 1980s. There is friction between the users of the official Devanagari script and the Roman, or Romi script users of Konkani. Newspapers and magazines English-language newspapers in Goa comprise: O Heraldo (The Herald), Goa's oldest newspaper, formerly a Portuguese language daily owned by Raoul Fernandes (Herald Publications Pvt Ltd), a local printing enterprise that grew out of a stationery shop; The Navhind Times, published by the mining house of the Dempos since 1963; and the Gomantak Times, which changed hands from its earlier owners from the mining house of the Chowgules to the politically-linked Pawar family, based in the neighboring state of Maharashtra. In addition to these, The Times of India and The Indian Express are also distributed to urban areas from nearby Bombay and Bangalore. A Goan edition of The Times of India started publication in June 2008. The lone English monthly is Goa Today, edited by Vinayak Naik and owned by Goa Publications, a firm controlled by the Salgaocars mining house. Other English- language publications include The Goan, Goa Messenger and the Goan Observer. The First travel magazine of Goa started in Goa in year 2007Goa Prism. Publications in Konkani include Vauraddeancho Ixtt (Workers' Friend), a weekly magazine in Roman script. In the 1980s, a Roman script Konkani paper called Novem Goem folded in large part due to financial difficulties and alleged mismanagement in spite of being set up with enthusiasm and even a drive to collect funds for it through a 'padyatra' (foot-march) across Goa. Sunaparant was a Devanagari Konkani daily published which functioned from 1987 to 2015.Black and White of Goan Newspapers Retrieved 18 Feb 2013 from Shvoong.com/ The Goan, which is linked to the industrial house of the Timblos, which has interests in mining and the luxury tourism sector, was started in 2013, edited by Sujay Gupta. On 15 July 2016, a new Devanagari Konkani daily called \\"Bhaangar Bhuin\\" (‡§≠‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡§∞‡§≠‡•Ç‡§Ç‡§Ø) was established, under the editorship of Pundalik Naik. The daily is published by Fomento Publications. In the Marathi language, some of the popular newspapers are: the Tarun Bharat, which was earlier published from the neighbouring city of Belgaum but now has its presses in Porvorim; the Daily Pudhari, which was earlier published from Karaswada, Mapusa; the Gomantak, a sister publication of the Gomantak Times and much more influential in the past; and Navprabha of The Navhind Times/Dempo group. Other publications primarily publish \\"Goa editions\\" through presses and offices run from outside Goa. Recent years saw the launch of the Gova Doot. A nearly three-decade old newspaper, the Marathi daily Rashtramath from the South Goa city of Margao suspended publications at the early part of this decade. A new Hindi daily paper Nitya Samay also started from Margao. As of 2013, the Lokmat, which is a newspaper based in Maharashtra, was also a growing and influential paper in the Marathi segment of the Goa newspaper market; it comes out with a local edition, edited by Raju Nayak. Out-station dailies reaching Goa from other centres of publication include, Kesari, Maharashtra Times, Loksatta, The Asian Age, Deccan Herald, The Hindu, Hindustan Times, Navshakti and more. The two mainstream news agencies operating in the state are the Press Trust of India and the United News of India. Other publications in the state include Vasco Watch (English-language, fortnightly‚ÄîFree to reader neighbourhood newspaper), Hello Publications, Hello Travel Talk (English-language, a tourism magazine), Whats On Goa (English- language, fortnightly‚Äîan event lister Of Goa), Hello City - Hello Panjim, Hello Margao (English-language), Hello Goa Yellowpages (English-language, Yearly), Gulab (Konkani, monthly), Bimb (Devanagiri-script Konkani), Poddbimb (Konkani Roman-script monthly), Harbour Times, [Digital Goa], and J's House among others. Some of the smaller publications are known to change their name, form or even go out of publication temporarily or permanently. Radio Goa was once home to the Emisora Goa, a radio station that was popular when the region was a Portuguese colony. After the end of Portuguese rule, this station was replaced by a station from the All India Radio network. Its studios are at Altinho, the hill-top state-capital Panjim - also known as Panaji, Pangim or Ponnje - and its transmitters are located at Bambolim, some 5 km away. Bambolim also houses transmitters that broadcast foreign-language programmes as part of India's international programme. Two AM channels are broadcast, the primary channel at 1287 kHz and the Vividh Bharati channel at 1539 kHz. Besides the AM broadcasts, All India Radio has an FM, or frequency modulated, channel called Rainbow FM, broadcasting at 105.4 MHz. Since 2006, the FM channel broadcasts locally produced programs between 4:30am and 12 midnight. These locally produced programs include mainly English, Konkani and Hindi music. At other times, the channel relays programs from AIR FM Rainbow India channel, providing variety for listeners. It also covers important speeches and events live. Broadcast starts at 6am and ends at 12:30am. Goa has two private FM channels: Big FM and Radio Indigo. Big FM plays only Hindi musics. The channels' programs are hosted in both English and Konkani. The channels have featured Goan artists, like tiatrist Prince Jacob and musician-singer Remo Fernandes. Radio Indigo programming is contemporary international music and international hit music. The music and hosting is in English. Both radio stations broadcast 24 hours a day. Though the private FM stations have bought life to the radio industry in Goa, signal strength and coverage remain weak in the southern part of Goa, beyond the Verna plateau. Thus, most of the people in south Goa are unable to get reception in their home. There is also an educational channel, Gyan Vani, run by IGNOU broadcast from Panaji at 105.6 MHz. =Broadcasting background= In the mid-1990s, when India first experimented with private FM broadcasts, the small tourist destination of Goa was the fifth place in the country where private broadcasters could secure FM slots. The first four centres were the major metro cities: Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. In Phase-II of FM licensing, Goa's capital, Panjim was categorised as a 'D'-class city, i.e. having a population between 100,000 and 300,000. In the end of January 2006, three private FM radio players won bids to set up private FM radio stations in Goa.: * Radio Mirchi (ENIL - Times group, linked to the Indian media giant Times of India, Rs 17.1 million; * Indigo (Jupiter Capital ‚Äì Rajiv Chandrasekhar, linked to the BPL electronics hardware firm), Rs 12.9 million; and * Big FM (Adlabs - Reliance ‚Äì Anil Ambani group) Rs 12.1 million. Big FM at 92.7 MHz and Radio Mirchi at 98.3 MHz both launched in Goa in May 2007. Radio Indigo at 91.9 MHz, the country's first and only 24hr international hit music station launched in June 2007. Indian policy stipulates that these bids are a One-Time Entry Fee (OTEF), for the license period of 10 years. India's earlier attempts to privatise its FM channels ran into difficulty, when most private players bid heavily then could not meet their commitments to pay the governments the expected amounts. In FM Phase-1 (year 2000), the highest bid in Goa was Rs 41.5 million. Under the policy then, this would have escalated - at 15% each year - to Rs. 146 million by the tenth year of operation. The bidder would have ended up paying Rs. 42.6 crores over 10 years, causing the major players to back off. This time, the only local company from Goa to bid for a license was Tarun Bharat Multigraphics, resulting in all of the winning players being based outside of Goa. All the three winning bidders were to co-site their transmitting infrastructure with All India Radio's tower on the outskirts of Panaji. AIR's FM Rainbow has a six kW transmitter, and even this is not heard properly in some distant areas of Goa. The private FM operators are allowed only 3 kW transmitters. Radio Mirchi (of what was the Times FM group, run by one of the biggest newspaper chains in the country) returned to Goa after many years. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Times FM used to buy air-time on AIR's Panaji FM channel. Radio Mirchi Goa 98.3 was discontinued on 22 May 2017 after its license expired and the company decided not to renew the license due to lack of revenue. C and D category cities are allowed to network and share programming, but generally, channels prefer to do in-house programming. News is not permitted on private FM. Nationally, many of the current FM players - like the Times of India, Hindustan Times, Mid-Day, BBC etc. - are essentially newspaper chains or media, and they are making a strong pitch for News on FM. St Xavier's College in Mapusa announced the starting of its campus community radio, named Voice of Xavier's (VOX) on 17 December 2006 at 90.4 MHz. The station had a power output of 20 watts. This was Goa's second FM station. It did not however stay in operation apart from test broadcasts. This does not currently operate (as of July 2013). Television Goa is served by almost all the television channels available in India. Channels are received through cable in most parts of Goa. In the interior regions, channels are received via satellite dishes. Doordarshan (DD), the national television broadcaster, has two free terrestrial channels on air: DD National and DD News. DD National broadcasts programmes of short duration in local languages (Konkani, Marathi). Goa has all the cable TV channels generally found in India, namely: MTV, ESPN, Fox, Zee TV, ZEE Marathi, HBO, Star Plus, Star Movies, BBC, CNN, Tensports, AXN, Star World, Star News, Fashion TV, Sony, Set Max, SAB, Sahara One, Sahara News, Discovery Channel, National Geographic Channel, Animal Planet, Channel X5 etc. Electronic media with DTH (Direct To Home) TV services are available from Dish TV, Tata Sky & DD Direct Plus. Beside these Goa has many major local channels, which cover local events, including political developments, and which reach viewers through the local cable network. These include Goa News Network (GNN) (Konkani), GOA365 (English /Konkani), Prudent (Konkani), CCR TV (A catholic Religious Channel in English/Konkani) RDXGOA TV(Konkani\\\\English), In Goa News (Marathi\\\\English), Goa Newsline (Konkani), Goa Plus and HCN (English), DBTV a children's educational channel among others. In Goa 24x7 is the only 24-hour live Marathi channel. In April 2015 - Prime Media Goa, a Cable Television Channel has caught the imagination of a large section of the population, not just in Goa but across the globe. The earlier BJP government, at the start of the first decade of this century, officially acknowledged that it was subsidising the operations of some networks, arguing that this was needed to promote programming in the local language Internet television In August 2011, a live internet news webcast was commenced by In Goa News.

The Chowgules, for example, launched the newspapers Gomantak and Uzvadd, and were founders of an arts and science college at Margao; the Salgaocars founded a law college; and the Dempos own The Navhind Times and Navprabha, and are involved in Dhempe College at Miramar.\\" Another essay titled Popular Protest and the Free Goa Press (pp 91‚Äì113) in Norman Dantas' The Transformation of Goa (The Other India Press, Mapusa, 1999) argues: \\"In Goa, the daily newspapers' editorial stances on various protest movements would tend to reveal a largely unfriendly attitude towards such actions. It is not perhaps coincidental that individuals and groups involved in protest issues in Goa have often felt that they have received an unfair deal from the media.\\" It looks at protest and the media response to it in Goa over a three decade period, from the early 1960s to the 1990s.

He was an esteemed student of Nishida Kitar≈ç and a prominent member of the Kyoto School. Miki was a prolific academic and social critic of his time. He also had tense relations with both and the Imperial government at various stages of his career.  Biography  Miki was born on January 5, 1897 in Isseimura, Hy≈çgo (now part of Tatsuno, Hy≈çgo). He was the eldest son of Miki Eikichi, a farmer, and his wife Shin, and was raised a devout Pure Land Buddhist. In 1910, Miki entered secondary school and went on to excell in various oratory competitions. He was admitted into the First Higher School in September 1914, where in his third year he formed a society for reading philosophical texts in Japanese. The works of Nishida Kitar≈ç and Abe Jir≈ç had strong influence on his choice to pursue studies in philosophy. In 1917 he met with Nishida and the following September registed in the Philosophy Department of the Faculty of Literature of Kyoto Imperial University. He began studying under Nishida and Hatano Seiichi, then in 1918 also under Tanabe Hajime. Miki wrote a wealth of poetry during this time. After graduating in 1920, Miki spent three months training in the Japanese Imperial Army, 10th Infantry Division, before returning to Kyoto Imperial University as a graduate student. While studying philosophy of history he began working as a lecturer at Ry≈´koku University and ≈åtani University. In 1922 he travelled to Germany on scholarship where he studied under Heinrich Rickert in Heidelberg. Miki was in contact with over fifteen other Japanese students during his stay, including Hani Gor≈ç, Abe Jir≈ç, Amano Teiy≈´ and Kuki Sh≈´z≈ç. In 1923 he moved to Marburg to study under Martin Heidegger, where he studied the works of Aristotle, Friedrich Schlegel, Alexander von Humboldt, Wilhelm Dilthey, Friedrich Nietzsche and S√∏ren Kierkegaard, among others. In 1924, Miki moved again to Paris, France where he studied the works of Henri Poincar√©, Hippolyte Taine, Ernest Renan and Blaise Pascal. Miki became a contentious figure upon his return to Japan for his outspokenness and outgoing lifestyle, as well as for a controversial involvement with a widowed older woman. In 1927 he was denied a senior position at Kyoto University and was instead granted professorship at H≈çsei University in Tokyo. During this time, Miki promptly engaged with Marxist theory and developed a substantial influence over Japanese workers' movements, though did not have communist leanings. He was critical of Marxist views on religion and its limited scope of natural philosophy in modern natural science. In 1928, he was engaged to Tobata Kimiko and the following year they married. Trouble befell him when money he lent to a friend was used, unbeknown to Miki, to make illegal donations to the Japanese Communist Party. Being implicated in the development, Miki was arrested in January 1930 and held for six months, leading him to resign his post as professor. The following November, three months after the birth of his eldest daughter, he was sentenced to one year imprisonment but had the sentence deferred. The same year, members of the Puroretaria Kagaku Kenky≈´jo (Proletariat Science Research Institute), including Hattori Shis≈ç, decried Miki's academic works after which he sought to further distance himself from Marxism. While he remained in touch with his mentor, Nishida, and other members of the Kyoto School, he worked outside mainstream academia, producing popular writings aimed at a wide audience. In 1931, Miki was appointed as a Japanese representative of the International Hegel League. He became a staunch proponent of academic freedom after raising earnest criticisms of Nazi Germany and Japanese militarism. One or more of his works were banned by the government during this time. Throughout the mid-1930s Miki regained his academic standing, forming strong collaborations with his contemporaries. Most notably he became closely associated with Jun Tosaka, a fellow student of Nishida, and remained in close contact with their mutual teacher. He wrote articles for a conservative newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, providing commentary on issues of the day. In 1936 his first wife died, after which he would remain unmarried for three years. In the late 1930s he was employed by the Japanese government to give a series of lectures in China and Manchuria. His firm belief that philosophy should lead politics encouraged the political activism of fellow intellectuals, and when offered in 1937, he eagerly accepted the opportunity to head the cultural division of the Sh≈çwa Kenky≈´kai (Sh≈çwa Research Association), the brain trust of Prince Konoe Fumimaro's Shintaisei (New Order Movement). During this time Miki conceptualized the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere though felt deeply betrayed by the Imperial Japanese Army's misuse of the doctrine, employing it in justifying aggressive expansion in China and Southeast Asia. Following the collapse of the Sh≈çwa Kenky≈´kai in 1940, Miki became isolated and depressed. During this time he continued to collaborate with fellow academics and members of the newly formed Kokumin Gakujutsu Ky≈çkai (Civilian Academic Society). In 1942 he served one year in the Imperial Army as a military journalist deployed in the Philippines. His second wife Kobayashi Itoko died in 1944, after which he moved to Saitama Prefecture with his eldest son. In 1945 he was arrested again and charged with sheltering political fugitive and fellow Kyoto School thinker Takakura Teru. He was imprisoned in Sugamo Prison before being transferred to Toyotama Prison where on September 26, 1945 he died of nephritis‚Äî40 days after the end of World War II. His death, suggested to be the result of prisoner mistreatment, caused anguish among Japanese intellectuals. Following this, the Allied Occupation pressed to have political prisoners released.  Thought  Sat≈ç Nobue, a leading scholar on Miki's body of work, rejects the notion that Miki was a mere follower of Nishida, Hegel or Blaise Pascal. Instead, Miki can be seen to have an independent and syncretic approach to his work. Shoji Muramoto credits Miki as \\"the central figure in the Japanese humanistic movement\\" and the first to author a book \\"explicitly related to the existentialist tradition written by a Japanese thinker\\", his 1926 Studies of Human Being in Pascal. Miki himself writes, \\"one who strives for a good life is either an idealist or a humanist.\\" His adherence to humanism throughout his works however is disputed. Tradition was a particular preoccupation of Miki's philosophy. In maturing his thought, he came to emphasize that \\"the philosophy of history is the logic of historical consciousness\\". His conception of tradition as active, ongoing transmission by human action he contrasts with the immanent evolutionism of Hegelians and conservative traditionalists. In his 1940 essay \\"On Tradition\\", he states \\"a proper understanding of tradition must consist of an emphasis on both the transcendence of tradition and our active attitude toward it.\\" Through this he stresses a unification of praxis and tradition. Miki's thought also emphasized the nature of certain concepts in opposition, such as spoken and unspoken philosophy, nature and history, subject and object, logos and pathos, process and moment, organicism and dialectic, immanence and transcendence, and so on. His philosophy saw dialectic or the logic of imagination as the process of reconciliation between opposites, with the principal organ of this process being imagination that creates types or forms. In response to the growing labour movements in Japan during the late 1920s, Miki published three successive books on the subject of Marxism: The Material Concept of History (1928), Preliminary Concepts of Social Sciences (1929), and The Morphology of Ideas (1931). During this time Miki made efforts to distinguish his own philosophy from Marxism, especially following his arrest in 1930, and remained critical of Marxism as a political ideology. He had been, for a time, a member of the Puroretaria Kagaku Kenky≈´jo (Proletariat Science Research Institute) prior to his expulsion. Miki would however not broach Marxism again in his later works. Kenn Nakata Steffensen suggests that to consider Miki's work as either fascist or Marxist is incorrect, stating that it stands in critique of liberalism, Marxism, nationalism and idealism. Miki developed a reading of Heidegger's early philosophy as essentially being in the tradition of Christian individualism, reaching back to Saint Augustine and being fundamentally anti-Greek in character. As such, his reading of Heidegger falls with the broad class as Jean-Paul Sartre, in that it ignores the priority Heidegger gives to the ontological question of Being, in favor of seeing Heidegger's philosophy as an analysis of human existence. The German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was influential in his intellectual development.

He became the majority owner of the American football team, the Cleveland Browns, of the National Football League, upon the death of his father Alfred \\"Al\\" Lerner in October 2002. In August 2012, he sold the team. Lerner became the owner and chairman of English club Aston Villa F.C. of the Premier League in 2006, subsequently Lerner sold the club at a loss in 2016 following their relegation. His personal fortune has been estimated at over 1.1 billion. Early life and education Lerner was born to a Jewish family and graduated from Columbia University in 1984, spending 1983 at Clare College in Cambridge, England. He graduated from Columbia Law School and is a member of the New York and District of Columbia bar associations. He has worked as a lawyer in New York City. Business career Lerner began working as an investment analyst at automobile insurers Progressive Corporation. In 1991, he started an independent investment firm with Progressive capital called Securities Advisors, Inc. (SAI), which he owned and managed until 2001. SAI initially specialized in arbitrage before shifting its focus to equity investing. His father, Alfred \\"Al\\" Lerner, had been appointed chairman of MBNA Corporation after investing 800 million in the initial public offering (IPO) of the company. In 1993, Randy Lerner became a director at MBNA. Upon the death of his father on October 23, 2002, he became MBNA's chairman. On January 1, 2006, Bank of America acquired MBNA Corporation for 35 billion. Sports team ownership Lerner (right), along with general manager Mike Holmgren, observing a Cleveland Browns practice session (2012) =Cleveland Browns= When his father, Al Lerner, died in October 2002 ‚Äì four years to the day after he was awarded the new Browns franchise - the ownership of the team passed on to Lerner. Lerner served as a member of the National Football League's Business Ventures Committee. In 2012, Lerner sold the team to businessman Jimmy Haslam.\\"Cleveland Browns' sale to Jimmy Haslam complete\\" by Gregg Rosenthal, NFL website, 2 August 2012\\"Browns‚Äô Jewish ownership going, going, gone\\" by Matt DeFaveri, Cleveland Jewish News, 2 August 2012 =Aston Villa F.C.= During his time at Cambridge, Lerner followed English football, taking an interest in three teams: Arsenal, Fulham and Aston Villa. Although he had grown up in the United States, with a father who had been involved with the Cleveland Browns franchise under Art Modell, Lerner's interest in England's top flight endured long after he had returned to the States. In July 2006, it was reported that Lerner intended to purchase Premier League club Aston Villa, following a statement from Cleveland Browns management indicating that Lerner was pursuing \\"business interests\\" in the United Kingdom. Lerner pulled out of the bid to buy Aston Villa two days later after talks with club chairman Doug Ellis broke down, but the following day, reports emerged that Lerner was still considering a formal ¬£64m bid for the club. In August 2006, it was confirmed Lerner had reached a ¬£62.6m agreement with Aston Villa to take over the club. The statement to the London Stock Exchange confirmed that 60% of the club's shares, including the 39% stake of Doug Ellis had been sold to Lerner, beating competition from consortia led by Michael Neville, Nicholas Padfield QC, and Athole Still. Eleven days after the announcement, the LSE confirmed that Lerner had secured 59.69% of Villa shares, making him the majority shareholder. Lerner appointed himself Chairman of the Board of the club. The BBC reported in September 2006 that Lerner had moved closer to taking full control of the club, after increasing his share to 85.5%. By the time that the deadline passed in September 2006, Lerner had secured the acceptance of 89.69% of the shareholders. Due to the acceptance only being 0.31% below the conditional limit, Lerner accepted it and made the bid unconditional. On September 19, 2006 Aston Villa PLC executive chairman Doug Ellis and his board resigned, and were replaced by Randy Lerner as chairman with General Charles C. Krulak, Bob Kain and Michael Martin serving as non-executive directors. At the close of the deal in 2006, Lerner became only the second American owner of a Premiership club. In June 2011, Lerner appointed manager Alex McLeish, who was previously working from local rivals Birmingham City. McLeish's contract was terminated at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season after Villa finished in 16th place, just above the relegation zone. On 2 July 2012, Aston Villa confirmed the appointment of former Norwich City manager Paul Lambert. In February 2012, the club announced a financial loss of ¬£53.9 million. Lerner put the club up for sale on 12 May 2014, with an estimated value of ¬£200 million. Lambert was sacked on 11 February 2015 and replaced by Tim Sherwood, who saved Villa from relegation in the 2014/15 season and took them to the 2015 FA Cup Final. Sherwood was sacked on 15 October 2015, after six consecutive league losses, with Kevin MacDonald taking over as interim manager. On 2 November 2015, Frenchman R√©mi Garde agreed a three-and-a-half year deal to become the manager and was sacked after 147 days.\\"Remi Garde: Aston Villa manager leaves after 147 days in charge\\", BBC NEWS, 29 March 2016 In April 2016, two members of Villa's board of directors, former Football Association chairman David Bernstein and Lord King submitted their resignations to Villa Chairman Steve Hollis.\\"David Bernstein and Lord King resign from Aston Villa board\\", BBC Sport, 18 April 2016 Their resignation was due to them being \\"increasingly frustrated at the lack of progress they were able to make\\" at the club.\\"Aston Villa: David Bernstein and Lord King left after Randy Lerner row\\", BBC Sport, 20 April 2016 There had also occurred, reportedly, a \\"hostile interaction\\" between them and owner Randy Lerner. In May 2016, Lerner sold Aston Villa to Chinese businessman Tony Xia and his Recon Group following Villa's relegation to the Football League Championship. Many Aston Villa supporters, legends and former players put the blame solely on Lerner for being inactive and failing to invest significantly since the departure of manager Martin O'Neill in 2010 and also selling their best players.http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~5580392,00.html Philanthropy Lerner has supported the UK's National Portrait Gallery since 2002. In January 2008, it was announced that Lerner had donated ¬£5m to the gallery, the largest single donation it has ever received. In recognition, the ground floor galleries were named \\"The Lerner Galleries\\". For the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 seasons, Aston Villa forwent traditional shirt sponsorship by instead wearing on their shirts the name of a local children's hospice, Acorns. For the 2010/2011 season, this sponsor was replaced by corporate sponsor FxPro, but the club continued to promote Acorns on all children's kits as the club's official charity partner. Lerner is an alumnus and major benefactor to Clare College, Cambridge and was honored in 2008 with a namesake space called \\"Lerner Court.\\" Personal life Lerner has a house in Amagansett, New York where he owns the Community Square shopping complex. The Wall Street Journal reported that, between 2007 and 2011, Cleveland Browns Transportation was the most frequent flyer in and out of East Hampton Airport.

Ludwig Wilhelm Andreas Maria Thuille (Bozen, 30 November 1861 ‚Äì 5 February 1907) was an Austrian composer and teacher, numbered for a while among the leading operatic composers of the so-called Munich School of composers, whose most famous representative was Richard Strauss.The Munich School of composers, active from the last decades of the XIX century until the XX, embraced Wagner's harmonic language but eschewed the compositional devices associated with modernism. Their compositional approach produced a highly sophisticated Late Romantic music and yet very appealing to a sizable public. The composers Josef Rheinberger, Ludwig Thuille, Max Reger, Alexander Ritter, Max Schillings, August Reu√ü, Walter Courvoisier, Walter Braunfels, Richard Trunk are included in the group. See Selected Songs of the Munich School, 1870‚Äì1920Thuille, Ludwig (preface). Repertoire & Opera Explorer. Musikproduktion H√∂flich. Biography Thuille was born in Bozen, then part of Tyrol, now in Italy. He lost both his parents in 1872 when he was 11, and moved in with his step-uncle in Kremsm√ºnster, Austria. There he sang in the Benedictine choir and studied organ, piano, and violin. His musical abilities were exceptional, so in 1876 the widow of a composer/ conductor, Matthaus Nagiller, took him to Innsbruck for more advanced musical training. There, in the summer of 1877, he met the young Richard Strauss, whose family was visiting the town; the two became lifelong friends. His Innsbruck teacher of organ and theory recommended him to the distinguished composer Josef Rheinberger in Munich, who took him as a pupil in the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater M√ºnchen, from where he graduated with honors in 1882. A year later he became a teacher, and few years thereafter a professor of theory and composition. His many pupils included Hermann Abendroth, Ernest Bloch, Ernst Boehe, Richard Wetz, Paul von Klenau, Rudi Stephan, Walter Braunfels, Henry Kimball Hadley and Walter R. Spalding, who became the head of the Division of Music at Harvard University, and later taught Leroy Anderson. A prolific composer, Thuille concentrated on chamber music - he is remembered principally for his Sextet for piano and wind instruments (1886‚Äì88), the only one of his works to have kept a toehold on the repertoire - and opera, though his early works include a Piano Concerto and a Symphony. In 1897 his opera Theuerdank gained the first prize and a prestigious staged premiere in an operatic competition sponsored by the Regent of Bavaria, in which Alexander von Zemlinsky was placed second. His second opera Lobetanz was premiered the following year in Karlsruhe and was a considerable, if short-lived, success. He also composed a Symphony in F major, much praised by Strauss, five other chamber works, 13 choral pieces, and 78 songs. Despite his friendship with Strauss (which extended to making a 2-piano arrangement of the latter's tone poem Don Juan), and despite his devotion to music-drama, Thuille remained a fairly conservative composer during his brief life. He died at the age of 45 in 1907 in Munich of heart failure. He was married for twenty years to Emma (n√©e Dietl) until his death. They had two children. Though neglected as a composer, Thuille his posthumously-published Harmonielehre (written in collaboration with Rudolf Louis) went through many editions and was highly influential. Widely employed as part of the conservatory curriculum in German speaking countries through the 1960s, the Harmonielehre in two volumes is an important theoretical formulation devoted innovatively to the practices of the Munich School of composers, and remains one of few existing records providing examples of this music. While Thuille's Sextet has always retained a certain following, several of his other compositions have become commercially available on CD only in recent years ‚Äî his two Piano Quintets, the Piano Trio in E-flat, the Piano Concerto in D and the Symphony in F among them.

Born in Audenshaw, Walker was educated at Manchester College of Technology and became a toolmaker. He served in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm and was a lecturer for the National Council of Labour Colleges. Walker was elected Member of Parliament for Doncaster (after 1983 Doncaster Central) at the 1964 general election. He was a junior whip and then junior employment minister in the first Harold Wilson government, and continued being spokesman on employment in opposition, returning to the ministry in 1974. He was Minister of State at the Department of Employment 1976-79 and he became a Privy Counsellor in 1979. When Labour lost the election in 1979, Walker became the opposition spokesman for employment and training. Walker left the employment brief in 1983 following that year's general election, and became Chairman of Ways and Means & Deputy Speaker to Bernard Weatherill. He did not, however, become Speaker when Weatherill retired in 1992, that honour instead going to Betty Boothroyd. He was knighted in 1992 and returned to the backbenches. Walker retired in 1997 and was created a life peer as Baron Walker of Doncaster, of Audenshaw in the County of Greater Manchester on 26 September 1997. In 1998 he became a Deputy Lieutenant of South Yorkshire and Honorary Freeman of Doncaster. Walker died in 2003, aged 76.

Biography Cashion started officiating in 1952 while attending Texas A&M; University, and then worked for various high school and college football conferences, most notably the Southwest Conference. From 1972 to 1996, he officiated in the National Football League (NFL), and was the referee in Super Bowl XX and Super Bowl XXX. Cashion began his career as a line judge in 1972 following the death of referee Jack Vest, which in turn created an opening at line judge when Chuck Heberling was promoted to referee to replace Vest. Cashion was promoted to referee in 1976 upon the retirement of long-time referee Norm Schachter and the addition of Seattle and Tampa Bay. He wore uniform number 43 for most of his career. During the 1979‚Äì1981 seasons, when officials were numbered separately by positions instead of having one number assigned to each official, he wore number 8. Cashion was known by NFL players, coaches, and fans for his signature first down call in which he would enthusiastically drawl \\"First dowwwwwn!\\" out to the crowd. In a 1997 interview with The Sporting News, he said, \\"I don't know of any time that started it or stopped it. It was just something that sort of evolved and been there ever since\\".\\"Last call for ‚Ä¶ 'first dowwwnnn!' - football referee Red Cashion\\" by Dennis Dillon, The Sporting News, January 6, 1997. Cashion's promotion to referee came just one season after the NFL began equipping referees with wireless microphones to explain penalty calls and complex rulings to fans in the stadium, members of the media, and the television audience at home. Cashion was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1999. He also provided the voice of the referee for several versions of the Madden NFL video game. Cashion died at age 87 on February 10, 2019.

Drama critic Mel Gussow has called it \\"the major touring classical theater of the United States.\\" Based in New York City, The Acting Company also sponsors several educational programs for middle school and high school students. The Acting Company was founded in 1972 by John Houseman and Margot Harley. Houseman, a distinguished actor and theater producer, was then the head of the new Drama Division of the Juilliard School. Loath to see the first group of actors disbanded upon graduation from Juilliard, Houseman and his Juilliard colleague Harley founded the \\"Group I Acting Company\\" as a non-profit corporation in New York City to provide employment and make use of their talents. The name was changed to \\"The Acting Company\\" after a few years as the original group I actors were replaced by graduates from many acting conservatories. From its beginnings, the Company toured extensively. As Margot Harley explained in a 2004 interview, \\"We knew perfectly well that in order to keep them together we had to tour, because nobody would come and see, over a long period of time, a young company in New York. And touring is historically a great training ground for an actor.\\" Houseman served as the producing artistic director through 1986; Harley was the Company's producer from its founding until her retirement at the end of 2015. The Company has been affiliated with New York City Center. Starting in 1980, it toured in association with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.. Since 2009, the touring theater productions have been in association with the Guthrie Theater of Minneapolis. Over its history, The Acting Company has produced over 130 plays that have been seen by over 3 million people in 48 states and ten foreign countries. Its educational programs primarily serve students in disadvantaged communities. The Acting Company won Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre in 2003. Its touring company was the subject of a documentary film, Still on the Road (2013), that was directed by Sara Wolkowitz; the film has been widely televised. The Company and its productions have also been honored with a 1975 Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award, The Acting Company's 1975 production of Edward II won a production award. the Obie Award, Citibank's Excellence in Education Award, and two AUDELCO Awards. Over its 40-year history, hundreds of actors beginning their professional careers have been employed in The Acting Company's productions. The Company's alumni include Michael Abbott Jr., Dennis Boutsikaris, Frances Conroy, Kevin Conroy, Keith David, Megan Gallagher, Harriet Harris, Benjamin Hendrickson, Jack Kenny, Kevin Kline, Patti LuPone, Jesse L.

Michaels, and written by Richard Rothstein, Christopher Leitch and Dean Devlin. The film tells the story of Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a former U.S. Army soldier who was killed in the Vietnam War in 1969, and returned to life following a secret military project called the \\"Universal Soldier\\" program. However, he finds out about his past even though his memory was erased, and escapes alongside a young TV journalist (Ally Walker). Along the way, they have to deal with the return of his archenemy, Sgt. Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren), who had lost his sanity in the Vietnam War, and became a psychotic megalomaniac, intent on killing him and leading the Universal Soldiers. Universal Soldier was released by TriStar Pictures on July 10, 1992. The film has a 33% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and grossed $80 million worldwide against its budget of $23 million and spawned a series of films, including several rather poorly received direct-to-TV films: Universal Soldier: The Return, which has since been removed from the series canon, followed by Universal Soldier: Regeneration and Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning. Plot In 1969, a U.S. Army team is ordered to secure a village against North Vietnamese forces. Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude van Damme) discovers members of his squad and villagers murdered, all with their ears removed. Deveraux finds his sergeant, Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren), who has gone insane and made a necklace of severed ears and who is holding a young couple hostage. Deveraux, who is near the end of his tour of duty, tries to reason with Scott, who executes the man and orders Deveraux to shoot the girl to prove his loyalty. Deveraux refuses and tries to save the girl, but she is killed by a grenade thrown by Scott. After shooting each other to death, Deveraux and Scott's corpses are recovered by a second squad and cryogenically frozen, their deaths classified as \\"missing in action\\". Deveraux and Scott's corpses are reanimated decades later (but with their memories lost) and selected for the \\"Universal Soldier\\" (UniSol) program, an elite counter- terrorism unit. They are deployed via an Aero Spacelines Mini Guppy to the Hoover Dam to resolve a hostage situation. The team demonstrates their superior training and physical abilities against the terrorists, such as when GR76 (Ralf M√∂ller) withstands close-range rifle fire. After the area is secured, Deveraux begins to regain memory from his former life upon seeing two hostages who strongly resemble the villagers he tried to save in Vietnam, causing him to disobey commands from the control team and become unresponsive. In the mobile command center, it is revealed that the UniSols are genetically augmented soldiers with enhanced self-healing abilities and superior strength, but they also have a tendency to overheat and shut down. They are given a neural serum to keep their minds susceptible and their past memory suppressed. As a result of the glitch, Woodward (Leon Rippy), one of the technicians on the project, feels it may be better to remove Deveraux from the team until he can be further analyzed, but UniSol commander Colonel Perry (Ed O'Ross) refuses. TV journalist Veronica Roberts (Ally Walker), who was fired while covering the Hoover Dam incident, tries to get a story on the UniSol project in order to get her job back. Roberts sneaks onto the base with a cameraman, discovering GR76 immersed in ice, still alive despite normally-fatal injuries. When her presence is noticed, Deveraux and Scott are ordered to capture her dead or alive. She flees to her cameraman's car, but they crash. Scott coldly murders the cameraman against orders before Deveraux stops him from shooting Roberts. Together, Deveraux and Roberts escape in a UniSol vehicle. Colonel Perry insists on preventing knowledge of the UniSol program getting out and sends the remaining UniSols to find Deveraux and Roberts. Deveraux and Roberts flee to a motel, where Roberts discovers she has been framed for the murder of her cameraman. Deveraux collapses from overheating and has to take an ice bath. The UniSols completely destroy the motel but Deveraux and Roberts hide in a bed until they leave and steal a car. The couple flee to a gas station where Deveraux has Roberts remove a tracking device from his leg. They set a trap and when the UniSols arrive the gas station explodes. Colonel Perry terminates the mission after this failure and Scott's previously insane personality resurfaces, causing him to kill Perry and all but two doctors. Deveraux and Roberts sneak onto the command center bus and steal UniSol documents. Scott then takes control of the mindlessly obedient UniSol team, commanding them to kill Deveraux and Roberts. Deveraux continues to regain his memories while Roberts tries to find out more information about the UniSol program. They go to a diner; Deveraux devours plate after plate of food until the waitress asks how he's going to pay for it all. When Deveraux looks blankly at her, she calls out Hank (Allan Graf), the cook, who threatens him. However, Deveraux, though innocently saying he doesn't want to hurt him, easily beats Hank and every single patron who steps up to take him on. Using information from the stolen documents, Roberts gets in contact with a doctor linked to the program. Roberts and Deveraux meet Dr. Christopher Gregor (Jerry Orbach) who informs them that the UniSol project was started in the 1960s in order to develop the perfect soldier. Although they were able to reanimate dead humans, they were never able to overcome the body's need for cooling. The other major problem is that memories of the last moments of life are greatly amplified; Scott believes he is still in Vietnam fighting insurgents. When Deveraux and Roberts leave the doctor's home, they are caught and arrested by the police. En route to jail, the police convoy is ambushed by Scott and GR76. A chase ensues, ending when the police bus and the UniSol truck both drive off a cliff in the Grand Canyon and explode, killing GR76. Deveraux and Roberts head to Deveraux's family farm in Louisiana. After Deveraux is reunited with his parents, Scott appears and takes the family and Roberts hostage. A brutal fight ensues, and Scott's use of muscle enhancers enables him to beat Deveraux mercilessly. Roberts manages to escape, only to be seemingly killed by a grenade thrown by Scott. Deveraux grabs the muscle enhancers Scott used and injects himself. Now evenly matched, Deveraux fights back and is able to impale Scott on the spikes of a hay harvester. Deveraux then starts the machine up, grinding Scott to death. Roberts is revealed to have survived the explosion, and she and Deveraux embrace.

Carolco, the company that produced the film, was having financial troubles and hoped that the film's box office return would keep them afloat. At the 1992 Cannes Film Festival, Van Damme and Lundgren were involved in a verbal altercation that almost turned physical when both men pushed each other only to be separated. On his website, Dolph Lundgren confirmed that it was just a publicity stunt to promote the film. It was the last film that used the multi-channel surround sound format, Cinema Digital Sound. Release=Home media=Alternative ending The Special Edition DVD release features an alternative ending which starts shortly after Scott takes Deveraux's family and Roberts hostage. As Deveraux grabs a shotgun in the kitchen, the front door opens and he sees his mother at the door before Scott shoots her to death. In the final fight between Deveraux and Scott, Deveraux does not use Scott's muscle enhancers. Shortly after grinding Scott to death, Deveraux is shot by his \\"father\\" before Dr. Christopher Gregor and his men appear. Gregor explains that he used Deveraux to entrap both him and Scott, and that Deveraux was staying with people posing as his parents. He then has his men shoot Deveraux, but, before Deveraux dies, the police and Roberts' news crew arrive. The news crew douse Deveraux with a fire extinguisher to stabilize him while Dr. Gregor and his men are arrested. Roberts is given the microphone to cover the arrest, but she loses all composure while on the air, dropping the microphone to comfort Deveraux. Several days later, Deveraux is reunited with his real parents. The film ends with a eulogy narrated by Roberts, who explains that Deveraux rejected all life-prolonging medication before dying a natural death. Reception=Box office= Universal Soldier opened in theaters on July 10, 1992 where it grossed $10,057,084 from 1916 theaters with a $5,249 per screen average.

On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 33% based on reviews from 33 critics. The site's consensus states: \\"Universal Soldier unites a pair of veteran action stars behind a potentially intriguing premise, but on this battlefield, entertainment value is largely AWOL.\\" On Metacritic it has a score of 35% based on reviews from 15 critics.https://www.metacritic.com/movie/universal- soldier Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. In a retrospective review, Drew Taylor from IndieWire said: \\"This movie rules. The introduction of the Emmerich/Devlin double-team, this high concept, moderately budgeted sci-fi action movie is a bouillabaisse of clich√©s that somehow manages to be a charming, funny, often positively thrilling B-grade treat.\\" Other media=SequelsComics= NOW Comics published a three part comic miniseries based on the movie, running from September to November 1992.

The spaceship levels from the original were replaced with 'platforming' levels set in a jungle, the player sprite was changed to look more human, as were some enemies. The resulting product received mostly negative reviews compared to the critically acclaimed home computer release.https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/universal-soldier ReferencesExternal links   Category:1992 films Category:1990s science fiction action films Category:American films Category:American science fiction action films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in 1969 Category:Films set in Arizona Category:Films set in Louisiana Category:Films set in Nevada Category:Films set in Vietnam Category:Films shot in Arizona Category:Films shot in Nevada Category:Martial arts science fiction films Category:Universal Soldier (film series) Category:Carolco Pictures films Category:TriStar Pictures films Category:StudioCanal films Category:Films directed by Roland Emmerich Category:Military science fiction films Category:Films about the United States Army Category:Films scored by Christopher Franke Category:Vietnam War films Category:Resurrection in film ","title":"Universal Soldier (1992 film)"},{"id":"3948461","text":"Giuliano Gozi (7 August 1894 ‚Äì 18 January 1955) was Captain-Regent of San Marino 5 times between April 1923 and April 1942.

Marker interfaces have traditionally been limited to those interfaces intended for explicit, runtime verification (normally via instanceof). A design marker is a marker interface used to document a design choice. In Java programs the design choice is documented in the marker interface's Javadoc documentation. Many choices made at software design time cannot be directly expressed in today's implementation languages like C# and Java. These design choices (known by names like Design Pattern, Design Contract, Refactoring, Effective Programming Idioms, Blueprints, etc.) must be implemented via programming and naming conventions, because they go beyond the built-in functionality of production programming languages. The consequences of this limitation conspire over time to erode design investments as well as to promote a false segregation between the designer and implementer mindsets. Two independent proposals recognize these problems and give the same basic strategies for tackling them. Until now, the budding Explicit Programming movement has been linked to the use of an experimental Java research tool called ELIDE. The Design Markers technique requires only standard Javadoc-like tools to garner many of the benefits of Explicit Programming.

Starting in 1995, he made this database freely available for download from the Internet, helping to launch a new era of baseball research by making the raw data available to everyone. In addition to fostering research, the Lahman Database also made it possible for baseball simulation games, such as Baseball Mogul and Out of the Park Baseball, to recreate historical seasons from actual baseball history. In the mid-1990s, Lahman created the first online baseball encyclopedia at his Baseball Archive website. He later sold the website to Total Sports and became senior editor for that company's print publishing division. The encyclopedia disappeared from the web when Total Sports declared bankruptcy. It was later reborn as Baseball-Reference.com, and Lahman resurrected the Baseball Archive website as a platform to continue the free distribution of his database.

It is located at the corner of West 25th Street and Lorain Avenue in the Ohio City neighborhood. On December 18, 1973, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. History The market began operating in 1840, across the street from its current location. Josiah Barber and Richard Lord, prominent businessmen and both former mayors of Ohio City before it was incorporated into Cleveland, donated land to Ohio City's government, stipulating that the tract be used for an open-air neighborhood market. The market space became a center of the Ohio City community for the next three decades and other benefactors donated adjacent lands allowing the marketplace to expand. In 1868, a one-story, wooden framed building was erected on the site, and the newly christened Pearl Street Market was opened. Thanks to brisk population growth in Cleveland and Ohio City in the latter part of the 19th century, the market outgrew its space again. In 1902, lands were purchased across the street from the Pearl Market site to allow for market expansion and eventual construction of additional indoor market space. Cleveland architectural firm Hubbell and Benes was contracted to create the new indoor space and, after nearly a decade of planning and construction, the current West Side Market building was completed in 1912 at a cost of nearly $680,000. The Neo-Classical/Byzantine building is a brick construct with a large interior concourse that provides nearly 100 stalls for sellers and an 85-stall outdoor produce arcade that wraps around the side and rear of the main building. In addition, the building has a large clock tower, easily visible from most of Ohio City in the building's early days. Postcard of the West Side Market, circa 1912 In 1915, the permanent building spurred sellers to establish the West Side Market Tenants' Association, a coalition founded to help maintain the market and organize for future improvements and additions. This organization exists at the Market today. Periodic upgrades accommodated more tenants and maintained and improved the overall conditions. A fuller, $1.1 million modernization was undertaken in 1953 to add lower-level storage areas and upgrade stalls in the arcade. Another renovation, this one for $5 million, took place after the Market was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The market's profile rose in the latter 20th century. Politicians passing through Cleveland often stopped in to sample the array of foods sold at the market on any given day. The market also began sponsoring major food festivals in the neighborhood which drew people from Cleveland and the rest of the world. Despite the successes of the 1980s, however, the market began to face financial straits as Cleveland itself was experiencing monetary struggles. A large portion of the market's subsidies from the city dried up, leaving tenants facing higher rents to keep the market open. Yet the market expanded and was renovated throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century. A 2004 project enclosed and added space heating to the arcade portion of the market, as well as completed major interior and architectural renovations to the main building. The market's centennial was celebrated in 2012. Interior of the market Most residents of the neighborhood and many Clevelanders still do a large portion of their shopping at the market. The market is open to customers Mondays and Wednesdays from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays from 7:00 a.m to 6:00 p.m., and Sundays from 12 p.m to 4:00 p.m. The market attracts tourists from all parts of the United States, who visit and learn about its history. Guided tours are offered. Its national profile has been boosted in recent years by coverage on various programs produced by the Travel Channel and Food Network. Many stalls have remained under individual family control for much of the life of the market, several dating to 1912. The market's tenants and sellers reflect the cultural diversity of the surrounding neighborhood and Cleveland as a whole. The current roster of tenants includes those of Irish, German, Slovene, Italian, Hungarian, Greek, Polish, Russian, and Middle Eastern descent, among others. In the September 2010 issue of Food Network Magazine, the West Side Market was named America's \\"Best Food Lovers' Market.\\" An outdoor section of the market On January 30, 2013, the market was temporarily closed after a fire left smoke and soot damage. In 2016 city officials announced that starting April 3 of that year the market would add regular Sunday hours for the first time in its history.

This now-modest stream once posed a significant flooding threat to the area. (November 2005) The River Moselle, also referred to as Moselle Brook, is in North London and flows through Tottenham towards the Lea Valley. The river was originally a tributary of the River Lea, but it now flows into Pymmes Brook, another Lea tributary. Description The name derives from 'Mosse-Hill' in Hornsey, the high ground containing one of the river's sources, and bears no direct etymological relationship to the major continental Moselle River.The Moselle has a number of sources on the high ground from Muswell Hill to Highgate - Albert Pinching & David Bell, Haringey's Hidden Streams Revealed, 2005 The hill area also gave its name to the district of Muswell Hill and for a time the river was known as the Moswell. It flows north-eastward to Lordship Recreation Ground, then to High Road by the junction with White Hart Lane, then along High Road to a point near Scotland Green, and then flows eastward to the River Lea. The Moselle has quite a modest flow in modern times, but it once posed a serious flooding threat to Tottenham. Until the 19th century, the whole of the river remained above ground, but in 1836 the stretch around Tottenham High Road and White Hart Lane was covered over. More major culverting occurred in 1906 and subsequent years, so that now the river is completely enclosed from Tottenham Cemetery to the point at which it runs into Pymme's Brook.

The family is recognised as distinct in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group IV system (2016). The family consists of two genera of aquatic plants, Brasenia and Cabomba, totalling six species. The Cabombaceae are all aquatic, living in still or slow-moving waters of temperate and tropical North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. Although found on all continents but Antarctica, the plants tend to grow in relatively restricted ranges. The family has an extensive fossil record from the Cretaceous with plants that exhibit affinities to either the Cabombaceae or Nymphaceae occurring in the Early Cretaceous. One such likely Cretaceous member is the genus Pluricarpellatia, found in rocks 115 million years old in what is now Brazil. The APG system of 1998 included this family in the water lily family Nymphaeaceae, as did the APG II system, of 2003 (optionally). The APG III and APG IV systems of classification separated the family Cabombaceae from the family Nymphaceae.

It is an experimental alternative to Halon 1301 (CBrF3) in unoccupied areas. It would be used as a gaseous fire suppression flooding agent for in-flight aircraft and electronic equipment fires. Chemistry It is used in the rhodium-catalyzed Œ±-trifluoromethylation of Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketones. It can be used as a new generation fire extinguishing agent to replace Halon in fire protection systems. The mechanism of extinguishing fires for CF3I is active and primarily based on interruption of the chain reaction in the combustion area of the flame by so-called \\"negative\\" catalytic action. It is also used as an eco- friendly insulation gas to replace SF6 in electrical power industry. In the presence of sunlight or at temperatures above 100 ¬∞C it can react with water, forming hazardous by-products such as hydrogen fluoride (HF), hydrogen iodide (HI) and carbonyl fluoride (COF2). Environmental effects Trifluoroiodomethane contains carbon, fluorine, and iodine atoms. Although iodine is several hundred times more efficient at destroying stratospheric ozone than chlorine, experiments have shown that because the weak C-I bond breaks easily under the influence of water (owing to the electron-attracting fluorine atoms), trifluoroiodomethane has an ozone depleting potential less than one-thousandth that of Halon 1301 (0.008-0.01). Its atmospheric lifetime, at less than 1 month, is less than 1 percent that of Halon 1301, and less even than hydrogen chloride formed from volcanoes. There is, however, still the problem of the C-F bonds absorbing in the atmospheric window. However, the IPCC has calculated the 100-year global warming potential of trifluoroiodomethane to be 0.4 (i.e., 40% of that of CO2).

Given the training focus and difficulty of the RSLC, the school is still commonly attended by operators from U.S. Army Special Forces, the 75th Ranger Regiment's Regimental Reconnaissance Company, Navy SEALs, and Marine reconnaissance units; today's students also come from more conventional infantry, Stryker and armored Brigade Combat Teams (BCT). Following the US Army decision to disband US Army LRS companies, the reconnaissance fundamentals taught in the course also provides U.S. military commanders the ability to preserve key LRS skills and abilities within the conventional force. Given the importance of timely, accurate and relevant battlefield information, U.S. Military commanders require reconnaissance professionals be well-trained, highly skilled and disciplined, and capable of operating forward of BCTs. The course curriculum is primarily designed to train small unit leaders assigned to reconnaissance formations to include infantry, Stryker and armored BCT cavalry squadrons; infantry, Stryker, and Combined Arms Battalion (CAB) scout platoons; and special operations forces. The RSLC program of Instruction (PoI) is continuously assessed and refined to ensure it meets these needs, the needs of reconnaissance units, and those of a U.S. Joint force at war. History In 1958, the commanding general of the 101st Airborne Division, Major General William Westmoreland, noticed a failing of proficiency and initiative in squad, fireteam, and patrol leaders during an exercise code named White Cloud. General (GEN) Westmoreland was a veteran of the Invasion of Normandy and realized the importance of small unit leaders and individuals who had been separated from their parent units to take action against superior enemy forces. GEN Westmoreland decided that his division needed relevant training to rectify their deficiencies before their deployment.Recondo School - Vietnam, Office of the Chief of Information, U.S. Army Pictorial Center, Joe Doakes' YouTube Channel, posted 22 January 2015, last accessed 28 November 2017Special Ops, Recondo School, The History Channel, via –∞–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π —Ñ–∏—Å–µ–Ω–∫–æ YouTube Channel, posted 18 April 2013, last accessed 9 December 2017 The U.S. Army sent many of their officers and senior non-commissioned officers to Ranger School. However, not every unit leader could be sent to the course. Second Lieutenant Donald Bernstein suggested that some of the 101st Airborne's Ranger trained personnel start a school for the entire division in small unit tactics. When the idea was brought to GEN Westmoreland he recommended that Major Lewis L. Millett command the two-week school. The course was named the Recondo School, a combination of the words \\"reconnaissance\\" and \\"doughboy\\" or \\"commando.\\"25th Infantry Division Vietnam CRIPS Recon, 25thinfantrycrips.com, last accessed 10 December 2017 From the early 1960s through the mid 1980s, there was more than one Recondo School in the U.S. Army. The U.S. Military Academy, the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), the 5th Infantry Division, the 25th Infantry Division, the 82nd Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division, and the XVIII Airborne Corps all had their own Recondo Schools with their own course of instruction.82nd/XVIII Airborne Recondo School, Facebook, last accessed 10 December 2017 MACV's Recondo School was a three-week course conducted in Vietnam and was taught by members of the 5th Special Forces Group. The first week of training focused on classroom instruction, the second week on air operations, and the third week used real reconnaissance missions to teach students the critical skills needed to successfully infiltrate, observer, report, evade, and extract using small unit tactics in a jungle environment. This real-world training endeared the MACV Recondo School with the nickname, \\"The deadliest school on Earth.\\" The other U.S. Army Recondo Schools had a two or three week curriculum conducted at the home garrison of the perspective unit and focused on training students in the fundamentals of: * Communications * Land navigation * Mountaineering * Patrolling * Tracking * Pathfinder techniques * Call for indirect fire * Combat demolition * Hand-to- hand combat * Survival and evasion Vietnam Era RECONDO Patch The insignia of the Recondo Schools, which was also worn as a patch on the right pocket of Recondo graduates, was an arrowhead pointing downwards to symbolize assault from the sky to the ground in the colors of black and white to signify operations by day and night. Although each Recondo School had its own insignia and patch, the downward-facing arrowhead and black and white theme remained the same. The MACV Recondo School officially closed on 31 December 1970. The other U.S. Army division and corps Recondo Schools either carried-on with their curriculum or disbanded throughout the 1970s and '80s. In 1986, the Long Range Surveillance Leaders Course was established to fill a void that existed in Ranger training when LRSUs were reactivated that same year. To fulfill this requirement, the course was initially designed to emphasize the mission essential tasks drawn from lessons learned from previous long-range reconnaissance patrol operations in the jungles of Southeast Asia. In 2002, the course was renamed the Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leader Course (RSLC) and was taught by the 4th Ranger Training Battalion prior to unit reorganization at the Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Benning.Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course, Executive Summary, 4th Ranger Training Battalion, last accessed 28 November 2017 In 2019, the US Army Training and Doctrine Command decided to move RSLC back under the control of the 4th Ranger Training Battalion. Training An instructor walks students through a properly sub-surface hide-site during \\"Phase one\\" of RSLC's first overseas MTT course in Lithuania, circa 2016 The RSLC is designed to provide instruction to students through resident instruction at Fort Benning, Georgia. Located on Camp Cornett at Fort Benning's Harmony Church cantonment area, the RSLC PoI is tailored to train and test the fundamentals of reconnaissance operations for Soldiers and leaders assigned to reconnaissance teams and squads. Therefore, priority for training is to team leaders and above (pay grades of E-4s and above) assigned oversight of small unit reconnaissance operations without prior reconnaissance training and experience. In addition to resident course instruction, the RSLC PoI provides opportunities to deliver menu-based training through Mobile Training Teams (MTT) at a requesting unit's home station location. Menu-based training enables unit commanders to meet specific reconnaissance focused training priorities without sacrificing other training needs in support of a unit's operational mission requirements. While resident course instruction has priority over menu-based MTT instruction, the RSLC cadre will work to meet every unit's training needs. =Phase one= During the first week, students execute a seven-hour land navigation course in which they move under load, cross-country, during daylight and limited visibility, covering approximately 15 kilometers. They receive an introduction to the fundamentals of reconnaissance and surveillance and are taught how to maximize the capabilities of the equipment in the Army‚Äôs inventory such as optics, thermals, and cameras. Students learn how to camouflage themselves and equipment, stalking, and selection, occupation, and concealment of surveillance sites. The first week ends with an airborne operation that can accommodate both static line and Military Free-Fall qualified paratroopers. =Phase two= Students practice configuring their radios prior to communications exam during \\"Phase two\\" of RSLC Week two begins with a two-day communications class that teaches students how to send messages and data across the frequency spectrum, utilizing High Frequency (HF), Very High Frequency (VHF), and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radios. This skill enables students to send reports and pictures to their maneuver commander in near real time. Building on the training from the previous week, students conduct area and zone reconnaissance practical exercises to hone their field craft and improve their reporting formats. Students are also introduced to insertion and extraction techniques by conducting Fast Rope Insertion/Extraction System (FRIES) and Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction System (SPIES) training. =Phase three= A student uses an optical rangefinder to observe an urban environment during \\"Phase three\\" of RSLC The final two weeks are spent with students learning how to plan an operation using the Troop Leading Procedures (TLPs) and incorporating air movement, fires, and evasion and recovery planning. Following the orders process, students conduct a 48-hour non-graded Situational Training Exercise (STX) where they will execute the mission they just planned under the watchful eye of RSLC instructors, allowing the students to ask questions and receive assistance along the way. Once this mission is complete and After-Action Reviews (AARs) are conducted, the students go into isolation planning for their graded culminating Field Training Exercise (FTX). Throughout the FTX, students will execute and be graded on all the skills they learned from planning, reconnaissance and surveillance operations, intelligence reporting techniques, communications, fires, evasion and recovery, and small unit tactics to name a few. The end result is a graduate with the skill to plan and conduct a myriad of reconnaissance and surveillance operations, enhancing the ability of any brigade combat team. Upon successful completion of the RSLC course, U.S. Army graduates are awarded the Six Bravo (6B) additional skill identifier.

Near a hyperbolic point the orbits of a two-dimensional, non- dissipative system resemble hyperbolas. This fails to hold in general. Strogatz notes that \\"hyperbolic is an unfortunate name‚Äîit sounds like it should mean 'saddle point'‚Äîbut it has become standard.\\" Several properties hold about a neighborhood of a hyperbolic point, notably Orbits near a two- dimensional saddle point, an example of a hyperbolic equilibrium. * A stable manifold and an unstable manifold exist, * Shadowing occurs, * The dynamics on the invariant set can be represented via symbolic dynamics, * A natural measure can be defined, * The system is structurally stable.  Maps  If T \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} is a C1 map and p is a fixed point then p is said to be a hyperbolic fixed point when the Jacobian matrix \\\\operatorname{D} T (p) has no eigenvalues on the unit circle. One example of a map whose only fixed point is hyperbolic is Arnold's cat map: :\\\\begin{bmatrix} x_{n+1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_{n+1} \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_n\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_n\\\\end{bmatrix} Since the eigenvalues are given by :\\\\lambda_1=\\\\frac{3+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2} :\\\\lambda_2=\\\\frac{3-\\\\sqrt{5}}{2} We know that the Lyapunov exponents are: :\\\\lambda_1=\\\\frac{\\\\ln(3+\\\\sqrt{5})}{2}>1 :\\\\lambda_2=\\\\frac{\\\\ln(3-\\\\sqrt{5})}{2}<1 Therefore it is a saddle point.  Flows  Let F \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} be a C1 vector field with a critical point p, i.e., F(p) = 0, and let J denote the Jacobian matrix of F at p. If the matrix J has no eigenvalues with zero real parts then p is called hyperbolic. Hyperbolic fixed points may also be called hyperbolic critical points or elementary critical points. The Hartman‚ÄìGrobman theorem states that the orbit structure of a dynamical system in a neighbourhood of a hyperbolic equilibrium point is topologically equivalent to the orbit structure of the linearized dynamical system. = Example = Consider the nonlinear system : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{dx}{dt} & = y, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] \\\\frac{dy}{dt} & = -x-x^3-\\\\alpha y,~ \\\\alpha e 0 \\\\end{align} (0, 0) is the only equilibrium point. The linearization at the equilibrium is :J(0,0) = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{rr} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & -\\\\alpha \\\\end{array} \\\\right]. The eigenvalues of this matrix are \\\\frac{-\\\\alpha \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha^2-4}}{2}. For all values of Œ± ‚â† 0, the eigenvalues have non-zero real part. Thus, this equilibrium point is a hyperbolic equilibrium point. The linearized system will behave similar to the non-linear system near (0, 0). When Œ± = 0, the system has a nonhyperbolic equilibrium at (0, 0).

Its southern terminus is near Los Algodones, Baja California, and its northern terminus is near Winterhaven, California in the location of Araz Junction. The route is only long, heading along the length of the Alamo Canal and the All-American Canal within the boundaries of the Fort Yuma-Quechan Reservation. The route was assigned in 1972 in Imperial County, and the interchange with I-8 was constructed a year later.  Route description  Border crossing into Los Algodones from Andrade, California at the southern end of SR 186 SR 186 begins at the United States‚ÄìMexico border (near Avenue International) in the community of Los Algodones. The route heads to the northeast along the Alamo Canal and crosses the center of the Fort Yuma-Quechan Reservation. Most of the surroundings of SR 186 are desolate, compared to the developed region across the border in Mexico. The highway continues northward, crossing the All- American Canal, where it turns to the north. SR 186 continues northward to an interchange with I-8 in Araz Junction, where the route terminates at the northbound ramps. The route continues northward as locally maintained Araz Road. Near the interchange is a casino operated by the Quechan Native American tribe that opened in 2009. SR 186 is not part of the National Highway System,a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. In 2014, SR 186 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 3,800 vehicles at the southern end, and 8,200 vehicles at the junction with I-8, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.  History  A road south from the Ocean-to- Ocean Highway to the Mexican border just west of the Colorado River existed by 1917, and was paved between 1956 and 1965. The Andrade Port of Entry at the southern end of the highway was built in 1970. The current alignment of SR 186 was assigned in 1972 by the California State Legislature. There are two bridges along the alignment of SR 186. The first one to be constructed was a concrete slab bridge over the All-American Canal, with the structure opening in 1938. The bridge is long, and is considered unable to sustain the traffic it was designed to handle. The second bridge is located at the interchange with I-8 in Araz Junction. This bridge, constructed in 1973 (a year after the route was assigned), is a concrete box beam structure. This structure, unlike the other, is recorded to be in usable shape.

The route was assigned in the area in 1972, and has remained intact since. Route description SR 188, with Tecate in the background State Route 188 or Tecate Road begins at the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border in the community of Tecate, Baja California; this border crossing handled roughly four percent of all traffic in between Baja California and California during 2008. The route progresses northward, passing through a large commercial district in Tecate, California. The highway heads to an intersection with Thing Road, where it turns to the northeast and out of the commercial district. The route continues to the northeast, intersecting with Humphries Road, where the surroundings become highly undeveloped. SR 188 continues to an intersection with SR 94 a short distance out of Potrero, where the designation ends and right-of-way merges into SR 94.

History The original alignment of SR 188, when routes where first assigned, was designated as Legislative Route 94. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, SR 188 was officially defined as \\"the south end of Fallen Leaf Lake to Route 89 near Camp Richardson\\"; this was later removed in 1965. A road from the town of Potrero to Tecate existed by 1917. The Tecate border crossing originally opened in 1932. In 1938, the San Diego County board of supervisors proposed moving rerouting the road to be shorter and on more level ground, although there was opposition from local residents and businesses who favored the old road. However, the route of the road to Tecate has remained the same since then. The current routing of SR 188 was assigned in 1972. The route has remained virtually unchanged since. The Tecate border crossing expanded through the opening of the Tecate Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Facility, including truck scales; this was completed in 2008, with past expansions to the crossing having been completed in 2004 and 2005.

Subsequently, the concept of center manifolds was realised to be fundamental to mathematical modelling. Center manifolds play an important role in bifurcation theory because interesting behavior takes place on the center manifold and in multiscale mathematics because the long time dynamics of the micro-scale often are attracted to a relatively simple center manifold involving the coarse scale variables.  Informal example Saturn's rings sit in the center manifold defined by tidal forces. Saturn's rings provide a rough example of the center manifold of the tidal forces acting on particles within the rings. Tidal forces have a characteristic \\"compress and stretch\\" action on bodies, with the compressing direction defining the stable manifold, the stretching direction defining the unstable manifold, and the neutral direction being the center manifold. In the case of Saturn, a particle in orbit above or below the rings will cross the rings, and, from the viewpoint of the rings, it will appear to oscillate from above to below the plane and back. Thus, it appears that the rings are \\"attractive\\". Friction, via collisions with other particles in the rings, will dampen those oscillations; thus they will decrease. Such converging trajectories are characteristic of the stable manifold: particles in the stable manifold come closer together. Particles within the ring will have an orbital radius that is a random walk: as they meet in close encounters with other particles in the ring, they will exchange energy in those encounters, and thus alter their radius. In this sense, the space where the rings lie is neutral: there are no further forces upwards or downwards (out of the plane of the rings), nor inwards or outwards (changing the radius within the rings). This example is a bit confusing, as, properly speaking, the stable, unstable and neutral manifolds do not divide up the coordinate space; they divide up the phase space. In this case, the phase space has the structure of a tangent manifold: for every point in space (a 3D position), there is the collection of \\"tangent vectors\\": all possible velocities a particle might have. Some position-velocity pairs are driven towards the center manifold, others are flung away from it. Those that are in the center manifold are susceptible to small perturbations that generally push them about randomly, and often push them out of the center manifold. That is, small perturbations tend to destabilize points in the center manifold: the center manifold behaves like a saddle point, or rather, an extended collection of saddle points. There are dramatic counterexamples to this idea of instability at the center manifold; see Lagrangian coherent structure for detailed examples. A much more sophisticated example is the Anosov flow on tangent bundles of Riemann surfaces. In that case, one can write a very explicit and precise splitting of the tangent space into three parts: the unstable and stable bundles, with the neutral manifold wedged in the middle between these two. This example is elegant, in the sense that it does not require any approximations or hand-waving: it is exactly solvable. It is a relatively straightforward and simple example for those acquainted with the general outline of Lie groups and Riemann surfaces.  Definition  Center (red) and unstable (green) manifolds of saddle-node equilibrium point of the system \\\\dot x=x^2, \\\\dot y=y. Randomly selected points of the 2D phase space converge exponentially to a 1D center manifold on which dynamics are slow (non exponential). Studying dynamics of the center manifold determines the stability of the non-hyperbolic fixed point at the origin. The center manifold of a dynamical system is based upon an equilibrium point of that system. A center manifold of the equilibrium then consists of those nearby orbits that neither decay exponentially quickly, nor grow exponentially quickly. Mathematically, the first step when studying equilibrium points of dynamical systems is to linearize the system, and then compute its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvectors (and generalized eigenvectors if they occur) corresponding to eigenvalues with negative real part form a basis for the stable eigenspace. The (generalized) eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues with positive real part form the unstable eigenspace. If the equilibrium point is hyperbolic (that is, all eigenvalues of the linearization have nonzero real part), then the Hartman-Grobman theorem guarantees that these eigenvalues and eigenvectors completely characterise the systems dynamics near the equilibrium. However, if the equilibrium has eigenvalues whose real part is zero, then the corresponding (generalized) eigenvectors form the center eigenspace‚Äîfor a ball, the center eigenspace is the entire set of unforced rigid body dynamics. Going beyond the linearization, when we account for perturbations by nonlinearity or forcing in the dynamical system, the center eigenspace deforms to the nearby center manifold. If the eigenvalues are precisely zero (as they are for the ball), rather than just real-part being zero, then the corresponding eigenspace more specifically gives rise to a slow manifold. The behavior on the center (slow) manifold is generally not determined by the linearization and thus may be difficult to construct. Analogously, nonlinearity or forcing in the system perturbs the stable and unstable eigenspaces to a nearby stable manifold and nearby unstable manifold. These three types of manifolds are three cases of an invariant manifold. Algebraically, let \\\\frac{d\\\\textbf{x}}{dt} = \\\\textbf{f}(\\\\textbf{x}) be a dynamical system with equilibrium point \\\\textbf{x}^*. The linearization of the system near the equilibrium point is :\\\\frac{d\\\\textbf{x}}{dt} = A\\\\textbf{x}, \\\\quad \\\\text{where } A = \\\\frac{d\\\\textbf{f}}{d\\\\textbf{x}}(\\\\textbf{x}^*). The Jacobian matrix A defines three main subspaces: * the stable subspace, which is spanned by the generalized eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues \\\\lambda with \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\lambda<0; * the unstable subspace, which is spanned by the generalized eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues \\\\lambda with \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\lambda>0; * the center subspace, which is spanned by the generalized eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues \\\\lambda with \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\lambda=0. Depending upon the application, other subspaces of interest include center-stable, center-unstable, sub-center, slow, and fast subspaces. These subspaces are all invariant subspaces of the linearized equation. Corresponding to the linearized system, the nonlinear system has invariant manifolds, each consisting of sets of orbits of the nonlinear system., Section 3.2 * An invariant manifold tangent to the stable subspace and with the same dimension is the stable manifold. * The unstable manifold is of the same dimension and tangent to the unstable subspace. * A center manifold is of the same dimension and tangent to the center subspace. If, as is common, the eigenvalues of the center subspace are all precisely zero, rather than just real part zero, then a center manifold is often called a slow manifold.  Center manifold theorems  The center manifold existence theorem states that if the right-hand side function \\\\textbf{f}(\\\\textbf{x}) is C^r (r times continuously differentiable), then at every equilibrium point there exists a neighborhood of some finite size in which there is at least one of , Theorem 3.2.1 * a unique C^r stable manifold, * a unique C^r unstable manifold, * and a (not necessarily unique) C^{r-1} center manifold. In example applications, a nonlinear coordinate transform to a normal form can clearly separate these three manifolds. A web service currently undertakes the necessary computer algebra for a range of finite-dimensional systems. In the case when the unstable manifold does not exist, center manifolds are often relevant to modelling. The center manifold emergence theorem then says that the neighborhood may be chosen so that all solutions of the system staying in the neighborhood tend exponentially quickly to some solution \\\\textbf{y}(t) on the center manifold. That is, \\\\textbf{x}(t)=\\\\textbf{y}(t)+\\\\mathcal{O}(e^{-\\\\beta' t}) \\\\quad\\\\text{as } t\\\\to\\\\infty\\\\,, for some rate \\\\beta'. This theorem asserts that for a wide variety of initial conditions the solutions of the full system decay exponentially quickly to a solution on the relatively low dimensional center manifold. A third theorem, the approximation theorem, asserts that if an approximate expression for such invariant manifolds, say \\\\textbf{x}=\\\\textbf{X}(\\\\textbf{s}), satisfies the differential equation for the system to residuals \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\textbf{s}^p) as \\\\textbf{s}\\\\to\\\\textbf{0}, then the invariant manifold is approximated by \\\\textbf{x}=\\\\textbf{X}(\\\\textbf{s}) to an error of the same order, namely \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\textbf{s}^p). = Center manifolds of infinite-D and/or of non- autonomous systems = However, some applications, such as to dispersion in tubes or channels, require an infinite-dimensional center manifold. The most general and powerful theory was developed by Aulbach and Wanner. They addressed non-autonomous dynamical systems \\\\frac{d\\\\textbf{x}}{dt} = \\\\textbf{f}(\\\\textbf{x},t) in infinite dimensions, with potentially infinite dimensional stable, unstable and center manifolds. Further, they usefully generalised the definition of the manifolds so that the center manifold is associated with eigenvalues such that \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\lambda\\\\leq\\\\alpha, the stable manifold with eigenvalues \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\lambda\\\\leq-\\\\beta<-r\\\\alpha, and unstable manifold with eigenvalues \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\lambda\\\\geq\\\\beta>r\\\\alpha. They proved existence of these manifolds, and the emergence of a center manifold, via nonlinear coordinate transforms. Potzsche and Rasmussen established a corresponding approximation theorem for such infinite dimensional, non-autonomous systems. =Alternative backwards theory= All the extant theory mentioned above seeks to establish invariant manifold properties of a specific given problem. In particular, one constructs a manifold that approximates an invariant manifold of the given system. An alternative approach is to construct exact invariant manifolds for a system that approximates the given system-called a backwards theory. The aim is to usefully apply theory to a wider range of systems, and to estimate errors and sizes of domain of validity. This approach is cognate to the well-established backward error analysis in numerical modeling. Center manifold and the analysis of nonlinear systems As the stability of the equilibrium correlates with the \\"stability\\" of its manifolds, the existence of a center manifold brings up the question about the dynamics on the center manifold. This is analyzed by the center manifold reduction, which, in combination with some system parameter Œº, leads to the concepts of bifurcations. Correspondingly, two web services currently undertake the necessary computer algebra to construct just the center manifold for a wide range of finite-dimensional systems (provided they are in multinomial form). * One web service constructs slow manifolds for systems which are linearly diagonalised, but which may be non-autonomous or stochastic. * Another web service constructs center manifolds for systems with general linearisation, but only for autonomous systems.  Examples  The Wikipedia entry on slow manifolds gives more examples. =A simple example= Consider the system : \\\\dot x=x^2,\\\\quad \\\\dot y=y. The unstable manifold at the origin is the y axis, and the stable manifold is the trivial set {(0, 0)}. Any orbit not on the stable manifold satisfies an equation of the form y=Ae^{-1/x} for some real constant A. It follows that for any real A, we can create a center manifold by piecing together the curve y=Ae^{-1/x} for x > 0 with the negative x axis (including the origin). Moreover, all center manifolds have this potential non-uniqueness, although often the non-uniqueness only occurs in unphysical complex values of the variables. =Delay differential equations often have Hopf bifurcations= Another example shows how a center manifold models the Hopf bifurcation that occurs for parameter a\\\\approx 4 in the delay differential equation {dx}/{dt}=-ax(t-1)-2x^2-x^3. Strictly, the delay makes this DE infinite-dimensional. Fortunately, we may approximate such delays by the following trick that keeps the dimensionality finite. Define u_1(t)=x(t) and approximate the time-delayed variable, x(t-1)\\\\approx u_3(t), by using the intermediaries {du_2}/{dt}=2(u_1-u_2) and {du_3}/{dt}=2(u_2-u_3). For parameter near critical, a=4+\\\\alpha, the delay differential equation is then approximated by the system : \\\\frac{d\\\\textbf{u}}{dt} =\\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{ccc} 0&0&-4\\\\\\\\\\\\ 2&-2&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&2&-2 \\\\end{array}\\\\right] \\\\textbf{u} + \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{c}-\\\\alpha u_3-2u_1^2-u_1^3\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\end{array}\\\\right]. Copying and pasting the appropriate entries, the web service finds that in terms of a complex amplitude s(t) and its complex conjugate \\\\bar s(t), the center manifold : \\\\textbf{u}=\\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{c} e^{i2t}s+e^{-i2t}\\\\bar s\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1-i}2e^{i2t}s +\\\\frac{1+i}2e^{-i2t}\\\\bar s\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\frac{i}2e^{i2t}s +\\\\frac{i}2e^{-i2t}\\\\bar s \\\\end{array}\\\\right] +{O}(\\\\alpha+s^2) and the evolution on the center manifold is : \\\\frac{ds}{dt}= \\\\left[ \\\\frac{1+2i}{10}\\\\alpha s -\\\\frac{3+16i}{15}s^2s \\\\right] +{ O}(\\\\alpha^2+s^4) This evolution shows the origin is linearly unstable for \\\\alpha>0\\\\ (a>4), but the cubic nonlinearity then stabilises nearby limit cycles as in classic Hopf bifurcation.

Plot introduction The story documents the emotional awakening of Norman Moonbloom, an isolated, apathetic man in his thirties who, having recently ended a career as 'perpetual student', is now reluctantly in the employ of his brother Irwin as a property agent. Irwin's tenants occupy a series of dilapidated apartments in some of the poorer areas of Manhattan, and Norman's life consists of attempting to collect their rent while constantly making them empty promises about much-needed repairs. At first, Moonbloom resolutely insulates himself against his troublesome tenants, with their incessant complaining and idiosyncratic ways. Little by little, however, his defenses begin crumbling as they talk to him, argue with him, and impart to him their secrets and hopes. These unaccustomed intimacies bring on a seismic shift in Norman's personality, eventually inspiring him to defy his brother (who wants the apartments left exactly as they are) by undertaking all the promised repairs himself. As he goes from apartment to apartment, painting, plastering, and further immersing himself in his tenants' lives, the meek little rent collector finally comes to life. Style and characters The book offers a plethora of wildly diverse characters, including: a gay black jazz musician who moonlights as a gigolo; an ancient German Jew who lives alone in an unspeakably filthy apartment, drinking the days away; a pair of childless sisters who dote on their orphaned nephew, conspiring together to keep him always a child; a blowsy former Shirley Temple wannabe who divests Norman of his virginity in exchange for a rent cut; and a prim Italian linguist afflicted by a terrifying swelling in his bathroom wall. Wallant deftly develops this gallery of characters, giving each of Moonbloom's tenants a distinct and complex personality. Wallant has an elegant, fluid writing style, and many consider The Tenants of Moonbloom to be an exemplary piece of prose (see below link).

Kemira's owners became active in 2002, when they set the goal of making Kemira the world's leading company in selected industries. During Lasse Kurkilahti's term as President and CEO (2004‚Äì2007), Kemira made more than 30 acquisitions and sold non-core components, such as properties where the head office or Oulu Research Center operated. Kemira acquired, among other things, the paper and pulp chemistry business. For example, in 2004 the fertilizer production Kemira Agro Oy was spun off into its own company, Kemira GrowHow. The Siilinj√§rvi mica factory was sold to Sweden. In 2017 Norwegian Yara bought GrowHow (now Yara Finland). The fine chemicals were incorporated into KemFine Oy, which was sold to the private equity firm 3i in 2004. In 2005, Kemira's net sales were approximately EUR 2 billion. The company acquired Finnish Chemicals 'mills in the spring and Lanxess' paper chemicals mills in Germany in December, making Kemira the world's largest producer of paper chemicals. Kemira was also the market leader in pulp chemicals. In August 2007, the Finnish state sold 32.1% of Kemira's shares to domestic investors for EUR 655.6 million, reducing its holding from 48.6% to 16.5%. Oras Invest bought 17.1% and pension insurance companies 14.97% of Kemira's shares. In 2008 Kemira decided to concentrate on water chemistry, and the following year, 75 percent of the company's revenue came from water chemicals, water treatment and other water technologies. Harri Kerminen's (2008‚Äì2012) President and CEO term was largely spent on the integration of acquisitions made by Kurkilahti and the reorganization of the organization. In September 2008, Kemira and Rockwood formed a joint venture that merged both Kemira's and Rockwood's titanium dioxide business and Rockwood's functional additives business. =2010‚Äì= Tikkurila, which manufactures paints and industrial coatings, was spun off from Kemira in March 2010, when it distributed the majority of Tikkurila's shares as a dividend to its own shareholders. Kemira had 14% of Tikkurila's share capital, which it sold in 2011. In April the Kokkola sulfuric acid plant was sold to Boliden, but Kemira continued its warehousing and loading operations. Wolfgang B√ºchele, who served as President and CEO from 2012 to 2014, focused Kemira's efforts on water-intensive industries. During his time, some twenty mills were also closed, including the Vaasa paper chemicals mill, which closed at the end of 2013. In the summer of 2013 Kemira acquired the Italian chemical company 3F Chimica. The transaction included production facilities in Italy and one production facility in the United States. 3F Chimica's products included dry polyacrylamide and emulsion polyacrylamide, as well as related process chemicals. In December 2013, Kemira announced that it would sell its entire formic acid business to Taminco in the United States. The deal included about 160 employees and a formic acid plant in Oulu, as well as feed preservation products and airport runway de-icers. In February 2014, Rockwood acquired Kemira's shareholding (39%) in the titanium dioxide joint venture Sachtleben GmbH. Rockwood's pigment business and at the same time the Pori titanium dioxide plant were acquired in the same year by the US Huntsman Corporation. In July of the same year, Kemira announced the acquisition of AkzoNobel's paper chemicals business, whose products were used, for example, to coat and strengthen paper and packaging board. Kemira sold parts of its ChemSolutions segment, which provided chemicals like formic acid and customer-driven solutions to the food, feed, pharmaceutical and chemical industries to Taminco. In March 2016, Kemira announced the construction of a new sodium chlorate production line and cell hall at its Joutseno plant. The value of the investment was around EUR 50-60 million. In 2017 Kemira merged its three segments Pulp & Paper, Municipal & Industrial and Oil & Mining into two segments Pulp & Paper and Industry & Water. In 2020 Kemira celebrated its 100th anniversary by donating 100,000 euros to the World Health Organization‚Äôs COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. Organization Kemira's headquartered is in Salmisaari, Helsinki and it has research centers in Espoo, Shanghai and Atlanta. Since 2017 Kemira have had two main segments, Pulp & Paper and Industry & Water Kemira aims to improve its customers‚Äô water, energy and raw material efficiency. =Management= Kemira's President and CEO is Jari Rosendal (since May 2014). Members of the Board of Directors as of May 5, 2020 were Chair Jari Paasikivi (Chairman), Kerttu Tuomas (Vice Chairman), and Wolfgang B√ºchele, Shirley Cunningham, Werner Fuhrmann, Kaisa Hietala and Timo Lappalainen. =Owners= Kemira‚Äôs main shareholder is Oras Invest Oy and its owners, members of the Paasikivi family. Its former main owner, the State of Finland, sold the largest part of its holding to Finnish investors in August 2007. In June 2020 the biggest owners were Oras Invest Oy (20.1 %), Solidium Oy (10.2 %) and Varma Mutual Pension Insurance Company (3.4 %). Markets Kemira aims to improve its customers‚Äô water, energy and raw material efficiency. Kemira is one of the largest companies in the water chemistry industry. In 2010, its competitors were Nalco, Ashland and GE Water in the United States and competitors in China, usually manufacturing the same chemical. In 2019, its largest competitors were Ecolab, Nouryon, SNF, Solenis and Solvay. Kemira's strengths are its wide range of water chemicals and its commitment to solving the customer's problems as a whole. Its customers operate in water-intensive industries: the pulp and paper industry, municipal and industrial water treatment, and the oil and gas industry. Kemira is therefore involved in the production of drinking water, the purification and reuse of industrial process water.

More precisely, a homoclinic orbit lies in the intersection of the stable manifold and the unstable manifold of an equilibrium. Consider the continuous dynamical system described by the ODE :\\\\dot x=f(x) Suppose there is an equilibrium at x=x_0, then a solution \\\\Phi(t) is a homoclinic orbit if :\\\\Phi(t)\\\\rightarrow x_0\\\\quad \\\\mathrm{as}\\\\quad t\\\\rightarrow\\\\pm\\\\infty If the phase space has three or more dimensions, then it is important to consider the topology of the unstable manifold of the saddle point. The figures show two cases. First, when the stable manifold is topologically a cylinder, and secondly, when the unstable manifold is topologically a M√∂bius strip; in this case the homoclinic orbit is called twisted.  Discrete dynamical system  Homoclinic orbits and homoclinic points are defined in the same way for iterated functions, as the intersection of the stable set and unstable set of some fixed point or periodic point of the system. We also have the notion of homoclinic orbit when considering discrete dynamical systems. In such a case, if f:M\\\\rightarrow M is a diffeomorphism of a manifold M, we say that x is a homoclinic point if it has the same past and future - more specifically, if there exists a fixed (or periodic) point p such that :\\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow \\\\pm\\\\infty}f^n(x)=p.  Properties  The existence of one homoclinic point implies the existence of an infinite number of them. This comes from its definition: the intersection of a stable and unstable set. Both sets are invariant by definition, which means that the forward iteration of the homoclinic point is both on the stable and unstable set. By iterating N times, the map approaches the equilibrium point by the stable set, but in every iteration it is on the unstable manifold too, which shows this property. This property suggests that complicated dynamics arise by the existence of a homoclinic point. Indeed, Smale (1967) showed that these points leads to horseshoe map like dynamics, which is associated with chaos.  Symbolic dynamics  By using the Markov partition, the long-time behaviour of a hyperbolic system can be studied using the techniques of symbolic dynamics. In this case, a homoclinic orbit has a particularly simple and clear representation. Suppose that S=\\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,M\\\\\\\\} is a finite set of M symbols. The dynamics of a point x is then represented by a bi-infinite string of symbols :\\\\sigma =\\\\\\\\{(\\\\ldots,s_{-1},s_0,s_1,\\\\ldots) : s_k \\\\in S \\\\; \\\\forall k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\\\\\} A periodic point of the system is simply a recurring sequence of letters. A heteroclinic orbit is then the joining of two distinct periodic orbits. It may be written as :p^\\\\omega s_1 s_2 \\\\cdots s_n q^\\\\omega where p= t_1 t_2 \\\\cdots t_k is a sequence of symbols of length k, (of course, t_i\\\\in S), and q = r_1 r_2 \\\\cdots r_m is another sequence of symbols, of length m (likewise, r_i\\\\in S). The notation p^\\\\omega simply denotes the repetition of p an infinite number of times. Thus, a heteroclinic orbit can be understood as the transition from one periodic orbit to another. By contrast, a homoclinic orbit can be written as :p^\\\\omega s_1 s_2 \\\\cdots s_n p^\\\\omega with the intermediate sequence s_1 s_2 \\\\cdots s_n being non-empty, and, of course, not being p, as otherwise, the orbit would simply be p^\\\\omega.

The highlighted curve shows the heteroclinic orbit from (x, x') = (‚àíœÄ, 0) to (x, x') = (œÄ, 0). This orbit corresponds with the (rigid) pendulum starting upright, making one revolution through its lowest position, and ending upright again. In mathematics, in the phase portrait of a dynamical system, a heteroclinic orbit (sometimes called a heteroclinic connection) is a path in phase space which joins two different equilibrium points. If the equilibrium points at the start and end of the orbit are the same, the orbit is a homoclinic orbit. Consider the continuous dynamical system described by the ODE ::\\\\dot x=f(x) Suppose there are equilibria at x=x_0 and x=x_1, then a solution \\\\phi(t) is a heteroclinic orbit from x_0 to x_1 if ::\\\\phi(t)\\\\rightarrow x_0\\\\quad \\\\mathrm{as}\\\\quad t\\\\rightarrow-\\\\infty and ::\\\\phi(t)\\\\rightarrow x_1\\\\quad \\\\mathrm{as}\\\\quad t\\\\rightarrow+\\\\infty This implies that the orbit is contained in the stable manifold of x_1 and the unstable manifold of x_0.

Sinagra was not actually a member of the Mafia but just a petty criminal, one of fourteen children to a fisherman from Palermo. In 1981 he made the mistake of robbing a member of the Mafia and although this would normally have meant instant death, because he had a cousin in the Mafia (see below) he was given a choice of leaving Sicily, being killed or becoming a gofer for the Mafia. He chose the third option. During the Mafia War of the early 1980s, Sinagra worked for Filippo Marchese, a ruthless killer who employed Sinagra for various menial tasks, like holding the feet of Marchese's victims whilst Marchese strangled them, and helping dispose of bodies. Sinagra used to take home $250 a month in his grisly job, waiting around on street corners for his next assignment. He was sent to carry out a contract killing on August 11, 1982, but he bungled it badly. His gun jammed and so his accomplice, his cousin, had to shoot the victim dead. Sinagra then left his weapon in the getaway car. He and his cousin were arrested later that day. In prison, Sinagra feigned insanity but eventually suffered something of a nervous breakdown, apparently wracked with guilt for taking part in many murders. He eventually became an informant and provided anti-Mafia judge Paolo Borsellino with a great deal of information. Borsellino had been after Marchese for years. Sinagra even led the police on a tour of his clan's torture chamber. There he showed them bloodstained ropes, brickbats and a vat in which bodies were dumped into acid. By the end of 1982, Marchese was dead, killed on the orders of Salvatore Riina who decided Marchese was of no further use. However, Sinagra did eventually testify at the Maxi Trial of 1986-1987, along with other informants like Tommaso Buscetta, and helped convict many Mafiosi. Despite his cooperation, at the conclusion of the Maxi Trial, Sinagra was handed a twenty-one-year sentence for his part in multiple murders. He was released in 2008. Vincenzo Sinagra was also the name of the above individual's cousin. This Vincenzo, who was a fully fledged member of the Mafia, was nicknamed \\"Tempest\\" due to his violent temper and strength. At the Maxi Trial, \\"Tempest'\\", partly on the testimony of his cousin, was convicted of murder and imprisoned for life.

It connects the Beenleigh and Ipswich lines for freight trains, but is no longer a passenger service. During times of disruption in the inner south of Brisbane, certain services could be maintained by running through this line. For example, if there was a disruption at South Brisbane, Gold Coast services could be maintained by travelling along the line via the Ipswich line to Corinda, then via this line to Yeerongpilly, and then south as per normal along the Beenleigh/Gold Coast line. The line is a major freight corridor, being the main connection between western Queensland freight lines, the Port of Brisbane and the marshalling yards at Moolabin, Clapham and Acacia Ridge. Passenger services on the line ceased in June 2011.

During his career, Oakland performed primarily on television, appearing in over 130 series and made-for-television movies between 1951 and 1983.\\"Simon Oakland\\", Internet Movie Database (IMDb). Retrieved April 27, 2017. His most notable big-screen roles were in Psycho (1960), West Side Story (1961), The Sand Pebbles (1966), Bullitt (1969), The Hunting Party (1971) and Chato's Land (1972). Early life and career Oakland was born in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, the eldest of the three sons of Jacob Weiss and Ethel Oaklander. His father was a plasterer and builder. While he later claimed in media interviews to have been born in 1922 (a date repeated in his New York Times obituary), Social Security and vital records indicate he was born Simon Weiss in 1915; his stage name was likely derived from his mother's maiden name, Oaklander. Duplicate entries under surname Weiss and Oakland with same Social Security number. He began his performing arts career as a musician (he was a violinist, an avocation he would pursue during his entire career as an actor). Oakland began his acting career in the late 1940s. He enjoyed a series of Broadway hits, including Light Up the Sky, The Shrike and Inherit the Wind, and theater was one of his lasting passions. He was a concert violinist until the 1940s. Moving to films and television In 1955 Oakland made his film debut, though uncredited, as an Indiana state trooper in The Desperate Hours. He next appeared in two films released in 1958: as the character Mavrayek in The Brothers Karamazov and then in the role of Edward Montgomery in I Want to Live!\\"Simon Oakland\\", IMDb. Retrieved April 27, 2017. The character Montgomery was a real-life journalist, who had reported on the California murder trial and 1955 execution of Barbara Graham, played by Susan Hayward in the film. Oakland's portrayal of the journalist as a \\"tough, but compassionate\\" personality resulted in the actor's often being typecast in his subsequent roles in both films and on television. Simon Oakland's notable performance in I Want to Live! led to his playing a long series of tough-guy types, usually in positions of authority, most notably in Psycho, in which he plays the psychiatrist who explains Norman Bates's multiple personality disorder. He also appeared in West Side Story, The Sand Pebbles, and Bullitt. He made two guest appearances on CBS's Perry Mason, both times as the murder victim. He also appeared in the syndicated crime drama, Decoy, starring Beverly Garland. Oakland appeared once each on the CBS western, Dundee and the Culhane and in another syndicated crime drama series, Sheriff of Cochise, starring John Bromfield. Oakland played the regular role of General Thomas Moore on NBC's Baa Baa Black Sheep, starring Robert Conrad. He also appeared in two episodes of the original The Twilight Zone TV series and in The Outer Limits as the alien birdman in \\"Second Chance\\". In 1974 and 1975, he was a series regular on Kolchak: The Night Stalker, playing newspaper editor Tony Vincenzo. (He'd previously played the same character in the two made-for-television movies that served as the pilot for the series.) Oakland was the familiar voice-over for the tag line \\"When It Absolutely, Positively Has To Be There Overnight\\" heard at the end of each television commercial for the long-running Federal Express advertising campaign, created by the New York advertising agency Ally & Gargano.

Either privately owned firearms or those rented from the shooting range may be used, depending on the range rules set by the owner. Some ranges rent their own handguns and provide instruction in use of rental guns at shooting ranges by a range master or similar individual to help one to easily learn use of any rental firearm in just a few minutes. Major tourist destinations in gun-friendly U.S. States have such \\"rental ranges\\" to cater to the domestic and international tourists that want to try their hand at the shooting sports. Each shooting range facility in the United States is typically overseen by one or more range masters to ensure gun safety rules are always stringently followed.  Specialized classes and licenses  Typically, no license or advanced training beyond just firearm familiarization (for rentals) and range rules familiarization is usually required for using a shooting range in the United States; the only common requirement is that the shooter must be at least 18 years old (or have a legal guardian present), and must sign a waiver prior to shooting. Self-defense classes may be available for a fee at shooting ranges, covering firearm use in much more detail. Some ranges offer a class for concealed carry licenses, which are available in almost every state. Some states issue the license only after a short course, and in some courses are optional.  Locations  Shooting range near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania In most states in the United States, there are numerous public-access shooting ranges, ranging for example from 144 in Florida with a population in excess of 18.2 million to 9 in Hawaii with a population of 1.3 million (numbers taken as of October 2008). Exceptions include cities in the states of Hawaii, California, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, and Washington, DC, all known for gun control policies in general, where the numbers of ranges may be only one for every few hundred thousand people, or none at all, such as in the Washington, DC case. Throughout much of the rest of the United States, though, especially in areas where the dominant side of the gun politics debate leans towards gun rights, and where no license is usually required to own a handgun or rifle or shotgun, the typical number of ranges often surpasses one for every 100,000 residents. Of particular interest to international tourists interested in public access shooting ranges in the United States while on vacation, especially gun- friendly states include Kentucky, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia, New Hampshire, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, and Utah, among others. All of these states have publicly accessible shooting ranges with rental guns available at a modest fee. Ammunition costs for rental guns varies, of course, but 9√ó19mm Luger (usually the cheapest service caliber round) is often available for around $15 per 50 at sporting goods stores or slightly higher ($18‚Äì25) at most public access shooting ranges. Private or restricted-access shooting ranges are owned and used by police departments, private companies, private membership shooting clubs, and the military for qualification and/or continued firearms practice and training. These private ranges have more- specialized features not seen in public ranges, e.g., large caliber rifle and automatic weapons ranges. There are several types of shooting ranges, each catering to different classes of firearms, and meeting different needs. Some are inside buildings; others are outdoors and cover many acres. =Outdoor ranges= * On a shotgun or trap range, the shooter aims to hit sporting clays or skeet that are mechanically-fired (or in some cases, thrown by hand) across an open field. These involve shooting clay disks also known as clay pigeons thrown in various ways. Both skeet and trap are Olympic sports (or, more precisely, are disciplines of an Olympic sport that are contested in the Summer Olympics), and are practiced by many bird hunters to sharpen their marksmanship. * On a rifle range, shooters typically fire at targets 100-300 yards (91‚Äì275 meters) or greater distance. Many rifle ranges feature mechanized steel targets that automatically reset upon being hit. Hunters in particular often use rifle ranges to calibrate or sight-in their rifles prior to hunting. * On a handgun range, shooters fire semi-automatic pistols, revolvers, and sometimes pistol-caliber carbines or submachine guns at stationary targets along, or at the end of, a 15-100 yard (13-91 meter) long lane. Most outdoor ranges have established strictly-followed procedures for ensuring that a range is either active (\\"hot\\") or inactive (\\"cold\\"). When everyone on the firing line agrees for the line to go hot, actions may be closed, magazines may be loaded, rounds may be chambered and firearms may be fired. When everyone on the firing line agrees for the line to go cold, magazines must be removed, firearms must be unloaded, actions opened, and all the firearms must be placed on tables. Only upon confirmation does the line actually go cold. Firearms may not be loaded or even touched when the line is cold. Outdoor shooting ranges are usually backed by a sandbagged barrier or specially-designed funnel-shaped traps to prevent bullets from ricocheting back at the shooters. Many older outdoor ranges only use an earthen berm, which is often composed of sand, and called the impact berm. Most outdoor ranges restrict the maximum caliber size, or have separate ranges devoted to use with rifles firing heavy caliber cartridges. Many outdoor ranges do permit the use of automatic weapons on specially adapted Class III weapons ranges. The largest problem currently with outdoor ranges is the lack of sufficient area behind and beside the impact berms. This area, usually called the Surface Danger Zone (SDZ), is a fan-shaped area that extends lengthwise to the ultimate ballistic distance of the round fired. Outdoor ranges often use baffles to contain fired rounds within the range, and, with proper design can reduce the surface danger zone area. Guidelines for surface danger zones vary widely. The National Rifle Association maintains guidelines for range design, but often the U.S. military range design guidelines are more prescriptive, specific and easier to use. Targets using Tannerite are sometimes used for indicating long-range markmanship accuracy at high power rifle and full-auto outdoor ranges. Tannerite is a binary explosive that is not exploded unless hit with high-velocity rounds. Most pistol rounds will not set it off. = Indoor ranges = An estimated 16,000 to 18,000 indoor firing ranges are in operation in the United States.Kardous, Chucri. Take Aim at Protecting Yourself: Solutions for Preventing Lead Poisoning and Hearing Loss at Indoor Firing Ranges. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. May 18, 2009. Indoor ranges differ in construction, depending on the type of weapons to be fired: * On a rifle range, shooters typically fire pistol caliber carbines at targets 100 yards (91 meters) distant. The common practice is to follow rules much like those required on outdoor ranges. * On a handgun range, shooters fire semi-automatic pistols, revolvers, and (sometimes) submachine guns at stationary targets along, or at the end of, a 15-100 yard (14-91 meter) long lane. Paper or cardboard targets are hung from a dummy or target holder positioned on a slide; this arrangement allows the shooter to control the shooting distance and retrieve targets for inspection. The target is typically hung from a replaceable hanger attached to a mechanized or motorized assembly that can be placed at varying distances from the shooter, by means of an electrical switch or manual pulley system. Common range shooting distances are 5 yards (4.5 meters) to 33 yards (23‚Äì30 meters). Most ranges have minimum shooter-to-target distances, set by the range master, determined by safety considerations. Fees for using indoor public shooting ranges vary widely with local costs, but a typical rate starts at $10 per hour of use, with targets available at a modest charge. Additional fees usually will pertain to damaging target hangers, lights or baffles, up to damaging motors, which may cost as much as $200, per incident. Unlike for outdoor ranges, or for indoor rifle ranges, indoor public handgun shooting ranges are usually run continuously \\"hot\\". The only exception is if a target falls from a holder and needs to be retrieved. In this rather rare scenario, some ranges will go \\"cold\\", after all firearms are placed on the firing line table with their actions open. Other ranges have a policy that no shooters may go forward of the firing line at any time, so the dropped target is considered lost and must be replaced. Indoor ranges usually have a projectile trap consisting of curved or angled steel plates, shredded rubber, or specially packed and groomed sand, with reinforced baffles attached to the ceiling and walls. The most modern ranges additionally include anechoic chamber technology (foam wedges), or place other sound absorbing materials on walls, floors and ceilings for additional noise reduction. Such ranges also usually have an air-locked corridor for soundproofing, with doors at opposite ends of the corridor. Noise from the range is effectively contained as long as only one door is opened at a time; it is considered a breach of etiquette to open both doors simultaneously. Ventilation is designed to be sufficient in quantity and directional control to reduce concentrations of lead in the air to safe levels in the shooting area. A small group of high volume indoor ranges are now using lead-free and frangible ammunition to create a safer and healthier shooting experience for consumers. The maximum caliber size is sometimes posted on the door of the airlock on each particular range, or in the lobby or ready area if the facility only contains one range. Most indoor ranges restrict the use of certain magnum calibers, or the use of automatic weapons, primarily to prevent damage to the facilities. Other ranges do not have a caliber restriction, but instead limit projectiles to a certain muzzle velocity, often 2000 feet per second, or bullet construction.  Common safety practices  Shooting ranges in the United States carry a significant risk for lead poisoning and are a public health concern. Nearly all public ranges require that all firearms be unloaded prior to entering, or leaving, the range facility, irrespective of whether one holds a concealed carry license. The same is true for rental firearms leaving or returning to the rental counter, going to and from the shooting range. Whether indoors or outdoors, all shooters are required to wear safety glasses or goggles, although some ranges will allow impact-resistant corrective glasses as the only eye protection. Ear protection is mandatory either ear muffs or ear plugs, as long as one is within the defined boundaries of the range and the range is hot. For indoor ranges, these must be donned before going through the air lock door, and kept on as long as individuals are within the high noise area. Indoor ranges can introduce the risk of lead poisoning if they are not ventilated or cleaned properly. Lead dust in these facilities can be inhaled or can contaminate skin and clothing. The instructions of the appointed range master are to be followed at all times. Holster drawing, cowboy action shooting and combat-style shooting are not generally allowed, except on specially designated action shooting ranges, which often have additional safety requirements and equipment. Regular public ranges that do allow such shooting usually restrict the practice to designated persons, such as Law Enforcement, professional shooters, or others designated by range personnel.  Cost of shooting  If one brings one's own firearms, ear and eye protection, it is often possible to buy a 50-round box of 9 mm ammunition and target, rent an indoor lane for an hour, and enjoy shooting for under $50 in the United States. Fees for outdoor ranges are often even less, often running $6.50 for 3 hours of range time. Along with a 500-round brick of .22 LR ammunition that often costs less than $60, it is possible on an outdoor range to enjoy an afternoon of shooting for under $70. Firearm rental fees vary, depending on the model and caliber, but for a typical, non-exotic handgun, costs are only modestly higher. Hearing and eye protection rental fees are modest, often available for under $3 each. Shooting ranges that cater to foreign tourists interested in shooting handguns may have special package deals for under $20 for instruction, assistance, and shooting. Larger caliber firearms and automatic weapons are available for tourists at some ranges as well. Fees for renting larger caliber firearms are only modestly more, but rental fees for automatic weapons can rise quickly, to hundreds of dollars, depending on the number of rounds fired. For those interested in more heavy use of the local shooting range, annual memberships are available at many indoor U.S. shooting ranges. Both individual and family memberships are often available. Typical costs vary but annual membership is usually available for around $200 per person, or slightly more for an entire family. Such plans typically have unlimited usage of the range, unlike the typical 1/2 hour or 1-, 2-, or 3-hour rental time slots when renting a shooting lane as an occasional shooter. For anyone shooting more than 8-10 times a year, annual membership is often cheaper than paying an hourly rate. For the more exotic outdoor sporting club private ranges, annual membership in the NRA is usually mandatory. It is worth noting that there are many unsupervised outdoor ranges on public land in the U.S. where shooting is free and unfettered.

Biography Heyman studied at the University of Michigan where he had an early start on his career writing college musicals. After graduating from college Heyman moved back to New York City where he started working with a number of experienced musicians like Victor Young (\\"When I Fall in Love\\"), Dana Suesse, (\\"You Oughta Be in Pictures\\") and Johnny Green (\\"Body and Soul,\\" \\"Out of Nowhere,\\" \\"I Cover the Waterfront,\\" and \\"Easy Come, Easy Go\\"). From 1935 to 1952, Heyman contributed songs to film scores including Sweet Surrender, That Girl From Paris, Curly Top, Kissing Bandit, Delightfully Dangerous and Northwest Outpost. Arguably Heyman's biggest hit is his lyric to \\"Body and Soul,\\" written in 1930, which was often recorded (notably in 1939 by Coleman Hawkins and by many others), which frequently crops up in films, most recently in 2002's Catch Me If You Can.

The idea was first proposed in the 1950s and 1960s by cybernetics and early computer pioneers. IA is sometimes contrasted with AI (artificial intelligence), that is, the project of building a human-like intelligence in the form of an autonomous technological system such as a computer or robot. AI has encountered many fundamental obstacles, practical as well as theoretical, which for IA seem moot, as it needs technology merely as an extra support for an autonomous intelligence that has already proven to function. Moreover, IA has a long history of success, since all forms of information technology, from the abacus to writing to the Internet, have been developed basically to extend the information processing capabilities of the human mind (see extended mind and distributed cognition). Major contributions=William Ross Ashby: Intelligence Amplification= The term intelligence amplification (IA) has enjoyed a wide currency since William Ross Ashby wrote of \\"amplifying intelligence\\" in his Introduction to Cybernetics (1956). Related ideas were explicitly proposed as an alternative to Artificial Intelligence by Hao Wang from the early days of automatic theorem provers. =J. C. R. Licklider: Man- Computer Symbiosis= \\"Man-Computer Symbiosis\\" is a key speculative paper published in 1960 by psychologist/computer scientist J.C.R. Licklider, which envisions that mutually-interdependent, \\"living together\\", tightly-coupled human brains and computing machines would prove to complement each other's strengths to a high degree: In Licklider's vision, many of the pure artificial intelligence systems envisioned at the time by over-optimistic researchers would prove unnecessary. (This paper is also seen by some historians as marking the genesis of ideas about computer networks which later blossomed into the Internet). =Douglas Engelbart: Augmenting Human Intellect= Licklider's research was similar in spirit to his DARPA contemporary and prot√©g√© Douglas Engelbart. Both had a view of how computers could be used that was both at odds with the then-prevalent views (which saw them as devices principally useful for computations), and key proponents of the way in which computers are now used (as generic adjuncts to humans). Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work. Engelbart's philosophy and research agenda is most clearly and directly expressed in the 1962 research report: Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework\\"Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework\\" (October 1962), DougEngelbart.org. The concept of network augmented intelligence is attributed to Engelbart based on this pioneering work. Engelbart subsequently implemented these concepts in his Augmented Human Intellect Research Center at SRI International, developing essentially an intelligence amplifying system of tools (NLS) and co-evolving organizational methods, in full operational use by the mid-1960s within the lab. As intended,\\"Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework\\" , Section D: Regenerative Feature, in D. C. Engelbart Summary Report AFOSR-3233, Stanford Research Institute, Menlo Park, CA, October 1962. his R&D; team experienced increasing degrees of intelligence amplification, as both rigorous users and rapid-prototype developers of the system. For a sampling of research results, see their 1968 Mother of All Demos. Later contributions Howard Rheingold worked at Xerox PARC in the 1980s and was introduced to both Bob Taylor and Douglas Engelbart; Rheingold wrote about \\"mind amplifiers\\" in his 1985 book, Tools for Thought. See also Rheingold's site: Arnav Kapur working at MIT wrote about human-AI coalescence: how AI can be integrated into human condition as part of \\"human self\\": as a tertiary layer to the human brain to augment human cognition. He demonstrates this using a peripheral nerve- computer interface, AlterEgo, which enables a human user to silently and internally converse with a personal AI. Shan Carter and Michael Nielsen introduce the concept of artificial intelligence augmentation (AIA): the use of AI systems to help develop new methods for intelligence augmentation. They contrast cognitive outsourcing (AI as an oracle, able to solve some large class of problems with better-than-human performance) with cognitive transformation (changing the operations and representations we use to think). A calculator is an example of the former; a spreadsheet of the latter. In science fiction Augmented intelligence has been a repeating theme in science fiction. A positive view of brain implants used to communicate with a computer as a form of augmented intelligence is seen in Algis Budrys 1976 novel Michaelmas. Fear that the technology will be misused by the government and military is an early theme. In the 1981 BBC serial The Nightmare Man the pilot of a high-tech mini submarine is linked to his craft via a brain implant but becomes a savage killer after ripping out the implant. Perhaps the most well known writer exploring themes of intelligence augmentation is William Gibson, in work such as his 1981 story \\"Johnny Mnemonic\\", in which the title character has computer-augmented memory, and his 1984 novel Neuromancer, in which computer hackers interface through brain-computer interfaces to computer systems. Vernor Vinge, as discussed earlier, looked at intelligence augmentation as a possible route to the technological singularity, a theme which also appears in his fiction.

Description The Banded sea urchin has a slightly oval test (shell), reaching a diameter of about 5 cm. Like almost all the Diadematidae (but it is in Echinothrix calamaris that it is most obvious) it has two different sets of spines, shorter and slender closed spines which are going from yellow to dark (through brown) in colour and can deliver a nasty sting, and longer and thicker spines that are often banded with light and dark colour (but sometimes all dark or all white), and reaching 10 to 15 cm in length. These radiolas can be blunt, and are hollow. The spines are grouped so as to let appear five naked zones on the central part of the test, in a star pattern (called \\"iridophores\\"): this pattern can be colored, often in blue. The anal papilla is big, more or less translucent and very obvious on the aborale face; it is generally whitish and speckled with black and white dots, circled by a ring of visual receptors that grant it a rudimentary vision. File:Double-spined sea urchin.jpgThe most common form File:43-EastTimor-Dive Tasi-Tolu 03 (Sea urchin)-APiazza.JPGThe two types of spines are very different File:Echinothrix calamaris1.jpgThe 5-fold symmetry and blue iridophores are obvious on this picture File:Echinothrix calamaris.JPGSpecimen with white primary spines. File:SeaDSC01286.JPGDarker form In his darkest forms, it can be confused with its cousins Diadema setosum or Diadema savignyi (which can both keep banded radiola when adults) ; however the latter is bigger, more uniformly black, has less discernible secondary radioles and is recognizable in five characteristic white points at the top of its test as well as in orange-colored circle around its anus. The most common confusion is with the very close species Echinothrix diadema, which can have banded spines when yound. But E. diadema has a very small anal papilla, all black, and the spines have a blue sheen ; the primary radiolas of E. calamaris are more fragile too, and can be crushed between two fingers (they are hollow), what is not the case for E. diadema. =Dark form= Dark E. calamaris at R√©union island A dark form of this sea urchin is reported in Indian Ocean (Red Sea, Mascarene Islands, Seychelles, the Maldive Islands), with very dark radioles, often not banded, presenting generally a green sheen, and more or less reddish test (sometimes completely red, especially in the Red Sea). The anal papilla is black, more or less punctuated with white, but sometimes punctuated only with black which makes the distinction with Echinothrix diadema particularly difficult, as well as the absence of iridophores. The spines are also sharper and more solid, and cannot be crushed between two fingers. This could be a subspecies or even a separate species, especially as their ecological niche seems slightly diff√©rente. File:Dark Echinothrix Lighthouse Dahab.jpgDark-red specimen in Red Sea. File:Red Echinothrix.jpgAll red form in Egypt. Distribution and habitat The Banded sea urchin is widespread throughout the tropical waters of the Indo- Pacific region, from eastern coast of Africa to French Polynesia, including Hawaii and the Red Sea.Encyclopedia of Life It occurs from the surface to depth and can be found in lagoons, external reef slopes and channels. Behavior This sea urchin is active at night, hiding in crevices or under rocks during the day. The thinner spines are venomous (but nor dangerous). Miscellaneous notes Many juvenile fish of the family Apogonidae (cardinal fish) may hide in the spines for protection. In Hawaii, E. calamaris is often host to a symbiotic crab, Echinoecus pentagonus.

Through first-person narration, it chronicles the life of high school senior Keir Sarafian. A sequel, Irreversible, was published on September 6, 2016.  Plot summary  The novel begins with Keir arguing with Gigi about the events which occurred the night before. It continues with Keir's first-person narration of his senior year in high school. Keir is crushed when he learns that Gigi has accused him of date rape. He goes on to tell Gigi that he loves her, and would never do such a thing. One of Keir's main problems is his home life. His father treats him more like a friend than a son. The big question throughout the novel is this: \\"Could a self-proclaimed 'good guy' be capable of such a heinous act?\\" Keir goes over the events of his senior year that led to this night, and how this could have happened. The novel never mentions Gigi's point of view, so her feelings and thoughts are not taken into consideration through the use of dialogue. As the novel unfolds, Keir becomes more unpopular because of his substance abuse, school behavior, and his infamous tackle on the football field giving him the nickname \\"Killer.\\" Keir's self-image dissipates after he accidentally paralyzes an opponent, participates in bullying classmates, and then tries cocaine. First, he leans on Gigi because she listens to him and doesn't judge him. Once he learns about Gigi and her new boyfriend, he is angry and leans on his two sisters, Fran and Mary. Keir's older sisters have mixed feelings about his behavior. He leans on Fran the most because she sees the \\"good\\" in Keir despite his terrible actions. One night close to graduation, after a night of partying and substance abuse, Gigi decides to accompany Keir on a visit to Fran's college and they end up in her dorm room alone. In addition to all of this, Gigi tells Keir that her boyfriend could not go to the dance and she needed him to come with her to the dance. When they were both in that cabin there were two beds and when Keir saw how beautiful Gigi looked he went to her bed and something inexcusable happened. Then, the setting reverts to the opening with the two arguing about what happened while they were sleeping next to each other.  Characters  * Keir Sarafian: Keir is the 16-year-old protagonist of the novel.

Rings may vary in size from three to many atoms, and include examples where all the atoms are carbon (i.e., are carbocycles), none of the atoms are carbon (inorganic cyclic compounds), or where both carbon and non- carbon atoms are present (heterocyclic compounds). Depending on the ring size, the bond order of the individual links between ring atoms, and their arrangements within the rings, carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds may be aromatic or non-aromatic, in the latter case, they may vary from being fully saturated to having varying numbers of multiple bonds between the ring atoms. Because of the tremendous diversity allowed, in combination, by the valences of common atoms and their ability to form rings, the number of possible cyclic structures, even of small size (e.g., <17 total atoms) numbers in the many billions. Image: Ingenol.svg Ingenol, a complex, terpenoid natural product, related to but simpler than the paclitaxel that follows, which displays a complex ring structure including 3-, 5-, and 7-membered non-aromatic, carbocyclic rings. Image:First_four_cycloalkanes.png  Cycloalkanes, the simplest carbocycles, including cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, and cyclohexane. Note, elsewhere an organic chemistry shorthand is used where hydrogen atoms are inferred as present to fill the carbon's valence of 4 (rather than their being shown explicitly). Image:Taxol.svg  Paclitaxel, another complex, plant-derived terpenoid, also a natural product, displaying a complex multi-ring structure including 4-, 6-, and 8-membered rings (carbocyclic and heterocyclic, aromatic and non-aromatic). Adding to their complexity and number, closing of atoms into rings may lock particular atoms with distinct substitution (by functional groups) such that stereochemistry and chirality of the compound results, including some manifestations that are unique to rings (e.g., configurational isomers). As well, depending on ring size, the three-dimensional shapes of particular cyclic structures‚Äîtypically rings of 5-atoms and larger‚Äîcan vary and interconvert such that conformational isomerism is displayed. Indeed, the development of this important chemical concept arose, historically, in reference to cyclic compounds. Finally, cyclic compounds, because of the unique shapes, reactivities, properties, and bioactivities that they engender, are the largest majority of all molecules involved in the biochemistry, structure, and function of living organisms, and in the man-made molecules (e.g., drugs, herbicides, etc.). Structural introduction A cyclic compound or ring compound is a compound at least some of whose atoms are connected to form a ring.. Rings vary in size from 3 to many tens or even hundreds of atoms. Examples of ring compounds readily include cases where: * all the atoms are carbon (i.e., are carbocycles), * none of the atoms are carbon (inorganic cyclic compounds), or where * both carbon and non-carbon atoms are present (heterocyclic compounds). Common atoms can (as a result of their valences) form varying numbers of bonds, and many common atoms readily form rings. In addition, depending on the ring size, the bond order of the individual links between ring atoms, and their arrangements within the rings, cyclic compounds may be aromatic or non-aromatic; in the case of non-aromatic cyclic compounds, they may vary from being fully saturated to having varying numbers of multiple bonds. As a consequence of the constitutional variability that is thermodynamically possible in cyclic structures, the number of possible cyclic structures, even of small size (e.g., <17 atoms) numbers in the many billions. Moreover, the closing of atoms into rings may lock particular functional group‚Äìsubstituted atoms into place, resulting in stereochemistry and chirality being associated with the compound, including some manifestations that are unique to rings (e.g., configurational isomers);William Reusch, 2010, \\"Stereoisomers Part I,\\" In Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry, Michigan State University, see , accessed 7 April 2015. As well, depending on ring size, the three-dimensional shapes of particular cyclic structures‚Äîtypically rings of 5-atoms and larger‚Äîcan vary and interconvert such that conformational isomerism is displayed. Nomenclature IUPAC nomenclature has extensive rules to cover the naming of cyclic structures, both as core structures, and as substituents appended to alicyclic structures. The term macrocycle is used when a ring-containing compound has a ring of 8 or more atoms.J. D. Dunitz. Perspectives in Structural Chemistry (Edited by J. D. Dunitz and J. A. Ibers), Vol. 2, pp. l-70; Wiley, New York (1968) The term polycyclic is used when more than one ring appears in a single molecule. Naphthalene is formally a polycyclic compound, but is more specifically named as a bicyclic compound. Several examples of macrocyclic and polycyclic structures are given in the final gallery below. The atoms that are part of the ring structure are called annular atoms. Carbocycles The vast majority of cyclic compounds are organic, and of these, a significant and conceptually important portion are composed of rings made only of carbon atoms (i.e., they are carbocycles). Inorganic cyclic compounds Inorganic atoms form cyclic compounds as well. Examples include sulfur, silicon (e.g., in silanes), phosphorus (e.g., in phosphanes and phosphoric acid variants), and boron (e.g., in triboric acid). When carbon in benzene is \\"replaced\\" by other elements, e.g., as in borabenzene, silabenzene, germanabenzene, stannabenzene, and phosphorine, aromaticity is retained, and so aromatic inorganic cyclic compounds are known and well-characterized. Heterocyclic compounds Cyclic compounds that have both carbon and non-carbon atoms present are termed (heterocyclic compounds); alternatively the name can refer to inorganic cyclic compounds, such as siloxanes and borazines, that have more than one type of atom in their rings. Hantzsch‚ÄìWidman nomenclature is recommended by the IUPAC for naming heterocycles, but many common names remain in regular use. Aromaticity Cyclic compounds may or may not exhibit aromaticity; benzene is an example of an aromatic cyclic compound, while cyclohexane is non- aromatic. In organic chemistry, the term aromaticity is used to describe a cyclic (ring-shaped), planar (flat) molecule that exhibits unusual stability as compared to other geometric or connective arrangements of the same set of atoms. As a result of their stability, it is very difficult to cause aromatic molecules to break apart and to react with other substances. Organic compounds that are not aromatic are classified as aliphatic compounds‚Äîthey might be cyclic, but only aromatic rings have especial stability (low reactivity). Since one of the most commonly encountered aromatic systems of compounds in organic chemistry is based on derivatives of the prototypical aromatic compound benzene (an aromatic hydrocarbon common in petroleum and its distillates), the word ‚Äúaromatic‚Äù is occasionally used to refer informally to benzene derivatives, and this is how it was first defined. Nevertheless, many non-benzene aromatic compounds exist. In living organisms, for example, the most common aromatic rings are the double-ringed bases in RNA and DNA. A functional group or other substituent that is aromatic is called an aryl group. The earliest use of the term ‚Äúaromatic‚Äù was in an article by August Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855.[1] Hofmann used the term for a class of benzene compounds, many of which do have odors (aromas), unlike pure saturated hydrocarbons. Today, there is no general relationship between aromaticity as a chemical property and the olfactory properties of such compounds (how they smell), although in 1855, before the structure of benzene or organic compounds was understood, chemists like Hofmann were beginning to understand that odiferous molecules from plants, such as terpenes, had chemical properties we recognize today are similar to unsaturated petroleum hydrocarbons like benzene. In terms of the electronic nature of the molecule, aromaticity describes a conjugated system often made of alternating single and double bonds in a ring. This configuration allows for the electrons in the molecule‚Äôs pi system to be delocalized around the ring, increasing the molecule's stability. The molecule cannot be represented by one structure, but rather a resonance hybrid of different structures, such as with the two resonance structures of benzene. These molecules cannot be found in either one of these representations, with the longer single bonds in one location and the shorter double bond in another (See Theory below). Rather, the molecule exhibits bond lengths in between those of single and double bonds. This commonly seen model of aromatic rings, namely the idea that benzene was formed from a six-membered carbon ring with alternating single and double bonds (cyclohexatriene), was developed by August Kekul√© (see History section below). The model for benzene consists of two resonance forms, which corresponds to the double and single bonds superimposing to produce six one-and-a-half bonds. Benzene is a more stable molecule than would be expected without accounting for charge delocalization. Simple, mono-cyclic examples The following are examples of simple and aromatic carbocycles, inorganic cyclic compounds, and heterocycles: Image:Cycloheptane.png  Cycloheptane, a simple 7-membered carbocyclic compound, methylene hydrogens shown (non-aromatic). Image:Benz4.png  Benzene, a 6-membered carbocyclic compound. methine hydrogens shown, and 6 electrons shown as delocalized through drawing of circle (aromatic). Image:Cyclooctasulfur_structural_formula_3D.svg  Cyclo-octasulfur, an 8-membered inorganic cyclic compound (non-aromatic). Image:Pentazole.png  Pentazole, a 5-membered inorganic cyclic compound (aromatic). Image:Azetidine structure.svg Azetidine, a 4-membered nitrogen (aza) hetero-cyclic compound, methylene hydrogen atoms implied, not shown (non-aromatic). Image:Pyridine.svgPyridine, a 6 membered heterocyclic compound, methine hydrogen atoms implied, not shown, and delocalized œÄ-electrons shown as discrete bonds (aromatic). Stereochemistry The closing of atoms into rings may lock particular atoms with distinct substitution by functional groups such that the result is stereochemistry and chirality of the compound, including some manifestations that are unique to rings (e.g., configurational isomers). Conformational isomerism Depending on ring size, the three- dimensional shapes of particular cyclic structures‚Äîtypically rings of 5-atoms and larger‚Äîcan vary and interconvert such that conformational isomerism is displayed. Indeed, the development of this important chemical concept arose, historically, in reference to cyclic compounds. For instance, cyclohexanes‚Äîsix membered carbocycles with no double bonds, to which various substituents might be attached, see image‚Äîdisplay an equilibrium between two conformations, the chair and the boat, as shown in the image. The chair conformation is the favored configuration, because in this conformation, the steric strain, eclipsing strain, and angle strain that are otherwise possible are minimized. Which of the possible chair conformations predominate in cyclohexanes bearing one or more substituents depends on the substiuents, and where they are located on the ring; generally, \\"bulky\\" substituents‚Äîthose groups with large volumes, or groups that are otherwise repulsive in their interactions‚Äîprefer to occupy an equatorial location. An example of interactions within a molecule that would lead to steric strain, leading to a shift in equilibrium from boat to chair, is the interaction between the two methyl groups in cis-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane. In this molecule, the two methyl groups are in opposing positions of the ring (1,4-), and their cis stereochemistry projects both of these groups toward the same side of the ring. Hence, if forced into the higher energy boat form, these methyl groups are in steric contact, repel one another, and drive the equilibrium toward the chair conformation. Macrocycles 240px The term macrocycle is used for compounds having a rings of 8 or more atoms. Macrocycles may be fully carbocyclic, heterocyclic but having limited heteroatoms (e.g., in lactones and lactams), or be rich in heteroatoms and displaying significant symmetry (e.g., in the case of chelating macrocycles). Macrocycles can access a number of stable conformations, with preference to reside in conformations that minimize transannular nonbonded interactions within the ring (e.g., with the chair and chair-boat being more stable than the boat-boat conformation for cyclooctane, because of the interactions depicted by the arcs shown). Medium rings (8-11 atoms) are the most strained, with between 9-13 (kcal/mol) strain energy, and analysis of factors important in the conformations of larger macrocycles can be modeled using medium ring conformations.Eliel, E.L., Wilen, S.H. and Mander, L.S. (1994) Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York. Conformational analysis of odd-membered rings suggests they tend to reside in less symmetrical forms with smaller energy differences between stable conformations. Chelating macrocyclic structures of interest in inorganic and supramolecular chemistry, an example array. A, the crown ether, 18-crown-6; B, the simple tetra-aza chelator, cyclam; C, an example porphyrin, the unsubstituted porphine; D, a mixed amine/imine, the Curtis macrocycle; E, the related enamine/imine J√§ger macrocycle, and F, the tetracarboxylate- derivative DOTA macrocycle. Principle uses of cyclic structures Because of the unique shapes, reactivities, properties, and bioactivities that they engender, cyclic compounds are the largest majority of all molecules involved in the biochemistry, structure, and function of living organisms, and in the man-made molecules (e.g., drugs, herbicides, etc.) through which man attempts to exert control over nature and biological systems. Complex and polycyclic examples The following are examples of cyclic compounds exhibiting more complex ring systems and stereochemical features: Image:Naphtalene- diagram.png  Naphthalene, technically a polycyclic, more specifically a bicyclic compound, with circles showing delocalization of œÄ-electrons (aromatic). Image:Cis-trans isomerism of decahydronaphthalene.svg  Decalin (decahydronaphthalene), the fully saturated derivative of naphthalene, showing the two stereochemistries possible for \\"fusing\\" the two rings together, and how this impacts the shapes available to this bicyclic compound (non- aromatic).

Image:TaxolNumberingScheme.svg  Paclitaxel, a polycyclic natural product with a tricyclic core: with a heterocyclic, 4-membered D ring, fused to further 6- and 8-membered carbocyclic (A/C and B) rings (non-aromatic), and with three further pendant phenyl-rings on its \\"tail\\", and attached to C-2 (abbrev. Ph, C6H5; aromatics). Image:Paclitaxel_JMolBiol_2001_1045.jpg  A representative three-dimensional shape adopted by paclitaxel, as a result of its unique cyclic structure.

The R group at right refers to one of several possible four-carbon side chains (see main Brevetoxin article; non-aromatic). Synthetic reactions altering rings=Important general reactions for forming rings= Dieckmann ring-closing reaction There are a variety of specialized reactions whose use is solely the formation of rings, and these will be discussed below. In addition to those, there are a wide variety of general organic reactions that historically have been crucial in the development, first, of understanding the concepts of ring chemistry, and second, of reliable procedures for preparing ring structures in high yield, and with defined orientation of ring substituents (i.e., defined stereochemistry). These general reactions include: * Acyloin condensation; * Anodic oxidations; and * the Dieckmann condensation as applied to ring formation. = Ring-closing reactions= In organic chemistry, a variety of synthetic procures are particularly useful in closing carbocyclic and other rings; these are termed ring-closing reactions. Examples include: * alkyne trimerisation; * the Bergman cyclization; * the Diels-Alder and other cycloaddition reactions; * the Nazarov cyclization reaction; * various radical cyclizations; * ring-closing metathesis reactions, which also can be used to accomplish a specific type of polymerization; * the Ruzicka large ring synthesis; and * the Wenker synthesis of aziridines. =Ring-opening reactions = A variety of further synthetic procedures are particularly useful in opening carbocyclic and other rings, generally which contain a double bound or other functional group \\"handle\\" to facilitate chemistry; these are termed ring-opening reactions. Examples include: * ring opening metathesis, which can also be used to accomplish a specific type of polymerization. =Ring expansion and ring contraction reactions=See also *Effective molarity *Heterocyclic compound *Lactone *Macrocycle *Open-chain compound  References Further reading * J√ºrgen-Hinrich Fuhrhop & Gustav Penzlin, 1986, \\"Organic synthesis: concepts, methods, starting materials,\\" Weinheim, BW, DEU:VCH, , see , accessed 19 June 2015. * Michael B.

The logo is a pink coloured crown within a circle. In the Dutch language, the term \\"geen stijl\\" (literal translation: without style) is used to describe an act by a person or organisation that lacks style or manners. GeenStijl often uses a provocative tone when referring to other Internet sites and blogs. Commenters on the site are called reaguurders which is a portmanteau of the Dutch verb reageren (meaning reacting/commenting) and the adjective guur (meaning cold/unfriendly). Famously, in March 2005 GeenStijl launched a plan to unseat the second Balkenende cabinet. GeenStijl announced on their website that they would bus people from all over the country to Rotterdam, where one of the cabinet parties was holding a convention. These people could sign up as new party members at the convention, and vote against the party's participation in the cabinet. This hoax created a media uproar; even the NOS Journaal of the public television reported the event. At the height of their existence, the blog attracted around 75,000 visitors each day and was one of the top 10 news sites of the Netherlands. This popularity has receded somewhat currently, with Geenstijl being ranked as the 60th most visited website in the Netherlands, with an approximate global position of 12.000. In comparison, the website of the Dutch state-sponsored news network NOS ranks at about global position 5000 and is the 29th most visited website in the Netherlands, both as of 2 September 2020. The most visited Dutch news website is Nu.nl as of same date according to Alexa.com, at position 25.https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/NL On 17 March 2006 the Telegraaf Media Group took a 40% interest in GeenStijl. The editorial team of Dominique Weesie and Ambroos Wiegers both owned 50% of the shares, against 30% after the takeover. The deal was claimed to be worth ‚Ç¨2.6 million. This turned out not to be such a good deal, so they sold their interest pretty quickly, retaining ownership of the site Dumpert. Other sister sites, like autobahmn and glamorama were killed off due to lack of visitors. Dominique Weesie said that he saw a market for a tough-talking, politically incorrect blog, when he started GeenStijl in 2003, because existing blogs used language that was too vulgar for the mainstream media. One feature of the blog is the use of intentionally misspelt four-letter words to reduce their shock effect. The site has been criticized for the xenophobic and extreme nature of the comments it allows readers to post. Both the editors and the readers of GeenStijl have invented a wide range of names to refer to immigrants to the Netherlands that are generally considered to be stereotypic and derisive. They also use insulting words for right-wing people they believe to go over the mark though and in recent years inappropriate reader comments are jorissed away (as they call censoring of posts by their mods, the most well known used the nickname \\"Joris the Lognazi\\"). Previous logo of GeenStijl In combination with Weesie's network, who had been a reporter for the major Dutch newspaper de Telegraaf for more than 10 years, this has proven a successful formula. Geenstijl soon followed up with web videos featuring Rutger Castricum as star reporter. In May 2006, internet service providers in Bonaire began boycotting GeenStijl after the blog had published secret and private documents of Bonairean public prosecutor Ernst Wesselius. GeenStijl claims it obtained the documents via the P2P software LimeWire, although investigators did not find this software on Wesselius's computer (but since LimeWire runs on the more general Gnutella P2P network, he may have had any other software application that connects to Gnutella as well). The ISPs stated that \\"this is a one time action, because the publication has infringed our sense of ethics\\". Access to the site from Bonaire has since been restored. GeenStijl started working on the television program SteenGeyl with public broadcaster BNN, in 2007. GeenStijl founder Weesie stated they were to spend \\"taxpayer's money.\\" However, a dispute arose over the timeslot in which the program was to be broadcast, and production was halted. Two years later they started a successful campaign to get their own public broadcasting organisation under the name PowNed, which began broadcasting on Dutch public television in September 2010. In May 2017 more than 100 female journalists, female politicians, actresses and other women called for an advertisement boycott of GeenStijl. The stated reason was because of the sex fantasies, some violent, that appeared on numerous occasions in the comments section. GeenPeil In 2015 GeenStijl launched GeenPeil, a group which successfully campaigned to organise a referendum on the EU-Association Treaty with Ukraine.

Set in Milan, it tells the story of a migrant family from the South and its disintegration in the society of the industrial North. The title is a combination of Thomas Mann's Joseph and His Brothers and the name of Rocco Scotellaro, an Italian poet who described the feelings of the peasants of southern Italy.Henry Bacon, Visconti: Explorations of Beauty and Decay, Cambridge University Press, 1998, p.105 The film stars Alain Delon, Renato Salvatori, Annie Girardot, and Claudia Cardinale in one of her early roles before she became internationally known. The score was composed by Nino Rota. Plot After the death of his father, Rocco Parondi (Alain Delon), one of the five sons of a poor rural Italian family, travels north from Lucania to join his older brother Vincenzo in Milan, led by the matriarch Rosaria (Katina Paxinou). She is the \\"hand to which the five fingers belong,\\" as she states in the film, and she has a powerful influence on her sons. Presented in five distinct sections, the film weaves the story of the five brothers Vincenzo, Simone, Rocco, Ciro and Luca Parondi as each of them adapts to his new life in the city. Vincenzo, the eldest brother, is already living in Milan when his mother and brothers come to join him expecting to move in with him. An initial scene ensues between the Parondi family and Vincenzo's fianc√©e Ginetta's family, and the whole Parondi family moves in together. Despite early friction between Rosaria and Ginetta, he soon gets married and starts a family of his own. After settling down, Vincenzo doesn't interact much with the Parondi brothers. Simone, the second brother, struggles to adapt to urban life. He becomes attracted to a prostitute named Nadia (Annie Girardot), who urges him to pursue a career in boxing, which his mother also encourages, as a fast way to reach fame and wealth. After initially pursuing Vincenzo only to find him happy in his new family life, Nadia turns her interest to Simone. Simone falls in love with Nadia and demands for more than a casual relationship, but she rejects him. Rocco, the third brother, leaves to complete military service in Turin and meets Nadia, who has just been released from jail for prostitution charges. His innocence and purity of heart ignites her to give up her way of life and enter an exclusive relationship with him. When Simone learns of this, he attacks Nadia and Rocco with a gang of friends and rapes Nadia to \\"teach Rocco a lesson\\". Rocco subsequently sacrifices his relationship with Nadia, telling her that he did not realize how much their relationship hurt his brother. Rocco insists that Nadia return to Simone, and she reluctantly complies. Ciro, the second-youngest brother, perhaps by observing the trials of Simone and Rocco, decides to learn from their mistakes and mimic his brother Vincenzo. To that end, Ciro becomes engaged to a local woman from a good family and finds steady work in Milan at an automobile factory. Unlike Vincenzo, Ciro still lives with his mother and participates in family matters. Somewhat in the manner of Dostoyevsky's Prince Myshkin character, Rocco often acts to preserve the well-being of family members at some cost to his own happiness. He continues a boxing career he does not enjoy to provide for his family and covers for Simone in a myriad of ways, such as recovering an expensive brooch that Simone stole from Rocco's boss and agreeing to sign a long term boxing contract in order to pay back money that Simone has stolen. Ultimately, Simone loses the ability to compete as a boxer because of his obsession with Nadia, his alcoholism, and dissolute lifestyle. While Rocco fights and wins a championship bout, Simone kills Nadia in a jealous rage when she returns to prostitution and refuses to return to him. As the family celebrates Rocco's victory, he shares an anecdote about stonemasons, who, at the start of any building project, throw a stone into the shadow of a passerby in order to symbolize the sacrifice that is needed to erect a structure. Rocco's own habit of sacrificing his money and well-being can be likewise analogized as attempts to preserve his family after their upheaval from country life. Simone arrives at the apartment and confesses to Nadia's murder. Despite his anguish, Rocco tries to protect Simone, but Ciro refuses to go along and turns Simone in to the police. The youngest brother, Luca, does little but watch quietly in the background most of the time. Despite the fact that Luca had spent the least time in Southern Italy when the family moved to Milan, by the end of the film he wants to return with Rocco to the south. In one of the last scenes, Ciro speaks to Luca outside his factory and tells him that he won't find the south the same if he returns, and that while many people fear a changing world, he himself does not and he believes that Luca will benefit from the changes.

This was due to an \\"inopportune resemblance to reality\\" of the scene to be shot to the recent murder of a young prostitute in the area. The film was later seized by police officers and lawyers after Cardinal Tardini's request that officials take action against \\"certain destructive films\\". They demanded that four scenes be cut or the film would be confiscated and the producer prosecuted; however, after negotiations, Lombardo agreed to darken the critical scenes within the film with filters; two of these darkened scenes were omitted entirely.Henry Bacon, Visconti: Explorations of Beauty and Decay, Cambridge University Press, 1998, p. 102-103 Reception=Box office= The film was the 27th most popular film of the year in France.French box office for 1961 at Box Office Story It sold 10 220 365 tickets in Italy. http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=9412 =Critical response= The film critic for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther, gave the film a positive review and appreciated the direction of the film and acting. He wrote \\"A fine Italian film to stand alongside the American classic, The Grapes of Wrath, opened last night ...It is Luchino Visconti's Rocco and His Brothers (Rocco e i suoi fratelli), and it comes here garlanded with laurels that are quite as appropriate in this context as they are richly deserved...Signor Visconti has clearly conceived his film and that is what his brilliant handling of events and characters makes one feel. There's a blending of strong emotionalism and realism to such an extent that the margins of each become fuzzy and indistinguishable...Alain Delon as the sweet and loyal Rocco...is touchingly pliant and expressive, but it is Renato Salvatori...who fills the screen with the anguish of a tortured and stricken character. His raw and restless performance is overpowering and unforgettable...[and the] French actress Annie Girardot is likewise striking as the piteous prostitute...\\"Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, January 28, 1961. Last accessed: December 31, 2007. The staff at Variety lauded the drama, and wrote \\"With all its faults, this is one of the top achievements of the year in Italy...Scripting shows numerous hands at work, yet all is pulled together by Visconti's dynamic and generally tasteful direction. Occasionally, as in the near-final revelation to the family of Simone's crime, the action gets out of hand and comes close to melodrama. Yet the impact of the main story line, aided by the sensitive, expertly guided playing of Alain Delon as Rocco, Annie Girardot as the prostitute, and Renato Salvatori as Simone, is great. Katina Paxinou at times is perfect, at others she is allowed to act too theatrically and off-key.\\"Variety. Film review, September 6, 1960. Last accessed: December 31, 2007. When the film was released in DVD format, critic Glenn Erickson wrote \\"A major pleasure of Rocco and his Brothers is simply seeing its portrait of life in working-class Milan in 1960. Beautifully directed in the housing projects and streets of the city, this is a prime example of a film which will accrue historical interest simply because it shows so much of how people lived and what places looked like (now) 40 years ago.\\"Erikson, Eric.

Founded in 1991 as Bromley Borough, later under the name Croydon Women's F.C., between 2000‚Äì2007 as Charlton Athletic the club was one of the most successful women's teams in England. After the parent club's relegation from the Premier League, the women's set up was controversially disbanded in the summer of 2007, causing almost all of the senior squad to depart, although later on a rescue sponsorship package was formed allowing the women's set up to continue. In September 2010 the team secured a two-year shirt sponsorship deal with safety, health and environmental consultancy firm PHSC plc. This was later extended until the end of 2016‚Äì17 season, after which the shirt sponsorship was aligned with the men's team. Currently the shirts bear the name of the charity Children with Cancer. The clubs Principle Sponsor is The British Institute of Kitchen, Bedroom & Bathroom Installation (BiKBBI). CAWFC won the FA Women's Premier League Southern Division title in 2017‚Äì18. On 27 May 2018 they beat Northern Division champions Blackburn Rovers Ladies FC 2‚Äì1 in a play-off final at Bramall Lane, Sheffield, and thus gained promotion to the FA Women's Championship, the second tier of women's football, for the season 2018‚Äì19. History= Bromley Borough= The team was formed in 1991 as Bromley Borough by disaffected members of Millwall Lionesses' WFA Cup winning squad. The team broke up in the aftermath of that success Hope Powell moved with team mate Sue Law to form a new club. They were initially led by Richard Hall with the support of Dan \\"Le Phyz\\" Kane. Beginning in the South East Counties League, the club quickly progressed through the divisions. After adding England player Brenda Sempare in 1992, Bromley Borough won all 16 matches in the South East Counties League Division One, scoring 142 goals in the process. The team also reached the semi final of the Women's FA Cup, where they lost 2‚Äì0 to treble-winning Arsenal. In 1993‚Äì94 Bromley Borough won the National League Division One South by ten points, securing promotion into the top flight of English women's football. Although they were handed a chastening 10‚Äì1 defeat by Doncaster Belles in the fifth round of the FA Women's Cup Following a swift rise through the divisions, the club won promotion into the National Premier League. =Croydon= The club entered the top-flight as Croydon, having tied up with Croydon FC. Debbie Bampton was appointed player- manager in the 1994 close season. She built a strong team which supplied six of England's squad for the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup including Kerry Davis as well as Bampton, Powell and Sempare. After securing a fourth-placed finish in 1994‚Äì95, in 1995‚Äì96 Bampton led the team to a domestic double. After losing both domestic Cup finals to Arsenal Ladies in 1998, the club recaptured the League title in 1999. Another League and FA Women's Cup double followed in 2000.Charlton's Bonus chance Takeover At Croydon's AGM in June 2000, the club's players controversially voted to accept a hostile takeover from Charlton Athletic. Bampton resigned as manager, as both the club's committee and the FA declared affiliation with the men's Premier League club to be against the rules. The Croydon F.C. chairman, Ken Jarvie, also attempted to block the move which was eventually sanctioned. =Charlton Athletic= The club's first silverware under the new name came in the same year when the Charity Shield was shared with Arsenal, after the match resulted in a draw. Charlton reached the FA Cup final in 2003 but lost 3‚Äì0 to Fulham. In the following season (2003‚Äì04) Charlton finished runners-up in the Premier League, just one point behind winners Arsenal, and again reached the F.A. Cup final which they lost to Arsenal. The season did bring success to the club, though, with a victory over Fulham in the final of the League Cup. In 2004‚Äì05, Charlton won both the Charity Shield (beating Arsenal) and the FA Cup (beating Everton) and once more finished runners up in the league to Arsenal. In 2005‚Äì06, Charlton regained the League Cup, beating Arsenal in the Final. However, in this season, and also the 2006‚Äì07 season, Charlton finished third in the league, meaning the club missed the opportunity to participate in the UEFA Cup. In May 2007, Charlton were again runners up in the FA Cup, losing to Arsenal in the final. During these successful years under manager Keith Boanas and assistant Matt Beard, the team included several current and former England internationals, notably club captain Casey Stoney, goalkeeper Pauline Cope, Joanne Broadhurst, Eniola Aluko and Katie Chapman. Aluko and Chapman went on to play professionally in the United States. Controversial disbandment The same day as the 2007 FA Cup final, Charlton Athletic's men's team was relegated from the Premier League. It became evident that, in order to ensure the club's financial survival, a number of budget cuts would have to be enacted. On 23 June 2007 it was announced that Charlton's women's set up would form part of this. This decision was criticised by, among others, several of the club's players at the time, including Casey Stoney and Danielle Murphy. Charlton's chief executive, Peter Varney, defended the decision and pointed to the lack of exposure in the media and lack of funding given to the women's game from the Football Association as reasons for undertaking the decision. Resurrection On 22 August 2007, it was announced sponsorship had been secured by Charlton for the women's set up, allowing a senior side to continue to compete under Charlton's name. The women's team, now controlled by the Charlton Community Trust, the organisation which operates Charlton's community programmes, appointed former Charlton player Paul Mortimer as the women's team's new coach. However, due to the exodus of players after the original closure announcement, only two players from the previous squad remained by the time the club's rescue was in place although a few more returned as the season progressed. The reconstituted team finished bottom of the National Division of the FA Women's Premier League at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season, thereby relegating them to the League's Southern Division. The team stabilised at this level and a reserve team was successfully re-established, twice winning the Kent Women's Cup in 2008‚Äì09 and 2010‚Äì11. The first team were promoted back to the National Division at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season as Southern Division champions. Rehabilitation Following an unsuccessful bid to enter the new Women's Super League that was formed in 2013‚Äì14, the club has played in the FA Women's Premier League, Southern Division. An FA requirement at the time of the bid was that applicant clubs were to be a separate legal entity. This led to the formation of Charlton Athletic Women's Football Club Limited on 9 February 2013. The majority shareholder is Stephen King, CEO of PHSC plc. CAWFC won the FA Women's Premier League Cup in 2015, beating Sheffield FC 4‚Äì2 on penalties after it was 0‚Äì0 at the end of extra time in a match held at Nuneaton Borough FC'c ground. The club made the final again in 2017 but were defeated by Tottenham Hotspur Ladies 4‚Äì3 on penalties after a scoreless match and extra time.

Albert Angelo is the second novel written by the experimental novelist B. S. Johnson (1933‚Äì1973). Published in 1964 by Constable (and reissued in 1987 by New Directions), the book achieved fame for having holes cut in several pages as a narrative technique. It is written in an unusual and pioneering style, frequently changing from first-person narrative to third-person commentary, and often descending into stream-of-consciousness interior monologue. Like many of Johnson's novels it is an auto-biographical work. Plot Albert Angelo tells the story of Albert Angelo, a substitute teacher who longs to be a professional architect. He has had to resort to teaching to make ends meet, as he is not an accomplished enough architect to make a living from it. Living in a flat in Angel in London, he finds himself teaching in increasingly tougher schools, and part of the story concerns his struggle with difficult pupils in class, mirroring Albert's struggle with life in general. Through the reproduction of some of their essays, we also learn the pupils' opinions of Albert and their attitudes towards him, which are often hilarious. Albert devotes much thought to his ex-girlfriend Jenny, with whom he is still very much in love and who he feels betrayed him. He reminisces about her frequently. His friend Terry, whom he accompanies to late-night cafes, was also 'betrayed' by a woman, and their friendship is built upon this common experience. The story is at times humorous and at others incredibly serious. As is usual in a Johnson novel sexuality is openly and frankly discussed. Johnson's writing technique allows us to view Albert's character from many angles. Style As mentioned, the book is written in an unorthodox style. This is typical of Johnson, though it is not uniform throughout his books. Albert Angelo is divided into several parts, ending with a coda, normally used in musical score. Several of the pages have holes cut into them, allowing the reader to glimpse events further ahead in the story. The book closes with an intervention by the author, explaining what he was trying to achieve in writing it. In this section is Johnson's unshakeable belief recorded - Telling stories is telling lies.

Research and career Slowinski was born on November 15, 1962 in New York City, New York. He attained his bachelor's degree in biology from the University of Kansas in 1984 and went on to receive his Ph.D. at the University of Miami in 1991, studying under herpetologist Jay M. Savage. He performed postdoctoral work at the National Museum of Natural History and Louisiana State University, eventually taking a position as a professor of biology at Southeastern Louisiana University. Slowinski was a founder of the first online herpetological journal, Contemporary Herpetology, and served as its editor-in- chief. He was also the curator for the Department of Herpetology for the California Academy of Sciences. His primary area of research was venomous snakes, having written some 40 peer-reviewed articles and one book. Death and legacy On September 11, 2001, while researching in an isolated region of Myanmar, Slowinski was bitten by a juvenile multi-banded krait (Bungarus multicinctus). He died 29 hours later after his team, which included Mark W. Moffett, made several failed attempts to obtain medical attention. The September 11 terrorist attacks made communication with the embassy difficult, and by the time the embassy prepared a helicopter, the weather was particularly bad, thus preventing a helicopter from transporting Slowinski to a hospital, and making it impossible to carry medical supplies to the campsite. A biography of Slowinski titled The Snake Charmer was written in 2008 by Jamie James. Three species have been named after Slowinski: a species of North American corn snake (Pantherophis slowinskii ), a species of bent- toed gecko native to Myanmar (Cyrtodactylus slowinskii ), and a species of krait native to Vietnam (Bungarus slowinskii ).

It was formed in 1852 and began operation in 1855. The Philadelphia and Reading Railway, predecessor to the Reading Company, leased the North Pennsylvania in 1879. Its tracks were transferred to Conrail and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in 1976. History The company incorporated on April 8, 1852, as the Philadelphia, Easton and Water Gap. Construction began on June 16, 1853; the company changed its name to the North Pennsylvania Railroad on October 3 that year. The new name reflected the grand (and unrealized) ambitions of the company to extend all the way across Pennsylvania to Waverly, New York and a junction with the Erie Railroad. The railway opened between Front and Willow Streets, Philadelphia and Gwynedd on July 2, 1855, a distance of . On October 7 the Doylestown Branch opened to Doylestown via Lansdale. Within Philadelphia, the company's passenger depot was located at Third and Berks; tracks continued south to a freight depot at Willow and Front street on the waterfront. In 1856, the company suffered its first accident in the Great Train Wreck of 1856, the most significant railroad wreck in the world up to that time. The railroad continued to expand northward from Philadelphia. The main line reached Bethlehem, running parallel to the Bethlehem Pike, on July 7, 1857. At Bethlehem the railroad interchanged with the Lehigh Valley Railroad. The Shimersville Branch, from Iron Hill to Shimersville on the Lehigh Valley Railroad east of Bethlehem, opened on January 1, 1857. The branch carried little traffic; the North Pennsylvania leased it that same year to the Lehigh Valley and Delaware Water Gap Railroad as part of a stillborn venture to build a new route through Easton to a junction with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. By the time of the Reading lease the branch was out of service. The company built, with the Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad, a line from Jenkintown to Bound Brook, New Jersey, creating a new route between Philadelphia and New York. The Delaware River Branch opened on May 1, 1876, in time for the Centennial Exposition. = Reading control = The Reading Company leased North Pennsylvania Railroad on May 14, 1879. The North Pennsylvania continued to exist as a company, and would be merged along with the Reading into Conrail in 1976 as a result of the Reading's final bankruptcy. Most of the North Pennsylvania's lines continue to exist: * The main line became the Reading's Bethlehem Branch; through passenger service continued under SEPTA until 1981. The line is out of service north of Quakertown and south of Fern Rock, Philadelphia. SEPTA operates Lansdale/Doylestown Line commuter trains to Doylestown. Freight trains are operated on the portion from Lansdale to Quakertown by Pennsylvania Northeastern Railroad and East Penn Railroad. * The Delaware River Branch became the New York Branch; the Reading also leased the Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad. Through passenger service to Jersey City ended in 1981; SEPTA West Trenton Line trains continue to operate as far as West Trenton. The line remains open for freight use as part of CSX's Trenton Subdivision. * The North East Pennsylvania Railroad's route became the New Hope Branch; SEPTA's Warminster Line trains run as far as Warminster. The New Hope & Ivyland Railroad owns and operates Warminster‚ÄìNew Hope. * The Stony Creek Railroad became the Stony Creek Branch under the Reading.

The municipality is located 27 km north of Beirut. Its average elevation is 550 meters above sea level and its total land area is 435 hectares. Harissa is accessible from the coastal city of Jounieh either by road or by a nine-minute journey by a gondola lift, known as the T√©l√©ph√©rique. Harissa is home to an important Lebanese pilgrimage site, Our Lady of Lebanon.http://www.tourism-lebanon.com/Jounieh.asp It attracts both pilgrims and tourists who want to enjoy views of the bay of Jounieh. Daraoun contains three schools, one public and two private, that enrolled a total of 457 students as of 2008, while Harissa had one private school with 242 students during that same time period. There were eight companies with over five employees operating in Daraoun as of 2008, and two companies with over five employees in Harissa during that same period. Daraoun's inhabitants are predominantly Maronite Catholics, while Harissa has a mixed population of Melkite and Maronite Catholics. Our Lady of Lebanon=Founding= Observation deck at the Shrine Harissa is a key Christian pilgrimage site with a shrine dedicated to Our Lady of Lebanon (Notre Dame du Liban). In 1904, Patriarch Elias Hoyek, on the 50th anniversary of the proclamation of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, announced the foundation of the building of Our Lady of Lebanon. The shrine belongs to the Maronite Patriarchate who entrusted its administration to the Congregation of Maronite Lebanese Missionaries since its foundation in 1904. The original church was built by Sleiman Yakoub Hokayim from Batrun. The mountain is called Harissa (after the village at the peak of the mountain). When it was inaugurated in 1908 the Patriarch dedicated Lebanon to the Virgin Mary: \\"Oh Mary, Queen of mountains and seas and Queen of our beloved Lebanon ...‚Äù Patriarch Hoyek designated the first Sunday in the month of May as the Feast of Our Lady of Lebanon. On this day the Maronite Patriarch and all the Lebanese Bishops celebrate the Divine Liturgy in the open air at the Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon. Our Lady of Lebanon is one of the most important shrines in the world honoring the Virgin Mary. The shrine is highlighted by a huge, 15-ton bronze statue of the Immaculate Conception, Mother of God. It is 8.5 m high, and has a diameter of five meters. The Virgin Mary stretches her hands towards Beirut. The shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon draws millions of faithful both Christians and Muslims from all over the world. The 50th jubilee in 1954 was also the hundredth anniversary of the establishment of the Immaculate Conception. During these Jubilee celebrations, Pope Pius XII sent his representative, Cardinal Angelo Roncalli to Lebanon, the later Pope John XXIII. Pope John Paul II visited Our Lady of Lebanon in 1997. The Congregation of Maronite Lebanese Missionaries, responsible for the administration, works at reinforcing relations among all local Churches, Christian communities and apostolic movements. =Religious significance= Our Lady of Lebanon Shrine Majestic View From Harissa Daraoun Town From Harissa Harissa Cathedral Lebanon Harissa Cathedral From Bat'ha The pilgrimage site there is a large, 15-ton bronze (and painted white) statue of Virgin Mary, known as Our Lady of Lebanon or Notre Dame du Liban, with her arms stretched.

He was also Welk's second cousin. Drummer Johnny Klein of the Lawrence Welk Show Born in Strasburg, North Dakota, Klein was the son of German-Russian parents and the oldest of five children. It was during his early years that he took up music, especially the drums, which he played with several area bands. Upon graduating from high school in 1936, Johnny first enrolled at the University of North Dakota. Later he enrolled at the University of Missouri, where he graduated with both a Bachelor of Arts and Masters Degree in Music Education. He also served in the Army during World War II. In 1951, while Klein was studying for his master's degree in Columbia, Missouri, Welk and his orchestra came to St. Louis, Missouri for an engagement. Welk encouraged his cousin to try out for his band, which he accepted. For the next twenty-five years, in addition to being featured drummer, Klein was the band's equipment manager and the driver of the band truck while out on tour. However, ill health due to a bleeding ulcer forced him to step down full-time in 1976. After a recovering, he served as Welk's music librarian with the organization. He also continued to perform as well, often playing for the Sunday Swing at the Welk Resort in Escondido with a group called the Journeymen and with other clubs until his retirement in the 1990s.

In the US, the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) had recruited Mafia support to protect the New York waterfront from Axis Powers sabotage since the US had entered the war in December 1941. The ONI collaborated with Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano and his partner Meyer Lansky, a Jewish mobster, in what was called Operation Underworld. The resulting Mafia contacts were also used by the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) ‚Äì the wartime predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) ‚Äì during the invasion of Sicily. Popular myth has it that a US Army airplane had flown over Vizzini‚Äôs home town Villalba on the day of the invasion and dropped a yellow silk handkerchief marked with a black L (indicating Luciano). Two days later, three American tanks rolled into Villalba after driving thirty miles through enemy territory. Vizzini climbed aboard and spent the next six days traveling through western Sicily organizing support for the advancing American troops. As General Patton's Third Division moved onward the signs of its dependence on Mafia support were obvious to the local population. The Mafia protected the roads from snipers, arranged enthusiastic welcomes for the advancing troops, and provided guides through the confusing mountain terrain.Hoodlums & History, Time Magazine, August 5, 1966, review of the book \\"The Mafia and Politics\\" by Michele Pantaleone.The Mafia Restored: Fighters for Democracy in World War II , The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia, Alfred W.

Early career Thomas began his career typing invoices for a firm of wire-drawers in Manchester. While doing that job, he taught himself to write newspaper articles and short plays. When some of these articles were published, he managed to get a job in the firm's advertising department. That job enabled Thomas to mix with advertising agents and through networking he obtained a position with F John Roe, one of Manchester's advertising agencies. He moved to the London agency F C Prichard Wood and Partners, and he continued to write articles, having a London entertainment column in the Manchester Evening Chronicle. This column was spotted by the London Press Exchange and he was hired by them as a copywriter. Commercial radio At London Press Exchange, Thomas worked in the commercial radio section, at first writing, then producing commercial packages for companies including Cadbury's. These packages, usually of music or variety acts interspersed with subtle commercials for the sponsor, were then placed on Radio Luxembourg and similar longwave broadcasters who could be heard in the UK. In this position, he came to the attention of the BBC, and he began to submit scripts and programme ideas to them while continuing to work for the international commercial broadcasters. However, at the outbreak of World War II, the commercial broadcasters closed and the advertising market contracted. Thomas kept his post at London Press Exchange, but effectively had no work to do. He attempted to fill time by writing books about the blackout and writing more articles for newspapers, and also worked for Publicity Films Limited producing public information films. BBC radio On the outbreak of war, the BBC had closed its existing two Regional Programme and National Programme stations and replaced them with a single national station, the Home Service (now BBC Radio 4). This move was criticised as it led to boredom amongst the listeners during the Phony War, who were also faced with cinemas and sporting events being closed \\"for the duration\\" and the loss of the competition to the BBC. As the Phony War ended, the BBC decided to introduce an entertainment- based national radio station, primarily for the men under arms. The new service, the Forces Programme hired many new producers from the former commercial agencies, including Howard Thomas. =Ack Ack Beer Beer= Thomas's first assignment was to produce the programme Ack Ack Beer Beer, an entertainment and variety programme for anti-aircraft and barrage balloon emplacements. Both jobs featured very little action and therefore the BBC felt that 'lively' entertainment had to be provided for the crews. Under Thomas, the programme developed into a miscellany of variety, talk, music and comedy, using whatever talent was available near the evacuated Variety Department's studios in Bristol. On occasion this was no talent at all, and Thomas later told of an edition made up of him and his co-producer playing \\"Shove ha'penny\\", which had the side effect of reintroducing the game to the population. =Sincerely Yours, Vera Lynn= With Bristol now a victim of the Blitz, the Variety Department moved to Bangor in north Wales. However, feeling that opportunities for variety would be limited there, Thomas engineered a move back to London. In London he spotted singer Vera Lynn in a stage show. He created a radio programme for her called Sincerely Yours, Vera Lynn where she sang popular tunes of the time, read out letters from servicemen and introduced entertainers. The show was a hit, both with the forces and the country at large, although the senior officers of both the British Army and the Royal Navy strongly objected to the sentimental and \\"soppy\\" music and presentation. Nevertheless, the show helped turn the song \\"We'll Meet Again\\" into one of the best selling pieces of music throughout the war. The show also cemented Vera Lynn's title of \\"forces' sweetheart\\" and ensured that she would remain, as of 2006, something akin to a national treasure in the UK. To assuage critics of Sincerely Yours, Thomas introduced the programme I Am John Bull, featuring military marches and \\"strong\\" music. The programme was not successful. =Shipmates Ashore= The BBC Forces Programme provided distinct programming for each of the armed services. However, the Merchant Navy, not being classed as an armed service and under the patronage of the Ministry of Labour, was not included. Howard Thomas began a programme named Shipmates Ashore aimed at this audience. The programme was set in a Merchant Navy club and quickly became an effectively real club, with free beer and \\"companionship\\" for visiting merchant seamen. The show featured a mixture of music, singing, comedy and information (in the form of a \\"ship's newspaper\\") as well as providing a platform for discussion of issues of interest to the sailors. The programme was presented by Doris Hare. =The Brains Trust= As conceived by Howard Thomas and Douglas Cleverdon, The Brains Trust was a simple mixture of light panel game entertainment and heavier discussion of items of scientific, legal, medical and social importance. At that time, there was much discussion in the UK about the shape of the world and the country after the war, which reached its peak with the Beveridge Report and the 1945 landslide election of Attlee's Labour government. The programme featured Professor Cyril E. M. Joad, previously rejected for radio for his strange speaking voice; the writer and zoologist Julian Huxley; and the loud and entertaining Archibald Bruce Campbell. The programme first aired under the title Any Questions? and drew a small audience and few questions. However, within a few weeks it had caught the zeitgeist of the nation, gaining an audience of 11¬Ωmillion. The series was extended from a run of 12 episodes into an open-ended series that ran into the 1950s. However, the popularity of the programme, dealing as it did with matters of controversy and politics, caused complaints of left-wing bias from within the BBC and from commentators outside. The BBC attempted to modify the format of the programme to avoid this but also sought to avoid damaging the shows popularity. With military criticism of Sincerely Yours, general complaints about the bawdy humour in Shipmates Ashore and political criticism of The Brains Trust, the BBC sought a scapegoat and pressured Howard Thomas to leave. In 1944, he resigned. British Path√© On leaving the BBC, Howard Thomas joined the Associated British Picture Corporation as head of British Path√©, the newsreel and film company. Thomas relaunched the ailing Path√© Gazette as Path√© News, began hiring new cameramen and pioneered the switch to colour film. He also arranged for the Path√© archives, then of little or no intrinsic value to the company, to be indexed and properly preserved for future use. ABC-TV By the 1950s, it was becoming clear that television was eroding the size of cinema audiences. Frustrated at his inability to convince the Associated British Picture Corporation that it should either expand into production of popular feature films or bid for one of the new commercial broadcasting licences offered under the Television Act 1954 by the Independent Television Authority (ITA), Howard Thomas began to look for roles in the new ITV companies that were being started. He was offered the job of General Manager of Kemsley- Winnick Television, the new weekend contractor for the midlands and north of England. However, before he could take up the job, Lord Kemsley pulled out of the company and the contract lapsed. The ITA made a last-ditch attempt to get the Associated British Picture Corporation involved in commercial television as a replacement for Kemsley-Winnick. The board of the company was finally convinced to try, and signed a contract with the ITA on 21 September 1955 to form Associated British Cinemas (Television) Limited to take over the contract. Howard Thomas was appointed as managing director of the company and hired Sydney Newman and Brian Tesler as his controllers of drama and light entertainment respectively. Thames Television In 1966, the ITA announced that the pattern of broadcasting for Independent Television was to change from 1968. All contractors would be required to reapply for their contracts, and, though there would be one more contract available than before (for Yorkshire), the previous weekend splits in the three central regions of London, the midlands and the north of England would be altered. The London split would change to Friday evenings (rather than the self-contained weekend it had previously been) and the midlands and the north would be redivided into three whole-week regions. ABC's contract area would therefore cease to exist. Howard Thomas had planned for ABC Television to apply for the extended London weekends contract (with an application for the Midlands seven-day contract as a stand-by). However, the appearance of a consortium of major figures from the BBC and Rediffusion under the leadership of David Frost made this difficult. The London Television Consortium (later London Weekend Television) won the contract, and the ITA was left with no place for ABC. The ITA's solution was to ask ABC and Rediffusion to merge to form a new company. They specified that ABC would have a slim majority of the shares, and that the managing director would be Howard Thomas. In practice, the merger proved impossible due to outside interests held by both parent companies. Instead, the parent companies formed a joint company called Thames Television Holdings Limited (trading as Thames Television), which took over the staff of ABC in Teddington and a minority of staff from Rediffusion. Management and on-screen talent was mainly provided by ABC. Thames retained the London weekdays licence until 31 December 1992. Retirement The Independent Broadcasting Authority set a limit on the age of managing directors of ITV companies, specifying that they retire at the age of 75. When Howard Thomas reached this age, Thames Television Holdings (the company that held the shares in Thames formerly held by the now-defunct Associated British Picture Corporation) promoted him from Thames Television to become chairman of Thames Television International ‚Äì then a subsidiary of Thames but previously known as EMI Films and, before that, the remains of the former ABC owner Associated British Picture Corporation. Family Howard Thomas married Hilda in 1934 and they had two daughters, Rosemary and Carol. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1967.

This difference is small in fluorine but large in iodine (in favor of the anion) and therefore the energy trend is as described despite the fact that C-F bonds are stronger than C-I bonds.

After his death, it became the home of his widow, Maria Feodorovna. The palace and the large English garden surrounding it are now a Russian state museum and public park. History=Catherine and Grand Duke Paul= In 1777, the Empress Catherine II of Russia gave a parcel of a thousand hectares of forest along the winding Slavyanka River, four kilometers from her residence at Tsarskoye Selo, to her son and heir Paul I and his wife Maria Feodorovna, to celebrate the birth of their first son, the future Alexander I of Russia. At the time the land was given to Paul and Maria Feodorovna, there were two rustic log lodges called Krik and Krak. Paul and his wife spent the summers of 1777 to 1780 in Krik, while their new homes and the garden were being built.Massie, p. 15 They began by building two wooden buildings, one kilometer apart. Paul's house, a two-story house in the Dutch style, with small gardens, was called \\"Marienthal\\", or the \\"Valley of Maria\\". Maria's house was a small wooden house with a cupola and flower beds, named \\"Paullust\\", or \\"Paul's Joy\\". Paul and Maria Feodorovna began to create picturesque \\"ruins\\", a Chinese kiosk, Chinese bridges and classical temples in the English landscape garden style which had spread rapidly across Europe in the second half of the 18th century.Orloff and Chvidkovsky, p. 289 In 1780, Catherine the Great loaned her official architect, the Scotsman Charles Cameron, to design a palace on a hillside overlooking the Slavyanka River, near the site of Marienthal. Cameron had studied under English architect Isaac Ware, who was close to William Kent. Kent introduced the Palladian style of architecture into England with his work at Chiswick House for Lord Burlington. Through this connection Cameron became familiar with the original plans of Palladio, which were in the personal collection of Lord Burlington. This style was the major influence on Cameron when he designed Pavlovsk.Orloff and Chvidkovsky, p. 290 Cameron began his project not with the palace itself but with two classical pavilions. The first was the Temple of Friendship, a circular Dorian temple with sixteen columns supporting a low dome, containing a statue of Catherine the Great. It was placed at a bend of the Slavyanka River, below the future palace, and was surrounded by silver poplars and transplanted Siberian pines. The second was the Apollo Colonnade, a double row of columns with an entablature, forming a setting for a reproduction of the Belvedere Apollo. It was placed at the entrance of the park, and it was made of porous limestone with a coarse finish; the surfaces suggest that they had been aged by centuries of weather. At the same time the Slavyanka River was dammed, to create a lake which would mirror the facade of the palace above.Massie, p. 20 Maria Feodorovna also insisted in having several rustic structures which recalled the palace where she grew up at √âtupes, forty miles from Basel, in what was then the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg and today is in Alsace. Cameron constructed a small Swiss chalet with a library; a dairy of rough stones with a thatched roof, where milk products were kept and prepared, and an aviary in the form of a small classical temple with metal netting between the Dorian columns, which was filled with nightingales, goldfinch, starlings and quail. For the palace itself, Cameron conceived a country house which seems to have been based on a design by Andrea Palladio shown in a woodcut in his book I quattro libri dell'architettura, for the Villa Capra \\"La Rotonda\\" near Vicenza in Italy. This same drawing was later used by Thomas Jefferson in his design for the University of Virginia. The palace he designed had a cube- shaped central block three stories high with a low dome supported by sixty- four columns. On either side of the building were two single story colonnades of curved open winged galleries connected to service buildings one and a half stories high. Each facade of the palace was decorated with molded friezes and reliefs.Massie, p. 22. In September 1781, as construction of the Pavlovsk Palace began, Paul and Maria set off on a journey to Austria, Italy, France and Germany. They traveled under the incognito of \\"The Count and Countess of the North\\". During their travels they saw the palaces and French gardens of Versailles and Chantilly, which strongly influenced the future appearance of Pavlovsk Park. King Louis XVI presented them with four Gobelin tapestries, Marie Antoinette presented Maria Feodorovna with a sixty-piece toilet set of S√®vres porcelain, and they ordered more sets of porcelain and purchased statues, busts, paintings, furniture and paintings, all for Pavlovsk. While they traveled, they kept in contact almost daily with Kuchelbecker, the supervisor of construction at Pavlovsk, sending back and forth drawings, plans and notes on the smallest details.Massie, p. 32 Paul and Maria Feodorovna returned in November 1782, and they continued to fill Pavlovsk with art objects. A shipment of antique marbles, statues, busts, urns, and pottery discovered and purchased at Pompei, arrived in 1783. Sixteen sets of furniture, over two hundred pieces, were ordered from Paris between 1783-85 for the State Rooms. In 1784, twelve Hubert Robert landscapes were commissioned for Pavlovsk. The couple purchased ninety-six clocks from Europe. The Imperial Glass factory, made special chandeliers for each room. In the midst of the construction, tensions grew between them and Cameron. Cameron was used to the unlimited budget for materials given him by Catherine the Great, while Catherine gave very little money to Paul; and Cameron was annoyed by the furniture, tapestries and fireplaces brought back from Europe by Maria Feodorovna without consulting him. Maria Feodorovna in turn was annoyed by the bright polychrome decoration and Pompeian arabesques used by Cameron, and wanted more delicate colors, and Paul did not like anything that resembled the style of his mother's house, the Catherine Palace at Tsarskoye Selo. The tensions led to a parting in 1786. Cameron left to build a new palace for Catherine in the Crimea. He had finished entry vestibule and the five rooms of the private apartments. The work of decorating the interior was taken over by an Italian architect, Vincenzo Brenna, from Florence, who had come to Russia in 1783. Brenna designed interiors which reflected Paul's taste for Roman classicism. He created the white and gold Halls of War and Peace, on either side of the Greek Hall by Cameron, which had a colonnade of green false marble columns, resembling a Greek temple. He made the Italian hall into a replica of a Roman temple, and he built the State Bedroom for Maria Feodorovna as an imitation of the state bedroom of the King of France, with a huge gilded bed, and cream silk wallpaper painted in tempura with colorful flowers, fruit, musical instruments and gardening tools. =Paul I and Maria Feodorovna= Catherine the Great died in 1796, and Paul became Emperor. He decided to enlarge Pavlovsk into a palace suitable for a royal residence, adding two new wings on either side of the main building, and a church attached to the south wing. Between 1797 and 1799, he lavished money and the finest materials on Brenna's interiors. The reign of Emperor Paul did not last long. He alienated the nobles, and became increasingly fearful of conspiracies. His fears were justified; the Emperor Paul was murdered by members of his court in 1801, and his son Alexander became Emperor. Pavlovsk Palace became the residence of the Empress Maria Feodorovna (1759‚Äì1828), the mother of both Emperor Alexander I of Russia and Emperor Nicholas I of Russia. She turned the house into a memorial to her murdered husband, filled with his furniture and portraits, and made the house a showcase for finest 18th-century French furnishings, paintings, sculpture and porcelain. Another disaster struck Pavlovsk in 1803; a fire caused by a defective chimney destroyed a major part of the interior of the palace, including all the decor of the State Apartments and living rooms. Most of the furniture was saved, along with some door panels, fireplaces and mirrors, but most of the Palace had to be rebuilt. Maria Feodorovna brought Cameron and Brenna's young assistant, the Italian architect Carlo Rossi, to help restore the Palace. She also employed a Russian architect, Andrei Voronykhin, who had been born a serf, and was trained in decoration and design, who rose to become the architect of Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg. Voronykhin was named chief architect of Pavlovsk by Maria Feodorovna. He brought back the architect Quarenghi, who had redecorated five rooms on the main floor, to recreate his work. He remade some of the rooms, such as the Tapestry Room and the State Bedroom, exactly as they had been, but for other rooms he added decoration inspired by Roman models discovered at Pompeii and Herculaneum; Roman-style lamps, furniture, Roman couches, and chairs copied after those of Roman senators. Following the French taste of the time for Egyptian art, he added black Egyptian statues in the entry vestibule of the Palace, He redesigned the Greek and Italian halls, replacing the molding on the walls with false marble, and he added a Russian touch; fireplaces faced with Russian lapis-lazuli and jasper, which had originally been in the Mikhailovsky Palace that Paul had built in St. Petersburg. Voronykhin also made plans for a semi-circular library in one of the wings, which was later built by Carlo Rossi, and he redesigned the private apartments of Maria Feodorovna on the ground floor, which included a library, boudoir and bedroom. He installed French doors and large windows in the apartment, so the flower garden outside seemed to be part of the interior.Massie, p. 70 In 1805 Voronykhin built the Centaur bridge in the park, and the Visconti bridge, which crossed the Slavyanka at a point it was filled with water lilies. His last construction in the park was the Rose Pavilion, built in 1811, a simple structure surrounded entirely by rosebushes. The Rose Pavilion was the site of a grand fete on 12 July 1814, celebrating the return of Alexander I to St. Petersburg after the defeat of Napoleon. For the occasion, architect Pietro de Gottardo Gonzaga built a ballroom the size of the Rose Pavilion itself in just seventeen days, and surrounded it with huge canvases of Russian villagers celebrating the victory. The ball inside the pavilion opened with a Polonaise led by Alexander and his mother, and ended with a huge display of fireworks. In her later years Maria Feodorovna had a literary salon at Pavlovsk, which was frequented by poet Vasily Zhukovsky, fabulist Ivan Krylov, and historian Nikolai Karamzin. The last great St. Petersburg architect to work at Pavlovsk was Carlo Rossi, who in 1824 designed the library, which contained more than twenty thousand books as well as collections of rare coins and butterflies. He also designed the Corner Salon, where Maria Feodorovna received guests such as the first American Ambassador to Russia, John Quincy Adams, and the Lavender Room, whose walls were made of lilac-colored false marble, matching the lilac flowers outside the windows. These rooms were furnished with furniture made of native Russian woods, including Karelian birch, poplar and walnut.Massie, p. 99 =Later history= Maria Feodorovna died on 24 October 1828, fourteen days after her sixty-seventh birthday. She left the house to her younger son, Michael, and specified that none of the furniture should be taken away. After Michael's death, it went to the second son of Nicholas I, Konstantine Nikolayevich. It then passed to his widow and then their eldest son, Konstantine Konstantinovich. Her descendants respected the will, and turned the house into a family museum, just as it was when she died. =Russian Revolution= At the time of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the eldest son of Constantine Constantinovich, Prince Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia, along with his wife, Princess Helen of Serbia, the daughter of King Peter I of Serbia, were living in one of the wings of Pavlovsk, together with his father's widowed sister Queen Olga of Greece. As the political situation deteriorated, they left, and the house was left to the care of Alexander Polovotsoff, director of the Art Institute and the Museum of Applied Arts in St. Petersburg. When Lenin and the Bolsheviks seized power in November 1917, Polovtsoff went to the Winter Palace, found Anatoly Lunacharsky, the Commissar of Enlightenment of the new government, and demanded that Pavlovsk be saved as a museum. Lunacharsky agreed and named him Commissar Curator of Pavlovsk. He returned to the Palace and found that a group of revolutionary sailors had searched the Palace for weapons and taken a few sabers, but otherwise everything was in its place. He hired former soldiers to guard the house, put all the furniture into the main building, made an inventory of all the treasures in the Palace, and successfully resisted demands from various revolutionary committees for dishes, chairs, tables, and all the books from the library. He was able to persuade Lunacharsky himself to come to Pavlovsk. After Lunacharsky's visit, Pavlovsk was officially confiscated, but turned into a museum, open to the public two or three days a week. Having succeeded in saving the Palace, Polovtsoff took family and belongings and slipped across the border to Finland and moved to Paris.Polovtsoff, Alexander, Les Tresors d'Art en Russie sous le regime Bolsheviste, Paris, P. Pavlovsky and Co., 1919. Cited in Massie. =World War II= The German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the swiftness of the German advance took the Soviet government by surprise. The morning after the attack, the curators of Pavlovsk, under the direction of museum curator Anatoliy Kuchumov, began to pack as many of art objects as possible, starting with the S√®vres porcelain toilet set given by Louis XVI to Maria Feodorovna and Paul in 1780. Ninety-six hours after the announcement of the beginning of the war, the first thirty-four crates were being carried from the palace by horse-drawn cart. Boards were put over the windows, and sand on the floor of the Palace. Thirty curators often worked by candlelight, and by July there were air raids. The paintings, chandeliers, crystal, porcelain, rare furniture, and works of ivory and amber were packed and sent first. They worked with great care ‚Äì each piece of furniture had to be carefully dismantled, porcelain vases had to be separated from the bases, and delicate clocks had to have their casing and mechanisms separated and packed separately, with diagrams on how to put them back together. One piece of each set of furniture was saved, and the others left behind. The Roman and Greek antiquities were too heavy and delicate to move, so they were taken to the basements, placed as close together as possible, and then hidden by a brick wall. By the third week of August thirteen thousand objects, plus all the documentation, had been packed and sent away. Some crates were sent to Gorky, others to Sarapul, and the last group, on 20 August 1941, went to Leningrad, where the crates were stored in the basement of St Isaac's Cathedral. The last shipment included the chandelier from the Italian Hall and the jasper vases from the Greek Hall. On 30 August, the last rail link from Leningrad to Moscow was cut, and the city was under blockade. By 28 August, the Germans were fifty kilometers from Pavlovsk. A Soviet division headquarters was located in one wing of the palace. As the Germans approached, the park and palace came under bombardment. The museum staff began to bury the statues which were too heavy to evacuate. They calculated that the Germans would not dig deeper than one meter eighty centimeters, so they buried all the statues as deep as three meters. The statues of the Three Graces were buried three meters beneath the private garden of Maria Feodorovna. Their calculations were correct; the statues were still there after the war.Massie, p. 273 On 16 September, the last soldiers left, and the Germans took over Pavlovsk Palace, still occupied by a group of elderly women guardians. The Germans occupied Pavlovsk palace for two and a half years. Officers were quartered in the salons on the first floor, and the ballroom was made into a garage for cars and motorcycles. Barracks were located in the north wing and a hospital in the south wing. German soldiers, Dutch soldiers and Spanish soldiers in special units of the German army occupied the buildings in the park. The sculpture and furniture that remained in the house and all the books of the Rossi Library were taken to Germany. The statue of Emperor Paul in the courtyard was used as a telephone pole. The Germans did not discover the antiquities hidden behind the brick wall in the basement.Massie, p. 273 Pavlovsk was retaken on 24 January 1944. When the Soviet troops arrived, the palace had already been burning for three days. The main building of the Palace was a hollow shell, without a roof or floors. The north wall had fallen. Most of the parquet floors of the palace had been used as firewood; a few pieces were found in unburned portions of the palace near the stoves. Of the more than 100,000 trees that had been in the park before the War, at least 70 percent had been cut down or destroyed by shelling. All the decorative bridges in the park had been blown up. Eight hundred bunkers had been dug in the park. The Rose Pavilion was gone; the Germans had used the materials to construct a fortified dugout. Restoration On 18 February 1944, a meeting was held at the House of Architects in Leningrad to discuss the fate of the ruined Palaces. Academician and architect Aleksei Shchusev, who had designed the Lenin Mausoleum, called for the immediate reconstruction of the Palaces. \\"If we do not do this\\", he said, \\"we who know and remember these palaces in all their glory as they were, then the next generation will never be able to reconstruct them.\\"Massie, p. 279 Even before the war had ended, the Soviet government decided to restore Pavlovsk and the other ruined palaces around Leningrad. First the mines had to be cleared from the ruins and palace and the park. Then the remaining walls were supported with scaffolding, and casts were made of the remaining molding. Fragments of plaster molding were collected, sorting, and casts made. The color of paint still on the remaining walls was carefully noted for later copying. Photographs and early plans of the palace were brought together to help with the restoration. As soon as the war ended, a search began for treasures stolen from the Palace. Curators collected pieces of furniture, fabric, the legs of tables and pieces of doors and gilded cornices from the German fortifications around the Palace. In the buildings which had been German headquarters, they found chairs, marble statues and rolled-up paintings from the Palace. They found other furniture and objects as far away as Riga, Tallinn, and in Konigsberg, in Germany. Some precious objects from Pavlovsk left Russia even before the war. Four Gobelins tapestries from Pavlovsk were sold by the Soviet Government to J. Paul Getty, and are now on display in the Getty Museum in Malibu, California.Massie, p. 310 The restorers used only the original variants of the architectural decoration; those created by Cameron, Brenna, Voronykhin, and Rossi. The only changes permitted were to use modern materials. Columns made of wood were replaced by poured concrete or bricks, and the ceilings of the Italian and Greek Halls were made of steel and concrete so they would be fireproof. A special school, the Mukhina Leningrad Higher Artistic Industry School, was created in Leningrad to teach the arts of restoring architectural details, furniture, and art objects. This school produced a corps of restoration experts who worked on all the palaces around Leningrad. The work was meticulous and difficult, and proceeded very slowly. In 1950, after six years of planting new trees, parts of the park opened to the public. In 1955, the restoration of the facade of the Palace was completed, and restoration of the interiors began. Fortunately for the restorers, the original plans by Cameron, Brenna, Voronykhin and Rossi still existed. Also, fragments of the original interior molding, cornices, friezes and the frames for the carvings, bas- reliefs, medallions and paintings still remained, and could be copied. In addition, there were 2500 photographic negatives taken in the early century by Benois, and another eleven thousand photographs taken just before the war. The chief of the restoration, Feodor Oleinik, was insistent that all the restoration be faithful to the original work: \\"Pay attention and do not use later details\\", he demanded. \\"Only the original variant, only that done by Cameron, Brenna, Vornykhin, or Rossi.\\" Old techniques of artisans of the 18th century, such as painting false marble and gilding furniture, had to be relearned and applied. A silk workshop was opened in Moscow to recreate the original woven fabrics for wall coverings and upholstery, copying the texture, color and thread counts of the originals. In forty rooms of the Palace, painted decoration on the walls and ceilings had to be precisely recreated in the original colors and designs. A Master painter and six helpers recreated the original trompe l'oeil ceilings and wall paintings.Massie, p. 316 Once the interior walls and decoration had been exactly recreated, the next step was the furnishings. The twelve thousand pieces of furniture and art objects removed from their original places, from paintings and tapestries to water pitchers and glasses, had to be put back where they belonged. Furniture, doors, and parquet floors of many different colors of wood which had been burned or stolen were remade exactly like the originals. The crystal chandeliers of the 18th century were exactly copied. In 1957, thirteen years after the Palace had been burned, the first seven rooms were opened to the public.Massie, p. 348 In 1958, four more rooms were opened, and eleven more in 1960. The Egyptian Vestibule was finished in 1963, and the Italian Room opened in 1965. Eleven more rooms were ready by 1967. By 1977, on the 200th anniversary of the beginning of the Palace, fifty rooms were finished, and the Palace looked again as it had in the time of Maria Feodorovna.Massie, p. 348 Pavlovsk Park The Temple of Friendship in Pavlovsk Park (1780) The private garden of Maria Feodorovna. The windows of her private apartment overlooking the garden are visible in the background. The Slavyanka River in Pavlovsk Park in autumn Pavlovsk Park was conceived by Cameron as a classic English landscape garden, an idealized landscape filled with picturesque pieces of classical architecture, designed to surprise and please the viewer. Like the English landscape garden, it took much of its inspiration from the romanticized landscape paintings of Claude Lorraine and Hubert Robert. The gallery of Pavlovsk has twelve landscape paintings by Hubert Robert that were commissioned by Maria Feodorovna. Cameron laid out a triple alley of five straight rows of Linden trees, imported from L√ºbeck, in a long axis from the courtyard of the Palace, leading to a small semi-circular place in the forest. This served as a parade ground for Emperor Pavel's Imperial guards. In the forest to the left of this axis he placed a romantic thatch-roofed dairy with stalls for two cows modeled after the one in the park of W√ºrttemberg where Maria Feodorovna had grown up; and on the other side of the parade route, an aviary, filled with parakeets, nightingales, starlings, and quail. This part of the garden also included a labyrinth, and picturesque tombstones imported from Italy. An early French visitor described the effect of this part of the garden: \\"Melancholy consumes the soul when you arrive...then the pain is followed by pleasure.\\"Saint-Maure, E., Anthologie russe, Paris, 1823 p. 247. Marie Feodorovna was deeply interested in botany. In 1801, Cameron constructed an elegant flower garden behind the Palace, just outside the windows of the private apartment of Marie Feodorovna. Next to the garden was a Greek temple containing a statue of the Three Graces, looking down at the river. She imported flowers from Holland for her garden, including hyacinth, tulips, daffodils and narcissus. She also constructed an orangery and several greenhouses where she grew apricots, cherries, peaches, grapes and pineapples. The River Slavyanovka was the picturesque axis of the composition, with winding paths along the river providing changing views to the visitor. A dam turned the river into a picturesque pond in the valley below the Palace. In 1780, Cameron constructed a large Roman temple at a turn in the river in the bottom of the valley. The classical temple, similar to the Temple of Pan in the gardens at Stowe House in England. It was originally called the Temple of Gratitude, dedicated to Catherine the Great, who had donated the land for the Park, but in 1780 it was renamed the Temple of Friendship, in honor of the visit to Pavlovsk of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor.Orloff and Chvidkovsky, p. 298 Between 1780 and 1783, at the top of the hill which descended to the lake, Cameron constructed a colonnade with a copy of the Apollo Belvedere in Rome.Orloff and Chvidkovsky, p. 296 By the early 19th century, the park at Pavlovsk had gardens representing many different styles. A formal and geometric garden √† la fran√ßaise was planted near the Palace. An Italian garden, with parterres, classical statues and a grand staircase was created by Brenna on the hillside overlooking the lake. Cameron used the intimate Dutch style for the little private garden outside Maria Feodorovna's private apartments, and the huge park was in the style of the English and French landscape garden. An English visitor, John Lowden, who saw Pavlovsk during the war against Napoleon in 1812, wrote that Pavlovsk Park was the most beautiful example of the English landscape garden in all of the Russian Empire.Lowden, John, The Encyclopedia of Gardening, London, 1827, p. 26. Beginning in 1792, the chief architect of the Pavlovsk Park was the Italian landscape architect and painter, Pietro Gonzaga, who had begun his career as a set designer at the La Scala Theater in Milan. Gonzaga always remained a theater designer; he designed the funeral procession of Catherine the Great, Paul I, and Alexander I. as well as the Coronations of Paul I, Alexander I and Nicholas I. For Cameron he painted landscape scenes of the Pavlovsk Park on the walls and ceilings of rooms of the Palace, and he designed spectacular sets for the 1814 ceremony at Pavlovsk welcoming Alexander I home after his victory over Napoleon. Gonzaga planned the landscape of Pavlovsk Park with meticulous care, marking the trees to be saved or cut down. He laid out paths and changed contours to create the effects he wanted, using open and closed spaces and different colors and shapes of trees to make theatrical scenes. He made dramatic use of the contrast between the white bark and light leaves of birch trees and the dark needles of red-brown trunks of pine trees, setting groups of birch trees in front of dark backgrounds of pines. He made decorative use of the different seasons in the park, painting scenes with brilliant colors of the autumn leaves. Gonzaga was the architect of Pavlovsk Park until his death in 1831 at the age of eighty.Massie, p. 92 NotesBibliography *Orloff, Alexandre and Chvidkovski, Dimitri, Saint-Petersbourg- l'architecture des tsars, Editions Place des Victoires, Paris 1995, translated from Russian to French by Brigitte de Monclos, *Massie, Suzanne, Pavlovsk: The Life of a Russian Palace, Hodder & Stoughton, 1990; .

Astronauts would have used the spacecraft for landings on the Moon, which was intended to begin around 2019. The Altair spacecraft was planned to be used both for lunar sortie and lunar outpost missions. On February 1, 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama announced a proposal to cancel the Constellation program (except the Orion spacecraft), to be replaced with a re-scoped program, effective with the U.S. 2011 fiscal year budget.http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/420990main_FY_201_%20Budget_Overview_1_Feb_2010.pdf  Name  On December 13, 2007, NASA's Lunar Surface Access Module was retitled \\"Altair\\", after the 12th brightest star in the northern hemisphere's night sky, Altair in the constellation Aquila. In Latin, means \\"eagle\\", providing a connection to the first crewed lunar landing, Apollo 11's Eagle; the name Altair itself is a latinization of the Arabic , meaning \\"the eagle,\\" \\"the bird,\\" or \\"the flyer.\\" Prior to the announcement of the \\"Altair\\" name, reports had suggested other names had been considered by NASA, but Altair won in a vote by the design team over Pegasus.  Description  NASA developed only conceptual designs for Altair. No Altair spacecraft were built‚Äîplans called for a first landing on the Moon in 2018. Like the Apollo Lunar Module (LM), Altair was envisioned as having two stages. The descent stage would have housed the astronauts, life-support equipment, and fuel for the ascent-stage motor and steering rockets. Like the Apollo LM, the Altair's crew cabin was based on that of a cylinder. Initially a horizontal cylinder, like that of the LM (despite the \\"boxy\\" appearance on the outside), current blueprints and computer simulations show the use of a vertical cylinder. Unlike its two-man Apollo ancestor, Altair was designed to carry the entire four-person crew to the surface, while the temporarily unoccupied Orion crew module would have remained in lunar orbit. Altair was intended to be capable of operating away from Earth (in space and on the lunar surface) for up to 210 Earth days. Altair would also be capable of flying uncrewed missions, as had been proposed with LM Truck concept during the Apollo Applications Program. Mission planners would have been able to choose among three distinct mission modes for Altair: # Crewed sortie mode # Crewed outpost mode (with no airlock) # Uncrewed cargo mode, capable of transporting up to 15 metric tons to the lunar surface Artist's rendering of Altair being encased in a shroud Altair, like the LM, was planned to have two hatches; one on top for docking and internal transfer between Altair and Orion, and a main hatch for accessing the lunar surface. Unlike the Apollo LM, Altair would have an airlock similar to those on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station between the cabin and main hatch. The airlock allowed the astronauts to don and doff their spacesuits without tracking potentially hazardous moon rocks into the main cabin and allowed the vehicle to retain its internal pressure. Unlike the Apollo LM, in which the entire cabin was depressurized during extra-vehicular activity, the airlock would allow a crew member with a malfunctioning spacesuit to quickly return to the Altair spacecraft without having to terminate the entire EVA, and allowed the landing party to complete most of their tasks during their 7-day lunar stay. Also, the airlock would remain as part of the Altair's descent stage, allowing NASA to utilize the airlock as a component of the Lunar Outpost. Because the Ares V payload shroud was planned to have a diameter of and height of (including landing gear), the landers were designed to retract so as to fit within the Ares V's payload shroud. The spacecraft would also have included an improved miniature camping-style toilet, similar to the unit now used on the ISS and the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, a food warmer to eliminate the \\"cold soup\\" menu used during Apollo missions, a laser- guided distance measurement system (with radar backup), using data acquired by advanced uncrewed lunar orbiting spacecraft, and new \\"glass cockpit\\" and Boeing 787-based computer system identical to that on the Orion spacecraft. = Engines = Cargo variant of Altair Altair intended to utilize current cryogenic technologies for the descent stages and hypergolic technologies for the ascent stage. The Apollo LM, as advanced in both computer and engineering technology in its day, used hypergolic fuels in both of its stages, chemicals that combust on contact with each other, requiring no ignition mechanism and allowing an indefinite storage period. Both the cryogenic and hypergolic systems, like that of the Apollo LM, would be force-fed using high-pressure helium, eliminating the need for malfunction-prone pumps utilized in most rocket technology. Mission requirements obliged the vehicle to be able to descend from an equatorial or high-inclination lunar orbit to a polar landing site, along with bringing it and the Orion spacecraft into lunar orbit, as the Orion spacecraft's onboard Aerojet AJ-10 rocket engine and the amount of fuel it carried would have been insufficient to brake the Orion/Altair stack into lunar orbit (also necessary if flown without Orion for cargo-only missions). The new lander would have been powered by a modified RL-10 engine (currently in use on the upper stage of the Delta IV rocket and Centaur upper stage of the Atlas V rocket), burning liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) for the descent phase. A single AJ-10 rocket engine, like that on the Orion, was intended to power the ascent stage. Originally, NASA wanted to power the ascent stage using LOX and liquid methane (LCH4), RS-18, as future missions to Mars would require the astronauts to live on the planet. The Sabatier Reactor could be used to convert the carbon dioxide (CO2) found on Mars into methane, using either found or transported hydrogen, a catalyst, and a source of heat. Cost overruns and immature LOX/LCH4 rocket technology forced NASA to stick with cryogenic and hypergolic systems, although later variants of Altair were meant to serve as testbeds for methane rockets and Sabatier reactors after a permanent lunar base was established.  On-orbit assembly  Because of the spacecraft's size and weight, Altair, and its associated Earth Departure Stage, would have been launched into a low-Earth orbit (LEO) using the heavy- lift Ares V launch vehicle, followed by a separate launch of an Orion spacecraft lifted by an Ares I. After rendezvous and docking with Altair in LEO, the crew would have then configured the Orion/Altair for the journey to the Moon.  Offices and development  The development of Altair would have been managed by the Constellation Lunar Lander Project Office at Johnson Space Center (JSC). JSC worked directly with Apollo astronauts, various industry suppliers and universities to develop the architecture for Altair. In conjunction with early development a mockup or testbed was to have been developed at JSC to study/develop specialized subsystems and other design considerations. Northrop Grumman, which built the Apollo Lunar Module, was contracted to help the project office develop the system concept.

Born as Julie Wolf(f) to a middle-class Jewish family, she later styled herself as Julie Wolfthorn after her city of birth Thorn (Toru≈Ñ). Life Portrait of Hedda Eulenberg (1901) Wolfthorn was born in Thorn (Toru≈Ñ) in the Prussian Province of Prussia. In 1883, she moved to Berlin to live with her relatives after her parents died. In 1890, she studied in Curt Herrmann's Drawing and Painting School for ladies. Since German art academies would not permit women, she traveled to Paris to study at the Acad√©mie Colarossi and Acad√©mie Julian, where she gained much of the skills needed to become successful. After she finished her studies in Paris, Wolfthorn returned to Berlin. In 1898, she became the co-founder of the Berlin Secession and the \\"Verein der K√ºnstlerinnen und Kunstfreunde Berlin\\" (Association of Artists and Art Lovers Berlin). In 1905, Julie Wolfthorn and over 200 female artists signed a petition to be allowed to join the Prussian Academy of Arts, which was ultimately rejected by the academy director Anton von Werner. With K√§the Kollwitz, she founded the exhibition cooperation \\"Verbindung Bildender K√ºnstlerinnen\\". The two women are elected to directors of the \\"Secession\\" in 1912, but she and Fanny Remak are removed in 1933. Julie Wolfthorn stayed in Berlin, working with the \\"Kulturbund Deutscher Juden\\" (Cultural Association of German Jews) under pressure from the Nazis, which declared it illegal in 1941, arresting the members and seizing the possessions. On October 28, 1942, 78-year-old Julie Wolfthorn and her sister Luise Wolf who, like all other family members except the painter called themselves Wolff or Wolf, were transported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Wolfthorn is said to have continued drawing, as far as possible under the circumstances, until her death on December 26, 1944.

A selection of flutes from around the world A tone hole is an opening in the body of a wind instrument which, when alternately closed and opened, changes the pitch of the sound produced. Tone holes may serve specific purposes, such as a trill hole or register hole. A tone hole is, \\"in wind instruments[,] a hole that may be stopped by the finger, or a key, to change the pitch of the tone produced.\\"William Lines Hubbard, ed. (1908). The American history and encyclopedia of music, Volume 10, p.532. Squire. The resonant frequencies of the air column in a pipe are inversely proportional to the pipe's effective length. In other words, a shorter pipe produces higher notes. For a pipe with no tone holes but open at both ends, the effective length is the physical length of the pipe plus a little more for the small volumes of air just beyond the ends of the pipe that are also involved in the resonance. An open hole anywhere along the middle of the pipe shortens the pipe's effective length and therefore raises the pitch of the notes it produces. The closer an open hole is to the blowing end, the shorter the remaining effective length is and the more it raises the pitch. Generally, a hole in a given position doesn't reduce the effective length quite as much as cutting the pipe at that position would, and the smaller the hole, the less it reduces the effective length when open. Closing the hole increases the effective length and lowers the pitch again. However, a pipe with a closed tone hole is not acoustically identical to a pipe with no hole; the shape of the fingertip or pad that closes the hole modifies the pipe's internal volume and effective length. When there are multiple tone holes, the first (closest to the blowing end) open tone hole usually has the largest influence on the pipe's effective length. However, closing holes below the first open hole without closing the first hole can also lower the pitch significantly; such cross fingerings may often be useful. Generally, the pitch and timbre of the notes produced will depend on the positions, sizes, heights, and shapes of all the tone holes, both open and closed. Theoretical models allow these effects to be calculated with some accuracy, but the design of tone holes remains to some degree a matter of trial and error. Most woodwind instruments rely on tone holes to produce different pitches. Two exceptions are the slide whistle and the overtone flutes. Most brass instruments use valves or a slide instead of tone holes, with the rare keyed bugle and the ophicleide as exceptions.

Melbourne, Tokyo: Australia Asia Foundation, 1998. (hard back); (paperback), page 12.Tran, Van Khe. La Musique Vietnamienne Traditionnelle. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1962. Page 20. Between the late 15th and the 18th centuries, the number of strings of the ƒë√†n tranh increased to fifteen and the instrument was called th·∫≠p ng≈© huy·ªÅn c·∫ßm. In the 19th centuries, the ƒë√†n tranh with 16 strings appeared and had become the standard version until the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Vietnamese dan tranh, like the Japanese koto and Korean gayageum, is ultimately descended from the Chinese guzheng.  Description  The body of the ƒë√†n tranh is between 104 and 120 cm in length. The soundbox consists of a curved top plate, a flat bottom plate, and six side-pieces. The top and bottom plates are usually made of Paulownia wood. The side-pieces as well as the bridges, and tuning pegs and the two small legs are made of hard wood. The movable briges have the shape of the letter V turned upside down, and their sizes varies according to their position: The one for the lowest string is the largest. The higher their position, the smaller their size is. The strings are made of steel and have varying diameters. They are tuned to the pentatonic scale. Performers usually wear picks made of metal, plastic, or tortoise-shell to pluck the strings. The standard version of the ƒë√†n tranh, or the ƒë√†n th·∫≠p l·ª•c had 16 strings and had been used between the nineteenth century and the late 1980s. In the late 1950s, South Vietnamese master musician and instrumental designer Nguy·ªÖn Vƒ©nh B·∫£o (b. 1918) began to design and construct instruments with 17, 19 and 21 strings. By the late 1980s, the 17-stringed ƒë√†n tranh has become the standard version of the instrument used throughout Vietnam. Larger instruments with 22, 24 and 25 strings have also been made in the 1980s and 1990s.  Playing techniques Performers pluck the strings with the right hand and bend the strings with the left hand to create a wide range of microtonal and tonal ornaments. In traditional music, performers use 2 or 3 fingers (thumb and index, or thumb, index and middle fingers) to pluck the strings. In a number of new compositions, as many as four or five fingers may be used to pluck the strings. In these new works, the left hand may also be used to enable the performer to play two simultaneous parts. Sometimes, ƒë√†n tranh will play with bow, the player traditionally bowing the strings to the right of the bridges while the left hand varied pitch and vibrato by pressing the strings on the other side of the bridges.

Biography  The father of Miloje Milojeviƒá, Dimitrije, an apparel merchant, was born in the village Dedina near the town of Kru≈°evac. His last name was in fact ƒêorƒëeviƒá, but according to the custom at the time, he adopted a surname based on his father's first name. Dimitrije Milojeviƒá was rather musically gifted, being self-taught in playing the flute. The mother of Miloje Milojeviƒá, Angelina, was born in Belgrade, in the Matiƒá clerk's family. She was also musically gifted and took private piano lessons. Miloje Milojeviƒá had a sister Vladislava, and brothers Vojislav, Vladislav, Branko, Milorad, and Borivoje, a renowned biologist. Miloje Milojeviƒá began private violin lessons at the age of five, with Karlo Mertl, an orchestra member of the National Theatre in Belgrade. His first piano teacher was his mother, Angelina. His father's sudden death turned the family life upside-down. The changed financial situation made his mother, now a widow, move to Novi Sad where life was more affordable. The Milojeviƒá family lived in Novi Sad for six years. Miloje began his schooling in Novi Sad in his junior year at the Serbian Orthodox High Gymnasium (graduated 1904). This school was well known for its music activities (Svetosavke besede). During his music education, Miloje Milojeviƒá received encouragement from composer Isidor Bajiƒá (1878‚Äì1915), his secondary school music teacher. Milojeviƒá matriculated at the Faculty of Philosophy, University of Belgrade, where he studied for three semesters (fall 1904 until spring 1906): Germanics (Milo≈° Trivunac), comparative literature (Bogdan Popoviƒá), Serbian language and literature (Aleksandar Beliƒá, Pavle Popoviƒá, and Jovan Skerliƒá), and philosophy (Branislav Petronijeviƒá). He concurrently attended Serbian music school (until 1907, and also later), where he studied music theory subjects and composition with Stevan St. Mokranjac and piano with Cvetko Manojloviƒá. For the next five semesters (summer 1907‚Äì08 until summer 1909‚Äì10 academic year), Milojeviƒá continued his studies at the Munich University Philosophy Department, where he studied musicology (with Adolf Sandberger and Theodor Kroyer), literature, and philosophy disciplines. At the same time, Milojeviƒá attended Munich Music Academy, studying composition (with Friedrich Klose), piano (Richard Meier-Gschray), and conducting with score reading (Felix Mottl). He graduated from Munich Music Academy in June 1910. Between 1 September 1910 and 1 March 1911, Milojeviƒá served his military duty for the Kingdom of Serbia, in the student squadron. While in military service, he was appointed a music teacher in the Fourth Belgrade Gymnasium, and the same year also started teaching in the Serbian Music School. In 1912, he founded the Serbian Music School Teachers‚Äô Chamber Society. This event initiated the nurturing of chamber music in Belgrade on a more regular basis. In the fall of 1912, at the onset of the First Balkan War, Milojeviƒá was drafted as a sergeant for the Dunav Division cavalry squadron. Following the outbreak of World War I he was appointed to the Supreme Command headquarters (until 1917). He crossed Albania with the Serbian Army (Serbian army's retreat through Albania). In 1917, Milojeviƒá was in service for the Kingdom of Serbia Ministry of Education, during which he was sent to Paris to the Committee for Cultural Affairs. He remained in France from 1917 until mid 1919. During the entire war, he remained involved with composing; he also performed at concerts of Serbians music in Nice, Monte Carlo, Lyon, and Paris as a piano accompanist, and held a public lecture about modern Serbian music in Paris. In 1919, Milojeviƒá returned to Belgrade and developed an extraordinary rich music career as a composer, musicologist, music critic, folklorist, music pedagogue, conductor, and organizer of music affairs. At first, he returned to his previous teaching positions at the gymnasium and music school. Concurrently, from 1920 until the beginning of 1922 he also held the conductor position with the Academic Singing Society ‚ÄúObiliƒá‚Äù. In fall 1922 he was appointed an Assistant Professor of Music History at the Belgrade University Faculty of Philosophy. Soon afterward he turned to completing his musicology studies and earned his doctorate degree at the Charles University in Prague (1925). Upon returning to Belgrade, he was a Docent and an Associate Professor of Music History until 1939. At the same time, up until 1946 he also taught at the Music School in Belgrade‚Äîpreviously Serbian Music School (principal 1943‚Äì46). In 1939 he became a Professor of composition and theory disciplines at the Music Academy in Belgrade. During World War II Milojeviƒá was arrested (1941) by fascist authorities. During the heavy ‚Äòallied‚Äô bombing of Belgrade by the American forces on Easter Day in 1944, his house on 16 Nemanjina Street in Belgrade was demolished, leaving him wounded. Of a diminished health condition, starting in February 1946, he was no longer able to continue teaching at the Music Academy. After the liberation, as a formality, he was appointed to the Music Academy Institute of Musicology managed at the time by musicologist and pianist Stana ƒêuriƒá-Klajn (now Institute of Musicology of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, SASA). Milojevic died 16 June 1946 in Belgrade. Milojeviƒá was married (from 1907) to a vocalist and music pedagogue Ivanka Milutinoviƒá (1881‚Äì1975). They had one daughter, Gordana (1911‚Äì2003), a pianist and music pedagogue. Nephew ƒêorƒëe (1921‚Äì1986), the son of Borivoje, was a violoncellist and a composer. The grandson of Miloje Milojeviƒá is a composer and member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Vlastimir Trajkoviƒá (1947), Professor of Composition and Orchestration at the Faculty of Music, University of Arts, in Belgrade.  Composer  Together with Petar Konjoviƒá and Stevan Hristiƒá, Miloje Milojeviƒá represented a generation of composers who introduced modern styles and a high compositional technical level to Serbian music. In the beginning phase of his creative development, Milojevic set out from the Serbian Romanticist national school (Stevan Mokranjac and Josif Marinkoviƒá). During his studies in Munich, he discovered German New Romanticism and became closely involved with the music of Richard Strauss. His stay in France resulted with even stronger impressions. The influence of French Impressionism was decisive in Milojeviƒá's stylistic development. While in Prague, working on his dissertation, he made contacts with Czech avant-garde composers. In certain works, Milojeviƒá turned to expressionism. Throughout his life, though, he preserved his affinity toward the national style‚Äîtoward folklore as a foundation of art music. Thus, the last stage of his creative work is characterized by utilizing folk melodies amidst the stylistic blend of Neo-romanticist and Impressionist elements. Miloje Milojeviƒá is predominantly a lyricist and a master of small forms. Two main areas of his work belong to the Lied and piano character piece, but he also significantly contributed to choral and chamber genres. In his Lied, Milojeviƒá used Serbian, Croat, French, German, and Japanese poetry. His interpretation of the lyrics was realized by supple melodies and rich harmonic palette of the piano part. Among his pieces for voice and piano, it is important to note the following: Before the Magnificence of Nature (Pred veliƒçanstvom prirode), a collection of ten songs, was conceived between 1908 and 1920. This song cycle features all the elements representative of Milojeviƒá as a composer of this genre (Serbian romanticist Lied, influences of R. Strauss, and Impressionism). Among the most successful Lieder in this cycle are The Autumn Elegy (Jesenja elegija), The Eagle song (Pesma orla), Japan, The Nymph, and The Bells (Zvona). About fifteen Lieder composed in France in 1917 after the lyrics by French poets were influenced by Impressionism, the most well known among them Berceuse triste (Tu≈æna uspavanka). From his later period, significant are The Three songs for high voice (Tri pesme za visoki glas), the most remarkable being ‚ÄúA very hot day‚Äù from 1924 (‚ÄúVrlo topli dan‚Äù), composed upon German lyrics, and Haikai (Hai-kai), after the poetry of Japanese poet Matsuo Bash≈ç, from 1942. These works merge impressionistic and expressionistic elements. A Field feast (Gozba na livadi), ‚Äúa lyrical symphony for voice and orchestra‚Äù (1939) represents the first example of symphonic Lied in Serbian music. Milojeviƒá also wrote choral music. His activities in this genre encompass simple, unassuming music for children's and youth choirs to complex works. The most significant include: How green is the long field (Dugo se polje zeleni) (1909), a miniature for mixed choir, after the lyrics of Vojislav Iliƒá; dramatic ballad Presentiment (Slutnja) (1912), marked by Neo- romanticist chromaticism and polyphony, and considered among masterpieces of Serbian choral literature; and cycle The Feast of illusions (Pir iluzija) (1924), after poetry of Miroslav Krle≈æa (Evening decorations (Veƒçernje dekoracije), Triptych (Triptih), and Dark gloomy afternoon (Crno sumorno popodne)), a work of modern expression and high technical demands regarding choral texture. Milojeviƒá's most popular choral composition, The Fly and a Mosquito (Muha i komarac) (1930), is a humorous scherzando piece written upon folk text and utilizing tone painting. This effective work is often compared to The Goat-herd (Kozar) by S. Mokranjac. Milojeviƒá also wrote sacred music (two liturgies, three opelos (Orthodox Requiem), a particularly successful piece being A Short Opelo in b-flat minor (Kratko Opelo u b-mollu), for men's choir (1920). Miloje Milojeviƒá is one of the most significant Serbian composers of piano music. By their high artistic qualities, his Four piano pieces (ƒåetiri komada za klavir) (1917), marked a shift in the history of Serbian piano music. His highly successful collections Cameos (Kameje) (1937‚Äì42) and My mother (Moja majka) (1943) are characterized by the synergy of Neo-romanticism and Impressionism. His cycles entitled Melodies and rhythms from the Balkans (Melodije i ritmovi sa Balkana), The Kosovo suite (Kosovska svita), and The Povardarie suite (Povardarska svita) (all from 1942), are all based on folklore and Milojeviƒá's own folk transcriptions. These works feature impressionistic solutions, but also a somewhat robust use of folklore similar to B√©la Bart√≥k. His work Rhythmical grimaces (Ritmiƒçke grimase) (1935), a stride toward Expressionism, occupies a special place in his oeuvre, whereas the piano is treated in a somewhat percussionist way, certain places are void of meter markings, and the harmonic aspect is characterized by the departure from tonality and use of tone clusters. Milojeviƒá was less prolific in the genre of orchestral music. Among his orchestral compositions is The Death of the Jugoviƒá mother (Smrt majke Jugoviƒáa) (1921), with glimpses of R. Strauss's influences. This work somewhat exhibits insufficiencies in the aspects of thematic development and orchestral sound. His suite for string orchestra, Intimacy (Intima) (1939), built on the re-la-do-mi-la motive, deems far more successful. While featuring six movements and several moods (depicted by the subtitles), this composition demonstrates coherency and rich sound colour. Miloje Milojeviƒá wrote a number of chamber works. He composed two string quartets (in G-major, 1905 and in c-minor, 1906), the G-major quartet being the first work of this genre in Serbian music. He also composed two sonatas for violin and piano (in b-minor, 1924 and in d-minor 1943), Sonata for flute and piano in f-sharp minor (1944) and Sonata in g for viola solo (1944). The most substantial among these works is Sonata for violin and piano in b-minor, a piece of sturdy structure and great expressivity ranging from discrete lyricism to passionate drama. One of Milojeviƒá's most distinct works belongs to stage music ‚Äî Le balai du valet (Sobareva metla) (1923), a ballett grotesque upon a surrealist text by Marko Ristiƒá. Miloje Milojeviƒá is represented in the Anthology of Serbian piano music (vol. 1, no. 1, selection by Dejan Despiƒá, Vlastimir Periƒçiƒá, Du≈°an Trbojeviƒá, and Marija Kovaƒç; editing: Vlastimir Trajkoviƒá; Belgrade: Composers‚Äô Association of Serbia, CAS, 2005, pp. 30‚Äì96), with Four piano pieces, op. 23, Cameos, impressions for piano, op. 51, and Visions, op. 65.

His dissertation, defended at the Charles University in Prague and entitled Smetana‚Äôs harmonic style addressed issues of systematic musicology (Belgrade: Grafiƒçki Institut ‚ÄúNarodna misao,‚Äù A. D, 1926). His monograph Smetana‚Äîlife and works, a pioneer work in thematic and genre terms in Serbian musicology, occupies a notable place among his musicological studies (Belgrade: S. B. Cvijanoviƒá, 1924). In his study entitled Music and Orthodox Church (Muzika i Pravoslavna crkva), he opened up the research of Serbian church music toward comparative disciplines such as music Byzantology and Oriental studies (Sremski Karlovci: ‚ÄúAn annual and calendar of Serbian Orthodox Patriarchy for simple 1933,‚Äù 1932, pp. 115‚Äì135). His pedagogical work in musicology was also very important. He taught history and theory of music at the Belgrade University School of Philosophy from 1922‚Äì39 (Assistant Professor since 1922, Docent since 1927, and Associate Professor since 1934). These were the pioneering and until present day the only lectures in those disciplines at that institution. Milojeviƒá did not hold an independent office; his courses belonged to the Department for Classical Archeology and Art History, and then Department for Comparative Literature and Literature Theory, and finally the Department for Serbian Literature. Music history was at the time studied as a minor course at the departments for general history, and comparative literature and literature theory. Attempts to open a musicology department were not materialized. By the act of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Education Minister, on 4 April 1930 a Seminar for Musicology was founded at the School of Philosophy and Milojeviƒá became its first director. However, the degree granting possibility in musicology has never existed at the School where Miloje Milojeviƒá worked. Milojeviƒá's university courses were thematically and chronologically rather diverse and attracted a large number of attendants. He was an extraordinary speaker and lecturer. The Belgrade Faculty of Music Library stores his unfinished textbook on music history. This was the first comprehensive work on music history by a Serbian author since the textbook entitled A History of Music (1921) by Ljubomir Bo≈°njakoviƒá. Another voluminous material in manuscript form, A History of Music by Bo≈æidar Joksimoviƒá, completed in 1926 (400 pages), still unpublished is kept at the Archives of the SASA Institute of Musicology in Belgrade. Miloje Milojeviƒá was also a Serbian music critic and essayist of the first half of the 20th century, and one among the most significant music critics and writers in the history of Serbian music. He published over a thousand critiques, studies, essays, treatises, reviews, obituaries and notes in a large number of various daily papers, and literary and other periodicals. He was a music critic of the most relevant Serbian literary periodical during the first half of the 20th century, the ‚ÄúSerbian Literary Herald,‚Äù from 1908‚Äì41. He was also a music critic for ‚ÄúPolitika,‚Äù the most influential daily paper in Serbia, from 1921‚Äì41. The significance of his writings on music is multifold. In his essays and critiques, he provided for Serbian and Yugoslav audiences critical information about a number or events, personalities, phenomena, and issues on older and newer European music. A luminary and communicator of art music and its history, Milojeviƒá exceeded his duties of a disseminator of knowledge and information, and in his writings always presented a certain critical position. In his numerous evaluations of national composers‚Äô contemporary output, he offered objective assessments, later largely adopted in Serbian musicology. A passionate proponent of the Slavophil and Yugoslav ideology, he nonetheless did not allow ideology to rule over aesthetics. Thus, the autonomy of art and primacy of aesthetic values were never questioned in his writings. His breadth of education, exceptional awareness of developments in European music, including the avant-garde, and knowledge of German, French, Czech, and English musicology literature, enabled Milojeviƒá to exercise an ardent, invigorating writing style, without neglecting factual and expertise layers in his writings. The Serbian postwar musicology did not approvingly view the stylistic aspect of his writings. Consequently, after his death, he was to a degree, and certainly unjustifiably underrated, and his writings were by all means insufficiently read. That was in any way, also the case in the relationship of Serbian postwar musicology toward the history of writing about music, as a branch of research and exploration in musicology. This discipline was deeply overshadowed by composition analysis, the priority of our musicology at the time. Only recently, primarily in the works by Roksanda Pejoviƒá, Slobodan Turlakov, and Aleksandar Vasiƒá, are the writings of Miloje Milojeviƒá being thoroughly examined and undertaking work on his bibliography and minute analysis of his texts being suggested. In Milojeviƒá's writings, noticeable is a friction between tradition and innovation, most apparent in his writings on contemporary music. His views on contemporary music were not straightforward, but rather vacillating, particularly in accepting radical avant-garde practices. At the same time, he did not withhold from his audience information on events he personally did not endorse. A worthy example was his as early as 1912 text on Arnold Schoenberg in the ‚ÄúSerbian Literary Herald.‚Äù He, however remained faithful to the ideas of national style in music and modernized music Romanticism. Milojeviƒá was also one of the editors of periodical the ‚ÄúMusic‚Äù (Belgrade, January 1928 ‚Äì March 1929). Among the most superior music periodicals in Serbia and Yugoslavia prior to World War I, the ‚ÄúMusic‚Äù had a decisive role in critical presentation of European music to the internal readers‚Äô audience. This was especially corroborated by thematic volumes dedicated to Czech music, Franz Schubert, achievements of Polish and English music, and Ludwig van Beethoven. ‚ÄúMusic‚Äù offered discussions on national style, and critically recorded events in Yugoslav, Slavic, and Western European art music cultures. During the interwar period, Milojeviƒá's textbook on the basics of music theory (Basics of musical art I‚ÄìII, 1922‚Äì27; later under a new title The Basic theory of music, thirteen editions, until 1940) was in use for a long time, as well as his handout course package in harmony, assembled from the well known textbook entitled The Study of Harmony (Harmonielehre) by Rudolf Luis and Ludwig Thuille. Milojeviƒá translated opera librettos for Eugene Onegin by A. S. Pushkin/P. I. Tchaikovsky (1920), The Tales of Hoffman by Jules Barbie ‚Äì –úichel Carr√©/Jacques Offenbach (1921), and Manon by Henry Meilhak ‚Äì Philippe Jules/Jules Massenet (1924). The selected writings of Miloje Milojeviƒá were published in three volumes entitled Music studies and essays (Belgrade: G√©za Kohn (Geca Kon) publishing, I, 1926; II, 1933; Belgrade: edited by Gordana Trajkoviƒá-Milojeviƒá, author's publication, III, 1953). Milojeviƒá's treatise The Artistic ideology of Stevan St. Mokranjac, published in 1938 in the ‚ÄúSerbian Literary Herald‚Äù is included in the anthology of Serbian music essayism entitled Essays on Art, edited by Jovan ƒÜirilov (drama), Stana ƒêuriƒá-Klajn (music), and Lazar Trifunoviƒá (visual arts), published in 1966 (pp. 251‚Äì262). In 1925‚Äì26 together with the group of University faculty, Milojeviƒá founded a University chamber music association ‚ÄúCollegium musicum‚Äù that played a major role in Belgrade interwar life. Between 21 April 1926 and 15 March 1940, ‚ÄúCollegium musicum‚Äù held sixty-seven concerts and performed 417 compositions ranging from Baroque and Rococo pieces to the works of Paul Hindemith and Igor Stravinsky. Milojeviƒá took part in these concerts as an organizer, lecturer, conductor, and piano accompanist. Within the auspices of the association, he started and edited sheet music publishing, an activity of extraordinary importance. Beside Milojeviƒá's compositions, ‚ÄúCollegium musicum‚Äù published a number of works by Serbian, Slovenian, and Croatian composers (chronologically): Predrag Milo≈°eviƒá, Slavko Osterc, Lucijan Marija ≈†kerjanc, Anton Neffat, Jakov Gotovac, Petar Konjoviƒá, Bo≈æidar Sirola, Milenko ≈Ωivkoviƒá, Bogomir-Bogo Leskovac, and Vojislav Vuƒçkoviƒá. In regard to such endeavor, Konjoviƒá remarked: ‚ÄúThrough the activities of Miloje Milojeviƒá, ‚ÄòCollegium musicum‚Äô by its selections, editorship, print and technical appearance, represented a big step toward Europization of Serbian and Yugoslav music culture‚Äù (compare with P. Konjoviƒá, Miloje Milojeviƒá, composer and music writer, Belgrade: SASA, 1954, 177). Milojeviƒá was a regular piano accompanist at concerts of his wife, the first Serbian concert singer, Ivanka Milojeviƒá. As a folklorist, he explored, transcribed, and interpreted musical folklore of Kosovo and Metohija, Macedonia, and Monte Negro. He produced a number of works in this field and transcribed nearly 900 melodies and dances. He was attracted to folklore, both as a researcher and a composer, thus was also fond of the idea of composing art music upon folk tunes. His folk transcriptions entitled Folk songs and dances from Kosovo and Metohija were published recently, edited by Dragoslav Deviƒá (Belgrade: Zavod za ud≈æbenike‚ÄîKariƒá fondacija, 2004). The music school in Kragujevac bears the name of Miloje Milojeviƒá. His legacy, classified and catalogued is kept in the family archives of Milojeviƒá's grandson, academician Vlastimir Trajkoviƒá, composer and Professor of Composition and Orchestration at the Faculty of Music in Belgrade.

Etymology  The name 'Cuncolim' is derived from the fact that the village was known as 'Kumkumahalli', the place where kumkuma (vermilion) is produced. Geography Cuncolim is located at . It has an average elevation of . History It is a former village, now with a municipal council of its own, in the south Goa sub-district (taluka) of Salcette, India. It is part of the AVC (Assolna-Velim-Cuncolim) network of villages. Historically, there were twelve Vangodds (clans) of Kshatriya Ganvkars (landlords) in the village. Their names, in order of precedence, are as follows: Mhal, Shetcar, Naik, Mangro, Shet, Tombddo, Porob, Sidakalo, Lokakalo, Bandekar, Rounom and Becklo. Cuncolim was the site of recurring Hindu dissent against Portuguese rule, and this village is also known for an early violent protest against the Portuguese, in 1583. Those killed on the Christian side include the so-called 'martyrs of Cuncolim'. The village of Cuncolim was the original site of the famous temple of Shree Shantadurga before this was demolished by the Portuguese in collaboration with the Christian missionaries. The Holy idol of Shree Shantadurga was taken to Fatorpa where the new temple of Shree Shantadurga Cuncolikarin stands today. The annual zatra of the temple happens in December /January where the Utsav which lasts for five days. The chariots depicting scenes of different Hindu mythological events are paraded on each night. On the fifth day the Maha chariot of the Goddess is taken in a procession around the temple which is attended by devotees from all cast and creed from across Goa as well as the neighbouring states. This yatra is also attended by many local Christian families who continue to hold sacred their familial allegiance to the Goddess. During the last days of the Holi festival, the idol of the Goddess is taken back to the original site at Cuncolim thus re-enacting the migration of the Goddess and many Hindu families who fled Salcette to preserve their faith. This marks the famous festival known as the Sontreo (Umbrellas) consisting 12 umbrellas representing 12 vangodds (clans) of Cuncolim. Amongst those Hindu communities that fled Cuncolim in the midst of religious persecution are the Marathas, Kunbis, Gawdas, Daivadnyas and Saraswats.
