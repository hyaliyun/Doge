It stars Maximilian Schell and Rod Steiger. At the 1981 Montr√©al World Film Festival, the film won Grand Prix of the Americas, and Steiger won best actor. Analysis Film Releasing Corp and 20th Century Fox released it in the US in April 1982. Plot The film takes place in Brooklyn, beginning near the conclusion of the Second World War. Reuven Malter is a middle-class Modern Orthodox Jewish teenager, and the son of David Malter, a college professor and dedicated Zionist. At a baseball game between their schools, Reuven meets Danny Saunders, another Jewish teenage boy. At first, the meeting is one of enmity since Danny accidentally injures Reuven's eye during the game; this results in Reuven wearing an eye patch for a good portion of the movie. Danny goes to visit Reuven at the hospital to apologize‚Äîboth boys are surprised to learn that Danny already knows David Malter from the library‚Äîand the teens gradually become friends, despite their differing backgrounds. Danny is the eldest son of a Hasidic Rebbe, the dynastic leader of the Hasidic Jews in that neighborhood. However, Danny is somewhat distant from him. Danny has also been going to the nearby public library and reading books on psychology. He amazes Reuven with his ability to remember word-for-word what he has read. It turns out that David Malter has been showing him these books. Reuven and Danny also go to a Sabbath service in Danny's Hasidic community as Danny is eager for Reuven to meet his father. Danny's father approves of their friendship - however, Rebbe Saunders disapproves of Prof. Malter's writings, which doesn't surprise anyone. Rebbe Saunders also wishes for Danny to become a rabbi and to eventually succeed him in leading his Hasidic community in keeping with the tradition of several generations but Danny doesn't seem very eager to pursue this. Some time later, the boys begin attending Hirsch College, a Jewish university. While Reuven finds college life exciting and challenging, Danny finds it harder to adjust, especially in one of his psychology courses where his professor denounces Sigmund Freud whom Danny was fascinated by. During this time, World War II ends and Reuven takes Danny to his first movie. After the movie, a newsreel begins and broadcasts the horrors of the concentration camps and the genocide of over six million Jews in Europe; Rebbe Saunders is horror-stricken by this too. Shortly after this, the question arises of whether a Jewish state should be formed in Palestine, as many European Jews have emigrated there. This results in Prof. Malter heading to Chicago for a conference to debate the issue and Reuven goes to stay with Danny's family. He meets the rest of the family, including Danny's sister Shaindel, whom he begins to have feelings for. Reuven is eventually accepted by the family and attends many services and ceremonies, including a Hasidic wedding. However, during the reception, Danny gently breaks the news to Reuven that he can't pursue a relationship with Shaindel, because her future marriage has already been arranged. After Prof. Malter returns, he becomes engrossed in the creation of Israel and writes several articles and speeches about it. This controversial issue, however, causes friction between Hasidic and Modern Orthodox Jews. While the Modern Orthodox Jews believe that creating a Jewish state in Palestine is the right thing to do, the Hasidic Jews believe that only the Messiah will grant them Palestine. This results in Rebbe Saunders excommunicating Reuven from the family and thus causes growing friction between Danny and Reuven. Eventually, the United Nations passes a resolution that partitions the Palestine Mandate territory, creating Israel. Rebbe Saunders allows Reuven to come back and the two friends reconcile. It is also revealed that Danny plans to transfer to Columbia University to pursue a psychology degree and Reuven plans to be a rabbi. Rebbe Saunders approves of Danny's plans and finally reveals why he was so distant from Danny: when Danny was younger, his father was impressed by how much Danny remembered when he had read something; however, blessed with this great ability, Danny became a know- it-all who felt indifferent towards other people and their troubles. As a result, Rebbe Saunders had to teach him empathy and the wisdom and pain of being alone by distancing himself from Danny and thus \\"teaching through silence\\", just as Rebbe Saunders' own father had taught him. Rebbe Saunders also tells Danny to keep his Jewish faith. This results in a tearful Danny reconciling with his father. In the end, Danny and his father now have a good relationship again, although Danny changes his appearance, such as shaving his beard, which had been an important part of his Hasidic tradition, and adopting more modern-style clothing rather than the traditional black-colored suits and robes that he had worn up till then. Danny and Reuven part ways as Danny prepares for his new life.

It is used by the Toronto Transit Commission's 939B Finch Express bus route. The busway was constructed in 2009 as part of a series of bus-only roadways and bus lanes stretching from Sheppard West station to York University to serve the 196 York University Rocket bus rapid transit route. After the opening of the Toronto‚ÄìYork Spadina Subway Extension on December 17, 2017, route 196 was discontinued and the other segments of bus infrastructure were repurposed.  History   Planning and construction  Hydro Corridor Busway under construction in August 2009 The busway was proposed in 2004 as a series of busways and bus lanes connecting Downsview Station (now ) to York University, to increase speed and reliability on route 196 York University Rocket. The primary components of the work were a busway within York University, a busway within the Finch Hydro Corridor, and painted bus lanes on Dufferin Street / Allen Road. Groundbreaking occurred on July 25, 2008, with completion planned for the fourth-quarter 2009 school term. During construction, it was discovered that a gas pipeline was closer to the surface than had been thought, so the busway in the hydro corridor had to be redesigned to accommodate it. This caused it to be delayed, and the only part that was open for the fourth-quarter 2009 school term was the busway within York University, which started operation on September 6, 2009. Consequently, route 196 buses continued to use Keele and Sheppard Avenues. The final cost of the busway was $37.8million, of which $18.4million was contributed by the City of Toronto, and $9.7million was contributed each from the Government of Canada and the Province of Ontario.  Initial operation  Viva Orange operating on the York University Busway The York University Busway was officially opened on November 20, 2009, and route 196 was rerouted immediately. Other TTC routes using the busway were rerouted a week later. The busway increased the average speed of route 196 by 41 percent, from , making it the third-fastest TTC route at rush hour, after Line 3 Scarborough and route 192 Airport Rocket. Due to the savings in time from using the busway, service frequency on route 196 was increased from every 2 minutes 15 seconds to every 2 minutes while reducing the number of buses operating on the route from 20 to 16. The 196 York University Rocket operated express from York University to Sheppard West Station, making two intermediate stops on Murray Ross Parkway at Keele Street, and on Dufferin Street at Finch Avenue. Some buses continued beyond Sheppard West Station to Sheppard-Yonge station, operating in mixed traffic along Sheppard Avenue. From north to south, the route of the 196 consisted of: * York University Commons ‚Äì Bus only road and bus terminal: * York Boulevard ‚Äì Mixed traffic (east of Ian Macdonald Boulevard): * \\"busway\\" ‚Äì Dedicated bus only road within York University (Murray Ross Parkway to York Boulevard): * Murray Ross Parkway ‚Äì Mixed traffic (Keele Street to Evelyn Wiggins Drive): * York University Busway ‚Äì Dedicated bus only road within Finch Hydro Corridor (from Dufferin Street to Keele Street): * Allen Road / Dufferin Street ‚Äì Painted bus lanes on arterial road: Total length: ~ In addition to route 196, other TTC routes used portions of the bus infrastructure, including TTC routes 105 Dufferin North, 117 Alness, and 41E Keele Express. On May 1, 2011, York Region Transit's Viva Orange route began using the entire length of the York University Busway infrastructure from York University to Sheppard West. On March 28, 2016, TTC route 199 Finch Rocket was extended westward to York University from its previous terminus at Finch Station as the 199B Finch Rocket. It traveled along the York University Busway from Dufferin Street and Finch Avenue to York University. In early 2010, the \\"busway on hydro corridor\\" was given the official name \\"York University Busway\\". In 2016, the portion of the busway between Keele Street and Tangiers Road was closed and demolished to make way for the parking lot of the new Finch West station. Route 196 was consequently rerouted via Tangiers Road for the remainder of its existence. After Line 1 extension On December 17, 2017, TTC subway Line 1 was extended from Sheppard West station to Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station, including a stop at York University station. As a result, bus route 196 York University Rocket was discontinued. Route 199B Finch Rocket was cut back to Finch West Station and 41E Keele Express was rerouted to Pioneer Village station via Finch West station rather than continuing to York University, and as a result the busway within York University (York Boulevard to Murray Ross Parkway) became disused. In September 2018, route 199B was renamed 939B Finch Express. In November 2018, route 41E was replaced by 941 Keele Express. The bus lanes along Dufferin Street and Allen Road were converted to high- occupancy vehicle lanes in early 2018, as the remaining TTC and YRT bus services were not deemed worthy of a dedicated lane. The portion of busway between York Boulevard and Ian MacDonald Boulevard was closed in mid-2018 to allow the expansion of Seymour Schulich Building. As of 2017, 939B is the only bus route using the busway.  Description  The York University Busway consists of a single lane in each direction with concrete Ontario Tall Wall barriers along the side. At the intersections with Tangiers Road and with Alness Street, traffic signals are equipped with transit signal priority to allow buses to pass through without stopping. To facilitate left turns from the curbside bus lanes on Dufferin Street onto the hydro corridor busway, there is a jughandle controlled by traffic signals. Between Tangiers Road and Alness Street, the busway crosses GO Transit's Barrie line at grade. TTC route 939B Finch Express uses the entire York University Busway from Dufferin Street to Finch West station. But eastbound service from Finch West station exits the busway at Alness Street to head south to Finch Avenue in advance of Dufferin Street. As a result, the busway between Dufferin Street and Alness Street is only used in the westbound direction. Subway shuttle buses use the busway during scheduled weekend closures.

Some effects constitute feedback mechanisms that intensify climate change and move it toward climate tipping points. Climate change feedback is important in the understanding of global warming because feedback processes may amplify or diminish the effect of each climate forcing, and so play an important part in determining the climate sensitivity and future climate state. Feedback in general is the process in which changing one quantity changes a second quantity, and the change in the second quantity in turn changes the first. Positive (or reinforcing) feedback amplifies the change in the first quantity while negative (or balancing) feedback reduces it. The term \\"forcing\\" means a change which may \\"push\\" the climate system in the direction of warming or cooling. , p.9. Also available as PDF An example of a climate forcing is increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. By definition, forcings are external to the climate system while feedbacks are internal; in essence, feedbacks represent the internal processes of the system. Some feedbacks may act in relative isolation to the rest of the climate system; others may be tightly coupled; hence it may be difficult to tell just how much a particular process contributes. Forcing can also be driven by socioeconomic factors such as \\"demand for biofuels or demand for soy bean production.\\" These drivers work as forcing mechanisms by the direct and indirect effects they cause from an individual to a global scale. Forcings and feedbacks together determine how much and how fast the climate changes. The main positive feedback in global warming is the tendency of warming to increase the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, which in turn leads to further warming. The main negative feedback comes from the Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law, the amount of heat radiated from the Earth into space changes with the fourth power of the temperature of Earth's surface and atmosphere. Observations and modelling studies indicate that there is a net positive feedback to warming. Large positive feedbacks can lead to effects that are abrupt or irreversible, depending upon the rate and magnitude of the climate change.  Positive  Carbon cycle feedbacks There have been predictions, and some evidence, that global warming might cause loss of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems, leading to an increase of atmospheric levels. Several climate models indicate that global warming through the 21st century could be accelerated by the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to such warming. All 11 models in the C4MIP study found that a larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO2 levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1¬∞ and 1.5 ¬∞C. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean. The strongest feedbacks in these cases are due to increased respiration of carbon from soils throughout the high latitude boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere. One model in particular (HadCM3) indicates a secondary carbon cycle feedback due to the loss of much of the Amazon Rainforest in response to significantly reduced precipitation over tropical South America. While models disagree on the strength of any terrestrial carbon cycle feedback, they each suggest any such feedback would accelerate global warming. Observations show that soils in the U.K have been losing carbon at the rate of four million tonnes a year for the past 25 years according to a paper in Nature by Bellamy et al. in September 2005, who note that these results are unlikely to be explained by land use changes. Results such as this rely on a dense sampling network and thus are not available on a global scale. Extrapolating to all of the United Kingdom, they estimate annual losses of 13 million tons per year. This is as much as the annual reductions in carbon dioxide emissions achieved by the UK under the Kyoto Treaty (12.7 million tons of carbon per year). It has also been suggested (by Chris Freeman) that the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peat bogs into water courses (from which it would in turn enter the atmosphere) constitutes a positive feedback for global warming. The carbon currently stored in peatlands (390‚Äì455 gigatonnes, one-third of the total land-based carbon store) is over half the amount of carbon already in the atmosphere. DOC levels in water courses are observably rising; Freeman's hypothesis is that, not elevated temperatures, but elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 are responsible, through stimulation of primary productivity. Tree deaths are believed to be increasing as a result of climate change, which is a positive feedback effect. Methane climate feedbacks in natural ecosystems. Wetlands and freshwater ecosystems are predicted to be the largest potential contributor to a global methane climate feedback. Long-term warming changes the balance in the methane-related microbial community within freshwater ecosystems so they produce more methane while proportionately less is oxidised to carbon dioxide.  Arctic methane release  Photo shows what appears to be permafrost thaw ponds in Hudson Bay, Canada, near Greenland. (2008) Global warming will increase permafrost and peatland thaw, which can result in collapse of plateau surfaces. Warming is also the triggering variable for the release of carbon (potentially as methane) in the arctic. Methane released from thawing permafrost such as the frozen peat bogs in Siberia, and from methane clathrate on the sea floor, creates a positive feedback. In April 2019, Turetsky et al. reported permafrost was thawing quicker than predicted. =Thawing permafrost peat bogs= Western Siberia is the world's largest peat bog, a one million square kilometer region of permafrost peat bog that was formed 11,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age. The melting of its permafrost is likely to lead to the release, over decades, of large quantities of methane. As much as 70,000 million tonnes of methane, an extremely effective greenhouse gas, might be released over the next few decades, creating an additional source of greenhouse gas emissions. Similar melting has been observed in eastern Siberia. Lawrence et al. (2008) suggest that a rapid melting of Arctic sea ice may start a feedback loop that rapidly melts Arctic permafrost, triggering further warming. May 31, 2010. NASA published that globally \\"Greenhouse gases are escaping the permafrost and entering the atmosphere at an increasing rate - up to 50 billion tons each year of methane, for example - due to a global thawing trend. This is particularly troublesome because methane heats the atmosphere with 25 times the efficiency of carbon dioxide\\" (the equivalent of 1250 billion tons of CO2 per year). In 2019, a report called \\" Arctic report card \\" estimated the current greenhouse gas emissions from Arctic permafrost as almost equal to the emissions of Russia or Japan or less than 10% of the global emissions from fossil fuels. =Hydrates= Methane clathrate, also called methane hydrate, is a form of water ice that contains a large amount of methane within its crystal structure. Extremely large deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the sea and ocean floors of Earth. The sudden release of large amounts of natural gas from methane clathrate deposits, in a runaway global warming event, has been hypothesized as a cause of past and possibly future climate changes. The release of this trapped methane is a potential major outcome of a rise in temperature; it is thought that this might increase the global temperature by an additional 5¬∞ in itself, as methane is much more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The theory also predicts this will greatly affect available oxygen content of the atmosphere. This theory has been proposed to explain the most severe mass extinction event on earth known as the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event, and also the Paleocene- Eocene Thermal Maximum climate change event. In 2008, a research expedition for the American Geophysical Union detected levels of methane up to 100 times above normal in the Siberian Arctic, likely being released by methane clathrates being released by holes in a frozen 'lid' of seabed permafrost, around the outfall of the Lena River and the area between the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea. In 2020, the first leak of methane from the sea floor in Antarctica was discovered. The scientists are not sure what caused it. The area where it was found had not warmed yet significantly. It is on the side of a volcano, but it seems that it is not from there. The methane - eating microbes, eat the methane much fewer that was supposed, and the researchers think this should be included in climate models. They also claim that there is much more to discover about the issue in Antarctica Quart of the marine methane is found in the region of Antarctica Abrupt increases in atmospheric methane Literature assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the US Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) have considered the possibility of future projected climate change leading to a rapid increase in atmospheric methane. The IPCC Third Assessment Report, published in 2001, looked at possible rapid increases in methane due either to reductions in the atmospheric chemical sink or from the release of buried methane reservoirs. In both cases, it was judged that such a release would be \\"exceptionally unlikely\\" (less than a 1% chance, based on expert judgement). The CCSP assessment, published in 2008, concluded that an abrupt release of methane into the atmosphere appeared \\"very unlikely\\" (less than 10% probability, based on expert judgement). The CCSP assessment, however, noted that climate change would \\"very likely\\" (greater than 90% probability, based on expert judgement) accelerate the pace of persistent emissions from both hydrate sources and wetlands. On 10 June 2019 Louise M. Farquharson and her team reported that their 12-year study into Canadian permafrost had \\"Observed maximum thaw depths at our sites are already exceeding those projected to occur by 2090. Between 1990 and 2016, an increase of up to 4 ¬∞C has been observed in terrestrial permafrost and this trend is expected to continue as Arctic mean annual air temperatures increase at a rate twice that of lower latitudes.\\" Determining the extent of new thermokarst development is difficult, but there is little doubt the problem is widespread. Farquharson and her team guess that about 231,000 square miles (600,000 square kilometers) of permafrost, or about 5.5% of the zone that is permafrost year-round, is vulnerable to rapid surface thawing.  Decomposition  Organic matter stored in permafrost generates heat as it decomposes in response to the permafrost melting. As the tropics get wetter, as many climate models predict, soils are likely to experience greater rates of respiration and decomposition, limiting the carbon storage abilities of tropical soils.  Peat decomposition  Peat, occurring naturally in peat bogs, is a store of carbon significant on a global scale. When peat dries it decomposes, and may additionally burn. Water table adjustment due to global warming may cause significant excursions of carbon from peat bogs. This may be released as methane, which can exacerbate the feedback effect, due to its high global warming potential.  Rainforest drying  Rainforests, most notably tropical rainforests, are particularly vulnerable to global warming. There are a number of effects which may occur, but two are particularly concerning. Firstly, the drier vegetation may cause total collapse of the rainforest ecosystem. For example, the Amazon rainforest would tend to be replaced by caatinga ecosystems. Further, even tropical rainforests ecosystems which do not collapse entirely may lose significant proportions of their stored carbon as a result of drying, due to changes in vegetation. Forest fires The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report predicts that many mid-latitude regions, such as Mediterranean Europe, will experience decreased rainfall and an increased risk of drought, which in turn would allow forest fires to occur on larger scale, and more regularly. This releases more stored carbon into the atmosphere than the carbon cycle can naturally re-absorb, as well as reducing the overall forest area on the planet, creating a positive feedback loop. Part of that feedback loop is more rapid growth of replacement forests and a northward migration of forests as northern latitudes become more suitable climates for sustaining forests. There is a question of whether the burning of renewable fuels such as forests should be counted as contributing to global warming. Cook & Vizy also found that forest fires were likely in the Amazon Rainforest, eventually resulting in a transition to Caatinga vegetation in the Eastern Amazon region. Desertification Desertification is a consequence of global warming in some environments. Desert soils contain little humus, and support little vegetation. As a result, transition to desert ecosystems is typically associated with excursions of carbon. Modelling results The global warming projections contained in the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) include carbon cycle feedbacks. , in Authors of AR4, however, noted that scientific understanding of carbon cycle feedbacks was poor., in . Projections in AR4 were based on a range of greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, and suggested warming between the late 20th and late 21st century of 1.1 to 6.4 ¬∞C. This is the \\"likely\\" range (greater than 66% probability), based on the expert judgement of the IPCC's authors. Authors noted that the lower end of the \\"likely\\" range appeared to be better constrained than the upper end of the \\"likely\\" range, in part due to carbon cycle feedbacks. The American Meteorological Society has commented that more research is needed to model the effects of carbon cycle feedbacks in climate change projections. Isaken et al. (2010) considered how future methane release from the Arctic might contribute to global warming. Their study suggested that if global methane emissions were to increase by a factor of 2.5 to 5.2 above (then) current emissions, the indirect contribution to radiative forcing would be about 250% and 400% respectively, of the forcing that can be directly attributed to methane. This amplification of methane warming is due to projected changes in atmospheric chemistry. Schaefer et al. (2011) considered how carbon released from permafrost might contribute to global warming. Their study projected changes in permafrost based on a medium greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SRES A1B). According to the study, by 2200, the permafrost feedback might contribute 190 (+/- 64) gigatons of carbon cumulatively to the atmosphere. Schaefer et al. (2011) commented that this estimate may be low. =Implications for climate policy= Uncertainty over climate change feedbacks has implications for climate policy. For instance, uncertainty over carbon cycle feedbacks may affect targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. , in Emissions targets are often based on a target stabilization level of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, or on a target for limiting global warming to a particular magnitude. Both of these targets (concentrations or temperatures) require an understanding of future changes in the carbon cycle. If models incorrectly project future changes in the carbon cycle, then concentration or temperature targets could be missed. For example, if models underestimate the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere due to positive feedbacks (e.g., due to melting permafrost), then they may also underestimate the extent of emissions reductions necessary to meet a concentration or temperature target.  Cloud feedback  Warming is expected to change the distribution and type of clouds. Seen from below, clouds emit infrared radiation back to the surface, and so exert a warming effect; seen from above, clouds reflect sunlight and emit infrared radiation to space, and so exert a cooling effect. Whether the net effect is warming or cooling depends on details such as the type and altitude of the cloud. Low clouds tend to trap more heat at the surface and therefore have a positive feedback, while high clouds normally reflect more sunlight from the top so they have a negative feedback. These details were poorly observed before the advent of satellite data and are difficult to represent in climate models. Global climate models were showing a near-zero to moderately strong positive net cloud feedback, but the effective climate sensitivity has increased substantially in the latest generation of global climate models. Differences in the physical representation of clouds in models drive this enhanced climate sensitivity relative to the previous generation of models. A 2019 simulation predicts that if greenhouse gases reach three times the current level of atmospheric carbon dioxide that stratocumulus clouds could abruptly disperse, contributing to additional global warming.  Gas release  Release of gases of biological origin may be affected by global warming, but research into such effects is at an early stage. Some of these gases, such as nitrous oxide released from peat or thawing permafrost, directly affect climate. Others, such as dimethyl sulfide released from oceans, have indirect effects.  Ice-albedo feedback  Aerial photograph showing a section of sea ice. The lighter blue areas are melt ponds and the darkest areas are open water, both have a lower albedo than the white sea ice. The melting ice contributes to ice-albedo feedback. When ice melts, land or open water takes its place. Both land and open water are on average less reflective than ice and thus absorb more solar radiation. This causes more warming, which in turn causes more melting, and this cycle continues. During times of global cooling, additional ice increases the reflectivity which reduces the absorption of solar radiation which results in more cooling in a continuing cycle. Considered a faster feedback mechanism.Hansen, J., \\"2008: Tipping point: Perspective of a climatologist.\\" , Wildlife Conservation Society/Island Press, 2008. Retrieved 2010. sea ice extent in million square kilometers. Blue shading indicates the pre-satellite era; data then is less reliable. In particular, the near-constant level extent in Autumn up to 1940 reflects lack of data rather than a real lack of variation. Albedo change is also the main reason why IPCC predict polar temperatures in the northern hemisphere to rise up to twice as much as those of the rest of the world, in a process known as polar amplification. In September 2007, the Arctic sea ice area reached about half the size of the average summer minimum area between 1979 and 2000.. Also in September 2007, Arctic sea ice retreated far enough for the Northwest Passage to become navigable to shipping for the first time in recorded history. The record losses of 2007 and 2008 may, however, be temporary. Mark Serreze of the US National Snow and Ice Data Center views 2030 as a \\"reasonable estimate\\" for when the summertime Arctic ice cap might be ice- free. The polar amplification of global warming is not predicted to occur in the southern hemisphere. The Antarctic sea ice reached its greatest extent on record since the beginning of observation in 1979, but the gain in ice in the south is exceeded by the loss in the north. The trend for global sea ice, northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere combined is clearly a decline. Ice loss may have internal feedback processes, as melting of ice over land can cause eustatic sea level rise, potentially causing instability of ice shelves and inundating coastal ice masses, such as glacier tongues. Further, a potential feedback cycle exists due to earthquakes caused by isostatic rebound further destabilising ice shelves, glaciers and ice caps. The ice-albedo in some sub-arctic forests is also changing, as stands of larch (which shed their needles in winter, allowing sunlight to reflect off the snow in spring and fall) are being replaced by spruce trees (which retain their dark needles all year).  Water vapor feedback  If the atmospheres are warmed, the saturation vapor pressure increases, and the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere will tend to increase. Since water vapor is a greenhouse gas, the increase in water vapor content makes the atmosphere warm further; this warming causes the atmosphere to hold still more water vapor (a positive feedback), and so on until other processes stop the feedback loop. The result is a much larger greenhouse effect than that due to CO2 alone. Although this feedback process causes an increase in the absolute moisture content of the air, the relative humidity stays nearly constant or even decreases slightly because the air is warmer. Climate models incorporate this feedback. Water vapor feedback is strongly positive, with most evidence supporting a magnitude of 1.5 to 2.0 W/m2/K, sufficient to roughly double the warming that would otherwise occur. Water vapor feedback is considered a faster feedback mechanism.  Negative   Blackbody radiation  As the temperature of a black body increases, the emission of infrared radiation back into space increases with the fourth power of its absolute temperature according to Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law. This increases the amount of outgoing radiation as the Earth warms. The impact of this negative feedback effect is included in global climate models summarized by the IPCC. This is also called the Planck feedback. Carbon cycle  Le Chatelier's principle  Following Le Chatelier's principle, the chemical equilibrium of the Earth's carbon cycle will shift in response to anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The primary driver of this is the ocean, which absorbs anthropogenic CO2 via the so-called solubility pump. At present this accounts for only about one third of the current emissions, but ultimately most (~75%) of the CO2 emitted by human activities will dissolve in the ocean over a period of centuries: \\"A better approximation of the lifetime of fossil fuel CO2 for public discussion might be 300 years, plus 25% that lasts forever\\". However, the rate at which the ocean will take it up in the future is less certain, and will be affected by stratification induced by warming and, potentially, changes in the ocean's thermohaline circulation.  Chemical weathering  Chemical weathering over the geological long term acts to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. With current global warming, weathering is increasing, demonstrating significant feedbacks between climate and Earth surface. Biosequestration also captures and stores CO2 by biological processes. The formation of shells by organisms in the ocean, over a very long time, removes CO2 from the oceans. The complete conversion of CO2 to limestone takes thousands to hundreds of thousands of years.  Net primary productivity  Net primary productivity changes in response to increased CO2, as plants photosynthesis increased in response to increasing concentrations. However, this effect is swamped by other changes in the biosphere due to global warming.  Lapse rate  The atmosphere's temperature decreases with height in the troposphere. Since emission of infrared radiation varies with temperature, longwave radiation escaping to space from the relatively cold upper atmosphere is less than that emitted toward the ground from the lower atmosphere. Thus, the strength of the greenhouse effect depends on the atmosphere's rate of temperature decrease with height. Both theory and climate models indicate that global warming will reduce the rate of temperature decrease with height, producing a negative lapse rate feedback that weakens the greenhouse effect. Measurements of the rate of temperature change with height are very sensitive to small errors in observations, making it difficult to establish whether the models agree with observations. Feedback loops from the book Al Gore (2006). An inconvenient truth.  Impacts on humans  The graphic at right suggests that the overall effect of climate change upon human numbers and development will be negative.Gore, Al (2006). An inconvenient truth: the planetary emergency of global warming and what we can do about it. Emmaus, Pa., Melcher Media and Rodale Press. If this is so, then the century-scale prospects for climate change is that Earth's biosphere may adjust to a new, but radically different, equilibrium if large numbers of humans cannot survive future conditions.

At the 2007 Winter Universiade, he won all five short track speed skating events. Sung has won more than 20 World Cup races and earned two World Cup titles, in addition to skating on the winning World Championship 5000 m relay teams in 2007 and 2008. He qualified for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Sung was in medal contention leading into the final lap of the 1500 m event there, when a crash between him and a teammate led to his finishing in 5th place. Career Sung began speedskating in elementary school at the behest of his parents, who hoped that it would help make him stronger. He nearly gave up the sport in order to continue his schooling, but chose to continue training as a professional speedskater. Sung's career in the short track speed skating world cup has been a successful one. In the 500 m, he took first place in the 2007/2008 season, second in the 2008/2009 season, and third in the 2009/2010 season. In the 1500 m, he was first in 2008/2009 and third in 2009/2010. In total, he has won more than 20 World Cup races. He has also seen some success in World Championships. In 2007 and 2008, he was a member of the world champion 5000 m relay teams. He and his South Korean teammates also won the World Team Championships in 2009, having earned third place the previous year and second in 2007. Sung was selected for the South Korean team at the 2010 Winter Olympics to compete in four events, the 500 m, the 1000 m, the 1500 m, and the 5000 m team relay. In the first of these events, the 1500 m, Sung was among the three leading skaters, all South Koreans, going into the final lap when he was taken out by his teammate Lee Ho-Suk who attempted to pass him and both collided and slid into the wall. The fall allowed Americans Apolo Anton Ohno and J. R. Celski to take silver and bronze. Lee Ho-Suk was disqualified for causing the fall, and Sung who would have gotten silver, finished in 5th place. In the heat race for the 1000 m competition, he set an Olympic Record with a time of 1:24.245. However, disappointingly he didn't advance to the finals as he finished third in the semi-finals. During the pre- finals of 1000 m, he was disqualified from the event for bumping another skater. In the 500m Olympic Final, Sung was in the lead but slipped in the final corner before making contact with Charles Hamelin, and ended up crossing the finish line third. However, he was able to take the Silver medal due to a disqualification of Apolo Ohno.

It is loosely based on The Hunchback of Notre Dame by Victor Hugo. The film co-stars Corey Parker.http://allmovie.com/work/big-man-on-campus-5441 Plot The film opens with a news broadcast on the apparent sighting of a \\"mysterious creature\\" on the UCLA campus. Among those interviewed are underachieving student Alex Kominski (Corey Parker) and his girlfriend Cathy Adams (Melora Hardin). Although neither claim to believe in the creature's existence, a hunchbacked figure (Allan Katz) is shown looking down from the bell tower, spying on Cathy through a telescope. While attending a renaissance-themed carnival on campus, Alex gets involved in a scuffle after insulting another student's girlfriend. When Cathy interjects herself into the fight, the creature suddenly comes to her defense but is chased away by campus security and eventually captured. The creature is brought to trial, where psychiatrist Dr. Victoria Fisk (Jessica Harper) labels him a menace to society. Cathy rejects the doctor's opinion, stating that the creature was only trying to protect her. Another witness, Dr. Richard Webster (Tom Skerritt), the head of the university's Psychology department, suggests it might be possible to rehabilitate the creature. Finally the hunchback himself is called to the stand, where Dr. Fisk asks him who he believes is better qualified to determine his fate, Dr. Webster or herself. Demonstrating that the primitive creature can only repeat the last thing he hears spoken, he predictably answers, \\"Dr. Fisk\\". She then humiliates him by prompting him to describe himself as a \\"complete and total fool\\". Given the evidence, Judge Ferguson (John Finnegan) orders that the hunchback be confined in a mental facility. When Cathy protests, the creature stands and acknowledges both her and the judge by name, leading the judge to overturn his ruling and award temporary custody to the university under the supervision of Dr. Webster, with the condition that should the creature exhibit any violent behavior, he will be institutionalized. Upon being escorted back to the university, the creature shows Alex, Cathy, and Dr. Webster his home in the bell tower, cluttered with various objects scavenged from around campus. Reluctant to leave him alone in the tower, Cathy encourages Alex to stay and watch over him, with Dr. Webster offering to get him special consideration for the task from his instructors at the university. Left with little choice in the matter, Alex agrees. Over the next several days, the hunchback undergoes a series of observational tests, including speech therapy with Dr. Diane Girard (Cindy Williams). Despite his unusual behavior, he learns quickly, and with time he and Alex eventually become friends. During a session with Dr. Webster, the creature is asked to choose his own name. After settling on \\"Bob Maloogaloogaloogaloogalooga\\", he explains that after his father deserted them and his mother died from illness, a group of people came and locked him away. He then managed to escape custody and take up residency in the bell tower. Despite all his progress, Bob remains infatuated with Cathy. While Alex struggles to catch up on his studies in order to pass his finals, Bob strives to better himself in order to win Cathy's affections. But when he suddenly presents her with an engagement ring, Cathy has no choice but to turn him down. Heartbroken, Bob returns to the bell tower where he receives a phone call from Dr. Fisk. Desperate to prove that Bob is a danger to others, she falsely tells him that Cathy was injured in an accident. Bob immediately races across campus to the girls' dormitories, but is confused to find Cathy unharmed. With campus security closing in on him, Bob flees into the streets of Los Angeles. Alex and Cathy and the rest of Bob's supporters then appear on a controversial talk show hosted by Stanley Hoyle (Gerrit Graham), who attempts to demonize Bob in every way possible. When Hoyle states that Alex and the others are \\"in big trouble\\" for supporting the hunchback, Bob, who has been watching the program on television, races to his friends' aid. After taking a taxi to the studio, he makes his way in through the roof and swings down from the catwalk to snatch up Dr. Fisk. Forced to confess her lie in front of everyone, the live audience quickly turns to Bob's side, chanting his name. Stanley Hoyle then apologizes to Bob for his slanderous remarks, and Dr. Webster suggests looking into a scholarship for Bob at the university. When asked by Hoyle if he would have done anything different up to this point, Bob takes Dr. Girard into his arms and kisses her at \\"two speeds\\", a reference to an intimate experience Bob once had with a Hoover vacuum cleaner. Bob then smiles sheepishly into the camera.

Spens began playing cricket whilst at school, and after joining the Army played for Hampshire and the Marylebone Cricket Club in the 1880s. He briefly returned to first-class cricket in 1897‚Äì98, again for Hampshire. During the Second Boer War, he led an infantry battalion and a mobile column, then later commanded a military district in India and a Territorial division in the United Kingdom. He retired shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, when he returned to service, commanding the 12th (Eastern) Division, then a training depot and a military district in Egypt. Early life and sporting career Spens was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College, where he represented the college cricket team from 1868 to 1870.Obituary in Wisden, 1939 Spens was a right-handed batsman who was an underarm bowler, although with which hand he bowled with and what style he bowled is unknown. Spens was commissioned into the 85th Regiment of Foot (Bucks Volunteers) on 29 May 1872. After joining the Army, Spens played both cricket and rackets for Army teams, including a match at Lord's in 1887. He was a high scorer, at one point in 1882 hitting 386 in a match. His cricketing career was interrupted by military duties in 1879‚Äì80, when his regiment served in the Second Anglo-Afghan War,\\"SPENS, Maj.-Gen. James\\", in Who Was Who (2007). Online edition but after his return to England, Spens made his first-class debut for Hampshire against Kent in 1884. On debut, he scored his maiden first-class half century with a score of 60. Two years later Spens made his debut for the Marylebone Cricket Club, making his debut for the club against Derbyshire and playing two more matches against Lancashire and Nottinghamshire. In 1897, fourteen years after playing his last first-class match for Hampshire, Spens returned to county for the 1897 season, playing his first return match against Cambridge University and a second match in the same season against the Gentlemen of Philadelphia, which gave Spens his maiden and only first-class century with a score of 118*. In 1898, Spens played seven first-class matches for Hampshire, with his final first-class match for the county coming against Sussex. Senior command Spens was sent to South Africa following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899. He initially commanded the 2nd Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry, followed by a command of a mobile column in 1901‚Äì1902. He was promoted to the brevet rank of colonel during the war, and mentioned in despatches several times (including by Lord Kitchener on 23 June 1902). After the end of the war in June 1902, he returned to the United Kingdom in the SS Dunottar Castle, which arrived at Southampton the following month. For his service in the war Spens was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the April 1901 South Africa Honours list (the award was backdated to 29 November 1900) and he received the actual decoration from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1902. He was placed on half-pay in August 1902, but was back in full service as commander of the Allahabad District in India in August 1903 and the 21st Bareilly Brigade in India in March 1906. He was given command of the Lowland Division in the Territorial Force in March 1910. He relinquished command and retired from the Army in 1914. On the outbreak of the First World War, however, Spens was recalled to service, and given command of the newly raised 12th (Eastern) Division in the New Armies in August 1914. He commanded it through its training in England, relinquishing command in March 1915 before it was sent overseas, and in April 1915 was appointed to take over command of the ANZAC Training Depot in Egypt. He remained here until November, when he became General Officer Commanding Cairo District. Spens left Cairo in April 1916. He was also a member of the British Fascists.

Reprising their roles from the original series are Nipsey Russell, whose character Anderson is now a captain, and Al Lewis, whose officer Schnauser now spends his time watching TV reruns of The Munsters (in which Lewis and Gwynne also starred). The film was originally produced as a musical comedy but released without the filmed musical interludes. Plot Partnered in Car 54 are the amiable, unreliable Gunther Toody and the prim, proper Francis Muldoon, who wants to know, among other things, if Toody has been helping himself to free kebab from the neighborhood food vendors. As everyone gets on their case, including Dave Anderson, their captain, an assignment comes their way. Toody and Muldoon are told to protect citizen Herbert Hortz, who apparently has incurred the wrath of the local crime godfather, the claustrophobic Don Motti. And while the cops from Car 54 ineptly do their jobs, Toody gets an earful from his wife, Lucille, and is hot and bothered by a woman all their colleagues seem to have already frisked or handcuffed, the vixen Velma Velour.

It served a variety of roles (transport, flak ship, gunboat, convoy escort, minelayer) in the Mediterranean, Baltic and Black Seas as well as along the English Channel. They were developed for Operation Sea Lion in 1940, the cancelled German invasion of England. Siebel ferries continued performing after the war's end in 1945. Origins and development As German Army preparations for Operation Sea Lion got under way in July 1940, frustration soon grew over when and what types of ships the Kriegsmarine would supply for use in the planned Channel crossing. The immense task of converting hundreds of inland river barges and motor coasters into proper landing craft began, and the Kriegsmarine was unable to give the Army a date for their availability.Kieser, p.120 Anxious to begin landing exercises, Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch finally ordered General of Engineers Jacob to build sea-going transports for the army. Jacob assigned this task to Pionier-Battalion 47 of 7th Army Corps. The battalion moved to Carteret on the western side of the Cotentin Peninsula, and the men of this unit searched the French countryside for buoyant materials to construct self-propelled rafts and ferries. Aircraft designer Fritz Siebel (a colonel in the Luftwaffe), putting a captured aircraft plant near Amiens in north-eastern France back into production, was approached by a Lieutenant Colonel from Pionier-Battalion 47. The colonel asked Siebel if he could requisition a large pile of empty gasoline containers discarded outside next to the plant. Siebel agreed to part with the cache, provided the colonel explained what use he would make of them. The answer interested Siebel, and got him pondering the question of how to ferry troops and heavy equipment across the English Channel given the time and materials.Ansel, p.104 Pionier- Battalion 47 began experimenting with a host of makeshift materials for constructing powered rafts, including wine-barrels, tree trunks, kapok-filled sacks, and ship's canvas. Early efforts to use open-ended river-crossing pontoons came to naught. The iron beams and bolts used to hold them together failed to stand up to the waves, and the pontoons were overwhelmed in a light sea.Kieser, p.120‚Äì121 During the evolution, an unknown at OKH (Oberkommando des Heeres) thought of using a larger closed-end bridging pontoon developed during World War I by Austrian Colonel of Engineers Hans Herbert. By spanning two connected pontoons with a deck, guns, vehicles, and troops could be transported. This idea evolved into the Herbert ferry. Only sixty-four of these pontoons available, too few to consider mass-production.Kieser, p.121 Another type of closed-end pontoon was available in greater numbers. This was the heavy pontoon bridge (schwere Schiffsbr√ºcke), of which 364 were in inventory.Schenk, p.120 Colonel Siebel, assigned a Sonderkommando (special command) for improvising Luftwaffe invasion craft, built a prototype with two heavy bridging-pontoons spaced apart in a catamaran arrangement connected by steel cross-beams. In the center, mounted on a pyramid-shaped truss-work, were two end-to-end surplus aircraft engines. This vessel was dubbed the kleine f√§hre (small ferry) and initial testing was conducted on Rangsdorfer See, a lake near Berlin.Ansel, p.209 Chief of the Army General Staff General Franz Halder and a party of other Army officers were invited to witness one of these tests, but they were unimpressed by the ferry's performance. It could only make 4 knots and seemed overly flimsy. Halder noted ‚ÄúNothing new, may not stand up in surf.‚Äù Others in the party questioned whether transported soldiers would arrive in fighting condition. Despite the Army's misgivings, Siebel continued working on modifying the ferry's design, reducing the initial spacing between the pontoons to , and requesting from Krupp-Rheinhausen (with assistance from WasserPr√ºfung 5) construction of a large steel platform covered with wood planking. This would both serve as the vessel's cargo deck, providing longitudinal and lateral strength to withstand operating on the sea. Indeed, this version would prove capable of surviving Force 6 waves.Schenk, pp. 124‚Äì125Kieser, p.122 The only propulsion systems available in the quantities needed to mass-produce these improvised invasion craft were diesel truck engines and aircraft engines. In consultation with engineers from Pionier-Battalion 47, Siebel settled on a combination of four 75 hp Ford V-8 engines (two each mounted side-by-side in the aft end of the pontoons) linked to standard marine propellers. For auxiliary power, three BMW 6U 750 hp aircraft engines could mount on elevated platforms along the aft edge of the cargo deck, turning airscrew propellers. Early problems with this arrangement included engine failure due to insufficient cooling, solved by linking the water-cooled aircraft engines to the diesel truck engines via piping to the pontoon compartments. Steering the craft by water screws alone also presented difficulties. A telegraph connected the wheelhouse to the two pontoon engine crews. But because of the vessel's broad beam, the crews had to react simultaneously to requests for changes in speed or the ferry would begin turning, a movement the rudders could barely counteract. On 31 August 1940, the new Siebel ferry was tested in the Ems estuary by the Special Command of the Merchant Shipping Division. Using only the ship's aircraft engines, it attained a maximum speed of . In contrast to the truck engines in the pontoons, the aero engines were directly controlled by the helmsman via throttles in the wheelhouse, allowing him to vary each engine's RPM. This greatly improved manoeuvrability, but the aircraft engines were noisy, prevented voice communication on deck, and consumed large amounts of fuel. For Sea Lion, it was decided to use them only for the run-up onto the invasion beaches or as a back-up in the event the water screws were damaged. On 4 September, two additional versions of the Siebel ferry, one powered by Opel Blitz truck engines and one powered by Ford V-8s were tested on the Ems estuary. Using only water screw propulsion, they achieved a cruising speed of , although it was believed this could be raised through efficient propellers. The Siebel ferry pontoons were flat-bottom and square in front. In combination with the vessel's wide cargo deck, this made for an exceptionally stable gun platform. The Luftwaffe mounted various-sized flak pieces on the ferries, and tested their suitability for engaging both air and surface targets while at sea. The versatile 8.8 cm guns proved well-suited for this role.Schenk, p.125 Series production of the Siebel ferry began in September 1940 at Antwerp as a joint Army‚ÄìLuftwaffe venture with the Army's B√∂ndel Pionier-Sonderkommando (Engineer Special Command) assembling the pontoons, decking and water propulsion while Col. Siebel's Luftwaffe-Sonderkommando installed the auxiliary aircraft engines. By late September, twenty-five of these craft were complete.Schenk, p.128 For Operation Sea Lion, the Luftwaffe organized the Siebel ferries into two flotillas: Flakkorps I (assigned to 9th Army) and Flakkorps II (assigned to 16th Army) to provide flank defense against air, ground, and surface targets for the First Wave tow formations. Each Siebel ferry could transport a complete flak unit consisting of one 8.8 cm gun and two 2 cm guns plus their three prime movers (although 9th Army planned to transport the necessary towing vehicles and support personnel separately via barges). Upon reaching the invasion beaches, the ferries could land their flak units, then assist with unloading the larger steamers anchored offshore. The Army referred to the Siebel ferries as ‚Äúdestroyer substitutes‚Äù.Schenk, p.125-128 Wartime service Bow view of a German Siebel ferry showing the twin catamaran pontoons and a multitude of trucks and light vehicles parked on deck. Note also the 2cm Flakvierling 38 mounted atop the wheelhouse (center of picture) for AA protection. With its simplicity of design, sturdy construction, good sea-keeping, and the ease with which it could be disassembled and shipped via rail to virtually any point on the Continent, the Siebel ferry proved a useful and adaptable amphibious vessel for transporting troops, vehicles, and supplies across open water wherever needed by Germans. It was also easily-configured to serve a variety of purposes, from minelaying to convoy escort.Schenk, pp. 128‚Äì129 Following Sea Lion's postponement in October 1940, the Luftwaffe decided in the fall of 1941 to continue producing Siebel ferries apart from the Army under its Special Ferry Command (F√§hre- Sonderkommando). It replaced the diesel truck engines on the original design with BMW and other type aircraft engines, housing four of them in enlarged pontoon ends connected to water screws via a reversing gearbox. Some of these vessels were assigned to the Army and operated with mixed crews, but the Army disliked the use of aircraft engines, claiming they were prone to catching fire and consumed excessive amounts of fuel. The Army Engineer Ferry Construction Command at Antwerp continued using vehicle engines as the main propulsion unit, and considered them reliable compared to the Luftwaffe's aircraft engines. Two ferries were transferred to the Romanian Navy in late 1941.Nicolae Koslinski, Raymond StƒÉnescu, Marina rom√¢nƒÉ in al doilea rƒÉzboi mondial: 1941-1942, FƒÉt-Frumos, 1996, p. 292 References Bibliography     External links *german Navy.de (English) * Luftwaffen- F√§hrenflotillen Category:Landing craft Category:Ship types Category:Amphibious warfare vessels ","title":"Siebel ferry"},{"id":"26199020","text":"Don Svaty is a former member of the Kansas House of Representatives, representing the 108th district as a Democrat.

It is believed to be strongly autobiographical in some sections.Margaret Drabble (ed.) The Oxford Companion to English Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006) p. 455. Meredith intended the book to be a popular success, but the roll-call of reprints shows it to have been so only during Meredith's late-Victorian and Edwardian heyday, his highly-wrought style proving an obstacle for some readers.Catalogue entry at Copac.  Synopsis  At the beginning of the novel, Harry Richmond is a young boy, living under the care of his grandfather, Squire Beltham, in their home of Riversley, in Hampshire, England. The Squire, one of the wealthiest people in England, had two daughters, one of whom, Dorothy, still lives at Riversley. The other daughter married Roy Richmond, Harry's father, who drove the daughter permanently insane; she is also at Riversley. At the beginning of the book, Roy Richmond shows up at Riversley, and claiming parental rights, takes away Harry to be brought up by him. After some adventures in London, Harry is left in a boarding school by Roy, where he meets a number of friends who show up throughout the novel. While he is there his mother dies. Harry escapes from the school, and with help of the gypsy girl Kiomi, returns to Riversley. While there he misses his father, and overhearing that he may be in London, goes there with his friend Temple. Harry and Temple however end up falling asleep on a boat, the Priscilla, and are taken away against their will to Germany, where Harry rediscovers his father, and meets Princess Ottilia. When Harry comes of age, he inherits a large sum and is told that he will receive 20,000/year if marries his third-cousin Janet Ilchester, of whom the Squire is very fond. Instead Harry, with the considerable help of his father, pursues the Princess, despite the objections of the Prince her father, and after a while, receives her promise to be married, after he becomes a member of Parliament, which eventually occurs. Roy Richmond deceives the Princess into visiting Harry at the Isle of Man, claiming that he is near death. In the climax of the novel, the Squire is supposed to request from the Prince, with expectation of an acceptance, the hand of the Princess. At this point all of the plans of Roy Richmond for his son Harry seem to have come to fruition. However, the Squire discovers that his daughter, Dorothy, has given 25,000 to Roy Richmond to cover his debts, and refuses to carry out the scheme. The plan collapses and the Princess marries a German Prince. Harry Richmond realises that he loves Janet Ilchester, and after further adventures, they are finally married in Germany. After the marriage, they return to Riversley, only to find it engulfed in flames. In the fire Roy Richmond dies looking to the safety of Dorothy.  Writing and publication history  Meredith first began working on The Adventures of Harry Richmond as far back as 1863, and the following year he told his friend Augustus Jessopp that he was writing a work to be called The Adventure of Richmond Roy and his Friend, Contrivance Jack: Being the History of Two Rising Men. Since he was also working on the novels Rhoda Fleming and Vittoria in these years progress was slow, but Harry Richmond was completed by 1870.S. M. Ellis George Meredith: His Life and Friends in Relation to his Work (London: Grant Richards, 1920) p. 224. It first appeared in Cornhill Magazine between September 1870 and November 1871, with illustrations by George du Maurier.Margaret Canney (ed.) The Sterling Library: A Catalogue of Printed Books and Literary Manuscripts Collected by Sir Louis Sterling and Presented by him to the University of London (Cambridge: privately printed, 1954) p. 193. The novel had been intended by Meredith as \\"a spanking bid for popularity\\", and at first the bid seemed successful. The magazine appearance was followed at the end of 1871 by a three-volume edition issued by Smith, Elder & Co., with a second edition only three months later. At that point the demand died away, and another edition was not needed for 15 years; but with the revival of interest in Meredith in the 1880s a string of reprints began, which lasted up to the First World War.Philip J. Waller Writers, Readers, and Reputations: Literary Life in Britain, 1870-1918 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006) p. 891; Catalogue entry at Copac.  Critical reception  As with many other of Meredith's novels, Harry Richmond has always divided critical opinion. From the start many were disconcerted by the spectacle of a studiedly witty and philosophical adventure story. An anonymous reviewer in The Examiner was damning: W. L. Courtney, writing in the Fortnightly Review in 1886, complained: On the other hand Arthur Symons found it \\"rousing, enthralling, exciting, full of poetry, and a serious and masterly study in character\\", and Max Beerbohm enthused: \\"What a book! What swiftness and beauty and strength! It is the flight of a young golden eagle high across seas and mountains.\\"S. M. Ellis George Meredith: His Life and Friends in Relation to his Work (London: Grant Richards, 1920) p. 229; David Cecil Max: A Biography (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1965) p. 365. Gore Vidal claimed that Mark Twain enjoyed and \\"stole\\" the characters of the Duke and the Dauphin in Huckleberry Finn from Harry Richmond, and noted:  Modern editions  * L. T. Hergenhan (ed.)

Bod-inc. stands out among incunabula catalogues for its detailed listing of the contents of each edition being described. It was published on 7 July 2005 by Oxford University Press in six volumes. History L. A. Sheppard began work on a catalogue of Bodleian incunabula in 1955 but he left Oxford in 1971 before the work could be completed; his slip catalogue was bound into seven volumes and served as a base of information for the Bod-inc. project.Alan Coates, et al., A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century now in the Bodleian Library (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. lxx‚Äìlxxii. In the mid-1980s, Kristian Jensen, as the Bodleian Library's specialist in early printed books, decided that a new catalogue was needed and that its descriptions should follow the standards of detail expected in catalogues of medieval manuscripts.Alan Coates, et al., A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century now in the Bodleian Library (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. lxxii. Early in the project, Jensen was assisted by Bettina Wagner and Alan Coates beginning in 1992. Work on Bod-inc. was undertaken over the thirteen-year period between January 1992 and January 2005 by a team of cataloguers. From 1992 to 1999, Jensen headed the cataloguing team; he was succeeded by Alan Coates who headed the project from 2000 to its completion, during which time Jensen served as a consultant.Alan Coates, et al., A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century now in the Bodleian Library (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. xiii.

Background Obafemi Anibaba obtained a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Lagos and went on to obtain a PhD in Engineering from the University of Surrey. He worked for many years for the Lagos State Ministry of Works and Transport. He has served on the board of several companies, and was Chairman, Ogun-Osun River Basin Development Authority and Chairman, Femo Engineering (Nigeria). He was on the board of First Bank of Nigeria, Jos Steel Rolling Company and Allied Bank of Nigeria, and was Chairman of the Governing Council of Lagos Polytechnic, Isolo. Cabinet positions The Federal Government of Nigeria appointed him Minister of Works in March 2006. He was transferred to become Minister of Communications in September 2006. He chaired the Nigeria Telecommunications Forum in Abuja on the 19‚Äì20 September 2006. He opened the Universal Service Provision Fund (USPF) Consultative Forum on Strategies for Achieving Access in Nigeria in Lagos on October 31, 2006. In his opening remarks he noted that USPF is only a fund to facilitate roll out of services in identified rural areas. The services would be implemented through qualified operating companies. On 22 November 2006, he attended a ceremony where President Olusegun Obasanjo cut the ribbon to formally open the new Corporate Headquarters of the Nigerian Communications Commission in Abuja. In January 2007, Olusegun Obasanjo announced the final cabinet reshuffle of his administration. Among other moves, Frank Nweke, Jr was appointed Federal Minister of Communications, while Anibaba stayed on as Minister of State in the Ministry, a position he held until the new administration of President Umaru Yar'Adua came into office in May 2007. Later career In November 2009, the Senate ad hoc committee on transport led by Heineken Lokpobiri, submitted a report to the upper house that revealed \\"alleged serial malpractices\\" in road contracting over a ten-year period, and recommended that former ministers of works Anthony Anenih, Adeseye Ogunlewe, Obafemi Anibaba, Cornelius Adebayo and others be prosecuted for corruption. The Senate Ad Hoc Committee charges included awarding contracts without budgetary provision, and for failure to account for profits from a large sale of bitumen. Senate discussion of the report was delayed.

After the show was cancelled, Mil√° returned to radio. She worked with I√±aki Gabilondo in Cadena SER. Mil√°'s TV comeback came in 1982 with the program Buenas Noches (\\"Goodnight\\"), which became one of the hits of the season and lasted until 1984. Her personal style and directness with her guests helped her turn into one of the most popular Spanish TV personalities of the 1980s. After a brief stint with the Catalan television station TV3, and then back in TVE in 1990, she moved over to new private TV network Antena 3 in the early nineties, where she stayed until moving to private broadcaster Telecinco in 2000. In 2000 she found renewed success as the host of the Spanish franchise of hit reality show Gran Hermano, earning poor critical reviews but massive ratings. As of 2017, Mil√° has hosted fifteen of the seventeen regular seasons of the show (all except for season 3 in 2002 which was hosted by Pepe Navarro, and season 17 in 2016 which was hosted by Jorge Javier V√°zquez) and two All Stars seasons.

It was built in 1890 for the Elm Spinning Company Ltd., and closed in 1928, when it was revived by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation (1929) and called Newby Mill. LCC and all their assets passed to Courtaulds in 1964. Production at Newby finished in 1970, and it was used for warehousing. Subsequently, now named Shaw No 3 Mill, it became part of Littlewood's Shaw National Distribution Centre. Location Shaw and Crompton is a town and civil parish within the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, in Greater Manchester, England. It lies on the River Beal at the foothills of the Pennines, north of Oldham, southeast of Rochdale, and to the northeast of the city of Manchester. It is regularly referred to as Shaw. It is not served by any canal but a rail service was provided by the Oldham Loop Line, built in 1863 by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. History The manufacture of textiles in Crompton can be traced back to 1474, when a lease dated from that year outlines that the occupant of Crompton Park had spinning wheels, cards and looms, all of which suggest that cloth was being produced in large quantities. The upland geography of the area constrained the output of crop growing, and so prior to industrialisation the area was used for grazing sheep, which provided the raw material for a local woollen weaving trade. Until the mid-18th century, Crompton's textile sector had been closely linked with that of Rochdale and Saddleworth in the north and east; it was a woollen manufacturing district. However, as the demand for cotton goods increased, Crompton mirrored developments in Oldham and Manchester in the south and southwest, importing raw cotton and making cotton cloth. Oldham rose to prominence during the 19th century as an international centre of textile manufacture. It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution, and amongst the first ever industrialised towns, rapidly becoming \\"one of the most important centres of cotton and textile industries in England\\", spinning Oldham counts, the coarser counts of cotton. It was in the second half of the 19th century, that Oldham became the world centre for spinning cotton yarn.. This was due in a large part to the formation of limited liability companies known as Oldham Limiteds. In 1851 more than 30 percent of Oldham's population was employed within the textile sector, compared to 5% across Great Britain. At its zenith, it was the most productive cotton spinning mill town in the world.. When suitable land in Oldham had become scarce in the 1860s, there was a mill building boom in Shaw and Crompton, giving rise to the area as major mill town. The local townscape became dominated by distinctive rectangular brick-built mills, and its former villages and hamlets agglomerated as a single town around these factories. Shaw and Crompton railway station and a goods yard was opened in 1863, allowing improved transportation of textile goods and raw materials to and from the township. Neighbouring Royton had begun to encroach upon southern boundary, forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district with Oldham. By 1871 Oldham had more spindles than any country in the world except the United States, and in 1909, was spinning more cotton than France and Germany combined. The demand for cheap cotton goods from this area prompted the flotation of cotton spinning companies; the investment was followed by the construction of 12 new cotton mills from 1870 and 1900. Elm Mill, was built in 1890 as a part of a group of mills in Linney Lane Shaw. By 1911 there were 16.4 million spindles in Oldham, compared with a total of 58 million in the United Kingdom and 143.5 million in the world; in 1928, with the construction of the UK's largest textile factory Oldham reached its manufacturing zenith. At its peak, there were over 360 mills, operating night and day; In the post- war economic boom of 1919-20, investors did not have the time to build new mills and so were prepared to pay vastly inflated sums for shares in existing companies. Many mills were refloated at valuations of up to ¬£500,000 (¬£ as of ), or five times what they had cost to build before the war, resulting in the town being nicknamed \\"The Golden City\\" as the scramble for shares intensified. Because of this highly profitable share dealing, it was reported in the national press that Shaw and Crompton had more millionaires per capita than any other town in the world. Elm Mill was extended. The number of cotton mills in the township peaked at 36 in 1920. The industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914‚Äì18 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. Elm Mill ceased production in 1928. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. and they bought the mill in 1932 and it was renamed Newby Mill, thus it was one of 104 mills bought by the LCC, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950. But LCC itself was purchased by Courtaulds in 1964, and Newby Mill was closed in 1970. In 2008, now named Shaw No 3, it is part of Littlewoods' Shaw National Distribution Centre who have adapted it for warehousing and bulk storage for their catalogue distribution operations. It is linked by a new building to Lily (No.2) mill and by a bridge to a newer building that occupies the site of Rutland Mill. Signs of its cotton heritage can still be seen including its engine house with original crane system, which is still largely intact.

Its primary objective is to provide intelligence to maintain air superiority and conduct surveillance. The system is currently in-service with Israel and Singapore, and in the future Italy and the United States. Design and features Israel Air Force EL/W-2085 on display at Farnborough 2008 The EL/W-2085 was developed from the single-band EL/M-2075 \\"Phalcon\\" system. Instead of using a rotodome, a moving radar found on some AEW&C; aircraft, the EL/W-2085 uses an active electronically scanned array (AESA) ‚Äì an active phased array radar. This radar consists of an array of transmit/receive (T/R) modules that allow a beam to be electronically steered, making a physically rotating rotodome unnecessary. AESA radars operate on a pseudorandom set of frequencies and also have very short scanning rates, which makes them difficult to detect and jam. Up to 1000 targets can be tracked simultaneously to a range of 243 nmi (450 km), while at the same time, multitudes of air-to- air interceptions or air-to-surface (includes maritime) attacks can be guided simultaneously. The radar equipment of the Israeli CAEW consists of each one L-band radar left and right sides on the fuselage and each one S-band antenna in nose and tail. The phased array allows positions of aircraft on operator screens to be updated every 2‚Äì4 seconds, rather than every 12 seconds as is the case on the rotodome AWACS. Operational history An Israeli tanker and Gulfstream in refuelling formation Circa 2005 the Israeli Air Force purchased five Gulfstream G550-based Eitam aircraft to serve as the new IDF platform for its newer generation of AEW systems. The new aircraft use the EL/W-2085 dual- band sensor suite, and are more capable and less expensive to operate than the older Boeing 707-based EL/M-2075. Extensive modifications were made to the Gulfstream's fuselage by IAI, such as the addition of protruding composite radomes, to house the radar arrays in conformal body modifications.

It is named for Abram Lisner, a trustee of the University who donated the money for its construction. Constructed in 1943, it served as the focus of theatrical life in Washington prior to the opening of the Kennedy Center. Today, it is still used for performances, and is the home of several companies including Washington Concert Opera. The auditorium seats 1,490 people. The auditorium was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It was built in the stripped classicist style. Art Outside of the Auditorium is the River Horse sculpture. In 1996 George Washington University President Stephen Joel Trachtenberg presented this bronze statue of a hippopotamus as a gift to the University's Class of 2000. The auditorium contains a mural by Augustus Vincent Track, and the Dimock gallery is located on the lower Lisner Lounge.  History   Construction  Construction of Lisner Auditorium was initially funded by Abram Lisner, a German-born owner of Washington's Palais Royale department store. Additional funding for the construction project was provided by the George Washington Memorial Association and the Dimock Estate. The building was designed by Faulkner and Kingsbury and built by Charles H. Tompkins Company. Work commenced on the Auditorium in 1941; it was completed in 1943.  Desegregation controversy  On October 9, 1946 the theater declined entry to African-Americans, including the Dean of the Howard University Medical School. A leaflet and boycotting campaign ensued. The National Symphony Orchestra canceled performances. In 1947, the Board of Trustees changed policy to admit African-Americans to sponsored events, but did not completely desegregate until 1954.

His murderers were hanged in chains on Gibbet Hill, Hindhead the following year. Murder The Unknown Sailor is first recorded as visiting the Red Lion Inn at Thursley as he was walking back from London to join his ship at Portsmouth on 24 September 1786. There he met three other seafarers, James Marshall, Michael Casey and Edward Lonegon. He generously paid for their drinks and food and was last seen leaving for Hindhead Hill with them. The three seafarers murdered him and stripped him of his clothes. The three then made their way down the London to Portsmouth road (now the A3) and were arrested a few hours later trying to sell the murdered sailor's clothes at the Sun InnPhotograph of Sun Inn on Geograph website in Rake (not the Flying Bull in Rake as some versions of the story have it).

The Broom-squire In the early nineteenth century, the Devil's Punch Bowl became inhabited by several families who enclosed portions of the western slopes of the Bowl for themselves. Here they pastured their sheep, goats, and cattle and gleaned profits of a trade which they monopolised: making and selling brooms. Rods supplied by coppices of Spanish chestnut served for handles, the long and wiry heather twigs for brush. They became known as the Broom-squires and were a fiercely independent folk. The chief Broom-squire families were the Boxalls, the Snellings, and the Nashes.Wright, Thomas. 1898 Hindhead or the English Switzerland Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co Ltd In 1896, the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould published his novel The Broom-Squire which tells the fictitious tragic story of Mehetabel, supposedly the daughter of the Unknown Sailor, and of her ill-treatment at the hands of Bideabout, one of the Broom-squires.Baring-Gould, Sabine. 1896.
