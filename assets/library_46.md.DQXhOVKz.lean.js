It is primarily a pedagogical tool, similar to a formal book report. A simple format for writing an Explication de Texte is this: # A brief summary of the literal, not the figurative, content; # A description of the text's type and structure (e.g. Was it a sonnet?

Children and teens who are perceived as spoiled may be described as \\"overindulged\\", \\"grandiose\\", \\"narcissistic\\" or \\"egocentric-regressed\\". Perception is important to take into account, because when the child has a neurological condition such as autism, ADHD or intellectual disability, observers may judge them as \\"spoiled\\" without understanding the whole picture. There is no accepted scientific definition of what \\"spoiled\\" means, and professionals are often unwilling to use the label because it is considered vague and derogatory. Being spoiled is not recognized as a mental disorder in any of the medical manuals, such as the ICD-10 or the DSM-IV, or its successor, the DSM-5. As syndrome Richard Weaver, in his work Ideas Have Consequences, introduced the term ‚Äúspoiled child psychology‚Äù in 1948. In 1989, Bruce McIntosh coined the term the \\"spoiled child syndrome\\". The syndrome is characterized by \\"excessive, self-centered, and immature behavior\\". It includes lack of consideration for other people, recurrent temper tantrums, an inability to handle the delay of gratification, demands for having one's own way, obstructiveness, and manipulation to get their way. McIntosh attributed the syndrome to \\"the failure of parents to enforce consistent, age-appropriate limits\\", but others, such as Aylward, note that temperament is probably a contributory factor. It is important to note that the temper tantrums are recurrent. McIntosh observes that \\"many of the problem behaviors that cause parental concern are unrelated to spoiling as properly understood\\". Children may have occasional temper tantrums without them falling under the umbrella of \\"spoiled\\". Extreme cases of spoiled child syndrome, in contrast, will involve frequent temper tantrums, physical aggression, defiance, destructive behavior, and refusal to comply with even the simple demands of daily tasks. This can be similar to the profile of children diagnosed with Pathological Demand Avoidance, which is part of the autism spectrum. =Potential causes= Failure of parents to enforce consistent, age-appropriate limits. * Parents shielding the child from normal everyday frustrations. * Provision of excessive material gifts, even when the child has not behaved appropriately. * Improper role models provided by parents. * However, social disabilities, such as autism, ODD, ADHD, and PDA, are not evidence of a child being spoiled. =Differential diagnosis= Children with underlying medical or mental health problems may exhibit some of the symptoms. Indeed, where the difficulties are not predicated in the parental-child nexus, many loving parents may be judged as \\"spoiling\\" instead of affirmed. Speech or hearing disorders, and attention deficit disorder, may lead to children's failing to understand the limits set by parents. Children who have recently experienced a stressful event, such as the separation of the parents (divorce) or the birth or death of a close family relative, may also exhibit some or all of the symptoms. Children of parents who themselves have psychiatric disorders may manifest some of the symptoms, because the parents behave erratically, sometimes failing to perceive their children's behavior correctly, and thus fail to properly or consistently define limits of normal behavior for them. =Prevention= Parents can seek advice, support, and encouragement to empower them in parenthood from diverse sources. =Treatment= Treatment by a physician involves assessing parental competence, and whether the parents set limits correctly and consistently. Physicians should rule out dysfunction in the family, referring dysfunctional families for family therapy and dysfunctional parents for parenting skills training, and counsel parents in methods for modifying their child's behavior. Infants In early infancy, a baby signals desire for food, contact, and comfort by crying. This behavior should be viewed as a distress signal indicating that some biological need is not being met. Although parents sometimes worry about spoiling their children by giving them too much attention, specialists in child development maintain that babies cannot be spoiled in the first six months of life. During the first year, children are developing a sense of basic trust and attachment. In general, the more attention and care they receive from their parents, the better. Only children Alfred Adler (1870‚Äì1937) believed that \\"only children\\" were likely to experience a variety of problems from their situation. Adler theorized that because only children have no rivals for their parents' affection, they will become pampered and spoiled, particularly by their mother. He suggested that this could later cause interpersonal difficulties if the person is not universally liked and admired. A 1987 quantitative review of 141 studies on 16 different personality traits contradicted Adler's theory. This research found no evidence of any \\"spoilage\\" or other pattern of maladjustment in only children. The major finding was that only children are not very different from children with siblings. The main exception to this was the finding that only children are generally higher in achievement motivation. A second analysis revealed that only children, first-borns, and children with only one sibling score higher on tests of verbal ability than later-borns and children with multiple siblings. Later life Spoiling in early childhood tends to create characteristic reactions that persist, fixed, into later life. These can cause significant social problems. Spoiled children may have difficulty coping with situations such as teachers scolding them or refusing to grant extensions on homework assignments, playmates refusing to allow them to play with their toys and playmates refusing playdates with them, a loss in friends, failure in employment, and failure with personal relationships. As adults, spoiled children may experience problems with anger management, professionalism, and personal relationships; a link with adult psychopathy has been observed.

The territory stretched from the northern peninsula opposite Gibraltar, to Sala Colonia (or Chellah) and Volubilis to the south,C. Michael Hogan, Chellah, The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham and as far east as the Mulucha (or Malva) river. Its capital city was Tingis, which is the modern Tangier. Other major cities of the province were Iulia Valentia Banasa, Septem, Rusadir, Lixus and Tamuda. University of Granada: Mauretania Tingitana (in Spanish) History After the death in 40 AD of Ptolemy of Mauretania, the last Ptolemaic ruler of the Kingdom of Mauretania, in about 44 AD Roman Emperor Claudius annexed the kingdom to the Roman Empire and partitioned it into two Roman provinces: Mauretania Tingitana; and Mauretania Caesariensis. The Mulucha (Moulouya River), located around 60 km west of modern Oran, Algeria, became the border separating them.Richard J.A. Talberts, Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World - p. 457 The Roman occupation did not extend very far into the continent. In the far west, the southern limit of imperial rule was Volubilis, which was ringed with military camps such as Tocolosida slightly to the south east and Ain Chkour to the north west, and a fossatum or defensive ditch. On the Atlantic coast Sala Colonia was protected by another ditch and a rampart and a line of watchtowers. This was not a continuous line of fortifications: there is no evidence of a defensive wall like the one that protected the turbulent frontier in Britannia at the other extremity of the Roman Empire. Rather, it was a network of forts and ditches that seems to have functioned as a filter. The limes ‚Äì the word from which the English word ‚Äúlimit‚Äù is derived ‚Äì protected the areas that were under direct Roman control by funnelling contacts with the interior through the major settlements, regulating the links between the nomads and transhumants with the towns and farms of the occupied areas. The same people lived on both sides of these limes, although the population was quite small. Volubilis had perhaps twenty thousand inhabitants at most in the second century. On the evidence of inscriptions, only around ten to twenty per cent of them were of European origin, mainly Spanish; the rest were local. Roman historians (like Ptolemy) considered all of Morocco north of the Atlas Mountains part of the Roman Empire, because in the times of Augustus, Mauretania was a vassal state and its rulers (like Juba II) controlled all the areas south of Volubilis. The effective control of Roman legionaries, however, was up to the area of Sala Colonia (the castra \\"Exploratio Ad Mercurios\\", south of Sala Colonia, is the southernmost Roman settlement discovered until now). Some historians, like Leo Africanus, believe the Roman frontier reached the area of Casablanca, founded by the Romans as a port named \\"Anfa\\". Indeed, the modern city of Azemmour in central Morocco lies on the ancient Azama, a trading port of Phoenician and later Roman origins. Still today can be seen the remains of a Roman deposit for grain in the so- called \\"Portuguese cisterns\\".Roman Azama Pliny the Elder described in some detail the area south of the Atlas Mountains, when Gaius Suetonius Paulinus undertook a military expedition in 41: =Roman province= During the reign of the Numidian King Juba II, Emperor Augustus had already founded three colonias (with Roman citizens) in Mauretania close to the Atlantic coast: Iulia Constantia Zilil, Iulia Valentia Banasa and Iulia Campestris Babba. This western part of Mauretania was to become the province called Mauretania Tingitana shortly afterwards. The region remained a part of the Roman Empire until 429, when the Vandals overran the area and Roman administrative presence came to an end. The Roman empire in the time of Hadrian (ruled 117‚Äì138 AD), showing, in northwestern Africa, the imperial province of Mauretania Tingitana (Morocco) The most important city of Mauretania Tingitana was Volubilis. This city was the administrative and economic center of the province in western Roman Africa. The fertile lands of the province produced many commodities such as grain and olive oil, which were exported to Rome, contributing to the province's wealth and prosperity. Archaeology has documented the presence of a Jewish community in the Roman period.Two Thousand Years of Jewish Life in Morocco, Haim Zafrani, Ktav, 2005, p. 2 The principal exports from Mauretania Tingitana were purple dyes and valuable timber. Tingitana also supplied Rome with agricultural goods and animals, such as lions and leopards. The native Mauri were highly regarded and recruited by the Romans as soldiers, especially as light cavalry. Clementius Valerius Marcellinus is recorded as the governor (praeses) between 24 October 277 and 13 April 280.J.E.H. Spaul, \\"Governors of Tingitana\\", Antiquit√©s africaines 30 (1994), p. 253 According to tradition, the martyrdom of St Marcellus took place on 28 July 298 at Tingis (Tangier). During the Tetrarchy (Emperor Diocletian's reform of Roman governmental structures in 297), Mauretania Tingitana became part of the Diocese of Hispaniae, 'the Spains', and, by extension, part of the Praetorian prefecture of Gaul. Mauretania Caesariensis was in the Diocese of Africa. Lucilius Constantius is recorded as governor (praeses) in the late fourth century. The Notitia Dignitatum shows also, in its military organisation, a Comes Tingitaniae with a field army composed of two legions, three vexillations, and two auxilia palatina. Flavius Memorius held this office (comes) at some point during the middle of the fourth century. However, it is implicit in the source material that there was a single military command for both of the Mauretanian provinces, with a Dux Mauretaniae (a lower rank) controlling seven cohorts and one ala. The Germanic Vandals established themselves in the province of Baetica in 422 AD under their king, Gunderic, and, from there, they carried out raids on Mauretania Tingitana. In 427 AD, the Comes Africae, Bonifacius, rejected an order of recall from the Emperor Valentinian III, and he defeated an army sent against him. He was less fortunate when a second force was sent in 428 AD. In that year, Gunderic was succeeded by Gaiseric, and Bonifacius invited Gaiseric into Africa, providing a fleet to enable the passage of the Vandals to Tingis and Septem (Ceuta). Bonifacius intended to confine the Vandals to Mauretania, but, once they had crossed the straits, they rejected any control and marched on Carthage. =Byzantines= In 533 AD, the Byzantine general Belisarius reconquered the former Diocese of Africa from the Vandals on behalf of the Emperor Justinian I. All the territory west of Caesarea had already been lost by the Vandals to the Berber \\"Mauri\\", but a re-established Dux Mauretaniae kept a military unit at Septem (modern Ceuta). This was the last Byzantine outpost in Mauretania Tingitana; the rest of what had been the Roman province was united with the Byzantine part of Andalusia under the name of the Praetorian prefecture of Africa, with Septem as administrative capital. Most of the Maghreb littoral was later organised as the Exarchate of Africa, a special status in view of the outpost defense needs. When the Umayyad Caliphate conquered all of Northern Africa, it brought Islam to the local adherents of the traditional Berber religion and Christianity. The two Mauretania provinces were consolidated as the territory of al-Maghrib (Arabic for 'the West', and still the official name of the Sharifian Kingdom of Morocco). This larger province also included over half of modern Algeria. Stone ruins dating from the Roman era exist at various archaeological sites, including the Capitoline Temple at Volubilis, the palace of Gordius, Sala Colonia, Tingis and Iulia Constantia Zilil.

Aminet was originally hosted by several universities' FTP sites, and is now available on CD-ROM and on the web. According to Aminet, as of 1 April 2013, it has 80592 packages online. History In January 1992, Swiss student Urban M√ºller took over a software archive that had been started by other members of a computer science students' club. Soon the archive became mirrored worldwide and in 1995 started being distributed on monthly CD-ROMs. By using a single master site (then wuarchive.wustl.edu) for creating ftp scripts for each slave site, Aminet reduced to a bare minimum the effort to set up new mirror sites. Aminet also illustrates practical use of metadata schema by software repositories. Reports of daily additions to this software archive were posted automatically to Usenet (de.comp.sys.amiga.archive), or could be requested as an email newsletter. Most of the programs on Aminet were public domain or shareware, but software companies made updates and demo versions of their programs available as well. Now Aminet is complemented by platform specific sites archiving software for AmigaOS 4, AROS or MorphOS only. Aminet was an early attempt to create a centralized public archive maintained by the users themselves, predated only by the Info-Mac archive. Aminet aimed to keep the community united and free to download new open source software, new program demo releases, patches and localization of Amiga programs (AmigaOS and its modern programs are free to be localized by any single user into any country language), pictures, audio and video files and even hints or complete solutions to various Amiga games. Recognized among interesting FTP sites in early 1990s, Aminet was the largest public archive of software for any platform until around 1996. When the Internet explosion occurred from 1996 to 1999, Aminet rapidly fell behind the emerging massive PC archives. During 2004 the main Aminet mirror suffered from a hard-disk crash and many people considered the whole project dead. Around the same time, Nicolas Mendoza was setting up a modernized interface that indexed Aminet and provided advanced search features and a modern interface to navigate the tree, called Amirepo. He also posted public suggestions on how to help improving Aminet by adding tags for architectures to help catalog the tree that now consisted of MorphOS, AmigaOS 4 and Amithlon files, in addition to the already existing M68K, PowerUP and WarpOS files. He also suggested on measures to add proper dependencies to complement and replace the existing Requires field. This also in a future goal of letting Aminet function as a repository for package management systems similar to Debian's APT/DPKG and Red Hats' RPM. He tried to contact individuals like Matthias Scheler and Urban M√ºller which was known to maintain Aminet, but to no avail. At the end of 2004 Christoph Gutjahr made contact with Urban M√ºller and set up a team to continue the Aminet effort. Urban M√ºller provided a new main mirror site and the backlog of packages were added in. The Amirepo interface of Nicolas Mendoza was integrated and Aminet was officially up and running again in February 2005. During 2005 the uploads started getting going again and in November 2005 most of the ambiguous files and .readme files were sorted out, finally sanitizing the repository. The team has gradually made many changes.

Mission The Regiment was an administrative unit without significant combat capability. Technically, was is considered to be a cavalry unit, but it did not have light armored unit role of modern-day Western cavalry units. Instead, the regiment was specialized as a logistics training center which trained the bulk of the logistics personnel of Finnish Defence Forces. The H√§me Cavalry Battalion was the only unit of the Regiment accepting usual, non-volunteer conscripts. Twice a year, the Battalion inducted some 260 conscripts, who were subsequently trained as military drivers, logistics technicians, cooks or military policemen. The Headquarters Troop also trained almost all medics of the Finnish Defence Forces on its three-week combat medic course. The NCO school of the unit, on the other hand, received conscript NCO students from all units of the FDF and the Finnish Border Guard for special training as logistics NCOs. The NCO students were trained to fulfill NCO duties as medic NCOs, motor vehicle NCO, supply NCOs, weapons smith NCOs or hygienics NCOs. =H√§me Cavalry Battalion= The H√§me Cavalry Battalion was the main military unit of the H√§me Regiment. It provided infantry training for the conscripts. Before the creation of the regiment in 1986, the battalion was its own independent unit. The traditional march of the battalion was the 'Suomalaisen Ratsuv√§en marssi 30-vuotisessa sodassa.Maanpuolustuskorkeakoulu: \\"Suomen puolustusvoimat ennen ja nyt\\" WSOY, 2001, page 329.

Military Music School accepts yearly some 80 applicants adept at playing a musical instrument, on the basis of national entrance exam. The service term is 9 or 12 months. Most of this time is spent in the Finnish Defence Forces Conscript Band. However, part of the conscripts receive NCO training in addition to their musical duties. In addition to conscript training, the Military Music School trains career musicians of the FDF. In 2015, Conscript Band of the Finnish Defence Forces was moved to Armored Brigade which had its own band (Armored Band) disbanded in 2013. Military Music School as organization was disbanded. The Conscript Band's and Military Music School's traditional march was Marssi nro. 9. =Sports School= The conscript training in Sports School is open to eligible volunteers. For service in Sports School, the conscript must be at least a semi-professional sportsman of national level. The conscripts of the unit are always trained for reconnaissance duties, interfering as little as possible with the sportsman's career. The typical service term is 12 months, most conscripts receiving at least NCO training. In addition to the conscript training, the Sports School educates the career reconnaissance officers and NCOs and FDF physical education personnel. The Sports School's traditional march is Urheilun Juhlaa. Sports School was moved to Guard Jaeger Regiment in Helsinki. In addition winter sports' professionals are trained in the Kainuu Brigade. =Logistics Training Center= The Logistics Training Center is a purely professional unit, centering on training FDF and Border Guard logistics personnel. In addition to its training mission, the Center pursues research and development initiatives of the FDF logistics branch. The personnel of the Center participate actively in the specialist conscript training of the H√§me Cavalry Battalion. Logistics Training Center's traditional march was Vapaa kansa.

History In 1557, Robert Hammond, a wealthy brewer who had acquired property in Hampton, left in his will provision for the maintenance of a \\"free scole\\" and to build a small schoolhouse \\"with seates in yt\\" in the churchyard of Hampton Church . Although Hampton School was founded in 1557, there was provision in the will that the school would only continue as long as the vicar, churchwardens and parishioners carried out his requests. If not, then the properties would revert to his heirs. It seems that the school did not survive beyond 1568, or possibly earlier, and the properties reverted to the heirs. Subsequently, however, the school re-opened in 1612. This was as a result of a Commission established to enquire into the fate of Tudor charities that had disappeared for various reasons. The \\"learned counsell on bothe sides\\" reached deadlock at the Commissioners. However, in the spirit of compromise and through the generosity of the then legal owner of the properties, Nicholas Pigeon, the school was re-endowed. The early school was on the site of St Mary's Church by the River Thames. It moved to a site on Upper Sunbury Road in 1880. The new school buildings cost ¬£8,000 and were built in the Elizabethan Tudor style to accommodate 125 day boys and 25 boarders. The school moved to its present site on Hanworth Road in 1939. The new 28 acre site allowed for expansion and the potential to provide for 600-650 boys. The foundation stone was laid on 5 July 1938 and a year later the school was opened. The School converted from voluntary aided status to become a fee-paying independent school in 1975 after changes to the administration of secondary education in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It is next to The Lady Eleanor Holles School for girls, with which it co-operates in a number of co-curricular activities and shares several classes, clubs, facilities (including a swimming pool) and a coach service. Headmaster Barry Martin retired in July 2013 after 16 years of service. He was succeeded by Kevin Knibbs in September 2013. Founders' Day is celebrated by the school towards the end of each academic year. The occasion is marked by a procession of boys walking from the school to St. Mary's Church for a service including the school choir singing and readings. Campus The School buildings include an assembly hall, sports hall, performing arts centre, classrooms, a Sixth Form centre and specialist facilities for the Sciences, Technology, ICT, Art, Music, Drama and Modern Languages. The site of 29 acres (120,000 m2) accommodates playing fields comprising four rugby pitches, seven football pitches, six cricket squares, three astroturf and three acrylic tennis courts, a 3G Astroturf multi-purpose football/rugby pitch, athletics facilities, two rock walls and the Old Hamptonians' Pavilion. The school also owns a boathouse on the Thames, the Millennium Boathouse, to accommodate for rowing practice. The boathouse is shared with the neighbouring Lady Eleanor Holles School. Recent construction Hampton now has a sixth form centre, aside the main hall, within the original building, in place of the old Hammond Quad, and to keep the founders name alive, resulted in the renaming of the 450 Hall to ‚ÄòThe Hammond Theatre‚Äô. The new sixth form centre has two floors, individual study areas, multiple new classrooms and a live wall. In addition to this, new classrooms and science laboratories are being built at the rear of the school, joining the Alexandria building to the physics, chemistry and biology departments on the opposite side. The build has been completed and opened during the 2019‚Äì2020 academic year. Charity Through the Form Charity programme the whole school community helps raise money and awareness for good causes locally (e.g.Princess Alice Hospice, Barnardos, Home-Start and the Shooting Star Trust), nationally (e.g. Jeans for Genes Day and Breakthrough Breast Cancer), and internationally (e.g. Opportunity International, the African Medical and Research Foundation, Pahamune House). In 2012/13, over ¬£25,000 was raised by Form Charity. The programme involves a vote (from a shortlist) by students as to which charities the school will be supporting the following year. The money from events in that year then goes to the four chosen charities. Results A Level Results for 2012-2013 : 31% of the mainstream grades were A*s (2012: 30%), 74.23% were at A*-A (2012: 74%) and 94.6% were at A*-B (2012: 96%). Thirty boys sat the Pre-U Exam in Physics, 18 of whom were graded D2, the equivalent of an A*, and 10 of whom received the even higher D1 rating. Nearly all leavers secured places at an elite university and thirty one Oxbridge offers were confirmed. The School's results are significantly above the national figures and almost all Fifth Formers stay on in the Sixth Form. These are results for GCSE in 2012-13: 89.64% of the grades were A*s and As (2012: 91%), while the percentage of A* grades was 57.29% (2012: 56%). The national figure for A* grades for boys in 2013 was 5.3%. One boy achieved 11 A* grades, twenty achieved 10 and 14 achieved 9. A* grades accounted for over 57% of all grades awarded. There was a 99.89% A*-C grade pass rate. In Mathematics, Geography, History, English Language, English Literature, Modern Languages, Physics and Biology boys follow the more rigorous IGCSE courses. As well as GCSEs and IGCSEs, 94 boys sat the OCR Free Standing Mathematics Qualification. There is no A* grade for this qualification, but 85 boys received A grades. International aid Hampton School has for some years financed a link with Kiira College Butiki, a secondary school in Uganda. As well as regularly supporting international organisations as part of its general charity programme, it supports a safe haven for children at Senga Bay in Malawi. Hampton boys have regularly spent some of their gap years at either Kiira College or the Safe Haven. Sport =Rugby union= Former pupils include England Rugby sevens captain Simon Amor, Bath and England 'A' player Andy Beattie.. In the 2012‚Äì2013 season, the 1st XV reached the semi-final of the Daily Mail Cup, the furthest it has ever progressed, but narrowly lost 11‚Äì5 to Dulwich College. It also won the Jack Chester Memorial Cup. It was named Evening Standard Team of the Month in December 2012 and Rugby World Team of the Month in April 2013. In 2014 and 2015, the Hampton 1st XV reached the quarter-finals of the Natwest Cup, only to lose out to RGS High Wycombe and Dulwich College respectively. The school has close links with Premiership Academies such as London Irish, Harlequins and London Wasps, as well as four current pupils having played at England U16 schoolboy level. =Football= The school regularly takes part in national competitions, winning the Boodles ISFA Cup in 1999, 2007 and 2012 and reaching the final in 2005, 2009 and 2015. The U15 Team won the Investec ISFA Cup in 2012 and 2015, played at the Burton Albion FC stadium, and also the ISFA Fair Play Award ISFA Cup in 2012. In 2019, the U18 team won the English Schools' Football Association Cup, a competition in which almost every school with an U18 football team in England competes in. 364 teams, including the Hampton team, entered that year. =Cricket= The 1st XI frequently tours overseas countries such as Sri Lanka and India. In England, the 1st XI has regularly won the 50/40 League cup, a competition played amongst schools in London and surrounding areas, as well as having reached the final stages of the National Twenty20 competition. Age group teams have consistently won the Middlesex Cup and competed in later rounds of the Nationals. Leavers have gone on to play first-class cricket and two currently play at first-class counties: Toby Roland-Jones (Middlesex) and Zafar Ansari (Surrey). The school is also represented by the Old Hamptonians in the Cricketers' Cup/Trophy, an old boys' competition played by leavers of the top cricketing schools in the country in a knockout format. =Rowing= Hampton School Boat Club is one of the top school rowing clubs in the country and each year produces a 1st VIII that competes at Championship level in national school events. The boat club is based at the Millennium Boathouse which it shares with the Lady Eleanor Holles School. Rowing at Hampton is open to boys in the third year (Year 9) and above and the boat club competes at many races both at home and abroad. Hampton has produced three treble winning 1st VIIIs in its history and has been strongly represented at the World Rowing Junior Championships. Martin Cross, a history teacher there, is a gold medalist from the 1984 Olympics and won bronze in 1980. Many Old Hamptonians have gone on to compete at higher levels such as The Boat Race, the World Rowing Championships and the Olympic Games, with Greg Searle and Jonny Searle perhaps the most famous of those, winning gold in the coxed pair in Barcelona in 1992. In 2004 Hampton won 1st, 2nd and 3rd VIIIs at the Schools' Head of the River Race. In 2013, at the same race, they came first in the following categories; Championship VIII's, 2nd VIII's, 3rd VIII's, J16 Championship VIII's, J16 2nd VIII's, J15 2nd VIII's, and J15 3rd VIII's, winning a total of 63 gold medals.In 2012‚Äì13, Hampton was the top- performing school in both the School's Head of the River Race and the National Schools‚Äô Rowing Regatta, where all of the senior squad rowers won medals. The arts =Music= In addition to class music, nearly 400 boys receive instrumental tuition from visiting teachers. Guitarist Brian May of rock band Queen was a pupil at the school, as were bass player Paul Samwell-Smith and drummer Jim McCarty, later of The Yardbirds and guitarist and pianist Vic Briggs, later of Eric Burdon & The Animals.Vic Briggs Autobiography, Part 1, Antion - The Rock Star; antionmusic. Retrieved 2017-03-17. One pipe organ pupil at the school, Timothy Burke of The Mules, served as Organ Scholar at Exeter College, Oxford from 2001‚Äì2004. More recently, Lawrence Thain FRCO became Organ Scholar of New College, Oxford in 2008. There is a full Symphony Orchestra, as well as a String Orchestra, a Chamber Orchestra, Wind Band and two Jazz Bands. There are about thirty different music groups playing regularly. Frequent concerts provide performing opportunities for these groups, and for soloists and chamber groups. =Drama= Dramatic productions also range widely: a typical year might see a Shakespearean or classical play, many studio presentations including pupils' own work, a musical, and evenings of junior drama, with each Form in an entire year group putting on a play, or a whole year group involved in a major production, an excellent example being the \\"450th Musical,\\" a work designed to commemorate the schools 450th anniversary, which involved contributions from every year of the school, and was devised entirely by the 5th and 6th Forms. A Hampton School Theatre Company, \\"In Human Form\\", took its own play The London Thing, to the Edinburgh Festival in August 2000, and returned there in August 2001 with their play Lucky. A newly formed Theatre Company, \\"About Turn\\", took its first production to the Edinburgh Festival in August 2002 and returned in 2004. In 2008, the school (in association with Lady Eleanor Holles) performed Stephen Sondheim's \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\". The staging was highly elaborate, including props (such as chairs and razors) from original productions at the National Theatre. In August 2009 the group, as Artfelt Theatre Company, took this production (albeit in shortened, reduced orchestration form) to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.http://ed.thestage.co.uk/productions/1655 Hampton School hosted its very first annual Playwrights Festival in March 2014. This event consisted of the plays \\"Luther and Severus\\" (Aca Delic and Oliver Cook), \\"All There Is\\" (Thomas Millward), and \\"The Forecast\\" (Fergus Church). All three were written and directed by 5th and 6th formers, and performed by 4th to 6th formers from both LEH and Hampton. The event was organised by Lauren Bensted, and were performed in the 450 Hall or Drama Hall. Boys from Hampton School have also a long history of being heavily involved in the production of the newspaper of the National Student Drama Festival (Noises Off). Current alumni on the staff there are John Winterburn (Office Manager), Henry Ellis, Euan Forsyth and Ben Lander. The Hammond Theatre, which opened in 2015, was officially launched by TV and film actor, John Hannah. =Debating= A range of topics is addressed and boys of all ages are encouraged to participate, either as a main speaker or from the floor. Debates are held with the Lady Eleanor Holles School and teams are entered in national events, notably the Schools' Mace and the Oxford Union competition. =Writing= The School Magazine, The Lion, which is distributed free and is produced by an editorial team of pupils, led by a teacher. It is produced at the School on its own desktop publishing equipment and supplied for printing on disc. This magazine includes boys' creative and original writing. Boys, on their own initiative, also produce several student magazines, which offer much scope for creativity, and insights into life at Hampton. An arts magazine called The Lion Print is also issued on an annual basis. =Talk!= In September 2000 a lecture series \\"Talk!\\" was inaugurated. Since then over one hundred distinguished visiting speakers from the worlds of art, business, the media, politics and science have spoken and answered questions from large audiences. =Art= Hampton School encourages Art as a part of the curriculum. The Art Club provides facilities for work in a range of media with competitions for those interested. In 2000, new facilities for Art were opened: these consist of four art studios (one for the Sixth Form) including a suite of 15 iMacs; a kiln for production of ceramics; and a gallery for student and external exhibitions. In 2004 a further studio was added.

Giuseppina Strepponi (c. 1845) (Museo Teatrale alla Scala) Giuseppina Strepponi (c. 1865) Clelia Maria Josepha (Giuseppina) Strepponi (8 September 1815 - 14 November 1897) was a nineteenth-century Italian operatic soprano of great renown and the second wife of composer Giuseppe Verdi. She is often credited with having contributed to Verdi's first successes, starring in a number of his early operas, including the role of Abigaille in the world premiere of Nabucco in 1842. A highly gifted singer, Strepponi excelled in the bel canto repertoire and spent much of her career portraying roles in operas by Vincenzo Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti, and Gioachino Rossini, often sharing the stage with tenor and baritone Giorgio Ronconi. Donizetti wrote the title role of his opera Adelia specifically for Strepponi. She was described as possessing a \\"limpid, penetrating, smooth voice, seemly action, a lovely figure; and to Nature's liberal endowments she adds an excellent technique\\"; her \\"deep inner feeling\\" was also lauded.Budden 1998, pp. 582‚Äì583 Both her personal and professional life was complicated by overwork, by at least three known pregnancies, and by her vocal deterioration which caused her to retire from the stage by the age of 31, in 1846 when she moved to Paris to become a singing teacher. While it is known that she had a professional relationship with Verdi from the time of his first opera, Oberto in 1839, they became a couple by 1847 when they lived together in Paris, then moved to Busseto in 1849, married in 1859, and remained together until the end of her life. Early life Strepponi was born in the city of Lodi in the Lombard region of Italy. She was the oldest child of Rosa Cornalba and Feliciano Strepponi (1797‚Äì1832), who was the organist at Monza Cathedral and a moderately successful opera composer, his works having been performed in theatres in Milan, Turin and Trieste. Her first lessons in music were with her father who focused mainly on teaching her to play the piano, but in 1830 she was enrolled in the Milan Conservatory although just over the age of 15. After her father's death at the age of 35 in 1832 of encephalitis, she was able to continue studying singing and the piano as a non-paying pupil at the Conservatory where she notably won first prize for bel canto during her final year in 1834. Her performance of the cavatina from Beatrice di Tenda and for her parts in both a duet and a trio brought mention in the Gazzetta privilegiata di Milano of 29 September 1834, where it was noted that her vocal qualities, \\"will be a fine acquisition, when the time comes, for the Italian stage\\".Gazzetta, Milan, 29 September 1834, in Walker 1962, p. 51 Career as an opera singer =The 1830s= Giuseppina Strepponi in 1835 (Museo di La Scala) Baritone Giorgio Ronconi Tenor Napoleone Moriani Strepponi made her professional opera d√©but in December 1834 as Adria in Luigi Ricci's Chiara di Rosembergh at the Teatro Orfeo. She had her first major success during the following spring at the Teatro Grande in Trieste singing the title role in Rossini's Matilde di Shabran. This success quickly led to numerous engagements at major opera houses throughout Italy and Giuseppina soon became her family's major bread winner. In the summer of 1835, she went to Austria to sing Adalgisa in Bellini's Norma and Amina in Bellini's La sonnambula at the Theater am K√§rntnertor in Vienna where she was praised highly by audiences and critics. Although she was highly talented, she never sang outside Italy after 1835. Strepponi became a celebrity among opera singers during the late 1830s, arousing fanatical enthusiasm in performances throughout Italy. In 1836 she sang the roles of Ninetta in Rossini's La gazza ladra, Elvira in Bellini's I puritani, and the title role in Rossini's La Cenerentola at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice. Impresario Alessandro Lanari In Spring 1837, she went under contract with Alessandro Lanari of Florence, then known as \\"the king of impresarios\\", who was able to secure important engagements for her in the years following. However, within a very short time, she found herself pregnant and had to sing through three pregnancies during the time with Lanari. That same year she reprised the role of Elvira and portrayed the roles of Elena in Donizetti's Marino Faliero and the title role in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. In 1838 she sang the title roles in Donizetti's Maria di Rudenz, Bellini's Beatrice di Tenda, and Carlo Coccia's Caterina di Guisa at the Imperial Regio Teatro degli Avvalorati in Livorno. She made her La Scala debut in 1839, replacing Antonietta Marini-Rainieri, who was found unsuitable in the work's premiere performance, as Leonora in the first production of Giuseppe Verdi's first opera Oberto. Strepponi's performance was considered one of the strongest aspects of this production and one of the main reasons that the work was received well. Other notable roles for Strepponi during the late 1830s include Elaisa in Saverio Mercadante's Il giuramento, Adina in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore and Sandrina in Luigi Ricci's Un'avventura di Scaramuccia. However, the record of constant performances over several years has invited speculation about what that might have done to the quality of her voice in later years. =The 1840s= Giuseppina Strepponi (c. 1840) Returning to Milan for rehearsals of Nabucco, she claimed that illness would prevent future performances in Vienna and asked to be relieved of that obligation. Lanari ordered a complete medical examination which concluded that she had \\"reached the limits of her endurance\\" and that she would be obliged to give up her career or else she would become a consumptive.Phillips-Matz 1993, pp. 125 She persisted with Nabucco, singing all eight performances of Verdi's opera: in her words to Lanari, \\"I dragged myself to the end of the performances\\" and then told him that she had the possibility of an offer of marriage from a man who would only do so if she were free from contractual obligations. The doctors' conclusions would allow her to do that, but it took her more than a year to recover. Strepponi continued to remain a highly popular singer during the early 1840s. She notably sang the title role in Donizetti's Adelia in 1841 at the Teatro Apollo in Rome, a role written specifically for her by the composer. This was followed by a critically acclaimed portrayal as Abigaille in the world premiere of Verdi's Nabucco at La Scala in 1842. She reprised the role of Abigaille in several opera houses throughout Italy the following year, including the Teatro Regio di Parma and the Teatro Comunale di Bologna, which considerably aided the work's popularity. Also in 1843, she sang the roles of Elisabetta in Donizetti's Roberto Devereux and Imogene in Bellini's Il pirata in Bologna. Other notable roles for Strepponi during the early 1840s included the title role in Bellini's Norma, the Marchesa del Poggio in Verdi's Un giorno di regno, and the title role in Giovanni Pacini's Saffo. Around 1844, Strepponi began to experience significant vocal problems, most likely brought on by her relentless performing schedule, which culminated in a disastrous season in Palermo in 1845, where she was booed by audiences. Her voice never recovered and she thereafter appeared only sporadically in operas until her retirement in February 1846. Most of her last performances were in operas by Verdi, including performances of Elvira in Ernani and Lucrezia Contarini in I due Foscari. =Strepponi's children= Camillo Cirelli (whom Verdi had met while a student of Lavigna's some years before) was one of a group of three theatrical agents under Lanari who took responsibility for Strepponi from Milan after the early months of 1837. He also engaged her for the Teatro San Benedetto in Venice, but it was not uncommon for her to work under other impresarios. However, she became pregnant around March/April 1837 and she stopped singing only about a month before her first child, Camillo Luifi Antonio was born in Turin in January 1838 and baptised as \\"Sterponi\\" (sic). From her performance records of these two years, Frank Walker corroborates the fact that she was absent from the stage for about three months,Walker 1962, p. 51 and then began another hectic round of performances under an exclusive contract with Lanari announced in February 1838.Walker 1962, p. 61 Cirelli believed that he was the father, although Frank Walker states that he proved to be a very good friend and that \\"it is possible that he had been Camillino's godfather, and given him his Christian name\\".Walker 1962, p. 66 However, sometime in the Spring of 1838, Strepponi became pregnant again and, in Florence on 9 February 1839, she gave birth to her second child, Giuseppina Fausta, only a few hours after completing a performance at the Teatro Alfieri and before leaving for an engagement in Venice. The child was placed in the turnstile for abandoned infants at the Ospedale degli Innocenti in Florence under the name of \\"Sinforosa Cirelli\\". These children were known as the esposti, \\"the exposed\\", or as described by Phillips-Matz, \\"society's trash\\".Phillips-Matz 1993, p. 122 Cirelli, who had returned to Milan, initially denied paternity, believing that she had taken another lover.Phillips-Matz 1993, p. 121, states that \\"she took another lover, who, she thought, got her pregnant\\" But Cirelli then accepted paternity when the child was born prematurely and there was no time for her to be taken to somewhere private for the birth. Impresario Bartolomeo Merelli In late 1838, Lanari and Bartolomeo Merelli, the impresario of La Scala, had negotiated for Strepponi, Moriani, and Ronconi to appear in La Scala for the following spring season, but they had both been horrified to find out in early January that she was five months pregnant,Merrelli to Lanari, 16 January 1839, in Walker 1962, p. 64 and that this would cause her to be unavailable. But in February 1839 in Florence, she sang in Il giuramento with such dramatic intensity that it appears to have caused her to miscarry and, by necessity, withdraw from further performances for some time. Increasingly pressured by Lanari, she finally relented to appear at La Fenice, where she was a triumph in March. By April 1839 she was in Milan to fulfill those engagements, and her La Scala debut in I Puritani on 20th was another triumph.Walker 1962, pp. 65‚Äî67 By March 1840, it appears that she may have given birth to a stillborn girl since Phillips-Matz notes that a combination of time taken out of her working schedule corresponds to around the 22 March records showing parents abandoning her in the parish in which she lived. Performances in Florence in March and early April 1841 in I Puritani were the last which Strepponi gave with both Ronconi and Moriani, the latter then leaving for Vienna and Dresden, she and Ronconi going on to the other Italian towns. Later in the year, as the 1841‚Äì42 season was being planned, Walker states that \\"she knew quite well that she would not be able to carry out the whole of this programme, for she was again pregnant.\\"Walker 1962, p. 76 During the following few months, letters between Strepponi and Lanari, in whom she had clearly confided, reveal the existence of \\"the despicable M ...\\" (and in another letter, he is \\"Mr. Mo..\\"), and she asks that he \\"kindly remind him of the important sum of money that through your offices he has agreed to pay.\\"Strepponi to Lanari, 8 August 1841, in Walker 1962, pp. 76‚Äî77 On 16 August she writes again to Lanari, stating that \\"I have been too cruelly treated under the mantle of love ... But I do not wish him ill\\"Strepponi to Lanari, 16 August 1841, in Walker 1962, p. 77 All of Frank Walker's investigations, using letters and performance histories of the different people involved in her life, put Strepponi together with only one man at the time that the three children must have been conceived. He concludes that it is the only man who must have been the father of the first two children, and who was then the prospective father of the third: it is Napoleone Moriani.Walker 1962, p. 88: Walker asks: \\"Who was it? There can only be one answer‚ÄîNAPOLEONE MORIANI\\" Giuseppina had given birth to a girl in Trieste on 4 November 1841, Adelina Rosa Maria Carolina Strepponi. It appears that she then left the baby with a couple, the Vianellos, who took in illegitimate children. However, the child died of dysentery on 4 October 1842.Phillips-Matz 1993, pp. 123‚Äî124 Strepponi left for Venice with Cirelli with whom she had been living in Milan as a common law wife. An early 20th century biography of Verdi, as well as one written in 1938 about Strepponi's life by Mercede Mandula, both propose that Strepponi became Merelli's lover in the early 1840s and it is claimed that this relationship resulted in another illegitimate child.Kutch and Riemens 1969, p. 487 However, this account is vehemently disputed by both Frank Walker, who declares \\"but it is not true: it is fiction\\",Walker 1962, p. 51‚Äî56: in these pages he lays out a detailed performance history as well as biographer Gabriele Baldini, who states \\"that it is certain that Giuseppina was not Merelli's lover, that she had no sons by him ...\\".Baldini 1980, p. 145 Verdi's biographer, Mary Jane Phillips-Matz, in her account of Strepponi's life both before and after becoming Verdi's partner and then his wife, lays out in detail the singer's history up to the time of Nabucco and her investigations have produced no evidence of the accuracy of the early scenario.Phillips-Matz 1993, pp. 118‚Äî127 Retirement in Paris =With Verdi, 1847 to 1849= In October 1846 Strepponi moved to Paris and became a singing teacher. She came out of her stage retirement briefly for one last opera appearance at the Com√©die-Italienne which was not well received. Verdi, who was in England for the premiere of his opera I masnadieri in July 1847, returned via Paris and the two began a romantic relationship, with the composer remaining there for two years (albeit with short periods in Italy to firstly return to Milan in April 1848 after the nationalistic uprising there and then to oversee a production of his new opera in Rome, La battaglia di Legnano in early 1849. See \\"Verdi's relationship with Giuseppina Strepponi\\", Paris 1847 to 1849 Return to Italy with Verdi, July 1849 Palazzo Orlandi, 56 Via Roma in Busseto Villa Sant'Agata (Villa Verdi) Sant'Agata The couple returned to Italy by July 1849 and began living together in Busseto, Verdi's hometown where they first lived at the Palazzo Orlandi. The reaction of many of the people of Busseto towards Giuseppina, a woman of the theatre living openly with the composer in an unmarried state concerned Verdi, and as such, she was shunned in the town and at church.Walker 1962, pp. 197‚Äî198 While Verdi could \\"treat the Bussetani with contempt ... Giuseppina, in the next few years, suffered greatly.\\" From May 1851 they moved to Verdi's house in Sant'Agata just outside the town, which today is known as the Villa Verdi. Although unmarried until 1859, the couple remained together for the rest of their lives and she supported her husband in his career in many ways, her knowledge of French and English being especially useful. It is even thought that it was she who translated the original play by Antonio Garc√≠a Guti√©rrez, El trovador of 1836, which became Il trovatore in 1853. Julian Budden notes that a letter from her to Verdi two weeks before the premiere urges him to \\"hurry up and give OUR [her caps] Trovatore\\".Strepponi to Verdi, 3 January 1853, in Budden 1984, Vol. 2, p. 59. Her emphasis on the \\"OUR\\". In other respects, she offered him much advice and, as Walker recalls from her account of being curled up in an armchair nearby, all the while offering comments and criticism while Verdi was composing, he speculates that \\"she must have sung many of these world-famous melodies for the first time from the manuscript sketches.\\"Walker 1962, p. 212 At one point he took her advice not to have to compose on order by a certain date, but to find a suitable subject, then compose the music at his own convenience, and then find a suitable venue and suitable singers, and he so informed Corticelli, the theatrical agent from Bologna. Their marriage was happy and Verdi was deeply saddened by her death at Sant'Agata in 1897. The last years Giuseppina Strepponi, last portrait, 1897 Grave of Giuseppina Strepponi in Milan In 1894, Verdi and his wife made their last trip to Paris. Hungarian writer Dezs≈ë Szomori, who knew them at that time, then described Verdi as a man with small eyes and next to him a woman, Giuseppina, who looked more like an old bird, but ultimately concluded: \\"a beautiful and charming couple who grew up together and grow old in the music world.\\"T√∂bben 2003, p. ?? In those years, Strepponi frequently suffered from stomach problems and arthritis and during her last year of life she could barely move from her bed. In the autumn of 1897, when the couple was once again preparing to spend the winter in Genoa in a more salubrious climate with proximity to the sea, Verdi made the decision to stay in Sant'Agata because his wife was bedridden. Giuseppina Strepponi died after a long illness on 14 November that year at Sant'Agata, due to pneumonia. She was initially buried in Milan. With the death of Giuseppina, Verdi became a widower for the second time, and was once again tormented by the pain of losing one of the most important figures in his life. When Verdi died in 1901 he left instructions in his will to be buried next to Giuseppina, but he was buried in the main cemetery of Milan. The desire to see the couple together in the afterlife eventually led on 26 February 1901 to the transfer of both of their bodies to the oratory of the Casa di Riposo in Milan, the retirement home for musicians which Verdi had created. Arturo Toscanini directed a choir of 900 singers in the famous Va, pensiero from Nabucco. Depictions in mediaAfter Aida: Strepponi is one of the main characters in Julian Mitchell's 1985 play-with- music, which focuses on Verdi's life and compositions after 1879 and in persuading him to compose Otello *Risorgimento!

The party's aim was to ensure that the Government of British Columbia has in place the procedures necessary to maintain a legitimate position of authority over the commercial sector in BC. In particular, it sought to ensure that the government's employees have sworn and signed an oath; deposited a security, money, property, or bond with or without securities; and are covered by a lawful liability insurance carrier. The party argued that without the above, no agent can lawfully claim to perform the duties with which they have been empowered. It was also concerned that there is a lack of adequate checks and balances where a government employee is cited for civil abuse.

The media used may include the digital equivalent of film techniques , stills, audio only, or any of the other forms of non-physical media (material that exists only as electronic files as opposed to actual paintings or photographs on paper, sounds stored on tape or disc, movies stored on film) which individuals can use to tell a story or present an idea. Introduction \\"Digital storytelling\\" is a relatively new term which describes the new practice of everyday people who use digital tools to tell their 'story'. Digital stories often present in compelling and emotionally engaging formats, and can be interactive. The term \\"digital storytelling\\" can also cover a range of digital narratives (web-based stories, interactive stories, hypertexts, and narrative computer games); It is sometimes used to refer to film-making in general, and as of late, it has been used to describe advertising and promotion efforts by commercial and non- profit enterprises. One can define digital storytelling as the process by which diverse peoples share their life stories and creative imaginings with others. This newer form of storytelling emerged with the advent of accessible media production techniques, hardware and software, including but not limited to digital cameras, digital voice recorders, iMovie, Microsoft Photos, Final Cut Express and WeVideo. These new technologies allow individuals to share their stories over the Internet on YouTube, Vimeo, compact discs, podcasts, and other electronic distribution systems. One can think of digital storytelling as the modern extension of the ancient art of storytelling, now interwoven with digitized still and moving images and sound. Thanks to new media and digital technologies, individuals can approach storytelling from unique perspectives. Many people use elaborate non-traditional story forms, such as non-linear and interactive narratives. Simply put, digital stories are multimedia presentations that combine a variety of communicative elements within a narrative structure. Media may include any combination of the following: text, images, video, audio, social media elements (like tweets), or interactive elements (like maps). Digital stories may be used as an expressive medium within the classroom to integrate subject matter with extant knowledge and skills from across the curriculum. Students can work individually or collaboratively to produce their own digital stories. Once completed, these stories can easily be uploaded to the internet and can be made available to an international audience, depending on the topic and purpose of the project. Development and pioneers The broad definition has been used by many artists and producers to link what they do with traditions of oral storytelling and often to distinguish their work from slick or commercial projects by focusing on authorship and humanistic or emotionally provocative content. Digital Storytelling has been used by Ken Burns, in the documentary The Civil War, cited as one of the first models of this genre. In his documentary, Burns used first-person accounts that served to reveal the heart and emotions of this tragic event in American history, as well as narration, archival images, modern cinematography, and music (Sylvester & Greenidge, 2009). Some of the other artists who have described themselves as digital storytellers are the late Dana Atchley, his collaborator Joe Lambert, Abbe Don, Brenda Laurel, and Pedro Meyer. The \\"short narrated films\\" definition of digital storytelling comes from a production workshop by Dana Atchley at the American Film Institute in 1993 that was adapted and refined by Joe Lambert in the mid-1990s into a method of training promoted by the San Francisco Bay Area-based StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling). At StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling), digital stories are produced in intensive workshops. The product is a short film that combines a narrated piece of personal writing, photographic and other still images, and a musical soundtrack. Technology enables those without a technical background to produce works that tell a story using \\"moving\\" images and sound. The lower processing and memory requirements for using stills as compared with video, and the ease with which the so-called \\"Ken Burns\\" pan effect can be produced with online or regular video editing software, have made it easy to create aesthetic but short films. Digital storytelling was integrated into public broadcasting by the BBC's Capture Wales project working with organisations such as Breaking Barriers. The following year a similar project was launched by the BBC in England titled Telling Lives. Sveriges Utbildningsradio created Rum f√∂r Ber√§ttande (Room for Storytelling). Netherlands Educational TV Teleac/NOT created a program with young people in different parts of the country. KQED, Rocky Mountain PBS, WETA and other public television stations in the US have developed projects. Digital storytelling is evolving from the simple narrated video to forms that are interactive and look better. These include websites and online videos created to promote causes, entertain, educate, and inform audiences. Components The most important characteristics of a digital story are that it no longer conforms to the traditional conventions of storytelling because it is capable of combining still imagery, moving imagery, sound, and text, as well as being nonlinear and contain interactive features. The expressive capabilities of technology offers a broad base from which to integrate. It enhances the experience for both the author and audience and allows for greater interactivity. With the arrival of new media devices like computers, digital cameras, recorders, smart phones, and software, individuals may share their digital stories via the Internet, on discs, podcasts, or other electronic media. Digital storytelling combines the art of storytelling with multimedia features such as photography, text, audio, voiceover, hypertext and video. Digital tools and software make it easy and convenient to create a digital story. Common software includes iMovie and Microsoft Photos for user-friendly options. There are other online options and free applications as well such as WeVideo. Educators often identify the benefit of digital storytelling as the array of technical tools from which students may select for their creative expression. Learners set out to use these tools in new ways to make meaningful content. Students learn new software, choose images, edit video, make voice-over narration, add music, create title screens, and control flow and transitions. Additionally, there is opportunity to insert interactive features for \\"reader\\" participation. It is possible to click on imagery or text in order to choose what will happen next, cause an event to occur, or navigate to online content. Additionally, distinctions may be drawn between Web 2.0 storytelling and that of digital storytelling. Web 2.0 storytelling is said to produce a network of connections via social networking, blogging, and YouTube that transcends beyond the traditional, singular flow of digital storytelling. It tends to \\"aggregate large amounts of microcontent and creatively select patterns out of an almost unfathomable volume of information,\\" therefore the bounds of Web 2.0 storytelling are not necessarily clear. Another form of digital storytelling is the micromovie, which is \\"a very short exposition lasting from a few seconds to no more than 5 minutes in length. It allows the teller to combine personal writing, photographic images or video footage, narrative, sound effects, and music. Many people, regardless of skill level, are able to tell their stories through image and sound and share those stories with others.\\" Telling a digital story combines a narrative, whether it be fiction or non fiction, personal or general, and digital media. Digital media includes imaging, video, sound and all other forms of media then can be portrayed visually, the most simple of digital stories can even be a power point. The point is to convey a message through imagery, which a lot of times can be more effective then if just conveyed through sound. Another outlet for digital storytelling can be articulated through some social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram, where one might be constantly posting images accompanied by captions in order to portray the story of one's life. \\"A story can be as short as explaining how one misplaced one's keys in the morning or as long as a multivolume autobiography.\\" The wonderful thing about telling a digital story is that there really are no rules. However, there are certain guidelines that are tried and true over time that make up better stories. The most important rule is don't be boring, tell a good story and the \\"truth\\" of a \\"story\\" lies in a process not the content. Joe Lambert and others who work at Storycenter and other places around the world train people in how to improve their stories during digital storytelling workshops by writing out the story and discussing many options of connecting with the material before recording it in a digital format and editing it into video. When one wants to capture the attention of one's audience, it is important to be passionate about the themes and or characters when telling any story. In order to sell the story, regardless of the medium, the artist may need to ask oneself about what stories could be more compelling before relating the story to others. Some of the best stories begin with one's own personal insights in order to find an interesting and profound dramatic story. Uses in education The StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) model has also been adopted in education, especially in the US, sometimes as a method of building engagement and multimedia literacy. For example, the Bay Area Video Coalition and Youthworx Media Melbourne, the UK social enterprise Noise Solution Noise Solution and the Belgian non-profit Maks vzw employ digital storytelling to engage and empower young people at risk. =Uses in primary and secondary education= \\"The idea of merging traditional storytelling with today's digital tools is spreading worldwide.\\" Anybody today with a computer can create a digital story simply by answering such questions as \\"What do you think? What do you feel? What is important? How do we find meaning in our lives?\\" Most digital stories focus on a specific topic and contain a particular point of view. \\"These topics can range from personal tales to the recounting of historical events, from exploring life in one's own community to the search for life in other corners of the universe and every story in between.\\" For primary grades the focus is related to what is being taught, a story that will relate to the students. For primary grades the story is kept under five minutes to retain attention. Vibrant pictures, age-appropriate music and narration are needed. Narration accompanied by subtitles can also help build vocabulary. Content-related digital stories can help upper- elementary and middle-school students understand abstract or layered concepts. For example, in one 5th grade class a teacher used digital storytelling to depict the anatomy of the eye and describe its relationship to a camera. A fifth grader said, \\"This year I have learned that places are not just physical matter but emotional places in peoples' hearts. iMovie has made all my thoughts and feelings come alive in an awesome movie.\\" These aspects of digital storytelling, pictures, music, and narration reinforce ideas and appeal to different learning types. Teachers can use it to introduce projects, themes, or any content area, and can also let their students make their own digital stories and then share them. Teachers can create digital stories to help facilitate class discussions, as an anticipatory set for a new topic, or to help students gain a better understanding of more abstract concepts. These stories can become an integral part of any lesson in many subject areas. Students can also create their own digital stories and the benefits that they can receive from it can be quite plentiful. Through the creation of these stories students are required to take ownership of the material they are presenting. They have to analyze and synthesize information as well. All of this supports higher-level thinking. Students are able to give themselves a voice through expressing their own thoughts and ideas. When students are able to participate in the multiple steps of designing, creating and presenting their own digital stories, they can build several literacy skills. These include the following: Research skills by finding and analyzing information when documenting the story, writing skills when developing a script, and organization skills by managing the scope of the project within a time constraint. Learning about the use of technology is a skill that can be gained through learning to use a variety of tools, such as digital cameras and multimedia authoring software and presentation skills through the presentation of the story to an audience. Students also gain interview, interpersonal, problem-solving and assessment skills through completing their digital story and learning to receive and give constructive criticism. Software such as iMovie or Microsoft Photos do all that is required. Faculty and graduate students at the University of Houston have created a website, The Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling, which focuses on the use of digital storytelling by teachers and their students across multiple content areas and grade levels. The National Writing Project has a collaboration with the Pearson Foundation examining the literacy practices, the values, attitudes, beliefs and feelings, associated with their digital storytelling work with students. =Use by teachers in curriculum= > Teachers can incorporate digital storytelling into their instruction for > several reasons. Two reasons include 1) to incorporate multimedia into their > curriculum and 2) teachers can also introduce storytelling in combination > with social networking in order to increase global participation, > collaboration, and communication skills. Moreover, digital storytelling is a > way to incorporate and teach the twenty-first century student the twenty- > first century technology skills such as information literacy, visual > literacy, global awareness, communication and technology literacy. The educational goals for teachers using digital storytelling are to generate interest, attention and motivation for students of the \\"digital generation\\" in classrooms. The use of digital storytelling as a presentation tool also appeals to the diverse learning styles of students. Digital storytelling also capitalizes on students' creative talents and allows their work to be published on the Internet for others to view and critique. A handful of teachers around the world have embraced digital storytelling from a mobile platform. The use of small handheld devices allows teachers and students to create short digital stories without the need for expensive editing software. iOS devices are the norm nowadays and mobile digital storytelling applications like The Fold Game have introduced an entirely new set of tools for the classroom. With an emphasis on collaborative learning and hands on teaching, this website offers an in-depth look at how to integrate 21st-century skills with the objectives of a rigorous academic program: https://web.archive.org/web/20141105023109/http://nafcollaborationnetwork.org/curriculum- instruction/ci-pbl-ds.html =Uses in higher education= Digital storytelling spread in higher education in the late nineties with StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) collaborating with a number of Universities while based at UC Berkeley. StoryCenter programs with the New Media Consortium led to links to many campuses where programs in digital storytelling have grown; these include University of Maryland Baltimore, Cal State Monterey, Ohio State University, Williams College, MIT, and the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The University of Colorado, Denver, Kean University, Virginia Tech, Simmons College, Swarthmore College, the University of Calgary, University of Massachusetts (Amherst), the Maricopa County Community Colleges (AZ), and others have developed programs.. The University of Utah offered its first class on digital storytelling (Writing 3040) in the Fall of 2010. The program has grown from 10 students the first semester to over 30 in 2011, including 5 graduate students. Chicago journalist Mark Tatge started a Digital Storytelling program at DePauw University in 2011. Students learned journalistic-style storytelling techniques and published the resulting stories on a class website. The distribution of digital storytelling among humanities faculty connected with the American Studies Crossroads Project was a further evolution through a combination of both personal and academic storytelling. Starting in 2001, Rina Benmayor (from California State University-Monterey Bay) hosted a StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) seminar and began using digital storytelling in her Latino/a life stories classes. Benmayor began sharing that work with faculty across the country involved in the Visible Knowledge Project including Georgetown University; LaGuardia Community College, CUNY; Millersville University; Vanderbilt University, and University of Wisconsin‚ÄìStout. Out of this work emerged publications in several key academic journals as well as the Digital Storytelling Multimedia Archive. Ball State University has a masters program in digital storytelling based in the Telecommunications Department, as does the University of Oslo.http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/imk/MEVIT4130/index.xml In 2011, the University of Mary Washington launched an open online course in digital storytelling titled DS106. The course includes credit-seeking students at the University as well as many open, online participants from around the world. Digital storytelling is also used as an instructional strategyLowenthal, P. R. (2009). Digital storytelling‚ÄîAn emerging institutional technology? In J. Hartley & K. McWilliam (Eds.), Story circle: Digital storytelling around the world (pp. 252-259). Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell. to not only build relationships and establish people's social presence online but also as an alternative format to present content.Lowenthal, P. R., & Dunlap, J. (2010). From pixel on a screen to real person in your students' lives: Establishing social presence using digital storytelling. The Internet and Higher Education. Digital storytelling in higher education can also be used for scholarly communication. Higher education students at the graduate and undergraduate level create scholarly digital stories based on their academic research across disciplines, including American studies, anthropology, history, industrial design, and international studies. =Uses in public health, healthcare, social services, and international development= \\"Day Walker\\" was Welcome's nickname in the Sonke Gender Justice \\"One Man Can\\" campaign tackling HIV and gender-based violence. The development of the Silence Speaks project in 1999 under the direction of Amy Hill (who joined the StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) in 2005) led to the expansion of digital storytelling in public health. Projects developed with the Centers for Disease Control, the Open Society Foundation, work in gender-based violence prevention with groups in California, Texas, New York, Minnesota, and with the organization Sonke Gender Justice in South Africa, the broad use of digital storytelling with Foster Youth, and finally the connection to digital storytelling to public campaigns in substance abuse prevention and community mental health programs. Digital storytelling is being used to raise awareness of the \\"human\\" factors in healthcare. The Patient Voices programme is the product of Pip Hardy and Tony Sumner. Established in 2003, their project provides a means for people (patients, families or healthcare workers) to tell their stories which might affect clinicians, managers and decision-makers in the healthcare arena. The Programme has worked closely with The Royal College of Nursing, The National Clinical Governance Support Team, The National Audit Office, NHS England, NHS Improving Quality, Imperial College Healthcare Trust, Kings College London, University College London and many other NHS organisations and universities. Patient Voices projects have also taken place in Canada, Australia, Norway, Hong Kong and Tanzania and the stories are used in schools of medicine and healthcare throughout the world to prompt reflection and stimulate discussion and debate. The Patient Voices programme also provides a freely accessible resource to anyone who desires to improve the quality of health and social care. All stories, once released, are available at The Patient Voices. The stories have contributed to an understanding of patients' experiences and their role in their illness as well as to a greater understanding of the experience of people who work in healthcare.Haigh, C. and Hardy, P. (2010) Tell me a story: a conceptual exploration of storytelling in healthcare. Nurse Education Today In addition, the process of creating a Patient Voices digital story has been used to enhance the reflective skills of newly qualified nurses and medical students.Stacey, G., & Hardy, P. (2010). Challenging the shock of reality through digital storytelling. Nurse Education in Practice = Use In therapy = Digital Storytelling is also being used as therapy. Kim Anderson, who has a Ph.D. in licensed clinical social work has worked with Digital Storytelling with clients suffering from domestic violence, abuse, incest, and other traumatic psychological situations. Her work was used at the University of Southern California, the Zur Institute, and in numerous other publications including one in a chapter in a book on film/video-based therapy while teaching at the University of Southern Florida. =Uses in museums= Digital storytelling is being used by many different museums. The largest project, Culture Shock!, is currently taking place in the North East of England. This project is using museum and gallery collections to inspire people to create their own digital stories, which are also being added to the relevant museum collections. Another large-scale project is the work of the Australian Centre for the Moving Image. The National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. also held a series of classes to integrate arts education curriculum with digital storytelling from 2003-2005. Some museums help interpret and make community history accessible. In 2007, the Colorado Historical Society collaborated with StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) to create a program, The Italians, about Italian American History. In 2008, a group of eleven museums in Yorkshire launched My Yorkshire, a digital storytelling project. The museums work with communities to use contemporary collected oral histories alongside those from archives to interpret local history from a personal point of view, through the use of historical oral recordings and archival photos. The group has also produced help guides to creating digital stories in a museum setting. Finished digital stories can have many uses: advertising an upcoming exhibition, preserving a short-term project, building relations with communities. They provide skills to volunteers and can be permanently displayed in galleries. =Uses for religious training= In 2005, the Church of Norway initiated a project wherein young people raised questions of faith and life in short biographical mini-films called 'Digital Faith Stories'. A study of this project in a congregation near Oslo found that the method of 'Digital Storytelling' could contribute to a more systematic educational method for including the lifeworld of the young in religious training. Uses in libraries A digital story station is a public space for people to create a digital story that serves to archive oral histories from the public perspective. These oral stories may focus on a personal experience, incident, describing a place or witnessing an event. Based on the StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) model, over 30 public libraries ranging from Northern down the coast to Southern California have a place for people to tell their own story. Bilingual library staff work with participants to create a recording using the digital station, which can be integrated with a variety of media, including audio, video, pictures, and images. The digital storytelling station project called California of the Past is funded by a grant from the California State Library, U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services and Technology Act, and administered in California by librarians. The Media Arts Center in San Diego facilitates this project. Since 2006, San Diego has housed a story station in its downtown library. The Media Arts Center of San Diego partnered with the downtown public library to set up a story station where the public can create a three-minute video. The topics of the archived videos range from personal to historical documentaries. Uses in business With the development of marketing in the digital world is digital storytelling implemented in business. Digital storytelling is used as a tool of user- generated content, when consumers contribute their opinion based on their own experiences about a product to promote a firm's product in the digital world. Digital storytelling is being used by innovative startups to pitch their ideas to the potential investors and to communicate with potential customers to get feedback about the market potential of their product or service. The Enterprise Center with Salem State University organized a Big Idea Video Pitch Contest competition for students to submit a 60-second video pitch of a unique idea for a business, non-profit or social cause. People could vote once per day using the \\"vote now\\" button that is displayed in the voting section. The Digital Story that receives the most votes was awarded. Videos were judged on originality, creativity, and the clarity of message. Project SomePitching is a crowdsourced online competition for new business ideas and early stage startups to provide feedback on their product and business ideas. The freeform explanation could be a website, a short pitching video or an animation (max. 90 seconds), a slideset (max. 5 pages with font size 20+), or any other material (or combination of materials) that was short and clear for anyone to evaluate. SomePitching used the Innopinion platform to manage the idea rating process and the selection of winners based on the ratings from both the public and professional jury. The intent of this competition wasn't to present the best Big Idea of the product, service, or solution only, but also to find the way, how to interpret it by Digital Story the best way from visual and narrative point of view. Because in the public jury phase, the evaluations was based on the following categories (with percent of the final score): *Interest to buy or use the solution (20%) *The importance of the problem the solution solves (20%) *The value the solution brings (20%) *The clarity and quality of the material (20%) Place-based digital storytelling The Canadian Film Centre's New Media Lab (formerly MediaLinx Habitat) launched a project, Murmur, out of the 2002‚Äì2003 studio. The project integrates audio interviews into cellphone-based tours. StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) created Storymapping.org in 2006 with projects in Mendocino (California), Houston, New Orleans, and Tuscaloosa (Alabama) to promote the connection between storytelling and issues of local memory and civic planning. The Voice Library (TVL) launched two, ongoing, social-giving projects in 2014. The Military Families Story Project, based out of Portsmouth, NH, maintains and strengthens families' ties, builds morale through a brother-/sisterhood network, enables service men and women and their families to record history as they make it, and memorializes veterans' experiences. TVL's national Let Me Be Your Memory project, in collaboration with Cognitive Dynamics, offers a unique, six-week audio-based archiving Language Arts curriculum for students and educational institutions that builds multiple, Common Core-adaptable competencies by raising awareness of those living with memory disorders and their caregivers. It stimulates students to learn, investigate, and connect with family and community. The Voice Library changes the digital storytelling paradigm by providing users passcode-protected access through any telephone technology. It also provides online access. Both combine audio and still-image capability. For 24/7, global access, unlike social media, subscribers' private accounts are secured on the company's server.

Informally, the lemma immediately gives a precise sense in which finitely generated modules over a commutative ring behave like vector spaces over a field. It is an important tool in algebraic geometry, because it allows local data on algebraic varieties, in the form of modules over local rings, to be studied pointwise as vector spaces over the residue field of the ring. The lemma is named after the Japanese mathematician Tadashi Nakayama and introduced in its present form in , although it was first discovered in the special case of ideals in a commutative ring by Wolfgang Krull and then in general by Goro Azumaya (1951).; In the commutative case, the lemma is a simple consequence of a generalized form of the Cayley‚ÄìHamilton theorem, an observation made by Michael Atiyah (1969). The special case of the noncommutative version of the lemma for right ideals appears in Nathan Jacobson (1945), and so the noncommutative Nakayama lemma is sometimes known as the Jacobson‚ÄìAzumaya theorem. The latter has various applications in the theory of Jacobson radicals. Statement Let R be a commutative ring with identity 1. The following is Nakayama's lemma, as stated in : Statement 1: Let I be an ideal in R, and M a finitely-generated module over R. If IM = M, then there exists an r ‚àà R with r ‚â° 1 (mod I), such that rM = 0\\\\. This is proven below. The following corollary is also known as Nakayama's lemma, and it is in this form that it most often appears.; Statement 2: If M is a finitely-generated module over R, J(R) is the Jacobson radical of R, and J(R)M = M, then M = 0\\\\. :Proof: r ‚àí 1 (with r as above) is in the Jacobson radical so r is invertible. More generally, one has that J(R)M is a superfluous submodule of M when M is finitely-generated. Statement 3: If M is a finitely-generated module over R, N is a submodule of M, and M = N + J(R)M, then M = N. :Proof: Apply Statement 2 to M/N. The following result manifests Nakayama's lemma in terms of generators. Statement 4: If M is a finitely-generated module over R and the images of elements m1,...,mn of M in M / J(R)M generate M / J(R)M as an R-module, then m1,...,mn also generate M as an R-module. :Proof: Apply Statement 3 to N = Œ£iRmi. If one assumes instead that R is complete and M is separated with respect to the I-adic topology for an ideal I in R, this last statement holds with I in place of J(R) and without assuming in advance that M is finitely generated. Here separatedness means that the I-adic topology satisfies the T1 separation axiom, and is equivalent to \\\\textstyle{\\\\bigcap_{k=1}^\\\\infty I^k M = 0.} Consequences =Local rings= In the special case of a finitely generated module M over a local ring R with maximal ideal m, the quotient M/mM is a vector space over the field R/m. Statement 4 then implies that a basis of M/mM lifts to a minimal set of generators of M. Conversely, every minimal set of generators of M is obtained in this way, and any two such sets of generators are related by an invertible matrix with entries in the ring. In this form, Nakayama's lemma takes on concrete geometrical significance. Local rings arise in geometry as the germs of functions at a point. Finitely generated modules over local rings arise quite often as germs of sections of vector bundles. Working at the level of germs rather than points, the notion of finite-dimensional vector bundle gives way to that of a coherent sheaf. Informally, Nakayama's lemma says that one can still regard a coherent sheaf as coming from a vector bundle in some sense. More precisely, let F be a coherent sheaf of OX-modules over an arbitrary scheme X. The stalk of F at a point p ‚àà X, denoted by Fp, is a module over the local ring Op. The fibre of F at p is the vector space F(p) = Fp/mpFp where mp is the maximal ideal of Op. Nakayama's lemma implies that a basis of the fibre F(p) lifts to a minimal set of generators of Fp. That is: * Any basis of the fiber of a coherent sheaf F at a point comes from a minimal basis of local sections. =Going up and going down= The going up theorem is essentially a corollary of Nakayama's lemma. It asserts: * Let R ‚äÇ S be an integral extension of commutative rings, and P a prime ideal of R. Then there is a prime ideal Q in S such that Q ‚à© R = P. Moreover, Q can be chosen to contain any prime Q1 of S such that Q1 ‚à© R ‚äÇ P. =Module epimorphisms= Nakayama's lemma makes precise one sense in which finitely generated modules over a commutative ring are like vector spaces over a field. The following consequence of Nakayama's lemma gives another way in which this is true: *If M is a finitely generated R-module and ∆í : M -> M is a surjective endomorphism, then ∆í is an isomorphism. Over a local ring, one can say more about module epimorphisms: *Suppose that R is a local ring with maximal ideal m, and M, N are finitely generated R-modules. If œÜ : M -> N is an R-linear map such that the quotient œÜm : M/mM -> N/mN is surjective, then œÜ is surjective. =Homological versions= Nakayama's lemma also has several versions in homological algebra. The above statement about epimorphisms can be used to show: * Let M be a finitely generated module over a local ring. Then M is projective if and only if it is free. A geometrical and global counterpart to this is the Serre‚ÄìSwan theorem, relating projective modules and coherent sheaves. More generally, one has * Let R be a local ring and M a finitely generated module over R. Then the projective dimension of M over R is equal to the length of every minimal free resolution of M. Moreover, the projective dimension is equal to the global dimension of M, which is by definition the smallest integer i ‚â• 0 such that ::\\\\operatorname{Tor}_{i+1}^R(k,M) = 0. :Here k is the residue field of R and Tor is the tor functor. Proof A standard proof of the Nakayama lemma uses the following technique due to .: \\"A standard technique applicable to finite A-modules is the 'determinant trick'...\\" See also the proof contained in . * Let M be an R-module generated by n elements, and œÜ: M -> M an R-linear map. If there is an ideal I of R such that œÜ(M) ‚äÇ IM, then there is a monic polynomial ::p(x) = x^n + p_1x^{n-1}+\\\\cdots + p_n :with pk ‚àà Ik, such that ::p(\\\\varphi)=0 :as an endomorphism of M. This assertion is precisely a generalized version of the Cayley‚ÄìHamilton theorem, and the proof proceeds along the same lines. On the generators xi of M, one has a relation of the form :\\\\varphi(x_i) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}x_j where aij ‚àà I. Thus :\\\\sum_{j=1}^n\\\\left(\\\\varphi\\\\delta_{ij} - a_{ij}\\\\right)x_j = 0. The required result follows by multiplying by the adjugate of the matrix (œÜŒ¥ij ‚àí aij) and invoking Cramer's rule. One finds then det(œÜŒ¥ij ‚àí aij) = 0, so the required polynomial is :p(t) = \\\\det(t\\\\delta_{ij}-a_{ij}). To prove Nakayama's lemma from the Cayley‚ÄìHamilton theorem, assume that IM = M and take œÜ to be the identity on M. Then define a polynomial p(x) as above. Then :r=p(1) = 1+p_1+p_2+\\\\cdots+p_n has the required property. Noncommutative case A version of the lemma holds for right modules over non-commutative unital rings R. The resulting theorem is sometimes known as the Jacobson‚ÄìAzumaya theorem. Let J(R) be the Jacobson radical of R. If U is a right module over a ring, R, and I is a right ideal in R, then define U¬∑I to be the set of all (finite) sums of elements of the form u¬∑i, where ¬∑ is simply the action of R on U. Necessarily, U¬∑I is a submodule of U. If V is a maximal submodule of U, then U/V is simple. So U¬∑J(R) is necessarily a subset of V, by the definition of J(R) and the fact that U/V is simple. Thus, if U contains at least one (proper) maximal submodule, U¬∑J(R) is a proper submodule of U. However, this need not hold for arbitrary modules U over R, for U need not contain any maximal submodules. Naturally, if U is a Noetherian module, this holds. If R is Noetherian, and U is finitely generated, then U is a Noetherian module over R, and the conclusion is satisfied. Somewhat remarkable is that the weaker assumption, namely that U is finitely generated as an R-module (and no finiteness assumption on R), is sufficient to guarantee the conclusion. This is essentially the statement of Nakayama's lemma. Precisely, one has: :Nakayama's lemma: Let U be a finitely generated right module over a (unital) ring R. If U is a non-zero module, then U¬∑J(R) is a proper submodule of U. =Proof= Let X be a finite subset of U, minimal with respect to the property that it generates U. Since U is non-zero, this set X is nonempty. Denote every element of X by x_i for i\\\\in \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\}. Since X generates U,\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i R = U. Suppose U\\\\cdot \\\\operatorname J(R) = U, to obtain a contradiction. Then every element u \\\\in Ucan be expressed as a finite combination u=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{s=1}^{m}u_{s}j_{s} for some m\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N},\\\\, u_s\\\\in U,\\\\, j_s \\\\in \\\\operatorname J(R), \\\\,s=1,\\\\dots,m. Each u_s can be further decomposed as u_s = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{n} x_i r_{i,s} for some r_{i,s}\\\\in R. Therefore, we have u=\\\\sum_{s=1}^{m}\\\\left( \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i r_{i,s} \\\\right)j_s = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i \\\\left(\\\\sum_{s=1}^{m}r_{i,s}j_s\\\\right). Since \\\\operatorname J(R) is a (two-sided) ideal in R, we have \\\\sum_{s=1}^{m}r_{i,s}j_s \\\\in \\\\operatorname J(R) for every i\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\}, and thus this becomes :u= \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i k_i for some k_i\\\\in \\\\operatorname J(R), i=1,\\\\dots,n. Putting u=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i and applying distributivity, we obtain :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i (1 - k_i) = 0. Choose some j\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\}. If the right ideal (1-k_j) R were proper, then it would be contained in a maximal right ideal M eq R and both 1-k_j and k_j would belong to M, leading to a contradiction (note that \\\\operatorname J(R)\\\\subseteq M by the definition of the Jacobson radical). Thus (1-k_j)R=R and 1-k_j has a right inverse (1-k_j)^{-1} in R. We have :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i (1 - k_i) (1 - k_j)^{-1} = 0. Therefore, :\\\\sum_{i eq j} x_i (1 - k_i) (1 - k_j)^{-1} = -x_j. Thus x_j is a linear combination of the elements from X\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{x_j\\\\\\\\}. This contradicts the minimality of X and establishes the result.; Graded version There is also a graded version of Nakayama's lemma. Let R be a ring that is graded by the ordered semigroup of non-negative integers, and let R_+ denote the ideal generated by positively graded elements. Then if M is a graded module over R for which M_i = 0 for i sufficiently negative (in particular, if M is finitely generated and R does not contain elements of negative degree) such that R_+M = M, then M = 0. Of particular importance is the case that R is a polynomial ring with the standard grading, and M is a finitely generated module. The proof is much easier than in the ungraded case: taking i to be the least integer such that M_i e 0, we see that M_i does not appear in R_+M, so either M e R_+M, or such an i does not exist, i.e., M = 0.

It was a response by the school in Belfast to the issue of poverty in the compounds of Lusaka, Zambia. Since then the project has grown beyond the school. Project Zambia is today undertaken in association with the Congregation of Christian Brothers, and an NGO, Edmund Rice International. Goals Working in partnership with the people in Zambia, the project seeks to help, support and empower the host communities to develop solutions to their problems and difficulties. The project also reputedly seeks to raise awareness of the conditions and causes that offend the human dignity of so many people throughout the world and to forge close bonds of solidarity between communities in Ireland and communities in Zambia. Misisi compound Misisi compound, the primary location for Project Zambia's efforts, is a shanty town home to around 80,000 people, and is one of the most deprived areas in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV is common among adults and children, many of whom have lost their parents to the disease. Average life expectancy is just 32. The lack of clean water has led to regular cholera outbreaks. As in other Zambian urban compounds, food is scarce. Project Zambia is making headway in creating solutions to this problem. As well as extending the agricultural project, and providing chicken runs, it is also creating social economy projects, the profits of which feed back into the various projects. An example of this is the bakery project. Mapepe village Mapepe, a village on the outskirts of Lusaka, Zambia, was recognised as a potential area of development for Project Zambia. Since beginning the development in Mapepe, a school has been built with further development planned for future groups. A chicken run was also completed as of April 2009. Two bore holes have also been installed to supply the 2000 villagers with clean water.

The Discobolus of Myron (\\"discus thrower\\", , Diskob√≥los) is a Greek sculpture completed at the start of the Classical Period, figuring a youthful ancient Greek athlete throwing discus, about 460‚Äì450 BC. The original Greek bronze is lost but the work is known through numerous Roman copies, both full-scale ones in marble, which was cheaper than bronze,Woodford, Susan. (1982) The Art of Greece and Rome. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 16. such as the first to be recovered, the Palombara Discobolus, and smaller scaled versions in bronze. A discus thrower depicted is about to release his throw: \\"by sheer intelligence\\", Kenneth Clark observed in The Nude, \\"Myron has created the enduring pattern of athletic energy. He has taken a moment of action so transitory that students of athletics still debate if it is feasible, and he has given it the completeness of a cameo.\\"Clark, Kenneth. (2010) The Nude: A study in ideal form. New edition. London: The Folio Society, pp. 134‚Äì135. The moment thus captured in the statue is an example of rhythmos, harmony and balance. Myron is often credited with being the first sculptor to master this style. Naturally, as always in Greek athletics, the Discobolus is completely nude. His pose is said to be unnatural to a human, and today considered a rather inefficient way to throw the discus.An explanation for his inefficient discus throwing could be that the ancient Olympic sportsmen had a set rotation of three quarters before the discus was thrown. This rotation could well have been a deliberate handicap to make the sport more difficult. Also there is very little emotion shown in the discus thrower's face, and \\"to a modern eye, it may seem that Myron's desire for perfection has made him suppress too rigorously the sense of strain in the individual muscles,\\" Clark observes. The other trademark of Myron embodied in this sculpture is how well the body is proportioned, the symmetria. The potential energy expressed in this sculpture's tightly wound pose, expressing the moment of stasis just before the release, is an example of the advancement of Classical sculpture from Archaic. The torso shows no muscular strain, however, even though the limbs are outflung.  Reputation in the past  Attic red-figured cup, ca. 490 BC, is static by comparison. Roman discus thrower from Stabiae, Villa Arianna, 1st century AD Myron's Discobolus was long known from descriptions, such as the dialogue in Lucian of Samosata's work Philopseudes: A Discobolus in the National Roman Museum in Palazzo Massimo alle Terme. Discobolus and Discophorus Prior to this statue's discovery, the term Discobolus had been applied in the 17th and 18th centuries to a standing figure holding a discus, a Discophoros, which Ennio Quirino Visconti identified as the Discobolus of Naukydes of Argos, mentioned by Pliny (Haskell and Penny 1981:200).  Discobolus Palombara or Lancellotti  The Discobolus Palombara, the first copy of this famous sculpture to have been discovered, was found in 1781. It is a 1st-century AD copy of Myron's original bronze. Following its discovery at a Roman property of the Massimo family, the Villa Palombara on the Esquiline Hill, it was initially restored by Giuseppe Angelini; the Massimi installed it initially in their Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne and then at Palazzo Lancellotti. The Italian archaeologist Giovanni Battista Visconti identified the sculpture as a copy from the original of Myron. It was instantly famous, though the Massimo jealously guarded access to it (Haskell and Penny 1981:200). In 1937, Adolf Hitler negotiated to buy it, and eventually succeeded in 1938, when Galeazzo Ciano, Minister of Foreign Affairs, sold it to him for five million lire, over the protests of Giuseppe Bottai, Minister of Education, and the scholarly community. It was shipped by rail to Munich and displayed in the Glyptothek; it was returned in 1948. It is now in the National Museum of Rome, displayed at the Palazzo Massimo.  Townley Discobolus  After the discovery of the Discobolus Palombara a second notable Discobolus was excavated, at Hadrian's Villa in 1790, and was purchased by the English antiquary and art dealer established in Rome, Thomas Jenkins, at public auction in 1792. (Another example, also found at Tivoli at this date, was acquired by the Vatican Museums.) The English connoisseur Charles Townley paid Jenkins ¬£400 for the statue, which arrived at the semi- public gallery Townley commissioned in Park Street, London, in 1794. The head was wrongly restored, as Richard Payne Knight soon pointed out, but Townley was convinced his was the original and better copy. It was bought for the British Museum, with the rest of Townley's marbles, in July 1805.Tony Kitto, \\"The celebrated connoisseur: Charles Townley, 1737-1805\\" Minerva Magazine May/June 2005, in connection with a British Museum exhibition celebrating the bicentennial of the Townley purchase.  Other copies  Other Roman copies in marble have been recovered, and torsos that were already known in the 17th century but that had been wrongly restored and completed, have since been identified as further repetitions after Myron's model. For one such example, in the early 18th century Pierre-√âtienne Monnot restored a torso that is now recognized as an example of Myron's Discobolus as a Wounded Gladiator who supports himself on his arm as he sinks to the ground; the completed sculpture was donated before 1734 by Pope Clement XII to the Capitoline Museums, where it remains. Yet another copy was discovered in 1906 in the ruins of a Roman villa at Tor Paterno in the former royal estate of Castel Porziano, now also conserved in the Museo Nazionale Romano.Kenneth Clark illustrated it in the 1956 edition of The Nude, fig. 130, p.241, as \\"after Myron\\". In the 19th century, plaster copies of Discobolos could be found in many large academic collections, now mostly dispersed.

It is distributed in sub-Saharan Africa and with one species, C. grandis also in South and South-east Asia, and it is also introduced into the New World. Incidentally, C. grandis is also a cultivated crop and it is used for culinary and medical purposes.  Description  Coccinia species are perennial climbing or creeping herbs. Climbing is supported by simple of unequally bifid tendrils. Most species develop a tuber from the hypocotyl, sometimes on roots. The cotyledons are simple, entire and have an blunt tip. The leaves are usually stalked, rarely sessile. The leaves are simple to deeply lobed, usually with teeth along the margin. The lower leaf side often bears small nectar-producing glands. Coccinia species are dioecious, meaning that individual plants produce flowers with only male or only female organs. The sepals are connected and have five triangulate to lineal lobes. The corolla is also connected at the base and has five free lobes. The color of the corolla is creamy white to yellowish orange, rarely also snow-white or pinkish. The male flowers are solitary, in fascicles or often in racemes, female flowers are usually solitary, sometimes also in racemes. Male flowers have three stamens that are connected to a single filament column. The anthers form a globose head. The pollen is produced in S-shaped thecae. Female flowers have an inferior ovary consisting of three carpels and producing a single style. Each carpel ends in a bulging or 2-lobed stigma. Whereas male flowers lack any sign of female organs, female flowers contain three sterile stamens (staminodes). The fruit is a berry with red flesh and a red skin that rarely exhibits a white longitudinal mottling. The seeds are enclosed in a juicy hull (aril), grayish-beige, flat to lentil- shaped.  Distribution  All species occur in sub-Saharan Africa, from semi- arid savannas to rain forests, rarely also mountain forests.

This mechanism was later used to avoid restrictions on the passage of title in land by a system in which a landowner would give land to one person for the use of another. The common law of estates in land grew from this concept. England In English law, feoffment was a transfer of land or property that gave the new holder the right to sell it as well as the right to pass it on to his heirs as an inheritance. It was total relinquishment and transfer of all rights of ownership of an estate in land from one individual to another. In feudal England a feoffment could only be made of a fee (or \\"fief\\"), which is an estate in land, that is to say an ownership of rights over land, rather than ownership of the land itself, the only true owner of which was the monarch under his allodial title. Enfeoffment could be made of fees of various feudal tenures, such as fee-tail or fee-simple. The term feoffment derives from a conflation of fee with off (meaning away), i.e. it expresses the concept of alienation of the fee, in the sense of a complete giving away of the ownership. The medieval English law of property was based on the concept of transferring ownership by delivery: easy to do with a horse, but impossible with land, i.e. with immoveable property. Thus the conveyance (i.e. delivery) of land to the new tenant, known as the delivery of seisin, was generally effected on the land itself in a symbolic ceremony termed \\"feoffment with [de]livery of seisin.\\" In the ceremony, the parties would go to the land with witnesses \\"and the transferor would then hand to the transferee a lump of soil or a twig from a tree ‚Äì all the while intoning the appropriate words of grant, together with the magical words 'and his heirs' if the interest transferred was to be a potentially infinite one.\\"Thomas F. Bergin & Paul G. Haskell, Preface to Estates in Land and Future Interests, p. 11, Foundation Press (2d ed. 1984). A written deed (traditionally a document impressed with the signature and seal of the transferor and the signatures of the witnesses), confirming the symbolic delivery, was customary  and became mandatory after 1677. Gradually the delivery of this deed to the new owner replaced the symbolic act of delivering an object representing the land, such as a piece of the soil. The feoffee (transferee) was henceforth said to hold his property \\"of\\" or \\"from\\" the feoffor, in return for a specified service (money payments were not used until much later). What service was given depended on the exact form of feudal land tenure involved. Thus, for every parcel of land, during the feudal era there existed a historical unbroken chain of feoffees, in the form of overlords, ultimately springing from feoffments made by William the Conqueror himself in 1066 as the highest overlord of all. This pattern of land-holding was the natural product of William the Conqueror claiming an allodial title to all the land of England following the Norman Conquest of 1066, and parcelling it out as large fees in the form of feudal baronies to his followers, who then in turn subinfeudated (i.e. sub-divided) the lands comprising their baronies into manors to be held from them by their own followers and knights (in return, originally, for military service). When the feoffee sub-enfeoffed his holding, for example when he created a new manor, he would become overlord to the person so enfeoffed, and a mesne lord (i.e. intermediate lord) within the longer historical chain of title. In modern English land law, the theory of such long historical chains of title still exists for every holding in fee simple, although for practical purposes it is not necessary at the time of conveyance to recite the descent of the fee from its creation. By the early 20th Century it had become traditional to show the chain of former owners for a minimum period of 15 years only, as occupation for 12 years now barred all prior claims. And the establishment, in 1925, of a national Land Registry (a voluntary public record of land ownership) obviated the need for recitals of descent for registered parcels. Asia In China and some other South East Asian countries, from the time of the Zhou Dynasty (1046‚Äì256 BC) relatives and descendants of the ruling family were granted enfeoffments in return for pledging military service to the King or Emperor in times of war.

As pointed out by de Broglie in his PhD thesis, particles, including electrons can behave like waves (the so-called wave‚Äìparticle duality, now explained in the general framework of quantum mechanics). One of the first interferometry experiments with electrons was the double-slit experiment. Since electrons are charged, they repel each other, thus rendering the theoretical analysis more difficult than for uncharged sources like, e.g., neutrons or atoms. To obtain high precision the de Broglie wavelength needs to be small, which again favours neutrons or (heavy) atoms since they have a higher mass.

TMS is the only anesthetic licensed in the United States for fin fish that are intended for human consumption. The drug can have selective toxicity for poikilotherms due to their lower rate of metabolism in the liver. TMS is an anaesthetic that operates by preventing sodium ions to enter the cell and thus silencing action potentials https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-010-9188-0. This has the net effect of blocking signal exchange between the brain and extremities. The largest manufacturer of Tricaine-S is Syndel in Ferndale, WA, in the USA. Tricaine-S is used for handling fish, amphibians, and other cold-blooded animals during manual spawning, as well as during marking, measuring, photography, research, surgical operations, transport, and weighing of fish. The optimum concentration may vary with the size and species of the fish, and other variables. It is easily soluble in water (both fresh and salt) but it drastically decreases the pH of water, increasing the acidity, which may be toxic for fish. Sodium bicarbonate can be used to buffer the solution to a pH range of 6.5-7.5. Usually an equal amount of buffer is added to attain a neutral pH. In salt/marine/sea water, the buffer use may not be necessary because sea water itself has buffering capacity.

It was discovered on 29 May 1971, by Russian astronomer Lyudmila Chernykh at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnij, on the Crimean peninsula. It was named in memory of Tanya Savicheva, a Russian child diarist during World War II.  Orbit  Tanya is a carbonaceous C-type asteroid, that orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 3.1‚Äì3.3 AU once every 5 years and 9 months (2,101 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.03 and an inclination of 13¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. It was first identified as at Goethe Link Observatory in 1953, extending the body's observation arc by 18 years prior to its official discovery at Nauchnij.  Lightcurve  In October 2013, a rotational lightcurve of Tanya was obtained from photometric observations at the Palomar Transient Factory in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 7.8640 hours with a brightness variation of 0.18 magnitude ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Tanya measures between 37.736 and 43.89 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has a low albedo between 0.03 and 0.055. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a much smaller diameter of 30.18 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.33.  Naming  This minor planet was named by the discover for the memory of the young Russian girl Tanya Savicheva (1930‚Äì1944), who died after the Siege of Leningrad (1941‚Äì1944) on the Eastern Front during World War II. She wrote a well-known diary, describing the death of her parents and other relatives. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 April 1980 ().

The Slitheen are of the egg- laying calcium-based Raxacoricofallapatorian race native to Raxacoricofallapatorius, though many use \\"Slitheen\\" in referring to the race in general. Instinctive hunters trained to kill at a young age, Slitheen are a ruthless criminal sect whose main motivation is profit. They are also convicted on their home world, not willing to return to their planet due to a death sentence. The Slitheen first appeared in the 2005 series episodes \\"Aliens of London\\" and \\"World War Three\\", and subsequently recur in later episodes of both Doctor Who and spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures. Physical characteristics Adult Slitheen are tall, rather fat with long forearms, powerful claws, and infantile face. They do not appear to have eyelids, but have a nictitating membrane. They have a highly developed sense of smell, able to track a single target across a few city blocks, smell adrenaline and hormones in people, and can sense if one of their own dies. Female Raxacoricofallapatorians can produce poisons within their bodies to use against their enemies. Known methods of delivery include a poisoned dart that is formed in the finger and then fired, and exhalation of poisoned breath. Members of the Slitheen family have green skin, though there is variation in the skin tone of other Raxacoricofallapatorian families. In The Sarah Jane Adventures episode The Gift, members of the Slitheen-Blathereen family group are seen to have orange skin. The Slitheen disguise themselves by fitting into the skins of their victims, using compression fields created by a collar worn around their necks to squeeze their huge size into a slightly smaller space. Initially the compression ratio was limited, so the disguises tended to be obese people. This issue was overcome by new technology by the time of The Lost Boy, in which the skins of thinner people were used (by the time of \\"From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love\\" short people could also be used). The exchange of gases that compression entails also builds up within the acquired skin, causing very loud flatulence in humans (the expelled gas smells like bad breath, which the Doctor noted was a form of calcium decay‚Äîthough, in reality, bacteria that cause tooth decay are different from those that cause bad breath). This side-effect is also overcome by the newer technology in The Lost Boy. Gas exchange When the Slitheen are in their skin suits they break wind loudly; they call this the gas exchange. This can also be caused by over- eating. In The Gift, Sarah Jane and the gang destroy their source of food, a plant called Rackweed, which is native to Raxacoricofallapatorius, The Rackweed, when digested, sits in their stomach. Using the audio of every audio producing device in the vicinity, Mr Smith triggers a sound in the attic. This causes the Slitheen to pass gas and, through the subsequent vibration, cause their stomach's to explode. Clyde then states that they \\"farted themselves to death.\\" =Vulnerabilities= Raxacoricofallapatorians are vulnerable to acetic acid, which reacts explosivelyand fatallywith their bodies, making Slitheen allergic to vinegar, ketchup and Coca-Cola. One of the Raxacoricofallapatorian methods of execution is the lowering of the condemned into a cauldron of acetic acid, which is then heated to boiling. The acidity of the solution is formulated to dissolve the skin, allowing the internal organs to drop into the liquid while the condemned is still alive, reducing them to \\"soup\\" in a slow and painful death. In \\"World War Three\\", when a single Slitheen was electrocuted, the effects were transmitted to other Slitheen, even those across the city. Appearances When they first appeared in \\"Aliens of London\\" (set in 2006), the Pasameer-Day branch of the Slitheen had been in Great Britain for some time, having infiltrated various levels of British society, from community leaders and military personnel to mid-level politicians and government officials. Their intent was to instigate World War III and sell the radioactive remains of Earth to a depressed galactic economy as fuel for interstellar spacecraft. They staged the crash landing of an alien spaceship in central London, setting up a cybernetically augmented pig as an \\"extraterrestrial\\" body. With the world in a state of heightened alert and panic, and with their commander Jocrassa assuming the role of Acting Prime Minister, they persuaded the United Nations to allow the United Kingdom to use its nuclear arsenal against the alien \\"massive weapons of destruction\\". Before the Slitheen could receive the launch codes, the Ninth Doctor arranged for a Harpoon missile to demolish 10 Downing Street, ending the scheme and killing all but one of them who managed to escape through an emergency teleport. Blon Fel-Fotch Pasameer-Day Slitheen, who had assumed the identity of Margaret Blaine of MI5, survived and appeared in the episode \\"Boom Town\\". In the intervening six months, \\"Blaine\\" was elected as Lord Mayor of Cardiff and planned to leave Earth by using the energy from a new nuclear power station to interact with the Cardiff Rift, unconcerned that the planet would be destroyed in the process. Blon was stopped by the Doctor and his companions, and on exposure to the \\"heart\\" of the TARDIS, regressed to an egg. The Doctor took the egg to the hatcheries on Raxacoricofallapatorius so she could be given a second chance at life. Some years after the events of \\"World War Three\\", in Revenge of the Slitheen (set in either 2008 or 2009)It is stated in \\"Invasion of the Bane\\" that K-9 Mark IV has been in a black hole for 18 months, \\"School Reunion\\" having taken place in 2007. another group of Slitheen infiltrated a construction company with plans to turn off the Sun and destroy Earth by draining the world's energy to avenge the deaths of the Pasameer-Days. It is mentioned that the Judoon have begun to force out the Slitheen, and the various other families have been working against them. The families Blathereen and Hostrazeen are mentioned as part of the Raxacoricofallapatorian ruling bodies, the Senate and the Grand Council. After Commander Glune was killed by Maria Jackson, Luke Smith was able to trick the Slitheen into resetting their machinery, which then malfunctioned and exploded. Two of the remaining Slitheen were killed, and the others escaped, including Korst, the first child Slitheen to appear. The Slitheen returned in The Lost Boy where, using the newer compression technology, two Slitheen named Dax and Bloorm posed as Luke's 'real' parents Jay and Heidi Stafford. They were under the command of Korst from Revenge of the Slitheen, who planned to avenge the deaths of his family. Another shorter adult Slitheen appeared in the 2009 \\"From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love\\", masquerading as a galactic diplomat in an attempt to steal Sarah Jane's robot dog K-9. The Slitheen appeared in the New Series Adventures novel The Monsters Inside by Stephen Cole. When the Ninth Doctor and Rose are arrested in the Justicia System in the year 2501, the Doctor shares a cell with Dram Fel-Fotch and Ecktosca Fel-Fotch Happen-Bar Slitheen, who claim that after the Earth incident, the remnants of the family went bankrupt and had become historians. The Slitheen had not actually given up business, and were in conflict with a more influential family, the Blathereen. When the Doctor and Rose defeat an attempted Blathereen takeover of the system, the Slitheen are pleased to see they can once again become the profit-holders of their race. The Blathereen were mentioned again in the Sarah Jane adventures episode Revenge of the Slitheen. In the Series 3 finale of The Sarah Jane Adventures, The Gift, a pair of Slitheen-Blathereen from an intermarried line of the two families attempted to overrun Earth with Rakweed, a plant native to Raxacoricofallapatorius and used as an addictive vegetable. In \\"Dalek\\", a stuffed Raxacoricofallapatorian arm was among a collection of alien artifacts owned by American billionaire Henry van Statten in the year 2012. Rose mentioned the Slitheen Parliament of Raxacoricofallapatorius in \\"The Christmas Invasion\\" (though her impromptu speech was a pastiche of phrases she had picked up on her travels with the Doctor). A member of the Slitheen was captured by the Graske in the mini-episode \\"Attack of the Graske\\". Rose accused the Doctor (after his regeneration into the Tenth Doctor) of being a Slitheen in disguise in the 2005 Children in Need mini- episode and the Doctor makes a passing reference to the Slitheen and their skin-suits in \\"The Runaway Bride\\". In the 2006 series episode \\"Love & Monsters\\", an alien called the Abzorbaloff, whose natural form is similar to that of the Slitheen, claims to be from Raxacoricofallapatorius's twin planet Clom. The Slitheen space ship from \\"Aliens of London\\" was also seen in a flashback in the same episode. A Slitheen appears briefly in the Tenth Doctor novel The Nightmare of Black Island by Mike Tucker, created from Rose's memories, along with a Dalek and the Nestene Consciousness. The Slitheen are also briefly referenced by the Doctor in the same novel while speaking to a member of the Cynrog about hiding under human-like skinsuits. In the later novel, The Last Dodo, when the Doctor is asked if he has ever had a dream, he claims to have a recurring one in which a Slitheen on a rocking horse chases him. The Slitheen appear in John Smith's A Journal of Impossible Things in the episode \\"Human Nature\\". The scribbled words by the drawing note that \\"it's always for money.\\" A Fact File book about the Slitheen has also been released. In the Torchwood episode \\"Reset\\", a newspaper clipping of Blon posing as Margaret Blaine, previously seen in \\"Boom Town\\", can be seen as Martha Jones enters the Hub. The Doctor Who website features a segment called Captain Jack's Monster Files, narrated by John Barrowman, which provides information about alien species. An episode focusing on the Slitheen shows a family tree that refers to a number of related families, all with the suffix, -een, with the exception of the 'Absorbalovian Rebels', referring to the Absorbaloff from \\"Love & Monsters\\", from the twin planet of Clom. The Slitheen are mentioned in the audio book Wraith World, when Clyde Langer remarks he cannot understand why Luke and Rani would want to read about made up adventures, when they have faced Slitheen. Though the Slitheen do not appear in \\"The Time of the Doctor\\", the Doctor mentions them as among the forces gathered around Trenzalore. =Summary of appearances= ;Doctor Who *\\"Aliens of London\\" / \\"World War Three\\" (2005) *\\"Boom Town\\" (2005) *\\"The End of Time\\" (2010) ;The Sarah Jane Adventures *Revenge of the Slitheen (2007) *The Lost Boy (2007) *The Gift (2009) *The Nightmare Man (2010) ;Novels *The Monsters Inside by Stephen Cole *The Slitheen Excursion by Simon Guerrier *Revenge of the Slitheen (novelisation of TV story) by Rupert Laight ;Audio Drama * The Taste of Death by Helen Goldwyn (2018) * Death on the Mile by Donald McLeary (2018) * Sync by Lisa McMullin (2019) ;Other *\\"Attack of the Graske\\" (2005) *\\"From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love\\" (2009) *Wraith World (2010) Naming One of the factors that helped the Doctor determine the home planet of the Slitheen was the fact that they had a hyphenated surname. Examples include the names Blon Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen, and Jocrassa Fel-Fotch Passameer- Day Slitheen.

The Guardians first appear in Marvel Super-Heroes #18 (Jan. 1969). The initial roster consisted of Vance Astro, Martinex T'Naga, Captain Charlie-27, and Yondu Udonta. Later members included Stakar Ogord, Aleta Ogord, and Nikki. Publication history The revival iteration of the team: Guardians of the Galaxy #1 (June 1990). Cover art by alt= Roy Thomas recounted, The team first appeared in the partial reprint title Marvel Super- Heroes with issue #18 (Jan. 1969), written by Arnold Drake and penciled by Gene Colan. Despite strong sales on this issue, the Guardians of the Galaxy would not appear again for over five years, in Marvel Two-In-One #4‚Äì5 (July‚ÄìSept. 1974). The story's writer, Steve Gerber, liked the team enough to use them again in Giant Size Defenders #5 and Defenders #26‚Äì29 (July‚ÄìNov. 1975). In each case, other heroes such as Captain America, the Thing, and the Defenders aid them in their war against the alien Badoon, necessitating the liberal use of time travel in these stories. The Guardians were finally given their own series, Marvel Presents, starting with issue #3 (Feb. 1976). Steve Gerber, still handling the writing chores, reflected, \\"Most of the stories I was scripting were set in the present. I wanted to do something that combined the standard superhero elements with something a little different, so that I could give my imagination a bit more play. We had Dave Cockrum redesign the costumes, we created a new starship for them to pilot, and we revised the premise of the strip, so that they were no longer fighting the Badoon on Earth, and sent them off among the stars.\\" Gerber left the series after seven issues, leaving Roger Stern to take over with Marvel Presents #10. The series was cancelled shortly afterwards due to poor sales, with the final issue being #12 (August 1977). This was followed by a series of appearances in Thor Annual #6 (1977), The Avengers #167‚Äì177 (Jan.‚ÄìNov. 1978) and #181 (March 1979), Ms. Marvel #23, Marvel Team-Up #86 (Oct. 1979), and Marvel Two-in-One #61‚Äì63 & #69 (Nov. 1980). Marvel Two-in-One #69 drastically changed the Guardians of the Galaxy story; due to changes made to the past of one of the members, the future which the Guardians of the Galaxy come from and the mainstream Marvel Universe are permanently separated, becoming alternate timelines to each other. After this, the Guardians of the Galaxy were absent from published stories for over a decade. In 1989, Marvel editor-in-chief Tom DeFalco revived the Guardians of the Galaxy following the soaring popularity of the TV series Star Trek: The Next Generation. DeFalco worked out a series concept using a new team of Guardians, but when he saw a series proposal for the original team that Jim Valentino had coincidentally been working on at the same time, he green lit Valentino's idea instead. The Guardians' first self-titled comic launched in June 1990 and ran for 62 issues. This series was initially written and illustrated by Valentino, who deliberately gave it an action-oriented, \\"fun\\" feel that stood out from the typical \\"grim 'n' gritty\\" comics of the 1990s. Though Valentino had plotted the series ahead as far as issue #50, his run was cut short when he co-founded Image Comics. Having taken on two new series and the foundation of a publication company, Valentino asked editor Craig Anderson if he could switch to just writing Guardians of the Galaxy, and in response Anderson dismissed him from the series. With issue #29 (Oct. 1992) Michael Gallagher commenced writing the title, and continued until its cancellation with issue #62 (July 1995). According to Kevin West, who became the penciller with issue #30 (Nov. 1992), he and Gallagher worked together closely on the series, employing the Marvel method of creation, and soon became good friends. A spin-off four-issue miniseries, Galactic Guardians (July‚ÄìOct. 1994), also by Gallagher and West, appeared during this time. West explained why he did not draw the final issue of Guardians of the Galaxy: \\"When I heard we were getting the hook, I naturally started looking for a new job. I ended up at Malibu. There was a hold-up getting the Guardians plot finished so by the time I got it, I had to pass because I had a Malibu deadline to meet. Arrgh. Despite any minor qualms I had, I really did enjoy working on the series.\\" A second volume was published in May 2008, written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. The title, set in a different timeline, features a new team, drawn from participants in the Annihilation: Conquest storyline.Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2, #1 (May 2008) The 1969 team made guest appearances in #12‚Äì17 and #25. A new ongoing series starring the original Guardians, titled Guardians 3000 and written by Abnett, launched in 2014. Fictional team history The Guardians are active in the 31st century in an alternative time-line of the Marvel Universe known as Earth-691. The original members of the team include Major Vance Astro (later known as Major Victory), an astronaut from 20th century Earth who spends a thousand years travelling to Alpha Centauri in suspended animation. He is also the future alternative universe counterpart of Vance Astrovik, the hero known as Justice. Other original team members are Martinex T'Naga, a crystalline being from Pluto; Captain Charlie-27, a soldier from Jupiter; and Yondu Udonta, a blue- skinned \\"noble savage\\" from Centauri-IV (the fourth planet orbiting the star Alpha Centauri B). Each is apparently the last of their kind and they are forced to unite as a team against the actions of the Badoon, an alien race which attempts to conquer Earth's Solar System. During the course of the war against the Badoon, the team gains three more members‚Äîthe mysterious husband and wife duo, Starhawk and Aleta, as well as Nikki, a genetically engineered young girl from Mercury seeking excitement in her life‚Äîand travel back in time, where they encounter several of the heroes of 20th century Earth, including Captain America and the Thing.Marvel Two-in-One #4‚Äì5 (July‚ÄìSeptember [bi-monthly] 1974) The guardians eventually defeat the Badoon, but soon find themselves facing a new foe called Korvac, who was in part a creation of the Badoon. After teaming with the thunder god Thor to defeat Korvac in the 31st century,Thor Annual #6 (1977) the guardians then follow Korvac to 20th century mainstream Earth, where together with the Avengers they fight a final battle.Avengers #167‚Äì177 (January‚ÄìNovember 1978) The guardians reappear years later and have a series of adventures in their future,Marvel Super-Heroes #18 (January 1969) with several others eventually joining the team: the Inhuman Talon, the Skrull Replica, the second Yellowjacket (alias Rita DeMara of the 20th century), and an aged Simon Williams (now called Hollywood, Man of Wonder). Wanting to expand the guardians to a multiple-team organization, Martinex eventually leaves to look for additional members for a second unit, the Galactic Guardians.Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 1, #62 (July 1995) =Connection to the 2008 Guardians= During their second mission, the team that was to become the Earth-616 incarnation of the guardians discover a time- displaced Vance Astro in a block of ice floating in space. It is his introduction as \\"Major Victory of the Guardians of the Galaxy\\" that inspires the team to take up the name. In issues #7 and #16 of the series, it was revealed a great \\"error\\" in the present day has caused the future to be destroyed; Starhawk is constantly trying to prevent it by time travel, causing the future (and the Guardians) to be altered. Only Starhawk, who is changed with each reboot but is \\"one who knows\\" about the changes, realizes anything is different, but each change still ends in a cataclysm. In issue 17, the universe of the Guardians' future had been taken over by the alien race called the Badoon, and only a small portion remained undestroyed. The Guardians sent a warning to the present day, though at the cost of the end of their own universe. The Vance Astro of the modern-day Guardians is revealed to be a Major Victory from one of these altered futures, rather than the original. A second alternate Vance Astro appears in #17. In #18, a third version of the Guardians' future was shown, this time led by Killraven against the Martians. Membership In other mediaThe original Guardians appear as playable characters in a DLC pack for Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 called Classic Guardians of the Galaxy. *Various members of the original Guardians of the Galaxy team are featured in the film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, including Michael Rooker as Yondu Udonta (who was also in the first film), Sylvester Stallone as Stakar Ogord, Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex T'Naga, Ving Rhames as Charlie-27, Michelle Yeoh as Aleta Ogord, Krugarr and an uncredited Miley Cyrus as the voice of Mainframe.

A shortstop, Scott played in Major League Baseball for 12 seasons as a member of the Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, Washington Senators, Chicago White Sox and Cincinnati Reds, from 1914 through 1926. Scott batted and threw right-handed. Scott served as captain of both the Red Sox and Yankees, who have become fierce rivals. He compiled a lifetime batting average of .249, hitting 20 home runs with 551 runs batted in in 1,654 games. He led American League shortstops in fielding percentage seven straight seasons (1916‚Äì22) and appeared in 1,307 consecutive games from June 20, 1916, through May 6, 1925, setting a record later broken by Lou Gehrig. , it is still the third-longest streak in history. After retiring from baseball, Scott became a professional bowler and owned bowling alleys. He died in Fort Wayne, Indiana, at the age of 67. He was posthumously inducted into the Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame and Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame. Early life Scott was born in Bluffton, Indiana. He had two brothers and a sister. His father, Lewis, had moved to Bluffton from Warren, Indiana, shortly before Everett's birth. Lewis' brother, Frame, had been a baseball player when he was younger. Scott attended Bluffton High School, where he played for the school's baseball and basketball teams. He graduated in 1909. Scott married his high school sweetheart, Gladys Watt, in 1912. Career =Early career= After graduating from Bluffton, Scott made his professional baseball debut in Minor League Baseball with the Kokomo Wild Cats of the Class D Northern State of Indiana League in 1909. He moved to the Fairmont Champions of the Class D Pennsylvania‚ÄìWest Virginia League for the remainder of the 1909 season. He began the 1910 season with Fairmont, and completed the season with Kokomo. He joined the Youngstown Steelmen of the Class C Ohio‚ÄìPennsylvania League in 1911, and remained with them in 1912, when they played in the Class B Central League. Jimmy McAleer, a native of Youngstown and minority owner of the Boston Red Sox of the American League (AL), noticed Scott playing for the Steelmen. On McAleer's suggestion, the Red Sox purchased Scott from Youngstown after the 1912 season, and optioned him to the St. Paul Saints of the Class AA American Association. Towards the end of the 1913 season, the Red Sox recalled Scott. Bill Phillips, manager of the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the outlaw Federal League, attempted to convince Scott to jump from the AL after the 1913 season by offering Scott a $4,000 contract ($ today). Scott remained with the Red Sox, signing a contract for $2,500 ($ today) for the 1914 season. =Boston Red Sox= Scott made his major league debut on April 14, 1914 for the Red Sox, and had a .239 batting average with strong fielding as a rookie. His batting average dropped to .201 in the 1915 season. The Red Sox won the AL pennant, and defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1915 World Series. Scott had one hit in 18 at bats during the series. On June 20, 1916, Scott began a consecutive games played streak. Scott batted .232 in the 1916 season and led all AL shortstops in fielding percentage. In the 1916 World Series, the Red Sox defeated the Brooklyn Robins. Scott had two hits in 16 at bats, and Wilbert Robinson of the Robins nicknamed Scott \\"Trolley Wire\\" due to his accurate throws. Scott with the Yankees in 1922 After a contract dispute, when Scott refused a pay cut from the Red Sox, Scott signed a contract for the 1918 season. He batted .241 in 1917, while leading AL shortstops in fielding percentage and defensive games played, but the Red Sox did not win the pennant. Scott batted .221 in the 1918 season, while leading AL shortstops in fielding percentage for the third consecutive season, as the Red Sox won the 1918 World Series. In April 1919, Scott signed a three-year contract with the Red Sox. Scott led AL shortstops in fielding percentage for the fourth consecutive season in 1919, and batted .278, the highest average of his career. Scott broke George Pinkney's MLB consecutive games played streak of 577 on April 26, 1920. He again led AL shortstops in fielding percentage. The Red Sox named Scott team captain for the 1921 season, after the previous captain, Harry Hooper, was traded to the Chicago White Sox. During spring training in 1921, Scott dealt with leg cramp that threatened his playing streak, but he was able to continue playing. Scott had 62 runs batted in on the season, and stated that it was his goal to play in 1,000 consecutive games. =New York Yankees= After the 1921 season, the Red Sox traded Scott with Bullet Joe Bush and Sad Sam Jones to the New York Yankees for Rip Collins, Roger Peckinpaugh, Bill Piercy, Jack Quinn and $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Del Pratt succeeded Scott as captain of the Red Sox. After Peckinpaugh, the captain of the Yankees, was traded, Babe Ruth was named the new team captain. Ruth was suspended in May 1922 and Scott was named captain in Ruth's place. Scott remained the Yankees' captain through 1925. Scott played with the Yankees in the 1922 World Series. He entered the 1923 season 14 games shy of his goal of 1,000 consecutive games played, but sprained his ankle during spring training. He played on Opening Day at the newly opened Yankee Stadium, recording the first assist in the stadium's history. He played his 1,000th consecutive MLB game on May 2, 1923. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Edwin C. Denby presented Scott with a gold medal during a pregame ceremony. Scott broke Perry Lipe's professional baseball record for consecutive games played of 1,127 on September 14, 1923. By the following offseason, manager Miller Huggins began to consider ending Scott's streak. Huggins benched Scott on May 6, 1925 in favor of Pee Wee Wanninger, ending his record consecutive games played streak at 1,307. =Later career= The Washington Senators selected Scott off waivers from the New York Yankees in June 1925, paying the Yankees the waiver price of $4,000 ($ today). With the Senators, Scott served as Peckinpaugh's backup. The Senators reached the 1925 World Series, but lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates; Scott did not appear in the series. Though it was reported that Scott would retire to manage his business in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the Chicago White Sox signed Scott in February 1926. The Cincinnati Reds purchased Scott from the White Sox in July 1926. He played in four games for the Reds. Scott signed with the Baltimore Orioles of the International League for the 1927 season, receiving his unconditionally release on August 4. He signed with the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association in August, and played in 33 games for them. Toledo released him after the season. Scott played with the Reading Keystones of the International League in 1928, batting .315. Scott returned to the Keystones in 1929, but received his release in July 1929 after 62 games, due to the team's disappointing play. Later life Scott was an avid bowler, and he competed in ten-pin bowling events sanctioned by the American Bowling Congress. He bowled against professional Hank Marino in 1931, though he lost. Scott also owned bowling alleys in Fort Wayne. He wrote a children‚Äôs book, called Third Base Thatcher, that was published in 1928. Lou Gehrig, a former teammate of Scott's on the Yankees, surpassed Scott's record of consecutive games played in August 1933 in a game against the St. Louis Browns. Gehrig's streak began in 1925, by pinch hitting for Wanninger, the same season Scott's streak ended. Scott attended the game at Sportsman's Park as a special guest of the Browns. Scott died in Parkview Hospital in Fort Wayne, Indiana at age 67. He was posthumously inducted into the Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986 and the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2008. The News-Sentinel named Scott the fourth- best athlete from Northeastern Indiana of the 20th century.

Patriarch Nerses Varjabedyan (1837‚Äì1884) The Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople (), also known as Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul, is today head of the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople (), one of the smallest Patriarchates of the Oriental Orthodox Churches but one that has exerted a very significant political role and today still exercises a spiritual authority. The Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople recognizes the primacy of the Catholicos of All Armenians, in the spiritual and administrative headquarters of the Armenian Church, the Etchmiadzin, Armenia, in matters that pertain to the worldwide Armenian Apostolic Church. In local matters, the Patriarchal See is autonomous. The seat of the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople is the Surp Asdvadzadzin Patriarchal Church (Holy Mother of God Patriarchal Church) in the Kumkapƒ± neighborhood of Istanbul. The first Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople was Hovakim I, who was at the time the Metropolitan of Bursa. In 1461, he was brought to Constantinople by Sultan Mehmed II and established as the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople. Hovakim I was recognized as the religious and secular leader of all Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, and carried the title of milletba≈üƒ± or ethnarch as well as patriarch. There have been 85 individual Patriarchs since the establishment of the Patriarchate: *75 patriarchs during the Ottoman period (1461-1908) *4 patriarchs in the Young Turks period (1908‚Äì1922) *6 patriarchs in the current secular Republic of Turkey (1923‚Äìpresent) During the Ottoman Period (1461-1908), the Armenian Patriarchate served the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire with a line of Patriarchs in Constantinople. However, like the Greek Patriarchate, the Armenians suffered severely from intervention by the state in their internal affairs. Although there have been 115 pontificates since 1461, there have only been 84 individual Patriarchs. In 1896 Patriarch Madteos III (Izmirlian) was deposed and exiled to Jerusalem by Sultan Abd√ºlhamid II for boldly denouncing the 1896 massacre. The constitution governing the Armenians was suspended by the Sultan. During the reign of the Young Turks (1908‚Äì1922), and after Sultan Abdulhamid II was deposed by the Young Turks, Patriarch Madteos III (Izmirlian) was permitted to return to Istanbul in 1908. The new Turkish administration also restored the constitution. In the initial period of the reign of the Young Turks, the Armenians enjoyed a brief period of restoration of civil liberties between 1908 and 1915. However starting in 1915, the Armenians suffered great hardship under the Young Turk administration and the Armenian community of Turkey was decimated by mass deportations of its Armenian population and the Armenian Genocide. In this critical period, the post of the Patriarch remained vacant from 1915 to 1919 to be restored for a brief period from 1919 to 1922 with Patriarch Zaven I Der Yeghiayan residing. Four Armenian Patriarchs served under the rule of the Young Turks. After the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, and despite a huge diminution in the number of its faithful during the Armenian Genocide, the patriarchate remains the spiritual head of the largest Christian community presently living in Turkey. Today, the Armenian Patriarchs are recognized as the head of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Turkey and he is invited to state ceremonies. Five Armenian Patriarchs have served after the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. The last patriarch Mesrob II (Mutafyan) (’Ñ’•’Ω÷Ä’∏’∫ ‘≤. ’Ñ’∏÷Ç’©’°÷Ü’•’°’∂) was retired by the synod on October 26, 2016, because of his illness which continued more than 7 years.

Population: It was previously known as Zvanka (until December 27, 1933), Volkhovstroy (until April 11, 1940). History The town developed during the industrialization in the first half of the 20th century. The settlement of Zvanka () with a train depot was built here while the railway connecting St. Petersburg with Vologda was being constructed. It was a part of Novoladozhsky Uyezd of St. Petersburg Governorate. A second rail line running north of the station towards Murmansk was constructed in 1916, making the station an important railway junction. In 1918, construction of the Volkhov Hydroelectric Station (the first in the Soviet Union) started on this spot. In 1926, the power plant became operational and in 1932, the first Soviet aluminum plant was launched nearby. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Volkhovsky District, with the administrative center in Zvanka, was established. The governorates were also abolished and the district became a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On August 15, 1930, the okrugs were abolished as well and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On December 27, 1933, the settlements serving the station, the dam, and the aluminum plant were merged with several adjacent villages to form the town of Volkhovstroy. On September 19, 1939, Volkhovstroy became a town of oblast significance and on April 11, 1940, it was renamed Volkhov. During World War II, between 1941 and 1944, the Volkhov River separated the Soviet and the German positions, and Volkhov was a battleground scene. The city itself was never occupied by German troops, and in December 1941 the advance of the German troops to Volkhov was stopped by the Red Army. In 2010, the administrative structure of Leningrad Oblast was harmonized with its municipal structure and Volkhov became a town of district significance. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Volkhov serves as the administrative center of Volkhovsky District.Oblast Law #32-oz As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Volkhovsky District as Volkhovskoye Settlement Municipal Formation. As a municipal division, Volkhovskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Volkhovsky Municipal District as Volkhovskoye Urban Settlement.Law #56-oz Economy =Industry= The economy of Volkhov is essentially based on the Volkhov Hydroelectric Station and on the aluminum production plant. =Transportation= Volkhovstroy I railway station Volkhov (railway stations Volkhovstroy I and Volkhovstroy II) is an important railway hub. One railway line connects in with St. Petersburg (Moskovsky Rail Terminal), and Volkhovstroy I is the terminal station of suburban trains from St. Petersburg. To the east, a railway line continues to Vologda via Tikhvin and Cherepovets. Another railway line passing through Volkhov connects Chudovo in the south and Lodeynoye Pole, Petrozavodsk, and ultimately Murmansk in the north. In Chudovo, it connects to railway between St. Petersburg and Moscow, so that all traffic between Moscow and Murmansk proceeds via Volkhovstroy. Volkhov is located on the road connecting Kiselnya on the M18 Highway, which connects St. Petersburg and Murmansk, and Tikhvin, Cherepovets and Vologda. Volkhov is also connected by roads with Kirishi and with Novaya Ladoga. There are also local roads, with bus traffic originating from Volkhov.

The Joint Unit was inactivated on 30 September 2011 and the 116th ACW was returned to the sole jurisdiction of the Georgia Air National Guard on 1 October 2011.

It was reformed on 1 May 1941, as the 128th Observation Squadron, one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. =Combat in Korean War= The 116th Fighter Group was federalized on 10 October 1950 due to the Korean War. It was redesignated the 116th Fighter-Bomber Group, assigned to Tactical Air Command and moved to George Air Force Base, California. At George, the 116th Group was assigned to the newly activated 116th Fighter-Bomber Wing on 1 November as it reorganized under the wing base organization. At George the wing's three fighter squadrons were equipped with Lockheed F-80C Shooting Stars and began operational training. After losing many of their F-80 pilots to assignment to Far East Air Forces (FEAF) as replacements, all three squadrons were forced to transfer pilots between themselves in order to maintain a balance of qualified pilots, and they were no longer individual squadrons of Georgia, Florida and California. In April 1951 the wing began receiving brand new Republic F-84E Thunderjets directly from Republic Aircraft. On 14 May the wing received a warning order for an impending transfer, and they expected to be transferred to Europe. With a readiness date of 25 June, the 116th was ready to move, and by 1 July they had sent their seventy-five F-84Es to the New York Port of Embarkation for shipment to France. However, on 3 July 1951 they received orders transferring them to Japan. Fifty-four F-84Es had to be obtained from Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas and Langley Air Force Base, Virginia as partial replacements for these Thunderjets. The 116th FBG with the 158th and 159th FBS's departed from San Diego on the transport aircraft carrier USS Windham Bay on 12 July, white the 196th FBS had preceded them by two days on the . The USAF, having learned from the expensive previous experience with open air transportation of the F-84 on an aircraft carrier deck, heavily protected their F-84s this time with cosmoline and tarpaulins. The Wing off-loaded at Yokosuka Naval Base, Japan between 24‚Äì27 July, with their aircraft being barged to Kisarazu, Japan for cleaning and preparation for flight. Regardless of the care taken, thirty- three F-84s suffered some degree of salt damage. Two squadrons, the 158th and 159th were then sent to Misawa Air Base, Japan while the 196th was established at Chitose Air Base, Japan. Their initial role was to serve as an augmentation of Japanese air defenses, and their operational training began on 6 August. The 116th remained on garrison duty in Japan into the fall of 1951. During this period they concentrated on providing air-to-ground support to Army units training in Japan as well as assisting in providing aerial defense of northern Japan as a supplement to the other air defense units. On 30 November 1951 the 159th Squadron was alerted for a combat role, and on 2 December they dispatched sixteen F-84Es to Taegu Air Base (K-2), South Korea. The 159th flew their first combat mission of twelve Thunderjets against rail targets at Wonsan in southeastern North Korea that morning. Three F-84s suffered flak damage. They then returned again that afternoon. The following day they returned to Wonsan two fly two more strikes. Further missions were flown on 4 and 5 December, and then on 6 December they sent twelve F-84s to Sinanju and Sunchon, North Korea on a rail cutting mission, and then returned to Misawa. 158th Fighter Squadron flightline at Tageu AB (K-2), South Korea June 1952. On 12 December wing pilots flew eighty-eight effective combat sorties. On 25 December 15 the 158th Squadron was attacking a train when they were jumped by North Korean MiG-15s that attacked from 20,000 feet in pairs from the F-84s' six o'clock high position. Captain Paul Mitchel, flying as \\"Able 3\\" saw two MiGs behind two F-84s, so he came in behind them and closed to 100 feet, firing on the MiG leader's wingman. The MiG pilot bailed out, and his leader slowed down to see what was happening, so Mitchel fired on him, too, scoring some hits. Mitchel was credited with 1-0-1, obtaining the last officially credited F-84 MiG kill during the Korean War, and the only \\"kill\\" for the 116th Wing. The following day, 16 December the 158th lost their only aircraft attributed to enemy action during the conflict. While strafing ox carts south of Pyongyang Captain David Mather, \\"George 3\\", was hit by antiaircraft fire and his F-84 burst into flames. His wingman told him to bail out, and Mather's canopy was seen to come off, but the F-84 crashed before he could get out. On 18 December the 158th returned to Japan. The 196th Squadron started for Taegu on 26 December for their turn, but didn't get there until 28 December, because of weather problems. The 196th flew missions from K-2 until 3 January 1952, mostly close air support, with a 70% accuracy, and returned to Japan on 4 January 1952. The 116th Group returned to combat on 26 May 1952. The first mission was with sixteen F-84Es that flew from Misawa to Chitose Air Base for a pilot briefing, and then after arming with 500-pound general-purpose bombs, they took off for an attack against Sariwon, in southwestern North Korea. The F-84s were refueled en route by Boeing KB-29 Superfortress tankers near Taegu, South Korea, upon their return from the target, which gave any aircraft unable to be air refueled an alternate landing spot. After refueling the mission landed at Johnson Air Base, Japan and resumed the air defense mission. On 10 June 1952 the 116th was relieved from active duty. The remaining guardsmen were returned to the United States, the jets and equipment of the Wing were then transferred to the 474th Fighter-Bomber Wing and assigned to Fifth Air Force. =Air Defense Command= 158th Fighter Squadron F-51H Mustang, 1952 128th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron General Motors F-84F-40-GK Thunderstreak, AF Ser. No. 51-9520 The wing was redesignated the 116th Fighter-Interceptor Wing and allotted to the Georgia Air National Guard on 10 July and activated at Dobbins Air Force Base. At this time the 116th Group was restructured to include the 128th and 158th Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons. Initially upon their return to state control both squadrons were equipped with the long-range North American F-51H Mustang and given an air defense mission. The 116th was gained by Air Defense Command (ADC), upon mobilization, being assigned to the 35th Air Division with a mission of the air defense of the Southeastern United States. Commencing in February 1953 the 128th began conversion to the F-84D Thunderjet, yet most were not received until mid summer. During the summer of 1955 the 128th was redesignated as the 128th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and converted the swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreak. Strangely enough, it was not until March 1957 that the surviving D models were dispatched for salvage, with eleven of those aged D models having been lost in accidents while serving with the 128th. In 1958, the 116th implemented the ADC Runway Alert Program, in which interceptors of the 128th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron were committed to a five-minute runway alert. In 1960 the F-84s were replaced by the North American F-86L Sabre, a day/night/all-weather aircraft designed to be integrated into the ADC SAGE interceptor direction and control system. =Air Transport= In 1961, Military Air Transport Service (MATS) became the 116th's gaining command as the wing traded in its Sabre interceptors for 4-engined Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter transports. The 116th Wing was assigned to Eastern Transport Air Force and flew long-distance transport missions in support of Air Force requirements, frequently sending aircraft to the Caribbean, Europe, Greenland, and the Middle East in support of Air Force requirements. In 1966 MATS was replaced by Military Airlift Command (MAC) and EASTAF became Twenty- First Air Force. The 116th Wing upgraded to the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II strategic heavy airlifter, being the first Air National Guard unit to receive the aircraft. Due to requirements generated by the Vietnam War, missions were flown across the Pacific to Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, South Vietnam, Okinawa and Thailand. =Post-Vietnam= Republic F-105F-1-RE Thunderchief, AF Ser. No. 63-8299, at Dobbins AFB, heading to the AMARC storage, the last F-105 in USAF service. Next to it is McDonnell F-4D-26-MC Phantom II, AF Ser. No. 65-0604, arriving for service with the 128th Tactical Fighter Squadron. In the years after the Vietnam War, the transport requirements of MAC along with the retirement of the C-124 led the 116th to be reassigned back to Tactical Air Command in 1974 and was re-equipped with North American F-100 Super Sabre tactical fighter-bombers, many aircraft being veterans of the Vietnam War. The 128th flew the Super Sabre jets for six accident-free years until May 1979 when the last aircraft left Dobbins to be retired as part of the phaseout of the F-100 from the inventory. During that time, one F-100D made a crash landing at Dobbins due to its nose gear failing to lower and lock in place shortly before the aircraft were to be retired. The F-100s were replaced with other Vietnam-era hand-me-down combat veteran aircraft by TAC during the early 1980s, as Republic F-105 Thunderchief Wild Weasel electronic warfare aircraft were assigned, then retired and McDonnell F-4 Phantom II fighter bombers in their final years of service. In 1986 the 116th retired the last of its Vietnam War Phantoms and received McDonnell Douglas F-15A Eagle air superiority fighters. The F-15A was introduced into the inventory in the mid-1970s and now were being upgraded in the active duty by the improved F-15C. The 116th flew the F-15 for the next ten years. The 116th Tactical Fighter Wing developed an impressive record of accomplishment and was awarded nine Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards. =B-1B Lancer= Four U.S. Air Force Rockwell B-1B Lancer from the 128th Bomb Squadron, 19 April 2002 In 1992 as part of the post Cold War reorganizations of the Air Force, the 116th converted to the Air Force Objective organization and the 128th was assigned to the reactivated 116th Operations Group. In 1992 Tactical Air Command was inactivated and the 116th was assigned to the new Air Combat Command (ACC). After calling Dobbins home for 50 years, the 116th was presented with a new challenge in 1996. The wing simultaneously converted from the F-15 Eagle fighters to the Rockwell B-1 Lancer strategic bomber and moved 110 miles south to Robins Air Force Base near Warner Robins, Georgia. As part of the post Cold-War drawdown, the active-duty fleet of B-1Bs were being reduced for budget reductions and being taken off alert status by the former Strategic Air Command. Having to make the most of the available facilities, including the former Strategic Air Command alert facility at Robins, the 116th Bomb Wing was quickly up and running and participated in a number of deployments and exercises around the world in the B-1B. =Airborne Command and Control= Due to fiscal constraints, in 2002 the USAF agreed to reduce its fleet of B-1Bs from 92 to 60 aircraft, to include removing all B-1 aircraft assigned to the Air National Guard. The 116th Bomb Wing, having older aircraft was ordered to send its aircraft to \\"active storage\\" which meant that they could be quickly returned to service should circumstances dictate. Its first B-1B was flown to storage at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona on 20 August. Under the Air Force's Total Force Initiative as a \\"blended\\" wing, the former 93d Air Control Wing, an active-duty Air Combat Command unit, and the 116th Bomb Wing, a Georgia Air National Guard unit, were inactivated effective 1 October 2002. The 116th was immediately re-activated and redesignated as the 116th Air Control Wing. The 116th was a blend of active-duty and national guard airmen in a single unit. The wing was equipped with the new E-8C Joint STARS airborne battle management aircraft. Its mission is command and control, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Its primary mission is to provide theater ground and air commanders with ground surveillance to support attack operations and targeting that contributes to the delay, disruption and destruction of enemy forces. The E-8C evolved from Army and Air Force programs to develop, detect, locate and attack enemy armor at ranges beyond the forward area of troops. 116th ACW E-8C Joint STARS, AF Ser. No. 96-0004 In 2006, the National Guard Bureau conducted a facility assessment and determined that the 116th CES was residing in the second worst engineering compound in the Air National Guard. This led to another building being identified for the squadron's new compound, and funding being appropriated for a concept study on how to adapt the facility for CES' needs. In April 2010, The 116th Air Control Wing became the first ever Georgia Air National Guard unit to send a team to the Mountain Man Memorial March, held in Gatlinburg, Tennessee to honor those who have fallen in combat. The wing team sponsored Capt Dixon L. Walters, who was shot down over Kuwait on 31 January 1991. The 128th Airborne Command and Control Squadron has flown more than 82,000 combat hours in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn Operation Odyssey Dawn, and Operation Unified Protector. Beginning in 2011, its operational resume expanded to include support of five Combatant Commands including U.S. Pacific Command, U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Southern Command. On 24 November 2010, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force Designated the 116th Air Control Wing as an \\"Active Associate\\" wing and reorganized the \\"blended\\" wing concept. As a result of this reorganization, a new active duty associate wing was formed. The structure is an association of the Georgia Air Guard's 116th Wing and the active duty 461st Air Control Wing. They will continue to operate together to accomplish the shared J-STARS mission by integrating Air Guard and active duty personnel to the maximum extent possible in groups, squadrons, and shops. The Active Association model is one in which a reserve component (the Air Guard) has principal responsibility for the weapon system that it shares with one or more Active Duty Units. On 1 October 2011 the 116th Air Control Wing was inactivated as a Joint Air National Guard/United States Air Force Unit. Reasons cited were that updated Air Force regulations did not cover the blended unit, leading to anomalies in how promotions, disciplinary actions and other administrative issues were handled, according to the Air Force. The 116th was returned to the sole jurisdiction of the Georgia Air National Guard that same day, and reactivated. The unit's 17 J-STARS aircraft remained under the control of the Georgia Air National Guard, though the active duty pilots continue to fly with their Guard counterparts.

Population: It was previously known as Soltsy (until 1931). Etymology The name of the town originates from the Kirisha River (previously known as Kiresha), a tributary of the Volkhov River. History It was first mentioned in 1693. Since 1727, it was a part of Novoladozhsky Uyezd of Novgorod Governorate, later of St. Petersburg Governorate. In 1922‚Äì1923, the uyezd was renamed Volkhovsky. Before 1931, Kirishi was known as Soltsy. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Andreyevsky District, with the administrative center in the selo of Andreyevo, was established. The governorates were also abolished and the district became a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. Kirishi became a part of Andreyevsky District. On September 30, 1931, the administrative center of the district was moved to Kirishi and the district was renamed Kirishsky. On December 27, 1933 Kirishi was granted urban-type settlement status. Kirishi was occupied for two years during World War II and completely destroyed in 1943, so that on February 19, 1944 the administrative center of the district was moved to the urban-type settlement of Budogoshch. In 1960, Kirishi was rebuilt and the Kirishi oil refinery was constructed. On February 1, 1963, the district was abolished and merged into Volkhovsky District but on January 12, 1965 it was re-established. Kirishi was granted town status and made the administrative center of the district. On January 26, 1967, Kirishi became a town of oblast significance. In 2010, the administrative structure of Leningrad Oblast was harmonized with its municipal structure, and Kirishi became a town of district significance. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Kirishi serves as the administrative center of Kirishsky District.Oblast Law #32-oz As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Kirishsky District as Kirishskoye Settlement Municipal Formation. As a municipal division, Kirishskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Kirishsky Municipal District as Kirishskoye Urban Settlement.Law #49-oz Economy In 1974, a \\"BVK\\" (belkovo-vitaminny kontsentrat, i.e., \\"protein-vitamin concentrate\\") production facility was constructed next to the oil refinery. This was the USSR Ministry of Microbiological Industry's second plant of this kind (after the one in Kstovo, opened in 1973).

Proving to be successful, it remained in service for a number of years post-war in both civilian and military roles in the Soviet Union, and with the air forces of several allied nations. 550 built, in use until 1956 (USSR) and 1960 (foreign users). Design and development The German invasion of the USSR revealed that there was an urgent requirement for a light transport and utility aircraft for use by the Soviet Air Force at the front. To meet this requirement, Aleksei Shcherbakov, who had previously worked at the Kalinin design bureau, and who had also heavily influenced the design of the Polikarpov I-153 fighter before conducting work on pressure cabins and gliders,Donald 1997, p. 829. was directed to design and develop an aircraft that received the designation \\"TS-1\\". A cabin monoplane of semi-cantilever, high-wing configuration, the TS-1 was designed to minimise the use of strategic materials, utilising mostly wood in the construction of its remarkably streamlined airframe, and being powered by two readily available Shvetsov M-11 radial engines.\\"Aircraft of the Soviet and Russian forces\\". Marshall University History Dept. via ibiblio.org archive. Accessed 2010-05-10. Parts of the Lavochkin La-5 aircraft were also used, along with undercarriage parts from the Ilyushin Il-2.\\"Sche-2\\". airwar.ru. . Accessed 2010-05-19. The aircraft was equipped with a fixed, conventional taildragger undercarriage, and a twin-fin tail from the Petlyakov Pe-2 was also utilised. Test-flown in late 1942 and early 1943, the aircraft, by now having been redesignated Shche-2, proved to be capable of meeting the requirement, and production began in October 1943 at OKB-47, the bureaux being established at Chkalov (Orenburg)Dexter 2000. for use by Yakovlev, but being transferred to Shcherbakov's control for the manufacture of his type. Operational history The Shche-2 was capable of transporting up to 16 troops, with an alternative air ambulance configuration for up to 11 wounded, or cargo up to by in size. Alternatively, the aircraft could be used as an aircrew and navigational trainer. It was extensively used in the transport and communications roles on the Eastern Front, providing essential, if unglamorous, service. In 1945, the improved Shche-2TM variant entered flight test, powered by uprated M-11FM engines of each, and fitted with a modified wing. Despite the improvements in the design, the decision was made not to produce the aircraft due to a reduction in requirements for the type with the end of the war in May of that year. A proposed diesel-engined version, which began flight tests in July 1945, met the same fate. Proving in service to be underpowered yet still easy to fly, and establishing a reputation for reliability and ease of maintenance, the Shche-2 was widely used by Soviet forces during the war. Seeing extensive service supplying guerrilla and partisan forces, the Shche-2 also proved to be useful for the delivery of paratroopers. It is estimated that at least 550 Shche-2 aircraft were completed before the close of production in 1946, the OKB-47 factory being closed down at the conclusion of production. After the end of the war, the aircraft remained in service for several years, with the air forces of Yugoslavia and Poland making use of the type, in addition to the aircraft being extensively utilised in transport and air ambulance duties in civilian service within the Soviet Union. In addition, the Shche-2 was operated by Aeroflot on several local airline routes within the Soviet Union for several years after the end of the war, before its replacement by the Antonov An-2.

The term, employed as a style descriptor as early as the mid-1950s, was reaffirmed in 1983 by Cara Greenberg in the title of her book, Mid-Century Modern: Furniture of the 1950s (Random House), celebrating the style that is now recognized by scholars and museums worldwide as a significant design movement. The MCM design aesthetic is modern in style and construction, aligned with the Modernism movement of the period. It is typically characterized by clean, simple lines, honest use of materials, and it generally does not include decorative embellishments. Architecture Copan, a Niemeyer building in S√£o Paulo, Oscar Niemeyer The mid-century modern movement in the U.S. was an American reflection of the International and Bauhaus movements, including the works of Gropius, Florence Knoll, Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Although the American component was slightly more organic in form and less formal than the International Style, it is more firmly related to it than any other. Brazilian and Scandinavian architects were very influential at this time, with a style characterized by clean simplicity and integration with nature. Like many of Wright's designs, Mid-century architecture was frequently employed in residential structures with the goal of bringing modernism into America's post-war suburbs. This style emphasized creating structures with ample windows and open floor plans, with the intention of opening up interior spaces and bringing the outdoors in. Many Mid-century houses utilized then-groundbreaking post and beam architectural design that eliminated bulky support walls in favor of walls seemingly made of glass. Function was as important as form in Mid-century designs, with an emphasis placed on targeting the needs of the average American family. Eichler Homes ‚Äì Foster Residence, Granada Hills In Europe, the influence of Le Corbusier and the CIAM resulted in an architectural orthodoxy manifest across most parts of post-war Europe that was ultimately challenged by the radical agendas of the architectural wings of the avant- garde Situationist International, COBRA, as well as Archigram in London. A critical but sympathetic reappraisal of the internationalist oeuvre, inspired by Scandinavian Moderns such as Alvar Aalto, Sigurd Lewerentz and Arne Jacobsen, and the late work of Le Corbusier himself, was reinterpreted by groups such as Team X, including structuralist architects such as Aldo van Eyck, Ralph Erskine, Denys Lasdun, J√∏rn Utzon and the movement known in the United Kingdom as New Brutalism. Pioneering builder and real estate developer Joseph Eichler was instrumental in bringing Mid-century modern architecture (\\"Eichler Homes\\") to subdivisions in the Los Angeles area and the San Francisco Bay region of California, and select housing developments on the east coast. George Fred Keck, his brother Willam Keck, Henry P. Glass, Mies van der Rohe, and Edward Humrich created Mid-century modern residences in the Chicago area. Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House is extremely difficult to heat or cool, while Keck and Keck were pioneers in the incorporation of passive solar features in their houses to compensate for their large glass windows. =Mid-century modern in Palm Springs= Miller House, by Richard Neutra The city of Palm Springs, California is noted for its many examples of Mid-century modern architecture.

Restoration projects have been undertaken to return many of these residences and businesses to their original condition. Industrial design Scandinavian design was very influential at this time, with a style characterized by simplicity, democratic design and natural shapes. Glassware (Iittala ‚Äì Finland), ceramics (Arabia ‚Äì Finland), tableware (Georg Jensen ‚Äì Denmark), lighting (Poul Henningsen ‚Äì Denmark), and furniture (Danish modern) were some of the genres for the products created. In America, east of the Mississippi, the American-born Russel Wright, designing for Steubenville Pottery, and Hungarian-born Eva Zeisel designing for Red Wing Pottery and later Hall China created free-flowing ceramic designs that were much admired and heralded in the trend of smooth, flowing contours in dinnerware. On the West Coast of America the industrial designer and potter Edith Heath (1911‚Äì2005) founded Heath Ceramics in 1948. The company was one of the numerous California pottery manufacturers that had their heyday in post- war US, and produced Mid-Century modern ceramic dish-ware. Edith Heath's \\"Coupe\\" line remains in demand and has been in constant production since 1948, with only periodic changes to the texture and color of the glazes.  Social medium  Printed ephemera documenting the mid-century transformations in design, architecture, landscape, infrastructure, and entertainment include mid-century linen post cards from the early 1930s to the late 1950s. Mid- century linen post cards came about through innovations pioneered through the use of offset lithography. The cards were produced on paper with a high rag content, which gave the post card a textured look and feel. At the time this was a less expensive process. Along with advances in printing technique, mid- century linen postcards allowed for very vibrant ink colors. The encyclopedic geographic imagery of mid-century linen post cards suggests popular middle class attitudes about nature, wilderness, technology, mobility and the city during the mid-20th century.

It first aired on Teletoon in Canada and Channel 4 in the United Kingdom (incomplete run). It is a co-production between Hat Trick Productions in the UK and Decode Entertainment in Canada. It was originally to be entitled Streatham Hill, but was renamed Bromwell High in January 2005. Streatham Hill is a real London suburb, while Bromwell is fictional.http://www.toonhound.com/bromwell.htm Subsequent international purchases have seen the show screened in the United States on BBC America, on The Box in the Netherlands, dubbed to Spanish and Portuguese on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim in Latin America, on the ABC in Australia, on TVNZ's TV2 in New Zealand, and also dubbed in French for the Canadian T√©l√©toon network. It stars three troublemaking girls: Keisha, Latrina, and Natella, as they wreak havoc on their impoverished school and its teachers. The show was designed by David Whittle, who is also responsible for illustrating the popjustice icons series of books. The show represents a caricatured view of contemporary British society. For example, the majority of students at Bromwell High School are immigrant children from the Caribbean and Asia, and some of the male teachers are aging 'chavs'. Many of the characters on the show speak a very poor form of English, including the headmaster, Iqbal. Most of the teachers have an affinity for biscuits. Because the show was intended for both British and Canadian audiences, the characters sometimes use Canadian terms which are different from those heard in Britain. This can sometimes confuse viewers, especially on the occasions when Bromwell is referred to as a \\"public school\\"; in Canada, this means a provincial school, open to non-fee paying students, but in the UK, the term refers to a fee-paying, private school which attends the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. In fact, Bromwell would be correctly termed as a state school in Britain. There are some other differences between the UK and Canadian versions of the show, notably that the UK version has a longer and slightly different version of the opening credits and theme, and the UK broadcasts were in the 16:9 (widescreen) aspect ratio, while the Canadian versions are cropped to a 4:3 picture. The show is directed by Pete Bishop (who also directed and co-created with Steven Appleby and Frank Cottrell-Boyce the Captain Star TV series) and was created by Anil Gupta, Richard Osman, Richard Pinto, and Sharat Sardana (with Osman, Pinto and Sardana also contributing as writers to the show). Main characters Natella Tendulkar Gavaskar Srivastavah is the youngest child, and only girl, in a family of 12. She is an errant Asian prodigy who uses her stunning intellect to manipulate pupils and staff alike. She is extremely articulate, ambitious, and somewhat arrogant (often rightfully so). She often tries to overcome depressing situations through reasoning, yet passionately abandons this when she realizes that the situation is either worse or better than originally thought. In any normal school Natella would be top of the class, but at Bromwell High ‚Äî happy home of the underachiever ‚Äî her cerebral prowess is considered nothing short of astonishing. She is voiced by Jo Wyatt. * Keisha Marie Christie has a strong voice, a big personality, and the tendency to shoot first and ask irrelevant questions later. She suffers from attention-deficit disorder and likes anti-establishment activity and physical violence, often assaulting people with little or no justification. She comes from a broken home and blames society for treating her badly because she is black. She is voiced by Gina Yashere. * Latrina is a poor, supposedly attractive chav girl who is quite dimwitted but doesn't worry about grades. She is promiscuous and unsophisticated, but she acts with good intentions. She dismisses many things, such as \\"tolerance\\", \\"wheelchair access\\", and \\"not having babies\\", as \\"for gays\\". She is voiced by Nina Conti. Supporting characters Iqbal bin Ibrahim Maurice Kandallah Five years before his appointment at Bromwell High, Iqbal had escaped from Parkhurst where he was serving time for an unspecified crime. He subsequently met Mr. Bibby in Angola where they operated a diamond smuggling business together and \\"dabbled\\" in human trafficking. After being forced to leave Africa in a U.N. helicopter gunship, Iqbal arrived in England with nothing but the shirt on his back, a faded five pound note in his pocket, and a Bedford van's exhaust chamber full of state-of-the-art hydroponic equipment and marijuana seeds with the potential street value, when cultivated, of ¬£80,000 (equal to ¬£81,000 today). With these simple tools, he ran a mini-cab company and built an empire that today covers many thousand square feet. Although he had no formal academic qualifications (he does not believe in science, which he calls \\"hocus-pocus\\"), Iqbal rose quickly through the ranks to become Headmaster on the night he won Bromwell High in a poker game. Since he began his tenure, Bromwell High has consistently succeeded in avoiding closure ‚Äî testament, surely to the quality of leadership he had provided. Gregarious and larger than life, Iqbal is not a conventional Headmaster by any stretch. His language is colourful though his understanding of basic grammar is non-existent. He tries to make money any way he can, which often involves illegal and unethical practices. He holds very long meetings and assemblies that are often filled with irrelevant and/or ridiculous anecdotes or performances (known unofficially as \\"Item 53\\", due to the fact that in each episode the bizarre story/act is promptly followed by Iqbal saying \\"Next on our list, item 54...\\"). He can be manipulative and cocky but beneath the rough exterior lurks a conscience, and occasionally Iqbal surprises everyone with (rare) moments of humanity and pastoral excellence. Iqbal's Bromwell High file number is 1. He is voiced by Simon Greenall (of I'm Alan Partridge fame). * Roger Bibby Roger Bibby read geography at Oxford University, where he won a Greco-Roman wrestling scholarship and had to pick an \\"academic\\" subject to graduate in. In his first year, Mr. Bibby came under the spell of an emeritus professor whose study he accidentally wandered into one night thinking it was his own bed. It turned out that it was his own bed and that the \\"professor\\" was quite seriously mental. That night, a friendship began that eventually resulted in Mr. Bibby becoming a geography teacher. Mr. Bibby is the Deputy Head of Bromwell High and the Geography teacher. Extremely articulate and knowledgeable, he has a very professional bearing. However, he is very stern and insensitive, and sometimes evil just for the sake of being evil (he has been known to be friendly with demons, and with Iqbal has links with the slave trade and diamond smuggling in Angola). In one episode he slapped Iqbal in the face just for crying. He is extremely manipulative, and therefore able to commit unethical acts with the Headmaster's consent. Like the Headmaster, he is insatiably greedy and tries to make money through unethical practices. However, unlike the Headmaster, he is far more calculated when he implements his plans. Mr. Bibby's Bromwell High file number is 159. He is voiced by Graeme Garden (of The Goodies fame). * Martin Jackson Martin read mathematics at Cambridge though he never graduated. He was physically and sexually abused by his tutor, the head of the mathematics department, the rest of the mathematics department, the rowing club, the varsity football and rugby teams and the Christian society. He spent three years as a research project for the School of Medicine‚Äîhis blood pressure was found to be high enough to clean car wheels. He did not die, he only whined continuously. Research on Martin led to the development of Prozac. Despite the fact that he was, and still is, the only mathematics teacher in the school, it took Martin five years to gain promotion to Head of Mathematics Department. His teaching has been described by Ofsted as 'cocking shite'. Martin must always be watched. He has the kind of nervous disposition exhibited by people who take high-velocity rifles up clock towers to pick off passers-by. He is a spineless, ineffectual teacher who hates children, his job, and himself. In his late thirties, he is cripplingly middle-class and hides it by living in a Victorian terraced house in the shadow of a council estate in southeast London. He is the bane of Carol's life. When he teaches he does not discipline his students when they act contemptuously. He is also extremely neurotic, and panics at the thought of anything going wrong for him. He does not have a proper teaching qualification; only a certificate in plumbing technology. He often cheats on his wife, Carol Jackson, although he claims that \\"using a prostitute is not cheating.\\" When Martin messes up or does something wrong he often hits himself on the head and says \\"fuck\\" even when students are present. Iqbal's nickname for him is \\"Mongo\\" (a variant of \\"mong\\", an offensive term implying mental retardation, derived from the original name given to Down's syndrome). He was born Martin Shitely but took his wife's surname after marriage. Martin's Bromwell High file number is 657. He is also voiced by Simon Greenall. * Carol Jackson Carol graduated from Hedgehog College, University of the Lake District, then attended teacher-training college at the Above Burger King School of Teaching, Oxford Street, London. She then spent five years at the Amnesty International London office, waiting outside the main entrance. Nobody let her in but she did receive free psychiatric help and eventually accepted that she didn't work for Amnesty International and was in fact a nut. She later met and married Martin Shitely, who took her name. Carol is now an English teacher at Bromwell. She is in her 30s, wears organic clothes, and reads the Guardian. Carol understands people of all races and creeds except her husband Martin. She is discontented with the lack of intimacy and romance in her marriage; this is probably why she competes with Melanie Dickson for the attention of handsome men. She usually responds to Martin doing something stupid or wrong with \\"Oh, Martin, you idiot.\\" Carol's Bromwell High file number is 287. She is voiced by Doon Mackichan (from Smack the Pony). * Melanie Dickson Miss Dickson graduated from the University of Pudwacker Salt Flats with a First Class Honours degree in Chemical Biology. She immediately gained bar work in London and very quickly rose up the ranks to become Bar Manager of \\"Alcoholiday\\", an Aboriginal-themed bar in London's Leicester Square. She moved to Bromwell High thinking it was another themed bar, but within a year she realised that she was Head of Sciences at an inner-city school. She is an attractive but very rude woman who shows a lack of proper teaching skills. She often taunts and teases people who aren't as pretty as she is, especially Carol. Originally from Australia, Miss Dickson now teaches all the subjects at Bromwell that nobody else will (History/Science/Music/Etc.) - very poorly. She seldom cares about the subjects she teaches and even chain smokes during class. She competes with Carol Jackson for the affections of handsome men, mainly because she has an insatiable libido. Melanie's Bromwell High file number is 349. She is voiced by Tracy-Ann Oberman. * Mr. Phillips Mr. Phillips grew up in the quiet, crack- addled village of Chomping Frenum on England's west coast. He went missing at age 10, after chasing a worm into the forest. He strayed into an army firing range and was hit by three medium-sized surface-to-air missiles. Fortunately they passed straight through his skull, but he lost 80 percent of his brain matter. On his way to an interview for a post at Bromwell High, Mr. Philips was caught in the crossfire of a gang-war shoot-out and lost 80 percent of his remaining brain matter. Mr. Philips is Bromwell High's Physical Education teacher. He is often unaware of his surroundings or current situation, and is therefore utterly ineffective as a teacher. Iqbal refers to him as \\"the stupid one\\". Mr. Phillips' Bromwell High file number is 999. He is voiced by Stephen Merchant. * Gavin Beale Gavin was born in a crossfire hurricane. His mother was a tailor and his father was a gambling man. These circumstances made him turn to Christianity, which he hoped would provide some stability in his life. He studied Theology at Durham University where he obtained a trombone scholarship. He was ready to enter the church by 1990, in a poor east London parish where he felt he could help ease the suffering and assist the poverty stricken. He decided to defer a year and backpack around Thailand instead. He claims to have written the novel \\"The Beach\\", the manuscript of which he says he left in a Bangkok dance bar, possibly in a Bangkok dancer. No one believes him because he has absolutely no proof and is generally considered to be \\"a lying twat\\". Returning to the poverty-stricken East End parish, he was struck by how disgusting it was so he got a job teaching. Gavin is now the Religious Education teacher at Bromwell High (he considered being a journalist for NME but became a Christian Fundamentalist without having to change his taste in acoustic-based rock). He acts casual in an effort to connect with his pupils, but this is a thinly-veiled attempt to convert his students to Christianity. He consistently offends followers of all other faiths. Gavin's Bromwell High file number is 742. He is voiced by Stephen Mangan. * Ms. Jenny Gosby Ms. Gosby graduated from Oxford Mobile University in 1986. There are no records of her before this. There are, however, records for a Mr. Bruce Gosby, who seems to have vanished during his gap year before attending university. Bruce was an accomplished rower who took first place in both coxless events. He enjoyed being coxless, as if he were waiting all his life to be without cox. After teacher training, \\"Ms.\\" Gosby taught sciences to inmates of Lezzborough Prison, Little Beanflick, Dykeshire. She was dismissed after her involvement in a rooftop protest. Convicted of inciting a riot, Ms. Gosby was tagged by the police and considered dangerous and psychologically unstable. She has since been appointed to Head of Biology at Bromwell High, and is also the lunchlady. Other characters have hinted that she might be transgender. Ms. Gosby's Bromwell High file number is 123. =Minor characters= Davis Considered \\"cool\\" and attractive by many of the girls within Bromwell High. Although he is depicted as being intelligent, he is usually rebellious within school and rude to teachers and prefects alike. During the episode \\"1x06: Valentines's Day\\", the girls of Bromwell High witnessed him placing a valentine's card into Keisha's and Natella's box. It remains the episode's plot to see who the card is meant for. Although Davis and Aisha have many similarities, Davis has never mentioned that he likes Aisha. His \\"cool\\" status comes from his contempt for teachers and his skills in speaking. He is also apparently quite attractive. * Jamal Davis' best friend, although he is considerably less popular with the girls of Bromwell High. He is also considerably less intelligent, but less rebellious in school. Latrina has mentioned that she made out with Jamal. * T'Shawn T'Shawn is incredibly short and has a high-pitched voice. He is also depicted constantly wearing an orange jacket, regardless of location, weather, and temperature. These three qualities make him horribly unpopular with the children of Bromwell High. It has been established he has feelings of affection for Keisha, although she strongly dislikes him. T'Shawn's catchphrase is, \\"Oh, baby!\\" * Aisha Similar to Jamal and Davis, Aisha and Belisha are best friends. Aisha is large, strong, and constantly has an angry expression, so is feared by many Bromwell High students. Most of her bullying comes from intimidation, and not actual physical violence. Aisha strongly dislikes Natella and all of her noble causes. * Belisha Belisha is loud and brash. Unlike her best friend Aisha, she does not bully students exclusively through intimidation. She is quite willing (even happy, it seems) to physically harm students and damage property. Although she is relatively slim and only slightly tall, she is feared by all the girls, for she is very violent, and more than willing to fight (it can only be assumed that she is quite experienced in a fight, to make up for her small figure). She sometimes tries to outwit Miss Dickson into dismissing school early. * Kylie Kylie is a shy girl with bright red hair and bad acne. She is viewed as unpopular with the students of Bromwell and is picked on by Keisha, Aisha, Belisha, and many of the teachers. * Leonora A representative of the LEA (Iqbal believes this to be a secret organization, and her name to be Pussy Aplenty). She is rather cruel and manipulative individual, using the school, pupils and staff for her own and the LEA's rather shadowy ends.

History The lighting of a \\"unity candle\\" is a relatively new custom in wedding ceremonies. There is no record of it in the bible or any Apostolic writings. The custom first became popular in the second half of the 20th century in American Christian weddingshttps://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2001/aug/30/what-historyorigin- dreaded-unity-candle/. The origins are unclear, however the use of a unity candle in a 1981 episode of General Hospital may have helped to popularize the practicehttp://catholicphilly.com/2012/09/catholic-spirituality/whats-with- the-unity-candle-in-a-catholic-wedding/. Symbolism Use of a unity candle generally symbolizes the joining of two individuals into the marriage bond, but additional allusions may be invoked. The flame may be said to represent the passion in each individual's soul for their spouse. For Christians, it may be compared to the Holy Spirit and Jesus, who is the light of the world, within the souls of those who are baptized. Use Two taper candles are initially lit and used by each member of the marrying couple. These tapers are then used to light a larger pillar candle in the center. Variations may include additional tapers used by parents to light the tapers that represent the individuals being married. When the practice is intended to symbolize simply the joining together of the bride and groom, the tapers may be blown out, to indicate that the two lives have been permanently merged, or they may remain lit beside the central candle, symbolizing that the now-married partners have not lost their individuality. Inclusion in Church Weddings While the use of unity candles within the marriage rite has become widespread, it is a recent invention and not explicitly part of the Churches Apostolic Tradition and therefore prohibited in some churches. It is advisable that couples and their Wedding planner should always check with the pastor before including the ceremony in their order of service. =Anglican Church Weddings= The Candle Ceremony is not part of the Anglican wedding ceremonies, although it may be allowed at the discretion of the pastor. =Roman Catholic Church Weddings= The Unity Candle Ceremony is not part of the Catholic Wedding Ceremony. Catholic Tradition, instead, sees the regular reception of the Holy Eucharist as the heart of Christian Unity. The recently updated Catholic Rite of Marriagehttp://www.usccb.org/issues-and- action/marriage-and-family/marriage/wedding-ceremony/index.cfm does not include any provisions for the Unity Candle Ceremony. For this reason, many parishes do not allow its inclusion in the ceremony. While the US Conference of Catholic Bishops has not explicitly prohibited the use of the unity candle in the marriage rite, neither has it encouraged the practice. The Conference has noted that the policies of most dioceses do not prohibit this custom but many suggest that it be done at the reception since the Rite of Marriage already has abundant symbols of unity. The analysis of the Bishops regarding unity candles concludes by indicating that if the unity candle is permitted, the couple should light their individual candles from the paschal candle, the individual candles should not be extinguished and the unity candle should not be placed on the altar.http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/marriage-and- family/marriage/marriage-preparation/mpanalysis.cfm By following this direction, the lighted candles can then be seen as a way of emphasizing the couple's union in the sacramental and vocational nature of their marriage. Mixed Marriages and the Unity of Baptism In the Sacred Tradition of the Catholic Church, a marriage is sacramental in nature when the couple are both baptized Christians. This fact can help to give a more Christian interpretation of the Unity Candle, especially in a mixed marriage between a Catholic and a Christian of another Tradition. It is desirable at a Catholic Wedding for Holy Communion to be distributed. However, given that Holy Communion is not encouraged at a mixed Wedding, where one of the spouses together with a large part of the congregation is not Catholic, the use of a Unity Candle might be employed as a sign of the baptismal unity of the couple. Since in the rite of baptism, the lighted Paschal Candle and a smaller candle plays an important symbolic part. In the baptism ritehttp://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/sacraments-and- sacramentals/baptism/index.cfm, the Pascal Candle is placed near the font. After the person has been baptized with water, another smaller candle is lit by a Godparent from the flame of the Paschal Candle and given to the newly baptized as a sign that they have received the \\"light of Christ\\". They are instructed to keep the \\"flame\\" they have received to \\"keep burning brightly\\" until the return of the Lord (Parousia). This call to vigilance is a reference to the discipleship nature of baptized Christians who are called to evangelize through their vocational calling. The fact that each of the couple shares the same light signifies the unitive nature of their Christian vocation. St. Paul expresses the evangelizing nature of Christian marriage in his letter to the Ephesians 5:22-33. He says \\"Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord\\"Eph 5:22 and \\"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her\\"Eph 5:25 A personalized Unity Candle set  References  Wedding traditions Candles ","title":"Unity candle"},{"id":"1835474","text":"Emilian-Romagnol (emili√¢n-rumagn≈çl or l√§ngua emigli√®na-rumagn√¥la), also known as Emiliano-Romagnolo, is a Gallo-Italic language.

At its height in the 1880s, it was a gold and silver mining town with a population of around 2,500 and approximately 75 businesses. Description Silver City served as county seat of Owyhee County from 1867 to 1934. Today, the town has about 70 standing buildings, all of which are privately owned. Many of the owners are third- or fourth-generation descendants of the original miners. There are a handful of small businesses, but no gas or service stations. The property is now owned by the federal government, overseen by the Bureau of Land Management. Our Lady of Tears, Silver City Silver City was founded in 1864 soon after silver was discovered at nearby War Eagle Mountain (elev. ). The settlement grew quickly and was soon considered one of the major cities in Idaho Territory. The first daily newspaper and telegraph office in Idaho Territory were established in Silver City. The town was also among the first places in present-day Idaho to receive electric and telephone service. Along with Idaho City in the Boise Basin, these mining areas accelerated the growth of the capital city of Boise as a staging and supply point. The placer and quartz vein mines became depleted around the time Idaho became a state in 1890. Due in part to its extremely remote location, Silver City began a slow decline but was never completely abandoned. Small-scale mining continued off and on until World War II; the last mine to be operated all year round in Silver City was the \\"Potossi,\\" managed by Ned Williams. By the 1940s, there was only one permanent resident, Willie Hawes (1876‚Äì1968), who was born in town and was its mayor, police chief, fire chief, postman, etc. The Idaho Hotel in Silver City was restored and re-opened for tourists in 1972. It relies on the use of propane refrigerators and stoves in order to supply cold drinks and snacks or a complete meal to guests during the summer months. The rooms are fitted with indoor plumbing and furnished with antiques, making it a tourist destination. In 1972, the townsite and its environs were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district, the Silver City Historic District, with a total area of .

It is known from cultivation only, and its use goes back many centuries as evidenced by ancient phytomorphic ceramics from Peru depicting the fruits. Origin and distribution Not known in the wild, but presumably native to the Andes where it has been traditionally cultivated. Description Cyclanthera pedata is a vine that can be 12 m long; the stems are thin; and the leaves can be up to 24 cm long, palmate or pedate in shape. The small flowers can be greenish or white and are borne in racemes. The fruit is light green, ovoid, curved, up to 15 cm long, almost hollow (except for the seeds and a thin flesh layer), with smooth skin or sometimes covered in soft spines; the seeds are black. Flowers. Cultivation Cyclanthera pedata is grown at small scale farming in mountain areas of Mexico, Central America and South America. It is sometimes cultivated in Asia. This species can be grown in mountain areas up to 2000, being adapted to cool temperatures.  Vernacular names  Known in the Andes as caigua or caihua (possibly from Quechua kaywa); see: achoqcha also as achocha (possibly from Quechua achuqcha). In English it is named stuffing cucumber or slipper gourd. Uses =Food= The fruits are eaten after removing the seeds and stuffing them with other foods like rice or meat, and then cooking them. Young shoots and leaves can also be eaten as greens. The fruits are a source of potassium, magnesium and phosphorus.Oliveira, A. C., dos Santos, V. S., dos Santos, D. C., Carvalho, R. D.

Reports of hairy-fronted muntjacs from Burma result from considering the hairy-fronted muntjac and Gongshan muntjac as the same species. This suggestion is controversial. It is similar in size to the common muntjac. Hairy-fronted muntjacs are extremely difficult to study because of their shyness.

He was renowned as an intelligent and wise lord, and was greatly interested in Western learning and technology. He was enshrined after death as the Shinto kami in May 1863. Early life and rise to power Shimazu Nariakira was born at the Satsuma domain's estate in Edo, on April 28, 1809. From his mother, he was descendant of Date Masamune, Tokugawa Ieyasu and Oda Nobunaga. He rose to power as daimy≈ç of the domain of Satsuma only after surviving a gruesome and arduous war within his own family and domain, known as the Oyura S≈çd≈ç or the Takasaki Kuzure.Iwata, 29 He faced much opposition in Satsuma since he spent most of his life in Edo (and compulsory requirement as the heir of daimyo, set by the Shogunate); as such he was considered a stranger in his own domain. In his quest to prepare Satsuma for potential Western aggression, he also faced many opposing military schools of thought in Satsuma who disagreed with the Shimazu family's plan for strengthening coastal defense. Marquess Kuroda Nagahiro, a close relative of Shimazu Nariakira. Nariakira did not see eye to eye with his father, Shimazu Narioki, or his father's chief advisor, Zusho Hirosato. Both Narioki and Zusho were wary of the Tokugawa shogunate.Sakai. \\"Shimazu Nariakira\\". p222 Zusho also saw many similarities in Nariakira and his grandfather, Shigehide. Shigehide also had a great interest in Dutch studies as well as scientific and industrial projects, which promptly led to the deterioration of the domain's financial position. Having worked so hard to rehabilitate and strengthen the treasury of Satsuma, Zusho did not encourage Nariakira's ambitious and costly program for a military build-up. Narioki and Zusho's mutual disdain and mistrust for Nariakira led to their endeavoring to isolate Nariakira from Satsuma's affairs, which entailed withholding or all together ceasing the flow from all sources of information regarding Satsuma's officials or their dealings with the shogunate.Sakai. \\"Shimazu Nariakira\\". p224 Another formidable and dangerous obstacle for Nariakira in not only his plans to bolster the defenses of all of Japan but also his ascendancy to daimy≈ç of Satsuma was Yura, the mother of his half-brother, Hisamitsu.Sakai. \\"Shimazu Nariakira\\". p223 By the time Nariakira had arrived in Satsuma to address a crisis related to the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom (a vassal state under Satsuma) in 1846, Yura had used her charm to thoroughly convince Narioki to promote the interests of her son Hisamitsu over Narioki's legitimate son and heir-apparent (Nariakira). Zusho, Narioki, Yura, and Hisamitsu were the key members of the coalition which rallied other Satsuma bureaucrats who felt threatened by Nariakira's immense and highly intimidating intelligence, and tried to impede all attempts Nariakira made to retire his father as daimy≈ç and take his place. Nariakira arrived in Satsuma to attempt to resolve the Ry≈´ky≈´ crisis, as per the orders of shogunal high official Abe Masahiro, on June 25, 1846. A French ship had arrived in Ry≈´ky≈´ in 1844, and two British ships the following year, demanding treaties of amity and commerce; as the kingdom was semi-independent and not generally regarded to be part of Japan proper, this presented a dilemma. Nariakira and Abe Masahiro decided in the end that, despite the shogunate's policies of seclusion, such relations should be allowed in Ry≈´ky≈´, rather than risking violent conflict with the Western powers.Sakai. \\"The Satsuma-Ryukyu Trade.\\" p403. On March 8, 1847, Narioki arrived in Satsuma, making Nariakira's position, something equivalent to deputy to his father, obsolete. After essentially having the reins of power wrenched from his hands by his own father, Nariakira left Satsuma for Edo. The authority formerly vested him was clearly and quickly being shifted to his half brother, Hisamitsu Hisamitsu was rapidly elevated through the ranks of his father's court soon after Nariakira's departure from Satsuma for Edo. He was placed in charge of the newly created office of military service of Satsuma in October 1847. In 1848, Narioki appointed Hisamitsu steward of Chosa District, with the responsibility of acting on behalf of the daimy≈ç in all military matters in the area. At about the same time, Hisamitsu was given the highly respected post of han councilor, a rank which, according to the instructions accompanying the appointment, placed him at the top of the social scale. At ceremonial occasions, Hisamitsu was ordered by his father to sit at a place higher than that of the deputy in charge of the daimy≈ç of Satsuma's castle. Narioki even went so far as to place Hisamitsu in charge of all of Satsuma whenever the daimy≈ç chose to leave Satsuma for any reason, business or pleasure. It was apparent that Hisamitsu was being groomed to become the next daimy≈ç, completely disregarding the fact that, by primogeniture, Nariakira was supposed to be the heir-apparent. Shimazu Nariakira's daughters To further discredit and impede Nariakira's rise to lord of Satsuma, Yura was rumored to have asked at least five spiritual leaders to cast spells on Nariakira's eldest sons as well as take other measures to curse Nariakira's children. Many of Nariakira's followers believed Yura was the source of the subsequent deaths of his eldest children. This belief caused many of them to call for the assassination of Yura, her son Hisamitsu, and Zusho, whom they felt also played a hand in the deaths of Nariakira's eldest children. Nariakira was able to restrain them; upon hearing of their plans for murder, Narioki began rooting out Nariakira's supporters and ordering their deaths by seppuku.Ravina, 49 The conflict had gotten so far out of hand that Nariakira was left with no choice but to request aid from Abe Masahiro. Abe, seeing that Nariakira was being hindered in his proceeding with the Ry≈´ky≈´ crisis by his own father and family retainers, aided in getting Narioki to retire and removing Zusho. Abe first went about the task of removing Zusho, who was greatly relied upon by Narioki, by inviting him to Edo.Sakai. \\"Shimazu Nariakira\\". p226 Abe's stated purpose was a desire to discuss the Ry≈´ky≈´ crisis and its current handling. In the process of the conversation, Abe began to ask Zusho a line of questioning that made it apparently clear to Zusho that Abe, as well as the Tokugawa sh≈çgun, knew the truth of the illegal Satsuma- Ry≈´ky≈´-Western trade relations, which were being carried out against the shogunate's policy of seclusion. Zusho's devotion to Narioki pushed him to take full responsibility for the illicit trade by committing seppuku on December 18, 1848. On December 3, 1850, Narioki was called to Edo by the sh≈çgun and presented with a prized set of tea utensils, indicating the sh≈çgun's desire for Narioki to retire. On February 3, 1851, Nairoki retired and Shimazu Nariakira was made daimy≈ç of Satsuma. Love of education and Western culture A daguerreotype of Shimazu, the earliest surviving Japanese photograph. It was created by one of his retainers, Ichiki Shir≈ç in 1857. Nariakira was considered one of the wisest daimy≈ç of his time, thanks to his love of education. In order to better understand this point, his background and education must be considered. In 1812, at age three, Nariakira was designated the heir to the Satsuma lordship by his father. As with any daimy≈ç‚Äôs heir, Nariakira was prepared for his future role, by receiving a well-rounded education in the martial and scholarly arts.Ravina, 44 As stated above, Nariakira shared his grandfather Shigehide's fascination with Western culture and learning. The young Nariakira was fascinated by his grandfather's collection of western items, which included clocks, musical instruments, telescopes, microscopes, and weapons. In the course of his education, he was also taught how to read and write Roman letters, and would later use Roman letters to write Japanese words as a personal form of code. Shigehide also introduced Nariakira to Philipp Franz von Siebold, a German physician serving as the director of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie) in Nagasaki, making him one of the few Japanese to have actually met a Westerner. After he became daimy≈ç of Satsuma, Nariakira had Minayoshi Hotoku, a Satsuma physician,Minayoshi was ≈åkubo Toshimichi‚Äôs maternal grandfather to build the Iroha-maru, one of the first Western-style ships built in Japan. It was based on Minayoshi's , model. Nariakira then built a shipyard for Western-style shipbuilding at Sakurajima.Iwata, 33 He carried his love of Western culture into the military of Satsuma where he implemented Western-style cavalry and demanded annual military field maneuvers. However, without the Satsuma budget that had been so carefully restored by his enemy Zusho, none of this would have been possible. He also began enacting educational changes in Satsuma geared at bringing in Western science and technology. Nariakira established the Rangaku Koshujo, a school for the study of the Dutch language and Western culture.Iwata, 26 He would frequently visit schools and ask students to explain the meaning of the Confucian texts, to ensure that their Western learning did not corrupt their sense of nationalism. So strong was Nariakira's desire to raise well-educated youths that he set aside four koku annually to feed starving scholars, essentially a form of financial aid or scholarship. His goal in promoting education in Satsuma was to make sure the youths of Satsuma were ‚Äútaught to master themselves, rule their homes wisely, preserve national peace, and trust the universal power.‚Äù In 1848, Shimazu obtained the first daguerreotype camera ever imported into Japan, and ordered his retainers to study it and produce working photographs. Due to the limitations of the lens used and the lack of formal training, it took many years for a quality photograph to be created, but on September 17, 1857, a portrait of Shimazu in formal attire was produced.Anne Tucker et al., The History of Japanese Photography. Yale University Press, 2003. This photograph became an object of worship in the (also referred to as Sh≈çkoku Shrine) after Shimazu's death, but it later went missing.Darwin Marable, Through the Looking Glass: How Japanese Photography Came of Age. World and I, May 1, 2004. Lost for a century, the daguerreotype was discovered in a warehouse in 1975 and was later determined to be the oldest daguerreotype in existence created by a Japanese photographer. For this reason, it was designated an Important Cultural Property by the government of Japan in 1999, the first photograph ever given this honor.Philbert Ono, PhotoHistory 1999 , 2002. Associates and death In the course of his life, Nariakira made many friends in high places. These connections came in handy during his efforts to force the retirement of his father. Abe Masahiro, who at the time was a r≈çj≈´, was one of these friends. Abe spoke on behalf of the Tokugawa sh≈çgun in regards to Japan's national military defense and was the one who placed Nariakira in charge of Satsuma's dealing with the Ry≈´ky≈´ Western Trade Treaty crisis. Abe, and indirectly, the Tokugawa sh≈çgun, were disturbed by Nariakira's removal from responsibility over the Ry≈´ky≈´ Western Trade Treaty crisis because their policy concerning the crisis was predicated on their trust in him, not in his father or Zusho Hirosato. Narioki and Zusho had already proven themselves untrustworthy by not being completely reliable on matters concerning Ry≈´ky≈´. Abe knew that the only way Nariakira could gain control of the Ry≈´ky≈´ crisis was if his father and Zusho were removed; through Abe's intervention, this too was accomplished. Since Narioki and Zusho together ceased the flow of information regarding Satsuma's officials or their dealings with Ry≈´ky≈´ to Nariakira, Nariakira had to establish his own information-gathering network. He relied on Date Munenari of Uwajima to explain his predicament to the Tokugawa shogunate and Abe.Sakai. \\"Shimazu Nariakira\\". p225 He instructed his associates Yamaguchi Sadayasu and Shimazu Hisataka to gather information in Satsuma for him as well as keep a close watch on Zusho's activities with special emphasis on goods and money being brought into the domain. Nariakira then decided it was time to make his bid for the lordship of Satsuma. He relied on Date Munenari to report the situation for him and gain the sympathies of Abe. In a letter addressed to Date on August 27, 1848, Nariakira thanks him for obtaining Abe's assurance that he would overlook Nairoki and Zusho's transgressions and not take Satsuma to court as long as the Ry≈´ky≈´ problem was resolved satisfactorily. Date's correspondence with Abe served to hasten Narioki's retirement and Nariakira's ascendancy as daimy≈ç of Satsuma. Once Nariakira became daimy≈ç, he needed loyal men to ensure that Yura and Narioki's continued efforts to undermine his power did not succeed. Saig≈ç Takamori, a low-ranking Satsuma samurai, was promoted from assistant clerk, to Nariakira's attendant, in 1854.Ravina, 43 ≈åkubo Toshimichi was exiled by Narioki for supporting Nariakira, but once Nariakira came to power he was pardoned and rose rapidly through the ranks.Iwata 33 Saig≈ç and ≈åkubo worked on Nariakira's behalf, speaking with Nariaki, the lord of Mito to convince him to back Nariakira's view that government should have greater focus on the emperor and less on the sh≈çgun.Ravina, 61 Saigo and ≈åkubo adopted many of Nariakira's views, which would later become the foundation of the new Meiji government. These views included centralizing the government around the emperor, and Westernizing the Japanese military.Yates, 120 Nariakira was not the only one who had these opinions; others, such as Katsu Kaish≈´, Nakajima Sabur≈çsuke, and Nagai Naoyuki, saw the importance of modernization and support of the emperor. Shortly before his death, Nariakira was left with only a two-year-old son (Tetsumaru) and eight-year-old daughter (Teruhime). He had been forced to ask Narioki to decide between Hisamitsu or Hisamitsu's son Tadayoshi to succeed him as daimy≈ç.Ravina, 72 Saig≈ç and ≈åkubo felt the death of all of Nariakira's viable heirs was caused by Yura and wanted retribution, but Nariakira would not allow it.Yates, 62 On July 8, 1858, Nariakira was supervising the joint preparatory maneuvers in Tempozan for sending 3,000 Satsuma soldiers to Edo, and he succumbed to the heat. He was transported to Tsurumaru Castle, where he died on the 16th. A few years after his death, he was deified as a Shinto kami, Terukuni-daimy≈çjin. His son Tetsumaru died shortly after his father.

Applied as a thin coating, TiN is used to harden and protect cutting and sliding surfaces, for decorative purposes (due to its golden appearance), and as a non-toxic exterior for medical implants. In most applications a coating of less than is applied. Characteristics TiN has a Vickers hardness of 1800‚Äì2100, a modulus of elasticity of 251 GPa, a thermal expansion coefficient of 9.35 K‚àí1, and a superconducting transition temperature of 5.6 K. TiN will oxidize at 800 ¬∞C in a normal atmosphere. It is chemically stable at 20 ¬∞C, according to laboratory tests, but can be slowly attacked by concentrated acid solutions with rising temperatures. Depending on the substrate material and surface finish, TiN will have a coefficient of friction ranging from 0.4 to 0.9 against another TiN surface (non-lubricated). The typical TiN formation has a crystal structure of NaCl-type with a roughly 1:1 stoichiometry; TiNx compounds with x ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 are, however, thermodynamically stable. TiN becomes superconducting at cryogenic temperatures, with critical temperature up to 6.0 K for single crystals. Superconductivity in thin-film TiN has been studied extensively, with the superconducting properties strongly varying depending on sample preparation, up to complete suppression of superconductivity at a superconductor-insulator transition. A thin film of TiN was chilled to near absolute zero, converting it into the first known superinsulator, with resistance suddenly increasing by a factor of 100,000. Uses TiN-coated drill bit Gerber pocketknife A well-known use for TiN coating is for edge retention and corrosion resistance on machine tooling, such as drill bits and milling cutters, often improving their lifetime by a factor of three or more. Because of TiN's metallic gold color, it is used to coat costume jewelry and automotive trim for decorative purposes. TiN is also widely used as a top-layer coating, usually with nickel (Ni) or chromium (Cr) plated substrates, on consumer plumbing fixtures and door hardware. As a coating it is used in aerospace and military applications and to protect the sliding surfaces of suspension forks of bicycles and motorcycles as well as the shock shafts of radio controlled cars. TiN is non-toxic, meets FDA guidelines and has seen use in medical devices such as scalpel blades and orthopedic bone saw blades where sharpness and edge retention are important. TiN coatings have also been used in implanted prostheses (especially hip replacement implants) and other medical implants. Though less visible, thin films of TiN are also used in microelectronics, where they serve as a conductive connection between the active device and the metal contacts used to operate the circuit, while acting as a diffusion barrier to block the diffusion of the metal into the silicon. In this context, TiN is classified as a \\"barrier metal\\" (electrical resistivity ~ 25 ¬µŒ©¬∑cm), even though it is clearly a ceramic from the perspective of chemistry or mechanical behavior. Recent chip design in the 45 nm technology and beyond also makes use of TiN as a \\"metal\\" for improved transistor performance. In combination with gate dielectrics (e.g. HfSiO) that have a higher permittivity compared to standard SiO2 the gate length can be scaled down with low leakage, higher drive current and the same or better threshold voltage. Additionally, TiN thin films are currently under consideration for coating zirconium alloys for accident- tolerant nuclear fuels. Owing to their high biostability, TiN layers may also be used as electrodes in bioelectronic applications like in intelligent implants or in-vivo biosensors that have to withstand the severe corrosion caused by body fluids. TiN electrodes have already been applied in the subretinal prosthesis project as well as in biomedical microelectromechanical systems (BioMEMS). Fabrication Titanium nitride (TiN) coated punches using cathodic arc deposition technique The most common methods of TiN thin film creation are physical vapor deposition (PVD, usually sputter deposition, cathodic arc deposition or electron beam heating) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In both methods, pure titanium is sublimed and reacted with nitrogen in a high-energy, vacuum environment. TiN film may also be produced on Ti workpieces by reactive growth (for example, annealing) in a nitrogen atmosphere. PVD is preferred for steel parts because the deposition temperatures exceeds the austenitizing temperature of steel. TiN layers are also sputtered on a variety of higher melting point materials such as stainless steels, titanium and titanium alloys. Its high Young's modulus (values between 450 and 590 GPa have been reported in the literature ) means that thick coatings tend to flake away, making them much less durable than thin ones. Titanium nitride coatings can also be deposited by thermal spraying whereas TiN powders are produced by nitridation of titanium with nitrogen or ammonia at 1200 ¬∞C. Bulk ceramic objects can be fabricated by packing powdered metallic titanium into the desired shape, compressing it to the proper density, then igniting it in an atmosphere of pure nitrogen. The heat released by the chemical reaction between the metal and gas is sufficient to sinter the nitride reaction product into a hard, finished item. See powder metallurgy. Other commercial variants A knife with a titanium oxynitride coating There are several commercially used variants of TiN that have been developed since 2010, such as titanium carbon nitride (TiCN), titanium aluminium nitride (TiAlN or AlTiN), and titanium aluminum carbon nitride, which may be used individually or in alternating layers with TiN. These coatings offer similar or superior enhancements in corrosion resistance and hardness, and additional colors ranging from light gray to nearly black, to a dark iridescent bluish- purple depending on the exact process of application. These coatings are becoming common on sporting goods, particularly knives and handguns, where they are used for both cosmetic and functional reasons. As a constituent in steel making Titanium nitride is also produced intentionally within some steels by judicious addition of titanium to the alloy. TiN forms at very high temperatures because of its very low enthalpy of formation, and even nucleates directly from the melt in secondary steelmaking. It forms discrete, micrometre-sized cubic particles at grain boundaries and triple points, and prevents grain growth by Ostwald ripening up to very high homologous temperatures. Titanium nitride has the lowest solubility product of any metal nitride or carbide in austenite, a useful attribute in microalloyed steel formulas. Natural occurrence Osbornite is a very rare natural form of titanium nitride, found almost exclusively in meteorites.

Radha Soami,or RadhaSwami , or Radhasoami Satsang, is a spiritual organization founded by Shiv Dayal Singh in 1861 on Basant Panchami Day in Agra, India., Quote: \\"The date of Swami Shiv Dayal's first public discourse is Basant Panchami Day, February 15 1861\\", Quote: \\"The movement traces its origins to Swami Shiv Dayal Singh, who began his public ministry in Agra in 1861.\\" It derives its name from the word Radha meaning soul and Soami which refers to True God or One God as swami of His souls as all souls are created by him., Quote: \\"The term Radhasoami is composed of two words: Radha and Soami ‚Äì Radha was the favorite gopi (cowgirl) of the Hindu god Krishna and Soami literally means Lord.

The Radhasoamis, states Mark Juergensmeyer, are considered in Punjab as an offshoot of Sikhism, because the teachings of their founder were based, in part, on those of the founder of Sikhism ‚Äì Guru Nanak and many recite verses from the Adi Granth during their worship. However, they are also different from the Sikhs because they reject the Sikh idea that there are no present day Gurus beyond their first ten, many reject parts or all of the Khalsa Sikh dress code and rituals such as Karah Parshad. The Radhasoamis are a religious fellowship that accepts saints and living gurus from anywhere. in 2018, there were an estimated more tha 50 million Radhasoami followers worldwide , with many subsects based on the Guru. Of these, the Radha Soami Satsang Beas is the largest and it had 2 million followers. Radhasoami competing subsects have their own headquarters. There are over 30 different Radhasoami groups in the world. The largest group's contemporaneous headquarters are in Beas, with parallel branches found in India and outside India. Other subsects and movements influenced by Radhasoami include Divine Light Mission, Eckankar, Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, Science of Spirituality and others. Some of these groups have tried to distance themselves from the other. Succession upon the death of previous guru has been a source of controversies and schism in the Radhasoami movement since the beginning.263x263px Nomenclature According to Mark Juergensmeyer, the term Radhasoami literally refers to Radha as The Soul and Soami (swami, lord)., Quote: \\"The word Radhasoami literally refers to lord (swami) of his Souls., Radha\\" (p. 41); \\"The Beas group translates Radhasoami as 'lord of the soul' (p. 42). According to Saligram, quotes Juergensmeyer, these terms are symbolic and mean \\"master of energy\\", derived from the Vaishnava understanding of \\"Radha as the power of energy of God\\" (Shakti). It is a referent to the consciousness in a person and the cosmic energy source, states Juergensmeyer. The writings of Swami Dayal use the term Sat Nam, rather than Radhasoami. The gurus and the tradition that followed him used the term Radhasoami during the initiation rites, meditation practices and as mutual greeting. This has led to the fellowship being commonly called Radha Soami. In some subtraditions of Radhasoami, states Lucy DuPertuis, the guru's charisma is considered as the \\"formless absolute\\", being in his presence is equivalent to experiencing the incarnation of the Satguru, the guru is identified as the Radhasoami., Quote: \\"Various branches of Radhasoami have argued about the incarnationalism of Satguru (Lane, 1981). Guru Maharaj Ji has accepted it and identifies with Krishna and other incarnations of Vishnu.\\" Founder Lineage / Pranali of one of the largest groups of Radha Soami, Radha Swami Satsang Dinod. Soami Ji Maharaj, Saligram Ji Maharaj, Maharshi Shivbrat Lal Ji, Ram Singh Arman Maharaj, Param Sant Tarachand Ji Maharaj and present master Param Sant Huzur Kanwar Saheb Ji Maharaj. Radhasoami movement was founded by Shiv Dayal Singh in Agra. His parents were followers of Guru Nanak of Sikhism and a local spiritual guru Tulsi Saheb. After completing his education, Singh gained employment as a Persian language translator, left that role and spent increasing amount of his time to religious pursuits. His discourses attracted followers and thus the Radhasoami movement was founded when Swami ji gave initiation to Baba jaimal Singh ji who practised Surat shabad yoga on the bank of river Beas and the Dera Beas was Created. Beliefs and practices To the Radhsoamis, six elements form the framework of their faith: *a living guru (someone as locus of trust and truth), * bhajan (remembering Sat Nam, other practices believed to be transformative), * satsang (fellowship, community), * seva (serve others without expecting anything in return), * kendra (community organization, shrine), and * bhandara (large community gathering). The Radha Soami Satsang believes that living gurus are necessary for a guided spiritual life. They do not install the Guru Granth Sahib or any other scriptures in their sanctum, as they consider it ritualistic. Instead, the guru sits in the sanctum with the satsang (group of Sikh faithfuls) and they listen to preachings from the Adi Granth and sing hymns together. They believe in social equality, forbid caste distinctions and have attracted Dalits to their tradition. They are active outside India, and attracted converts to their movement. The Radhasoami are strict vegetarians. They are active in charitable work such as providing free medical services and help to the needy. They do not believe in orthodox Sikh ritual practices such as covering one's head inside the temple or removing shoes, nor do they serve karah prasad (offering) at the end of prayers. Their basic practices include Surat Shabd Yoga (sound assisted meditation), initiation of disciple into the path by a living guru, obedience to the guru, a moral life that is defined by abstinence from meat, drugs, alcohol and sex outside marriage. They also believe that jivanmukti or inner liberation is possible during one's lifetime with guidance of the living guru.

In its evolution, Ochnaceae has been unusual, in \\"reverting\\" to character states that are regarded as ancestral or primitive. For example, an actinomorphic floral symmetry has appeared twice in the subfamily Ochnoideae. Also, two clades of Ochnaceae, one in Ochnoideae and another in Quiinoideae have a derived condition very close to apocarpy. The complete separation of the carpels (apocarpy) is thought to be the ancestral state for angiosperms.Peter K. Endress. 2011. \\"Evolutionary diversification of the flowers in angiosperms\\".

American Journal of Botany 100(3):556-573. . (See External links below). A great many genus names have been published in Ochnaceae.The Plant List: Ochnaceae. (See External links below). In a taxonomic revision of Ochnaceae, as three families, in 2014, only 32 of these genera were accepted; one in Medusagynaceae, four in Quiinaceae, and 27 in Ochnaceae s.s.. In that same year, a 33rd genus, Neckia, was reestablished in order to preserve the monophyly of another genus, Sauvagesia. The largest genera in Ochnaceae are: Ouratea (200 species), Ochna (85), Campylospermum (65), Sauvagesia (39), and Quiina (34). None of the larger genera has been the subject of a phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences of selected genes. In one study of the subfamily Quiinoideae, based on the trn L-F intergenic spacer, only nine species were sampled from this subfamily.Julio V. Schneider, Ulf Swenson, Rosabelle Samuel, Tod Stuessy, and Georg Zizka. 2006. \\"Phylogenetics of Quiinaceae (Malpighiales): evidence from trnL-trnF sequence data and morphology\\".

Mostly shrubs and small trees, plus a few trees of moderate size, and in Sauvagesia, a few herbs. Leaves simple, except pinnately compound in Krukoviella, and in Quiinoideae, often pinnately lobed or compound on juvenile plants. Pinnate leaves are typical of Rhytidanthera. The leaves are often coriaceous and conspicuously serrate. Stipules present, except Medusagyne. Venation often scalariform (ladder-like) in appearance, with parallel and closely spaced secondary and tertiary veins. Petioles absent or short, sometimes resembling a pulvinus. Unisexual flowers are common in Medusagyne and in Quiinoideae (except Froesia), but restricted to a clade of three genera in Ochnoideae. Unisexual flowers are found in Schuurmansia, Schuurmansiella, and Euthemis. The flowers are always unisexual in Schuurmansiella. In polygamous species, flowers have been assessed as bisexual on the basis of morphology only. Pollen produced by apparently hermaphroditic flowers has, in a few cases, been found to be inaperturate, rendering the flower functionally female. Sepals 3 to 5, often unequal, sometimes accrescent. Petals 4 or 5, or rarely 3, 6, 7, or 8, often contort, free or fuzed at base only, sometimes reflexed over the sepals. Fertile stamens 5 to 10 or numerous, rarely one. Filaments sometimes persistent, sometimes narrowed near the anthers. Anthers basifixed or slightly dorsifixed, usually dehiscing by one or two apical or subapical pores, sometimes latrorsely by longitudinal slits. In Medusagyne and Quiinoideae, an enlarged septum separates the thecae. Staminodes often present, free or connate, sometimes petaloid, sometimes enveloping the fertile stamens. Nectar not produced. Flowers usually buzz-pollinated. Ovary superior, longitudinally ribbed in Medusagyne and Quiinoideae; unribbed in Ochnoideae. Carpels completely fused or nearly separate; 2-15, or up to 25 in Medusagyne. Style apical or gynobasic. Fruit sometimes winged; rarely a nut or drupe, often berry-like; usually a septicidal capsule, or else the ovary separating to form blackish drupelets on a usually reddish, accrescent receptacle. Seeds albuminous or exalbuminous, winged or not. The seed coat often includes a layer of cristarque cells. These are sclereids, each containing calcium oxalate crystals in the form of a druse.  Classification  Until near the end of the 20th century, Ochnaceae was regarded as a rather odd family, difficult to place with a high degree of certainty. Even into the 21st century, some authors treated the genus Strasburgeria as the closest relative of Ochnaceae, and some even placed it within the family.Armen L. Takhtajan (Takhtadzhian). Flowering Plants second edition (2009). Springer Science+Business Media. . . (See External links below). In the APG III system, Strasburgeria is grouped with Ixerba to form the family Strasburgeriaceae in the rosid order Crossosomatales.Peter F. Stevens (2001 onwards). \\"Ochnaceae\\" At: Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. At: Missouri Botanical Garden Website. (see External links below) More rarely, the genus Diegodendron was thought to be close to Strasburgeria and Ochnaceae. Molecular phylogenetic studies have strongly supported the inclusion of Diegodendron in the rosid order Malvales, and it is sometimes treated as a monospecific family therein.Clemens Bayer. 2003. Diegodendron. pages 175-177. In: Klaus Kubitzki (editor). 2003. The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants volume V. (volume editors: K. Kubitzki and C. Bayer). Springer-Verlag: Berlin, Heidelberg,, Germany. (print) (eBook). . Otherwise, it has been placed in Bixaceae, tho there is reason to suspect that it might be closer to Sphaerosepalaceae. All of the genera mentioned above, as well as Ochnaceae, were long regarded as anamalous taxa of uncertain affinity. All had been placed, at one time or another, with Ochnaceae, near Theaceae, a family now included in the basal asterid order Ericales. In 2012, an analysis of chloroplast DNA resolved Ochnaceae as sister to a group of five families known as the clusioids. This result had only weak bootstrap support. The clusioids were once regarded as a group of four families,Peter F. Stevens. 2007. \\"Clusiaceae - Guttiferae\\". pages 48-66. In: Klaus Kubitzki (editor). 2007. The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants volume IX. (volume editors: K. Kubitzki in collaboration with C. Bayer and P.F. Stevens). Springer-Verlag: Berlin, Heidelberg,, Germany. () () . but Clusiaceae was divided in 2009 and the name Calophyllaceae was resurrected for one of the resulting segregates.Brad R. Ruhfel, Peter F. Stevens, and Charles C. Davis. 2013. \\"Combined morphological and molecular phylogeny of the clusioid clade (Malpighiales) and the placement of the ancient rosid macrofossil Paleoclusia\\". International Journal of Plant Sciences 174(6):910‚Äì936. . There are only a few morphological characters that unite the clusioids with Ochnaceae. The petal aestivation is often contort in the clusioids, and usually so in Ochnaceae. In both groups, the flowers usually bear numerous stamens, and in the ovary, the placentation is mostly axile. In the ovules, the nucellus is often thin, and the outer integument is usually thicker than the inner.Peter K. Endress, Charles C. Davis, and Merran L. Matthews. 2013. \\"Advances in the floral structural characterization of the major subclades of Malpighiales, one of the largest orders of flowering plants\\". Annals of Botany 111(5): 969‚Äì985. . (See External links below).  Taxonomy  Ochnaceae is divided into three subfamilies: Medusagynoideae, Quiinoideae, and Ochnoideae. A molecular phylogenetic study resolved Medusagynoideae and Quiinoideae as sister subfamilies, but this result had only weak statistical support. In both subfamilies, the flowers are polystemonous. Except for the genus Froesia, many or all of the flowers are unisexual. The anthers contain a massive septum between the thecae that persists after anther dehiscence. The styles radiate outward from the ovary. At anthesis, the ovary is sculpted with longitudinal ribs.Merran L. Matthews, Maria do Carmo E. Amaral, and Peter K. Endress. 2012. \\"Comparative floral structure and systematics in Ochnaceae s.l. (Ochnaceae, Quiinaceae and Medusagynaceae; Malpighiales)\\". Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 170(3):299-392. . Medusagynoideae consists of a single species, Medusagyne oppositifolia. It is endemic to the island of Mah√© in the Seychelles.William C. Dickison. 1990. \\"The morphology and relationships of Medusagyne (Medusagynaceae)\\". Plant Systematics and Evolution 171(1-4):27-55. Quiinoideae comprises about 48 species in four genera: Froesia, Quiina, Touroulia, and Lacunaria. It is restricted to tropical America.Julio V. Schneider and Georg Zizka. in press. \\"Quiinaceae\\". Flora Neotropica monograph ??. Froesia is distinct from the other three genera. Its flowers are always bisexual, and the fruit consists of three structures that resemble follicles, except that they are not quite entirely separate from each other. The subfamily Ochnoideae was revised in 2014 as Ochnaceae sensu stricto. In that treatment, 27 genera were described. An additional genus, Neckia, was resurrected in that same year, based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study. Amaral and Bittrich (2014) divided Ochnoideae into three tribes: Luxemburgieae, Sauvagesieae, and Ochneae. The genus Testulea was included in the tribe Sauvagesieae. No subtribes were recognized. In 2014, a second reclassification of Ochnoideae was published, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences. In that paper, Schneider et alii divided Ochnoideae into four tribes: Testuleeae, Luxemburgieae, Sauvagesieae, and Ochneae. Their circumscription of the tribes was the same as that of Amaral and Bittrich (2014), except that Testulea was removed from Sauvagesieae into its own tribe, Testuleeae. Inclusion of Testulea in Sauvagesieae renders that tribe paraphyletic over Luxemburgieae. Testulea consists of a single species, Testulea gabonensis, that is endemic to Gabon. It is unique in Ochnoideae in that its leaves have a brochidodromous pattern of venation and its flowers are tetramerous. In addition, only one of the stamens is fertile. The others are modified into staminodes and united into a column for up to 2‚ÅÑ3 of their length. The tribe Luxemburgieae consists of two genera: Philacra and Luxemburgia. Philacra is native to Venezuela and northern Brazil. Luxemburgia is from Brazil. The tribe Sauvagesieae is pantropical in distribution, and consists of 16 genera, most of them small. The largest, by far, is Sauvagesia, with 38 species, 35 of which are restricted to the neotropics. Sauvagesia is heterogeneous, and might be paraphyletic, even with Neckia removed from it. Relationships in the tribe Sauvagesieae are not well understood, and for this reason, it has not been divided into subtribes. The tribe Ochneae is found in most of the tropics, but is most abundant in Africa and tropical America. It is distinguished from the rest of Ochnoideae by the absorption of the endosperm before the seed reaches maturity. Its nine genera belong to three subtribes: Lophirinae, Elvasiinae, and Ochninae. The subtribe Lophirinae consists of a single genus, Lophira. It has two species, both confined to tropical Africa. It produces an unusual fruit, in which two of the sepals become greatly enlarged and form wings that facilitate seed distribution by wind. The subtribe Elvasiinae consists of two genera, Perissocarpa and Elvasia, both confined to the American tropics. Perissocarpa has never been sampled for a molecular phylogenetic study. The subtribe Ochninae consists of six genera: Campylospermum, Ouratea, Idertia, Brackenridgea, Rhabdophyllum, and Ochna. The largest of these, Ouratea, is confined to the New World and contains all of the New World species in Ochninae. All of the genera in Ochneae appear to be monophyletic, as defined by Amaral and Bittrich (2014), but in one molecular phylogenetic study, Ouratea and Ochna received only weak bootstrap support in the maximum likelihood analysis. Idertia and Brackenridgea are probably sister genera, but no other relationships have been resolved among the genera of Ochninae.  Phylogeny  The phylogenetic tree below is adapted from the one that was published in 2014. Weakly supported nodes are collapsed to form polytomies. Maximum likelihood bootstrap support is > 75%, except where indicated. Perissocarpa and Indosinia have not been sampled for DNA. Their placement on the phylogenetic tree is based on anatomy and morphology only.  Evolution  The evolution of Ochnaceae has been unusual in that it has included two complete reversions to an actinomorphic floral symmetry and two nearly complete reversions to apocarpy, a condition in which the carpels are entirely separate. Actinomorphy and apocarpy are believed to be \\"primitive\\" character states in angiosperms.Douglas E. Soltis, Pamela S. Soltis, Peter K. Endress, and Mark W. Chase. 2005. Phylogeny and Evolution of Angiosperms. Sinauer Associates, Inc.: Sunderland, MA, USA. . Secondary apocarpy is especially rare and has arisen most notably in Rosaceae, Apocynaceae, Sapindales, and Malvales. The flowers are actinomorphic in Medusagyne and Quiinoideae, but in Ochnoideae, zygomorphy is the ancestral condition. In Testulea, Philacra, and Luxemburgia, the flowers develop zygomorphically in the bud. But in the four basal clades of Sauvagesieae, comprising the genera Blastemanthus, Godoya, Rhytidanthera, Krukoviella, Cespedesia, Fleurydora, Poecilandra, and Wallacea,, the flowers develop actinomorphically in the bud, then become zygomorphic after opening by growth of certain parts of the flower. Such late zygomorphy is very rare in flowering plants. In the remaining, fifth clade of Sauvagesieae, comprising the genera Neckia, Schuurmansia, Schuurmansiella, Euthemis, Tyleria, Adenarake, Indosinia, and Sauvagesia, the flowers remain actinomorphic after anthesis. In the tribe Ochneae, all of the species have actinomorphic flowers. In the subtribe Ochninae, and in the genus Froesia, the components of the ovary (carpels) are very shortly united at the base. Otherwise, the ovary in Ochnaceae is syncarpous, consisting of carpels that are completely fuzed. In Medusagyne and Quiinoideae, many of the flowers are unisexual, except in Froesia, where they are strictly hermaphrodite. In Ochnoideae, unisexual flowers are limited to a clade consisting of Schuurmansia, Schuurmansiella, and Euthemis. In Medusagyne and Quiinoideae, as in most angiosperms, the anthers open by longitudinal slits. In Ochnoideeae, the anther dehiscence is ancestrally poricidal, with several reversions to longitudinal slits. Testulea, Philacra, and Luxemburgia have anthers that open by apical pores. So do the three most basal clades of Sauvagesieae, namely Blastemanthus, Fleurydora, and a clade of four genera that have five carpels and many ovules per carpel (Godoya, Rhytidanthera, Krukoviella, and Cespedesia). Poecilandra has poricidal anther dehiscence, but in its sister genus, Wallacea, the anthers open by longitudinal slits. In the rest of Sauvagesieae, anther dehiscence is various. In Schuurmansia, Schuurmansiella, and Adenarake, the anther dehiscence is apically longicidal. This means that the longitudinal slit is short, and does not extend far from the apical end of the anther. In some species of Sauvagesia, the anthers split lengthwise, but the entire androecium is wrapped in petaloid staminodes, so that the pollen can escape from only the apex of the anther. This is known as a poricidal system because it functions as if the anthers were truly poricidal. In the tribe Ochneae, anther dehiscence by longitudinal slits is restricted to Brackenridgea and a few species of Ochna. Testulea is peculiar in having only one fertile stamen. Its anther opens by an apical pore. The other stamens are modified into sterile staminodes that are fuzed into a column for up to 2‚ÅÑ3 of their length. In the genera Froesia and Quiina, and in the tribe Ochneae, the endosperm is completely absorbed early in seed development. It is not clear whether the presence or absence of endosperm is the ancestral state in Ochnaceae. For a long time, the subfamily Ochnoideae was divided into two groups based on this character alone. In such a classification, the group containing endosperm would be paraphyletic over Ochneae because it would contain Testulea, Philacra, and Luxemburgia. The number of ovules per carpel varies widely in Ochnaceae. Medusagyne and Quiinoideae have two ovules per carpel. In Testulea and in a clade of four genera in Sauvagesieae (Godoya, Rhytidanthera, Krukoviella, and Cespedesia), the number of ovules is 100 to 200 per carpel. For the remainder of Sauvagesieae, except Euthemis, and for Philacra and Luxemburgia, the number of ovules per carpel ranges from four to 50. Euthemis has two ovules per carpel. In Ochneae, Lophira has 4 to 50 ovules per carpel. In the subtribes Elvasiinae and Ochninae, the number of ovules per carpel is one.  History  The family Ochnaceae was erected by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1811.Ochnaceae in International Plant Names Index. (see External links below).James L. Reveal. 2008 onward. \\"A Checklist of Family and Suprafamilial Names for Extant Vascular Plants.\\" At: Home page of James L. Reveal and C. Rose Broome. (see External links below). At that time, he described Elvasia, a new genus in the family, and he included three others: Ochna, Walkera, and Gomphia.Augustin Pyramus de Candolle. 1811. Nouveau bulletin des sciences par la Soci√©t√© philomathique de Paris 2(40):208. (See External links below). Walkera was described by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1789, but is no longer recognized. Its type species was described as Gomphia serrata by Andrias Kanis in 1968,Andrias Kanis. 1968. \\"A revision of the Ochnaceae of the Indo-Pacific area\\". Blumea 16(1):1-83. but it is now placed in the genus Campylospermum. Gomphia has long been a source of confusionWerner Greuter and Rosa Rankin Rodr√≠guez. 2014. \\"A type for Gomphia (Ochnaceae) - once again\\". Taxon 63(5):1122-1123. and it was not recognized in the most recent revision of Ochnaceae. Godoya and Sauvagesia were known in 1811, when de Candolle erected the family Ochnaceae, but he placed them in other families. In his Prodromus, he placed Godoya in the family that would later be known as Clusiaceae.Augustin Pyramus de Candolle. 1824. \\"Violaceae\\" (as Violarieae), pages 287-316; Clusiaceae (as Guttiferae), pages 557-564; \\"Ochnaceae\\", pages 735-738. In: Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis volume 1. (See External links below). He regarded Lauradia (Lavradia) as separate from Sauvagesia, and placed both of them in Violaceae. He added the genus Castela to Ochnaceae, but it is now part of Simaroubaceae.Joshua W. Clayton. 2011. \\"Simaroubaceae\\", pages 408-423. In: Klaus Kubitzki (editor). 2011. The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants volume X. Springer-Verlag: Berlin, Heidelberg,, Germany. (print). (eBook). De Candolle believed that Simaroubaceae was closely related to Ochnaceae, but it is now placed in the order Sapindales. A few authors placed Godoya, Sauvagesia, and others in the family Sauvagesiaceae, until the beginning of the 21st century. Other authors, such as Adolf Engler, included them in Ochnaceae. In 1874, Engler divided Ochnaceae into two groups, based on the absence or presence of endosperm in the mature seed.H.G. Adolf Engler. 1874. \\"Ueber Begrenzung und systematische Stellung der nat√ºrlichen Familie der Ochnaceae\\". Nova Acta Academieae Caesarieae Leopoldino - Carolinae Germanicae Naturae Curiosorum 37(2):1-28. (See External links below). The group without endosperm corresponds to de Candolle's concept of Ochnaceae, and to the modern tribe Ochneae. The group with endosperm is now known to be paraphyletic and consists of the tribes Testuleeae, Luxemburgieae, and Sauvagesieae. In 1876, in a flora of Brazil, Engler described many new species in Ochnaceae, especially in its largest genus, Ouratea.H.G. Adolf Engler. 1876. \\"Ochnaceae\\" In: Carl F.P. von Martius and August Wilhelm Eichler (editors). Flora Brasiliensis 12(2):297-366. (See External links below). He described 85 species in Ouratea, 17 of which he named as new species at that time. He also transferred 63 species to Ouratea from other genera. The genera Quiina and Touroulia had been known since 1775, when they were described by Jean Baptiste Aublet,Jean Baptiste C.F. Aublet. 1775. Histoire des Plantes de la Guiane Fran√ßoise:  * . Quiina: Supplement to volumes 1 and 2, page 19; Touroulia: 1:492; Ouratea: 1:397. (See External links below). and they were variously classified by 19th century taxonomists. Jacques Denys Choisy erected the family Quiinaceae (as Quiinac√©es) for them in 1849,Jacques Denys Choisy. 1849. Description des Guttiferes de l'Indie,  * :12. but he did not meet the requirements for valid publication of a botanical name. The name Quiinaceae was validated by Engler in Flora Brasiliensis in 1888.H.G. Adolf Engler. 1888. \\"Quiinaceae\\". pages 475-486 and tables 109-110. In: Carl F.P. von Martius and August Wilhelm Eichler (editors). Flora Brasiliensis 12(1). (See External links below). The genus Medusagyne had been described by John Gilbert Baker in 1877, in a flora of Mauritius and the Seychelles,John Gilbert Baker. 1877. Flora of Mauritius and the Seychelles: 16. L. Reeve & Co.: London, UK. (See External links below). but it was not until 1924 that it was segregated into its own monogeneric family.H.G.Adolf Engler and Ernest F. Gilg. 1924. Syllabus der Pflanzenfamilien: eine √úbersicht  * neunte und zehnte auflage: 280. (Syllabus of the Plant Families: an overview  * editions 9 and 10, page 280.) In 1893, Ernest Friedrich Gilg covered Ochnaceae, and Adolf Engler covered Quiinaceae for the first edition of Die Nat√ºrlichen Pflanzenfamilien.Ernest F. Gilg. 1893. \\"Ochnaceae\\". pages 131-153. In: H.G. Adolf Engler and Karl A.E. Prantl (editors). 1895. Die Nat√ºrlichen Pflanzenfamilien 1st edition: Teil III, Abteilung 6 (volume 3, part 6). Verlag von Wilhelm Engelmann: Leipzig, Germany.

Die Nat√ºrlichen Pflanzenfamilien 1st edition: Teil III, Abteilung 6 (volume 3, part 6). Verlag von Wilhelm Engelmann: Leipzig, Germany. (See External links below). Engler wrote a description of Medusagyne in a supplement to the first edition of DNP in 1897.H.G. Adolf Engler. 1897. Medusagyne. page 250. In: H.G. Adolf Engler. 1897. \\"Guttiferae\\". pages 247-250. In: H.G. Adolf Engler and Karl A.E. Prantl. 1897. Die Nat√ºrlichen Pflanzenfamilien: Nachtr√§ge [I] zum II-IV Teil. (The Natural Plant Families: First Supplement for volumes 2-4). (See External links below). He placed Medusagyne under the heading \\"Zweifelhafte, m√∂glicherweise zu den Guttiferae geh√∂rige Gattung\\" (Doubtful, possibly a genus belonging to Guttiferae). Guttiferae is an obsolete name for Clusiaceae. In 1902, Philippe van Tieghem recognized six families in what is now the subfamily Ochnoideae.Philippe E.L. van Tieghem. 1902. \\"Sur les Ochnac√©es\\". Annales des Sciences Naturelles - botanique, s√©ries 8 16:161-416. These were Luxemburgiaceae, Sauvagesiaceae, Wallaceaceae, Euthemidaceae, Lophiraceae, and Ochnaceae. Three of these, (Wallaceaceae, Euthemidaceae, and Lophiraceae) were monogeneric and were erected by van Tieghem at that time. His Luxemburgiaceae included the basal clades of what is now the tribe Sauvagesieae. Van Tieghem named a great many genera in 1902, circumscribing them very narrowly. In what is now the subtribe Ochninae, he delineated 53 genera. The most recent revision of that group divides it into six genera. In 1925, for the second edition of DNP, Engler and Gilg expanded on their treatment of Quiinaceae and Ochnaceae, respectively, compared to what they had written in 1893.H.G. Adolf Engler. 1925. \\"Quiinaceae\\". pages 106-108. In: H.G. Adolf Engler and Karl A.E. Prantl (editors). 1925. Die Nat√ºrlichen Pflanzenfamilien: zweite auflage 21 Band.

Prantl (editors). 1925. Die Nat√ºrlichen Pflanzenfamilien: zweite auflage 21 Band. (The Natural Plant Families: 2nd edition, volume 21). Verlag von Wilhelm Engelmann: Leipzig, Germany. Medusagynaceae was covered in the same volume of DNP by Adolf Engler and Hans Melchior.Hans Melchior. 1925. \\"Medusagynaceae\\". pages 50-52. In: H.G. Adolf Engler and Karl A.E. Prantl (editors). 1925. Die Nat√ºrlichen Pflanzenfamilien: zweite auflage 21 Band. (The Natural Plant Families: 2nd edition, volume 21). Verlag von Wilhelm Engelmann: Leipzig, Germany. For the second edition of DNP, Engler recognized two genera, Quiina and Touroulia, in Quiinaceae. Lacunaria and Froesia were discovered later and named in 1925 and 1948, respectively. In that same volume, Gilg divided his Ochnaceae (equivalent to modern Ochnoideae) into 21 genera, including Indovethia, Leitgebia, Vausagesia, and Lauradia (as Lavradia), which are now regarded as synonyms of Sauvagesia. Eight of the modern genera, (Philacra, Krukoviella, Fleurydora, Tyleria, Adenarake, Indosinia, Perissocarpa, and Idertia) consist of plants that had not been uncovered by botanical exploration at that time. Gilg placed Rhytidanthera in synonymy under Godoya, but Rhytidanthera is accepted today. He included Campylospermum and Rhabdophyllum in Gomphia and placed Gomphia in synonymy under Ouratea. In his revision of Ochnaceae, Gilg provided a summary of van Tieghem's classification, as well as his own. Three of van Tieghem's genera, (Campylospermum, Rhabdophyllum, and Rhytidanthera) are still recognized today. In 1968, Andrias Kanis published a paper that greatly influenced subsequent work in Ochnaceae, right up to the 2014 revision. Claude H.L. Sastre named many new species in Ochnaceae, in several papers from 1970 to 2003. In 1991, a cladistic analysis was published for Ochnaceae.Maria do Carmo E. Amaral. 1991. \\"Phylogenetische Systematik der Ochnaceae\\". Botanische Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte, und Pflanzengeographie 113(1):105-196. In that same year, Neckia, a 28th genus for Ochnoideae, was resurrected in a molecular phylogenetic study based on four chloroplast DNA loci, and nuclear ribosomal ITS. Seventy-nine species of Ochnaceae were sampled and a new classification was presented. Also, Testulea was removed from the tribe Sauvagesieae, and placed in the monotypic tribe Testuleeae.

She is a comic book superhero published by DC Comics. Lorena debuted in Aquaman vol. 6 #16 (May 2004), and was created by Will Pfeifer and Patrick Gleason. =Fictional character biography= Lorena Marquez is on a date at the San Diego Zoo when an earthquake shakes San Diego and causes it to sink deep into the sea, killing thousands‚Äîincluding Lorena's entire family. She comes into contact with Aquaman, who nurses her back to health as she discovers that she has developed the ability to breathe underwater like an Atlantean. The two manage to locate the other survivors of the quake, as well as Anton Geist, the scientist responsible for the catastrophe. Lorena and Aquaman have no choice but to begin rebuilding the city as \\"Sub Diego\\".

Apparently, as one of the last Sub Diegoans able to breathe water, she is left in the seas, mourning Koryak's death in the rubble of Poseidonis. She then joins Curry, Cal Durham, Tempest, and the new Topo in their voyage to Sub Diego. Aquagirl appears up in Terror Titans #1 and is kidnapped (along with a group of other teen superheroes) by the Terror Titans. While her teammate Molecule is slain by the new Persuader, Lorena is taken alive, to be mindwiped and forced to fight in the Dark Side Club at the behest of the Apokoliptan Gods on Earth.

In her appearances, Tula seemingly demonstrates a partial shapeshifting ability, changing parts of her body to resemble those of sea creatures. She is last seen battling Donna Troy during the climatic battle at the superhuman Gulag and is possibly killed by the nuclear explosion that ends the conflict. This Tula's mother is possibly Deep Blue, described in annotations for the series as \\"Mizuko Perkins\\", daughter of Tsunami and Neptune Perkins. In standard DC Comics continuity, Deep Blue is Aquaman's half-sister Debbie, the daughter of Tsunami and Atlan, raised by Tsunami and Neptune Perkins. In the Titans Tomorrow timeline, Lorena is Aquawoman, a member of the Titans. It is revealed that she has developed telepathic powers which she had used to kill (or paralyze) former Titan member Garth. In other media =Television= Animated Young Justice *In Batman Beyond, Aquagirl is Mareena, a member of the future Justice League and the daughter of Aquaman. The character was created specifically for the Batman Beyond two-part episode \\"The Call\\", in which Batman meets the \\"Justice League Unlimited\\", a future version of the Justice League. Aquagirl was voiced by Jodi Benson. When Batman is going over her file on the computer, it is shown that she is the daughter of Aquaman, with powers including control over water. She later reappears in the Justice League Unlimited series (which showcases the present-day lineup of the JLU) in \\"Epilogue\\". She has very distinctive platinum blonde hair; it is always wet and slicked evenly back. Her costume varies; she is usually portrayed wearing a one-piece swimsuit of various colors with bare arms and legs and fingerless gloves. *Tula (though she is never referred to as Aquagirl in season one) first appears in Young Justice in the episode \\"Downtime\\", voiced by Cree Summer. She is portrayed as the childhood friend of Kaldur'ahm, who ultimately entered into a relationship with his friend, Garth after Kaldur left Atlantis to become Aquaman's sidekick. Unlike in the comics, the Tula in Young Justice possesses mystical powers that can help her create, control and manipulate water into any shape she wishes, powers that many atlanteans have. When Kaldur returns to Poseidonis for a dinner with the royal family, he invites Tula as his guest, unaware that she has already left him for his best friend. She eventually tells him about this and the two reconcile during an attack on the city led by Black Manta, with Kaldur departing on friendly terms when he eventually returns to the surface world. Tula and Garth make a cameo appearance in the episode \\"Failsafe\\", working alongside Red Arrow, Rocket and Zatanna in a training simulation. In the episode \\"Alienated\\" (set five years later, in Young Justice: Invasion) it is mentioned that Tula's death (during the events of the video game, Young Justice: Legacy) is one of the reasons Aqualad has apparently turned on his former team (while actually going undercover to investigate the Light's partner) this is the first instance of Tula being referenced as Aquagirl in the series. In \\"Satisfaction\\", her statue is among the other yellow statues of fallen heroes located in the grotto of Mount Justice. In \\"The Fix\\", Tula appears as a psychic projection when Miss Martian and Artemis Crock psionically enter Aqualad's subconscious mind. Live-action In season two of Entourage, Mandy Moore portrays Aquagirl in the Aquaman movie that exists in the Entourage fictional universe. The storyline has Moore, playing herself as the ex-girlfriend of character Vince, about to be dropped from the project due to the turmoil of their personal relationship. Mandy is not removed from the movie however, and Vince and Mandy re-kindle their former romance. Following this, Mandy breaks Vince's heart again, stating that she still loves her former fianc√©, Chris. Vince decides to continue working on the movie with Mandy still attached. It then becomes the highest-grossing movie opening of all time. =Film= Tula makes a cameo appearance in Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox as a member of Aquaman's army in the altered timeline. She is killed in the final battle with the Amazons. =Video games= Tula, as Aquagirl, appears in Young Justice: Legacy, with Cree Summer reprising the role. She serves as the coordinator of the Team, providing information on The Light's attempts to steal the pieces of an ancient statue, and keeping the pieces safe. Near the end of the game, Klarion disguised as Tempest tricks her into giving him the pieces of the statue, and kidnaps her, intending to use her magic to revive Tiamat in Bialya. The Team arrives to free Tula and defeat Klarion and Blockbuster, but is too late to stop Tiamat's revival. When Tiamat proves too powerful to kill, a weakened Tula offers to use her remaining magic to defeat and imprison Tiamat again, sacrificing herself just like Marduk did in ancient times. Tula succeeds, but is killed by falling debris. Tempest grieves her death, and Aqualad quits the Team, leading up to the events in the second season of the show.

Murphy is also located within the census- designated place bearing its name. Murphy is home to the Owyhee County Historical Museum and Library. History Murphy developed around a railhead of the Boise, Nampa and Owyhee Railroad, built in 1899 by Colonel William H. Dewey. Dewey had planned to extend the railroad to Silver City, but when mining operations in the Owyhee Mountains became unproductive, the line was not continued past Murphy. The railroad operated until 1947. By a narrow margin, Owyhee County voters selected Murphy as county seat in 1934, succeeding Silver City (which was located in the Owyhee Mountains and had been in decline; it is now defunct). Although the county seat was moved to Murphy after the vote, and a new Owyhee County Courthouse was constructed in 1936, the Idaho State Legislature did not ratify the change of county seat until 1999. The error in the Idaho Code, discovered by county prosecutor G. Edward Yarbrough, was finally corrected by Senate Bill 1009. The community likely was named after Cornelius \\"Con\\" Murphy, a crew boss with the Boise, Nampa and Owyhee Railroad and foreman during construction of the Guffey Bridge in 1897. Another source for the name may have been Pat Murphy, a Silver City mining engineer and friend of railroad owner Dewey.

It was the first television show to feature the Smothers Brothers as regulars, following a series of night club and guest appearances. It lasted one season, consisting of 32 episodes. It was also the network's last situation comedy filmed in black-and-white; shortly after its final telecast, all CBS prime-time series were transmitted in color. In 1986, two decades after cancellation, reruns were seen on Nick at Nite. Synopsis Dick Smothers played himself as a rising young executive at Pandora Publications, working for publisher Leonard J. Costello (Roland Winters). Brother Tom had been lost at sea two years earlier and now shows up as an apprentice angel assigned to do good deeds on Earth to earn his wings and become a full-fledged angel. Of course, Tom's efforts to help people never seem to work as planned and Dick had to help him clean up the mess. Tom received his orders from Ralph, his unseen and unheard boss. The series also featured Harriet MacGibbon as Mrs. Costello, and on occasion, Ann Elder as Dick's co-worker and girl friend Janet (Eileen O'Neill) also appeared in several episodes as another of Dick's girl friends, Wanda. As was typical of the Smothers Brothers in The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, Dick was typically the straight man to Tom's humorous antics. =Creative control struggles= The series was produced by Four Star Television in association with the brothers' Knave Productions (named for Tom's catchphrase \\"Curb Your Tongue, Knave!\\", and the title of their 1963 record album). This series may have inspired the Brothers' more successful later series The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in that Tom Smothers had been critical of the series as not being compatible with the brothers' strengths (in fact, he fought with Four Star executives over more creative control of the series, earning an ulcer and irritating his marital relationship to the point of divorce at the end of the season). For instance, neither brother played their instruments on the show (with one exception, at the beginning of \\"'Twas The Week Before Christmas\\" episode), and it was not until halfway through the season that they sang the theme song.

The corpus luteum (the remains of an ovulated ovarian follicle) is responsible for the development of maternal behavior and lactation, which are mediated by the continued production of progesterone by the corpus luteum through some or all of pregnancy. In most species, the corpus luteum is degraded in the absence of a pregnancy. However, in some species, the corpus luteum may persist in the absence of pregnancy and cause \\"pseudopregnancy\\", in which the female will exhibit clinical signs of pregnancy.  Cats  Pseudopregnancy occurs when a female cat ovulates but is not fertilised due to breeding with an infertile male, spontaneous ovulation or due to the owner stimulating ovulation. The corpus luteum is present after ovulation and persists for around 37 days. The length of pseudopregnancy varies greatly with the mean duration being 41 days. After pseudopregnancy, the female cat returns to proestrus and can become pregnant again. The pseudopregnancy lasts around half the length of a normal pregnancy in cats. This is advantageous to cats as they can conceive earlier making them more efficient in reproduction. Cats become pseudopregnant following an estrus in which the queen is bred by an infertile male. Queens are induced ovulators, meaning that they will only ovulate and produce a corpus luteum if they are bred. The corpus luteum persists as if the queen were pregnant because the queen's body cannot distinguish between the pregnant and non-pregnant state (aside from the initial mechanical trigger of coitus). Pseudopregnant queens rarely show any mammary enlargement or behavioral signs and therefore rarely require treatment. Pseudopregnancy in cats is uncommon as the queen must be bred by an infertile male to become pseudopregnant, compounded by the fact that cats are seasonal breeders. The progesterone and estradiol profiles in pseudopregnancy are very different when compared to normal pregnancy. During pseudopregnancy, estradiol increases straight after mating and then decreases to normal levels. The amount of progesterone does not increase until 2-3 days post copulation, then the level rises until day 21 post copulation where after it gradually declines to normal levels.  Dogs  Pseudopregnancy is a normal physiologic process that occurs in female dogs. It is seen 45-60 days after a normal estrous (heat) period. After ovulation, progesterone levels rise. Pseudopregnancy happens when the progesterone levels begin to fall as decreasing progesterone leads to an increase of the hormone prolactin. Prolactin is responsible for the behaviours seen during pseudopregnancy. Dogs may exhibit mothering of toys, nesting or aggression. Mammary development and milk production are common. Pseudopregnancy can also be acutely induced by spaying (removing of ovaries) a dog near the end of estrus. Spaying removes the source of progesterone and induces a rise in prolactin. Permanent prevention of pseudopregnancy is accomplished with spaying. Dogs become pseudopregnant following an estrus phase in which the female dog is not bred, or in which she is bred by an infertile male. Most species require signals from an embryo (such as IFN-œÑ in ruminants) to alert the female's body of a pregnancy. This maternal recognition of pregnancy will cause persistence of the corpus luteum and the development of characteristics and behaviors necessary to care for offspring. Limited research suggests that progesterone secretion is similar in pregnant and non-pregnant female dogs, so veterinary researchers hypothesize that they may not require molecular factors from the embryo for maternal recognition of pregnancy, and instead the corpus luteum persists regardless of pregnancy. Since the corpus luteum is not degraded, it will cause the development of maternal characteristics in the absence of pregnancy. Pseudopregnant dogs will develop their mammary glands, lactate, and build nests to varying degrees depending on breed. Although female dogs usually only cycle once or twice per year, pseudopregnancy is common.  Swine  Pseudopregnancy or \\"not-in-pig\\" is a condition that occurs when females exhibit physiological and behavioral signs associated with pregnancy, but there are no fetuses present. Pseudopregnancy can occur when all of the embryos are resorbed after the maternal recognition of pregnancy (days 10-15 postmating) and before fetal calcification (days 35-40 of gestation). The sow remains in anoestrus for prolonged periods, often as long as 115 days. These animals may exhibit varying degrees of udder development, but fail to deliver any pigs. The timely identification and removal of non- pregnant females from the breeding herd is important because it reduces both non-productive sow days and production costs. Techniques used for pregnancy diagnosis in swine include ultrasonography, amplitude depth machines, and Doppler machines. Mycotoxins have been shown to be detrimental to sows and gilts by causing the female to retain a corpora lutea inhibiting cyclicity and causing a pseudopregnancy; as well as a constant exhibition of estrus, and infertility. Pregnant females produce litters that result in a higher number of stillborns, mummified fetuses, and abortions. Before breeding, ingesting mycotoxins mimics the action of estradiol-17Œ≤. Specifically, zearalenone binds to estrogenic receptors that would normally bind to estrogen, causing the female to exhibit constant estrus.  Rats  The initiation of pseudopregnancy is basically similar to the pregnancy regarding the activation of progestational state. The neuroendocrine pathway of pseudopregnancy in rats is mainly initiated by the nocturnal surge of prolactin. The hormone prolactin produced regulates the activation and early maintenance of corpus luteum. The corpus luteum is known as a site of progesterone production in order for the uterus undergoes a decidual process. There are two types of induced pseudopregnancy; coitally induced pseudopregnancy and non-coitally induced pseudopregnancy. Rat The coitally induced pseudopregnancy is stimulated by the action of copulation. The copulation stimulation causes the nocturnal prolactin elevation which then activates the corpus luteum. The multiple intromission coital pattern initiates the neuroendocrine reflex which results in the sufficient progesterone secretion in pseudopregnancy. However, induction of pseudopregnancy requires adrenergic system to be activated and simultaneously inhibits the cholinergic system. The non-coitally induced pseudopregnancy requires the presence of the initial stimulus until the levels of progesterone are sufficiently elevated to produce positive feedback on secretion of prolactin. The initial stimulus can be in a form of some socio- environmental factors, such as concaveation with foster pups in virgin rats or cohabitation in all-female groups in mice.  Mice  Mice become pseudopregnant following an estrus in which the female is bred by an infertile male, resulting in sterile mating. Like dogs, mice are spontaneous ovulators. However, they will not become pseudopregnant following an estrus in which the female does not mate because the corpus luteum will degrade rapidly in the absence of coitus. When the female is mated by an infertile male, the corpus luteum persists without an embryo, leading to pseudopregnancy. The female will develop mammary glands, lactate, and build nests in the pseudopregnant state. Pseudopregnancy in mice is somewhat common in laboratory mice because it is often induced for the purpose of implanting embryos into a surrogate dam, but is uncommon in wild mice because most wild males are fertile and will genuinely impregnate the female.

It is found in most of the Eastern Hemisphere, including Southern Europe, Africa and Madagascar, as well as the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent.Altervista Flora Italiana, Zigolo dolce, Yellow Nutsedge, Cyperus esculentus L. includes photographs plus distribution maps for Europe and North AmericaFlora of China, Vol. 23 Page 232, you suo cao Cyperus esculentus Linnaeus var. sativus Boeckeler, Linnaea. 36: 290. 1870. C. esculentus is cultivated for its edible tubers, called earth almonds or tiger nuts, as a snack food and for the preparation of horchata de chufa, a sweet, milk-like beverage. Cyperus esculentus can be found wild, as a weed, or as a crop. It is an invasive species outside its native range, and is readily transported accidentally to become invasive. In many countries, C. esculentus is considered a weed. It is often found in wet soils such as rice paddies and peanut farms as well as well-irrigated lawns and golf courses during warm weather. History It has been suggested that the extinct hominin Paranthropus boisei (the \\"Nutcracker Man\\") subsisted on tiger nuts. C. esculentus was one of the oldest cultivated plants in prehistoric and Ancient Egypt, where it was an important food. Roots of wild chufa have been found at Wadi Kubbaniya, north of Aswan, dating to around 16,000 BC. Dry tubers also appear later in tombs of the Predynastic period, around 3000 BC. During that time, C. esculentus tubers were consumed either boiled in beer, roasted, or as sweets made of ground tubers with honey. The tubers were also used medicinally, taken orally, as an ointment, or as an enema, and used in fumigants to sweeten the smell of homes or clothing. Chufa continued to be an important source of food in the Dynastic period, and cultivation of the plant remained exclusively in Egypt.Daniel Zohary and Maria Hopf, Domestication of plants in the Old World, third edition (Oxford: University Press, 2000), p. 198 Botany Young plant with tuber Cyperus esculentus is an annual or perennial plant, growing to tall, with solitary stems growing from a tuber. The plant is reproduced by seeds, creeping rhizomes, and tubers. Due to its clonal nature, C. esculentus can take advantage of soil disturbances caused by anthropogenic or natural forces. The stems are triangular in section and bear slender leaves wide. The spikelets of the plant are distinctive, with a cluster of flat, oval seeds surrounded by four hanging, leaf-like bracts positioned 90 degrees from each other. They are long and linear to narrowly elliptic with pointed tips and 8 to 35 florets. The color varies from straw- colored to gold-brown. They can produce up to 2420 seeds per plant. The plant foliage is very tough and fibrous and is often mistaken for a grass. The roots are an extensive and complex system of fine, fibrous roots and scaly rhizomes with small, hard, spherical tubers and basal bulbs attached. The tubers are in diameter and the colors vary between yellow, brown, and black.^ USGS Weeds in the West project: Status of introduced Plants in Southern Arizona Parks, Factsheets for Cyperus esculentus L., 2003, Tucson, Arizona One plant can produce several hundred to several thousand tubers during a single growing season. With cool temperatures, the foliage, roots, rhizomes, and basal bulbs die, but the tubers survive and resprout the following spring when soil temperatures remain above . They can resprout up to several years later. When the tubers germinate, many rhizomes are initiated and end in a basal bulb near the soil surface. These basal bulbs initiate the stems and leaves above ground, and fibrous roots underground. C. esculentus is wind pollinated and requires cross pollination as it is self‚Äìincompatible. Invasiveness C. esculentus is a highly invasive species in Oceania, Mexico, some regions of the United States, and the Caribbean, mainly by seed dispersion. It is readily transported internationally, and is adaptable to re-establish in varied climate and soil environments. In Japan, it is an exotic clonal weed favorable to establish in wet habitats. Cultivation Cultivation and growing of the xufa in the Land of Valencia, file by Valencian Museum of Ethnology =Climate requirements= Cyperus esculentus cultivation requires a mild climate. Low temperature, shade, and light intensity can inhibit flowering. Tuber initiation is inhibited by high levels of nitrogen, long photoperiods, and high levels of gibberellic acid. Flower initiation occurs under photoperiods of 12 to 14 hours per day. =Soil requirements= Tubers can develop in soil depths around 30 cm (1-foot), but most occur in the top or upper part. They tolerate many adverse soil conditions including periods of drought and flooding and survive soil temperatures around . They grow best on sandy, moist soils at a pH between 5.0 ‚Äì 7.5. The densest populations of C. esculentus are often found in low-lying wetlands. They do not tolerate salinity. Agronomy =Regions= C. esculentus is cultivated in the Nigeria, United States, Guatemala, Mexico, Chile, Brasil, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, India, Yemen, Morocco, Ivory Coast, Sudan, South Sudan, Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Ghana, Niger,Burkina Faso, Togo, Benin, Cameroon, and Mali, where they are used primarily as animal feed or as a side dish, but in Hispanic countries they are used mainly to make horchata, a sweet, milk-like beverage. =Cultivation= Planting is normally done on flat soils where ridges to favour the coming irrigations have previously been done. The separation between ridges is approximately and seeds are planted manually. Distances between seeds may vary from and seeding depth is around . A typical seeding rate for chufa is about 120 kg of tubers/ha (107 lbs/acre).N. Pascual- Seva, et al., Furrow-irrigated chufa crops in Valencia (Spain) Spanish Journal of Agricultural Research 2013 11(1), 258-267. http://revistas.inia.es/index.php/sjar/article/view/3385/1803 They are planted between April and May and must be irrigated every week until they are harvested in November and December. Tubers develop about 6 ‚Äì 8 weeks after seedling emergence and grow quickly during July and August. The maturing is around 90 ‚Äì 110 days. The average yield can approach between 10 and 19 t/ha.Pascual-Seva, N., San Bautista, A., L√≥pez Galarza, S., Maroto, J.V. and Pascual, B. 2012.

Development of a Prototype mechanical Harvester for Chufa (Cyperus esculentus L. var sativus Boek). Canadian Agricultural Engineering 14. =Harvest and drying process= Harvest usually occurs in November or December and the leaves are scorched during the harvest. With a combine harvester, the tiger nut is pulled out of the ground. Immediately after harvesting, the tiger nuts are washed with water in order to remove sand and small stones. The drying occurs usually in the sun and can take up to three months.Tigernuts Traders, S.L., Tigernuts Oil, 2012, http://www.tigernut.com The temperatures and humidity levels have to be monitored very carefully during this period. The tiger nuts have to be turned every day to ensure uniform drying. The drying process ensures a longer shelf life. This prevents rot or other bacterial infections, securing quality and high nutrition levels. Disadvantages in the drying process are shrinkage, skin wrinkles and hard nut texture. =Storage= Tiger nut loses a considerable amount of water during drying and storage. The starch content of the tiger nut tubers decreases and the reducing sugar (invert sugar) content increases during storage. Tiger nut can be stored dry and rehydrated by soaking without losing the crisp texture. Soaking is often done overnight. Dried tiger nuts have a hard texture and soaking is indispensable to render them edible with ease and to ensure acceptable sensory quality. According to the Consejo Regulador de Chufa de Valencia (Regulating Council for Valencia's Tiger Nuts), the nutritional composition/100 ml of the Spanish beverage horchata de chufas is as follows: energy content around 66 kcal, proteins around 0.5 g, carbohydrates over 10 g with starch at least 1.9 g, fats at least 2 g. Uses Dried tiger nut has a smooth, tender, sweet, and nutty taste. It can be consumed raw, roasted, dried, baked or as tiger nut milk or oil. =Drink= In Spain, the drink now known as horchata de chufa (also sometimes called horchata de chufas or, in West African countries such as Nigeria and Mali, kunnu aya) is the original form of horchata. It is made from soaked, ground and sweetened tiger nuts. According to researchers at the University of Ilorin, kunnu made from tiger nuts is an inexpensive source of protein. It remains popular in Spain, where a regulating council exists to ensure the quality and traceability of the product in relation to the designation of origin. There it is served ice-cold as a natural refreshment in the summer, often served with fartons. Horchata de chufa is also used instead of dairy milk by the lactose-intolerant. The majority of the Spanish tiger nut crop is utilised in the production of horchata de chufa. Alboraya is the most important production centre. =Food= Dried tubers sold at the market of Banfora, Burkina Faso. The tubers are edible, with a slightly sweet, nutty flavour, compared to the more bitter-tasting tuber of the related Cyperus rotundus (purple nutsedge). They are quite hard and are generally soaked in water before they can be eaten, making them much softer and giving them a better texture. They are a popular snack in West Africa. They have various uses, such as horchata, a nonalcoholic beverage of milky appearance derived from the tubers of the tiger nut plant mixed with sugar and water, and commonly consumed in Spain. In Northern Nigeria, it is called aya and it is usually eaten fresh. It is sometimes dried and later rehydrated and eaten. Also a snack is made by toasting the nuts and sugar coating it is popular among the Hausa children of Northern Nigeria. Also, a drink known as kunun aya is made by processing the nuts with dates and later sieved and served chilled. Flour of roasted tiger nut is sometimes added to biscuits and other bakery products as well as in making oil, soap, and starch extracts. It is also used for the production of nougat, jam, beer, and as a flavoring agent in ice cream and in the preparation of kunnu (a local beverage in Nigeria). Kunnu is a nonalcoholic beverage prepared mainly from cereals (such as millet or sorghum) by heating and mixing with spices (dandelion, alligator pepper, ginger, licorice) and sugar. To make up for the poor nutritional value of kunnu prepared from cereals, tiger nut was found to be a good substitute for cereal grains. Tiger nut oil can be used naturally with salads or for deep frying. It is considered to be a high quality oil. Tiger nut ‚Äúmilk‚Äù has been tried as an alternative source of milk in fermented products, such as yogurt production, and other fermented products common in some African countries and can thus be useful replacing milk in the diet of people intolerant to lactose to a certain extent. =Nutrition= Despite its name, tiger nutsedge is a tuber. However, its chemical composition shares characteristics with tubers and with nuts. This tuber is rich in energy content (starch, fat, sugar, and protein), and dietary minerals (mainly phosphorus and potassium). The oil of the tuber was found to contain 18% saturated (palmitic acid and stearic acid) and 82% unsaturated (oleic acid and linoleic acid) fatty acids. =Oil= Since the tubers of C. esculentus contain 20-36% oil, it has been suggested as potential oil crop for the production of biodiesel. One study found that chufa produced 1.5 metric tonnes of oil per hectare (174 gallons/acre) based on a tuber yield of 5.67 t/ha and an oil content of 26.4%. A similar 6-year study found tuber yields ranging from 4.02 to 6.75 t/ha, with an average oil content of 26.5% and an average oil yield of 1.47 t/ha.Bilali et al., \\"Exploring Serbian consumers‚Äô attitude toward ethical values of organic, fair-trade and typical/traditional products\\" The Fifth International Scientific Conference, Rural Development 2011, Proceedings, Volume 5, Book 1, p. 337. =Fishing bait= The boiled nuts are used in the UK as a bait for carp. The nuts have to be prepared in a prescribed manner to prevent harm to the fish. The nuts are soaked in water for 24 hours, and then boiled for 20 minutes or longer until fully expanded. Some anglers then leave the boiled nuts to ferment for 24‚Äì48 hours, which can enhance their effectiveness. If the nuts are not properly prepared, they can be toxic to carp. This was originally thought to have been the cause of death of Benson, a large, well-known female carp weighing found floating dead in a fishing lake, with a bag of unprepared tiger nuts lying nearby, empty, on the bank. An examination of the fish by a taxidermist concluded tiger nut poisoning was not the cause of death, but rather the fish had died naturally. Compatibility with other crops The seed head of a Cyperus esculentus plant C. esculentus is extremely difficult to remove completely once established. This is due to the plant having a stratified and layered root system, with tubers and roots being interconnected to a depth of 36 cm or more. The tubers are connected by fragile roots that are prone to snapping when pulled, making the root system difficult to remove intact. Intermediate rhizomes can potentially reach a length of 60 cm. The plant can quickly regenerate if a single tuber is left in place. By competing for light, water and nutrients it can reduce the vigour of neighbouring plants. It can develop into a dense colony. Patch boundaries can increase by more than one meter per year. Tubers and seed disperse with agricultural activities, soil movement or by water and wind. They are often known as a contaminant in crop seeds. When plants are small they are hard to distinguish from other weeds such as Dactylis glomerata and Elytrigia repens. Thus it is hard to discover in an early stage and therefore hard to counteract. Once it is detected, mechanical removal, hand removal, grazing, damping, and herbicides can be used to inhibit C. esculentus. =Similar native or non- native species that can confuse identification= Sedges (Cyperus) have grass-like leaves and resemble each other in the appearance. They can mainly be distinguished from grasses by their triangular stems. * Purple nutsedge (C. rotundus) is another weedy sedge that is similar to the yellow nutsedge (C. esculentus). These two sedges are difficult to distinguish from each other and can be found growing on the same site. Some differences are the purple spikelets and the tubers formed by C. rotundus are often multiple instead of just one at the tip. In addition the tubers have a bitter taste instead of the mild almond-like flavour of C. esculentus.

It was given its common name by Oldfield Thomas in honor of Charles William Campbell, who collected the first specimen in Mongolia on July 1, 1902. It is distinguished from the closely related Djungarian hamster as it has smaller ears and no dark fur on its crown. Campbell's dwarf hamster typically has a narrow dorsal stripe compared to the Djungarian hamster and grey fur on the stomach. This hamster may be raised in captivity and kept as a small pet. In the wild, the breeding season for Campbell's dwarf hamster varies by location. For example, the breeding season begins towards the middle of April in Tuva and towards the end of April in Mongolia. However, in captivity, there is no fixed breeding season and they can breed frequently throughout the year. Females are usually sexually mature at two months of age and the gestation period is typically 20 days. Campbell's dwarf hamster is crepuscular, along with all species of Phodopus and is active throughout the year. Campbell's dwarf hamsters are omnivores, and so feed on both plant and insect material. Campbell's dwarf hamster inhabits burrows with four to six horizontal and vertical tunnels in the steppes and semi deserts of central Asia, the Altai mountains, autonomous areas of Tuva and the Hebei province in northeastern China. This hamster is listed as of Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is native to China, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Russian Federation. Taxonomy and naming The binomial name of Campbell's dwarf hamster is Phodopus campbelli. This species is the type species of Cricetiscus (named by Thomas in 1917, and now considered a synonym of Phodopus), and is named after C. W. Campbell, who first collected it on July 1, 1902, in Inner Mongolia. Type locality was the village Shaborte in Mongolia. This locality has puzzled later writers and was believed to be a general Mongolian word for a dry lake, and therefore with no specific coordinates. However, in the reprint of C. W. Campbell's book \\"Travels in Mongolia\\" it is clear that Shaborte is an actual village on the route followed through Mongolia. Thomas described the type specimen in 1905 as Cricetulus campbelli. Synonyms for this species are Phodopus crepidatus and Phodopus tuvinicus. Common names have been applied to Campbell's dwarf hamster, including the striped hairy-footed hamster, the Djungarian hamster, the Siberian hamster, and Campbell's hamster. Campbell's dwarf hamster is commonly confused with the Djungarian hamster (Phodopus sungorus) due to some of the common names, such as the \\"Siberian hamster\\" also being used to describe the Djungarian hamster. =Subspecies= American biologist Ned Hollister described a subspecies in 1912: * P. c. crepidatus : Found in the Altai Mountains of Siberia Physical description The size of Campbell's dwarf hamster varies depending on its location. For example, eight wild specimens examined from Mongolia showed an average head and body length of , an average hind foot length of long, with a tail length of . In captivity, they are proportionally larger, as commercial pet food and fruits provide more nutrition than food found commonly in the wild. The lips and cheeks have white fur and the rest of the fur around the face can be either grey or brown. A dark and narrow dorsal stripe runs along the center of the back from the nape of the neck to about above the tail. The surface of the hands and feet are white to ensure the animal stays warm in colder climates in countries such as Mongolia.Dwarf hamsters running on disc In both the wild and captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters scent-mark around their territories using Harderian glands, skin glands located behind the ears. They use urine and feces for communication. Campbell's dwarf hamster is distinguished from the similar- looking Djungarian hamster by its smaller ears and no dark patch on the crown of its head, in certain colorations. The dorsal stripe of Campbell's dwarf hamster is narrower, shorter, and darker than that of the Djungarian hamster, and the fur on the stomach of Campbell's dwarf hamster is grey, but it is white on the Djungarian hamster. Campbell's dwarf hamster does not turn white in the winter and has a grey tint to its fur. It has a smaller interorbital breadth, but has a larger auditory bulla. Campbell's dwarf hamster is much less tolerant to lower temperatures than the Djungarian hamster. A laboratory experiment showed Campbell's dwarf hamster can resist temperatures as low as , where the Djungarian hamster can withstand temperatures as low as . Campbell's dwarf hamster reacts to lower temperatures by constantly exercising and tries to find a sheltered location, unlike the Djungarian hamster, which curls up and relies on its autonomic thermoregulation. Campbell's dwarf hamster has cheek pouches, which are an extension of the mouth, extending from the mouth all the way to the rear legs. Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The inside of the pouch contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When the pouch is full, it extends and becomes part of the structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, the cheek pouches are fully grown and can carry objects up to the size of a sunflower seed. When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement. Campbell's dwarf hamster is prone to genetic abnormalities in the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. They can develop tumours of the mammary glands, lungs, uterus, and ovaries. Tumours can also develop if the animal is exposed to chemical carcinogens. Due to having slow locomotion and an insignificant response to bright lights and humans, as well as having a low population density, field studies allow scientists to study entire populations in the wild. =Lifespan= Hamsters kept in captivity live for around 2.0‚Äì2.5 years. Young hamsters provided widely varied diets early in life are less likely to suffer digestive problems as they mature, but this is not always possible in the wild due to lack of food; this causes the life expectancy of captive hamsters to be greater than that of wild hamsters. Diet As omnivores, Campbell's dwarf hamsters eat a variety of different foods. A balanced diet for a hamster consists of 16-24% protein, 60-65% carbohydrates, and 5‚Äì7% fat, with constant access to fresh water. In their natural habitats, dwarf hamsters feed almost exclusively on plant materials. In captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters can get the required nutrition from commercially available food designed specifically for hamsters, which typically contain a mix of dry grains, nuts, and seeds that may be fortified with vitamins and minerals. An excess of any one particular seed or nut can lead to digestive problems, obesity, and forms nutritional deficiency. In addition to a commercially prepared seed mix, a balanced diet for a Campbell's dwarf hamster in captivity includes a regulated variety of fresh vegetables and fruits. Dark greens such as kale are rich in vitamins and minerals. Wild vegetables such as yarrow, chickweed, and dandelion and raspberry leaves, are also good sources of protein that helps prevent obesity. A hamster in captivity can occasionally eat mealworms or earthworms, which have high protein contents. Boiled egg whites and small pieces of clean, cooked chicken are also sources of extra protein. They can also eat wheat grain, sunflower seeds, and locusts. The teeth of Campbell's dwarf hamster never stop growing. Like all rodents, they must, therefore, gnaw regularly to keep their incisors from growing into the skin of the mouth and causing pain and irritation. Smooth, young wood from nontoxic trees, such as apple and willow, is readily used by most species in the genus. Most pet stores sell nontoxic wooden chews designed for rodents in captivity. Certain food items commonly consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters and should be avoided completely in captivity. Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, which can lead to death. In the wild, the diets of Campbell's dwarf hamsters vary across the population range. A total of 51 different species of plants were identified to be consumed by the Transbaikalia population, the most common being Stipa capillata and species of Allium. However, in Tuva, only 10 species of plant were identified to be consumed by the population, the most common being Potentilla. Campbell's dwarf hamster is a natural predator of burrowing worms and grubs. Breeding In Tuva, the breeding season of Campbell's dwarf hamster begins in April, and in Mongolia, it begins in at the end of April or the beginning of May. However, in all distribution ranges, it ends in late September or early October. In captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters breed throughout the year, with no fixed breeding season, but a large number are born in the summer months. In the wild, three to four litters are produced each year, with an average of eight offspring per litter. In captivity, females can have between one and 18 litters per year, with one to nine offspring per litter. In captivity, the gestation period for Campbell's dwarf hamster is between 18 and 20 days, and the shortest gestation period recorded for a captive female was 13 days. The male hamster is likely to assist the female during birth. The male may pull the offspring from the birth canal, clean them, or collect food for the mother and offspring. When the offspring are born, they are hairless and have a body mass of approximately . Incisors and claws are already formed, but the digits, eyes, and pinnae are closed and cannot be used. The rate at which the young develop differs depending on the distribution range. However, the differences are usually no longer than a day. In Tuva, the pinnae open on the first day of birth and are completely open after three days of development. However, in Mongolia, the same process occurs between two and four days of development. Fur first grows on the crown, back, and abdomen. The young usually have a full coat of fur after seven days of development. Offspring born in captivity have a shorter development time than those born in the wild. Specifically, the growth and development of the head and body, tail, hind feet, and pinnae can be up to a day sooner than those found in the wild. After 28 days of development in captivity, the young are already around half the mass of their parents. In captivity, females become sexually mature at two months of age. The ovarian follicle forms about 16 days prior to the birth of the offspring. After mating, female hamsters typically have larger uteri, ovaries, and adrenal glands compared to females which live alone, with other females or those that have not mated. The females and males may fight each other when getting to know their partner. Also, these females have a shorter gestation period, around four to five days. =Hybrids= In captivity, only Campbell's dwarf hamsters and Djungarian hamsters are able to interbreed and produce live offspring or hybrids. Although hybrids make suitable pets, the breeding of hybrids and cloning can cause health problems, due to inherited diseases. Because genetic information can be very similar, genetic health problems or vulnerabilities can easily be inherited by the offspring. The widespread breeding and distribution of hybrids could threaten the existence of both pure species and subspecies of the ecosystem. This could ultimately lead to the extinction of the subspecies. Each litter becomes smaller as more generations are produced and the young commonly begin to inherit many congenital problems. The two species of Phodopus hamsters (P. sungorus and P. campbelli) have the same number of chromosomes, and the chromosomes are similar in terms of size and morphology. However, several chromosomes show structural differences in the location and size of C-heterochromatin blocks. In nature, the two species do not meet, but will mate and produce offspring in captivity. However, both reciprocal crosses produce sterile hybrid males and females with decreased fertility. There is a clear effect in which types the parents are. The cross P. sungorus male x P. campbelli female will have embryos that grow normally, like both parent species. But the cross between P. campbelli male x P. sungorus female result in overgrowth, leading to embryonic death. Habitat Campbell's dwarf hamsters inhabit burrows in the steppes and semideserts of central Asia, the Altai mountains, autonomous areas of Tuva, and the Hebei province in northeastern China. A burrow can contain four to six horizontal and vertical tunnels. The tunnels leading to the nesting area can be as deep as below the ground, but are usually deep. The burrows are lined with either dry grass or sheep's wool. They may sometimes share burrows with Daurian pikas, but only in the steppes and semideserts of northern Manchuria. In parts of Mongolia, the hamsters may also share burrows with species of Meriones to save them from digging their own. In Tuva, Campbell's dwarf hamsters have been found living with other hamsters, such as the Chinese striped hamster, the Roborovski hamster, and the long-tailed dwarf hamster. The diets of the three types of hamsters are different to avoid fighting over the same type of food, which is why they live together. Campbell's dwarf hamsters may also live near areas of human civilization. In Mongolia, they may be found in yurts to keep warm during the winter, as they do not have thermoregulation like the Djungarian hamster. They have five main predators: the Eurasian eagle owl, the steppe eagle, the corsac fox, the common kestrel, and the saker falcon. All distribution areas have more females than males, because males are at higher risk from predators, as they cannot move as quickly. Status and conservation This hamster is listed as of Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The population and distribution size is large, and no major or widespread threats to the species are known. However, due to the increasing number of livestock in the areas of distribution, such as the steppes of central Asia, some burrows are at a small risk of being destroyed. In arid areas of distribution, the reduction in the number of water sources is also a minor concern. These hamsters are conserved in protected areas.

A remake of My Favorite Wife (1940), a screwball comedy starring Irene Dunne and Cary Grant, it was Monroe's last work, but from the beginning its production was disrupted by her personal troubles, and after her death on August 4, 1962, the film was abandoned. Most of its completed footage remained unseen for many years. 20th Century Fox overhauled the entire production idea the following year with mostly new cast and crew and produced their My Favorite Wife remake, now titled Move Over, Darling (1963) and starring Doris Day, James Garner, and Polly Bergen. Plot Ellen Arden (Monroe), a photographer and mother of two small children, has been declared legally dead, having been lost at sea in the Pacific. Her husband Nick (Dean Martin) has remarried; he and his new wife, Bianca (Cyd Charisse), are on their honeymoon when Ellen, rescued from an island where she has been stranded for five years, returns home. The family dog remembers her, but the children do not. However, they take a liking to her, and invite her to stay. Ellen assumes a foreign accent and pretends to be a woman named Ingrid Tic. Nick, flustered by the revelation that he's now married to two women, makes great effort to keep the truth from his new wife all the while trying to quash her amorous advances. Upon learning that Ellen was marooned on the island with a man, Stephen Burkett (Tom Tryon) ‚Äî whom she knew as \\"Adam\\" to her \\"Eve\\" ‚Äî he becomes jealous and suspicious of her fidelity. To calm his fears, Ellen enlists a meek shoe salesman (Wally Cox) to impersonate her island companion.De La Hoz, Cindy: \\"Marilyn Monroe ‚Äî Platinum Fox\\", Page 232, Running Fox. .

This was to be the sixth film version based on the Tennyson poem. Several weeks before principal photography began, the cast and crew gathered for wardrobe tests on a set that was a fully lit recreation of George Cukor's Beverly Hills home. Production designer Gene Allen had sent a crew of men to Cukor's home at 9166 Cordell Drive to photograph the house and pool areas of the estate. According to Allen, Cukor was photographed in the set's courtyard with the intent of using the photo as his 1962 Christmas card. Marilyn Monroe had been absent from the screen for over a year. She had recently undergone gallbladder surgery, and had lost more than , reaching the lowest weight of her adult life. In six hours of testing, Monroe wore some of her own clothes and some of those commissioned by Fox for the film. Her costumes included a long blonde wig meant for the beginning of the film, a two-piece black wool suit (also worn in Let's Make Love), a black and white spaghetti strap silk dress, and a lime green two-piece bathing suit with a bottom designed to cover her navel. Before shooting had begun, Monroe had let producer Henry Weinstein know that she had been asked by the White House to perform for President John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden in honor of his birthday on May 29, 1962. The producer granted her permission to attend the gala, believing there would be no problems on the set. Production On the first day of production, April 23, 1962, Monroe telephoned Weinstein to tell him that she had a severe sinus infection and would not be on the set that morning. Apparently she had caught the infection after a trip to New York City during which she had visited her acting coach, Lee Strasberg of The Actors Studio, to go over her role. The studio sent staff Dr. Lee Siegel to examine the star at her home. His diagnosis would have postponed the movie for a month, but George Cukor refused to wait. Instead he reorganized the shooting schedule to film scenes around his leading lady. At 7:30 am, Cyd Charisse was telephoned and summoned to the Fox lot. Later that morning the first scene filmed involved Martin's character and Charisse, in an encounter with children building a tree house. Over the next month filming continued mostly without Monroe, who showed up only occasionally due to fever, headaches, chronic sinusitis and bronchitis. The production fell 10 days behind schedule. As Kennedy's birthday approached, no one on the production thought Monroe would keep her commitment to the White House although she had gotten clearance on April 9 to appear at the event. (Also see article \\"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\\") Studio documents released after Monroe's death confirm her appearance at the political fundraising event that had been approved by Fox executives. By this time, the production was over budget, and the script was still not completely finalized, despite writer Walter Bernstein's efforts. The script was rewritten nightly, with Monroe growing increasingly frustrated at having to memorize new scenes every day. When not before the camera, she spent much of her time on the set in her dressing room with Paula Strasberg, Lee's wife. =Pool scene= Upon her return from New York, Monroe decided to give the film a publicity boost by doing something no major Hollywood actress had done before; in the scene in which Ellen is swimming in the pool at night, she calls playfully up to Nick's bedroom window and invites him to join her. Nick tells her to get out of the pool, then realizes she is nude. A body stocking was made for her, but Monroe took it off and swam around in only a flesh- colored bikini bottom.Pulp International: Confidential The set was closed to all but necessary crew, but Monroe had asked photographers, including William Woodfield, to come in. After filming was completed, Monroe was photographed in the bikini bottom, and without it.\\"They Fired Marilyn: Her Dip Lives On\\", Life, June 22, 1962.Marilyn Monroe Pictures: Something's Got to Give. Had Something's Got to Give been completed and released as planned, Monroe would have been the first mainstream star shown topless in a Hollywood motion picture release of the sound era. Instead, that distinction goes to actress Jayne Mansfield in Promises! Promises! (1963). =Monroe's last day on the set= On Friday, June 1, 1962, Monroe's 36th birthday, she, Martin and Wally Cox shot a scene in the courtyard set. Monroe's stand-in, Evelyn Moriarty, bought a seven-dollar sheet cake at the Los Angeles Farmers Market. A studio illustrator drew a cartoon of a nude Monroe holding a towel, which read \\"Happy Birthday (Suit)\\". It was to be used as a birthday card, and signed by the cast and crew. The cast attempted to celebrate when Monroe arrived, but Cukor insisted that they wait until 6:00 p.m. (the end of the working day) because he wanted to get a \\"full day's work out of her.\\" It would be Monroe's last day on the set. She left the party with Cox, and had borrowed the fur-trimmed grey suit she had worn while filming that day because she was to attend a muscular dystrophy fundraiser at Dodger Stadium that evening with her former husband Joe DiMaggio and co-star Dean Martin's young son, Dean Paul Martin. =Monroe is fired= On Monday, June 4, 1962, Monroe phoned Henry Weinstein to inform him that she would not be on set that day once again. She had a flare-up of the sinusitis, and her temperature had reached 100 ¬∞F (37.8 ¬∞C). At a studio meeting, Cukor strongly endorsed her dismissal, and she was fired from the project on June 8, 1962. Life featured Marilyn, wrapped in a blue terrycloth robe, on its June 22, 1962 cover with the headline, \\"The skinny dip you'll never see.\\" The decision to fire Monroe was influenced by the progress of Fox's epic film Cleopatra, also in production that summer and far over its budget. Executives had planned a Christmas holiday release for Something's Got to Give, as a source of revenue to offset Cleopatra's increasing cost. Monroe quickly gave interviews and photo essays for Life, Cosmopolitan, and Vogue magazines. The Life interview with Richard Meryman, published on August 3, 1962  just two days before her death  included her reflections on the positive and negative aspects of fame. \\"Fame is fickle,\\" she said. \\"I now live in my work and in a few relationships with the few people I can really count on. Fame will go by, and so long, I've had you, fame. If it goes by, I've always known it was fickle. So, at least it's something I experienced, but that's not where I live.\\" Subsequent events Lee Remick and director George Cukor After Monroe's dismissal, her role was offered to actresses Kim Novak and Shirley MacLaine, but both declined. It was soon reported that she was to be replaced with Lee Remick, who was fitted into Monroe's costumes and photographed with Cukor. Dean Martin had final approval of his leading lady, and refused to continue without Monroe. Aside from being friends with Martin, Monroe had personally selected the cast (including Martin and Cox) over Fox's desire she do the film with James Garner and Don Knotts, the two stars who ended up in the Doris Day version. Fox relented and re-hired her, even agreeing to pay her more than her previous salary of $100,000, with the stipulation that she make this and one more film at $500,000 per film, plus a bonus if completed on time. The second film was slated to be What a Way to Go!, which was eventually filmed with Shirley MacLaine. Monroe accepted the offer on the condition Cukor be replaced with Jean Negulesco, who had directed her in How to Marry a Millionaire. Filming was set to resume in October, but no more work was done after Monroe's death on August 5. In April 1963, Fox released the 83-minute documentary Marilyn, which included brief clips from the screen tests and unfinished film showing Monroe. This was the only footage from the film seen by the public until the hour-long 1990 documentary Marilyn: Something's Got to Give, which used extensive excerpts from the footage. Fox later produced another version of the script by Arnold Schulman, who walked off the film when he saw what Fox was planning for Monroe. The Nunnally Johnson and Walter Bernstein scripts were rewritten by Hal Kanter and Jack Sher, more closely resembling the original 1940 film. Fox asked Kanter to fashion a film around all the existing film footage, and then release it without ever having to bring Monroe back, with a technique previously used for Jean Harlow in Saratoga that made use of a double for certain scenes. This request came despite Fox's insistence that only mere minutes existed of Monroe on film, despite there being crates full of scenes shot repeatedly with no perceptible difference. All this maneuvering was dropped after Monroe and Fox came to new terms on her adjusted contract. The newer version utilized some of the sets from the abandoned version, as well as costumes (with variations) and hairstyles designed for Monroe. Retitled Move Over, Darling and starring Doris Day, James Garner and Polly Bergen, the film was released by 20th Century Fox in December 1963. Reconstruction Nine hours of unedited footage and separate sound tracks from the unfinished film remained in the vaults at 20th Century Fox until 1989, when the material was discovered by producers of Fox Entertainment News (FEN) and assembled into the one-hour documentary Marilyn: Something's Got to Give. Commissioned by Fox chairman Barry Diller, the film first aired on Fox stations in 1990, written, produced and presented by Henry Schipper. The film sequences edited by FEN's post-production team were later repurposed by Prometheus Entertainment for the documentary Marilyn Monroe: The Final Days, which aired on AMC on June 1, 2001, the 75th anniversary of Monroe's birth.

He wrote poetry, commented on literary works, and encouraged the study of classical languages and literature but his most important contributions were in the fields of grammar and lexicography. Nebrija was the author of the Spanish Grammar (Gram√°tica de la lengua castellana, 1492) and the first dictionary of the Spanish language (1495). His grammar is the first published grammar study of any modern European language. His chief works were published and republished many times during and after his life and his scholarship had a great influence for more than a century, both in Spain and in the expanding Spanish Empire.Perona 2004Hamann 2015 Name Nebrija was baptized Antonio Mart√≠nez de Cala. In typical Renaissance humanist fashion, he Latinized his name as Aelius Antonius Nebrissensis (or Elio Antonio de Nebrija in Spanish) by taking Aelius from the Roman inscriptions of his native Lebrija, known in Roman times as Nebrissa Veneria. He was also known as Antonio de Lebrija, Antonius Nebrissensis, and Antonio de Lebrixa. Biography Juan de Zuniga, 1486 Statue outside the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa√±a, Madrid Nebrija was born into a hidalgo family in Nebrixa, a town now called Lebrija in the province of Seville. His parents were Juan Mart√≠nez de Cala and Catalina de Xarana. He was the second of five children. There is some uncertainty about his date of birth. Nebrija wrote that he was born the year before the Battle of Olmedo in 1445, putting his birthday in 1444 but elsewhere he makes other references that would contradict this date. Traditionally, 1444 has been accepted as his year of birth. At age fourteen Nebrija enrolled at the University of Salamanca, where he studied mathematics, philosophy, law and theology. These latter topics earned him a scholarship from the bishopric of Seville to study theology at the Royal College of Spain in Bologna. Little is known about his studies in Italy except that he was inspired by the works of the Italian humanists, especially Lorenzo Valla. After ten years in Italy Nebrija returned to Spain armed with the new concepts of Renaissance humanism. Once back in Spain, Nebrija served Alonso de Fonseca y Ulloa, archbishop of Seville, for three years. When Fonseca died in 1473, Nebrija returned to the University of Salamanca as a lecturer. In 1476 he was appointed First Chair of Grammar and in 1481 he published his first work, the Introductiones latinae (Introduction to Latin), a textbook on Latin grammar and literature. The first printing of 1,000 copies quickly sold out and was reprinted dozens of times in his lifetime.Grendler 2000 He married Isabel Montesino de Sol√≠s in 1487 and eventually fathered seven children. When Juan de Z√∫√±iga, the master of the Order of Alc√°ntara, offered him patronage, Nebrija quit the university in Salamanca and moved to Badajoz, where he lived for the next twelve years. After the success of his Latin textbook, Nebrija's literary scholarship turned to focus on Castilian rather than classical languages. In 1492 he published Gram√°tica de la lengua castellana (Grammar of the Castilian Language), which he dedicated to Queen Isabella I of Castile. His book was one of the first to codify a European vernacular language, and it ultimately had considerable political and scholarly influence. Nebrija recognized that language played a crucial role in governance of the state. In his dedication he wrote to Isabella that language was \\"the instrument of empire\\" and suggested that his grammar would prove useful as the Catholic Monarchs conquered peoples who spoke languages other than Castilian. In 1492 Nebrija also published the Diccionario latino-espa√±ol (Latin-Spanish Dictionary). It was not the first Latin-Spanish dictionary (Alfonso de Palencia published one in 1490) but it would become hugely influential, in part because a few years later he reversed the order and published his Vocabulario espa√±ol-latino (Spanish-Latin Vocabulary) in 1495. For the next century, the Spanish-Latin vocabulary continued to evolve with new words and translations. It also served as the basis for other authors developing non- Latin translating dictionaries including Spanish-Arabic (1505), Spanish- Nahuatl (1547) and Spanish-Tagalog (1613). After publishing his dictionaries Nebrija turned his attention to biblical scholarship. He wanted to improve the text and interpretation of the Bible by using the same critical analysis that Italian humanists had applied to classical literature. Around 1504 he fell under the suspicion of Diego de Deza, the Grand Inquisitor of Spain, who confiscated and destroyed his work. In 1507 Cardinal Jim√©nez de Cisneros succeeded Deza as inquisitor general. Cisneros allowed Nebrija to resume his biblical studies and he eventually published a series of works that used the techniques of humanist scholarship to address problems of biblical translation and interpretation. Nebrija served briefly on the editorial committee assembled by Jim√©nez to prepare the Complutensian Polyglot Bible. He clashed with the more conservative editors, who resisted his humanist approach to translating the Bible. Jim√©nez supported the conservative viewpoint and Nebrija's input was largely ignored when the finished work was published in 1517. Nebrija wrote or translated a large number of other works on a variety of subjects, including theology, law, archaeology, pedagogy, and commentaries on Sedulius and Persius. Nebrija died on 5 July 1522 in Acala de Henares, Spain. His possible grandson Antonio de Lebrija was conquistador in Colombia and treasurer of the Spanish conquest of the Muisca expedition.Rodr√≠guez Freyle, 1638, p.69 WorksIntroductiones latinae, 1481 *Gram√°tica de la lengua castellana, 1492 *Diccionario latino-espa√±ol, 1492 *Vocabulario espa√±ol-latino, ca. 1495 *Iuris civilis lexicon 1506 *Artis rhetoricae, 1515 *Reglas de ortograf√≠a espa√±ola, 1517 *Posthumously published Reglas de ortograf√≠a en la lengua castellana, 1523 Notes References English   Spanish  Further readingNicol√°s Antonio, Bibliotheca Hispana Nova, i. 132 (1888) *Prescott, History of Ferdinand and Isabella, i. 410 (note) *Thomas McCrie, The Reformation in Spain in the Sixteenth Century (1829) * Ivan Illich's essay Vernacular Values on the significance of Nebrija's Grammar External links Etext of Nebrija's Gram√°tica de la lengua castellana 1441 births 1522 deaths 16th- century linguists 16th-century Spanish people Complutense University of Madrid alumni Grammarians from Spain Linguists from Spain Linguists of Spanish People from Lebrija Spanish academics Spanish Latinists Spanish lexicographers Spanish Renaissance people Spanish translators Translators of the Bible into Spanish University of Salamanca alumni University of Salamanca faculty ","title":"Antonio de Nebrija"},{"id":"1835634","text":"Villarsia is a genus of aquatic flowering plants in the family Menyanthaceae.

Tengbom was born in Vireda in J√∂nk√∂ping County, studied at the Chalmers School of Technology in Gothenburg 1894-1898, at the architecture school of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm 1898-1901 (being awarded the so-called Royal Medal) and abroad 1905-1906. He worked 1906-1912 with Ernst Torulf in Stockholm and Gothenburg 1906-1912, and on his own from 1912 in Stockholm. He was appointed architect in the Office of the Chief Intendant in 1906 and professor of architecture in the Royal Swedish College of Art in 1916. He became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1917. In 1921 he was appointed Director General of the State Office of Construction (Byggnadsstyrelsen). The Stockholm Concert Hall in 2002 Stockholm School of Economics (1925‚Äì1926) at Sveav√§gen in central Stockholm, not far from the Concert Hall. The architect firm Tengbom & Torulf won second prize in the 1905 competition for the Stockholm City Hall building (after Ragnar √ñstberg), and in 1906 again second prize for the Engelbrektskyrkan (Engelbrekt Church) in Stockholm (built according to the design of Lars Israel Wahlman). They were more successful in the competition for the City Court building (r√•dhus) in Bor√•s in 1909, where they won first prize and were allowed to execute their design. Another public building designed by Tengbom in collaboration with Torulf was the new church in Arvika, completed in 1911. The two also received the commission to build a hunting lodge for Eric von Rosen in what is today Jaktstuguskogen Nature Reserve. The Trelleborg Water Tower was built after drawings by Tengbom and completed in 1912. After Tengbom left the collaboration with Torulf, he made the design for the main office of the Stockholms Enskilda Bank at the Kungstr√§dg√•rden Park in Stockholm (1912‚Äì1915). Another Stockholm office for the bank, at G√∂tgatan on S√∂dermalm, was built according to Tengbom's design in 1916. Another bank office was the one designed for the Bor√•s Enskilda Bank (1916). Other Tengbom buildings from the time period were that of the building for the daily newspaper Svenska Dagbladet at the street Karduansmakargatan in Stockholm, and the H√∂galidskyrkan (H√∂galid Church) in Stockholm (after winning first prize in a competition). In the 1920s he made the design for the building of the Stockholm School of Economics (1925) and the Stockholm Concert Hall (1923‚Äì1926) at H√∂torget Square. The home of the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and known as the place where the Nobel Prize ceremony takes place, the Hall, a light-blue building with a portico with tall, slender polygonal columns with corinthian capitals. The concert hall is probably Tengbom's best-known building and, together with Gunnar Asplund's Stockholm Public Library, the most widely recognized example of the neo-classical architecture of the Swedish 1920s, in English referred to as Swedish Grace. In the last years of the 1920s, he designed the main office of Ivar Kreuger's corporation Svenska T√§ndsticksbolaget at Tr√§dg√•rdsgatan in Stockholm. His later production includes the building for the Swedish Institute at Rome 1938-1940. He was awarded one of the inaugural Prince Eugen Medals in 1945 for architecture. His son Anders Tengbom (1911‚Äì2009) was also, in his own right, a very famous architect. One of his greatest creations was Bonnierhuset, one of the tallest buildings in Stockholm. His daughter, Ann-Mari Tengbom, married Otto Christian Archibald von Bismarck.

The population of the civil parish was 1,669 at the 2011 Census. The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book, when it was held by Burton Abbey as an outlier of Mickleover. A priory once stood near the church, where the monks were supplied with fresh food from the fishponds on Common Piece Lane. After the dissolution of the abbey the Fynderne family, as the principal land-owners, took ownership of the village and the remaining Chapel of Ease. The Fyndernes lived in a fortified manor house on Castle Hill, though none of the house remains. The Findern Flower, Narcissus Poeticus Flore Pleno Sir Geoffrey de Fynderne left the village to join the Crusades, and brought back the Findern Flower, which in the UK only grows in the village, and only in particular areas. The flower has become an emblem of the village and is represented in many guises, including the emblem of Findern Primary School on Heath Lane. All Saints' parish church was rebuilt and consecrated in 1863, on the site of a Saxon chapel of ease, destroyed by fire. Built of sandstone, it stands adjacent to the village green. The church contains a monument to Isabella de Fynderne dated 1444, and also possesses the oldest parish communion plate in the UK. Findern also has a small Methodist chapel, built in 1835, close to the site of the old priory. The village previously also had an early 18th century Unitarian chapel, built just over five miles from Derby. At that time the law decreed that no Dissenting meeting house should be built less than that distance from the town. It was demolished in 1939. Prior to the development of transport, the village was self-supporting and it was here, in 1740, that Jedediah Strutt came as an apprentice wheelwright. He had an obsessive interest in machinery, but when his uncle died and left him a small holding, he took it over and returned to Findern to marry Elizabeth Woollatt who lived at the old hall, where he had previously lodged. Later he went on to set up the mills and their communities at Belper and Milford, which now form an integral part of the Derwent Valley World Heritage Site. The village historically had a strong weaving industry, with the majority of the cottages around the Green housing the looms. In 1846 there were as many as 22 velvet and silk looms in the village, but weaving had been known to have taken place in Findern as early as the 17th century Ivy Cottage, one of the oldest surviving properties in the village. In 1694 an early school was started here by Rev. Benjamin Robinson, the local presbyterian minister (for which he was summoned to explain why to the bishop).Benjamin Robinson in Dictionary of National Biography now in the public domain Modern Secondary education is now provided for many at John Port School in the nearby village of Etwall. Although all industry has left the village the Green remains the still the centre of the village, with the post office, village store and a handful of other services. Before the Parish Council took action in the 1950s to restore it the Green was in poor shape, divided into four small grassed areas, divided by tarmac paths and frequently used by vehicles. There were no records as to owned the land until ownership was traced to the Crown, and the land purchased for ¬£50 by the Parish Council for the village. There is a Neolithic cursus 1 ¬Ω miles south of the village.Pevsner, Nikolaus. 1986. The Buildings of England:Derbyshire. pp 215-216. Harmondsworth, Middx. Penguin. Findern previously had two pubs, the 'Wheel Inn' located on Main Street just off Longlands Lane and a second, formerly the 'Greyhound' on the bankside of the Trent and Mersey Canal. In addition to this a house located on the far-side of the canal was historically the oldest pub in the village. The village is nowadays bounded on two sides by major A roads; the A38 and the A50. The former, to the north east, follows the course of the Roman road Icknield Street, while the latter passes to the south of the village centre and runs parallel to the canal. In contrast to the ancient route of the A38 the A50 road was laid only in 1997, with many villagers unhappy about the loss of fields and pleasant walks as a result. Since then the Findern Footpaths Group have made huge improvements to existing trails, created new footpaths, and been a key force for recording and preserving the local history of the village surroundings.http://www.findernfootpathsgroup.org The nearest railway stations are Willington, Pear Tree and Derby. There is one level crossing: an automatic one on the parish border with Willington - there has been at least one fatality there. On the approach to the crossing a spur and basin have been created on the Trent and Mersey Canal, creating the UK's largest inland marina with berthing for 585 craft.http://www.merciamarina.co.uk Mercia Marina, with berths for several hundred narrow boats, is expected to have a great impact on the village and nearby Willington.

They include more than 160 Golden Age and Silver Age comic properties currently owned by DC Comics, regardless of whether DC Comics was the original publisher. The series first published Superman Archives Vol. 1 in 1989. Most of the restoration work to make the pages suitable for quality printing has been done by Rick Keene, who has restored more than 2,500 pages. History Cover to The Action Heroes Archives Vol. 2 (2007), focusing on the Charlton Comics characters. Cover art by Steve Ditko. The DC Archive Editions (DCAE) series spans DC's Golden Age‚Äîwhich is actually the output of three inter-related companies in the late 1930s and the early '40s: Max Gaines' All-American Publications (Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman, Wonder Woman; All Star Comics starring the Justice Society of America, et al.); and Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson's National Allied Publications, which became Harry Donenfeld's Detective Comics (Batman, Superman, et al.)‚Äîas well as Silver and Bronze Age comic book series such as Legion of Super-Heroes, Challengers of the Unknown, Doom Patrol, Metal Men, Aquaman, Justice League of America, et al. The series' format was designed by Alex Jay with Richard Bruning providing the art direction. Its various volumes also include series/titles not originally published by DC, though bought up in the intervening years, such as: Golden Age characters Plastic Man and Blackhawk, originally published by Quality Comics; the \\"Shazam\\" Marvel Family of characters Captain Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr., and Mary Marvel, originally published by Fawcett; and the Charlton Silver Age line of superheroes (Blue Beetle, Captain Atom, The Question, et al.) in the DCAE Action Heroes volumes. The DC Archives preserve DC's history and provide readers with stories that normally would not be available. When the series first started, the cover price was U.S. $39.95; however, in the early 1990s the standard cover price became U.S. $49.99, although some books in the line containing more content have cost much more (with a higher page count and higher cover price). Since 2009, new volumes have been released with a cover price of U.S. $59.99. In the early to mid-2000s, newer printings of previously published DC Archives volumes were released at the special introductory cover price of U.S. $19.95. In 2001, excess stock of Batman Archives Vol. 1 (originally released back in 1990) first printing edition was sold for this reduced price, with a new price sticker placed on the book's shrink wrap. Sales proved successful, as the remaining inventory sold out. DC used this promotional price again with a second printing of Batman Archives Vol. 1 in 2003 (only pre-ordered copies of this second printing for the direct market were at this lower price, while the remaining stock for the bookstore market was at the regular U.S. 49.99 price), Superman Archives Vol. 1 (fifth printing) in 2004, and Batman: The Dark Knight Archives Vol. 1 (third printing) in 2005. It was widely believed that the DC Archive Editions would cease publication in 2008.DC Trade Book Collections Go Deluxe ‚Äì 17 December 2007 12:58:00 PM ‚Äì Publishers Weekly However, in an issue of the publication Comic Shop News (issue #1080, February 27, 2008), an update was provided: \\"In spite of earlier reports of their demise, DC Archives will continue in 2008 and 2009, although in reduced numbers, focusing on continuing already-established Archives' series. The numbers have since decreased from fourteen volumes released in 2007, to seven released in 2008, five in 2009, four in 2010, and three in 2011, before rebounding in 2012 with ten volumes. In 2013, the volume length was increased to 400 pages, but only three volumes were released. The most recent volume, Superman: The Man of Tomorrow Archives Vol. 3 was released in 2014. A Captain Comet Archive Vol. 1 and Batman: World's Finest Vol. 3 were both solicited by DC for release in 2013, but both were canceled prior to release and have yet to be rescheduled. Post-2014, with no new DC Archive Editions released, DC has instead published the hardcover DC Omnibus line, with various titles/characters from the Golden Age, the Silver Age, and the Bronze Age eras, and each Age era Omnibus volume is also published as two or three (depending on page count) trade paperbacks, replacing the DC Archive Editions line. Will Eisner's The Spirit Archives, T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents Archives, Mad Archives, and Elfquest Archives are not technically part of the formal DC Archive Editions series (DCAEs are typified by a cover format consisting of a black pinstriped background onto which a colored v-shaped area is overlaid from the top, reaching almost to the bottom for all books) as DC does not own those properties/characters, and is licensing them from the copyright holders. In the case of Mad, the property is owned by DC's parent company, but not DC itself. The licensing for the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents works is held by IDW as of 2012. However, these non-DC Archive Editions series published by DC are included in the list here, as the physical format (paper stock, size dimension, etc.) is similar enough that the average fan would consider them part of the overall DC Archive Editions series.

Each point in T(S) may be regarded as an isomorphism class of \\"marked\\" Riemann surfaces, where a \\"marking\\" is an isotopy class of homeomorphisms from S to itself. It can also be viewed as a moduli space for marked hyperbolic structure on the surface, and this endows it with a natural topology for which it is homeomorphic to a ball of dimension 6g-6 for a surface of genus g \\\\ge 2. In this way Teichm√ºller space can be viewed as the universal covering orbifold of the Riemann moduli space. The Teichm√ºller space has a canonical complex manifold structure and a wealth of natural metrics. The study of geometric features of these various structures is a very rich subject of research. Teichm√ºller spaces are named after Oswald Teichm√ºller.  History  Moduli spaces for Riemann surfaces and related Fuchsian groups have been studied since the work of Bernhard Riemann, who knew that 6g-6 parameters were needed to describe the variations of complex structures on a surface of genus g\\\\ge 2. The early study of Teichm√ºller space, in the late nineteenth‚Äìearly twentieth century, was geometric and founded on the interpretation of Riemann surfaces as hyperbolic surfaces. Among the main contributors were Felix Klein, Henri Poincar√©, Paul Koebe, Jakob Nielsen, Robert Fricke and Werner Fenchel. The main contribution of Teichm√ºller to the study of moduli was the introduction of quasiconformal mappings to the subject. They allow us to give much more depth to the study of moduli spaces by endowing them with additional features that were not present in the previous, more elementary works. After World War II the subject was developed further in this analytic vein, in particular by Lars Ahlfors and Lipman Bers. The theory continues to be active, with numerous studies of the complex structure of Teichm√ºller space (introduced by Bers). The geometric vein in the study of Teichm√ºller space was revived following the work of William Thurston in the late seventies, who introduced a geometric compactification which he used in his study of the mapping class group of a surface. Other more combinatorial objects associated to this group (in particular the curve complex) have also been related to Teichm√ºller space, and this is a very active subject of research in geometric group theory.  Definitions  = Teichm√ºller space from complex structures = Let S be an orientable smooth surface (a differentiable manifold of dimension 2). Informally the Teichm√ºller space T(S) of S is the space of Riemann surface structures on S up to isotopy. Formally it can be defined as follows. Two complex structures X, Y on S are said to be equivalent if there is a diffeomorphism f \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Diff}(S) such that: * It is holomorphic (the differential is complex linear at each point, for the structures X at the source and Y at the target) ; * it is isotopic to the identity of S (there is a continuous map \\\\gamma : [0,1] \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Diff}(S) such that \\\\gamma(0)=f, \\\\gamma(1) = \\\\mathrm{Id}). Then T(S) is the space of equivalence classes of complex structures on S for this relation. Another equivalent definition is as follows: T(S) is the space of pairs (X, g) where X is a Riemann surface and g: S \\\\to X a diffeomorphism, and two pairs (X, g), (Y,h) are regarded as equivalent if h \\\\circ g^{-1} : X \\\\to Y is isotopic to a holomorphic diffeomorphism. Such a pair is called a marked Riemann surface; the marking being the diffeomeorphism; another definition of markings is by systems of curves. There are two simple examples that are immediately computed from the Uniformisation theorem: there is a unique complex structure on the sphere \\\\mathbb S^2 (see Riemann sphere) and there are two on \\\\R^2 (the complex plane and the unit disk) and in each case the group of positive diffeomorphisms is contractible. Thus the Teichm√ºller space of \\\\mathbb S^2 is a single point and that of \\\\R^2 contains exactly two points. A slightly more involved example is the open annulus, for which the Teichm√ºller space is the interval [0, 1) (the complex structure associated to \\\\lambda is the Riemann surface \\\\\\\\{z \\\\in \\\\C : \\\\lambda < z < \\\\lambda^{-1} \\\\\\\\}). = The Teichm√ºller space of the torus and flat metrics = The next example is the torus \\\\mathbb T^2 = \\\\R^2/\\\\Z^2. In this case any complex structure can be realised by a Riemann surface of the form \\\\C/(\\\\Z + \\\\tau\\\\Z) (a complex elliptic curve) for a complex number \\\\tau \\\\in \\\\mathbb{H} where : \\\\mathbb{H} = \\\\\\\\{z \\\\in \\\\C : \\\\operatorname{Im}(z) > 0\\\\\\\\}, is the complex upper half-plane. Then we have a bijection: :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\mathbb{H} \\\\longrightarrow T(\\\\mathbb T^2) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\tau \\\\longmapsto (\\\\C/(\\\\Z + \\\\tau\\\\Z), (x, y) \\\\mapsto x + \\\\tau y) \\\\end{cases} and thus the Teichm√ºller space of \\\\mathbb T^2 is \\\\mathbb{H}. If we identify \\\\C with the Euclidean plane then each point in Teichm√ºller space can also be viewed as a marked flat structure on \\\\mathbb T^2. Thus the Teichm√ºller space is in bijection with the set of pairs (M,f) where M is a flat surface and f: \\\\mathbb T^2 \\\\to M is a diffeomorphism up to isotopy on f. = Finite type surfaces = These are the surfaces for which Teichm√ºller space is most often studied, which include closed surfaces. A surface is of finite type if it is diffeomorphic to a compact surface minus a finite set. If S is a closed surface of genus g then the surface obtained by removing k points from S is usually denoted S_{g,k} and its Teichm√ºller space by T_{g,k}. = Teichm√ºller spaces and hyperbolic metrics = Every finite type orientable surface other than the ones above admits complete Riemannian metrics of constant curvature -1. For a given surface of finite type there is a bijection between such metrics and complex structures as follows from the uniformisation theorem. Thus if 2g-2+k > 0 the Teichm√ºller space T_{g,k} can be realised as the set of marked hyperbolic surfaces of genus g with k cusps, that is the set of pairs (M, f) where M is an hyperbolic surface and f : S \\\\to M is a diffeomorphism, modulo the equivalence relation where (M, f) and (N, g) are identified is f \\\\circ g^{-1} is isotopic to an isometry. = The topology on Teichm√ºller space = In all cases computed above there is an obvious topology on Teichm√ºller space. In the general case there are many natural ways to topologise T(S), perhaps the simplest is via hyperbolic metrics and length functions. If \\\\alpha is a closed curve on S and x = (M, f) a marked hyperbolic surface then one f_*\\\\alpha is homotopic to a unique closed geodesic \\\\alpha_x on M (up to parametrisation). The value at x of the length function associated to (the homotopy class of) \\\\alpha is then: : \\\\ell_\\\\alpha(x) = \\\\operatorname{Length}(\\\\alpha_x). Let \\\\mathcal S be the set of simple closed curves on S. Then the map : \\\\begin{cases} T(S) \\\\to \\\\R^{\\\\mathcal S} \\\\\\\\\\\\ x \\\\mapsto \\\\left (\\\\ell_\\\\alpha(x) \\\\right )_{\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathcal S} \\\\end{cases} is an embedding. The space \\\\R^{\\\\mathcal S} has the product topology and T(S) is endowed with the induced topology. With this topology T(S_{g,k}) is homeomorphic to \\\\R^{6g - 6 + 2k}. In fact one can obtain an embedding with 9g-9 curves, and even 6g - 5 + 2k. In both case one can use the embedding to give a geometric proof of the homeomorphism above. = More examples of small Teichm√ºller spaces = There is a unique complete hyperbolic metric on the three-holed sphere and so the Teichm√ºller space T(S_{0,3}) is a point (this also follows from the dimension formula of the previous paragraph). The Teichm√ºller spaces T(S_{0,4}) and T(S_{1,1}) are naturally realised as the upper half-plane, as can be seen using Fenchel‚ÄìNielsen coordinates. = Teichm√ºller space and conformal structures = Instead of complex structures of hyperbolic metrics one can define Teichm√ºller space using conformal structures. Indeed, conformal structures are the same as complex structures in two (real) dimensions. Moreover, the Uniformisation Theorem also implies that in each conformal class of Riemannian metrics on a surface there is a unique metric of constant curvature. = Teichm√ºller spaces as representation spaces = Yet another interpretation of Teichm√ºller space is as a representation space for surface groups. If S is hyperbolic, of finite type and \\\\Gamma = \\\\pi_1(S) is the fundamental group of S then Teichm√ºller space is in natural bijection with: *The set of injective representations \\\\Gamma \\\\to \\\\mathrm{PSL}_2(\\\\R) with discrete image, up to conjugation by an element of \\\\mathrm{PSL}_2(\\\\R), if S is compact ; *In general, the set of such representations, with the added condition that those elements of \\\\Gamma which are represented by curves freely homotopic to a puncture are sent to parabolic elements of \\\\mathrm{PSL}_2(\\\\R), again up to conjugation by an element of \\\\mathrm{PSL}_2(\\\\R). The map sends a marked hyperbolic structure (M, f) to the composition \\\\rho \\\\circ f_* where \\\\rho: \\\\pi_1(M) \\\\to \\\\mathrm{PSL}_2(\\\\R) is the monodromy of the hyperbolic structure and f_*: \\\\pi_1(S) \\\\to \\\\pi_1(M) is the isomorphism induced by f. Note that this realises T(S) as a closed subset of \\\\mathrm{PSL}_2(\\\\R)^{2g+k-1} which endows it with a topology. This can be used to see the homeomorphism T(S) \\\\cong \\\\R^{6g - 6 + 2k} directly. This interpretation of Teichm√ºller space is generalised by higher Teichm√ºller theory, where the group \\\\mathrm{PSL}_2(\\\\R) is replaced by an arbitrary semisimple Lie group. = A remark on categories = All definitions above can be made in the topological category instead of the category of differentiable manifolds, and this does not change the objects. = Infinite-dimensional Teichm√ºller spaces = Surfaces which are not of finite type also admit hyperbolic structures, which can be parametrised by infinite-dimensional spaces (homeomorphic to \\\\R^\\\\N). Another example of infinite-dimensional space related to Teichm√ºller theory is the Teichm√ºller space of a lamination by surfaces.  Action of the mapping class group and relation to moduli space  = The map to moduli space = There is a map from Teichm√ºller space to the moduli space of Riemann surfaces diffeomorphic to S, defined by (X, f) \\\\mapsto X. It is a covering map, and since T(S) is simply connected it is the orbifold universal cover for the moduli space. = Action of the mapping class group = The mapping class group of S is the coset group MCG(S) of the diffeomorphism group of S by the normal subgroup of those that are isotopic to the identity (the same definition can be made with homeomorphisms instead of diffeomorphisms and this does not change the resulting group). The group of diffeomorphisms acts naturally on Teichm√ºller space by : g \\\\cdot (X, f) \\\\mapsto (X, f \\\\circ g^{-1}). If \\\\gamma \\\\in MCG(S) is a mapping class and g, h two diffeomorphisms representing it then they are isotopic. Thus the classes of (X, f \\\\circ g^{-1}) and (X, f \\\\circ h^{-1}) are the same in Teichm√ºller space, and the action above factorises through the mapping class group. The action of the mapping class group MCG(S) on the Teichm√ºller space is properly discontinuous, and the quotient is the moduli space. = Fixed points = The Nielsen realisation problem asks whether any finite group of the mapping class group has a global fixed point (a point fixed by all group elements) in Teichm√ºller space. In more classical terms the question is: can every finite subgroup of MCG(S) be realised as a group of isometries of some complete hyperbolic metric on S (or equivalently as a group of holomorphic diffeomorphisms of some complex structure). This was solved by Steven Kerckhoff.  Coordinates  = Fenchel‚ÄìNielsen coordinates = The Fenchel‚ÄìNielsen coordinates (so named after Werner Fenchel and Jakob Nielsen) on the Teichm√ºller space T(S) are associated to a pants decomposition of the surface S. This is a decomposition of S into pairs of pants, and to each curve in the decomposition is associated its length in the hyperbolic metric corresponding to the point in Teichm√ºller space, and another real parameter called the twist which is more involved to define. In case of a closed surface of genus g there are 3g - 3 curves in a pants decomposition and we get 6g-6 parameters, which is the dimension of T(S_g). The Fenchel‚ÄìNielsen coordinates in fact define a homeomorphism T(S_g) \\\\to ]0, +\\\\infty[^{3g-3} \\\\times \\\\R^{3g-3}. In the case of a surface with punctures some pairs of pants are \\"degenerate\\" (they have a cusp) and give only two length and twist parameters. Again in this case the Fenchel‚ÄìNielsen coordinates define a homeomorphism T(S_{g, k}) \\\\to ]0, +\\\\infty[^{3g-3 + k} \\\\times \\\\R^{3g-3 + k}. = Shear coordinates = If k > 0 the surface S = S_{g,k} admits ideal triangulations (whose vertices are exactly the punctures). By the formula for the Euler characteristic such a triangulation has 4g - 4 + 2k triangles. An hyperbolic structure M on S determines an (unique up to isotopy) diffeomorphism S \\\\to M sending every triangle to an hyperbolic ideal triangle, thus a point in T(S). The parameters for such a structure are the translation lengths for each pair of sides of the triangles glued in the triangulation. There are 6g - 6 + 3k such parameters which can each take any value in \\\\R, and the completeness of the structure corresponds to a linear equation and thus we get the right dimension 6g - 6 + 2k. These coordinates are called shear coordinates. For closed surfaces, a pair of pants can be decomposed as the union of two ideal triangles (it can be seen as an incomplete hyperbolic metric on the three-holed sphere). Thus we also get 3g - 3 shear coordinates on T(S_g). = Earthquakes = A simple earthquake path in Teichm√ºller space is a path determined by varying a single shear or length Fenchel‚ÄìNielsen coordinate (for a fixed ideal triangulation of a surface). The name comes from seeing the ideal triangles or the pants as tectonic plates and the shear as plate motion. More generally one can do earthquakes along geodesic laminations. A theorem of Thurston then states that two points in Teichm√ºller space are joined by a unique earthquake path.  Analytic theory  = Quasiconformal mappings = A quasiconformal mapping between two Riemann surfaces is a homeomorphism which deforms the conformal structure in a bounded manner over the surface. More precisely it is differentiable almost everywhere and there is a constant K \\\\ge 1, called the dilatation, such that : \\\\frac { f_z + f_{\\\\bar z} } { f_z - f_{\\\\bar z}} \\\\le K where f_z, f_{\\\\bar z} are the derivatives in a conformal coordinate z and its conjugate \\\\bar z. There are quasi-conformal mappings in every isotopy class and so an alternative definition for The Teichm√ºller space is as follows. Fix a Riemann surface X diffeomorphic to S, and Teichm√ºller space is in natural bijection with the marked surfaces (Y, g) where g: X \\\\to Y is a quasiconformal mapping, up to the same equivalence relation as above. = Quadratic differentials and the Bers embedding = Image of the Bers embedding of a punctured torus' 2-dimensional Teichm√ºller space With the definition above, if X = \\\\Gamma \\\\setminus \\\\mathbb{H}^2 there is a natural map from Teichm√ºller space to the space of \\\\Gamma-equivariant solutions to the Beltrami differential equation. These give rise, via the Schwarzian derivative, to quadratic differentials on X. The space of those is a complex space of complex dimension 3g - 3, and the image of Teichm√ºller space is an open set. This map is called the Bers embedding. A quadratic differential on X can be represented by a translation surface conformal to X. = Teichm√ºller mappings = Teichm√ºller's theorem states that between two marked Riemann surfaces (X, g) and (Y, h) there is always a unique quasiconformal mapping X \\\\to Y in the isotopy class of h \\\\circ g^{-1} which has minimal dilatation. This map is called a Teichm√ºller mapping. In the geometric picture this means that for every two diffeomorphic Riemann surfaces X, Y and diffeomorphism f: X \\\\to Y there exists two polygons representing X, Y and an affine map sending one to the other, which has smallest dilatation among all quasiconformal maps X \\\\to Y.  Metrics  = The Teichm√ºller metric = If x, y \\\\in T(S) and the Teichm√ºller mapping between them has dilatation K then the Teichm√ºller distance between them is by definition \\\\frac12 \\\\log K. This indeed defines a distance on T(S) which induces its topology, and for which it is complete. This is the metric most commonly used for the study of the metric geometry of Teichm√ºller space. In particular it is of interest to geometric group theorists. There is a function similarly defined, using the Lipschitz constants of maps between hyperbolic surfaces instead of the quasiconformal dilatations, on T(S) \\\\times T(S), which is not symmetric. = The Weil‚ÄìPetersson metric = Quadratic differentials on a Riemann surface X are identified with the tangent space at (X, f) to Teichm√ºller space., Chapter VI.D The Weil‚ÄìPetersson metric is the Riemannian metric defined by the L^2 inner product on quadratic differentials. Compactifications There are several inequivalent compactifications of Teichm√ºller spaces that have been studied. Several of the earlier compactifications depend on the choice of a point in Teichm√ºller space so are not invariant under the modular group, which can be inconvenient. William Thurston later found a compactification without this disadvantage, which has become the most widely used compactification. =Thurston compactification= By looking at the hyperbolic lengths of simple closed curves for each point in Teichm√ºller space and taking the closure in the (infinite-dimensional) projective space, introduced a compactification whose points at infinity correspond to projective measured laminations. The compactified space is homeomorphic to a closed ball. This Thurston compactification is acted on continuously by the modular group. In particular any element of the modular group has a fixed point in Thurston's compactification, which Thurston used in his classification of elements of the modular group. =Bers compactification= The Bers compactification is given by taking the closure of the image of the Bers embedding of Teichm√ºller space, studied by . The Bers embedding depends on the choice of a point in Teichm√ºller space so is not invariant under the modular group, and in fact the modular group does not act continuously on the Bers compactification. =Teichm√ºller compactification= The \\"points at infinity\\" in the Teichm√ºller compactification consist of geodesic rays (for the Teichm√ºller metric) starting at a fixed basepoint. This compactification depends on the choice of basepoint so is not acted on by the modular group, and in fact Kerckhoff showed that the action of the modular group on Teichm√ºller space does not extend to a continuous action on this compactification. =Gardiner‚ÄìMasur compactification= considered a compactification similar to the Thurston compactification, but using extremal length rather than hyperbolic length. The modular group acts continuously on this compactification, but they showed that their compactification has strictly more points at infinity.  Large-scale geometry  There has been an extensive study of the geometric properties of Teichm√ºller space endowed with the Teichm√ºller metric. Known large-scale properties include: *Teichm√ºller space T(S_{g,k}) contains flat subspaces of dimension 3g - 3 + k, and there are no higher-dimensional quasi-isometrically embedded flats. *In particular, if g>1 or g=1, k>1 or g=0, k>4 then T(S_{g,k}) is not hyperbolic. On the other hand, Teichm√ºller space exhibits several properties characteristic of hyperbolic spaces, such as: *Some geodesics behave like they do in hyperbolic space. *Random walks on Teichm√ºller space converge almost surely to a point on the Thurston boundary. Some of these features can be explained by the study of maps from Teichm√ºller space to the curve complex, which is known to be hyperbolic.  Complex geometry  The Bers embedding gives T(S) a complex structure as an open subset of \\\\C^{3g-3}. = Metrics coming from the complex structure = Since Teichm√ºller space is a complex manifold it carries a Carath√©odory metric. Teichm√ºller space is Kobayashi hyperbolic and its Kobayashi metric coincides with the Teichm√ºller metric. This latter result is used in Royden's proof that the mapping class group is the full group of isometries for the Teichm√ºller metric. The Bers embedding realises Teichm√ºller space as a domain of holomorphy and hence it also carries a Bergman metric. =K√§hler metrics on Teichm√ºller space= The Weil‚ÄìPetersson metric is K√§hler but it is not complete. Cheng and Yau showed that there is a unique complete K√§hler‚ÄìEinstein metric on Teichm√ºller space. It has constant negative scalar curvature. Teichm√ºller space also carries a complete K√§hler metric of bounded sectional curvature introduced by that is K√§hler-hyperbolic. = Equivalence of metrics = With the exception of the incomplete Weil‚ÄìPetersson metric, all metrics on Teichm√ºller space introduced here are quasi-isometric to each other.

It is a primitive Greek Revival house built in the 1840s by Robert Sheegog. Faulkner purchased the house when it was in disrepair in the 1930s and did many of the renovations himself. Other renovations were done in the 1950s. One of its more famous features is the outline of Faulkner's Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning novel A Fable, penciled in graphite and red on the plaster wall of his study. The house sits on four landscaped acres, surrounded by 29 acres of wooded property known as Bailey's Woods. Though the \\"rowan oak\\" is a mythical tree, the grounds and surrounding woods of Rowan Oak contain hundreds of species of native Mississippi plants, most of which date back to antebellum times. The alley of cedars that lines the driveway was common in the 19th century. The studs of the house are 4\\"x4\\" square cypress, which were hand-hewn. Faulkner drew much inspiration for his treatment of multi-layered time from Rowan Oak, where past and future seemed to inhabit the present. In 1972, his daughter, Jill Faulkner Summers, sold the house to the University of Mississippi. The University maintains the home in order to promote Faulkner's literary heritage. Tours are available. The home has been visited by such writers as John Updike, Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz, Charles Simic, Richard Ford, James Lee Burke, Bei Dao, Charles Wright, Charles Frazier, Alice Walker, the Coen brothers, Bobbie Ann Mason, Salman Rushdie, and others. Writer Mark Richard once repaired a faulty doorknob on the French door to Faulkner's study.left Rowan Oak was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1968. and Rowan Oak Landmark After its most recent renovations, some of which were funded by the novelist John Grisham, a part-time Oxford resident and Ole Miss law school alumnus, Rowan Oak was rededicated on May 1, 2005. The current curator of Rowan Oak is William Griffith. Past curators include the novelists Howard Bahr and Cynthia Shearer. The original curator was Bev Smith, an Ole Miss alum, who was responsible for finding a great deal of Faulkner's original manuscripts hidden within the home.

The story begins with the childhood and exceptional and accomplished youth of Prince Stepan Kasatsky. The young man is destined for great things. He discovers on the eve of his wedding that his fianc√©e Countess Mary Korotkova has had an affair with his beloved Tsar Nicholas I. The blow to his pride is massive, and he retreats to the arms of Russian Orthodoxy and becomes a monk. Many years of humility and doubt follow. He is ordered to become a hermit. Despite his being removed from the world, he is still remembered for having so remarkably transformed his life. One winter night, a group of merry- makers decide to visit him, and one of them, a divorced woman named Makovkina, spends the night in his cell, with the intention to seduce him. Father Sergius discovers he is still weak and in order to protect himself, cuts off his own finger. Makovkina is stunned by this act, and leaves the next morning, having vowed to change her life. A year later she has joined a convent. Father Sergius' reputation for holiness grows. He becomes known as a healer, and pilgrims come from far and wide. Yet Father Sergius is profoundly aware of his inability to attain a true faith. He is still tortured by boredom, pride, and lust. He fails a new test, when the young daughter of a merchant successfully beds him. The morning after, he leaves the monastery and seeks out Pashenka (Praskovya Mikhaylovna), whom he, with a group of other boys, had tormented many years ago. He finds her, now in all the conventional senses a failure in life, yet imbued with a sense of service towards her family. His path is now clearer.

A. Russell, also known as Fort Francis E. Warren, Francis E. Warren Air Force Base and Fort David A. Russell, was a post and base of operations for the United States Army, and later the Air Force, located in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The fort had been established in 1867 to protect workers for the Union Pacific Railroad. It was named in honor of David Allen Russell, a Civil War general killed at the Battle of Opequon. In 1930, the fort's name was changed to Fort Francis E. Warren. In 1949, it became Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. Over the years, the base served as home for numerous influential American military leaders such as Carl Spaatz, Black Jack Pershing, Billy Mitchell, Walter Reed, and Mark Clark. A portion of the base was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1975, for distinctively preserving many of the stages of its evolution from a frontier cavalry base to an Air Force base. __TOC__ History Units of the 30th Infantry under Colonel John D. Stevenson began building the fort and nearby quartermaster depot (Cheyenne Depot) in August 1867. In September the first cavalry arrived, Company H of 2nd Cavalry In 1884, it became a permanent base. It was the home to three Black regiments: the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 24th Infantry (the famous Buffalo Soldiers) for much of the late 19th century. By the turn of the 20th century, Fort D. A. Russell was one of the largest cavalry bases in the United States and several more expansions in the early 20th century further increased its size. In 1919, the airfield became active and soon served as the home field for over 100 military aircraft. During the transition from cavalry to airplanes, the post was commanded by Edmund Wittenmyer, a veteran of World War I. The last cavalry units on the post were deactivated in 1927. In 1930, the base was renamed Fort Francis E. Warren. Warren was a Medal of Honor recipient who served as Governor of Wyoming. During World War II, Fort Francis E. Warren served as a training facility for the US Army Quartermaster Corps. A prisoner of war camp was also constructed on the site. In 1949, the base was redesignated the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base and became part of the Strategic Air Command in 1958. The base became the headquarters for the 90th Strategic Missile Wing in 1963. The wing controlled over 200 ICBMs during the Cold War. The base was the only missile wing to have Peacekeeper missiles which were deactivated in October 2005. On October 1, 1993, the Twentieth Air Force, which controls all of America's ICBM wings, relocated its headquarters to Warren. The fort was designated a National Historic Landmark on May 15, 1975, while still Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. and . Renovations The majority of the structures in the historic district have been maintained. At least 88 housing units have been abated for lead and asbestos materials. Three buildings were renovated in accordance with standards of the U.S. Secretary of the Interior. The Air Force was tasked to restore the two deck porches on many buildings in the district.

As a prince, the bishop of Li√®ge was an Imperial Estate and had seat and vote at the Imperial Diet. The Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge should not be confused with the Diocese of Li√®ge, which was larger and over which the prince-bishop exercised only the usual responsibilities of a bishop. The bishops of Li√®ge acquired their status as a prince-bishop between 980 and 985 when Bishop Notger, who had been the bishop of Liege since 972, received secular control of the County of Huy from Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor. The prince-bishopric belonged from 1500 on to the Lower Rhenish‚ÄìWestphalian Circle. Its territory included most of the present Belgian provinces of Li√®ge and Limburg, and some exclaves in other parts of Belgium and the Netherlands. It briefly became a republic (the Republic of Li√®ge) from 1789 to 1791, before reverting to a prince-bishopric in 1791. The role of the bishop as prince permanently ended when the state was annexed by France in 1795. In 1815 the territories it had held became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and in 1830 they were within the part of that kingdom which split off to become Belgium. The principality ruled by the bishops of Li√®ge was never part of the Seventeen Provinces or the Spanish and Austrian Southern Netherlands, but from the 16th century onwards its politics were strongly influenced by the dukes of Burgundy and later the Habsburgs. In 1559 its 1,636 parishes were grouped into eight archdeaconries, and twenty-eight councils, ' (deaneries). The most important cities (') of the bishopric were: Li√®ge, Beringen, Bilzen, Borgloon, Bree, Ch√¢telet, Ciney, Couvin, Dinant, Fosses-la- Ville, Hamont, Hasselt, Herk-de-Stad, Huy, Maaseik, Peer, Sint-Truiden, Stokkem, Thuin, Tongeren, Verviers, Vis√© and Waremme. The city of Maastricht fell under the joint jurisdiction of the prince-bishop of Li√®ge and the duke of Brabant (later the States-General of the United Provinces). The second city of the prince-bishopric thus kept its ' throughout the '. Medieval prince- bishopric This map shows the pre-1559 medieval Diocese of Li√®ge (in green) which evolved from the ' and probably had similar boundaries. The large diocese of the medieval bishops was, until 1559, much larger than the princedom which was in their possession. However, the princely domain was gradually enlarged by donations and by acquisitions. In the 10th century, the bishops received secular power over the county of Huy, which lay within of the diocese. Bishop Notger (972‚Äì1008) thus became a sovereign prince. This status was retained by his successors until the French Revolution, and throughout that period of nearly eight centuries the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge succeeded in maintaining a level of autonomy, though theoretically it was part of the Holy Roman Empire. This virtual independence was owed largely to the ability of its bishops, who on several occasions played an important part in international politics, being strategically positioned between France and Germany, . Throughout the Middle Ages, the prince-bishopric was further expanded with the lordship of Bouillon in 1096 (ceded to France in 1678), the acquisition of the county of Loon () in 1366 and the county of Horne in 1568. Notger, the founder of the principality, also rebuilt the cathedral of St Lambert, as well as the episcopal palace. He was also involved in other building activities in the city, which flourished under his rule (churches of St Paul, St. John the Evangelist, Sainte-Croix and St Denis). This bishop also strengthened the parochial organization of the city. He was one of the first church leaders to spread the observance of All Souls' Day, which he authorized for his diocese. Under Notger's administration, following up on the work of Heraclius, educational institutions in Li√®ge flourished. With these two bishops (and Wazo) \\"The schools of Li√®ge were, in fact, at that time one of the brightest literary foci of the period\\". In the 11th century the city was indeed known as the Athens of the North. \\"Li√®ge for more than a century occupied among the nations a position in regard to science which it has never recovered\\". Subsequent bishops, Balderic of Looz (1008‚Äì18), Wolbodo (1018‚Äì21), Durandus (1021‚Äì25), Reginard (1025‚Äì38), Nitard (1038‚Äì42), the learned Wazo, and Theoduin (1048‚Äì75), valiantly sustained the heritage of Notger. The schools formed many brilliant scholars, and gave the Catholic Church popes Stephen IX and Nicholas II. The diocese also supplied the University of Paris with a number of important doctors ‚Äî William of Saint-Thierry, Gerard of Li√®ge and Godfrey of Fontaines. Alger of Li√®ge (1055‚Äì1131) was an important intellectual of the period. He was first appointed deacon of church of St Bartholomew and finally retired at the monastery of Cluny. In the reign of Henry of Verdun (1075‚Äì91) a tribunal was instituted (') to prevent war and enforce the Peace of God. Otbert (1091‚Äì1119) increased the territory of the principality by purchasing the Lordship of Bouillon. He remained faithful to emperor Henry IV, who died as his guest. Henry of Namur (1119‚Äì21) was venerated as a martyr. During the administration of Alexander of Juliers (1128‚Äì34) the pope, the emperor and St Bernard of Clairvaux visited Li√®ge. The episcopate of Raoul of Zachringen was marked by the preaching of the reformer Lambert le B√®gue, who is credited with founding the B√©guines. Albert of Louvain was elected Bishop of Li√®ge in 1191, but Emperor Henry VI, on the pretext that the election was doubtful, gave the see to Lothair of Hochstadt. Albero's election was confirmed by the pope but in 1192, shortly after he took office, he was assassinated by three German knights at Reims. It is probable that the emperor was privy to this murder but Albero was canonized. In 1195, Albert de Cuyck (1195‚Äì1200) formally recognized the political franchise of the people of Li√®ge. During the 12th century, the cathedral chapter, along with the bishop, assumed a more important role in the history of the principality. The struggles between the upper and lower classes, in which the prince-bishops frequently intervened, developed through the 13th and 14th centuries, and culminate in the 15th century in the pillage and destruction of the episcopal city. In the reign of Robert of Thourotte (1240‚Äì46), Saint Juliana ‚Äî a nun of Cornillon Abbey ‚Äî was led by certain visions to the project of having a feast established in honour of the Blessed Sacrament. After much hesitation, the bishop approved of her idea but death prevented the institution of the feast. The completion of the work was left to a former prior of the Dominicans in Li√®ge, Hugh of Saint-Cher, who returned to the city as papal legate. In 1252 Hugh made the feast of the Blessed Sacrament an obligation throughout his diocese. John of Troyes, who, after having been archdeacon at Li√®ge, was elected pope as Urban IV, encouraged the observance of the feast of Corpus Christi in the whole Church. Another archdeacon of Li√®ge became pope under the name Gregory X and deposed the unworthy Henry of Gueldres (1247‚Äì74). The Peace of Fexhe, signed in 1316 during the reign of Adolph II de la Marck (1313‚Äì44), regulated the relations between the prince-bishop and his subjects. Nevertheless, internal discord continued and the episcopate of Arnold of Horne (1378‚Äì89) was marked by the triumph of the popular party. In 1366, the county of Loon was annexed to the bishopric. Burgundian and Habsburg influence Prince-Bishop Johann Theodor of Bavaria at a court concert at Li√®ge The Archiepiscopal Palace at Li√®ge Upon the death of Louis of Male, count of Flanders, in 1384, the Low Countries began their unification within the Burgundian Netherlands. Though the Principality was still nominally independent, the Dukes of Burgundy have had an increasing influence on its government. Louis of Bourbon (1456‚Äì82) was placed on the throne of Li√®ge by the political machinations of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. The population resisted Burgundian rule leading to the Li√®ge Wars, the destruction of Dinant in 1466, and of Li√®ge in 1468 by Charles the Bold, marking the ending of democratic ascendancy in the Principality. Charles V completed the union of the Seventeen Provinces in the 1540s, and unofficially also controlled the principality. He nominated Erard de la Marck (1505‚Äì38) who brought a period of restoration. Erard was an enlightened protector of the arts. It was he who commenced the struggle against the Protestant reformers, which his successors carried forth, especially Gerard of Groesbeeck (1564‚Äì80). With the object of assisting in this struggle, Paul IV, by Bull (', 12 May 1559), created new bishoprics in the Low Countries. The new bishoprics were created largely at the expense of the diocese of Li√®ge; many of its parishes were given to the dioceses of Roermond, 's-Hertogenbosch, and Namur, or were added to the existing dioceses of Mechelen and Antwerp. The number of deaneries in the diocese of Li√®ge was reduced to 13. Li√®ge formed the last link in the chain of Habsburg allies that made up the so-called Spanish Road, a military corridor between Spanish-controlled Lombardy and the Spanish Netherlands. Completely encircled by Spanish territory, Li√®ge was protected by treaties of neutrality which permitted the passage of Spanish troops through the prince-bishop's territory provided that they spent no more than two nights in one place. The importance of the prince-bishopric to Habsburg military logistics in the Eighty Years War prompted Spanish intervention foiling a Dutch invasion in 1595. Most of the bishops in the 17th century were foreigners, many of them holding several bishoprics at once. Their frequent absences gave free scope for those feuds of the Chiroux and the Grignoux to which Maximilian Henry of Bavaria (archbishop of Cologne, 1650‚Äì88) put a stop by the Edict of 1681. In the middle of the 18th century the ideas of the French encyclopedists began to be received at Li√®ge; Bishop de Velbr√ºck (1772‚Äì84), encouraged their propagation and thus prepared the way for the . Partially connected with the French Revolution, a protest against the absolutist rule of prince bishop Cesar Constantijn Frans van Hoensbroeck developed into the 1789 Revolution in Li√®ge. At the beginning of 1791, the revolution was crushed by troops on the orders of the Holy Roman Empire. The prince-bishopric was dissolved in 1795, when it was annexed by France. Its territory was divided over the d√©partements Meuse-Inf√©rieure, Ourthe, and Sambre-et-Meuse.

Corporate history  Founded in January 1995, ICO Global Communications, planned to build a mobile-satellite service (MSS) constellation in medium Earth orbit (in two 45¬∞-inclined orthogonal planes), and had contracted Boeing Satellite Development Center (then Hughes) for 12 spacecraft in July of that year ‚Äî ten operational spacecraft and two in-orbit spares. ICO filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 1999, but emerged as New ICO in May 2000, following investments by Craig McCaw and others. ICO has pursued plans to build and launch a geosynchronous satellite to cover North America, supplemented by an ancillary terrestrial component. ICO G1 launched on April 14, 2008, and ICO's application for an ancillary terrestrial component was approved by the Federal Communications Commission in January 2009. In June 2011 ICO Global Communications was renamed to Pendrell Corporation ().  Early satellites  The first spacecraft, a Hughes HS 601 designated ICO F-1, was lost due to a Sea Launch anomaly on March 12, 2000. In September 2000, ICO contracted Hughes for three additional spacecraft, and Hughes agreed to modify the 11 remaining spacecraft from the original contract to support an ICO re- design of the system. Hughes Space Systems subsequently became a subsidiary of the Boeing Corporation. On June 19, 2001, the second spacecraft, ICO F2, was successfully launched by an Atlas II AS from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The remaining spacecraft are in storage in various stages of near completion, and litigation between ICO and Boeing involving the ICO MEO satellites went to trial in June, 2008. In October, 2008, a jury awarded ICO $371 million in damages and $236 million in punitive damages in verdicts which found Boeing guilty of fraud, tortious interference and breach of contract. The Los Angeles County Superior Court finalized the verdict in March, 2009 in an amount totaling $603 million.  G1 satellite  The ICO G1 satellite was built by Space Systems/Loral, based on the Loral 1300 platform. A contract to launch the satellite was signed with Lockheed Martin, who announced plans to launch the satellite on an Atlas V launch vehicle, flying in the 421 configuration. Launch, from Space Launch Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station occurred at 20:12:00 GMT on April 4, 2008. The satellite separated from the carrier rocket 30 minutes and 49 seconds later, completing a successful launch. It is currently in a nominal geosynchronous orbit. At the time, ICO G1 was the largest commercial satellite ever launched.ICO Launches New Era in Mobile Satellite Services - ico.com - April 14, 2008 A larger satellite based on the same Loral 1300 platform, TerreStar-1, was successfully launched on July 1, 2009. = G1= The G1 satellite is intended to support a wide range of mobile voice, video and data services, and covers the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.

Blunt (April 24, 1908, in Andover, Massachusetts ‚Äì January 7, 2004, in Durham, North Carolina) was an American high school and collegiate track and basketball coach. Blunt's mother moved to Massachusetts from Virginia to work as a domestic. His family lived in Massachusetts' Merrimack Valley during a time when the Black population was tiny, but he recalled the large annual church picnic outing that families from neighboring Lynn, Lowell, and Haverhill would attend each summer in Salem, Massachusetts. He attended the old Punchard High School. As a young man and collegian, Russell earned money by waiting tables in the dining hall at the famed Andover Prep school (Phillips Academy). He also played semipro baseball for the St. Clair Oil Company team, the Andover Giants, and a team called Tyer Rubber, usually as a catcher. With a baseball team called the Fairviews out of Seabrook, N.H., Blunt earned $5 and $7 a game as a catcher. Some of his teammates in those days had surnames later heavily associated with Massachusetts baseball, such as \\"Gagne\\" and \\"Bedrosian\\". In 1927, Blunt left his home town in Massachusetts to attend St. Paul's Normal and Industrial in Lawrenceville, Virginia. When the train reached the Mason‚ÄìDixon line, he had to switch cars because of segregation. Blunt graduated from St. Augustine's College in 1936, where he began his coaching career. Blunt coached every year until his retirement, except in 1944, when he earned his master's degree from Boston University. In addition to becoming an assistant football coach at St. Paul's in 1946, Blunt also worked as a basketball official. He started coaching at Hillside High in Durham, North Carolina in 1955. His teams won 10 state outdoor track championships, seven indoor track championships and had one stretch where they didn't lose a dual meet for thirteen years. He also coached high school basketball at Hillside- his best known players were future college All- Americans and NBA players John Lucas, and Rodney Rogers. In the 1990s, USA Today published an article that stated Coach Blunt was the oldest h.s. basketball coach in America. Dr. Blunt was inducted into the National High School Hall of Fame in 1995 and the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 1996. He was a close friend of legendary University of North Carolina men's basketball Coach Dean Smith, and most other prominent local college coaches. Duke University's Russell E.

The word Forza is Italian for strength. The game is the first installment in the Forza series, a series that has continued on Microsoft's subsequent consoles, the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One. It features over 200 cars and multiple real world and fictional race courses. It also featured online multiplayer via Xbox Live. Forza Motorsport received universal acclaim according to the review aggregation website Metacritic, and received a Gold sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The NPD Group reported that in its release month the game sold over 100,000 copies in North America. Gameplay Xbox console. Forza Motorsport is a simulation racing video game. Players compete in events around the globe using real licensed cars on a variety of real world and fictional courses. It features an arcade mode, meant more for quickplay of races, and a career mode, which is focused on long-term play. Career mode spans several racing disciplines, spanning from racing of common commuter cars to those in racing series such as Super GT and Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters as well as other sports car racing series. To help players acclimate to the simulation style of racing, assists such as an ideal racing line, anti-lock brakes and traction control can be used. There are 231 cars in Forza Motorsport ranging from a Honda Civic to supercars such as the Enzo Ferrari and Le Mans race prototypes such as the Audi R8. There are nine classes of cars, spanning standard production vehicles to sports and high performance cars to purpose-built race cars. Each car can be upgraded and tuned with a large number of extras and parts.Forza In-Depth - IGN Vehicles can be customized by the player, both visually and performance-wise. In addition to adding body parts such as hood scoops and body kits, players can add multiple layers of decals to the vehicles. Upgrades are separated into three categories: engine/power, appearance/aerodynamics and chassis/drivetrain. There is a wide range of tuning available including tire pressure, which changes during races due to temperature, downforce, gear ratios and limited slip differential. Vehicles can be realistically damaged, from both a cosmetic and a performance standpoint. This changes the way the game is played, as collisions with barriers and other cars will alter the car's handling, top speed and acceleration. More noticeably, spoilers can be knocked off cars, bumpers dangle from their supports, paint can be scraped off and windows can be smashed completely. The game contains a mix of licensed, street, point to point and original circuits. Real world tracks Road Atlanta, Silverstone, Laguna Seca, Tsukuba, Road America, and N√ºrburgring Nordschleife were licensed and included. Furthermore, the game's Blue Mountains Raceway circuit is heavily comparable in track layout, characteristics and backgrounds with the Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst. In addition to these, Forza Motorsport also contains a wide variety of autocross, oval, and dragstrip courses. Each of these could be played online through the original Xbox Live service or through System Link, which allows multiple Xbox consoles to be interconnected through a local area network. Network multiplayer is no longer available via Xbox Live, which was discontinued by Microsoft on April 15, 2010. The game is backwards compatible, and can be played on the Xbox 360, though as it uses the original Xbox Live service there is no online play. Development In addition to several production cars, Forza Motorsport features cars from various racing disciplines, such as this 2005 Yellow Hat Toyota Supra, which competed in the Japanese Super GT racing series. Forza Motorsport was announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2004.E3 2004: Press Conference: Microsoft Delivers the Goods - IGN Development of the game took over two and a half years.Q&A;: Microsoft's Ken Lobb - GameSpot The release was delayed at three times, with GameSpot reporting the first delay from a December 2004 release to February 2005.Forza Motorsport to hit the road next February - GameSpot It would later be delayed until April 2005.Forza Motorsport garaged until April 2005 - GameSpot It was delayed one last time, and the game was released May 3, 2005 in North America and May 13, 2005 in Europe.Forza Motorsport shifts into reverse - GameSpot To promote Forza and other Xbox Live titles Microsoft teamed up with EB Games to provide 25 kiosks with games that could be played online through the service. Forza was the first of these titles to be displayed and playable on the kiosks.EB Games teams with Xbox Live - GameSpot It was shown at multiple events during its development. Following E3 2004, it was shown at GameRiot, a traveling game event.Unreleased titles dot GameRiot's summer lineup - GameSpot It further was featured at the 2004 Tokyo Game Show.Forza Motorsport Updated Hands-On - GameSpot It was developed to allow for multiple Xbox consoles to be linked directly and/or to be played online via Xbox Live. A customization system was developed where players can create custom layers over sections of the car, similar to layers in professional image programs such as Adobe Photoshop. Objects can be change in shape, scale and color, which allowed for players to create custom designs and liveries. Each car is divided into six sections, and each section can handle up to 100 layers. A custom soundtrack was composed by DJ Junkie XL, which features 56 original music tracks.Junkie XL and Forza Motorsport Collide - IGN The game began with a team of only 20 people and was, according to Turn 10 studio head Dan Greenawalt, originally an excellent simulator, but not as fun as a game. He stated that the team then worked \\"to make the physics more accessible, more handle-able. So we started on the game.\\"Forza Motorsport - IGN Greenawalt further noted that he wanted it to be a \\"car collecting game.\\" To aid with that Turn 10 hired a designer formerly of Nintendo's Pok√©mon team and said that the team \\"played a lot of Animal Crossing and Diablo II.\\" It was developed to display in high definition at 480p, and supports Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.Forza Motorsport - IGN The team developed drivitar technology, which is an artificial intelligence avatar for the player which learns from the players habits. The player can assign the drivitar to compete in races which they do not wish to, such as endurance races. Like the majority of major racing simulators, Forza Motorsport is designed to calculate a car's performance in real time using physical data (for example, the weight of a car's engine, its drag coefficient, etc.), consequently causing the cars to mimic the handling characteristics of their real-life counterparts. In 2005, Popular Science magazine tested this effect by inviting professional race car driver Gunnar Jeannette and a car enthusiast without major professional motorsports experience to drive identical cars on an identical track in both Forza Motorsport and the real world. Aside from several cars which were either in challenging physical condition or lacking identical setups, Jeannette's track times matched closely from his performance on the real track and in virtual reality. The amateur's real world times in all of the cars were roughly identical despite a 16-second spread between fastest and slowest in Forza, which he attributed to his fear of the consequences of driving too hard causing him to drive more slowly in the faster cars. Reception Forza Motorsport received a Gold sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The NPD Group reported that in its release month the game sold over 100,000 copies in North America.NPD: May sell-through spikes skyward - GameSpot Forza Motorsport received universal acclaim according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

Che Chou of 1UP.com commented that Forza was the \\"most realistic console racer ever made\\". GameSpot's Brian Ekberg noted how well the game balanced accessibility and pleasing genre fans. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer liked the game's online integration. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one eight, two sevens, and one nine for a total of 31 out of 40. Maxim gave the game all five stars, saying, \\"Microsoft Game Studios' answer to Sony's automotive masterpiece is simple‚Äìadd online play and program cars that take realistic damage.\\" The Times also gave it all five stars, saying that \\"the really ingenious element is the Drivatar AI, in which the computer learns your driving technique.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald gave it four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, \\"Car handling is demanding, but beginners can instantly have fun, thanks to helpful driving assists and generous early prizes.\\" However, Jim Schaefer of Detroit Free Press gave it three stars out of four, saying, \\"man, is this game difficult, even on the easy setting. I prefer games with unreal speed, power boosts and shortcuts. I just couldn't seem to get a grip on Forza until I played around with different cars, perusing the six classes, from standard production cars like your basic Honda Civic to race cars like the Audi R8.\\" References External links * 2005 video games Forza series Microsoft franchises Microsoft games Multiplayer online games Video games developed in the United States Video games set in California Video games set in England Video games set in Georgia (U.S. state) Video games set in Germany Video games set in Japan Xbox games Xbox-only games Works by Junkie XL ","title":"Forza Motorsport"},{"id":"1835796","text":"Pachygnatha zappa is a spider named after musician Frank Zappa because of its unique markings which resemble his famous moustache.

It asserts that judges should hesitate to strike down laws unless they are obviously unconstitutional, though what counts as obviously unconstitutional is itself a matter of some debate.https://ssrn.com/abstract=2029687 Judicial restraint is sometimes regarded as the opposite of judicial activism. In deciding questions of constitutional law, judicially restrained jurists go to great lengths to defer to the legislature. Judicially restrained judges respect stare decisis, the principle of upholding established precedent handed down by past judges.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961645-6,00.html This doctrine states how domestic courts will abstain from passing judgement over the acts of a foreign sovereign done in its own territory. Liberal restraint was shown in Whole Woman's Health v Hellerstedt in which the 1973 decision of Roe v Wade was upheld in favour of a woman's right to abortion. Cases on abortion have been heard since then, and while some have placed limitations on it, or allowed individual states to decide on those limitations, the unwillingness of the Court to overturn this decision remains. Conservative restraint was shown in Glossip v Gross in which support was built in favour of the continued use of lethal injection. The case suggested that prisoners could only challenge the method of execution by providing an alternative method of execution. The Court argued that it was the responsibility of the prisoner to demonstrate that the execution method caused severe pain, not the responsibility of the state. Leading voices in judicial restraint Former Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., considered to be one of the first major advocates of the philosophy, would describe the importance of judicial restraint in many of his books.http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25262-oliver-wendell- holmes-jr-legal-theory-and-judicial-restraint/ One noted academic described Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter, a Democrat appointed by Franklin Roosevelt, as the \\"model of judicial restraint\\".A Justice for All, by Kim Isaac Eisler, page 11; When the conservative Rehnquist Court overturned some of the precedents of the more liberal Warren Court, Time magazine said he was not following the theory of judicial restraint.

Minimalists argue that judges should make only minor, incremental changes to constitutional law to maintain that stability. They ask judges to do this by creating small, case-specific rulings rather than broad, sweeping rulings. Political question doctrine The political question doctrine encourages courts to decline to rule in certain categories of politically controversial cases. Under this theory, a court acknowledges that the Constitution might have been violated but declines to act.

Caterina was the illegitimate daughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza, Duke of Milan and Lucrezia, the wife of the courtier Gian Piero Landriani, a close friend of the Duke. She was raised in the refined Milanese court. The descendant of a dynasty of noted condottieri, from an early age, Caterina distinguished herself through her bold and impetuous actions taken to safeguard her possessions from possible usurpers and to defend her dominions from attack, when they were involved in political intrigues. In her private life, Caterina was devoted to various activities, including experiments in alchemy and a love of hunting and dancing. She had many children, but only the youngest, Captain Giovanni delle Bande Nere, inherited his mother's forceful, militant personality. Caterina's resistance to Cesare Borgia meant she had to face his fury and imprisonment. Once she gained her freedom in Rome, she led a quiet life in Florence. In the final years of her life, she confided to a monk: \\"Se io potessi scrivere tutto, farei stupire il mondo\\" (If I could write everything that happened, I would shock the world). Life =Childhood= Caterina Sforza was born in Milan in early 1463, the illegitimate daughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza by his mistress, Lucrezia Landriani. It's believed that she spent the first years of her life with her mother's relatives. The bond between mother and daughter was never interrupted: in fact, Lucrezia followed Caterina's growth and was always close to her in the crucial moments of her life, even in the final years that she spent in Florence. Upon the succession of Galeazzo Maria Sforza as Duke of Milan in 1466, following the death of his father Francesco, Galeazzo arranged for his four children by Lucrezia Landriani to come to court: Carlo (born in 1461; later Count of Magenta), Caterina, Alessandro (born in 1465; later Lord of Francavilla) and Chiara (born in 1467; by her first marriage, she became Countess dal Verme di Sanguinetto and Lady of Vigevano; by her second marriage, she became Lady of Novi). The children were entrusted to their paternal grandmother, Bianca Maria Visconti. In 1466, Galeazzo had married Dorotea Gonzaga, but after her death he remarried to Bona of Savoy on 9 May 1468, who eventually adopted them all. At the Sforza court, frequented by writers and artists, Caterina and her siblings received a humanistic education. At that time, in the Italian courts, daughters of noble families received the same education as their brothers. In addition to Latin and the reading of the classics, as prescribed by her teachers, Caterina learned, especially from her paternal grandmother, to take pride in her warlike ancestors, to show boldness in the use of arms, and astuteness in the skill of government. From her adoptive mother, she received her share of the maternal warmth and affection that Bona of Savoy poured over all of the children of her husband; this continued ‚Äì after Caterina had left the Milanese court ‚Äì in the form of correspondence between the two women. The duke's family resided in Milan and in Pavia, and often stayed at Galliate or at Cusago, where Galeazzo Maria devoted himself to hunting. At one or the other of the two places Caterina also probably acquired her lifelong passion for hunting. =First marriage= Count Girolamo Riario Riario Coat of Arms In 1473, Caterina became betrothed to Girolamo Riario, the son of Paolo Riario and Bianca della Rovere, sister of Pope Sixtus IV (in office: 1471‚Äì1484).Persistent rumours, however, portrayed Girolamo as a natural son of the Pope. Caterina replaced her cousin, the 11-year-old Costanza Fogliani, as Girolamo's bride because, according to some historians, Costanza's mother Gabriella Gonzaga (illegitimate daughter of Marquis Ludovico III of Mantua) refused to allow the consummation of the marriage until Costanza reached the legal age‚Äîthen 14‚Äîwhile Caterina, although only ten years old at that time, agreed with the demands of the groom; other sources instead reported that the marriage of Caterina and Girolamo was celebrated on 17 January 1473, but consummated four years later (1477) when Caterina reached the age of fourteen, without giving further details about the broken betrothal with Costanza. Pope Sixtus IV gave Girolamo the Lordship of Imola, already a Sforza city, but at the time a fief of the Riario family. After a triumphal entrance into Imola in 1477, Caterina went to Rome with her husband, where he lived for many years in the service of his uncle, the Pope. The following year, in March 1478, Caterina gave birth to her first child,P.D. Pasolini: Caterina Sforza, p. 415. [retrieved 17 December 2014]. a daughter named Bianca after both Girolamo's mother, Bianca della Rovere, and Caterina's paternal grandmother, Bianca Maria Visconti. Caterina subsequently gave birth to five more children in the next nine years.The Sforza and the Aragonese ‚Äì Maike's History of Women and the History of Everyday Life ‚Äì kleio.org =In the Vatican court= At the end of the 15th century, Rome was no longer a medieval city, but not yet the important centre of artistic endeavors it would become a few decades later as one of the most important cities of the Renaissance. Upon her arrival in May 1477, Caterina found a city full of cultural fervour, with a desire for renovation. The atmosphere was a mix of intrigue and power, which was pursued without scruples, with material interests far exceeding the spiritual. Caterina was banned by her husband from meddling in politics, but she quickly integrated‚Äîowing to her extroverted and sociable character‚Äîinto aristocratic Roman society. As evidenced by correspondence from that period, Caterina immediately became admired as one of the most beautiful and elegant among noble Roman women. She was welcomed everywhere, treated with great respect and lavishly praised by all of society including the Pope, and she soon transformed from a simple adolescent into a refined and powerful intermediary between the Roman court and other Italian courts, especially Milan.After the assassination of Galeazzo Maria Sforza in 1476, his brother Ludovico Maria Sforza (nicknamed il Moro) plotted to obtain the regency of the Duchy of Milan against Bona of Savoy, mother of the new Duke Gian Galeazzo Sforza, then seven years old. The Duchy was at that time in the hands of Cicco Simonetta, a trusted advisor of Bona. Ludovico and his brother Sforza Maria tried to conquer it by force of arms, but Sforza Maria died (probably poisoned) in Varese Ligure on 29 July 1479, and Ludovico was forced into exile. The following year (1480), however, he was reconciled with Bona and managed to condemn Simonetta to death. Shortly after Ludovico finally forced Bona to leave Milan for the castle of Abbiate (today Abbiategrasso) and assumed the regency in the name of his nephew. Girolamo was given a leading position in the expansion policy of Pope Sixtus IV after the premature death of the Pope's favoured nephew, Cardinal Pietro Riario. His power grew daily, and he soon displayed increasing ruthlessness towards his enemies. In 1480, the Pope, with the objective of attaining a strong domain in the land of Romagna, assigned Girolamo the lordship of Forl√¨, which had remained vacant after it was sequestered from the Ordelaffi family. The new lord tried to earn the favour of the populace by erecting magnificent public buildings and churches, and by abolishing taxes. The lives of Caterina and Girolamo changed abruptly with the death of Sixtus IV on 12 August 1484. Occupation of Castel Sant'Angelo When Pope Sixtus IV died, rebellions and disorder immediately spread through Rome, including looting of his supporters' residences. Girolamo's residence, the Orsini palace in Campo de' Fiori, was stripped of its content and almost destroyed. In this time of anarchy, Caterina, who was in her seventh month of pregnancy, crossed the Tiber on horseback to occupy the rocca (fortress) of Castel Sant'Angelo on behalf of her husband. From this position and with the obedience of the soldiers, Caterina could monitor the Vatican and dictate the conditions for the new conclave. Meanwhile, the disorder in the city increased. A militia accompanied the arrival of the cardinals. The latter did not want to attend the funeral of Sixtus IV and refused to enter into conclave, for fear of coming under the fire of Caterina's artillery. The situation was difficult because only the election of a new Pope would put an end to the violence in Rome. Unsuccessful attempts to persuade her to leave the fortress failed, as she was determined to give it only to the new Pope, saying that Pope Sixtus had bestowed its control to her family. Girolamo and his army occupied a strategic position at that point, yet could not implement an effective solution. The Sacred College asked Girolamo to leave Rome, offering in return the confirmation of his lordship over Imola and Forl√¨, the military post of captain-general of the Church, and 8,000 ducats in compensation for the damages to his property. Girolamo accepted. When Caterina was informed of the decisions taken by her husband, she increased the quota of her soldiers and made preparations for resistance in order to force the cardinals to parley with her. The cardinals again approached Girolamo, who took up a position against his wife. On 25 October 1484, Caterina surrendered the fortress to the Sacred College and left Rome with her family. The Sacred College were then able to meet in conclave to elect the new Pope. =Forl√¨= In Forl√¨, law and order had been maintained by Caterina's uncle Ludovico il Moro Sforza, Duke of Milan. On their arrival, the Riarios learned of the election of Giovanni Battista Cybo, an old opponent, as Pope Innocent VIII. He confirmed Girolamo in his lordships of Imola and Forl√¨ and his appointment as captain-general. That appointment, however, was only nominal; Girolamo had no real control over the papal army and Innocent VIII refused to pay Girolamo for leaving Rome. Despite the loss of income, Girolamo did not reinstate taxes on the people of Forl√¨. This situation lasted until the end of 1485, when the city government completely ran out of money.The higher expenses were constituted by: the costs for the army maintenance, the payment of salaries to officials, those to cope with natural disasters and epidemics, the compensations granted to ambassadors and religious orders, and for popular festivals and hospitality due to important people and their retinues. Girolamo, pressed by a member of the Council of Elders, Nicol√≤ Pansecco, was forced to levy taxes. The taxes were deemed excessive by the population and led to Girolamo's increased unpopularity among all citizens of Forl√¨. The tax increase, which affected mainly the artisan class and landowners, added to the discontent that had previously been limited to the families who had suffered under Girolamo's persecution of those whom he suspected of treachery. His enemies began to conspire against him with a view to making Franceschetto Cybo, the illegitimate son of Pope Innocent, lord of Imola and Forl√¨ in his stead. Girolamo's death After more than a half dozen failed attempts, Girolamo was killed on 14 April 1488 by a conspiracy led by the Orsis, a noble family of Forl√¨. The lord's palace was sacked, while Caterina and her children were made prisoners. The fortress of Ravaldino, a central part of the defensive system of the city, refused to surrender to the Orsis. Caterina offered to attempt to persuade the castellan, Tommaso Feo, to submit. The Orsis believed Caterina because she left her children as hostages, but once inside she let loose a barrage of vulgar threats and promises of vengeance against her former captors. According to one rumour, when they threatened to kill her children, Caterina, standing in the walls of the fortress exposed her genitals and said: \\"\\" ('Do it, if you want to: hang them even in front of me ... here I have what's needed to make others!'). This story, however, is most likely an untrue embellishment. The historical record tells that Caterina, in fact, said she was pregnant. Although her statement that she was pregnant is, by most historians, considered to have been a ruse, it rendered worthless any power the conspirators had in holding her children, Girolamo's legitimate heirs. Shocked by this response, the Orsis did not dare touch the Riario children. With the assistance of her uncle Ludovico il Moro (very interested in securing some influence in the Romagna, to counter the influence of Venice), Caterina defeated her enemies and regained possession of her dominions. Lady of Imola and Forl√¨ On 30 April 1488, Caterina became regent for her eldest son Ottaviano, formally recognised by all the members of the Comune and the head of the magistrates as the new Lord of Forl√¨ that day, but too young to exercise power directly. Caterina's first act as Regent of Forl√¨ was to avenge the death of her husband, according to the custom of the time. She ordered that all those involved in the Orsi conspiracy were to be imprisoned, along with the Pope's governor, Monsignor Savelli, all the pontifical generals, and the castellan of the fortress of Forlimpopoli, and also all women of the Orsis and other families who had assisted in the conspiracy. Soldiers sought out all who had taken part in the conspiracy. Houses owned by those imprisoned were razed while their valuables were distributed to the poor. On 30 July news came that Pope Innocent VIII had given Ottaviano Riario the official investiture of his state \\"until his line ended\\". In the meantime, Forl√¨ was visited by Cardinal Raffaele Riario, officially to protect the orphan children of his late cousin Girolamo but actually, to oversee the government of Caterina. The young Countess personally dealt with all issues concerning the government of her city-state, both public and private. To consolidate her power, she exchanged gifts with the lords of neighbouring states and involved herself in marriage negotiations for her children. She decreased taxes by reducing some and eliminating others, and sharply controlled her realm's spending. Caterina dealt directly with the training of her militia in the use of weapons and horses. It was her intention that her cities and towns be orderly and peaceful, and she expected her subjects to appreciate these efforts. The states of Forl√¨ and Imola were smaller than the great Italian states but, due to their geographical position, had a considerable strategic importance on the political affairs. In those years there were significant events that changed the geopolitical situation of Italy. Lorenzo il Magnifico, whose shrewd policy had curbed claims and rivalries of the various Italian states, died on 8 April 1492. Pope Innocent VIII also died on 25 July of that year, and was replaced by Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, who took the name of Pope Alexander VI. His election seemed to strengthen Caterina's rule. While she and her husband had lived in Rome, the Cardinal had often been a guest at their home, and he was godfather to Ottaviano. These events directly threatened the stability and peace in Italy. With the death of Lorenzo there came about friction between the Duchy of Milan and the Kingdom of Naples,Ludovico il Moro felt threatened by King Ferdinand I of Naples (whose father had been appointed the successor of the Duchy of Milan by the last Visconti ruler, Filippo Maria), and his granddaughter, Isabella, wife of Gian Galeazzo Sforza, the official Duke of Milan, but who was virtually replaced in government by his uncle Ludovico. Isabella did not accept her husband's condition, who was under the tutelage of his uncle. This family situation had political importance and the King of Naples was determined to defend the prestige of his granddaughter and publicly declared that he would cast out the usurper Ludovico from the Ducal throne. leading up to the crisis of September 1494, when, incited by Ludovico il Moro, King Charles VIII of France entered into Italy to claim Naples as the Anjou heir. At first Pope Alexander VI also gave his support to Charles's claim, leading to four years of war. During the conflict between Naples and Milan, Caterina, who knew that she was placed in a strategic position of passage for anyone who wanted to go to the south, tried to remain neutral. She knew Forl√¨ was exposed to invasion, located in a strategic position on the way to Rome. On one side, her uncle Ludovico had allied with Charles VIII; on the other side, Pope Alexander VI now opposed France's ambitions in Italy, and her brother-in-law, Cardinal Riario, argued in favour of the incumbent King Ferdinand II.King Ferdinand I of Naples had died in January 1494 and was succeeded by his son Alfonso II, who abdicated almost immediately in favour of his son Ferdinand II. Caterina chose to join Naples and the Pope, and prepared the defence of Imola and Forl√¨ against the French. Betrayed by her Neapolitan allies, who at the first French attack did not help her, Caterina changed sides and submitted to Charles VIII, giving his army via libera (\\"free passage\\") to Naples; however, he preferred to avoid the Romagna and cross the Apennines, following the road of the Cisa pass. Naples was conquered by the French army in only 13 days. This frightened the Italian principalities, and they formed the League of Venice against Charles VIII. The League defeated the French King at the Fornovo and he was forced to retreat to France. This time, Caterina managed to remain neutral. By not participating in the expulsion of the French, she maintained the support of both her uncle Ludovico in Milan (now legitimate Duke of MilanDuring these events had died Gian Galeazzo Sforza, Caterina's brother. His uncle Ludovico eliminated from the succession the son of Gian Galeazzo, the rightful heir, and proclaimed himself Duke of Milan by the citizens, who did not oppose him.) and also that of the Pope. Second marriage Two months after the death of Girolamo, a rumour was spread that Caterina was close to marrying Antonio Maria Ordelaffi, who had started to court her. This marriage would end the claims of the Ordelaffi family on the city of Forl√¨. Antonio Maria, feeling confident, wrote to the Duke of Ferrara that the Countess promised to marry him. When Caterina saw how things stood, she imprisoned those who had spread the false news. These promises were addressed by the Senate in Venice, which summoned Antonio Maria to Friuli, where he remained confined for ten years. Coat of Arms of Giacomo Feo BAron of France Portrait of Giacomo Feo (the tallest man standing on the right), Melozzo da Forl√¨ In point of fact, Caterina had fallen in love with Giacomo Feo, the brother of Tommaso Feo, the castellan who had remained faithful to her after the assassination of her husband. Caterina married him in 1488, but secretly, to avoid losing custody of her children and the regency of her dominions. All the contemporary chronicles reported that Caterina was madly in love with the young Giacomo. It was feared that she could strip her son Ottaviano of his future lordship, in order to give it to her lover and secret husband. Giacomo was appointed castellan of the fortress of Ravaldino in place of his brother, and was awarded with an order of chivalry from Ludovico il Moro. In April 1489, Caterina gave birth to Giacomo's son, Bernardino, later called Carlo in honour of King Charles VIII, who had made Giacomo a baron of France. Also, she had replaced the castellans of the fortresses of her dominions with her closest relatives: the fortress of Imola was given to Gian Piero Landriani, her stepfather, and the fortress of Forlimpopoli to Piero Landriani, her half-brother, while Tommaso Feo was married to Bianca Landriani, Caterina's half-sister. At Tossignano, a conspiracy was formed to seize the fortress in the name of Ottaviano, and murder both Giacomo and Caterina. The Countess discovered the plot and imprisoned or executed those who were involved. Immediately after this conspiracy was foiled, another plot was organised by Antonio Maria Ordelaffi, who had never become resigned to the loss of Forl√≠, but this also failed. Giacomo's power increased, and with his cruelty and insolence he incurred the hatred of all, including Caterina's children. On one occasion, in full view of the public, he slapped Ottaviano (the rightful Lord of Forl√¨), but nobody had the courage to defend the boy. After this incident, adherents of Ottaviano decided to liberate the city from the domination of Giacomo Feo. Gian Antonio Ghetti and some of Caterina's own children formed a conspiracy. On the evening of 27 August 1495, Caterina, Giacomo Feo and their entourage were returning from a hunt. Caterina, her daughter Bianca Riario and some of her ladies-in-waiting rode in a carriage, followed on horseback by Giacomo, Ottaviano and his brother Cesare and many staffieri and soldiers. Agents of the conspiracy attacked and mortally wounded Giacomo. The same day, Ghetti went to Caterina, thinking that she had secretly given the order to kill Giacomo. Caterina was unaware of the plot, and her revenge was terrible. When her first husband was murdered, she avenged his death according to the justice of the time; now she reacted with vindictive fury. Caterina was not satisfied with mere executions: their deaths had to be among the most cruel and painful. Thirty-eight people were executed for the crime - including Ghetti and his wife and children - and many others imprisoned or exiled.Leone Cobelli, who witnessed the events, recorded these numbers in his book, Cronache Forlivesi.Caterina's fury blinded her to the politics that had inspired the plot. It had involved almost all the supporters of Ottaviano Riario, who were convinced that Caterina had given her tacit consent to the killing of the man who was considered the \\"usurper\\" of the state's rightful ruler. They had wanted to uphold the power of the Riario family. As a result of the massacre which followed the assassination of Giacomo Feo, Caterina lost, forever, the good will of her people. Third marriage In 1496, the ambassador of the Republic of Florence, Giovanni de' Medici il Popolano, paid a visit to Caterina. The second son of Pierfrancesco il Vecchio, he belonged to a collateral branch of the Medici family. Along with his older brother Lorenzo, he had been sent into exile because of his open hostility toward their cousin Piero, who succeeded his father Lorenzo il Magnifico in the government of Florence. In 1494, when Charles VIII invaded Italy, Piero was forced to sign a treaty which allowed the French army to move freely into the Kingdom of Naples. The people of Florence were liberated, deposed Piero and proclaimed a Republic. Giovanni and his brother were able to return to their homeland. They renounced the Medici surname and took the name of \\"Popolano\\". The Florentine government appointed Giovanni as ambassador to Forl√¨. Shortly after coming to Forl√¨, Giovanni and his entourage were housed in the apartments adjacent to Caterina's in the fortress of Ravaldino.Fortress where Caterina had made her official residence immediately after the death of Girolamo Riario. The rumours of a possible marriage between Giovanni and Caterina and that Ottaviano Riario accepted the post of Condottiero from Florence threatened by the Venetians,The Republic of Florence was preparing to defend itself from the Republic of Venice, which aimed to control the city of Pisa, made independent from Florence by Charles VIII, and to restore the rule of the Medici. alarmed all the lords of the League and the Duke of Milan. Giovanni il Popolano Portrait of Giovanni delle Bande Nere by Gian Paolo Pace Cosimo I de' Medici. Caterina could not hide her wedding plans and her own feelings from her uncle Ludovico; she truly fell in love with the handsome, charming, and intelligent Giovanni.Caterina Sforza - Duchess of Forl√¨ and Imola Biography in Womenwholead.org The situation differed from the previous one as this time Caterina had the approval of her children and she also obtained the consent of her uncle. The marriage of two people from such powerful families, however, was likely to arouse opposition, so they were wed in secret in September 1497. In April 1498, Caterina bore Giovanni a son, the last of her children. The child was baptised as Ludovico after his mother's uncle, the Duke of Milan, but later he became known by the name Giovanni delle Bande Nere. Meanwhile, affairs between Florence and Venice were getting worse and Caterina, who occupied the main route between the two cities, prepared her defences. She sent a contingent of knights to the aid of Florence, led by Giovanni and her eldest son, Ottaviano Riario, accompanied by men she had trained herself. Giovanni became seriously ill and was compelled to leave the battlefield and return to Forl√¨. There, despite treatment, his condition deteriorated and he was transferred to Santa Maria in Bagno, where he hoped for a miraculous recovery. On 14 September 1498, Giovanni died in the presence of Caterina, who had been summoned urgently to attend him. Giovanni's death left Caterina alone to face the Borgias. Defence against Venice After having returned to Forl√¨ in order to make preparations for the defence of her states, Caterina was occupied by military concerns, especially logistics. Training the militia was executed by the Countess in person. To find additional money and troops, she wrote to her uncle Ludovico, the Republic of Florence and the neighbouring states who were her allies. Only the Dukes of Milan and Mantua sent a small contingent of soldiers to aid her. After an initial attack by the Venetians, which inflicted severe destruction, Caterina's army managed to outmanoeuvre them. Afterwards, the war continued with minor skirmishes until the Venetians were able to circumvent Forl√¨ to reach Florence by another route. Because of this staunch defence, Caterina Sforza gained the nickname of \\"\\" ('The Tiger'). =Capture by Cesare Borgia= In the meantime, Louis XII had succeeded to the French throne. Louis claimed the rights both to the Duchy of Milan as a grandson of Valentina Visconti, and to the Kingdom of Naples as heir to the House of Anjou. Before starting his campaign in Italy, Louis XII secured an alliance with Savoy, the Republic of Venice and Pope Alexander VI. In the summer of 1499, he came to Italy with a formidable army; without having to fight a single battle, he occupied Piedmont, as well as Genoa and Cremona. On 6 October, he settled in Milan, which had been abandoned the previous month by Duke Ludovico, who fled to the Tyrol under the protection of his nephew-by-marriage Emperor Maximilian I.Maximilian I had married in 1494 to Bianca Maria Sforza, daughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza and Bona of Savoy, thus she was the niece of Ludovico il Moro. Alexander VI allied himself with Louis XII in return for the King's support in establishing Alexander's son Cesare Borgia, the Duke of Valentinois, as ruler in Romagna. Alexander issued a Papal Bull on 9 March 1499 to invalidate the investiture of the feudal lords,Faenza, Imola, Forl√¨, Pesaro, Urbino and Camerino. including Caterina. When the French army left Milan with Cesare to begin the conquest of Romagna, Ludovico il Moro regained the Duchy with the help of the Austrians. Caterina sought relief from Florence against the approaching French army, but Florence was threatened by the Pope, so she was left alone to defend herself. She immediately began to recruit and train many soldiers and began to store weapons, ammunition and food. She reinforced the defences, especially that of Ravaldino where she resided and which was already considered impenetrable. She also sent her children to Florence. On 24 November, Cesare Borgia arrived in Imola. The city gates were opened by the inhabitants, and he was able to take possession, after having conquered the fortress where the castellan Dionigi Naldi of Brisighella had resisted for several days. After seeing what had happened there, Caterina asked the people of Forl√¨ if they also wanted to capitulate to Borgia, or if they wanted to be defended and endure the resulting siege. Because the people hesitated in answering, Caterina absolved the citizens of Forl√¨ of their oath of fealty, and sealed herself in Ravaldino. On 19 December, the Duke of Valentinois also took possession of Forl√¨ and began the siege of the fortress. Caterina repeatedly refused all offers of peace, from Cesare and from Cardinal Riario. In response, Cesare offered 10,000 ducats for her, dead or alive. Caterina tried to capture Cesare when he came near the fortress to talk to her, but the attempt failed. For several days the artillery of both factions engaged in a mutual bombardment: Caterina's cannon inflicted heavy losses on the French army, but the French artillery damaged the defences of the main fortress. What was destroyed during the day was rebuilt during the night. Caterina's solitary resistance was admired throughout all Italy; Niccol√≤ MachiavelliNiccolo Machiavelli had several meetings with Caterina in July of 1499 as ambassador of Florence. reports that many songs and epigrams were composed in her honour. All were lost except that of Marsilio Compagnon. As time passed without decisive results, Cesare changed his tactics. His troops bombarded the walls of the fortress continuously, even at night.Contrary to the customs of war. After six days, they opened two breaches in the walls. On 12 January 1500, his forces stormed the fortress. The bloody battle was quick and decisive, and Caterina continued to resist, fighting with weapons in hand until she was taken prisoner. Among the gentlemen who were caught together with her, was also her secretary, Marcantonio Baldraccani. Immediately she surrendered herself to Antoine Bissey (the bailli of Dijon) as a prisoner of the French, as she knew there was a law that prevented French forces from holding women as prisoners of war. According to Machiavelli, the defense operations were misdirected by Giovanni da Casale: \\"The poorly built fortress and the scant prudence of the defender, therefore, brought disgrace to the magnanimous enterprise of the Countess ...\\". =Rome= Cesare obtained custody of Caterina from the French general, Yves d'All√®gre, promising that he would treat her not as a prisoner but as a guest. Caterina and her entourage were therefore forced to go with the army that was preparing to conquer Pesaro. The conquest had to be postponed because on 5 February Ludovico il Moro returned to Milan,On 10 April Ludovico il Moro, betrayed by his mercenary troops, was captured and then imprisoned in the Ch√¢teau de Loches, France, where he died in 1508. forcing French troops to turn back. Cesare departed alone with the Papal army for Rome, where he took Caterina. In Rome, she was held in the Belvedere Palace. Towards the end of March, Caterina tried to escape but she was discovered and immediately imprisoned at Castel Sant'Angelo. In the prison of Castel Sant'Angelo To justify Caterina's imprisonment, Pope Alexander VI accused her of trying to kill him in November 1499 with letters impregnated with poison, as a response to the Papal bull which had deprived the countess of her fiefdoms. Even today it is not known if the accusation was founded or not. Machiavelli believed that Caterina had tried to poison the Pope, while other historians, such as Jacob Burckhardt and Ferdinand Gregorovius, are not certain. An inconclusive and unfinished trial took place, and Caterina remained imprisoned until 30 June 1501, when she was released by Yves d'All√®gre, who had come to Rome with the army of Louis XII for the conquest of the Kingdom of Naples. Alexander VI alleged that Caterina signed documents renouncing all of her fiefs, because in the meantime his son Cesare, with the acquisition of Pesaro, Rimini and Faenza, was appointed Duke of Romagna. After a brief stay in the residence of Cardinal Riario, Caterina embarked from Livorno to Florence, Caterina had received Florentine citizenship by the Republic of Florence at the time when Giovanni il Popolano was ambassador to Forl√¨. where her children were waiting for her. =Florence= In Florence, Caterina lived in the villas which had belonged to her third husband Giovanni de' Medici, often staying at the Villa Medici di Castello. Soon, she complained of being mistreated and living in a straitened financial situation. For many years she conducted a legal battle against her brother-in-law Lorenzo de' Medici for the custody of her son Giovanni, who was entrusted to him during her detention. In 1504, her son was finally returned to her, because the judge recognized that her confinement as a prisoner of war was not comparable to the detention of a criminal. With the death of Pope Alexander VI on 18 August 1503, Cesare Borgia lost all his power. This reopened the possibility of restoring to power all the old feudal lords of the Romagna who had been deposed. Caterina lost no time in sending letters to adherents, and pleaded her case to Pope Julius IIJulius II was succeeded on the Papal throne after the twenty-six days pontificate of Pope Pius III. in her own name and that of her son Ottaviano Riario. The new Pope was favourable to restoring the lordships of Imola and Forl√¨ to the Riarios, but the populace of both cities declared that a majority of the people opposed the return of the Countess, so that the domain passed instead to Antonio Maria Ordelaffi on 22 October 1503. After having lost her last chance to return to her former power, Caterina spent the last years of her life dedicated to her children, in particular to her youngest son Giovanni (her favourite and the most like her in personality and character). She also conducted a series of experiments in alchemy, the results of which were recorded in a manuscript titled \\"Gli Experimenti de la Ex.ma S.r Caterina da Furlj Matre de lo inllux.mo S.r Giouanni de Medici\\", or \\"Gli Experimenti\\". The book, dating back to 1500, contains a total of 454 recipes, roughly 66 of which are cosmetic related, 358 medicinal, and 38 alchemical. Her experimental activities situate her at the origins of a Medici interest that stretched well into the seventeenth century. Death and burial In April 1509 Caterina was stricken by a severe case of pneumonia. She appeared to have recovered, but had a relapse of the disease, after which she made her will and arranged her burial. At the age of forty-six years, \\"The Tiger of Forl√¨\\", who had \\"frightened all of Romagna\\", died on 28 May 1509. Her body was placed in a small tomb in the chapel of Le Murate in Florence, a convent of nuns whom Caterina had befriended during her time in that city,Niccolini, Sister Giustina.

They had a daughter, Giulia, and a son, Giulio (d. 1565). Their descendants, who later received a ducal title, became extinct in the male line with Francesco Maria Riario della Rovere in 1676. # Francesco, called \\"Sforzino\\" (b.

Mantua, 30 November 1526), renamed Giovanni after the death of his father, one of the greatest condottieri of his time and a national hero, known as \\"Giovanni delle Bande Nere\\". He married Maria Salviati (17 July 1499 ‚Äì 29 December 1543), the daughter of Jacopo Salviati and Lucrezia di Lorenzo de' Medici. Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany (1519‚Äì1574) was their son. In June 1537, 28 years after Caterina's death, her grandson Cosimo de' Medici, the only son of her own son Giovanni, became the Duke of Florence and in 1569, the Grand Duke of Tuscany. Through him, Caterina was the direct ancestress of the later Grand Dukes of Tuscany, the Dukes of Modena and Reggio, and the Kings of Spain and France. Legacy In her book The Warrior Queens: Boadicea's Chariot, British historian Antonia Fraser presents Caterina Sforza as a contrasting figure to her contemporary Isabella I of Castile. Fraser points out that whilst the murders ordered by Caterina were no worse than the massacres ordered by Isabella, historians have been much harsher in their judgment of the former. Fraser accounts for this by pointing out that Isabella's actions were sanctioned by the Church, as they were carried out in the name of Catholicism, whilst Caterina's were motivated by the personal, secular desire to preserve her property and rights.

The incident of her having shown her genitalia in regaining the fortress of Ravaldino was recounted at some length by him in his Discourses on Livy, and his Florentine Histories, while being only briefly mentioned in his Prince. Elizabeth Lev wrote on the matter in her biography of Caterina Sforza, The Tigress of Forli. Lev took the position that Machiavelli's account on the matter, being quite vulgar, may in fact have been more a reflection of his own dislike of Caterina. Indeed, Machiavelli had met the countess as a young diplomat and had not fared well. Various historical records tells us instead that Caterina claimed that even if they killed their children, she had everything that was needed to make another one and to prove that, she lifted up her skirts and showed her genitalia, thereby neutralising the conspirators' power in holding her children hostage. See also House of Sforza References Bibliography  Machiavelli: The Discourses, English translation by Fr Leslie J. Walker, S.J. (1929).

It is currently maintained by Chet Ramey as part of the GNU Project. It allows users to move the text cursor, search the command history, control a kill ring (a more flexible version of a copy/paste clipboard) and use tab completion on a text terminal. As a cross-platform library, readline allows applications on various systems to exhibit identical line-editing behavior.  Editing modes  Readline supports both Emacs and vi editing modes, which determine how keyboard input is interpreted as editor commands. See Editor war#Differences between vi and Emacs. =Emacs keyboard shortcuts= Emacs editing mode key bindings are taken from the text editor Emacs. On some systems, must be used instead of , because the shortcut conflicts with another shortcut.

Choice of the GPL as GNU Readline's license GNU Readline is notable for being a free software library which is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Free software libraries are far more often licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), for example, the GNU C Library, GNU gettext and FLTK. A developer of an application who chooses to link to an LGPL licensed library can use any license for the application. But linking to a GPL licensed library such as Readline requires the entire combined resulting application to be licensed under the GPL when distributed, to comply with section 5 of the GPL. This licensing was chosen by the FSF on the hopes that it would encourage software to switch to the GPL. An important example of an application changing its licensing to comply with the copyleft conditions of GNU Readline is CLISP, an implementation of Common Lisp. Originally released in 1987, it changed to the GPL license in 1992, after an email exchange between one of CLISP's original authors, Bruno Haible, and Richard Stallman, in which Stallman argued that the linking of readline in CLISP meant that Haible was required to re- license CLISP under the GPL if he wished to distribute the implementation of CLISP which used readline. Another response has been to not use this in some projects, making text input use the primitive Unix terminal driver for editing. = Alternative libraries = Alternative libraries have been created with other licenses so they can be used by software projects which want to implement command line editing functionality, but be released with a non-GPL license. * Many BSD systems have a BSD-licensed libedit. MariaDB and PHP allow for the user to select at build time whether to link with GNU Readline or with libedit. macOS's libreadline is actually a shim over libedit, an arrangement known as editline. * linenoise is a tiny C library that provides line editing functions. * Haskeline is a readline-like library for Haskell.

Article about Major Publishers of Pakistan on the All Pakistan Newspapers Society website Retrieved 4 April 2018 The older organization, Pakistan Newspapers Society was established primarily due to the efforts of Hameed Nizami, Altaf Husain, and Hamid Mahmood. It functioned for a number of years but could not receive much support or recognition either from the publishers or the advertising agencies. Other smaller publishers' organizations also functioned, at the same time, in East Pakistan and Karachi. In the year 1953, All Pakistan Newspapers Society was formed by merging the smaller existing groups of publishers. The headquarters were established in Karachi, from where it still continues to operate in 2018. The APNS handles problems between its member publications and the provincial or federal governments relating to advertisements, clearance of dues, taxes and duties and newsprint. It sets rules of conduct for member publications and advertising agencies. This gives the Society a mechanism of streamlining advertisements and a clearance system protecting the collective interests of its member publications, advertising agencies, and advertisers. The Society also works to develop the science and art of journalism and newspaper industry. In 1981, the APNS instituted advertising awards in various categories. Subsequently, the Journalist Awards were launched in 1982. The awards ceremonies have been held regularly since 1981. Profile of All Pakistan Newspapers Society on Civil Services of Pakistan Forum website Retrieved 4 April 2018 The APNS grew to include publications from small towns and newspapers in regional languages. Between 1971 and 2003, the number of member publications in the Society rose from 41 to 262. Along with organizations of editors and journalists, the Society worked against the Press and Publications Ordinance passed by Ayub Khan in 1960 until it was finally repealed in 1988. In 1999, the APNS prepared a set of press laws including the Draft for the formation of Press Council in Pakistan, Registration of Printing Presses, Newspapers Ordinance and a draft for a Freedom of Information Act. After thorough discussions among the All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS) people, Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors (CPNE) and the Ministry of Information, Government of Pakistan, the drafts on the Press Council and the Registration of Presses and Newspapers were finalized and enacted in 2002. After 2002, the member publications are trying to adopt modern techniques, facilities, and trained manpower in all fields. In 2018, All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS) asked the Supreme Court of Pakistan to consider Pakistani print media's problems. This action was prompted by the recently expressed fear in the country and reports circulating in the news media that government advertisements in the print media might be stopped or limited.

He was the first Italian-Canadian to serve as a cabinet minister in Ontario. Background Kerrio's grandfather, also named Vincent, emigrated from Italy to Canada at the start of the twentieth century. Kerrio was born in Niagara Falls and educated at Niagara Falls Collegiate Vocational Institute (NFCVI). Kerrio began working in the family business, then Kerrio Welding Works, in the 1930s. The company became Kerrio and Germano Construction and later Kerrio Construction, and the younger Kerrio its president. He was also the president of the Niagara Falls Curling Club. Kerrio and his wife Rose had two sons, Vincent Anthony and Michael. Vincent Anthony succeeded his father in the family business and became a member of Niagara Falls City Council. Politics He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1975 provincial election, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative John Clement by 172 votes in the Niagara Falls riding. He was re-elected by greater margins in the elections of 1977 and 1981. The Ontario Liberal Party, which had been out of office since 1943, formed a minority government after the 1985 provincial election. Kerrio, easily returned in Niagara Falls, was appointed Minister of Natural Resources and Minister of Energy on June 26, 1985. He was retained in the former portfolio after the 1987 provincial election. In 1988, Kerrio prohibited mineral exploration and mining activities in Ontario provincial parks. He banned large-scale water exports from Ontario in 1989. He also oversaw the reintroduction of the wild turkey to Ontario. In 1988, Kerrio approved the expansion of the Red Squirrel logging road, directly through Anishnabe territory in Temagami, Ontario, Canada. This prompted a series of roadblocks by the Teme-Augama Anishnabai and by environmentalists in 1988-1989. Kerrio was a prominent supporter of the \\"Beck 3\\" plan to build a third hydroelectric generating station on the Niagara River. Kerrio left cabinet on August 2, 1989, and did not run for re-election in 1990. =Cabinet positions= Later life Kerrio remained a leading figure in Niagara Falls's Italian community.

Early life  Gunn was born in Orphir on the Orkney Islands off the north coast of Scotland, near the town of Kirkwall. She was the daughter of John Gunn and Margaret Leask. Little is known of her early life until the summer of 1806, when, under the pseudonym John Fubbister, she entered into a contract with the HBC as a labourer for three years at ¬£8 per year. Although her motivations for doing so are uncertain, tradition holds that she may have been following a lover who had cast her aside. Her brother George was also employed by the HBC, and it is also possible that she was enticed to join by his stories of adventure. Modern commentators point out that the modest HBC salary was nevertheless more than Gunn could have earned as a woman in Orkney at that time. Official HBC policy forbade employment of European women, although First Nation women were employed as cooks and domestic servants in company outposts.  Discovery and return to Scotland  In the Autumn of 1807 Gunn was assigned to a brigade tasked with provisioning more distant outposts, and travelled with them to Martin Falls and then on to the HBC outpost on the Red River at Pembina in modern North Dakota, a distance of more than . Once again, Gunn worked unsuspected alongside the men. The pretence was maintained until the morning of 29 December 1807, when to general astonishment, Gunn gave birth to a baby boy at the home of Alexander Henry the younger, the chief of the North West Company's Pembina post. According to Henry's journal: The father of the baby was reportedly John Scarth, an HBC employee who had been in frequent contact with Gunn. After being found out, Gunn became known as Mary Fubbister, and in early 1808 was ordered to return to Albany, and upon her arrival was no longer allowed to work with the men, but rather offered work as a washerwoman. Against her wishes, Gunn and her child were returned to Scotland on the Prince of Wales on 20 September 1809. There, she lived in poverty, working as a stocking and mitten maker until her death.  Legacy  Isobel Gunn's life has subsequently become the basis for a work of historical fiction by author Audrey Thomas, a documentary poem entitled The Ballad of Isabel Gunn by Stephen Scobie, and the subject of a documentary film entitled The Orkney Lad: The Story of Isabel Gunn, directed by filmmaker Anne Wheeler. Canadian folk singer Eileen McGann also paid tribute with her ballad 'Isabella Gunn'.  See also Marie-Anne Gaboury, the first woman of European descent to permanently settle in Rupert's Land.

Aside from producing content for release on YouTube, it was also a former humor website owned by InterActiveCorp (IAC) until January 2020 when IAC withdrew funding and the website shut down. Since then, CollegeHumor has continued to release content on YouTube and on its streaming service, Dropout. The site featured daily original humor videos and articles created by its in-house writing and production team, in addition to user-submitted videos, pictures, articles and links. It was created by Josh Abramson and Ricky Van Veen in 1999. CollegeHumor is operated by CH Media, which also operates Dorkly.com and Dropout.tv in addition to CollegeHumor, and formerly operated Drawfee.com. CH Media is also a partner of the website BustedTees, an online clothing website. Many of its staff also operated the sister website Dorkly, centering on fandoms and video game parodies in the vein of CollegeHumor before the site ceased publication of new articles in January 2019. Like CollegeHumor, despite the website shutting down, Dorkly continues to release new original content on YouTube, now in collaboration with Lowbrow Studios. History The site was created in December 1999 by Josh Abramson and Ricky Van Veen, with help from web developer Jake Lodwick. Abramson and Van Veen were high school friends from Baltimore, Maryland. The site traffic reached approximately 30,000 monthly American users. Abramson said in an interview that they wanted to start \\"an advertisement-based business because at the time the advertising market was pretty hot and we'd seen other people develop Web sites that were popular making a lot of money.\\" Their aim was to create a humor site that would appeal to the advertiser-friendly college-aged demographic. CollegeHumor, along with its parent company, Connected Ventures, was acquired by Barry Diller's IAC in August 2006. CollegeHumor has become known for its original comedy content. The site has been nominated for the Webby Award in the humor category, and many of their individual videos have been nominated for and/or won Webby Awards. Recent winners include \\"Pixar Intro Parody\\" for Best Animation, \\"Web Site Story\\" for Best Individual Short or Episode, and Jake and Amir for Best Series. Their shorts \\"Awkward Rap\\" and \\"Hand Vagina\\" were nominated for the Webby Award for Best Comedy: Individual Short or Episode in 2008 and 2009 with other nominees and winners since. In 2014, CollegeHumor was listed on New Media Rockstars Top 100 Channels, ranked at number 76. On September 26, 2018, CollegeHumor launched Dropout, a subscription service that includes uncensored and original video series, animations, and other forms of media including comics and fictionalized chat conversations. On January 23, 2019, CollegeHumor announced on the Dorkly homepage that they would be ceasing the publication of new articles and comics on the Dorkly site in favor of shifting to other platforms for new material, citing increased costs of the website and the decline of ad based revenue for publications such as Dorkly. On January 8, 2020, it was announced that IAC was selling CollegeHumor to its Chief Creative Officer, Sam Reich, resulting in the job loss of nearly all employees and staff. However Sam Reich later clarified that the company would keep a skeleton crew of mostly technical staff in employment in order to continue releasing pre-recorded CollegeHumor content on its streaming platform Dropout for at least the next 6 months. The only creative left on the payroll was Brennan Lee Mulligan, DM of the Dimension 20 show. In July 2020, a Dropout.tv newsletter noted that production is beginning on new seasons of various Dropout shows.

CH Originals CH Originals is CollegeHumor's original comedy video section, featuring sketches and short films written and produced by the CollegeHumor staff. The site releases over ten new videos per week. CH Originals videos include sketch comedy, film and television parodies, animation, and music videos. In addition to stand-alone viral comedy shorts or \\"one-offs\\", which are usually shot on location and feature hired actors, CH Originals also produces a number of series‚Äînotably \\"Hardly Working\\", \\"Jake and Amir\\", and \\"Nerd Alert\\"‚Äîwhich are shot in the CH office and star the CH staff members themselves.

Dimension 20  Dimension 20 is a tabletop role-playing game show starring Brennan Lee Mulligan as the DM. The games use Dungeons & Dragons 5e, although each season takes place in a different campaign setting. Dimension 20 also covers supplementary shows that are talk focused discussion shows about elements of role-playing (Adventure Academy) or specifics about the first season (Dimension 20 Fantasy High Extra Credit). Dimension 20 usually features its main cast as players (Ally Beardsley, Emily Axford, Lou Wilson, Brian Murphy, Zac Oyama, and Siobhan Thompson), but for certain seasons nicknamed ‚Äúside quests,‚Äù the show invites guests to play for that season. As of May 2020, Dimension 20 has two side quests: ‚ÄúEscape from the Bloodkeep‚Äù (featuring Matthew Mercer of ‚ÄúCritical Role‚Äù) and ‚ÄúTiny Heist‚Äù (featuring the cast of The Adventure Zone). The first season, titled ‚ÄúFantasy High,‚Äù is set in the town of Elmville ‚Äî an odd, anachronistic town resembling a high fantasy John Hughes movie. The cast of players includes Ally Beardsley, Emily Axford, Lou Wilson, Brian Murphy, Zac Oyama, and Siobhan Thompson, who collectively became the ‚Äúmain cast‚Äù of Dimension 20. Their group of characters, known as ‚ÄúThe Bad Kids,‚Äù attend the Aguefort Adventuring Academy, a fictional high school designed to teach people how to become adventurers. The strong fan response for this first season resulted in Fantasy High being renewed for a fully live season, known as Fantasy High Live:Sophomore Year. Episodes of Fantasy High Live: Sophomore Year were streamed live on Twitch, as opposed to pre-recorded, edited, and uploaded to YouTube. The season concluded with a two part finale titled ‚ÄúSpring Break! I Believe in You!‚Äù Part one of the finale was live-streamed on April 1, 2020, and lasted approximately 3 hours. The second part of the finale was live-streamed on April 3, 2020 and lasted approximately 5 hours. Through social media, the Dimension 20 team confirmed that they have plans to continue the story of ‚ÄúThe Bad Kids‚Äù with a third season in the Fantasy High series. The second season of Dimension 20, titled ‚ÄúEscape from the Bloodkeep,‚Äù was the show's first ‚Äúside quest‚Äù season. For this campaign, Dimension 20 brought in a new cast of players (including Matt Mercer of ‚ÄúCritical Role‚Äù) to play a group of ‚Äúvile villains‚Äù in a parody of Lord of the Rings. Throughout the course of the season, the characters try to hide the death of their Sauron-esque leader from the rest of his evil armies. The third season, titled ‚ÄúThe Unsleeping City‚Äù, is a modern-day campaign set in a magical version of New York. This season featured the main cast as a group of people trying to protect New York residents from knowing about the underlying magic in their city. The fourth season, titled ‚ÄúTiny Heist‚Äù, focused on a set of 'tiny people' (i.e., bugs, living toys, etc.) and their attempts to pull off a successful heist. Tiny Heist is Dimension 20's second ‚Äúside quest‚Äù season, and introduced the cast of The Adventure Zone as guest players alongside CollegeHumor's Jessica Ross and Lily Du. A fifth season, titled ‚ÄúA Crown of Candy‚Äù, began on April 8, 2020. The season follows the royal family of the Candy Land-inspired kingdom of Candia and features Dimension 20's main cast.

Historical background  He was presumably king of a stronger and more unified Denmark that rose at the end of the 7th century. Ongendus' reign probably followed the rise of a strong kingdom in central Jutland which lasted from about 200 to 600 CE, and from 400 also included Kent and Isle of Wight. Given the time we must assume that Ongendus was involved with the construction of the Danevirke, as it was under construction at this time. He may have founded Ribe, and reinforced Danevirke in 737.  Literal knowledge  About 710, Saint Willibrord visited the Danes whilst Ongendus was ruling and returned with 30 boys to instruct in missionary work. No further details are given about Ongendus, other than that he was \\"more savage than any beast and harder than stone\\"  the ideal of man in the Viking Age. Against Willibrord's account, however, one should also consider that he was apparently well received, could travel in peace through Ongendus' realm and was allowed to return with his potential disciples, so the savagery of Ongendus may well be overstated. It may just have been the obligatory classification of any heathen ruler. Further readingAlcuin's Life of St. Willibrord, translated in C. H.

A. Russell is the name of an American military installation near Marfa, Texas, that was active from 1911 to 1946. Its namesake is David Allen Russell, a Civil War general killed at the Battle of Opequon, September 19, 1864. It was established in 1911 as Camp Albert, a base for cavalry and air reconnaissance units sent to protect West Texas from Mexican bandits after the Pancho Villa raid. The base was expanded and renamed Camp Marfa during World War I. In the interwar years, the base became the headquarters for the Marfa Command, which replaced the Big Bend District. In 1924, a patrol called the Mounted Watchmen was established to deter persons from crossing the Rio Grande into the United States. In 1930, the base was renamed Fort D. A. Russell. The name had been used on a previous military base in Wyoming; the name became available when that post was renamed Fort Francis E. Warren. The base was briefly abandoned during the Great Depression. On January 2, 1933, the Army closed the post, and reactivated it in 1935 as the home base of the 77th Field Artillery. During World War II, the post was expanded and used as an air base, a base for a WAC unit, a training facility for chemical mortar battalions, and a base for troops guarding the U.S.-Mexican border. The Marfa Army Airfield was constructed nearby and was used as pilot training facility. German prisoners of war were also housed in a POW camp on the base. In 1945, shortly after the end of World War II, the fort was closed during America's demobilization. On October 23, 1946, the base was transferred to the Corps of Engineers. The Texas National Guard assumed control of the base shortly afterward. In 1949, most of the base's land was divided up and sold to local citizens. In the late 1970s, under the auspices of the Dia Art Foundation, the artist Donald Judd acquired the former fort and began converting the buildings to house permanent large-scale art installations. Originally conceived to include works by Judd, John Chamberlain, and Dan Flavin, the museum was later expanded to include works by Carl Andre, Ingolfur Arnarrson, Ilya Kabakov, Roni Horn, Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, David Rabinowitch, and John Wesley. Judd's museum opened to the public in 1986 as the Chinati Foundation. Building 98, Marfa, Texas, 2012 Located at Fort David A. Russell's central complex is Building 98, a project of the International Woman's Foundation and the home of the iconic World War II German POW murals. The Murals were completed in 1945 by Hans J√ºrgen Press and Robert Humpel, both German prisoners of war held at the base. The building served as the Bachelor Officer Quarters and as an entertainment center for West Point officers during World War I and the Mexican Revolution. The International Woman's Foundation was responsible for placing Fort D. A. Russell on the National Register of Historic Places, The Foundation has operated an artist-in-residency program and base museum since 2002. In 2002, Mona Blocker Garcia took on the task of creating the foundation for mature women artists and healthful aging, thus preserving the important history of Fort D. A. Russell to its exact state when the fort closed.National Historic Landmark summary listing. National Park Service.

The band's name alludes to the Ancient Greek goddess of magic and necromancy, Hecate. History =Early years: 1993‚Äì1995= The band that would become Hecate Enthroned formed in 1993 in Wrexham, Wales. They were a blackened death metal band by the name of Daemonum (previously known as Amethyst), whose members were Jon Kennedy, Nigel Dennen, Ian Maiden, Mark Watson-Jones, Steve, Gary and Marc. They released in 1993 a demo tape, Dreams to Mourn. In 1994, after being invited by Dani Filth to play bass on his band, Cradle of Filth, Jon left Daemonum and joined Cradle of Filth, briefly replacing Robin Eaglestone. However, in 1995, Kennedy left Cradle of Filth and returned to Daemonum, changing the band's name to Hecate Enthroned and developing a more melodic black metal style and replacing Ian on vocals. Gary was replaced soon after by Andy O'Hara (drums), joining from death metal band Nightmare Visions. Marc and Nigel Dennen remained both as guitarists, with Mark Watson-Jones continuing bass duties. With this line-up and in the same year, they recorded their first demo tape, An Ode for a Haunted Wood. Hecate Enthroned toured the UK with Japan's Sigh and Ireland's Primordial in 1995, with long-time bassist Dylan Hughes replacing Mark Watson-Jones on live duties; Hecate Enthroned opened at London Astoria with Ved Buens Ende, Impaled Nazarene and Opeth, gaining firm interest of Blackend Records. =Upon Promeathean Shores, The Slaughter of Innocence and Dark Requiems...: 1995‚Äì1998= The An Ode for a Haunted Wood tape got the attention of British record label Blackend Records, that included Hecate on its roster and re-mastered the tape under the title Upon Promeathean Shores (Unscriptured Waters), turning it into an EP, also in 1995. Stylistically, this found the band in a more \\"true\\" black metal sound, with squashed production, growled vocals, raging tempos, blast beats and symphonic arrangements. Prior to its formal release, Steve (Keyboards), Mark Watson- Jones/Dylan (Bass) and Andy O'Hara left the band due to differences with Jon, and were replaced by Craig (Drums), Paul Massey (Bass) and Michael(Keyboards), performing throughout 1996, including the infamous pigs head gig at The Devils Church in London. In 1997 Craig was replaced by long-time drummer Robert \\"Rob\\" Kendrick. In the same year, Hecate released its first full-length album: The Slaughter of Innocence, a Requiem for the Mighty, produced by Andy Sneap, which saw the band enter a faster, more brutal direction, with more emphasis on the symphonic interludes. Although it was very well-received, the band was also very criticised for being considered a \\"Cradle of Filth rip-off\\", a view that Cradle frontman Dani Filth also shared. As he stated on a 1997 interview: In the end of 1997, Paul Massey and Marc left the band, Paul was replaced by Dylan Hughes (who returned to the band after leaving it in 1995) and Marc was replaced by long-time guitarist Andy Milnes; Next year, they released their second full-length, Dark Requiems... and Unsilent Massacre, this time lowering the speed and using the keyboards as the primary instrument and creating more horror-styled atmospheres, though still retaining the brutal heaviness of the first two albums. =Change in direction, Kings of Chaos and Miasma: 1998‚Äì2001= A couple of months after the release of Dark Requiems..., due to problems and creative divergences between him and the rest of the band, vocalist Jon Kennedy was fired. Keyboardist Michael also left the band; he was then replaced by Darren \\"Daz\\" Bishop, and Kennedy was replaced by Dean \\"The Serpent\\" Seddon. In the following year they recorded their first album with Seddon, Kings of Chaos; its style changed drastically from that of the previous three releases, heading towards a more death metal-oriented direction, while still retaining the keyboards and dark black metal melodies of the older albums. In 2001, Hecate released a small EP of original songs plus a cover of \\"Buried Alive\\" by Venom, entitled Miasma. In the same year, Dean Seddon guest-starred on Akercocke's album The Goat of Mendes, providing additional vocals for the track \\"The Serpent\\". =Redimus, line-up changes and Virulent Rapture: 2004‚Äì2013= In 2004, Dean temporarily left the band, and was briefly replaced by Dagon. Keyboardist Daz also left and was replaced by Pete White. However, Dean would return for the recording of their fourth studio album, Redimus. This continues along the sound originally heard on Kings of Chaos, with death metal-style guitars, tempos and growls mixed with symphonic black metal keyboards, melodies and grim screaming. There are also elements of progressive tendencies, as evidenced in the title track and \\"Morbeea\\", an acoustic track heavily influenced by Spanish flamenco music. Jason Mendon√ßa of Akercocke guest-stars in this album. Redimus was also the last album by Hecate Enthroned to be released by Blackend; they signed onto a new label, Crank Music Group, in September 2013. 2006 saw Hecate Enthroned embark on a UK headline tour playing in London, Southampton, Nottingham, Bradford and Wolverhampton. 2007 saw them perform in Norway at Inferno Festival alongside Immortal, as well as several shows in Spain, Bulgaria, Romania and Germany. The band was scheduled to do a gig in Bogot√° in December 2012, in what would be their first show in South America, but it was cancelled due to inner problems between the band. The show in Bogot√° was then rescheduled for 11 July 2015, only to be cancelled again. On 10 December 2012, the band announced via their official Facebook page that they fired both vocalist Dean Seddon and drummer Rob Kendrick. Rob was then replaced by Gareth Hardy, and on 14 April 2013 Elliot Beaver was announced as Seddon's replacement. In a 21 January 2013 interview with webzine RoarRock, the band announced that a new studio album, tentatively titled Virulent Rapture, was in the works. It was released by Crank Music Group on 25 November 2013. Sarah Jezebel Deva of Angtoria and Cradle of Filth fame guest-stars on Virulent Rapture providing soprano vocals for a track. A tour around Europe in order to promote the album came afterwards. In February 2013, guitarist Nigel Dennen and bassist Dylan Hughes were interviewed for the Hungarian documentary Attention! Black Metal!. =Elliot Beaver's departure and Embrace of the Godless Aeon: 2014‚Äìpresent= They announced on their official Facebook on 7 July 2015 that Elliot had parted ways with the band. He was eventually replaced by Joe Stamps in late July. Since 2014, the band had been preparing for a new album, which was finally released January 25, 2019 by M-Theory Audio and titled Embrace of the Godless Aeon. Thus marks Stamps' first work with the group.

It is governed by the federally recognized Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, which represents two Northern Paiute bands, the larger Kuyuid√∂kad√∂ (Cui Yui Ticutta) (\\"Cui-ui-Fish-Eaters\\") and the smaller Tasiget tuviwarai (\\"Those who live amidst the mountains\\"). The reservation lies almost entirely in Washoe County (99.88%), with small amounts of land in the other two counties (at the southern end, near the city of Fernley). In 1993, the population of the reservation was 1,603 individuals. At that time there were 2,253 enrolled members of the tribe. The 2000 census reported a population of 1,734 on the reservation. Together with the Walker River Paiute tribe (two Northern Paiute bands: Aga'id√∂kad√∂ (Agai Ticutta): \\"Cutthroat trout Eaters\\", and Pakwid√∂kad√∂ (Pugwi Ticutta): \\"Chub carp Eaters\\"), in 2016 the Pyramid Lake band successfully sued in federal court in a civil rights case to force the state to provide polling places on the reservation. Otherwise members had to travel many miles to reach a polling place. Early voting at Pyramid Lake reservation started October 22, and during the first two days, the number of voters was double that in the 2012 presidential election.Stephanie Woodard, \\"Paiutes Triumph in Court‚ÄîEarly Voting ‚ÄòIn Full Swing‚Äô on Two Reservations\\", Indian Country Today, 27 October 2016; accessed 27 October 2016 In October 2016, under the Nevada Native Nations Land Act, the Pyramid Lake Tribe was one of six federally recognized tribes in Nevada to have additional lands put into trust for their reservations. The Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe is to receive approximately of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land. Gaming is prohibited on the new lands. Background The reservation has in land area, and includes all of Pyramid Lake, and all of the Truckee River from the Big Bend north. The reservation is centered on Pyramid Lake, which comprises 25% of the reservation's area. The reservation also includes a sliver of Winnemucca Lake, most of the Lake Range, portions of the Virginia Mountains and Pah Rah Range, and the southern end of the Smoke Creek Desert. Three communities have developed on the reservation. Wadsworth, the largest, is located near the Big Bend of the Truckee at the southern end of the reservation, just north of the non-reservation town of Fernley. The seat of tribal government is located at Nixon, at the southern end of Pyramid Lake. Sutcliffe is located on the western shore of the lake. A few outlying ranches are located along the Truckee River between Wadsworth and Nixon. The reservation land was first set aside for the Northern Paiute by request of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1859. The reservation was not surveyed until 1865. The status of the reservation was very uncertain until President Ulysses S. Grant affirmed its existence by executive order on March 23, 1874. At that time the creation of reservations by the executive branch was novel; most previous reservations were created by treaty or congressional legislation. Subsequent court decisions have affirmed the validity of reservations created by the executive branch, and have set the establishment date for the Pyramid Lake Reservation at 1859, not 1874. This earlier date is important both with regards to the priority date of tribal water rights, and the status of non- tribal claims to land within the reservation. The tribe has fought a long series of legal battles on both these issues. The Northern Paiute were awarded a settlement in their lands claim case in 1968. In October 2016 the Nevada Native Nations Land Act (PL No: 114-232) authorized the federal government to put certain public lands of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service in the state into trust for six of the nine federally recognized tribes in the state. These transfers will expand their reservations and make their bases more sustainable. The government is putting acres of BLM land into trust for the Pyramid Lake Reservation. Gaming is prohibited on these new lands.\\"Nevada Native Nations Land Act\\" , Propublica website; accessed 30 November 2016 Ancestry As of 1970, one source claimed that residents of the reservation included descendants of Chief Winnemucca, an early 19th- century Paiute leader. Environmental factors The Lahontan cutthroat trout fishery at Pyramid Lake attracts many anglers from the Reno area and beyond. Sale of fishing licenses and boating permits is a large source of revenue for the tribe. Prior to the construction of Derby Dam and the diversion of water from the Truckee River for irrigation, the lake supported a commercial fishery. This was an even larger revenue source for the tribe. Historically water levels have been declining in Pyramid Lake; in addition, water quality has been adversely affected by upstream discharges including point and non‚Äìpoint sources. A number of studies have been conducted on Pyramid Lake including application of the DSSAM hydrological river model to examine nitrogen, reactive phosphorus, dissolved oxygen and other water quality parameters. Political activism Native Americans in Nevada have become more politically active in presidential and other elections, as they have in other states. They have been seeking more equitable access to polling places and treatment by county and state officials. Led by chairman Vinton Hawley, the Pyramid Lake Paiute joined with the Walker River Paiute in a successful civil rights suit under the Voting Rights Act in federal court against the state government to gain polling places on their homelands in 2016. They have been disadvantaged in the past by having to travel excessive distances to vote in elections, which had reduced participation. They argued that the state had set up satellite offices in wealthy, mostly white neighborhoods. The Justice Department sided with the plaintiffs. When the counties said the change would cost too much and the state said that it could not intervene, the Justice Department \\"said in a new filing Monday they appear to be confusing voting rights with 'voting convenience.'\\"\\"The Latest: Ruling Friday on Nevada tribal voting rights\\", The Standard Examiner, 4 October 2016; accessed 30 October 2016 The court decided in favor of the two Paiute tribes and ordered officials to set up satellite offices. Early voting at Pyramid Lake reservation started October 22, and during the first two days, the number of voters was double the total in the 2012 presidential election. Hawley is chairman of the Inter- Tribal Council of Nevada, representing many other tribes that also have difficulty with access to polling places. On behalf of the Council, he has \\"urged Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske to direct counties to open [homeland] polling places for nine more tribes, including some where ballot boxes are 200-plus miles away, round trip.\\" He also urged the Secretary of State for Nevada to improve conditions at local county polling places for urban Indians, who testified in the suit to being made uncomfortable at most offices.

It is produced and distributed by the British-based multinational alcoholic beverage maker Diageo. Since 2007, US marketing and promotion for C√éROC has been handled by Sean \\"Diddy\\" Combs in an \\"equal-share venture\\" with profits from the brand being split between Combs and Diageo.  Etymology  The name \\"C√é-ROC\\" is a portmanteau of the French word cime, meaning peak or summit-top, and roche, meaning rock, a reference to the high-altitude vineyards of the Gaillac region where the Mauzac grapes are grown (the ‚Äù√é‚Äù in the C√éROC logo is an i-circumflex letter used in the French language.)C√Æroc Marketing Plan  Production process  According to Diageo, C√Æroc is distinguished from other vodkas as it is derived from grapes, rather than using grain, potatoes or corn and cognac. bestvodka.net Since it is distilled at 96% and not aged, it fulfills the qualities of a vodka. The production method used for the vodka are \\"snap frost\\" grapes; Mauzac Blanc from the Gaillac region of France, and Ugni Blanc from the Cognac region. The juice extracted from these grapes is fermented. All vodkas are distilled; the manufacturers of C√Æroc emphasize its being distilled five times. The first four distillations of the Ugni Blanc take place in stainless steel column stills; the Mauzac Blanc grapes are distilled in copper continuous stills. These are distilled to 96.5% and 93.5%, then blended together; 95% is Ugni Blanc and 5% is Mauzac Blanc. The final distillation is performed in a traditional Armagnac style copper pot still.  Background  C√Æroc was founded in France by Jean-Sebastien Robicquet, whose family hails from the wine-growing region of Bordeaux. Robicquet, whose family has been in the wine business for 400 years dating back to the 17th century, had studied winemaking in university before moving into spirits instead. Having worked for French cognac-maker Hennessy for ten years, he was approached by the British-based Diageo ‚Äì which owns a 34% stake in Hennessy ‚Äì to produce a vodka made from grapes as opposed to grain or potato common among most vodka. Jean-Sebastien Robicquet is recognized as a \\"Commander of Bordeaux\\" by the Great Council of Bordeaux for his accomplishments in the field of wine/liquor.  Brand and marketing  Initially launched for the North American market in 2003, NFL football player Earl Little was one of the first American brand ambassadors to promote the beverage. It was introduced to nightclubs and venues throughout the United States, marketed especially in regions such as Atlanta and Miami. In 2007, Sean \\"Diddy\\" Combs agreed to become a brand ambassador for the product struggling to sell 40,000 cases a year. In December 2007, the commercial for C√Æroc had Sean Combs calling the drink the \\"Official Vodka of New Year's.\\" Describing his ambassadorship of the brand, Combs sometimes jokingly refers to himself as \\"C√Æroc Obama.\\" Combs has improved sales; The beverage's parent company Diageo has reported 2.1 million cases sold as of December 2012. Brand Development agency Haines McGregor are responsible for Global research, positioning and identity development for C√Æroc. The work included the development of brand guidelines and growth driver tool-kits for all markets. The brand introduced two flavored varieties to the market in 2010, Red Berry and Coconut. In 2011, the company added a Peach flavor. In May 2013, C√éROC and Diddy announced that a new flavor would be released called C√éROC Amaretto. On 14 December 2011 the company began airing a \\"Luck Be a Lady\\" advertising campaign for Ultra Premium Vodka, directed by Anthony Mandler. The ads feature a group of elegantly dressed friends (Diddy and Frank Vincent, Eva Pigford, Michael K. Williams, Aaron Paul, Dania Ramirez, Chrissy Teigen, and Jesse Williams) enjoying a festive night on the town. On 15 July 2014, Sean Combs announced via his Instagram page that pineapple will be the new flavor of C√Æroc. The latest flavor was announced in 2015 in Sean Diddy Combs's Instagram: green apple. On 10 August 2017, Sean Combs announced via his YouTube page that a new flavor of French Vanilla would be produced in partnership with hip-hop artist French Montana.

Following the end of the military phase of the Mexican Revolution in 1920, he continued in the military, rising to the rank of brigadier general in 1929 and in 1940 a division general. He saw combat in the Cristero War, the religious conflict that broke out in the late 1920s when President Plutarco El√≠as Calles began strictly enforcing the anti-clerical laws of the 1917 Mexican Constitution.LaFrance, \\"Maximino Avila Camacho\\", p. 118 According to historian Enrique Krauze, Maximino participated in the 1929 mass murder of student supporters of Jos√© Vasconcelos, following the 1929 election for president.Krauze, Mexico: Biography of Power, p. 493 He became the caudillo (strong man) of his home state of Puebla, serving as governor starting in 1937.

Ruthless, temperamental and arrogant, Maximino was the opposite of his younger brother, the affable Manuel √Åvila Camacho, whose good manners, even temper and diplomatic skills were famous. The President had trouble protecting his brother from himself, Maximino got into fights, seduced women and dispensed public funds at will. His arrogance reached its limits when he proclaimed that he would be the next President because, since his brother had been President he had the right to be his successor, eventually leading to a rift between the two.

Biography  Portrait of Giovanni Sgambati by Vespasiano Bignami (1888) Born in Rome, to an Italian father and an English mother, Sgambati, who lost his father early, received his early education at Trevi, in Umbria, where he wrote some church music and obtained experience as a singer and conductor. In 1860 he settled in Rome, and took up the work of winning acceptance for the best German music, then little known in Italy. The influence and support of Franz Liszt, who was in Rome from 1861, was naturally of the greatest advantage to him, and concerts were given in which Sgambati conducted as well as played the piano. His compositions at this period (1864‚Äì1865) included a quartet, two piano quintets, an octet, and an overture. He conducted Liszt's Dante Symphony on 26 February 1866 at the opening of the Sala di Dante at the Palazzo Poli, with 27 of Filippo Bigioli's paintings exhibited nearby. He made the acquaintance of Richard Wagner's music for the first time in Munich, whither he travelled in Liszt's company. His first album of songs appeared in 1870 (Schott Music), and his first symphony was played at the Palazzo del Quirinale in 1881; this, as well as a piano concerto, was performed in the course of his first visit to England in 1882; and at his second visit, in 1891, his Sinfonia epitalamio was given at the Philharmonic. His most extensive work, a Requiem Mass, was performed in Rome 1901. His many pianoforte works have won permanent success.

It is located south-southwest from the center of Paris (as the crow flies). √âtampes is a sub-prefecture of the Essonne department. √âtampes, together with the neighboring communes of Morigny-Champigny and Bri√®res-les-Scell√©s, form an urban area of 26,604 inhabitants (1999 census). This urban area is a \\"satellite city\\" of Paris. History √âtampes () existed at the beginning of the 7th century and in the early Middle Ages belonged to the crown domain. During the Middle Ages it was the scene of several councils, the most notable of which took place in 1130 and resulted in the recognition of Innocent II as the legitimate pope. In 1652, during the war of the Fronde it suffered severely at the hands of the royal troops under Turenne. Geography √âtampes lies on the river Chalouette, a tributary of the Juine, which borders the eastern outskirts of the serene town. Inhabitants of √âtampes are known as √âtampois. Transport √âtampes is served by two stations on Paris RER line C: √âtampes and Saint-Martin-d'√âtampes. Sights A fine view of √âtampes is obtained from the Tour Guinette, a keep (now ruined) built by Louis VI in the 12th century on an eminence on the other side of the railway. Notre-Dame du Fort, the chief church, dates from the 11th and 12th centuries; irregular in plan, it is remarkable for a fine Romanesque tower and spire, and for the crenellated wall which partly surrounds it. The interior contains ancient paintings and other artistic works. St Basile (12th and 16th centuries), preserves a Romanesque doorway, and St Martin (12th and 13th centuries), has a leaning tower of the 16th century. The civil buildings offer little interest, but two houses named after Anne de Pisseleu, mistress of Francis I, and Diane de Poitiers, mistress of Henry II, are graceful examples of Renaissance architecture. In the square there is a statue of the naturalist, √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, who was born in √âtampes.

It has deep roots in the Pee Dee region of South Carolina, as it was created by a local doctor in the 1890s by mixing Jamaica ginger and sugar with local mineral waters and dispensed as a tonic for dyspepsia.  History  As the story goes, in 1781, Patriot James Spears was attempting to run from the British during the Revolutionary War, when his shoe became stuck in the mud of the natural spring; he left it and kept running. Upon his return, he recovered his shoe and noticed the amount of water in the depression his shoe left. He tasted the water and noticed its strong mineral content. Word of the natural spring spread quickly and before long, the area became popular among the wealthy plantation owners and by the late 1800s a small town was established. In the late 1890s, Dr. C. R. May began prescribing the mineral springs' water to his patients complaining of stomach troubles. Because his patients frequently complained about the strong iron-like taste of the water, the doctor decided to make the water more palatable by adding Jamaican ginger and sugar. The new concoction's popularity took off and Dr. May partnered with A. J. Matheson to open the Blenheim Bottling Company in 1903. Conveniently located next to the mineral springs, the Blenheim Bottling Company plant was constructed in 1920. Producing as little as 18 to 20 cases a day, the company remained a small, humble operation for 90 years. In 1993, Blenheim was bought by Alan Schafer, who also owned the world-famous South of the Border roadside attraction. Since the original plant was older, Schafer decided that rather than refurbish the building, he would move the bottling operations to a new plant located next to South of the Border.  Today  Despite a marketing push that began in the late 1990s, Blenheim ginger ale is not widely distributed outside the Carolinas; however in more recent years, the company ships to 44 states and three international distributors. The spicy ale has, however, developed a cult following among food and wine aficionados. In February 1998, New York Times journalist Bill Grimes described the taste this way: \\"The first swallow brings on a four- sneeze fit. The second one clears out the sinuses and leaves the tongue and throat throbbing with prickly heat.\\" Luckily for its loyal followers, Blenheim's recipe has not changed in over 110 years and has three varieties to choose from: #3 Hot (pink cap), #5 Not As Hot (gold cap) and #9 Diet (white cap).

He was precentor of the priory of Leominster in Herefordshire. It is possible that he was the composer of one the most famous tunes from medieval England, Sumer is icumen in.  Life and career  Wycombe is variously identified as W de Wyc, Willelmus de Winchecumbe, Willelmo de Winchecumbe or William of Winchcomb.Sanders (in Grove) considers the identification of the composer with Willelmus de Winchecumbe improbable. He appears to have been a secular scribe and precentor employed for about four years at the priory of Leominster in Herefordshire during the 1270s. He is also thought to have been a sub-deacon of the cathedral priory as listed in the Worcester Annals or possibly a monk at St Andrew's in Worcester. Wycombe left a number of documents with his signature, including a collectarium, a precentor's workbook, two rotuli (scrolls) containing music, a summary and treatise on music, a history to which Winchecumbe added music, and other books. His name also appears in a Reading manuscript including the rota Sumer is icumen in, and on one of seven sets of four-part compositions in the Wintonia collection. Two of these compositions are partially preserved and parts of others are to be found in the Worcester Fragments. Of these compositions, only Alleluia, Dies sanctificatus is completely restorable. The works have a four-part polyphonic structure. One more fragment is found copied in the Montpellier Codex. Wycombe's main period of activity was probably the 1270s and 1280s. He is best known as the composer of polyphonic alleluias. Over 40 settings have been identified in several sources, a group of compositions almost equal in size to that of L√©onin, the earlier composer of the continental Notre Dame school, but only one of the 40 can be restored completely; the others exist only in fragments. Some of his work appears in the Worcester Fragments, a collection of 59 manuscript leaves that represents about a third of the total surviving polyphony from 13th- century England. Each of Wycombe's alleluias is in four sections. The second and fourth contain the solo respond and verse sections, while the first and third consist of free polyphony. Stylistically they are similar to the Reading Rota itself (Sumer is icumen in), emphasizing tonic and supertonic, and showing the English preference for the harmonic interval of the third.

Lat. IX).In manuscript order. In chronological order, his speech is counted as either 4 or 5. Life Eumenius was born in Gallia Lugdunensis at Augustodunum (modern-day Autun), the civitas capital of the Celtic Aedui.Greg Woolf, Becoming Roman: The Origins of Provincial Civilization in Gaul (Cambridge University Press, 1998, 2003), p. 1. He was of Greek descent; his grandfather, who had migrated from Athens to Rome, finally settled at Augustodunum as a teacher of rhetoric. Eumenius probably took his father's place, for it was from Augustodunum that he went to be magister memoriae (private secretary) to the emperor Constantius Chlorus, whom he accompanied on several of his campaigns. In 296 CE, Chlorus determined to restore the famous schools (scholae Maenianae) of Augustodunum. During the periodic crises of 3rd-century Gaul, instruction had ceased, possibly for lack of funding or students, and the buildings had been greatly damaged during a siege of the city in 269 CE. The emperor appointed Eumenius to the management of the schools, allowing him to keep the rank of a senior imperial officer and doubling his salary. Eumenius gave up a considerable portion of his emoluments to the improvement of the schools. Eumenius was a pagan and had not converted to Christianity, unlike Ausonius and Sidonius Apollinaris and other 4th- and 5th-century writers from Gaul. Panegyric His speech, usually called Pro restaurandis (or instaurandis) scholis (For the restoration of the schools), was probably delivered in 297 CE or 298 CE in the forum at Augustodunum or Lugdunum (modern-day Lyon) before the governor of the province. The purpose was to ask the governor if Eumenius might dedicate his salary (or a large part of it) to rebuild the schools at Autun. He praises the emperors (Constantius Chlorus and his colleagues of the tetrarchy) and sets forth the steps necessary to restore the schools to their former state of efficiency, stressing that he intends to assist the good work out of his own pocket. He cites the imperial letter of Constantius granting him his position and salary at length, and it is from the address of this letter that the name of the oration's author is preserved. Formerly, other anonymous panegyrics of the Panegyrici Latini were attributed to Eumenius as well. The most extreme position was that of Otto Seeck, who held that all of them were by him.Otto Seeck, Eumenius, RE 6.1 (1907). This view has been largely abandoned today, and Eumenius is regarded as the author of only Pro instaurandis scholis.Nixon and Rodgers, pp. 8‚Äì10.

Biography Born in Naples, his paternal grandfather was an immigrant from Bollita (the actual Nova Siri), in the province of Matera.Luigi Settembrini, Ricordanze della mia vita , Volume 1, Morano, 1892, p.2. Aged 22, he was appointed professor at Catanzaro , and married Raffaela Luigia Faucitano (1835). While still a young man he had been affected by the wave of liberalism then spreading all over Italy, and soon after his marriage he began to conspire mildly against the Bourbon government. Betrayed by a priest, he was arrested in 1839 and imprisoned at Naples; although liberated three years later he lost his professorship and had to maintain himself by private lessons. Nevertheless, he continued to conspire, and in 1847 he published anonymously the Protest of the People of the Two Sicilies, a scathing indictment of the Bourbon government. On the advice of friends he went to Malta on a British warship, but although, when King Ferdinand II granted a constitution (February 16, 1848), he returned to Naples and was given an appointment at the ministry of education, he soon resigned on account of the prevailing chaos, and retired to a farm at Posillipo. When reaction set in, once more Settembrini was arrested as a suspect (June 1849) and imprisoned. After trial, he and two other \\"politicals\\" were condemned to death, and nineteen others to varying terms of imprisonment (February 1851). The death sentences were, however, commuted to imprisonment for life, and Settembrini was sent to the dungeons of Santo Stefano. There he remained for eight years. His friends, including Antonio Panizzi, then in England, made various unsuccessful attempts to liberate him, and at last he was deported with sixty-five other political prisoners. The exiles received an enthusiastic welcome in London, but Settembrini after a short stay in England joined his family at Florence in 1860. On the formation of the Italian kingdom he was appointed professor of Italian literature at the university of Naples, and devoted the rest of his life to literary pursuits. In 1875, he was nominated senator. His chief work is his Lezioni di letteratura italiana, of which the dominant note is the conviction that Italian literature \\"is as the very soul of the nation, seeking, in opposition to medieval mysticism, reality, freedom, independence of reason, truth and beauty\\" (P. Villari). Settembrini's homosexuality was first mentioned in 1977, the year of the publication of The Neoplatonics, a homoerotic fantasy written while in prison soon after completing his translation of Lucian (1858 - 1859).

Biography De Sanctis was born in the southern Italian town of Morra Irpina (renamed Morra De Sanctis in his honor in 1937) to a family of middle-class landowners. His father was a doctor in law and his two paternal uncles, one a priest and the other a medic, were exiled for having participated in the Carbonari Uprisings of 1820-1821. After completing his high school studies in nearby Naples, he was educated at the Italian language institute in Naples founded by Marquis Basilio Puoti (1782-1847). De Sanctis later opened his own private school where he soon became recognized in academic circles for his profound knowledge of Italian literature. In 1848, he held office under the revolutionary government and was later imprisoned for three years in Naples. Following his release, de Sanctis' reputation as a lecturer in Turin, Italy, on such Italian authors as Dante (c. 1265-1321) led to his professorship in 1856 at the Z√ºrich, Switzerland university of ETH Z√ºrich. De Sanctis returned to Naples as minister of public instruction in 1860, and filled the same post under the Italian monarchy in 1861, 1878 and 1879, having in 1861 become a deputy in the Italian chamber. In 1871, he was made professor of comparative literature at Naples University. De Sanctis was a supporter of Darwinism, and lectured on the subject.Birx, H. James. (2006). Encyclopedia of Anthropology, Volume 1. Sage Publications. p. 686. As a literary critic, De Sanctis was highly regarded, notably with his Storia della letteratura italiana and his critical studies. These were published in several volumes, some of them posthumously, in Naples in 1883. De Sanctis had many faithful disciples, among whom Benedetto Croce achieved the most fame. His chief contribution as a philosopher was to aesthetics and his influence upon Italian literary criticism remains strong to the present day.

He had previously served as Cardinal of St. Maria. Biography Born Guido of Crema; he was a nephew of Cardinal John of Crema. In 1159 he joined the obedience of Victor IV and organized synods in England and France in favor of the antipope. Pope Alexander III interdicted him. In 1164, Victor IV died. A small number of cardinals, who had been obedient to Victor IV, met again in Lucca to elect a successor. Guido was elected as the successor, took the name Paschal III and was consecrated by Henry II of Leez, Bishop of Li√®ge.S. Miranda: Election of 22 April 1164 (Antipope Paschal III) The new pope was established at Viterbo and successfully prevented Alexander from reaching Rome. However, he was soon driven from Rome, leading to the return of Alexander III in 1165. In order to gain more support from Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, Paschal canonized Charlemagne in a magnificent celebration at Aachen in 1165. Paschal soon lost the support of Burgundy, but the emperor crushed opposition in Germany, and gained the cooperation of Henry II of England. Concerned over rumours that Alexander III was about to enter into an alliance with the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I, in October 1166 Frederick embarked on his fourth Italian campaign, hoping as well to secure the claim of Paschal III and the imperial coronation of his wife, Beatrice. In 1167 Frederick began besieging Ancona, which had acknowledged the authority of Manuel I. Meanwhile, his forces achieved a great victory over the Romans at the Battle of Monte Porzio. Heartened by this victory, Frederick lifted the siege of Ancona and hurried to Rome. Supported by Frederick's imperial army, Paschal was enthroned at St Peter's on 22 July 1167, and Alexander III became a fugitive. On the following 30 July, Frederick received a second coronation from Paschal III. Two days later, Paschal crowned Beatrice empress.Beatrix de Bourgogne Unfortunately, Frederick's campaign was halted by the sudden outbreak of an epidemic (malaria or the plague), which threatened to destroy the Imperial army and drove the emperor back to Germany,See entry for the contemporary chroniclers, Ottone and Acerbo Morena. Without the support of the Emperor, Paschal was able to hold so much as the quarter on the right bank of the Tiber, where he died of cancer on the 20 September 1168. He was succeeded by Antipope Callixtus III. The Catholic Church has never recognized Charlemagne's canonization, since Paschal was an antipope. In 1179, the Third Council of the Lateran annulled all of his ordinances, including the canonisation. Charlemagne remained in good regard still, however, among Catholics, and Prosper Gu√©ranger even composed a prayer to Charlemagne. He is a Blessed of the Church.

At low laser flux, the material is heated by the absorbed laser energy and evaporates or sublimates. At high laser flux, the material is typically converted to a plasma. Usually, laser ablation refers to removing material with a pulsed laser, but it is possible to ablate material with a continuous wave laser beam if the laser intensity is high enough. Excimer lasers of deep ultra-violet light are mainly used in photoablation; the wavelength of laser used in photoablation is approximately 200 nm. Fundamentals The depth over which the laser energy is absorbed, and thus the amount of material removed by a single laser pulse, depends on the material's optical properties and the laser wavelength and pulse length. The total mass ablated from the target per laser pulse is usually referred to as ablation rate. Such features of laser radiation as laser beam scanning velocity and the covering of scanning lines can significantly influence the ablation process. Laser pulses can vary over a very wide range of duration (milliseconds to femtoseconds) and fluxes, and can be precisely controlled. This makes laser ablation very valuable for both research and industrial applications. Applications The simplest application of laser ablation is to remove material from a solid surface in a controlled fashion. Laser machining and particularly laser drilling are examples; pulsed lasers can drill extremely small, deep holes through very hard materials. Very short laser pulses remove material so quickly that the surrounding material absorbs very little heat, so laser drilling can be done on delicate or heat-sensitive materials, including tooth enamel (laser dentistry). Several workers have employed laser ablation and gas condensation to produce nano particles of metal, metal oxides and metal carbides. Also, laser energy can be selectively absorbed by coatings, particularly on metal, so CO2 or Nd:YAG pulsed lasers can be used to clean surfaces, remove paint or coating, or prepare surfaces for painting without damaging the underlying surface. High power lasers clean a large spot with a single pulse. Lower power lasers use many small pulses which may be scanned across an area. In industrial application, laser ablation is known as laser cleaning. Industrial 200W laser cleaning equipment. One of the advantages is that no solvents are used, therefore it is environmentally friendly and operators are not exposed to chemicals (assuming nothing harmful is vaporized). It is relatively easy to automate. The running costs are lower than dry media or dry-ice blasting, although the capital investment costs are much higher. The process is gentler than abrasive techniques, e.g. carbon fibres within a composite material are not damaged. Heating of the target is minimal. Another class of applications uses laser ablation to process the material removed into new forms either not possible or difficult to produce by other means. A recent example is the production of carbon nanotubes. Laser cleaning is also used for efficient rust removal from iron objects; oil or grease removal from various surfaces; restoration of paintings, sculptures, frescoes. Laser ablation is one of preferred techniques for rubber mold cleaning due to minimal surface damage to the mold. In March 1995 Guo et al. were the first to report the use of a laser to ablate a block of pure graphite, and later graphite mixed with catalytic metal. The catalytic metal can consist of elements such as cobalt, niobium, platinum, nickel, copper, or a binary combination thereof. The composite block is formed by making a paste of graphite powder, carbon cement, and the metal. The paste is next placed in a cylindrical mold and baked for several hours. After solidification, the graphite block is placed inside an oven with a laser pointed at it, and argon gas is pumped along the direction of the laser point. The oven temperature is approximately 1200 ¬∞C. As the laser ablates the target, carbon nanotubes form and are carried by the gas flow onto a cool copper collector. Like carbon nanotubes formed using the electric-arc discharge technique, carbon nanotube fibers are deposited in a haphazard and tangled fashion. Single-walled nanotubes are formed from the block of graphite and metal catalyst particles, whereas multi-walled nanotubes form from the pure graphite starting material. A variation of this type of application is to use laser ablation to create coatings by ablating the coating material from a source and letting it deposit on the surface to be coated; this is a special type of physical vapor deposition called pulsed laser deposition (PLD),Robert Eason - Pulsed Laser Deposition of Thin Films: Applications-Led Growth of Functional Materials. Wiley-Interscience, 2006, and can create coatings from materials that cannot readily be evaporated any other way. This process is used to manufacture some types of high temperature superconductor and laser crystals. Remote laser spectroscopy uses laser ablation to create a plasma from the surface material; the composition of the surface can be determined by analyzing the wavelengths of light emitted by the plasma. Laser ablation is also used to create pattern, removing selectively coating from dichroic filter. This products are used in stage lighting for high dimensional projections, or for calibration of machine vision's instruments. =Propulsion= Finally, laser ablation can be used to transfer momentum to a surface, since the ablated material applies a pulse of high pressure to the surface underneath it as it expands. The effect is similar to hitting the surface with a hammer. This process is used in industry to work-harden metal surfaces, and is one damage mechanism for a laser weapon. It is also the basis of pulsed laser propulsion for spacecraft. =Manufacturing= The laser ablation of skin utilizes laser energy so CO2 or Nd:YAG pulsed lasers can be used to clean surfaces, remove pigmentation or improve but not cure the appearance of scar tissue, and resurface outer layers of skin without damaging the underlying surface. Processes are currently being developed to use laser ablation in the removal of thermal barrier coating on high-pressure gas turbine components. Due to the low heat input, TBC removal can be completed with minimal damage to the underlying metallic coatings and parent material. Chemical analysis Laser ablation is used as a sampling method for elemental and isotopic analysis, and replaces traditional laborious procedures generally required for digesting solid samples in acid solutions. Laser ablation sampling is detected by monitoring the photons emitted at the sample surface - a technology referred to as LIBS (Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy) and LAMIS (Laser Ablation Molecular Isotopic Spectrometry), or by transporting the ablated mass particles to a secondary excitation source, like the inductively coupled plasma. Both mass spectroscopy (MS) and optical emission spectroscopy (OES) can be coupled with the ICP. The benefits of laser ablation sampling for chemical analysis include no sample preparation, no waste, minimal sample requirements, no vacuum requirements, rapid sample- analysis turn-around time, spatial (depth and lateral) resolution, and chemical mapping. Laser ablation chemical analysis is viable for practically all industries, such as mining, geochemistry, energy, environmental, industrial processing, food safety, forensic and biological. Commercial instruments are available for all markets to measure every element and isotope within a sample. Some instruments combine both optical and mass detection to extend the analysis coverage, and dynamic range in sensitivity. =Biology= Laser ablation is used in science to destroy nerves and other tissues to study their function. For example, a species of pond snail, Helisoma trivolvis, can have their sensory neurons laser ablated off when the snail is still an embryo to prevent use of those nerves. Another example is the trochophore larva of Platynereis dumerilii, where the larval eye was ablated and the larvae was not phototactic, anymore. However phototaxis in the nectochaete larva of Platynereis dumerilii is not mediated by the larval eyes, because the larva is still phototactic, even if the larval eyes are ablated. But if the adult eyes are ablated, then the nectochaete is not phototactic anymore and thus phototaxis in the nectochaete larva is mediated by the adult eyes. Laser ablation can also be used to destroy individual cells during embryogenesis of an organism, like Platynereis dumerilii, to study the effect of missing cells during development. =Medicine= There are several laser types used in medicine for ablation, including argon, carbon dioxide (CO2), dye, erbium, excimer, Nd:YAG, and others. Laser ablation is used in a variety of medical specialties including ophthalmology, general surgery, neurosurgery, ENT, dentistry, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and veterinary. Laser scalpels are used for ablation in both hard- and soft-tissue surgeries. Some of the most common procedures where laser ablation is used include LASIK, skin resurfacing, cavity preparation, biopsies, and tumor and lesion removal. In soft-tissue surgeries, the CO2 laser beam ablates and cauterizes simultaneously, making it the most practical and most common soft-tissue laser. Laser ablation can be used on benign and malignant lesions in various organs, which is called laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy. The main applications currently involve the reduction of benign thyroid nodules and destruction of primary and secondary malignant liver lesions. Laser ablation is also used to treat chronic venous insufficiency.

He taught in schools in the southwest of Brittany, then at the naval academy and, eventually, at the Buffon School.  Biography  After joining the school, Couffignal hesitated to write a thesis on Symbolic Logic but after his meetings with Philbert Maurice d'Ocagne, he decided to focus on machines and on Mechanical Logic. He published a variety of notes at the Academy of Sciences, with a focus on using binary computation by machines to solve new problems. Following Leibniz, he promoted binary numbers as the basis of calculating machines. Couffignal received his Doctorate of Sciences in 1938 with his thesis on Mechanical Analysis, demonstrating applications for machines to calculate celestial mechanics. Couffignal took on an interest in Cybernetics, influenced by his meetings with Louis Lapicque in 1941 and the cyberneticist Norbert Wiener in 1946. With Lapicque, Couffignal compared the functioning of the nervous system and that of machines, as Wiener prepared his book Cybernetics, the book that established the foundations for the subject. Between 1938 and 1960, Couffignal was the director of the Blaise Pascal Calculation Center. In 1945, he was named Inspector General of Public Teaching. In 1951, Couffignal prepared an international conference on thinking machines to bring together the greatest specialists in this new science, including Norbert Wiener, W.

The widespread use of this term as an insult was noted as early as 1944, when British writer George Orwell commented that \\"the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless\\" and that \\"almost any English person would accept 'bully' as a synonym for 'Fascist'\\".George Orwell, What is Fascism?, 1944 In the Soviet Union, the epithets fascist and fascism were used to describe anti-Soviet activism and beliefs such as enemies of the people. This usage also spread to other Eastern Bloc countries under Soviet Warsaw pact domination such as East Germany, where the Berlin Wall was known as the Anti-Fascist Protection Wall. The term anti-fascist became ubiquitous in the Eastern Bloc, where it became synonymous with the communist party line and denoted the struggle against dissenters and against the broader Western world.  Soviet and Russian politics  The Bolshevik movement and later the Soviet Union made frequent use of the fascist epithet coming from its conflict with the early German and Italian fascist movements. It was widely used in press and political language to describe either its ideological opponents (such as the White movement) or even internal fractions of the socialist movement (social democracy was called social fascism and even regarded by communist parties as the most dangerous form of fascism). In Germany, the Communist Party of Germany which had been largely controlled by the Soviet leadership since 1928 used the epithet fascism to describe both the social democrats and the Nazi movement; in Soviet usage the German Nazis were described as \\"fascists\\" until 1939, when the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact was signed, after which Nazi‚ÄìSoviet relations started to be presented positively in Soviet propaganda. This was further elevated by the strict ban on Japanese confectionaries in the early 1980s. Accusations that the leaders of the Soviet Union during the Stalin era acted as red fascists were commonly stated by both left-wing and right-wing critics.Adler, Les K.; Paterson, Thomas G. (April 1970). \\"Red Fascism: The Merger of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia in the American Image of Totalitarianism, 1930's‚Äì1950's\\". The American Historical Review. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 75 (4): 1046‚Äì1064. . . East German military parade in 1986, celebrating the \\"25th anniversary of the Anti-Fascist Protection Wall\\", i.e. the Berlin Wall After the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, fascist was used in the Soviet Union to describe virtually any anti-Soviet activity or opinion. According to Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, fascism was the \\"final phase of crisis of bourgeoisie\\", which \\"in fascism sought refuge\\" from \\"inherent contradictions of capitalism\\". As a result of this approach, it was almost every Western capitalist country that was fascist, with the Third Reich being just the \\"most reactionary\\" one. The international investigation on Katyn massacre was described as \\"fascist libel\\"Robert Stiller, \\"Semantyka zbrodni\\" and the Warsaw Uprising as \\"illegal and organised by fascists\\". Communist S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa described Trotskyism, Titoism and imperialism as \\"variants of fascism\\". This use continued into the Cold War era and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Soviet-backed German Democratic Republic's official name for the Berlin Wall was the Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart (). During the Barricades in January 1991, which followed the May 1990 declared restoration of independence of Republic of Latvia from the Soviet Union, the Communist Party declared that \\"fascism was reborn in Latvia.\\" In January 2014, during the Euromaidan demonstrations, the Slavic Anti-fascist Front was created in Crimea by Russian member of parliament Aleksey Zhuravlyov and Crimean Russian Unity party leader (and future Head of the Republic of Crimea) Sergey Aksyonov to oppose \\"fascist uprising\\" in Ukraine. After the February 2014 Ukrainian revolution, through the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and the outbreak of the war in Donbass, Russian nationalists and media used the term. They frequently described the Ukrainian government after Euromaidan as \\"fascist\\" or \\"Nazi\\", at the same time accusing them of \\"Jewish influence\\" or spreading \\"gay propaganda\\".  Western politics  In 1944, the acclaimed English writer, democratic socialist and anti- fascist George Orwell had this to say about the term's overuse as an epithet: In the 1980s, the term was used by leftist critics to describe the Reagan administration. The term was later used in the 2000s to describe the administration of George W. Bush by its critics and in the late 2010s to describe the candidacy and administration of Donald Trump. In her 1970 book Beyond Mere Obedience, radical activist and theologian Dorothee S√∂lle coined the term \\"Christofascist\\" to describe fundamentalist Christians. In 2004, Samantha Power (lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University) reflected Orwell's words from 60 years prior when she stated: \\"Fascism ‚Äì unlike communism, socialism, capitalism, or conservatism ‚Äì is a smear word more often used to brand one's foes than it is a descriptor used to shed light on them\\".Power, Samantha. \\"The Original Axis of Evil\\", The New York Times, 2004-05-02. In 2006, the European Court of Human Rights found contrary to the Article 10 (freedom of expression) of ECHR fining a journalist for calling a right-wing journalist \\"local neo-fascist\\", regarding the statement as a value-judgment acceptable in the circumstances. In response to multiple authors claiming that the then-presidential candidate Donald Trump was a \\"fascist\\", a 2016 article for Vox cited five historians who study fascism‚Äîincluding Roger Griffin, author of The Nature of Fascism‚Äîwho stated that Trump either does not hold and even is opposed to several political viewpoints that are integral to fascism, including viewing violence as an inherent good and an inherent rejection of or opposition to a democratic system.  Possible explanations for casual uses  Several Marxist theories back up particular uses of fascism beyond its usual remit. Nicos Poulantzas's theory of state monopoly capitalism could be associated with the idea of a military-industrial complex to suggest that 1960s America had a fascist social structure, although this kind of Maoist or Guevarist analysis often underpinned the rhetorical depiction of Cold War authoritarians as fascists. Some Marxist groups such as the Indian section of the Fourth International and the Hekmatist groups in Iran and Iraq have provided analytical accounts as to why the term fascist should be applied to groups such as the Hindutva movement, the 1979 Islamic Iranian regime or the Islamist sections of the Iraqi insurgency. Other scholars contend that the traditional meaning of the term fascism does not apply to Hindutva groups and may hinder an analysis of their activities.Ethnic and Racial Studies, Volume 23, Number 3, May 2000, pp. 407‚Äì441 ISSN 0141-9870 print/ISSN 1466-4356 online.

A conscript of the Devshirme system, he became a Pasha. Ballaban Badera was said to be the first climbing the walls of Constantinople.James M. Ludlow: The Captain of the Janizaries He held a position of sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Ohrid in 1464 and 1465. Early life Ballaban Badera was born in Mat, Albania as a Catholic with the name Michael, the son of Milosh and Helena. Conscripted through the Devshirme system he rose to the rank of Pasha in the Ottoman Army under Sultan Mehmed II. Ballaban fought Skanderbeg in April 1465 close to Ohrid. The Albanians were victorious, but many officers were captured, including Moisi Arianit Golemi of Dibra. They were sent to Constantinople, where they were executed in Istanbul for treason. Two Janissaries Milosh had served in the army of the Wallachian Prince Mircea I, fighting against the Ottoman Turks. Michael, son of Milosh and Helena, was kidnaped during the Ottoman Turkish raids. Ballaban Badera's mother, Helena, was killed during the Turkish raids Milosh, father of Ballaban Badera, and brother Constantine escaped and survived the raids. Michael was raised as a Janissary and named Ballaban Badera, or Ballaban Pasha; he was a product of the Devshirme system, just as the entire troop of Janissaries was, and one of the best generals of the Ottoman Army under Sultan Mehmed II. George Kastriota (Skanderbeg), with whom Ballaban Badera would cross paths of history, was raised as a Janissary as well, under the same Devshirme system Ballaban Badera was developed. Ballaban and Skanderbeg Ballaban fought George Kastriota (Skanderbeg) in April 1465 close to Ohrid. The Albanians were victorious, but at a terrible cost: Ballaban Pasha showed his military prowess and thirteen highest ranking generals of George Kastriota were captured; among them was Moisi Arianit Golemi of Dibra, George Kastriota's, (Skanderbeg's), second in command. Moisi Arianit Golemi was the organizer of Skanderbeg's desertion from the Ottoman Court and subsequent return to Albania. Moisi Golemi was also the main political organizer and the heart and soul, if you will, of the Albanian Cause. Moisi Arianit Golemi, two of George Kastriota's nephews, and the other captured generals were sent to Constantinople, modern day Istanbul. George Kastriota offered great many captured Ottoman Pashas and great many Ottoman Prisoners, and enormous amounts of treasure in exchange for Moisi Golemi and the other generals, but Mehmet II refused: Moisi Golemi and the other captured Albanian Generals were all an invaluable prize to the Ottomans. Ballaban Badera had dealt a terrible blow to the Albanian resistance by capturing Moisi Golemi and high ranking George Kastriota's generals, and the effect of that terrible blow was to be felt with time, after the death of George Kastriota. Ballaban and Moisi Arianit Golemi As usual, Mehmet II made attempts to win alliances of the captured Albanian Generals against George Kastriota, but such attempts failed. Moisi Arianit Golemi was not presented with such an offer: He had previously approached the Sultan, had betrayed Skanderbeg, and had led an Ottoman Army against George Kastriota. In doing so, Moisi Golemi had hoped to save his people, and his country of Albania, from the utter devastation and the disastrous burden of the war against the Ottomans. Moisi Golemi calculated that it was better to accept Ottoman rule for a period in which the country could regain life and survive, so he decided to submit to the Ottomans and betray his Prince: George Kastriota. Under Ottoman command, Moisi Golemi, who was a very astute strategist, and who was man of great wisdom and visionary, saw, experienced, and perfectly understood the futility of his submission to the Ottomans for the benefit of his people and his country. He deserted the Ottomans and returned to George Kastriota. Eventually, George Kastriota pardoned Moisi Golemi. But there was no clemency expected from Mehmet II, who was an astute strategist himself and understood what Moisi Golemi strived for. Mehmet II would seek searing vengeance for Moisi Golemi's apostasy. The stage is set and Moisi Arianit Golemi suffered an ignominious death, and so did all the other twelve captured Albanian Generals: They were all skinned alive publicly in Istanbul. Ballaban's campaign (1465) =Ballaban's brother Constantine= Ballaban received further help from the Sultan and was sent leading Ottoman Armies against Skanderbeg once more, alongside an Albanian Pasha called Jakub Bej Arnauti, this time near Upper Dibra, in the Valley of Vaikal, but Ballaban, Jacub Bej Arnauti, and Ottoman Armies were again defeated. Jacub Bej Arnauti perished in that battle. During all these historical endeavors, Constantine, son of Milosch and Helena, brother of the boy Michael who had become Ballaban Badera, was a soldier under the command of George Kastriota fighting against the Ottoman Armies led by his brother. Milosch, father of the kidnapped boy Michael, was also a soldier under George Kastriota's command. Even though a Serbian, Milosch identified with the Albanian Cause having been left no choice by the policies of the Serbian Despot, ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, who would become either Moslem or Christian depending on policies of the moment. Milosch became sworn brothers (\\"vllam\\" in Albanian and \\"probratim\\" in Serbian), a widespread practice among Albanians and Serbs at the time,M. Edith Durham: High Albania, James M. Ludlow:The Captain of the Janizaries with the forester of Muzak Stresi, the Lord of Shkod√´r Milosch and the forester of De Stresses would foster Morsinia (named after Elizabeth Morsiney bride of King Sigismund of Hungary), the Albanian Heiress of De Stresses, daughter of Musache de Stresses and Mara Cernoviche who were murdered by Amesas Kastriota, the infamous nephew of George Kastriota (Skanderbeg). Amesas Kastriota had appropriated the vast estates of the De Stresses and had birth claims over the estates of the Kastriotas; Ballaban Badera saw the opportunity and organized the coronation of Amesas Kastiota as king of Albania, under vassalage of the Ottomans. George Kastriota (Skanderbeg) learned of the plans and gives the order that it must be stopped at any cost and all of Albania must take up arms. The Battle of Albulena ensued and Amesas Kastriota was captured. Ballban Badera later came as a commanding general of the army under Mehmet II during the Second Siege of Kruj√´ (1466), where he kept the city besieged for just under a year. In that battle, Ballaban Badera was killed by an arquebus shot to the neck by Gjergj Aleksi, a defender of the city and a hunter in his civilian life. After Ballaban's death, the Ottoman Army stationed in Albania lost its unity and was soon defeated. Popular culture Ballaban is one of the characters introduced in the Ballad of Heroes expansion pack to the game Legendary Warriors. He is portrayed as a very powerful warrior and a skilled commander, and a rival to Skanderbeg. He spends much of the game in Albania fighting Skanderbeg, so is not closely associated with the other Ottoman generals. He wields a pair of large cutlasses.

Having studied at the Stourbridge School of Art in his early years he joined the South Kensington School of Art (the first name of the current Royal College of Art) in 1883. Short also studied at the life class under Professor Fred Brown at the Westminster School of Art, and for a short time at the Schools of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours. Diana and Endymion, etching and mezzotint, printed in brown ink, 1891, after George Frederick Watts His real life-work now became that of an original and translator engraver. He was a keen student of the works of JMW Turner; and his etchings and mezzotints from Turner's Liber Studiorum (1885 seq.), examples of painstaking devotion and skill, were among his earliest successes, combining sympathetic study of the originals with a full knowledge of the resources of engraving and unwearied patience. Short received praise, constant advice and encouragement from John Ruskin, and the co-operation of students of Turner such as William George Rawlinson and the Revd. Stopford Augustus Brooke. After completing the series from the existing plates of Turner's \\"Liber\\" Short turned to the subjects which Turner and his assistants had left incomplete. Several remarkable plates resulted from this study, bearing the simple lettering \\"F. Short, Sculp., after J. M. W. Turner, R.A.,\\" which told little of the work expended on their production even before the copper was touched. He was consulted by Whistler for his expertise in printmaking and became friends. Short also reproduced in fine mezzotints several pictures of George Frederick Watts, \\"Orpheus and Eurydice,\\" \\"Diana and Endymion,\\" \\"Love and Death,\\" \\"Hope,\\" and the portrait of Lord Tennyson, all remarkable as faithful and imaginative renderings. His own fine quality as a watercolour painter made him also a sympathetic engraver of the landscapes of David Cox and Peter de Wint. A blue plaque marks Short's former home from 1898 to 1927 at 56 Brook Green, Brook Green, Hammersmith, London. Works After Peter De Wint, A Yorkshire Road, mezzotint, 1898 Coastal landscapes, river estuaries, meadows and foreshores in Devon, Norfolk, Sussex, Cornwall and the north of England captivated him for his entire working life. Short's subtle and reticent drawing of the receding lines of the low banks and shallows of river estuaries and flat shores is seen to perfection in many of his original etchings, mezzotints, and aquatints, notably \\"Low Tide and the Evening Star\\" and \\"The Solway at Mid-day.\\" Other notable plates are: *\\"Gathering the Flock on Maxwell Bank,\\" a soft-ground etching *\\"New moon over the Bure\\", aquatint *\\"The Ferry over the Blyth,\\" \\"Walberswick Pier,\\" soft-ground *\\"Dutch Greengrocery,\\" \\"Noon on the Zuider Zee,\\" \\"De-venter,\\" \\"Strolling Players at Lydd,\\" \\"The clay pit\\", and \\"Staithes,\\" all etchings *\\"A Wintry Blast on the Stourbridge Canal,\\" \\"Peveril's Castle,\\" and \\"Niagara Falls,\\" dry points *\\"The Curfew,\\" \\"A Span of old Battersea Bridge,\\" and \\"Sunrise on Whitby Scaur,\\" aquatints *\\"Moonrise, Ramsgate\\", \\"The Night Picket Boat at Hammersmith\\", \\"The Shadowed Valley\\", \\"Headlights over the Hill, Seaford\\", \\"The Angry Cloud, Seaford\\", \\"Exceat Farm and Hindover Hill, Alfriston near Seaford, Sussex\\", \\"Ebbtide, Putney Bridge,\\" \\"The Weary Moon was in the Wane,\\" \\"Solway Fishers,\\" \\"The Lifting Cloud,\\" and \\"A Slant of Light in Polperro Harbour,\\" mezzotints. As head of the Engraving School at the Royal College of Art, South Kensington from 1892-1920 and the inaugural Professor of Engraving from 1920 to 1924, Short had enormous influence on younger painter-etchers and engravers, including Myra Kathleen Hughes RE, Percival Gaskell RE, Margaret Kemp-Welch RE, Martin Hardin RE, Job Nixon RE, Robert Austin RA, PPRE, Mary Annie Sloane, ARE, Malcolm Osborne RA, PPRE, Henry Rushbury RA, RE, Dorothy Woollard RE, Frederick Griggs RA, RE, Stanley Anderson RA, RE, Constance Mary Pott, and Eli Marsden Wilson ARE amongst many others. [3] It is well recorded that Short was an outstanding and inspirational teacher. Blue plaque, 56 Brook Green Short was elected a member of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers in 1885, and took a prominent part in conducting its affairs, becoming assessor (vice-president) in 1902. In 1910 he succeeded Sir Francis Seymour Haden as its second president for 28 years, steering the society through the First World War and the end of the etching revival of the 1920s and its crash from 1929. Short received, amongst other distinctions, the gold medal for engraving at the Paris International Exhibition, 1889, and another gold medal for mezzotint (Rappel) 1900. In 1906 Short was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy, when membership as Associate Engraver was revived; and in 1911 he was elected a full Royal Academician, and also received a knighthood. His work as a watercolourist was recognised in 1917 when he was elected a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours. Short was Treasurer of the Royal Academy from 1919 to 1932. Short wrote several influential books on original printmaking: \\"On the Making of Etchings\\" was first published in 1888 and republished in 1911, 1912, 1951 and is still in print today. \\"British Mezzotints\\" from 1924 is a standard reference on original mezzotints. The Etched and Engraved Work of Frank Short, by Edward F Strange (1908), describes 285 plates by the artist. There are 346 known original works by Frank Short. In October 2018 a new book about Short was published. Short's Sussex explores the works he did in Sussex in his later life, and includes 40 images.

Sources on Northumbrian history in this period are limited, and so √Ülla's ancestry is not known and the dating of the beginning of his reign is questionable. In addition to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, √Ülla is also mentioned in Scandinavian sources, such as the Norse sagas. According to the latter, √Ülla captured the semi-legendary Swedish-Danish Viking leader Ragnar Lodbrok and put him to death in a pit of snakes. The historical invasion of Northumbria in 866 occurred in retaliation for Ragnar's execution, according to Ragnarssona √æ√°ttr (The Tale of Ragnar's Sons). While Norse sources claim that Ragnar's sons tortured √Ülla to death by the method of the blood eagle, Anglo-Saxon accounts maintain that he died in battle at York on 21 March 867. Concerning the Norse claim, Roberta Frank reviewed the historical evidence for the ritual in her Viking Atrocity and Skaldic Verse: The Rite of the Blood-Eagle, where she writes: \\"By the beginning of the nineteenth century, the various saga motifs‚Äîeagle sketch, rib division, lung surgery, and 'saline stimulant'‚Äîwere combined in inventive sequences designed for maximum horror.\\" She concludes that the authors of the sagas misunderstood alliterative kennings that alluded to leaving one's foes face down on the battlefield, their backs torn as carrion by scavenging birds. If this is to be believed, then it is easy to surmise that the mention of his death via the blood eagle is in fact a description of his death on the battlefield, which would make both accounts of his death consistent. Anglo-Saxon accounts √Ülla became king after Osberht (Osbryht) was deposed. The beginning of his reign is traditionally dated to 862 or 863 but evidence about Northumbrian royal chronology is unreliable prior to 867.Pagan, pp. 1‚Äì15 His reign may have begun as late as 866.Kirby, p. 196. Almost nothing is known of √Ülla's reign; Symeon of Durham states that √Ülla had seized lands at Billingham, Ileclif, Wigeclif, and Crece, which belonged to the church.Symeon of Durham, p. 654. While √Ülla is described in most sources as a tyrant and an illegitimate king,Symeon of Durham, p. 470. one source states that he was Osberht's brother.Kirby, p. 197. The Great Heathen Army, composed mostly of Danish, Norwegian and Frisian Vikings, landed in Northumbria in mid-866 and had captured York by 21 November.Higham, pp. 178‚Äì179; ASC s.a. 867. Subsequent events are described by historians such as Symeon of Durham, Asser and √Üthelweard in accounts that vary only in detail. According to the Historia Regum Anglorum, following the invasion of the Danes, the previous \\"dissension\\" between Osberht and √Ülla \\"was allayed by divine counsel\\" and other Northumbrian nobles. Osberht and √Ülla \\"having united their forces and formed an army, came to the city of York\\" on 21 March 867.Dated by Symeon of Durham, p. 654. A majority of the \\"shipmen\\" (Vikings) gave the impression of fleeing from the approaching Northumbrians. \\"The Christians, perceiving their flight and terror\\", attacked, but found that the Vikings \\"were the stronger party\\". Surrounded, the Northumbrians \\"fought upon each side with much ferocity\\" until both Osberht and √Ülla were killed. The surviving Northumbrians \\"made peace with the Danes\\". After this, the Vikings appointed a puppet king of Northumbria, named Ecgberht.Higham, p.179. According to an Anglo-Norman genealogy, √Ülla had a daughter named √Üthelthryth and through her was the grandfather of Eadwulf of Bamburgh, \\"King of the Northern English\\" who died in 913.McGuigan, pp. 24‚Äì25. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not name the Viking leaders, but it does state that \\"Hingwar and Hubba\\" (probably Ivar and Ubba) later killed King Edmund of East Anglia.ASC, s.a. 870. Ubba was also named as a leader of the army in Northumbria by Abbo of Fleury and by the Historia de Sancto Cuthberto. Symeon of Durham lists the leaders of the Viking army as \\"Halfdene [Halfdann], Inguar [Ingvar], Hubba, Beicsecg, Guthrun, Oscytell [Ketill], Amund, Sidroc and another duke of the same name, Osbern, Frana and Harold.\\"Symeon of Durham, p. 654. Whitelock, p. 227, discusses the leaders of the Great Army in various sources. Norse sources A modern artist's interpretation of the reputed execution of Ragnar Lodbrok According to Ragnarssona √æ√°ttr, the army that seized York in 866 was led by Hvitserk, Bj√∂rn Ironside, Sigurd Snake-in-the- Eye, Ivar the Boneless and Ubba, sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, who avenged his death by subjecting √Ülla to the blood eagle.Whitelock, p. 225ff. However, Anglo- Saxon sources claim that √Ülla and Osberht died in battle at York, with the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle stating that \\"both the kings were slain on the spot\\".ASC, s.a. 867. Ivar the Boneless, who plays a major role in both Norse and Anglo-Saxon accounts, is sometimes associated with the Viking leader √çmar (), a King of Dublin mentioned in the Irish annals. This is unlikely, however, as √çmar's father is usually said to be Gofraid of Lochlann and his brothers are usually named as Amla√≠b Conung and Auisle. As Dorothy Whitelock notes, the names √çvarr and √çmar were \\"not uncommon\\" in Norse societies.Whitelock, p. 227. Other Hector Boece relates that two Northumbrian princes, Osbrecht and Ella, took the castle at Stirling. Popular culture Aella, King of Northumbria, has a major supporting role in Geoffrey Chaucer‚Äôs The Man of Law's Tale. √Ülla was played by Frank Thring in the film The Vikings (1958) as the main antagonist.IMDb: The Vikings: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052365/ A character broadly based on √Ülla is played by Ivan Kaye in the History Channel's drama series Vikings (2013).IMDb: Vikings: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2306299/ The show gives no indication that this √Ülla had usurped his throne, and he is shown to have reigned in Northumbria for more than 15 years. The show portrays √Ülla as being executed by blood eagle following a battle which is said to stand \\"near York\\". The show also gave √Ülla a daughter, Judith, who takes the historical role of Osburh, as the mother of Alfred the Great. The character's name seems taken from Judith of Flanders, Alfred's stepmother, but doesn't share much more. In The Last Kingdom, a historical novel by Bernard Cornwell, √Ülla appears very briefly as a minor character at the beginning of the book. He, along with Osberht and Uhtred, a fictional Ealdorman of Bernicia, lead a Northumbrian army to repel invading Danes at York. The battle ends disastrously for the Northumbrians when the Norse army feigns a retreat, and √Ülla dies on the field. Notes References * Kirby, D.P., The Earliest English Kings.

The theorem was proven independently in 1907 by Frigyes Riesz and Ernst Sigismund Fischer. For many authors, the Riesz‚ÄìFischer theorem refers to the fact that the Lp spaces from Lebesgue integration theory are complete.  Modern forms of the theorem  The most common form of the theorem states that a measurable function on [-, ] is square integrable if and only if the corresponding Fourier series converges in the space L2. This means that if the Nth partial sum of the Fourier series corresponding to a square- integrable function f is given by :S_N f(x) = \\\\sum_{n=-N}^{N} F_n \\\\, \\\\mathrm{e}^{inx}, where Fn, the nth Fourier coefficient, is given by :F_n =\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^\\\\pi f(x)\\\\, \\\\mathrm{e}^{-inx}\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x, then :\\\\lim_{N \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\left \\\\Vert S_N f - f \\\\right \\\\_2 = 0, where \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\_2 is the L2-norm. Conversely, if \\\\\\\\{a_n\\\\\\\\} \\\\, is a two-sided sequence of complex numbers (that is, its indices range from negative infinity to positive infinity) such that :\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\left  a_n \\\\right \\\\vert^2 < \\\\infty, then there exists a function f such that f is square-integrable and the values a_n are the Fourier coefficients of f. This form of the Riesz‚ÄìFischer theorem is a stronger form of Bessel's inequality, and can be used to prove Parseval's identity for Fourier series. Other results are often called the Riesz‚ÄìFischer theorem . Among them is the theorem that, if A is an orthonormal set in a Hilbert space H, and x ‚àà H, then :\\\\langle x, y\\\\rangle = 0 for all but countably many y ‚àà A, and :\\\\sum_{y\\\\in A} \\\\langle x,y\\\\rangle^2 \\\\le \\\\x\\\\^2. Furthermore, if A is an orthonormal basis for H and x an arbitrary vector, the series :\\\\sum_{y\\\\in A} \\\\langle x,y\\\\rangle \\\\, y converges commutatively (or unconditionally) to x. This is equivalent to saying that for every Œµ > 0, there exists a finite set B0 in A such that : \\\\x - \\\\sum_{y\\\\in B} \\\\langle x,y\\\\rangle y \\\\ < \\\\varepsilon for every finite set B containing B0. Moreover, the following conditions on the set A are equivalent: * the set A is an orthonormal basis of H * for every vector x ‚àà H, ::\\\\x\\\\^2 = \\\\sum_{y\\\\in A} \\\\langle x,y\\\\rangle^2. Another result, which also sometimes bears the name of Riesz and Fischer, is the theorem that L2 (or more generally Lp, 0 < p ‚â§ ‚àû) is complete.  Example  The Riesz‚ÄìFischer theorem also applies in a more general setting. Let R be an inner product space consisting of functions (for example, measurable functions on the line, analytic functions in the unit disc; in old literature, sometimes called Euclidean Space), and let \\\\\\\\{\\\\varphi_n\\\\\\\\} be an orthonormal system in R (e.g. Fourier basis, Hermite or Laguerre polynomials, etc. ‚Äì see orthogonal polynomials), not necessarily complete (in an inner product space, an orthonormal set is complete if no nonzero vector is orthogonal to every vector in the set). The theorem asserts that if the normed space R is complete (thus R is a Hilbert space), then any sequence \\\\\\\\{c_n\\\\\\\\} that has finite ‚Ñì2 norm defines a function f in the space R. The function f is defined by f = \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sum_{k=0}^n c_k \\\\varphi_k , limit in R-norm. Combined with the Bessel's inequality, we know the converse as well: if f is a function in R, then the Fourier coefficients (f,\\\\varphi_n) have finite ‚Ñì2 norm.  History: the Note of Riesz and the Note of Fischer (1907)  In his Note, states the following result (translated here to modern language at one point: the notation L2([a, b]) was not used in 1907). :Let {œÜn } be an orthonormal system in L2([a, b]) and {an } a sequence of reals. The convergence of the series \\\\sum a_n^2 is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a function f such that :: \\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\varphi_n(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x = a_n :for every n. Today, this result of Riesz is a special case of basic facts about series of orthogonal vectors in Hilbert spaces. Riesz's Note appeared in March. In May, states explicitly in a theorem (almost with modern words) that a Cauchy sequence in L2([a, b]) converges in L2-norm to some function f in L2([a, b]). In this Note, Cauchy sequences are called \\"sequences converging in the mean\\" and L2([a, b]) is denoted by Œ©. Also, convergence to a limit in L2-norm is called \\"convergence in the mean towards a function\\". Here is the statement, translated from French: :Theorem. If a sequence of functions belonging to Œ© converges in the mean, there exists in Œ© a function f towards which the sequence converges in the mean. Fischer goes on proving the preceding result of Riesz, as a consequence of the orthogonality of the system, and of the completeness of L2. Fischer's proof of completeness is somewhat indirect. It uses the fact that the indefinite integrals of the functions gn in the given Cauchy sequence, namely : G_n(x) = \\\\int_a^x g_n(t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}t, converge uniformly on [a, b] to some function G, continuous with bounded variation. The existence of the limit g ‚àà L2 for the Cauchy sequence is obtained by applying to G differentiation theorems from Lebesgue's theory. Riesz uses a similar reasoning in his Note, but makes no explicit mention to the completeness of L2, although his result may be interpreted this way. He says that integrating term by term a trigonometric series with given square summable coefficients, he gets a series converging uniformly to a continuous function F with bounded variation. The derivative f of F, defined almost everywhere, is square summable and has for Fourier coefficients the given coefficients.  Completeness of Lp, 0 < p ‚â§ ‚àû  For some authors, notably Royden, the Riesz-Fischer Theorem is the result that Lp is complete: that every Cauchy sequence of functions in Lp converges to a function in Lp, under the metric induced by the p-norm. The proof below is based on the convergence theorems for the Lebesgue integral; the result can also be obtained for p \\\\in [1,\\\\infty] by showing that every Cauchy sequence has a rapidly converging Cauchy sub-sequence, that every Cauchy sequence with a convergent sub-sequence converges, and that every rapidly Cauchy sequence in Lp converges in Lp. When 1 ‚â§ p ‚â§ ‚àû, the Minkowski inequality implies that the space Lp is a normed space. In order to prove that Lp is complete, i.e. that Lp is a Banach space, it is enough (see e.g. Banach space#Definition) to prove that every series ‚àë un of functions in Lp(Œº) such that : \\\\sum \\\\u_n\\\\_p < \\\\infty converges in the Lp-norm to some function f ‚àà Lp(Œº). For p < ‚àû, the Minkowski inequality and the monotone convergence theorem imply that : \\\\int \\\\Bigl( \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty u_n \\\\Bigr)^p \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu \\\\le \\\\Bigl( \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\u_n\\\\_p \\\\Bigr)^p< \\\\infty, \\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{ hence } \\\\ \\\\ f = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty u_n is defined Œº-almost everywhere and f ‚àà Lp(Œº). The dominated convergence theorem is then used to prove that the partial sums of the series converge to f in the Lp-norm, : \\\\int \\\\left f - \\\\sum_{k=0}^{n} u_k \\\\right^p \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu \\\\le \\\\int \\\\left( \\\\sum_{\\\\ell > n} u_\\\\ell \\\\right)^p \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu \\\\rightarrow 0 \\\\text{ as } n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. The case 0 < p < 1 requires some modifications, because the p-norm is no longer subadditive. One starts with the stronger assumption that : \\\\sum \\\\u_n\\\\_p^p < \\\\infty and uses repeatedly that : \\\\left\\\\sum_{k=0}^n u_k \\\\right^p \\\\le \\\\sum_{k=0}^n u_k^p \\\\text{ when } p<1 The case p = ‚àû reduces to a simple question about uniform convergence outside a Œº-negligible set.

The island covers an area of circa . It is part of the South Funen Archipelago and has 6,111 inhabitants. The Danish national road 9 crosses the island. Until the municipality reform of 1970, the island retained its own municipality (sognekommune). Since 1970, it has been part of Svendborg Municipality. Before the 1960s, when the island became connected to Funen via the Svendborgsund Bridge and to Langeland via the Langeland Bridge, it was served by ferries from Svendborg to Vindeby and from Vemmen√¶s to Rudk√∏bing respectively. Until 2011 the public schools on the island consisted of two separate entities, Lundby Skole and Sundh√∏jskolen, but in 2011 they were merged into a single structure called T√•singeskolen with close to 800 pupils, by far the largest school in the entire municipality. The inhabitants of the island refer to themselves as T√∏singer. The local dialect called t√•singsk is still in use on the island, though not as common as in the past. Coat of arms of T√•singe, 1610, showing three garfish Etymology The meaning of the island's name (T√•singe) has been a matter of debate throughout the past couple of hundred years. The Kn√Ωtlinga saga mentions as a place name \\"√æ√≥rslundr\\" ('Thor's Grove') in its description of Denmark (chap. 32) and though it might refer to the island of T√•singe, it could also well be referring to another place near Odense The first time T√•singe clearly appears in the sources is in the Danish Census Book from around 1231, where it is called Thosland, and this designation seems to have been in proper use for a very long time, until the Age of Enlightenment, when antiquarians of the day because of the rudimentary state of etymology reinterpreted the name as 'Thorseng' or 'Thorsing', believing the name to mean 'Thors seng' or 'Thors eng' (lit. Thors bed/Thors meadow). This particular change in the island's name was seen in use for more than a century until gradually it changed into the now used form. Etymologists presently consider the prefix to be a root of old norse 'Th≈çs', meaning 'melting', 'thawing' and alike, possibly referring to the narrow strait of Svendborgsund which separates the island from Funen. The suffix '-land' is likely referring to the island itself (ref. the village name of Landet, central on the island), often used in Danish place names to characterize 'larger islands' (e.g. neighbouring Langeland). Geography and settlements T√•singe is historically divided into three parishes, corresponding to the three main villages on the island, Bregninge, at the northern part of the island, Landet at the central and Bjerreby at the southern part. The largest settlements besides these are Vindeby, Troense, Lundby and Strammelse. The north and northeasternmost part of the island, comprising Vindeby and Troense, has seen a large increase in demographics since the construction of the Svendborgsund Bridge and has virtually become a suburb of Svendborg, while the rest of the island in large parts has retained its rural and historical boundaries. In the north commuters who work in the Svendborg area and retired senior citizens live, while the rest of the island is mostly occupied by farming and agriculture. Sydfyns Flyveplads (T√•singe International Airport) , the only major aerodrome in the vincity, is situated on the western part of the island, providing trips for both business and recreational purposes.  History and attractions T√•singe has been a tourist destination for more than 100 years, the main attractions being the islands idyllic and surprisingly diverse nature as well as the many preserved historic buildings, often several hundreds of years old. The island itself also had its fair share of historical events. For several decades in the 14th century, the island (along with the whole of Funen and large parts of modern Denmark in general) was pawned to Holstein nobles, but was reunited with Denmark under the Danish king Valdemar Atterdag. During the Dano-Swedish War (1658‚Äì60) the island was overrun by Swedish troops, plundering the villages and leaving a devastated population, and still later, during the Dano-Swedish War of 1808‚Äì09 the island was frequently used for both camp and as a transport hub for the French-Spanish reinforcements. From the 17th century on, during the Age of absolutism, the first baron on Valdemars Castle (who had won the rights to the castle following the Battle of K√∏ge Bay) and his inheritors soon amassed as much land on the island as possible, effectively making the ever-sitting baron the de facto owner and feudal lord of almost the entire island, with the farmers remaining as tenants and copyholders, from the first part of the 18th century and right until the conversion of entailed estates into fee simple (Lensafl√∏sningen) 1919. T√•singe also had its own birkeret, presided by the baron as supreme judicial court as well (also until 1919). The population (3,600 in 1823) was all peasantry or sailors. A popular local anecdote, to put this in perspective, tells of the smith of Troense, who owned a small patch of land next to his house, and proudly announced that \\"Me and the Baron owns the entire island!\\" The male line of the barons Juel were however not necessarily only harsh lords, but introduced several new occupations and innovations to the island through the years, such as the (later) important apple farming, attempts at industrial cloth production (a kl√¶defabrik, 1752‚Äì58) and public schools (1795) among other things. Today, Valdemars Slot and surrounding area are among the most well known tourist spots on the island. The nearby village of Troense, situated slightly opposite Svendborg, picturesque with a view to Svendborgsund and neighboring Valdemars Slot, is particularly famed for its well-dimensioned and idyllic half timbered houses, build by wealthy sea captains and sailors through the golden period in the Age of Sails, when large sailing ships were being constructed on local shipyards and manned for faraway destinations. By the end of the 19th century, the Troense area was extremely popular among tourists (and still is), becoming easier to reach with modern transportation such as train and ferry, and with cheap accommodations and activities such as sea bathing, excursions, relaxation, social gatherings, etc. In the summer season, the visitors would typically book one of several private pensions, a large part of the village effectively becoming a resort town in the early decades of the 20th century. Among the more well known visitors were the composer Rued Langgaard and the writer Henri Nathansen. Troense is also known as the last place where Elvira Madigan and Sixten Sparre stayed in July 1889, before going on a \\"picnic with Death\\" in the nearby N√∏rreskov forest. This tragic, infamous incident has become an integral part of the island's lore. Today it is a tourist magnet as the couple is resting side by side in the churchyard at nearby Landet Kirke. The precise location of their murder-suicide in the forest of N√∏rreskov is marked by a granite boulder. About a kilometer west of Valdemars Castle, next to the road leading there, stands the so-called Ambrosius Oak, which is a 400-year-old giant oak with a circumference of around 7.5 meters. The name refers to the Danish rococo poet Ambrosius Stub (whose surname literally means '(tree) stub'), which was serving for more than a decade (1739‚Äì52) as a secretary and handyman to the baron of Valdemars Castle, and who is said to have often been sitting under the tree relaxing or writing. The highest point on the island is Bregninge Bakke (Bregninge Hill), ca. 70 m.a.s.l. (about 229.5 ft.). Bregninge Kirke is situated on top of the hill, and from its tower, in clear weather, it is possible to see large parts of the South Funen Archipelago. It is said that one can observe 28 islands, 65 churches and 20 manors from here. There is public access to the church in the daytime and (for a modest and optional fee) to the observation deck in the tower. The surrounding of the hill is designated as a protected habitat. In the porch of the church lies a romanesque headstone placed over a deacon inscribed with runes. Situated next to the church is T√•singe Museum (Museum of T√•singe), which serves as a local folk museum for the historic life of mainly the sailors of old time T√•singe, but also houses in a separate building a large collection of music instruments, note sheets etc., pertaining to traditional folk music. During the Napoleonic Wars a semaphore line tower, a branch of Storeb√¶ltstelegrafen, was placed further to the north on the hill. T√•singe and American emigrants From around 1850 until the first part of the 20th century, the prospects for many young people were to become tenants or copyholders on the island like their parents, without many possibilities of ascending in life. Accordingly, many emigrated to the United States. S√∏ren Lolk, an enlightened farmer, educator, photographer and vitalist from T√•singe visited some of the emigrated t√∏singer in the United States over four months in 1903 and photographed and collected evidence from them, before returning. The local archive of Landet keeps both Lolks collections and other evidence of the connections, and regularly receives requests from far and away relatives to once T√•singe born residents. 1967 film about Elvira Madigan Elvira Madigan and Sixten Sparre, whose tragic love affair has been portrayed in several works of art, were depicted in Bo Widerberg's 1967 film Elvira Madigan. However, none of the scenes in the film were shot on location on T√•singe, but rather in Klampenborg and Scania.

In the Twin Cities, Slave Raider had a sizeable following that were known as \\"The Raid\\". They opened for such 1980s bands as Ratt and Poison with the original lineup. The lead singer, Mike Findling, performed under the persona Chainsaw Caine (wielding and operating a chainsaw on stage as part of the act). Due to an injury in his youth he had a wandering eye that he felt was a distraction to the audience when he performed, so he began to wear an eye patch. As eye patches are often associated with pirates, the band took the name \\"Slave Raider\\" from the history of pirate lore. Other members of the band performed under the names Lance Sabin (guitar), Nicci Wikked (guitar), Letitia Rae (bass), and Rock (drums). In 1986, Slave Raider won all four Heavy Metal honors at the Minnesota Music Awards; that year Prince performed at the ceremony and Soul Asylum won for Best New Band. The band recorded three albums in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but were never able to make much of a dent in the glam metal scene of the time, due to the beginning of the grunge movement that has been attributed to the influence of their fellow Minnesotans, the Replacements. The band was dropped by its record label following their third album release in 1990 and broke up soon after that, with the band members going on to solo projects, with front man Chainsaw Caine forming the band U.K.I. (The Unstoppable Kamikazee Idiots). The original line up has periodically reunited since then to perform the occasional reunion show that is always \\"standing room only\\". The song \\"Youngblood\\", written by Slave Raider members and performed by Slave Raider, appeared in the 1994 movie entitled The Paper, which was nominated for an Oscar. Slave Raider's \\"Make Some Noise\\" (written by Slave Raider and D. Nagel) appeared in 1988's License to Drive.

The genus has a wide distribution, including Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America, and missing only from Australia. Some botanists split the genus into two genera on the basis of the catkin and fruit structure, restricting Myrica to a few species, and treating the others in Morella.Val√©rie Huguet, Manolo Gouy, Philippe Normand, Jeff F.

Common names include bayberry, bay-rum tree, candleberry, sweet gale, and wax-myrtle. The generic name was derived from the Greek word ŒºœÖœÅŒØŒ∫Œ∑ (myrike), meaning \\"fragrance\\".ŒúœÖœÅŒØŒ∫Œ∑ was also the Greek name for Tamarix species. Characteristics Myrica faya fruit The species vary from 1 m shrubs up to 20 m trees; some are deciduous, but the majority of species are evergreen. The roots have nitrogen-fixing bacteria which enable the plants to grow on soils that are very poor in nitrogen content. The leaves are spirally arranged, simple, 2‚Äì12 cm long, oblanceolate with a tapered base and broader tip, and a crinkled or finely toothed margin. The flowers are catkins, with male and female catkins usually on separate plants (dioecious). The fruit is a small drupe, usually with a wax coating. The type species, Myrica gale, is holarctic in distribution, growing in acidic peat bogs throughout the colder parts of the Northern Hemisphere; it is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 m tall. The remaining species all have relatively small ranges, and are mostly warm- temperate. Myrica faya (Morella faya), native to the volcanic islands of the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, has become an invasive species on the Hawaiian volcanoesWarren L. Wagner, Derral R. Herbst, and Sy H. Sohmer. Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaii, Revised Edition, 1999. Bishop Museum Press: Hololulu. where it was introduced in the 19th century; its ability to fix nitrogen makes it very well adapted to growing on low-nitrogen volcanic soils. The wax coating on the fruit is indigestible for most birds, but a few species have adapted to be able to eat it, notably the yellow-rumped warbler and tree swallow in North America. As the wax is very energy-rich, this enables the yellow-rumped warbler to winter further north in cooler climates than any other American warbler if bayberries are present. The seeds are then dispersed in the birds' droppings. Myrica species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail, emperor moth, and winter moth as well as the bucculatricid leaf-miners Bucculatrix cidarella, B. myricae (feeds exclusively on M. gale) and B. paroptila and the Coleophora case-bearers C. comptoniella, C. pruniella, and C. viminetella. Uses The wax coating on the fruit of several species, known as bayberry wax, has been used traditionally to make candles. It was used for that purpose by the Robinson family in the novel The Swiss Family Robinson. The foliage of Myrica gale is a traditional insect repellent, used by campers to keep biting insects out of tents. Several species are also grown as ornamental plants in gardens. The fruit of Myrica rubra is an economically important crop in China, sold fresh, dried, canned, for juice, and for alcoholic beverages. Myrica is used to spice beer and snaps in Denmark.

Biography The band was formed in 1987 by Bob Bagchus and Tonny Brookhuis. Eric Daniels was found as a second guitarist and Chuck Colli joined on vocals and bass guitar; this line up released the Enter the Domain demo. In March 1989, Colli was replaced by Theo Loomans and the band recorded the Crush the Cenotaph demo. Brookhuis then left the band and the remaining three recorded Embrace the Death, an album which was never released because of label problems. After leaving Pestilence in the early 1990s, Martin van Drunen joined Asphyx and the band signed to Century Media Records. After the release of their first album, The Rack, they went on a European tour with Entombed, followed by a tour with Bolt Thrower and Benediction in 1992. Shortly after the recording of the second album, Last One on Earth, van Drunen left the band, to be replaced by Ron van der Pol. Eventually Bagchus left the band as well and was replaced by Sander van Hoof. In 1994, the band released its third, self-titled album, but broke up shortly afterward. In 1995, Loomans and Bagchus reformed Asphyx and recorded God Cries. Around the same time, the Embrace the Death album, recorded in 1990, was released. Nevertheless, the band split up again after the release. In 1998, Loomans died when a train hit his car. The circumstances suggest it was an act of suicide. Some time later, Soulburn was founded by Bagchus and Daniels and, together with Pentacle singer and bass guitarist Wannes Gubbels, they recorded Feeding on Angels. In 1999, they renamed the project Asphyx and recorded the On the Wings of Inferno album with the same line up. However, Asphyx disbanded again in 2000. In January 2007, the band re-united with van Drunen, Gubbels, Paul Baayens and Bagchus. They did not intend to record a new album, but focused only on live performances. However, in January 2008, they recorded a cover of a Celtic Frost song and a new song called \\"Death... The Brutal Way\\". In July 2008, they announced that new material was being prepared. Death...The Brutal Way was released in June 2009 by Century Media. It was released in North America by Ibex Moon Records on August 18, 2009, quickly becoming the distributor's best seller. On 30 November 2011 Asphyx finished recording on their eighth studio album entitled Deathhammer which was set to be released on 27 February 2012 in Europe and 28 February 2012 in North America via Century Media Records. In March 2014, founding member Bob Bagchus parted ways from the band and leaving the band with no original members. He was replaced by Stefan H√ºskens as the new drummer. On 14 October 2015, Asphyx made an announcement they are working on a new album at the end of November for the long-awaited Deathhammer follow up and begin their first tour at Latin America.

In Greek mythology, the eponymous forefather of the Ionians is similarly called Ion, a son of Apollo.

Aleksei Isaev began work under Leonid Dushkin during World War II, on an experimental rocket-powered interceptor plane, the BI-1. In 1944 he formed his own design bureau to engineer liquid-propellant engines. After abandoning the heavy, complex and undercooled German engine designs, Russia's principal engine designer Valentin Glushko turned to Isaev's innovations: thin-walled copper combustion chambers backed by steel support, anti-oscillation baffle to prevent chugging, and the flat injector plate with mixing-swirling injectors. The latter was an enormous simplification of the \\"plumbing nightmare\\" of the V-2 engine, because it avoided the need for separate fuel lines to each sprayer. Staged combustion (–ó–∞–º–∫–Ω—É—Ç–∞—è —Å—Ö–µ–º–∞) was first proposed by Alexey Isaev in 1949. Although his inventions influenced the design of Glushko's large engines, Isaev was better known for building efficient small rockets. He designed engines for the Soviet anti-missile and anti-aircraft rockets, and in 1951, his engine powered the R-11 Zemlya short-range missile, later named the Scud.

This stack grows downward from its origin. The stack pointer points to the current topmost datum on the stack. A push operation decrements the pointer and copies the data to the stack; a pop operation copies data from the stack and then increments the pointer. Each procedure called in the program stores procedure return information (in yellow) and local data (in other colors) by pushing them onto the stack. Stacks in computing architectures are regions of memory where data is added or removed in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner. In most modern computer systems, each thread has a reserved region of memory referred to as its stack. When a function executes, it may add some of its local state data to the top of the stack; when the function exits it is responsible for removing that data from the stack. At a minimum, a thread's stack is used to store the location of a return address provided by the caller in order to allow return statements to return to the correct location. The stack is often used to store variables of fixed length local to the currently active functions. Programmers may further choose to explicitly use the stack to store local data of variable length. If a region of memory lies on the thread's stack, that memory is said to have been allocated on the stack, i.e. stack-based memory allocation.  Advantages and disadvantages  Because the data is added and removed in a last-in-first- out manner, stack-based memory allocation is very simple and typically much faster than heap-based memory allocation (also known as dynamic memory allocation) typically allocated via malloc. Another feature is that memory on the stack is automatically, and very efficiently, reclaimed when the function exits, which can be convenient for the programmer if the data is no longer required. (The same applies to longjmp if it moved to a point before the call to happened.) If however, the data needs to be kept in some form, then it must be copied from the stack to the heap before the function exits. Therefore, stack based allocation is suitable for temporary data or data which is no longer required after the current function exits. A thread's assigned stack size can be as small as only a few bytes on some small CPUs. Allocating more memory on the stack than is available can result in a crash due to stack overflow. This is also why functions that use are usually prevented from being inlined: should such a function be inlined into a loop, the caller would suffer from an unanticipated growth in stack usage, making an overflow much more likely. Stack-based allocation can also cause minor performance problems: it leads to variable-size stack frames, so that both stack and frame pointers need to be managed (with fixed-size stack frames, one of these is redundant). This is usually much less costly than calling and anyway. In particular, if the current function contains both calls to alloca and blocks containing variable length local data then a conflict occurs between alloca's attempts to increase the current stack frame until the current function exits versus the compiler's need to place local variables of variable length in the same location in the stack frame. This conflict is typically resolved by creating a separate chain of heap storage for each call to alloca (see: https://code.woboq.org/gcc/libiberty/alloca.c.html). The chain records the stack depth at which each allocation occurs, subsequent calls to alloca in any function trim this chain down to the current stack depth to eventually (but not immediately) free any storage on this chain. A call to alloca with an argument of zero can also be used to trigger the freeing of memory without allocating any more such memory. As a consequence of this conflict between alloca and local variable storage, using alloca might be no more efficient than using malloc.  System interface  Many Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows implement a function called for dynamically allocating stack memory in a way similar to the heap-based \`malloc\`. A compiler typically translates it to inlined instructions manipulating the stack pointer, similar to how variable-length arrays are handled. Although there is no need to explicitly free the memory, there is a risk of undefined behavior due to stack overflow. The function was present on Unix systems as early as 32/V (1978), but is not part of Standard C or any POSIX standard. A safer version of called , which reports errors, exists on Microsoft Windows. It requires the use of . gnulib provides an equivalent interface, albeit instead of throwing an SEH exception on overflow, it delegates to when an overlarge size is detected. A similar feature can be emulated using manual accounting and size-checking, such as in the uses of in glibc. Some processor families, such as the x86, have special instructions for manipulating the stack of the currently executing thread. Other processor families, including PowerPC and MIPS, do not have explicit stack support, but instead rely on convention and delegate stack management to the operating system's application binary interface (ABI).

From 1799 until his premature death in 1814 he kept an extensive diary which is the most complete record ever printed of the daily life of a fur trader in the north. His journals were an account of \\"personal doings\\", but cannot be considered a diary of inward thoughts. These journals cover everything that happened to him in a most matter-of-fact manner and have yielded much material for historians and other researchers of that time period in North American history. In 1792, with his well-known uncle of the same name, Henry became a partner in the North West Company and he was later a wintering partner of the XY Company and the Pacific Fur Company. His diaries record his travels from Lake Superior to the Pacific Ocean. In Canada, he travelled through Ontario, Manitoba, Assiniboia, Keewatin, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. In the United States of America his travels took him through areas that comprise the modern states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. He encountered many different tribes of Indians, and in the north saw much of the Chippewas, the three tribes of the Blackfeet, the Crees, Assiniboines, Sioux, Sarcees, and others. In the south, he reached the Mandans, the Minitari, the Rees, and even the Cheyennes, south of the Missouri River. On the west coast he saw many tribes of the Columbia River, such as the Wanapum. In 1800, during the building of Pembina Post, Red River district, the Indians were extremely inquisitive about Henry's doings with pen and paper. On 27 August 1800, Henry wrote \\"I told them that I kept an exact account of the Indians behaviour [also] every word they said was put down....every Indian would be rewarded according to his behaviour.\\" In 1808, he travelled with David Thompson from Lake Winnipeg to Fort Vermilion, Alberta.

ARMING CIVILIANS FOR COUNTER-TERRORISM: TURKEY‚ÄôS VILLAGE GUARD SYSTEM Originally they were set up and funded by the Turkish state in the mid-1980s under the direction of Turgut √ñzal. Their stated purpose was to act as a local militia in towns and villages, protecting against attacks and reprisals from the insurgents of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The rationale behind the establishment of the village guards was that it would be helpful to the Turkish Army to have an additional force of people who knew Turkish Kurdistan and the language in order to assist in military operations against the PKK.UNHCR/ACCORD: 6th European Country of Origin Information Seminar Vienna, 13 ‚Äì 14 November 2000 ‚Äì Final report The force consists of approximately 90,000 village guards in total.  Background  The Village Guards were levied according to an amendment to the \\"Law of Temporary Village Guards\\" of 1924, which was introduced due to the lack of security officers after the war of independence. The amendment was approved by the Turkish parliament in March 1985, after the first major confrontations between the PKK and Turkey. There are separate classifications of paid and voluntary village guards, with both being allowed the bear weapons. In 1985 there were 3,679 weapons given to 7,933 village guards. From 1985 to 1990, recruitment of village guards was mainly accomplished by negotiating with tribal chieftain, with the tribes being awarded greater autonomy rights in exchange for their services.  History  The establishment of the Village Guards resulted into a change of policy by the PKK, who reorganized its military wing at the 3rd party congress in October 1986 and made the joining of its military wing the Kurdistan People's Liberation Force compulsory. The village guards are frequently targeted by PKK militants as they are seen as \\"traitors\\". During the ongoing conflict since 2015, 62 village guards have been killed. Turkey's PKK Conflict: The Rising Toll The village guards received an attractive salary. At times they received a monthly pay of around $230 US Dollars while at the same time the annual salary was $400. The Village Guards gained wealth through smuggling over the Turkish-Iraqi border for which they had immunity. It was even stated by Van Bruinessen that some village guards were recruited among known smugglers. The amount of village guards surged from 18,000 to 63,000 between 1990 and 1994. In 2012 the Turkish Government indicated that it was planning to phase out the village guard system. But as the conflicts started again in 2014, the village guards assumed the local guiding and local protection operations. This time, the state not only accepts volunteers. Now, in order to deal with the unemployment in the region, the government hires young people who just finished military service as commando, to become a village guard. Except for women volunteers, it became difficult to be a village guard since 2014, too many applications were made in the last years. The Gendarmerie General Command brought new conditions to become a village guard after announcing 25,000 people will be employed as village guards in 2019. Accepting to become a village guard is a largely voluntary process, although there are exceptions. In a report by the Human Rights Watch, it is mentioned that if the villagers did not want to become village guards, it was likely that their settlement was surrounded by troops loyal to the Turkish Government and then the village would be destroyed and evacuated.  Training and recruitment  = Selection and Assignment of Security Guards: = The applications made by those who want to be appointed as Security Village Guard are examined by the governorships or district governorships in accordance with the Temporary Village Guards Regulation and Directive, those who are deemed appropriate to be appointed as Security Village Guard are assigned to the villages or settlements they reside with the approval of the Provincial Governor. Voluntary Security Guards (GGK) can be given priority to one of the children of the Security Guards, who are martyred or disabled to work in the fight against terrorism, those who died of death and who left their duties after completing their service term, or one of their siblings if they do not have children. The newly recruited Security Village Guards receive two-week basic training at the beginning, and at least two-day in-service training every six months.Village guards patrolling = What are the Requirements for Becoming a Village Guardian? = Be a citizen of Turkey. * Being literate in Turkish. * Having completed military service, not less than 22 years old and not over 60 years old. * Not to be deprived of public rights. * Not being convicted of a crime . * Not being involved in destructive, divisive and reactionary activities being well-mannered and not fighting with everyone. * Not having moodiness like drunkenness. * To be residing in the village where he / she will work. * To certify with a medical report that there is no physical or mental illness or bodily injury that prevents him from performing his duty. * Security Guards must attend training programs. = How Much Salary Do Village Guards Get? = The Security Guards were getting a 2020 TL salary in 2019. In 2020, the salary of the Security Guards, together with the compensation, was 2 thousand 243 TL.  Human rights  Autonomy came also with an immunity for crimes even for rapes or killings. The right to bear army often lead to solving disputes between a village guard and a \\"terrorist\\" in the killing of the latter. At times also minor conflicts during the soccer game of children or in business relations were solved this way. Whilst by not officially endorsed by the Turkish Government, some village guards are reported to have been involved in \\"disappearances\\", extrajudicial executions and torture. The Turkish government reported that the Village Guards were implicated in attacks on Kurdish internally displaced persons returning to their villages after forced evacuation. During the conflict Turkish government used village guard system to distinguish ‚Äúloyal‚Äù and ‚Äúdisloyal‚Äù citizens and backed the system with material benefits and coercion. A report by the Turkish Parliament in 1995 confirmed that village guards have been involved in not just these but a wide range of illegal activities, including killing, extortion, and drug smuggling. Human Rights Watch has stated that for years they have received reports of \\"violations by village guards‚Äîmurders, rapes, robberies, house destruction, and illegal property occupation, among others\\". They add however that not all of these reports have been confirmed first hand. People who refused to join the village guards have had their homes burned,Amnesty International ‚Äì 1996 ‚Äì Turkey Campaign or have been forced to leave and their homes and property seized. They have endured sexual assault and humiliation by the Turkish security forces.Council of Europe ‚Äì Report ‚Äì Humanitarian situation of the Kurdish refugees and displaced persons in South- East Turkey and North Iraq There have been some attempts by the Turkish authorities to compensate people who have lost property in this way. A member of the Turkish Parliament, √únal Erkan and former governor of some areas of south-eastern Turkey states that, \\"village guards often operated outside the control of the gendarmerie, and that many villagers faced pressure to enter the system\\". The Turkish Interior Ministry estimated that 296 murders were committed by village guards between 1985 and 1996. In a subsequent report in 2006, the Ministry indicated that some 5,000 village guards were involved in criminal activities. The journalist Gottfried Stein relates former lieutenant in the Turkish Army Yener Soylu as describing the process of persuading some villagers to join the village guards:Stein, Gottfried.

Located about south of the Austrian capital Vienna, it is chiefly known for the Laxenburg castles, which, beside Sch√∂nbrunn, served as the most important summer retreat of the Habsburg monarchs.  History  Laxenburg became a Habsburg possession in 1333. Duke Albert III (1349‚Äì1395) had a hunting lodge erected here (today called Altes Schloss) and vested the settlement with market rights. The castle again decayed afterwards, until in the 17th century it was restored at the behest of Emperor Leopold I. Rebuilt in a Baroque style by the master builder Lodovico Burnacini, it became the centre of extended gardens and pleasure grounds. Blauer Hof From 1710 onwards the Baroque Blauer Hof (Blue Court), also named Neues Schloss (New Castle), was built according to plans designed by Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt as the residence of the Habsburg vice- chancellor Friedrich Karl von Sch√∂nborn. Later Empress Maria Theresa acquired the palace and from 1756 onwards had it lavishly rebuilt by her court architect Nicol√≤ Pacassi with a Rococo interior. Laxenburg became the favourite residence of Maria Theresa and her descendants. The parish church of Laxenburg was erected vis-√†-vis between 1693 and 1703 by Carlo Antonio Carlone. Emperor Leopold I himself laid the founding stone. Consecrated in 1699, construction works continued between 1703 and 1724 supervised by the architect Matthias Steinl. It was the first building north of the Alps containing swung facade components (characteristics of the High Baroque architecture). After 1780, the castle parks were re-arranged as an English landscape garden. It contains several artificial ponds, and, on an island, Franzensburg Castle, named after emperor Francis I of Austria. Franzensburg Castle The current political municipality was established after the 1848 revolutions. In 1854, Emperor Francis Joseph and his consort Elisabeth spent their honeymoon in Laxenburg. Two of their children, Gisela and Crown Prince Rudolf, were born here. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1919, the city of Vienna took over the war-damaged castle. Since then, the city of Vienna became the property owner of the park area. After the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany in 1938, the municipality of Laxenburg temporarily was incorporated into the city of Greater Vienna. After World War II, castles and park were seized by Soviet occupation forces. Upon the 1955 Austrian State Treaty, the place became independent again and returned to the state of Lower Austria. Plans to hold the 1967 World's fair in Laxenburg failed. Since 1973, the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), a non- governmental research organization with about 200 employees, has been located in the castle. The International Anti-Corruption Academy (IACA) is also headquartered in Laxenburg, since it was established in 2010 at the historic Palais Kaunitz-Wittgenstein. The International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) and the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) both have their respective secretariat in the city.

In addition to reducing the drying effect of wind, row cover can provide a limited amount of warming by the same effect that cold frames, greenhouses, and polytunnels produce, creating a microclimate for the plants. Material Cloches in a walled garden. Commercially available row cover is usually a lightweight synthetic, such as clear plastic (polyethylene) or spunbonded polyester. It is placed directly above rows of crops on a supporting framework‚Äîoften, on wire hoops to form a low tunnel‚Äîand usually left in place for several weeks until crops are well-established. Floating row cover is extremely lightweight row cover fabric that can be placed directly over plants, without need for a supporting framework, instead being simply anchored to the ground against wind. Another form of lightweight row cover is made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and is a knitted fabric. It is strong, with an claimed life of eight years. It has a low shading effect (16%) and allows natural air flow and rain and water penetration. It also protects from light frosts, strong winds and hail. It is used on low tunnels. It comes in a variety of widths and lengths. A protective tunnel formed with row cover is sometimes called a cloche,There is some usage of the term cloche to include row cover tunnels, or other season extension covering (as in this somewhat ambiguous Rodale gardening encyclopedia definition) although a cloche, or bell jar, commonly refers to a distinct type of protective covering, made of glass or plastic, usually placed over individual plants. No longer in general use, a type of cloche employed in Europe involved panes of glass attached with wire to form continuous tunnels to protect rows of crops.

One practice of sex magic is using sexual arousal or orgasm with visualization of a desired result. A premise posited by sex magicians is the concept that sexual energy is a potent force that can be harnessed to transcend one's normally perceived reality. Paschal Beverly Randolph Paschal Beverly Randolph The earliest known practical teachings of sex magic in the Western world come from 19th-century American occultist Paschal Beverly Randolph, under the heading of The Mysteries of Eulis: > If a man has an intelligent and loving wife, with whom he is in complete > accord, he can work out the problems [of how to achieve magical results] by > her aid. They are a radical soul-sexive series of energies...The rite is a > prayer in all cases, and the most powerful [that] earthly beings can > employ...it is best for both man and wife to act together for the attainment > of the mysterious objects sought. Success in any case requires the adjuvancy > of a superior woman. THIS IS THE LAW! A harlot or low woman is useless for > all such lofty and holy purposes, and just so is a bad, impure, passion- > driven apology for a man. The woman shall not be one who accepts rewards for > compliance; nor a virgin; or under eighteen years of age; or another's wife; > yet must be one who hath known man and who has been and still is capable of > intense mental, volitional and affectionate energy, combined with perfect > sexive and orgasmal ability; for it requires a double crisis to succeed... > The entire mystery can be given in very few words, and they are: An upper > room; absolute personal, mental, and moral cleanliness both of the man and > wife. An observance of the law just cited during the entire term of the > experiment  49 days. Formulate the desire and keep it in mind during the > whole period and especially when making the nuptive prayer, during which no > word may be spoken, but the thing desired be strongly thought... Randolph himself was greatly influenced by the work of English Rosicrucian and scholar of phallicism, Hargrave Jennings. Ida Craddock In the latter part of the 19th century, sexual reformer Ida Craddock published several works dealing with sacred sexuality, most notably Heavenly Bridegrooms and Psychic Wedlock. Aleister Crowley reviewed Heavenly Bridegrooms in the pages of his journal The Equinox, stating that it was: > ...one of the most remarkable human documents ever produced, and it should > certainly find a regular publisher in book form. The authoress of the MS. > claims that she was the wife of an angel. She expounds at the greatest > length the philosophy connected with this thesis. Her learning is enormous. > ...This book is of incalculable value to every student of occult matters. No > Magick library is complete without it. Sexual techniques from Craddock's Psychic Wedlock were later reproduced in Sex Magick by O.T.O. initiate Louis T. Culling, a disciple of C.F. Russell.Culling, Louis T. Sex Magick. St. Paul, MN: Llewellyn Publications, 1988. Ordo Templi Orientis Carl Kellner, the founder of Ordo Templi Orientis, (O.T.O.), claimed to have learned the techniques of sex magic from three adepts in this art.The Magical World of Aleister Crowley, p. 78 Beginning in 1904, references to these secrets, Kellner, and the O.T.O. began appearing in \\"an obscure German masonic periodical called Oriflamme.\\" In 1912, the editors of Oriflamme announced: =Aleister Crowley= Golden Dawn garb Aleister Crowley became involved with Theodor Reuss and Ordo Templi Orientis following the publication of The Book of Lies between 1912 and 1913.King, Francis The Magical World of Aleister Crowley p. 80 According to Crowley's account, Reuss approached him and accused him of having revealed the innermost (sexual) secret of O.T.O. in one of the cryptic chapters of this book. When it became clear to Reuss that Crowley had done so unintentionally, he initiated Crowley into the IX¬∞ (ninth degree) of O.T.O. and appointed him \\"Sovereign Grand Master General of Ireland, Iona and all the Britains.\\" While the O.T.O. included, from its inception, the teaching of sex magick in the highest degrees of the Order, when Crowley became head of the Order, he expanded on these teachings and associated them with different degrees as follows:Crowley, Aleister.

Arnold Krumm-Heller According to Samael Aun Weor, Arnold Krumm-Heller taught sexual magic without ejaculation.  Maria de Naglowska  Maria de Naglowska (1883‚Äì1936) was a Russian occultist, mystic, author and journalist who wrote and taught about sexual magical ritual practices while also being linked with the Parisian surrealist movement. She established and led an occult society known as the Confr√©rie de la Fl√®che d'or (Brotherhood of the Golden Arrow) in Paris from 1932 to 1935. In 1931, she compiled, translated and published in French a collection of published and unpublished writings by American occultist Paschal Beverly Randolph on the subject of sexual magic and magic mirrors. Her translation and publication of Randolph's previously little known ideas and teachings was the source of Randolph's subsequent influence in European magic. She augmented the text with what she claimed were some of his oral teachings. The following year, she published a semi-autobiographical novella, Le Rite sacr√© de l'amour magique (The Sacred Ritual of Magical Love.) Later that year, she also published La Lumi√®re du sexe (The Light of Sex), a mystic treatise and guide to sexual ritual that was required reading for those seeking to be initiated into the Brotherhood of the Golden Arrow. Her later book on advanced sexual magic practices, Le Myst√®re de la pendaison (The Hanging Mystery) details her advanced teachings on the Third Term of the Trinity and the spiritually transformation power of sex, and the practice of erotic ritual hanging and other sensory deprivation practices. Beyond occult subjects, Naglowska also influenced the surrealist art movement. The Lexique succinct de l'√©rotisme in the catalog of the 1959 International Surrealist Exhibition in Paris noted her important influence. Surrealist Sarane Alexandrian wrote a detailed account of her life.

The organization was formed in August 2002 by attorney and transgender civil rights activist, Dean Spade. The project was named for Sylvia Rivera, a transgender activist and veteran of the 1969 Stonewall Riots, who died the same year that SRLP was formed.  Founding  In February 2002, Spade was followed into the bathroom by a police officer. In an essay about trans public bathroom use and bathroom bills, Spade describes his experience: \\"As I was looking to see what stalls were open, he approached and asked for my ID. I explained that I was in the right bathroom, that I am transgender and I understood the confusion, but I was just going to use the bathroom and leave.\\" The officer questioned his gender and arrested him. The court assigned attorney asked personal, invasive questions during the first meeting, which made Spade fear what the trial would hold: \\"[Spade's attorney] came to the cell, read the police statement on my court documents, and asked why I was in the 'men's' room. I explained that I am transgender and I customarily use 'men's' rooms, and that I go by a male name and pronoun. He wrinkled up his face and said with a very dismissive and disapproving attitude, 'That is your business. I don't care.' He then asked me what my genitalia are.\\" The charges against him were thrown out, but he was left with mixed feelings. He was upset by the transphobia that caused this to happen, but felt optimistic about what the media coverage may bring. Months later, he formed the Sylvia Rivera Law Project to help others who were in discriminatory situations like he was in. Goals The project has released this mission statement: The goals of the organization are to provide access to legal services for low-income transgender, intersex, and gender non-conforming people, provide public education and policy reform to end state-sanctioned discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression. The organization also aims to build a collective organization that develops the leadership of low-income transgender, intersex, and gender non-conforming people of color while participating in the larger movement for racial, social, and economic justice. As Dean Spade himself puts it, \\"Sylvia Rivera Law Project (SRLP) is committed to providing people with some basic services. We see providing survival services as central to our goal of building racial and economic justice- centered trans resistance.\\" A large part of the group's work revolves around prison reform, as detention makes up the final step of the criminal justice system. SRLP has a variety of projects in the works, including advocating against solitary confinement, profiting off incarceration, and new jails being built in New York, as well as promoting safe healthcare for LGBT+ incarcerated folks.  Areas of work  SRLP's organizers, lawyers and grassroots activists work on a variety of issues, including prison abolition, reform of gender- segregated facilities, and identity documents, as well as name changes, health care advocacy, ID replacement, criminal history, prisoner rights, access to gender affirming garments and hormones in prison, immigration relief such as asylum or U/T Visas, naturalization, and other legal and social services. Much of the SRLP's work centers around legislative reform, especially surrounding prisons and what sends people there. Founder Dean Spade is particularly interested in the intersection of race and sexuality/gender expression, and crime related to these issues. As he puts it, hate crime laws \\"focus on punishment and have not bee shown to actually prevent bias-motivated violence... Hate criminology laws strengthen and legitimize the criminal punishment system, a system that targets the very people that these laws are supposedly passed to protect. The criminal punishment system has the same biases (racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, xenophobia) that advocates of these laws want to eliminate.\\"  Impact  Rodriguez v. Johnson, et al. 20-year-old transgender woman Alyssa Rodriguez was incarcerated at the Red Hook Residential Center under the Office of Children and Family Services in Dutchess County, New York. Under their care, Rodriguez was denied her hormonal treatment, and disciplined for her effeminate gender expression. SRLP, in association with Lambda Legal, won Rodriguez a substantial sum of cash, in return for the emotional distress imposed on her.  Core Values/Vision  SRLP members acknowledge that the system is the problem with regards to discrimination towards gender. Oppressed individuals must fight for their equality by sticking together, working towards this common goal of justice. This can only be done by themselves as the system has proved to be an unreliable source in maintaining equal rights for all individuals, regardless of race or gender. With this in mind, members work with all oppressed communities in obtaining the shared goal of equality. Members believe that this work will further equality for our community as a whole versus for simply one oppressed group. SRLP maintains an equalized work environment that does not place members in a system of hierarchy. Gabriel Arkles, Pooja Gehi, and Elana Redfield, three lawyers employed by the SRLP, came together and wrote an article entitled \\"The Role of Lawyers in Trans Liberation: Building a Transformative Movement for Social Change,\\" in which they lay out ways that lawyers can impact the lives of trans folks, especially through legislation. A major theme of this article is that affording LGBTQ+ folks the same rights as heterosexual, cisgender folks is almost as harmful as our current system, since the problems lie within capitalism itself, nor just the difference in rights under capitalism: \\"A legal strategy that merely extends existing rights and values to include gays, lesbians, bisexual people, and transgender people without looking at the racism, classism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and corruption that maintain capitalism will only protect the structures of empire that oppress poor people and people of color.\\" See alsoLGBT rights in the United States *List of LGBT rights organizations *List of transgender-related topics *The New York Foundation  References  External linksSRLP homepage Transgender law in the United States Transgender organizations in the United States LGBT culture in New York City LGBT political advocacy groups in the United States Non- profit organizations based in New York City Legal advocacy organizations in the United States ","title":"Sylvia Rivera Law Project"},{"id":"1836337","text":"Badroulbadour/ Badr ul-Badour/ Badr al-Badur ( ', \\"full moon of full moons\\") is a princess whom Aladdin married in The Story of Aladdin; or, the Wonderful Lamp.

It is the only extant (living) species in the genus Comptonia, although a number of extinct species are placed in the genus. Comptonia peregrina is native to eastern North America, from southern Quebec, east to Nova Scotia, south to the extreme north of Georgia, and west to Minnesota. The common name is sweetfern or sweet-fern (although it is not a fern), or in Quebec, . Description Comptonia peregrina is a deciduous shrub, growing to tall. The leaves of the plant are linear to lanceolate, long and broad, with a lobed margin; they give off a sweet odor, especially when crushed. Plants are monoecious with separate unisexual flowers. The staminate flowers grow in clusters at the ends of branches, and are up to long. The pistillate flowers are only , but elongate when the fruits form, reaching . Taxonomy The species was first described, as Liquidambar peregrina, by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, in the second volume of Species Plantarum. Further on in the same volume, he described Myrica aspleniifolia as a different species (with the epithet spelt asplenifolia). In 1763, he changed his mind concerning Myrica aspleniifolia, and it became Liquidambar aspleniifolia, and so in the same genus as Liquidambar peregrina. In 1789, Charles Louis L'H√©ritier placed Linnaeus's original Myrica aspleniifolia in his new genus Comptonia. In 1894, John M. Coulter transferred Linnaeus's Liquidambar peregrina to Comptonia, and treated Linnaeus's Myrica aspleniifolia as a synonym. Comptonia peregrina is now the only extant (living) species in the genus. Distribution and habitat Comptonia peregrina is native to eastern North America, from Ontario and Quebec in the north, east to Nova Scotia, to Georgia in the south, and west to Minnesota. It tends to grow on dry sandy sites, and is associated with pine stands. Ecology Comptonia peregrina is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Bucculatrix paroptila, grey pug, setaceous Hebrew character, Io moth, and several Coleophora case-bearers: C. comptoniella, C. peregrinaevorella (which feeds exclusively on Comptonia), C. persimplexella, C. pruniella and C. serratella. It is also a non-legume nitrogen fixer. Uses and consumption The plant produces a bristly burr that contains 1 to 4 edible nutlets. The aromatic leaves (fresh or dried) are also used to make a tea. The Canadian author Catharine Parr Traill includes it in her book The Female Emigrant's Guide in a list of substitutes for China tea. \\"When boiled,\\" she notes, \\"it has a slightly resinous taste, with a bitter flavour, that is not very unpleasant.\\" Mistaking it, like others, for a fern, she says that it is in high repute \\"among the Yankee and old Canadian housewifes (sic).\\" Tea made from the plant has been said to treat the affects of poison ivy when applied to the affected area. The plant has also been used as a seasoning.

First published by Vanguard Press in 1937, the story follows a boy named Marco, who describes a parade of imaginary people and vehicles traveling along a road, Mulberry Street, in an elaborate fantasy story he dreams up to tell his father at the end of his walk. However, when he arrives home he decides instead to tell his father what he actually saw‚Äîa simple horse and wagon. Geisel conceived the core of the book aboard a ship in 1936, returning from a European vacation with his wife. The rhythm of the ship's engines captivated him and inspired the book's signature lines: At least 20 publishers rejected the book before Geisel ran into an old college classmate, who had just become juvenile editor at Vanguard Press. Vanguard agreed to publish the book, and it met with high praise from critics upon release, though sales were not as impressive. Later analyses of the book have focused on its connections to Geisel's childhood; the street of the title is probably named after a street in Geisel's hometown of Springfield, Massachusetts. Geisel returned to fictionalized versions of Springfield in later books, and Marco appeared again in 1947 in the Dr. Seuss book McElligot's Pool. Plot A boy named Marco, who is walking home from school, thinks of his father's advice: \\"Marco, keep your eyelids up/ And see what you can see.\\" However, the only thing Marco has seen on his walk is a horse pulling a wagon on Mulberry Street. To make his story more interesting, Marco imagines progressively more elaborate scenes based around the horse and wagon. He imagines the horse is first a zebra, then a reindeer, then an elephant, and finally an elephant helped by two giraffes. The wagon changes to a chariot, then a sled, then a cart holding a brass band. Marco's realization that Mulberry Street intersects with Bliss Street leads him to imagine a group of police escorts. The scene becomes a parade, as he then imagines a grand stand filled with the mayor and aldermen; an airplane dropping confetti; and, in the final incarnation of the scene, a Chinese man, a magician pulling rabbits out of a hat, and a man with a ten-foot beard. Now almost home, he snaps back to reality and rushes up the front steps, eager to tell his father his imagined story. However, when his father questions him about what he saw on his way home, his face turns red and he says, \\"Nothing...but a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street.\\" Background Geisel was 33 and had ten years of experience in cartooning, illustrating and advertising when he began work on Mulberry Street.Cohen (2004), pp. 181‚Äì187 He had an established and prosperous career in advertising, including a contract with Standard Oil for Flit bug spray. Geisel's popular campaign featured the line \\"Quick, Henry, the Flit!\\" He had also made some forays into book publishing: for Viking Press in 1931 he illustrated Boners and More Boners, collections of quotations from children's school papers. The book's positive sales encouraged Geisel to create his own children's book,Anderson (2011), p. 46 which his advertising contract did not forbid.Weidt (1994), pp. 27‚Äì28 In 1932, Geisel wrote and illustrated an alphabet book featuring a collection of odd animals, but was unable to interest publishers in it. According to Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel conceived the core of Mulberry Street in the summer of 1936 aboard the MS Kungsholm, a Swedish American luxury liner, during the return trip from a European vacation with his wife, Helen Palmer. As the Kungsholm endured a storm and Geisel suffered from sea sickness, he jotted down a rambling plot that started with \\"a stupid horse and wagon\\". To keep himself occupied, he began reciting poetry to the rhythm of the ship's engines and soon found himself saying, \\"And that is a story that no one can beat, and to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street.\\" For days after they landed, he had the rhythm of the ship's engine stuck in his head, so, at Helen's suggestion, he decided to write a story based around it.Morgan & Morgan (1995), pp. 79‚Äì81 The Morgans based this account on interviews with Geisel, who had given similar accounts of the book's creation to journalists throughout his career, often omitting or altering various details. In one version, he had already been working on the book for six months before the European trip, and the trip home provided the final breakthrough. In another, he claimed he had the book about half finished when they landed in the United States.Nel (2004), pp. 119‚Äì121 Geisel, in his perfectionism, struggled with writing Mulberry Street. According to the Morgans, \\"Although he lived for wit, his flights of fancy were subject to strict review.\\"Morgan & Morgan (1995), p. 81 He spent at least six months on the book, questioning every word and writing numerous drafts. He wrote the poem out in pencil on yellow paper and asked his wife to discuss every page with him. Publication history Geisel submitted his finished manuscript, originally titled A Story No One Can Beat, to dozens of publishers during the winter of 1936‚Äì37. Publishers posited a variety of criticisms of the book, including that fantasy was not salable, that children's books written in verse were out of style, and that the book lacked a clear moral message. According to the Morgans, Geisel angrily exclaimed to his wife, \\"What's wrong with kids having fun reading without being preached at?\\" She cited the book's cartoon- like drawings and its story, which might be seen to encourage daydreaming and lying to one's parents, as possible reasons for its rejection. According to Geisel, he was walking down Madison Avenue in New York City after learning of the latest rejection, planning to burn the manuscript when he got home, when he ran into Mike McClintock, an old Dartmouth College classmate.Morgan & Morgan (1995), p. 82 McClintock had just become juvenile editor at Vanguard Press and took Geisel to his office to introduce him to Vanguard's President James Henle and editor Evelyn Shrifte. Henle had been gaining a reputation for signing authors whom other, larger publishers had rejected. He soon agreed to publish the book, but stipulated that its title be changed. Geisel cited the incident for his belief in luck and later stated, \\"If I had been walking down the other side of Madison Avenue, I'd be in the dry-cleaning business today.\\" In gratitude to McClintock, Geisel changed the name of the book's protagonist to Marco, after McClintock's son, and dedicated the book to McClintock's wife, Helene. In \\"an act of faith\\",Morgan & Morgan (1995), p. 83 Vanguard Press printed 15,000 copies of the book for its first printing. To promote the book, Henle bought a full-page advertisement in Publishers Weekly, which reproduced the book's two-page spread of a reindeer pulling a cart and featured the line, \\"Book publishers, hitch on! This is the start of a parade that will take you places!\\" Approximately two years later, Vanguard printed 6,000 more copies. By 1943, it had printed 31,600 copies, and Geisel's royalties were no more than $3,500.Morgan & Morgan (1995), p. 85 Although Geisel later moved to Random House, Vanguard continued to publish Mulberry Street and his second book, The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins, until 1988, when Random House bought Vanguard.Morgan & Morgan (1995), p. 275 The book has received only one textual revision. In 1978, Geisel agreed to a slight rewording, renaming the character who appears near the end of the story a \\"Chinese man\\" instead of a \\"Chinaman\\".Nel (2004), pp. 108‚Äì109 He also agreed to remove the character's pigtail and the yellow coloring from the character's skin.Morgan & Morgan (1995), p. 276 However, he denied on multiple occasions requests from feminists to change the lines \\"Sayanyone could think of that,/ Jack or Fred or Joe or Nat/ Say, even Jane could think of that.\\" Reception Hearing of its release, neighbors of Geisel's in Springfield were at first worried the book would be an expos√© of the people there. Sales were lackluster, but early reviews were glowing. (unpaginated) Clifton Fadiman wrote a one-sentence review in The New Yorker, which Geisel could still quote near the end of his life: \\"They say it's for children, but better get a copy for yourself and marvel at the good Dr. Seuss' impossible pictures and the moral tale of the little boy who exaggerated not wisely but too well.\\"Morgan & Morgan (1995), p. 83‚Äì84 The New York Times wrote, \\"Highly original and entertaining, Dr Seuss' picture book partakes of the better qualities of those peculiarly America institutions, the funny papers and the tall tale. It is a masterly interpretation of the mind of a child in the act of creating one of those stories with which children often amuse themselves and bolster up their self- respect.\\" Children's book writer Beatrix Potter was among those who were enthusiastic about Seuss's first book. Anne Carroll Moore, then in charge of the children's section at the New York Public Library, wrote an enthusiastic review in the Atlantic Monthly and invited Geisel to speak at the library. In her review she called the book \\"so completely spontaneous that the American child can take it to his heart on sight\\", and \\"as original in conception, as spontaneous in the rendering as it is true to the imagination of a small boy.\\" Moore sent a copy of the book to English children's author Beatrix Potter, who wrote back, \\"What an amusing picture book ... I think it the cleverest book I have met with for many years. The swing and merriment of the pictures and the natural truthful simplicity of the untruthfulness ... Too many story books for children are condescending, self-conscious inventions‚Äîand then some trivial oversight, some small incorrect detail gives the whole show away. Dr. Seuss does it thoroughly!\\"Nel (2004), pp. 4‚Äì5 Geisel himself was later critical of the book, saying on its 25th anniversary, \\"I think I was a little aloof, too outside there. It was written from the point of view of my mind, not the mind of a child.\\"Nichols (1962), p. 42 While Mulberry Streets sales grew significantly as the Dr. Seuss brand became more famous, it is not one of Geisel's best-selling books. In 2012, on the occasion of the book's 75th anniversary, Michael Winerip argued that later Dr. Seuss books were more entertaining and inventive than Mulberry Street but that it is nevertheless important as a harbinger of the many books that followed. A. O. Scott, in a 2000 article in The New York Times, contradicted this view, calling the book \\"a hymn to the generative power of fantasy, a celebration of the sheer inventive pleasure of spinning an ordinary event into 'a story that no one can beat'.\\" Analysis = Autobiographical elements and influences = Mulberry Street of the Springfield, Massachusetts of his youth. Some writers have focused on Mulberry Streets connections to elements of Geisel's life, particularly his childhood in Springfield, Massachusetts. Geisel probably named the street in his story after a real-life Mulberry Street in Springfield. However, Guy McLain, director of the Springfield Museum, contends that Geisel might have chosen the street mainly because of the sound and rhythm of its name. Lewis Nichols, writing in 1962 on the occasion of the book's 25th anniversary, largely confirmed this view, writing that in the book's creation \\"there was no particular Mulberry Street in view, although there was one of the name in Springfield, Mass., where Mr. Geisel was born, and the subconscious may have taken him back.\\" Other writers have pointed out that the motorcycles the policemen use to escort the parade in Mulberry Street resemble Indian motorcycles, which were manufactured in Springfield during Geisel's childhood. Cori Urban claimed that the mayor in the story resembles Fordis C. Parker, who was mayor of Springfield from 1925 to 1929.City of Springfield (1922), Municipal Register of the City of Springfield, Springfield, Ma.: City of Springfield, p. 908 Charles Cohen notes that, while the book mentions the intersection of Bliss and Mulberry Streets, their real- life counterparts in Springfield do not cross. Cohen connects the horse and wagon in Mulberry Street to Geisel's Springfield childhood and points to precursors of it in Geisel's earlier work. He traces the blue elephant in the book to the blue elephants that appear in Geisel's comic strip Hejji. Philip Nel acknowledges Mulberry Street as the start of Geisel's particular, distinctive verse style and theorizes that he may have learned \\"the narrative power of meter and rhyme\\" from books he read as a child, including The Hole Book by Peter Newell.Nel (2004), pp. 16‚Äì18 Jonathan Cott noted that Mulberry Street is similar to \\"Der Erlk√∂nig\\", a German poem by Goethe, \\"for both of them are about a father and a son and about the exigencies and power of the imagination.\\"Cott (1983), p. 110 When Cott told Geisel about this, Geisel responded by quoting the first two lines of the poem, in German. He also noted that he was raised in a German-speaking home, minored in German in college, and had memorized the poem while in high school. Mary Galbraith makes a connection between Mulberry Street and Geisel's fears about the spread of Nazism. Geisel conceived of the story while returning from a European vacation that coincided with the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and Galbraith contends that in the book the \\"mayor's small mustache and raised arm evoke Hitler, while the brass band and international cast of characters evoke the parade of nations at the beginning of the games\\".Nel (2004), p. 47 She argues that the horse and wagon at the beginning of the story evokes the peaceful German Americans of Springfield, and by extension the non-threatening actions of Germany. As Marco's story evolves, the horse and wagon transform into a parade, which Galbraith equates with \\"a military monolith ... marching down main street as an airplane drops confetti.\\" = Marco's relationship with his father = Some analyses have examined the relationship between Marco and his father. Alison Lurie asserts that Marco's factual reply to his father at the end of the story suggests to the book's young readers that \\"it is sometimes, perhaps always, best to conceal one's inner imaginative life from adults\\",Lurie (1992), p. 70 a message that appears again in The Cat in the Hat. To Matthew Pierlot, \\"The father serves as an external check on the boy's tendency to abandon the truth\\",Pierlot (2011), p. 48 a Socrates-like figure who insists on intellectual integrity and thwarts Marco's desire to mold mundane reality into something more exciting than it is.Pierlot (2011), pp. 47‚Äì48 To Patrick Shannon, \\"Marco escapes into his imagination to combat the insipid character and conformity of the adult world\\".Shannon (1986), p. In this sense the book follows an individualist, child-centered trend in children's literature beginning in the mid-20th century, also seen in the works of Maurice Sendak and William Steig; this is in contrast to the norm in earlier children's books where the author tried to impart outside values on the child reader. Pastoral theologian Herbert Anderson has written that the child's perspective of reality in Mulberry Street can be challenging and seem subversive to an adult. He argues that Marco's internal story of what happened on his walk was not dishonest or rebellious, but a natural \\"openness to constructing a world\\".Anderson (2011), p. 40 The child's untruthful response that he had not seen anything interesting on Mulberry Street is not out of disrespect to the parent, but is Marco's attempt to reconcile his perspective with the authoritative, adult one of his father.Anderson (2011), pp. 39‚Äì41 = Verse style = Nel notes that Geisel makes heavy use of anapestic tetrameter in Mulberry Street and many of his later books, citing the rhythm and draw of the books' language as a main reason for their appeal. Thomas Fensch also notes the rollicking rhythm of the verse in Mulberry Street and Geisel's other books, writing, \\"Children can read the lines; they can sing the lines; they can SHOUT! the lines; they can dance to the lines.\\"Fensch (2001), p. 68 Fensch marks Mulberry Street as the start of what he calls \\"escalating sequences or escalating action\\", a technique Geisel used in most of his books, in which the action builds with each page. As Fensch put it, \\"The rhythm gallopsthe pictures move from left to right, toward the next page and the action builds.\\" =Artwork= Geisel's drawings formed a part of the narrative, bordering on the blending of text and image found in the much-denigrated comics medium. The artwork in children's literature before Geisel's appearance was much more restrained than Geisel's, and relegated to a lower status than the text it illustrated.Morgan & Morgan (1995), p. 84 By linking text and image, the book helps children follow the story even if they cannot read every word of the text.Nel (2004), p. 66 By encouraging children to explore the page, the drawings allow them to use their imaginations to fill in gaps in the text. The details shown in the pictures but not explained in the text creates a tension between them that leads the reader to think and imagine further. In the case of Mulberry Street, Philip Nel writes, readers might be moved to ask questions such as \\"Why is the elephant blue?\\" or \\"Where did the airplane come from?\\" In bold colors Geisel illustrated the surreal scenery and strange human and animal characters of the book with the strong, loose, energetic lineTunstall (2011), p. 222 that remained familiar in his later works. Ruth MacDonald saw Geisel's drawing style as fully formed in Mulberry Street, arguing that only his page design improved in later books, better keeping children's attention without confusing them. Philip Nel found the artwork in Geisel's later books to have a greater energy and looseness than in Mulberry Street or his earlier cartooning. Nel felt Geisel began loosening up toward his classic style as early as Horton Hatches the Egg (1940) and reached fruition with 1950's If I Ran the Zoo (1950).Nel (2004), p. 71‚Äì72 Adaptations Deems Taylor (pictured) adapted Mulberry Street into an orchestral work, Marco Takes a Walk (1942). Composer Deems Taylor adapted Mulberry Street into an orchestral work, Marco Takes a Walk. The work opens with a theme that represents the horse and wagon, which is followed by six variations that represent the various changes in Marco's story. The work's premiere, conducted by Howard Barlow, occurred at Carnegie Hall on November 14, 1942. A short film based on the book was released by Paramount Pictures in 1944. It was made by George Pal as part of his Puppetoons series, which featured an adaptation of Geisel's The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins the year before The Mulberry Street adaptation was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoon) in 1945. Legacy As Mulberry Street is Geisel's first children's book, Donald Pease calls it \\"the scene of origin for all of Dr. Seuss's children's books\\".Pease (2010), p. 85 After several books in prose, Geisel returned to verse for 1940's Horton Hatches the Egg, using the same \\"galloping, rollicking, anapestic tetrameter rhyme scheme\\"Fensch (2001), pp. 82‚Äì83 he had used for Mulberry Street. In a later series of children's stories for Redbook magazine, Geisel reported \\"the latest news from Mulberry Street\\". In \\"Marco Comes Late\\", Marco attempts to explain why he is two hours late to school. Geisel returned to fictionalized versions of his home town in three later books, which, together with Mulberry Street, form what Donald Pease calls the Springfield Cycle.Pease (2010), pp. 84‚Äì86 McElligot's Pool (1947), If I Ran the Zoo (1950), and If I Ran the Circus (1956) take place in different fictionalized versions of Springfield. Each also features a young protagonist who, when prompted by an adult, responds with \\"a series of increasingly fantastic scenarios.\\" McElligot's Pool also marks Marco's return as a main character in a Dr. Seuss book. When Geisel returned to Springfield in 1986 as part of a publicity tour he was greeted by dozens of children on Mulberry Street. Another group of children held up a banner that read, \\"And to think that we saw him on Mulberry Street\\". John Fogerty, frontman for the Creedence Clearwater Revival, has stated that the band's song \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door\\" was partly inspired by the book. In 1961 the book was given the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award.Thomas & Miller (2011), p. 82 Notes References Sources        * See also Mulberry (disambiguation) *Mulberry Street (disambiguation) American picture books Books by Dr. Seuss 1937 children's books Debut books Vanguard Press books Books adapted into films ","title":"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street"},{"id":"1836385","text":"The Smothers Brothers at the Purple Onion, released May 1, 1961 on Mercury Records, is the first album released by the Smothers Brothers and established their reputation as folk music satirists.

The album's full cover text is: The Songs and Comedy of the Smothers Brothers! Recorded at the Purple Onion, San Francisco, and is Mercury catalog number MG 20611 (monaural), and SR 60611 (stereo). It is sometimes referred to as Live at the Purple Onion. Despite the album's title, the bulk of the recording was in fact not made at the Purple Onion. According to Dick Smothers (quoted in the duo's biography, Dangerously Funny), the Purple Onion shows were good, but the tapes were compromised by technical issues, and as a result the only part of the Purple Onion performance that made it onto the album was the introduction. The bulk of the material was in fact sourced from tapes of subsequent performances at the Tideland Club in Houston, Texas, but because the duo was grateful to the Purple Onion for giving them their first break, the album was credited as having been recorded there.David Bianculli, Dangerously Funny: The Uncensored Story of The Smothers Brothers (Simon & Schuster, 2009), p.31 Track listing All well known songs were rewritten for satiric purposes unless otherwise indicated.

It is one of the four that constitute the √éles d'Hy√®res. Part of the island is occupied by the naturist resort of Heliopolis the rest is under military control.  History  =Ancient history= In the early Bronze Age the deposits at Petit Avis attest to the intermittent passage of man. Then in the Iron Age, in Liserot Cove, in the 7th century BC the occupation remains transient. It becomes permanent there only from the sixth to the fifth century BC. Then, after a long period of abandonment, it was inhabited again in the 1st century BC, Greek and Ligurian dishes were found on the island. The island was part of the Greek colony of Massalia (modern Marseille). =Modern history= Monks lived on the island beginning in the 15th century; the ruins of their monastery still exist on the island. From 1861 until 1878, the island was a penitentiary for young offenders and orphans, of whom 89 died here. A plaque (located on the military part of the island) commemorates them. In 1931, Gaston and Andr√© Durville, both doctors, established H√©liopolis, Europe's first naturist village, on the island. As the doctors Durville said in 1931  Geography  The island is , and located in the Gulf of Lion. About 90% of the island is reserved for a military missile test centre (the Centre d'Essais de Lancement de Missiles) which has launched numerous research and testing rockets since its establishment in 1948. The remaining 10% is open to civilians. The military zone is shown in red on the map of the island. Plage des Grottes at √éle du levant The village was built on hillsides and is dominated by Fort Napoleon. The village has a post office, a village hall, a chapel and a police station as well as a grocery, a bakery, and two galleries. The port area houses the office of the Capitaine du Port, a clothing store and small general store. In between there is a bazaar (Le Bazar d'H√©liopolis) offering food, hardware, a tabac and cafe bar. There are a number of hotels and bed-and- breakfasts, and eight restaurants (Le Gecko, La Fourmi, La Palmeraie, La Gambaro, H√©liotel, Le Minimum, La Pomme d'Adam, La Boh√®me), all catering for naturists. Climate  Culture  The Bain de Diane and the Plage des Grottes (a nude beach) are reserved for naturists; nudity is formally obligatory there. Being nude is allowed (and expected) everywhere on the public area of the island, except in the immediate vicinity of the harbour.Arr√™t√© Municipal Hy√®res N¬∞ 25, 14 March 1978 (http://www.aln.fr/html/documents/Arr%EAt%E9_1978_03_14_Mairie_Hy%E8res_Naturisme_au_Levant.pdf); modified 20 April 2005 (http://www.aln.fr/html/documents/Arr%EAt%E9_2005_04_28_modif- arr%EAt%E9-1978-naturisme-Levant.pdf). In August 2015, the Mayor of Hyeres informed the French Naturist Association that simply traversing, but not stopping on, the Village Square and its surroundings nude will henceforth be tolerated. (). In the harbour, it is formally necessary to wear what the French jokingly call , often a pareo or a string. In conformance with the relaxed atmosphere of the island, this rule is not really enforced, but generally well observed. Inside restaurants outside the village centre, some clothing, although often flimsy, is often worn but toplessness (for women and men) is quite accepted there and le minimum considered sufficient attire; on the outside terraces, nudity is common, especially at lunchtime. At least two restaurants, La Fourmi and Heliotel, actively encourage customers to be nude, even at dinner. A nudist sculpture on the √éle du Levant The island sees a number of scuba divers; these generally do not partake in the nudist lifestyle. The non-military part of the island is private property. The owners form the Association Syndicale Libre des Propri√©taires √† l'√éle du Levant. Outside H√©liopolis naturist village, the other main tourist attraction is the Domaine des Arbousiers, a voluntary natural reserve of , established on 3 December 1993.D√©cision du Pr√©fecture du Var, 3 December 1993. The island can be reached by boat from Hy√®res and from Le Lavandou. As no cars are allowed on the island (except for some four utility cars), these ferries do not take cars. In popular culture A 1956 film by Werner Kunz was called Isle of Levant and featured so-called \\"nudist camp\\" footage. The island is used as a setting in the Robert A. Heinlein novel Glory Road and in the Mario Reading novel The Music Makers. The island was mentioned in Are You Being Served? episode \\"Hoorah for the Holidays\\" as a presumed destination for Captain Peacock's annual vacation. Miss Brahms calls it \\"a nudist colony\\" but Captain Peacock insists it's a \\"nature camp\\". The island, and a nod to its nudist history, was also featured in the French film Nos Futurs (Our Futures). It was also the setting for a short story, The Reluctant Nudist, featuring Leslie Charteris' character The Saint. The Reluctant Nudist appeared in the collection published as The Saint Around the World The island was featured in an article titled \\"'The Incompleat Guide to the √éle du Levant\\" that was written by Henry N. Manney III and illustrated by Russel Brockbank. The article appeared in the March 1964 issue of Road & Track magazine.

It was the first beat 'em up to use texture-mapped polygonal graphics, and uses an extremely sophisticated move set by beat 'em up standards, often being likened to a fighting game in this respect. The game was published in cooperation with Fox Interactive and was a licensed product based on the Die Hard movie franchise. Because Sega did not hold the Japanese video game rights for Die Hard, in Japan the game was stripped of the Die Hard license and published as an original property. Similarly to hit action films of the time, Die Hard Arcade is dominated by over-the-top, largely gore-free violence which is played for comedic effect. Released in 1996 for arcades, the game was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 and the PlayStation 2 (Japan only) in the Sega Ages line in 2006. A sequel, Dynamite Cop, was released for arcades and Dreamcast in 1998 without the Die Hard license. Gameplay Die Hard Arcade is a beat 'em up for one or two players, who play as either John McClane or Kris Thompsen (Bruno Delinger and Cindy Holiday in the Japanese version). Players fight their way through waves of enemies, using their fists, feet, and a variety of weapons that can be collected from enemies or the environment, from household items such as brooms and pepper shakers to high-damage missile launchers and anti-tank guns. Most weapons are automatically lost at the end of each action scene, but hand guns can be retained so long as they have ammunition remaining. The typical level structure is a number of minions the player must defeat in many rooms, followed by a boss. Quick Time Events are interspersed between many of the scenes. Failing a Quick Time Event results in either a loss of health, as is usual for QTEs, or an additional action scene which the players otherwise would not have to complete. Cut scenes are interspersed into the action. The Saturn version also includes a port of Sega's 1979 arcade game Deep Scan, which can be used to gain extra credits. Unlike most arcade ports, no additional credits are provided for Deep Scan; losing a single life results in a game over. Plot In the English version, John McClane and Kris Thompsen (Bruno Delinger and Cindy Holiday) try to save the President's daughter, Caroline Powell from terrorists. There are a number of bosses on the game, including a biker called Hog, a Mexican wrestler named Jocko, the twin team of Mr. Oishi (a sumo wrestler) and Mr. Tubbs (an army general) and pairs of laser-shooting Spiderbots. The final boss, of which all the others are henchmen, is known as Wolf \\"White Fang\\" Hongo. At the end of the game, if both players are still alive, the two players will fight each other on the rooftop of the skyscraper to gain the sole appreciation of the President's daughter (similar to the ending of Double Dragon). Development Die Hard Arcade originated as a means for Sega to use existing resources: Sega had produced an excess inventory of ST-V arcade boards, and had acquired the Die Hard license but as yet had no Die Hard games in development. The game was created by AM1 and the US-based Sega Technical Institute (STI), with all work on the game taking place at STI's facilities. AM1 provided the engineering, design, and art, while STI provided art, design and animation. Die Hard Arcade was the final game developed by STI before the studio was dissolved. Previews reveal that up until shortly before the game's arcade release, the gameplay was strictly two dimensional, with characters only able to move along a single plane. The game was developed simultaneously for the ST-V Titan arcade system and Sega Saturn, but the home version was released later. The Japanese version of Die Hard Arcade, Dynamite Deka, was followed by a sequel titled Dynamite Deka 2 for the arcade and Dreamcast. The sequel was released internationally as Dynamite Cop. In 2007, a remake of the second game was released in arcades (on NAOMI) under the name Dynamite Deka EX in Japan and Asian Dynamite in Europe and the USA. Bruno, from the original Japanese version, later appeared as a solo unit in the 2012 crossover role-playing game, Project X Zone, recolored to match his Dynamite Cop appearance in the Western releases. Because the character is based on John McClane, Bruno's likeness is modeled after Bruce Willis. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Die Hard Arcade on their August 15, 1996 issue as being the second most-successful arcade game of the year. Reviewing the arcade version, a Next Generation critic said Die Hard Arcade \\"breathes life into a dead-end genre\\", as the fighting moves are effective and far more abundant than in previous beat 'em ups, even discounting the acquirable weapons. He also found the graphics \\"lively\\", but criticized that it is often difficult to line up attacks with opponents, and the action is sometimes glitchy or sluggish. It was Sega's most successful US-produced arcade game up to that time. Reviews for the Saturn port applauded its flawless conversion of the arcade version, variety of moves and combos, and selection of satisfying-to-use weapons, while criticizing the low longevity stemming from its short length, low difficulty, and limited replay value. Most critics asserted that even mildly-skilled players would beat the game within an hour, even without using the extra credits that can be earned by playing Deep Scan. Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot disputed this, saying that most players would need credits from Deep Scan to have a reasonable chance of beating the game. Paul Glancey of Sega Saturn Magazine was particularly enthusiastic about the weapons, commenting that \\"there's not much to beat the thrill of smacking a terrorist right in his low brow with an antique grandfather clock.\\" However, he stated that the game overall was \\"a fun fighting game that's especially suited for novice players, but it's too short lived for more experienced beat 'em up fans.\\" Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly was also less than impressed, concluding, \\"Take away the humor, decent graphics and simple control, and you've got a bust.\\" His three co- reviewers were more positive, with Crispin Boyer in particular calling the game \\"the slickest rip-off of Final Fight I've ever seen.\\" GamePros The Rookie made little of Die Hard Arcades low longevity, deeming the game a welcome offering to enthusiasts of back-to-basics beat 'em up gameplay. A Next Generation critic noted the longevity as a major issue but likewise gave a firmly positive assessment: \\"Die Hard Arcade is designed for pure and simple action, and it delivers.\\" Rubenstein similarly described it as \\"simple, violent, and easy. Basically, it's a blast.\\" GamesRadar ranked it number 25 on the list of the best Sega Saturn games, claiming that the \\"wide array of firearms and melee weapons helped amp up the arcade-style action.\\" References External linksDynamite Deka EX official website Dia Hard Arcade at MobyGames 1996 video games Arcade games Cooperative video games Arcade PlayStation 2 games PlayStation Network games Sega arcade games Sega beat 'em ups Sega Saturn games Sega Technical Institute games Fox Interactive games Sega video games Terrorism in fiction Video games about police officers Video games based on films Video games developed in the United States Video games featuring female protagonists 3D beat 'em ups ","title":"Die Hard Arcade"},{"id":"1836396","text":"170px Anthony Piccione (July 3, 1939 ‚Äì November 18, 2001) was an American poet.

In 737, Ecgbert's brother became king of Northumbria and the two siblings worked together on ecclesiastical issues. Ecgbert was a correspondent of Bede and Boniface and the author of a legal code for his clergy. Other works have been ascribed to him, although the attribution is doubted by modern scholars. Early life and career Ecgbert was the son of Eata, who was descended from the founder of the kingdom of Bernicia. His brother Eadberht was king of Northumbria from 737 to 758. Ecgbert went to Rome with another brother, and was ordained deacon while still there.Mayr-Harting \\"Ecgberht\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Ecgbert has been claimed to have been a student of Bede, who much later visited with Ecgbert in 733 at York,Blair World of Bede p. 305 but this statement may simply mean that Ecgbert was a student of Bede's writings, and not that he was formally taught by him. Archbishop Ecgbert was named to the see of York around 732Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 224 (other sources date the appointment to 734)Yorke Kings and Kingdoms p. 188 footnote 107 by his cousin Ceolwulf, the king of Northumbria. Pope Gregory III gave him a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, in 735. After Eadberht became king, the brothers worked together, and were forbidden by the papacy to transfer church lands to secular control.Yorke Kings and Kingdoms p. 91 They also worked together to deal with problems that had developed in the relationship between the church and royal government.Yorke Kings and Kingdoms p. 98 An example of the brothers' co-operation is the fact that some of Eadberht's coins feature Ecbert's image on the opposite face.Wood \\"Thrymas\\" Two Decades p. 28 Ecgbert's problems with the monasteries in his diocese came from the secular practice of families setting up monasteries that were totally under their control as a way of making the family lands book-land and free from secular service. Book-land was at first an exclusive right of ecclesiastical property. By transferring land to a family-controlled monastery, the family would retain the use of the land without having to perform any services to the king for the land.Mayr-Harting Coming of Christianity pp. 252‚Äì253 Educational activities The school Ecgbert founded at York is held by the modern historian Peter Hunter Blair to have equalled or surpassed the famous monasteries at Wearmouth and Jarrow.Blair World of Bede p. 225 The school educated not just the cathedral clergy but also the offspring of nobles.Blair Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England p. 328 Blair also calls the library that was established at York \\"a library whose contents were unequalled in the western Europe of its day\\".Blair Introduction to Anglo- Saxon England p. 144 Among the students at the school was Alcuin, who was placed by his family with Ecgbert.Hindley Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons p. 85 Both Liudger, later the first Bishop of Munster, and Aluberht, another bishop in Germany, also studied at the school in York.Stenton Anglo Saxon England p. 175 Correspondents Bede wrote Ecgbert a letter dealing with monastic issues as well as the problems of large dioceses. The letter, written in 734, became known as the Epistola ad Ecgberhtum episcopum.Rumble \\"Introduction\\" Leaders of the Anglo-Saxon Church p. 5 Bede urged Ecgbert to study Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, and held up Aidan and Cuthbert as examples of model bishops.Yorke Conversion of Britain p. 149 The main thrust of Bede's letter was to urge Ecgbert to reform his church to more closely resemble Gregory the Great's original plan for it.Blair Introduction to Anglo- Saxon England p. 131 Bede's admonition to divide up dioceses fell on deaf ears, as Egbert did not break up his large diocese.Mayr-Harting Coming of Christianity pp. 241‚Äì243 The suffragans continued to be limited to the bishops of Hexham, Lindisfarne, and Whithorn.Cubitt \\"Finding the Forger\\" English Historical Journal p. 1222 Boniface wrote to Ecgbert, asking for support against √Üthelbald of Mercia. Boniface also asked the archbishop for some of Bede's books, and in return sent wine to be drunk \\"in a merry day with the brethern.\\"quoted in Hindley Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons p. 143 On another occasion, Boniface sent the archbishop a cloak and towel.Blair Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England p. 165 Writings Ecgbert wrote the Dialogus ecclesiasticae institutionis, which was a legal code for the clergy, setting forth the proper procedures for many clerical and ecclesiastical issues including weregild for clerics, entrance to clerical orders, deposition from the clergy, criminal monks, clerics in court, and other matters. It survives as one complete manuscript, with a few excerpts in other manuscripts. Because Ecgbert was the senior archbishop in England after the death of Nothhelm in 739, it is possible that the Dialogus was intended not just for the Northumbrian church but for the entire church in England.Rumble \\"Introduction\\" Leaders of the Anglo-Saxon Church p. 37 The Dialogus details a code of conduct for the clergy and how the clergy was to behave in society.Mayr-Harting Coming of Christianity pp. 251‚Äì252 The exact date it was composed is unclear, but it was probably after 735, based on the mention of the archiepiscopal status of Ecgbert in one title as well as the internal evidence of the work. The historian Simon Coates saw the Dialogus as not especially exalting monks above the laity.Coates \\"Role of Bishops\\" History p. 194 Other works were attributed to Egbert in the Middle Ages, but they are not regarded by modern scholars as authentic. These include a collection of church canons, as well as a penitential and a pontifical.Lapidge \\"Ecgberht\\" Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England The penitential, known as the Paenitentiale Ecgberhti, was ascribed to Ecgbert by the 8th or 9th centuries, but its surviving versions have little or no content that can be reliably traced to Ecgbert. The pontifical, known as the Pontificale Egberti, is thought to owe its attribution to Ecgbert's authorship to the fact that the penitential ascribed to Ecgbert was included within its contents. Lastly, the collection of church laws known previously as the Excerptiones Ecgberhti but today as the Collectio canonum Wigorniensis, has been shown to be the work of a later archbishop of York, Wulfstan, and was not connected with Ecgbert until after the Anglo-Saxon period. Besides these Latin works, an Old English text, known variously as the Scriftboc, Confessionale Pseudo-Egberti or Confessionale Egberti, was once stated to be a translation from Latin by Ecgbert, but is now known to date from the late 9th or 10th century.Ryan \\"Archbishop Ecberht\\" Leaders of the Anglo-Saxon Church pp. 44‚Äì45 Death and legacy Ecgbert died on 19 November 766, and was buried in his cathedral at York. Ecgbert had a reputation after his death as an expert on canon law and church legislation, both in his native England and on the mainland of Europe.Ryan \\"Archbishop Ecgberht\\" Leaders of the Anglo-Saxon Church p. 42 Alcuin also claimed that he was known as a teacher of singing. The historian D. P. Kirby described him as a \\"great\\" archbishop.Kirby Making of Early England p. 60 The historian Henry Mayr-Harting stated that Ecgbert \\"must be regarded as one of the great architects of the English church in the eighth century\\".

The geographic valley is defined by the surrounding Granite Mountains, Ord Mountains, and San Bernardino Mountains. Lucerne Valley lies east of the Victor Valley, whose population nexus includes Victorville, Apple Valley, Adelanto and Hesperia. It is located east of Apple Valley, and north of Big Bear Lake. Distant surrounding communities include Yucca Valley which lies east via State Route 247/Old Woman Springs Road, and Barstow, which is north via State Route 247/Barstow Road. The transportation nexus of Lucerne Valley is located where State Route 247 and State Route 18 are connected by Old Woman Springs and Barstow Roads, the two highways do not have a direct junction. In San Bernardino County, Lucerne Valley's area is also identified as County Service Area 29. While Lucerne Valley's \\"town limit\\" signs are within 2 miles of each other, the County Service Area Limits are much larger: in the west to Joshua Road (unpaved road east of Milpas Rd. on Hwy. 18), to the north at the height of Ord Mountain on Highway 247, to the south at the entrance to Cushenbury Canyon on Highway 18, and at Old Woman Springs Ranch as the eastern boundary.

Development  Lucerne Valley Chamber of Commerce. = Zoning = The majority of Lucerne Valley's zoning consists of Rural Residential, Resource Conservation and Residential zones. Industrial zoning is predominantly in the southern border of the community on the north-facing slopes of the San Bernardino Mountains. The commercial zoning corridor is primarily on State Route 18, with outlying businesses within a mile of the eastern half of the Old Woman Springs/Barstow Road junction. Commercial development is focused on mixed-use development, with storefronts facing the highway and a private residence on the same property behind the business on the same lot. Traditional retail construction has been restrained in the latter half of the 20th Century to keep the rural character of the town intact, but in September 2015 a Dollar General store opened as the first franchise grocery retail to enter town limits. All residential zones are classified as Rural, Single or Medium density. Most housing developments are tract-based and were completed prior to the 1990s. No further tract-based construction projects have occurred in 20 years, with most new construction done individually on privately owned lots. An attempt to construct a golf course and install utilities for residential/commercial zones called \\"Rancho Lucerne\\" began grading north of the High School site before embezzlement charges filed against the financier caused the project to shut down in 2001, leaving the site abandoned and desert habitat destroyed. = Utilities = and water well drilling and export proposals. The majority of projects are to transfer local resources for statewide use. Projects include solar power plants (all state power plants are required to 'sell' generated energy to CalISO as a common carrier arrangement) as well as water for both direct use by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) and wells used for cooling solar plants. In 2012, LADWP cancelled an attempt to install a 2 mile wide water and power corridor in the southern half of the town.

Lucerne Valley Elementary School, built in 1952, is a 1/4 mile north of Old Woman Springs and Barstow Road and serves grades K-5. Lucerne Valley Middle School was built in 1986 on State Route 18, and formerly served grades 6-8. Lucerne Valley Middle School later merged with Lucerne Valley High School. Lucerne Valley High School was built in 1992 on Rabbit Springs Road east of State Route 247 and serve grades 6-12. Lucerne Valley High School offers athletics, FFA, and other activities for students. The high school's first graduating class was in 1995. The School District Office, Community Day School, and Mountain View High School have moved into the former Lucerne Valley Middle School site. The Lucerne Valley Unified School District has had difficulty in recent years with financial issues, and lower than average test scores compared to San Bernardino County schools,. The School District reported a student population of less than 800 pupils as of September 2015. Public safety & amenities San Bernardino County requires cities and towns to be incorporated. Since Lucerne Valley is an unincorporated community in the county, services and local government responsibilities within Lucerne Valley are operated by the County itself. San Bernardino County operates a Sheriff Substation and a full- time staffed fire station within town limits. The same Fire Station serves as the CSA 29 Field Office, which operates a Parks and Recreation Department to maintain the town parks, county facilities including two community centers and the county library, an ATSC TV Translator tower, and a public cemetery. Cal Fire also has a fire station east of the Town between Lucerne Valley and Johnson Valley. California Highway Patrol provides traffic enforcement and investigation.

The station is on the Chiltern Main Line between and stations. It is served by Chiltern Railways. History The remains of the 1854 station The original terminus station was built in 1854 after an original design by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The station had one platform and a train shed that covered two broad gauge tracks. On one side of the train shed was a single road engine shed and on the platform side were a booking office and waiting rooms (on the Birdcage Walk side). The walls of the train shed, an engine shed and offices were constructed from brick and knapped flint with slate roofs. This building remained as a station in use until 1864 when it became a goods shed. Between the 1880s and 1940 various additions were made to the fabric of the old station. The building received grade two listing in 1999 due to being one of only six remaining GWR train sheds. Following listing most of the later additions were removed, restoring the building to its original footprint, the only addition being the flat roof second floor extension added in 1940. The dimensions and general design of the train shed, engine shed and office accommodation were repeated at with only the building materials different; Wycombe was built with brick and knapped flint wall while Thame was constructed from timber. A second through station was opened on the current location in 1864 with a second platform and, later, a footbridge. For two years prior to this date, after the extension to Thame had been made, all through trains had to reverse in and out of the old station which was not located on the new through lines. The design of the office accommodation on the newer station was a copy of the office accommodation on the old, with a canopy covering the platform rather than the train shed. The building was extended as least once at its west end. With the building of the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway in 1906 the station was again rebuilt to the design that is in use today, with four lines between two staggered platforms and a subway. The station was originally the terminus of the Wycombe Railway line from , which was later extended to and , and then in 1867 was taken over by the Great Western Railway. In 1906 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway line was opened through High Wycombe, linking London with the two companies' lines to the north. Much of the current Chiltern Main Line is formed from this joint line. British Rail closed the original branch line to Maidenhead on 2 May 1970 and subsequently the track was lifted. The station was transferred from the Western Region of British Rail to the London Midland Region on 24 March 1974. In November 2005 a fire in the ticket office gutted the roof of the building. The restored station building reopened in September 2007. In April 2015 the Northbound platform was lengthened.https://www.chilternrailways.co.uk/high-wycombe-upgrade The subway was closed and has now been replaced with a footbridge with a lift at each end.https://twitter.com/chilternrailway/status/774141996998897665?lang=en Services A going to London calls at High Wycombe as a northbound service approaches All trains are operated by Chiltern Railways.

Such alloys have very high tensile strength and toughness (even at extreme temperatures). They are light in weight, have extraordinary corrosion resistance and the ability to withstand extreme temperatures. However, the high cost of both raw materials and processing limit their use to military applications, aircraft, spacecraft, bicycles, medical devices, jewelry, highly stressed components such as connecting rods on expensive sports cars and some premium sports equipment and consumer electronics. Although \\"commercially pure\\" titanium has acceptable mechanical properties and has been used for orthopedic and dental implants, for most applications titanium is alloyed with small amounts of aluminium and vanadium, typically 6% and 4% respectively, by weight. This mixture has a solid solubility which varies dramatically with temperature, allowing it to undergo precipitation strengthening. This heat treatment process is carried out after the alloy has been worked into its final shape but before it is put to use, allowing much easier fabrication of a high-strength product.  Categories  Titanium alloys are generally classified into four main categories:Characteristics of Alpha, Alpha Beta and Beta Titanium Alloys * Alpha alloys which contain neutral alloying elements (such as tin) and/ or alpha stabilisers (such as aluminium or oxygen) only. These are not heat treatable. Examples include: Ti-5Al-2Sn-ELI, Ti-8Al-1Mo-1V. * Near-alpha alloys contain small amount of ductile beta-phase. Besides alpha-phase stabilisers, near-alpha alloys are alloyed with 1‚Äì2% of beta phase stabilizers such as molybdenum, silicon or vanadium. Examples include: Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-2Mo, Ti-5Al-5Sn-2Zr-2Mo, IMI 685, Ti 1100. * Alpha and beta alloys, which are metastable and generally include some combination of both alpha and beta stabilisers, and which can be heat treated. Examples include: Ti-6Al-4V, Ti-6Al-4V-ELI, Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn, Ti-6Al-7Nb. * Beta and near beta alloys, which are metastable and which contain sufficient beta stabilisers (such as molybdenum, silicon and vanadium) to allow them to maintain the beta phase when quenched, and which can also be solution treated and aged to improve strength. Examples include: Ti-10V-2Fe-3Al, Ti‚Äì29Nb‚Äì13Ta‚Äì4.6Zr, Ti-13V-11Cr-3Al, Ti-8Mo-8V-2Fe-3Al, Beta C, Ti-15-3. Beta-titanium Beta titanium alloys exhibit the BCC allotropic form of titanium (called beta). Elements used in this alloy are one or more of the following other than titanium in varying amounts. These are molybdenum, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, zirconium, manganese, iron, chromium, cobalt, nickel, and copper. The titanium alloys have excellent formability and can be easily welded. Beta titanium is nowadays largely utilized in the orthodontic field and was adopted for orthodontics use in the 1980s. This type of alloy replaced stainless steel for certain uses, as stainless steel had dominated orthodontics since the 1960s. It has strength/modulus of elasticity ratios almost twice those of 18-8 austenitic stainless steel, larger elastic deflections in springs, and reduced force per unit displacement 2.2 times below those of stainless steel appliances. Some of the beta titanium alloys can convert to hard and brittle hexagonal omega-titanium at cryogenic temperatures or under influence of ionizing radiation.  Transition temperature  The crystal structure of titanium at ambient temperature and pressure is close-packed hexagonal Œ± phase with a c/a ratio of 1.587. At about 890 ¬∞C, the titanium undergoes an allotropic transformation to a body-centred cubic Œ≤ phase which remains stable to the melting temperature. Some alloying elements, called alpha stabilizers, raise the alpha-to-beta transition temperature, while others (beta stabilizers) lower the transition temperature. Aluminium, gallium, germanium, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen are alpha stabilizers. Molybdenum, vanadium, tantalum, niobium, manganese, iron, chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper and silicon are beta stabilizers.Vydehi Arun Joshi. Titanium Alloys: An Atlas of Structures and Fracture Features. CRC Press, 2006.  Properties  Generally, beta-phase titanium is the more ductile phase and alpha-phase is stronger yet less ductile, due to the larger number of slip planes in the bcc structure of the beta-phase in comparison to the hcp alpha-phase. Alpha-beta-phase titanium has a mechanical property which is in between both. Titanium dioxide dissolves in the metal at high temperatures, and its formation is very energetic. These two factors mean that all titanium except the most carefully purified has a significant amount of dissolved oxygen, and so may be considered a Ti‚ÄìO alloy. Oxide precipitates offer some strength (as discussed above), but are not very responsive to heat treatment and can substantially decrease the alloy's toughness. Many alloys also contain titanium as a minor additive, but since alloys are usually categorized according to which element forms the majority of the material, these are not usually considered to be \\"titanium alloys\\" as such. See the sub- article on titanium applications. Commercial (99.2% purity) grades of titanium have an ultimate tensile strength of about 434 MPa, equal to that of common, low-grade steel alloys, but are less dense. Titanium is 60% denser than aluminium, but more than twice as strong as the most commonly used 6061-T6 aluminium alloy. The titanium used for surface alloying of AISI304 stainless steel was CP-Ti, grade2, 300¬µm thick sheet.Tej Ram Sahu and Ashok Sharma. ‚ÄúTo Perceive the Mix of GTA Parameters on the Outside of AISI304 Stainless Steel that Gives Improvement in the Properties AISI304 Tempered Steel in the Changed Layer‚Äù, United International Journal for Research & Technology 1.1 (2019): 10-26. Titanium alone is a strong, light metal. It is stronger than common, low-carbon steels, but 45% lighter. It is also twice as strong as weak aluminium alloys but only 60% heavier. Titanium has outstanding corrosion resistance to seawater, and thus is used in propeller shafts, rigging and other parts of boats that are exposed to seawater. Titanium and its alloys are used in airplanes, missiles, and rockets where strength, low weight, and resistance to high temperatures are important. Further, since titanium does not react within the human body, it and its alloys are used in artificial joints, screws, and plates for fractures, and for other biological implants. See Titanium#Orthopedic implants.  Titanium grades  The ASTM International standard on titanium and titanium alloy seamless pipe references the following alloys, requiring the following treatment: > \\"Alloys may be supplied in the following conditions: Grades 5, 23, 24, 25, > 29, 35, or 36 annealed or aged; Grades 9, 18, 28, or 38 cold-worked and > stress-relieved or annealed; Grades 9, 18, 23, 28, or 29 transformed-beta > condition; and Grades 19, 20, or 21 solution-treated or solution-treated and > aged.\\"ASTM B861 ‚Äì 10 Standard Specification for Titanium and Titanium Alloy > Seamless Pipe (Grades 1 to 38) > \\"Note 1‚ÄîH grade material is identical to the corresponding numeric grade > (that is, Grade 2H = Grade 2) except for the higher guaranteed minimum UTS, > and may always be certified as meeting the requirements of its corresponding > numeric grade.

It is a good solution for cold forming and corrosive environments. ASTM/ASME SB-265 provides the standards for commercially pure titanium sheet and plate.Titanium Grades, Application ; Grade 2: Unalloyed titanium, standard oxygen. ; Grade 2H: Unalloyed titanium (Grade 2 with 58 ksi minimum UTS). ; Grade 3: Unalloyed titanium, medium oxygen. :Grades 1-4 are unalloyed and considered commercially pure or \\"CP\\". Generally the tensile and yield strength goes up with grade number for these \\"pure\\" grades. The difference in their physical properties is primarily due to the quantity of interstitial elements. They are used for corrosion resistance applications where cost, ease of fabrication, and welding are important. ; Grade 5 also known as Ti6Al4V, Ti-6Al-4V or Ti 6-4 : not to be confused with Ti-6Al-4V-ELI (Grade 23), is the most commonly used alloy. It has a chemical composition of 6% aluminum, 4% vanadium, 0.25% (maximum) iron, 0.2% (maximum) oxygen, and the remainder titanium. It is significantly stronger than commercially pure titanium (grades 1-4) while having the same stiffness and thermal properties (excluding thermal conductivity, which is about 60% lower in Grade 5 Ti than in CP Ti).Compare Materials: Commercially Pure Titanium and 6Al-4V (Grade 5) Titanium Among its many advantages, it is heat treatable.

This grade was developed in the 1990s for use as an armor plating. The iron reduces the amount of Vanadium needed as a beta stabilizer. Its mechanical properties are very similar to Grade 5, but has good cold workability similar to grade 9.ArmyCorrosion.com  Heat treatment Titanium alloys are heat treated for a number of reasons, the main ones being to increase strength by solution treatment and aging as well as to optimize special properties, such as fracture toughness, fatigue strength and high temperature creep strength. Alpha and near-alpha alloys cannot be dramatically changed by heat treatment. Stress relief and annealing are the processes that can be employed for this class of titanium alloys. The heat treatment cycles for beta alloys differ significantly from those for the alpha and alpha-beta alloys. Beta alloys can not only be stress relieved or annealed, but also can be solution treated and aged. The alpha-beta alloys are two-phase alloys, comprising both alpha and beta phases at room temperature. Phase compositions, sizes, and distributions of phases in alpha-beta alloys can be manipulated within certain limits by heat treatment, thus permitting tailoring of properties. ;Alpha and near-alpha alloys: The micro-structure of alpha alloys cannot be strongly manipulated by heat treatment since alpha alloys undergo no significant phase change. As a result, high strength can not be acquired for the alpha alloys by heat treatment. Yet, alpha and near-alpha titanium alloys can be stress relieved and annealed. ;Alpha-beta alloys: By working as well as heat treatment of alpha-beta alloys below or above the alpha-beta transition temperature, large micro-structural changes can be achieved. This may give a substantial hardening of the material. Solution treatment plus aging is used to produce maximum strengths in alpha-beta alloys. Also, other heat treatments, including stress-relief heat treatments, are practiced for this group of titanium alloys as well. ;Beta alloys: In commercial beta alloys, stress-relieving and aging treatments can be combined. Titanium alloys by application or use = Aerospace structures = = Architectural cladding = = Titanium alloys used biomedically = Titanium plate for wrist Titanium alloys have been extensively used for the manufacturing of metal orthopedic joint replacements and bone plate surgeries. They are normally produced from wrought or cast bar stock by CNC, CAD-driven machining, or powder metallurgy production. Each of these techniques comes with inherent advantages and disadvantages. Wrought products come with an extensive material loss during machining into the final shape of the product and for cast samples the acquirement of a product in its final shape somewhat limits further processing and treatment (e.g. precipitation hardening), yet casting is more material effective. Traditional powder metallurgy methods are also more material efficient, yet acquiring fully dense products can be a common issue. With the emergence of solid freeform fabrication (3D printing) the possibility to produce custom-designed biomedical implants (e.g. hip joints) has been realized. While it is not applied currently on a larger scale, freeform fabrication methods offers the ability to recycle waste powder (from the manufacturing process) and makes for selectivity tailoring desirable properties and thus the performance of the implant. Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and Selective Laser Melting (SLM) are two methods applicable for freeform fabrication of Ti-alloys. Manufacturing parameters greatly influence the microstructure of the product, where e.g. a fast cooling rate in combination with low degree of melting in SLM leads to the predominant formation of martensitic alpha-prime phase, giving a very hard product. ; Ti-6Al-4V / Ti-6Al-4V-ELI: This alloy has good biocompatibility, and is neither cytotoxic nor genotoxic.

Its leader is Uliti Uata. The HRDM was founded in the late 1970s as an informal group of Tongans interested in democratic reform. It was formalised in 1992 as the Pro-Democracy Movement, and contested several elections under that name. In October 1998, it changed its name to the Human Rights and Democracy Movement. In November 1992 the then-Pro-Democracy Movement held a constitutional convention which discussed the structure and history of the Constitution of Tonga and compared it to arrangements overseas. A follow-up convention was held in 1999, but this was less successful. At the 1999 elections, candidates aligned with the HRDM gained five seats in the Legislative Assembly of Tonga. The results were a disappointment for the HRDM, which had expected to win at least seven seats. At the 2002 elections, supporters of the HRDM won seven of the nine seats reserved for commoners. At the 2005 elections they also won seven seats, and following the election HRDM- aligned People's Representatives Feleti Sevele and Sione Haukinima were appointed to Cabinet. Sevele later became the first commoner to serve as Prime Minister of Tonga. At the 2008 elections, the HRDM won only 4 seats. In the leadup to the 2010 elections several members of the HRDM, including longstanding MP 'Akilisi Pohiva founded the Democratic Party of the Friendly Islands as an explicit electoral vehicle.

The line has been in operation since the 1840s between Glasgow and Greenock and was the first passenger service to follow the River Clyde to the coast. The line was electrified in 1967. History The line was opened by the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway on 31 March 1841, and initially ran from Bridge Street railway station in Glasgow to a terminus at Cathcart Street, Greenock (later renamed Greenock Central railway station), with the section between Glasgow, and Paisley Gilmour Street being run by the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway. For the first time a railway took passengers right down the River Clyde, taking about one hour where Clyde steamers took around twice as long. The terminus was a short walk from Custom House Quay, Greenock, and the railway was very popular with passengers who boarded steamers there to visit holiday resorts down the Firth of Clyde or to commute in summer to their villas around the shores of the firth. On 9 July 1847 the railway merged with the Caledonian Railway and became their main outlet to the coast. The Greenock and Wemyss Bay Railway opened its branch line on 13 May 1865 with its trains being operated by the Caledonian Railway, but its steamer operations were slow to live up to their promise and when in 1869 the Glasgow and South Western Railway opened its station at Princes Pier, Greenock, the Cathcart Street station was effectively bypassed and the Caley lost trade. They had been trying for some time to organise an extension to Gourock, and having gained Parliamentary approval in 1884 they spent three years in construction which involved extensive tunnelling, and opened Gourock railway station on 1 June 1889. In August 1893 the Greenock and Wemyss Bay Railway amalgamated with the Caledonian Railway. In the 1923 grouping, the line became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The line was electrified in 1967, seven years after the North Clyde Line. The electric Class 311 trains were specially built for the line in 1967, although Class 303 trains were also used. Current operation As of 2019, the line is mainly operated by Class 318s, Class 320s, Class 380s and Class 385s. The Inverclyde line uses the same Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway tracks as the Ayrshire Coast Line until Paisley Gilmour Street; although the two lines occupy different sets of platforms at Paisley Gilmour Street. From Paisley, the line heads to Port Glasgow station, after which it branches. The main route heads through Greenock to Gourock, where it connects with ferry services to Dunoon and Kilcreggan. The branch heads through the southern suburbs of Greenock to Wemyss Bay, where it connects with ferry services to Rothesay on the island of Bute (From 1 October 2015, for a period of 24 weeks, the ferry to Rothesay left from Gourock. This was due to essential improvement work being carried out at Wemyss Bay linkspan) For most of the day five trains an hour operate each way on the Glasgow to Port Glasgow stretch, four of which run to Gourock, the other serving the Wemyss Bay line. The latter and two of the Gourock trains are express services stopping only at Paisley Gilmour Street and Bishopton (except for the 1725 ex Glasgow, which runs non-stop from Paisley Gilmour Street to Port Glasgow) between Glasgow and Port Glasgow, while the other two Gourock trains stop at all stations. This changes in the evenings, and after 8 pm only two trains an hour run to Gourock, with the Wemyss Bay train stopping at all stations. Proposed link to Glasgow Airport The Glasgow Airport Rail Link to Glasgow Airport would have branched off from the Inverclyde Line near Paisley St. James station. In December 2006, the Scottish Executive gave the final go-ahead for the new link to be constructed; however, the project was subsequently cancelled in September 2009.

It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on July 11, 2001. In the episode, 9th-grader Scott Tenorman makes Cartman believe that buying pubic hair from him will make Cartman reach puberty. Realizing that he had been tricked, an angry Cartman plots revenge on Scott. South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone point to this episode as a milestone in the series. The episode introduced significant changes in the characterization of Cartman, setting the standard for his psychopathic antics in the following seasons; and it also prompted the creators to only focus on one plot within an episode, as opposed to the show's earlier episodes, which involved several loosely related subplots. \\"Scott Tenorman Must Die\\" was written by Parker, and directed by animation director Eric Stough. English rock band Radiohead guest star in the episode as themselves. \\"Scott Tenorman Must Die\\" received widespread acclaim, with Parker and Stone listing the episode as one of their favorites on multiple occasions, and it is considered by critics to be one of the best episodes of the entire series. Plot After purchasing a handful of pubic hair for $10 from 9th grader Scott Tenorman, Cartman believes he has reached puberty and shows it to Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. They tell him that he has to grow his own body hair, which angers Cartman. He tries to get his money back, but is repeatedly tricked and humiliated by Scott, who also steals an additional $6.12 from Cartman and burns the money. Kenny dies from laughing at Scott's actions. Kyle tells Cartman to move on, but he is determined to get revenge. He attempts to train a pony to bite off Scott's penis, but Jimbo tells him it would be best to find Scott's weaknesses. Cartman discovers that Scott's favorite band is Radiohead and creates a plan to make the band members dislike him; they would show up after Scott gets bitten and insult him for crying. Cartman writes a letter asking them to visit South Park, claiming that Scott is dying from cancer. Stan and Kyle tell Scott about Cartman's plan. Cartman gives Scott an invitation to a chili cook off and a ticket for a pony ride. After Cartman leaves, Scott tells his parents that there's a starving, abandoned pony on Mr. Denkins' farm. They go to save it that night and have it taken to an animal shelter. Meanwhile, Scott and his friends cook chili for Cartman that contains pubic hairs. The next day, Scott, Cartman and Chef bring chili for the cook-off. After they sit down to eat, Scott eats some of Cartman's chili, while Cartman scarfs down Scott's, much to the silent enjoyment of the onlookers (including Stan and Kyle), who are in on Scott's prank. As Cartman is finishing Scott's chili, Scott prepares to tell him the secret ingredient, but Cartman then reveals that he already knew, and the chili he is eating is actually Chef's. Cartman says that he told Stan and Kyle about his plan because he knew they would warn Scott. Cartman then announces that his actual plan was to get Mr. Denkins to shoot Scott's parents for trespassing. While Denkins was talking to the police, Cartman then stole the corpses, chopped them up and ground their body parts into the chili he fed to Scott. Scott finds his mother's finger in the bowl, vomits, and starts crying. Radiohead shows up and ‚Äì unaware of what just happened ‚Äì insults Scott by calling him \\"totally not cool\\" and a \\"crybaby\\". Scott yells \\"Wait!\\" as they're leaving but they ignore him, making him more upset. As Cartman begins licking tears from Scott's face, Stan and Kyle agree to never anger Cartman to the extent Scott did again. Cartman waves to the camera and says \\"That's all, folks!\\" as the background from Looney Tunes appears on the screen. Production and broadcast Members of the English rock band Radiohead appear in the episode, and provide the voiceovers for their characters. According to South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, \\"Scott Tenorman Must Die\\" represented significant shifts both in the writing of the show, and the characterization of Eric Cartman. Although originally just an annoying, spoiled child, Cartman got somewhat meaner over the course of the show's previous episodes. However, with \\"Scott Tenorman Must Die,\\" he became \\"the most evil kid in the world,\\" and got progressively darker throughout the series' run. The creators debated whether it was okay to have Cartman kill Scott's parents and feed them to him, as it was a \\"crazy to do with a kid,\\" and would be setting a new bar for the series and the character. Eventually, after having debated the issue at length, the writers decided to go ahead with the idea. However, they found it very important to make sure that Cartman kills Scott's parents indirectly, without having to \\"pull the trigger himself.\\" Parker and Stone had also cited the episode as a milestone in the writing of South Park, as the first episode to only have a single plot, without another subplot (that is, a B story or even a C story) to support the episode. The creators could only come up with the cat and mouse situation between Cartman and Tenorman, which they had described as reminiscent of the relationships in classic cartoons such as Tom and Jerry and Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner. The creators feared that not having a subplot would negatively affect the episode, but upon finishing, they realized that a single, strong plot worked well. Since then, many episodes have contained just one plotline, or two strongly related stories. \\"Scott Tenorman Must Die\\" was written by Trey Parker, and directed by South Park animation director Eric Stough. Whereas most episodes of South Park are created within a single week, writing on this episode began in the middle of May 2001, more than a month before the start of the season on June 20, and the episode was assigned a production code number of 501 (meaning the 1st episode of the 5th season).News post dated May 15, 2001 (1st chronologically). In: The early start was because the creators sometimes try to have one episode \\"in the bank\\" ‚Äî meaning that they have \\"at least half-start\\" animating it. This way they can take off a few days during the two-month-long, demanding run, and then go back and finish work on the banked show. The episode's first draft was written during the time when Parker and Stone were still finishing editing the last episode of their other TV show, 2001's That's My Bush! In its first draft, the episode's title was \\"Scott Tenorall Must Die,\\" but Parker decided to change the character's name afterwards, as he thought that Tenorman sounded funnier.News post dated July 9, 2001.

In: News post dated June 6, 2001. In: Before the season started, \\"Scott Tenorman Must Die\\" was pushed back as the fourth episode of the run.News post dated June 14, 2001. In: The episode eventually aired on July 11, 2001 on Comedy Central in the United States, after \\"It Hits the Fan,\\" \\"Cripple Fight\\" and \\"Super Best Friends.\\" The original broadcast of the show did not have a visible ghost of Kenny, when he laughed himself to death. This was added by the episode's rerun on the following Saturday.News post dated July 13, 2001. In: Minor modifications like this occasionally happen on South Park, given the rush the creators are in when delivering the show on the day of its broadcast. The script of the episode reveals some minor differences from the finished episode. After the long \\"mad scientist\\" scene of Cartman designing the plans for his revenge, it was supposed to be revealed that whatever he was drawing so intently was \\"only a stupid crayon drawing of a pony.\\" In the finished episode, Cartman's drawing is not revealed; however, the pony drawing is featured earlier in the episode, during Cartman's briefing to the children. In the scene where Scott Tenorman burns the money in front of Cartman, the script direction said that Cartman should look like William Wallace in the 1995 historical drama film Braveheart, at the moment he realizes that he was betrayed. Within the same scene, it is written that Cartman would fall down on the muddy lawn, and then use the mud to put war paint on his face. Previous seasons of South Park were animated with the software PowerAnimator. The studio started using Maya from the fifth season on. The pubic hairs in the episode were scanned-in hairs from the back of the neck of Adrien Beard, South Parks lead storyboarder. The members of the band Radiohead ‚Äî Thom Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Colin Greenwood, Ed O'Brien and Phil Selway ‚Äî provided their voice for their characters. The band was on tour in Santa Barbara, and Matt Stone drove there from Los Angeles to record their lines. While directing singer Thom Yorke, Stone told him to \\"emote more,\\" as his acting was not exaggerated enough for animation voiceovers. Stone found it ironic to direct Yorke to put more emotion into his delivery, considering that Yorke is \\"brilliant at emoting perfectly, exactly, in such a complex and beautiful way\\" when he sings. The episode also features regular voice acting from Parker and Stone for most characters, as well as Eliza Schneider and Mona Marshall for female voices. Scott Tenorman's voice was provided by Toby Morton. Cultural references and themes Scott Tenorman's favorite band is the British rock band Radiohead. When Jimbo does not know what \\"a radiohead\\" is, Cartman and Ned sing him part of their 1992 song \\"Creep.\\" In Cartman's dubbed video, the band is interviewed on MTV by long-time MTV host Kurt Loder. Loder had previously been parodied in the fourth season episode \\"Timmy 2000.\\" During one of his earlier attempts at tricking Scott into giving back his money, Cartman mentions that rock singer Courtney Love is in South Park, drunk and engaging in public nudity. Cartman's inspiration for the idea of having Scott's penis bitten off by a pony is the film Hannibal, in which \\"the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive.\\" Hannibal, a sequel to the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs, was released a few months before the episode. When Cartman walks away from Scott after he tells him about the Pube Fair at Fort Collins, Cartman tells him \\"Ha ha, charade you are, Scott,\\" referring to Pink Floyd's \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" from Animals. The very ending of the episode, where the iris appears, is an allusion to the Looney Tunes cartoons, with Cartman assuming the role of the stuttering Porky Pig, delivering his signature line \\"That's all folks!\\" The use of the Looney Tunes ending has been seen as an ironic reinforcement of the fact that the episode's tragic plot has overstepped the established boundaries of cartoon comedy. It also has been viewed as a reminder about the fact that even the classic cartoons had \\"a dark side in their own right.\\" The plot of \\"Scott Tenorman Must Die\\" has been compared to that of the Shakespeare tragedy Titus Andronicus, in which the humiliated protagonist also exacts revenge by feeding his enemies their own relatives. Some authors viewed the episode as not only an allusion to the violent Shakespearean tragedy, but an actual retelling of it. Reception and impact \\"Scott Tenorman Must Die\\" is among the most acclaimed episodes of South Park, and is one of the most notorious episodes, according to Stone. \\"Scott Tenorman Must Die\\" is often regarded as the greatest episode of South Park ever made, and has frequently topped many \\"Best of\\" lists for South Park episodes, including lists by IGN, and Kotaku. Parker and Stone choose the episode as one of their eleven favorites in 2003, and one of their ten favorites in 2006. Fans voted the episode into the 2nd place in a major 2011 South Park vote held under the \\"Year of the Fan\\" promotion. The first place was taken by the tenth season episode \\"Make Love, Not Warcraft.\\" The events of this episode are given new meaning in the season fourteen episode \\"201,\\" in which Scott returns as the leader of the Ginger Separatist Movement, revealing to Cartman that, while researching his revenge upon Cartman, Scott learned that his own father Jack Tenorman (a fictional Denver Broncos right tackle) had fathered Cartman with Cartman's mother Liane. This means that Cartman is responsible for his own father's death and feeds him to his half-brother in \\"Scott Tenorman Must Die.\\" In the 2009 video game South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!, the player has to fight Scott Tenorman in a boss fight. In the 2012 game South Park: Tenorman's Revenge, the player is able to control the four main characters of the show, who have to battle Tenorman and his army of gingers, as the kids travel through time. Home release \\"Scott Tenorman Must Die\\" was released on VHS in June 2002, along with the episodes \\"It Hits the Fan\\" and \\"Cripple Fight,\\" on a video titled Insults to Injuries. A DVD version of the compilation was released simultaneously, and also contained \\"Proper Condom Use,\\" in addition to the episodes contained on the VHS release. South Park: The Complete Fifth Season was released on DVD in 2005. South Park ‚Äì The Hits: Volume 1, a DVD compilation which features Parker and Stone's ten favorite episodes, was released in 2006, and contains the episode. Parker and Stone provided short audio commentary for the episode on both The Complete Fifth Season and The Hits DVDs. \\"Scott Tenorman Must Die\\" was also released as part of The Cult of Cartman, a 2008 DVD compilation of Cartman-centric episodes.

Based in the Irish neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen, the Gopher Gang grew to control most of Manhattan with their territory covering Fourth to Forty-Second Street and Seventh to Eleventh Avenue. History =Origins and early years= The Gopher Gang formed from various local street gangs in the 1890s, numbering around 500 members, into what later became a committee including Marty Brennan, Stumpy Malarkey, and Newburg Gallegher. The committee met semi-regularly at their headquarters known as Battle Row, a saloon owned by Mallet Murphy, to discuss robberies and divide profits from Manhattan bordellos and illegal gambling operations.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 235, 321-322) =Murder of William Lennon= Gallagher became involved in a three- year feud with local bartender William Lennon in 1907, their dispute being over a card game, which resulted in several violent altercations between them. The first incident between the two required Gallagher to have stitches after Lennon had repeatedly slashed his face with a knife. Gallagher later claimed that Lennon had threatened to shoot him on sight and engaged him in several gunfights including an incident in December 1909 when Lennon wounded him in a gunfight between the two.\\"Fails To Save His Pal; Long Term for Brennan, Though Gallagher Admits He Killed Lennon\\", New York Times. 24 Nov 1910. On May 17, 1910, he and Marty Brennan entered a saloon where Lennon was working. After another argument between the two, Lennon drew a revolver and shot Gallagher in the stomach (two of these bullets were still lodged in his body at the time of his trial). Gallagher and Brennan entered another saloon at Eleventh Avenue and Forty-Fifth Street where, according to Gallagher, they unexpectedly encountered Lennon who was now working there. Upon spotting the two gang members, he swore at them and apparently went for his hip pocket when Gallagher pulled his pistol and fired three shots, killing him. He and Brennan left the saloon and were arrested shortly after. Charged with manslaughter, Gallagher made a full confession, taking full responsibility for the killing, and claimed that Brennan had taken no part. The two were convicted and given long jail sentences. Gallagher, this being his first criminal offense, was sentenced to serve between 9 and 19 years imprisonment by Judge Foster on November 9, 1910. Despite his efforts, Brennan was also sentenced to 19 years due to a previous prison term in Elmira. =One Lung Curran and decline= In the early 1910s the Gophers were led by One Lung CurranEdwards, Jay. \\"From England to Hot Springs, the life of a gangster\\", Daily Record, March 4, 2019 who was notorious for his attacks on lone patrolmen. Although most police rarely patrolled Hell's Kitchen, and only then in large groups, Curran often stole officers' uniforms and, after taking them back to his girlfriend for alterations, would wear the stolen clothes around the neighborhood. This encouraged other gang members to steal uniforms for themselves, becoming a sort of trend among the prominent gang members.English, T.J. Paddy Whacked: The Untold Story of the Irish American Gangster. New York: HarperCollins, 2005. (pg. 111, 115-116, 118-119) The gang began employing younger apprentice gang members such as the Baby Gophers and other gangs subordinate to the Gophers. These included the Parlor Mob, the Gorillas, and the Rhodes Gang as well as a female gang known as the \\"Lady Gophers\\", led by Battle Annie. The Battle Row Ladies Social and Athletic Club, as they were officially called, acted as reserve members of several hundred women for the Gophers in territorial disputes against rival gangs and as strikebreakers during the next decade. With the death of One Lung Curran in 1917, the gang declined in power, breaking up after most of the gang leaders were arrested by the end of the year. Popular culture The 2002 film Gangs of New York directed by Martin Scorsese provided a fictionalized history of the Civil War-era origin of the competing Irish immigrant crime crews which dominated Five Points. The film explains the social tradition of enduring, if not actually shielding, Irish gangs in Manhattan's Irish-American neighborhoods.

It is notable as being the first major fantasy film to be released that was shot entirely with digital cinematography, using a Sony HDW-F900 CineAlta camera. The band Apocalyptica used scenes from the film in the music video for their song \\"Hope Vol. 2\\", which served as the film's ending theme. Plot In 1830 Paris, private investigator Eug√®ne Vidocq pursues a strange man who is wearing a cowl and a mirrored mask. The man lures Vidocq into a furnace room at a glass factory, and after a long fight, pushes him into the furnace. Hanging onto the ledge, Vidocq asks him to reveal his face. The masked man obliges, and Vidocq lets go, falling into the fire. Journalist √âtienne Boisset goes to Vidocq's colleague, Ren√© Nimier, asking for background to help write Vidocq's biography. Boisset states that he plans to find Vidocq's murderer. Nimier tells him that Lautrennes, Paris' chief of police, asked the pair to investigate the deaths of Belmont and Veraldi, the owners of a cannon factory. Lautrennes believes this is an attempt to undermine the French military in an unstable political climate. Belmont and Veraldi had died in a lightning strike, but during the investigation, Vidocq and Nimier see the powder on a factory worker's clothes catch fire. They interrogate the servant responsible for maintaining Belmont's and Veraldi's suits, who confesses that he received a letter, with cash, ordering him not to clean their jackets. The investigators realize that the lightning would need to be attracted to the men and find metallic pins, decorated with monkey heads, inserted into their hats. Lautrennes orders one of his men, Tauzet, to investigate Vidocq's death. For his part, Boisset sneaks into Nimier's office and retrieves the monkey-head pins. He traces the design to Preah, a dancer in a brothel, and Vidocq's lover. She tells him that Vidocq also tracked her down, and that she told Vidocq that she received a letter, with cash, asking her to put the pins in the hats. She also reveals that the letter included a third targetErnest Lafitte, owner of an orphanage. Preah says that Vidocq rushed to save Lafitte, but the masked murderer got there first. Vidocq pursued the murderer, who seemed to possess magical powers and a mask made from a strange reflective surface. Boisset's investigation leads him to Sylvia, the brothel manager, a journalist named Froissard who is investigating the masked murderer, and Marine Lafitte, wife of Ernest. They reveal that Lafitte, Belmont and Veraldi were narcissists, committed to preventing death by aging. A man with a mirror mask, called the Alchemist, offered them an elixir of eternal youth in return for their cooperation in capturing young maidens for his experiments. The three rich men went along, but later stopped cooperating due to a sense of guilt, so the Alchemist killed them. After Boisset leaves, the Alchemist arrives, killing Froissard and Marine. Boisset's investigation attracts the attention of Tauzet, who notices that the Alchemist is disposing of witnesses, and fears Boisset is next. Boisset sneaks in to retrieve Vidocq's notes, where he encounters Lautrennes and Tauzet. Lautrennes attempts to arrest Boisset, but the journalist escapes. The notes reveal that Vidocq found the Alchemist's lab, where he was using the maidens' blood to create a magic substance for his mask, which grants eternal youth by sucking the souls out of his victims. The Alchemist arrived and attacked Vidocq, who managed to take a piece from the Alchemist's mask before the killer escaped. Vidocq's final note states that the Alchemist would need someone to manufacture the mirrored mask, leading him to the glass factory. Boisset, Nimier and Preah head to the factory, ushered by an artisan, and closely trailed by both Tauzet and Lautrennes. Just as Boisset declares there are no more leads and witnesses, the artisan removes his prosthetic, revealing himself to be Vidocq. It turns out Vidocq had jumped into a secret hole in the furnace wall, which he saw in the reflection of the mirror mask before the Alchemist's reveal to be Boisset himself. Vidocq then admits to faking his own death simply to let Boisset's guard down, as he knows the Alchemist would destroy all clues and witnesses through any means necessary. With his cover blown, Boisset lets out a monstrous roar and dons the Alchemist's mirror mask. Nimier opens fire, but is killed as the Alchemist magically reflects the bullets back at him. Vidocq pursues the Alchemist into a hall of mirrors, where he forces the Alchemist to look into a mirror shard, freeing all the souls trapped inside the mask. Vidocq impales the Alchemist with a shard of mirror and throws him into a river. Although the others insist the Alchemist is dead, Vidocq is unnerved by the lack of a body. At Nimier's funeral, as the characters walk away, the Alchemist's laugh can be heard in the distance, accompanied by the glimmer of his mirror mask.

As the final PAL DVD release shows, the film was shot 25i (interlaced), and only special effects shots were deinterlaced by means of smart field blending (imitating a progressive-type amount of motion blur due to a different shutter speed of progressive modes) during post-production, as the special effects crew obviously was in demand of progressive frames which are easier to process for special effects, before for the final release all normal shots were deinterlaced by means of simple line interpolation instead. The result are video-like appearance of motions in normal shots, and distinctive film-like motions for all effect shots due to the different amount of motion blur resulting from the different deinterlacing methods.

Early life Keeble was born in Quetta, British India, and received his early formal education at the Benedictine Douai School (for both prep school at Ditcham Park and the senior school), and at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. Military career In February 1964 he received a commission into the British Army's Royal Leicestershire Regiment, which was amalgamated into The Royal Anglian Regiment seven months later. He joined the Parachute Regiment in 1972, and was promoted to major serving with 10 Para in 1975.Military profile of Keeble, 'Paradata' website (2019). https://www.paradata.org.uk/people/chris-p- b-keeble On 28‚Äì29 May 1982, at the Battle of Goose Green during the Falklands War, Keeble assumed command of the 2nd Battalion of The Parachute Regiment (2 PARA) after its Commanding Officer, Lieutenant-Colonel H. Jones, had been killed in action. A devout Christian, Keeble, then a Major, took over the leadership of the battalion at a point when its attack upon the Argentine Army position had broken down, having lost 16% of its strength as casualties; it was short of ammunition, had been without sleep for 40 hours, and was in a debilitated condition to face the unknown potential of a counter-attack from the Argentine forces present in the vicinity. After kneeling alone in prayer amongst the burning gorse seeking guidance as to what to do, Keeble conceived the idea of refraining from more attacks to try a psychological ploy, subsequently releasing several captured Argentine prisoners of war in the direction of their Goose Green garrison, carrying messages into it requiring its surrender or threatening it with a fictitious large-scale assault by the British forces, supported by artillery. The Argentine commander, Lieutenant Colonel √çtalo Piaggi, subsequently surrendered the garrison to the Parachute Regiment without further fighting. After the battle, despite popular sentiment among the soldiers of 2 PARA for him to remain in command, but he was replaced by Lt. Col. David Chaundler, who was flown in from the United Kingdom to take command of the battalion. At the end of the conflict Keeble was decorated with the Distinguished Service Order. He then commanded 15 PARA, a Territorial Army Battalion based in Scotland, with its HQ in Glasgow. Keeble finished his military career with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel on 27 September 1987, his final appointment having been a Staff Officer Grade 1 at Allied Forces Central Europe in the Netherlands.

(1922). ; excerpt, \\"Treaty between Japan and Korea, dated February 26, 1876.\\" In Korea, Heungseon Daewongun, who instituted a policy of closing doors to European powers, was forced into retirement by his son King Gojong and Gojong's wife, Empress Myeongseong. France and the United States had already made several unsuccessful attempts to begin commerce with the Joseon dynasty during the Daewongun's era. However, after he was removed from power, many new officials who supported the idea of opening commerce with foreigners took power. While there was political instability, Japan developed a plan to open and exert influence on Korea before a European power could. In 1875, their plan was put into action: the Un'y≈ç, a small Japanese warship was dispatched to present a show of force and survey coastal waters without Korean permission. Background =Ascendancy of the Daewongun= In January 1864, King Cheoljong died without an heir and Gojong ascended the throne at the age of 12. However, King Gojong was too young and the new king's father, Yi Ha-≈≠ng, became the Daewongun or lord of the great court, and ruled Korea in his son's name. Originally the term Daewongun referred to any person who was not actually the king but whose son took the throne. The Daewongun initiated reforms to strengthen the monarchy at the expense of the yangban class. Even before the nineteenth century, the Koreans had only maintained diplomatic relations with its suzerain China and with neighboring Japan. Foreign trade was mainly limited to China conducted at designated locations along the China‚ÄìKorea border, and with Japan through the Waegwan in Pusan. By the mid-nineteenth century Westerners had come to refer to Korea as the Hermit Kingdom. The Daewongun was determined to continue Korea's traditional isolationist policy and to purge the kingdom of any foreign ideas that had infiltrated into the nation. The disastrous events occurring in China, including the First (1839‚Äì1842) and Second Opium wars (1856‚Äì1860), reinforced his determination to separate Korea from the rest of the world. =Western encroachment= From the early to mid-nineteenth century Western vessels began to make frequent appearances in Korean waters, surveying sea routes and seeking trade. The Korean government was extremely wary and referred to these vessels as strange-looking ships. Consequently, several incidents took place. In June 1832, a ship from the British India Company, the Lord Amherst, appeared off the coast of Hwanghae Province seeking trade but was refused. In June 1845 another British warship, , surveyed the coast of Cheju-do and Ch≈èlla province. The following month the Korean government filed a protest with British authorities in Guangzhou through the Chinese government. In June 1846, three French warships dropped anchor off the coast of Chungcheong Province and conveyed a letter protesting persecution of Catholics in the country. In April 1854, two armed Russian vessels sailed along the eastern coast of Hamgyong Province, causing some deaths and injuries among the Koreans they encountered. The incident prompted the Korean government to issue a ban forbidding the people of the province from having any contact with foreign vessels. In January and July 1866, ships manned by the German adventurer Ernst J. Oppert appeared off the coast of Chungcheong Province, seeking trade. In August 1866, an American merchant ship, the General Sherman, appeared off the coast of Pyongan Province, steaming along the Taedong River to the provincial capital of Pyongyang, and asked permission to trade. Local officials refused to enter into trade talks and demanded the ship's departure. A Korean official was then taken hostage aboard the vessel and its crew members fired guns at enraged Korean officials and civilians onshore. The crew then landed ashore and plundered the town in the process killing seven Koreans. The governor of the province Pak Kyu-su ordered his forces to destroy the ship. In the event the General Sherman ran aground on a sandbar and Korean forces burned the ship and killed the ship's entire crew of 23. In 1866 after the execution of several of its Catholic missionaries and Korean Catholics, the French launched a punitive expedition against Korea. Five years later in 1871, the Americans also launched an expedition to Korea. Despite this, the Koreans continued to adhere to isolationism and refused to negotiate to open up the country. =Japanese attempts to establish relations with Korea= During the Edo period, Japan's relations and trade with Korea were conducted through intermediaries with the S≈ç family in Tsushima. A Japanese outpost called the waegwan was allowed to be maintained in Tongnae near Pusan. The traders were confined to the outpost and no Japanese were allowed to travel to the Korean capital at Seoul. During the aftermath of the Meiji restoration in late 1868, a member of the S≈ç daimy≈ç informed the Korean authorities that a new government had been established and an envoy would be sent from Japan. In 1869 the envoy from the Meiji government arrived in Korea carrying a letter requesting to establish a goodwill mission between the two countries; the letter contained the seal of the Meiji government rather than the seals authorized by the Korean Court for the S≈ç family to use. It also used the character ko (Áöá) rather than taikun (Â§ßÂêõ) to refer to the Japanese emperor. The Koreans only used this character only to refer to the Chinese emperor, and to the Koreans it implied ceremonial superiority to the Korean monarch which would make the Korean monarch a vassal or subject of the Japanese ruler. The Japanese were however just reacting to their domestic political situation where the Shogun had been replaced by the emperor. The Koreans remained in the sinocentric world where China was at the centre of interstate relations and as a result refused to receive the envoy. The bureau of foreign affairs wanted to change these arrangements to one based on modern state-to-state relations. Ganghwa incident Un'y≈ç On the morning of September 20, 1875, the Japanese gunboat began surveying the Western coast of Korea. The ship reached Ganghwa Island, which had been a site of violent confrontations between the Koreans and foreign forces during the previous decade. The memories of those confrontations were very fresh, and there was little question that the Korean garrison would shoot at any approaching foreign ship. Nonetheless, Commander Inoue ordered a small boat launched and put ashore a party on Kanghwa Island to request water and provisions. The Korean forts opened fire. The Un'y≈ç brought its superior firepower to bear and silenced the Korean guns. After bombarding the Korean fortifications, the shore party torched several houses on the island and exchanged fire with Korean troops. The Japanese were armed with rifles quickly routed the Koreans who carried matchlock muskets, and thirty-five Korean soldiers were left dead. The Un'yo then attacked another Korean fort on Yeongjong Island and withdrew back to Japan. News of the incident only reached the Japanese government eight days later on September 28, and the following day the government decided to dispatch warships to Pusan to protect Japanese residents there. There were also debates within the government to whether or not to send a mission to Korea to settle the incident. Treaty provisions Diplomatic Record Office of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairsalt= Japan employed gunboat diplomacy to press Korea to sign this unequal treaty. The pact opened up Korea, as Commodore Matthew Perry's fleet of Black Ships had opened up Japan in 1853. According to the treaty, it ended Joseon's status as a tributary state of the Qing dynasty and opened three ports to Japanese trade. The Treaty also granted the Japanese people many of the same rights in Korea that Westerners enjoyed in Japan, such as extraterritoriality. The chief treaty negotiators were Kuroda Kiyotaka, Director of the Hokkaid≈ç Colonization Office, and Shin Heon, General/Minister of Joseon-dynasty Korea. The articles of the treaty were as follows: *Article 1 stated that Korea was a free nation, \\"an independent state enjoying the same sovereign rights as does Japan\\". The Japanese statement is in an attempt to detach Korea once and for all from its traditional tributary relationship with China. *Article 2 stipulated that Japan and Korea would exchange envoys within fifteen months and permanently maintain diplomatic missions in each country. The Japanese would confer with the Ministry of Rites; the Korean envoy would be received by the Foreign Office. *Under Article 3, Japan would use the Japanese and Chinese languages in diplomatic communiques, while Korea would use only Chinese. *Article 4 terminated Tsushima's centuries-old role as a diplomatic intermediary by abolishing all agreements then existing between Korea and Tsushima. *In addition to the open port of Pusan, Article 5 authorized the search in Kyongsang, Kyonggi, Chungcheong, Cholla, and Hamgyong provinces for two more suitable seaports for Japanese trade to be opened in October 1877. *Article 6 secured aid and support for ships stranded or wrecked along the Korea or Japanese coasts. *Article 7 permitted any Japanese mariner to conduct surveys and mapping operations at will in the seas off the Korean Peninsula's coastline. *Article 8 permitted Japanese merchants residence, unhindered trade, and the right to lease land and buildings for those purposes in the open ports. *Article 9 guaranteed the freedom to conduct business without interference from either government and to trade without restrictions or prohibitions. *Article 10 granted Japan the right of extraterritoriality, the one feature of previous Western treaties that was most widely resented in Asia. It not only gave foreigners a free rein to commit crimes with relative impunity, but its inclusion implied the grantor nation's system of law was either primitive, unjust, or both. Aftermath The Imperial Japanese Navy, in Pusan, on its way to Ganghwa Island, Korea, January 16th, 1876. There were 2 warships (Nisshin, Moshun), 3 troop transports, and one liner for the embassy led by Kuroda Kiyotaka. Four Gatling guns set up in Ganghwa by Japanese troops, 1876 Kuroda mission The following year saw a Japanese fleet led by Special Envoy Kuroda Kiyotaka coming over to Joseon, demanding an apology from the Korean government and a commercial treaty between the two nations. The Korean government decided to accept the demand, in hope of importing some technologies to defend the country from any future invasions. However, the treaty would eventually turn out to be the first of many unequal treaties signed by Korea; It gave extraterritorial rights to Japanese citizens in Korea, and forced the Korean government to open 3 ports to Japan, specifically Busan, Incheon and Wonsan. With the signing of its first unequal treaty, Korea became vulnerable to the influence of imperialistic powers; and later the treaty led Korea to be annexed by Japan.

It is free and open-source software, developed originally by a small team at the Department of Physical Geography, University of G√∂ttingen, Germany, and is now being maintained and extended by an international developer community. SAGA GIS is intended to give scientists an effective but easily learnable platform for implementing geoscientific methods. This is achieved by the application programming interface (API). SAGA has a fast-growing set of geoscientific methods, bundled in exchangeable module libraries. The standard modules are: * File access: interfaces to various table, vector, image and grid file formats, including shapefiles, Esri grids (ASCII and binary), and many grid file formats supported by the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL), along with the native SGRD format of SAGA GIS. * Filter for grids: Gaussian, Laplacian, multi-directional Lee filter. * Gridding: interpolation from vector data using triangulation, nearest neighbour, inverse distance. * Geostatistics: residual analysis, ordinary and universal kriging, single and multiple regression analysis, variance analysis. * Grid calculator: combine grids through user defined functions. * Grid discretisation: skeletonisation, segmentation. * Grid tools: merging, resampling, gap filling. * Image classification: cluster analysis, box classification, maximum likelihood, pattern recognition, region growing. * Projections: various coordinate transformations for vector and grid data (using Proj4 and GeoTrans libraries), georeferencing of grids. * Simulation of dynamic processes: TOPMODEL, nitrogen distributions, erosion, landscape development. * Terrain analysis: geomorphometric calculations such as slope, aspect, curvatures, curvature classification, analytical hillshading, sink elimination, flow path analysis, catchment delineation, solar radiation, channel lines, relative altitudes. * Vector tools: polygon intersection, contour lines from grid. SAGA GIS is an effective tool with user friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that requires only about 10 MB disk space. No installation is needed, since SAGA GIS can be run directly from a USB thumb drive if desired. SAGA GIS is available for Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD. SAGA GIS can be used together with other GIS software like Kosmo and QGIS in order to obtain enhanced detail in vector datasets as well as higher-resolution map-production capabilities. SAGA GIS modules can be executed from within the statistical data analysis software R, in order to integrate statistical and GIS analyses. References B√∂hner, J., McCloy, K.R., Strobl, J.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 24, 2004. In the episode, Jimmy enters the special Olympics but starts using steroids to improve his performance. Cartman, believing he will have an advantage over the other children, disguises himself as handicapped so he can enter and win the cash prize. The title of the episode is a parody of the book Up the Down Staircase. In 2000, the actual Spanish Basketball team at the 2000 Summer Paralympics were disqualified and stripped of their gold medal after it was revealed almost none of the players were actually disabled. Plot Timmy and Jimmy, two disabled children in South Park, are eager to participate in the Special Olympics in Denver. Cartman decides to fake being disabled and attempt to beat all the handicapped children in the events to win the $1,000 prize. Jimmy is talked into taking steroids by Nathan to increase his chances of winning. He manages to keep his use of it a secret from everyone except for Timmy (who discovers the drugs after he accidentally dropped the bag and spilling the contents). While Timmy frowns on this, being unable to say anything other than either his own and Jimmy's names, he is unable to explain the situation to the school counselor Mr. Mackey. Jimmy begins to neglect his girlfriend and studies as a result of his steroid use. When his girlfriend grows tired of neglect and announces she is leaving him, Jimmy flies into a steroid rage and savagely attacks his girlfriend and mother. Kyle repeatedly tries to talk Cartman out of his plans but is ignored. At the Special Olympics, the prizes are given by Mark McGwire, Jason Giambi and Barry Bonds. Jimmy sets multiple records and is declared the winner. Cartman, on the other hand, is so out-of-shape that his plan fails miserably when the more athletic handicapped contestants beat him; he nevertheless wins a \\"spirit award\\" - consisting of a gift voucher - for coming last. When he goes to collect the prize, Jimmy recognizes Cartman and is about to attack him, but Timmy intervenes, and Jimmy realises that he is just as much of a cheater himself. Jimmy confesses his drug use to the crowd and returns his medal, asking for his records to be cancelled and that people who use steroids are \\"pussies\\" (all the while the camera focuses on McGwire, Giambi, and Bonds during his speech). The people give Jimmy a standing ovation for being honest, and he says he will be back next year. Cartman then claims to Stan and Kyle that he pretended to be handicapped in order for Jimmy to learn his lesson, but Stan and Kyle don't buy his lies; in anger, Cartman calls them \\"assholes\\" and tells them to \\"grow up\\". Production There was some controversy surrounding \\"Up the Down Steroid\\" and the 2005 film The Ringer, as both feature the same plot: someone pretending to be disabled in order to compete in the Special Olympics.Did Ringer rip off South Park  or vice versa? Entertainment Weekly The Ringer was written and filmed months before this episode was aired, although, The Ringer was not released to the public until after this episode aired. According to the episode's DVD audio commentary, series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone did not think that they ripped off The Ringer, since the idea to them did not seem hard to come up with, and they did not even think it was big enough for a twenty-minute episode let alone a two-hour film. In the opening scene, the boys are playing the same \\"Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis\\" funtime game as they did in the season four episode \\"Cartman Joins NAMBLA\\". The episode's title refers to the 1964 young adult novel Up the Down Staircase, by Bel Kaufman, which was adapted into a film in 1967 starring Sandy Dennis. Trey Parker admitted he had to perform this story in a high school play and hated it. Additionally, Stone admitted in the commentary that he once pretended to be disabled to get into Six Flags Magic Mountain for half price. Home release \\"Up the Down Steroid\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Parks eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 29, 2006. The set includes brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.

It is encountered in nucleophilic substitution. In reaction conditions that favor a SN1 reaction mechanism, the intermediate is a carbocation for which several resonance structures are possible. This explains the product distribution (or product spread) after recombination with nucleophile Y. This type of process is called an SN1' substitution. Alternatively, it is possible for nucleophile to attack directly at the allylic position, displacing the leaving group in a single step, in a process referred to as SN2' substitution. This is likely in cases when the allyl compound is unhindered, and a strong nucleophile is used. The products will be similar to those seen with SN1' substitution. Thus reaction of 1-chloro-2-butene with sodium hydroxide gives a mixture of 2-buten-1-ol and 3-buten-2-ol: :reaction of 1-chloro-2-butene with sodium hydroxide Nevertheless, the product in which the OH group is on the primary atom is minor.

Similar to how there are SN1' and SN2' analogues for SN1 and SN2 reactions respectively, there also is an analogue for SNi, that being the SNi', applicable for reactions betwixt allylic compounds and reagents like SOCl2.

The essay first appeared as a series of three articles published in Fraser's Magazine in 1861 (vol. 64, p. 391‚Äì406, 525‚Äì534, 659‚Äì673); the articles were collected and reprinted as a single book in 1863. via Google Books Mill's aim in the book is to explain what utilitarianism is, to show why it is the best theory of ethics, and to defend it against a wide range of criticisms and misunderstandings. Though heavily criticized both in Mill's lifetime and in the years since, Utilitarianism did a great deal to popularize utilitarian ethicsHenry Sidgwick, Outlines of the History of Ethics. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1988, p. 245. (Originally published in 1902.) and has been considered \\"the most influential philosophical articulation of a liberal humanistic morality that was produced in the nineteenth century.\\"J. B. Schneewind, \\"John Stuart Mill,\\" in Paul Edwards, ed. The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, vol. 5. New York: Macmillan, 1967, p. 319.  Summary  Mill took many elements of his version of utilitarianism from Jeremy Bentham, the great nineteenth-century legal reformer, who along with William Paley were the two most influential English utilitarians prior to Mill. Like Bentham, Mill believed that happiness (or pleasure, which both Bentham and Mill equated with happiness) was the only thing humans do and should desire for its own sake. Since happiness is the only intrinsic good, and since more happiness is preferable to less, the goal of the ethical life is to maximize happiness. This is what Bentham and Mill call \\"the principle of utility\\" or \\"the greatest-happiness principle.\\" Both Bentham and Mill thus endorse \\"classical\\" or \\"hedonistic\\" forms of utilitarianism. More recent utilitarians often deny that happiness is the sole intrinsic good, arguing that a variety of values and consequences should be considered in ethical decision making.Geoffrey Scarre, Utilitarianism. New York: Routledge, 1996, pp. 133-151. Although Mill agreed with Bentham about many of the foundational principles of ethics, he also had some major disagreements. In particular, Mill tried to develop a more refined form of utilitarianism that would harmonize better with ordinary morality and highlight the importance in the ethical life of intellectual pleasures, self-development, high ideals of character, and conventional moral rules. = Chapter 1 = In Chapter 1, titled \\"General Remarks,\\" Mill notes that there has been little progress in ethics. Since the beginning of philosophy, the same issues have been debated over and over again, and philosophers continue to disagree sharply over the basic starting points of ethics. Mill argues that these philosophical disputes have not seriously damaged popular morality, largely because conventional morality is substantially, though implicitly, utilitarian. He concludes the chapter by noting that he will not attempt to give a strict \\"proof\\" of the greatest- happiness principle. Like Bentham, Mill believed that ultimate ends and first principles cannot be demonstrated, since they lie at the foundation of everything else that we know and believe. Nevertheless, he claims, \\"[c]onsiderations may be presented capable of determining the intellect,\\"John Stuart Mill, Utilitarianism. Buffalo: Prometheus Books, 1987, pp. 16-17. which amount to something close to a proof of the principle of utility. = Chapter 2 = In the second chapter, Mill formulates a single ethical principle, the principle of utility or greatest-happiness principle, from which he says all utilitarian ethical principles are derived: \\"The creed which accepts as the foundation of morals utility, or the greatest happiness principle, holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure.\\"Mill, Utilitarianism, pp. 16-17. Mill then spends the bulk of Chapter 2 responding to a number of common criticisms of utilitarianism. These include charges that utilitarianism: * is a doctrine worthy only of swine (for holding that pleasure is the only thing that is desirable for its own sake) (p. 17) * fails to recognize that happiness is unobtainable (p. 23) * is too demanding (for claiming that it is always our duty to create the greatest possible happiness in the world) (p. 29) * makes people cold and unsympathetic (by focusing solely on the consequences of actions, rather than on features such as motives and character, which require a more sensitive and empathetic response) (p. 31) * is a godless ethics (by failing to recognize that ethics is rooted in God's commands or will) (p. 33) * confuses goodness with expediency (p. 34) * fails to recognize that in making ethical decisions there usually isn't time to calculate future consequences (p. 35) * tempts people to disobey ordinary moral rules (by inviting them to ignore such rules when they appear to conflict with the general happiness) (p. 37) In response to the charge that utilitarianism is a doctrine fit only for swine, Mill abandons Bentham's view that pleasures differ only in quantity, not quality. He notes that most people who have experienced both physical and intellectual pleasures tend to greatly prefer the latter. Few people, he claims, would choose to trade places with an animal, a fool, or an ignoramus for any amount of bodily pleasure they might thereby acquire. And since \\"the sole evidence it is possible to produce that something is desirable, is that people do actually desire it,\\"Mill, Utilitarianism, p. 50. it follows that intellectual pleasures (e.g., the pleasures of friendship, art, reading, and conversation) are higher and more desirable kinds of pleasures than bodily pleasures, and that a rational pursuit of one's long-term happiness requires development of one's higher faculties. In reply to the objection that there generally isn't enough time to calculate how a given act might affect the long-term general happiness, Mill sketches a kind of \\"two-tier\\" approach to ethics that accords an important place to moral rules in ethical decision-making.Richard Norman, The Moral Philosophers: An Introduction to Ethics, 2nd ed. New York: Oxford, 1998. p. 100. Mill argues that traditional moral rules such as \\"Keep your promises\\" and \\"Tell the truth\\" have been shown by long experience to promote the welfare of society. Normally we should follow such \\"secondary principles\\" without reflecting much on the consequences of our acts. As a rule, only when such second-tier principles conflict is it necessary (or wise) to appeal to the principle of utility directly.Mill, Utilitarianism, pp. 35-37. = Chapter 3 = In the third chapter, Mill asks what \\"sanctions\\" (that is, rewards and punishments) undergird the obligation to promote the general happiness. He explores a variety of ways in which both external and internal sanctions ‚Äì that is, the incentives provided by others and the inner feelings of sympathy and conscience ‚Äì encourage people to think about how their actions affect the happiness of others. The ultimate sanction, Mill claims, is internal. Humans are social animals who naturally desire \\"to be in unity with our fellow creatures.\\"Mill, Utilitarianism, p. 45. To prefer selfish goals over the public good runs counter to this deep-seated natural impulse. = Chapter 4 = In the fourth chapter Mill offers his famous quasi-proof of the greatest- happiness principle. The core of his argument is this: #Everyone desires happiness. #The only proof that something is desirable is that people do actually desire it. #So, each person's happiness is a good to that person. #Therefore, the general happiness is a good to the aggregate of all persons.Mill Utilitarianism, p. 50. Many critics have claimed that this argument relies on a dubious assumption about how individual happiness is related to the general happiness.Scarre, Utilitarianism, p. 97. There might be times when the general happiness can only be promoted by sacrificing the happiness of certain individuals. In such cases, is the general happiness a good to those individuals? Other critics have questioned whether it makes sense to speak of aggregates as having desires,Sidgwick, Outlines of the History of Ethics, p. 246. or whether the fact that something is desired proves that it is desirable.Scarre, Utilitarianism, p. 97; G. E. Moore, Principia Ethica. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1903, p. 67. = Chapter 5 = The fifth and longest chapter concludes by discussing what Mill considers \\"the only real difficulty\\"Mill, Utilitarianism, p. 83. with utilitarian ethics: whether it might sometimes license acts of flagrant injustice. Critics of utilitarianism often claim that judging actions solely in terms of their effects on the general happiness is incompatible with a robust respect for individual rights and a duty to treat people as they deserve. Mill appreciates the force of this objection and argues #that feelings of justice are rooted in both a natural human desire to retaliate for injuries and a natural instinct for sympathy for those who have been wrongly injured; #that justice has a utilitarian basis since an injustice is committed only when a person's rights have been violated, and an alleged right should be protected by society only when doing so promotes the general happiness; #that people disagree deeply about what sorts of things are and are not just, and utilitarianism provides the only rational basis for resolving such conflicts. Influence Mill's Utilitarianism remains \\"the most famous defense of the utilitarian view ever written\\"Scarre, Utilitarianism, p. 82. and is still widely assigned in university ethics courses around the world. Largely owing to Mill, utilitarianism rapidly became the dominant ethical theory in Anglo- American philosophy.J. B. Schneewind, Sidgwick's Ethics and Victorian Moral Philosophy. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978, p. 174. Though some contemporary ethicists would not agree with all elements of Mill's moral philosophy, utilitarianism remains a live option in ethical theory today.

It simultaneously removes some kinds of dead code and propagates constants throughout a program. Moreover, it can find more constant values, and thus more opportunities for improvement, than separately applying dead code elimination and constant propagation in any order or any number of repetitions.Wegman, Mark N. and Zadeck, F. Kenneth. \\"Constant Propagation with Conditional Branches.\\" ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, 13(2), April 1991, pages 181-210.Click, Clifford and Cooper, Keith. \\"Combining Analyses, Combining Optimizations\\", ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, 17(2), March 1995, pages 181-196 The algorithm operates by performing abstract interpretation of the code in SSA form. During abstract interpretation, it typically uses a flat lattice of constants for values and a global environment mapping SSA variables to values in this lattice. The crux of the algorithm comes in how it handles the interpretation of branch instructions. When encountered, the condition for a branch is evaluated as best possible given the precision of the abstract values bound to variables in the condition. It may be the case that the values are perfectly precise (neither top nor bottom) and hence, abstract execution can decide in which direction to branch. If the values are not constant, or a variable in the condition is undefined, then both branch directions must be taken to remain conservative. Upon completion of the abstract interpretation, instructions which were never reached are marked as dead code. SSA variables found to have constant values may then be inlined at (propagated to) their point of use.  Notes   References  Cooper, Keith D. and Torczon, Linda. Engineering a Compiler.

The Age of Misrule is a three-book modern fantasy novel series, written by Mark Chadbourn. It is set in Britain and the faery Otherworld around the beginning of the third millennium. The Age of Misrule consists of three novels: World's End, Darkest Hour, and Always Forever. This series is followed by The Dark Age series. Plot summary The story starts in January. The audience is not told what year it is: sometime after December 31, 1999, but not very long. It follows a man and a woman, both of whom have had loved ones taken from them in unpleasant circumstances. They see a man being killed by a giant. When they investigate, they discover that the man had been contacting UFOlogists. The two protagonists decide to go on a trip to find out more. They meet an old hippie named Thomas, who saves them from a Fabulous Beast (a dragon). He informs them that they are being followed, and they hide out in Stonehenge, protected by the ley energy of the monument. Thomas then informs them that the world has changed, most forms of modern technology have ceased to function while magic now works according to its traditional lore, and that mythic creatures - Fabulous Beasts, elementals, and most importantly, the Fomorians and the Tuatha De Danann - are coming back to the world. The Fomorians have arrived first, however, and the Tuatha de Danann can only be summoned by a group called the Brothers and Sisters of Dragons. Apparently roped into this, they agree to help. By the end of the first book of the three-book series, the initial idea - that the evil Fomorians would be dragged back to the Otherworld by the good fairies - has been shattered. It seems that Celtic cosmology is much closer to Lovecraftian ideals (Evil vs. Indifferent) than to Christian ones (Evil vs. Good), despite the fact, it is hinted, that the spirit beings are the basis of all religions anyway. The Tuatha are as keen as the Fomorians to stay, and the heroes are left knowing that the world will never be the same again. The heroes then realise that they were chosen by the mysterious 'earth energy', and that they can use this energy to inspire others and fight the Fomorians themselves. They fight back and, in a final battle in London, apparently win. However, the Brothers and Sisters of Dragons are shattered, one dead, one lost in the Otherworld, and the last three to pass the story on. An interesting twist on the classic 'otherworldly conspiracy' story is that, rather than fairy myths being ancient misinterpretations of UFO abductions, the UFO stories are presented as modern misinterpretations of fairy myths. Characters =Mortals= Brothers and Sisters of DragonsJack Churchill, or Church, was training as an archaeologist, but upon the suicide of his girlfriend Marianne, he lost his faith in himself and was reduced to writing manuals. His knowledge of ancient religion and holy sites, from his time at university, is very helpful. He is the symbolic 'King', holding the Quincunx together. *Ruth Gallagher was chosen by the Goddess to find Cernunnos. As a result of this task, she developed into an accomplished witch. Her life was changed when her uncle was killed in a bank robbery, causing her father to have a heart attack. Her lack of belief in the afterlife hit her cruelly. *Laura DuSantiago's fundamentalist mother abused her as a child, but she escaped to university. When she returned home, her mother carved 'Jesus loves you' on her back. In the ensuing struggle, the mother was killed. She is a kind woman, hiding behind a callous facade. *Ryan Veitch had nightmares about monsters during his childhood, but these stopped when he got the dream- monsters tattooed on himself. During a bank robbery, he was compelled to shoot Mr. Gallagher, but his brothers allowed him to flee, escaping gaol. Realizing the depth of their sacrifice has made him want to help those around him. Despite this, he is often derided by his friends. *Shavi was the member of a Muslim family, but his rejection of their faith led his father to cast him out. He developed an interest in leylines, druidry, and his own sexuality; what may be called Shamanism in the modern world. While leaving a gay bar, he and his boyfriend were attacked by a stranger, resulting in the death of his boyfriend. OthersTom, or Thomas Learmont, serves as the group's guide and advisor. In the 13th century he was carried off to the Otherworld, where his singing voice endeared him to the Queen. He was 'taken apart', then put back together. As a result of this, he can partially see the future and cannot lie. Briefly, he became involved in Scottish politics, before being chased back into the Otherworld. As a result of spending half his life in the Otherworld, he has managed to survive into modern times. He thoroughly enjoyed the sixties, during which he was 'spiritual advisor' to the Grateful Dead. *James is a priest at Glastonbury. He is a member of the Watchmen, a group selected from Anglican priests in and around Glastonbury to safeguard knowledge of a gate to the Otherworld on top of Glastonbury Tor. Later, he was librarian at the cathedral of Salisbury. *Callow is a well mannered gent who has fallen on hard times and speaks with The Brother and Sisters of Dragons briefly before they continue on their journey. He is captured by Calatin and is tortured and twisted into something more than human. He is described as having \\"Lidless staring eyes\\" and walking in a skittering motion. His ultimate fate following Always Forever is unknown. =Immortals=The Lady, the spirit of the growing season (spring, summer, autumn) and the sacred feminine. Also known as the Triple Goddess, Hecate, Brigid and the Virgin Mary. *The Lord, the spirit of the cold time (winter) and masculinity. Stayed with humans the longest, even when the others left. Also known as Cernunnos, Odin and Robin Hood. *Nuada, the leader of the Golden Ones. Officially thanks the Brothers and Sisters of Dragons for returning the Tuatha De Danann to the world. Proud and handsome, but cold and inhuman. Also known as Lud, Nudd, and Tiwaz. *Ogma, librarian and wisest of the Golden Ones. One of the few good immortals seen in the first book. *Dian Cecht, the healer of the Golden Ones, who appears in the second book 'Darkest Hour'. He is hard and cruel.

The Museum of Islamic Era was later built with white travertine on the grassy grounds of the Museum of Ancient Iran. It has gone through quite a few hasty interior changes, and was still being remodeled when the 1979 Revolution swept the country. General View of Iran Bastan Museum, Iran National Museum, Tehran 2020 While the Museum of Ancient Iran always had a clear mandate to show archaeological relics, as well as some rare medieval textiles and rug pieces, the newer complex began to also feature the exquisite Amlash pottery from prehistoric Caspian Sea regions of Iran. This followed some modern works, and the repeated gutting and remodeling of the interior. The Museum of Ancient Iran consists of two floors. Its halls contain artifacts and fossils from the Lower, Middle, and Upper Paleolithic, as well as the Neolithic, Chalcolithic, early and late Bronze Age, and Iron Ages I-III, through the Median, Achaemenid, Seleucid, Parthian, and Sassanian eras. The newer complex consists of three floors. It contains various pieces of pottery, textiles, texts, artworks, astrolabes, and adobe calligraphy, from Iran's post-classical era. Organizational chart of National Museum of Iran Collections The oldest artifacts kept at the museum are from Kashafrud, Darband, and Shiwatoo, which date back to the Lower Paleolithic period. Mousterian stone tools made by Neanderthals are also on display at the first hall of the Museum of Ancient Iran. The most important Upper Paleolithic tools are from Yafteh, dating back about 30,000 to 35,000 years. There are also 9,000-year-old human and animal figurines from Sarab mound in Kermanshah, among many other ancient artifacts. Exhibitions The ground floor of the newer complex has been dedicated to contemporary exhibitions. Temporary exhibition galleries are featured two or three times annually, and usually run for about one to two months. One of the most successful exhibitions, entitled Evidence for Two Hundred Thousand Years of Human-Animal Bonds in Iran, ran from August to October 2014.\\"The Guardian's report about exhibition\\" The exhibition was mainly about the relation and coexistence of past human societies and various animal species in Iran, since the late Lower Paleolithic to modern decades.

He is the brother to King Hamlet, second husband to Gertrude and uncle and later stepfather to Prince Hamlet. He obtained the throne of Denmark by murdering his brother with poison and then marrying the late king's widow. He is loosely based on the Jutish chieftain Feng who appears in Chronicon Lethrense and in Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum. There has never been an actual Danish King of that name. Overview Claudius is seen at the beginning of the play to be a capable monarch as he deals diplomatically with such issues as the military threat from Norway and Hamlet's depression. It is not until the appearance of King Hamlet's Ghost in the courtyard that the reader questions his motives. During the play's progression he takes a turn for the worse by first resorting to spying, and, when that fails, murder. Der Kronenr√§uber (\\"The Crown Thief\\": Claudio [sic] Murders His Brother, King Hamlet, By Pouring Poison into His Ear as He Lies Sleeping in the Garden) (Johann Heinrich Lips and Henry Fuseli, 1806) It is in Act III Scene 3, when Claudius forestalls Hamlet's revenge by confessing his sins to God in his own private chapel, that the audience can be sure of his guilt. He is shown to be discontent and unhappy with the events taking place. The young prince spies him brooding about his wrongdoings and trying to pray for forgiveness, but he knows all too well that prayer alone will not save him if he continues to benefit from his own sin. If he were to truly repent, he would have to confess his sin and give up all he achieved through it, which he chooses not to do. Despite his remorse, the king still seeks Hamlet's death in an effort to save both his throne and his life, as he believes the prince is now aware of his part in King Hamlet's death. Hamlet is ready to kill him, only to back down, feeling that to kill the king in such a way would contradict the revenge conditions given to him by his father, who commanded him specifically: \\"Taint not thy mind.\\" When Laertes seeks revenge for his father Polonius' death at Hamlet's hands, Claudius finally concocts a 'surefire' plan to deal with Hamlet once and for all. He arranges a fencing match between Hamlet and Laertes, but plots with Laertes to poison his foil and give Hamlet a poisoned drink. The king's plan fails; Queen Gertrude drinks from the poisoned chalice instead of Hamlet and dies, and Hamlet, after being struck by the poisoned foil, captures the same sword and strikes Laertes, who then finally reveals Claudius' plot. As Norway's army, led by young Prince Fortinbras, surrounds the castle, Hamlet finally exacts his revenge and slays Claudius by stabbing him with the sword and then forcing him to drink the poison that he had intended for Hamlet. Interpretation The character Claudius is both the major antagonist of the piece and a complex individual. He is the villain of the piece, as he admits to himself: \\"O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven\\" (Act III, Scene 3, Line 40), yet his remarkable self-awareness and remorse complicates Claudius's villain status, much like Macbeth. Claudius's fratricide is the corruption permeating the play's world ‚Äì that which is, in the words of Marcellus (a guard), \\"something ‚Ä¶ rotten in the state of Denmark.\\" Shakespeare reminds the audience of the crime several times by having characters mention the story of Cain and Abel, including Claudius himself, who admits being inflicted with \\"the primal eldest curse.\\" Claudius's cruelty is reflected in his schemes to kill Hamlet ‚Äì sending him to England to be killed, as well as setting up a rigged fencing match. Claudius is also a heavy drinker, proposing numerous toasts and presiding over a rowdy court; he appropriately succumbs to his own poisoned wine. The king is not without redeeming virtues, though. He is seen to be an able monarch (notwithstanding the unfavourable comparison to his murdered predecessor in Hamlet's first soliloquy) as well as a quick thinker and smooth talker, who in Act IV, Scene 5 converts Laertes from rebel to accomplice. In Act III, Scene 1 he fleetingly shows remorse for his crimes, and attempts to pray in Scene 3, even as he realises that he cannot sincerely repent (\\"Words without thoughts never to heaven go\\"), and eventually continues in his evil ways. Most commentators agree that the king's evil nature is evident, and that the other aspects of his nature exemplify Shakespeare's ability to portray his villains as fully human. The king is named after the Roman emperor Claudius, who was considered the archetype of an evil ruler in Shakespeare's time. The historical Claudius's incestuous marriage to and alleged poisoning by Agrippina the Younger, who was later herself murdered by her son Nero, are mirrored in the play, as Hamlet himself appears to note in Act III, Scene 2: \\"Soft! now to my mother. / O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever / The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom ....\\" Although the character is referred to as \\"Claudius, King of Denmark\\" in one stage direction, the name \\"Claudius\\" is never spoken by any character in the play. Portrayals Eduard von Winterstein portrayed Claudius in the 1921 German silent film adaptation of Hamlet. Basil Sydney portrayed Claudius in Laurence Olivier's film adaptation of Hamlet. Alan Bates portrays Claudius as a drunken, buffoonish, craven schemer in Franco Zeffirelli's film adaptation of Hamlet. In Kenneth Branagh's 1996 film version of Hamlet, Claudius is played by Derek Jacobi. Jacobi had not only been Branagh's mentor as an actor, but had previously played Hamlet himself with Patrick Stewart playing Claudius in a BBC production. In Michael Almereyda's 2000 film version of Hamlet, Claudius is played by Kyle MacLachlan. Patrick Stewart once again portrayed Claudius with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2008, in a production directed by Gregory Doran. Clive Owen portrayed Claudius in Claire McCarthy's 2018 film Ophelia. Characters modelled on Claudius Claudius also inspired the character Miraz in C. S. Lewis' novel Prince Caspian, part of The Chronicles of Narnia series. Ron Perlman portrays Clay Morrow in the television series Sons of Anarchy, which relies heavily on the general plot structure of Hamlet; his character is based on Claudius. Ron Perlman has said, \\"I'm sure they're going to stick to the structure of Hamlet all the way to the end\\" of the series. In Disney's The Lion King, the villain, Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons in 1994 and Chiwetel Ejiofor in 2019), is modelled after Claudius; both characters murder their brothers and dissemble to their nephews to ascend to the throne.

Autodynamics never gained status as a viable alternative model within the physics community, and today is wholly rejected by mainstream science. Main tenets of autodynamics The primary claim of autodynamics is that the equations of the Lorentz transformation are incorrectly formulated to describe relativistic effects, which would invalidate special relativity, general relativity, and Maxwell's equations. The effect of the revised equations proposed in autodynamics is to cause particle mass to decrease with particle velocity, being exchanged with kinetic energy (with mass being zero and kinetic energy being equal to the rest mass at c). This exchange between mass and energy is the proposed mechanism underlying most of the derived conclusions of autodynamics. Ancillary predictions of autodynamics include: *the nonexistence of the neutrino, *the existence of additional particles that have not been observed by mainstream physicists (including the \\"picograviton\\" and the \\"electromuon\\"), *the existence of additional decay modes for muons and interaction modes for energetic atomic nuclei. Status of autodynamics Autodynamics is wholly rejected by the mainstream scientific community. Since Carezani's original publication, no papers on autodynamics have appeared in the scientific literature, except for additional papers by Carezani published in alternative journals such as Physics Essays. A 1999 article in the magazine Wired quotes H. Pierre Noyes, a professor at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, as stating, \\"autodynamics was disproved. Special relativity is correct\\". Noyes was a researcher in an experiment attempting to compare the predictions of SR and AD, and concluded that the values calculated by SR were significantly closer to what was observed. D.R. Walz, H.P. Noyes, and R.L. Carezani, Phys. Rev. A 29:2110-2113 (1984), A Calorimetric Test of Special Relativity Carezani later argued that the experiment was not relevant for comparing the two theories by pointing out that AD applies specifically to decay cases, yet the electrons in the Noyes experiment received energy from the external medium (klystron EM field).See endnote 2 of: Ricardo Carezani, The Muon Decay muon+ -> e+ e+ e+ and Autodynamics, Physics Essays: Volume 5, no. 1, March 1992 According to Lee Smolin, there has been \\"no serious attempt [by the autodynamics supporters] to make an argument or to discuss experimental data that refute their basic claims\\".

The text appears only once in a single Coptic codex, and is heavily damaged. The surviving portions indicate that the general content is a dialogue with Jesus, in a similar manner to, and possibly based on, the Gospel of Thomas. Contents Thomas the Apostle The text is somewhat peculiarly constructed, containing also a few large interruptions seemingly out of place within, and only superficially edited into, the dialogue. Starting with a series of questions ultimately concerning esoteric knowledge and its pursuit, the text abruptly turns to a description of the origin of the world, interrupted briefly by a return to dialogue. Having expounded the description of creation, it returns to the Gnostic question and answer session about how to achieve salvation via gnosis, but is abruptly interrupted by a natural history list of the Four Elements, the powers of heaven and earth, and so forth. After the history list, there is an apocalyptic vision, in which Didymus Judas Thomas, Mary, and Matthew, are shown hell from the safety of the edge of the earth, and an angel announces that the material world was an unintended evil creation (see Yaltabaoth). Finally, the text returns to the question-based dialogue. Composition The rather artificial manner in which other texts (the vision of hell, the natural history list, and the creation theory) appear to have been inserted into a question-based dialogue, and the abrupt change halfway through from referring to Jesus as Lord to referring to him as Saviour, has led many to propose that it is based on four or five different original works. However, due to the damage that the text has suffered, study of it has so far proven too difficult to identify what these texts might be (although the dialog shares an affinity with the Gospel of Thomas). The final redaction is estimated to have taken place around 150 AD.

It is sometimes known as Sanborn's long- nosed bat or the Mexican long-nosed bat, though the latter name is better avoided since it is also used for the entire genus Leptonycteris and for one of the other species in it, the greater long-nosed bat (L. nivalis). Originally described as a subspecies of the greater long-nosed bat, it was later considered a subspecies of the southern long-nosed bat, before being confirmed as a distinct species. Enthusiasts for the bats often refer to them simply as leptos because they are the best known members of the genus Leptonycteris. The scientific name is derived from the type locality, near Yerbabuena in Guerrero, Mexico. Description Lesser long-nosed bats are relatively small bats, with a total length as adults of around , and weighing between , depending on the time of year. Males and females are similar in size, and virtually indistinguishable. As their common name implies, they have a long, narrow snout, and this terminates in a small triangular nose-leaf. While they do have three internal caudal vertebrae, they have no visible tail. The tongue of lesser long-nosed bats has a number of adaptations for lapping nectar, including long ridges and rough, conical papillae, which may also help protect against periodontal disease by scraping the teeth clean. Their wings have a high wing loading, allowing for energy efficient long-distance flight in open habitats, at the expense of manoeuvrability. Only three other species of North American bat have a nose-leaf, and two of these, the Mexican long- tongued bat, and the California leaf-nosed bat, have a distinct tail, and also, in the latter case, much larger ears than lesser long-nosed bats do. They are more easily confused with their close relatives, the greater long- nosed bats, but, in addition to being about 10% larger, the latter have shorter, greyish fur, and proportionately longer wings. Adult lesser long- nosed bats are yellow-brown or grey above, with rusty brown fur below. Their ears are small. Distribution and habitat Lesser long-nosed bats inhabit semi-arid grassland, scrub, or forest habitats below about . They are able to tolerate unusually high temperatures of up to , due in part to a low metabolic rate. They do not enter torpor or hibernate, but die at ambient temperatures of below about . In the north, they reach southern California, Arizona and New Mexico. However, they are only found as summer migrants in the United States and, more generally, north of the mid-Sonora, arriving in these regions between April and July, and migrating south again in September. Some individuals have been estimated to migrate as far as each year. Their migratory patterns have been shown to follow a path determined by seasonal availability of food plants, with cacti, Agave, and plants of the C3 metabolic pathway being strong predictors of distribution. They are found year-round in the western and southern parts of Mexico, and along the east coast, and in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. There are no recognised subspecies. Diet and behaviour Lesser long-nosed bats feed mainly on nectar from night-blooming plants such as saguaro, organ pipe cactus, as well as century plant and other agaves. They are important pollinators of night-blooming cactus. They may also eat some cactus fruits, and, during the winter, on pollen from a range of other plants as the opportunity arises. Lesser long- nosed bats roost during the day in large colonies of up to several thousand individuals in caves or abandoned mines, dispersing at night to feed. The size and composition of such colonies varies throughout the year, as the bats migrate to summer feeding grounds. At some times of the year, many colonies become occupied only by nursing females and their young, with males occupying smaller temporary roosts. Reproduction The breeding season lasts from November to December for bats that migrate northward during the summer, but from May to June in those that give birth in the south. Despite the presence of two distinct mating seasons, individual bats mate only once a year. Gestation lasts about six months, and results in the birth of a single pup, during the time of local peak flower availability. Newborn young weigh and are fully weaned at four to eight weeks of age. They are able fly after a month, but do not begin to exit the maternity cave for a further two to three weeks. They are known to live for up to at least eight years in the wild.

Although some of them become official Indian reservations, they differ from most reservations in that they are placed where Native Americans could find employment in mainstream American economy. Many were originally formed without federal encouragement or sanction. Locations and establishment Indian colonies are especially common in Nevada. As the Great Basin ecosystem is very fragile, native lifeways became untenable soon after white settlement due to livestock over-grazing, water diversions and the felling of Pinyon pine groves. At that time there were few official reservations in the area, and those were terribly run even by contemporary standards. Many Native Americans chose instead to seek jobs in white ranches, farms and cities. The areas in which they settled became known as Indian Camps or Colonies. In some cases they owned the land they settled on, in other cases they settled on public land. Starting in the early twentieth century, the federal government began establishing Indian trust territories for the colonies on public land. Following the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, many of the Indian colonies gained federal recognition as tribes. Many of the tribes formed this way are unusual in that they include members from different nations. For example, the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony has members with Washoe, Paiute and Shoshone heritage.

His career began in the 1960s, and his first single was the song \\"Dzaghigner\\" (), which quickly gained popularity among Lebanese and diaspora Armenians. Harmandian is considered a pioneer of the estradayin genre of Armenian music. Songs in the genre, such as Harmandian's own \\"Noun√©\\" () or \\"Karoun Karoun\\" () are primarily sung in Armenian, and were influential in the formation of Armenian identity in Lebanon, the Middle East and throughout the Armenian diaspora. Harmandian has released 29 albums and around 400 songs and has received numerous awards, both abroad and in Armenia.

After several member changes and a couple years of inactivity, Silver Ash currently consists of original members Ling (vocals) and Zhen (drums), guitarist Yue, and bassist Cain. They are known as the first Chinese visual rock band and have played a significant role in increasing the movement's popularity in China.China Daily Sights and sounds, Chen Nan, January 9, 2010. Retrieved September 10, 2011 History The original line-up of Silver Ash included Ling (vocals), Lucy (guitar), Nancy (guitar), Hong (bass), and Zhen (drums). The band was produced by the Gorgeous Devil Studio and Scream Records from 2000-2005. Guitarist Nancy left the group before they signed to Scream Records. They toured China in 2002, performing in ten cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. In 2005, they chose to leave Scream Records and were without a record label (and still are). Due to personal reasons, some of the Silver Ash members were forced to leave the band. Guitarist Lucy was replaced by Yue. After much deliberation, Hong had to leave the band and was replaced by new bassist Yu. From there, they added Bai Niao (White Bird), on keyboard. Previously, Bai Niao was the vocalist and keyboardist of another Chinese visual rock band called Frozen Blood (ÂÜªÁªìÁöÑË°ÄÊ∂≤). Silver Ash has faced a lot of difficulties. The other band members had left Silver Ash temporarily to pursue their careers, leaving only Ling for a short period of time. They were also scheduled to tour the US in 2003-2004, but it was canceled due to the SARS scare. It was last heard that they were still without a record label as well, but were given various offers from Japanese record labels such as Avex Trax. They were previously signed to Toshiba-EMI but were released from the contract again due to government problems. They have not released an album since 2005, citing the slumping economy and reluctant record label companies. Silver Ash held a live on August 30, 2006 with Japanese band La'cryma Christi, particularly to be viewed by the production company Sweet Child. They have also performed with the Japanese bands Rice and Gram‚àûMaria. =Relaunch of activities= In 2011, Silver Ash released a limited 1000-run press of a new single, \\"Pretty But Evil\\". The international digital release of the track on January 4, 2013, inaugurated the beginning of their comeback. They are currently working on a new release which is slated to drop sometime in March or April 2013, for which there will be both English and Japanese versions in addition to their native Chinese. They are currently being represented by EINSOF Marketing Group.

His Armenian dance, folk, and revolutionary and romantic songs make him a favorite among Armenians worldwide.  Early life  In his early teens, he took lessons in many musical instruments including the guitar, the bouzouki and saz (stringed instruments), the dhol (drums) and the piano, later forming a band called Erebouni. His interest in music was initially influenced by his mother, a singer. Erebouni went from village to village playing everything from Charles Aznavour to Deep Purple and Elvis, at weddings and universities. Due to restrictions under the Soviet Union, Harout and most of his family left Soviet Armenia in 1975. After a year in Lebanon, he went to Los Angeles and took up residence in Hollywood. He has one son, who was born in 1980.  Music career  Only two months after his arrival in L.A. Harout put together a studio band and recorded his first album, \\"Our Eyir Astvats\\" (Where Were You, God?), in reference to the Armenian Genocide at the Quad Teck studio. That first album barely resembles the sound he has since become known for. Instead of the duduk or synths, there are clarinet, organ and a lot of bass. Only a few of the songs on the first are dance-oriented, differing from the material that later made him popular at weddings. This made him popular and branded him the nickname \\"The Armenian Wedding Singer\\". Harout Pamboukjian with Ruben Hakhverdyan in Yerevan, 2012 Harout has interpreted songs composed by artists such as Ruben Hakhverdyan, Robert Amirkhanyan and Arthur Meschian. But it's the centuries-old folk tunes about protecting the soil and fighting in the highlands‚Äî\\"Antranik Pasha,\\" \\"Sassouni Orore,\\" \\"Msho Aghchig\\"‚Äîthat appeal to his fans' nationalistic pride. He's most fond of Rouben Hakhverdian, including the 1996 almost all-acoustic \\"Yerke Nayev Aghotk Eh\\" (Songs Are Also Prayers). Harout has also covered favorites like \\"Nun√©\\". A year after the 1988 Armenian earthquake, which killed 25,000 people and left many more homeless, hundreds of thousands of fans looking for some kind of temporary diversion from the devastation, packed the Hrazdan stadium and Karen Demirchyan Complex to hear 28 concerts by Harout. In 2008, Harout appeared as children's music singer Bread Harrity on the sketch comedy show Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, performing a song about spaghetti and meatballs. Pamboukjian has released over 20 albums. Some of his famous interpretations include \\"Asmar Aghchig\\" (Dark Skinned Girl), \\"Zokanch\\" (Mother-in-law), \\"Msho Aghchig\\" (Girl from Mush), \\"Msho Dashter\\" (Fields of Mush), \\"Hye Kacher\\" (Armenian Heroes), \\"50 Daree\\" (50 Years) and \\"Hey Jan Ghapama\\" Discography Studio Albums: *1976 Oour Eyir Ahstvats *1977 Ballad Hayrenyatz *1978 Aravoditz Irigoun *1979 Harout *1980 Minchev Ekouts *1980 In Memory Of Those Who Gave Their Lives *1981 Kedi Ayn Apin *1982 Yerp Alegodz Dzovu Vra *1982 Top‚Äô82 *1983 Heratsadz Engerner *1984 Vol 12 *1986 Hayi Achker *1988 Hay Baliknerin *1989 Knas Parov *1991 Yeregoyan Yerevan *1993 Pari Daretarts *1994 Jambanere Bingyoli feat.

There are also eight IFK clubs in Finland but they are organised separately. The Swedish IFK was founded 1 February 1895 and has 164 member clubs with around 100,000 members as of 2004. The best known IFK club in football is probably the one in Gothenburg, IFK G√∂teborg, which won the UEFA Cup twice in the 1980s. In ice hockey, the most successful IFK club is IFK Helsingfors from Helsinki, which have won the Finnish championship seven times.  History  IFK was founded in Stockholm by two young students (Louis Zettersten and Pehr Ehnemark) that wanted to create a sports association, consisting of a main club in Stockholm with smaller clubs in other parts of the country. This was in a time when no nationwide sports organization or other larger associations existed. An advertisement in the youth paper Kamraten (The Comrade) that was published 1 February 1895 called forth all sports interested boys and girls in Sweden to join the society. Less than two months later, clubs in Lule√•, H√§rn√∂sand, Uppsala, J√∂nk√∂ping, Gothenburg and V√§ster√•s had been founded, aside the main club in Stockholm. It was decided to name the society after the paper that made the creation possible.IFK - historik The society grew fast and the administration was too heavy for IFK Stockholm to handle, so a central organisation was created in 1901.IFK - historik Championships and other activities for IFK clubs were arranged and were big tournaments in a time when there existed no central Swedish sports administration to handle nationwide events. Some of these Comrade championships died out as national championships were arranged, but in some sports they live on, for example in Bowling. Other member associations started their own competitions, the most notable being Vasaloppet arranged by IFK Mora and Liding√∂loppet arranged by IFK Liding√∂. Aside from the IFK members in Sweden and the separately organised IFK members in Finland, there did also exist IFK associations in Denmark and Norway. The last active member in Denmark was IFK Aalborg that ceased to exist in the early 1990s, while the Norwegian member in Kristiania (Oslo) ended its activities early in the 20th century.  Symbols and colours  IFK's colours are blue and white. They are used by almost all member clubs, and those clubs that do not use them have special permits from the central organisation for using other colours, like IFK Malm√∂ that uses yellow and white or IFK Stockholm's blue and red kits. The colours are believed to symbolise innocence and loyalty as written, by the IFK society master, in Kamraten in 1899. Symbols used by IFK include the four-pointed star in blue or white, the blue shield with white stripe and the characteristically formed top with two rounded parts between three peaks which can be seen in most of the member clubs' badges, although some use other styles.

The lake was created in 1963 by the Smith Mountain Dam impounding the Roanoke River. The majority of the south shore of the lake lies in Franklin County while a small portion, including access to the dam, lies in Pittsylvania County. Bedford County makes up the northern half of the lake with the Roanoke River as the dividing line. The lake has become a popular recreation spot and has also experienced significant development in the last decade. It is the largest lake contained entirely within the Commonwealth of Virginia. History Initial proposals were made in the late 1920s to dam the Roanoke River and the Blackwater River at the Smith Mountain gorge to generate electricity. Construction on the Smith Mountain Dam began in 1960 and was completed in 1963. The lake reached its normal water level in March 1966. The lake covers and has over of shoreline. The north shore of the lake lies entirely in Bedford County. Located along the lake shore at Wirtz, Virginia is the Gwin Dudley Home Site, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. =Development= Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the area around Smith Mountain Lake remained rural and remote with tobacco farms and other agriculture. Marinas provided the bulk of public access in the early years of the lake. The limited early residential developments around the lake consisted largely of small trailer parks and modest houses. However, residential growth has been steady since the mid-1980s and increasingly upscale with large lakefront houses, condominiums, and communities centered on golf courses. The lake has attracted many who commute to Roanoke and Lynchburg and many retirees, many of whom have relocated from the Northeast. By the late 1990s, the number and affluence of the new residents resulted in the construction of new retail and commercial developments near the lake. Recent shoreline development has been limited to residential construction. With the enactment of Federal oversight of shoreline development in 1998 coupled with soaring real estate values, there is an escalating loss of public access to the lake as the lake's marinas are sold for residential development. State Route 122 is the only primary highway that crosses the lake, though State Route 24, State Route 116, and State Route 40 are nearby. =Licensing= American Electric Power (AEP) is licensed to operate the Smith Mountain Project by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The initial license term was for fifty years. In 1998, AEP began the process of relicensing. Under the requirements of relicensing, AEP was required to perform numerous studies to determine management requirements during the upcoming license term. In December, 2009 the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted Appalachian Power a new license to operate the hydro-electricity plant. The new 30-year license replaces the original 50-year license and addresses recreational and environmental management. =Shoreline management= View from shore of Smith Mountain Lake In 1998, the FERC required AEP to devise and implement a shoreline management plan. The Shoreline Management Plan (SMP) limits the development of all property within the \\"project boundary.\\" Local zoning regulations have been effectively superseded by the SMP regulations. AEP acts as the permitting agency. Any variance requests are reviewed by interested State and Federal agencies such as Virginia Dept of Game and Inland Fisheries. Disagreements must first proceed to the FERC, then be appealed through the Federal Judicial System. Geography The area lies in a broad valley nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of rural south-central Virginia. Before the lake's creation, farming and logging were the primary industries. Communities around the lake include Moneta, Huddleston, Union Hall, White House, Penhook and Goodview. There is a post office located at 1080 Tolers Ferry Rd, Huddleston, VA 24104. The Booker T. Washington National Monument is near the west end of the lake. The level of the lake normally varies by during the day and night, as water flows through (and is pumped back through) the dam. The normal maximum level of the lake (also known as \\"full pond\\") is regulated to above sea level. The normal observed level (also known as \\"normal pond\\") is . The level can be significantly lower during periods of extended drought. Lake levels were sometimes about below normal during the years 2001 to 2003, after five years of below-average rainfall. Recreation and public access Smith Mountain Lake has become a popular recreational area. Boating, water skiing, wakeboarding, riding personal watercraft, and sailing are common activities as is fishing, especially for striped bass. The lake has hosted several professional fishing tournaments. Smith Mountain Lake State Park opened in 1983 and provided a beach and a section for swimming. Golf at one of the four nearby courses is a popular landside activity. The majority of access to the lake is through private residential property. About a dozen private marinas provide various public access opportunities, which may be fee-based or free (through some have been recently converted to private, residential developments due to economic and regulatory pressure.) The fee-based state park (located on the Bedford County side, off Smith Mountain Parkway), the free Smith Mountain Community Park (located on the Franklin County side of the lake) and six government-managed boat launching ramps also provide public access. In popular culture The 2012 independent film Lake Effects features Smith Mountain Lake. It's a fictional tale of a family raised on and later returning to the lake. The dramatic comedy first aired on the Hallmark Movie Channel during May 2012. * The lake was featured prominently in the 1991 movie comedy What About Bob?, directed by Frank Oz and starring Bill Murray, Richard Dreyfuss and Julie Hagerty. It served as the stand-in for Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. * Smith Mountain Lake is a setting in \\"Mind Over Matter,\\" an episode of the TV series The Outer Limits, which features actor Mark Hamill.

Am√©rica won Campeonato do Nordeste (Brazilian Northeast Championship) in 1998, defeating Esporte Clube Vit√≥ria by a 3-1 score in the final match. It is the only Football Team in Rio Grande do Norte to obtain titles outside the state as in 1973, became the undefeated winner of Ta√ßa Almir de Albuquerque, which involved teams from North-Northeast of Brazil and is the only club from Rio Grande do Norte to participate in an international championship, the Copa Conmebol in 1998. Am√©rica's greatest rival is ABC, also from Natal. History The team was founded on July 14, 1915. The first official match played in the state of Rio Grande do Norte was Am√©rica 3-0 ABC, on June 22, 1919 valid for the first , organized at that time by the Liga de Desportos Terrestres. The club's first title came in 1919. The club won the , defeating Centro Esportivo Natalense and ABC, becoming the first Campeonato Potiguar champions. On November 7, 1928, through Law 707 the club was the first to be recognized as a State Public Utility instrument. Am√©rica had been licensed team of the (FNF) for 5 years, between 1960 and 1965, thus the team did not participate in official competitions. Instead, the team committed to the construction of its official ground at Rodrigues Alves Avenue, bourough of Tirol, Natal. In 1974 Am√©rica was crowned undefeated state champions, playing 20 matches with 12 wins and 8 ties. In 1975, Am√©rica won the Torneio Norte-Nordeste. Between 1987 and 1992, Am√©rica won 5 state championships, only losing in 1990. In 1996, the team from Rio Grande do Norte was runner-up of the Brazilian Championship Second Division and became eligible to participate in the First Division in the following year. In its return to the main division, Am√©rica ended in 16th place, ahead of other powerful teams, such as Corinthians and Fluminense. In 1998, however, the club failed to remain in the First Division. In 1998, Am√©rica achieved its greatest glory, becoming champions of Campeonato do Nordeste, defeating Vit√≥ria-BAin the final match on July 4, 3-1, with goals from Biro-Biro, Paulinho Kobayashi and Carioca. Am√©rica's team at that time consisted of the following players: Gabriel; Gilson, Paulo Roberto (Andr√©), Lima and Rogerinho; Montanha, Carioca, Biro-Biro and Moura; Paulinho Kobayashi and Leonardo (Vanderlei). In October, 2003 the city counsellor Hermano Morais published in the , the Law n¬∞ 5.493, recognizing Am√©rica Futebol Clube, as an instrument of the City's Public Utility. In 2005, the club was promoted to the Campeonato Brasileiro Second Division, after finishing in second in the third division. Am√©rica had the best forward of the competition, Paulinho Mar√≠lia, who scored 10 goals. On November 25, 2006, Am√©rica once again managed to qualify for the Brazilian Championship First Division, after a 2-2 tie with champions Atl√©tico Mineiro, at Mineir√£o, with a record crowd of 74,694 (largest crowd of the year in Brazil), fighting back after conceding two early goals. At the end of the game, Am√©rica crossed the stadium applauded by Atl√©tico's fans. The club finished in fourth in the Campeonato Brasileiro Second Division. In the following year, Am√©rica was relegated after a disastrous performance in the S√©rie A, obtaining only 17 points out of 114 possible points, and finishing the championship 24 points behind the second-to-last placed team, Paran√°, in which, to date is the worst campaign of a team in the S√©rie A since 2003, when the round-robin format was established. After two seasons struggling against relegation in the S√©rie B, Am√©rica eventually was relegated to the S√©rie C in 2010, but gained promotion to the S√©rie B again in 2011.

Through prayerful petition and thanksgiving the Red Mass requests guidance from the Holy Spirit for all who seek justice, and offers the legal community an opportunity to reflect on what Catholics believe is the God-given power and responsibility of all in the legal profession. Originating in Europe during the High Middle Ages, the Red Mass is so-called from the red vestments traditionally worn in symbolism of the tongues of fire (the Holy Spirit) that descended on the Apostles at Pentecost (). Its name also exemplifies the scarlet robes worn by royal judges that attended the Mass centuries ago.\\"The Red Mass\\", The John Carroll Society In many countries with a Protestant tradition, such as England and Wales and Australia, a similar church service is held to mark the start of the legal year, with judges customarily wearing their ceremonial regalia. History The first recorded Red Mass was celebrated in the Cathedral of Paris in 1245. In certain localities of France, the Red Mass was celebrated in honor of Saint Ives, the Patron Saint of Lawyers. From there, it spread to most European countries. The tradition began in England around 1310, during the reign of Edward II. It was attended at the opening of each term of Court by all members of the Bench and Bar. Today the Red Mass is celebrated annually at Westminster Cathedral. In the United States, the first Red Mass was held in 1877 at Saints Peter and Paul Church Detroit, Michigan, by Detroit College, as the University of Detroit Mercy was known at the time. UDM School of Law resumed the tradition beginning in 1912 and continues to hold it annually. In New York City, a Red Mass was first held in 1928 at the Church of St. Andrew, near the courthouses of Foley Square, celebrated by Cardinal Patrick Joseph Hayes, who strongly advocated and buttressed the legal community's part in evangelization. In Canada, the Red Mass was first celebrated in Qu√©bec City in 1896, in Toronto in 1924 and in Montr√©al in 1944. Its sponsorship was assumed by the Guild of Our Lady of Good Counsel in 1931 and by The Thomas More Lawyers' Guild of Toronto since 1968. It was re-instituted in Sydney, Australia in 1931. Red Mass today The main difference between the Red Mass and a traditional Mass is that the focus of prayer and blessings concentrate on the leadership roles of those present. The gifts of the Holy Spirit: wisdom, understanding, counsel and fortitude, are customarily invoked upon those in attendance. =Ireland= In Ireland, the Votive Mass of the Holy Spirit (the Red Mass) is held annually on the first Monday of October, which is the first day of the Michaelmas Law Term. The ceremony is held at St. Michan's Roman Catholic church, which is the parish church of the Four Courts. It is attended by the Irish judiciary, barristers and solicitors, as well as representatives of the diplomatic corps, Garda√≠, the Northern Irish, English and Scottish judiciary. The judiciary do not wear their judicial robes, although formal morning dress is worn. Journalist Dearbhail McDonald has described it as \\"a grave, necessary reminder of the awesome powers and responsibilities of all those who dispense justice, including judges, lawyers, government and garda√≠.\\" A parallel ceremony is held at St. Michan's Church of Ireland (Anglican Protestant). =Philippines= In the Philippines, De La Salle University, Xavier University ‚Äì Ateneo de Cagayan, and other Jesuit schools, and Holy Angel University annually celebrate the Red Mass, which they call \\"Mass of the Holy Spirit.\\" The University of Santo Tomas, the Colegio de San Juan de Letran (Dominicans), and the San Beda University (Benedictines) also celebrate the Red Mass, known as Misa de Apertura, that is followed by the Discurso de Apertura to formally open the academic year. =Scotland= In Scotland, a Red Mass is held annually each autumn in St. Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh to mark the beginning of the Scottish Judicial year. It is attended by Catholic judges of the High Court of Justiciary, sheriffs, advocates, solicitors and law students all dressed in their robes of office. The robes of the Lords Commissioner of Justiciary are red faced with white. =United States= Diocese of Austin 2009 Red Mass Announcement One of the better- known Red Masses is the one celebrated each fall at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, D.C. on the Sunday before the first Monday in October (the Supreme Court convenes on the first Monday in October). It is sponsored by the John Carroll Society and attended by some Supreme Court justices, members of Congress, the diplomatic corps, the Cabinet and other government departments and sometimes the President of the United States. Each year, at the Brunch following the Red Mass, the Society confers its Pro Bono Legal Service Awards to thank lawyers and law firms that have provided outstanding service. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was Jewish, used to attend the Red Mass with her Christian colleagues earlier in her tenure on the Court, but later stopped attending due to her objection to the use of images of aborted fetuses during a homily opposing abortion. The first Red Mass in the United States was celebrated at Saints Peter and Paul Church (Detroit) in 1877, under the auspices of what is now the University of Detroit Mercy. The tradition was resumed in 1912, and has been held annually since. This Red Mass is the oldest continuously held in the United States. The better-known Red Mass in New York was first celebrated in 1928. The first Red Mass in Boston was celebrated on October 4, 1941 at Immaculate Conception Church under the auspices of Boston College. A Red Mass is also celebrated at St. Joseph's Cathedral in the Diocese of Manchester, New Hampshire, at the University of San Diego, and at the Basilica of the Assumption in the Archdiocese of Baltimore. A Red Mass was first observed in Washington, D.C. in 1939 at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. It continued as an annual event there under the auspices of the law school of the Catholic University of America. It was held in January to coincide with the opening of Congress. In 1953 it was moved to St. Matthew's Cathedral, but continued to be held at the beginning of the year until 1977.

Smoking tobacco was illegal during the Qing Dynasty, but the use of snuff was allowed because the Chinese considered snuff to be a remedy for common illnesses such as colds, headaches and stomach disorders. Therefore, snuff was carried in a small bottle like other medicines. The snuff bottle replaced the snuff box used by Europeans. History Tobacco was introduced by the Portuguese to the court at Beijing some time during the mid- to late-16th century. It was originally smoked in pipes before the establishment of the Qing Dynasty. The use of snuff and snuff bottles spread through the upper class, and by the end of the 17th century it had become a part of social ritual to use snuff. This lasted through most of the 18th century. Eventually, the trend spread into the rest of the country and into every social class. It was common to offer a pinch of snuff as a way to greet friends and relatives. Snuff bottles soon became an object of beauty and a way to represent status and wealth. The use of snuff increased and decreased with the rise and fall of the Qing Dynasty and died away soon after the establishment of the Republic of China. However, contemporary snuff bottles are still being made, and can be purchased in souvenir shops, flea markets and museum gift shops. Original snuff bottles from the Qing period are a desirable target for serious collectors and museums. A good bottle has an extra quality over and above its exquisite beauty and value: that is touch. Snuff bottles were made to be held and so, as a rule, they have a pleasant tactile quality. Materials and sizes Chinese snuff bottles in the British Museum in London. The size of a snuff bottle is small enough to fit inside the palm. Snuff bottles were made out of many different materials including porcelain, jade, rhinoceros horn, ivory, wood, tortoiseshell, metal and ceramic, though probably the most commonly used material was glass. The stopper usually had a very small spoon attached for extracting the snuff. Though rare, such bottles were also used by women in Europe in Victorian times, with the bottles typically made of cut glass.Ursula Bourne, Snuff, Shire Publications, 1990, p. 24. Chinese snuff bottles were typically decorated with paintings or carvings, which distinguished bottles of different quality and value. Decorative bottles were, and remain, time-consuming in their production and are thus desirable for today's collectors. Symbolism in snuff bottle decoration The Shou character is commonly found on snuff bottles. Chinese snuff bottle, Qing dynasty, glass bottle with amber stopper, Honolulu Museum of Art Many bottles are completely devoid of decoration, others are incredibly ornate. As in all Chinese arts and crafts, motifs and symbols play an important part in decorative detail. Symbols are derived from a multitude of sources such as legends, history, religion, philosophy and superstition. The ideas used are almost always directed toward bringing wealth, health, good luck, longevity, even immortality to the owner of an artifact, frequently as a wish expressed in a kind of coded form by the giver of a gift. Probably the most popular decoration is the Shou character, a symbol of happiness and longevity, illustrated at right. Shou or Sau was one of Three Star Gods. Another popular device is a representation of the 18 Lohan, who were the personal disciples of Buddha, just one group of the many revered immortals in China. Apart from the 18 Lohan there is a constellation of other divines who are portrayed, even their innards. The eight precious organs of the Buddha are venerated ‚Äì his heart, gall bladder, spleen, lungs, liver, stomach, kidneys and intestines. These are rarely depicted on snuff bottles. Animals, on the other hand appear with regularity, the most common being the dragon. Dragon clutching a fiery pearl A dragon is shown in the example at right on a porcelain bottle in splendid red and blue and clutching the inevitable fiery pearl. One of the traditions of Chinese art is that only the Emperor, his sons and princes of the first and second ranks were permitted to own an artefact illustrated with a dragon having five claws. Four-clawed dragons were restricted to princes of the third and fourth ranks, while the common folk had to be content with a dragon having three claws. However, it is common to find that many older bottles have dragons with five claws. Naive horse The horse is another animal frequently used in the decorative work. The horse is one of the Seven Treasures of Buddhism. Its symbolism points to speed, perseverance, rank, power and wealth. The symbolism of wealth and power came about because the horse carried those of importance. In the example at left, the horse seems to be carved in a very amateurish way, but in this school of bottle production, na√Øvet√© was the style. The hare represents a wish for long life and even immortality. In Chinese tradition it is believed that if one attains a sufficiently high standard of morality and enlightenment, one will become one of the immortals. =Other commonly used symbols= The three legged toad is a mythical creature. It was thought to be an animated purse containing an inexhaustible supply of coins, hence it represents wealth and has become a symbol of the unattainable. The fish is both an emblem of wealth and abundance and of harmony and connubial bliss. The fish emblem is used in a variety of decorative ways. Bamboo is a frequent motif. Because of its durability and its being evergreen it has come, along with many other symbols, to signify longevity. \\"Inside painted\\" bottles Ye Zhongsan Inside Painted Snuff Bottle of Various Fish, dated 1913 Modern Inside Painted Bottle Inside painted are glass bottles which have pictures and often calligraphy painted on the inside surface of the glass. Their scenes are an inch or two high and are painted while manipulating the brush through the neck of the bottle at times only a quarter inch across, in reverse. Ursula Bourne, in her treatise on snuff, suggested that artisans painted on their backs to make it easier to work through the narrow opening. A skilled artist may complete a simple bottle in a week while something special may take a month or more and the best craftsmen will produce only a few bottles in a year. Gan Xuanwen, also known as Gan Xuan has long been recognized as an important early artist of inside- painted snuff bottles in China. Quite a number of his bottles carry cyclical dates together with a reign period, and hence his works can be dated for certainty to roughly the first quarter of the 19th century, during the late Jiaqing (1796-1820) and early Daoguang (1821-1850) reigns of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). It was not until the early 19th century and late in the Jiaqing reign that snuff bottles decorated with inside painting came to the fore. The inspiration of inside-painted snuff bottles might have originated from the court, but did not receive any support of the imperial workshops. Nevertheless, this kind of snuff bottles quickly became the subject of acquisition for a new group of patrons, comprising officials, nobles, scholars and businessmen. Eventually the craft gained immense momentum in the late Qing and the early Republic periods, i.e. from the late 19th to the early 20th centuries. In Beijing, there were three renowned and influential masters, namely Zhou Leyuan, Ma Shaoxuan and Ye Zhongsan. Inside painted bottles are still made extensively for collectors and inexpensively as souvenirs. Inside painted bottles themes include landscapes, bird-and-flowers, figures and auspicious themes. They are viewed as miniature paintings within the bottle. Snuff bullet Snuff bullets and other accessories. In recent years a popular method of snuff insufflation has been the snuff bullet. A simple snuff bullet consists of a small bottle with a plug in the base, a rotatable \\"dosing chamber\\" and a hole on the top. More advanced snuff bullets have variable dosing settings. They can be made of plastic, glass or metal. Notes Further readingThe Collector's Book of Snuff Bottles by Bob C. Stevens *Chinese Snuff Bottles: The Adventures and Studies of a Collector by Lilla S.

He is best known as the commander of the naval forces of the 1779 Penobscot Expedition, which ended in complete disaster, with all ships lost. Norton (2003) argues the Penobscot Expedition was a total failure due to poor planning, inadequate training, and timid leadership on the part of Saltonstall. Early life Dudley Saltonstall was born in 1738 to Gurdon Saltonstall Jr and Mary Winthrop. Both sides of his family were prominent in British colonial politics; his great-grandfather on his father's side was Sir Richard Saltonstall, and his mother was descended from John Winthrop, who served as governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the 17th century. His father was a prominent figure in New London and Connecticut politics, serving as a probate judge and a leader of the community. In 1765 he married Frances Babcock, the daughter of Joshua Babcock, a doctor and lawyer who served on the supreme court of the Rhode Island Colony. Saltonstall took positions on the ships of the colonial mercantile fleet, and served as a merchant captain during the Seven Years' War. In April 1762 he was given command of a letter of marque brigantine, the Britannia, with which he made several successful voyages to the West Indies. During these years he established a reputation as a competent ship's captain. Continental Navy When the American Revolutionary War broke out, Saltonstall joined Connecticut's militia, helping to defend New London's harbor. When the Continental Navy was established, he was given one of the first captain's commissions, based on the recommendation of his brother-in-law Silas Deane, who served on Connecticut's Naval Committee. He was given command of , the flagship of the new navy's commodore, Esek Hopkins. He hired John Paul Jones as his first lieutenant, and gave him the responsibility of overseeing the fitting out of the newly acquired ship. He and Jones did not get along well, as Jones did not like Saltonstall's sometimes distant and superior demeanor. Saltonstall captained Alfred on the Continental Navy's maiden voyage in March 1776, an expedition to Nassau in the Bahamas whose objective was arms and critically needed gunpowder. The expedition was somewhat successful, as Nassau was taken, but its governor had managed to remove much of the gunpowder before the takeover was completed. The return voyage was uneventful, although smallpox was spreading through the ships' crews, until the fleet neared Block Island. On April 4 and 5, the fleet captured British ships. On the morning of April 6, was spotted, and was brought to action. In the ensuing battle, Alfred steering controls were damaged by cannon fire, and she drifted out of the action. Glasgow was able to escape to Newport outrunning the heavily laden fleet. While the expedition was successful, Hopkins and Saltonstall were questioned over the fleet's failure to follow its stated orders, which had been to engage the British fleet off the Carolinas, and over its failure to capture the clearly outnumbered Glasgow. Saltonstall was not censured, but other captains in the fleet were punished for cowardly behavior. In September 1776 Saltonstall was given command of , which had been built at a dockyard on the Connecticut River. To Saltonstall's dismay, she was too heavily laden to cross the sand bar at the mouth of the river. After numerous repeated attempts to pass the bar in 1776 and 1777, the Marine Committee gave her command to Elisha Hinman, who successfully floated her into Long Island Sound in August 1779. Saltonstall's next command was , based in Boston. He replaced Hopkins at her helm in July 1779; Hopkins was suspended for breach of orders, and was eventually dismissed from the navy. Penobscot expedition In the summer of 1779, the British established a base in Penobscot Bay near present-day Castine, Maine, intended to be the beginning of a new province, New Ireland, and a stronghold for attacking American privateers operating against British shipping. The state of Massachusetts (which at that time included the District of Maine), organized an expedition to dislodge the British from this position. Saltonstall, the senior Continental Navy commander, was given command of the naval forces, which consisted primarily of ships from the Massachusetts State Navy, a large number of privateers, and a few Continental Navy ships, including Warren. Command of the land forces accompanying the expedition was given to a relatively inexperienced Massachusetts militia brigadier general, Solomon Lovell. The unwieldy fleet had virtually no captains with experience in any sort of fleet operations, and many of them were used to the independence afforded by their privateering operations. While Saltonstall had participated in the Nassau expedition, he had only exercised command over his ship. Furthermore, the expedition was to be his maiden voyage aboard his new command. The expedition sailed for Penobscot Bay on July 19. When it arrived near the British base, commanders of the various forces met to consider their attack in a council that was later described by Paul Revere, the militia's artillery leader, as \\"more like a meeting in a Coffee House than a council of War\\". Nothing of consequence was agreed, and the resultant lack of coordination between the various forces proved disastrous. Saltonstall and Lovell disagreed on tactics, and Saltonstall refused to take steps to engage the three British ships that were anchored near the fort in somewhat treacherous waters. He finally engaged Henry Mowat's small fleet at long range on June 29; his inexperienced gunnery crews did little damage, while Mowat's did significant damage to Warren and other ships. This made Saltonstall reluctant to order further engagements, including in support of land and amphibious operations. The arrival of a British relief fleet under Admiral George Collier at the mouth of the bay led to further strains. Saltonstall at first set up a line of defense against the arriving fleet, but when they began to close, he essentially ordered each ship to act independently, and the fleet organization dissolved. Most of the ships were eventually grounded and burned; some were captured after brief exchanges by the British. The land forces were essentially abandoned, and many men had to make lengthy overland treks back to civilization. Saltonstall's reported inaction and timidity were blamed for the failure of the expedition. This may have been an unfair judgement, as few people understood the technological and nautical limitations Saltonstall faced. Other ship captains in the expedition overwhelmingly agreed that a naval assault was too risky without a simultaneous land attack on the British fort, which Lovell refused to provide. On September 7, 1779, a Warrant for Court Martial was issued by the Navy Board, Eastern Department, against Saltonstall. He was found guilty at the trial of ineptitude at Penobscot and was dismissed from the Navy as being \\"ever after incompetent to hold a government office or state post\\" the following October by the \\"Committee for Enquiring into the Failure of the Penobscot Expedition\\" of the Massachusetts General Court which determined that failure of the expedition was primarily the result of the \\"want of proper Spirit and Energy on the part of the Commodore\\", that he \\"discouraged any Enterprizes or offensive [attack] Measures on the part of our Fleet\\", and that the total destruction of the fleet was occasioned \\"principally by the Commodore's not exerting himself at all at the time of the Retreat in opposing the Enemies' foremost Ships in pursuit.\\"Adoption of the \\"Report of the Committee for Enquiring into the Failure of the Penobscot Expedition\\", Chapter 459 of \\"The Acts and Resolves Public and Private of the Province of the Massachusetts Bay 1779-1780\\" October 7, 1779 The story of the Penobscot Expedition forms the basis of the historical novel, The Fort by Bernard Cornwell. Later career Saltonstall returned to Connecticut, and convinced one of his wife's relatives, Adam Babcock, to support him in a privateering venture. As captain of the 16-gun brig Minerva, he embarked on a successful career as a privateer in 1781. Among his prizes was the richest captured by a Connecticut ship; the merchantman Hannah was valued at ¬£80,000. After the war, he engaged in trade with the West Indies, and also dabbled in the slave trade. He died in 1796 in the West Indies, apparently of a tropical disease.

Written by Christopher Knopf and directed by Herbert Wise, the film stars Albert Finney, Caroline Bliss, Brian Cox, and John Forgeham. The film marks both Albert Finney's American television debut and the first script Finney had ever turned down upon initial reading. Synopsis This film's timeline begins with the death of Pope John Paul I on September 28, 1978, and then flashes back to Karol Wojty≈Ça as a young man growing up decades earlier in Wadowice, Poland. The storyline then returns to pre-October 16 dates in 1978 and flashes back to Wojty≈Ça's early life, family relationships, his political involvements fighting against Nazism during World War II and against Communism after the war, and his relationship and involvement in the Roman Catholic Church as he becomes a priest, a bishop, a cardinal, and is eventually installed as the titular new pope. Cast Albert Finney as Karol Wojty≈Ça, Pope John Paul II * Caroline Bliss as Rosa Kossack * Brian Cox as Father G√≥ra * John Forgeham as Officer Moljek * Derek Francis as Bishop Lec * Nigel Hawthorne as Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski * Marne Maitland as Mountain Sacristan * John McEnery as Monsignor Kuczkowski * Lee Montague as Marshal Konev * Michael M√ºller as Pawel * Jonathan Newth as Archbishop Adam Sapieha * Derrick O'Connor as Swiacki * Valentine Pelka as Boguslaw Banas * Ronald Pickup as Jan Tyranowski * Bruce Purchase as Jerzy Loparicz * Andrew Ray as Prof. Pigon * Vincent Riotta as Teodor Krawick * William Simons as Foreman Krauze * Patrick Stewart as Party Secretary Wladyslaw Gomulka * Philip Stone as Archbishop Eugeniusz Baziak * Kevin Stoney as Bishop Dygat * Malcolm Tierney as Church Affairs Minister Skarzynski * Fiona Walker as Anna Loparicz * Tim Woodward as Juliusz Kydrynski * Sam Dastor as J√≥zef Teitelbaum * Robert Austin as Hans Frank * Michael Crompton as Young Karol Wojty≈Ça * Antony Brown as Father Zary * Alfred Burke as Karol Wojty≈Ça Sr. * Victoria Fairbrother as Ruth Teitelbaum * Kilian McKenna as Stefan Putrya * Patrick Marley as Raczynski * Neil Nisbet as Wiktor * Natalie Slater as Hanna Jastrun * Eve Slatner as Sister Jadwiga * John Stacy as Grabowski * Mario Viggiano as Franciszek * Edwin Alexander Francis as Forest Guard Production Once Karol Wojty≈Ça was installed as Pope, executive producer Alvin Cooperman made his decision to create the film project, and with the assistance of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, sought Vatican approval and cooperation. After reviewing the script, the Vatican welcomed the project. British actor Michael Compton portrayed Karol Wojty≈Ça from ages 18 through 26, and Albert Finney portrayed Wojty≈Ça from 27 years old, up to the time the former bishop was installed as Pope John Paul II. Finney had initially declined the role upon first reading the script, as he felt playing the role of someone so high-profile would be unnerving, but after re-reading the script, he accepted. Deciding that then-political problems in Poland would make shooting there problematical, producer Alvin Cooperman received permission to shoot in Yugoslavia, using Zagreb to represent Krak√≥w. Three days before major filming was to commence, the Yugoslavian government rescinded permission and confiscated location footage that had already been shot. The production company was told they were not welcome due to the script's anti-Communist overtones as set by Wojty≈Ça's disagreements with the Communist regime while he was a priest, cardinal and bishop. The project was subsequently filmed at locations in Austria, as well as in Italy in Caprarola and Rome. The film debuted on CBS Television on Easter Sunday, April 22, 1984. Reception The Day wrote that in their considering the difficulties in offering a project about an incumbent Pope, the filmmakers treated the subject \\"with verve - and honesty\\". In not being a true documentary film, the depiction of the life of Karol Wojty≈Ça was not \\"tied to exact factual details\\", and included the addition \\"theatrical flourishes and appropriate emotional atmosphere\\", but still remained \\"a sound and vivid dramatization\\" reflecting the biographical record of a man whose \\"background had plenty of high drama in it without making it up\\". They did note that \\"some of the transitions were a bit ragged, and some of the ecclesiastical artificially stiff,\\" but that \\"generally, the story has authenticity\\". The Courier in noting that lead Albert Finney was Protestant, both director Herbert Wise and writer Christopher Knopf were Jewish, and cinematographer Tony Imi was Roman Catholic, wrote that the film was successful as \\"a compelling story about a man, rather that a religious tract about a pontiff.\\" Producer Alvin Cooperman spoke toward the difficulties extant in writing about a living exalted person, and how he worked to dispel preconceptions that he was offering either a documentary or a \\"hallowed portrait\\" of (then-incumbent) John Paul II. The New York Times made note of difficulties inherent in creating a film about a historical person while the person is living. The offered that while a person might be mythicized after their death, and might even be so when living, it is when they are living when they are living that a production company has boundaries, as \\"current images, common knowledge, popular consensus shape them.\\" They wrote that this project was \\"at once enhanced and hindered by this.\\" They granted that while Pope John Paul II's life story \\"is sure-fire for a biography\\", and viewers would likely have their own views and impressions of him, but that with his being a living subject, when it comes to historical accuracy, \\"A filmmaker can tamper with this only lightly, not only because heavy tampering would be distasteful, even irreverent, but because it would be jarring, an assault on our sensibilities.\\" In the production company respecting this, the film becomes \\"almost a series of anecdotes.\\" Boston Globe made note that director Herbert Wise's choice of flashback to tell the story made the timeline easy to follow and allowed him to \\"introduce scenes from Wojty≈Ça's early life in black and white.\\" They applauded makeup artists for their making actor Albert Finney look \\"eerily like the Pope\\", and the actor himself for mastering \\"the Pope's stoop and his hand gestures\\". They found that in the director portraying \\"Wojty≈Ça as a man without a flaw\\", the story itself was \\"without a moral dilemma and, therefore, without dramatic edge\\". =Accolades= AllRovi wrote that the screenplay by Christopher Knopf was \\"written with reverence and intelligence\\". The film received a 1985 WGA Awards nomination for writer Christopher Knopf for 'Original Drama Anthology'.

Moore leads his raiding party past the Ocmulgee trading-post, in this museum display at Ocmulgee National Monument James Moore (c. 1650 ‚Äì 1706) was the English governor of colonial Carolina between 1700 and 1703. He is best known for leading several invasions of Spanish Florida during Queen Anne's War, including attacks in 1704 and 1706 which wiped out most of the Spanish missions in Florida. He captured and brought back to Carolina as slaves thousands of Apalachee Indians. Early life Little is known of Moore's origins. During his life he was said to be a son of Roger Moore (also known as Rory O'Moore or Ruair√≠ √ìg √ì M√≥rdha), leader of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and that he had supposedly inherited his father's rebellious nature. He first appears in the records of the Province of Carolina in 1675 representing Margaret Berringer Yeamans, widow of Sir John Yeamans, before the colonial council. At about the same time he married her daughter by her first husband, also named Margaret. Political career In 1677, 1682, and 1683, Moore served on the colonial council. He played a leading role in a 1690 expedition into the Carolina back country, crossing the Appalachian Mountains to investigate possibilities of trade with the local Indian population. In 1698 he was elected to the colonial assembly, and was described as the right-hand- man of proprietor Sir John Colleton. The next year he was named chief justice of the colony, a post he held until he was named governor in 1700, replacing the deceased Joseph Blake. Moore was a leader of one of colonial South Carolina's political factions, called the \\"Goose Creek Men\\", after Goose Creek, an outlying area of Charleston. In 1683 Moore was granted by the Lords Proprietors. He called his estate \\"Boochowee\\". Part of this land is known today as Liberty Hall Plantation. From 1691 Moore was the acknowledged leader of the Goose Creek Men, the main political opposition to the ruling \\"Dissenter\\" faction. Moore's rise to governorship in 1700 signalled a major shift in the politics of the colony. The Dissenters contested Moore's \\"unjust election\\". But the Lords Proprietors saw to it that Moore remained governor, and they made it clear that the Dissenters were no longer in favor. Between 1700 and 1703 Moore was the British governor of Carolina, which was then in the process of dividing into the provinces of North and South Carolina. During this period, he led a number of attacks from the Carolinas into Spanish Florida. He relied on allied Indian tribes, especially the Yamasee for most of his military force. On news of the outbreak of Queen Anne's War in 1702, he led 500 colonists, 300 native allies, and 14 small ships on an invasion of Spanish Florida along the coast, destroying the remaining Spanish missionary Indians of Guale and Mocama, and devastating the lands around St. Augustine. While the town of St. Augustine was razed, its central fortress, Castillo de San Marcos, where the Spanish and numerous allied Indians had taken refuge, resisted Moore's siege. The 1702 campaign was viewed as a disaster due to the failure to take the fortress and the expenses incurred, and Moore resigned his post. In 1704, Moore led an expedition of 50 Englishmen and 1,000 Creek, Yamasee, and other allied Indians, into western Florida, leading to the Apalachee Massacre. The Apalachee were the last powerful Spanish-allied Indian nation in the region. Their defeat in 1704 resulted in many Apalachee being enslaved and taken from Charleston to the West Indies. Other Apalachee were relocated (some voluntarily, others not) to the Savannah River to live in semi-serfdom. Another result of the defeat of the Apalachee was the collapse of the final defence of the Indians of Florida. In the following years, Carolinian and Indian slave raiders virtually wiped out the Indian population of Florida all the way to the Florida Keys. Moore's defeat of the Apalachee in Spanish Florida was hailed as a major victory for Carolina, which had been fighting with the Spanish for control of the region for decades. It also served to strengthen ties between various southeastern Indians and Carolina. The Creek people and the Cherokees became much more closely allied with Carolina. With these two Indian nations as strong allies, the English rose to a position of dominance over the French and Spanish in the American southeast. Moore died in 1706 of a tropical disease, possibly yellow fever. He was significantly in debt. His son by the same name was elected to the same office in 1719 following the overthrow of the proprietary governor. Family Moore married Margaret Berringer, daughter of Lady Margaret Yeamans (by a previous marriage). Their daughter, Mary Moore, married Job Howe, another of the \\"Goose Creek Men\\". Altogether James and Margaret had ten children, many of whom moved to the Lower Cape Fear region, where they and their descendants became known as \\"The Family\\", the most powerful family in the region. Moore was the grandfather of American Revolutionary War Brigadier General James Moore, and great-grandfather of Major General Robert Howe. The Moore family imported over 4,000 slaves into the Carolinas, mostly for its own extensive plantations and farms in and around the Cape Fear area of what later became North Carolina. James Moore also had a house in Charleston and another in the Goose Creek area near Charleston. Another Moore family descendant, Alfred Moore, became a Justice of the US Supreme Court. =Family tree= Nathaniel Moore (son of Rory Oge O'More) References Further readingThe South Carolina Encyclopedia. * People of Queen Anne's War 1650 births 1706 deaths 17th-century Irish people 18th-century Irish people Colonial governors of South Carolina People of the War of the Spanish Succession South Carolina colonial people Kingdom of Ireland emigrants to the Thirteen Colonies O'Moore family ","title":"James Moore (governor)"},{"id":"1837055","title":"Bosson"},{"id":"1837058","text":"A relaxation technique (also known as relaxation training) is any method, process, procedure, or activity that helps a person to relax; to attain a state of increased calmness; or otherwise reduce levels of pain, anxiety, stress or anger. Relaxation techniques are often employed as one element of a wider stress management program and can decrease muscle tension, lower the blood pressure and slow heart and breath rates, among other health benefits. People respond to stress in different ways, namely, by becoming overwhelmed, depressed or both. Yoga, QiGong, Taiji, and Pranayama that includes deep breathing tend to calm people who are overwhelmed by stress, while rhythmic exercise improves the mental and physical health of those who are depressed. People who encounter both symptoms simultaneously, feeling depressed in some ways and overexcited in others, may do best by walking or performing yoga techniques that are focused on strength. Background Research has indicated that removing stress helps to increase a person's health. Research released in the 1980s indicated stronger ties between stress and health and showed benefits from a wider range of relaxation techniques than had been previously known. This research received national media attention, including a New York Times article in 1986. Uses People use relaxation techniques for the following reasons, among others: * Anger management * Anxiety attacks * Cardiac health * Childbirth * Depression * General well-being * Headache * High blood pressure * Preparation for hypnosis * Immune system support * Insomnia * Pain management * Relaxation (psychology) * Stress management * Addiction treatment *Nightmare disorder Techniques Various techniques are used by individuals to improve their state of relaxation. Some of the methods are performed alone; some require the help of another person (often a trained professional); some involve movement, some focus on stillness; while other methods involve different elements. Certain relaxation techniques known as \\"formal and passive relaxation exercises\\" are generally performed while sitting or lying quietly, with minimal movement and involve \\"a degree of withdrawal\\". These include: *Autogenic training *Biofeedback *Deep breathing *Guided imagery *Hypnosis *Meditation *Pranayama *Progressive muscle relaxation *Qigong *Transcendental Meditation technique *Yoga Nidra *Zen Yoga Movement-based relaxation methods incorporate exercise such as walking, gardening, yoga, T'ai chi, Qigong, and more. Some forms of bodywork are helpful in promoting a state of increased relaxation. Examples include massage, acupuncture, the Feldenkrais Method, myotherapy, reflexology and self-regulation. Some relaxation methods can also be used during other activities, for example, autosuggestion and prayer. At least one study has suggested that listening to certain types of music, particularly new-age music and classical music, can increase feelings associated with relaxation, such as peacefulness and a sense of ease. A technique growing in popularity is flotation therapy, which is the use of a float tank in which a solution of Epsom salt is kept at skin temperature to provide effortless floating. Research in USA and Sweden has demonstrated a powerful and profound relaxation after twenty minutes. In some cases, floating may reduce pain and stress and has been shown to release endorphins. Even actions as simple as a walk in the park have been shown to aid feelings of relaxation, regardless of the initial reason for the visit.

The formula is named after G. Dobi≈Ñski, who published it in 1877. Probabilistic content In the setting of probability theory, Dobi≈Ñski's formula represents the nth moment of the Poisson distribution with mean 1. Sometimes Dobi≈Ñski's formula is stated as saying that the number of partitions of a set of size n equals the nth moment of that distribution. Reduced formula The computation of the sum of Dobi≈Ñski's series can be reduced to a finite sum of n+o(n) terms, taking into account the information that B_n is an integer. Precisely one has, for any integer K > 1 ::B_n = \\\\left\\\\lceil {1 \\\\over e}\\\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\\\\frac{k^n}{k!}\\\\right\\\\rceil provided \\\\frac{K^n}{K!}\\\\le 1 (a condition that implies K > n, but that is satisfied by some K of size n+o(n)). Indeed, one has \\\\frac{(K+j)^n}{(K+j)!}\\\\le \\\\frac{K^n}{K!} {1\\\\over j!}\\\\le {1\\\\over j!} for all j ‚â• 0 so that the tail \\\\sum_{k\\\\ge K} \\\\frac{k^n}{k!}=\\\\sum_{j\\\\ge 0} \\\\frac{(K+j)^n}{(K+j)!} is dominated by the series \\\\sum_{j\\\\ge 0} \\\\frac{1}{j!}=e, which implies 0 < B_n - {1 \\\\over e}\\\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\\\\frac{k^n}{k!}<1, whence the reduced formula. Generalization Dobi≈Ñski's formula can be seen as a particular case, for x=0, of the more general relation: :{1 \\\\over e}\\\\sum_{k=x}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{k^n}{(k-x)!} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\binom{n}{k} B_{k} x^{n-k}. Proof One proof relies on a formula for the generating function for Bell numbers, : e^{e^x - 1} = \\\\sum_{n = 0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{B_n}{n!} x^n. The power series for the exponential gives : e^{e^x} = \\\\sum_{k = 0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{e^{kx}}{k!} = \\\\sum_{k = 0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{k!} \\\\sum_{n = 0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(kx)^n}{n!} so :e^{e^x - 1} = \\\\frac{1}{e} \\\\sum_{k = 0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{k!} \\\\sum_{n = 0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(kx)^n}{n!} The coefficient of x^n in this power series must be B_n/n!, so :B_n = \\\\frac{1}{e} \\\\sum_{k = 0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{k^n}{k!}. Another style of proof was given by Rota.. Recall that if x and n are nonnegative integers then the number of one-to-one functions that map a size-n set into a size-x set is the falling factorial :(x)_n = x(x-1)(x-2)\\\\cdots(x-n+1) Let ∆í be any function from a size-n set A into a size-x set B. For any b ‚àà B, let ∆í ‚àí1(b) = {a ‚àà A : ∆í(a) = b}. Then } is a partition of A. Rota calls this partition the \\"kernel\\" of the function ∆í. Any function from A into B factors into * one function that maps a member of A to the element of the kernel to which it belongs, and * another function, which is necessarily one-to-one, that maps the kernel into B. The first of these two factors is completely determined by the partition that is the kernel. The number of one-to-one functions from into B is (x), where  is the number of parts in the partition . Thus the total number of functions from a size-n set A into a size-x set B is :\\\\sum_\\\\pi (x)_{\\\\pi}, the index running through the set of all partitions of A. On the other hand, the number of functions from A into B is clearly xn. Therefore, we have :x^n = \\\\sum_\\\\pi (x)_{\\\\pi}. Rota continues the proof using linear algebra, but it is enlightening to introduce a Poisson- distributed random variable X with mean 1. The equation above implies that the nth moment of this random variable is :E(X^n) = \\\\sum_\\\\pi E((X)_{\\\\pi}) where E stands for expected value. But we shall show that all the quantities E((X)k) equal 1. It follows that :E(X^n) = \\\\sum_\\\\pi 1, and this is just the number of partitions of the set A. The quantity E((X)k) is called the kth factorial moment of the random variable X. To show that this equals 1 for all k when X is a Poisson-distributed random variable with mean 1, recall that this random variable assumes each value integer value j \\\\ge 0 with probability 1/(ej!). Thus : E((X)_k) = \\\\sum_{j = 0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(j)_k}{ej!} = \\\\frac{1}{e} \\\\sum_{j = 0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{j(j-1) \\\\cdots (j-k+1)}{j(j-1) \\\\cdots 1} = \\\\frac{1}{e} \\\\sum_{j = i}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{(j-i)!} = 1.

The name \\"Islamic\\" Cairo refers not to a greater prominence of Muslims in the area but rather to the city's rich history and heritage since its foundation in the early period of Islam, while distinguishing it from with the nearby Ancient Egyptian sites of Giza and Memphis. This area holds one of the largest and densest concentrations of historic architecture in the Islamic world. It is characterized by hundreds of mosques, tombs, madrasas, mansions, caravanserais, and fortifications dating from throughout the Islamic era of Egypt. In 1979, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) proclaimed Historic Cairo a World Cultural Heritage site, as \\"one of the world's oldest Islamic cities, with its famous mosques, madrasas, hammams and fountains\\" and \\"the new centre of the Islamic world, reaching its golden age in the 14th century.\\"UNESCO, Decision Text, World Heritage Centre, retrieved 21 July 2017 History = The foundation of Fustat and the early Islamic era = left The history of Cairo begins, in essence, with the conquest of Egypt by Muslim Arabs in 640, under the commander 'Amr ibn al-'As. Although Alexandria was the capital of Egypt at that time (and had been throughout the Ptolemaic, Roman, and Byzantine periods), the Arab conquerors decided to establish a new city called Fustat to serve as the administrative capital and military garrison center of Egypt. The new city was located near a Roman-Byzantine fortress known as Babylon on the shores of the Nile (now located in Old Cairo), southwest of the later site of Cairo proper (see below). The choice of this location may have been due to several factors, including its slightly closer proximity to Arabia and Mecca, the fear of strong remaining Christian and Hellenistic influence in Alexandria, and Alexandria's vulnerability to Byzantine counteroffensives arriving by sea (which did indeed occur).Raymond, Andr√©. 1993. Le Caire. Fayard. Perhaps even more importantly, the location of Fustat at the intersection of Lower Egypt (the Nile Delta) and Upper Egypt (the Nile Valley further south) made it a strategic place from which to control a country that was centered on the Nile river, much as the Ancient Egyptian city of Memphis (located just south of Cairo today) had done. (The pattern of founding new garrison cities inland was also one that was repeated throughout the Arab conquests, with other examples such as Qayrawan in Tunisia or Kufa in Iraq.) The foundation of Fustat was also accompanied by the foundation of Egypt's (and Africa's) first mosque, the Mosque of 'Amr ibn al-'As, which has been much rebuilt over the centuries but still exists today. Fustat quickly grew to become Egypt's main city, port, and economic center, with Alexandria becoming more of a provincial city. In 661 the Islamic world came under the control of the Ummayyads, based in their capital at Damascus, until their overthrow by the Abbasids in 750. The last Ummayyad caliph, Marwan II, made his last stand in Egypt but was killed on August 1st, 750. Thereafter Egypt, and Fustat, passed under Abbasid control. The Abbasids marked their new rule in Egypt by founding a new administrative capital called al-'Askar, slightly northeast of Fustat, under the initiative of their governor Abu 'Aun. The city was completed with the foundation of a grand mosque (called Jami' al-'Askar) in 786, and included a palace for the governor's residence, known as the Dar al-'Imara. Nothing of this city remains today, but the foundation of new administrative capitals just outside the main city became a recurring pattern in the history of the area. The leftAhmad Ibn Tulun was a Turkish military commander who had served the Abbasid caliphs in Samarra during a long crisis of Abbasid power. He became governor of Egypt in 868 but quickly became its de facto independent ruler, while still acknowledging the Abbasid caliph's symbolic authority. He grew so influential that the caliph later allowed him to also take control of Syria in 878. During this period of Tulunid rule (under Ibn Tulun and his sons), Egypt became an independent state for the first time since Roman rule was established in 30 BC. Ibn Tulun founded his own new administrative capital in 870, called al-Qata'i, just northwest of al- Askar. It included a new grand palace (still called Dar al-'Imara), a hippodrome or military parade ground, amenities such as a hospital (bimaristan), and a great mosque which survives to this day, known as the Mosque of Ibn Tulun, built between 876 and 879. Ibn Tulun died in 884 and his sons ruled for a few more decades until 905 when the Abbasids sent an army to reestablish direct control and burned al-Qata'i to the ground, sparing only the mosque. After this, Egypt was ruled for a while by another dynasty, the Ikhshidids, who ruled as Abbasid governors between 935 and 969. Some of their constructions, particularly under Abu al-Misk Kafur, a black eunuch (originally from Ethiopia) who ruled as regent during the later part of this period, may have influenced the future Fatimids' choice of location for their capital, since one of Kafur's great gardens along the Khalij canal was incorporated into the later Fatimid palaces. = The founding of al-Qahira (Cairo) and the Fatimid period = Al-Azhar Mosque, founded by the Fatimids in 972. (The minarets were added later during the Mamluk period.) Bab al-Futuh, one of the northern gates of Cairo built by the Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali in the late 11th century. The Fatimids, an Isma'ili Shi'a caliphate which was based in Ifriqiya (Tunisia), conquered Egypt in 969 CE during the reign of Caliph al-Mu'izz. Their army, composed mostly of North African Kutama Berbers, was led by the general Jawhar al-Siqilli. In 970, under instructions from al- Mu'izz, Jawhar planned, founded, and constructed a new city to serve as the residence and center of power for the Fatimid Caliphs. The city was named al- Mu'izziyya al-Qaahirah, the \\"Victorious City of al-Mu'izz\\", later simply called \\"al-Qahira\\", which gave us the modern name of Cairo. The city was located northeast of Fustat and of the previous administrative capitals built by Ibn Tulun and the Abbasids. Jawhar organized the new city so that at its center were the Great Palaces that housed the caliphs, their household, and the state's institutions. Two main palaces were completed: an eastern one (the largest of the two) and a western one, between which was an important plaza known as Bayn al-Qasrayn (\\"Between the Two Palaces\\"). The city's main mosque, the Mosque of al-Azhar, was founded in 972 as both a Friday mosque and as a center of learning and teaching, and is today considered one of the oldest universities in the world. The city's main street, known today as Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah Street (or al-Mu'zz street) but historically referred to as the Qasabah or Qasaba, ran from one of the northern city gates (Bab al-Futuh) to the southern gate (Bab Zuweila) and passed between the palaces via Bayn al- Qasrayn. Under the Fatimids, however, Cairo was a royal city which was closed to the common people and inhabited only by the Caliph's family, state officials, army regiments, and other people necessary to the operations of the regime and its city. Fustat remained for some time the main economic and urban center of Egypt. It was only later that Cairo grew to absorb other local cities, including Fustat, but the year 969 is sometimes considered the \\"founding year\\" of the current city. Al-Mu'izz, and with him the administrative apparatus of the Fatimid Caliphate, left his former capital of Mahdia, Tunisia, in 972 and arrived in Cairo in June 973. The Fatimid Empire quickly grew powerful enough to stand as a threat to the rival Sunni Abbasid Caliphate. During the reign of Caliph al-Mustansir (1036-1094), the longest of any Muslim ruler, the Fatimid Empire reached its peak but also began its decline. A few strong viziers, acting on behalf of the caliphs, managed to revive the empire's power on occasion. The Armenian vizier Badr al-Jamali (in office from 1073-1094) notably rebuilt the walls of Cairo in stone, with monumental gates, the remains of which still stand today and were expanded under later Ayyubid rule. The late 11th century was also a time of major events and developments in the region. It was at this time that the Great Seljuk (Turkish) Empire took over much of the eastern Islamic world. The arrival of the Turks, who were mainly Sunni Muslims, was a long-term factor in the so-called \\"Sunni Revival\\" which reversed the advance of the Fatimids and of Shi'a factions in the Middle East. In 1099 the First Crusade captured Jerusalem, and the new Crusader states became a sudden and serious threat to Egypt. New Muslim rulers such as Nur al-Din of the Turkish Zengid dynasty took charge of the overall offensive against the Crusaders. In the 12th century the weakness of the Fatimids became so severe that under the last Fatmid Caliph, al-'Adid, they requested help from the Zengids to protect themselves from the King of Jerusalem, Amalric, while at the same time attempting to collude with the latter to keep the Zengids in check. In 1168, as the Crusaders marched on Cairo, the Fatimid vizier Shawar, worried that the unfortified city of Fustat would be used as a base from which to besiege Cairo, ordered its evacuation and then set the city ablaze. While historians debate the extent of the destruction (as Fustat appears to have continued to exist after this), the burning of Fustat nonetheless marks a pivotal moment in the decline of that city, which was later eclipsed by Cairo itself. Eventually, Salah ad-Din (Saladin), a Zengid commander who was given the position of al-'Adid's vizier in Cairo, declared the end and dismantlement of the Fatimid Caliphate in 1171. Cairo thus returned to Sunni rule, and a new chapter in the history of Egypt, and of Cairo's urban history, opened. = Cairo's ascendance in the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods = Citadel of Salah ad-Din (Saladin), founded in 1176 and further developed by other rulers after him. The 19th-century Mosque of Muhammad Ali is visible overlooking its walls. Madrasa-mosque of Sultan Hasan, Bahri Mamluk period, mid-14th century. Sultan Qaytbay's complex in the Northern Cemetery, Burji Mamluk period, late 15th century. Salah ad- Din's reign marked the beginning of the Ayyubid dynasty, which ruled over Egypt and Syria and carried forward the fight against the Crusaders. He also embarked on the construction of an ambitious new fortified Citadel (the current Citadel of Cairo) further south, outside the walled city, which would house Egypt's rulers and state administration for many centuries thereafter. This ended Cairo's status as an exclusive palace-city and started a process by which the city became an economic center inhabited by common Egyptians and open to foreign travelers. Over the subsequent centuries, Cairo developed into a full-scale urban center. The decline of Fustat over the same period paved the way for its ascendance. The Ayyubid sultans and their Mamluk successors, who were Sunni Muslims eager to erase the influence of the Shi'a Fatimids, progressively demolished and replaced the great Fatimid palaces with their own buildings. The Al-Azhar Mosque was converted to a Sunni institution, and today it is the foremost center for the study of the Qur'an and Islamic law in the Sunni Islamic world. In 1250 the Ayyubid dynasty faltered and power transitioned to a regime controlled by the Mamluks. The mamluks were soldiers who were purchased as young slaves (often from various regions of Central Eurasia) and raised to serve in the army of the sultan. They became a mainstay of the Ayyubid military under Sultan al-Salih and eventually became powerful enough to assume control of the state for themselves in a political crisis during the Seventh Crusade. Between 1250 and 1517, the throne passed from one mamluk to another in a system of succession that was generally non-hereditary, but also frequently violent and chaotic. Nonetheless, the Mamluk Empire continued many aspects of the Ayyubid Empire before it, and was responsible for repelling the advance of the Mongols in 1260 (most famously at the Battle of Ain Jalut) and for putting a final end to the Crusader states in the Levant. Under the reign of the Mamluk sultan al-Nasir Muhammad (1293-1341, including interregnums), Cairo reached its apogee in terms of population and wealth. A commonly-cited estimate of the population towards the end of his reign, although difficult to evaluate, gives a figure of about 500,000, making Cairo the largest city in the world outside China at the time. Despite being a largely military caste, the Mamluks were prolific builders and sponsors of religious and civic buildings. An extensive number of Cairo's historical monuments date from their era, including many of the most impressive. The city also prospered from the control of trade routes between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean. After the reign of al-Nasir, however, Egypt and Cairo were struck by repeated epidemics of the plague, starting with the Black Death in the mid-14th century. Cairo's population declined and took centuries to recover, but it remained the major metropolis of the Middle East. Under the Ayyubids and the later Mamluks, the Qasaba avenue became a privileged site for the construction of religious complexes, royal mausoleums, and commercial establishments, usually sponsored by the sultan or members of the ruling class. This is also where the major souqs of Cairo developed, forming its main economic zone of international trade and commercial activity. As the main street became saturated with shops and space for further development there ran out, new commercial structures were built further east, close to al-Azhar Mosque and to the shrine of al-Hussein, where the souq area of Khan al- Khalili, still present today, progressively developed. One important factor in the development of Cairo's urban character was the growing number of waqf establishments, especially during the Mamluk period. Waqfs were charitable trusts under Islamic law which set out the function, operations, and funding sources of the many religious/civic establishments built by the ruling elite. They were typically drawn up to define complex religious or civic buildings which combined various functions (e.g. mosque, madrasa, mausoleum, sabil) and which were often funded with revenues from urban commercial buildings or rural agricultural estates.Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. 2007. Cairo of the Mamluks: A History of Architecture and its Culture. Cairo: The American University in Cairo Press. By the late 15th century Cairo also had high-rise mixed-use buildings (known as a rab', a khan or a wikala, depending on exact function) where the two lower floors were typically for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were rented out to tenants. = Cairo as a provincial capital of the Ottoman Empire = mashrabiyya windows. (Photo from 1867.)alt= Egypt was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1517, under Selim I, and remained under Ottoman rule for centuries. During this period, local elites fought ceaselessly among themselves for political power and influence; some of them of Ottoman origin, others from the mamluk caste which continued to exist as part of the country's elites despite the demise of the Mamluk sultanate. Cairo continued to be a major economic center and one of the empire's most important cities. It remained the principal staging point for the pilgrimage (Hajj) route to Mecca. While the Ottoman governors were not major patrons of architecture like the Mamluks, Cairo nonetheless continued to develop and new neighbourhoods did grow outside the old city walls. Ottoman architecture in Cairo continued to be heavily influenced and derived from the local Mamluk-era traditions rather than presenting a clear break with the past. Some individuals, such as Abd ar-Rahman Katkhuda al-Qazdaghli, a mamluk official among the Janissaries in the 18th century, were prolific architectural patrons. Many old bourgeois or aristocratic mansions that have been preserved in Cairo today date from the Ottoman period, as do a number of sabil-kuttabs (a combination of water distribution kiosk and Qur'anic reading school). = Cairo under Muhammad Ali Pasha and the Khedives = Sabil of Isma'il Pasha, commissioned by Muhammad Ali Pasha in 1828 in the \\"Ottoman Baroque\\" style. Napoleon's French army briefly occupied Egypt from 1798 to 1801, after which an Albanian officer in the Ottoman army named Muhammad Ali Pasha made Cairo the capital of an independent empire that lasted from 1805 to 1882. The city then came under British control until Egypt was granted its independence in 1922. Under Muhammad Ali's rule the Citadel of Cairo was completely refurbished. Many of its disused Mamluk monuments were demolished to make way for his new mosque (the Mosque of Muhammad Ali) and other palaces. Muhammad Ali's dynasty also introduced a more purely Ottoman style of architecture, mainly in the late \\"Ottoman Baroque\\" style of the time. One of his grandsons, Isma'il, as Khedive between 1864 and 1879, oversaw the construction of the modern Suez Canal. Along with this enterprise, he also undertook the construction of a vast new city in European style to the north and west of the historic center of Cairo. The new city emulated Haussman's 19th-century reforms of Paris, with grand boulevards and squares being part of the planning and layout. Although never fully completed to the extent of Isma'il's vision, this new city composes much of Downtown Cairo today. This left the old historic districts of Cairo, including the walled city, relatively neglected. Even the Citadel lost its status as the royal residence when Isma'il moved to the new Abdin Palace in 1874. Historic sites and monuments Map of historic Cairo, overlaid with present road network, with most of the main surviving monuments indicated. Khan el-Khalili, the major souq or bazaar center of medieval Cairo. = Mosques = While the first mosque in Egypt was the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As in Fustat, the Mosque of Ibn Tulun is the oldest mosque to retain its original form and is a rare example of Abbasid architecture, from the classical period of Islamic civilization. It was built in 876‚Äì879 AD in a style inspired by the Abbasid capital of Samarra in Iraq. It is one of the largest mosques in Cairo and is often cited as one of the most beautiful.O'Neill, Zora et al. 2012. Lonely Planet: Egypt (11th edition), p. 87. One of the most important and lasting institutions founded in the Fatimid period was the Mosque of al-Azhar, founded in 970 AD, which competes with the Qarawiyyin in Fes for the title of oldest university in the world. Today, al-Azhar University is the foremost center of Islamic learning in the world and one of Egypt's largest universities with campuses across the country. The mosque itself retains significant Fatimid elements but has been added to and expanded in subsequent centuries, notably by the Mamluk sultans Qaitbay and al-Ghuri and by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda in the 18th century. Other extant monuments from the Fatimid era include the large Mosque of al-Hakim, the al-Aqmar mosque, Juyushi Mosque, Lulua Mosque, and the Mosque of Salih Tala'i. Ghuriya buildings and the market street in between them, painted by David Roberts in 1839. The most prominent architectural heritage of medieval Cairo, however, dates from the Mamluk period, from 1250 to 1517 AD. The Mamluk sultans and elites were eager patrons of religious and scholarly life, commonly building religious or funerary complexes whose functions could include a mosque, madrasa, khanqah (for Sufis), water distribution centers (sabils), and mausoleum for themselves and their families. Among the best- known examples of Mamluk monuments in Cairo are the huge Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hasan, the Mosque of Amir al-Maridani, the Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad (whose twin minarets were built above the gate of Bab Zuwayla), the Sultan Al- Ghuri complex, the funerary complex of Sultan Qaytbay in the Northern Cemetery, and the trio of monuments in the Bayn al-Qasrayn area comprising the complex of Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun, the Madrasa of al-Nasir Muhammad, and the Madrasa of Sultan Barquq. Some mosques include spolia (often columns or capitals) from earlier buildings built by the Romans, Byzantines, or Copts. = Shrines and mausoleums = Islamic Cairo is also the location of several important religious shrines such as the al-Hussein Mosque (whose shrine is believed to hold the head of Husayn ibn Ali), the Mausoleum of Imam al-Shafi'i (founder of the Shafi'i madhhab, one of the primary schools of thought in Sunni Islamic jurisprudence), the Tomb of Sayyida Ruqayya, the Mosque of Sayyida Nafisa, and others. Some of these shrines are located within the vast cemetery areas known as the City of the Dead or al-Qarafa in Arabic, which adjoin the historic city. The cemeteries date back to the foundation of Fustat, but many of the most prominent and famous mausoleum structures are from the Mamluk era. = Walls and gates = When Cairo was founded as palace- city in 969 by the Fatimids, it was enclosed by a circuit of walls. These were rebuilt in stone in the late 11th century AD by the vizir Badr al-Gamali, parts of which survive today at Bab Zuwayla in the south and Bab al-Futuh and Bab al-Nasr in the north. The walls were extended and modified by the Ayyubids as part of Salah ad-Din's ambitious plan to protect both Cairo and Fustat by a single set of walls. Parts of these walls were recently excavated next to al- Azhar Park, including some Ayyubid gates like Bab al-Barqiya. = Citadel = Salah ad-Din (Saladin) began the construction of an extensive Citadel in 1176 to serve as Egypt's seat of power, with construction finishing under his successors. It is located on a promontory of the nearby Muqattam Hills overlooking the city. The Citadel remained the residence of the rulers of Egypt until the late 19th century, and was repeatedly transformed under subsequent rulers. Notably, Muhammad Ali Pasha built the 19th-century Mosque of Muhammad Ali which still dominates the city's skyline from its elevated vantage point. = Markets and commercial buildings = Street Scene near the El Ghouri Mosque in Cairo, c. 1876 The Mamluks, and the later Ottomans, also built wikalas (caravanserais; also known as khans) to house merchants and goods due to the important role of trade and commerce in Cairo's economy. The most famous example still intact today is the Wikala al-Ghuri, which nowadays also hosts regular performances by the Al-Tannoura Egyptian Heritage Dance Troupe.O'Neill, Zora et al. 2012. Lonely Planet: Egypt (11th edition), p. 81. The famous Khan al-Khalili is a famous souq and commercial hub which also integrated caravanserais. Another example of historic commercial architecture is the 17th-century Qasaba of Radwan Bay, now part of the al-Khayamiyya area whose name comes from the decorative textiles (khayamiyya) still being sold here. Preservation status Much of this historic area suffers from neglect and decay, in this, one of the poorest and most overcrowded areas of the Egyptian capital.Ancient Cairo: Preserving a Historical Heritage, Qantara, 2006.

From its founding in the early 1980s until 1999, it was known as the Center for the Arts & Sciences (CAS). During this period, it was a half-day school utilizing a concentration, or major, program to allow students to focus on specialized areas of study, while spending the other half of the day at their home school. In 1999, the name was changed, and SASA became a full day school, allowing students to take other required classes in addition to their concentration. History The Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy is located in a building that originally housed a Montgomery Ward department store. During the 1980s and 1990s, the CAS shared its building with the Ruben Daniels Center for Lifelong Education, an adult and alternative high school also run by the Saginaw School district. The CAS met with surprising success, and began drawing students from throughout the Saginaw-valley area, including Saginaw, Bay, and Midland counties. In the late 1990s, a committee of students, parents, and teachers, began a campaign to expand the school to include a full-day option. This committee took on the name \\"The River School Project\\", owing to the school's location on the banks of the Saginaw River near downtown Saginaw. Although the committee met with much doubt and resistance, support gradually built, and after several meetings the Saginaw School Board eventually unanimously approved plans to expand the school and change the name to the Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy. In 1999, full-day programs were added for the 9th and 10th grade, with the 11th grade following in 2000, and the 12th grade in 2001. The school building was renovated to include three new full science labs, an atrium, gymnasium, and a new performing arts center that opened at the beginning of the 2010-2011 school year.

Education and early career Stine grew up in Colorado Springs and attended New Mexico Military Institute and Colorado College in Colorado Springs, majoring in physics. Upon his graduation he went to work at White Sands Proving Grounds, first as a civilian scientist and then, from 1955‚Äì1957, at the U.S. Naval Ordnance Missile Test Facility as head of the Range Operations Division. Stine and his wife Barbara were friends of author Robert A. Heinlein, who sponsored their wedding, as Harry's parents were dead and Barbara's mother too ill to travel. Several of Heinlein's books are dedicated one or both of them, most particularly Have Space Suit - Will Travel. Stine wrote science fiction under the pen name \\"Lee Correy\\" in the mid-1950s and under his own name in the 1980s and 1990s, as well as writing science articles for Popular Mechanics. Model rocketry After White Sands, Stine was employed at several other aerospace companies, finally ending up at Martin working on the Titan project. This job was short- lived: he was abruptly fired in 1957 when United Press called him for a reaction to the launch of Sputnik 1, and he repeated to them a passage from his just-published book Earth Satellites and the Race for Space Superiority, in which he wrote, \\"For the first time since the dawn of history, the Earth is going to have more than one moon. This is due to happen within the next few months‚Äîor it may have already happened even at the time you are reading this.\\" The next day he was told to clear out his desk. Back in his days at White Sands he had handled inquiries from young people concerning rockets, and early in 1957 he wrote an article for Mechanics Illustrated about rocket safety. Shortly thereafter he received a letter from Orville Carlisle, who had begun making small models and, more importantly, replaceable solid fuel engines to power them. Stine was impressed with the samples that Carlisle had sent him, and wrote a cover article for the October MI issue about them. After the Martin firing, he contacted Carlisle and the two of them formed Model Missiles Inc., the first manufacturer of model rockets and their engines. Stine also founded the National Association of Rocketry (initially called the Model Missile Association) and wrote the safety code which became its centerpiece; he served as its president until the late 1960s. MMI was short-lived, as they were unprepared to handle the level of business they attracted and because of some poor business decisions. Issues with the production of early engines caused them to seek out Vernon Estes, who came to them in the summer of 1958. Estes's design and construction of \\"Mabel\\", the first engine-manufacturing machine, was the foundation of his success and put Estes Industries in a dominant position in the hobby which it was never to relinquish. Stine continued to work to popularize the hobby, writing the Handbook of Model Rocketry in 1965, which went on through seven editions over the years. He returned to the aerospace industry, continuing to write under his pen name, including a Star Trek novel called The Abode of Life and the original novel Shuttle Down. Under his own name, he was a regular science-fact columnist for Astounding and its later successor Analog, where his intriguing articles were in a position to influence two generations of budding scientists, social thinkers and film artists. He was a consultant to CBS television news during the Apollo program, along with Lindy Davis, Charles Friedlander and Richard C. Hoagland. Stine would also occasionally advise Rick Sternbach and Mike Okuda in their work for Star Trek: the Next Generation as technical artists and advisors, and was credited in Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual for that assistance. The character named \\"Harry Stein\\" in the novel Stardance (by Spider Robinson and Jeanne Robinson) is a homage to Stine. Other work Stine was very interested in the interaction of volunteer/free market Libertarian ideas with space colonization and as a tool of citizen diplomacy and world peace, and so was called to serve as Chair of the Advisory Board of the Libertarian International Organization where he mentored various citizen initiatives until his death. In the wake of his book, The Third Industrial Revolution, he was asked to co-organize the American Astronautical Society 1977 conference on private Space Colonization to re-channel focus away from Space exploration alone, and where he received an award as a Founder of the international space effort. He was interested in the concept of non immediate profit-driven free markets, and was seen as a developer and defender of the \\"pay it forward\\" approach with Robert A. Heinlein, a term also popularized in a movie of that name, starring Kevin Spacey and other stars. In addition to The Third Industrial Revolution, he wrote several other books encouraging public awareness of the possibilities of a lucrative and socially beneficial active space industry. Stine was a founding member of the Citizens' Advisory Council on National Space Policy, and attended several meetings including the 1980 meeting that prepared the space defense policy papers for the Reagan Transition Team. The Council was instrumental in developing the Reagan Strategic Defense Initiative which became known as Star Wars. Additional speculative works later in his life included \\"Warbots\\", a fictional concept based on a melded human/robotic military force that utilized a mixed combination of AI-driven robotic military units with on-site human commanders and enlisted personnel to assess the situation and adjust goals and activities to match the conditions of action in the face of inevitable changes, focusing on the power and dispensability of AI-driven machines with the flexibility and adaptability of the human mind and body. He died on November 2, 1997, in Phoenix, Arizona, of an apparent stroke. SFWA Obituaries, G.

It is the terminus of the Morecambe Branch Line from Lancaster and is situated south of . History =Early years= Heysham Harbour station (hence its current station code) was opened by the Midland Railway on 11 July 1904. It was relocated to an adjacent site on 4 May 1970,Butt (1995), page 119 and served boat trains for Belfast until the closure of the ferry route in April 1975. The train service was withdrawn on 6 October, but reinstated and the station renamed Heysham Sea Terminal, on 11 May 1987 to provide a rail connection with the daily sailing to Douglas run by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company. The station acquired its present name on 28 September 1992. This was under the Regional Railways sector of British Rail. As constructed, the station had three platforms, two signal boxes and an extensive goods depot and associated sidings to service the port complex (which dates from 1904). It handled a range of freight for export including livestock, parcels and fuel oil from a distribution terminal operated by Shell. None of these types of traffic have been handled here since the early 1980s - all freight through the port, mainly containers, is worked by road. A frequent passenger service was provided by the Midland Railway for its work force at the port and the regular ferry sailings to Scotland, the Isle of Man and Northern Ireland. Four years after opening, the MR used the line as a test track for a pioneering system of electrification, utilising a trio of purpose-built 3-car Electric Multiple Units powered by an overhead catenary carrying alternating current at 6600V, 25 Hz.\\"Electrification Pioneers\\" Gloucestershire Transport History; Retrieved 2014-03-11 Stock for the line was built at the company's works and power was provided from their power plant at the harbour. Services ran to Morecambe on 13 April 1908 and by September extended to the LNWR main line station at . With two reversals required en route and a relatively short journey between termini, the units were well suited for the busy route, which operated on a half-hourly frequency for much of the day. Long distance express trains routed by way of the former \\"Little\\" North Western Railway main line from via also used the station. The most notable was a daily through train to/from London St Pancras via connecting with the ferry to Belfast. After the 1923 Grouping, the station and port came under the control of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. The company developed traffic but made alterations to the passenger services, replacing the St Pancras service with one from London Euston via and the West Coast Main Line and added a second regular boat service to and from Manchester Victoria. Services ran to and from Leeds and through carriages were provided for St Pancras passengers in summer until the onset of World War II. The station was host to three LMS caravans in 1934, twelve in 1935 and 36 from 1936 to 1939.McRae (1997), page 22 =Decline and withdrawal of passenger services= Nationalisation in January 1948 saw the London Midland Region of British Railways take over the running of the line. British Railways withdrew the old Midland EMUs in 1951 and, two years later, replaced them with three elderly ex-LNWR sets formerly used on the West London Line service between Earls Court and Willesden Junction (a fourth set was added in 1957). The power feed was adjusted to use an alternating frequency of 50 Hz rather than 25 Hz. The units remained in use until after the Beeching Report in 1963, which recommended that services over the former NWR/Midland route from Lancaster be withdrawn and the line closed. Services to Morecambe would be retained, but only in connection with sailings to Douglas and Belfast and were to be diesel- worked. The proposals were approved in August 1965, and the local service was withdrawn on 3 January 1966.Marshall (1981), page 158 The overheads were dismantled the following year, after the Midland line was closed to all traffic between Morecambe, Lancaster and . Freight traffic continued although from June 1967, it operated via Morecambe, where all trains had to reverse. A further change to traffic patterns came about in 1968, when ferry operator Sealink announced its intention to convert the two ships operating out of the port on the Belfast route to \\"roll-on/roll-off\\" car ferries rather than conventional passenger ships. The change required major alterations to the ferries and to the berths at both termini. At Heysham, the station building was demolished and its replacement built on an adjacent site. The station reopened for traffic on 4 May 1970. As part of the scheme, a new signal box and associated signalling was provided. The viability of the Belfast route was compromised by the Northern Irish Troubles in the years that followed. Mounting losses led to its withdrawal on 5 April 1975 and led the connecting rail services becoming redundant and to the closure of the station to passengers, a few months later. Freight traffic continued but was only a fraction of what had been handled previously and BR rationalised the station layout, mothballing the signal box, removing the signalling and disconnecting one of the two approach lines from Heysham Moss in 1977. The remaining line was operated under \\"One Train Working\\" regulations, with the box acting as a ground frame for controlling the points to the sidings. The disused station had two platform lines accessible for use by railtours and special trains. By 1983, oil trains had ceased and the terminal sidings were then lifted. =Modern era= Passenger trains resumed in 1987, and in 1994, the layout was rationalised again as part of the programme of works associated with the building of the current Morecambe station. The last portion of double track on the branch from Holt Bank Junction to the former ICI sidings at Heysham Moss was singled, redundant trackwork was removed, and the old signal box dismantled (it was subsequently donated to the heritage Dean Forest Railway and has been restored and rebuilt at ).\\"The Signal Box \\" forum - Heysham Harbour www.signalbox.org; Retrieved 2014-03-11\\"Steaming Around Britain's Railways - Forest of Dean, Part 1\\" www.crjennings.com; Retrieved 2014-03-11 After the work was completed, all that remained was the single line from Morecambe running into the one active platform and a private siding connection laid in the early 1970s into Heysham power station. Much of the land occupied by the old goods yard and disused platforms is used by the Port of Heysham's owners, Peel Ports as secure parking for HGVs waiting for ferries. The branch handles occasional freight trains operated by Direct Rail Services from the reprocessing plant at Sellafield to Heysham nuclear power station. They usually run once or twice-weekly and use the siding that diverges from the main running line a short distance east of the station. Access is by means of a ground frame unlocked and operated by the train crew and the trains are usually worked with a locomotive at each end to avoid the need for run-round moves when it reverses at Morecambe. Facilities The facilities at the station are basic: it is unstaffed and a single waiting shelter is provided. All tickets must be purchased in advance or on board the train. There is step- free access from the ferry terminal and car park to the platform.Heysham Port station facilities National Rail Enquiries Although the station is publicly accessible, it can be reached only by travelling along the busy main road into the port complex (either by car or on foot) from Heysham village, which is more than away. Most passengers using the station do so only to connect with the daily ferry sailings as there is no local commuter or residential traffic. Services A twice-daily service formerly served the railway station (the first around midday with a second approximately an hour later), which connected with the ferry to Douglas in the Isle of Man. The services were operated by Northern as an extension of the Lancaster-Morecambe shuttle, but in the late 1980s and early 1990s, one train ran through to/from Manchester Victoria via .

The town is located on the Capel River and is approximately above sea level. Capel has a Mediterranean climate, with hot dry summers and cool wet winters. Daily temperatures range from 13 ¬∞C to 40 ¬∞C in summer, and from 5 ¬∞C to 27 ¬∞C in winter. Average annual rainfall is about 830 mm. Historically, Capel is a farming area; traditional agricultural pursuits include dairy and beef. In recent times, Capel has become popular for hobby farms, and a number of innovative agricultural pursuits have been introduced, including alpacas, viticulture, aquaculture and growing of blue gums. There is also some mining of mineral sands in the Shire, and tourism is increasingly important to the Shire's economy. The Capel area was originally inhabited by the Noongar Aboriginals. It was settled very early in the history of colonial Western Australia. The Capel River was visited by Frederick Ludlow in 1834, but it was not given an English name until the Bussell family settled in the area. The name honours Capel Carter Brockman (1839‚Äì1924),'Brockman, Capel Carter (1839‚Äì1924)', Obituaries Australia, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 7 April 2013. daughter of John Bussell (1803‚Äì1875),Freda Vines Carmody (1966) 'Bussell, John Garrett (1803‚Äì1875)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 1, (MUP) who was named after a Miss Capel Carter, a cousin of the Bussells in England with whom Bussell family members corresponded. In the 1830s a number of settlers followed the Bussells into the area, and both James Stirling and John Hutt, (the first two Governors of Western Australia) took up land in the region. Plans to establish a townsite in the area were first mooted in 1844, but the site was not surveyed until the 1870s and lots were not sold until 1897. Initially the town was named Coolingnup, which is the Noongar name for the place; the name was changed to Capel in 1899. The population of the town was 91 (44 males and 47 females) in 1898. According to the 2016 census figures, the population of the Town of Capel was 2,509, and the population of the Shire of Capel was 17,123.\\"2016 Census, Australian Bureau of Statistics\\" Accessed 31 January 2020. Westralian Sands was established in 1954 but commenced operations in 1959 when it started mining and processing the Yoganup deposit just north of the town. Another company, RGC, operated a mine to the south of the town. In 1998 both companies merged to form Iluka Resources which continues to operate ilmenite mines around the area and produce synthetic rutile at the processing facility to the north of the town along the Bussell Highway.

Historically in Lancashire, Aspull, along with Haigh, is surrounded by greenbelt and agricultural land, separated from Westhoughton, on its southeast side, by a brook running through Borsdane Wood. The ground rises from south to north, reaching , and has views towards Winter Hill and the West Pennine Moors. It has a population of 4,977. Aspull was once a centre of mining and textile manufacture, though little evidence of this can be seen in the village today. Haigh Country Park estate lies to the west. History =Early history= The earliest notice of Aspull is that contained in the survey of 1212, when, as one plough-land, it formed part of the Childwall fee held by Richard son of Robert de Lathom, under the lord of Manchester. The fee was a composite one of 6¬Ω plough-lands (of which Aspull formed one), held chiefly by Richard de Lathom, and partly by Roger de Samlesbury and Alexander de Harwood. In 1302 Richard de Ince, as son and heir of Henry de Sefton, and Adam de Hindley, were found to hold Aspull, as the eighth part of a knight's fee, directly of Thomas Grelley. From this time the lordship has been held with the adjacent Ince by the families of Ince and Gerard in succession; until Aspull was sold to the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres, lord of Haigh. Hindley Hall, in Aspull, the residence of the Hindleys, became the property of James, a younger son of Robert Dukinfield of Cheshire. In the 18th century it was acquired by the Leighs of Whitley Hall, Wigan, and Sir Robert Holt Leigh lived here till his death in 1843. His estates then passed for life to his cousin Thomas Pemberton, who took the name of Leigh, and made Hindley Hall his residence; he was raised to the peerage as Baron Kingsdown in 1858. The hearth tax roll of 1666 shows that 135 hearths were charged. The most considerable houses were those of Richard Green, nine hearths; Peter Orrell and James Dukinfield, eight each; Major Rigby and Thomas Molyneux, seven each; and Edward Gleast, six. St. Elizabeth's C of E Church was built in 1882 by Roger Leigh. The patronage is vested in trustees. There are two Methodist chapels. In 1858 the Roman Catholic church of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception was erected. =Coal= Cannel coal was found in Aspull. There were several large collieries dating back to the 18th century, also malt kilns and a cotton mill. In 1896 the Crawford, Kirkless, Moor and Woodshaw Pits in the township belonging the Wigan Coal and Iron Company employed over 1,000 workers. Aspull's long history of mining left a legacy of old mineshafts, water drainage tunnels (soughs) and abandoned mine workings. The Great Haigh Sough in Haigh Country Park discharged iron rich minewater into the Yellow Brook discolouring the brook and River Douglas downstream with ochre deposits. In 2004 the Coal Authority provided a passive treatment plant in a scheme costing ¬£750,000. Work was undertaken by Ascot Environmental who built a pumping station, pipelines, settlement lagoons, reedbeds and landscaped the site. The scheme has improved the water quality removing the discolouration and allowed fish to populate the brook. The coal-mining tradition lives on in the name of the \\"Collier's Arms\\" pub on Wigan Road, which has a date plaque of 1700 . Geography Aspull is on a crossroads. The principal road is to the north- east/south-west, Blackrod to Wigan. Another road runs north-west/south-east, Standish to the A6 road. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal passes through the western corner of the township. Aspull Moor lies in the northern half of the village. The nearest railway station is at Hindley although Blackrod is only a few yards further distant. Hindley has the more frequent service, whilst Blackrod has the faster service to Manchester. Whilst having colliery (goods) railways Aspull has never had a central railway station of its own. There was, however, on the line from Wigan to Chorley (via Hindley), a station named Dicconson Lane & Aspull some distance from Aspull; that was closed in 1956, before closure of the entire line to passengers in 1960 and to goods in 1966. Sport The town's rugby union club, Aspull RFC, currently plays in the Raging Bull North West League Division 3 North, and also fields a veterans team. The club also a successful junior setup currently consisting of U11s-U14s. The rugby club is based at Woodshaw Park at the base of the Aspull landmark the \\"Woochie\\" where they have full training facilities function rooms and a bar. The club logo is that of an emu.

The origins of the feast are less than certain and may have derived from the dedication of three basilicas on Mount Tabor.Festival icons for the Christian year by John Baggley 2000 pages 58‚Äì60 The feast was present in various forms by the 9th century, and in the Western Church was made a universal feast on 6 August by Pope Callixtus III to commemorate the raising of the Siege of Belgrade (1456).Christian liturgy by Ignatius Puthiadam 2003 page 169 In the Syriac Orthodox, Malankara Orthodox, Revised Julian calendars within Eastern Orthodoxy, Catholic, Old Catholic, and Anglican churches, the Feast of the Transfiguration is observed on 6 August. In some Lutheran traditions preceding the reforms to the liturgy in the 1970s, the 6th of August was also observed as the Feast of the Transfiguration. In those Orthodox churches which continue to follow the Julian Calendar, August 6 falls on August 19 of the Gregorian Calendar. The Transfiguration is considered a major feast, numbered among the twelve Great Feasts in Byzantine Catholicism and Orthodoxy. In all these churches, if the feast falls on a Sunday, its liturgy is not combined with the Sunday liturgy, but completely replaces it. The transfiguration can also be celebrated at other points in the Christian calendar, sometimes in addition to the feast itself. In the ancient western lectionary, the Ember Saturday in Lent included the Transfiguration. In the Revised Common Lectionary, followed by some Lutherans, United Methodists, Anglicans, and others, the last Sunday in the Epiphany season (that immediately preceding Ash Wednesday) is also devoted to this event. In the Church of Sweden and the Church of Finland, however, the Feast is celebrated on the seventh Sunday after Trinity, the eighth Sunday after Pentecost. Byzantine Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches First Fruits brought to be blessed on the Feast of the Transfiguration (Japanese Orthodox Church) In the Byzantine Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, the Transfiguration falls during the Dormition Fast, but in recognition of the feast the fast is relaxed somewhat and the consumption of fish, wine and oil is allowed on this day. In the Byzantine view the Transfiguration is not only a feast in honor of Jesus, but a feast of the Holy Trinity, for all three Persons of the Trinity are interpreted as being present at that moment: God the Father spoke from heaven; God the Son was the one being transfigured, and God the Holy Spirit was present in the form of a cloud. In this sense, the transfiguration is also considered the \\"Small Epiphany\\" (the \\"Great Epiphany\\" being the Baptism of Jesus, when the Holy Trinity appeared in a similar pattern). The Transfiguration is ranked as one of the Twelve Great Feasts of the Byzantine liturgical calendar, and is celebrated with an All-Night Vigil beginning on the eve of the Feast. Grapes are traditionally brought to church to be blessed after the Divine Liturgy on the day of the Transfiguration. If grapes are not available in the area, apples or some other fruit may be brought. This begins the \\"Blessing of First Fruits\\" for the year. The Transfiguration is the second of the \\"Three Feasts of the Saviour in August\\", the other two being the Procession of the Cross on August 1 and the Icon of Christ Not Made by Hand on August 16. The Transfiguration is preceded by a one-day Forefeast and is followed by an Afterfeast of eight days, ending the day before the Forefeast of the Dormition. In Byzantine theology, the Tabor Light is the light revealed on Mount Tabor at the Transfiguration of Jesus, identified with the light seen by Paul on the road to Damascus. Coptic Catholic and Orthodox Churches The Coptic Orthodox Church Celebrates the feast of transfiguration on 19 August, which falls as the 13th of Mesri in the Coptic calendar. The feast is considered one of the seven minor feasts of the church, and is celebrated in the joyful tune. Ethiopian Catholic and Orthodox Churches The Ethiopian Orthodox Church holds the ceremony of Buhe on the Feast of the Transfiguration. Latin Catholic Church In the Roman Catholic Church, the Transfiguration was once celebrated locally in various parts of the Catholic world on different days, including August 6, but was not universally recognized. In 1456, the Kingdom of Hungary repulsed an Ottoman invasion of the Balkans by breaking the Siege of Belgrade. News of the victory arrived in Rome on August 6. Given the importance to international politics at that time of such battles between Christian and Muslim nations, in celebration of the victory Pope Callixtus III elevated the Transfiguration to a Feast day to be celebrated in the entire Roman rite. In 2002, Pope John Paul II selected the Transfiguration as one of the five Luminous Mysteries of the rosary. Old Catholic Church The Old Catholic Church celebrates the Transfiguration typically on August 6, according to the Roman rite calendar; however, every local Old Catholic Church throughout the world has the option to celebrate this major feast on a different day. The Old Catholic theological view of the Transfiguration shares much in common with the Eastern Orthodox perspective. Old Catholics also believe that the transfiguration was a major event that revealed the divinity of Christ; that Jesus is indeed the splendor and eikon of the Father. The Transfiguration shows forth humanity in the splendor of its original form when it was united in the life-giving love of the Triune God. This event reveals the possibility of humanity's theosis. If the Transfiguration falls on a Sunday, it replaces the ordinary liturgical Ordo of the season for Sacred Liturgy. Protestantism After the Reformation the Feast of the Transfiguration was abandoned in the Protestant parts of Germany, but continued to be observed in Sweden. =Anglican Churches= The Feast of the Transfiguration is retained in the Common Worship lectionary of the Church of England (6 August). In the Book of Common Prayer (1549 and 1552) the feast of the Transfiguration, which had had a relatively low rank in the Sarum Calendar is omitted, but was restored to the Calendar, but without a collect and reading being provided, by royal order in 1560. This state of affairs is perpetuated in the 1662 Prayer Book, but this would have been remedied had the 1928 Proposed BCP been approved by Parliament. As it was, the Bishops of the Church of England refused to sanction those who used the abortive 1928 Book of Common Prayer, and the August 6th date came into general use. The American Book of Common Prayer of 1892 introduced it to Episcopal use, and from there it has been taken into most modern Anglican calendars (sometimes called \\"The Transfiguration of Our Lord\\").Philip H. Pfatteicher New Book of Festivals and Commemorations: A Proposed Common Calendar of Saints 2008 p378 =Lutheran Churches in America= The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and the North American Lutheran Church (NALC) observe the Feast of the Transfiguration as the last Sunday after the Epiphany, which is the Sunday immediately preceding Ash Wednesday and the season of Lent. =Reformed Calvinist and Presbyterian= In the Presbyterian Church, the Sunday of the Transfiguration marks the last day of the Epiphany season, on the last Sunday before Ash Wednesday. The inceptive Calvinist tradition rejected all liturgical feasts, including the Feast of the Transfiguration. This, however, does not mean that the Transfiguration itself was ignored by the Calvinists. Calvin's own views on the Transfiguration were far from ambivalent: :\\"It might be asked whether it was really Moses and Elijah who were present or whether only their spectres were set before the disciples, just as often the prophets saw visions of absent things. Although there is much to be said on both sides, as they say, it seems more likely to me that they really were brought to that place.\\"Quoted after \\"A Harmony of the Gospels, II\\" Edinburgh: St Andrew Press, 1972, p. 199. With time, most major feasts were restored to the Reformed ecclesiastical calendar. The Sunday of Transfiguration is now a part of the Revised Common Lectionary. Whether it is celebrated liturgically or in name only, it is left to the discretion of the clergy or Session. The Book of Common Worship of 1993 (Presbyterian Church USA) contains the order of the service for Transfiguration of the Lord. This order is either combined with the Sunday liturgy or replaces it in those congregations which orient themselves towards liturgical practices and observances.The Book of Common Worship, PCUSA.

It is located on the Morecambe Branch Line from to Heysham. The current truncated two-platform station was opened in 1994 to replace the Midland Railway's earlier terminus situated some further west, closer to the town's sea front. The old station building remains in use as a pub and restaurant, but its platforms have been demolished and the site is now occupied by a cinema and the Morecambe indoor market. That station was itself a replacement for the North Western Railway's original two-platform terminus at Northumberland Street (opened in 1851 and closed in March 1907), which was located almost exactly on the same site as the current station and ticket office. Facilities Services are operated by variety of diesel multiple units, including Class 144, Class 150, Class 156 and Class 158 sets. Terminating passenger services usually run into Platform 1. However, trains to/from Heysham must use the Platform 2 line in order to reverse and gain access to the single track Heysham branch. The lines to Platforms 1 and 2 connect 1.6 miles away at a junction east of station. Heysham services (currently one return trip per day Mon-Sat and two on summer Sundays) access the Heysham section by means of a ground frame at the junction which is released by Preston signalling centre (which has supervised the branch since the closure of Bare Lane signal box in December 2012) and operated by the train crew.

Conjuring.(St. Martin's Press, 1992) -page 73-77 The bullet catch may also be referred to as the bullet trick, defying the bullets or occasionally the gun trick. In performance The trick usually involves a gun which is loaded and operated by someone with a knowledge of firearms to demonstrate that no deception is being used. In most instances, the bullet is marked by an audience member so that it can be identified later. Great efforts are usually made to show that the person firing the gun does not come in contact with the person catching the bullet. When magicians Penn and Teller perform the bullet catch, in which each simultaneously catches a bullet shot by the other, a line is drawn down the center of the stage, demonstrating that neither will cross to the other side. When done by Dorothy Dietrich and Ted Annemann the bullets to be used are purchased by a committee ahead of time, kept under guard until performance time, and the bullets are chosen at random at the time of the performance. The gun is then fired through a target (usually a pane of glass, which shatters or is penetrated by a bullet hole) to demonstrate that the gun has actually fired a bullet and the catcher didn't just hide a bullet in his mouth or hand all along. The performer catching the bullet usually collapses, apparently as a result of performing such a feat, and then rises to produce the bullet which is most often spat onto a plate or tray. Historical accounts of the bullet catch describe the bullet being caught in a handkerchief, in a bottle, on a plate or even on the tip of a sword. In more recent times magicians such as Dorothy Dietrich (1981), and later Criss Angel (2000s), and David Blaine (2008) have caught the bullet in a metal cup in their mouth that makes it credible.http://bulletcatch.com The guns that Penn and Teller use in their effect are fitted with laser sights to add to the suspense and drama of the trick, and the magicians present the bullets still between their teeth, before removing them from their mouths. Method As is often the case with magic illusions, there is no single way the bullet catch is performed. The method used varies from performer to performer. The gun or the bullet is rigged in some way; in the simplest form of the bullet catch, the gun is made to fire blanks, and the target through which the 'bullet' passes is set to destruct using a squib. All the performer must do is keep the bullet in his or her mouth until ready to produce it. If the gun is to be loaded in front of the audience, a wax bullet is loaded into the firearm. The spray of liquid wax from the barrel of the gun is enough to break the pane of glass. The magician uses misdirection to exchange the marked bullet with one made of wax and place the marked bullet into his or her mouth. Another method when doing the trick with a muzzle-loading gun that is loaded in front of the audience or by an audience member is to have a magnetic, rather than lead, bullet. A small magnet attached to the ramrod pulls the bullet back out immediately after loading. When the magician takes the rod, he or she removes the bullet and transfers it to his or her mouth. In this version of the trick the gun is always modified, and only simulates firing a shot. This technique is virtually obsolete, however, because modern firearms do not use a ramrod. Another method was to use an entirely real and lethal gun and bullet, and simply have the shooter intentionally miss the magician, who has previously collected the bullet to 'catch', as before. This procedure led to most early deaths from this trick and has since been abandoned. In cases where the bullet is marked by an audience member, the marked bullet is then transferred to the magician through sleight-of-hand, or similar markings are made on another bullet by an off-stage assistant, who then transfers it to the magician. Chung Ling Soo (the stage name of the American magician William Ellsworth Robinson) was killed while performing this trick due to an equipment malfunction. The gun used for the trick was set up to discharge a blank in the ramrod tube below the barrel. However, the gun malfunctioned and the bullet that had been loaded into the main barrel was accidentally fired into Soo's lung. History One of the earliest documentations of the bullet catch appeared in Jean Chassanion's Histoires m√©morables des grans & merveilleux iugements et punitions de Dieu (1586), translated as The Theatre of God's Judgements by Reverend Thomas Beard in 1597. In the source, the magician is considered to have made himself invulnerable by black magic, but a trick by sleight of hand and prepared equipment is clearly being described, despite this misunderstanding. In Beard's version: \\"It is not long since there was in Lorraine, a certaine man called Coulen, that was overmuch giuen to this cursed Art, amongst whose tricks this was one to be wondred at: that he would suffer Harquebouses or a pistoll to be shot at him, and catch their bullets in his hand without receiving any hurt\\". God's punishment for this use of the cursed art of black magic follows: \\"but vpon a certaine time one of his seruants being angry with him, hot him such a knock with a pistoll (notwithstanding all his great cunning) that he killed him therewith\\". (The Theatre of God's Judgements (1597), p.120: \\"hot him\\" may be a misprint for 'hit him'.) Throughout the 18th century, variations of the bullet catch were developed by a number of street performers. In his 1785 book Natural Magic or Physical Amusements Revealed, Philip Astley wrote that he himself had invented the trick in 1762. However, two books published in 1761 mentioned the bullet catch as described by Reverend Beard: The Conjuror Unmasked by Thomas Denton, and La Magie blanche d√©voil√©e by Henri Decremps (the former an English translation of the French text). In fact, Astley's publication plagiarized much of its material from Descremps, including a similar cover illustration, but altered the material to depict conjurers in a more positive light. Between 1813 and 1818 a troupe known as the 'Indian Jugglers', advertised as being from Seringapatam,The Times (London, England), Wednesday, October 25, 1815. p. 1: \\"... those superior INDIAN JUGGLERS, lately arrived in this country from Seringapatam ...\\" included the trick in their shows given in London and Dublin. In 1817 The Times carried a report of a fatal accident in Dublin, allegedly caused when a pistol 'actually loaded with powder and ball was, by mistake, substituted for that prepared in the usual way.'The Times (London, England), December 8, 1817, p. 3 In a later newspaper item however the chief of the troupe, Mr Ramusamee, denied this story, stating that no-one had ever been killed.The Times (London, England), February 7, 1818, p. 1 Around 1840, Scottish magician John Henry Anderson began demonstrating the gun trick in theatres throughout Britain. Anderson, or The Great Wizard of the North as he was called, performed for P.T. Barnum, Czar Nicholas, Queen Victoria, and Prince Albert and toured in the United States and Australia, thus bringing the bullet catch into mainstream magic illusions. At least four of Anderson's rivals adapted and imitated his trick in their own performances.Randi, James. Conjuring.(St. Martin's Press, 1992) -page 76 The bullet catch is arguably one of the most dangerous and daring illusions that a magician can attempt, even when performed in a controlled situation. Legends surround the trick, claiming that more than twelve magicians have been killed while performing it. Although there are few documented cases of death, there are several accounts of the performer being shot. The number of deaths surrounding the bullet catch has given rise to a story that the trick carries with it a curse to those who attempt to perform it, though in reality there have been far more successful performances than fatalities. These magicians often include stories of death, dismemberment and curses as part of the staging of many tricks in order to build up hype. Thomas Frost in his 1876 book The Lives of the Conjurors wrote of two separate performers in the 1820s, Torrini De Grisy and De Linsky, who were responsible for the deaths of their son and wife, respectively. In 1869, a performer by the name of Dr. Epstein was killed when the tip of the wand he was using to ram the charge into the gun broke off inside and was subsequently launched at him when the gun was fired. The best documented instance of a performer being killed while performing the gun trick is the case of Chung Ling Soo who was shot dead when a firearm malfunctioned in London in 1918.Randi, James. Conjuring.(St. Martin's Press, 1992) -page 74 This event ended the popularity of the bullet catch trick for nearly 70 years. Escape artist and daredevil Harry Houdini wrote a historical account of the illusion and considered adding it to his repertoire but is said to have been afraid to actually perform it. American mentalist Theodore Annemann presented a dramatic outdoor version of the bullet catch throughout his career in the 1930s until his death in 1942. German magician Ralf Biallaa short biography : Winkler, Gisela and Dietmar : Bialla, in : Das gro√üe Hokuspokus (Berlin, 1981), pp. 410\\"Ralf Bialla\\" Zauber-Pedia Zauber-Lexikon started to perform the bullet catch in the 1950s for a fee of 2,000 DM a performance. He wore bullet-proof glasses, strong gloves on his hands with which he covered parts of his face, and his front teeth were made of steel. A .22 rifle was fired, and the bullet had to go through three glass panes before Bialla caught it with his teeth. He was seriously wounded nine times but survived. He was portrayed in the 1972 documentary film Wer schie√üt auf Ralf Bialla?. He died in 1975 after falling off a cliff, supposedly because of constant dizziness caused by the injuries. In 1964 Nigel Backhurst (who later performed as Nigel Gordon) developed a version of the Bullet Catch using a .22 air rifle, which he performed for his membership audition to the Staffordshire Magical Society. He later wrote an article describing the method used in Abracadabra and continued to perform the effect until 2000 with the Theatre of The Damned. In July 1980, Dorothy Dietrich was booked to perform her version of the bullet catch for the International Brotherhood of Magicians, and to be featured on the TV show Evening Magazine. Her version differed in that she allowed an independent committee to buy and bring the bullets under guard. In 1988, she performed the bullet catch in a performance at Donald Trump's Resorts International in Atlantic City for the casino's 10th anniversary. This was shown throughout the world on a TV special called Just for the Record, The best of everything. On another occasion, she performed the trick on the television show You Asked for It,New York Times hosted by Rich Little. On yet another occasion, she performed it for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on a show called Autobus du Canada, and received the highest amount ever paid to a magician by Canadian television. She advertised that she was the only woman to perform the bullet catch in her mouth. Dorothy Dietrich is mentioned on the hit show House MD in a segment about her bullet catch. (Year 8, Segment 8, \\"Perils of Paranoia\\"). In 2006, the bullet catch trick was tested on the TV show MythBusters. The crew used a slaughtered pig's head to see if it were feasible for a human jaw to withstand the force of a bullet. Despite having stronger teeth than a human, the pig's teeth and jaw were badly damaged. After judging the trick \\"busted\\", the crew was challenged to design a precisely timed mechanical bullet catching rig. This device was only modestly successful at catching a bullet, and only after the \\"jaws\\" were switched from a human shaped metal jaw to a longer duckbill one with more surface area. Even with perfect timing aided by ultra-high speed photography, the bullet deteriorated into an almost unrecognizable mass of metal upon impact. Criss Angel has performed the trick at least twice. In a radio interview with Penn Jillette in February 2006, Angel says there is an unaired performance that was \\"so believable\\" that the television network A&E; would not broadcast it. In this performance, his musician friend Jonathan Davis appeared to fire a high-powered rifle into a metal cup that was custom-made to fit into Criss' mouth.Criss Angel discusses his bullet trick (at 28m10s) on Penn Radio On episode 3 of Criss Angel BeLIEve, Angel performs a version of the trick using a padded glove. David Blaine performs a version of the bullet catch in which he catches the bullet in his mouth with a steel shot glass.David Blaine catches a bullet in his mouth on YouTube Monalisa Perez, 20, fatally shot her boyfriend in a botched YouTube stunt in July 2017. She pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter in December for shooting her boyfriend and father of her two children, 22-year-old Pedro Ruiz III, and was sentenced to six months in jail. Perez, who was pregnant at the time with their second child, fired a bullet into a book that Ruiz was holding against his chest. http://bulletcatch.com https://people.com/crime/pregnant-mom-fatally-shot-boyfriend-youtube-stunt- sentenced/ https://news.abs-cbn.com/overseas/03/15/18/woman-who-shot- boyfriend-dead-in-youtube-stunt-jailed-6-months =Famous performers= Coulew of Lorraine (France, early 17th century; clubbed to death with his own gun by an irate assistant in 1613) * Kia Khan Khruse (Britain, shot by spectator in 1818 but not killedHistory of 12 Have Died) * De Linsky (Germany, killed his wife in 1820) * \\"Torrini\\" De Grisy (killed his son Giovanni in 1826) * Annie Vernone (Britain, 1850s) * John Henry Anderson (Britain, 1860s) * Alexander Smith (Britain, 1860s) * Jean Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin (France, 1860s) * Dr. Epstein (Paris, killed in 1869) * De Line (killed his son in 1890) * The Great Herrmann and, wife, Adelaide (United States, 1890s) * Oscar Eliason, Dante The Great (the US and Australasia, 1890s) * Robert (Bob) \\"Doc\\" Cunningham (United States, 1890s) * Michael Hatal (United States, shot by audience member in 1899) * \\"Bosco\\" Blumenfeld (Switzerland, shot by audience member in 1906) * Edvin Lindberg (Germany, killed in 1905) * Chung Ling Soo (London, killed in 1918) * Theodore Annemann (United States, 1930s) * Jean Hugard (New Zealand, 1940s) * Maurice Fogel (Britain, 1940s‚Äì1960s), wounded at least once * Maurice Rooklyn (Australia, 1950s) * The Great Carson (Jack Carson) (Australia 1953) * Prince Sil (India, 1978s) * Ralf Bialla (Germany, 1950s ‚Äì 1975), wounded nine times, starring in the documentary \\"Wer schie√üt auf Ralf Bialla?\\" (1972) by Hans-Dieter Grabe * Robert Culp and Morgan Fairchild, \\"Circus of the Stars\\" (United States, 1982) * Dorothy Dietrich (United States, 1981) * Carl Skenes (United States, 1980s) * Ben Robinson (United States, 1980s) * Paul Daniels (Britain, 1980s) * Steven \\"Banachek\\" Shaw (United States, 1980s) * Val Valentino, with a gimmicked gun, as the Masked Magician in the show \\"Breaking the Magicians' Code: Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed\\" * Morgan Strebler (United States, 1990s) * Penn & Teller (United States, 1990s‚Äì2010s) * Joe Labero (Tunisia, 2000s) * Matt the Knife (United States, 2000s‚Äì2010s) * Criss Angel (United States, 2000s) * Garrett \\"Jeffy\\" Stevenson (United States, 2000s) * Brock Gill (United States, 2000s) * David Blaine (United States, September 24, 2008 as a part of \\"Dive of Death\\") * Keith Barry (Ireland, 2010s) * Steve Cohen, wounded by a glass shard (United States, 2012) * Alexandre Alexander (Ukraine, August 29, 2011 as a part of \\"Phenomenon\\") * Rob Drummond (London, 2013) * Pedro Ruiz III killed (Minnesota, June 26, 2017)http://bulletcatch.com References Sources Harmon, Daniel. \\"Houdini, The Greatest Showman of All?\\" in \\"The New York Times\\" (November 1, 1981). * Poundstone, William.

He started taking pictures but almost by accident an American reporter offered to buy some that he saw. So Loyd became a war photographer supporting himself by selling photos for 50 Deutsche Marks per photograph. Much later Loyd was traveling taking photos with British forces around Travnik, central Bosnia and Herzegovina about 90 km west of Sarajevo. While covering a fire fight a French correspondent who was writing for The Daily Telegraph was wounded by a claymore mine set off by the Croat HVO forces. The wounded correspondent asked Loyd to fill in until the paper could send a replacement, Loyd agreed and so started his first job as a journalist. Afterwards he was put on retainer by The Times of London and regularly sent to war zones around the world. Among the wars he reported were the conflicts in Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and Iraq. Loyd was noted for the risks he took in pursuing his stories. His most recent bylines (as of 15 September 2005) have been from Baghdad, where he has been out on patrol with both the American and Iraqi forces. =Shamima Begum= Loyd found ISIL bride Shamima Begum in the Al-Hawl camp in Northern Syria.

It began in 1928 as My Weekly Reader. Editions covered curriculum themes in the younger grade levels and news-based, current events and curriculum themed-issues in older grade levels. The publishing company also created workbooks, literacy centers, and picture books for younger grades. In 2012, Weekly Reader ceased operations as an independent publication and merged with its new owner, Scholastic News, due primarily to market pressures to create digital editions as well as decreasing school budgets. History Formerly My Weekly Reader, the Weekly Reader was a weekly newspaper for elementary school children. It was first published by the American Education Press of Columbus, Ohio, which had been founded in 1902 by Charles Palmer Davis to publish Current Events, a paper for secondary school children.History of American Education Publications, Inc. 1902‚Äì1965. Columbus, Ohio: American Education Publications, 1965. p. 3. The first issue of My Weekly Reader appeared on September 21, 1928.Sayre, Harrison M. Random Recollections. Iowa City, Iowa: (Privately published), [1974], 2011. p. 105. The first editor was Martha Fulton, who had been hired that summer by Preston Davis, the major owner of the Press, and Harrison Sayre, who became managing editor. Sayre, also the editor of World News, a paper for high school students, had been urged to start a paper for grade schools by teachers he had met in June 1928, while on a sales trip in Indiana. Martha Fulton, who was a friend of Sayre's wife, Mary, and a graduate of Wells College, enjoyed travel and adventure. During World War I, she had been an American Red Cross worker in France. She also had \\"a remarkable rapport with children and had lively interests in every direction.\\"Sayre, p. 105 The lead article was about the boyhoods of Herbert Hoover and Al Smith. There were two shorter articles: \\"Wings for Safety\\", about street crossing guards; and, \\"Sky Medicine\\", which was about the healthful qualities of the Sun. The most popular was a letter from \\"Uncle Ben\\" about a ride in a German glider on Cape Cod.My Weekly Reader, September 21, 1928. Fulton wrote all these articles. Her sister Peg was the first artist, though soon replaced by her friend Mary Sherwood Wright.Sayre, p. 106 Beginning with the third issue, Eleanor Johnson, director of elementary schools in York, Pennsylvania, designed tests for the back page.Sayre, p. 110History, p. 106 My Weekly Reader was an instant success. By December, circulation was 99,000. In 1929, a second edition was started for younger children, and their combined circulation was 376,000. By 1931, there were four editions, with a combined circulation of 1,099,000.Circulation ledger, AEP archives, 1986. Middletown, Connecticut: AEP Offices. The secrets of its early success were the timely news articles that had a children's angle, and the Uncle Ben letters describing new inventions and discoveries that excited children's imaginations. For example, the second issue's lead article, \\"A Village Moves to the South Pole\\", was about Admiral Byrd's 75-man expedition, their sled dogs, and Paul Siple, a Boy Scout who was with them. Uncle Ben wrote about planned \\"Seadromes\\", floating airports that airplanes could use to hop across the Atlantic. The third issue, published on October 5, 1928, began with \\"How Mother Nature Prepares for Winter\\". Uncle Ben described seeing his \\"first radio television set\\", even though the paper itself had yet to print even a photograph‚Äîillustrations for the Reader having only been drawings to date. On October 12, he wrote about Zeppelins, and the first Reader photographs appeared. They depicted \\"Mr. and Mrs. Hoover\\" and \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Grandchildren\\". Harrison Sayre, who became president of the American Education Press while remaining managing editor of My Weekly Reader, gave Martha Fulton the major credit for the newspaper's popularity. In his memoirs, Sayre quoted Gertrude Wolff, another editor who shared an office with Fulton: \\"As I had had some editorial experience, she at times sought my advice on minor details, but the conception and execution of those first issues were hers alone. With her imagination, enthusiasm, intuitive understanding of a child's world, she sensed what would appeal to her young readers. Her very personal stamp on the new publication distinguished the succeeding issues during her years as editor.\\"Sayre, p. 109 As the new editions for upper and lower grades were added, Fulton remained the principal writer, even after her marriage in 1930 (to Clarence L. Sager, a New York City lawyer) and her moves to New York City and Old Greenwich, Connecticut. Sayre remembered that Fulton wrote for the papers for 12 years, adding that \\"men of the composing room...testify that with her square, legible, longhand copy, she never missed a deadline.\\"Sayre, p. 111 Other people who were important to the newspaper's early years were Laura E. Zirbes, a reading expert at the Ohio State University laboratory school, and Dr. Charles H. Judd of the University of Chicago, who introduced Sayre to Dr. William S. Gray, who in turn supplied Fulton with graded vocabulary lists. In 1930, Eleanor Johnson moved from York to Lakewood, Ohio, where she was assistant superintendent of schools until 1934, when she moved to Columbus and later became a managing editor.History, p. 54 In 1934, a fifth edition was added for the fifth and sixth grades. The price was twenty cents per semester. Circulation continued to rise, passing two million in 1942. Many people still fondly remember the papers they read as children and how they looked forward to Friday afternoons when their teachers handed out the latest issue. In 1949, the American Education Press was sold to Wesleyan University and became American Education Publications, a division of the Wesleyan University Press. Editorial offices were moved to Middletown, Connecticut, but printing continued to be done in Columbus, Ohio. There were then six editions, one for each elementary grade, with a total circulation of 4,269,000. Total circulation of AEP papers was 5,605,000. In 1965, Wesleyan sold American Education Publications to the Xerox Corporation. By then, there was also a kindergarten edition. Eleanor Johnson was editor-in-chief of all editions. In later years, there were other owners, including the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and Field Publications. A pre-kindergarten edition was added in 1980. There were also curriculum-specific magazines for middle and high school students, including areas such as health, science, careers, reading, and writing. Weekly Reader Publishing, which began with the publication of the first Current Events on May 20, 1902, celebrated its 100th birthday in 2002. At various times through its publishing history, the magazine was known as My Weekly Reader or Weekly Reader. In 2007, Weekly Reader Corporation became part of The Reader's Digest Association, based in Chappaqua, New York. Weekly Readers main office was relocated from Stamford, Connecticut, to Chappaqua at the end of May 2007. Financial difficulties marred the publication during its time under Reader's Digest ownership; the magazine made efforts to launch an online presence for the magazine but were unable to secure the funds from the parent organization to do so, a factor in the magazine's decline. In February 2012, Weekly Reader was acquired by Scholastic,RDA Sells Weekly Reader which operated the competing Scholastic News. Scholastic announced that it would be shutting down Weekly Reader publication and moving some of its staff to Scholastic News. Following the completion of the merger, the merged magazines are:Weekly Reader Classroom Magazine For Kids Retrieved September 24, 2012. * Let‚Äôs Find Out / Weekly Reader Pre-K * Let‚Äôs Find Out / Weekly Reader K * Scholastic News / Weekly Reader Edition 1 * Scholastic News / Weekly Reader Edition 2 * Scholastic News / Weekly Reader Edition 3 * Scholastic News / Weekly Reader Edition 4 * Scholastic News / Weekly Reader Edition 5/6 Polls One of the best-known events in the magazine's history is its quadrennial \\"Weekly Reader Student Presidential Election Poll\\". The poll is an educational exercise in which Weekly Reader-subscribing teachers conduct mock elections to find their students' preference for president. Teachers tabulate the results, then send them to Weekly Reader. (Since the 2000, the surveys have been developed with, and tabulated by, the Zogby International polling organization.) This survey of students in grades K through 12 began in 1956, when readers chose Dwight Eisenhower over Adlai Stevenson. The poll has now been conducted 14 times, most recently in 2008, and the students have voted for the person who became president 13 out of 14 times. The exception was in 1992, when George H.W. Bush garnered more votes than Bill Clinton. Third-party candidate Ross Perot, whose presence on the national ballot was important during the actual election, was not on the Weekly Reader ballot that year. Read In 2005, Weekly Reader Publishing's literary magazine, Read, launched Word, a blog that features student writing and other literary news. It also offers interactive opportunities for reading and writing, including its \\"What's Your Story?\\" program, which features \\"The Weekly Writer\\", where students can help authors such as Stephen King and R. L. Stine finish an original story. Read magazine has pioneered \\"electronic issues\\" around literary themes, including Canterbury Tales, William Shakespeare, and Edgar Allan Poe; these interactive websites incorporate video and film, music and sound effects, rap renditions and flash animation. In the 2009-2010 school year, the company extended these \\"e-issues\\" to four other Weekly Reader publications, including Weekly Reader editions 3 and Senior (4-6 grades), Current Events and Current Science magazines.

It is used mostly for American football games. The stadium is Located at 1085 S. Kimball Ave. in Southlake, Texas, the stadium serves Carroll ISD, and is the home of the Carroll Senior High School Dragons football team. The stadium was used by the Major League Soccer club Dallas Burn for the 2003 season, after having used the Cotton Bowl since its founding in 1996. The stadium was built in 2001 and the first game held at the stadium was on September 7, 2001, an American football game against the Haltom Buffaloes. The final cost of the stadium was in the range of between $18 million and $19 million. The stadium shares land with the Transportation Offices for Carroll ISD. Before 2003, the stadium could seat 8,000 people. When the Dallas Burn Soccer Club terminated their lease with Carroll ISD, they left bleachers that they had assembled in the East endzone. The new capacity is approximately 11,000 people. The endzone bleachers are home to the Carroll Dragon Band and the Emerald Belle Drill Team at home games. The Press Box is accessed via elevator and has two floors. The second floor houses operations and coach booths. The first floor houses administration and scouting personnel. The playing surface is artificial and encompasses many draining features due to how easily the concourse can flood in heavy rains. In 2006, the home parking lot was doubled in size due to expected population growth. As of August 2006, the Carroll ISD school board voted to hold all future graduation ceremonies for graduating seniors of Carroll Senior High at Dragon Stadium. The decision spurred a lot of controversy due to possible weather issues and heat concerns. In 2006, Under Armour filmed part of a popular commercial called \\"Click-Clack\\" at Dragon Stadium. One of the opening scenes shows Green Bay Packers linebacker A. J. Hawk running across the turf at Dragon Stadium. One interesting feature of the stadium is that, if one sits on the north side, it is possible to see another local high school football stadium standing in the shadows: Mustang-Panther Stadium built in the 1970s, operated by the neighboring GCISD Grapevine- Colleyville Independent School District. In June 2009, the Carroll ISD school board voted to issue bonds to pay for a $5 million renovation of the stadium. This renovation enclosed both east and west endzones. New England Patriots player Rob Gronkowski snuck into the stadium in June 2017 for a workout and posted on his social media.

Though his activity in the anarchist movement was limited, he garnered much attention as a result of his crimes and of his age. He was also seen as one of the first people of a growing group of revolutionaries (largely anarchist) who subscribed to the doctrine of the \\"propaganda of the deed\\", which would later take the life of many governmental figures.  Life  Henry grew up in a liberal, aristocratic family with anarchist sympathies. They were exiled to Spain for a time because his father, Fortune Henry, was a communard (a supporter of the 1871 Paris Commune). As a result, Henry was born in Barcelona and regaled from an early age with stories of state oppression. These anti-state attitudes were confirmed when the Spanish authorities confiscated the Henry family's property due to their political beliefs. Henry's father was forced to take a miserable factory job and died of mercury poisoning when Henry was only 10 years old. The family returned to France and Henry's brother, an anarchist, eventually helped him establish connections with French revolutionary circles. Henry passed the writing portion of the entrance exam for the prestigious √âcole Polytechnique, but he failed his oral exams and went on to find work as a trainee for an engineering firm. Henry was furious over the state execution of fellow anarchist Auguste Vaillant. Motivated by the French Third Republic's endemic political corruption, Vaillant carried out a bomb attack on the French Chamber of Deputies on 9 December 1893. Although there were no fatalities, twenty deputies were injured. Henry took it upon himself to avenge Vaillant's death. Henry's capture He saw the caf√© as a representation of the bourgeoisie itself and his intent was to kill as many people as possible in the bombing. When brought to trial for these acts, he was asked by the courts why he had needlessly harmed so many innocent people, to which he replied, \\"‚Ä¶there are no innocent bourgeois\\", adding that his acts caused the \\"insolent triumphs\\" of the bourgeoisie to be shattered, and \\"its golden calf would shake violently on its pedestal, until the final blow knocks it into the gutter and pools of blood.\\" This was not Henry's first terrorist act; already on November 8, 1892, he had placed a time bomb at the offices of the Carmaux Mining Company, which had exploded when the police removed it, killing five officers in the commissariat on the rue des Bons-enfants. Indeed, after his arrest for the Terminus bombing, Henry took credit for a series of other bombings in Paris, and in his apartment was found material to make many more explosive devices. Henry was executed by guillotine on 21 May 1894. His last words were reputed to be \\"Courage, camarades! Vive l'anarchie!\\" Excerpts of Henry's address to the jury > I became an anarchist only recently. It was no longer ago than around > mid-1891 that I threw myself into the revolutionary movement. Previously, I > had lived in circles wholly permeated with the established morality. I had > been accustomed to respecting and even cherishing the principles of the > nation, family, authority and property. > But those educating the present generation all too often forget one thing ‚Äì > that life, indiscreet with its struggles and setbacks, its injustices and > iniquities, sees to it that the scales are removed from the eyes of the > ignorant and that they are opened to reality.

Everywhere I went, I witnessed the same > pain in some, the same delights in others. It did not take me long to > realize that the same great words that I had been raised to venerate: honor, > devotion, duty were merely a mask hiding the most shameful turpitude. > The factory-owner amassing a huge fortune on the back of the labor of his > workers who lacked everything was an upright gentleman. The deputy, the > minister whose hands were forever outstretched for bribes were committed to > the public good. The officer testing his new model rifle on seven-year-old > children had done his duty well, and in open parliament the premier offered > him his congratulation. Everything I could see turned my stomach and my mind > fastened on criticism of social organization. The criticism has been voiced > too often to need rehearsing by me. Suffice it say that I turned into an > enemy of a society which I held to be criminal. > Momentarily attracted by socialism, I wasted no time in distancing myself > from that party.

The brand has three consoles, the GameKing I, the GameKing II and the GameKing III. A fourth console, the Handy Game, was produced by Timetop and shares some branding, but otherwise has little to do with the GameKing franchise. GameKing I (GM-218) The original GameKing console is a 8-bit handheld game console. It is based around a 65C02 CPU running at 6.0 MHz. It is fashioned to look like Nintendo's Game Boy Advance and comes in a wide array of vivid pastel colours, either opaque or transparent, and uses 2 AAA size batteries. The original GameKing lacks a backlit screen, a feature which has been added in its \\"successor\\", the GameKing II. The consoles have above-average sound circuitry capable of multi-channel music and digital sound playback, but a comparably low quality greyscale LCD screen, only supporting four shades of grey and having a very low (48 by 32 pixels) resolution, combined with a slow refresh rate, poor readability and adjustments, compared to the original Game Boy. Games can be compared to some of the earlier built- in cell phone games (pre Java games), while their playing speed (scrolling etc.) and audio is far superior (multi-channel music and digitized samples and voices are quite common in GameKing games). =Audio hardware= It is unclear whether the machine uses a traditional programmable sound generator or relies only on digital samples for music and sound effects. Many of its games have soundtracks consisting of short audio samples with a sampling rate of 8 kHz, as opposed to games on other systems such as the Game Boy where sound is generated by a custom programmable sound generator. =Video hardware= According to Brian Provinciano's reverse engineering of the GameKing,The Low Level: The Game King Handheld most GameKing games heavily rely on bitmap rather than tile-based rendering of the screen, e.g. most levels in its platform and shoot 'em up games are in reality large 4-colour bitmaps, instead of using the most common method of graphic tiles and tile maps, like in most other game consoles and arcade games. This was probably done for economic reasons (the CPU alone can handle all graphics easily, at that resolution) and easy development of the games, apart from the objectively low resolution of the screen. While such a scheme seems to work, it has the disadvantage of using cartridge space inefficiently, so that e.g. most platform games are limited to 3 levels. At this point, it is unknown if the GameKing uses some form of sprite rendering, although this is probably unlikely and unnecessary. GameKing II (GM-219) A GameKing II (GM-219) with its selection menu The GameKing II, on the other hand, is fashioned to look like Sony's PlayStation Portable, comes in more sober colors (either black, grey, white or aqua - and although not shown on the packaging, yellow ones do also exist), and uses 3 AAA size batteries, of which only 2 are used to actually power up the GameKing's hardware, while the third one serves to power up both its built-in audio amplifier (a bit more powerful than the one on the original GameKing) and its backlit LCD screen (which can be turned on and off at will, depending on external lighting conditions, thus saving power). The unit can still work with 2 batteries, only with no sound and no backlighting available. Also, the GameKing II has a fixed color background picture for its LCD screen, only visible when the backlighting is switched on. This is probably to give the false impression of having a colour LCD screen, as implied on its box. The picture may vary between various GameKing models, however it has a mostly negative effect on screen readability when the backlighting is turned on. This background picture can also be removed or replaced simply by opening the machine and removing the small plastic transparency behind the LCD. Removing it makes using the backlighting much more effective. This model would also be the last in the Gameking line to have the text \\"3in1\\" stamped above the screen. Notes: Likewise with the GK, no page exists for the GKII, but the Chinese site still lists the machine as product code GM-219.GM-219 =GK \\"I\\" vs. GK II= However, the two models are fully hardware compatible, can use the same games/cartridges, both have volume and contrast controls and use the same LCD screen. Also, they both have an external DC power supply 3.5 mm minijack plug; however, the plug is not labeled as such, and its function is only slightly hinted at in the units' manuals. The GameKing requires 3V DC, while the GameKing2 requires 4.5V DC with the peculiarity of needing to keep at least one battery in the unit in order to have sound and backlighting. GameKing III (GM-220) TimeTop quietly released a third GameKing machine, called the 'GameKing III' or GM-220 sometime in 2005. While early advertisements showed the GameKing III with the same \\"false color\\" background picture as the GameKing I and II, which indicated that the system was black and white like the previous GameKing models, the GM-220 is full colour. Another distinction of the GM-220 is that unlike its predecessors, the Gameking I and II, which were promoted and marketed worldwide, the Gameking III was not distributed outside of Asia, making it much less common than the earlier models. In 2005, many websites initially reported the device as \\"coming soon\\", and it is not known why Timetop eventually decided to offer only a limited release. Although accurate technical information is hard to obtain, it seems to be a handheld console using a 64-colour (or grey shades) LCD or TFT screen, although little else is known about it. It was available in black, silver, dark violet, and blue. The resolution doesn't seem enhanced compared to an original GameKing, and \\"classic\\" GameKing cartridges are automatically colorized, while games especially developed for it allegedly make use of the full color palette, which for the moment remains unknown. The site claimed a total of 12 carts for this system. If the built-in game is included, 8 titles are known as of 2010. A new design for the GKIII was placed in April 2006 at the Timetop site, and later removed (see GM-221, below). =GM-221= 200px A second design for the Gameking III also exists which combines elements from the GM-219 with the GM-220. The Button design and layout is from the GM-220 design, with the \\"A\\" button being distinctly larger than the \\"B\\" button, but the overall form is obviously inspired from Sony's PSP design. Several colors are shown on the back of the box, green and orange for example, however only two colors, a black edition and a white edition are confirmed to exist. =GM-222= The GM-222 sports an original design, which does not borrow much from previous models. Even though it is sequenced later than the other consoles in the Gameking line, and therefore one would expect more advanced hardware, it is in fact a redesigned Gameking II. Moreover, besides returning to the lo-res black and white screen, the back-light has also been removed (notice however that the box for the GM-221 and GM-222 both show exactly the same false color screen shot, despite the two machines vastly different capabilities). It is not known why Timetop choice to release the GM-222 in this fashion, although renderings exist that show this design was intended at some point to be a full color model. It was available in charcoal, blue, and green. Handy Game (GM-228) 200px A distinct Timetop console exists which uses NES compatible hardware rather than the proprietary hardware of the other Gameking consoles, and also has an integrated TV output. While early mockups indicated this handheld was considered part of the Gameking line, Timetop eventually removed the gameking branding from this edition prior to its release, replacing it with \\"Timetop LTPS Handy Game\\" ( ironically, \\"handy-game\\" was the working title EPYX coined in 1987 for what would become the Atari Lynx). The console comes with 25 built-in games and is also able to accept cartridges, however their size and connectors are different from (and incompatible with) previous Gameking consoles. The game selection includes games typically found on NES clones, like 1942, Pooyan or Dig Dug, as well as graphic ROM hacks of famous NES games (for example, using Blue's Journey graphics with Adventure Island). The GM-228 was available in a large variety of colors with some faceplaces containing very elaborate designs. Colors included silver, black, green, yellow, and pink. Games =GameKing/GameKing II games= The console has a small selection of known games (38), being 3 built in and 35 in carts, although 37 games were said to be available by TimeTop. Most games are clones of famous NES, C64 or Atari 2600 titles, with heavily dropped graphics. The games come in cartridges resembling the original Game Boy ones, with a typical size of 128KB, although 4-in-1 cartridges are available, containing 4 normal GameKing games plus a selection menu, and have a maximum size of 512KB. Both the GameKing and GameKing II come with three built in games. * Drifter, a Wonder Boy/Adventure Island clone (Which seems to use music from Castlevania III) * 2003, a 1942 clone. * Miner or Mine Battle, a Bomberman clone (Which seems to use music taken from the now-defunct Flash game, Spybot: The Nightfall Incident) Here follows an incomplete list of known games. Please note that many GameKing games use the same program altering only graphics to create \\"new\\" games e.g. 2003 and 2004 are essentially the same game with minor differences. Also, many games have major inconsistencies between the box, manual and in-game title. E.g., Lanneret becomes Hawk in the game title, Feichuan becomes \\"Shenzhou Liuhao\\" in the game, or Carlo Adventure Legend becomes Caro in-game. * Carlo Adventure Legend, a Super Mario Bros. clone. * Soldier, a Contra / Gryzor clone. * Happy Killer and Happy Ball, both Lode Runner clones. * F1 2004, a Formula One racing game resembling Pole Position. * Super Motor, essentially like F1 2004 with motorcycles instead of cars. Notes: The two previous titles are the only motor or sports games available on the GameKing. * 2004, essentially the same game as the built in 2003. * Popper, essentially the same game as the built in Miner. * Hawk or Lanneret, a Choplifter clone. * Dino Adventure, essentially Carlo Adventure Legend with different graphics. * Duckman, a Darkwing Duck clone. * Ares, Feichuan are all classic arcade shooters, probably using the same engine as 2003 and 2004 with different graphics. * Penguin, an Antarctic Adventure/Tux Racer clone. * Street Hero, a Double Dragon clone. * Trojan Legend, a Mega Man clone. * Seatercel, a Tiger Heli clone. * Star Wars, a Macross-based clone, allowing the player to choose all three shapeshifting Fighter-Gerwalk-Battroid configurations. * Nagual, a Kung Fu Master clone. * Blaster, a Blaster Master clone, a platform game with a shooting vehicle. * Chaser, a marine defense game (clone unknown). * Star Ghazi or Star Chazi, a Star Force clone * HERO: a Batman or H.E.R.O. clone. * Dracula Zone or Surf Eidolon: A Silver Surfer clone(?). * Pocket Tank, a Rambo/Front Line clone with a tank. * Warrior, a Front Line clone without the tank. * Clever Hawk, a Star Force-like game, but not the same game as Star Ghazi. * Valliant, a robot space fighting game (clone unknown).

Games are generally sold in separate cartridges, but there are 4-in-1 cartridges holding 4 distinct games. Later games seem to be only available in this manner. Also, each 4-in-1 pack comes numbered and higher numbers seem to provide games that are more refined in presentation. Some of these games found in 4-in-1 cartridges are: * Cyclon Action * Might * CarMan * Spectask * Captain (Which seems to use music from Mega Man X) * Seaguard * Whirlybird * Happy Garden * Airhero * Magician * Explorer * Farer * Seabedwar * Sortie * Phantom Fighter =GameKing III games= GameKing III machines have a built-in game: * Galaxy Crisis At the moment the only known game carts for the GameKing III are: * Adventure * Urgent Action * Diamond * Panzer * Fly Car * Blaze Plane * 2030 * Hermic Battle * Vagrant =HandyGame (GM-228) games= The NES-clone version of the GameKing III has its own selection of games, most of them being pirated or unlicensed NES games or variations. These come multi-carts with combinations such as 26in1, 49in1,and 72in1, etc. No HandyGame carts are compatible with any previous model.

Faenza (, , ; or ; ) is an Italian city and comune in the province of Ravenna, Emilia-Romagna, situated southeast of Bologna. Faenza is home to a historical manufacture of majolica-ware glazed earthenware pottery, known from the French name of the town as faience. Geography Faenza, at the foot of the first Subapennine hills, is surrounded by an agricultural region including vineyards in the hills, and cultivated land with traces of the ancient Roman land-division system, and fertile market gardens in the plains. In the nearby green valleys of the rivers Samoggia and Lamone there are great number of 18th and 19th century stately homes, set in extensive grounds or preceded by long cypress-lined driveways. History According to mythology, the name of the first settlement, Faoentia, had Etruscan and Celtic roots, meaning in Latin \\"Splendeo inter deos\\" or \\"I shine among the gods,\\" in modern English. The very name, coming from the Romans who developed this center under the name of Faventia, has become synonymous with ceramics (majolica) in various languages, including French (fa√Øence) and English (faience). Here Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius defeated populares army of Gnaeus Papirius Carbo in 82 BC. From the second half of the 1st century AD the city flourished considerably as a result of its agricultural propensities and the development of industrial activities such as the production of everyday pottery and brickwork objects and linen textiles. Here Totila and an Ostrogothic army defeated the Byzantine army in Italy in the Battle of Faventia in 542 CE. After a period of decadence from the 2nd century to the early Middle Ages it regained prosperity from the 8th century on. Around the year 1000 with the government of the Bishops and subsequently in the age of the Comune the city began a long period of richness and building expansion which reached its peak with the rule of the Manfredi family. The first consuls were elected in 1141 and in 1155 a podest√† was in charge of government of the city. In the wars between Guelphs and Ghibellines that began in the following years Faenza was at first loyal to the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1178, however, it changed side and entered the Lombard League. The inner disputes anyway favoured acquisition of power by Maghinardo Pagano, who remained podest√† and capitano del popolo for several years. At the beginning of the 14th century the Guelph Manfredi began a rule over Faenza that was to last for almost two centuries. The peak of splendour was reached under Carlo II Manfredi, in the second half of the century, when the city centre was renewed. In 1488 Galeotto Manfredi was assassinated by his wife: his son Astorre III succeeded him, but was in turn killed in Rome as a prisoner of Cesare Borgia, who had captured Faenza in 1501. After a brief period of Venetian domination Faenza became part of the Papal States until 1797. Faenza lost 1,322 of its citizens during World War II. After months of bombings and a bloody battle was finally liberated by the New Zealand Army (2nd New Zealand Division) on 17 December 1944. Main sights Faenza's architectural attractions are concentrated in the two contiguous main squares: Piazza del Popolo, lined by two double order porticoed wings, and Piazza della Libert√†. =Religious buildings= Faenza Cathedral: located along the east side of Piazza della Libert√†. Influenced by Tuscan style, it is one of the highest expressions of Renaissance art in Romagna. Built to Giuliano da Maiano's design, it was begun in 1474 and completed in 1511. The marble decoration of the fa√ßade remained unfinished. The interior, a nave and two aisles with obvious references to Brunelleschi's San Lorenzo in Florence, houses numerous works of Renaissance art, chiefly sculpture, among which are the tombs of St. Terence and St. Emilian (Tuscan school of the 15th century) and that of St. Savino, perhaps done in Florence by Benedetto da Maiano. * Sant'Antonio * San Bartolomeo * Santa Maria del Carmine * Church of the Commenda * Santa Maria ad Nives * Santa Maria dell‚ÄôAngelo =Secular buildings= Palazzo del Podest√† and the Town Hall, both of medieval origin, stand in Piazza del Popolo. The former was largely restored in the early 20th century while the latter ‚Äî radically transformed in the 18th century ‚Äî was the Palazzo of the Captain of the People and later the residence of the governing Manfredi family. * Goldsmiths' Portico opposite the Cathedral this open gallery and monumental fountain with bronzes were built in the first decade of the 17th century. * Clock Tower, in front of the entrance to the Piazza, is a postwar rebuilding of the 17th century tower that stood at the crossroad of the cardo and the decumanus gate of the Roman Faventia. Among the other monuments of the historic centre are Palazzo Milzetti, the richest and most significant Neoclassical building in the region, and the Teatro Masini (1780‚Äì1787). In the nearby, the Villa Case Grandi dei Ferniani has a collection of 18th and 19th century Faenza ceramics. =Natural sites= Grotta Tanaccia Karstic Park and the Carn√® Natural Park, a vast green area with a visitor‚Äôs centre and refreshments, are also of great interest, characterized by a typical landscape of dolinas, ravines and swallow holes. An example of Faenza Majolica in the so-called Garofano style. Majolica Faenza is home to the International Museum of Ceramics. The museum houses pieces from all over the world and from every epoch, from classical amphoras to the works of Chagall and Picasso, and there is a rich section dedicated to Faenza pottery in the golden age of the Renaissance. Other interesting art collections are located in the Municipal Art Gallery, the Diocese Museum, the Bendandi Museum and the Manfredi Library. The historic production of Faenza majolica is recognized worldwide as one of the highest moments of artistic creativity expressed through pottery. The tradition was born from a convergence of favourable conditions: a territory rich in clay, a centuries-old history of political and commercial relations with nearby Tuscany (especially with Florence). As a testament to the popularity of the city's majolica through the ages, on 18 August 2006, Quebec Premier Jean Charest announced that Canadian archaeologists had discovered the precise location of Canada's lost first colony of Charlesbourg- Royal,canada.com and that a fragment of a decorative Istoriato plate manufactured in Faenza between 1540 and 1550 was found there that could only have belonged to a member of the French aristocracy in the colony. Culture  In September and October international contemporary and classical ceramic art events draw majolica amateurs, collectors and artists to Faenza from all over the world. In June the Palio del Niballo, a tournament between five horsemen from the districts of the town, re-evokes the magnificence and struggles of Faenza in the Manfredi epoch. Faenza also houses the annual Mexi- talian Convention, in which Mexican and Italian food and drinks are served alike at the local market; this event usually occurs in May, as part of a Cinco de Mayo celebration. Typical regional dishes include home-made tagliatelle, cappelletti, lasagna and strozzapreti with the Romagna meat sauce. Two of the best restaurants in Faenza are Spaghetti Notte and Casa Spadoni. The Botanical Gardens, next to the Civic Natural Science Museum with its collections, houses more than 170 species of plants indigenous to Romagna. There is about of public urban green area. The Bucci Park, created in 1968, has an area of about of undulating land, green meadows and fish-rich waters, with species of birds including wild duck, storks and swans. Sport The Florence-Faenza marathon, a demanding long-distance race held during the last weekend in May, attracts athletes of all nationalities. Faenza is home to the Formula One racing team Scuderia AlphaTauri, formerly Scuderia Toro Rosso, formerly Minardi. Minardi was one of the last small, independent constructors in Formula One, and was bought by Red Bull in 2005, continuing to be based in Faenza. In the city there is also the Gresini Racing born in 1997 by Fausto Gresini, former 125cc world champion. The team has won 4 world championship: one in 250cc with Daijiro Kato, one in Moto 2 with Toni El√≠as, one in Moto 3 with Jorge Mart√≠n and the last one with Matteo Ferrari in MotoE. Faenza has been host to a Grand Prix of Motocross World Championship numerous times, the last one in 2020. The track is the Monte Coralli Circuit, located 8km from the city center. Transportation Faenza railway station, at Piazza Cesare Battisti, forms part of the Bologna‚ÄìAncona railway. It is also a terminus of two secondary railways, linking Faenza with Ravenna and Florence, respectively. Opened in 1893, it replaced an earlier station, which had been opened in 1861 at a location to the east of the present station, near what is now Via Caldesi.

Neoshamanism comprises an eclectic range of beliefs and practices that involve attempts to attain altered states and communicate with a spirit world. Neoshamanic systems may not resemble traditional forms of shamanism. Some have been invented by individual practitioners, though many borrow or gain inspiration from a variety of different indigenous cultures. In particular, indigenous cultures of the Americas have been influential. The word \\"shaman\\" originates from the Evenki word \\"≈°am√°n\\". The Tungusic term was subsequently adopted by Russians interacting with the indigenous peoples of Siberia, and then applied very broadly by western anthropologists to many, diverse spiritual systems that share some kind of practice of calling upon, and mediating with, spirit beings. Neoshamanism is not a single, cohesive belief system, but a collective term for many philosophies and activities. However, certain generalities may be drawn between adherents. Most believe in spirits and pursue contact with the \\"spirit-world\\" in altered states of consciousness which they achieve through drumming, dance, or the use of entheogens. Most systems might be described as existing somewhere on the animism/pantheism spectrum. Some neoshamans were not trained by any traditional shaman or member of any American indigenous culture, but rather learn independently from books and experimentation. Many attend New Age workshops and retreats, where they study a wide variety of ideas and techniques, both new and old. Some members of traditional, indigenous cultures and religions are critical of neoshamanism, asserting that it represents an illegitimate form of cultural appropriation, or that it is nothing more than a ruse by fraudulent spiritual leaders to disguise or lend legitimacy to fabricated, ignorant, and/or unsafe elements in their ceremonies. According to York (2001) one difference between neoshamanism and traditional shamanism is the role of fear.Shaman on the Stage (Shamanism and Northern Identity) by Tatyana Bulgakova Neoshamanism and its New Age relations tend to dismiss the existence of evil, fear, and failure. \\"In traditional shamanism, the shaman‚Äôs initiation is an ordeal involving pain, hardship and terror. New Age, by contrast is a religious perspective that denies the ultimately [sic] reality of the negative, and this would devalue the role of fear as well.\\" The 2011 United Kingdom census made it possible to write in a description of one's own choosing for \\"Religion\\". The figures for England and Wales show that from just over 80,000 people self-identifying as Pagan, 650 wrote in the description \\"Shamanism\\".Office for National Statistics, 11 December 2012, 2011 Census, Key Statistics for Local Authorities in England and Wales. Accessed 12 December 2012. Core Shamanism \\"Core Shamanism\\", which formed the foundations for most contemporary neoshamanism, is a system of practices synthesized, invented and promoted by Michael Harner in the 1980s, based on his reading of anthropological texts about indigenous peoples in the Americas, primarily the Plains Indians. Harner, who was not himself indigenous to the Americas, asserted that the ways of several North American tribes share \\"core\\" elements with those of the Siberian shamans. Many non-Native American readers believe that Harner's ideas were representative of actual traditional indigenous ceremonies, when they were not actually very accurate according to subsequent critics. Some members of these tribes assert that Harner's ideas or representations were not in any way accurate, nor do they call their spiritual leaders \\"shamans\\". Harner professes to describe common elements of \\"shamanic\\" practice found among indigenous people world-wide, having stripped those elements of specific cultural content so as to render them \\"accessible\\" to contemporary Western spiritual seekers. Harner also founded the Foundation for Shamanic Studies which claims to aid indigenous people preserve or even re- discover their own spiritual knowledge. Core shamanism does not hold a fixed belief system, but instead focuses on the practice of \\"shamanic journeying\\" and may also rely on the novels of Carlos Castaneda. Specific practices include the use of rapid drumming in an attempt to attain \\"the shamanic state of consciousness\\", ritual dance, and attempted communication with animal tutelary spirits, called \\"power animals\\" by Harner.\\"Harner, The Way of the Shaman, pp. 57-72, 76-103 =Power animals= \\"Power animal\\" is a concept that was introduced in 1980 by Michael Harner in The Way of the Shaman. While Harner took inspiration from his study of animistic beliefs in many different cultures, his concept of power animals is much like the familiar spirits of European occultism, which aid the occultist in their metaphysical work. The use of this term has been incorporated into the New Age movement, where it is often mistaken for being the same as a totem in some indigenous cultures. The concept has also entered popular culture in various forms, such as in the 1999 film (and earlier novel) Fight Club, when the narrator attends a cancer support group. During a creative visualization exercise, he is told to see himself entering a cave where he will meet his power animal. When he does, he imagines a penguin is speaking to him. =Controversy with Core Shamanism= Critics Daniel C. Noel and Robert J. Wallis see Harner's teachings as based on cultural appropriation and a misrepresentation of the various cultures by which he claims to have been inspired. Geary Hobson sees the New Age use of the term \\"shamanism\\" as a cultural appropriation of Native American culture by white people who have distanced themselves from their own history. Critics such as Noel and Wallis believe Harner's work, in particular, laid the foundations for massive exploitation of indigenous cultures by \\"plastic shamans\\" and other cultural appropriators. Note, however, that Noel does believe in \\"authentic western shamanism\\" as an alternative to neoshamanism.

The CPIB has the mandate to investigate into any acts or forms of corruption in the public and private sectors in Singapore, and in the course of doing so, any other offences under any written law. The CPIB was established by in 1952 and placed under the purview of the Attorney-General at the time. Having also been under the Ministry of Home Affairs in its earlier years, the Bureau has remained under the purview of the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office since 1969. The CPIB operates with functional independence, and is headed by a director who reports directly to the Prime Minister. The CPIB may also, in the course of its investigations, come across cases which reveal corruption-prone areas or loopholes in procedures in government departments. Based on its findings, CPIB may review the department concerned and recommend changes in their procedures. In addition to its primary function of investigating corruption offences, the CPIB also undertakes public education and community outreach efforts relating to anti-corruption. Legal framework Enacted on 17 June 1960, the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) is the primary anti-corruption law in Singapore. The following are provided for under the PCA: * Powers for the CPIB to investigate bribery in all forms, both monetary and non-monetary in nature, and in both the public and private sectors; * Extra-territorial powers for the CPIB to deal with corrupt acts committed by a Singapore citizen outside Singapore as though these were committed in Singapore; * Fine of up to S$100,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding 5 years, or to both, for each count of corruption; * Fine of up to S$100,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding 7 years, or to both, for each count of corruption in relation to a contract or a proposal for a contract with the Government; * Presumption where any gratification given or received by a person in the employment of the Government or of a public body is deemed corrupt, and the burden of proof to rebut the presumption lies with the person; * Forfeiture of gratification received in the form of a penalty equivalent to the amount of bribes received upon conviction; and * Non- disclosure of the name or address of any informer, or any matter which might lead to the discovery of the informer‚Äôs identity.

Biography F√©licien David was born in Cadenet, and began to study music at the age of five under his father, whose death when the boy was six left him an impoverished orphan. His good voice enabled him to study as a choirboy at the Church of Saint-Sauveur in Aix-en-Provence, which he left at the age of 15 with a sound knowledge of music, and a scholarship which enabled him to study literature at a Jesuit college. However, after three years, he abandoned these studies to pursue a musical career. He first obtained a position in the orchestra of the theatre at Aix. In 1829, he became ma√Ætre de chapelle at Saint-Sauveur, but realised that to complete his musical education he needed to study at Paris. An allowance of 50 francs per month from a rich uncle made this possible. F√©licien David in 1858 In Paris in 1830 he convinced Luigi Cherubini, the director of the Conservatoire, to enroll him as a pupil: despite his reservations, Cherubini recognised the talent shown by David's choral setting of Beatus vir. Despite the sudden withdrawal of his uncle's subsidy, David's studies, with F√©tis and others, continued successfully. On leaving the Conservatoire, David was caught up in the Saint- Simonian movement, for which he became a great enthusiast. The Saint-Simonians held music to be an important art, and David wrote much music for them, including a number of hymns. After the suppression of the movement in 1832, David joined with a number of adepts who visited the Middle East. This also proved a source of strong inspiration, leading eventually to his greatest success, the symphonic ode Le d√©sert of 1844. Returning to Paris in 1833, he wrote a number of romances, and instrumental music including three symphonies (in F major, E major and C minor, composed in 1837, 1838 and 1849);Cf. the content to this effect on [musicologie.org Musicologie.org]. by 1838/39 he was successful enough to be able to arrange public performances of his works. With Le d√©sert he was acknowledged by the public and the critics as a significant force. The Revue et gazette musicale announced, the morning after its premiere, \\"A great composer has been born amongst us\\". To relieve his substantial debts, however, the composer sold the rights to his masterpiece for a relatively small sum. David in a Brazilian setting (a reference to his 1851 op√©ra comique, La perle du Br√©sil) surrounded by comic allusions to several of his major works, from an undated theatrical illustration (ca. 1860).David wrote a number of operas, of which the most notable are Christophe Colomb (1847), La perle du Br√©sil (1851), Herculanum (1859), and Lalla-Roukh (1862).

The Bussell family were a family of early settlers in colonial Western Australia. The four brothers John, Joseph, Alfred and Charles emigrated from England on the Warrior, arriving at Fremantle on 12 March 1830. Lennox, Frances and Elizabeth arrived at Fremantle on the Cygnet on 27 January 1833, and Mrs Frances Louisa and Mary arrived at Albany on 19 June 1834.Bussell Diaries, State Library of Western Australia, 25 January 2011, accessed 3 August 2019. On arriving in Western Australia, the Bussells found that all of the good farm land around Perth and Fremantle had already been granted, and were advised by the Governor, Sir James Stirling, to form a sub-colony in the vicinity of Cape Leeuwin. The Bussells first settled in the Augusta area in May 1830, but met with little success. After a number of exploring expeditions, John Bussell discovered good farm land in Busselton in December 1831, and by 1834 the family had established a property named \\"Cattle Chosen\\". The town of Busselton, surveyed in 1837, along with the Bussell Highway, are named in their honour. Many of the Bussells were prolific letter-writers, and much of their correspondence has been preserved. These letters provide an outstanding record of the lives of a class of settler that were largely neglected by contemporary historians and record-keepers. Consequently, they have been much studied by modern historians. On 14 August 2007, The West Australian Newspaper reported that the J S Battye Library had paid a possible WA record $91,000 at auction for the personal diaries of Vernon Bussell.Taylor, Robert.

He is the founder of the Antiquarische Gesellschaft in Z√ºrich (Antiquarian Society in Zurich). Biography He was born at Marthalen. He studied theology and natural sciences at Zurich, Lausanne, and Paris. In 1831 he was made an instructor at Zurich, and secretary of the Society for Natural Research, and in this capacity he published various works on naked rock soil and vent holes. The discovery of the sepulchral mound at Burgh√∂lzli led to the founding of the Antiquarian Society of which Keller was the longtime president, and to the founding of a museum, the growth of which was largely due to him.

Fernando de Herrera (~1534‚Äì1597), called \\"El Divino\\", was a 16th-century Spanish poet and man of letters. He was born in Seville. Much of what is known about him comes from Libro de descripci√≥n de verdaderos retratos de illustres y memorables varones (Book of the Description of the True Portraits of Illustrious and Memorable Men) (1599) by Francisco Pacheco. Biography Although Herrera's family was only moderately wealthy, they were highly esteemed in Seville. During Herrera's lifetime, Seville was a bustling port city from which many transatlantic voyages would embark, and trading took place with countries all over the world. This active atmosphere, however, was somewhat contradictory to Herrera's character. He therefore sought solace from the busy city life through his poetry. However, whereas spending much of his time in seclusion allowed him to concentrate on his work and artistic interests, it also brought him much criticism from others. The academic community, especially Rodrigo Caro and Juan Guti√©rrez Rufo, mocked him for his unorthodox ways. Although well-learned and knowledgeable ‚Äî Herrera was a great admirer of Italian poetry, the classics, and the Bible (all of which influenced his work) ‚Äî he was never known to have held any academic degree. He admired one Spanish poet in particular, Garcilaso de la Vega, whose style influenced his own poetry. Herrera did not just have an antiquarian interest in knowledge, however; he was interested in current events, especially those related to the military. Evidence of this is seen in his patriotic canciones (songs) in which he expresses feelings toward contemporary military leaders and actions. To accommodate his need for refuge, Herrera took minor orders in the Catholic Church Fernando de Herrera at New Advent Catholic Encyclopaedia. and received a benefice in San Andr√©s, a parish of Seville. However, though Herrera displayed a love for solitude, he was no hermit. Around 1559, he struck up a friendship with Don √Ålvaro Col√≥n y Portugal, Count of Gelves, and his wife, Do√±a Leonor de Mil√°n de C√≥rdoba y Arag√≥n. Herrera was frequently invited by the count to attend his tertulia (literary salon), a meeting of an elite literary circle where he would form many friendships with local poets, men of letters, painters, and artists. It was his relationship with Do√±a Leonor that provided Herrera with his muse. Herrera's love for Do√±a Leonor inspired his love poems. However, they were never enough to provoke the same feelings in her. After the death of Leonor in 1581, Herrera lost his desire to write further love poetry. In addition, the death of the count in 1582 ended his attendance at the disbanded literary tertulia at the palace. Henceforth, Herrera devoted himself to two major projects: a history of the world up to the death of Charles V and a biography of Thomas More. The writer continued to work up to his death in 1597 at the age of 63. Works =Poetry= Herrera's meticulous study and eventual mastery of poetic discourse earned him the name \\"el Divino\\" (\\"the divine one\\"), a name given him by Miguel de Cervantes, author of Don Quixote. In addition, his knowledge of poetic topics helped him to become one of the leaders of the school of poets to which Herrera belonged in Seville. The works of Herrera cover a wide range of subjects, representing his large span of knowledge and interests. Herrera's military poetry (his canciones, or songs), for example, are accounts of contemporary military leaders and events in which Herrera demonstrates his patriotism, loyalty to the Christian faith, and respect for great leaders. Three poems concerning this theme include Canci√≥n por la Victoria del Se√±or don Juan (Ode to the Victory of Don Juan), written in 1572, where patriotism is displayed in praising the work done by the Spanish navy at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571; Canci√≥n al se√±or don Juan de Austria vencedor de los moriscos en las Alpujarras (Ode to Don Juan de Austria, Conqueror of the Moors in the Alpujarras), written in 1571, where Herrera celebrates a leader who stopped a Muslim revolt between 1568 and 1571; and Canci√≥n por la p√©rdida del Rei don Sebasti√°n (Ode to the Defeat of King Sebastian), written in 1579, where the poet commemorates the death of a Portuguese king. Herrera's love poetry inspired by his muse, the Countess of Gelves, can be divided into two periods. The first, \\"Rimas Juventiles\\" (Youthful Rhymes), is defined by Herrera's description of love as a blissful state, in which there is neither pain nor suffering; in this state, even the impossible can happen. In the second period, love escapes reality and lives in a world of fantasy and perfection. To this period belongs the \\"Poes√≠as\\" (Poems), a body of poetry, published in successive editions. A third major area of Herrera‚Äôs work, and one for which he is best known, is related to Garcilaso de la Vega, the Spanish poet and author whom Herrera held in the highest esteem. One of Herrera's most famous works, Obras de Garci Lasso con anotaciones de Fernando de Herrera al ilustrissimo i ecelentissimo Se√±or don Antonio de Guzman, Marques de Ayamonte, Governador del Estado de Milan, i Capitan General de Italia (Works of Gracilaso de la Vega with Comments by Fernando de Herrera to the Most Illustrious and Excellent Don Antonio de Guzman, Marques of Ayamonte, Governor of the State of Milan, and Captain General of Italy), written in 1580, displays not only Herrera's admiration for Garcilaso's poetry but also his mastery of the intricate details of said poet's rhythm, choice and order of words, coherency, meter, and the effects they have on the poem as a whole. It is this knowledge which drove Herrera to devote such meticulous attention to his own work. =Other works= Other examples of Herrera's work include the translation of Latin and Italian works into Castilian, a biography of Thomas More, and a history of the world. Some of his most well-known works are: * Relacion de la guerra de Chipre y sucesso de la batalla Naual de Lepanto Escrito por Fernando de Herrera, dirigido al ilustrissimo y excelentissimo d√µ Al√µso Perez de Guzman el Bueno, Duque de Medina Sidonia y Conde de Niebla.

F. R. Chesney was born there, on 16 March 1789. Lord Rawdon gave the boy a cadetship at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and he was gazetted to the Royal Artillery in 1805. But though he rose to be lieutenant-general and colonel-commandant of the 14th brigade Royal Artillery (1864), and general in 1868, Chesney's memory lives not for his military record, but for his connection with the Suez Canal, and with the exploration of the Euphrates valley, which started with his being sent out to Constantinople in the course of his military duties in 1829, and his making a tour of inspection in Egypt and Syria. In 1830, after taking command of 7th Company, 4th Battalion Royal Artillery in Malta, he submitted a report on the feasibility of making a Suez Canal. This was the original basis of Lesseps‚Äô great undertaking (in 1869 Lesseps greeted him in Paris as the ‚Äúfather ‚Äú of the canal). However, before the creation of the Suez Canal, Chesney wanted to test an alternative route to India. He reached Istanbul in April 1832 and concluded in his report that the Euphrates should be traversable for suitable steamers.Chesney‚Äôs survey of northern Syria, entitled Additional Memoir on the Euphrates and dated 11 May 1832, was addressed to Sir Stratford Canning and was printed in Parliamentary Papers, 1834 No. 478, Appendix, pp. 93-8 For the next three years, Chesney undertook a campaign in order to persuade the government to accept a trial experiment of the Euphrates route.Guest, 1992, p. 35 After lengthy reports and meetings, the British government finally accepted in early 1835 to send two iron-hulled steamboats, the Euphrates and the Tigris, to survey the long stretch of the river Euphrates from the Anatolian mountains to the Persian Gulf.Guest, 1992, p. 8 The objective of the party was twofold; firstly, to set up a new trade route between Britain and India which avoided the lengthy voyage around the South African Cape of Good Hope. Secondly, it aimed to prevent Russian expansion in the Near East, as some understood it as a threat to Britain‚Äôs control of India. In 1835, Captain Francis Rawdon Chesney was put in charge of the expedition and carefully selected his associates, about fifty persons in total and for which Parliament voted ¬£20,000, in order to test the navigability of the Euphrates.  The Euphrates Expedition  During the Euphrates expedition, two steamers, Tigris and Euphrates, got caught in a violent hurricane and the former was sunk with the loss of many lives. This drawing represents the last moment it was seen from onboard of the Euphrates. The expedition arrived in Malta on 12 March 1835 on the Georges Canning and left on the 21 March 1835 in order to transport all the materials and construct both iron steamers in the Bay of Antioch.Guest, 1992, p. 49 It took a little over a year to render the steamers into floating shape so ‚Äúas to put the expedition in motion‚Äù.Chesney, 1868, p. 352. The 16 March 1836, Chesney‚Äôs forty-seventh birthday, was picked as the date of the first trial voyage for the Euphrates.Guest, 1992, p. 76 After the habitual morning service, the king‚Äôs commission was recited, listing the purpose of the expedition and praising ‚Äúhis dear and powerful ally‚Äù, the Sultan. Indeed, good relations with the Arabs were essential for a successful descent of the Euphrates. They were also crucial to the preservation of a fixed service along the river that might make Russia hesitate before invading Iraq.Guest, 1992, p. 62 As the Euphrates commenced her voyage, William Francis Ainsworth, the appointed surgeon and geologist of the expedition, mused that ‚Äúthe scream of the startled pelican or the gurgle of some large siluroid wallowing in the waters, was no longer necessary to break the silent ripple‚Äù. At their first point of anchorage in Beles, they undertook trials of the two vessels under controlled conditions with and against the current. The Tigris trials were disappointing but the Euphrates ones were very satisfactory.Guest, 1992, p. 81 The expedition‚Äôs progress was overall leisurely and stops were made in several cities along the way for wood, fuel as well as historical research. On Saturday 21 May the expedition left the town of Saliggye and Chesney remembered later that the weather that morning was ‚Äúvery fine and promising‚Äù. But a few minutes later, black clouds in the sky presaged an approaching storm. Indeed, the vessels were caught by a terrible hurricane. In his personal narrative of the events, Ainsworth recorded that ‚Äúa warm dry wind, laden with the fragrance of the aromatic plants of the wilderness, followed in a few instants by a tremendous blast of wind, with some rain in large drops‚Äù. After twelve minutes, the storm abated and the Tigris was nowhere to be seen. The following three days were spent in vain searching for more survivors and trying to locate the sunken vessel.Guest, 1992, p. 82. By that time, Chesney had to disclose to his crew that he had been given orders to break up the expedition by the end of July.Chesney, 1868, p. 248. However, he trusted that the wreck of the Tigris had changed their circumstances, and believed that the government would not stand to lose their prestigious reputation by cancelling a major British project after one steamer had been inadvertently lost.Chesney, 1868, p. 260. Therefore, the party collectively chose to continue the descent of the river aboard Euphrates and reduce expenses by sending the survivors of the wreck back home.Guest, 1992, p. 91 Euphrates then anchored at the small city of Ana, where they repaired and refuelled the steamer as well as wrote reports regarding the previous unfortunate events.Chesney, 1868, p. 261. Numerous episodes of ‚Äúcomic melodrama‚ÄùGuest, 1992, p. 97 then unfurled during their ensuing descent of the river. For instance, on the 31 May 1836, the day Euphrates left Ana, Chesney left Ainsworth on the bank of the river during a momentary loss of memory. Ainsworth finally made his way to the vessel after having walked more than fifty miles for over two days.Ainsworth, 1888, p. 430. Another episode unfolded when Euphrates arrived at New Lemlum on the 13 June 1836 and the steamer was compelled to secure itself close to town. Soon after, the ship was encircled by half-naked native of the Khezail tribe. Ainsworth recorded that ‚Äúthe unusual sinewy length and thinness of their limbs, a peculiarity of development which, as seen on a smaller scale in the shrimp girls of Boulogne, we could not but attribute to their living in a marsh‚Äù.Ainsworth, 1888, vol. 2, p. 42 Following these events, Chesney noted that the descent and survey of approximately 1200 miles of the Euphrates river had been completed by June 18, 1836. The River Karun and Bah-a-Mishir were then examined throughout September 1836.Chesney, 1868, p. 352 This constituted the final step of the expedition, that is, the ascent of the river Tigris to Bagdad. However, as the steamer crossed the twisting river of the Lemlum marshes, the canal narrowed and, on 24 October, Estcourt wrote that ‚Äúwe have now this moment anchored at a narrow winding, past which we cannot get‚Äù.Papers of General J.B. Estcourt, Gloucestershire Records Office (D 1571). Estcourt to Father, 22 October 1836. p. 128 Since there were no new orders from India or England, Chesney was forced to make a decision about what to do with the expedition during the remaining ten weeks until the scheduled end of the mission, on 31 January 1837.Guest, 1992, p. 133. The captain decided to go to Bombay himself aboard the steamer on 1 December 1836,Chesney, 1868, p. 352. leaving Estcourt in charge with instructions to further examine the Karun and the Tigris.Parliamentary Papers. 1837.

The Expedition was finally broken up by Major Estcourt, to the orders of the President of the Board of control, at Bagdad, January 25, 1837,Guest, 1992, p. 137 and Chesney returned to England in 1837. According to the Captain, the expedition proved the practicability of the Euphrates route to India.Chesney, 1868, Preface, p. 9  Life after the Expedition  Official Narrative of the Euphrates Expedition by Captain Francis Rawdon Chesney. Upon his return to England, Chesney was given the Royal Geographical Society‚Äôs gold medal, having meanwhile been to India to consult the authorities there. He was later assigned the task of writing the official account of the expedition with a grant of ¬£1,500 by the Treasury and smaller sums by the East India Company.Guest, 1992, p. 150 Chesney, ranked to Major, found it very difficult to pick up his career as he had returned to England under ‚Äúa cloud of official displeasure‚Äù. He devoted much time to pushing for the establishment of a line of communication with India through Turkish Arabia as he believed that the information obtained through his expedition, that is, rapidity of transit and commercial advantages ‚Äúrequire no exemplification‚Äù.Chesney, 1868, p. 354 However, the preparation of his two volumes on the expedition (published in 1850) was interrupted by his being ordered out in 1843 to command the artillery at Hong Kong. In 1847, his period of service was completed, and he went home to Ireland, to a life of retirement; but both in 1856 and again in 1862 he went out to the East to take a part in further surveys and negotiations for the Euphrates valley railway scheme, which, however, the government would not take up, in spite of a favourable report from the House of Commons committee in 1871. In 1868 he published a further volume of narrative on his Euphrates expedition. He died on January 30, 1872. PublicationsReports on the Navigation of the Euphrates.

The design was drawn up by the Italian engineer Battista Antonelli; originally under the control of Spain, the fortress was captured by the British in 1762, and was returned to the Spanish under treaty terms a year later. The Morro fortress in Havana shares its name with structures in Santiago de Cuba and the Castillo de San Felipe del Morro in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In this case, the Spanish \\"morro\\" means a rock which is very visible from the sea and therefore serves as a navigational landmark. Perched on the promontory on the opposite side of the harbor from Old Havana, it can be viewed from miles around as it dominates the port entrance. Built initially in 1589 in response to raids on Havana harbor, el Morro protected the mouth of the harbor with a chain being strung out across the water to the fort at La Punta. Seven Years War Morro Castle before the British attack, 30 July 1762 by Dominic Serres It first saw action in 1762, while under the command of Luis Vicente de Velasco e Isla. The British expedition against Cuba under Lord Albemarle landed in Cojimar to the east of Havana and attacked the fortress from its landward side. The fort fell when the British successfully mined one of its bastions. When the British handed the island back in 1763 to Spain, the fortress at La Caba√±a was built to prevent this from happening again. Exhibition Inside the gates is an exhibition on the lighthouses of Cuba ‚Äì El Morro once housed a school for lighthouse keepers. There was actually a watchtower here until the British blew it up during their successful siege in 1762. The Faro Castillo del Morro lighthouse was added in 1846. The cannons around the fort are now badly rusted, but the walls are well preserved. The fort has central barracks up to four stories high. A small underwater archeology exhibition is also located here. Noteworthy are the old latrines and their chute into the sea, as are the two sets of doors and the drawbridge mechanism. The current harbor master's office is still housed in the fortress. A plaque dedicated by the ambassador of the United Kingdom commemorates the 1762 siege, and a small memorial is located between two strong powder rooms in the northeast bastion. A small turret at the end of the wall offers views of the sea crashing onto the rocks 20 meters below, and of the huge dry moat. The opposite side of the moat holds more modern guns and cannons, La Bateria de Velasco, and offers a sweeping view down to Cojimar. El ca√±onazo de las 9 The complex is now part of a historical park, along with the El Morro fortress, and houses several museums open to the public. Every night a cannon is fired at 9pm, the so-called \\"El Ca√±onazo de las 9\\" is a leftover custom kept from colonial times signaling the closure of the city gates. Appearances in culture =Art= Morro Castle can be seen in the background of John Singleton Copley's oil painting Watson and the Shark (1778). =Film= Morro Castle appears in the movie The Ghost Breakers (1940), in the background as Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard enter the harbor by ship. The climactic scenes from The Big Boodle (1957) starring Errol Flynn were shot at Morro Castle in pre-Castro Cuba. During his life, the Castro regime imprisoned the Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas (1943-1990) at El Morro Castle for criticism of the government. The film version of Arenas's autobiography, Before Night Falls (2000), starring Javier Bardem, features scenes set in El Morro Castle prison.

Many of the publication's writers and editors were associated with other publications such as Boing Boing, Mondo 2000, Whole Earth Review, and Wired. The last issue of the magazine was #14, published in 1998. The magazine had an international circulation, distributed primarily by Fine Print, an Austin-based company that focused on 'zine distribution. History FringeWare Review was established in 1994. The publication was co- founded by Jon Lebkowsky and Paco Nathan, with art director Monte McCarter and assistant editor Tiffany Lee Brown. The magazine's parent company, FringeWare, Inc., was the first company built on Internet community (the FringeWare email list, later referred to as the FringeWare News Network), and probably the first to use web technology when it appeared. FringeWare also had presences on The WELL and on Illuminati Online's Metaverse, which was conceived as a commercial multiuser object-oriented environment (MOO). Fringe Ware quickly built an international reputation through the Internet and the magazine. As online communities and the Internet spread in popularity during the 1990s, Fringe Ware became known as an early forebear to online commerce sites such as Amazon_company and to magazines such as Wired, which named Fringe Ware Review in its Top 10 List. The company also owned an independent bookstore in Austin, Texas, that was an underground culture-hub for the city of Austin. Many performances and events were held at the bookstore, for example the first US performance of Austrian art pranksters monochrom in 1998. FringeWare was one of many independent businesses to disappear from Austin during the late 1990s. Lebkowsky and Nathan, who met as Austin-based associate editors of the print version of bOING bOING, originally conceived the company as a way to bring micro producers of cool software and gadgets to market via ecommerce. They began with an email list, which had high adoption among an international set of technoculture mavens and Internet early adopters, and later became known as the FringeWare News Network. Nathan built a web site in 1992, creating an early custom content management system and online catalog of products. This would have become the first instance of ecommerce on the Internet, however credit card companies pre-SSL prohibited online sales, so the alternative was mail-order, and this required a print catalog. While hashing out plans for a FringeWare catalog, the two decided to create a magazine, inspired by Boing Boing and Whole Earth Review/Coevolution Quarterly, with a catalog in the back pages.

Francisco Herrera (1576‚Äì1656) was a distinguished Spanish painter, born in Seville. He was the founder of the Seville school.  Biography  Francisco Herrera was born in Seville in 1576. Francisco Pacheco was his teacher, but Herrera soon broke away from the timid style and Italian traditions of Spanish painting of his day, and became the pioneer of that bold, vigorous, effective, and natural style whose preeminent exponent was Vel√°zquez. Herrera was the first to use long brushes, which may, in part, account for his \\"modern\\" technique and dexterous brushwork. Many authorities ascribe to him the foundation of the Spanish School. His great talent brought him many pupils, whom his passionate temper and rough manners soon drove away. Vel√°zquez, when thirteen years old, was placed under this great professor, and remained a year with him. Herrera, who was an accomplished worker in bronze, engraved medals skilfully. This gave rise to the charge of counterfeiting, and he fled for sanctuary to the Jesuit College, for which he painted \\"The Triumph of St. Hermengild\\", a picture so impressive that when Philip IV saw it (1621) he immediately pardoned the painter. Herrera thereupon returned to Seville. His ungoverned temper soon drove his son to Rome and his daughter to a nunnery. Herrera's pictures are full of energy, the drawing is good and the colouring so cleverly managed that the figures stand out in splendid relief. Many of his small easel pictures, in oil, represent fairs, dances, interiors of inns, and deal with the intimate life of Spain. His large works are nearly all religious. In Seville he painted a \\"St. Peter\\" for the cathedral and a \\"Last Judgment\\" for the Church of San Bernardo, the latter being considered his masterpiece. After executing many commissions in his native town he removed to Madrid (1650), where he won great renown. In the archiepiscopal palace are four large canvases, one of which, \\"Moses Smiting the Rock\\", is celebrated for its dramatic qualities and daring technique. In the cloister of the Merced Calzada is a noteworthy series of paintings whose subjects are drawn from the life of St. Ramon. He painted much in fresco, in which medium his best effort is believed to have been on the vault of San Bonaventura, but this, with all his other frescoes, has disappeared. None of his architectural productions are mentioned, and there remain but a few of his etchings, all of which were reproductions of his paintings. One of his pictures, \\"St. Basil dictating his doctrine\\", is in the Louvre, and another, \\"St. Matthew\\", is in the Dresden Gallery. Herrera left two sons, \\"el Rubio\\" (the ruddy) who died before he fulfilled the great promise of his youth, and \\"el Mozo\\" (the younger). Works Herrera's finest paintings include \\"The Last Judgment\\" and a \\"Holy Family,\\" both in churches at Seville. Others are in the Louvre, Paris.

History The text survives as Greek, Latin, and Old Church Slavonic manuscripts, although each copy varies from the others considerably in the wording chosen. It is of similar style to the Apocalypse of St. John the Divine, although sensational instead of seeking to frighten. It is framed as a dialogue from Jesus to the apostles (it varies significantly as to at which stage in time between the manuscripts), instigated by a series of extremely daring and outrageous questions and requests by Bartholomew. The text appears to have been quite popular, judging by how well it survived, perhaps due to depictions of the supernatural. For example, the text implies that The Fall of Man was caused by Satan poisoning the water of Eden. The text draws heavily on Jewish mysticism (such as the Book of Enoch), seeking to provide an explanation of the more supernatural aspects of Christian thought at the time. However, rather than a more clinical treatment that would be expected for such a treatise, it approaches these topics in a tabloid manner, evidently seeking to be a popular work rather than one for official church teaching. Narrative Initially, the text describes how Jesus descended into hell in his own words, and then jumps to discussing the virginal conception when Mary arrives amongst the apostles. Next, the apostles ask for a vision of hell, and angels roll up the earth to let them, and then return the earth when they have glimpsed it. =Satan's Testimony= Finally, Bartholomew asks to see Satan, and so a choir of angels drags Beliar (a name for Satan) from the depths of hell in chains, the sight of which kills the apostles dead. Jesus immediately brings them back to life and gives Bartholomew control over Satan. Bartholomew asks Satan how he came to be the enemy and other questions on esoteric subjects such as the hierarchy of the angels. He also explains the story of his removal from heaven.The Gospel of Bartholomew From \\"The Apocryphal New Testament,\\" by M. R.

It is based on a novella by Vera Caspary.. An independent production distributed by Warner Bros., The Blue Gardenia - a cynical take on press coverage of a sensational murder case - was the first installment of Lang's \\"newspaper noir\\" movie trio, being followed in 1956 by both While the City Sleeps and Beyond a Reasonable Doubt. The song \\"Blue Gardenia\\" was written by Bob Russell and Lester Lee and arranged by Nelson Riddle. The director of cinematography for The Blue Gardenia was RKO regular Nicholas Musuraca, then working at Warner Brothers. Plot In Los Angeles, California, Norah Larkin (Anne Baxter) is a single woman who works as a switchboard operator along with her roommates, Crystal Carpenter (Ann Sothern) and Sally Ellis (Jeff Donnell). On her birthday, she decides to celebrate by dining alone at home, with the picture of her fianc√©, a soldier serving in the Korean War. At the candlelight dinner table, she opens the latest letter from him and learns to her shock that he instead plans to marry a nurse he met in Tokyo. Devastated, Norah accepts a date over the telephone with womanizing calendar girl artist Harry Prebble (Raymond Burr). When she arrives at the Blue Gardenia restaurant and nightclub, Harry is surprised to see Norah, since he was expecting Crystal. However, he has dinner with her, and encourages her to drink six strong Polynesian Pearl Diver cocktails. Harry then takes her to his apartment, where he shows her his pictures and plays the record \\"Blue Gardenia\\", sung by Nat King Cole, whom they had just seen perform the same song at the restaurant. Norah passes out on Harry's couch, and he makes a sexual advance. She awakens and resists, and apparently strikes him with a fire poker, shattering a mirror. Norah flees the scene, leaving behind her black suede pumps, and returns home. The next morning, Norah is awakened by Crystal; she has suffered a blackout as to the events of the previous night. Meanwhile, at the crime scene, police question a maid (Almira Sessions) about what she found before she discovered Harry's body. She admits to cleaning the poker, which would have removed any fingerprints, and placing the shoes in the closet, so valuable evidence has been compromised. At Norah's workplace, the police arrive to question women who had posed for Harry. When Norah asks her colleague about the questioning, she is startled and goes to read the Los Angeles Chronicle newspaper's account of the slaying. Norah has a vague flashback of the wielding of a fire poker and the shattering of a mirror. Newspaper columnist Casey Mayo (Richard Conte) dubs the presumed killer the \\"Blue Gardenia murderess.\\" He learns from the Blue Gardenia waiter that the woman was a blonde, and from a blind female flower seller (Celia Lovsky) that the woman possessed a \\"quiet voice\\". That same night, at her apartment, Sally reads the newspaper report that the suspect wore a black dress at the time of the murder. Frightened, Norah wraps her own black dress in a newspaper and burns it in an outdoor incinerator. A patrolman arrives and demands to know why she is burning materials at an illegal hour, but he lets her off with a warning after she apologizes. Wanting to catch the killer before the police do, Casey writes a column, titled \\"Letter to an Unknown Murderess\\", calling for her to turn herself in. Casey receives many bogus phone calls from local women, but when Norah calls, he realizes she is genuine. After one botched attempt, he meets her in his office. She convinces him that she is actually speaking for a friend, not herself, and Casey tells Norah that he is willing to pay for top legal representation if her friend agrees to surrender. The two later go to a diner, where Norah tells her supposed friend's account of the murder, but still insists her friend does not remember the actual killing. Casey asks to meet her friend at the diner the next day. Norah agrees and returns home, where she confesses to roommate Crystal, who is sympathetic. The next day at the diner, Crystal meets Casey and points him to Norah's booth, where Norah finally admits that she herself is the woman he has been looking for. He feels shocked, because he had begun to fall in love with her. He also feels guilty, admitting to Norah that he was only pretending sympathy for the alleged killer when he thought it was someone other than her. Shortly afterward, the police arrive and arrest Norah. Bitter and confused, she mistakenly believes that Casey is the one who turned her in. (It was actually a diner employee.) At an airport, Casey, with his colleague Al (Richard Erdman), notices that the piped-in music‚Äîthe love theme from Tristan und Isolde‚Äîis identical to the music the maid found playing on Harry's phonograph. Finally grasping the significance of the fact that the records on the machine had been changed, Casey realizes it's possible that Norah was not the killer. Following up this hunch, Casey and Police Captain Sam Haynes (George Reeves) go to a local music shop. Harry's ex-girlfriend Rose Miller (Ruth Storey) is working in the back room at the shop. The clerk tells the police that it was Rose who sold Harry the record, and calls to her to come out and help. Realizing the police are closing in, she attempts suicide. From a hospital bed, Rose confesses that while Norah was passed out at Harry's apartment, she herself arrived, demanding that he marry her. (Although she does not say that she is pregnant, the audience of that time would assume that that was the reason for her desperate demands.) He refused, she says, and started playing the record that had brought them together. (That record being Toscanini conducting Wagner's Tristan und Isolde.) Then, Rose recalls, she noticed Norah's handkerchief on the floor by the record player, and out of jealousy killed Harry with the poker. Norah, everyone finally understands, was simply an intoxicated and confused bystander. After Rose's confession, Norah is freed. She confides to friends that she has forgiven Casey and wants him as the new man in her life. Casey wants her as well, and tosses his \\"little black book\\" to his buddy Al.

Sam Haynes * Ruth Storey as Rose Miller * Ray Walker as Homer * Nat King Cole as Nat 'King' Cole Production The source novella for The Blue Gardenia was written by Vera Caspary and entitled The Gardenia: the eventual amendment of the film's title to The Blue Gardenia would be an attempt to attract filmgoers by reminding them of the highly-publicized unsolved Black Dahlia murder of 1947. The Gardenia first appeared in the February‚ÄìMarch issue of Today's Woman magazine: however the film rights for the novella had been acquired almost a full year earlier, it being announced in April 1951 that its filmation - purportedly entitled Gardenia - would be a production of the Howard Welsch-helmed Fidelity Pictures, who originally negotiated with Dorothy McGuire to play the female lead,Los Angeles Times 26 April 1951 \\"Old Soldiers May Link With 'Cavalry'; McGuire Deal on For 'Gardenia'\\" by Edwin Schallert p.II-7 which was subsequently offered to Linda Darnell, Joan Fontaine,Arizona Daily Star 17 December 1951 \\"Hollywood Today\\" by Sheilah Graham p.11 and Margaret Sullavan (had Sullavan played the film's female lead, [The Blue] Gardenia would have been her final movie rather than No Sad Songs for Me in 1950; Sullavan, who died in 1960, would have three television roles in the 1950s, one of them later than 1953).Akron Beacon Journal 14 May 1952 \\"Flimsy Films Fatal to Fanfare: so say Dean & Jerry after weak plot of 'Sailor Beware'\\" by Erskine Johnson p.12 In September 1952 the rights for Gardenia were sold to independent producer Alex Gottlieb with the film henceforth referred to as The Blue Gardenia: despite reports of the female lead role being assigned to DarnellPhiladelphia Inquirer 17 November 1952 \\"Monday Morning Gossip of the Nation\\" by Herb Stein p.21 and also to the little-known Vicky Lane,San Bernardino County Sun 9 December 1952 \\"Deanna Durbin Not Fooling Anyone With 'Retired' Status\\" by Erskine Johnson p.3 Anne Baxter was announced for the role in November - The Blue Gardenia being considered the second of Baxter's two-picture pact with Warner Bros. as that studio signed to distribute the film - with the film's two other top-billed stars announced the same month. Being cast as the film's second female lead would afford Ann Sothern her first cinematic role since being dropped by Metro Goldwyn Mayer in 1950 due to her health issues. Prior to filming The Blue Gardenia, Sothern had signed with CBS to star in the sitcom Private Secretary, filming the first episodes in the latter half of December 1952 immediately after her eight days of filming on The Blue Gardenia:Asbury Park Press 15 December 1952 \\"Actress Back After Illness\\" by Bob Thomas p.10 Sothern's focus would remain focused on television roles with occasional cinematic forays, her next cinematic credit subsequent to The Blue Gardenia being the 1964 film The Best Man. The last of the film's stars to be announced was male lead Richard Conte, who had previously starred for Alex Gottlieb Productions in The Fighter: Fritz Lang, hired by Gottlieb to direct The Blue Gardenia, had hoped to cast Dana Andrews, established as the top actor of the film noir genre, but Andrews had recently begun a sabbatical from film work. In 1965 Fritz Lang - responding to the assertion by Peter Bogdanovich that The Blue Gardenia was \\"a particularly venomous picture of American life\\" - recalled the film as \\"[Lang's] first picture after the McCarthy business and I had to shoot it in twenty days. Maybe that's what made me so venomous\\". Although Lang evidently recalled his career as being seriously hindered by the Hollywood blacklist, the interval between his being hired for The Blue Gardenia (announced October 1952) and the completion of Lang's precedent directorial assignment: Clash by Night, was not objectively an overly protracted lapse lasting only about seven or eight months (Lang would be hired by a major studio - Columbia Pictures - in January 1953 some three months before The Blue Gardenia was released). The filming of The Blue Gardenia commenced 28 November 1952 and was completed Christmas Eve, Lang wrapping the movie a day earlier than its 21-day filming schedule. Reportedly Ruth Storey, the actress married to the film's leading man Richard Conte, while visiting her husband on-set during filming, accepted the producer's spontaneous suggestion that she play Rose in the film.Philadelphia Inquirer 19 December 1952 \\"Reagan Set for TV Role with Wife\\" by Louella Parsons p.29 Though this role was small, it was pivotal.New York Daily News 28 April 1953 \\"Palace Back to Films with 'Blue Gardenia\\" by Dorothy Masters p.54 Another key role ‚Äì although uncredited ‚Äì was played by Celia Lovsky, a long-time associate of Fritz Lang who had been instrumental in Lang's casting Peter Lorre ‚Äì for a time Lovsky's husband ‚Äì in M, Lang's 1931 sound film break-through. Bit parts at the newspaper office were filled by the film's producer Alex Gottlieb and his wife, retired stage actress Polly Rose (sister of composer Billy Rose). Reception When the film was first released, the staff at Variety magazine gave The Blue Gardenia a lukewarm review: \\"A stock story and handling keep The Blue Gardenia from being anything more than a regulation mystery melodrama, from a yarn by Vera Caspary. Formula development has an occasional bright spot, mostly because Ann Sothern breathes some life into a stock character and quips ... Baxter and Conte do what they can but fight a losing battle with the script while Burr is a rather obvious wolf. Nat ‚ÄòKing‚Äô Cole is spotted to sing the title tune, written by Bob Russell and Lester Lee.\\"Variety. Staff film review, 1953. Accessed: August 3, 2013. Film director and writer Peter Bogdanovich called The Blue Gardenia \\"a particularly venomous picture of American life\\". Jans B. Wager stated that it is a \\"film that rigorously contains black masculinity within a peculiar studio set\\". Critic Dennis Schwartz gave the movie a mixed review, writing: \\"A minor film noir from Fritz Lang (Clash by Night/The Big Heat) that never has a chance to bloom because of its dull script. It is based on the short story \\"Gardenia\\" by Vera Caspary. It plays as an unimaginative newspaper melodrama that takes jabs at the middle-class and how neurotic and fearful they are about romance. Nat \\"King\\" Cole makes a welcome cameo as the house pianist at the nightclub called The Blue Gardenia, crooning in his velvet voice the titular theme song. Noted cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca injects the film with some intriguing noir touches, such as those ominous rain drops on Raymond Burr's window the night of the murder ... Lang himself in interviews dismissed the film as a 'job-for-hire'. ... But the story itself wasn't original and the acting wasn't engaging enough to elevate it past being a mild thriller.\\"Schwartz, Dennis. Ozus' World Movie Reviews, film review, October 16, 2004.. Accessed: June 25, 2013. A Lux Radio Theatre adaptation of The Blue Gardenia aired 30 November 1954, with the lead roles taken by Dana Andrews ‚Äì in the role Fritz Lang had wanted him to play in the film ‚Äì and Ruth Roman: Andrews would later play the male lead in both the 1956 movies: While the City Sleeps and Beyond a Reasonable Doubt, which were the second and third installments of the \\"newspaper noir\\" movie trio Lang began with the movie The Blue Gardenia (Lang was not involved in the Lux Radio production).

Bird flight is the primary mode of locomotion used by most bird species in which birds take off and fly. Flight assists birds with feeding, breeding, avoiding predators, and migrating. Bird flight is one of the most complex forms of locomotion in the animal kingdom. Each facet of this type of motion, including hovering, taking off, and landing, involves many complex movements. As different bird species adapted over millions of years through evolution for specific environments, prey, predators, and other needs, they developed specializations in their wings, and acquired different forms of flight. Various theories exist about how bird flight evolved, including flight from falling or gliding (the trees down hypothesis), from running or leaping (the ground up hypothesis), from wing-assisted incline running or from proavis (pouncing) behavior. Basic mechanics of bird flight =Lift and drag= The fundamentals of bird flight are similar to those of aircraft, in which the aerodynamic forces sustaining flight are lift and drag. Lift force is produced by the action of air flow on the wing, which is an airfoil. The airfoil is shaped such that the air provides a net upward force on the wing, while the movement of air is directed downward. Additional net lift may come from airflow around the bird's body in some species, especially during intermittent flight while the wings are folded or semi-folded (cf. lifting body). Aerodynamic drag is the force opposite to the direction of motion, and hence the source of energy loss in flight. The drag force can be separated into two portions, lift-induced drag, which is the inherent cost of the wing producing lift (this energy ends up primarily in the wingtip vortices), and parasitic drag, including skin friction drag from the friction of air and body surfaces and form drag from the bird's frontal area. The streamlining of bird's body and wings reduces these forces. Wings A kea in flight. The bird's forelimbs (the wings) are the key to flight. Each wing has a central vane to hit the wind, composed of three limb bones, the humerus, ulna and radius. The hand, or manus, which ancestrally was composed of five digits, is reduced to three digits (digit II, III and IV or I, II, III depending on the scheme followedBaumel JJ (1993) Handbook of Avian Anatomy: Nomina Anatomica Avium. 2nd Ed. Nuttall Ornithological Club. Cambridge, MA, USA), which serves as an anchor for the primaries, one of two groups of flight feathers responsible for the wing's airfoil shape. The other set of flight feathers, behind the carpal joint on the ulna, are called the secondaries. The remaining feathers on the wing are known as coverts, of which there are three sets. The wing sometimes has vestigial claws. In most species, these are lost by the time the bird is adult (such as the highly visible ones used for active climbing by hoatzin chicks), but claws are retained into adulthood by the secretarybird, screamers, finfoots, ostriches, several swifts and numerous others, as a local trait, in a few specimens. Albatrosses have locking mechanisms in the wing joints that reduce the strain on the muscles during soaring flight.Videler, JJ (2005) Avian Flight. Oxford University Press. pages 33-34 Even within a species wing morphology may differ. For example, adult European Turtle Doves have been found to have longer but more rounded wings than juveniles ‚Äì suggesting that juvenile wing morphology facilitates their first migrations, while selection for flight maneuverability is more important after the juveniles‚Äô first molt. Female birds exposed to predators during ovulation produce chicks that grow their wings faster than chicks produced by predator- free females. Their wings are also longer. Both adaptations may make them better at avoiding avian predators. Wing shape Wing shapes The shape of the wing is important in determining the flight capabilities of a bird. Different shapes correspond to different trade-offs between advantages such as speed, low energy use, and maneuverability. Two important parameters are the aspect ratio and wing loading. Aspect ratio is the ratio of wingspan to the mean of its chord (or the square of the wingspan divided by wing area). Wing loading is the ratio of weight to wing area. Most kinds of bird wing can be grouped into four types, with some falling between two of these types. These types of wings are elliptical wings, high speed wings, high aspect ratio wings and soaring wings with slots. The budgerigar's wings, as seen on this pet female, allow it excellent manoeuvrability. =Elliptical wings= Technically, elliptical wings are those having elliptical (that is quarter ellipses) meeting conformally at the tips. The early model Supermarine Spitfire is an example. Some birds have vaguely elliptical wings, including the albatross wing of high aspect ratio. Although the term is convenient, it might be more precise to refer to curving taper with fairly small radius at the tips. Many small birds have having a low aspect ratio with elliptical character (when spread), allowing for tight maneuvering in confined spaces such as might be found in dense vegetation. As such they are common in forest raptors (such as Accipiter hawks), and many passerines, particularly non- migratory ones (migratory species have longer wings). They are also common in species that use a rapid take off to evade predators, such as pheasants and partridges. =High speed wings= High speed wings are short, pointed wings that when combined with a heavy wing loading and rapid wingbeats provide an energetically expensive, but high speed. This type of flight is used by the bird with the fastest wing speed, the peregrine falcon, as well as by most of the ducks. The same wing shape is used by the auks for a different purpose; auks use their wings to \\"fly\\" underwater. The peregrine falcon has the highest recorded dive speed of 242 mph (389 km/h). The fastest straight, powered flight is the spine-tailed swift at 105 mph (170 km/h). A roseate tern uses its low wing loading and high aspect ratio to achieve low speed flight. =High aspect ratio wings= High aspect ratio wings, which usually have low wing loading and are far longer than they are wide, are used for slower flight. This may take the form of almost hovering (as used by kestrels, terns and nightjars) or in soaring and gliding flight, particularly the dynamic soaring used by seabirds, which takes advantage of wind speed variation at different altitudes (wind shear) above ocean waves to provide lift. Low speed flight is also important for birds that plunge-dive for fish. =Soaring wings with deep slots= These wings are favored by larger species of inland birds, such as eagles, vultures, pelicans, and storks. The slots at the end of the wings, between the primaries, reduce the induced drag and wingtip vortices by \\"capturing\\" the energy in air flowing from the lower to upper wing surface at the tips, whilst the shorter size of the wings aids in takeoff (high aspect ratio wings require a long taxi to get airborne). Flight Birds use three types of flight. They are distinguished by wing motion. =Gliding flight= Lesser flamingos flying in formation. When in gliding flight, the upward aerodynamic force is equal to the weight. In gliding flight, no propulsion is used; the energy to counteract the energy loss due to aerodynamic drag is either taken from the potential energy of the bird, resulting in a descending flight, or is replaced by rising air currents (\\"thermals\\"), referred to as soaring flight. For specialist soaring birds (obligate soarers), the decision to engage in flight are strongly related to atmospheric conditions that allow individuals to maximise flight-efficiency and minimise energetic costs. =Flapping flight= When a bird flaps, as opposed to gliding, its wings continue to develop lift as before, but the lift is rotated forward to provide thrust, which counteracts drag and increases its speed, which has the effect of also increasing lift to counteract its weight, allowing it to maintain height or to climb. Flapping involves two stages: the down-stroke, which provides the majority of the thrust, and the up-stroke, which can also (depending on the bird's wings) provide some thrust. At each up-stroke the wing is slightly folded inwards to reduce the energetic cost of flapping-wing flight.Parslew, B. (2012). Simulating Avian Wingbeats and Wakes, PhD Thesis Birds change the angle of attack continuously within a flap, as well as with speed. =Bounding flight= Small birds often fly long distances using a technique in which short bursts of flapping are alternated with intervals in which the wings are folded against the body. This is a flight pattern known as \\"bounding\\" or \\"flap-bounding\\" flight.Bret W. Tobalske, Jason W. D. Hearn and Douglas R. Warrick, \\"Aerodynamics of intermittent bounds in flying birds\\", Exp. Fluids, 46, pp. 963‚Äì973 (2009), DOI 10.1007/s00348-009-0614-9 (accessed 2 August 2016) When the bird's wings are folded, its trajectory is primarily ballistic, with a small amount of body lift. The flight pattern is believed to decrease the energy required by reducing the aerodynamic drag during the ballistic part of the trajectory,Brendan Body, Tips and observations of bird flight: \\"Further affects of air resistance on small birds\\", 2009 (accessed 2 August 2016) and to increase the efficiency of muscle use. Hovering The ruby-throated hummingbird can beat its wings 52 times a second. Several bird species use hovering, with one family specialized for hovering - the hummingbirds. True hovering occurs by generating lift through flapping alone, rather than by passage through the air, requiring considerable energy expenditure. This usually confines the ability to smaller birds, but some larger birds, such as a kite or osprey can hover for a short period of time. Although not a true hover, some birds remain in a fixed position relative to the ground or water by flying into a headwind. Hummingbirds, kestrels, terns and hawks use this wind hovering. Most birds that hover have high aspect ratio wings that are suited to low speed flying. Hummingbirds are a unique exception - the most accomplished hoverers of all birds. Hummingbird flight is different from other bird flight in that the wing is extended throughout the whole stroke, which is a symmetrical figure of eight, with the wing producing lift on both the up- and down-stroke. Hummingbirds beat their wings at some 43 times per second, while others may be as high as 80 times per second. Take- off and landing A male bufflehead runs atop the water while taking off. A magpie-goose taking off. Take-off is one of the most energetically demanding aspects of flight, as the bird must generate enough airflow across the wing to create lift. Small birds do this with a simple upward jump. That doesn't work for larger birds, which must take a run up to generate sufficient airflow. Large birds take off by facing into the wind, or, if they can, by perching on a branch or cliff so they can just drop off into the air. Landing is also a problem for large birds with high wing loads. This problem is dealt with in some species by aiming for a point below the intended landing area (such as a nest on a cliff) then pulling up beforehand. If timed correctly, the airspeed once the target is reached is virtually nil. Landing on water is simpler, and the larger waterfowl species prefer to do so whenever possible, landing into wind and using their feet as skids. To lose height rapidly prior to landing, some large birds such as geese indulge in a rapid alternating series of sideslips or even briefly turning upside down in a maneuver termed as whiffling. Coordinated formation flight A wide variety of birds fly together in a symmetric V-shaped or a J-shaped coordinated formation, also referred to as an \\"echelon\\", especially during long distance flight or migration. It is often assumed that birds resort to this pattern of formation flying in order to save energy and improve the aerodynamic efficiency. The birds flying at the tips and at the front would interchange positions in a timely cyclical fashion to spread flight fatigue equally among the flock members. The wingtips of the leading bird in an echelon create a pair of opposite rotating line vortices. The vortices trailing a bird have an underwash part behind the bird, and at the same time they have an upwash on the outside, that hypothetically could aid the flight of a trailing bird. In a 1970 study the authors claimed that each bird in a V formation of 25 members can achieve a reduction of induced drag and as a result increase their range by 71%. Studies of waldrapp ibis show that birds spatially coordinate the phase of wing flapping and show wingtip path coherence when flying in V positions, thus enabling them to maximally utilise the available energy of upwash over the entire flap cycle. In contrast, birds flying in a stream immediately behind another do not have wingtip coherence in their flight pattern and their flapping is out of phase, as compared to birds flying in V patterns, so as to avoid the detrimental effects of the downwash due to the leading bird's flight. Adaptations for flight Diagram of the wing of a chicken, top view The most obvious adaptation to flight is the wing, but because flight is so energetically demanding birds have evolved several other adaptations to improve efficiency when flying. Birds' bodies are streamlined to help overcome air-resistance. Also, the bird skeleton is hollow to reduce weight, and many unnecessary bones have been lost (such as the bony tail of the early bird Archaeopteryx), along with the toothed jaw of early birds, which has been replaced with a lightweight beak. The skeleton's breastbone has also adapted into a large keel, suitable for the attachment of large, powerful flight muscles. The vanes of each feather have hooklets called barbules that zip the vanes of individual feathers together, giving the feathers the strength needed to hold the airfoil (these are often lost in flightless birds). The barbules maintain the shape and function of the feather. Each feather has a major (greater) side and a minor (lesser) side, meaning that the shaft or rachis does not run down the center of the feather. Rather it runs longitudinally of center with the lesser or minor side to the front and the greater or major side to the rear of the feather. This feather anatomy, during flight and flapping of the wings, causes a rotation of the feather in its follicle. The rotation occurs in the up motion of the wing. The greater side points down, letting air slip through the wing. This essentially breaks the integrity of the wing, allowing for a much easier movement in the up direction. The integrity of the wing is reestablished in the down movement, which allows for part of the lift inherent in bird wings. This function is most important in taking off or achieving lift at very low or slow speeds where the bird is reaching up and grabbing air and pulling itself up. At high speeds the air foil function of the wing provides most of the lift needed to stay in flight. The large amounts of energy required for flight have led to the evolution of a unidirectional pulmonary system to provide the large quantities of oxygen required for their high respiratory rates. This high metabolic rate produces large quantities of radicals in the cells that can damage DNA and lead to tumours. Birds, however, do not suffer from an otherwise expected shortened lifespan as their cells have evolved a more efficient antioxidant system than those found in other animals.

Most paleontologists agree that birds evolved from small theropod dinosaurs, but the origin of bird flight is one of the oldest and most hotly contested debates in paleontology. Book review that provides a good, non-technical summary of the issues. The book is The four main hypotheses are: *From the trees down, that birds' ancestors first glided down from trees and then acquired other modifications that enabled true powered flight. *From the ground up, that birds' ancestors were small, fast predatory dinosaurs in which feathers developed for other reasons and then evolved further to provide first lift and then true powered flight. *Wing-assisted incline running (WAIR), a version of \\"from the ground up\\" in which birds' wings originated from forelimb modifications that provided downforce, enabling the proto-birds to run up extremely steep slopes such as the trunks of trees. *Pouncing proavis, which posits that flight evolved by modification from arboreal ambush tactics. There has also been debate about whether the earliest known bird, Archaeopteryx, could fly. It appears that Archaeopteryx had the brain structures and inner- ear balance sensors that birds use to control their flight. Archaeopteryx also had a wing feather arrangement like that of modern birds and similarly asymmetrical flight feathers on its wings and tail. But Archaeopteryx lacked the shoulder mechanism by which modern birds' wings produce swift, powerful upstrokes; this may mean that it and other early birds were incapable of flapping flight and could only glide. The presence of most fossils in marine sediments in habitats devoid of vegetation has led to the hypothesis that they may have used their wings as aids to run across the water surface in the manner of the basilisk lizards.Videler, JJ (2005) Avian Flight. Oxford University Press. pages 98-117 In March 2018, scientists reported that Archaeopteryx was likely capable of flight, but in a manner substantially different from that of modern birds. =From the trees down= It is unknown how well Archaeopteryx could fly, or if it could even fly at all. This was the earliest hypothesis, encouraged by the examples of gliding vertebrates such as flying squirrels. It suggests that proto-birds like Archaeopteryx used their claws to clamber up trees and glided off from the tops. See also Some recent research undermines the \\"trees down\\" hypothesis by suggesting that the earliest birds and their immediate ancestors did not climb trees. Modern birds that forage in trees have much more curved toe-claws than those that forage on the ground. The toe-claws of Mesozoic birds and of closely related non-avian theropod dinosaurs are like those of modern ground-foraging birds. =From the ground up= Feathers are very common in coelurosaurid dinosaurs (including the early tyrannosauroid Dilong). Modern birds are classified as coelurosaurs by nearly all palaeontologists, though not by a few ornithologists.Feduccia, A. (1993). The original functions of feathers may have included thermal insulation and competitive displays. The most common version of the \\"from the ground up\\" hypothesis argues that bird's ancestors were small ground-running predators (rather like roadrunners) that used their forelimbs for balance while pursuing prey and that the forelimbs and feathers later evolved in ways that provided gliding and then powered flight. Another \\"ground upwards\\" theory argues the evolution of flight was initially driven by competitive displays and fighting: displays required longer feathers and longer, stronger forelimbs; many modern birds use their wings as weapons, and downward blows have a similar action to that of flapping flight. Many of the Archaeopteryx fossils come from marine sediments and it has been suggested that wings may have helped the birds run over water in the manner of the Jesus Christ lizard (common basilisk). Most recent attacks on the \\"from the ground up\\" hypothesis attempt to refute its assumption that birds are modified coelurosaurid dinosaurs. The strongest attacks are based on embryological analyses, which conclude that birds' wings are formed from digits 2, 3 and 4 (corresponding to the index, middle and ring fingers in humans; the first of a bird's 3 digits forms the alula, which they use to avoid stalling on low-speed flight, for example when landing); but the hands of coelurosaurs are formed by digits 1, 2 and 3 (thumb and first 2 fingers in humans). Summarized at However these embryological analyses were immediately challenged on the embryological grounds that the \\"hand\\" often develops differently in clades that have lost some digits in the course of their evolution, and therefore bird's hands do develop from digits 1, 2 and 3. =Wing-assisted incline running= The wing- assisted incline running (WAIR) hypothesis was prompted by observation of young chukar chicks, and proposes that wings developed their aerodynamic functions as a result of the need to run quickly up very steep slopes such as tree trunks, for example to escape from predators. Note that in this scenario birds need downforce to give their feet increased grip. Summarized in But early birds, including Archaeopteryx, lacked the shoulder mechanism that modern birds' wings use to produce swift, powerful upstrokes. Since the downforce that WAIR requires is generated by upstrokes, it seems that early birds were incapable of WAIR. = Pouncing proavis model = The proavis theory was first proposed by Garner, Taylor, and Thomas in 1999: > We propose that birds evolved from predators that specialized in ambush from > elevated sites, using their raptorial hindlimbs in a leaping attack. > Drag‚Äìbased, and later lift-based, mechanisms evolved under selection for > improved control of body position and locomotion during the aerial part of > the attack. Selection for enhanced lift-based control led to improved lift > coefficients, incidentally turning a pounce into a swoop as lift production > increased. Selection for greater swooping range would finally lead to the > origin of true flight. The authors believed that this theory had four main virtues: * It predicts the observed sequence of character acquisition in avian evolution. * It predicts an Archaeopteryx-like animal, with a skeleton more or less identical to terrestrial theropods, with few adaptations to flapping, but very advanced aerodynamic asymmetrical feathers. * It explains that primitive pouncers (perhaps like Microraptor) could coexist with more advanced fliers (like Confuciusornis or Sapeornis) since they did not compete for flying niches. * It explains that the evolution of elongated rachis-bearing feathers began with simple forms that produced a benefit by increasing drag. Later, more refined feather shapes could begin to also provide lift. =Uses and loss of flight in modern birds= Birds use flight to obtain prey on the wing, for foraging, to commute to feeding grounds, and to migrate between the seasons. It is also used by some species to display during the breeding season and to reach safe isolated places for nesting. Flight is more energetically expensive in larger birds, and many of the largest species fly by soaring and gliding (without flapping their wings) as much as possible. Many physiological adaptations have evolved that make flight more efficient. Birds that settle on isolated oceanic islands that lack ground-based predators often lose the ability to fly. This illustrates both flight's importance in avoiding predators and its extreme demand for energy.

In the following, example, however: d1 : y := 3 d2 : y := 4 d3 : x := y \`d1\` is no longer a reaching definition for \`d3\`, because \`d2\` kills its reach: the value defined in \`d1\` is no longer available and cannot reach \`d3\`.  As analysis  The similarly named reaching definitions is a data-flow analysis which statically determines which definitions may reach a given point in the code. Because of its simplicity, it is often used as the canonical example of a data-flow analysis in textbooks. The data-flow confluence operator used is set union, and the analysis is forward flow. Reaching definitions are used to compute use-def chains. The data-flow equations used for a given basic block S in reaching definitions are: * {\\\\rm REACH}_{\\\\rm in}[S] = \\\\bigcup_{p \\\\in pred[S]} {\\\\rm REACH}_{\\\\rm out}[p] * {\\\\rm REACH}_{\\\\rm out}[S] = {\\\\rm GEN}[S] \\\\cup ({\\\\rm REACH}_{\\\\rm in}[S] - {\\\\rm KILL}[S]) In other words, the set of reaching definitions going into S are all of the reaching definitions from S's predecessors, pred[S]. pred[S] consists of all of the basic blocks that come before S in the control flow graph.

Naval career Turner was appointed a midshipman in the Navy on 1 January 1808. Following brief duty at the New York Naval Station, he served in Constitution on the North Atlantic Station. On 8 June 1812, he received orders to Norwich, Connecticut, where he took command of the gunboats located there. On 14 March 1813, two days after receiving his commission as a lieutenant, Turner was sent to Sackett's Harbor, New York, located on the shores of Lake Erie. There, he took command of Niagara, a brig in Oliver Hazard Perry's squadron. However, just before the Battle of Lake Erie, he relinquished command to Captain Jesse D. Elliott and assumed command of Caledonia. The little brig played an important role in the battle on 10 September 1813 because, at one point in the action, her two 24-pounder long guns were the only ones in Perry's flotilla capable of returning the distant fire of the three heaviest Royal Navy ships then in the process of pounding Perry's flagship Lawrence. For his part in the American victory at Lake Erie, Lt. Turner received the praise of Perry, a vote of thanks and a medal from Congress, and a sword from the state of New York. In the summer of 1814, Turner succeeded to the command of schooner Scorpion, and he cruised Lakes Erie and Huron in her supporting army operations around Detroit and blockading British forces at the Nottawasaga River and Lake Simcoe. On 6 September 1814, Turner and his command were captured by the British when he brought Scorpion alongside the former American schooner Tigress which, unbeknownst to him, had been captured a few days earlier. After a period of imprisonment at Fort Mackinac, Lt. Turner returned to the United States in exchange for a British prisoner of war. Between 1815 and 1817, Turner cruised the Mediterranean in the frigate Java commanded by his old superior on the Great Lakes, Oliver Hazard Perry. During that deployment, Java visited Algiers and Tripoli in a show of American naval strength calculated to impress the Barbary pirates and intimidate them into honoring their treaties with the United States. In 1817, Java returned to Newport, Rhode Island, to be laid up. Between 1819 and 1824, Turner returned to sea in the schooner Nonsuch attached to a squadron commanded again by Oliver Hazard Perry. In addition to hunting West Indian pirates, his ship sailed up the Orinoco River to carry Perry on a diplomatic mission to the Venezuelan government under Simon Bolivar. During the return downriver, Perry and many of the crew contracted yellow fever. Turner was close at hand when his mentor died at Trinidad on 23 August 1819. During the remaining years of Turner's assignment to Nonsuch, his ship worked along the east coast of the United States, patrolled in the West Indies to suppress piracy, and made a brief cruise to the Mediterranean in 1824. Following shore duty at Boston, Massachusetts, Turner returned to sea in 1827 for a three-year assignment with the West India Squadron, as the commanding officer of Erie. In 1830, he came ashore again for three years at the Portsmouth Navy Yard. Promoted to captain on 3 March 1835, Turner spent a long period waiting orders before returning to sea in 1839 in command of USS Constitution. He sailed the Pacific Squadron in \\"Old Ironsides,\\" until he was relieved in 1841. From 1843 to 1846, he commanded the American squadron which operated along the Brazilian coast. From that duty, he reported ashore again as Commandant, Portsmouth Navy Yard. Capt. Turner died suddenly on 4 February 1850 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and he was buried in Greenmount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland. Legacy Three United States Navy destroyers have been named in honor of Captain Turner, including which was probably sunk by a German U-boat off of New York City in 1944. There is a portrait of Captain Turner in the collection of the Redwood Library in Newport, Rhode Island.

It is covered in fur and spines and has a distinctive snout and a specialized tongue, which it uses to catch its insect prey at a great speed. Like the other extant monotremes, the short-beaked echidna lays eggs; the monotremes are the only group of mammals to do so. The short-beaked echidna has extremely strong front limbs and claws, which allow it to burrow quickly with great power. As it needs to be able to survive underground, it has a significant tolerance to high levels of carbon dioxide and low levels of oxygen. It has no weapons or fighting ability but repels predators by curling into a ball and deterring them with its spines. It lacks the ability to sweat and cannot deal with heat well, so it tends to avoid daytime activity in hot weather. It can swim if needed. The snout has mechanoreceptors and electroreceptors that help the echidna to detect its surroundings. During the Australian winter, it goes into deep torpor and hibernation, reducing its metabolism to save energy. As the temperature increases, it emerges to mate. Female echidnas lay one egg a year and the mating period is the only time the otherwise solitary animals meet one another; the male has no further contact with the female or his offspring after mating. A newborn echidna is the size of a grape but grows rapidly on its mother's milk, which is very rich in nutrients. Baby echidnas eventually grow too large and spiky to stay in the pouch and, around seven weeks after hatching, are expelled from the pouch into the mother's burrow. At around six months of age, they leave the burrow and have no more contact with their mothers. The species is found throughout Australia, where it is the most widespread native mammal, and in coastal and highland regions of eastern New Guinea, where it is known as the mungwe in the Daribi and Chimbu languages.Flannery, T. 1990. Mammals of New Guinea Robert Brown & Associates It is not threatened with extinction, but human activities, such as hunting, habitat destruction, and the introduction of foreign predatory species and parasites, have reduced its distribution in Australia. Taxonomy and naming The short-beaked echidna was first described by George Shaw in 1792. He named the species Myrmecophaga aculeata, thinking that it might be related to the giant anteater. Since Shaw first described the species, its name has undergone four revisions: from M. aculeata to Ornithorhynchus hystrix, Echidna hystrix, Echidna aculeata and finally, Tachyglossus aculeatus.Iredale, T. and Troughton, E. 1934. A checklist of mammals recorded from Australia. Memoirs of the Australian Museum 6: i‚Äìxii, 1‚Äì122 The name Tachyglossus means \\"quick tongue\\", in reference to the speed with which the echidna uses its tongue to catch ants and termites, and aculeatus means \\"spiny\\" or \\"equipped with spines\\".Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 5. The short-beaked echidna is the only member of its genus, sharing the family Tachyglossidae with the extant species of the genus Zaglossus that occur in New Guinea.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 5‚Äì9. Zaglossus species, which include the western long-beaked, Sir David's long-beaked and eastern long-beaked echidnas, are all significantly larger than T. aculeatus, and their diets consist mostly of worms and grubs rather than ants and termites.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 7‚Äì10. Species of the Tachyglossidae are egg-laying mammals; together with the related family Ornithorhynchidae, they are the only extant monotremes in the world.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 10. The five subspecies of the short-beaked echidna are each found in different geographical locations. The subspecies also differ from one another in their hairiness, spine length and width, and the size of the grooming claws on their hind feet.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 6‚Äì7. * T. a. acanthion is found in Northern Territory and Western Australia. * T. a. aculeatus is found in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. * T. a. lawesii is found in coastal regions and the highlands of New Guinea, and possibly in the rainforests of Northeast Queensland.Griffiths, M.E. 1978. The Biology of Monotremes. Academic Press : New York * T. a. multiaculeatus is found on Kangaroo Island. * T. a. setosus is found on Tasmania and some islands in Bass Strait. The earliest fossils of the short- beaked echidna date back around 15 million years ago to the Miocene epoch, and the oldest specimens were found in caves in South Australia, often with fossils of the long-beaked echidna from the same period. The ancient short- beaked echidnas are considered to be identical to their contemporary descendants except the ancestors are around 10% smaller.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 16. This \\"post-Pleistocene dwarfing\\" affects many Australian mammals. Part of the last radiation of monotreme mammals, echidnas are believed to have evolutionally diverged from the platypus around 66 million years ago, between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods. However, the echidna's pre-Pleistocene heritage has not been traced yet, and the lack of teeth on the fossils found thus far have made it impossible to use dental evidence.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 16‚Äì17. T. a. setosus, Mount Field National Park, Tasmania The short-beaked echidna was commonly called the spiny anteater in older books, though this term has fallen out of fashion since the echidna bears no relation to the true anteaters. It has a variety of names in the indigenous languages of the regions where it is found. The Noongar people from southwestern Western Australia call it the nyingarn. In Central Australia southwest of Alice Springs, the Pitjantjatjara term is tjilkamata or tjirili, from the word tjiri for spike of porcupine grass (Triodia irritans). The word can also mean slowpoke. In central Cape York Peninsula, it is called (minha) kekoywa in Pakanh, where minha is a qualifier meaning 'meat' or 'animal', (inh-)ekorak in Uw Oykangand and (inh-)egorag in Uw Olkola, where inh- is a qualifier meaning 'meat' or 'animal'. In the highland regions of southwestern New Guinea, it is known as the mungwe in the Daribi and Chimbu languages. The shorted-beaked echidna is called mi…£u in the Motu language of Papua New Guinea.Ross, Malcolm; Pawley, Andrew; Osmond, Meredith (eds).

Description Spines and fur of an echidna Skull of a short-beaked echidna Short-beaked echidnas are typically in length, with of snout, and weigh between .Egerton, p. 38. However, the Tasmanian subspecies, T. a. setosus, is smaller than its Australian mainland counterparts.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 6. Because the neck is not externally visible, the head and body appear to merge. The earholes are on either side of the head, with no external pinnae. The eyes are small, about in diameter and at the base of the wedge-shaped snout.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 55. The nostrils and the mouth are at the distal end of the snout;Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 2. the mouth cannot open wider than . The body of the short-beaked echidna is, with the exception of the underside, face and legs, covered with cream-coloured spines. The spines, which may be up to long, are modified hairs, mostly made of keratin.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 35. Insulation is provided by fur between the spines, which ranges in colour from honey to a dark reddish-brown and even black; the underside and short tail are also covered in fur. Colouration of the fur and spines varies with geographic location. For example, the spines of the Kangaroo Island subspecies (T. a. multiaculeatus) are more numerous, longer, thinner, and paler in colour than those of the other subspecies. The echidna's fur may be infested with what is said to be the world's largest flea, Bradiopsylla echidnae, which is about long. The limbs of the short-beaked echidna are adapted for rapid digging; they are short and have strong claws. Their strong and stout limbs allow it to tear apart large logs and move paving stones, and one has been recorded moving a 13.5-kg (30-lb) stone; a scientist also reported that a captive echidna moved a refrigerator around the room in his home.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 100. The power of the limbs is based on strong musculature, particularly around the shoulder and torso areas.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 100‚Äì101. The mechanical advantage of its arm is greater than that of humans, as its biceps connects the shoulder to the forearm at a point further down than for humans,Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 101‚Äì102. and the chunky humerus allows more muscle to form.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 102. A short-beaked echidna forages in a suburban backyard, Sydney, Australia. The claws on the hind feet are elongated and curved backward to enable cleaning and grooming between the spines. Like the platypus, the echidna has a low body temperature‚Äîbetween 30 and 32 ¬∞C (86 and 90 ¬∞F)‚Äîbut, unlike the platypus, which shows no evidence of torpor or hibernation, the body temperature of the echidna may fall as low as 5 ¬∞C (41 ¬∞F). The echidna does not pant or sweatAugee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 90‚Äì91. and normally seeks shelter in hot conditions.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 91. Despite their inability to sweat, echidnas still lose water as they exhale. The snout is believed to be crucial in restricting this loss to sustainable levels, through a bony labyrinth that has a refrigerator effect and helps to condense water vapour in the breath.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 114‚Äì115. The echidna does not have highly concentrated urine, and around half of the estimated daily water loss of occurs in this manner, while most of the rest is through the skin and respiratory system.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 115. Most of this is replenished by its substantial eating of termites‚Äîone laboratory study reported ingestion of around a day, most of which was water. This can be supplemented by drinking water, if available, or licking morning dew from flora.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 116. In the Australian autumn and winter, the echidna enters periods of torpor or deep hibernation. Because of its low body temperature, it becomes sluggish in very hot and very cold weather. Like all monotremes, it has one orifice,Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 3. the cloaca, for the passage of faeces, urine and reproductive products. The male has internal testes, no external scrotum and a highly unusual penis with four knobs on the tip,Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 79. which is nearly a quarter of his body length when erect. The gestating female develops a pouch on her underside, where she raises her young.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 4. A short- beaked echidna curled into a ball. The snout is visible on the right. The musculature of the short-beaked echidna has a number of unusual aspects. The panniculus carnosus, an enormous muscle just beneath the skin, covers the entire body.Griffiths M, Walton DW (Editor), Richardson BJ(Editor), Fauna of Australia Volume 1B, AGPS Canberra, 1989. By contraction of various parts of the panniculus carnosus, the short-beaked echidna can change shape, the most characteristic shape change being achieved by rolling itself into a ball when threatened, so protecting its belly and presenting a defensive array of sharp spines. It has one of the shortest spinal cords of any mammal, extending only as far as the thorax. Whereas the human spinal cord ends at the first or second lumbar vertebra, for the echidna it occurs at the seventh thoracic vertebra.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 53. The shorter spinal cord is thought to allow flexibility to enable wrapping into a ball. The musculature of the face, jaw and tongue is specialised for feeding. The tongue is the animal's sole means of catching prey, and can protrude up to outside the snout. The snout's shape, resembling a double wedge, gives it a significant mechanical advantage in generating a large moment, so makes it efficient for digging to reach prey or to build a shelter.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 103‚Äì104. The tongue is sticky because of the presence of glycoprotein-rich mucus, which both lubricates movement in and out of the snout and helps to catch ants and termites, which adhere to it. The tongue is protruded by contracting circular muscles that change the shape of the tongue and force it forwards and contracting two genioglossal muscles attached to the caudal end of the tongue and to the mandible. The protruded tongue is stiffened by a rapid flow of blood, which allows it to penetrate wood and soil. Retraction requires the contraction of two internal longitudinal muscles, known as the sternoglossi. When the tongue is retracted, the prey is caught on backward-facing keratinous \\"teeth\\", located along the roof of the buccal cavity, allowing the animal both to capture and grind food. The tongue moves with great speed, and has been measured to move in and out of the snout 100 times a minute. This is partly achieved through the elasticity of the tongue and the conversion of elastic potential energy into kinetic energy. The tongue is very flexible, particularly at the end, allowing it to bend in U-turns and catch insects attempting to flee in their labyrinthine nests or mounds.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 104. The tongue also has an ability to avoid picking up splinters while foraging in logs; the factors behind this ability are unknown.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 105. It can eat quickly; a specimen of around can ingest of termites in 10 minutes. The echidna's stomach is quite different from other mammals. It is devoid of secretory glands and has a cornified stratified epithelium, which resembles horny skin.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 106. Unlike other mammals, which typically have highly acidic stomachs, the echidna has low levels of acidity, almost neutral, with pH in the 6.2‚Äì7.4 range. The stomach is elastic, and gastric peristalsis grinds soil particulates and shredded insects together. Digestion occurs in the small intestine, which is around in length. The insect exoskeletons and soil are not digested, being ejected in the waste. Numerous physiological adaptations aid the lifestyle of the short-beaked echidna. Because the animal burrows, it must tolerate very high levels of carbon dioxide in inspired air, and will voluntarily remain in situations where carbon dioxide concentrations are high. It can dig up to a metre into the ground to retrieve ants or evade predators, and can survive with low oxygen when the area is engulfed by bushfires. The echidna can also dive underwater, which can help it to survive sudden floods. During these situations, the heart rate drops to around 12 beats per minute, around one- fifth of the rate at rest. This process is believed to save oxygen for the heart and brain, which are the most sensitive organs to such a shortage; laboratory testing has revealed the echidna's cardiovascular system is similar to that of the seal. Following the devastation of a bushfire, echidnas can compensate for the lack of food by reducing their daytime body temperature and activity through use of torpor, for a period of up to three weeks. The echidna's optical system is an uncommon hybrid of both mammalian and reptilian characteristics. The cartilaginous layer beneath the sclera of the eyeball is similar to that of reptiles and avians. The small corneal surface is keratinised and hardened, possibly to protect it from chemicals secreted by prey insects or self-impalement when it rolls itself up, which has been observed.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 56. The echidna has the flattest lens of any animal, giving it the longest focal length. This similarity to primates and humans allows it to see distant objects clearly.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 57. Unlike placental mammals, including humans, the echidna does not have a ciliary muscle to distort the geometry of the lens and thereby change the focal length and allow objects at different distances to be viewed clearly; the whole eye is believed to distort, so the distance between the lens and retina instead changes to allow focusing. The visual ability of an echidna is not great, and it is not known whether it can perceive colour; however, it can distinguish between black and white, and horizontal and vertical stripes. Eyesight is not a crucial factor in the animal's ability to survive, as blind echidnas are able to live healthily.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 58‚Äì59. Its ears are sensitive to low-frequency sound, which may be ideal for detecting sounds emitted by termites and ants underground. The pinnae are obscured and covered by hair, so predators cannot grab them in an attack, and prey or foreign material cannot enter, although ticks are known to reside there.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 58. The macula of the ear is very large compared to other animals, and is used as a gravity sensor to orient the echidna. The large size may be important for burrowing downwards.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 65. Skeleton The leathery snout is keratinised and covered in mechano- and thermoreceptors, which provide information about the surrounding environment.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 66. These nerves protrude through microscopic holes at the end of the snout,Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 68. which also has mucus glands on the end that act as electroreceptors. Echidnas can detect electric fields of 1.8 mV/cm‚Äî1000 times more sensitive than humans‚Äîand dig up buried batteries.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 69‚Äì70. A series of push rods protrude from the snout. These are columns of flattened, spinous cells, with roughly an average diameter of 50 micrometres and a length of 300 micrometres. The number of push rods per square millimetre of skin is estimated to be 30 to 40.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 70‚Äì71. Longitudinal waves are believed to be picked up and transmitted through the rods, acting as mechanical sensors, to allow prey detection.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 72‚Äì75. A well-developed olfactory system may be used to detect mates and prey. A highly sensitive optic nerve has been shown to have visual discrimination and spatial memory comparable to those of a rat. The brain and central nervous system have been extensively studied for evolutionary comparison with placental mammals, particularly with its fellow monotreme, the platypus.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 44‚Äì48. The average brain volume is 25 ml, similar to a cat of approximately the same size;Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 45. while the platypus has a largely smooth brain, the echidna has a heavily folded and fissured, gyrencephalic brain similar to humans, which is seen as a sign of a highly neurologically advanced animal.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 47. The cerebral cortex is thinner, and the brain cells are larger and more densely packed and organised in the echidna than the platypus, suggesting evolutionary divergence must have occurred long ago. Almost half of the sensory area in the brain is devoted to the snout and tongue, and the part devoted to smell is relatively large compared to other animals. The short-beaked echidna has the largest prefrontal cortex relative to body size of any mammal, taking up 50% of the volume in comparison to 29% for humans.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 48. This part of the brain in humans is thought to be used for planning and analytical behaviour, leading to debate as to whether the echidna has reasoning and strategising ability.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 48‚Äì50. Experiments in a simple maze and with a test on opening a trap door to access food, and the echidna's ability to remember what it has learnt for over a month, has led scientists to conclude its learning ability is similar to that of a cat or a rat.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 50‚Äì51. The echidna shows rapid eye movement during sleep, usually around its thermoneutral temperature of 25 ¬∞C, and this effect is suppressed at other temperatures. Its brain has been shown to contain a claustrum similar to that of placental mammals, linking this structure to their common ancestor. Ecology and behaviour A short- beaked echidna in French Island National Park building a defensive burrow (video 0:43s) No systematic study of the ecology of the short-beaked echidna has been published, but studies of several aspects of their ecological behaviour have been conducted. They live alone, and, apart from the burrow created for rearing young, they have no fixed shelter or nest site. They do not have a home territory they defend against other echidnas, but range over a wide area. The range area has been observed to be between 21 and 93 ha, although one study in Kangaroo Island found the animals there covered an area between 9 and 192 ha. Overall, the mean range areas across the various regions of Australia were 40‚Äì60 ha. There was no correlation between gender and range area, but a weak one with size. Echidnas can share home ranges without incident, and sometimes share shelter sites if not enough are available for each animal to have one individually.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 91‚Äì92. Short-beaked echidnas are typically active in the daytime, though they are ill-equipped to deal with heat because they have no sweat glands and do not pant. Therefore, in warm weather, they change their patterns of activity, becoming crepuscular or nocturnal. Body temperatures above 34 ¬∞C (93 ¬∞F) are believed to be fatal, and in addition to avoiding heat, the animal adjusts its circulation to maintain a sustainable temperature by moving blood to and from the skin to increase or lower heat loss. In areas where water is present, they can also swim to keep their body temperatures low. The \\"thermoneutral zone\\" for the environment is around 25 ¬∞C (77 ¬∞F), at which point the metabolism needed to maintain body temperature is minimized. The echidna is endothermic, and can maintain body temperatures of around 32 ¬∞C.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 112. It can also reduce its metabolism and heart rate and body temperature.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 107. In addition to brief and light bouts of torpor throughout the year, the echidna enters periods during the Australian winter when it hibernates,Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 108. both in cold regions and in regions with more temperate climates. During hibernation, the body temperature drops to as low as 4 ¬∞C (39 ¬∞F). The heart rate falls to four to seven beats per minute‚Äîdown from 50‚Äì68 at rest‚Äîand the echidna can breathe as infrequently as once every three minutes, 80 to 90% slower than when it is active. Metabolism can drop to one-eighth of the normal rate.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 109. Echidnas begin to prepare for hibernation between February and April, when they reduce their consumption and enter brief periods of torpor. Males begin hibernating first, while females that have reproduced start later. During periods of hibernation, the animals average 13 separate bouts of torpor, which are broken up by periods of arousal lasting 1.2 days on average. These interruptions tend to coincide with warmer periods. Males end their hibernation period in mid-June, while reproductive females return to full activity in July and August; nonreproductive females and immature echidnas may not end hibernation until two months later. During euthermia, the body temperature can vary by 4 ¬∞C per day. The metabolic rate is around 30% of that of placental mammals, making it the lowest energy-consuming mammal. This figure is similar to that of other animals that eat ants and termites;Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 113. burrowing animals also tend to have low metabolism generally.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 114. Echidnas hibernate even though it is seemingly unnecessary for survival; they begin their hibernation period while the weather is still warm, and food is generally always plentiful.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 110. One explanation is that echidnas maximize their foraging productivity by exercising caution with their energy reserves. Another hypothesis is that they are descended from ectothermic ancestors, but have taken to periodic endothermy for reproductive reasons, so that the young can develop more quickly. Supporters of this theory argue that males hibernate earlier than females because they finish their contribution to reproduction first, and they awake earlier to undergo spermatogenesis in preparation for mating, while females and young lag in their annual cycle. During the hibernation period, the animals stay in entirely covered shelter.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 111. Australian National Botanic Garden, Canberra Short- beaked echidnas can live anywhere with a good supply of food, and regularly feast on ants and termites. They are believed to locate food by smell, using sensors in the tips of their snouts, by shuffling around seemingly arbitrarily, and using their snout in a probing manner. A study of echidnas in New England (New South Wales) has shown that they tend to dig up scarab beetle larvae in spring when the prey are active, but eschew this prey when it is inactive, leading to the conjecture that echidnas detect prey using hearing.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 99. Vision is not believed to be significant in hunting, as blind animals have been observed to survive in the wild. Echidnas use their strong claws to pull apart nests and rotting logs to gain access to their prey.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 95. They avoid ants and termites that secrete repulsive liquids, and have a preference for the eggs, pupae and winged phases of the insects.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 96‚Äì97. Echidnas hunt most vigorously towards the end of the southern winter and early in spring, when their fat reserves have been depleted after hibernation and nursing.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 97. At this time, ants have high body fat, and the echidna targets their mounds. The animal also hunts beetles and earthworms, providing they are small enough to fit in a 5-mm gap. The proportion of ants and termites in their diets depends on the availability of prey, and termites make up a larger part in drier areas where they are more plentiful.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 98. However, termites are preferred, if available, as their bodies contain a smaller proportion of indigestible exoskeleton. Termites from the Rhinotermitidae family are avoided due to their chemical defences. Scarab beetle larvae are also a large part of the diet when and where available. In the New England study, 37% of the food intake consisted of beetle larvae, although the echidna had to squash the prey in its snout as it ingested it, due to size. Echidnas are powerful diggers, using their clawed front paws to dig out prey and create burrows for shelter. They may rapidly dig themselves into the ground if they cannot find cover when in danger. They bend their belly together to shield the soft, unprotected part, and can also urinate, giving off a pungent liquid, in an attempt to deter attackers. Males also have single small spurs on each rear leg, believed to be a defensive weapon that has since been lost through evolution. Echidnas typically try to avoid confrontation with predators. Instead, they use the colour of their spines, which is similar to the vegetation of the dry Australian environment, to avoid detection. They have good hearing and tend to become stationary if sound is detected. It is likely that Echidnas are keystone species in the ecosystem health in Australia, due to their contribution through bioturbation, the reworking of soils through their digging activity. This is based on the estimation that a single echidna will move up to 204 m3 of soil a year, that it is the most widespread of any terrestrial Australian species, is relatively common, and that other bioturbators have been heavily impacted by human settlement. In Australia, they are most common in forested areas with abundant, termite-filled, fallen logs. In agricultural areas, they are most likely to be found in uncleared scrub; they may be found in grassland, arid areas, and in the outer suburbs of the capital cities. Little is known about their distribution in New Guinea. They have been found in southern New Guinea between Merauke in the west and the Kelp Welsh River, east of Port Moresby, in the east, where they may be found in open woodland. Echidnas have the ability to swim, and have been seen cooling off near dams during high temperatures. They have also been seen crossing streams and swimming for brief periods in seas off Kangaroo Island. They swim with only the snout above water, using it as a snorkel.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 92. =Reproduction= The solitary short-beaked echidna looks for a mate between May and September; the precise timing of the mating season varies with geographic location.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 77. In the months before the mating season, the size of the male's testes increases by a factor of three or more before spermatogenesis occurs.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 80. Both males and females give off a strong, musky odour during the mating season, by turning their cloacas inside out and wiping them on the ground, secreting a glossly liquid believed to be an aphrodisiac. During courtship‚Äîobserved for the first time in 1989‚Äîmales locate and pursue females. Trains of up to 10 males, often with the youngest and smallest male at the end of the queue, may follow a single female in a courtship ritual that may last for up to four weeks; the duration of the courtship period varies with location. During this time, they forage for food together, and the train often changes composition, as some males leave and other join the pursuit.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 78. In cooler parts of their range, such as Tasmania, females may mate within a few hours of arousal from hibernation. Before mating, the male smells the female, paying particular attention to the cloaca. This process can take a few hours, and the female can reject the suitor by rolling herself into a ball. After prodding and sniffing her back, the male is often observed to roll the female onto her side and then assume a similar position himself so the two animals are abdomen to abdomen, having dug a small crater in which to lie. They can lie with heads facing one another, or head to rear.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 81. If more than one male is in the vicinity, fighting over the female may occur. Each side of the bilaterally symmetrical, rosette-like, four-headed penis (similar to that of reptiles and in length) is used alternately, with the other half being shut down between ejaculations. Sperm bundles of around 100 each appear to confer increased sperm motility, which may provide the potential for sperm competition between males. This process takes between a half and three hours. Each mating results in the production of a single egg, and females are known to mate only once during the breeding season; each mating is successful. Fertilisation occurs in the oviduct. Gestation takes between 21 and 28 days after copulation, during which time the female constructs a nursery burrow. Following the gestation period, a single, rubbery-skinned egg between in diameter and in weightAugee, Gooden and Musser, p. 84. is laid from her cloaca directly into a small, backward-facing pouch that has developed on her abdomen. The egg is ovoid, leathery, soft, and cream-coloured. Between laying and hatching, some females continue to forage for food, while others dig burrows and rest there until hatching. Ten days after it is laid, the egg hatches within the pouch. The embryo develops an \\"egg tooth\\" during incubation, which it uses to tear open the egg; the tooth disappears soon after hatching.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 85. Hatchlings are about long and weigh between . After hatching, young echidnas are known as \\"puggles\\". Although newborns are still semitranslucent and still surrounded by the remains of the egg yolk, and the eyes are still barely developed, they already have well-defined front limbs and digits that allow them to climb on their mothers' bodies. Hatchlings attach themselves to their mothers' milk areolae, specialised patches on the skin that secrete milk‚Äîmonotremes lack nipples‚Äîthrough about 100‚Äì150 pores. The puggles were thought to have imbibed the milk by licking the mother's skin, but they are now thought to feed by sucking the areolae. They have been observed ingesting large amounts during each feeding period, and mothers may leave them unattended in the burrow for between five and ten days to find food.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 86. Studies of captives have shown they can ingest milk once every two or three days and then increase their mass by 20% in one milk- drinking session lasting between one and two hours. Around 40% of the milk weight is converted into body mass, and as such, a high proportion of milk is converted into growth; a correlation with the growth of the puggle and its mother's size has been observed. By the time the puggle is around , it is left in the burrow while the mother forages for food, and it reaches around after around two months. Juveniles are eventually ejected from the pouch at around two to three months of age, because of the continuing growth in the length of their spines. During this period, the young are left in covered burrows while the mothers forage, and the young are often preyed upon. Suckling gradually decreases until juveniles are weaned at about six months of age. The duration of lactation is about 200 days, and the young leave the burrow after 180 to 205 days, usually in January or February, at which time they weigh around . There is no contact between the mother and young after this point.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 88. The composition of the milk secreted by the mother changes over time. At the moment of birth, the solution is dilute and contains 1.25% fat, 7.85% protein, and 2.85% carbohydrates and minerals. Mature milk has much more concentrated nutrients, with 31.0, 12.4 and 2.8% of the aforementioned nutrients, respectively. Near weaning, the protein level continues to increase; this may be due to the need for keratin synthesis for hair and spines, to provide defences against the cold weather and predators.Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 86‚Äì87. The principal carbohydrate components of the milk are fucosyllactose and saialyllactose; it has a high iron content, which gives it a pink colour.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 87. The high iron content and low levels of free lactose differ from eutherian mammals. Lactose production is believed to proceed along the same lines as in the platypus. The age of sexual maturity is uncertain, but may be four to five years. A 12-year field study found the short-beaked echidna reaches sexual maturity between five and 12 years of age, and the frequency of reproduction varies from once every two years to once every six years. In the wild, the short-beaked echidna has an average lifespan of 10 years, though they can live as long as 40. The longest-lived specimen reached 49 years of age in a zoo in Philadelphia.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 93. In contrast to other mammals, echidna rates of reproduction and metabolism are lower, and they live longer, as though in slow motion, something caused, at least in part, by their low body temperature, which rarely exceeds 33 ¬∞C, even when they are not hibernating. Like its fellow monotreme the platypus, the short-beaked echidna has a system of multiple sex chromosomes, in which males have four Y chromosomes and five X chromosomes. Males appear to be X1Y1X2Y2X3Y3X4Y4X5 (figure), while females are X1X1X2X2X3X3X4X4X5X5. Weak identity between chromosomes results in meiotic pairing that yields only two possible genotypes of sperm, X1X2X3X4X5 or Y1Y2Y3Y4, thus preserving this complex system. Conservation status A short-beaked echidna on the move The short-beaked echidna is common throughout most of temperate Australia and lowland New Guinea, and is not listed as endangered. In Australia, it remains widespread across a wide range of conditions, including urban outskirts, coastal forests and dry inland areas, and is especially widespread in Tasmania and on Kangaroo Island. The most common threats to the animal in Australia are motor vehicles and habitat destruction, which have led to localized extinctions.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 120. In Australia, the number of short-beaked echidnas has been less affected by land clearance than have some other species, since they do not require a specialized habitat beyond a good supply of ants and termites. As a result, they can survive in cleared land if the cut-down wood is left in the area, as the logs can be used as shelters and sources of insects. However, areas where the land has been completely cleared for single crops that can be mechanically harvested, such as wheat fields, have seen extinctions. Over a decade-long period, around one-third of echidna deaths reported to wildlife authorities in Victoria were due to motor vehicles, and the majority of wounded animals handed in were traffic accident victims. Studies have shown they often choose to traverse drainage culverts under roads, so this is seen as a viable means of reducing deaths on busy roads in rural areas or national parks where the animals are more common. Despite their spines, they are preyed on by birds of prey, the Tasmanian devil, dingoes, snakes, lizards, goannas, cats, and foxes,Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 120‚Äì121. although almost all victims are young. Goannas are known for their digging abilities and strong sense of smell, and are believed to have been the main predators of the echidna before the introduction of eutherian mammals. Dingoes are known to kill echidnas by rolling them over onto their backs and attacking their underbellies. A tracking study of a small number of echidnas on Kangaroo Island concluded that goannas and cats were the main predators, although foxes‚Äîabsent in Kangaroo Island‚Äîwould be expected to be a major threat. They were eaten by indigenous Australians and the early European settlers of Australia. Hunting and eating of the echidna in New Guinea has increased over time and caused a decline in the population and distribution areas; it is now believed to have disappeared from highland areas. The killing of echidnas was a taboo in traditional culture, but since the tribespeople have become increasingly Westernised, hunting has increased, and the animals have been more easily tracked down due to the use of dogs.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 119. Infection with the introduced parasitic tapeworm Spirometra erinaceieuropaei is considered fatal for the echidna. This waterborne infection is contracted through sharing drinking areas with infected dogs, foxes, cats, and dingos, which do not die from the parasite. The infection is seen as being more dangerous in drier areas, where more animals are sharing fewer bodies of water, increasing the chance of transmission.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 121. The Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland runs an Australia-wide survey, called Echidna Watch, to monitor the species. Echidnas are also known to be affected by other tapeworms, protozoans and herpes-like viral infections, but little is known of how the infections affect the health of the animals or the populations.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 122. Although it is considered easy to keep echidnas healthy in captivity,Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 122‚Äì125. breeding is difficult, partly due to the relatively infrequent cycle. In 2009, Perth Zoo managed to breed some captive short- beaked echidnas, and in 2015 the first zoo-born echidnas were successfully bred there. Until 2006, only five zoos have managed to breed short-beaked echidnas, but no captive-bred young have survived to maturity.Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 126. Of these five institutions, only one in Australia‚ÄîSydney's Taronga Zoo‚Äîmanaged to breed echidnas, in 1977. The other four cases occurred in the Northern Hemisphere, two in the United States and the others in western Europe. In these cases, breeding occurred six months out of phase compared to Australia, after the animals had adapted to Northern Hemisphere seasons. The failure of captive breeding programs has conservation implications for the endangered species of echidna from the genus Zaglossus, and to a lesser extent for the short-beaked echidna. Cultural references Short-beaked echidnas feature in the animistic culture of indigenous Australians, including their visual arts and stories. The species was a totem for some groups, including the Noongar people from Western Australia. Many groups have myths about the animal; one myth explains it was created when a group of hungry young men went hunting at night and stumbled across a wombat. They threw spears at the wombat, but lost sight of it in the darkness. The wombat adapted the spears for its own defence and turned into an echidna.Robinson, R. 1966. Aboriginal Myths and Legends. Sun Books, Melbourne The short-beaked echidna is an iconic animal in contemporary Australia, notably appearing on the Australian five- cent coin (the smallest denomination), and on a A$200 commemorative coin released in 1992. The anthropomorphic echidna Millie was a mascot for the 2000 Summer Olympics. See also Echidna * Fauna of Australia * List of monotremes and marsupials Cited references Works cited Augee, M.

With stabilized ylides (R3 = ester or ketone), the (E)-alkene is formed with high selectivity. The (E)/(Z) selectivity is often poor with semistabilized ylides (R3 = aryl). To obtain the (E)-alkene for unstabilized ylides, the Schlosser modification of the Wittig reaction can be used. Alternatively, the Julia olefination and its variants also provide the (E)-alkene selectively. Ordinarily, the Horner‚ÄìWadsworth‚ÄìEmmons reaction provides the (E)-enoate (Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ester), just as the Wittig reaction does. To obtain the (Z)-enoate, the Still-Gennari modification of the Horner- Wadsworth-Emmons reaction can be used. Reaction mechanism =Classical mechanism= The steric bulk of the ylide 1 influences the stereochemical outcome of nucleophilic addition to give a predominance of the betaine 3 (cf. B√ºrgi‚ÄìDunitz angle). Note that for betaine 3 both R1 and R2 as well as PPh3+ and O‚àí are positioned anti to one another. Carbon-carbon bond rotation gives the betaine 4, which then forms the oxaphosphetane 5. Elimination gives the desired Z-alkene 7 and triphenylphosphine oxide 6. With simple Wittig reagents, the first step occurs easily with both aldehydes and ketones, and the decomposition of the betaine (to form 5) is the rate-determining step. However, with stabilised ylides (where R1 stabilises the negative charge) the first step is the slowest step, so the overall rate of alkene formation decreases and a bigger proportion of the alkene product is the E-isomer. This also explains why stabilised reagents fail to react well with sterically hindered ketones. The mechanism of the Wittig reaction =Mechanism= Mechanistic studies have focused on unstabilized ylides, because the intermediates can be followed by NMR spectroscopy. The existence and interconversion of the betaine (3a and 3b) is subject of ongoing research. For lithium-free Wittig reactions, most recent studies support a concerted formation of the oxaphosphetane without intervention of a betaine. In particular, phosphonium ylides 1 react with carbonyl compounds 2 via a [2+2] cycloaddition that is sometimes described as having [œÄ2s+œÄ2a] topology to directly form the oxaphosphetanes 4a and 4b. Under lithium-free conditions, the stereochemistry of the product 5 is due to the kinetically controlled addition of the ylide 1 to the carbonyl 2. When lithium is present, there may be equilibration of the intermediates, possibly via betaine species 3a and 3b.Bruce E. Maryanoff, A. B. Reitz, M. S. Mutter, R. R. Inners, and H. R.

Reitz identified the issue about equilibration of Wittig intermediates and termed the process \\"stereochemical drift\\". For many years, the stereochemistry of the Wittig reaction, in terms of carbon-carbon bond formation, had been assumed to correspond directly with the Z/E stereochemistry of the alkene products. However, certain reactants do not follow this simple pattern. Lithium salts can also exert a profound effect on the stereochemical outcome.A. B. Reitz, S. O. Nortey, A. D. Jordan, Jr., M. S. Mutter, and Bruce E. Maryanoff, \\"Dramatic Concentration Dependence of Stereochemistry in the Wittig Reaction. Examination of the Lithium-Salt Effect\\", J. Org. Chem., 51, 3302‚Äì3308 (1986) The mechanism of the Wittig reaction Mechanisms differ for aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and for aromatic and aliphatic phosphonium ylides. Evidence suggests that the Wittig reaction of unbranched aldehydes under lithium-salt-free conditions do not equilibrate and are therefore under kinetic reaction control. E. Vedejs has put forth a theory to explain the stereoselectivity of stabilized and unstabilized Wittig reactions.Vedejs, E.; Peterson, M. J. Top. Stereochem. 1994, 21, 1. Strong evidence indicated that under Li-free conditions, Wittig reactions involving unstabilized (R1= alkyl, H), semistabilized (R1 = aryl), and stabilized (R1 = EWG) Wittig reagents all proceed via a [2+2]/retro-[2+2] mechanism under kinetic control, with oxaphosphetane as the one and only intermediate. Wittig reagents [Ph3PCH3]+Br‚àí, typical phosphonium salt. = Preparation= Simple phosphoranes typically hydrolyze and oxidize readily. They are therefore prepared using air-free techniques. Phosphoranes are more air-stable when they contain an electron withdrawing group attached to the carbon. Some examples are Ph3P=CHCO2R and Ph3P=CHPh. These ylides are sufficiently stable to be sold commercially. Wittig reagents are usually prepared from a phosphonium salt, which is in turn prepared by the quaternization of triphenylphosphine with an alkyl halide. The alkylphosphonium salt is deprotonated with a strong base such as n-butyllithium: :[Ph3P+CH2R]X‚àí \\\\+ C4H9Li ‚Üí Ph3P=CHR + LiX + C4H10 Besides n-butyllithium (nBuLi), other strong bases like sodium and potassium t-butoxide (tBuONa, tBuOK), lithium, sodium and potassium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS, NaHMDS, KHDMS, where HDMS = N(SiMe3)2), or sodium hydride (NaH) are also commonly used. For stabilized Wittig reagents bearing conjugated electron-withdrawing groups, even relatively weak bases like aqueous sodium hydroxide or potassium carbonate can be employed. The identification of a suitable base is often an important step when optimizing a Wittig reaction. Because phosphonium ylides are seldom isolated, the byproduct(s) generated upon deprotonation essentially plays the role of an additive in a Wittig reaction. As a result, the choice of base has a strong influence on the efficiency and, when applicable, the stereochemical outcome of the Wittig reaction. One of the simplest ylide is methylenetriphenylphosphorane (Ph3P=CH2). It is also a precursor to more elaborate Wittig reagents. Alkylation of Ph3P=CH2 with a primary alkyl halide R‚àíCH2‚àíX, produces substituted phosphonium salts: :Ph3P=CH2 \\\\+ RCH2X ‚Üí Ph3P\\\\+ CH2CH2R X‚àí These salts can be deprotonated in the usual way to give Ph3P=CH‚àíCH2R. =Structure of the ylide= Ball-and-stick model of Ph3P=CH2, as found in the crystal structure The Wittig reagent may be described in the phosphorane form (the more familiar representation) or the ylide form: 300px The ylide form is a significant contributor, and the carbon atom is nucleophilic. Scope and limitations The Wittig reaction is a popular method for the synthesis of alkene from ketones and aldehydes. The Wittig reagent can generally tolerate carbonyl compounds containing several kinds of functional groups such as OH, OR, aromatic nitro and even ester groups . There can be a problem with sterically hindered ketones, where the reaction may be slow and give poor yields, particularly with stabilized ylides, and in such cases the Horner‚ÄìWadsworth‚ÄìEmmons (HWE) reaction (using phosphonate esters) is preferred. Another reported limitation is the often labile nature of aldehydes which can oxidize, polymerize or decompose. In a so-called tandem oxidation- Wittig process the aldehyde is formed in situ by oxidation of the corresponding alcohol. As mentioned above, the Wittig reagent itself is usually derived from a primary alkyl halide. Quaternization of triphenylphosphine with most secondary halides is inefficient. For this reason, Wittig reagents are rarely used to prepare tetrasubstituted alkenes. However the Wittig reagent can tolerate many other variants. It may contain alkenes and aromatic rings, and it is compatible with ethers and even ester groups. Even C=O and nitrile groups can be present if conjugated with the ylide- these are the stabilised ylides mentioned above. Bis-ylides (containing two P=C bonds) have also been made and used successfully. One limitation relates to the stereochemistry of the product. With simple ylides, the product is usually mainly the Z-isomer, although a lesser amount of the E-isomer is often formed also ‚Äì this is particularly true when ketones are used. If the reaction is performed in dimethylformamide in the presence of lithium iodide or sodium iodide, the product is almost exclusively the Z-isomer. If the E-isomer is the desired product, the Schlosser modification may be used. With stabilised ylides the product is mainly the E-isomer, and this same isomer is also usual with the HWE reaction. =Schlosser modification= The Schlosser variant of the Wittig reaction The main limitation of the traditional Wittig reaction is that the reaction proceeds mainly via the erythro betaine intermediate, which leads to the Z-alkene. The erythro betaine can be converted to the threo betaine using phenyllithium at low temperature. This modification affords the E-alkene. Allylic alcohols can be prepared by reaction of the betaine ylide with a second aldehyde. For example: An example of the Schlosser variant of the Wittig reaction Examples Two examples of the Wittig reaction using methylenetriphenylphosphorane Because of its reliability and wide applicability, the Wittig reaction has become a standard tool for synthetic organic chemists. The most popular use of the Wittig reaction is for the introduction of a methylene group using methylenetriphenylphosphorane (Ph3P=CH2). Using this reagent, even a sterically hindered ketone such as camphor can be converted to its methylene derivative. In this case, the Wittig reagent is prepared in situ by deprotonation of methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide with potassium tert- butoxide.Fitjer, L.; Quabeck, U. Synthetic Communications 1985, 15(10), 855‚Äì864. In another example, the phosphorane is produced using sodium amide as a base, and this reagent converts the aldehyde shown into alkene I in 62% yield. The reaction is performed in cold THF, and the sensitive nitro, azo and phenoxide groups are tolerated. The product can be used to incorporate a photostabiliser into a polymer, to protect the polymer from damage by ultraviolet radiation. Another example of its use is in the synthesis of leukotriene A methyl ester. The first step uses a stabilised ylide, where the carbonyl group is conjugated with the ylide preventing self condensation, although unexpectedly this gives mainly the cis product. The second Wittig reaction uses a non-stabilised Wittig reagent, and as expected this gives mainly the cis product. Note that the epoxide and ester functional groups survive intact. An example of the use of the Wittig reaction in synthesis, making leukotriene A methyl ester Methoxymethylenetriphenylphosphine is a Wittig reagent for the homologation of aldehydes and ketones. After the Wittig reaction, hydrolysis of the methoxyalkene gives an enol, which tautomerizes to an aldehyde. History The Wittig reaction was reported in 1954 by Georg Wittig and his coworker Ulrich Sch√∂llkopf. In part for this contribution, Wittig was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1979.

It plays an important role in improving cache performance and making effective use of parallel processing capabilities. Most execution time of a scientific program is spent on loops; as such, many compiler optimization techniques have been developed to make them faster.  Representation of computation and transformations  Since instructions inside loops can be executed repeatedly, it is frequently not possible to give a bound on the number of instruction executions that will be impacted by a loop optimization. This presents challenges when reasoning about the correctness and benefits of a loop optimization, specifically the representations of the computation being optimized and the optimization(s) being performed.In the book Reasoning About Program Transformations, Jean- Francois Collard discusses in depth the general question of representing executions of programs rather than program text in the context of static optimization.  Optimization via a sequence of loop transformations  Loop optimization can be viewed as the application of a sequence of specific loop transformations (listed below or in Compiler transformations for high- performance computingDavid F. Bacon, Susan L. Graham, and Oliver J. Sharp. Compiler transformations for high-performance computing. Report No. UCB/CSD 93/781, Computer Science Division-EECS, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, November 1993 (available at CiteSeer ). Introduces compiler analysis such as data dependence analysis and interprocedural analysis, as well as a very complete list of loop transformations) to the source code or intermediate representation, with each transformation having an associated test for legality. A transformation (or sequence of transformations) generally must preserve the temporal sequence of all dependencies if it is to preserve the result of the program (i.e., be a legal transformation). Evaluating the benefit of a transformation or sequence of transformations can be quite difficult within this approach, as the application of one beneficial transformation may require the prior use of one or more other transformations that, by themselves, would result in reduced performance. Common loop transformations include: * Fission or distribution ‚Äì loop fission attempts to break a loop into multiple loops over the same index range, but each new loop takes only part of the original loop's body. This can improve locality of reference, both of the data being accessed in the loop and the code in the loop's body. * Fusion or combining ‚Äì this combines the bodies of two adjacent loops that would iterate the same number of times (whether or not that number is known at compile time), as long as they make no reference to each other's data. * Interchange or permutation ‚Äì these optimizations exchange inner loops with outer loops. When the loop variables index into an array, such a transformation can improve locality of reference, depending on the array's layout. * Inversion ‚Äì this technique changes a standard while loop into a do/while (a.k.a. repeat/until ) loop wrapped in an if conditional, reducing the number of jumps by two for cases where the loop is executed. Doing so duplicates the condition check (increasing the size of the code) but is more efficient because jumps usually cause a pipeline stall. Additionally, if the initial condition is known at compile-time and is known to be side- effect-free, the initial if-guard can be skipped. * Loop-invariant code motion ‚Äì this can vastly improve efficiency by moving a computation from inside the loop to outside of it, computing a value just once before the loop begins, if the resultant quantity of the calculation will be the same for every loop iteration (i.e., a loop-invariant quantity). This is particularly important with address-calculation expressions generated by loops over arrays. For correct implementation, this technique must be used with inversion, because not all code is safe to be moved outside the loop. * Parallelization ‚Äì this is a special case of automatic parallelization focusing on loops, restructuring them to run efficiently on multiprocessor systems. It can be done automatically by compilers (automatic parallelization) or manually (inserting parallel directives like OpenMP). * Reversal ‚Äì a subtle optimization that reverses the order in which values are assigned to the index variable. This can help eliminate dependencies and thus enable other optimizations. Certain architectures utilize looping constructs at assembly level that count in a single direction only (e.g., decrement-jump-if-not-zero [DJNZ]). * Scheduling ‚Äì this divides a loop into multiple parts that may be run concurrently on multiple processors. * Skewing ‚Äì this technique is applied to a nested loop iterating over a multidimensional array, where each iteration of the inner loop depends on previous iterations, and rearranges its array accesses so that the only dependencies are between iterations of the outer loop. * Software pipelining ‚Äì a type of out-of-order execution of loop iterations to hide the latencies of processor function units. * Splitting or peeling ‚Äì this attempts to simplify a loop or eliminate dependencies by breaking it into multiple loops which have the same bodies but iterate over different portions of the index range. A special case is loop peeling, which can simplify a loop with a problematic first iteration by performing that iteration separately before entering the loop. * Tiling or blocking ‚Äì reorganizes a loop to iterate over blocks of data sized to fit in the cache. * Vectorization ‚Äì attempts to run as many of the loop iterations as possible at the same time on a SIMD system. * Unrolling ‚Äì duplicates the body of the loop multiple times, in order to decrease the number of times the loop condition is tested and the number of jumps, which may degrade performance by impairing the instruction pipeline. Completely unrolling a loop eliminates all overhead (except multiple instruction fetches and increased program load time), but requires that the number of iterations be known at compile time (except in the case of Just-in- time compilation). Care must also be taken to ensure that multiple re- calculation of indexed variables is not a greater overhead than advancing pointers within the original loop. * Unswitching ‚Äì moves a conditional from inside a loop to outside of it by duplicating the loop's body, and placing a version of it inside each of the if and else clauses of the conditional. * Sectioning or strip-mining ‚Äì introduced for vector processors, loop-sectioning is a loop-transformation technique for enabling SIMD (single instruction, multiple data)-encodings of loops and improving memory performance. This involves each vector operation being done for a size less-than or equal-to the maximum vector length on a given vector machine. = The unimodular transformation framework = The unimodular transformation approachSteven S. Muchnick, Advanced Compiler Design and Implementation, 1997 Morgan Kaufmann. Section 20.4.2 discusses loop optimization. uses a single unimodular matrix to describe the combined result of a sequence of many of the above transformations. Central to this approach is the view of the set of all executions of a statement within n loops as a set of integer points in an n-dimensional space, with the points being executed in lexicographical order. For example, the executions of a statement nested inside an outer loop with index i and an inner loop with index j can be associated with the pairs of integers . The application of a unimodular transformation corresponds to the multiplication of the points within this space by the matrix. For example, the interchange of two loops corresponds to the matrix \\\\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\\\\\\\\\1&0\\\\end{bmatrix}. A unimodular transformation is legal if it preserves the temporal sequence of all dependencies; measuring the performance impact of a unimodular transformation is more difficult. Imperfectly nested loops and some transformations (such as tiling) do not fit easily into this framework. = The polyhedral or constraint-based framework = The polyhedral modelR. Allen and K. Kennedy. Optimizing Compilers for Modern Architectures. Morgan Kaufmann, 2002. handles a wider class of programs and transformations than the unimodular framework. The set of executions of a set of statements within a possibly imperfectly nested set of loops is seen as the union of a set of polytopes representing the executions of the statements. Affine transformations are applied to these polytopes, producing a description of a new execution order. The boundaries of the polytopes, the data dependencies, and the transformations are often described using systems of constraints, and this approach is often referred to as a constraint-based approach to loop optimization. For example, a single statement within an outer loop and an inner loop is executed once for each pair such that . Once again, a transformation is legal if it preserves the temporal sequence of all dependencies. Estimating the benefits of a transformation, or finding the best transformation for a given code on a given computer, remain the subject of ongoing research as of the time of this writing (2010).

Liner note essay. Cedille Records CDR055. Biography Sowande (pronounced 'shoh-WAHN-daye') http://www.namesite.com/content/sowande was born in Abeokuta, near Lagos, the son of Emmanuel Sowande, a priest and pioneer of Nigerian church music. As a child he sang in the Choir of the Cathedral Church of Christ. He studied at the C.M.S. Grammar School and at King's College, Lagos. The influence of his father and Dr T. K. Ekundayo Phillips (composer, organist and choirmaster) was an important factor in his early years. At that time, Sowande was a chorister and was introduced to new Yoruba works being introduced into the churches. During that period, he studied organ under Phillips (including works by Bach and European classical masters), and earned the Fellowship Diploma (FRCO) from the Royal College of Organists. At that time, he was also a bandleader, playing jazz and popular highlife music. All of these had considerable influence on his work. In 1934, Sowande went to London to study European classical and popular music. In 1936, he was solo pianist in a performance of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue. He also played as part of a pianist duo with Fats Waller, was theatre organist for the BBC, Choirmaster at Kingsway Hall and pianist in the 1936 production of Blackbirds. In 1939, he played the organ on recordings by popular singers Adelaide Hall and Vera Lynn. Later, he studied organ privately under Edmund Rubbra, George Oldroyd, and George Cunningham and became a Fellow of the Royal College of Organists in 1943, winning the Limpus, Harding and Read Prizes. He also won several prizes and obtained a Bachelor of Music degree at the University of London and became a Fellow of Trinity College of Music. He also worked as musical advisor for the Colonial Film Unit of the Ministry of Information during the Second World War, providing background music for educational films. From 1945, he was a renowned organist and choirmaster at the West London Mission of the Methodist Church until 1952, and a considerable amount of organ music dates from this period. These are based on Nigerian melodies that gave a special appeal to the Black members of his congregation in the early years of migration from the African continent and the Caribbean. During this time, he also became known as a dance pianist, bandleader, and Hammond organist, playing popular tunes of the day. Western and African ideas prevail in his music, which included organ works such as Yor√πb√° Lament, Obangiji, Kyrie, Gloria, Jesu Olugbala, and Oba Aba Ke Pe. Most of these show a strong influence from Anglican Church music, combined with Yoruba pentatonic melodies. His orchestral works include Six Sketches for Full Orchestra, A Folk Symphony, and African Suite for string orchestra, and show African rhythmic and harmonic characteristics. The final movement of African Suite became known to Canadian audiences as the theme of the popular CBC music programme Gilmour's Albums,\\"Fela Sowande (1905-1987)\\", African Heritage in Classical Music. and is now a Canadian orchestral standard.\\"Fela Sowande\\", PhilPaine.org, 10 September 2006. He also wrote a significant amount of secular and sacred choral music, mainly a cappella. Some of these works were composed during his period with the BBC Africa Service. He went back to Nigeria to scholarly work with the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation and later the University of Ibadan. He was appointed MBE in the 1955 Queen's Birthday Honours for his work in the Nigerian Broadcasting Service . In 1968 he moved to Howard University in Washington, D.C., then the University of Pittsburgh. In the last years of his life Sowande taught in the Department of Pan-African Studies at Kent State University, and lived in nearby Ravenna, Ohio with his wife, Eleanor McKinney, who was one of the founders of Pacifica Radio. He died in Ravenna and is buried in Randolph Township, Ohio. In addition to his position as a professor, Sowande also held the chieftaincy title of the Bariyo of Lagos. There is currently a move to set up a centre to research and promote his works, as many remain unpublished or are out of print.

In Spanish, some adverbs and cardinal and ordinal numbers have apocopations as well. * Adjectives  (\\"big, great\\") ‚Üí ‚Üí (feminine) (\\"great woman\\". However, if the adjective follows the noun, the final syllable remains, but the meaning may also change: , meaning \\"large woman\\")  (\\"good\\") ‚Üí ‚Üí (masculine) (\\"good man\\"; the final vowel remains in , with no accompanying change in meaning) * Adverbs  (\\"so much\\") ‚Üí (\\"so\\") ‚Üí (\\"so beautiful\\") * Cardinal numbers  (\\"one, a, an\\") ‚Üí ‚Üí (\\"a child\\")  (\\"hundred\\") ‚Üí ‚Üí (\\"One hundred years of solitude\\") * Ordinal numbers  (\\"first\\") ‚Üí ‚Üí (\\"first prize\\")  (\\"second\\") ‚Üí (\\"according to\\") ‚Üí (\\"according to him\\")  (\\"third\\") ‚Üí ‚Üí (\\"third place\\")  (\\"final\\") ‚Üí ‚Üí (\\"final day\\") Informal speech Various sorts of informal abbreviations might be classed as apocope: * English photograph ‚Üí photo * English brassiere ‚Üí bra * English animation ‚Üí Japanese () ‚Üí () * English synchronization ‚Üí sync, synch, syncro, or synchro * English Alexander ‚Üí Alex, Alec and so on with other hypocorisms * English clitoris ‚Üí clitZuckermann, Ghil'ad (2003), Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew.

The work follows the exploits of Spartacus, the leader of the slave uprising against the Romans known as the Third Servile War, although the ballet's storyline takes considerable liberties with the historical record. Khachaturian composed Spartacus in 1954, and was awarded a Lenin Prize for the composition that same year.Victor Yuzefovich Aram Khachaturyan, p.217 - New York: Sphinx Press, 1985 It was first staged, with choreography by Leonid Yakobson, in Leningrad 1956, but only with qualified success since Yakobson abandoned conventional pointe in his choreography.Yuzefovich, p.218 The ballet received its first staging at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow in 1958, choreographed by Igor Moiseyev; however it was the 1968 production, choreographed by Yury Grigorovich, which achieved the greatest acclaim for the ballet. It remains one of Khachaturian's best known works and is prominent within the repertoires of the Bolshoi Theatre and other ballet companies in Russia and the former Soviet Union. Synopsis Principal Characters: *Crassus, Roman consul *Spartacus, captive king of Thrace *Phrygia, wife of Spartacus *Aegina, concubine to Crassus =Act I= Ivan Vasiliev in an extract from Spartacus during re-opening gala of the Bolshoi Theatre, 28 October 2011 The Roman consul Crassus returns to Rome from his latest conquests in a triumphal procession. Among his captives are the Thracian king Spartacus and his wife Phrygia. Spartacus laments his captivity and bids a bitter farewell to Phrygia, who is taken off to join Crassus‚Äô harem of concubines. To entertain Crassus and his entourage, Spartacus is sent into the gladiatorial ring and is forced to kill a close friend. Horrified at his deed, Spartacus incites his fellow captives to rebellion. =Act II= The escaped captives celebrate their freedom. Meanwhile, Crassus entertains the Roman patricians with lavish entertainment. Spartacus and the other escaped captives disrupt the orgy and rescue the slave women, including Phrygia. Aegina insists that Crassus pursue the slave army immediately. The lovers celebrate their escape to the \\"Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia\\". =Act III= Aegina discovers Spartacus‚Äôs camp and observes the lovers emerging from their tent the next morning. Aegina sends word to Crassus, who sends his army in pursuit. Internecine struggles break out among Spartacus‚Äôs forces. Finally, Crassus‚Äôs forces discover Spartacus and impale him upon their spears. Spartacus‚Äôs closest followers recover his body and carry it off while Phrygia mourns her loss. Orchestral adaptation Khachaturian extracted and arranged music from the ballet in 1955 for four orchestral suites: *Spartacus Suite No.1 Introduction - Dance of the Nymphs Adagio of Aegina and Harmodius Variation of Aegina and Bacchanalia Scene and Dance with Crotala Dance of the Gaditanae - Victory of Spartacus *Spartacus Suite No.2 Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia Entrance of the Merchants - Dance of a Roman Courtesan - General Dance Entrance of Spartacus - Quarrel - Treachery of Harmodius Dance of the Pirates *Spartacus Suite No.3 Dance of a Greek Slave Dance of an Egyptian Girl Night Incident Dance of Phrygia - Parting Scene At the Circus *Spartacus Suite No.4 Bacchante's Melancholy Dance Spartacus Procession Death of the Gladiator Call to Arms - Spartacus' Uprising Instrumentation: 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons; 4 horns, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba; timpani, percussion ; strings. In popular culture Part of the \\"Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia\\" (the opening piece in Suite No. 2), was used as the main love theme in the 1968 film Mayerling; as the opening theme for the British television series The Onedin Line (1971‚Äì1980); in advertisements for Philips television sets in Australia in the late 1970s; and in The Hudsucker Proxy (1994). * Part of the \\"Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia\\" was used in the film Caligula (1979). A disco version of this theme with lyrics by the artist Lydia was released as a single from the soundtrack. * The adagio had several plays during the James Bond film Thunderball. * Portions of the ballet were performed by the Phantom Regiment Drum and Bugle Corps in 1981, 1982, and 2008 ‚Äì with the Corps winning the 2008 DCI World Championship title, performing their interpretation of the ballet. * In 1984, with words by Tony Hiller and Nicky Graham, it became a popular song, \\"Journey's End\\", recorded by Andy Williams on Capitol. * In 1990 Mexican rock band Caifanes used \\"Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia\\" for their hit song \\"Antes de que nos olviden\\" (Before We're Forgotten) from their album El Diablito. * In 2004, Ukrainian rhythmic gymnast Anna Bessonova performed her bronze medal ball routine at the Athens Olympics to an excerpt of the adagio. * The adagio is featured in 20th Century Fox's 2006 computer animated film Ice Age: The Meltdown. * Oksana Domnina and Maxim Shabalin won the 2009 World Figure Skating Championships Ice Dance competition with their free dance to the adagio. * Ashley Wagner won the 2015 U.S. Figure Skating Championships with her short program to the adagio.

After moving to Los Angeles and becoming a regular performer at the influential Hotel Cafe venue, Brothers first gained national attention with his song \\"Blue Eyes\\" on the Platinum-selling, Grammy-winning \\"Garden State\\" soundtrack. As an independent artist, he has since toured worldwide, released two full-length records, and become one of the most-licensed artists in film and television. In the electronic dance music world, Brothers has collaborated with Ti√´sto on a club remix of his song \\"Ride\\" and an original song for Tiesto's album Kaleidoscope, and he co-wrote and sang the title tracks for the Cosmic Gate releases Wake Your Mind and Start to Feel. History With songs influenced by everything from 1980s British new wave music to 1970s folk music, Brothers achieved early critical and commercial success with his independent EPs All the Rage (2004) and Waiting for Your Letter (2005), both of which reached the top of the iTunes Singer-Songwriter charts. During this early stage of his career, Brothers found much success on MySpace, where he amassed over 8 million plays and 100,000 fans on his music page. While many artists focus their efforts on radio exposure, Brothers went a slightly different route and pushed to get songs out to the public through film and television shows as part of a generation of similar-minded indie artists in the United States. Brothers' songs have appeared on the medical dramas Grey's Anatomy, Private Practice and ER, Scrubs, Cougar Town, the Fox mystery Bones, WB's Smallville, USA Network comedy Psych, ABC Family's show Kyle XY, One Tree Hill, Where We're Meant to Be, and the hit Emma Stone comedy Easy A. The original version of Brothers' song \\"Ride\\" appeared on the soundtrack to the feature film The Last Kiss alongside Coldplay and Ray Lamontagne. Brothers has also performed on The Late Late Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Direct TV's CD USA. In 2005, he made a guest appearance with the London artist Aqualung on the Late Show with David Letterman and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Brothers plays regularly as part of the musical community at the Hotel Caf√© in Los Angeles, and he has since toured across America and Canada with such acts as Greg Laswell, Sara Bareilles, Liz Phair, KT Tunstall, Aqualung, Ben Lee, Matt Nathanson, Imogen Heap, and The Fray. In addition to his career as a musician, he co-created The Hotel Cafe Tour, which ran for 4 years in both the U.S. and Europe. Brothers also co-produced Joshua Radin's first EP and the song \\"Winter\\" from Radin's record We Were Here. In 2007, Cary Brothers signed a record deal with indie label Bluhammock Music for the release of his first full-length album, Who You Are, on May 29, 2007, which made the Billboard Heatseekers Chart. Produced by Chad Fischer (Alexi Murdoch) and mixed by Greg Collins (Grammy Winner ‚Äì U2), the record features guest musicians Matt Hales from Aqualung and Priscilla Ahn. The video for the single \\"Ride\\" starring Brittany Snow was added to the rotation on VH1 in the U.S. In addition, the record won \\"Best Rock Album of 2007\\" by the Indie Acoustic Project. Brothers' track 'Ride' has also been mixed by Ti√´sto and was a success on the dancefloors of Europe in 2008. He helped close Friday night at Bonnaroo in the summer of 2008 by making a guest appearance with Ti√´sto and repeated this musical pairing a few months later at the O2 arena in London. In 2009, Brothers went into the studio to work on his second full-length record. In addition, that year he had an original track called \\"Here on Earth\\" on the Ti√´sto record Kaleidescope alongside Sigur R√≥s, Tegan and Sara, Kele Okereke, Priscilla Ahn and Emily Haines. Under Control was released on April 6, 2010, through Brothers' own Procrastination Music label and premiered at No. 1 on the iTunes Singer-Songwriter charts and No. 10 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart. Cary toured extensively in the United States in support of the record in 2010 and 2011 as both headliner and as an opening act for the Sara Bareilles tour. Staying active in social media, Brothers was named No. 14 on Paste Magazine's \\"50 Musicians Worth Following on Twitter\\" on August 2011. In May 2012, Brothers released a DIY collection of five cover songs entitled Covers Volume One, featuring songs by Yeah Yeah Yeahs, David Bowie, Duran Duran, INXS, and Matt & Kim. The EP also features guest vocals by Rachael Yamagata, Butterfly Boucher, and Priscilla Ahn. It premiered in the Top Ten on the iTunes Singer-Songwriter Chart.

Career Hofacker was born in Ludwigsburg; his father Eberhard von Hofacker was a general in World War I. Hofacker's main activity in relation to the events culminating in the attempted assassination of Hitler at the Wolf's Lair on 20 July 1944 consisted of acting as a secret liaison between his cousin, Claus Graf Schenk von Stauffenberg, and another plotter in occupied Paris, General Carl-Heinrich von St√ºlpnagel, France's military governor, to whom he was personal adviser. Hofacker assessed the chances of the coup attempt as \\"only ten percent\\".Joachim Fest, Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler, 1933‚Äì1945, 1996, p. 362. He had a point of introduction to Field Marshal Erwin Rommel as Rommel served under the Hofacker's father in World War I; Rommel considered the elder Hofacker something of a hero.Peter Hoffmann, The History of the German resistance, 1933-1945, McGill-Queen's Press, 1996, p. 354 Hofacker tried to draw Rommel into the plot to rid Germany of Hitler, but although Rommel gave his backing to the conspiracy Rommel did not agree that Hitler should be killed.William L. Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Simon and Schuster, 1960, p. 1047. On 26 July 1944, Hofacker was arrested in Paris, taken to Berlin Gestapo headquarters where, according to William Shirer in The Rise and Fall of the 3rd Reich, he was horrifically tortured and gave up the name of Erwin Rommel stating that Rommel said to \\"Tell the people in Berlin they can count on me\\".William L. Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Simon and Schuster, 1960, p. 1077. This was support for the conspiracy to overthrow Hitler, not to kill him- but this made no difference to Hitler who ordered the forced suicide of Erwin Rommel and false hero's funeral.William L. Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Simon and Schuster, 1960, p. 1078-1079. The torture confession was taken down and Hofacker was put on trial before the Volksgerichtshof.

The variable used in the inner loop switches to the outer loop, and vice versa. It is often done to ensure that the elements of a multi-dimensional array are accessed in the order in which they are present in memory, improving locality of reference. For example, in the code fragment: for i from 0 to 10 for j from 0 to 20 a[i,j] = i + j loop interchange would result in: for j from 0 to 20 for i from 0 to 10 a[i,j] = i + j On occasion, such a transformation may create opportunities to further optimize, such as automatic vectorization of the array assignments. The utility of loop interchange Illustration of row- and column-major order The major purpose of loop interchange is to take advantage of the CPU cache when accessing array elements. When a processor accesses an array element for the first time, it will retrieve an entire block of data from memory to cache. That block is likely to have many more consecutive elements after the first one, so on the next array element access, it will be brought directly from cache (which is faster than getting it from slow main memory). Cache misses occur if the contiguously accessed array elements within the loop come from a different cache block, and loop interchange can help prevent this. The effectiveness of loop interchange depends on and must be considered in light of the cache model used by the underlying hardware and the array model used by the compiler. In C programming language, array elements in the same row are stored consecutively in memory (a[1,1], a[1,2], a[1,3]) ‚Äí in row-major order. On the other hand, FORTRAN programs store array elements from the same column together (a[1,1], a[2,1], a[3,1]), using column-major. Thus the order of two iteration variables in the first example is suitable for a C program while the second example is better for FORTRAN. Optimizing compilers can detect the improper ordering by programmers and interchange the order to achieve better cache performance. Caveat Like any compiler optimization, loop interchange may lead to worse performance because cache performance is only part of the story. Take the following example: do i = 1, 10000 do j = 1, 1000 a[i] = a[i] + b[j,i] * c[i] end do end do Loop interchange on this example can improve the cache performance of accessing b(j,i), but it will ruin the reuse of a(i) and c(i) in the inner loop, as it introduces two extra loads (for a(i) and for c(i)) and one extra store (for a(i)) during each iteration. As a result, the overall performance may be degraded after loop interchange. Safety It is not always safe to exchange the iteration variables due to dependencies between statements for the order in which they must execute. To determine whether a compiler can safely interchange loops, dependence analysis is required.

History =Concept= In 1985, the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions came up with a new match to increase the fans' interest in their product. The Bunkhouse Stampede was a regular battle royal where the wrestlers wore \\"bunkhouse gear\\" (blue jeans and cowboy boots, etc.) to the match, similar to 'street fight' matches. Weapons were also allowed. For example, Ivan and Nikita Koloff brought their chains to the ring, and The Road Warriors brought their spikes, others used trash can lids and leather straps. To win this match, a wrestler had to be the last one in the ring, with all of the other wrestlers having been thrown over the top rope. These were most often bloody matches, as there were several weapons involved. Each year, there were several Bunkhouse Stampedes held in the prior weeks, with the winners of each one going to the final Bunkhouse Stampede to battle for the championship. They began in 1985, and the last was held in 1989, after which it was abandoned. The winner was awarded a large bronze cowboy boot. 1987 format The format was slightly different in 1987; rather than have all of the champions meet in a final match, it was decided that whoever won the most matches during the tour would be declared the champion. When Dusty Rhodes and Big Bubba Rogers ended up tied after the final match in San Francisco (itself marred by the fact that the last two wrestlers in the ring were The Road Warriors, but they tossed a coin and the loser jumped out of the ring), a two-man steel cage bunkhouse match (where one wrestler had to throw the other out of the cage) between the two determined the overall winner, over Jim Cornette's protests that Rogers should have been declared the winner because, while Rhodes had won as many of the matches, Rogers had won more money (because while most of the matches had $25,000 prizes, Rogers won a $100,000 match in Atlanta). =Broadcasts= Only one of the earlier Bunkhouse Stampedes, on December 28, 1985, was broadcast on NWA Television, but it was cut off after only a few minutes of action.

Sources The text is known from three partial manuscripts, and additional fragments, all of which are in Coptic. The text contains visions by Bartholomew, and acts of Thomas, but is predominantly about The Passion, and the Eucharist. The text seems to have no semblance of gnostic interpretations, and instead appears to be a text aiming to fill in the supernatural details of the Passion, and to emphasise the value and meaning of church liturgy. Contents The text starts with a description of Jesus' own rather gory comprehension of his own fate, i.e. the crucifixion. It is followed by a tale in which someone attempts to stand in for Jesus (i.e. die in his place), but the priests are initially unable to kill him, even though they try stoning and putting him in an oven. Subsequently, the text describes Jesus descending into hell, finding Judas Iscariot there, and preaching to him. Jesus then rescues everyone from hell, except for Judas, Cain, and Herod the Great. This is followed by a flashback described by a gardener to the night when angels, fiery chariots, and God, descended to earth, and resurrected Jesus. Bartholomew is present at the scene, and is shown the highest level of heaven so that he can see the liturgy going on there to celebrate the resurrection. Bartholomew then has a flashback about a divine visitation at the Mount of Olives. Meanwhile, Thomas is busy resurrecting Siophanes (possibly a transcription error and meant to read Theophanes), his son. On returning to life, Siophanes describes what the afterlife was like, while Thomas proceeds to baptise all of the amazed townsfolk, who number some 12,000. Finally, in order to witness the ascension of Jesus, Thomas is brought to the others via a cloud. At this point Thomas is surprised to see Jesus resurrected (despite having just brought his own son back to life), and celebrates the eucharist with the other apostles. Then they disperse to evangelise. External links Coptic Apocrypha in the dialect of Upper Egypt - pp. 14 ff.

In 1981 Marrus co-authored with Robert Paxton \\"Vichy France and the Jews\\" which demonstrated that the anti-semitism of Vichy France was endogenous to the region rather than imposed from without and that the Vichy government, which was spared occupation for a time, could sometimes be even more brutal than states which, unlike Vichy, were actually under Nazi occupation, especially in its role in organizing the deportation of Jews to death camps. Among Marrus' best-known books, The Holocaust in History (1987) applies the tools of historiographic analysis to the vast literature on the topic, attempting to elucidate such issues as the problems of the uniqueness and universalism of the Holocaust; public opinion regarding the Jews in Nazi Europe; anti-semitism as a factor in the origins of the Holocaust; Jewish resistance; the role of the Judenr√§te; bystanders; and role of the churches in the Holocaust. He has also written on the history of European refugee movements in the twentieth century, and the Holocaust-era restitution campaign of the 1990s.Yehuda Bauer, Book Review in [Oxford journal of] Holocaust and Genocide Studies (1988) 3 (3): 345-347 Marrus' most recent work, Lessons of the Holocaust, published in 2015, deals with the historical and moral controversies which infuse the interpretation of the Holocaust and its significance. In it, Marrus denies there can be any definitive set of lessons to be learned from the destruction of the European Jews and instead affirms that there are many ever-evolving questions that need to be continually studied and re-interpreted. His works have been translated into French, German, Polish, Hebrew, Portuguese, and Japanese. Role in International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission to Investigate the Holocaust In October 1999 Marrus was one of three Jewish scholars appointed to the International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission to investigate the role of the Pope Pius XII during the Holocaust. The commission was supposed to review and discuss the previously published Vatican records pertaining to the World War II period and report on their assessment. In October 2000 the Commission issued a preliminary report with 47 questions about the Vatican's response to the Holocaust. Thereupon, in 2001, the Vatican rebuffed the Commission's efforts to access Vatican archives of the Pontificate of Pius XII and the wartime period, and it subsequently disbanded amid controversy. In an interview in the Jerusalem Post Marrus expressed regret that the Commission had run \\"up against a brick wall\\" on the question of opening Vatican archives.Melissa Radler. \\"Vatican Blocks Panel's Access to Holocaust Archives.\\" The Jerusalem Post (July 24, 2001).  Massey College controversy  On September 26, 2017, at a lunch at Massey College, Hugh Segal, who then had the title of Master of Massey College, joined Marrus and other students at the table, including a black student. Marrus then remarked, \\"You know this is your 'Master,' eh? Do you feel the lash?\\" Marrus apologized for the comment and resigned from his position as a Senior Fellow of the college on October 1, 2017 in a letter to Segal, the head of the college, stating his \\"deepest regrets to all whom I may have harmed.\\" He added, \\"I am so sorry for what I said, in a poor effort at jocular humour... I want to assure those who heard me ‚Ä¶ that while I had no ill-intent whatsoever I can appreciate how those at the table and those who have learned about it could take offence at what I said.\\" Personal life In 1971, Marrus married Randi Greenstein; the couple has three children. Honors and awards Marrus' books have received many prizes and distinctions, including the 1982 National Jewish Book Award in the Holocaust category for Vichy France and the Jews and more recently, a Canadian Jewish Book Award for Lessons of the Holocaust. He has been a research fellow or has taught at St. Antony's College, Oxford, at Israel Institute for Advanced Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, at UCLA, and at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and the Royal Historical Society. In 2008 he became a member of the Order of Canada.

It was built by Guard-Lee in Apopka, Florida, installed at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in 1993, and moved to Space Center Houston in 2012. It was built using schematics, blueprints and archival documents provided by NASA and by shuttle contractors such as Rockwell International. While many of the features on the replica are simulated, some parts, including the landing gear's Michelin tires, have been used in the Space Shuttle program. The model is long, high, has a wingspan, and weighs . Kennedy Space Center Independence, then known as Explorer, was displayed at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex atop cement pilings and secured with steel cabling. Visitor access was provided by a gantry-style tower with ramps and an elevator for accessibility. Inside, visitors could view a mock-up payload, a mannequin wearing an early model of the orange launch/entry pressure suit used by shuttle astronauts, and a mock cockpit with controls and instruments. Adjacent to Explorer were two solid rocket boosters mated to a full-size mock-up of an external tank (originally used by Stennis Space Center for fit tests). Space Center Houston Clear Lake from Galveston Bay Independence on display at Space Center Houston Because KSC was to receive the retired Atlantis, Space Shuttle Explorer was removed from the KSC Visitor Center on December 11, 2011, and relocated to the Vehicle Assembly Building's turn basin dock adjacent to the Launch Complex 39 Press Site. The move was performed by Beyel Bros. using a 144-wheel trailer towed by truck. To accommodate the shuttle, several light poles and street signage along the route were taken down, and the shuttle itself was lifted by hydraulic jacks over a KSC guardhouse. The vehicle remained at the turn basin until May 24, 2012, when it began its move by barge to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center outside Houston, Texas. The replica shuttle was stripped of the name Explorer as part of the dismantling process. Upon arriving in the Houston area by barge on June 1, 2012, the shuttle was taken to the Johnson Space Center dock on Clear Lake, and preparations were made to move the shuttle to Space Center Houston during the early morning hours. As with Florida, several light poles along NASA Parkway were taken down and trees trimmed back to allow passage. The shuttle was moved by another 144-wheel trailer down the closed highway to the visitor center. Johnson Space Center hosted a celebration for the arrival of the replica. \\"Shuttlebration\\" events began on June 1, at the southeast corner of Clear Lake by the Nassau Bay Hilton Hotel. The festivities included the arrival of the shuttle at the dock and its move onto visitor center grounds. This was the largest item to arrive at the JSC dock since a Saturn V arrived for display in 1977. Space Center Houston announced on May 2, 2013, that it had acquired NASA 905, one of NASA's two modified Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. The center planned to display the replica shuttle atop the SCA with interiors of both vehicles accessible to visitors. A competition to name the shuttle opened on July 4, 2013, and concluded on September 2, 2013, with over 10,000 entries received. The winning entry was submitted by Timothy Judd, and the new name, Independence, was revealed on October 5, 2013. Independence underwent extensive renovation in 2013 and 2014 to repair damaged components and update its appearance to more closely match that of the modern shuttle fleet. Modifications include a re-skinning of the exterior, replica thermal tiles, publicly accessible mid-deck and payload bay, a glass cockpit on the flight deck, and display cases with shuttle program artifacts. On August 14, 2014, a heavy lift was completed to place Independence on top of NASA 905, which had been moved to Space Center Houston from Ellington Field on April 30, 2014.

An approximate date given to the Acts of Paul is 160 CE.. The Acts were first mentioned by Tertullian. Tertullian found it heretical because it encouraged women to preach and baptize. The Acts were considered orthodox by Hippolytus but were eventually regarded as heretical when the Manichaeans started using the texts. The author of the Acts of Paul is unknown and wrote out of respect for Paul in Asia Minor. The author does not show any dependency on the canonical Acts but uses oral traditions of Paul's missionary work. The text is primarily known from Greek manuscripts. The discovery of a Coptic version of the text demonstrated that the text was composed of *the Acts of Paul and Thecla *the Epistle of the Corinthians to Paul *the Third Epistle to the Corinthians *the Martyrdom of Paul ‚Äì his death at the hand of Nero All of these constituent parts were often considered worth treating as separate texts and frequently appeared independently, although scholars agree that they were originally part of the Acts of Paul. Besides the four main sections mentioned above, the remainder of the Acts exist only in fragments from the 3rd and 5th centuries: *The healing of Hermocrates from dropsy *The strife of the Ephesian beasts The texts are a coherent whole and are generally thought to have been written by one author using oral traditions, rather than basing it on any of the other apocrypha or the orthodox canon. The main emphasis of the text is on Chastity and anti-Gnosticism. According to Tertullian, the author was a priest in Asia Minor. While the priest encouraged female ministry, he expressed doctrinal orthodoxy in regard to continence and Resurrection. Also, they mentioned the close relationship of sexual purity and salvation. The Epistle of the Corinthians to Paul and the Third Epistle of the Corinthians both appear in some editions of the Armenian Bible. Overview Acts of Paul consists of the third letter to the Corinthians, an account of his martyrdom, and other narratives depicting his preaching and activity. There is a range of literature either about or purporting to be by Paul, including letters, narratives, prayers, and apocalypses. The pseudonymous Third Letter to the Corinthians claims to have been written from prison to correct the misinterpretations that his first and second letter had created. In his first letter to the Corinthians, he stated that \\"flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God\\" and this statement is related to the debates that ensued between the Gnostic and proto-orthodox Christians thereafter. A Christian who was concerned to emphasize that people would be physically resurrected, rather than merely spiritually, forged 3 Corinthians to counter Gnostic teachings. The Acts of Paul also appear to be familiar with the traditional account about the martyrdom of Peter, in which, having been arrested and condemned to death, Peter asked to be crucified head-down because he wasn't worthy of having the same death as Jesus.

It is situated on Toetoes Bay at the mouth of the Mataura River, and is on the far western edge of the Catlins. Nearby settlements include Otara to the southeast, Pukewao and Tokanui to the northeast, and Titiroa and Waimahaka to the north.  History  From 1834 to 1836, whalers lived at a station in the Fortrose area, and the first surveys for a town - slightly to the west of Fortrose's present location - gave it the name of Russelltown. In the mid-19th century, Fortrose acquired its current name, a tribute to Fortrose in Scotland, from a Scottish drover. Its location at the Mataura's mouth meant it developed as a port to service the local region, and in 1875, a long jetty was built. However, Fortrose's economy declined after the Tokanui Branch railway was opened to Waimahaka in 1899 and then Tokanui in 1911, as the railway provided much quicker transportation for freight to Invercargill.Catlins Promotions Association, \\"History - Fortrose\\" , accessed 15 November 2007. A number of Fortrose residents fought overseas in World War I and World War II. Six were killed in the former and two in the latter.

The Space Shuttle external tank and Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) would be combined with a cargo module that take the place of the Shuttle orbiter and include the main engines. Various Shuttle-C concepts were investigated between 1984 and 1995. The Shuttle-C concept would theoretically cut development costs for a heavy launch vehicle by re-using technology developed for the shuttle program. End-of-life and space Shuttle hardware would also have been used. One proposal even involved converting the Columbia or Enterprise into a single-use cargo launcher. Before the loss of Space Shuttle Challenger, NASA had expected about 14 shuttle flights a year. In the aftermath of the Challenger incident, it became clear that this launch rate was not feasible for a variety of reasons. With the Shuttle-C, it was thought that the lower maintenance and safety requirements for the uncrewed vehicle would allow a higher flight rate. The Shuttle-C would have been the main crew launch vehicle for the Piloted ILREC Lander in the International Lunar Resources Exploration Program. In the early 1990s, NASA engineers planning a crewed mission to Mars included a Shuttle-C design to launch six non reusable 80 ton segments to create two Mars ships in Earth orbit. After President George W. Bush called for the end of the Space Shuttle by 2010, these proposed configurations were put aside.

A gifted concert violinist of international repute, her considerable talents and reputation were eventually eclipsed by those of her lover, in whose shade she appeared content to remain. In return, Pound was more loyal, not to say faithful, to her than to any of his many other mistresses. He dedicated the final stanza of his epic The Cantos to her, in homage and gratitude for her courageous and loyal support of Pound during his 13-year incarceration in a mental hospital after having been indicted for treasonous activities against the United States and in support of Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime. She also defended Pound against the accusation that he was anti-Semitic. During the last 11 years of Pound's life, Rudge was his devoted companion, secretary, and nurse, as he sank into eccentricity and prolonged silences. Rudge survived Pound by twenty-four years, remaining in the small house in Venice she had shared with him. In her declining years, an ongoing difficult relationship with Mary, her only child, left her vulnerable to the attention of parties with ulterior motives, resulting in the sad situation described in John Berendt's The City of Falling Angels, in which Rudge could not account for how Pound's papers and letters in her possession had found their way to Yale University. Failing health eventually forced her to leave her beloved Venice and spend her final days with her daughter. Rudge died a month before her 101st birthday and is buried next to Pound in Venice's Isola di San Michele cemetery. Early life Rudge was born to J. Edgar Rudge, a real estate investor, and Julia (n√©e O'Connell) Rudge, a professional singer. Wanting to pursue a singing career, Julia moved to Europe with her three children when Olga was 10, living first in London then in Paris. Olga was educated at a convent school in Sherborne, Dorset, England, before studying in Paris under the violinist L√©on Caramb√¢t of the Op√©ra-Comique. By 1916, Rudge was a renowned concert violinist, performing in many concerts to raise money for the British and French side of the First World War. Her brother Arthur was killed in action in 1918. At the end of the war in 1918, she began her career as an international concert violinist, under the auspices of Ildebrando Pizzetti and his patroness Katherine Dalliba-John. In 1918, Pizzetti and Rudge did a joint concert tour of Italy, performing modern Italian music. Career Ezra Pound reviewed Olga Rudge's performance at the Aeolian Hall on November 1920.Rudge first met the poet Ezra Pound when he reviewed a concert Rudge gave at the Aeolian Hall in November 1920, admiring the \\"delicate firmness of her fiddling\\" yet criticising the \\"piano whack\\" of her accompanist Renata Borgatti. Rudge continued her association with Borgatti and pursuing her interest in modern Italian music, giving concerts with Borgatti and Pizzetti at the Sala Bach in Rome in 1921, and joining Renata Borgatti again at the Salle Pleyel in 1922. One of her first meetings with Pound took place in 1923, in Paris at the salon of Natalie Barney. Pound later recalled \\"her delicate and unemphatic reserve\\". At this time Pound was developing his own musical interests, composing an opera and advancing the work of American composer George Antheil. Antheil and Rudge were to enjoy a long professional collaboration dating from this period, which also marked the beginning of her sexual relationship with Pound. Rudge was now an established and successful soloist living in a luxurious apartment on Paris's ultrarespectable \\"right bank\\". She had nothing to gain by an association with a bohemian eccentric poet such as Pound, who was definitely \\"left bank\\" in his views and works. This willingness to flout convention and put her reputation at risk would typify her long affair with Pound. In December 1923, Rudge and Antheil gave a concert at the Salle du Conservatoire which included not only works by Mozart, Bach, and Antheil, but also Ezra Pound's \\"Sujet pour violin\\". For his work to be performed by a notable soloist was exactly the publicity Pound the aspiring composer desired. In 1924, Rudge and Antheil performed \\"Musique Americaine\\" at the Salle Pleyel. This concert also included work by Pound and Antheil's \\"Deuxieme Sonate\\", dedicated to Rudge. From 1923 onwards, Pound's letters to Rudge advise her on her career. He strongly recommended her to pay more attention to her patrons (something he himself never failed to do), and chided her for her lack of interest in the press comments concerning her concerts. By 1924, Pound and his wife, the former Dorothy Shakespear, had moved from Paris to Rapallo, Italy. Rudge, now in the full throes of her enduring love affair with Pound, visited him several times. From this time Pound seems to have divided his time equally between Rudge and his wife, a situation which was to continue until the Second World War. In the Spring of 1925, Rudge was forced to pull out of a planned concert tour of the United States as she was pregnant by Pound. On July 9, 1925, she gave birth to her daughter Mary at the local hospital in the city of Brixen in the province of South Tyrol. Keen to avoid the stigma an illegitimate child would have on her career, Rudge paid to have Mary looked after by a peasant family in the South Tyrolian village of Gais‚Äîa German-speaking village part of Italy. She remained unconcerned about the possible stigma of being the mistress of a married man, and her association with Pound continued unabated. She resumed her career with a concert at the Salle Pleyel in 1926, where she played in the premiere of Pound's new opera, Le Testament de Villon. Her association with Antheil continued with concerts in the capital cities of Europe, and at this time she began to specialise in the works of Mozart. She was now one of the most celebrated solo violinists of the era, playing before the Heads of State and political leaders of Europe. In 1928, Rudge's father bought her a small house in Venice, situated in the Calle Querini. Named \\"The Hidden Nest\\", it was to be her Venetian home for the remainder of her life. There, she began to develop her maternal instincts, bringing her daughter Mary for occasional visits. It was the beginning of a difficult and complex relationship between mother and daughter. Mary's existence was a closely guarded secret: Pound did not disclose it even to his own father until 1930. Pound often stayed with Rudge when their daughter visited Venice. However, the couple were often keen to be alone together, and so Rudge rented a Rapallo house near that of Pound and his wife, where the couple were able to conduct their affair unhindered by wife and children (Pound had a stepson, Omar, who was Dorothy's son by an unknown father, thought to be an Egyptian). The 1930s were the years of a global depression affecting all industries including the music industry. Most patrons and customers of concerts, venues, and performers were now often in financial difficulties themselves. To make ends meet, Rudge worked in 1933 as a secretary to Accademia Musicale in Siena. She also managed to continue her musical career, performing in the annual Concerti Tigulliani program organized by Pound at Rapallo. Around this time, Rudge and Pound became key figures in the Antonio Vivaldi revival. The 1936 Concerti Tigulliani program was devoted to Vivaldi, especially his lesser known works. To prepare for these concerts, Rudge studied many of Vivialdi's original scores kept in Turin. She attempted to organize a Vivaldi Society in Venice, without success. In 1938, she founded the \\"Centro di Studi Vivaldiani\\" at the \\"Accademia Chigiana\\", devoted to Vivaldi's work. Rudge and Pound were both keen readers of mystery and detective novels: this was the era of Agatha Christie, whose books earned her a fortune. Seeking to do the same, Pound and Rudge began in the 1930s, but never completed, a detective novel of their own; titled \\"The Blue Spill\\", it centred on the escapades of a Surrey detective. As World War II approached, Rudge limited her travel outside of Italy, last playing in London in 1935. By this time, Pound was vehemently pro-Mussolini and had begun broadcasting his views on Radio Rome, with Rudge's support. In 1941, they thought of returning to the U.S.A. for the duration of the war. Pound eventually decided against doing so, and they remained in Italy throughout the war. Pound's failure, at a crucial juncture, to declare his loyalty to his native country when it was at war, haunted him from the end of the war until the end of his life. As for Rudge, she had to live with the suspicion that she was the lover of a traitor to her country. War years The war years were difficult for the couple. After the United States entered the war, Pound and his wife Dorothy became enemy aliens in Italy, an ironic situation in light of Pound's support of Mussolini. Their home in Rapallo was sequestered in 1943 and the couple had little choice but to move in with Rudge. Thus the m√©nage √† trois for so long a matter of public speculation became a reality. Rudge sent her daughter back to Gais to live with her original peasant guardians, and was forced by necessity to support the Pounds and her daughter by giving language lessons. It was a very difficult time for the trio: while both women adored Pound, they hated each other. Pound's wife later wrote that \\"hatred and tension permeated the house\\". Following the United States' invasion of Italy in 1945, Pound was arrested as a traitor and was held in an open cage in Pisa for 25 days. His support for the Fascists and broadcasts for Rome radio led to an indictment for treason. Rudge too had been arrested. She was released after interrogation, but she was not permitted to correspond with her lover until several months later. She and Pound's wife are known to have once visited him during his detention. Although she was deprived of her lover, the end of the war saw an improvement in Rudge's fortunes as her sequestered Venetian home was returned to her. In order to avoid a trial for treason, Pound was declared criminally insane and incarcerated in an asylum, St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C., where he remained for twelve years. Rudge began the onerous task of trying to secure his freedom. She used friends and their many contacts in the literary world to mount a petition attesting to his character and that amongst other things he had never in fact been a member of the Italian Fascist Party (Partito Nazionale Fascista). One of her ideas was that Pound be released to live in an American monastery, but all her entreaties fell on deaf ears. His letters discourage Rudge from visiting him but she did travel to America to visit him twice, once in 1952 and again in 1955. Pound at this time was receiving visits not only from his wife but other mistresses too. Following the 1955 visit, their letters to each other became cooler and more impersonal, and they rarely communicated at all from 1955 to 1959. This coolness between 1955 and 1959 is the only hint that perhaps she did mind his other lady friends, but little is known of Rudge's views of Pound's \\"other women\\". She had no choice but to tolerate the existence of his wife. Marcella Spann, an English teacher, began to write to him in St. Elizabeth's, which led to visits. Following his release, Spann accompanied Ezra and Dorothy back to Italy, acting as his secretary. Pound is alleged to have proposed to her (although he was already married), but Dorothy sent Spann packing. Nevertheless, Spann and Pound jointly edited the 1964 volume Confucius to Cummings: An Anthology of Poetry. Venice and Pound Rudge's home in Venice In 1958, Pound was declared incapable of standing trial. He was stripped of his rights of citizenship and released from St. Elizabeth's on condition that he return to Europe. With his wife, who was also his legal custodian, he quickly returned to Italy. The couple stayed with Rudge's daughter by Pound, Mary, now married to Boris de Rachewiltz and living at Brunnenberg castle in Tirol. Pound's health was now broken and he spent a year in the sanatorium Martinsbrunn in Meran. It is thought that during his time in St. Elizabeth's Pound was treated with mind altering drugs that altered his personality permanently for the worse. In early 1962, \\"depressed and ill, Pound chose to put himself in Olga's hands\\". For the remainder of his life he lived with her, part of each year in Venice, part in Rapallo. The last eleven years of Pound's life accentuated his eccentricities, including a self-imposed vow of near- silence, with which Rudge coped while completely arranging his life and acting as his secretary. Many scholars and students sought Pound out and would arrive at the small house. Rudge devised a test to distinguish the genuine from the merely curious. She would ask the prospective visitor to recite a line from one of Pound's works; those who could gained admittance, those who could not were shown out. For Rudge, life with Pound was not easy; yet, her belief in him was absolute. For the first time, Rudge now had Pound completely to herself, as his wife Dorothy withdrew from the triangle. Pound saw Dorothy only twice during his last four years. The couple seldom left their Venice or Rapallo homes; however, they journeyed to London in 1965 for the funeral of T.S. Eliot and to the United States in 1969. Pound, hospitalized immediately following his eighty-seventh birthday celebration, died November 1, 1972 holding Rudge's hand. She organized his funeral in the cemetery on the Isola di San Michele, Venice. After his death Rudge acquired a large archive of his papers and artifacts. Dorothy Pound died the following year, leaving Rudge the last member of the m√©nage √† trois to carry Pound's torch. Alone in Venice Rudge was 78 years old when Pound died, the beginning of the final phase of her life. She became one of Venice's resident celebrities, quick witted, intelligent, and cultured. She sat on many committees organizing the city's many charities and galas. She was an essential guest at the city's profuse \\"dolce vita\\" gatherings, but continued to inhabit the same small house she had shared with Pound. Encouraging young aspiring poets and artists, she often offered them free use of the top floor of her home in return for a small painting or dedicated poem. Frequently asked to write an autobiography, she always replied \\"Write about Pound.\\" She saw it as her raison d'√™tre to promote Pound's work and defend his reputation against charges of anti-Semitism and Fascism. Rudge's relationship with her daughter Mary had always been complex: at the time of the birth, Rudge had in fact wanted a son. Having boarded the child with Tyrolean farmers at birth, Rudge was later surprised to find the child developed into \\"a dialect speaking farm girl\\". Rudge tried to rectify this situation upon being permanently reunited with Mary when the child was ten. Elocution, etiquette, and music lessons were met with fierce opposition; a violin that Rudge gave to her daughter was smashed against a chicken coop: in short, Mary found her mother distant, impenetrable, and authoritarian. Her relationship with her father was better. She learned of her illegitimacy only in her late teens. Pound asked Mary to translate his epic work The Cantos into Italian. This was to be the beginning of a lifelong passion and study of Pound's work, with Mary later referring to The Cantos as \\"my bible\\". Mary wrote her autobiography Discretions in 1971 (the title being a play on words on Pound's autobiography Indiscretions). The revelations contained in the book \\"deeply hurt\\" Rudge, and she and her daughter did not communicate for several years, although she remained in regular contact with Mary's children, Walter de Rachewiltz and Patrizia de Rachewiltz de Vroom. Mother and daughter later overcame their estrangement. Rudge had to become dependent on friends and acquaintances for the necessities of life. In later life, her memory began to fail her. =Ezra Pound Foundation= It had always been Rudge's intention to set up a foundation of some kind to house Pound's archives, but this was a task she always deferred, while continuing to assist scholars of his work and organize several exhibitions devoted to him. In 1986, Rudge together with an American friend, Jane Rylands, and an attorney from Cleveland, Ohio, formed the \\"Ezra Pound Foundation\\". She sold most of her archive and her house to the Foundation for a sum of approximately seven thousand dollars. After the establishment of the Foundation, Rudge's family alleged that this had not been her intention, and that the house and archive were worth considerably more. Part of the problem was that, aged 91, Rudge was becoming forgetful of things she had agreed to. In April 1988, she wrote to the Cleveland attorney informing him of her wish to dissolve the Foundation. The reply told her that such a request was not within the law. The papers were later deposited in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University, where they are housed today, and the Ezra Pound Foundation was dissolved. One box of papers concerning the transfer of the archive from the Ezra Pound Foundation is withheld from public viewing. =Final years= At the time of the creation of the Ezra Pound Foundation, Rudge's friends were becoming increasingly concerned for her. Sculptress Joan Fitzgerald contacted Rudge's daughter, and Rudge's son-in-law and grandson immediately came to Venice. They found that ownership of her house \\"The Hidden Nest\\" had not yet been conveyed to the Foundation and were able to recover it, but the archive, containing letters not only from Pound but from other great literary figures of the day, had passed from her ownership. Rudge continued for a short while to live at \\"The Hidden Nest\\" until old age and infirmity forced to her to leave Venice and make her final home with her daughter at Schloss Brunnenburg. Her family ‚Äì her daughter, two grandchildren and four great-grandsons ‚Äì were protective of her, and it was at their home that Rudge died, aged 100, on 15 March 1996. She was buried with Pound in Venice. Joan Fitzgerald, a close friend of the couple, engraved on their simple tombstones the verse \\"O God, what great kindness have we done in times past and forgotten it, That thou givest this wonder unto us, O God of waters?\\" (Night Litany). An alternative epitaph to Rudge could have been that written by Pound in 1966 and intended to be placed at the end of the final Canto: ::That her acts ::Olga's acts ::of beauty ::be remembered. ::Her name was courage ::and is written Olga. Legacy Rudge was fiercely proud to have always been financially independent of Pound, and continued her career as concert violinist until the Second World War. Her advocacy of the works of Vivaldi, which included publishing a catalogue of his works and an article in the Grove Dictionary of Music, did much to establish his modern day popularity. She discovered and publicised 309 Vivaldi concertos which had either been lost or forgotten. However, it is as Pound's muse, mistress, and champion that she is chiefly remembered today. Anne Conover's book Olga Rudge and Ezra Pound (2001) is one of the few to credit Rudge for her own endeavours as well as her role of muse to Ezra Pound. Shortly before his death, Pound wrote of Rudge: > There is more courage in Olga's little finger than in the whole of my > carcass ... she kept me alive for ten years, for which no one will thank > her. The true story will not be told until her version is known. Notes # Barbara C. Eastman, Literary Review of Canada describes her as \\"gifted\\". # A.

It was founded in 1902 as a society called the Hot Feet. The society was known primarily for its public ceremonies in which it crowned the society's \\"king\\". The Hot Feet were disbanded in 1908 under pressure from the university's Administrative Council, who called the society \\"very detrimental to the University's welfare\\" and banned it, along with \\"all other organizations which promote disorder in the University.\\" While the society returned, it was to be disbanded once more; university historian Virginius Dabney records the final activity of the society as the 1911 distribution of stuffed animal specimens from the natural history museum about Grounds on Easter Sunday, and the assault of a student in his room. The society reconstituted itself in 1913 as the IMP Society, and remains active. The IMP Society has engaged in philanthropic activities around the University, presenting the IMP Award, given \\"to a faculty member who had been outstanding in promoting student-faculty relations and perpetuating the traditions of the university\\", Dabney, 332. and the IMP Student Athlete Award, given at graduation to a female athlete who has excelled in both the field and the classroom; and a recent student social justice-oriented community service fellowship. In addition to philanthropy, IMPs are known to march around the grounds carrying pitchforks, wearing horned hoods, and engaging in mild mischief and revelry. (In one 2004 incident, the group was forced to apologize after using gasoline to start a bonfire on the Lawn during a nighttime ceremony.) The society publicly \\"taps\\" its new members, and most current members wear a ring indicating their membership in the organization. While the members of the group are known, many of their community service works are not widely publicized. Like the Seven Society and Z Society, the IMP Society is known to paint their symbol around university grounds. Members of the IMP Society are more public than other societies at the university, often recognized by their ring with the face of a devil on it, or their public tappings. Notable IMP and Hot Feet alumni include James Rogers McConnell, who was the inspiration for Gutzon Borglum's statue The Aviator.Bruce, V: 399.

Viki was raised by Keith and Catherine Hayes in the same manner as a human infant, to see if she could learn human words. She was given speech therapy, which involved the Hayeses (her adopters) manipulating her lower jaw. Eventually, she was able to voice four words: *mama *papa *up *cup This extremely limited success was at first interpreted as evidence that apes were not capable of using human language. However, further experiments in which chimpanzees were instructed in the use of American sign language indicated that Viki's achievements had been significantly hampered by physiological limitations‚Äîchimpanzees are not able to produce the sounds that make up human speech. Viki lived like a human, even with a human sibling, for three years with her trainers, Keith and Cathy Hayes, with the notion that the other failed attempts of teaching a non-human primate a human language failed because these studies used environments too dissimilar to a human's environment when infants learn language. The immersive language experienced failed, however, after 3 years Cathy Hays said ‚Äúthe only obvious and important deficit in the ape‚Äôs innate intelligence, as compared with man‚Äôs, is a missing facility for using and understanding language‚Äù (Fitch, 2002).

Early years Daughter of J. Chalmers Doane, a music educator and member of the Order of Canada, Doane learned many instruments at a young age, including piano, bass guitar, mandolin, guitar, violin. After high school, she studied music at Dalhousie University with the intention of becoming a music teacher. Her career path changed after she received a role in Neptune Theatre's production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat in 1986. She was cast regularly in productions at Neptune for two years before moving to Toronto in 1988. Over the next few years Doane played roles in various theatre productions, including Fire! and Buddy ‚Äì The Buddy Holly Story on Broadway. Music career In 1993, Doane released the EP Harvest Train independently. Some of the songs drew the attention of Sony Music Canada, and she was signed to the label. She recorded her debut album, Shakespearean Fish in 1996. Although the album wasn't a hit on commercial radio, it was noticed by record producer Rick Neigher in Los Angeles. He worked with Doane on the second album, Adam's Rib (1998). The title song became the album's first Top 40 hit, followed by \\"Waiting for the Tide\\", \\"Goliath\\", and \\"Happy Homemaker\\". She toured in support of the album for two years with Jann Arden, Great Big Sea, The Philosopher Kings, and Lilith Fair. In 1999, Doane won the Juno Award for New Artist of the Year. After touring, she left Sony Music Canada. Through a partnership with Ted Dykstra and actor Gary Sinise, she began working on another album with Neigher in Los Angeles. She gave birth and worked as a session musician. She wrote songs with SHeDAISY, starred in the independent film Black Swan, and released the album Melvin Live. You Are What You Love was released by Actorboy Records and Warner Music Canada. The single \\"Still Desire You\\" reached the Top 5 at Canadian radio stations and its accompanying music video reached No. 1 on MuchMoreMusic's viewer's choice countdown. During promotion, she gave birth to her second child. In 2007 she Doane began working on an album that was inspired by motherhood. Initially dubbed a lullaby album, the resulting independent release A Thousand Nights had much wider appeal, mixing covers by Fleetwood Mac, The Everly Brothers, and Leonard Cohen with originals by Doane and including guests Jim Cuddy, Ron Sexsmith, Kathryn Rose, Emilie-Claire Barlow, and Ted Dykstra. Released in 2008, A Thousand Nights was preceded by the lead single \\"Songbird\\" featuring Cuddy, which became a Top 5 hit on the iTunes country singles chart in Canada. Doane's \\"Every Little Thing\\" and \\"Chopin Ballad\\" each received placements in the television shows Being Erica and Flashpoint. In 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2013, she was the featured entertainer on the Canadian Pacific Railway Holiday Train Tour. Each tour consisted of approximately 60 shows over the span of three weeks in various communities in the United States and Canada. Doane began working on a new studio album in 2009 with her brother and drummer Creighton Doane at his studio in Toronto. Throughout the recording process, early demos of tracks \\"Back To LA\\", \\"Make God Laugh\\", \\"From Your Lips to God's Ears\\", \\"Sweet on You\\", and \\"The Stupider I Am\\" were given away as free downloads via Doane's official website. In the summer of 2010, \\"Sweet on You\\" reached #1 on the East Coast Countdown, a popular radio show in Atlantic Canada. In December 2010, The Emerald City was announced with a March 1, 2011 release date. =War Horse= Shortly after the release of The Emerald City in 2011, Doane was asked to audition for the role of \\"Song Woman\\" in Mirvish's Toronto production of the acclaimed play War Horse. She was offered the role and began rehearsals for the production in December 2011. The play opened at the Princess of Wales Theatre in February 2012 to rave reviews, and eventually closed after a successful run on January 6, 2013. Of Doane's role in the production, Toronto Star's Richard Ouzounian wrote: > Through it all, the soaringly symphonic score of Adrian Sutton contrasts > with the simple songs selected by John Tams, sung here with poignant effect > by Melanie Doane.Ouzarian, Richard.\\"Review: War Horse is bold, brave and > beautiful and heart-stoppingly wonderful\\", Toronto Star, 28 February 2012, > accessed 31 January 2014.

It was directed by the Hughes Brothers, the filmmakers behind Menace II Society and Dead Presidents. The documentary consists of first person interviews of people involved in the pimping lifestyle (\\"the game\\"). The interviews are separated by short clips from 1970s blaxploitation films such as Willie Dynamite, The Mack, and Dolemite. The first portion of the documentary focuses on pimps working illegally. The illegal pimps that are interviewed are from all over the United States, e.g., Charm from Hawaii, Fillmore Slim from San Francisco, and Payroll from Las Vegas. These pimps, and many others discuss their theories on the history of prostitution. The pimps go on to talk about their philosophy on pimping, and how they live their daily life. The film also discusses the legal sector of prostitution. Dennis Hof, the owner of the Bunny Ranch in Nevada, is interviewed. He feels that Nevada is much smarter than the other states because they have imposed the proper health and background checks on prostitution, instead of trying to suppress prostitution by making it illegal. The majority of the documentary glorifies the pimping lifestyle. The pimps and prostitutes interviewed mainly discuss the perks of the lifestyle. They talk about the money they have made, and the expensive suits and cars they were able to buy. However, near the end of the film, the interviews involve prostitutes that have died from the lifestyle as well as pimps who have retired and hold straight jobs or those who are now in jail.

(; born ca. 1200 at Sangerhausen in Thuringia [now Sachsen-Anhalt]; died in 1260 at Kulmsee in the Monastic State of the Teutonic Order [now Che≈Çm≈ºa, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland), also called Jutta of Kulmsee, Jutta of Sangerhausen, and Jutta of Thuringia, was a German aristocrat who became a hermit on the frontier of Prussia and is honored as the patron saint of that region. She imitated the life of St. Elizabeth of Hungary, who was the Duchess of Thuringia during her youth, and has also been canonized a saint. She was married at the age of fifteen to a nobleman and bore children by him. She convinced her husband of, and raised her children in a contemplative and mystical form of Christianity. He died while they were on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and Jutta became a single mother. Each child eventually entered a monastery upon reaching a suitable age, and this left Jutta able to pursue a more austere religious way of life. Jutta became a member of the Third Order of St. Francis. She gave away or sold her property and lived the rest of her life in contemplation and in caring for the poor and the sick. She became a figure of ridicule among her neighbors as she carried out her service to the poor of the region. In her last years, Jutta moved to the frontier of Christian Europe. She chose as her base a derelict building in Bildsch√∂n (now Bielczyny), near Kulmsee in Prussia, part of the Monastic State of the Teutonic Order, the area governed by the Teutonic Knights, whose Grand Master, Anno von Sangershausen, was a relative of hers. There the knights sheltered her. Visitors came to her to receive counsel and prayers, and she quickly established a reputation as a saint. She said that there were three things that can bring one near to God:painful sickness, exile from home, and poverty voluntarily accepted for God. She dedicated her final days to praying for the non-Christian population of the region. She died around 1260. In keeping with her wishes, Archbishop Friar Heidenreich of Kulm, O.P., earlier Archbishop of Armagh, Ireland, and now first Bishop of Kulm, had her buried at the cathedral. A cultus developed around her immediately and the Kulmsee cathedral became a destination for pilgrims. In the Roman Catholic Church, she is honored as the patron saint of Prussia, and her feast day is observed on 5 May.

Devotees from as far away as Singapore, Taiwan and China come to pray in the temple on the monk's birthday (the sixth day of the first lunar month). The temple also featured during the 8th leg of The Amazing Race 16 and become a location in Tan Twan Eng's novel \\"The Gift of Rain\\" (book 1, chapter 4).  History  The temple was constructed in the 1805 to honour Chor Soo Kong (also known as Qingshui), a Buddhist monk who lived during the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) for his numerous good deeds especially in healing the sick and giving shelter to snakes. When the temple structure is completed in the 1800s, snakes coming from the species of Wagler's pit viper reportedly appeared by themselves.  Features  The temple is filled with the smoke of burning incense and a variety of pit vipers. The vipers are believed to be rendered harmless by the sacred smoke, but as a safety precaution, the snakes have been de-venomed but still have their fangs intact. Other species of snake also available in the temple. Visitors are warned against picking up the reptiles and placing them on their bodies to take pictures. Aside from the snakes, two brick wells known as the \\"Dragon Eye Wells/Dragon Pure Water Wells\\" are located inside the temple together with two giant brass bells.

It was first released in May 2006 in North America and Japan, and in PAL regions the following month. It is a part of the New Super Mario Bros. subseries of the Super Mario franchise, and follows Mario as he fights his way through Bowser's henchmen to rescue Princess Peach. Mario has access to several power- ups that help him complete his quest, including the Super Mushroom, the Fire Flower, and the Starman, each giving him unique abilities. While traveling through eight worlds with a total of 80 levels, Mario must defeat Bowser Jr. and Bowser before saving Princess Peach. New Super Mario Bros was commercially successful and received positive reviews; praise went towards its improvements made to the Mario franchise and faithfulness to older Mario games, while criticism was targeted at its low difficulty level and many critics noted its similarity to previous games. It sold over 30 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling game for the Nintendo DS and one of the best-selling video games of all time. The game's success led to a line of sequels released for the Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U and subsequent rereleases of these.  Gameplay  Mario rampages through a level after using a Mega Mushroom power- up, which grows him to an enormous size for a short period of time. Mario and surrounding objects are seen with a 2.5D effect. New Super Mario Bros. is a side-scrolling video game. While it is seen in 2D, most of the characters and objects are 3D polygonal renderings on 2D backgrounds, resulting in a 2.5D effect that visually simulates 3D computer graphics. The player can play as either Mario, or his brother, Luigi . Similar to previous Mario games, Mario or Luigi can jump, crouch, collect coins, stomp on enemies, and break open blocks. Moves from 3D Mario games reappear in New Super Mario Bros., including the ground pound, triple jump, and wall jump. Enemies from previous games, such as Boos, are also reintroduced. Ten levels are available in each of eight worlds, which are shown in the Nintendo DS's bottom touchscreen while viewing the world map. The map of the currently selected world appears in the top screen, which is used to navigate between the world's levels. The goal of each level is to reach a black flag at the end of the level. At the end of each world, a boss must be defeated before proceeding to the next world. There are six power-ups available in New Super Mario Bros.; the game allows the player to store an extra power-up when he is already using one, a feature carried over from Super Mario World. Three power-ups from Super Mario Bros. return: the Super Mushroom makes Mario grow in size, the Fire Flower lets Mario throw fireballs, and the Starman makes Mario temporarily invincible. Three more power-ups are introduced in New Super Mario Bros.: the Blue Koopa Shell lets Mario withdraw into a shell to protect himself and perform a \\"shell dash\\" attack, the Mega Mushroom grows Mario to an incredible size, where he can destroy everything in his path, and the Mini-Mushroom causes Mario to shrink, allowing him to enter tiny passageways. The game's multiplayer mode pits two players against each other as they play as Mario and Luigi in one of five stages, trying to be the first to obtain a preset number of stars. Both players can attack each other in attempts to steal the other player's stars. Jumping on the opponent's character will make them lose one star, while performing a ground pound will lose them three. In addition, some minigames previously available in Super Mario 64 DS have returned and now offer multiplayer options for added replay value. The minigames are divided into four categories: Action, Puzzle, Table and Variety. New Super Mario Bros. contains eighteen minigames for single players and ten minigames for multiple players.  Plot  Mario and Princess Peach are walking together when lightning suddenly strikes Peach's castle nearby. As Mario runs to investigate, Bowser Jr. appears, sneaking up on the Princess from behind and kidnapping her. Realizing what has happened, Mario quickly rushes back and gives chase. Mario ventures through eight worlds pursuing Bowser Jr. and trying to rescue the kidnapped princess. Mario catches up to them and confronts Bowser Jr. occasionally, but is unable to save the princess from the young Koopa's clutches. At the end of the first world, Bowser Jr. retreats to a castle, where his father, Bowser, awaits Mario on a bridge over a pit filled with lava. In a scene highly reminiscent of the original Super Mario Bros., Mario activates a button behind Bowser to defeat him, and the bridge underneath Bowser collapses, causing him to fall into the lava which burns his flesh, leaving a skeleton. Though Bowser was defeated in the first level, this does not stop Bowser Jr. from running through the remaining worlds with Peach in tow, forcing Mario to chase after him before reaching Bowser's castle in World 8. There, Bowser Jr. revives his father's skeleton, creating Dry Bowser, but Mario once again defeats Bowser by dropping him into a deep pit. In the final battle, Bowser Jr. flees once more across a lava chasm to a larger castle, where he throws his father's bones into a cauldron and revives Bowser in his original form. They attack Mario in tandem, but Mario drops the pair into the pit below. In the game's final sequence, Mario rescues Peach, who kisses him on the cheek. Over the end credits, Bowser Jr. is seen dragging his unconscious father across the floor. He looks at the screen, and growls, breaking the fourth wall.  Development  Nintendo announced on February 21, 2006 that New Super Mario Bros. would launch for the Nintendo DS on May 7, 2006. The game's new power-ups were also introduced at the same time, including the Blue Koopa Shell and the Mega Mushroom. Nintendo further mentioned that the game would be played in 2D but use 3D models to create a 2.5D look and feel. The May 7 release was later delayed towards May 21, but the game's release date was eventually only pushed back slightly to May 15; Nintendo also planned to release it around the same time that the Nintendo DS Lite launched, on June 11, 2006. New Super Mario Bros. is the first original 2D platform game to star Mario since Super Mario Land 2 in 1992. New Super Mario Bros. was available for play at E3 in 2005. The game's designers were given much more freedom with designs in New Super Mario Bros. compared to previous 2D Mario games. Characters, enemies, and objects could now be created with much more detailed animations, without requiring that they be designed by hand. To provide visual cues, the developers made the game's camera more dynamic; it zooms in and out of action depending on the situation to provide focus where necessary. Physics play an important role in New Super Mario Bros. improved game mechanics. Without the rigid restrictions of tile-based sprites and backgrounds, the designers were free to explore new gameplay mechanics; when Mario lands on top of a tree, it teeters over and eventually falls if he is stationary for too long. Mario can also swing on ropes and walk on wires that bend and stretch under his weight. Early in the game's development, the developers planned not to use voice acting to stay true to the spirit of the original Super Mario Bros. However, voice acting was eventually embraced by the developers, who decided that it would serve the game in a positive manner. Although voice acting was used in earlier 2D Mario remakes, New Super Mario Bros. is the first original 2D Mario game to use voice acting. Charles Martinet returned to voice Mario and Luigi, along with Nicole Mills as Princess Peach, Scott Burns as Bowser, and Dolores Rogers as Bowser Jr. New Super Mario Bros. features original music composed by Asuka Ohta and Hajime Wakai under the direction of the Super Mario Bros. series composer, Koji Kondo, who also created the \\"Aboveground BGM\\", the main theme for regular levels. The game's music dictates gameplay; enemies jump and dance in time to the music. Predicting enemy movements, players can time their jumps with enemy movements to reach otherwise inaccessible areas.  Reception  New Super Mario Bros. was released by Nintendo in North America on May 15, 2006, in Japan on May 25, 2006, and in Europe on June 30, 2006. Nintendo did not specify why it chose to delay the game's release in its home market of Japan by ten days, but GameSpot noted that \\"it stands to reason that the company simply wants a few more days to build inventory.\\" In Japan, over 480,000 units of New Super Mario Bros. were sold on the day it was released and 900,000 copies in the first four days. At the time, it was the best-selling debut for a Nintendo DS game in Japan, but it has since been surpassed by Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl. It is Japan's 26th best-selling game in 2008. In the United States, 500,000 copies of New Super Mario Bros. were sold in the first 35 days, and one million copies were sold twelve weeks after its release. Worldwide sales have steadily increased throughout the years, with five million copies by April 2008, eighteen million by March 2009, and 30.8 million by March 2016, making it the best-selling game for the Nintendo DS and one of the best-selling video games of all time. The game received positive reviews from critics, with several calling New Super Mario Bros. one of the best games available for the Nintendo DS. GameZone believed that it was the \\"hot game\\" to purchase for any DS owner, noting its \\"huge exploration potential\\" and reinvention of the platform game genre. Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer stated, \\"I've done this sort of thing before hundreds of times across thousands of days in what feels like a dozen Mario games. I still love it.\\" Believing that experienced players would require very little time to complete the game, GameSpot nevertheless considered New Super Mario Bros. a \\"completely awesome\\" game that was an \\"absolutely necessary\\" video game to own. GamesRadar considered the game a bargain, noting that it included \\"a completely solid solo game, a simple-but-exciting two-player, and then a collection of super- quick stylus games\\". Several reviewers drew comparisons between New Super Mario Bros. and their favorite Mario games. Although some found that other Mario games were better, most reviewers were still pleased with the overall experience of the game. Some fans however, criticized the game for its low difficulty compared to other Mario games. Craig Harris of IGN was enthused with New Super Mario Bros., stating that it was his new favorite platform game, beating out his previous favorite, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. Even though Super Mario World and Super Mario Bros. 3 were considered the best 2D Mario games by GamePro's Mr. Marbles, he decided to add New Super Mario Bros. as his third favorite Mario game, which he admitted had much more replay value than the other two. Though the game includes new features such as a versus mode, Game Revolution disconcertedly asked the question, \\"Can Mario ever truly be new again?\\". It also disappointed Greg Sewart of X-Play, who found that the game did not live up to the standards set by its predecessors, but still considered the game the best side-scrolling video game available for the Nintendo DS. The game's graphics and audio received praise in a number of reviews. The Computer and Video Games magazine was entertained by the \\"finely crafted slice of Mario\\", along with the extra minigames offered. They believed that the audio was very good for a Nintendo DS game, predicting that \\"it'd still scare the pants off the hard-of-hearing.\\" Though being a 2D game, GameSpy still found that the 2D and 3D elements blended together perfectly in New Super Mario Bros. The game's overall experience pleased 1UP.com, which applauded Nintendo's ability to once again create an enjoyable, solid, and challenging portable experience. However, they were disappointed in the lack of imagination for this remake. New Super Mario Bros. received numerous awards and accolades. It was given Game of the Month awards from Game Informer and Electronic Gaming Monthly, and it received Editors' Choice Awards from IGN and GameSpot. The game was voted Best Handheld Game at the 2006 Spike Video Game Awards, Best Nintendo DS Game by GameSpot, and it won Best Platformer awards from X-Play and Nintendo Power. The game was awarded Choice Video Game at the 2006 Teen Choice Awards, and Nintendo Game of the Year at the 2006 Golden Joystick Award.  Sequels  New Super Mario Bros. Wii, a successor to New Super Mario Bros., was released internationally for the Wii in 2009. It features similar gameplay to its predecessor, with several of the same power- ups returning as well as brand-new ones. The game is the first Super Mario game to feature cooperative gameplay for up to four people, allowing players to control Mario, Luigi, and two different toads coloured yellow and blue. A direct sequel New Super Mario Bros. 2 (which is a follow-up to the Wii game) was later released for the Nintendo 3DS on July 28, 2012. A sequel to New Super Mario Bros. Wii and a follow-up to New Super Mario Bros. 2, titled New Super Mario Bros. U, was then released for the Wii U on November 18, 2012, and its port titled New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe was released on the Nintendo Switch worldwide on January 11, 2019.

It was the original home of influential Minnesota bands the Replacements and Soul Asylum and was instrumental in helping the Twin Cities music scene achieve national attention in the 1980s. Along with other independent American labels such as SST Records, Touch and Go Records, and Dischord, Twin/Tone helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie-rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging. Twin/Tone originated in the Minneapolis punk rock scene, which included venues like Jay's Longhorn Bar. The label was begun by Peter Jesperson, local music and sports writer Charley Hallman, and Paul Stark.Cost, J., Earles, A., Fritch, M., Hickey, M., Klinge, S., Miller, E., Olson, D., Rowland, H., Ryan, M., and Valania, J.: A Tale of Twin Cities: H√ºsker D√º, the Replacements and the Rise and Fall of the ‚Äô80s Minneapolis Scene, Magnet, June 12, 2005. Releases by the pop/rock group The Suburbs were both Twin/Tone's first release (The Suburbs EP in 1978) and its last (Viva! Suburbs! in 1994). Jesperson signed the Replacements to the label immediately after the band's debut at the Longhorn Bar in Minneapolis. By 1984, the label had released 41 records and grown large enough to support three paid staff members, with its biggest-selling records including the Suburbs' debut and the first two discs by the Replacements. Other groups that signed with Twin/Tone include the Magnolias, Babes in Toyland, Information Society, Agitpop, the Jayhawks, Poster Children, Soul Asylum, the Wallets, Curtiss A, and Pennsylvania-based Ween. British alternative-rock musician Robyn Hitchcock also released his 1990 solo album Eye through the label. The label was headquartered at 2541 Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis, which had previously been home to Kay Bank Studios, where garage-rock hits such as the Castaways' \\"Liar, Liar\\" and the Trashmen's \\"Surfin' Bird\\" had been recorded in the 1960s. For a time, H√ºsker D√º had an office space next door to Twin/Tone at 2539. H√ºsker D√º's Grant Hart would later name his first solo work, 2541, after the location. By 1994, Twin/Tone had released more than 300 records by 100 bands and had begun to develop an umbrella relationship with several smaller, mostly Minnesota-based indie labels, including: In 1995, Twin/Tone was recognized as a \\"significant regional label\\" by Billboard magazine. In 1998, Stark decided to stop releasing physical product in favor of digital media. The company is currently described as being \\"in mothballs\\", releasing only limited amounts of out-of-print material on custom-burned CDs, though some of the more significant material was licensed to Restless Records, part of Rykodisc. Hallman died in 2015. In 2017, the label was revived by Stark and Jesperson to release the Suicide Commandos comeback album Time Bomb.

In a company, the person holding the position typically reports directly to the CEO, and their duties involve overseeing and identifying the legal issues in all departments and their interrelation, including engineering, design, marketing, sales, distribution, credit, finance, human resources and production, as well as corporate governance and business policy. This would naturally require in most cases reporting directly to the owner or CEO overseeing the very business on which the CLO is expected to be familiar with and advise on the most confidential level. This requires the CLO/general counsel to work closely with each of the other officers, and their departments, to appropriately be aware and advise.The 2011 In-House Counsel Compensation Survey, Question 10, Profiles of In-House Counsel 2006 Who Does Your Counsel Report To? (2001) (The Majority Report to the CEO) Historically, general counsel often handled administrative tasks while outside lawyers in private practice handled more complex legal work. Since the 1980s, however, the general counsel position has become increasingly prominent in multinational companies, often directly advising the board of directors in place of outside lawyers. General counsel are now often among the most highly paid executives of major American corporations, and prominent American government lawyers and law firm partners are often hired for general counsel roles at prominent companies. Similar trends are also being seen in the United Kingdom and other countries. General counsel often have broad roles encompassing crisis management, compliance reporting management and public policy advocacy. Many companies also hire in-house counsel to handle specialized tasks such as tax work, mergers and acquisitions, labor law and intellectual property, sometimes building in-house practice groups that rival the practices of major law firms. Organizations =Global= The Association of Corporate Counsel The Association of Corporate Counsel (\\"ACC\\") has 35,000 general counsel, chief legal officer and other in-house counsel members located in 90 countries. ACC was founded as the American Corporate Counsel Association in 1982 and now includes more than 55 chapters, including in Argentina, Canada (four chapters), Europe, Israel, the Middle East and Singapore. Members have access to networking opportunities and education events through their regional chapter affiliations as well as global connections across practice area, job title and industry. ACC provides members with resources to deliver services and advice to their companies, promotes the value of in-house legal services and advocates on behalf of general counsel. For its general counsel and chief legal officer members, ACC hosts roundtables where members discuss current practice trends and issues. =United States= The General Counsel Forum The Forum is an association of 700 general counsel and senior managing counsel. The non-profit organization was founded in the fall of 1998 as the Dallas-Fort Worth General Counsel's Management Practices Forum (‚ÄúDFWGCMPF‚Äù). The association is a partnership between in- house members and outside counsel, known as underwriters. Members are general counsel and managing counsel of corporations, non-profit organizations and government agencies. The mission of the Forum is to improve the professional lives of general counsel and managing counsel through meaningful opportunities for peer-to-peer interaction and knowledge exchange, mentoring through professional development in legal best practices, ethics, governance, and compliance. In November 2000, the DFWGCMPF changed its name to The Texas General Counsel Forum, also known as The Forum, and in the following year the Houston Chapter was formed, and then the Austin-San Antonio Chapter was founded. In July 2005, the Forum hired a Chief Executive Officer with the mandate to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization, expand membership, and launch the organization nationally. In November 2009, the Board of Directors approved expanding the Forum nationally, and dropped the reference to Texas, becoming simply The General Counsel Forum. In the fall of 2012, the General Counsel Forum founded the Chicago Chapter. Silicon Valley Association of General Counsel The Silicon Valley Association of General Counsel (SVAGC) is a business league of chief legal officers from over 100 leading companies in the technology and life science sectors. Member companies include publicly traded corporations, private ventures and multinational subsidiaries located throughout the San Francisco Bay Area with operations in software, electronics, power technology, biotechnology, medical devices, health informatics, analytics, materials science, cleantech, fintech, telecommunications, network infrastructure, e-commerce and Internet services, artificial intelligence and machine learning. The SVAGC hosts a series of monthly luncheons featuring expert presentations and off-the-record discussion about topics of professional interest. It also assists members who wish to survey their peers or pose questions on particular issues, and cooperates in special projects such as the All Hands Meeting, an annual multi-track conference at the Santa Clara Convention Center, attended by general and staff counsel from hundreds of member and nonmember legal departments in the technology and life science sectors. The SVAGC is a successor to the Peninsula Association of General Counsel (PAGC), formed in the early 1980s. In 2003, the SVAGC was formally organized as a California mutual benefit nonprofit corporation with the assistance of Ivy Associates, a consultancy to the Silicon Valley legal community that provides organizational support for the SVAGC and produces the All Hands Meeting. Only SVAGC members, speakers and invited guests may attend monthly luncheons, which are funded by modest membership dues. Individuals may join the SVAGC when they are the chief legal officer of a company with operations in Northern California that is publicly traded or which meets alternative criteria for private companies. Some SVAGC members serve as general counsel for companies headquartered outside Northern California, and attend meetings when business travel brings them into the SF Bay Area. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom a group of general counsel, called the GC100, was officially launched on 9 March 2005 and brings together the senior legal officers of more than eighty five FTSE 100 companies. The GC100 group was created in response to the increasing volume and complexity of domestic and international law and regulation which impacts on UK listed companies. The group was formed with the support of Practical Law Company which acts as its secretariat. The main objectives of the GC100 are to: * Provide a forum for practical and business focused input on key areas of legislative and policy reform common to UK listed companies. * Enable members to share best practice in relation to law, risk management, compliance and other areas of common interest. Membership of the GC100 is by invitation only. At the AGM on the 16 January 2007 members voted in favour of extending membership to company secretaries as well as general counsel in the FTSE 100. The formal name of the GC100 is now \\"The Association of General Counsel and Company Secretaries of the FTSE100\\", although it will continue to be known as the GC100. Mark Harding, the first chair of the GC100, has stated that the GC100 is not a campaigning body, although they work closely with the FD100 (a similar grouping of blue chip finance directors).

Through his trial and its aftermath, he has given his name to the legal test of criminal insanity in England and other common law jurisdictions known as the M'Naghten rules.R Moran Daniel (1802/3‚Äì1865), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008. Early life Most of what is known about M'Naghten comes from evidence given at his trial and newspaper reports that appeared between his arrest and his trial. He was born in Scotland (probably Glasgow) in 1813, the illegitimate son of a Glasgow woodturner and landlord, also called Daniel M'Naghten. After the death of his mother Ada, M'Naghten went to live with his father's family and became an apprentice and later a journeyman at his father's workshop in Stockwell Street, Glasgow. When his father decided not to offer him a partnership, M'Naghten left the business and, after a three-year career as an actor, returned to Glasgow in 1835 to set up his own woodturning workshop. For the next five years, he ran a successful woodturning business, first in Turners Court and then in Stockwell Street. He was sober and industrious, and by living frugally was able to save a considerable sum of money. In his spare time, he attended the Glasgow Mechanics' Institute and the Athenaeum Debating Society, walked and read. He taught himself French so that he could read La Rochefoucauld. His political views were radical, and he employed the Chartist Abram Duncan in his workshop. In December 1840, M'Naghten sold his business and spent the next two years in London and Glasgow, with a brief trip to France. In the summer of 1842, he attended lectures on anatomy in Glasgow, but otherwise it is not known what he did with his time. Whilst in Glasgow in 1841, he complained to various people, including his father, the Glasgow commissioner of police and an MP, that he was being persecuted by the Tories and followed by their spies. No-one took him seriously, believing him to be deluded.State Trials Report: The Queen v. Daniel McNaughton, 1843. Reprinted in DJ West and A Walk (eds) 1977 Daniel McNaughton: his trial and the aftermath. Gaskell Books: 12‚Äì73. Murder of Edward Drummond In January 1843, M'Naghten was noticed acting suspiciously around Whitehall in London. On the afternoon of 20 January, the Prime Minister's private secretary, civil servant Edward Drummond, was walking towards Downing Street from Charing Cross when M'Naghten approached him from behind, drew a pistol and fired at point-blank range into his back. M'Naghten was overpowered by a police constable before he could fire a second pistol. It is generally thought, although the evidence is not conclusive, that M'Naghten was under the impression that he had shot Prime Minister Robert Peel. At first it was thought that Drummond's wound was not serious. He managed to walk away, the bullet was removed and the first newspaper reports were optimistic: \\"The ball has been extracted. No vital part is injured, and [surgeons] Mr Guthrie and Mr Bransby Cooper have every reason to believe that Mr. Drummond is doing very well.\\"John Bull, 21 January 1843. But complications set in and, in spite of (or possibly because of; see below) the surgeons' bleeding and leeching, Drummond died five days later. M'Naghten appeared at the Bow Street magistrates' court the morning after the assassination attempt. He made a brief statement in which he described how persecution by the Tories had driven him to act: \\"The Tories in my native city have compelled me to do this. They follow, persecute me wherever I go, and have entirely destroyed my peace of mind... It can be proved by evidence. That is all I have to say.\\" It was indeed all he had to say. He never spoke about the assassination again (apart from a dozen words when asked to plead guilty or not guilty at arraignment). Trial When M'Naghten was arrested, a bank receipt for ¬£750 was found on him. His father successfully applied to the court to have the money released to finance his defence, and for the case to be adjourned for evidence relating to M'Naghten's state of mind to be gathered. A date was set for Friday 3 March. The speed and efficiency with which M'Naghten's defence was organised suggests that a number of powerful people in law and medicine were waiting for an opportunity to bring about changes in the law on criminal insanity.R Ormrod 1977 The McNaughton case and its predecessors. In DJ West and A Walk (eds) Daniel McNaughton: his trial and the aftermath. Gaskell Books: 4‚Äì11. M'Naghten's trial for the \\"wilful murder of Mr Drummond\\" took place at the Central Criminal Court, Old Bailey, Thursday and Friday, 2‚Äì3 March 1843, before Chief Justice Tindal, Justice Williams and Justice Coleridge. When asked to plead guilty or not guilty, M'Naghten had said \\"I was driven to desperation by persecution\\" and, when pressed, \\"I am guilty of firing\\", which was taken as a not guilty plea. M'Naghten's defence team was led by one of London's best-known barristers, Alexander Cockburn. The case was prosecuted by the solicitor-general, Sir William Follett (the attorney-general being busy in Lancaster prosecuting Feargus O'Connor and 57 other Chartists following the plug riots). Both prosecution and defence based their cases on what constituted a legal defence of insanity. Both sides agreed that M'Naghten suffered from delusions of persecution. The prosecution argued that, in spite of his \\"partial insanity\\", he was a responsible agent, capable of distinguishing right from wrong, and conscious that he was committing a crime. Witnesses, including his landlady and his anatomy lecturer, were produced to testify that he appeared generally sane. Cockburn opened his defence by acknowledging that there were difficulties in the practical application of the principle of English law that held an insane person exempt from legal responsibility and legal punishment. He went on to say that M'Naghten's delusions had led to a breakdown of moral sense and loss of self-control, which, according to medical experts, had left him in a state where he was no longer a \\"reasonable and responsible being\\". He quoted extensively from Scottish jurist Baron Hume and American psychiatrist Isaac Ray. Witnesses were produced from Glasgow to give evidence about M'Naghten's odd behaviour and complaints of persecution. The defence then called medical witnesses, including Dr Edward Monro, Sir Alexander Morison and Dr Forbes Winslow, who testified that M'Naghten's delusions had deprived him of \\"all restraint over his actions\\". When the prosecution declined to produce any medical witnesses to counter this evidence, the trial was halted. Follet then made a brief, apologetic closing speech which he concluded with the words \\"I cannot press for a verdict against the prisoner\\". Chief Justice Tindal, in his summing up, stressed that the medical evidence was all on one side and reminded the jury that if they found the prisoner not guilty on the ground of insanity, proper care would be taken of him. The jury, without retiring, duly returned a verdict of not guilty on the ground of insanity. Bethlem and Broadmoor Daniel M'Naghten. Photographed by Henry Hering c 1856 After his acquittal M'Naghten was transferred from Newgate Prison to the State Criminal Lunatic Asylum at Bethlem Hospital under the 1800 Act for the Safe Custody of Insane Persons charged with Offences.P Allderidge 1977 Why was McNaughton sent to Bethlem? in DJ West and A Walk (eds)Daniel McNaughton: his trial and the aftermath. Gaskell Books: 100‚Äì112. His admission papers describe him in the following words: \\"Imagines the Tories are his enemies, shy and retiring in his manner.\\" Apart from one hunger strike, which ended with force-feeding, M'Naghten's 21 years at Bethlem appear to have been uneventful. Although no regular employment was provided for the men on the criminal wing of Bethlem, they were encouraged to keep themselves occupied with activities such as painting, drawing, knitting, board games, reading and musical instruments, and also did carpentry and decorating for the hospital. In 1864, M'Naghten was transferred to the newly opened Broadmoor Asylum, where his admission papers describe him as: \\"A native of Glasgow, an intelligent man\\" and record how, when asked if he thinks he must have been out of his mind when he shot Edward Drummond, he answers: \\"Such was the Verdict ‚Äì the opinion of the Jury after hearing the Evidence.\\" During his later years at Bethlem, he had been classified as an \\"imbecile.\\" He developed diabetes and heart problems in Bethlem; by the time he was transferred to Broadmoor, his health was declining, and he died on 3 May 1865. Alternative theories In 1843, a surgeon who was opposed to blood-letting published an anonymous pamphlet claiming that Drummond was killed not by M'Naghten's shot, but by the medical treatment he received afterwards. He said that a gunshot wound of the type sustained by Drummond was not necessarily fatal and criticised Drummond's doctors for their hasty removal of the bullet and repeated blood-lettings.An old army surgeon 1843 What killed Mr Drummond, the LEAD or the LANCET? Simpkin & Marshall. In his book Knowing Right From Wrong, Richard Moran, professor of sociology at Mount Holyoke College, argues that there are aspects of M'Naghten's case which have never been fully explained. He doubts that the money found on M'Naghten at the time of his arrest ‚Äì ¬£750 (currently worth ¬£) ‚Äì could have come entirely from his woodturning business, and points out that M'Naghten's political activity and the possibility that there may have been an element of truth to his complaints of persecution were ignored by the court. More recently, he has said that new evidence suggests that M'Naghten was a \\"political activist who was financed to assassinate the prime minister\\" and who subsequently feigned insanity. Significance The verdict in M'Naghten's trial provoked an outcry in the press and Parliament. Queen Victoria, who had been the target of assassination attempts, wrote to the prime minister expressing her concern at the verdict, and the House of Lords revived an ancient right to put questions to judges. Five questions relating to crimes committed by individuals with delusions were put to the 12 judges of the Court of Common Pleas. Chief Justice Tindal delivered the answers of 11 judges (Mr Justice Maule dissented in part)Report of M'Naghten's Case on the British and Irish Legal Information Institute website, accessed 17 March 2016. to the House of Lords on 19 June 1843. The answer to one of the questions became enshrined in law as the M'Naghten Rules and stated: > To establish a defence on the ground of insanity it must be clearly proved, > that, at the time of committing the act, the party accused was labouring > under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind, as not to know the > nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he > did not know that what he was doing was wrong.The House of Lords and the > Judges' 'Rules' 1843 Reprinted in DJ West and A Walk (eds) 1977 Daniel > McNaughton: his trial and the aftermath. Gaskell Books: 74‚Äì81. The rules dominated the law on criminal responsibility in England and Wales, the United States and many countries throughout the British Commonwealth for over 100 years. In England and Wales, the defence of insanity to which the rules apply was largely superseded, in cases of murder, by the Scottish concept of diminished responsibility following the passage of the Homicide Act 1957. M'Naghten's defence had successfully argued that he was not legally responsible for an act that arose from a delusion; the rules represented a step backwards to the traditional 'knowing right from wrong' test of criminal insanity. Had the rules been applied in M'Naghten's own case, the verdict might have been different. One of M'Naghten's younger half-brothers, Thomas McNaughtan, a doctor, became mayor of Blackpool and was a magistrate.Medical magistrate. British Medical Journal, 3 December 1887: 1253 Spelling of his name Artist's sketch of Daniel M'Naghten and an engraving of his signature. There is disagreement over how M'Naghten's name should be spelt (Mc or M' at the beginning, au or a in the middle, a, e, o or u at the end). M'Naghten is favoured in both English and American law reports, although the original trial report used M'Naughton; Bethlem and Broadmoor records use McNaughton and McNaughten.BL Diamond 1964 on the spelling of Daniel M'Naghten's name. Ohio State Law Journal 25(1). Reprinted in DJ West and A Walk (eds) 1977 Daniel McNaughton: his trial and the aftermath. Gaskell Books: 86‚Äì90. In a 1981 book about the case, Richard Moran, Professor of Criminology at Mount Holyoke College, uses the spelling McNaughtan, arguing that this was the family spelling.R Moran 1981 Knowing Right from Wrong: the insanity defense of Daniel McNaughtan. The Free Press. Until 1981, there was only one known signature: that which M'Naghten affixed to a sworn statement given before the magistrate at Bow Street during his arraignment. This signature, preserved in the Metropolitan Police File at the Public Records Office in Chancery Lane, London, first came to the attention of legal scholars in 1956. According to an authority at the British Museum this signature was spelt McNaughtun. Since this spelling did not conform to any of those in popular use, it did not help to resolve the controversy. Moran discovered a second signature during his research. On the front page of the Scotch Reformers Gazette, supplementary edition for 4 March 1843, there appeared an artist's sketch of Daniel M'Naghten standing in the dock at Old Bailey, accompanied by an engraving of his signature. This signature revealed that the apparent u in the Bow Street signature was actually an a. It also indicated that the apostrophe was used by printers to signify a small letter c placed above the line, since the Scotch Reformers Gazette, in the article accompanying the sketch and signature, used an inverted apostrophe to resemble more closely the letter c. The spelling \\"McNaughtan\\" was confirmed in the Glasgow Postal Directory for the years 1835 to 1844. While the Victorians were not always consistent in the way they spelled their names, even in official documents, several signatures of M'Naghten's father, uncovered while examining financial records at the Bank of Scotland, indicate that the \\"McNaughtan\\" spelling was the one used by the family.

Broadly speaking, a statement S2 depends on S1 if S1 must be executed before S2. Broadly, there are two classes of dependenciescontrol dependencies and data dependencies. Dependence analysis determines whether it is safe to reorder or parallelize statements.  Control dependencies  Control dependency is a situation in which a program instruction executes if the previous instruction evaluates in a way that allows its execution. A statement S2 is control dependent on S1 (written S1\\\\ \\\\delta^c\\\\ S2) if and only if S2's execution is conditionally guarded by S1. The following is an example of such a control dependence: S1 if x > 2 goto L1 S2 y := 3 S3 L1: z := y + 1 Here, S2 only runs if the predicate in S1 is false. See data dependencies for more details.  Data dependencies  A data dependence arises from two statements which access or modify the same resource. = Flow(True) dependence = A statement S2 is flow dependent on S1 (written S1\\\\ \\\\delta^f\\\\ S2) if and only if S1 modifies a resource that S2 reads and S1 precedes S2 in execution. The following is an example of a flow dependence (RAW: Read After Write): S1 x := 10 S2 y := x + c = Antidependence = A statement S2 is antidependent on S1 (written S1\\\\ \\\\delta^a\\\\ S2) if and only if S2 modifies a resource that S1 reads and S1 precedes S2 in execution. The following is an example of an antidependence (WAR: Write After Read): S1 x := y + c S2 y := 10 Here, S2 sets the value of \`y\` but S1 reads a prior value of \`y\`. The term 'antidependence' widely used in literature is a misnomer because 'anti' means opposite. The correct term should be 'ante' means before. Hence the correct word should be antedependence. = Output dependence = A statement S2 is output dependent on S1 (written S1\\\\ \\\\delta^o\\\\ S2) if and only if S1 and S2 modify the same resource and S1 precedes S2 in execution. The following is an example of an output dependence (WAW: Write After Write): S1 x := 10 S2 x := 20 Here, S2 and S1 both set the variable \`x\`. = Input dependence = A statement S2 is input dependent on S1 (written S1\\\\ \\\\delta^i\\\\ S2) if and only if S1 and S2 read the same resource and S1 precedes S2 in execution. The following is an example of an input dependence (RAR: Read-After-Read): S1 y := x + 3 S2 z := x + 5 Here, S2 and S1 both access the variable \`x\`. This dependence does not prohibit reordering.

It represents a long-term commitment to infrastructure delivery in South East Queensland. In mid-2011, then Premier Anna Bligh announced the plan would be incorporated into a statewide infrastructure plan called the Queensland Infrastructure Plan. SEQIPP was first released in 2005 and is updated annually. It sets timeframes and budgets to ensure infrastructure is delivered to support the region‚Äôs growth. In 2010, the plan identifies about $134 billion in estimated infrastructure investment, which is expected to support about 930,000 jobs through to 2031: * $97.7 billion in transport * $6.8 billion in health * $3 billion in education and training * $5.4 billion energy * $1.5 billion in water * $3.8 billion in community services * $16 billion in completed projects. An average of $37,000 per person in SEQ is estimated to be invested in infrastructure across South East Queensland to 2031. In 2011, SEQIPP will become a statewide document, the Queensland Infrastructure Plan, which will clearly link infrastructure delivery with population growth and economic development priorities. It will also be realigned to more effectively link to Queensland Growth Management Summit outcomes including regionalisation and feedback from local governments on dwelling targets. Delivery of SEQIPP is a clear demonstration of Growth Management Queensland (GMQ) delivering outcomes for Queenslanders. Projects Major road project that have been completed include the Tugun Bypass, Clem Jones Tunnel, Gateway Motorway Upgrade and the Hale Street Link, while work continues on the Airport Link. Public transport projects covered by the plan include the Northern Busway, Boggo Road Busway and the Eastern Busway.

It is situated on a hill above sea level, in the Monti Ernici area. History Ferentinum was a town of the Hernici; it was captured from them by the Romans in 364 BC and took no part in the rising of 306 BC. The inhabitants became Roman citizens after 195 BC, and the place later became a municipium. It lay just above the Via Latina and, being a strong place, served for the detention of hostages. From 1198 to 1557 it was the seat of the Papal rectorate of Campagna and Marittima province. Strong in textiles (linen and embroidery) and handicraft (clay bricks from Fornaci Giorgi), after World War II Ferentino experienced a heavy industrial growth, mainly in pharmaceuticals. Main sights Ferentino still possesses remains of ancient fortifications. The lower portion of the outer walls, which probably did not stand free, is built of roughly hewn blocks of a limestone which naturally splits into horizontal layers; above this in places is walling of rectangular blocks of tuff. Two gates, the Porta Maggiore, a double gate constructed entirely of rectangular blocks of tuff, and the Porta Sanguinaria (with an arch with tuff voussoirs), are preserved. Outside this gate, the testament of Aulus Quinctilius Priscus inscribed in the rock. The highest part of the town, the acropolis (2nd-1st centuries BC), is fortified also; it has massive retaining walls similar to those of the lower town. At the eastern corner, under the present episcopal palace, the construction is somewhat more careful. A projecting rectangular terrace has been erected, supported by walls of quadrilateral blocks of limestone arranged almost horizontally; while upon the level thus formed a building of rectangular blocks of local travertine was raised. The projecting cornice of this building bears two inscriptions of the period of Sulla, recording its construction by two censors (local officials); and in the interior, which contains several chambers, there is an inscription of the same censors over one of the doors, and another over a smaller external aide door. The windows lighting these chambers come immediately above the cornice, and the wall continues above them again. The whole of this construction probably belongs to one period. The Cathedral of Ferentino. The Cathedral of Sts John and Paul occupies a part of the level top of the ancient acropolis; it was reconstructed on the site of an older church in 1099-1118; the interior was modernized in 1693, but was restored to its original form in 1902. It contains a fine ciborium in the Cosmatesque style and a 12th-century mosaic pavement. The Gothic church of Santa Maria Maggiore, in the lower town (13th-14th century), has a very fine exterior; the interior, the plan of which is a perfect rectangle, has been spoiled by restoration. Other religious edifices include the Benedictine church of San Valentino (mostly remade after World War II, but still including 13th-century frescoes) and the Romanesque monastery of Sant'Antonio Abate, which housed the remains of Pope Celestine V until 1327. The latter's heart is preserved in the small convent church of the Clarisse (17th century).

Heinlein. It describes the US effort to build a nuclear weapon in order to end the ongoing World War II, and its dystopian consequences to the nation and the world. The story was first published in Astounding Science Fiction magazine, with illustrations by Frank Kramer. In November 1940, Astounding editor John W. Campbell had suggested that Heinlein write a story about the use of radioactive dust as a weapon, proposing a detailed scenario. Heinlein discarded Campbell's scenario, and wrote a story he called \\"Foreign Policy\\", submitting it to Campbell in December 1940 with the comment \\"I turned the original idea upside down, inside out, shook it, and have turned out an entirely different story\\". Campbell quickly accepted the piece, changing the title to \\"Solution Unsatisfactory\\"; it appeared in the May 1941 issue, under Heinlein's \\"Anson MacDonald\\" pseudonym.William H. Patterson, Robert A. Heinlein: In Dialogue with His Century, volume 1, Tor Books, 2011 ch. 20-21; see also the description of Heinlein correspondence here \\"Universe\\" appeared in the same issue under Heinlein's name. The story is collected in The Worlds of Robert A. Heinlein in 1966, Expanded Universe in 1980, and the Science Fiction Book Club omnibus Off the Main Sequence: The Other Science Fiction Stories of Robert A. Heinlein in 2005. An Italian translation appeared in 1967 and a German translation in 1972.ISFDB publication history Plot John DeFries, the narrator, is the campaign manager of Clyde C. Manning, a freshman congressman and military veteran who received a medical discharge for a heart condition. DeFries chose the congressman because \\"he was liberal [but] was tough-minded\\" enough to attract conservative support. In 1941 Manning is recalled to active duty with the rank of Colonel, and takes deFries as his adjutant. He is appointed to head a secret, top-priority project with unlimited funding, with the aim of developing a nuclear weapon before the Nazis do so. The project makes little progress into 1944. World War II is a stalemate; the British and Germans continue to bomb each other's cities, while the United States, Soviet Union (renamed \\"The Eurasian Union\\"), and Japan stay out. Manning hears of fish dying in Chesapeake Bay where the by-products of Dr. Estelle Karst's research into artificial radioactive materials are being dumped. She was a laboratory assistant of Otto Hahn, the first man to characterize induced fission in uranium, and fled Germany \\"to escape a pogrom\\".According to Heinlein biographer William H. Patterson, the Karst character is \\"an homage to Lise Meitner, who worked out the necessary mathematical support for the idea of fission in 1939 on a train fleeing Nazi Germany.\\" Meitner, who was Hahn's co-worker, had to leave Germany in 1938 because of her Jewish origin. See Patterson's comments here Karst is working on radioactive materials for medical uses, but Manning sees its potential as a radiological weapon. Over Karst's objections, by Christmas 1944 the United States is in possession of nearly 10,000 \\"units\\" of radioactive dust, a \\"unit\\" being defined as the quantity which \\"would take care of a thousand men, at normal dispersion\\"; enough to kill the entire population of a large city such as Berlin. Manning seriously considers ordering that all people aware of the secret, including himself, be put to death and all records destroyed. He rejects that course because someone else, perhaps German or Russian, is certain to rediscover it. Instead, Manning in 1945 convinces the President to use the dust against Germany.The reader is told that the President that meets Manning is standing, which means that he is not Franklin Delano Roosevelt. From several hints, such as the President being described as short of stature and fluent in German, Heinlein implies that the President is New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia. In For Us, the Living, Heinlein's first novel, Heinlein foresaw La Guardia being elected President for two consecutive terms in the 1950s. In \\"Solution Unsatisfactory\\", Stalin dies in 1941 and Nazi Germany has a new F√ºhrer by 1945 with no mention of what happened to Hitler. Since America is officially not in the war, the Americans give the dust to Britain but at the price of the British accepting a complete US ascendancy in the postwar world. The Americans warn the Germans by demonstrating what the dust does to cattle, dropping leaflets over Germany, and having the President speak to the F√ºhrer, but the Germans refuse to surrender. RAF bombers scatter the dust over Berlin and leave no survivors. The Nazi regime collapses and the new government surrenders. Karst commits suicide by exposing herself to the dust. Manning warns the Cabinet of the great dangers of the new situation, introducing the concepts of the nuclear arms race, mutual assured destruction, and second strike capability. He convinces the President and Cabinet that the only solution is to use the American nuclear monopoly while it still exists. Any other world power, such as the Eurasian Union, might create such dust and bomb the United States within weeks. Still a congressman, Manning convinces the President that there is no time to get Congressional approval and that the Constitution must be bypassed. The United States issues a \\"Peace Proclamation\\" which essentially demands the immediate and unconditional surrender of the rest of the world. All other states are required to disarm and to hand over all long-range civilian and military aircraft, since any airplane can spread the dust. The prohibition on commercial airlines applies to America also; the Army will manage any required civilian air travel. Most of the world complies. The Eurasians did invent the dust for themselves as Manning had warned, and launch a surprise attack. The American victory in the \\"Four-Day War\\" owes much to Manning, who had arranged for Congress and President to be outside Washington ahead of the attack, and false rumors of plague to empty New York; nonetheless, 800,000 are killed in Manhattan alone. Eurasian documents completely vindicate Manning's unconstitutional policies; had the President waited for congressional approval, America would have lost the war. Manning becomes lifetime head of the new Peace Patrol, with a worldwide monopoly over the radioactive dust and the aircraft which can deliver it. He opens schools for the indoctrination of cadet patrolmen from any race, color, or nationality. They will patrol the sky and \\"guard the peace\\" of any country but their own, and would be forbidden to return to their original country for the entire duration of their service; \\"a deliberately expatriated band of Janizaries, with an obligation only to the Commission and the race, and welded together with a carefully nurtured esprit de corps.\\" Manning does not have time to complete his original plans for the Patrol. In 1951, the President dies in a plane crash; his isolationist successor demands Manning's resignation and intends to dismantle the Patrol. As Manning argues with the President, planes loaded with radioactive dust and piloted by non-Americans appear overhead. Manning is willing to kill himself and treat the capital of the United States as he would treat any other place which he perceives a \\"threat to world peace\\". He wins the standoff and becomes the undisputed military dictator of the world. DeFries (himself dying from radiation poisoning) doubts that Manning, now the most-hated man on Earth, can succeed in making the Patrol self-perpetuating and trustworthy. There is no way of knowing how long Manning will live, given his weak heart. The narrator concludes: Themes Though it deals not with fission bombs, but rather with a radioisotope dust weapon, \\"Solution Unsatisfactory\\" accurately predicted many aspects of the development of nuclear arms and the dilemmas they pose, a year before President Roosevelt authorized the Manhattan Project led by General Leslie Groves. Scientific advisors wrote a 1943 memo to Groves entitled \\"Use of Radioactive Materials as a Military WeaponJames B. Conant, A. H. Compton, and H. C. Urey, Use of Radioactive Materials as a Military Weapon , 30 October 1943\\": While not part of Heinlein's Future History, the story also marks the first appearance of a \\"Patrol\\" in Heinlein's works. The concept of a distinct order of pilots totally dedicated to preserving the peace reappears in Heinlein's later works, including the short story \\"The Long Watch\\". The juvenile Space Cadet describes the training and indoctrination of Patrol cadets. Cadets are taught not to ask about another's country or planet of origin, and to admire and seek to emulate Rivera, a legendary Patrolman who ordered the nuclear bombing of his own hometown and died himself in the blast. \\"Solution Unsatisfactory\\" marked the beginning of Heinlein's concern with nuclear weapons. After World War II, Heinlein believed that a nuclear arms race was an urgent problem. He wrote several works on nuclear warfare in the mid-1940s, such as \\"The Last Days of the United States\\", \\"How to be a Survivor\\", and \\"Pie from the Sky\\" but, except for \\"Back of the Moon,\\" they were rejected by publishers.James Gifford, New Heinlein Opus List (PDF) Heinlein wrote:Robert A.

The concept can be used in wireless data networks to disrupt information flow. It is a common form of censorship in totalitarian countries, in order to prevent foreign radio stations in border areas from reaching the country. Jamming is usually distinguished from interference that can occur due to device malfunctions or other accidental circumstances. Devices that simply cause interference are regulated differently. Unintentional \\"jamming\\" occurs when an operator transmits on a busy frequency without first checking whether it is in use, or without being able to hear stations using the frequency. Another form of unintentional jamming occurs when equipment accidentally radiates a signal, such as a cable television plant that accidentally emits on an aircraft emergency frequency. Distinction between \\"jamming\\" and \\"interference\\" Originally the terms were used interchangeably but nowadays most radio users use the term \\"jamming\\" to describe the deliberate use of radio noise or signals in an attempt to disrupt communications (or prevent listening to broadcasts) whereas the term \\"interference\\" is used to describe unintentional forms of disruption (which are far more common). However, the distinction is still not universally applied. For inadvertent disruptions, see electromagnetic compatibility. Method Intentional communications jamming is usually aimed at radio signals to disrupt control of a battle. A transmitter, tuned to the same frequency as the opponents' receiving equipment and with the same type of modulation, can, with enough power, override any signal at the receiver. Digital wireless jamming for signals such as Bluetooth and WiFi is possible with very low power. The most common types of this form of signal jamming are random noise, random pulse, stepped tones, warbler, random keyed modulated CW, tone, rotary, pulse, spark, recorded sounds, gulls, and sweep-through. These can be divided into two groups: obvious and subtle. Obvious jamming is easy to detect because it can be heard on the receiving equipment. It usually is some type of noise, such as stepped tones (bagpipes), random-keyed code, pulses, music (often distorted), erratically warbling tones, highly distorted speech, random noise (hiss), and recorded sounds. Various combinations of these methods may be used, often accompanied by regular morse identification signal to enable individual transmitters to be identified in order to assess their effectiveness. For example, China, which used jamming extensively and still does, plays a loop of traditional Chinese music while it is jamming channels (cf. Attempted jamming of numbers stations). The purpose of this type of jamming is to block reception of transmitted signals and to cause a nuisance to the receiving operator. One early Soviet attempt at jamming Western broadcasters used the noise from the diesel generator that was powering the jamming transmitter. Subtle jamming is jamming during which no sound is heard on the receiving equipment. The radio does not receive incoming signals; yet everything seems superficially normal to the operator. These are often technical attacks on modern equipment, such as \\"squelch capture\\". Thanks to the FM capture effect, frequency modulated broadcasts may be jammed, unnoticed, by a simple unmodulated carrier. The receiver locks on to the larger carrier signal, and hence will ignore the FM signal that carries the information. Digital signals use complex modulation techniques, such as QPSK. These signals are very robust in the presence of interfering signals. But the signal relies on hand shaking between the transmitter and receiver to identify and determine security settings and method of high-level transmission. If the jamming device sends initiation data packets, the receiver will begin its state machine to establish two-way data transmission. A jammer will loop back to the beginning instead of completing the handshake. This method jams the receiver in an infinite loop where it keeps trying to initiate a connection but never completes it, which effectively blocks all legitimate communication. Bluetooth and other consumer radio protocols such as WiFi have built-in detectors, so that they transmit only when the channel is free. Simple continuous transmission on a given channel will continuously stop a transmitter transmitting, hence jamming the receiver from ever hearing from its intended transmitter. Other jammers work by analysing the packet headers and, depending on the source or destination, selectively transmitting over the end of the message, corrupting the packet. = Types of jammers = Portable jammers are phone-sized and low-powered devices. They can block data delivery at a distance up to 15 meters without barriers. * Stationary jammers are more expensive and powerful. They usually have a larger jamming radius and wider frequency band. Strong jammers can require additional cooling as they can overheat. Stationary jammers usually have a range of 100 meters and require a power supply of 230 V. * Self-made jammers are low-power devices that work over short ranges. However, the coverage can be extended using broadband amplifiers.  History  During World War II, ground radio operators would attempt to mislead pilots by false instructions in their own language, in what was more precisely a spoofing attack than jamming. Radar jamming is also important to disrupt use of radar used to guide an enemy's missiles or aircraft. Modern secure communication techniques use such methods as spread spectrum modulation to resist the deleterious effects of jamming. Jamming of foreign radio broadcast stations has often been used in wartime (and during periods of tense international relations) to prevent or deter citizens from listening to broadcasts from enemy countries. However, such jamming is usually of limited effectiveness because the affected stations usually change frequencies, put on additional frequencies and/or increase transmission power. Jamming has also occasionally been used by the governments of Germany (during World War II), Israel, Cuba, Iraq, Iran (during the Iran-Iraq War), China, North and South Korea and several Latin American countries, as well as by Ireland against pirate radio stations such as Radio Nova. The United Kingdom government used two coordinated, separately located transmitters to jam the offshore radio ship, Radio North Sea International off the coast of Britain in 1970. = World War II = In occupied Europe the Nazis attempted to jam broadcasts to the continent from the BBC and other allied stations. Along with increasing transmitter power and adding extra frequencies, attempts were made to counteract the jamming by dropping leaflets over cities instructing listeners to construct a directional loop aerial that would enable them to hear the stations through the jamming. In the Netherlands such aerials were nicknamed \\"moffenzeef\\" (English: \\"kraut sieve\\"). =Cold War era= Soviet-era jammer tower in Minsk Since the Soviet Union started jamming Western radio broadcasts to the Soviet Union in 1948 the primary targets have been the BBC External Broadcasting Services, Voice of America (VOA) and RFE/RL. Western nations had allowed jamming prior to World War II , but in the post-War era the Western view has been that jamming violates the freedom of information while the Soviet view has been that under the international law principle of national sovereignty jamming is an acceptable response to foreign radio broadcasts. During much of the Cold War, Soviet (and Eastern Bloc) jamming of some Western broadcasters led to a \\"power race\\" in which broadcasters and jammers alike repeatedly increased their transmission power, utilised highly directional antennas and added extra frequencies (known as \\"barrage\\" or \\"frequency diversity\\" broadcasting) to the already heavily overcrowded shortwave bands to such an extent that many broadcasters not directly targeted by the jammers (including pro-Soviet stations) suffered from the rising levels of noise and interference. There were also periods when China and the Soviet Union jammed each other's programmes. The Soviet Union also jammed Albanian programmes at times. Some parts of the world were more impacted by these broadcasting practices than others * Eurasia (worst affected, including mediumwave frequencies particularly 720 kHz used by RFE) * North Asia, Americas and Sub- Saharan Africa (partly affected) * Australasia, South America (rarely affected) Meanwhile, some listeners in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc devised ingenious methods (such as homemade directional loop antennas) to hear the Western stations through the noise. Because radio propagation on shortwave can be difficult to predict reliably, listeners sometimes found that there were days/times when the jamming was particularly ineffective because radio fading (due to atmospheric conditions) was affecting the jamming signals but favouring the broadcasts (a phenomenon sometimes dubbed \\"twilight immunity\\"). On other days of course the reverse was the case. There were also times when jamming transmitters were (temporarily) off air due to breakdowns or maintenance. The Soviets (and most of their Eastern bloc allies) used two types of jamming transmitter. Skywave jamming covered a large area but for the reasons described was of limited effectiveness. Groundwave jamming was more effective but only over a small area and was thus used only in/near major cities throughout the Eastern Bloc. Both types of jamming were less effective on higher shortwave frequencies (above 15 MHz); however, many radios in the Soviet Union didn't cover the higher bands. Skywave jamming was usually accompanied by morse signals in order to enable (coded) identification of the jamming station in order that Soviet monitoring posts could assess the effectiveness of each station. In 1987 after decades of generally refusing to acknowledge that such jamming was even taking place the Soviets finally stopped jamming western broadcasts with the exception of RFE/RL which continued to be jammed for several months into 1988. Previously there had been periods when some individual Eastern bloc countries refrained from jamming Western broadcasts but this varied widely by time and country. In general outside of the Soviet Union itself Bulgaria was one of the most prolific operators of jamming transmitters in the Eastern bloc with East Germany the least. While western governments may have occasionally considered jamming broadcasts from Eastern Bloc stations, it was generally accepted that doing so would be a pointless exercise. Ownership of shortwave radios was less common in western countries than in the Soviet Union where, due to the vast physical size of the country, many domestic stations were relayed on shortwave as it was the only practical way to cover remote areas. Additionally, western governments were generally less afraid of intellectual competition from the Eastern Bloc. In Francoist Spain the dictatorship jammed for decades Radio Espa√±a Independiente, the radio station of the Communist Party of Spain which broadcast from Moscow (1941‚Äì1955) and Bucharest (1955‚Äì1977). It was the most important clandestine broadcaster in Spain and the regime considered it a threat, since it allowed its citizens to skip the censorship of the local media. Money and technological assistance for the jamming came from the United States. However, in Latin America there were instances of communist radio stations such as Radio Venceremos being jammed, allegedly by the CIA, while there were short lived instances where Britain jammed some Egyptian (during the Suez Crisis), Greek (prior to Cyprus gaining independence) and Rhodesian stations. =Post Cold War (1989‚Äìpresent)= China In 2002, China acquired standard short-wave radio-broadcasting equipment designed for general public radio-broadcasting and technical support from Thales Broadcast Multimedia, a former subsidiary of the French state-owned company Thales Group. * Thales jamming technology operates only at power levels below 500 kW (for its shortwave jamming products). * Adele Milna (BSEE) of Continental Electronics (in an audio file held at shortwave.org) claims that China has duplicated his company's 100 kW, 250 kW shortwave transmitters. It is unclear if these products were indeed duplicated or if broadcast jamming (as opposed to future product sales) were a reason for the duplication. Iran Debates have been raised in Iran regarding the possible health hazards of satellite jamming. Iranian officials including the health minister have claimed that jamming has no health risk for humans. However, the minister of communication has recently admitted that satellite jamming has 'serious effects' and has called for identification of jamming stations so they can put a stop to this practice. The government has generally denied any involvement in jamming and claimed they are sent from unknown sources. According to some sources IRGC is the organization behind satellite jamming in Iran. Russia The Russian Armed Forces have, since the summer of 2015, begun using a multi-functional EW weapon system in Ukraine, known as Borisoglebsk 2. It is postulated that this system has defeated communications in parts of that country, including mobile telephony and GPS systems.Johansen, P. A., \\"Putin's new super weapon frightens NATO\\", Svenska Dagbladet (\\"They've defeated communications and GPS systems and are rendering inoperable the most modern weapon systems. Perhaps even the new F-35 fighter aircraft will not stand up against the new technology. Russia's new weapon frightens the Americans and NATO.\\") Other countries Since the early 1960s, the practice of radio jamming has been very common in Cuba, blocking not only American government funded radio stations (such as Voice of America) but also radio stations owned and/or operated by (or selling airtime to) Cuban exile groups transmitting from Miami, such as La Cubanisima, Radio Mambi, WWFE La Poderosa and Cadena Azul. The same practice has been applied to Radio y Televisi√≥n Mart√≠, operated by the U.S. Information Agency since 1985. *North Korea and South Korea still regularly jam some of each other's radio (and sometimes television) stations. * Several Middle Eastern countries (particularly Iran) jam shortwave broadcasts (and even occasionally attempt to jam satellite TV signals) targeted at their countries. * Pakistan has contemplated jamming pirate radio stations operated by the Taliban in all jails across Pakistan. This decision has led to an outcry from Pakistani cellular operators, who state that most of the jails lie in urban areas with a resultant impact on the cellular service of all operators in the adjacent area of jails. * Ethiopia has jammed the DW and VOA transmissions as well as ESAT Ethiopian Satellite Television# and Eritrean radio stations. * Vietnam jams the Vietnamese service of Radio Free Asia with a \\"siren\\" jammer. * In Nigeria, the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission has claimed jamming signal of Radio Biafra. * In South Africa, the use of wireless signal jammers is illegal. There is a single exception to this rule. South Africa‚Äôs State Security Cluster may, in certain instances, employ signal jammers. Legal instruments Relevant legal instruments include the International Telecommunications Conventions (ITC) governing the apportionment of the world's radio frequency spectrum. Each ITC since 1947 has included a provision that radio stations can not result in harmful interference to radio services of other signatories. The United Nations does not have enforcement power over the terms which are not always followed by the signatories. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the earliest articulation of the principle of freedom of information claimed by Western states as permitting their broadcasts into the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that all persons have a fundamental right to \\"seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media without regard to frontiers\\", but the breadth is limited by Article 29 which states that the exercise of rights and freedoms may be limited by \\"the just requirements of morality, public order, and the general welfare in a democratic society\\". The 1950 UN Resolution on Jamming concerns the application of the freedom of information principle to the specific matter of jamming. At around the same time freedom of information was applied retroactively under the Draft Convention on Freedom of Information, but was dropped from the General Assembly agenda in 1973. In fiction Radio jamming (or \\"comm jamming\\") is a common plot element in the Star Wars franchise. In Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, when the Rebel fleet approaches the Galactic Empire's force, believing themselves to be launching a surprise attack, General Lando Calrissian realizes the Empire is jamming their signals, and therefore know they are approaching. In the film Star Trek II, after receiving a distress call from the space station Regula I, Captain Kirk attempts to establish communications, but the Enterprise's comm officer Lt. Uhura reports that further transmissions are \\"jammed at the source\\".

His work on Vlad Dracula includes a series of bestselling books that he co-authored with his colleague Raymond T. McNally. Along with serving as Director of the East European Research Center at Boston College, Florescu was also a philanthropist and an adviser to Edward Kennedy on Balkan and Eastern European affairs. At the time of his death, Radu Florescu was considered the patriarch of the Florescu family. Life =Escape from Romania= Florescu was born in Bucharest to an aristocratic family, one of the oldest of the extant Romanian boyar families. He left Romania at the outbreak of World War II and moved to London, as his father, a pro-Allied diplomat who served under Romanian Minister Viorel Tilea to the United Kingdom, defied a recall order from the pro-Axis government of Ion Antonescu.\\"Radu Florescu, Scholar Who Linked Dracula and Vlad the Impaler, Dies at 88\\".

Science & Society Picture Library, 15 February 1941. After leaving St. Edward's School, Oxford, Florescu received a scholarship to study history (BA, MA) at Christ Church, Oxford. He moved to Indiana University-Bloomington in the United States for his doctorate. =Boston during the Cold War= With one child, Nicholas, born in Austin, Texas, Radu Florescu moved east and began his academic career as a Professor of history at Boston College. In the Boston area, he will have 3 more children: John (1954), Radu (1961), and Alexandra (1963). At Boston College, he joined forces with Raymond T. McNally, and the two began their research on Vlad the Impaler. Then with McNally and Matei Cazacu, of the Paris Institut des Hautes Etudes, Florescu will go on to write six books on Vlad the Impaler's life. Alongside his work on Vlad the Impaler, Florescu would write seven more books on East European History and on the history of Romania such as The Struggle Against Russia in the Romanian principalities, 1821-1854. Radu Florescu created a diplomatic bridge between the United States and Romania. He advised Edward Kennedy on matters of the Balkans, and also served as the press liaison for the White House during the state visit of President Richard Nixon in 1969 in Romania. In 1986, Florescu became the Director of the East European Research Center at Boston College and remained in that position until his retirement in 2008. In that function, he organized symposiums on themes varying from the diffusion of Thracian culture in antiquity to the rise of antisemitism in interwar Romania. =Post-revolution Romania= From 1996 to 2004, Florescu served as Honorary Consul for New England by the Romanian Foreign Ministry, the first person to hold such a position in the United States. His first job as honorary consul was to oversee voting by Boston-area Romanian citizens in one of the first democratic Romanian elections since the Revolution of 1989. After the Revolution of 1989, he also organized visits of Romanian presidents, and members of the Romanian Royal House to Harvard University, The John F. Kennedy library and Boston City Hall. He was Emeritus Honorary Consul. In his retirement from France and Poiana Brasov, Professor Florescu, repurposed the East European Research Centre to create an annual scholarship for several gifted Romanian teenagers to study in the Boston area during summer months. These scholarships still continue to this day. His son, John M. Florescu, serves on the board of Educational Enrichment for Romanian Children. Upon his death, the Romanian royal family released a statement of condolences and recognition for Florescu's work.\\" A murit Radu Florescu.

Dracula research In his bestseller In Search of Dracula (1972), co-authored with Raymond T. McNally, he claimed that the brutal Vlad III, voivod of the principality of Wallachia, was the inspiration for Bram Stoker's Dracula. Vlad was a member of the House of DrƒÉcule»ôti, and Stoker's novel took place in real locations such as Transylvania and Tihuta Pass, including even correct rail lines. For this reason, Florescu concluded that the main character must also be inspired by facts. Vlad »öepe»ô, known for the slaughter of many Saxons and Ottomans, with a penchant for impaling his enemies on stakes, was the logical choice as the model for Dracula. The book was translated into 15 languages and boosted the Romanian tourism industry as young Westerners flocked to Romania to trace the footsteps of the historical Dracula. Florescu also wrote about literary creations like Frankenstein with In Search of Frankenstein (1975) and the Pied Piper of Hamelin with In Search of the Pied Piper (2005). In the former, Florescu advocated the theory that the German theologian, alchemist, anatomist, and physician Johann Konrad Dippel was the inspiration for Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein.

Concepts that blanket the radar with signals so its display cannot be read are normally known as jamming, while systems that produce confusing or contradictory signals are known as deception, but it is also common for all such systems to be referred to as jamming. There are two general classes of radar jamming, mechanical and electronic. Mechanical jamming entails reflecting enemy radio signals in various ways to provide false or misleading target signals to the radar operator. Electronic jamming works by transmitting additional radio signals towards enemy receivers, making it difficult to detect real target signals, or take advantage of known behaviors of automated systems like radar lock-on to confuse the system. Various counter- countermeasures can sometimes help radar operators maintain target detection despite jamming. Mechanical jamming Mechanical jamming is caused by devices that reflect or re-reflect radar energy back to the radar to produce false target returns on the operator's scope. Mechanical jamming devices include chaff, corner reflectors, and decoys. *Chaff is made of different length metallic strips, which reflect different frequencies, to create a large area of false returns in which a real contact would be difficult to detect. Modern chaff is usually aluminum-coated glass fibers of various lengths. Their extremely low weight and small size allow them to form a dense, long-lasting cloud of interference. This cloud is only effective in the range cell that it occupies. The slow movement of the chaff (compared to a flying target) makes it easily discriminated, based on the lacking Doppler shift. Ships, on the other hand,can benefit greatly from a slow-moving chaff cloud. The cloud is released within the resolution cell of the ship and moves with the wind in one direction. The ship then escapes in another direction. The decoy (chaff cloud) should have a larger radar cross-section (RCS) than the target, so the radar tracks it. *Corner reflectors have the same effect as chaff but are physically very different. Corner reflectors are many-sided objects that re-radiate radar energy mostly back toward its source. An aircraft cannot carry as many corner reflectors as it can chaff. *Decoys are maneuverable flying objects that are intended to deceive a radar operator into believing that they are actually aircraft. They are especially dangerous because they can clutter up a radar with false targets making it easier for an attacker to get within weapons range and neutralize the radar. Corner reflectors can be fitted on decoys to make them appear larger than they are, thus furthering the illusion that a decoy is an actual aircraft. Some decoys have the capability to perform electronic jamming or drop chaff. Decoys also have a deliberately sacrificial purpose i.e. defenders may fire guided missiles at the decoys, thereby depleting limited stocks of expensive weaponry which might otherwise have been used against genuine targets.  Electronic jamming  Luftwaffe Tornado ECR (Electric Combat / Reconnaissance). This fighter specializes in electronic warfare. Electronic jamming is a form of electronic warfare where jammers radiate interfering signals toward an enemy's radar, blocking the receiver with highly concentrated energy signals. The two main technique styles are noise techniques and repeater techniques. The three types of noise jamming are spot, sweep, and barrage. *Spot jamming or spot noise occurs when a jammer focuses all of its power on a single frequency. This overwhelms the reflection of the original radar signal off the targets, the \\"skin return\\" or \\"skin reflection\\", making it impossible to pick out the target on the radar display. This technique is only useful against radars that broadcast on a single frequency, and can be countered by changing the frequency or other operational parameters like the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) so the jammer is no longer broadcasting on the same frequency or at the right times. While multiple jammers could possibly jam a range of frequencies, this would consume many resources and be of little effect against modern frequency-agile radars that constantly change their broadcasts. *Sweep jamming is a modification of spot jamming where the jammer's full power is shifted from one frequency to another. While this has the advantage of being able to jam multiple frequencies in quick succession, it does not affect them all at the same time, and thus limits the effectiveness of this type of jamming. Although, depending on the error checking in the device(s) this can render a wide range of devices effectively useless. *Barrage jamming is a further modification of sweep jamming in which the jammer changes frequencies so rapidly it appears to be a constant radiator across its entire bandwidth. The advantage is that multiple frequencies can be jammed essentially simultaneously. The first effective barrage jammer was introduced as the carcinotron in the early 1950s, and was so effective it was believed that all long-range radar systems might be rendered useless. However, the jamming effect can be limited because this requires the jammer to spread its full power between these frequencies‚Äîthe effectiveness against each frequency decreases with the number of frequencies covered. The creation of extremely powerful multi-frequency radars like Blue Riband offset the effectiveness of the carcinotron. *Base jamming is a new type of barrage jamming whereby one radar is jammed effectively at its source at all frequencies. However, all other radars continue working normally. *Pulse jamming produces noise pulses with period depending on radar mast rotation speed thus creating blocked sectors from directions other than the jammer, making it harder to discover the jammer location. *Cover pulse jamming creates a short noise pulse when radar signal is received thus concealing any aircraft flying behind the jammer with a block of noise. *Digital radio frequency memory, or DRFM jamming, or Repeater jamming is a repeater technique that manipulates received radar energy and retransmits it to change the return the radar sees. This technique can change the range the radar detects by changing the delay in transmission of pulses, the velocity the radar detects by changing the Doppler shift of the transmitted signal, or the angle to the plane by using AM techniques to transmit into the sidelobes of the radar. Electronics, radio equipment, and antenna can cause DRFM jamming causing false targets, the signal must be timed after the received radar signal. By analysing received signal strength from side and backlobes and thus getting radar antennae radiation pattern, false targets can be created to directions other than one where the jammer is coming from. If each radar pulse is uniquely coded it is not possible to create targets in directions other than the direction of the jammer *Deceptive jamming uses techniques like \\"range gate pull-off\\" to break a radar lock.Radar Countermeasures: Range Gate Pull- OffEW 101: a first course in electronic warfare By David Adamy, page 196 *Blip enhancement deliberately makes some returns look larger on radar in order to hide their nature. This is used by escort ships to make them look as large as capital ships.

When a target is within this range, the radar receives an adequate target skin return to track it. The burn through range is a function of the target RCS (Radar cross-section), jamming ERP (Effective radiated power), the radars ERP and required J/S (for the jamming to be effective).  Inadvertent jamming  In some cases, jamming of either type may be caused by friendly sources. Inadvertent mechanical jamming is fairly common because it is indiscriminate and affects any nearby radars, hostile or not. Electronic jamming can also be inadvertently caused by friendly sources, usually powerful EW platforms operating within range of the affected radar.  Countermeasures  Home-on-jam missile attacking an SPJ aircraft. Home-on-jam countermeasure. *Constantly alternating the frequency that the radar operates on (frequency agility) over a spread-spectrum will limit the effectiveness of most jamming, making it easier to read through it. Modern jammers can track a predictable frequency change, so the more random the frequency change, the more likely it is to counter the jammer. *Cloaking the outgoing signal with random noise makes it more difficult for a jammer to figure out the frequency that a radar is operating on. *Limiting unsecure radio communication concerning the jamming and its effectiveness is also important. The jammer could be listening, and if they know that a certain technique is effective, they could direct more jamming assets to employ this method. *The most important method to counter radar jammers is operator training. Any system can be fooled with a jamming signal but a properly trained operator pays attention to the raw video signal and can detect abnormal patterns on the radar screen. *The best indicator of jamming effectiveness to the jammer is countermeasures taken by the operator. The jammer does not know if their jamming is effective before operator starts changing radar transmission settings. *Using EW countermeasures will give away radar capabilities thus on peacetime operations most military radars are used on fixed frequencies, at minimal power levels and with blocked Tx sectors toward possible listeners (country borders) *Mobile fire control radars are usually kept passive when military operations are not ongoing to keep radar locations secret *Active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars are innately harder to jam and can operate in low probability of intercept (LPI) modes to reduce the chance that the radar is detected. *A quantum radar system would automatically detect attempts at deceptive jamming, which might otherwise go unnoticed.\\"Quantum Imaging Technique Heralds Unjammable Aircraft Detection.\\" *Anti-radiation missile (ARM) also known as Home-On-Jam (HOJ) missiles: When a target is self-protective jamming (SPJ), it essentially broadcasts its position. An ARM could be deployed and take out the jamming source. The missile utilizes passive RF homing which reduces its probability of detection. A countermeasure to ARM is not to use self-protective jamming (one could use stand-off jamming, assuming that the missiles has a range no longer than the radar), or have a decoy taking the missile (see ADM-160 MALD and AN/ALE-55 Fiber-Optic Towed Decoy). By towing a decoy/jammer, the decoy maintains a realistic Doppler shift (which tricks the tracker) and lures an ARM away from the target. Stealth  For protective jamming, a small RCS of the protected aircraft improve the jamming efficiency (higher J/S). A lower RCS also reduce the \\"burn-through\\" range. Stealth technologies like radar- absorbent materials can be used to reduce the return of a target.  Interference  While not usually caused by the enemy, interference can greatly impede the ability of an operator to track. Interference occurs when two radars in relatively close proximity (how close they need to be depends on the power of the radars) are operating on the same frequency. This will cause \\"running rabbits\\", a visual phenomenon that can severely clutter up a radar display scope with useless data. Interference is not that common between ground radars, however, because they are not usually placed close enough together. It is more likely that some sort of airborne radar system is inadvertently causing the interference‚Äîespecially when two or more countries are involved. The interference between airborne radars referred to above can sometimes (usually) be eliminated by frequency-shifting the transmitter(s). The other interference often experienced is between the aircraft's own electronic transmitters, i.e. transponders, being picked up by its radar. This interference is eliminated by suppressing the radar's reception for the duration of the transponder's transmission. Instead of \\"bright-light\\" rabbits across the display, one would observe very small black dots. Because the external radar causing the transponder to respond is generally not synchronised with your own radar (i.e. different PRFs [pulse repetition frequency]), these black dots appear randomly across the display and the operator sees through and around them. The returning image may be much larger than the \\"dot\\" or \\"hole\\", as it has become known, anyway. Keeping the transponder's pulse widths very narrow and mode of operation (single pulse rather than multi-pulse) becomes a crucial factor. The external radar could, in theory, come from an aircraft flying alongside your own, or from space. Another factor often overlooked is to reduce the sensitivity of one's own transponder to external radars; i.e., ensure that the transponder's threshold is high. In this way it will only respond to nearby radars‚Äîwhich, after all, should be friendly. One should also reduce the power output of the transponder in like manner.  Jamming police radar  Jamming radar for the purpose of defeating police radar guns is simpler than military-grade radar jamming. The laws about jamming police radars vary by jurisdiction.  Jamming in nature  The jamming of bat sonar by certain tiger moth species has recently been confirmed. This can be seen as nature's equivalent of radar jamming.

St. Louis: Archway Publishing. interurban coaches, motor buses, trolleybuses and railroad cars in the United States for almost ninety years; it was the longest lasting trolley and interurban manufacturer. At its height, Brill was the largest manufacturer of streetcars and interurban cars in the US and produced more streetcars, interurbans and gas-electric cars than any other manufacturer, building more than 45,000 streetcars alone. The company was founded by John George Brill in 1868 as a horsecar manufacturing firm in Philadelphia. Its manufacturing factory complex was located in Southwest Philadelphia at 62nd St and Woodland Avenue adjacent to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad tracks. The Historical Society of Pennsylvania Over the years, it absorbed numerous other manufacturers of trolleys and interurbans such as Kuhlman in Cleveland and Jewett in Indiana. In 1944, with business diminishing, it merged with the American Car and Foundry Company (ACF) to become ACF-Brill. Although the company ceased production in 1954, some of its interurbans served the Philadelphia area until the 1980s. History In 1868, the Brill company was founded as J.G. Brill and Sons. After James Rawle joined the firm in 1872 it was renamed The J.G. Brill Company. In 1902, Brill bought out the American Car Company; in 1904 G. C. Kuhlman Car Company and John Stephenson Company; and in 1907 Wason Manufacturing Company. Brill acquired a controlling share of the Danville Car Company in 1908, dissolving it in 1911, and Canadian railway car builder Preston Car Company in 1921, which ceased operating in 1923. As large orders continued to be won by Brill, new facilities including steel forges and cavernous erecting shops continued to be added in Philadelphia. One particularly large order, received in 1911, was for 1,500 streetcars for the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company. It took two years to build those trolleys with delivery rates at times exceeding a hundred cars a month. All told, more than 30,000 rail vehicles were produced at the Brill plant. In its best years, a workforce of 3,000 Philadelphians was employed by Brill; many of those were skilled laborers and craftsmen. The last rail cars built by J.G. Brill were 25 streamliners for Atlantic City in 1939, and a final 10 trolleys for Red Arrow Lines two years later. Production shifted to rubber-tired vehicles, with more than 8,000 gasoline- and electric-powered buses (trolley buses) built in the 1940s. But by the early 1950s even the bus orders had dried up. In March 1954, the plant was sold to the Penn Fruit Company and a strip mall was built on the eastern end of the site. In 1926, American Car and Foundry Company acquired a controlling interest in what had become the Brill Corporation. The new structure consisted of: * ACF Motors Company, which owned Hall-Scott Motor Car Company (100%) and controlled 90% of Fageol Motors; and * the J.G. Brill Company. In 1944, these two companies merged, forming the ACF-Brill Motors Company.Sebree, Mac; and Ward, Paul (1973). Transit's Stepchild: The Trolley Coach, p. 127. Los Angeles: Interurbans. LCCN 73-84356. In the same year, ACF- Brill licensed Canadian Car and Foundry of Montreal to manufacture and sell throughout Canada motor buses and trolley coaches of their design as Canadian Car-Brill. The firm built about 1,100 trolley buses and a few thousand buses under the name. Brill had earlier (in 1908) established a company in France (Cie. J.G. Brill of Gallardon, which was sold to Electroforge in 1935). In 1946, Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation acquired a controlling interest in ACF-Brill for $7.5 million. Consolidated Vultee was sold the following year to the Nashville Corporation, which in 1951 sold its share to investment firm Allen & Co. In early 1954, the Brill name disappeared when ACF-Brill ceased production and subcontracted its remaining orders. Brill granted licenses to build its vehicles to the Canadian Car and Foundry Company (Peter Witt streetcars, trolley buses and motor buses) and the South Australian Railways (Model 75 railcars).

The lines that operated interurban passenger cars recognized in the mid-1920s that they needed faster, quieter, more power-efficient equipment. Until then, the wooden and most of the steel interurban cars were large, sat high, and were heavy. Streetcars were slow, noisy, and clumsy to operate using the motor controller \\"stand\\" of the time. Car manufacturers such as Cincinnati Car Company (who already in 1922 made a lightweight, albeit slow, interurban), St. Louis Car Company, Pullman, and Brill worked to design equipment for a better ride at high speed, improved passenger comfort, and reduced power consumption. This particularly involved designing low-level trucks (bogies) able to handle rough track at speed. Brill, in conjunction with Westinghouse and General Electric, worked on a new interurban design and on a new streetcar design (the PCC). The interurban design result was the aluminum-and-steel, wind-tunnel-developed, slope-roof \\"Bullet\\" multiple-unit cars, the first of which were purchased in 1931 by the Philadelphia and Western Railroad, a third-rail line running from 69th Street Upper Darby to Norristown in the Philadelphia region. This line still runs as SEPTA's Norristown High Speed Line. The Bullets could attain speeds as high as . They were very successful, and operated until the 1980s, but Brill sold few others. Only the central New York state interurban Fonda, Johnstown, and Gloversville Railroad ordered Bullets, albeit a single-ended, single-unit \\"trolley-ized\\" version. Five were procured in mid-Depression 1932 for passenger business that was rapidly declining. In 1936, the closing FJ&G; sold these Bullets to the Bamberger Railroad in Utah, which ran them in high-speed service between Salt Lake City and Ogden until the mid-1950s. Three of the SEPTA Bullet cars are now at the Seashore Trolley Museum; one is at the Electric City Trolley Museum in Scranton; one is at the Rockhill Trolley Museum in Orbisonia, Pennsylvania; one is at the National Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Missouri; and one is at the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum in Washington, Pennsylvania. A Bamberger Bullet is in the Orange Empire Railroad Museum in Perris, California, and another has been preserved by the Utah State Railroad Museum. A third is a part of a restaurant building in Springville, Utah, but is barely recognizable as a Bullet. Brill look-alike cars in the 2010s Since 2015 the JR Kyushu, one of the constituent companies of Japan Railways Group, has operated the Aru Ressha \\"sweet train\\", a deluxe excursion train. It comprises two power cars and two newly built trailer cars based on a luxury Brill car the railway ordered in 1908 but never used. Scale models of the original cars were used to derive the design.

In 2019, the student population at FSC consisted of 3,073 students along with 130 full-time faculty members. The college offers 50 undergraduate majors and pre-professional programs, graduate programs in nursing, business, and education as well as post-graduate programs in nursing, education, and physical therapy. Florida Southern is the home of the world's largest single-site collection of Frank Lloyd Wright architecture. For its 2011 and 2012 rankings, The Princeton Review selected Florida Southern's campus as the most beautiful in the country. Florida Southern has won 30 national titles in NCAA Division II competition in several sports, men's golf (13 titles), baseball (9), women's golf (4), men's basketball (2), softball (1) and women's lacrosse (1). The college's official mascot is Mocsie the water moccasin, but they are also referenced by their nickname, the Mocs. The official colors of the college and its athletic teams are scarlet and white. History Florida Southern is the oldest four-year private college in the state of Florida. The college was first founded as South Florida Institute in Orlando, Florida in 1883, and moved to nearby Leesburg in 1885. Historians contend that the college's formal establishment occurred when it was sponsored by the United Methodist Church following the move to Leesburg in 1885. It was known as Florida Conference College.https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os- xpm-1995-01-25-9501240660-story.htmlhttp://cdm15558.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p15558coll5 The college moved to Sutherland (now Palm Harbor) in 1901, and changed its name to Southern College in 1906. Due to fires in the early 1920s, it was temporarily relocated to Clearwater Beach and then finally moved to its current location in Lakeland in 1922. In 1935 it was renamed Florida Southern College by the college's board of trustees. Campus The present campus comprises 70 buildings on 110 acres of land and is home to the largest collection of Frank Lloyd Wright architecture in the world. Frank Lloyd Wright:  L1100207Frank Lloyd Wright:  L1100202 listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district due to the historical significance of its buildings. In 2012, the college became a part of the National Historic Landmarks of the United States. In 2011 and 2012, it was selected as the most beautiful campus in America by The Princeton Review. In September 2011, Travel+Leisure listed it as one of the most beautiful campuses in the United States and noted that it was put under watch by the World Monument Fund as an endangered cultural site. The college has undergone many changes to its infrastructure in the last few years. Florida Southern commissioned Robert A. M. Stern, the dean of Yale's architecture program, to lead their large expansion efforts in 2005. Stern is an accomplished American architect who won the Driehaus Architecture Prize in 2011. The Stern-designed Barnett Residential Life Center was completed in 2009. The complex includes Nicholas and Wesley Halls, and houses up to 235 students in lake-view rooms designed to complement Frank Lloyd Wright's existing architecture on campus. Marshall and Vera Lea Rinker bestowed to the school $1.5 million to construct a technology center in 2008. The 4,000 sq.ft. Rinker Technology Center opened in March 2010. According to Stern, his new buildings are intended to \\"honor Wright's historic legacy while putting my own mark on the campus by complementing, not copying, Wright.\\" Stern also designed the Robert E. Christoverson Humanities and the Becker Business Building. In addition to improving the campus proper, FSC also expanded outwardly by acquiring properties in adjacent neighborhoods. The college acquired the Lake Hollingsworth Apartments and Lake Morton Apartments which are about a 12-minute walking distance from campus. In 2011, the school bought, renovated, and furnished Lake Morton Apartments for $5.7 million. As part of the Pathway to Independence Program, upperclassmen and graduate students who are in good standing may be invited to live at this location. =Collection of Frank Lloyd Wright Architecture= Annie Pfeiffer Chapel Frank Lloyd Wright was an influential architect of the twentieth century. In 1938, the Florida Southern College president, Ludd M. Spivey, approached Wright with the task of transforming the 100-acre lakeside orange grove into a modern campus. The collection of Frank Lloyd Wright Architecture at Florida Southern College is called Child of the Sun. The name for the architecture came from Wright's idea of removing the \\"uninspired\\" buildings of the existing campus and replacing them with a campus that would, according to Wright, \\"grow out of the ground and into the light, a child of the sun.\\" The works by Wright include the following: * Annie Pfeiffer Chapel - First completed Frank Lloyd Wright building, begun 1938, dedicated 1941, French-door balconies restored in 2007 * Buckner Building (originally the E.T. Roux Library) - begun 1942, completed 1946 * Ordway Building (originally the Industrial Arts Building) - begun 1950, completed 1952 * Danforth Chapel - begun 1954, completed 1955 * Polk County Science Building (commonly known as Polk Science) - begun 1952, completed 1958 * Watson Fine Building (administration building) - begun 1946, completed 1949 * Water Dome - partially completed 1949, fully completed and restored in 2007 to Wright's original plans * Three Seminars or The L A Raulerson Building (currently the Business Office) - begun 1940, completed 1942, and underwent renovations into one office building in 1958 * The Esplanades - various completion times, currently undergoing restoration around the campus * Sharp Family Tourism and Education Center, also known as the Usonian House, a visitor center and exhibition space constructed according to Wright's 1939 designs for faculty housing =Residential life= Residence Halls *Allan Spivey (first-year, men) *Joseph-Reynolds (first-year, women) *Hollis *Miller *Dell *Jenkins *Publix Commons (includes all sorority houses and most fraternity houses) *Wesley Hall (first completed building of the Barnett Residential Life Center, completed Fall 2008) *Nicholas Hall (second building of the Barnett Residential Life Center, completed Fall 2009) *Colony Arms Apartments *Lake Morton Apartments *Lake Hollingsworth Apartments *Garden Apartments (completed 2016) *Mississippi Apartments =E.T. Roux Library= The E.T. Roux library, typically referred to as simply the \\"Roux Library,\\" is located on the campus of Florida Southern College in Lakeland, FL. Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright for his Child of the Sun campus, the original Roux Library was built between the years of 1941-1945 at the cost of $120,000. The building is circular and housed a multi-tiered reading room in addition to library stacks. In March 1968, the new Roux Library opened in a different location on campus. The new location was designed by Nils Schweizer in a mid-century modern style. Schweitzer was a protege of Frank Lloyd Wright and went on to have a successful architectural career in the state of Florida. After the Roux Library moved in 1968, the original building was renamed the Thad Buckner Building and was used for lectures, seminars, and was the visitor's center for the Child of the Sun campus. Today, the visitor's center has moved into a new location. The space is still used for lectures and can also be rented for private events. Typical of Frank Lloyd Wright style, the original Roux Library was constructed of reinforced concrete and concrete blocks. Long, narrow windows crown the concrete walls and interspersed throughout the concrete walls are small colorful cubes of glass that cast the sunlight in prismatic patterns. Academics Florida Southern College has over 50 undergraduate majors in a variety of disciplines and offers the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Music Education, and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. At the graduate level, the school offers the degrees Master of Business Administration, Master of Accountancy, Master of Arts in Teaching, Master of Education, Master of Science in Nursing, and a Doctoral in Educational Leadership.

Florida Southern uses the learning style of engaged learning, in which the college incorporates engaging, hands-on experiences in every academic program. Florida Southern College was awarded the William M. Burke Presidential Award for Excellence in Experiential Education in 2010. =Barney Barnett School of Business and Free Enterprise= In 2011, the College announced an undisclosed contribution from Carol Jenkins Barnett ('79) (daughter of George W. Jenkins, founder of the giant Lakeland-based grocery chain Publix, for whom the school's gymnasium is named) in honor of her husband, Barney Barnett ('65). The funds would be used to establish the Barney Barnett School of Business and Free Enterprise. This gesture came shortly after Richard W. \\"Bill\\" Becker ('65) gifted $5 million to the School for the construction of a new undergraduate business building. Construction of the Becker Undergraduate Business Building and the Graduate and Executive Building was scheduled to begin late 2012 or early 2013. Like the Barnett Residential Life Center, these two buildings were also to be designed by architect Robert A. M. Stern Undergraduate students at the Barnett School of Business and Free Enterprise study in one of six programs: accounting, business administration, business and free enterprise, finance and economics, healthcare administration, or political economy.http://www.flsouthern.edu/FSC/media/Academics/catalogs/fsc- catalog-2017-2018.pdf p.102 shows there is a Major in Business and Free Enterprise The school also allows students to focus on career tracks in finance, international business, management, marketing, and sport management. The Barnett School also offers the Master of Business Administration to full- time students in its 16-month accelerated program, as well as part-time students in the form of evening and Saturday classes. The Barnett School of Business and Free Enterprise was accredited by AACSB-International in 2013. =School of Arts and Sciences= There are five primary disciplines within the school: communications, fine and performing arts, humanities, natural science and mathematics, and the social and behavioral sciences. The school features a combination of traditional programs and interdisciplinary studies that includes the opportunity for students to design their own major through the \\"Venture into Adventure\\" program. The citrus science program has the nation's only citrus bachelor's degree program, including courses taught by industry leaders. Biology The Division of Biology offers the Bachelor of Science degrees in biology, biochemistry and molecular biology (BMB; in conjunction with the Division of Chemistry), Environmental Studies and Marine Biology. Research courses are required, giving students the opportunity to investigate, compile data and present their results at the semiannual Department of Natural Sciences Poster Competition. Fine arts The music department offers programs for degrees such as a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music in performance, Bachelor of Music Education, and Bachelor of Science in Music Management. The department maintains several large ensembles, including the wind ensemble, symphony band, jazz ensemble, symphony orchestra, and several choral groups. Each large ensemble is featured in concert at least once every semester through the Festival of Fine Arts. Smaller chamber ensembles include the flute choir, clarinet choir, saxophone choir, horn choir, trumpet choir, trombone choir, tuba choir, cello choir, viola choir, percussion ensemble, and vocal chamber ensemble. The opera theater usually produces one fully staged opera every academic year in collaboration with the Imperial Symphony Opera at the Branscomb Auditorium. The music faculty is a group of accomplished performers and teachers, who over the years have been joined by internationally acclaimed performers like Beverly Wolff and Robert MacDonald. Branscomb Memorial Auditorium is located on the Frank Lloyd Wright campus of Florida Southern College in Lakeland, Florida. Architect Nils Schweitzer, a prot√©g√© of Frank Lloyd Wright, designed the structure to complement Wright's original ‚ÄúChild of the Sun‚Äù concept. Construction was completed in 1963. Dedicated to Bishop John Branscomb of the Florida Conference of the United Methodist Church, the auditorium hosted its first performance in 1964. Since that time, the Branscomb Memorial Auditorium stage has presented artists and performing groups from six continents through the college's annual Festival of Fine Arts series. Not only is Branscomb Memorial Auditorium a historic structure, it is acoustically one of the very best concert halls in the United States. With a natural audio reverberation time of approximately 1.3 seconds, it has been compared by many artists to Carnegie Hall. The theater department puts on five main-stage shows a year in the Buckner Theater, including two musicals. A musical theatre major was added in Fall 2013. The College's Festival of Fine Arts is the longest-running theater and musical performance in Polk County and has hosted world-renowned artists Kathleen Battle, Andr√© Watts, I Musici di Roma, Jennifer Larmore, Sylvia McNair, and The Munich Symphony Orchestra. , Florida Southern College was rated #19 Best Theatre Program by the Princeton Review.

Johor was part of the Malaccan Sultanate before the Portuguese conquered Malacca's capital in 1511. At its height, the sultanate controlled modern-day Johor, Riau, and territories stretching from the river Klang to the Linggi and Tanjung Tuan, Muar, Batu Pahat, Singapore, Pulau Tinggi and other islands off the east coast of the Malay peninsula, the Karimun islands, the islands of Bintan, Bulang, Lingga and Bunguran, and Bengkalis, Kampar and Siak in Sumatra. In 1564 the Ottomans conquered the Sultanate during the Ottoman expedition to Aceh. During the colonial era, the mainland part was administered by the British, and the insular part by the Dutch, thus breaking up the sultanate into Johor and Riau. In 1946, the British section became part of the Malayan Union. Two years later, it joined the Federation of Malaya and subsequently, the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. In 1949, the Dutch section became part of Indonesia. Fall of Malacca and the Beginnings of the Old Johore Sultanate In 1511, Malacca fell to the Portuguese and Sultan Mahmud Shah was forced to flee Malacca. The sultan made several attempts to retake the capital but his efforts were fruitless. The Portuguese retaliated and forced the sultan to flee to Pahang. Later, the sultan sailed to Bintan and established a new capital there. With a base established, the sultan rallied the disarrayed Malay forces and organised several attacks and blockades against the Portuguese position. Based at Pekan Tua, Sungai Telur, Johor, the Johor Sultanate was founded by Raja Ali Ibni Sultan Mahmud Melaka, known as Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah II (1528‚Äì1564), in 1528. Although Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah and his successor had to contend with attacks by the Portuguese in Malacca and by the Acehnese in Sumatra, they managed to maintain their hold on the Johor Sultanate. Frequent raids on Malacca caused the Portuguese severe hardship and it helped to convince the Portuguese to destroy the exiled sultan's forces. A number of attempts were made to suppress the Malay but it was not until 1526 that the Portuguese finally razed Bintan to the ground. The sultan then retreated to Kampar in Sumatra and died two years later. He left behind two sons named Muzaffar Shah and Alauddin Riayat Shah II. Muzaffar Shah continued on to establish Perak while Alauddin Riayat Shah became the first sultan of Johor. Triangular war thumb The new sultan established a new capital by the Johor River and, from there, continued to harass the Portuguese in the north. He consistently worked together with his brother in Perak and the Sultan of Pahang to retake Malacca, which by this time was protected by the fort A Famosa. On the northern part of Sumatra around the same period, Aceh Sultanate was beginning to gain substantial influence over the Straits of Malacca. With the fall of Malacca to Christian hands, Muslim traders often skipped Malacca in favour of Aceh or also of Johor's capital Johor Lama (Kota Batu). Therefore, Malacca and Aceh became direct competitors. With the Portuguese and Johor frequently locking horns, Aceh launched multiple raids against both sides to tighten its grip over the straits. The rise and expansion of Aceh encouraged the Portuguese and Johor to sign a truce and divert their attention to Aceh. The truce, however, was short-lived and with Aceh severely weakened, Johor and the Portuguese had each other in their sights again. During the rule of Sultan Iskandar Muda, Aceh attacked Johor in 1613 and again in 1615. Dutch Malacca In the early 17th century, the Dutch reached Southeast Asia. At that time the Dutch were at war with the Portuguese and allied themselves to Johor. Two treaties were signed by Admiral Cornelis Matelief de Jonge on behalf of the Dutch Estates General and Raja Bongsu (Raja Seberang) of Johor in May and September 1606. Finally in 1641, the Dutch and Johor forces headed by Bendahara Skudai, defeated the Portuguese. As per the agreement with Johor struck in May 1606, the Dutch took control of Malacca and agreed not to seek territories or wage war with Johor. Finally in January 1641, the Dutch (attacking by land and the sea) and Johor forces (attacking by land and under the leadership of Bendahara Skudai), defeated the Portuguese at Malacca. By the time the fortress at Malacca surrendered, the town's population had already been greatly decimated by famine and disease (the plague). As per article 1 of the agreement with Johor ratified in May 1606, the Dutch assumed control of the town of Malacca and also of some surrounding settlements. Malacca then became a territory under the control of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and formally remained a Dutch possession until the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 was signed. Johor-Jambi war With the fall of Portuguese Malacca in 1641 and the decline of Aceh due to the growing power of the Dutch, Johor started to re-established itself as a power along the Straits of Malacca during the reign of Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah III (1623‚Äì1677). Its influence extended to Pahang, Sungei Ujong, Malacca, Klang and the Riau Archipelago. During the triangular war, Jambi also emerged as a regional economic and political power in Sumatra. Initially there was an attempt of an alliance between Johor and Jambi with a promised marriage between the heir Raja Muda and daughter of the Pengeran of Jambi. However, the Raja Muda married instead the daughter of the Laksamana Abdul Jamil who, concerned about the dilution of power from such an alliance, offered his own daughter for marriage instead. The alliance therefore broke down, and a 13-year war then ensued between Johor and the Sumatran state beginning in 1666. The war was disastrous for Johor as Johor's capital, Batu Sawar, was sacked by Jambi in 1673. The Sultan escaped to Pahang and died four years later. His successor, Sultan Ibrahim (1677‚Äì1685), then engaged the help of the Bugis in the fight to defeat Jambi. Johor would eventually prevail in 1679, but also ended in a weakened position as the Bugis refused to go home, and the Minangkabaus of Sumatra also started to assert their influence. After the sacking of Batu Sawar in 1673, the capital of Johor was frequently moved to avoid the threat of attack from Jambi. All through its history, the rulers of Johor had in fact constantly shifted their centre of power many times in their efforts to keep the sultanate together. Johor Lama (Kota Batu) was initially founded by Alauddin Riayat Shah II but was sacked by the Acehnese in 1564. It was then moved to Seluyut, later back to Johor Lama during the reign of Ali Jalla (1571‚Äì1597) which was sacked by the Portuguese in 1587, then to Batu Sawar, and Lingga (again sacked by the Portuguese). This is followed by a period with no fixed capital (places included Tanah Puteh and Makam Tauhid) during the reign of Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah III before he moved it to Batu Sawar in 1640. After Batu Sawar was sacked by Jambi, later capitals included Kota Tinggi, Riau, and Pancur. Golden Age In the 17th century with Malacca ceasing to be an important port, Johor became the dominant regional power. The policy of the Dutch in Malacca drove traders to Riau, a port controlled by Johor. The trade there far surpassed that of Malacca. The VOC was unhappy with that but continued to maintain the alliance because the stability of Johor was important to trade in the region. The Sultan provided all the facility required by the traders. Under the patronage of the Johor elites, traders were protected and prospered.E. M. Jacobs, Merchant in Asia, , 2006, page 207 With a wide range of goods available and favourable prices, Riau boomed. Ships from various places such as Cambodia, Siam, Vietnam and all over the Malay Archipelago came to trade. The Bugis ships made Riau the centre for spices. Items found in China or example, cloth and opium were traded with locally sourced ocean and forest products, tin, pepper and locally grown gambier. Duties were low, and cargoes could be discharged or stored easily. Traders found they do not need to extend credit, for the business was good. Like Malacca before it, Riau was also the centre of Islamic studies and teaching. Many orthodox scholars from the Muslim heartlands like the Indian Subcontinent and Arabia were housed in special religious hostels, while devotees of Sufism could seek initiation into one of the many Tariqah (Sufi Brotherhood) which flourished in Riau. In many ways, Riau managed to recapture some of the old Malacca glory. Both became prosperous due to trade but there was a major difference; Malacca was also great due to its territorial conquest. Bugis and Minangkabau influence in the kingdom The last sultan from the Malaccan dynasty, Sultan Mahmud Shah II, was a person of unstable disposition. When Bendahara Habib was the Bendahara, he effectively shielded the people from the Sultan 's idiosyncrasies. After the demise of Bendehara Habib, he was replaced by Bendahara Abdul Jalil. As the Bendahara was only a cousin, he could not rein in the Sultan 's eccentric behaviour. The Sultan ordered the pregnant wife of a noble, Orang Kaya Megat Sri Rama killed, as she had taken a slice of the royal jack fruit. Subsequently, the Sultan was killed by Megat Sri Rama in revenge. Sultan Mahmud Shah II of Johor had died in 1699 without an heir. The Orang Kayas, who were normally tasked with advising the Sultan, were in a fix. They went to Muar to meet Sa Akar DiRaja, Raja Temenggong of Muar, the Sultan's uncle and asked for his counsel. He pointed out that Bendahara Abdul Jalil should inherit the throne.The Family Tree of Raja Temenggung of Muar, traditional sources, Puan Wan Maimunah, 8th descendant of Sa Akar DiRaja The problem was resolved when the viceroy Bendahara Abdul Jalil was declared the new sultan and proclaimed Sultan Abdul Jalil IV. Many, particularly the Orang Laut (islanders from Johor maritime territories), however felt that the declaration was improper. The Bugis, who played an important role in defeating Jambi two decades earlier, had a huge influence in Johor. Apart from the Malays, another influential faction in Johor at that time were the Minangkabau. Both the Bugis and the Minangkabau realised how the death of Sultan Mahmud II had provided them with the chance to exert power in Johor. The Minangkabau introduced a Minangkabau prince, Raja Kecil from Siak who claimed he was the posthumous son of Sultan Mahmud II. The prince met with the Bugis and promised the Bugis wealth and political power if they helped the prince to win the throne. However, Raja Kecil broke his promise and installed himself as the new Sultan of Johor (Sultan Abdul Jalil Rahmat Shah) without the knowledge of the Bugis. Sultan Abdul Jalil IV fled to Pahang where he was later killed by an assassin hired by Raja Kecil. Dissatisfied with Raja Kecil's accession, the son of Sultan Abdul Jalil IV, Raja Sulaiman, asked Daeng Parani of the Bugis to aid him in his quest to reclaim the throne. In 1722, Raja Kecil was dethroned by Raja Sulaiman's supporters with the assistance of the Bugis. Raja Sulaiman became the new Sultan of Johore, but he was a weak ruler and became a puppet of the Bugis. Daeng Parani's brother, Daeng Merewah, who was made Yam Tuan Muda (crown prince) was the man who actually controlled Johor. \\"History\\", Embassy of Malaysia, Seoul Johor administration The Johor Sultanate continued the system of administration previously practised in Malacca. The highest authority lay in the hands of the Yang di-Pertuan who was known as the Sultan. The Sultan was assisted by a body known as the Majlis Orang Kaya (Council of Rich Men) which was tasked with advising the Sultan. Among them were the Bendahara, Temenggong, Laksamana, Shahbandar and Seri Bija Diraja. During the 18th century, the Bendahara lived in Pahang and the Temenggong Johor in Teluk Belanga, Singapore. Each one managed the administration of their individual areas based on the level of authority bestowed upon them by the Sultan of Johor. The Johor Empire was decentralised. It was made of four main fiefs and the Sultan's territory. The fiefs are Muar and its territories under the Raja Temenggong of Muar; Pahang under the stewardship of the Bendehara; Riau under the control of YAM Tuan Muda and mainland Johor and Singapore under the Temenggong. The rest of the Empire were directly controlled by the Sultan. The Sultan resided in Lingga. All the Orang Kayas except Raja Temenggong Muar reported directly to the Sultan ; Raja Temenggong Muar was a suzerain recognised by the Sultan. Extent of the Empire As the Sultanate replaced the Malacca Sultanate, it followed that the extent of its territorial area covered the southern Malay peninsular, parts of south-eastern Sumatra and the Riau Islands and its dependencies. This territory included the vassal states of Pahang, Muar, Johor mainland and Riau Islands. The administrative centre of the empire was at various times at Sayong Pinang, Kota Kara, Seluyut, Johor Lama, Batu Sawar and Kota Tinggi; all on mainland Johor and later at Riau and Lingga. It then shifted with the birth of Modern Johore Sultanate to Tanjung Puteri, known today as Johor Bahru. The fall of the Old Johor Sultanate =Singapore and the British= In 1818, Sir Stamford Raffles was appointed as the governor of Bencoolen on western Sumatra. However, he was convinced that the British needed to establish a new base in Southeast Asia to compete with the Dutch. Though many in the British East India Company opposed such an idea, Raffles managed to convince Lord Hastings of the Company, then Governor General of British India, to side with him. With the governor general's consent, he and his expedition set out to search for a new base. When Raffles' expedition arrived in Singapore on 29 January 1819 he discovered a small Malay settlement at the mouth of Singapore River headed by a Temenggong Abdul Rahman. Though the island was nominally ruled by the sultanate, the political situation there was extremely murky. The reigning sultan, Tengku Abdul Rahman, was under the influence of the Dutch and the Bugis. Hence, he would never agree to a British base in Singapore. However, Tengku Abdul Rahman was ruler only because his older brother, Tengku Hussein or Tengku Long, had been away in Pahang getting married when their father died in 1812. He was appointed by the Yam Tuan Muda of Riau, Raja Jaafar because according to him, in a Malay tradition, a person has to be by the dying sultan's side to be considered as the new ruler. However the matter has to be decided by the Bendehara as the \\"keeper of adat (tradition)\\". Predictably, the older brother was not happy with the development. Raja Jaafar's sister, the queen of the late Sultan, protested vehemently at her brother's actions with these prophetic words, \\"... Which adat of succession is being followed? Unfair deeds like this will cause the Johor Sultanate be destroyed!\\". And she held on the royal regalia refusing to surrender it. Bendehara Ali was made aware of the affairs of the succession and decided to act. He prepared his fleet of boats to Riau to \\"restore the adat\\". The British upon knowing this despatched a fleet and set up a blockade to stop the forces of Bendehara Ali from advancing. With Temenggong Abdul Rahman's help, Raffles managed to smuggle Hussein, then living in exile on one of the Riau Islands, back into Singapore. According to a correspondence between Tengku Hussain and his brother, he left for Singapore out of his concern of his son's safety. Unfortunately he was captured by Raffles and forced to make a deal. Their agreement stated that the British would acknowledge Tengku Hussein as the \\"legitimate ruler\\" of \\"Johor\\", and thus Tengku Hussein and the Temenggong would receive a yearly stipend from the British. In return, Tengku Hussein would allow Raffles to establish a trading post in Singapore. This treaty was ratified on 6 February 1819. Bendehara Ali was requested by the British to recognise Tengku Hussein as a ruler. However, Bendehara Ali claimed that he had no connection with the events in Singapore, as it is the Temenggong's fief and stated that his loyalty lies only with the Sultan of Johor in Lingga. =Anglo-Dutch Treaty= The Dutch were extremely displeased with Raffles' action. Tensions between the Dutch and British over Singapore persisted until 1824, when they signed the Anglo-Dutch Treaty. Under the terms of that treaty, the Dutch officially withdrew their opposition to the British presence in Singapore. Many historians contend that the treaty divided the spheres of influence between the Dutch and the English; Sultanate of Johor into modern Johor and the state of Riau-Lingga which exists de jure after the ouster of the last Sultan of Johor. However this treaty was signed secretly without the knowledge of the local nobility including the Sultan and thus its legitimacy was called into question. Nevertheless, the British successfully sidelined Dutch political influence by proclaiming Sultan Hussein as the Sultan of Johor and Singapore to acquire legal recognition in their sphere of influence in Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia. The legitimacy of Sultan Hussein's proclamation as the Sultan of Johor and Singapore was controversial to some of the other Malay rulers. As he was placed on the throne by the British, he was also very much seen as a puppet ruler. Temenggong Abdul Rahman's position, on the other hand, was strengthened as it was with his co-operation that the British successfully took de facto control of Johor and Singapore; with the backing of the British he gained influence as Raja Ja'afar.Ministry of Culture (Publicity Division), Singapore; Ministry of Communications and Information, Singapore., Singapore: A Ministry of Culture Publication, pg 24 Meanwhile, Sultan Abdul Rahman was installed as the Sultan of Lingga in November 1822, complete with the royal regalia. Sultan Abdul Rahman, who had devoted himself to religion, became contented with his political sphere of influence in Lingga, where his family continued to maintain his household under the administrative direction of Raja Ja'afar who ruled under the auspices of the Dutch. =The Interested Parties= The actors on this stage were three parties; the Colonial powers of British and the Dutch; the nobles who made agreement with the Dutch namely Raja Jaafar, Yam Tuan Muda of Riau and Temenggong Abdul Rahman, of Johore and Singapore ; the palace namely the Sultan, and the Bendahara who claimed he was not aware of any treaty signed with their knowledge. Because the treaties are not ratified by the Sultan or the Bendahara, the Malays tried not to pay heed to any action of the Colonial powers. The Yam Tuan Muda has been accused of committing treachery by \\"selling\\" the sovereignty of Johore, however the counter argument is that neither the Sultan nor the Bendahara were parties to the treaty. The treaty was signed in secret and details were only known in 1855. The Temenggong, strengthened his position through his friendship with Great Britain, and gained influence, together with Britain, over the state at the expense of the Sultanate. This is especially true for the son of Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim, the ambitious Temenggong Abu Bakar succeeded in eventually usurping the throne. Sultan tries to repair the damage Sultan Abdul Rahman died in 1832 and was replaced by his son, Sultan Muhammad Shah (reigning from 1832‚Äì1841). Raja Jaffar, Yam Tuan Muda of Riau died and the Sultan is in no hurry to appoint a successor. The Sultan saw the damage that was done to the Palace in his father's reign and decided to reemphasis and restore adat as a rule governing personal behaviour and the politics. He summoned Bendahara Ali (Raja Bendahara Pahang) to Lingga. At Lingga, an adat-steeped function was held. The Bendahara conducted ceremonies (as per adat) aimed at re-educating the nobility and the Sultan about their respective duties and responsibilities. Islam and politics were discussed. It was attended by all the nobles from across the Empire hence, proving that 'Sultan' of Singapore is not recognised by the Malays. The ceremonies also include installation of Tengku Mahmud (later ruling as Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar) as a Crown Prince and Tun Mutahir as Bendehara-in-waiting. In 1841, Bendahara Ali appointed Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim to replace his father who died in 1825. The long interval was due to displeasure of the Bendahara over the affairs of Singapore. Conditions imposed during the appointment included paying a visit of fealty to the ruling Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar in Lingga. Sultan Hussein of Singapore died in 1835 and his prince Tengku Ali wished for the legitimacy granted to Temenggong Ibrahim, by the British and some Malay nobles. The British forwarded the request in 1841 to the Bendahara. Bendahara Ali. After waiting since 1835 for the 'appointment' as a Sultan, in 1852 Tengku Ali decided to return Johor' to the former Johor-Riau Empire by paying homage to Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar in Lingga. For three years Johor Empire was one again, except Singapore which was ceded to the British. Worried by the state of affairs, the British called Tengku Ali back to Singapore on the threat of cancelling his pension. In Singapore, he was frequently visited by Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar and their relations are cordial. =End of the Empire= The worried British then forced the 1855 treaty between Temenggong Ibrahim and Tengku Ali. In exchange for recognition as a Sultan, Tengku Ali agrees to 'give up all of Johor'. The treaty was intended to solidify the position of Temenggong Ibrahim, their key ally. Bendahara Ali was asked by the Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar about the 1855 treaty.Baginda Omar's private correspondences, National Archives, Kuala Lumpur In his reply, the Bendahara reiterated that the Temenggong was supposed to swear fealty to his majesty and on the behaviour of Tengku Ali, the Bendehara claimed ignorance. He also reiterated that he was not a party to any discussion with the British or the Dutch. The Dutch were also very worried. It seemed that the Sultan is acting on his own and would not listen to any of the Dutch-influenced Yam Tuan Muda of Riau and the Bugis nobility. It erupted into an open dispute between Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar and the Bugis nobility over the appointment of new Yam Tuan Muda of Riau. The Bugis preferred candidate was also the Dutch choice. The Sultan resented having another foreign-backed Yam Tuan Muda of Riau. It resulted in a deadlock and the Sultan set sail to Singapore to cool off. It was during the Singapore trip that the last Sultan of the mighty Johore Empire was deposed by the Bugis nobility in 1857. The Breakup After the ouster of the former Sultan of Johor-Riau, the Bugis nobles elected the new Sultan, Sultan Sulaiman Badrul Shah, the Sultan of the \\"new\\" Riau-Lingga Kingdom built on the Riau remnants of the Johore Empire. The Sultan signed an agreement with the Dutch. In the agreement he agreed to acknowledge the overlordship of the Dutch government among others. With a stroke of a pen, he broke up the Johor Empire into 2 big parts and has given up the sovereignty of his part of territory to the Dutch. This also marked the end of the original Johor-Riau Sultanate, that was descended from the Sultanate of Melaka. This division remains until today as the Malaysia-Indonesia border. Johor and Pahang Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim of Johore signed a treaty with Bendahara Tun Mutahir of Pahang in 1861.Ahmad Fawzi Basri, Johor 1855‚Äì1917 : Pentadbiran dan Perkembangannya, Fajar Bakti, 1988, pages 33‚Äì34 The treaty recognised the territories of Johor (mainland), the Temenggong and his descendants' right to rule it, mutual protection and mutual recognitions of Pahang and Johor. With the signing of this treaty, the remnants of the Empire became two independent states, Johor and Pahang. Modern Johore Sultanate The Istana Besar (Grand Palace), completed in 1866 under Abu Bakar of Johor's rule, serves as the seat and residence of the Johor Sultanate. In 1855, Temenggong Ibrahim selected Tanjung Puteri, a small fishing village in southern Johor which would later develop into Johor Bahru, as the administrative headquarters of the state. Temenggong Ibrahim was succeeded by his son, Temenggong Abu Bakar, who later took the title Seri Maharaja Johor. Muar was another vassal of Old Johor Empire and was ruled by its own Raja Temenggong. At gunpoint, the Raja Temenggong and the chieftains of Muar handed over the control of Muar to Temenggong Abu Bakar in 1877; this later contributed to the Jementah Civil War. Temenggong Abu Bakar, aided by the British won decisively. Abu Bakar went to Istanbul to seek recognition as the Sultan of Johor, to allay fears of his religious credibility. In 1885, he went to London seeking the recognition from the British Queen, Queen Victoria on his sultanate and Johor's independence. He was warmly accepted by the Queen and a friendship treaty was signed. After that he was formally crowned the Sultan of Johor. The modern Sultanate of Johor ruled only over mainland Johor. The Old Johore Sultanate (Johore Empire) was thus broken up into its constituents- Pahang, Singapore, Lingga/Riau and mainland Johor. Sultan Abu Bakar has often been credited as the \\"Father of Modern Johor\\" due to the modernisation of the state under his rule. He introduced a constitution known as Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor and developed an efficient administration system, officially moving administrative operation of the state to Johor Bahru. As the capital of the state, Johor Bahru witnessed significant growth and development, culminating to the construction of buildings on grand scales with architecture deriving from Western and Malay sources. Johor as a whole also enjoyed economic prosperity. An increased demand for black pepper and gambier in the nineteenth century lead to the opening up of farmlands to the influx of Chinese immigrants, creating Johor's initial economic base. The Kangchu system was put in place. In 1914, Sultan Ibrahim, Sultan Abu Bakar's successor, was forced to accept a British Adviser and effectively became a crown protectorate of the Britain as part of the Unfederated Malay States. D.G. Campbell was dispatched as the first British advisor to Johor. World War II and Malaysia Under the reign of Sultan Ibrahim until his death in London in 1959, Johor transitioned from a British protectorate of the Unfederated Malay States, to a Japanese possession during Japanese occupation in World War II, to a federated state in the Malayan Union and Federation of Malaya. The Johor Sultanate continues to exist as a member of the Conference of Rulers following Malaya's independence in 1957 and the formation of the Malaysian federation in 1963, with successive sultans presiding over modern Johor as ceremonious figureheads, including Sultan Ismail (1959‚Äì1981), Sultan Iskandar (1981‚Äì2010), and Sultan Ibrahim (2010‚Äìpresent). Sultan Iskandar served as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the federal head of state of Malaysia, from 1984 to 1989.

The incident was a result of failed negotiations between the Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company and its bus workers. The workers wanted better working conditions while the employers wanted to protect their business interests. The strikes eventually escalated and resulted in a clash among the Singapore Bus Workers Union, Hock Lee Employee's Union, the Singapore Chinese Middle Schools Student Union and law enforcement on May 12, 1955. The event has been commonly understood as a violent confrontation between colonialists and communists. The event was however also born out of the conditions of colonial society as well as being part of a necessary modernisation trajectory that Singapore was embarking on. Background Post War Conditions and the rise of trade unions The global trend of decolonisation, led the way for the liberalisation of Singaporean politics. The 1948 constitution that reformed the political and judicial systems in Singapore paved the way for Singapore's first elections in 1948.Kevin Tan, \\"The Evolution of Singapore's Modern Constitution: Developments from 1945 to the Present Day,\\" Singapore Academy of Law Journal 1, 1989, 7-8. This partial liberalisation was impeded as the British saw their strategic interests in Southeast Asia being challenged by peasant uprisings especially in Malaya.Christopher Bayly and Tim Harper, Forgotten Wars: The End of Britain's Asian Empire (New York; London: Allen Lane, 2007), 420-435. Role of the British To maintain their control, the British tried to construct a narrative of communist insurgencies and militarism which could be potentially threatening to the security of the region. On the premise of containing communist activities, emergency regulations were implemented in 1948. These emergency regulations increased restriction on civil society meetings in Singapore.E. Kay Gillis, Singapore Civil Society and British Power (Singapore: Talisman Publishing, 2005), 136. A turning point came as the Rendel Constitution was accepted by the British government and resulted in elections that brought David Marshall and the Labour Front party into power. This new constitution led to the provisional easing of restrictions under Emergency regulations, which in its turn sparked off much interest in politics among the people living in Singapore.C.M. Turnbull, A History of Modern Singapore: 1819-2005 (Singapore: NUS Press, 2009), 259; T.N. Harper, \\"Lim Chin Siong and the Singapore Story,\\" in Lim Chin Siong in History: Comet in Our Sky, ed. Poh Soo Kai (Petaling Jaya, Malaysia: 2015), 27. This renewed liberalisation led to the establishment of many trade unions during this period which would have alarmed many employers that were worried about their business interests.P.J.

Frost and Balasingamchow Yu-Mei. Singapore: A Biography (Singapore: Editions Didier Millet, 2009), 356. Perceived unjust colonial policies led to various episodes of labour unrests in 1954 and 1955. In 1954 there was The May 13 National Service Ordinance. And in 1955, there were three notable strikes namely the Hock Lee Bus workers' strike, the Singapore Traction Company strike and the Singapore Harbour Board strike. Role of Americans in Singapore's Labour Movement American officials were alarmed by both the rise of social unrest in Singapore and the Singapore's Labour Front (SLF) inability to control labour radicalism. It was estimated that 31,000 workers were involved in 129 official and sympathy strikes between March and June 1955.Robert Black to Alan Lennox-Boyd, 20 June 1955, CO 1030/366, The National Archives, London, UK in Mixed up in Power Politics and the Cold War: The Americans, the ICFTU and Singapore'sLabour Movement, 1955-1960 Author(s): S. R. Joey Long Source: Journal of Southeast Asian Studies, Vol. 40, No. 2 (Jun., 2009), pp. 323-351 Some work has been done to study the significance of certain figures that arose from United States government sources.P.J. Thum, \\"The US, Cold War and Counter-Subversion in Singapore,\\" in Makers and Keepers of Singapore History, edited by Loh Kah Seng and Liew Kai Khiun (Singapore: Ethos Books and Singapore Heritage Society, 2015), 170. The seeds of a communist discourse was being sown by American diplomats, pressuring the British government to take subversive actions against student and labour movements in post 1954 Singapore.Thum, \\"The US,\\" 160-161. Thus leading to the construction of events like the Hock Lee incident as a violent event instigated by communists. Ramakrishna's latest work on the communist threat in Singapore necessitates the polarisation of the scholarship on Singapore history and suggests that historians should take sides.Kumar Ramakrishna, \\"Original Sin\\"? Revising the Revisionist Critique of the 1963 Operation Coldstore in Singapore (Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2015), 15-20. Conventional historical narratives have represented the workers and students actions as violent and conceived out of communism. The emerging work on the Hock Lee incident have foregrounded the experiences of the people through the provision of accounts that focus on the social and economic anxieties that were felt by both the students and the workers due to life in colonial society. Student Movement Bilveer Singh stated that the Hock Lee riots revealed \\"the ability of the communists to mobilise other elements of the [Communist United Front], such as the students.\\"Bilveer Singh, Quest for Political Power: Communist Subversion and Militancy in Singapore (Singapore: Marshall Cavendish Editions, 2015), 94. Singh's reconstruction of the Hock Lee riots rely on the works of Bloodworth,Dennis Bloodworth, The Tiger and the Trojan Horse (Singapore: Marshall Cavendish International, 2005). Drysdale,John Drysdale, Singapore: Struggle for Success (Singapore: Times Books International, 1984). and Lee.Ting Hui Lee, The Open United Front: The Communist Struggle in Singapore, 1954-1966 (Singapore: South Seas Society, 1996). His analysis agrees with the colonial perspective and concludes that the students' involvement in the Hock Lee incident was part of a larger plan of communist subversion.Bilveer Singh, Quest, 98. Bloodworth starts his narrative by accusing the 'communist' students of being at the centre of the violence that occurred in the Hock Lee event.Bloodworth, The Tiger, 178-179. He attributes the cause of the unrest to union leader, Fong Swee Suan and takes on a perspective which favours the actions of the bus company.Bloodworth, The Tiger, 179. The above conventional accounts commonly attribute the student involvement to be one of communist action and again do not give the students any form of political consciousness. The students who were involved in the riots were part of the Singapore Chinese Middle School Student Union (SCMSSU). The relationship between the workers and the students is one that is often overlooked in many accounts of history and thus leading to the common conclusion that students' involvement was part of a violent extremist movement.Turnbull, A History, 263. The British adopted a substitution strategy to replace Chinese schools with English institution.Ting-Hong Wong, Hegemonies Compared: State Formation and Chinese School Politics in Postwar Singapore and Hong Kong (New York: RoutledgeFalmer, 2002), 129-130. A ten-year education plan unveiled by the colonial administration in 1949 sought to significantly decrease student enrolment in Chinese vernacular schools.Wong, Hegemonies, 131-132. Chinese students were faced with the implementation of high school exams that served little purpose in ensuring the students' path into university.Thum, \\"The Limitations,\\" 93. The National Service Ordinance act also disrupted the education of Chinese students as the colonial government was unwilling to allow them to defer if they had to sit for examinations.Hong Lysa, \\"Politics of the Chinese-speaking Communities in Singapore in the 1950s,\\" in The May 13 Generation: The Chinese Middle Schools Student Movement and Singapore Politics in the 1950s (Petaling Jaya, Malaysia: SIRD, 2011), 66. This eventually led to the May 13 incident in 1954.Hong, \\"Politics,\\" 57-67. In January 1955, the students' application to register the SCMSSU was rejected and subsequently met with many obstacles which the students felt were unreasonable demands by the colonial government to prevent the set up of the student union.Hong, \\"Politics,\\" 91-92. Newspaper reports of the government not providing help or compensation to victims of World War Two in Singapore also served as a reminder to students that they were being asked to fight for a government that does not have their interests at heart.Thum, \\"The Limitations,\\" 96. Students were seen to be the allies of the workers serving as a political force that could influence the decisions of the ruling elite.Carl A. Trocki, Singapore: Wealth, Power and the Culture of Control (London: Routledge, 2006), 136. Loh et al. highlighted that many of the workers were ex-students and that the Chinese school students knew that the workers who were intertwined in labour negotiations was a reflection of their future.Loh Kah Seng et al., The University Socialist Club and the Contest for Malaya: Tangled Strands of Modernity (Singapore: NUS Press, 2012), 88-89.

Turnbull saw the cause of the riots to be a battle between moderate and left- wing politics within the People's Action Party (PAP) and attributed the workers' involvement to be one of \\"joint direct militant campaign of obstruction and violence.\\" The book Men in White also frames the Hock Lee event as a \\"demonstration of the ruthlessness of the communists and their capacity to unleash violence in Singapore.\\"Sonny Yap et al., Men in White: The Untold Story of Singapore's Ruling Political Party (Singapore: Singapore Press Holdings, 2009), 78. In both these accounts, the bus workers were not given any political consciousness as the event is seen as a spontaneous one that was initiated by the communists that eventually went out of control. Workers in the 1950s were subject to the many effects of colonial society. As previously mentioned, the Rendel Constitution paved the way for the liberalisation of Singapore politics coupled with the workers increasing anxiety about wages and working conditions as seen from an increase from 11 trade unions in 1946, to 236 unions in 1955.Michael Fernandez and Loh Kah Seng, \\"The Left Wing Trade Unions in Singapore, 1945-1970,\\" in Paths Not Taken: Political Pluralism in Post-War Singapore, edited by Michael D. Barr and Carl A. Trocki (Singapore: NUS Press, 2008), 208-209. The post-war colonial administration was seen to be corrupt and inefficient and blamed for the poor working and economic conditions that the workers were subjected to.Carl Trocki, \\"Development of Labour Organisation in Singapore: 1800-1960,\\" Australian Journal of Politics and History 47, no. 1 (2001): 124‚Äì125. Strikes became more frequent as progression in the trade union movement was being challenged by the employers' refusal to recognise the unions and in its turn form splinter unions that would threaten the existing unionised workers.Fernandez and Loh, \\"The Left Wing,\\" 212. The Paya Lebar Bus Company labour protest was one of 275 strikes that took place in 1955.Fernandez and Loh, \\"The Left Wing,\\" 212-213. These activisms set the backdrop for the Hock Lee Bus workers' strike. There is evidence that the Hock Lee Bus workers' strikes were not fully under the direction of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) and that the workers were so passionate about their fight against colonial oppression and exploitation that even the MCP were not able to effectively restraint the workers.C.C. Chin, \\"The United Front Strategy of the MCP, 1950s to 1960s,\\" in Paths Not Taken: Political Pluralism in Post-War Singapore edited by Michael D. Barr and Carl A. Trocki (Singapore: NUS Press, 2008), 63-64. Therefore, the Hock Lee Bus Incident was not a moment of spontaneous communist action but was the effect of the intersections between opposing workers' and employers' sentiments towards the progressive establishment of trade unions which was one of the positive aspects of the Rendel Constitution.E. Kay Gillis, \\"Civil Society and the Malay Education Council,\\" in Paths Not Taken: Political Pluralism in Post- War Singapore, eds. Michael D. Barr and Carl A. Trocki (Singapore: NUS Press, 2008), 156; Loh et al., The University, 30. Gillis and Loh et al., both believe that the Rendel Constitution provided a platform for political activism that was disallowed prior to 1954. These activisms also arose as Singapore was going through a tough economic climate with goods prices increasing by almost 19 per cent; but wages only increased by 0.8 per cent between the period of 1950 and 1955.Sugimoto Ichiro, Economic Growth of Singapore in the Twentieth Century: Historical GDP Estimates and Empirical Investigations (Singapore: World Scientific Publishing Co. Ltd., 2011), 61-64. Workers like Lee Tee Tong, who were subject to poor working conditions and the harsh realities of the colonial political economy led them to be increasingly unhappy with the government.Loh, \\"Interview,\\" 373. This led to unrest among the workers as many were struggling to make ends meet. These strikes proved to be effective as the wages of workers increased by about 10 per cent on an hourly basis over the course of 1955-1956.Fernandez and Loh, \\"The Left,\\" 215. Strikes started The Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company was one of the eleven Chinese bus companies in Singapore that was in operation. In February, 1955, the workers started their own union and joined with the Singapore Bus Workers' Union (SBWU), the company instantly fired the organisers of the union in an attempt to dissolve the union.Thum, \\"The Limitations,\\" 100. On February 24, the company went a step further to set up a rival yellow union and hired 200 new workers in the process.Hong, \\"Politics,\\" 81. Feeling threatened, on April 22, 1955, the bus workers' union put up a notice to strike. The company proceeded to unemploy more than 200 workers who were related to the SBWU on April 24, 1955.Thum, \\"The Limitations,\\" 100; Richard Clutterbuck, Riot and Revolution in Singapore and Malaya, 1945-1963 (London: Faber and Faber, 1973), 108. This angered the workers further which prompted them to set up human blockades at the bus depot, stopping the buses from leaving.Thum, \\"The Limitations,\\" 100; Singh, Quest, 95. This injustice was not only felt by the workers but also by Chief Minister David Marshall who tried to plead their case with the company's management, but his efforts were futile. As the anniversary of the May 13 National Service Incident was approaching, the workers, many of whom were ex-Chinese school students would have also been reminded of what happened the year before. On May 12, 1955, multilateral talks to mediate the workers' disputes were hampered as police clashed with strikers which resulted in the death of four people and thirty-one people injured.Clutterbuck, Riot, 110. Riots On 12 May 1955, later known as, a major riot involving an estimated 2,000 people broke out in the streets of Alexandra Road and Tiong Bahru.Clutterbuck, Riot, 109; Singh, Quest, 96. The police tried to break up the 2,000 students and strikers using tear gas.Clutterbuck, Riot, 109. Four people died as a result, including Andrew Teo, a Constable with the Volunteer Special Constabulary, who was severely beaten by a mob, Yuen Yau Phang, another Chinese police officer who was allegedly burned to death in his car, Gene D. Symonds, an American press correspondent also beaten by the mob and Chong Lon Chong (zhƒÅng l√∫n qu√°n Âº†‰º¶Èì®), a sixteen-year-old student whose death caught the most attention. In an initial Straits Times report, the student was shot one mile away from a hospital, but was paraded around for two and half-hours by the students to further arouse the crowd's emotion without sending him for medical treatment.Clutterbuck, Riot, 109-110; Singh, Quest, 97. The press, including the vernacular press and the English medium Straits Times, however later reported that it was revealed that the coroner stated in the lawyer's brief to Chong's mother that it was inconclusive as to whether the boy was dead or alive when he was shot.Hong, \\"Politics,\\" 84. Furthermore, it was also established after the trial that the four men who were arrested were not students. Significance While the Hock Lee incident has conventionally been portrayed be one of communist subversion, other sources suggest that the students and workers' involvements in the Hock Lee incident were also due to anxieties felt by these two groups as a result of the conditions of colonial society. The Hock Lee bus workers' strikes can also be seen as one of the catalysts for the modernisation of the bus transportation industry in Singapore. The Hock Lee workers' strikes as well as other similar transportation workers' strikes resulted in the nationalisation of the Singapore transportation industry, specifically the Chinese owned bus companies. Shortly after the Hock Lee workers' strikes, the Singapore Traction Company strikes occurred which motivated the Hawkins Report of 1956. The Hawkins Report called for the reformation of the transportation industry in Singapore through a consolidation of the Chinese bus companies.Peter J. Rimmer, Rikisha to Rapid Transit: Urban Public Transport Systems and Policy in Southeast Asia (Australia: Pergamon Press, 1986), 119. The Hawkins report advocated for a single entity to control transportation.Rimmer, Rikisha, 119. The report was an evident reaction to the operational challenges, poor administration and labour discontent that was evident in many of the bus companies. In 1970, RP WilsonR.P. Wilson, A Study of the Public Bus Transport System of Singapore. Singapore: Government Printer, 1970. was appointed to look into the reorganisation of public transportation in Singapore which resulted in the establishment of the government-led Singapore Transport Advisory Board in 1970, which sought to not only nationalise the bus companies but also to create a more efficient transportation system.Rimmer, Rikisha, 121. To many of the workers, these strikes helped them to gain a 'Singaporean' consciousness outside of colonialism.Fernandez and Loh, \\"The Left,\\" 222. The strikes and the workers' sentiments however were quickly put out. Part of Singapore's modernisation project was to expand its tourism sector and an efficient transportation system was important for this growth.Carl Trocki, Singapore, 171. This did not leave room for any form of activism that would disrupt Singapore's necessary path towards modernity and economic development. Media Representations Media interest in the event sparked off some public debate. The Singapore Broadcasting Corporation's television series Diary of A Nation, produced in 1988, covers the Hock Lee event in episode ten. The Hock Lee incident was also depicted in Channel News Asia's documentary feature on violence and communism in Singapore in the 1950s, Days of Rage.Thomas St John Gray and Janice Young, \\"Hock Lee Bus Riots,\\" Days of Rage, episode 2, aired February, 2014 (Singapore: Channel News Asia, 2014), Television broadcast. A reaction to the film was published in the form of a three-part critique named, \\"Hock Lee bus riots ‚Äì fact or fiction by CNA?\\" by The Online Citizen.Part 1, Part 2, Part 3 The riots were dramatised in the drama The Journey: Tumultuous Times. The student Chen Anguo in the drama represented Chong Lon Chong due to his controversial death.

It has also been suggested that the technology could be used to reduce the amount of space debris in orbit around Earth.  Propulsion system  MagBeam propulsion uses a helicon plasma source to produce a plasma beam. A helicon drive consists of a quartz tube wrapped in a radio antenna, into which a gas such as argon or xenon is injected. RF currents pass through the antenna creating a rapid variation of the electric field, ionizing the gas. The ionized gas is accelerated by a magnetic field to produce thrust. The helicon drive produces a tight beam of ions as the magnetic field that accelerates them continuously expands with the plasma beam keeping them focused. This ion beam is used to push a payload which is equipped with a small amount of gas for propellant such as argon or xenon, a power source and a set of electromagnets to produce a mini- magnetosphere magnetic sail. The gas propellant is ejected into the plasma beam being directed at the craft which heats and ionizes it. The electromagnets repel this ionized gas imparting thrust upon the payload. This results in an acceleration of around 1 ms‚àí2, much faster than traditional ion propulsion systems. This amount of acceleration would make it possible to make a trip to Mars in as little as 50 days, reaching speeds as high as 20 km/s. The deceleration is accomplished by having another platform at the other end of the journey directing a plasma beam at the payload. By eliminating the mass of the propulsion system from the payload the MagBeam system allows for much faster acceleration and higher top speeds than conventional propulsion systems mounted on the payload. One problem with the system is the need for a sufficiently dense power-source, with a massive battery bank being proposed for an Earth-Mars Mag-Beam facility massing some 3,000 tons. The system proposed by Winglee would allow a round-trip from Earth to Mars in 90 days, with 11 days stop-over at Mars.University of Washington, New propulsion concept could make 90-day Mars round trip possible , Oct. 14, 2004 A similar system for use of a particle beam to push a mini-magnetosphere magnetic sail was proposed by Geoffrey A. Landis in 2001 as a possible propulsion system for interstellar travel.G. A.

There are two parts of the Slutsky equation, namely the substitution effect, and income effect. In general, the substitution effect is negative. He designed this formula to explore a consumer's response as the price changes. When the price increases, the budget set moves inward, which causes the quantity demanded to decrease. In contrast, when the price decreases, the budget set moves outward, which leads to an increase in the quantity demanded. The equation demonstrates that the change in the demand for a good, caused by a price change, is the result of two effects: * a substitution effect: the good becomes relatively cheaper, so the consumer purchases other goods as substitutes * an income effect: the purchasing power of a consumer increases as a result of a price decrease, so the consumer can now afford better products or more of the same products, depending on whether the product itself is a normal good or an inferior good. The Slutsky equation decomposes the change in demand for good i in response to a change in the price of good j: :{\\\\partial x_i(\\\\mathbf{p}, w) \\\\over \\\\partial p_j} = {\\\\partial h_i(\\\\mathbf{p}, u) \\\\over \\\\partial p_j} - {\\\\partial x_i(\\\\mathbf{p}, w) \\\\over \\\\partial w } x_j(\\\\mathbf{p}, w),\\\\, where h(\\\\mathbf{p}, u) is the Hicksian demand and x(\\\\mathbf{p}, w) is the Marshallian demand, at the vector of price levels \\\\mathbf{p}, wealth level (or, alternatively, income level) w, and fixed utility level u given by maximizing utility at the original price and income, formally given by the indirect utility function v(\\\\mathbf{p}, w). The right-hand side of the equation is equal to the change in demand for good i holding utility fixed at u minus the quantity of good j demanded, multiplied by the change in demand for good i when wealth changes. The first term on the right-hand side represents the substitution effect, and the second term represents the income effect. Note that since utility is not observable, the substitution effect is not directly observable, but it can be calculated by reference to the other two terms in the Slutsky equation, which are observable. This process is sometimes known as the Hicks decomposition of a demand change. The equation can be rewritten in terms of elasticity: :\\\\epsilon_{p, ij}=\\\\epsilon_{p,ij}^h-\\\\epsilon_{w,i}b_j where Œµp is the (uncompensated) price elasticity, Œµph is the compensated price elasticity, Œµw,i the income elasticity of good i, and bj the budget share of good j. The same equation can be rewritten in matrix form to allow multiple price changes at once: :\\\\mathbf{D_p x}(\\\\mathbf{p}, w) = \\\\mathbf{D_p h}(\\\\mathbf{p}, u)- \\\\mathbf{D_w x}(\\\\mathbf{p}, w) \\\\mathbf{x}(\\\\mathbf{p}, w)^\\\\top,\\\\, where Dp is the derivative operator with respect to price and Dw is the derivative operator with respect to wealth. The matrix \\\\mathbf{D_p h}(\\\\mathbf{p}, u) is known as the Slutsky matrix, and given sufficient smoothness conditions on the utility function, it is symmetric, negative semidefinite, and the Hessian of the expenditure function. Derivation While there are several ways to derive the Slutsky equation, the following method is likely the simplest. Begin by noting the identity h_i(\\\\mathbf{p},u) = x_i (\\\\mathbf{p}, e(\\\\mathbf{p},u)) where e(\\\\mathbf{p},u) is the expenditure function, and u is the utility obtained by maximizing utility given p and w. Totally differentiating with respect to pj yields the following: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial h_i(\\\\mathbf{p},u)}{\\\\partial p_j} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial x_i(\\\\mathbf{p},e(\\\\mathbf{p},u))}{\\\\partial p_j} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial x_i (\\\\mathbf{p},e(\\\\mathbf{p},u))}{\\\\partial e(\\\\mathbf{p},u)} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\partial e(\\\\mathbf{p},u)}{\\\\partial p_j}. Making use of the fact that \\\\frac{\\\\partial e(\\\\mathbf{p},u)}{\\\\partial p_j} = h_j(\\\\mathbf{p},u) by Shephard's lemma and that at optimum, : h_j(\\\\mathbf{p},u) = h_j(\\\\mathbf{p}, v(\\\\mathbf{p},w)) = x_j(\\\\mathbf{p},w), where v(\\\\mathbf{p},w) is the indirect utility function, one can substitute and rewrite the derivation above as the Slutsky equation. Giffen goods A Giffen good is a product that is in greater demand when the price increases, which are also special cases of inferior goods. In the extreme case of income inferiority, the size of income effect overpowered the size of the substitution effect, leading to a positive overall change in demand responding to an increase in the price. Slutsky's decomposition of the change in demand into a pure substitution effect and income effect explains why the law of demand doesn't hold for Giffen goods.

Born in Coulee Dam, Washington, Colburn grew up in Mount Vernon, with his father (a veteran contractor from World War II), mother, and three sisters, where he would serve as an altar boy for four years while attending Immaculate Conception Catholic School. After dropping out of high school, he joined the army in 1966 and was assigned to train at Fort Lewis followed by a stint at Fort Polk. He was then sent to Fort Shafter in Hawaii, where he earned his GED before being sent to Vietnam in December 1967.The Forgotten Hero of My Lai: The Hugh Thompson Story, page 35, Angers, 1999 In South Vietnam he was assigned to the 161st Assault Helicopter Company (later reorganized as the 123rd Aviation Battalion) with the rank of Specialist Four. Serving as a door-gunner on an OH-23 Raven observation helicopter, his crew chief was Specialist Four Glenn Andreotta and his pilot was Warrant Officer One Hugh Thompson, Jr.. Thirty years after the fact all three men were decorated with the Soldier's Medal for their heroic actions at My Lai.  The Massacre  In the early morning hours of March 16, 1968, during Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, Americal Division's assault on a hamlet known on U.S. military maps as My Lai 4, Colburn's OH-23 helicopter surprisingly encountered no enemy fire while hovering over this suspected headquarters of the Viet Cong 48th battalion. Spotting two possible Viet Cong suspects, Thompson forced the Vietnamese men to surrender and flew them off to the rear for tactical interrogation. He also marked the location of several wounded Vietnamese with a green smoke marker, a signal that they needed help. Returning to the My Lai area at around 09:00 after refueling, the crew noticed that the people they had marked were now dead. Out in a paddy field beside a dike 200 meters south of the hamlet, they marked the location of a wounded young Vietnamese woman. Thompson and his crew watched from a low hover as Captain Ernest Medina (Charlie Company's Commander) came up to the woman, prodded her with his foot, stepped back, and then shot and killed her. (At his court martial, Medina claimed that he had turned away from her and then, startled by the sound of sudden movement behind him, spun back around and shot her, thinking she had been hiding a weapon under herself.) Thompson then flew over an irrigation ditch filled with dozens of bodies. Shocked at the sight, he radioed his accompanying gunships, knowing his transmission would be monitored by many on the net: \\"It looks to me like there's an awful lot of unnecessary killing going on down there. Something ain't right about this. There's bodies everywhere. There's a ditch full of bodies that we saw. There's something wrong here.\\"The Forgotten Hero of My Lai: The Hugh Thompson Story, page 117, Angers, 1999 Movement from the ditch indicated to Thompson that there were still people alive in there. Thompson landed his helicopter and dismounted. David Mitchell, a sergeant and squad leader in 1st Platoon, Charlie Company, walked over to him. When asked by Thompson whether any help could be provided to the people in the ditch, the sergeant replied that the only way to help them was to put them out of their misery. Second Lieutenant William Calley (1st Platoon Leader, Charlie Company) then came up, and the two had the following conversation:The Forgotten Hero of My Lai: The Hugh Thompson Story, pp 119‚Äì120, Angers, 1999 :Thompson: What's going on here, Lieutenant? :Calley: This is my business. :Thompson: What is this? Who are these people? :Calley: Just following orders. :Thompson: Orders? Whose orders? :Calley: Just following... :Thompson: But, these are human beings, unarmed civilians, sir. :Calley: Look Thompson, this is my show. I'm in charge here. It ain't your concern. :Thompson: Yeah, great job. :Calley: You better get back in that chopper and mind your own business. :Thompson: You ain't heard the last of this! Thompson took off again, and Andreotta reported that Mitchell was now executing the people in the ditch. Furious, Thompson flew over the northeast corner of the village and spotted a group of about ten civilians, including children, running toward a homemade bomb shelter. Pursuing them were soldiers from 2nd Platoon, Charlie Company. Realizing that the soldiers intended to murder the Vietnamese, Thompson landed his aircraft between them and the villagers. Thompson turned to Colburn and Andreotta and told them that if the Americans began shooting at the villagers or him, they should fire their M60 machine guns at the Americans: \\"Y'all cover me! If these bastards open up on me or these people, you open up on them. Promise me!\\"The Forgotten Hero of My Lai: The Hugh Thompson Story, page 124, 9 Colburn (whose M60 faced 2nd Platoon) replied, \\"You got it boss, consider it done.\\" He turned his weapon to face the American soldiers and exchanged stares with them, but privately was uncertain if he could actually fire on his fellow countrymen. Thompson then dismounted to confront 2nd Platoon's leader, Lieutenant Stephen Brooks. Thompson told him he wanted help getting the peasants out of the bunker:The Forgotten Hero of My Lai: The Hugh Thompson Story, page 124, 1999 :Thompson: Hey listen, hold your fire. I'm going to try to get these people out of this bunker. Just hold your men here. :Brooks: Yeah, we can help you get 'em out of that bunker ‚Äì with a hand grenade! :Thompson: Just hold your men here. I think I can do better than that. Brooks declined to argue with him, even though as a commissioned officer he outranked Thompson. After coaxing the 11 Vietnamese out of the bunker, Thompson persuaded the pilots of the two UH-1 Huey gunships (Dan Millians and Brian Livingstone) flying as his escort to evacuate them. (Gunships would ordinarily never land in a combat zone.) While Thompson was returning to base to refuel, Andreotta spotted movement in an irrigation ditch filled with approximately 100 bodies. The helicopter again landed and the men dismounted to search for survivors. After wading through the remains of the dead and dying men, women and children, Andreotta extracted a live boy. Thompson flew the survivor to the ARVN hospital in Quang Ngai where he left the child under the care of a nun. Upon finally returning to their base at about 11:00, Thompson heatedly reported the massacre to his superior officer, Colonel Oran Henderson. Thompson's allegations of civilian killings quickly reached Lieutenant Colonel Frank Barker, the operation's overall ground commander. Barker radioed his executive officer to find out from Captain Medina what was happening on the ground. Medina then gave the cease-fire order to Charlie Company to \\"knock off the killing\\".  After the Massacre  American commanders were initially successful in covering up the massacre. All of Thompson's crew received decorations for their actions at My Lai, with Colburn receiving the Bronze Star with Combat \\"V\\" device on May 14, 1968. An account of the action was fabricated for Colburn's document accompanying the decoration, and Thompson's signature was forged on the eyewitness report. On December 20, 1969, Colburn testified to the investigative Peers Commission on what he had seen on March 16, 1968 in My Lai (4).The Peers Commission Report. Volume II, Book 5. Testimony.  Post-War  After the war, Colburn married and became the father of a son, Conner. He managed a ski repair business in Oregon, and owned and managed an Atlanta business that sells orthopedic rehabilitation equipment. Exactly thirty years later, Colburn and Thompson were awarded the Soldier's Medal, the United States Army's highest award for bravery not involving direct contact with the enemy. At the same time, a posthumous medal was also awarded to Andreotta. \\"It was the ability to do the right thing even at the risk of their personal safety that guided these soldiers to do what they did,\\" then- Major General Michael Ackerman said at the 1998 ceremony. The three \\"set the standard for all soldiers to follow.\\" Additionally on March 10, 1998, Senator Max Cleland (D-GA) entered a tribute to Thompson, Colburn and Andreotta into the record of the U.S. Senate. Cleland said the three men were, \\"true examples of American patriotism at its finest.\\" Also in 1998, Thompson and Colburn returned to the village of My Lai, where they met some of the villagers they rescued, including Thi Nhung and Pham Thi Nhanh, two women who had been part of the group that was about to be killed by Brooks' 2nd Platoon.The Forgotten Hero of My Lai: The Hugh Thompson Story, page 77, Angers, 1999 They also dedicated a new elementary school for the children of the village. Both Colburn and Thompson were awarded the Peace Abbey \\"Courage of Conscience Award\\" on July 4, 1999.The Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Recipients List During the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, Colburn expressed a \\"bad feeling\\" about the invasion that he felt may have touched off a much larger war than was intended. He was at Hugh Thompson's bedside when the latter died of cancer on January 6, 2006. In 2003, at a Moral Lecture Series address to midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy, Colburn made the following remarks: > Combat is chaotic. Combat is primal. And something surfaces in you, > especially when you see people close to you fall. And it's very difficult to > control. Your job as young officers is to monitor those men who are pulling > the trigger to make sure that that primal instinct, you have to keep it in > check somehow.Moral Courage in Combat: The My Lai Story. United States Naval > Academy. Retrieved on August 10, 2020. For the Dedication of the Peace Park of the massacre (March 16, 2001), Colburn was reunited with Do Ba, the young child Andreotta had rescued from the ditch. \\"I'm very glad to see the man who rescued me,\\" Ba said, as the two men lit incense at the graves of Ba's mother, sister and brother, who were 31, four and two when they were killed. \\"He's a good man....But I still feel hatred for the soldiers who killed my mother, my brother and my sister.\\" Colburn also appeared in a PBS American Experience special on the incident, which aired April 26, 2010. On July 4, 1999, Colburn and Hugh Thompson co-chaired the Stonewalk Project which organized and led the physical pulling of the one ton granite, memorial stone for Unknown Civilians Killed in War from Sherborn, Massachusetts to Arlington National Cemetery.
