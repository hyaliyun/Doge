She was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 1996 for her accomplishments in the field of chemistry.  Early life and education  She was born Ellen Shirley Eckwall in Detroit, grew up in the Detroit suburb of Pleasant Ridge, and graduated from Lincoln High School in Ferndale. Schwartz earned three academic degrees in chemistry. She attended the University of Michigan where she received her bachelor of science degree in chemistry in 1957. She then enrolled at Wayne State University and earned her master's degree 1962 and her doctorate in 1970.  Career  After teaching at Oakland Community College and the Detroit Institute of Technology, Schwartz began working at BASF Corporation in Wyandotte, Michigan, where she developed an industrial lubricant that, by virtue of being primarily water, reduced the amount of oil and consequently pollution. She then spent over 18 years working at General Motors, where she was senior research scientist, working in Research and Development Operations at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. During her career she came to hold more than 20 patents, and authored 173 technical papers. From 1989 to 2003 she wrote a regular column titled Love Letters to Lubrication Engineers in the journal of the Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers, and was remembered in a 2016 memorial in that journal as \\"the mother of the oil life monitor found in most GM cars, which is responsible for not having to change oil nearly as often as we did previously, or conversely, not ruining your engine if you don't change it often enough.\\" When presenting her with an achievement award in 1999, the Society of Women Engineers summarized Dr. Schwartz's career thusly: \\"Dr. Schwartz has examined engine oil degradation; wear, corrosion, and elastomer durability in engines; the effects of methanol and ethanol fuel on engines; and lubricants for air conditioners that use alternative refrigerants (other than Freon R12). Her work in these areas have been targeted towards: * obtaining the maximum useful life of engine oil * finding acceptable ways to use alternative energy sources * developing refrigerant systems that will not hurt the earth's ozone layer\\"  Awards and honors  Schwartz was named a fellow of the Society of Automotive Engineers in 1999 and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2000 \\"for contributions to lubrication engineering and for enriching the technical community through free-lance writing.\\" She additionally received many industry awards: * General Motors Kettering Award (1988): Awarded for computer-based method that assesses engine oil degradation as a function of oil temperature and displays the remaining life of the oil for the vehicle * General Motors McCuen Award (1993) * Gold Award from the Engineering Society of Detroit (1989) * Wilbur Deutsch Memorial Award from the Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers (1987) * Colwell Award (1992) from the Society of Automotive Engineers * Distinguished Speaker Award (1995) from the Society of Automotive Engineers  Personal life  She married her husband Ron Schwartz in 1957.

She was later a schoolteacher and a professor at two historically black colleges and universities in Kansas and Missouri. The Mowbray Scholars Program at the Michigan State University Honors College is named in her honor.  Early life  Mowbray was born in Adrian, Michigan. Her father was a messenger for the secretary of state in Lansing, the state capital. Prior to her arrival in East Lansing, she graduated from George R. Smith College in Sedalia, Missouri, and for a year was an elementary schoolteacher in Missouri.  Michigan Agricultural College  Myrtle Craig's father persuaded her to attend the Michigan Agricultural College (M.A.C.) over the University of Michigan. Craig worked her way through college by waiting tables and working other side jobs, and did not live in the Women's Building on campus, either because she was not allowed to or could not afford to. She first boarded with the family of Addison M. Brown, who was the secretary to the State Board of Agriculture, and worked for the family as a cook; she later boarded with the family of Assistant Professor of Drawing Chance Newman before taking up residence in Lansing. She was one of four African American students on campus and, of those, the only woman, and was one of 15 women in the class of 1907. While Craig was one of the few African Americans at the university, she reflected on her experience by saying, \\"I didn't feel any different because of my race, there were sororities for girls, but I was so poor, I didn't have the time or money for those things.\\" During her time of study, she was affiliated with the A.M.E. Church in Lansing. She received her diploma on May 31, 1907, from U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, the commencement speaker.  Teaching career  After graduating from the Michigan Agricultural College, Craig spent her next forty years teaching African American youth in Kansas and Missouri. From 1907 to 1910 she taught at Western University in Quindaro, Kansas, then taught domestic art for two years at Lincoln Institute in Jefferson City, Missouri, during which time she exhibited at the 1911 Missouri State Fair, winning a blue ribbon and other prizes for work in domestic arts. She then taught for three years at Sumner High School in Kansas City, Kansas; returned to teaching at Lincoln Institute from 1917 to 1922; taught elementary school in Fulton, Missouri, from 1922 to 1934; and again at Lincoln Institute from 1934 to 1947.  Personal life  Craig married Rev. W.H. Bowen in 1915, and married George H. Mowbray in 1951. At the time of her death on November 8, 1974, she lived in Kansas City, Missouri.

The worship of Kubjika as one of the main aspect of Adishakti was in its peak in 12th century CE. She is still praised in tantric practices that are followed in Kaula tradition.  Etymology  Kubjikā means \\"to crook\\" or \\"to curve\\" in Sanskrit. Once lord Navātman embraced his consort Vakrika and before the copulation, she suddenly felt shy and bent her body earning the name, Kubjikā, \\" the hunchback one\\" or Vakrika (crooked one).  Worship  A tantric text named \\"Kubjikamata\\" or \\"pisumata\\" dated back to 9th or 10th century CE describes the worship of Kubjika. Though she was very famous among the tantric tradition of Kashmir Valley in the past, Kubjika cult was not familiar among the devotees. Though it seemed that Kubjika was no longer worshipped in the valley either, in mid 1980s, she was discovered in a secret tantric worship that still exists among the Newar people. According to Chinjinimatatantra a text that praises Kubjika, Kaula tradition was taught to four disciples who were sent in the four directions. The disciple sent to the west founded the Western Stream (Pascimāmnaya) of Kaulism, the cult of Navatman and Kubjika. The eastern disciple created Purvāmnaya, the cult of Kulēsvari while the northern disciple taught Uttarāmnaya, the cult of Kālasangarshini. the Southern tradition was known as Dakshinamnaya, the cult of Kāmēsvari. Nowadays,the southern Srikula sect of Kamesvari and northern Kalikula sect of Kali are still known as Shaktism sects while the other two (kubjika and Trika) are usually identified as Saivism sects along with other Kashmiri Saivite traditions.

It features six video games originally developed by Capcom and released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, all based on animated series from the television block The Disney Afternoon.. The compilation was released on April 18, 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Gameplay All six games in the collection are primarily side-scrolling platform games. The games retain their original style and gameplay, but the compilation also includes the ability to rewind game time to correct mistakes, and time attack and boss rush modes, in which players able to compete in online leaderboards. Additionally, the compilation includes concept art, music, and additional assets created for the original games. Development The ports to modern systems were developed by Digital Eclipse. According to John Faciane, associate producer for the collection, the idea of compiling the various Capcom games developed in association with The Disney Afternoon show block was already in place when he joined Capcom in July 2016. He said that there was growing fan interest in these games after Digital Eclipse released the Mega Man Legacy Collection in August 2015, and when he had joined, the company was in the final stages of figuring out which games to include in the collection. The ports are based on the studio's Eclipse Engine, also used in the Mega Man Legacy Collection, which is able to take the original ROM images and decompile them so that they can then re-execute the code in a virtual machine developed for modern systems. The studio recognized, like many games of the 8-bit era, that these titles were generally difficult compared to more contemporary games, and incorporated features like save states and the rewind feature to help players. Some of the additional content for the game were from archives that Digital Eclipse's head of restoration Frank Cifaldi had made when he \\"pirated\\" the games as a youth. Reception The Disney Afternoon Collection received mostly positive reviews on upon release, earning average scores of 78 out of 100 for the PC version, 76 out of 100 for the PlayStation 4 version, and 75 out of 100 for the Xbox One version from Metacritic. Many reviewers commented on the appeal of the games being potentially limited to players familiar with games from the 8-bit era. In his review for Gamespot, Jason D'Aprile called the collection \\"a refined time capsule that covers a very specific chapter in gaming history,\\" and that the appeal was the entire package rather than any specific game, elaborating that \\"While these games might not be anything to get overly excited about individually, in a package that includes plenty of history and extras, this collection is a nostalgic curiosity with heart.\\" Samuel Claiborn of IGN called the compilation \\"a collection aimed squarely at fans of old-fashioned platformers that makes little effort to update them for modern conventions,\\" and that the quality of each game varied, calling them \\"three hits and three duds.\\" The website would additionally praise the title's extra features and art gallery. Ray Carsillo of EGM called the title \\"pure nostalgia,\\" but that it could be recommended to newer Disney fans \\"as long as they can appreciate the 8-bit “vintage” look.\\" However, the publication remarked that the game's rewind feature could sometimes cause crashes or slowdown.

Etymology  The toponym Ghazni is known to have existed prior to the Islamic period. Classical authors mention the name in various forms, including the Greek Gázaca (), and the Chinese Ho(k)-si(k)-na.  History of the Ghaznavid city  =Background= Although not a member of the Ghaznavid family, the foundation of the Ghazni as a Ghaznavid city can be attributed to the Turkic slave commander of the Samanid Empire, Alp-Tegin, who after his unsuccessful attempt to put the Samanid prince Nasr on the throne, was forced to flee from the court in Bukhara. In 963, Alp-Tegin accompanied by his personal guard of Turkic slave-soldiers and group of Iranian ghazis left for Ghazni, which was a small town in Zabulistan ruled by the local Lawik dynasty. He seized Ghazni from Abu Bakr Lawik, a kinsman of the Kabulshah, and secured his position by receiving an investiture from the Samanids as the governor of Ghazni. Alp-Tegin died a few months later (September 963) and was succeeded by his son Abu Ishaq Ibrahim, who briefly lost control of Ghazni after an invasion by its former ruler, Abu Bakr Lawik. However, he managed to regain it with Samanid aid. Some time later, Abu Ishaq Ibrahim died and was succeeded by a Turkic slave commander named Bilgetegin. =Under the Ghaznavid rulers= Dirham of Mahmud minted in Ghazni in 1024. Ferdowsi with the other poets from the court of Ghazni. In 1052, the rebellious slave-soldier (ghulam) Toghrul seized Ghazni, had Abd al-Rashid killed, and had the sultan's men jailed in a stronghold. However, Toghrul's reign lasted only 15 days; he was defeated and killed by Ghaznavid loyalists, who put Farrukh-zad (r. 1053–1059) on the throne. The city's good fortune came to an unexpected and ruthless end when it was sacked and set on fire in 1151 by the Ghurid Sultan Ala al-Din Husayn (r. 1149-1161). All the tombs of the Ghaznavid rulers, with the exception of Mahmud, Mas'ud I and Ibrahim, were broken open and the remains burned. From these events, Ala ad-Din Husayn gained the nickname, Jahānsūz (meaning the World Burner).C.E.

It was located at 9 Swallow Street, on the edge of Mayfair and close to Piccadilly Circus. The club's launch on 22 June 1966 was attended by many artists and celebrities, including the Beatles, members of the Rolling Stones, Michael Caine, Julie Christie, David Bailey and Mary Quant. Like the Ad Lib and the Scotch of St. James, the club was a popular meeting place for rock musicians and other artists until trends changed in the London scene. Sibylla's was conceived as an exclusive venue for leading figures in the Swinging London era. Its major shareholders and owners were advertising copywriter Kevin Macdonald, photographer Terry Howard, and property developer Bruce Higham, while baronet and champion horse rider William Pigott-Brown provided much of the finance for the venture. George Harrison of the Beatles was given a shareholding in the club, in return for the publicity his association would bring, and disc jockey Alan Freeman was also a shareholder. The club's interior was designed by David Mlinaric. Since Sibylla's closed, the site has continued to be a nightclub location. Concept and launch Part of the archway marking the southern end of Swallow Street (on Piccadilly). The site at number 9 had been home to nightclubs for over 50 years before Sibylla's. In their plan for the club, Kevin Macdonald, Terry Howard and Bruce Higham conceived of a meeting place for the elite of Swinging London. Higham said the clientele they envisaged \\"[have] a kind of self-confidence, an awareness, which they transpose to their environment\\". As a great-nephew of newspaper proprietor Lord Northcliffe, MacDonald was from an aristocratic family, yet his interest was in establishing an elite that was not governed along lines of social class. Sir William Pigott-Brown, a baronet, provided half the funds for the venture. Guinness heir Tara Browne was another of the financial backers. George Harrison of the Beatles, a friend of Howard, was given a 10 per cent shareholding, on the understanding that his name could be used to attract publicity, and disc jockey Alan Freeman was also a stakeholder. The site at 9 Swallow Street, on the eastern edge of Mayfair, had been a nightclub venue since 1915. The building's new interiors were designed by David Mlinaric, who said at the time that his concept was to give the club \\"a feeling of under-decoration\\" to match contemporary fashions in clothes design. Macdonald, Howard and Higham named the venue after Sibylla Edmonstone, a London socialite and the granddaughter of American entrepreneur Marshall Field. The club was run under the company name of Kevin Macdonald Associated Ltd. Sibylla's was launched with a private party held on 22 June 1966. One of the three owners declared that the club was \\"the first Classic London Discotheque\\". Among the guests were the Beatles, who had just finished recording their Revolver album that day. The full guest list was later published in Queen magazine and included Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones; actors Michael Caine, Julie Christie and Jane Birkin; and fashion figures such as David Bailey, Mary Quant and Michael Rainey. Writing in Queen, television presenter Cathy McGowan said that \\"A more glittering line up of guests could hardly be imagined.\\" Popularity and decline Carnaby Street, circa 1966. The owners of Sibylla's sought to attract only the most elite figures from the burgeoning Swinging London cultural scene. In his book on 1960s London, Shawn Levy states that, in their policy for Sibylla's, Macdonald, Howard and Higham allowed exclusivity based on \\"hipness\\" to replace the old class divisions of \\"breeding, schooling and wealth\\". Levy adds, \\"Of course, it worked\\", as 800 of the people they contacted agreed to become members of the club, at an annual fee of around £8. Along with the Ad Lib and later the Scotch of St. James, the club was a popular meeting place for rock musicians such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Speaking to journalist and author Jonathan Aitken in 1966, Macdonald said that Sibylla's represented the classless society of Swinging London. He said that he and his co-owners had brought together \\"the new aristocracy in Britain … the current young meritocracy of style, taste and sensitivity\\", namely: \\"the top creative people; the top exporters; the top brains; the top artists; the top social people\\". According to MacDonald, in its \\"marrying up\\" of working-class artists and photographers with members of high society, Sibylla's was the realisation of the psychedelic aesthetic, a trend that had emerged in contemporary music that year. The club's manager was Laurie O'Leary, who had previously managed Esmeralda's Barn, a nightclub in Knightsbridge owned by the Kray twins. The musical acts who performed at Sibylla's included Jokers Wild, a band featuring future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, and were booked through an agency owned by the Krays' elder brother, Charlie Kray. Freddie Foreman, a convicted associate of the Kray twins, later wrote that, despite the restrictive door policy at Sibylla's, \\"I always welcome at the club\\" due to O'Leary's presence. In October 1966, Macdonald, who was suffering from depression, died after jumping from a rooftop in west London. Author Steve Turner describes him as an early casualty among London's psychedelic drug users, at a time when the full psychological effects of LSD were not widely known. According to cultural historian David Simonelli, MacDonald's suicide was indicative of the downside of \\"the changes in British society and its sociocultural image\\" in the psychedelic era. Tara Browne, who was a regular at the club in the company of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, died after crashing his sports car into a parked van in December 1966. In 1968, O'Leary left Sibylla's to manage the Speakeasy Club, which had become the new night spot for musicians and record industry executives. Sibylla's closed that same year, as a result of what Levy terms \\"the vagaries of fashion among its In Crowd membership\\". Following its closure, 9 Swallow Street continued to be a nightclub venue. On 24 October 2016, the Aristocrat opened on the site, applying a restrictive door policy that, according to GQ magazine, outdoes all rival local clubs.

Elements of Lettering (1922), typeset by Bertha Goudy In 1903, the Goudys founded the Village Press with Will Ransom in Oak Park, Illinois. After the first year of operation, Ransom left the partnership. Bertha was the principal typesetter for the next 32 years. The Village Press's first production was \\"Printing,\\" an essay by William Morris and Emery Walker, in keeping with the proprietors' dedication to Morris-style Arts and Crafts aesthetics and philosophy. They moved the press the following year to Hingham, Massachusetts, and in 1906 to New York City. Following a disastrous studio fire in 1908, Frederic Goudy increasingly specialized in type design, and Bertha Goudy took over the business of the press. He wrote and illustrated and she typeset two works now considered classics of lettering design: The Alphabet (Kennerley, 1918) and Elements of Lettering (Kennerley, 1922). The final move of the press was in 1924, to Marlborough-on-Hudson, New York, to a house with an adjacent mill, which the Goudys called Deepdene. Bertha Goudy was widely recognized during this period as the driving force behind the Village Press, and in 1933, Time Magazine called her \\"the world's ablest woman printer.\\" The American Institute of Graphic Arts recognized her achievements alongside those of her husband's in an exhibition honoring the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Village Press in 1933.American Institute of Graphic Arts.

One of her final and most demanding works was Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, for the Limited Editions Club, published in 1934.  Death and tributes  Bertha Goudy suffered a stroke in December 1933, from which she only partially recovered. She died on October 21, 1935. Following her death, a number of colleagues and friends memorialized Bertha Goudy's contributions to typography. Spearheaded by Edna Beilenson, co-proprietor of the Peter Pauper Press, a group of women active in fine press and book making collaborated to produce a feminist work entitled Bookmaking on the Distaff Side, published in 1937. Beilenson, Jane Grabhorn, Bruce Rogers, and others contributed, and convinced Frederic Goudy to include a memorial to his wife, which he later published separately as Bertha M. Goudy: Recollections by One Who Knew Her Best (Marlboro, NY: The Village Press, 1939), and set in Bertham type. He had named his hundredth typeface, Bertham, in honor of his wife (\\"Bertha M.\\"). Female members of the same group of friends formed the Distaff Press, which later republished selections from Bookmaking on the Distaff Side, along with additional contributions, to produce Bertha S. Goudy: First Lady of Printing in 1958. This \\"remembrance of the distaff side of the Village Press\\" was issued as a fine press, limited edition publication, in the spirit of Bertha Goudy's own private press productions, hand-bound and hand-printed.

Dragsters, also commonly called \\"diggers\\", can be broadly placed in three categories, based on the fuel they use: gasoline, methanol, and nitromethane. They are most commonly single-engined, though twin-engined and quad-engined designs did race in the 1950s and 1960s. The design of dragsters evolved from the front-engined rail (named for the exposed frame rails) of the earliest days of drag racing, into the \\"slingshot\\" (with the driver between or behind the rear tires, or \\"slicks\\") of the early to middle 1960s, to the \\"modern\\" type common in the 1970s. Depending on the class they run in, dragsters can be injected or supercharged (or turbocharged), with a variety of possible engines. The engines are most often derived from automobiles'; some early examples used surplus aircraft engines. Today, they may also be electric. Dragsters are distinct from \\"bodied\\" cars such as funny cars and gassers, as well as from Altereds.  History  =Front engine= The front engine dragster came about due to engines initially being located in the car's frame in front of the driver. The driver sits angled backward, over the top of the differential in a cockpit situated between the two rear tires, a design originating with Mickey Thompson's Panorama City Special in 1954, as a way of improving traction. This position led to many drivers being maimed when catastrophic clutch failures occurred. Due to limited traction, some dragsters with four rear drive wheels were attempted as well as designs with twin engines. The final Top Fuel driver to win a National Hot Rod Association national event in a front engine dragster was Art Marshall on August 6, 1972 at the Le Grandnational outside of Montreal, Canada. =Rear engine= The drawbacks of front-engine designs (including fatalities) led to several attempts at rear- engined cars. Among them were pioneering rear-engined dragsters (and funny cars, including Doug Thorley's and Dave Bowman's\\"Gallery: The Best of 1970s Drag Racing\\", written by Dave Kommel on April 25, 2017, at Hot Rod online (retrieved 22 May 2017)) were Steve Swaja's AA/Gas Wedge I from 1963, Roger Lindwall's 1966 Top Fuel Re-Entry and Kent Fuller's fueller Sidewinder III, both in 1969.Taylor, Thom. \\"Tony Nancy Gas Dragster\\", \\"Roger Lindwall Re- Entry\\", and \\"Kent Fuller Sidewinder III\\", in \\"Beauty Beyond the Twilight Zone\\", pp.34, 38, and 42.NHRA.com (retrieved 24 May 2017) In mid-1969, Drag Wedge, built by Logghe Brothers for Andy Granatelli, debuted, and later that year, prodded to action by the death of John Mulligan, Woody Gilmore (following the mid-engined Funny Car he built for Doug Thorley) and Pat Foster developed a rear-engined fuel dragster, which was unveiled in December.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear- engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) Driven by Foster, the Gilmore car ran just once, getting up on its single rear wheelie bar and breaking in two at around , at Lions Drag Strip.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear-engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) Gilmore and Foster built a similar car, Pawnbroker, for Dwane Ong, incorporating the lessons of the previous car; it debuted in 1970, and proved considerably better.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear-engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) In August, Ong won the 1970 AHRA Nationals in the car.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear-engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) Pawnbroker won the American Hot Rod Association Summernats in Long Island, New York, the first national event win for a rear-engined car, with a pass of 6.83 at .Hot Rod staff writers. \\"The History Of Hot Rodding – 1970s\\", written 29 August 2013, at Hot Rod Network (retrieved 19 June 2017) \\"Big Daddy\\" Don Garlits examined the car and was so impressed with the forward view, he could not understand why everyone did not drive oneand why it did not work.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear-engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) Around the same time, Bernie Schacker's rear-engined car, the first with a rear wing, was the first to run in the sixes, with a 6.98 at , at New York National Speedway's Spring Nationals (an event sanctioned by none of the national bodies).Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear-engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) In April 1970, Mark Williams' car, built for Mike Dollins and Dan Widner (at a cost of only US$2,111.16), first appeared; its wheelbase was significantly longer than the usual for fuellers at the time.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear-engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) The car ran well, but required new driving techniques; Dollins and Widner lacked the money to continue racing it, and it was sold to a Colorado team, which switched to a hemi (rather than the usual .Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear-engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) Others rear-engined cars included ones built by Art Malone (before working with Garlits on his), the National Speed Products Research carbuilt by Frank Huszar (Race Car Specialties) on a stunning wheelbase; driven by Chuck Tanko, it was overweight, at , and could only achieve 7.20s at , never running in competition.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear-engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) On March 8, 1970, at Lions Drag Strip,NHRA.com (retrieved 24 May 2017 Garlits was driving Swamp Rat XIII, also called the Wynnscharger, a slingshot rail, when the vehicle suffered a catastrophic failure, and the car broke in half in front of the cockpit.NHRA.com photo (retrieved 24 May 2017) Garlits returned to Pomona with a brand new mid-engined car, Swamp Rat XIV, in 1971.

She was among the first generation of women to take the Classical Tripos examinations at the University of Cambridge, and was the only person to be placed in the top division of the first class at the end of her third year, in 1887. She married the Master of Trinity College, Henry Montagu Butler, in August 1888, becoming the leading hostess in Cambridge. She published a version of Book VII of Herodotus' Histories in 1891. Early life and education Punch published a cartoon by George du Maurier about her examination success. As she was the only person in the first class of the Classical Tripos that year, placing above all the men, Mr Punch and his dog Toby are shown ushering her into a first class compartment which is for ladies only. She was born Agnata Ramsay in London on 28 January 1867, the daughter of Sir James Henry Ramsay, 10th Baronet of Bamff, and Elizabeth Mary Charlotte née Scott-Kerr. She came from a family with a history of academic achievement as her father published books on history, her uncle George Gilbert Ramsay was a professor of humanity at Glasgow University and her grandfather, Sir George Ramsay, published works on philosophy. Brought up in Perthshire, she attended St Leonards School in St Andrews. In 1884, she went as the Misses Metcalfes' Scholar to Girton College, Cambridge, where she read Classics. Her achievement in being the only candidate in 1887 to be placed in the top division of the first class in the Classical Tripos examinations – thereby being placed above all of the men in her year – was marked with a cartoon in Punch which was entitled 'Honour to Agnata Frances Ramsay' and showed her boarding a train's first-class compartment marked 'For Ladies Only'. Personal life du Maurier cartoon in Punch about the 'crib for Herodotus' While a student, she worked hard at her studies but also found time for outdoor pursuits which she enjoyed, including tennis and skating. She was president of the debating society and, while she did not speak often, she impressed others with her eloquence and humility. In August 1888, she married the Master of Trinity, Henry Montagu Butler. They had met at the Cambridge Greek Play, a performance of Oedipus Rex in November 1887 for which Butler had arranged a large party of 42. He had included Agnata because of her prowess in the classics but he later wrote that it was her \\"goodness ... not her Greek and Latin, which have stolen my heart\\". Even so, he allowed that, on their honeymoon, they \\"read a great deal of Greek together\\". They had three sons, James, Gordon, and Nevile. Their first child was born while she was working on her edition of Herodotus, which prompted Punch to run another punning cartoon, in which she was portrayed as ordering 'a crib for Herodotus'. James became an academic, and was Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University; Gordon was killed in action in Egypt in 1916; Nevile became a diplomat, serving as British Ambassador to Brazil and to the Netherlands. After the death of her husband in 1918, she remained in Cambridge, where she was involved in the local Christian Science church. She died in Harrow on 27 May 1931. Classical scholarship At Cambridge, she worked on a version of Book VII (Polymnia) of Herodotus' Histories. It was published in the original Ancient Greek with notes in 1891, as part of Macmillan's Classical series for colleges and schools. She may have been the first British woman to produce an edition of a classical author. In 2006, Mary Beard wrote that \\"Agnata Ramsey was one of the most notorious casualties of the university marriage market\\", as she \\"did very little classics ever after\\". Her husband, Montagu Butler, was friends with the poet laureate, Alfred, Lord Tennyson. In 1892 the couple visited Farringford House, where she and Tennyson discussed classical works such as the Alcaics of Horace and Sappho. She recalled his scepticism about the recent discovery of Troy, Another famous classicist was A. E. Housman who wrote in 1911 to thank her after a visit, Prize A prize for the best classics students in their second or third year was established and awarded by the Butlers – the Agnata Butler Prize. Winners included Caroline Skeel (1893/4), Dorothy Tarrant (1907) and Barbara Wootton (1917).

He is noted for having been a teacher of George Gershwin. Biography Hambitzer was born into a musical family in Beloit, Wisconsin. The year of his birth is variously given as either 1878 or 1881. His great-grandfather was a violinist in the Russian royal court and his father owned a music store in Milwaukee. He studied with Julius Albert Jahn and Hugo Kahn after which he played in the orchestra of the Arthur Friend Stock Company. He taught piano, violin, and cello at the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music. In 1908, he moved to New York City where he joined Joseph Knecht's orchestra at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, usually appearing as piano soloist. During that time he lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan where he wrote music and opened a music school. Among his most notable pupils was George Gershwin, who became one of America's leading composers. In 1914, Hambitzer's wife died of tuberculosis and four years later he died of the same disease. George once said that Charles was his first major musical influence in life. Nathaniel Shilkret, a noted composer and conductor, was a member of the Waldorf-Astoria Orchestra during the period that Hambitzer was there. Shilkret's autobiography includes a brief discussion of Hambitzer's life, including the following comments about their common time with the Waldorf- Astoria Orchestra: \\"Hambitzer played viola, oboe, bassoon, cello and organ, but [during this period], never piano.\\" Shilkret said that Frank Longo, the then-Waldorf-Astoria Orchestra pianist, dared Hambitzer to show how good he was when an orchestra member told Longo to take piano lessons from Hambitzer. Shilkret writes about Hambitzer's response: \\"Hambitzer said, 'I have not touched the piano for years, but I'll try.' He sat down and played one classic composition after another. He could play any number we suggested. He was the most natural pianist I ever heardbarring no oneand his memory was phenomenal. Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, Chopin, Schumann, Liszt. . . Pieces just poured out of him flawlessly. . . . Of course, Hambitzer's performance got around, and in a short time he became the busiest teacher in New York. . . . I studied piano with him.\\"Shilkret, Nathaniel, ed. Shell, Niel and Barbara Shilkret, Nathaniel Shilkret: Sixty Years in the Music Business, Scarecrow Press, Lanham, Maryland, 2005.

As an A&R; executive at the Victor Talking Machine and a conductor who had conducted for very large number of the finest musicians of his era, Shilkret was eminantly qualified to judge a musician's talent. Compositions  Hambitzer was noted for his prodigious musical talent and feverish compositional skill. He wrote many songs, and his work also included orchestral tone poems and incidental music for plays by Shakespeare and other playwrights.

Konstantin Stanislavski, the MAT director, was her husband. In 1933 Lilina was designated as a Meritorious Artist of RSFSR.Maria Petrovna Lilina. Biography at the Moscow Art Theatre site Career Lilina was a founding member of the MAT troupe which she joined in 1898. Her two breakthrough performances, which brought her to fame, were Masha in The Seagull and Sonya in Uncle Vanya, both praised for \\"fitting perfectly Chekhov's aesthetics.\\" Also lauded were her Natasha in Three Sisters; later Varya in The Cherry Orchard and Nina Zarechnaya in the renewed Seagull. In 1906-1915 Lilina played three parts in Alexander Griboyedov's Woe from Wit: Liza, a sly and clever peasant servant, as well as graceful Countess the Granddaughter, and Khlyostova, the latter with satyrical verve and wit. Her tandem with Stanislavsky in Leo Tolstoy's The Living Corpse (he Prince Abrezkov, she Anna Dmitriyevna) has been described as \\"the living amalgam of the fullness of life and the precision of the expression.\\" Lilina was said to have \\"understood perfectly the electrically charged dynamics of the Dostoyevsky prose, full of emotional overload,\\" and was stunning as Karpukhina in The Uncle's Dream and as Khromonozhka (Limping Girl) in Nikolai Stavrogin (based upon Besy), according to Inna Solovyova. \\"Many considered her the most subtle and deep of the MAT actresses,\\" this critic argued. Lilina has always regarded her husband as her teacher and Stanislavsky often referred to her as his 'best ever student'. He dedicated his book The Actor's Work on Himself (Работа актера над собой) to Lilina. Her other notable roles included Tatyana in Dmitry Merezhkovsky's Joy Will Come, The Guest (The Life of Man by Leonid Andreyev) and Anna Andreyevna in Revisor (1921).Lilina, Maria Petrovna in Krogosvet, the On-line encyclopedia After MAT's 1923-1924 foreign tour Lilina's domestic obligations started to prevail, her contribution to the theatre became limited.

As a Captain, she piloted the Dublin-based Rescue 116 helicopter. She was killed in the 2017 Irish Coast Guard Rescue 116 crash in March 2017. Background Fitzpatrick had originally wanted to join Aer Lingus, but didn't get accepted. The Irish Air Corps was hiring pilots, so she began taking helicopter lessons. She was one of the first women to pilot an aircraft for the Irish Marine Emergency Service, the precursor to the Coast Guard. She was initially stationed with the Shannon-based search and rescue team, before transferring to Waterford in 2002 where she became chief pilot of the Rescue 117 helicopter, a Sikorsky S-61N. She later joined the Dublin Coast Guard crew and was pilot in charge of Rescue 116, a Sikorsky S-92A. In 2010, Fitzpatrick and her crew received the \\"Best of Irish Award\\" for rescuing an airplane pilot who had crashed into the Irish Sea. In August 2013, Fitzpatrick and her colleague, Captain Carmel Kirby, made Irish aviation history when they crewed the first all-female mission in the Irish Coast Guard helicopter service. In 2007, she created a video with the Irish Bishops’ Conference, on the theme of \\"alcohol and the challenge of moderation.\\" She was also known for her starring role in Rescue 117, a 2011 documentary series on RTÉ which gave behind-the-scenes access to the helicopter search and rescue service. Death EI-ICR, the aircraft involved in the accident Fitzpatrick died after her search and rescue team's helicopter, Rescue 116, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean while providing top cover for the Sligo-based search and rescue helicopter, Rescue 118, during a rescue mission off the west coast of County Mayo, Ireland. Fitzpatrick was found and later pronounced dead at Mayo University Hospital in Castlebar. The body belonging to one of the missing crew was found in the cockpit section of the aircraft on 24 March by Navy divers and it was retrieved on 26 March after which it was identified as that of co-pilot Captain Mark Duffy. Two other members of the crew, Winchman Ciarán Smith and Winch Operator Paul Ormsby remained missing and memorial services were held for them in May 2017 and June 2017 respectively. The search and recovery operation was scaled back after April 2017. Her funeral took place on 18 March and she was buried.

It was first described from the eastern Mediterranean where it is an invasive species having colonised the coasts of the Levantine Sea from the Red Sea by Lessepsian migration from the Red Sea via the Suez Canal. Description Ixa monodi has a transversely ovoid carapace which is laterally stretched to form a process on each side which is cylindrical and covered in tubercles. The forehead is forked and the orbits are deep and completely overhang the eyes with three indentations in their outer margins. The posterior margin bears two granulose tubercles. The dorsal surface of the carapace has two longitudinal grooves which fork before the long. thin chelipeds. The carapace is pale reddish-orange in colour with more intensely coloured granules, the lateral processes are paler towards their tips, the chelipeds are orange and the pereopods are paler orange. The largest individual recorded had a carapace length of 59.2 mm. Distribution Ixa monodi is native to the Red Sea and was probably originally identified as Ixa cylindrus by Dr. Theodore Monod in 1938 from the Gulf of Suez but it was definitely described in 1956 from specimens collected by Holthuis & Gottlieb off the coast of south- easternTurkey at Mersin Bay in 1955. It has since been recorded from Israel, Syria, Rhodes and Egypt. Habitat Ixa monodi occurs on sandy or muddy substrates in shallow waters between 14m and 60m in depth. Naming Ixa monodi is named in honour of Dr. Theodore Monod, who was director of the Institut Francais d'Afrique Noire at Dakar, as he was the first scientist to publish an illustration of this species. The specimen collected by Holthuis and Gottlieb in Mersin Bay in 1955 is the holotype of Ixa monodi and has been preserved in the collection of the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie in Leiden.

It features 23 rooms and encompasses 9200 square feet. Henn owned eight acres surrounding the house, on which he grew grapes which he sold commercially. Henn lost his fortune during the great depression and, unable to pay his municipal taxes, he turned his house and his property over to the City of Euclid on stipulation that he be allowed to reside on the premises until his death, which occurred in 1947. The adjoining land became Sims Park, and the mansion was used as classrooms, the Euclid Board of Education's offices, and then as the location of Euclid's Recreation Department. The structure was allowed to deteriorate in the 1990s, and the city proposed to demolish it in 1996, upon which the Friends of the Henn Mansion was founded. The Albert W.

In an edited version it made its way into the In Twilight (В сумерках), 1887 collection, published in Saint Petersburg. In 1898 the Tilde Press released it as a separate edition. Chekhov included it into Volume 3 of his Collected Works published by Adolf Marks in 1899–1901.Polotskaya, E. A. Commentaries to Святою ночью. The Works by A.P. Chekhov in 12 volumes. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura. Moscow, 1960. Vol. 4, pp. 540-541 Synopsis The protagonist takes a trip across the Goltva river on the Easter Eve to visit a local church and enjoy the nightly Easter festivities. On his way he is engaged in a conversation with a monk ferryman named Ieronym, a slightly eccentric 30-something man who is deeply shattered by the recent death of his best friend and mentor, monk Nikolai. The latter appears to have been a genius master of Akathist, who had never in his life had one single reader or listener of his wonderful stories, beside Ieronym... The protagonist returns by the same ferry, disturbed by the cruel contrast between the joyful, flamboyant church service, and the grief and loneliness of this extremely sensitive person, so forsaken in this world, on the other... Where nobody had even cared to send him a changer, so that he now has to start his second shift in a row. Reception The theatre historian Nikolai Drizen (in his 1929 essay) quoted Alexey Pleshcheyev as saying: \\"Reading [In Twilight], I felt as though Turgenev's aura was embracing me... The same placid poetry of prose, these wondrous descriptions of nature...\\" The story that impressed him most was \\"Easter Eve\\", according to Drizen.N.V. Drizen. Chekhov and His Plays. Paris, Vozrozhdenye, 15 July 1929 // Н.В. Дризен. Чехов и его пьесы Dmitry Merezhkovsky, reviewing two Checkhov's collections, In Twilight (1887) and Stories (1888), compared \\"Easter Eve\\" to the poems in prose by Turgenev and Baudelaire. Speaking of the monk Nikolai character, he interpreted him as another loser, similar to Likharev from \\"On the Way\\" [На пути, published in Severny Vestnik, No.11, 1888]. Chekhov felt baffled. \\"What kind of loser he is? He'd had an enviable life. Was close to God, knew not of hunger, was endowed with literary gift... Dividing people into losers and winners is too narrow an approach,\\" he wrote to Alexey Suvorin in a letter dated 3 November 1888. References External links * Святою ночью.

When a subsea power cable is laid, there is an area where the cable can be subjected to increased dynamic forces, which the cable is not necessarily designed to survive over the lifetime of the installation. Cable protection systems are used to allow the specification, and thus cost, of a subsea power cable to be reduced, by removing the need to include additional armoring of the cable. The resulting cables can be produced more cheaply, whilst still providing the 20 years + lifetime required. Offshore windfarm developers in particular have adopted the use of Cable protection systems due to the dynamic area where the cable comes from the seabed and enters the monopile/J-tube. This is in part due to the potential for localised scouring to occur near the structure. A CPS generally consists of three sections, a Centraliser or Monopile interface, a protection system for the dynamic area, and a protection system for the static area. The installation of J-Tubes for offshore renewable monopiles was viewed as a costly approach, and a 'latching' type of cable protection system which penetrates the outer wall of the monopile, via a specifically designed angled aperture enables the simplification of monopile design, and removes the need for additional works post pile driving which usually involved the use of divers. This approach is becoming the industry standard in monopile design, assisting developers to reduce their costs for construction.  History  Articulated half-pipe Cable protections systems have traditionally been used for the protection of cables at shore landings, and other areas where cable damage could be envisaged, and burial was not practical. Patents for variations of articulated pipe cable protections date back to 1929. The system was described as a cable armor shield > \\"adapted to protect the cable from damage and wear occasioned by rubbing on > rocks, contacting with ships, anchors or other objects, and has for its > object to provide a practical flexible armor shield of this class which can > be readily applied to the cable at any point along its length.\\" From their outset cable protection systems were designed to be simple, effective, and easy to assemble. The systems consisted of a series of half shells which had a convex flange at one end and a larger socket flange at the other allowing the sections to form a flexible universal joint connection between them. Due to the intended use of heavy cast or forged metals they also had the added advantage of increasing the weight of the cable being installed, thus reducing movement on the seabed. Over the years innovations have occurred improving the articulation of the joints with modern articulated pipes being more akin to ball-joints, and some manufacturers providing 'boltless' articulated pipes, thus saving assembly time. Changes in the metallurgy have also happened, leading to most half shell articulated pipe now being made from ductile iron, due to its improved strength and elasticity characteristics. Today these articulated pipes are also utilised for their bend restriction properties, allowing them to be utilised as bend restrictors for the protected cable.  Design considerations  Cable protection systems are predominantly designed to protect the system from damage throughout the lifetime of the cable caused by fatigue, overbending of the cable, and to provide protection of the cable until it reaches an area of burial. = Design life = The cable protection system will be designed to provide protection for a specific lifetime, the 'design life' of the system, which may vary dependent upon the conditions encountered. = Overbending of cable = Overbending of the cable occurs when the cable is bent in a radius of less than the minimum bending radius defined by the manufacturer. Although the cable may initially survive the overbending, this can lead to subsequent fatigue within the cable ultimately leading to cable failure. The CPS selected should maintain a radius which is greater than the specified minimum bend radius. = Fatigue of CPS/cable within = Subsea cable protection systems can encounter wear due to movement, and general changes in composition due to being submerged for a prolongued period of time, such as corrosion or changes in polymer based compounds. Consideration should be given to the induced effects on the CPS resulting from the dynamic elements in the environment. Simple changes such as changes in temperature, current or salinity can result in changes in the ability of the CPS to offer protection for the life of the cable. It is advisable to carefully assess the potential effects of movement of the CPS, relating to the dynamic abilities of the cable. The CPS may withstand the worst conditions seen over a 100yr period, but would the cable inside the CPS survive these movements. In some instances, such as shore ends for fibre optic cables where rocky outcrops are present, dynamic influences can be reduced by securing the articulated pipe to the seabed rock, thus reducing the degree of movement remaining. Some manufacturers have performed independent empirical testing to provide a simulated 25yr life cycle of the dynamic forces applicable to their product in order to provide customers with improved confidence in the survivability of the system. Another cause for failure of subsea power cables is caused by overheating, which can occur where a cable is contained within a CPS without adequate ability to dissipate the heat produced by the cable. These lead to early fatigue of the cable insulation, necessitating the replacement of the cable. Subsea cable incidents account for around 77% of the total global cost of wind farm losses. Since 2007 this percentage, which has varied between 70% and 80%, is statistically reported year after year. = Seabed stability = Seabed stability is an important factor associated with cable protection systems. Should the cable protection system be too buoyant, it is less likely to remain in contact with the seabed, thus the CPS is more likely to require additional remedial stability measures, such as installation of concrete mattresses, rockbags, or rockdumping. = Suspension strength = When a CPS is being installed to interface with a monopile structure, there is likely to be seabed scouring to some degree. Should the scouring become excessive, the CPS may be suspended within a scour hole, and needs to be capable of supporting its own weight, and that of the cable within. Failure to sustain this loading scenario will lead to failure of the CPS, which will in turn allow the forces to act upon the cable within, ultimately leading to cable damage. = Installation = Within the renewables market in particular, installation of CPS's are preferred to be completely diverless, as this reduces the developers cost, and removes risk to human life through diving in a hazardous area. = Removal/Reinstallation = A final consideration for CPS is that of removal of the cable should a failure occur. Some designs require diver intervention to recover the cable with the CPS. Due consideration should also be given to the removal of a CPS should the CPS itself fail. The costs associated with CPS replacement during the operational lifetime of an offshore wind farm are not insignificant, as the cable will most likely require repair/replacement as part of the process.  Bend restrictors  Various innovative systems have been developed to provide restriction of bending, including ductile iron articulated pipe, and polymer or metal based vertebrae systems. Vertebrae bend restrictors are available in both metal and polymer based forms. Some cable protection systems include a polymer based vertebrae system which restricts the bend radius to a maximum of a few degrees per segment. These systems are lighter (in water) than their metal equivalents and often more expensive to produce but must be carefully assessed for longevity in the proposed application. Due to the use of polymers these systems tend to be of a larger diameter than their metal counterparts, which presents a larger surface area for drag induced forces caused by currents.  Bend stiffeners  Bend stiffeners are conically shaped polymer mouldings designed to add local stiffness to the product contained within, limiting bending stresses and curvature to acceptable levels. Bend stiffeners are generally suitable for water depths of 35 metres or less, and their suitability is highly dependent on currents and seabed conditions at site. Extreme care must be taken when selecting a stiffener, especially relating to the lifespan of the system as these themselves can become fatigued/fragile. As the stiffness of these products are dependent upon the nature of the plastic used, careful testing and QA of plastics should be carefully considered as flaws introduced during material manufacture, processing, machining and molding.  Other systems  Various other polymer based systems have been developed which provide a flexible 'tube' which can be attached to the structure in advance of the cable being installed, although these are relatively new to the industry, and considered by some as unproven. = Applicable Standards = Although there are no specific standards for cable protections systems, DNVGL-RP-0360 Subsea power cables in shallow water includes a section on Cable Protection at the interface to a structure (Section 4.7).

He is the managing director and founder of Storck Bicycle, award-winning designer and innovator, and his current developments hold the world record lightness and stiffness to weight ratios.  Early life  Storck was born in 1964 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, where he worked in his parents' bicycle shop, and the first German retailer of Cannondale bicycles. Storck comes from a long lineage of bicyclists and bike racers. His great, great grandfather joined a cycling club in 1876 and was a member for over 25 years. His grandfather, Willi Muller, and granduncle were professional racers on the Opel professional racing team, with his grandfather winning several track and road races. Most of his extended family either competed in races or was heavily involved in cycling. Storck started biking at an early age and competed in his first road race at six. His grandparents and parents owned several bicycle shops and Storck was involved in the shops at a young age. As a teenager, his parents opened another shop which Storck ran after school. His family interest in bicycles led him to complete a business course in the bicycle trade, followed by launching his first business, Bike- tech, in 1986. He founded Storck Bike-tech GmbH in 1989 and Storck Bike-tech, Inc. in the US in 1992, and in 1995 rebranded the company under the name \\"Storck Bicycle\\".  Career  = Storck Bike-tech = Early in Storck's career, his focus was on the import and trade of bicycles from Klein, Merlin, Fat Chance, Ritchey, Crank Brothers, as well as bike frames from Taiwan and Japan he rebranded under the Storck name. In 1990, Storck traveled to Japan to study under bicycle master frame-builder and founder of Toyo, Yoshiaki Ishigaki. He learned to work with steel, titanium, aluminum, and magnesium to build custom bike frames, which later led to his carbon fiber innovations. Storck went on to engineer and develop the world's first ever carbon fiber bicycle crank in 1992, which started selling in 1993. Weighing at 280g they were the lightest cranks ever built and the innovative use of carbon fiber founded the standard Storck would follow in future bicycles, components, and accessories. = Storck bicycle = Markus Storck on one of his Storck road bikes at Cap Formentor, Mallorca A contract termination with Klein bicycles in 1990 due to its acquisition by Trek bicycles led to the rebranding of Storck Bike-tech and Markus Storck's renewed design and development of his own bicycle and component production. In 1995, Storck began the design and manufacturing of aluminum frame bicycles in Portland, Oregon with the assistance of Kinesis USA, a subsidiary of Kinesis Industry, and in 1996, Dutch mountain bicyclist Bart Brentjens won the gold medal at the first cross- country mountain bike race of the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia, on a mountain bike of Storck's design collaboration with Hercules, Schauff, and American Eagle. Markus Storck's innovations using Vacuum Void Controlled production technology allowed him to reduce the resin content of the high- grade carbon bicycle frames by a third, allowing his future designs to have lighter, stiffer frames, while maintaining comfort and stability. Between 1997 and 2017, Storck has designed and produced over 100 bicycles, including road bikes, cross- and triathlon bikes, mountain bikes, and hybrids. In 2008, Storck opened up the first Storck brand store in Korea followed by stores in Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Japan, UK, Switzerland. Storck Bicycle was last reported to have earnings in 2007 of €3.9 million.  Other ventures  In 1990, together with his friend Erich Reiss, Storck founded the Eurobike show, a bicycle trade fair which has grown from 268 international exhibitors to over 1,000. Eurobike is considered the world's largest bicycle trade show. In 2003, he was a jury member of the iF Industrial Design forum in Hanover, for their international design competition. In 2005, Storck was a jury member of the Materialica Design Awards in Munich. In 2008, Storck, along with Energy SüwagSupplier under a German government funded project to explore electromobility in the Rhine-Main region, designed and manufactured 200 custom battery-powered eBikes (pedelec) and solar charging stations. In 2015, Storck partnered with Rehau to design a new eBike concept for the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy, called nam:e: In 2016, he received the JEC Innovation Award and in 2017, the German Design Award for nam:e:  One of Seven Projects and Collaborations  One of Seven paired Storck with famous brands to design a limited run of bespoke items. Storck collaborated on the design and incorporated carbon fiber into all of the designs. Creating only seven of each product, Storck kept the original of each. = McLaren = In 2015, Storck and McLaren unveiled the super rare McLaren 650S. Storck, McLaren's Special Ops division, and the Dorr Group created what they call an \\"automotive sculpture.\\" It has all of the internal parts of the McLaren 650S Spider with new design elements, including a paint mixture that shifts from copper to brown, depending on the light. Storck worked with McLaren to use their own carbon fiber parts, so every part is able to be replaced from the factory. In 2016, the McLaren 1of7 received a German Design Award special mention. = Blac Carbon Sunglasses = Storck teamed up with Blac to create custom carbon sunglasses. Blac uses a proprietary blend of lightweight carbon fiber and titanium to create a light, strong frame. = Storck Aeronario Platinum Disc = Creating a bike to match the McLaren, Storck used the same paint to create a color-shifting limited run bicycle. = Balthasar-Ress Wine = Storck and Balthasar-Ress released seven exclusive bottles of wine. The packaging included a handmade wooden box with a matte black surface. Aluminum paper and a laser-engraved plate were used as well to create a unique package. = Blaken Rolex = Storck next teamed up with Rolex to create an individually designed Blaken watch. The Blaken line uses a Diamond Like Carbon Coating which appears similar to carbon fiber. = Aston Martin = Storck teamed up with the Q division of Aston Martin to create a new version of the Vanquish, using black satin paint and adding in carbon fiber to much of the vehicle. During the process, Aston Martin created a new manufacturing process for the carbon fiber bodywork. Custom details included hand stitching, the One of Seven symbol and carbon fiber Aston Martin symbols. In 2017, the Aston Martin Vanquish 1of7 received a German Design Award special mention.  Awards and recognition  In 1997, Storck entered his Adrenalin \\"fully\\" bicycle in the Red Dot competition for design and won first place. This was his first ever international competition. In 1998, Storck's carbon fiber Power Arms bicycle crank won the design competition. In 1999, Storck won the design competition again, this time for the Storck \\"Organic\\" mountain bike. In 1999, Storck launched the \\"Stiletto Light\\" road bike fork, which weighed 280 grams and was the test winner of Tour bike magazine. Additionally, his carbon fiber Power Arms bicycle crank won the 1999 iF Design Award. Also in 2008, the Fascenario 0.7 IS road bike received the \\"Milestone\\" award for the most innovative bike product by Tour magazine, followed by the constructors' classification award in 2009. In 2002, Markus Storck's \\"Storck Organic\\" mountain bike was showcased at the ‘Ingenious Bicycle Patents’ exhibition at the German Patent and Trade Mark Office in Munich. In 2003 and 2006, Storck's bikes The Adrenalin Carbonhttp://www.bikeradar.com/us/gear/category/bikes/mountain- bikes/product/review-storck-adrenalin-carbon-10153/ and Scenario CD1.0 10th Anniversaryhttp://www.bikeradar.com/us/gear/category/bikes/road/product/review- storck-cd-1-0-road-10360/ were recognized with the iF Product Design Award at Eurobike.

She is the first woman to hold the position of Secretary in the ACTU’s 90-year history. Prior to becoming Secretary she served as a Vice President and Campaigns Director. Before joining the ACTU, McManus was the Branch Secretary and an organiser with the Australian Services Union (ASU) in NSW and the ACT for 22 years. She has led many campaigns in the private, public and community sectors, including the first collective agreement for IBM workers anywhere in the world, the anti-privatisation campaign at Sydney Water, as well as the equal pay campaign for community workers. This was a seven-year campaign that delivered between pay increases of 18-40 per cent for all workers, the vast majority of which were women.  Early life and background  McManus grew up in Carlingford, New South Wales, Australia and is the daughter of a railway worker and a clerical staffer at a Parramatta pharmaceuticals factory. She has two younger brothers. At the age of 16, McManus was first involved in union activity when she joined with other students supporting a teachers strike protest against mass teacher lay-offs by the Greiner Liberal state government in 1988.  Education  McManus went to Carlingford High School and studied for a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy at Macquarie University where she graduated with a first class honours. At 19, McManus was elected president of the Macquarie University Union. She stopped smoking in the university bar and banned single-use plastics on campus. Deputy Leader of Labor, Tanya Plibersek knew McManus during their time at University.https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/is-sally-mcmanus-the-woman- the-coalition-fears-most-20181011-p508zx.html Career McManus started work when she was 14 and worked as a shop assistant, Pizza Hut driver, cleaner and call centre worker prior to joining the ACTU’s Trainee Organisers Program in 1994. From there, she became an Organiser for the Australian Services Union, focusing on workers in call centres and the IT sector. In 2004 she became Branch Secretary of the ASU in NSW and the ACT and oversaw membership grow from 9500 to 12,000. In 2012, McManus founded the Destroy The Joint campaign formed in response to radio broadcaster Alan Jones' criticism of then Prime Minister Julia Gillard and other prominent women. Her activism was recognised in 2015 when she received an Edna Ryan Award in the Grand Stirrer category. In 2015, McManus moved to the ACTU as Vice-President and Campaigns Director and was ultimately elected ACTU Secretary two years later. Her first television interview as Secretary sparked controversy, when McManus refused to back down from the use of illegal industrial action as a method of union campaigning. Asked by presenter Leigh Sales, on the ABC’s news and current affairs program 7.30, if the ACTU would distance itself from such action, McManus responded “There is no way we’ll be doing that,” later adding “I believe in the rule of law when the law is fair and the law is right, but when it’s unjust I don’t think there’s a problem with breaking it.” The statement was widely condemned by business and industry groups, as well as then Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who said he was unlikely to work with her. In February 2019, her book 'On Fairness' was published by Melbourne University Publishing. In June 2019, McManus called for the resignation of CFMMEU Victorian state secretary John Setka, after he stated he was pleading guilty to domestic violence charges. Prior to the 2019 Federal Election McManus lead the union movements ‘Change the Rules’ campaign, which pushed for workplace rights. Rallies were held across the country, with worker and supporter turn-outs reaching over 200,000 across the country. During the COVID-19 pandemic Sally McManus led the successful ACTU campaign for a national wage subsidy scheme, negotiating with the conservative Morrison Government to secure the JobKeeper wage subsidy, and campaigned for Paid Pandemic Leave. Personal life McManus is an enthusiastic player of computer games, and describes herself as “the definition of a total gamer”, who has been playing since the DOS era. She particularly enjoys Metal Gear Solid, on PlayStation, and says her favourite of all is Civilization. McManus has a black belt in kung-fu and taekwondo. She is also a keen bird watcher and photographer. McManus has strong sporting links being a foundation member of both the Western Sydney Wanderers and Greater Western Sydney Giants as well as being a long-term support of Parramatta Eels.

Superimposes mixed realities to join, forming possible scenarios that behave as if real, while still maintaining virtual element(s). * Virtual reality - Full digital render/ representation of the real world; our reality.http://wiki.arl.wustl.edu/images/4/47/Zyda-2005-computer.pdf * Mixed reality - A combination of virtual reality and reality. * Virtuality - A virtual portrayal of contingent or non-contingent possibilities. Fiction Many science fiction books and films have imagined characters being \\"trapped in virtual reality\\" or entering into virtual reality. Laurence Manning's 1933 series of short stories, \\"The Man Who Awoke\\"—later a novel—describes a time when people ask to be connected to a machine that replaces all their senses with electrical impulses and, thus, live a virtual life chosen by them (à la The Matrix, but voluntary, not imposed). A comprehensive and specific fictional model for virtual reality was published in 1935 in the short story \\"Pygmalion's Spectacles\\" by Stanley G. Weinbaum. Other science fiction books have promoted the idea of virtual reality as a partial, but not total, substitution for the misery of reality, or have touted it as a method for creating virtual worlds in which one may escape from Earth. Stanisław Lem's 1961 story \\"I ( Corcoran)\\", translated in English as \\"Further Reminiscences of Ijon Tichy I\\", dealt with a scientist who created a number of computer- simulated people living in a virtual world. Lem further explored the implications of what he termed \\"phantomatics\\" in his nonfictional 1964 treatise Summa Technologiae. A number of other popular fictional works use the concept of virtual reality. These include William Gibson's 1984 Neuromancer, which defined the concept of cyberspace, and his 1994 Virtual Light, where a presentation viewable in VR-like goggles was the MacGuffin. Other examples are Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash, in which he made extensive reference to the term avatar to describe one's representation in a virtual world, and Rudy Rucker's The Hacker and the Ants, in which a programmer uses VR for robot design and testing. The Otherland series of 4 novels by Tad Williams, published from 1996 to 2001 and set in the 2070s, shows a world where the Internet has become accessible via virtual reality. Virtual reality stories based upon video games have also become popular in recent years, such as the 2011 novel Ready Player One by Ernest Cline, which is about a virtual reality system called the OASIS that people use to escape from the grim reality of a dying Earth in 2045. Other recent example include Conor Kostick's 2004 children's novel Epic 2006 and Louis Bulaong's 2020 sci-fi book Escapist Dream. September 05, 2020 August 29, 2020 Film The concept of virtual reality was popularized in mass media by movies such as Tron (1982), Brainstorm (1983), and The Lawnmower Man (1993). The .hack multimedia franchise is based on a virtual reality MMORPG dubbed \\"The World\\". The French animated series Code Lyoko is based on the virtual world of Lyoko and the Internet. * Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1973 film Welt am Draht, based on Daniel F. Galouye's novel Simulacron-3, shows a virtual reality simulation inside another virtual reality simulation * The 1982 film Tron told the story of a computer hacker sucked into a digital world physically inside a computer system. He attempted to escape with the help of the titular hero, a computer program within that virtual reality. * In 1983, the Natalie Wood/Christopher Walken film Brainstorm revolved around the production, use, and misuse of a VR device. * The 1990 film Total Recall, directed by Paul Verhoeven and based on the Philip K. Dick story \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\\" * A VR-like system, used to record and play back dreams, figures centrally in Wim Wenders' 1991 film Until the End of the World. * The 1992 film The Lawnmower Man tells the tale of a research scientist who uses a VR system to jumpstart the mental and physical development of his mentally handicapped gardener. * The 1993 film Arcade is centered around a new virtual reality game (from which the film gets its name) that actively traps those who play it inside its world. * The 1995 film Strange Days is a science-fiction thriller about a fictional virtual reality trend in which users buy illegal VR recordings of criminal offences recorded from the offender's point of view (POV). * The 1995 film Johnny Mnemonic has the main character Johnny (played by Keanu Reeves) use virtual reality goggles and brain–computer interfaces to access the Internet and extract encrypted information in his own brain. * The 1995 film Virtuosity has Russell Crowe as a virtual reality serial killer name SID 6.7 (Sadistic, Intelligent and Dangerous) who is used in a simulation to train real-world police officer, but manages to escape into the real world. * The 1999 film The Thirteenth Floor is an adaptation of Daniel F. Galouye's novel Simulacron-3, and tells about two virtual reality simulations, one in another. * In 1999, The Matrix and later sequels explored the possibility that our world is actually a vast virtual reality (or more precisely, simulated reality) created by artificially intelligent machines. * eXistenZ (1999), by David Cronenberg, in which level switches occur so seamlessly and numerously that at the end of the movie it is difficult to tell whether the main characters are back in \\"reality\\". * In the film Avatar, the humans are hooked up via advanced technologies with avatars, enabling the Na'vi avatars to remotely perform the actions of the humans that they wouldn't do on the gas-based planet Pandora. * Surrogates (2009) is based on a brain–computer interface that allows people to control realistic humanoid robots, giving them full sensory feedback. * The 2010 science fiction thriller film Inception is about a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious. He creates artificial thoughts that are so realistic that once they are implanted in a person's mind, the person thinks these are his own thoughts. * OtherLife (2017) - about a form of biological virtual reality. * The 2018 movie Ready Player One directed by Steven Spielberg is an adaptation of Ernest Cline's novel of the same name about a VR entertainment universe known as the OASIS. The film is set in the near future of 2045 James Halliday creates this virtual reality world called the oasis. Halliday left his immense fortune and control of the Oasis to the winner of a contest designed to find a worthy heir. Television * The Doctor Who serial \\"The Deadly Assassin\\", first broadcast in 1976, introduced a dream-like computer-generated reality, known as the Matrix. * The British BBC2 sci-fi series Red Dwarf features a virtual reality game titled \\"Better Than Life\\" that allows its users to experience a utopia. In the novel adaptations of the series, headsets for the game are treated like an illicit drug, and the main characters end up spending many years unknowingly connected. * Saban's syndicated superhero television series VR Troopers also made use of the concept where the titular characters fight villains that seek to invade from the virtual world. * The holodeck featured in Star Trek: The Next Generation is one of the best known examples of virtual reality in popular culture, including the ability for users to interactively modify scenarios in real time with a natural language interface. The depiction differs from others in the use of a physical room rather than a neural interface or headset. * The 2012 anime series Sword Art Online involves the concept of a virtual reality MMORPG of the same name, with the possibility of dying in real life when a player dies in the game due to the side effects of the NerveGear. In its 2014 sequel Sword Art Online II, the idea of bringing a virtual character into the real world via mobile cameras is posed; this concept is used to allow a bedridden individual to attend public school for the first time. * The anime Accel World (2012) expands the concept of virtual reality using the game Brain Burst, a game which allows players to gain and receive points to keep accelerating; accelerating is when an individual's brain perceives the images around them 1000 times faster, heightening their sense of awareness. * Episodes of Black Mirror have featured virtual reality:  The episode Playtest features an American traveler (portrayed by Wyatt Russell) who signs up to test a revolutionary new gaming system developed by the video game company SaitoGemu, but soon can't tell where the hot game ends and reality begins.  The episode San Junipero features a simulated reality set in different time periods at the titular beach resort town that the characters can inhabit, even past death, as seen with its main characters (portrayed by Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Mackenzie Davis). San Junipero is made by the company TCKR Systems as the robots there maintain it.  The episode USS Callister features Callister Inc.'s MMORPG game \\"Infinity\\" that uses virtual reality from TCKR Systems. Utilizing virtual reality technology in his modded \\"Infinity\\" game, Callister Inc.'s CTO Robert Daly portrays the captain of the titular ship from his favorite show \\"Space Fleet\\" where he orders around the crew members who are sentient digital clones of his Callister Inc. co-workers made from the Digital Clone Replicator that he has.  The episode Striking Vipers features two friends (portrayed by Anthony Mackie and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) starting to have sex in a virtual reality fighting game called \\"Striking Vipers X.\\" * In the fourth season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Leo Fitz created the Framework as a training program that was expanded into a virtual reality by Holden Radcliffe. When AIDA reworked the Framework, she created a virtual reality in it in where HYDRA ruled the world. After AIDA concluded her plan by creating a real body for herself, she arranged for the Framework to be deleted as its virtual inhabitants are slowly deleted. In season five, a possible future involving a broken Earth and the Kree ruling the Lighthouse had Deke Shaw rebooting the Framework allowing the Lighthouse's inhabitants to use it for leisure in exchange for currency. In season six, the Framework technology was used by a time-displaced Deke Shaw to create the virtual reality game \\"Remorath Rumble\\" that was produced by his unnamed tech company. \\"Remorath Rumble\\" enables the players to aid Quake in fighting the invading Kree and Remorath soldiers as well as flying a Confederacy Destroyer Ship. * In the fifth season of Supergirl, Andrea Rojas' company Obsidian Tech started to develop the Obsidian Lenses that enabled the users to enter virtual reality. Though this was secretly a plot by Leviathan to secretly trap them in virtual reality. Leviathan's plot was thwarted by Supergirl and Lena Luthor. Radio * In 2009, BBC Radio 7 broadcast Planet B, a science-fiction drama set in a virtual world. Planet B was the largest ever commission for an original drama programme.

Created by writer Kieron Gillen and artist Salvador Larroca, she first appeared in Marvel Comics' 2015 Star Wars: Darth Vader comic book series. Aphra became a breakout character, and began appearing in her own comic series, Star Wars: Doctor Aphra, in December 2016. She is a morally questionable, criminal archaeologist initially in the employ of Darth Vader, but later in hiding from him. Aphra is the first original Star Wars character not from the films to lead a Marvel comic series. Character Doctor Aphra is a criminal archaeologist with an expert knowledge of droid and weapons technologies, with a particular interest in ancient weapons and Jedi artifacts. She travels in a unique starship called the Ark Angel, which features a custom white-and-blue paint job. StarWars.com described Aphra as \\"a (mostly) morally bankrupt, in-over-her-head archaeologist\\", and Slate called her \\"driven, selfish, decisive, and wildly unpredictable\\". SyFy Wire called the character an anti-hero who \\"shares the snark of Han Solo and sexual charisma of Lando Calrissian, but toes the line between right and wrong far more regularly than these two characters—and more often than not steps over it into the downright naughty.\\" IGN explained, \\"Aphra has all of Han's swaggery, scoundrel-y charm, but little of his noble streak.\\" Creator Kieron Gillen noted that the character's main interest is \\"this weird obsession she has with uncovering old stuff\\". Noting that \\"Aphra's sarcasm and the careful way she codes her words are a vital part of her character\\", StarWars.com also explains that though she is somewhat of a genius, Aphra's ability to think on her toes is what has kept her alive in situations where her genius fails her. Gillen noted that readers can never be sure what the character will or will not do. Doctor Aphra writer Si Spurrier explained that despite the expectation that Star Wars characters \\"will always do the right thing\\", Aphra makes mistakes and sometimes chooses the unexpected. Sarah Kuhn, the author of Doctor Aphra: An Audiobook Original, agreed that \\"[Aphra] is the definition of chaos ... You never really know exactly what she's going to do, which means that, personally, I think she's having the most fun of anyone in the Star Wars galaxy.\\" In creating the character, Gillen looked to what he called \\"The Indiana Jones archaeologist archetype\\", which he believed fit well into Star Wars. His original concept for Aphra was Indiana Jones and his ramshackle problem solving, but with inverted ethics. He said that Aphra falls somewhere between a hero and a villain in that \\"You do see her do good things and bad things.\\" Gillen added, \\"She's kind of fun but at the same time, there's a really dark heart to her.\\" He explained, \\"She has this very fun-loving attitude, she's very fun to be around, but she's really bad as a person.\\" He added: Spurrier said, \\"She knows that Vader is probably not a nice person. She's aware that space fascism is not necessarily a good thing but it may be the right thing for a chaotic universe\\". Gillen compared Aphra to Darth Vader in that fans root for both as anti-heroes, but explained that while Aphra is a \\"bad person in many ways\\", Vader is on another level as \\"one of the greatest villains of all time.\\" Gillen added, \\"you can root [for her], because she makes really bad life decisions and sort of rolls with them ... She doesn't like killing people. She's not like a random murderer.\\" He noted that Aphra is complex in that she is \\"adamantly pro-Empire\\" but still tends not to obey the Empire's rules. SyFy Wire described Aphra as a \\"queer woman of color\\", noting her affinity for women and slightly Asian appearance. Slate agreed that the character is \\"drawn with a suggestion of Asian heritage\\", and also noted, \\"She aches for two different women who have claims to her heart—two women whom, inevitably, she must betray to survive.\\" Gillen confirmed Aphra's sexuality, saying he has written her primarily romantically interested in women rather than men, but noted that \\"Star Wars doesn't really have the terminology that we do ... homophobia as we know it doesn't really exist in the Star Wars universe\\". Of Aphra's relationship with Magna Tolvan, Gillen said he imagined \\"This hard-bitten, kind of very serious kind of person chasing down this more whimsical person and the sexual tension ... the flip of it is, Aphra's the person who's also pursuing Tolvan.\\" Appearances =Comics= Darth Vader (2015–2016) Aphra first appeared in Star Wars: Darth Vader #3 (March 2015), which is set after the original Star Wars film and was created by writer Kieron Gillen and artist Salvador Larroca. Aphra's appearance in the comic is being adapted as an audiobook for release on July 21, 2020. In the story, she is recruited by Darth Vader to aid in his schemes. At the end of the series Vader attempts to kill Aphra, but she escapes, leaving him thinking he succeeded. Gillen said of the story: From 2015 to 2016, Aphra appeared in Star Wars: Vader Down, a six-issue crossover comic miniseries which includes its own debut issue, issues #13–15 of Darth Vader, and issues #13–14 of the Star Wars comic series. Concurrent with the Darth Vader series, in 2016 Aphra also appeared in the Rebel Jail arc of the Star Wars comic, which comprises Star Wars issues #16–19. Doctor Aphra (2016–2019) After first being teased in September 2016 as Star Wars: Classified, Star Wars: Doctor Aphra was announced in October 2016, and began to be released in December 2016. The story picks up after Vader's attempt to kill Aphra at the end of the Darth Vader series. She is in hiding so that Vader will not discover that she is alive, but needs to get back into her life as an archaeologist so she can repay her enormous debts to the Wookiee Black Krrsantan, and fulfill her promise to help locate the people who tortured him in the past. Gillen said he wanted to write the series to explore \\"what makes her tick and why she's doing what she's doing\\". Gillen wrote issues #1 to #13, and then cowrote #14 to #19 with Simon Spurrier. Spurrier took over for a departing Gillen as of #20. Larroca and Kev Walker shared the artwork for issue #1, with Walker doing it alone for #2 and #3, followed by Walker and various other artists rotating in and out of the series. According to Spurrier: The series was nominated for Outstanding Comic Book at the 30th GLAAD Media Awards. Alan Scherstuhl of Slate wrote of the series, \\"The stories, like Death Stars, tend to explode, but unpredictably so, with escalating twists, striking moral quandaries, and only occasionally anything like a truly happy ending.\\" He explains, \\"Besides the vigorous storytelling and startling twists, the Doctor Aphra comics ... fill in shades of gray that are otherwise missing from Star Wars moral spectrum.\\" Jesse Schedeen of IGN called Doctor Aphra \\"Marvel's riskiest Star Wars project to date\\", but noted that \\"the distance from the movies gives Doctor Aphra a greater sense of freedom in terms of tone, style and plot possibilities.\\" Schedeen described the series as \\"very much like a Bizarro Han Solo story with a dash of Indiana Jones thrown in\\", and noted that it \\"thrives on its dark sense of humor.\\" In 2017, Aphra appeared in the five-issue crossover miniseries The Screaming Citadel, which is made up of its own debut issue, issues #31–32 of Star Wars, and issues #7–8 of Doctor Aphra. The initial Doctor Aphra series ended in December 2019 with issue #40. She is also the main subject of in the short comic \\"Epilogue\\", collected in the Empire Ascendant one-shot comic, which is in turn collected in the thirteenth volume of Marvel's Star Wars series. In 2020, the series won a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book. Doctor Aphra (2020) Doctor Aphra relaunched in 2020, and is set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The first issue was scheduled for April, but all Marvel titles were delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first issue was instead released digitally on May 3 (in recognition of Star Wars Day) and was physically released on May 27. =Audiobook= An expanded audiobook adaptation of Aphra's introduction in the Darth Vader series, titled Doctor Aphra: An Audiobook Original, was released on July 21, 2020. Written by Sarah Kuhn, the audio drama added new scenes and featured a full voice cast. =Short story= \\"The Trigger\\" (2017) \\"The Trigger\\" is a short story written by Gillen, published in the 2017 Star Wars anthology From a Certain Point of View. Set during the 1977 Star Wars film on the day that the Empire destroys the planet Alderaan with the Death Star, the story finds Aphra captured by Imperial troops and reacting to the news of Alderaan's destruction. Slate noted: Gillen said he wrote the story with the intent of \\"working out a fairly logical reason, why with her background, she thinks the Empire is bad to the alternative. If you grew up in a galactic civil war, I think peace by any means might be better than war. That's kind of Aphra's take. Aphra can handle everything. She lies to herself. But normal people? Normal people would probably like to live under a fascist regime rather than actually people just killing each other in a war. And that's a really dark hole to think about but I can buy someone believing that with Aphra's background.\\" =Video game= Doctor Aphra is a playable character in the defunct 2017 player versus player real-time strategy mobile game, Star Wars: Force Arena. Relationships =Mentorship tree= Impact and reception Increased sales of Darth Vader #3 convinced Gillen of Doctor Aphra's instant popularity, and he called the character \\"a big part\\" of the unexpected success of the Darth Vader series. Aphra became a breakout character, and was placed in her own series, Doctor Aphra, which is the first ongoing Marvel Star Wars comic focused on an original character not from the films. Gillen said in April 2018, \\"[Doctor Aphra] was the number two trade in February. A completely new character selling that well is shocking in comics. That kind of response is enormously impressive, as it doesn't happen often.\\" He added, \\"Sal[vador Larroca] and I cooked her up but enough people have written her now to make [her] bigger than me. She definitely feels like she's outgrown me, essentially. So I quite like giving her away to other people who'll get to play with her.\\" Aphra has also become a popular cosplay. Gillen said of Aphra's popularity: Spurrier added: Trent Moore of SyFy Wire deemed Aphra \\"arguably the best thing\\" about the Darth Vader series, and Catrina Dennis of StarWars.com called her \\"the type of character that steals every scene she's in.\\" Hanna Flint of SyFy Wire described Aphra \\"an edgy, cool and refreshingly diverse character\\", and Bria Lavorgna of StarWars.com called her \\"one of the coolest characters in Star Wars right now.\\" Noting that Aphra's first appearance was an homage to Indiana Jones, Alan Scherstuhl of Slate said that she subsequently \\"gains a depth that Indiana Jones never quite did\\", and praised the fact that Gillen has \\"never exploited or exoticized her sexuality.\\" Citing Aphra's \\"feats of technological prowess coupled with her unpredictable personality\\" as the characteristics which \\"make her a character worth watching\\", Dennis wrote, \\"Aphra has stolen the hearts of fans everywhere with her unpredictable humor and a complicated backstory that has unfolded into something much more than her introduction to the saga may have let on.\\" Merchandising In 2018, Hasbro released an action figure set of Doctor Aphra and her two killer droids, 0-0-0 and BT-1.

It is part of the Amazon biome. The ecoregion is home to a vegetation adapted to floods of up to that may last for eight months. There is a great variety of fish and birds, but relatively fewer mammals. Ground-dwelling mammals must migrate to higher ground during the flood season. Threats include logging, cattle farming, over-fishing and mercury pollution from gold mining. Location The Purus várzea is a low- lying region of the central Amazon basin that is seasonally flooded. It covers of eastern Colombia and western Brazil. It extends along most of the Juruá, central Purus, and Caquetá (Japurá) rivers and their tributaries. In the east it reaches the confluence of the Japurá and Solimões Rivers. Urban centers in or around the region are Tefé, Tabatinga and Carauarí. To the southeast the varzea adjoins the Purus-Madeira moist forests, and to the northeast it adjoins the Japurá-Solimões-Negro moist forests. Streams that flow through the Southwest Amazon moist forests, Solimões-Japurá moist forests and Caqueta moist forests to the west, and the Juruá-Purus moist forests in the central region all contain stretches of the varzea. The Monte Alegre várzea is downstream along the Solimões. Physical Altitudes range from . The forests are seasonally flooded by whitewater rivers, which carry suspended sediment washed from the eastern slopes of the Andes and organic material. Water levels rise by up to in the flood period, which may last for eight months of the year. The soil is fertile, composed of sediments that have accumulated in the present Holocene epoch and that are renewed by the annual floods. The river course through the floodplain constantly shifts over time, creating oxbow lakes, levees, meander swales and bars. These landscape elements support diverse vegetation adapted to flooding, which gradually merges into the surrounding terra firme forest. Ecology The ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. =Climate= The Köppen climate classification is \\"Af\\": equatorial, fully humid. Average temperatures range from , with a mean temperature of . Average annual precipitation is about . Rain falls throughout the year, but is heaviest in January–March and lightest in July–August. =Flora= Japurá River The floodplain holds aquatic vegetation where drainage is poor, successional vegetation, forest mosaics and permanent swamp vegetation. The várzea forests holds more species than várzea on the lower Amazon, but fewer species than in the surrounding terra firme forests. The forest is continuous. The rich understory includes plants of the families Zingiberaceae, Marantaceae and Heliconiaceae. Economically valuable timber trees include Carapa guianensis, Iryanthera surinamensis, Ceiba pentandra and Calycophyllum spruceanum. On the upper levees the most common trees are Ceiba pentandra, Hura crepitans and Parinari excelsa. On the lower levees common trees include Pterocarpus santalinoides, Eschweilera albiflora, Piranhea trifoliata and Neoxythece elegans. The lowest areas contain abundant bamboo (Bambusa species), and pioneer trees that include Cecropia species, Pseudobombax munguba, many Ficus species and the Astrocaryum jauari palm. There are relatively few palms compared to the terra firme forests. Other palm species include Astrocaryum murumuru, Mauritia flexuosa and Bactris species including the endemic Bactris tefensis. Trees that support fruit-eating fish that enter the forest in the flood period include yellow mombim (Spondias mombim), jauari palm (Astrocaryum jauari), biribá (Rollinia deliciosa), tarumã (Vitex cymosa), and apui (Ficus species). The largest tree in the várzea is Ceiba pentandra. Other typical várzea trees are Parkia inundabilis, Septotheca tessmannii, Coumarouna micrantha, Ceiba burchellii, Ochroma lagopus and Manilkara inundata. Flooded forests hold Virola surinamensis and Euterpe oleracea. =Fauna= The endemic black squirrel monkey (Saimiri vanzolinii) 199 species of mammals are found in the region, fewer than in the surrounding terra firme forests. There are no ground-dwelling species in flooded várzea forests isolated from the mainland, but areas of várzea in contact with terra firme forests house ground-dwelling mammals that migrate to higher ground in the flood periods. There are two endemic primates in the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve, the bald uakari (Cacajao calvus) and black squirrel monkey (Saimiri vanzolinii). The reserve is also home to white-footed saki (Pithecia albicans), emperor tamarin (Saguinus imperator), moustached tamarin (Saguinus mystax), Nancy Ma's night monkey (Aotus nancymaae) and Hershkovitz's titi (Callicebus dubius). Other mammals include white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), common agouti (Dasyprocta genus), lowland paca (Cuniculus paca), jaguar (Panthera onca), capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), spiny tree-rat (genus Echimys) and the Ega long-tongued bat (Scleronycteris ega). Aquatic mammals include the Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis) and Amazonian manatee' (Trichechus inunguis). Endangered mammals include the white-bellied spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth), Peruvian spider monkey (Ateles chamek), white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus), Marinkelle's sword-nosed bat (Lonchorhina marinkellei) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). 633 bird species have been reported. These include many aquatic species such as heron and egret (genera Egretta and Ardea), whistling duck (Dendrocygna species), ibis (Cercibis and Theristicus species) and roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja). Endangered birds include wattled curassow (Crax globulosa) and green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster). The very large green anaconda (Eunectes murinus) is found in the várzea. Other reptiles include black caiman (Melanosuchus niger) and spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus). The ecoregion is home to the endangered Johnson's horned treefrog (Hemiphractus johnsoni). Large fruit-eating fish that enter the forest during the flood period include pacu (genera Metynnis and Mylossoma), tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), pirarucu (Arapaima gigas) and sardinha (Triportheus angulatus). Other fish include piranha (Serrasalmus species) and decorative fish from whitewater rivers and their blackwater tributaries and lakes such as blue discus (Symphysodon aequifasciatus), cichlids (genus Cichlasoma), characins (family Anostomidae), tetras (genera Hemigrammus and Hyphessobrycon), and catfish (families Aspredinidae, Callichthyidae, Doradidae and Loricariidae). =Status= According to the World Wildlife Fund the status of the ecoregion is Critical/Endangered. Smallholders along the rivers undertake mixed agriculture, forest exploitation, small-scale logging and livestock raising. In some areas the várzea forest is threatened by large- scale logging and cattle farming. Fish populations are threatened by large- scale fishing operations and may be threatened by excessive collection of aquarium fish such as the red discus (Symphysodon discus). Gold mining contaminates the Purus and Japurá with mercury. Conservation units in the region include the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve, Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve and Jaú National Park.

She photographs the daily lives of girls and women in the Middle East and in the United States, including Syrian refugees.  Early life  Matar was born and raised in Lebanon and moved to the U.S. in 1984. Originally trained as an architect at the American University of Beirut and at Cornell University, she later studied photography at the New England School of Photography and the Maine Photographic Workshops. Since 2009 she has taught photographic workshops for teenage girls in Lebanon’s refugee camps. She now teaches at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design and exhibits her work worldwide.  Career  Matar has made several series of photographs, including L'Enfant Femme, Unspoken Conversations, Women Coming of Age, A Girl and Her Room, Invisible Children, and Ordinary Lives. Her portraits explore gender studies and often consider varying national identities. L'Enfant Femme depicts preteen girls living in the United States and the Middle East, and focuses on documenting the age between childhood and maturity. Mothers and daughters are photographed together and present a universal nature of womanhood in the series Unspoken Conversations. Matar began her series Invisible Children after a visit to Beirut in 2014. She noticed how many Syrian refugee children were on the streets begging for work and money. This series documents the individuality of each child. In 2017, Matar's work was included in the Biennale of the Contemporary Arab World held in Paris at the Arab World Institute.

He graduated from the École Normale Supérieure, where he was mentored by Louis Althusser. He earned the agrégation in Philosophy in 1965. Tosel joined the Maoist Internationalist Movement during the May 1968 events. He was awarded a PhD in Philosophy in 1982.

He was a member of the Société française de philosophie. In his research, Tosel was a critic of consumerism. He argued that capitalism was inherently violent as it rested upon servitude and poverty through debt. He argued in favour of emancipation from the \\"passive revolution\\" of globalised capitalism through resistance, or the advocacy of workers rights, feminism, postcolonialism, multiculturalism, and the rejection of neo-colonialism. According to philosopher Yvon Quiniou, Tosel played a critical role in disseminating Marxist theories in academic circles. Personal life, death and tributes Tosel was married with children. He was a member of the French Communist Party from 1972 to 1984, and he re-joined the party in 2012, when he became associated with the Left Front. Tosel died on 14 March 2017 in Nice.

A March 2017 photograph of him sitting on his bed, smoking a pipe and listening to his wind-up record player in a rubble-strewn room has been widely reproduced. Early life Anis studied medicine in Zaragoza, Spain, in the 1970s. His father was a wealthy textile dye entrepreneur.\\"Aleppo automotive lover goals to revive his ´wounded´ classics  World\\", Laalo.net. Career In the 1970s, he was employed in Italy translating Fiat car manuals into Arabic. Later he went back to Syria and opened a cosmetics factory called \\"Mila Robinson\\". Car collection Anis states that his fascination with classic cars goes back to the 1950 Pontiac that his father drove, and which Anis still owns. His first purchase was a 1947 Plymouth. His collection now includes dozens of cars from the 1940s and 1950s, and prior to the Syrian Civil War, he had hoped to open a museum in Syria. His favourite among his collection is a 1947 Cadillac convertible, now badly damaged, that he bought in a 2005 auction. He maintains that \\"no car collection is complete without at least one Cadillac\\", and his collection also includes a VW Thing, a 1955 Buick Super, a 1949 Hudson Commodore, a 1957 Mercury Montclair, a 1958 Chevrolet Apache, a cargo-van bodied Citroen 2CV, a 1947 Plymouth, as well as other vintage Buicks and Cadillacs. Anis's collection of classic cars reached some 30 vehicles, but has slowly dwindled during the war. In January 2016, he had 24 vintage cars, having lost six to shelling. To prevent theft of the cars, he removes the steering wheels and seats. During the conflict, his neighbours stopped rebels who wanted to mount an anti-aircraft gun on a 1958 Chevrolet. He had to leave Aleppo for a time at the height of the Battle of Aleppo, and when he returned only 13 cars were left (including his 1947 Cadillac convertible, now badly damaged), seven having been impounded by the Syrian police, and 10 either missing or destroyed in the war. In March 2017, Anis estimated that altogether, one-third of the collection had been either destroyed or stolen. He says, \\"When one of my cars is hit, it's as if I or one of my relatives has been hit. It's as if they were my children, so I come down to check on them\\". Personal life Anis lives alone in the formerly rebel-held neighbourhood of al-Shaar in Aleppo, his family having fled due to the war. He has eight children with two wives, one in Aleppo, the other in Hama, and would like to leave his cars to his children, two to every boy, one to every girl. He speaks five languages, and likes to smoke a pipe while listening to classical music, and to Syrian singers such as Mohamed Dia al-Din.

Shutt was notably one of the first women to start a software business not only in the United States but the entire world. Early life and education Elsie Shutt was born in New York City and grew up in Baltimore, Maryland. After her father died when she was four, her mother worked as a chemistry technician at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Shutt attended Eastern High School in Baltimore and graduated with an undergraduate degree at age 20 from Goucher College, from which her mother had also graduated with a degree in chemistry. Shutt went on to complete a graduate fellowship at Radcliffe College in mathematics. She became the second ever female teaching fellow after Lisl Novak Gaal. Shutt also taught remedial trigonometry to Harvard students, the first female graduate student to do so. Following this, Shutt was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to teach English in France Career = Early Years = Shutt learned to program on ENIAC successor ORDVAC (Ordnance Discrete Variable Automatic Computer) under Dick Clippinger during a summer job at U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. In 1953 Shutt was hired at Raytheon (an aerospace and defense manufacturing company) by her old boss, Dick Clippinger. There, she started work on software for the Raycom computer. When she became pregnant in 1957, Massachusetts state law required her to quit Raytheon. However, Raytheon began to refer Shutt to their clients because the company was scaling back its outside programming projects. Shutt began doing freelance programming work from her home. This work was done for over a year with her friend Irma Wyman. Shutt eventually decided to pursue the entrepreneurial venture of starting a business that would give women part time work in this technical field, an opportunity that was nonexistent before. = Computations Incorporated = Shutt founded Computations Incorporated (CompInc) in 1957 as a primarily all-female company in the early era when software companies worked part time from homes as freelancers.Schafer, Valérie, and Benjamin G. Thierry. Connecting Women. Springer, 2015.(p.x)Shirley, Steve. \\"II. THE DISTRIBUTED OFFICE.\\" Journal of the Royal Society of Arts 135.5371 (1987): 503-514. CompInc, a Harvard, Massachusetts based company, utilized systems analysis and design along with programming help for both the business and scientific industries. Early employees, Elaine Kamowitz and Barbara Wade, who previously worked as freelancers before being incorporated, also bore children. Shutt reportedly refused to hire more than 13 staff members and lead the company for more than 45 years. At the time, it was highly unusual for pregnant women to continue in their professional endeavors, leading some to dub Shutt and her employees \\"the pregnant programmers.\\" She began CompInc to prove that women could still hold programming occupations while taking care of a family—having a baby did not detract from their technical expertise. Shutt employed preferential hiring of young women with little children. She hoped that by doing this she would increase a woman's chance of getting a full time job as a programmer once her children grew up. Even women with no experience were hired because there was a training program in place. CompInc's employees were mainly women with a few men, but all the partners were women. The company's primary clients were the United States government and the science, education, and business industries. Computations, Inc. also emphasized “desk-checking” between employees (manually checking each other’s code), and clients claimed they saved as much as 50% by outsourcing to Shutt’s company. At its peak, her company entered into contracts with Minneapolis-Honeywell, Raytheon, St. Regis Paper Co., Harvard University, The University of Rochester, and the United States Air Force. = Personal Life = Shutt had the support of her husband, both emotionally, financially, and domestically, and even hired a babysitter to work every Wednesday, so she could offer that day without having to tell the client she’d have to look for a sitter. She enjoyed the days with her children and would rent computer time from companies during “non-prime times” who wanted to keep their computers on in the evening.

It began airing on September 28, 2017, with 15 episodes like the previous seasons and concluded on March 15, 2018. This was made in a deal with Viola Davis that the series would be a limited series with only 15 or 16 episodes per season. Plot Annalise (Viola Davis) and the Keating Four are still dealing with the aftermath of Wes's (Alfred Enoch) death. Annalise works with a therapist, Dr. Isaac Roa, to see through her recovery from alcoholism, and cuts ties with her associates. Connor (Jack Falahee) declines Oliver's (Conrad Ricamora) proposal, Laurel (Karla Souza) expects Wes's baby, Michaela (Aja Naomi King) and Asher (Matt McGorry) team up for internships, and Bonnie (Liza Weil) seeks her professional future. Laurel deduces that her father, Jorge Castillo (Esai Morales), is responsible for Wes's murder and hatches a scheme to steal incriminating evidence with Michaela, Oliver, and a reluctant Frank and Asher. During the data heist, classmate Simon Drake (Behzad Dabu) accidentally shoots himself with Laurel's gun, leading to Asher's arrest, and Laurel goes into premature labor after being accidentally struck by Frank. Though Annalise successfully saves the baby, Jorge takes custody of the child while Laurel is in the hospital.

Liza Weil plays Bonnie Winterbottom, who is an associate attorney in Annalise's firm. Conrad Ricamora portrays Oliver Hampton, a hacker who is in a relationship with Connor. In July 2017, Jimmy Smits was cast in an unspecified role. He plays Dr. Isaac Roa, Annalise's court-requested therapist. In August, Davis' husband, Julius Tennon, was confirmed to guest star. He plays Desmond, a man who flirts with Annalise during a flight. In September 2017, Natalie Abrams of EW.com revealed that D. W. Moffett was cast as Connor's father. In January 2018, it was announced that Lolita Davidovich would recur in the second half of the season. She plays the role of Sandrine Castillo, Laurel's mother. =Scandal crossover= On January 3, 2018, Scandal star Kerry Washington tweeted a photo to Viola Davis of herself in a \\"familiar\\" setting, that being a courthouse used for the set of How to Get Away with Murder. Fans began to speculate a possible crossover episode being in the works, which was only heightened when Davis tweeted out a photo in response, that being her on the set of Mellie Grant's (Bellamy Young) Oval Office. Later that day, the crossover was officially confirmed through a tweet by Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes. How to Get Away with Murder creator Peter Nowalk later went on to share in an interview with Deadline: Reception =Critical response= The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the season a 100% approval rating, with an average rating of 7.9/10 based on 8 reviews. Maureen Lee Lenker of EW gave the premiere a B letter rating. Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya, writing for The A.V. Club, rated the premiere a A−, commenting, \\"It's a strange but ultimately satisfying premiere, standing out from the show's past premieres by going the slow character drama route rather than murder party.\\" Ali Barthwell of Vulture rated the premiere a 4 out of 5 stars, glorifying Viola Davis' performance. Meghan De Maria of Refinery29 also praised Davis' acting, naming it the \\"glue that holds the series together\\". =Ratings= References External links 2017 American television seasons 2018 American television seasons Season 4 ","title":"How to Get Away with Murder (season 4)"},{"id":"53496877","title":"All I Wanna Do Is Dance"},{"id":"53496902","text":"The Four Great Men of Kokugaku (國學の四大人, Kokugaku no shitaijin or Kokugaku no shiushi) are a group of Edo-period Japanese scholars recognized as the most significant figures in the Kokugaku tradition of Japanese philology, religious studies, and philosophy.

Note the talcum powder/rubbing alcohol lubricant mixture applied around the top perimeter of the enclosure, to prevent ants from escaping. Ant-keeping (or Ant Keeping) is a hobby involving the capture, care, and observation of ants and ant colonies. History Keeping ants as pets has been a common hobby since the mass- marketed Uncle Milton's Ant Farm achieved commercial success in the late 1950s, though these ant farms did not include a queen ant for legal reasons. U.S. Federal law prohibits shipping live queen ants (And other “plant pests”.) in interstate commerce, though the species Pogonomyrmex occidentalis is not subject to these regulations as of August 9th, 2019. Reasons for Ant- keeping Ant keepers may choose to keep ants in captivity for the purpose of documenting ant behavior (in the case of an ant species which is difficult to observe in the wild). This field of study is called Myrmecology. Ant keepers may also choose to keep ants as a casual hobby; i.e., as pets. People who keep ants may also keep them for scientific purposes and experiments. Starting a colony There are differing methods of starting, caring for, and housing an ant colony. In the United States queen ants can be bought from vendors provided that the seller is from your state and that the species purchased is also native to your state. If you are in the UK or in any other European country, most exotic species of ant can be purchased legally through vendors though it depends on local laws. =Locating a queen ant= The first step involved in ant keeping is capturing a fertilized queen ant. Ants engage in nuptial flights during spring and summer, and after these flights a fertilized queen ant will land and remove her wings before locating a spot to found her new colony. If a queen has already chewed her wings off, she is likely (but not certainly) fertilized. If a queen ant on the ground still has her wings, she is likely unfertilized. A queen ant can be distinguished from a worker ant by the relatively larger size of the thorax (which at this point contains the wing muscles of the queen), and the enlarged abdomen which contains eggs. Beware that certain species have large workers similar in size to a queen, if the possible queen you are looking at has marks on either side of the thorax (Wing scars, where the wings of the queen were) it is a queen. If not, it's a supermajor; a larger worker of the colony. =Housing the queen ant= For fully claustral species, the queen should be sealed in a dark, aerated small container with access to water. One way to provide this environment involves using a test tube, some water, and two cotton balls. One cotton ball is pressed against the water, the queen is inserted, and the other cotton ball is used to plug the end of the tube. This nesting chamber should be kept in the dark for one month while the queen lays her eggs and tends to them until they hatch. A claustral ant species need not be fed during this period, as a queen ant will digest her now-useless wing muscles to provide her with the necessary energy until her first generation of workers emerges. But feeding a small drop of honey energises the queen ant and reduces the chances of her eating her own eggs. For a semi-claustral species, which will require food during this nesting phase, protein rich foods should be provided intermittently during the pre-worker phase, with the frequency and type of food determined by the specific species of ant. =Moving the ants into a larger housing= Camponotus nearcticus workers traveling between two formicaria through a connector tube. If successful with feeding the first generation of workers, the queen ant should continue laying eggs. Eventually (at about 25 worker ants), the colony should be moved into a larger housing such as a formicarium to allow continued growth of the colony. If you wish to put your ants into a setup before this 'worker limit', you may purchase a 'test tube outworld' which will allow them to be fed more easily, while still inside the test tube.  Caring for ants  = Dietary needs = An ant's diet should consist primarily of sugars/carbohydrates (such as fruit, sugar water, raw honey, or honeydew) and proteins (such as mealworms, cockroaches, or bits of egg). The sugars are necessary to provide the ants with energy, and the proteins are necessary for the growth of the colony. Uneaten food should be removed to prevent the growth of mold in the formicarium. = Environmental needs = Besides the obvious need of a formicarium and outworld (A separate container, often decorated to resemble the outside world, in which the ants forage for food.), ants require certain conditions to thrive. For one, almost all ants, save for a few twig nesting species, will not survive without a source of humidity in their nest. This can be accomplished in many ways; some nests are made of a naturally absorbent material, such as plaster, some contain a sponge or cotton ball which is watered when need be, and others still contain a reservoir of water which evaporates over time. Most ants also appreciate a heat source; as ants are cold blooded, their colonies develop faster the warmer their nest is. A heating cable is the preferred method of many antkeepers, but heat lamps, heating pads, and un-air conditioned rooms are all worthy alternatives. Many antkeepers keep their ants in a dark area to avoid stressing them (Ants usually live underground and flee from light in their nest, which would indicate a breach.), though most species become desensitized to light after being exposed to it frequently. While light-aversion can be a useful tool when moving colonies to new habitats, the benefits of having ants both indifferent to observation and more easily monitored far outweighs this, especially when more effective alternatives, such as physical disturbance to or partial disassembly of the formicarium exist.  Laws on keeping ants  The legality of intentionally shipping reproductive ants (usually a mated queen or whole colony) across state, provincial, or international borders varies substantially by country. In the United States, it is illegal to ship live queen ants across state lines without a license or explicit permission from relevant state or federal entities. As of 2019, however, at least one species (Pogonomyrmex occidentalis) is legal to ship within the United States, with the exception of Alaska, California, Florida, and Hawaii. In Europe, some domestic species (such as Formica rufa) are protected, and it is illegal to own, keep, buy, or sell these ants, or to damage their nests. However, unlike for reptiles and spiders, there are no rules for owning, keeping, buying or selling non-protected species inside the EU and many other countries. In popular culture Over the years Ant Keeping has become more normalised through the internet. Ants Canada and Ants Australia are both some of the key influencers in Ant Keeping Culture. They have together helped society think of ant keeping as a normal hobby and not one to be afraid of.

Similar to other strains of Polynesian dogs, it was introduced to the Marquesas by the ancestors of the Polynesian people during their migrations. Serving as a tribal totems and religious symbols, they were sometimes consumed as meat although less frequently than in other parts of the Pacific because of their scarcity. These native dogs are thought to have become extinct before the arrival of Europeans, who did not record their presence on the islands. Petroglyphic representations of dogs and the archaeological remains of dog bones and burials are the only evidence that the breed ever existed. Modern dog population on the island are the descendants of foreign breeds later reintroduced in the 19th century as companions for European settlers. Linguistic Map of the Marquesas Islands There are two words in the Marquesan language for dog: peto, used in the Northern Marquesas, and nuhe, used in the Southern Marquesas. The former might have been an English loanword from pet or a Spanish loanword from perro (dog), although pero was an alternative for dog (kurī) in the related Māori language. According to another theory supporting its foreign origin, the name came from a New Haven dog named Pato left on Nuku Hiva by the American sea captain Edmund Fanning from 1798 to 1803. The South Marquesan Nuhe is unique in the Polynesian languages, but may have some connection to wanuhe, the word for dog in the Papuan language of the Brumer Islands. French Catholic missionary René- Ildefonse Dordillon listed two other forms: mohoʻio and mohokio in his 1904 dictionary Grammaire et dictionnaire de la langue des iles Marquises. History Little is known about the Marquesan Dog. They were introduced to the Marquesan Islands by the original Polynesian settlers along with domesticated chickens, pigs, and the Polynesian rat. The dog is thought to have become extinct prior to the arrival of Spanish explorers in 1595, although some might have survived beyond this point. No European accounts were ever written about them. They were thought to be fairly rare and \\"never numerous in the islands\\" even before the arrival of Europeans. Unlike in other parts of Polynesia, dogs were not considered an important food source, although they were sometimes eaten as shown by the presence of cut marks on dog bones found in archaeological excavations. Due to their rarity, they were venerated by the Marquesans and were closely associated with the high chiefs and priestly classes. Many petroglyphs or carved images of dogs were found near religious centers and chiefly residential areas indicating their venerated status and importance in the culture. A survey by American archaeologist Sidsel N. Millerstrom noted that a majority of dog petroglyphs have been found in the valleys of ʻAʻakapa, Haʻatuatua, and Hatiheu on the northern coast of Nuku Hiva, the meʻae Vaikivi on Ua Huka, and the meʻae Iʻipona and Eiaone Valley on Hiva Oa. Their regional distributions possibly reflected the role of dogs as symbols of tribal/clan loyalty and identity in the islands. They were totem animals associated with the Nakiʻi tribe. Characteristics Petroglyphs often depict the Marquesan Dog in exaggerated forms. Millerstrom noted that these representations deviated from the typical characteristics of the Polynesian dog and wondered if they were meant to be realistic. She stated: > The Marquesan dogs' images show that the necks and the bodies are > exaggerated in length. The tails are long and curved over the back while the > ears and muzzle may be pointed, square or rounded. The legs are short and in > one case from Hatiheu Valley the paws were pointed in the wrong direction... > The early post-contact dog is white or spotted, small to medium size, with > pointed snout and ears, and a long tail. Could the Marquesans of the past > have forgotten what the dog looked like or did it matter how they depicted > the dog? Archaeological evidence =Stone carvings= German archaeologist Karl von den Steinen was the first European visitor to observe evidence of ancient dogs in the Marquesas in 1897–98. In his excavation of meʻae Iʻipona, a temple complex near the village of Puamaʻu on the northeastern coast of the island of Hiva Oa, he uncovered several stone tiki including two with zoomorphic (animal shaped) quadruped figures carved on them. During this period, the property and temple site was owned by Reverend James Kekela, a Hawaiian Protestant missionary, who von den Steinen befriended. He also relied on an elderly Marquesan named Pihua, who was the only living person who knew the names of the tiki at the site. Opferkopf Manuiotaa, currently at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin Tiki Makiʻi Tauʻa Pepe at Iʻipona Measuring high, and in diameter, the first tiki was a megalithic stone head representing an unknown ʻupoko heʻaka \\"sacrificial victim\\". Von den Steinen named it Opferkopf Manuiotaa (\\"Sacrificial Head Manuiotaa\\"), after the famous 18th-century Marquesan sculptor Manuiotaʻa from the Nakiʻi tribe, who is believed to have carved both statues and many other tikis on the site. The head bore totem motifs of quadrupeds and little stick figures representing the Marquesans etua (gods) tattooed on each side of its mouth. He was informed that the quadrupeds could depict either dogs, rats or pigs. However, he concluded they were rats since at the time, dogs were believed to have been introduced by Europeans. He transported the head back to Germany where it is now displayed at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. The second statue was named Tiki Makiʻi Tauʻa Pepe after Manuiotaʻa's wife, known as Tauʻa Pepe (the \\"Butterfly Priestess\\"); she reportedly died in childbirth with Makiʻi meaning \\"writhing in agony\\". There are disagreements if the statue should be set in the reclining position as it was discovered or the prone position as it is currently displayed. It is believed to represent a female in a prone position, head and arms reaching skyward, giving birth, although it has also been interpreted as a female deity bearing the Marquesan people on its back. Images of quadrupeds were carved as bas-reliefs on each side of the square base of this statue. This tiki remained in its original spot and is visible today at the site of Iʻipona. Only one of the dog carving is discernible now; the other one has weathered away. In 1956, Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl later claimed the reliefs on Tiki Makiʻi Tauʻa Pepe were llamas or pumas instead to bolster his theory that Polynesia was settled from South America. Later unidentified writers and rumors have insinuated that Heyerdahl deliberately altered and defaced the images in his process of restoring them. The modern consensus is that the carvings represent the extinct dog; they do not represent llamas, pumas or rats. =Bones and burials= In 1956, Robert Carl Suggs, with the American Museum of Natural History, led the first stratigraphical excavation of the islands and uncovered many dog bone fragments and one dog burial across a few sites on the island of Nuku Hiva. Between 1964 and 1965, American archaeologist Yosihiko H. Sinoto, with the Bishop Museum, discovered a drilled dog canine used as a pendant, one pre-molar and two dog burials in the sand dunes at Hane on the island of Ua Huka. In 1998, American archaeologist Barry Vladimir Rolett discovered dog bones in all levels of settlement at Hanamiai, on the island of Tahuata, indicating that the breed may have continued to exist on this island until the mid-19th century. Some of these bones had visible cut marks. In 2000, French archaeologist Pascal Sellier discovered three dog skeletons alongside several human burials at Manihina, Ua Huka; one dog was buried in a coffin. Millerstrom summarized these earlier findings and personally analyzed many of the petroglyphs of dogs left by the prehistoric Polynesians in her 2003 paper \\"Facts and Fantasies: the Archaeology of the Marquesan Dog\\". She noted that further research needs to be done on the linguistic evidence tracing the movement of dogs within Oceania, the socio- economic roles of dog in Marquesan and Oceanian cultures, and a study into the morphology of the bones and dog burials found in the Marquesan archaeology sites. Reintroduction of dogs Dogs of different breeds were later reintroduced by European settlers and visitors to the Marquesas. The first European dogs seen were those that accompanied Spanish explorers Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira and Pedro Fernandes de Queirós in 1595. While they were on Hiva Oa, the Marquesans attempted to steal one of the small dogs on their ships. Anthropologist Katharine Luomala noted that nothing suggested that these dogs were left by the Spanish. Possibly the first dogs reintroduced were those left by American ships during the early 1800s in the care of early beachcombers, missionaries and settlers who kept them as pets. One of the first reported cases was a New Haven dog named Pato, who had been \\"found guilty of sheep stealing about the year 1797 and was banished for the above crime\\". Around 1798, Captain Edmund Fanning left him on Nuku Hiva in the care of British missionary William Pascoe Crook who left him with a local ruler Keattonnue (i.e. King Cato), but on June 8, 1803, another American Captain Brinell recalled Pato and replaced him with two other dogs. During the Nuku Hiva Campaign of 1813, United States Naval Captain David Porter reported a few dogs on the island and observed the islanders were afraid of the two mastiffs on board his ship. Paul Gauguin's 1902 probable depiction of the Marquesan swamphen being killed by a dog. By the 1890s, English traveler Frederick William Christian noted the ideological conflict over dog meat consumption as island populations increased. He noted how the Marquesans living in the eastern valleys of the island of Hiva Oa had resumed eating baked dog meat \\"with delight\\" while the inhabitants of the western valleys \\"will barely touch [dog meat] even in times of famine\\". Christian also observed dog being eaten on Tahuata and Fatu Hiva. French artist Paul Gauguin depicted scenes including dogs in the Marquesas in several works while he lived on Hiva Oa. His 1902 painting Le sorcier d'Hiva-Oa ou Le Marquisien à la cape rouge possibly depicts a dog killing the now-extinct Marquesas swamphen (Porphyrio paepae). In Herman Melville's 1846 semi-fictionalized work, Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life, the narrator Tommo gives an unflattering account of dogs living in the valley of Tai Pī on Nuku Hiva: > I Think I must enlighten the reader a little about the natural history of > the valley. Whence, in the name of Count Buffon and Baron Cuvier, came those > dogs that I saw in Typee? Dogs!—Big hairless rats rather; all with smooth, > shining, speckled hides—fat sides, and very disagreeable faces. Whence could > they have come? That they were not the indigenous production of the region, > I am firmly convinced. Indeed they seemed aware of their being interlopers, > looking fairly ashamed, and always trying to hide themselves in some dark > corner. It was plain enough they did not feel at home in the vale—that they > wished themselves well out of it, and back to the ugly country from which > they must have come. Scurvy curs! they were my abhorrence; I should have > liked nothing better than to have been the death of every one of them. In > fact, on one occasion, I intimated the propriety of a canine crusade to > Mehevi; but the benevolent king would not consent to it.

The freebore is the cyan colored section just ahead of the neck. In firearms, freebore (also free-bore, free bore, or throat) is the forward most portion of the chamber of a rifled gun barrel. The freebore is located just forward of the chamber neck and is usually cylindrical in shape. The diameter of the freebore is always larger than the groove diameter of the gun barrel bore so that no rifling is present and projectiles used in the firearm can move in the freebore without resistance. Location and dimensions Closeup of chamber throat depicting relationship between freebore diameter, rifling groove diameter, and land diameter. The chamber is the rearmost portion of a firearm barrel that has been formed to accept a specific cartridge or shell. For firearms having a rifled barrel, the bullet typically extends forward from the leading edge of the cartridge. The portion of the barrel forward of the chamber that provides clearance for the loaded bullet of a cartridge is known as the throat. The throat is composed of both a freebore and a leade. The freebore is typically slightly larger in diameter than the rifling grooves in order to allow the cartridge to be loaded into the chamber without the resistance. The leade is the tapered section of the throat that transitions in diameter from the freebore to the rifling lands at a small angle, typically between 1 and 3 degrees. Freebore length affects the distance the bullet will jump before engaging the rifling when the weapon is fired. Greater freebore length permits bullets to extend further out of the cartridge case to increase space for propellant within the case. Increasing freebore length in order to increase bullet jump is used to delay the onset of resistance from friction and deformation that results when the bullet engages the rifling. Dimensions of freebore length and diameter may gradually increase as hot gas wears the interior barrel surface each time the weapon is fired.

The film stars Michael Caine, Katie Holmes, Odeya Rush, Seth Green, and Jason Biggs. The plot follows a sixteen-year-old American girl who becomes the pen pal of a notorious island nation dictator even when he is deposed. Plot The Vincent regime's flag Tatiana Mills (Odeya Rush), a fifteen-year-old American girl, lives a quasi-chaotic alone with her single mother Darlene (Katie Holmes), who is in a complex romantic relationship with her married boss Dr Charles (Seth Green) who is a dentist with a foot fetish. Tatiana becomes pen pals with Anton Vincent (Michael Caine), a notorious island nation dictator. When Vincent is deposed by his own people, who rise up against his violent and oppressive rule, he disappears, causing Tatiana to worry about his safety. A few days later, he unexpectedly arrives in the United States and seeks refuge in Tatiana's suburban garage. There, he develops a grandfatherly relationship with the teen and her struggling mother, becoming a useful man around the house whilst organising his restoration as leader with loyalist forces back in his unnamed homeland. Anton shifts his focus to Tatiana's high school life and her desire to deliver payback to the popular girls that pick on her. He makes her a dictator-in- training and teaches her to rise to power in her school in a similar way to his ascent to power in the Caribbean. Ultimately his plans go too far, putting her at odds with Tatiana, who also comes under investigation from the security services who have picked up on Anton's communication with his loyalist forces and suspect she is involved with terrorism. The police interview both Tatiana and Darlene and search the house, blissfully unaware that the old man in the house is Anton Vincent - whose whereabouts is unknown. No evidence is found and they are released, but upon release Tatiana informs the police that the old man is Vincent and he is arrested pending extradition.

The 850-foot-long artwork depicts the location of a pre-colonial shoreline by graphically etching silhouettes of materials that are found typically along the high tide line. The artwork offers a way to engage the imagination in an exploration of the changes to this now urban site from a salty tidal marsh, to an active pedestrian plaza. Background The shoreline and topography of Boston, Massachusetts, as it was from 1630–1675, overlaid on an 1880 street map The public plaza the artwork is located on was historically one of the first Boston Harbor landing places, named Town Dock. When the dock, and adjacent sections of the harbor were filled to create new land during the late 17th century, the area became known as Dock Square. The shoreline marking project and artwork details were developed in consultation with the Boston Art Commission, the office of the Boston City Archeologist, and the Boston Landmarks Commission. Plans and construction documents for the artwork are based on research of historic maps from the Norman B. Leventhal Map Center collection, and writings of historian Nancy Seasholes. The entire shoreline surrounding the original land mass of Boston has been repeatedly filled in and modified, starting in the early 17th century, through a process known as wharfing out. The A Once and Future Shoreline artwork presents one section of that pre-colonial shoreline to the public in an actively used downtown location. Geographic coordinates = Design details The estimated position of the pre-colonial shoreline edge at high tide is cut into granite using hand-made stencils of high-tide line debris, including: sea grass; Bladder Wrack seaweed; skate egg casings; quahog shells; Blue Mussels; feathers; sea cucumber; Sea Robin; rock crabs; pieces of old rope. In addition to the shoreline etching, the plaza paving pattern presents an overlay from an 1820 map of the area, depicting an historical street layout in grey granite block, and the building plot locations from the same time period marked with etched dash lines and a shift to pink granite paving blocks. The A Once and Future Shoreline artwork is adjacent to the relocated 19th c. sculpture of Samuel Adams by Anne Whitney Geological context The public plaza land area where the sculpture is located, in what is now known as downtown Boston, is inland from the location of the ocean's edge 5000 years ago. At that time early native people occupied low grassy plains and forest covered hills that today are under the water of Boston Harbor. The placement of this now land-locked shoreline marking may indicate the shoreline again in the future due to the impact of rising ocean levels as a consequence of global climate change  References  External links * Boston Art Commission Walking Tour * Boston History * Boston Mapjunction Over 200 historical maps since 1630 and aerial photos compared with Maps of Today * City of Boston Archaeology - Program and Lab Public art in Massachusetts Cultural history of Boston Landmarks in Boston Boston National Historical Park Seashells in art ","title":"A Once and Future Shoreline"},{"id":"53497378","text":"Alf's Baby, also known as Her Three Bachelors, is a 1953 British comedy film directed by Maclean Rogers and starring Jerry Desmonde, Pauline Stroud and Olive Sloane.Chibnall & MacFarlane p.103 It was made by ACT Films, and released as a second feature.

He was a citizen of the United States, and was noted for having been one of few Native Americans to vote Republican in the Presidential election of 1856, as most voted Democrat out of fear of the government. He is regarded as the most documented Odawa Indian of his time, due to his relation as the son-in-law of Rev. George Smith, the personal diaries of whom currently reside in the Library of Congress. Personal life Wolfe was born about 1833. His father was Nayan Miengun (Wolfe) and his mother, Charlotte Waukazoo, also known as Kin-ne-quay, was the daughter of a war chief and sister of both Peter and Joseph Waukazoo. Peter Waukzoo and Reverend George Nelson Smith founded the town of Waukazooville, renamed Northport, Michigan in 1854. Wolfe attended the village school in Northport, and was fluent in both the Odawa and English languages. He was married on July 29, 1851 to Mary Jane Smith, the 15-year-old daughter of Reverend George Smith. Smith performed the services for his daughters wedding, and kept an account of the event in his personal diary. Payson and Mary Jane lived on a farm in Northport overlooking Grand Traverse Bay and raised thirteen children, born between 1852 and 1874. The experience at Andersonville left Wolfe at merely 60 pounds, and with a permanent disability of his left arm caused by a bout of scurvy.DeLand, James S. Affidavit on the Pension File of Payson Wolfe. August 8, 1866. Wolfe fell into bad habits as a result of lasting physical and psychological effects of the war, which greatly strained his relationship with Mary Jane. He moved from Northport to Cross Village in 1878, and divorced Mary Jane in 1879. Wolfe received a pension in September 1869 for the injuries he suffered at Andersonville.Certificate # 78,903, Name of Pensioner: Wolf, Payson, Post Office Address: Cross Village, Cause for which pensioned: loss use 1[eft] hand & arm, Date of Org. Allowance: Sept. 1869 -from the 1883 Census of Michigan Pensioners. He died on December 7, 1900, and is buried at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Cross Village, Michigan. Military service In March 1863, a state bounty act allowed for Native Americans to receive the same benefits as white men who enlisted to fight in the Civil War. A recruiting drive was led through the northern half of Michigan to assemble Native Americans to join a company of sharpshooters. Wolfe, already the father of six children, enlisted on August 3, 1863 in Northport and mustered in at Dearborn, Michigan on August 8, 1863. He was a member of Company K of the 1st Regiment Michigan Volunteer Sharpshooters, and fought with the regiment during Grant's Overland Campaign. Wolfe was a skilled shooter, and would often fill baskets with birds that he shot out of the sky to feed his family. With Company K, Wolfe fought at the Battle of the Wilderness, Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, Battle of Cold Harbor, and Petersburg. He was captured late on June 17, 1864, after his brigade was ordered to support a charge on Confederate earthworks near the Shand House during the Second Battle of Petersburg.Reports of Brig. Gen. James H. Ledlie, U. S. Army, commanding First Division, of operations June 17 and July 30. After he was captured, Wolfe spent 3 weeks at Libby Prison in Richmond before spending 5 months at the infamous Andersonville Prison in Georgia. Conditions at Andersonville were brutal; prisoners often went up to 4 days without food, and slept in the open, exposed to the elements, Wolfe being no exception.Smith, George N. December 20, 1864. Diary Entry. George Nelson Smith journals and letters, 1840-1879, Library of Congress. He told his father-in- law stories of how men had been forced to eat boiled rice with maggots, and that the food was so scarcely available that many had to eat the vomit of others who could not stomach it in order to survive.Smith, George N. December 30, 1864. Diary Entry. George Nelson Smith journals and letters, 1840-1879, Library of Congress. Wolfe was finally released in August 1864, as part of an offer made by the Confederacy to return sick and wounded Union prisoners. He was one of only 8 men out of the 15 from Company K to survive his time at Andersonville. Following his release, Wolfe spent time in Northport to recuperate, returned to service with the other surviving members of Company K on December 2, 1864. He was discharged from service as a paroled prisoner on June 13, 1865. References Further reading * Czopek, Chris.

They are classified as girls when they are born but, around the age of 12, they start developing male genitalia. This is due to a deficiency in the production of 5α-reductase, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of testosterone.  Early research  The first scientific investigations of the güevedoces occurred in the 1970s, when Dr. Julianne Imperato-McGinley, an endocrinologist from Cornell University traveled to the village of Salinas (population 4300) in the Dominican Republic to investigate reports of apparently female children becoming male children at the onset of puberty. The cause was determined to be 5α-Reductase deficiency, and the results were published in the journal Science in 1974. The frequency of the deficiency was found to be unusually high in Salinas, with occurrence ratio of 1 guevedoce to every 90 unaffected males.

History Weeds have existed since humans began settled agriculture have existed since the advent of settled agriculture around 10,000 years ago it is been suggested that the most common characteristic of the ancestors of our presently dominant crop plants is their willingness—their tendency to be successful, to thrive, in disturbed habitats, mostly those around human dwellings. Farmers have likely always been aware of weeds in their crops, although the evidence for their awareness and concern is nearly all anecdotal. Unlike other agricultural sciences like entomology or plant pathology, the emergence of weed science is comparatively recent, occurring largely within the 20th century and coinciding with the development of herbicides. Weeds are controlled in much of the world by hand (roguing) or with crude hoes. The size of a farmer's holding and yield per unit area are limited by several things and paramount among them is the rapidity with which a family can weed its crops. More human labor may be expended to weed crops than on any other single human enterprise, and most of that labor is expended by women. Weed control in the Western world and other developed areas of the world is done by sophisticated machines and by substituting chemical energy (herbicides) for mechanical and human energy. There is a relationship between the way farmers control weeds and the ability of a nation to feed its people. Successful weed management is one of the essential ingredients to maintain and increase food production. In 1923, Clark and Fletcher suggested that the \\"annual losses due to the occurrence of pernicious weeds on farm land in Canada, although acknowledged in a general way, are far greater than is realized.\\" Clark, G.H. and J. Fletcher. Farm weeds of Canada. Second edition. Revised and enlarged by G. H. Clark first published in 1909. Reprinted by Canada Department of Agriculture. Ottawa, Canada They thought this was because \\"farmers gave little critical attention to the weeds growing among their crops.\\" They did not deny that farmers were aware of the weeds only that they could do little about them. Many of the same weeds described by Clark and Fletcher are shown in most current weed identification books. In spite of continued research to mitigate weeds annually many of the same species continue to be problematic. The first U.S. Congressional appropriation for weed control was made in 1901 for work on control of johnsongrass, 23 years after Congress had appropriated funds for work on cotton insect pests. Petroleum-based herbicides were first used on California crop land in 1924 and soon became widely accepted in Southwestern states. In 1942, oils were used extensively for weed control in carrots and subsequently were used in forest nurseries. French scientists sprayed apple trees with dinitro dyes to control mosses, algae, and lichens. Some noticed that grasses that were wet from the spray did not die and that observation, or, more likely, a series of observations, led to the use of dinitros as herbicides for selective control of broadleaved weeds in cereals and flax. Sinox (sodium dinitro cresylate) was developed by Pastac in 1933. Pastac, I. 1973. Les colorants nitres et leurs applications particulieres. J. De al Hutte Chemique Contre les Ennemis das Cultures. 38:4. It was the first selective organic herbicide introduced in the US. From the early 1930s until about 1945, it was used extensively in grains, clover hay, grass seed crops, peas, cane berries, onions, and lawns. Timmons, writing in 1970 reported that \\"available literature indicates that relatively few agricultural leaders and farmers became interested in weeds as a problem before 1200 A.D. or even before 1500 A.D.\\" Timmons, F.L. 1970. A history of weed control in the United States and Canada. Weed Science 18:294-307. Republished Weed Science 53:748-761. 2005 The “critical attention” Clark and Fletcher thought was absent increased slowly, primarily because the general attitude seemed to be that “weeds were a curse which must be endured, and about which little could be done except by methods which were incidental to crop production, and by laborious supplemental hand methods.\\" Jethro Tull, in 1731, appealed for greater attention to weeds: > It is needless to go about to compute the value of the damage weeds do, > since all experienced husbandmen know it to be very great, and would > unanimously agree to extirpate their whole race as entirely as in England > they have done the wolves, though much more innocent and less rapacious than > weeds. Farmers however were bound by their inability to do much about weeds except by laborious hand methods. Insects cause both human health and crop problems. Weeds, with a few exceptions, do not cause direct harm to humans. Those that do such as poison ivy and poison oak can be avoided. Poisonous weeds have never been widespread as a weed of crops nor of great concern to the majority of people. Many weeds aggravated human allergies but many did not and other common plants are also allergenic. Insects and insecticides were respectively causes of and solutions to human disease problems. Weeds and herbicides were not and less attention was paid to them. Weeds and herbicides were agricultural problems. They were not of general societal concern. There were a few scientists interested in the study of weeds and in developing techniques to reduce the crop losses caused by weeds. There were only three full-time weed experts in 1934 and only a few part-time ones. By late 1951, 46 state agricultural experiment stations had active weed research programs and most of them were working on weed control with herbicides. Now all colleges of agriculture in land-grant universities have weed scientists and a well- developed weed management program. Weed science has been strongly influenced by herbicides and mechanical technology developed by supporting industries, by research by weed scientists, and, ultimately, used by farmers. Herbicides greatly expanded the opportunities and range of methods for vegetation management and weed control. The definition accepted by the Weed Science Society of America (WSSA) is “A chemical substance or cultured biological organism used to kill or suppress the growth of plants.” Weed scientists have tended to focus on results and progress. Modern agriculture in the world's developed nations has addressed but not eliminated most weed problems through extensive use of herbicides and the more recent development of herbicide resistant crops through genetic modification. These methods while undeniably successful for their intended purpose also have created environmental, non- target species, and human health problems. Farmers in the world's developing nations use some herbicides but newer herbicides and the necessary application technology are often unavailable or too expensive. Weeds are always present in these farmer's fields but often the most available, affordable control methods are mechanical weeding, usually with animal power, or by hand, and most of the labor is provided by women. Neither the hypothesis that more energy is expended for the weeding man's crops than for any other single human task nor the corollary hypothesis that women do most of the world's weeding has been verified, but they are widely accepted.  Objectives of Weed Science  = Management of particularly troublesome weeds = While any plant can be a weed, approximately 250 plant species are sufficiently troublesome, cosmopolitan and economically injurious to warrant targeted research into their biology to assist in their management and control. Examples of some of these troublesome weed species in North America are Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson), common lambsquarter (Chenopodium album L.), horseweed (Erigeron canadensis L.), morningglory (Ipomoea spp.), waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus (Moq.) J. D. Sauer) and common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.). Some weed science researchers provide extension resources for farmers and land managers by trialing a variety of weed control tools and tactics on a specific weed, publishing the results and providing recommendations for their future management. Other researchers may study the biology of weed seeds in order to determine how long weed seeds can remain viable in a soil. Much of this research is conducted at public land-grant universities. = Herbicide application and interaction = Another aspect of weed science research is concerned with generating knowledge about the active ingredients of herbicides. Specifically, evaluating the response of weeds and crops to different combinations of herbicides at varying rates, droplet sizes, and environmental conditions within different cropping systems containing different weed communities. Some herbicides become more effective when mixed together (syngerism), while other herbicide combinations reduce the overall control (antagonism). Some weed science researchers trial a variety of herbicides applications and combinations on weeds to evaluate their impact on the weeds and crops. Most of this research is conducted by private companies. = Herbicide fate and action = Another aspect of weed science is concerned with how herbicides move in the environment after they are applied. Some herbicides degrade very quickly in sunlight and can be made inactive before entering the plant while others can persist for years in the soil after they are applied, causing problems for future crops. Registering herbicides can cost hundreds of millions of dollars in order to demonstrate how the chemical moves and degrades within the environment it is applied . Most of this research is conducted by private companies in order to be able to register their products for sale.

Career  As a member of Them (on keyboards) he recorded and toured with Van Morrison behind hit records \\"Baby, Please Don't Go\\", \\"Gloria\\" and \\"Here Comes the Night\\"; sharing stages with The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who and The Kinks. Later when Van Morrison went solo, McAuley joined Paul Brady in Dublin band, The Kult. Moving back to London he formed The Belfast Gypsies, recording just one album Them Belfast Gypsies, which was produced by Kim Fowley. The album is hailed as one of the rawest and most powerful to emerge during the 1960s R&B; boom. McAuleys psych-folk duo Trader Horne, with ex Fairport Convention singer Judy Dyble also only released one album Morning Way in 1970. The album, much played by BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel at the time, has been re-released seven times since. Through the 1970s and beyond, McAuley recorded and worked with artists such as Viv Stanshall of the Bonzo Dog Do Da Band to Clodagh Rodgers, Jamaican reggae group The Heptones, Rick Wakeman and also as musical director with Lonnie Donegan on guitar and fiddle. In 1982, his songwriting came to fruition when he and John Gustafson of Roxy Music penned the hit song, \\"Dear John\\", for Status Quo. Meanwhile they formed Rowdy with Billy Bremner (The Pretenders) and Les Binks (Judas Priest). In the late 1980s, McAuley led for several years the critically acclaimed Celtic rock outfit Poor Mouth, recording the album Gael Force. After an accident almost severing his finger, McAuley during recovery began to write more solo driven material. Since breaking up the band in the 1990s, he has released several well reviewed albums under his own name. Recently McAuley and Dyble reformed Trader Horne for a one-off London gig, which was awarded four stars in a review in The Times. And his songwriting was recognised once again in the Hollywood movies Humble Pie, American Fork (William Baldwin) and Stranger Things (Winona Ryder).

Built by Denver philanthropist Helen Bonfils in memory of her parents, Frederick Gilmer Bonfils and Belle Barton Bonfils, it staged plays, operas, concerts, films, lectures, and television shows, presenting more than 400 productions. In 1985 it was renamed the Lowenstein Theatre in honor of its longtime producer, Henry Lowenstein. The theatre closed in 1986 and sat vacant for two decades. It was purchased in 2005 by Charles Woolley of the St. Charles Town Company, which renovated and reopened the building in 2006 as a Tattered Cover bookstore. The theatre building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Location The theatre building is located at 1475 Elizabeth Street, on the southwest corner of East Colfax Avenue, in Northeast Denver. Description Theatre entrance The theatre was designed in Art Moderne style by Denver architect John K. Monroe. The one-story structure, covering , was faced in cream-colored brick and trimmed in buff-colored terra cotta and red sandstone. Below the \\"wing-swept\\" marquee, a contoured aluminum canopy overhung the entrance. Inside, the travertine lobby sported a \\"Prussian blue rug, wood-paneled walls, pumpkin-colored plaster, and tall windows\\". On one side of the lobby stood a shrine to the Abbey Theatre in England. The lower lobby and bar was accessed via a grand staircase. The theatre had seating for 550. Its Prussian-blue stage curtain was complemented by gray side walls and red carpeting. Backstage were nine dressing rooms. Monroe designed an electronic lighting switchboard – a \\"smaller version of the system used in New York City's Metropolitan Opera House\\" – to accommodate a variety of productions, including plays, operas, concerts, films, and lectures. The venue was also appropriate for use as a television studio. Helen Bonfils consulted with actor Raymond Burr on the theatre layout. Decades later, the Perry Mason TV movies starring Burr used the premises as a filming location between 1987 and 1989. History The Bonfils Memorial Theatre was built at a cost of $1.25 million by Helen Bonfils, a Denver philanthropist and owner of The Denver Post, in memory of her parents, Frederick Gilmer Bonfils and Belle Barton Bonfils. Bonfils designated the theatre as the new home for the University Civic Theatre, an amateur theatre which since 1929 had operated on the campus of the University of Denver. In 1942 Bonfils gifted a different site, at 1425 Cleveland Place, to the University Civic Theatre, but due to World War II the building could not be remodeled. In 1948 Bonfils acquired the property at 1425 Elizabeth Street and arranged for the removal of a ten-room house to make room for construction of a theatre, which she rented to the newly renamed Denver Civic Theatre for one dollar a year. With its opening on October 14, 1953, the Bonfils Memorial Theatre was the first live-performance theatre to open in Denver in four decades. It quickly became the \\"social center of the city\\", with opening nights presided over by Bonfils and attended by society figures. President Dwight D. Eisenhower dispatched a congratulatory telegram to Helen Bonfils upon the theatre's opening. The first production, Green Grow the Lilacs, was seen by an audience of 500. =Productions and performers= The theatre presented main stage, cabaret, and children's theatre. It staged more than 400 productions from 1953 to 1986. Performers at the Bonfils Memorial Theatre included John Ashton, Tony Church, and Cleo Parker Robinson. Celebrities who appeared in theatrical productions included Helen Bonfils (herself an actress and theatrical producer), Mary Jo Catlett, Julia Child (she gave a cooking demonstration), Kevin Kline, Patti LuPone, Ted Shackelford, David Ogden Stiers, Marilyn Van Derbur (Miss Colorado 1957 and Miss America 1958), Joan Van Ark, Emlyn Williams, and Paul Winfield. Bonfils lent her extensive collection of \\"fur coats, jewels, silver, furniture, and rugs\\" as props for many productions. During the summers, the theatre sent a \\"summer festival caravan\\" around to city parks to entertain audiences, and presented a free outdoor musical in Cheesman Park. Henry Lowenstein, hired as a set designer in 1956, became the theatrical producer in 1967. In 1985 the theatre was renamed the Lowenstein Theatre in his honor. =Closure= The theatre remained open for more than a decade after Helen Bonfils' death in 1972. In 1973 the Denver Civic Theatre moved to the Denver Center for the Performing Arts (DCPA), and in 1974 the Bonfils Memorial Theatre came under the jurisdiction of the governing board of the DCPA, which had been formed from Bonfils' estate. The board continued to operate the Bonfils Memorial Theatre as a community theatre, but in 1984, as professional theatre gained popularity at the DCPA, the board closed the main stage. The cabaret and children's shows continued to be staged until 1986, when the board closed the theatre permanently. Renovation Tattered Cover bookstore in the former theatre; the orchestra pit is in the foreground The theatre sat vacant for two decades. In May 2005 Charles Woolley of the St. Charles Town Company purchased the property from the Bonfils Foundation for $1.9 million. The development company undertook a $16 million preservation and renovation project to convert the theatre into a bookstore and add a record shop, art cinema, and 230-space parking garage to the adjoining lot. In June 2006 the theatre building reopened as a Tattered Cover bookstore. While few changes were made to the exterior, the sloped flooring of the theatre had to be leveled and the interior redesigned for retail trade. The redesign, executed by architect Josh Comfort, retained many \\"historical details and finishes\\"; for example, some original red mohair-covered seats were retained in two rear balcony areas, and the original orchestra pit, accessed via a ramp, was filled with a display of \\"books on the performing arts\\". The backstage dressing rooms, rehearsal area, and offices made way for a restaurant and coffee shop. The development company received the 2006 Community Preservation Award from Historic Denver for the project. The theatre building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

The album, which consists solely of music from the label's catalogue, displays the happy gabba or \\"popcore\\" sound that had emerged from Dutch underground raves during the mid-1990s and had partly started to reach mainstream success, such was the case with the album's lead single \\"I Wanna Be a Hippy\\" by Technohead. Upon its release, the album received critical acclaim for its upbeat, manic tone and happy spirit. Robert Christgau named it the 53rd best album of 1997, and, as an example of its acclaim had continued over years, Rolling Stone named it the 30th greatest EDM album ever in 2012. Background Dutch dance music record label Mokum Records was founded in 1993 by Freddy B.CNRRecodsUK.co.uk News 16-01-04. Accessed: November 26, 2006 Originally releasing intense gabba music, such a \\"I'll Show You My Gun\\" by Annihilator, the label eventually started to release the lighthearted, \\"hilariously giddy\\" tone of happy gabba music over the ensuing two to three years. Happy gabba, and its darker originator gabba, have been described as taking \\"the sound of Dutch Nineties skinheads who liked their drugs speedy and their music even speedier.\\" The label described the happy gabba music it released as \\"popcore\\", and its releases were popular in Dutch underground raves being held in warehouses. After the label had seen international success with \\"I Wanna Be a Hippy\\" by Technohead in late 1995 and early 1996, the Make 'Em Mokum Crazy compilation album was conceived by Mokum in attempt to document their catalogue and how the \\"popcore\\" sound was transitioning from its underground origins \\"to the top of the Euro pop charts.\\" Music Technohead, pictured here in their Greater Than One days. The liner notes of Make 'Em Mokum Crazy describe the music as \\"hyper speed happy anthems\\" and \\"the new sound of popcore\\", further noting that the songs emerged from the \\"underground warehouse raves of Holland.\\" Music critic Robert Christgau described the music as \\"happy tunes\\" in \\"high registers that range from unnatural to very unnatural,\\" advising listeners to \\"apply the broad brush it deserves and call it The Chipmunks Go Techno.\\" Rolling Stone describe the album's happy gabber content as \\"hilariously giddy.\\" More broadly, the Babysue zine described the music as \\"goofy techno.\\" Technohead's \\"I Wanna Be a Hippy\\", which was an international hit earlier on in 1996, quotes David Peel with its lyrics and features the lyrics \\"I wanna get stoned – on thuuuh marijuana\\" yipped by \\"a maniacal sprite.\\" The song appears twice on the album, first in its original version and also with a remix by Ilsa Gold. Lollipop noted that the album \\"revolves around\\" the inclusion of \\"I Wanna Be a Hippy\\". Technohead also appear with the \\"Mobile Mecca Mix\\" of their song \\"Headsex\\" and with \\"Happy Birthday\\" which samples a Martin Luther King Jr. speech.\\" Party Animals appear with a recording of the traditional \\"Hava Nagila\\" and a \\"ride-the-lightning cover\\" of \\"Have You Never Been Mellow\\" by Olivia Newton-John. Release and reception Make 'Em Mokum Crazy was released in Holland by Mokum Records on 9 September 1996.

Modino Graphics are credited for the packaging's graphic design which features figure illustrations by Peter Conlon. The album was released to critical acclaim. Music zine Babysue described the music as \\"way upbeat and funny\\": \\"Techno bands take themselves way too seriously much of the time, but that's certainly not the case here. This almost sounds like techno/house music if it were combined with Saturday morning cartoons.\\" AllMusic rated the album four stars out of five. In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau rated the album \\"A–\\", indicating \\"the kind of garden-variety good record that is the great luxury of musical micromarketing and overproduction.\\" He praised the good-spirited \\"idiotic\\" nature of the album and said that the album was \\"intensely irritating, perversely delightful, and (trust me on this) just the thing for a 12-year-old's coming- out party.\\" He ranked the album at number 53 on the \\"Dean's List\\" of his favourite albums of 1997, curated for the annual Pazz & Jop critics' roll. Chuck Eddy of Spin magazine called the album \\"deliriously cute.\\" In his 1999 book Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture, Simon Reynolds cited Make 'Em Mokum Crazy as key happy gabba release.

On 7 December 1996, a CASA C-212 Aviocar registered as PK-VSO crashed onto a gas factory shortly after take off from Syamsudin Noor International Airport. 17 people, including one on the ground, died at the scene, 12-year-old child died on the way to the hospital while a worker died at the hospital. One passenger, identified as 40-year-old Irianto, was the only one who survived the crash. Official investigation determined that the crew lost control of the plane after its right engine malfunctioned. Flight The flight took off from Syamsudin Noor International Airport around 15:30 local time with 15 passengers and 2 crew members and was heading to Sampit, a city known for its strategic location and economy in South Kalimantan. The aircraft was piloted by Captain Herybert and was co-piloted by First Officer Sofyan Noor. Approximately one minute after take off, the right engine malfunctioned. The crew then reported to the tower, but instead of reporting the malfunctioning engine, the crew accidentally reported the other engine was working normally. The crew then stated that they would \\"return to base\\", but whilst making an emergency landing they lost control of the aircraft and it crashed through the rooftops of PT. Barox Utama Jaya, a factory producing oxygen tanks and acetylene. The crash site was located from the airport. 13 passengers and both crew members were killed. A factory worker was also killed and 3 others were injured due to the subsequent explosions. Two passengers of Flight 5940, identified as 40-year old Irianto and 12-year old Rusdiana survived the impact. Both were rushed to nearby hospitals. Rusdiana however succumbed to her injuries while on the way to the hospital. A worker, initially survived the crash in critical injuries, died due to the severity of his injuries. Passengers and crew The aircraft was carrying 15 passengers, including a 12-year-old child, and 2 crew members. Little is known about the crews' flying experience. The bodies were evacuated to Syamsudin Noor Hospital in Banjarmasin. The repatriation and identification progress were observed by the then South Kalimantan Governor Gusti Hanan Aman. The sole survivor was a 40-year-old man identified by authorities as Irianto. He suffered bone fractures and facial injuries and underwent a 4-hour surgery in Dr. Soeharsono Military Hospital. The surgery was conducted by Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Dedi Zamhuri from the nearby Indonesian Air Force Military Hospital. Investigation Immediately after the crash, the Indonesian Ministry of Transportation appointed the NTSC to conduct an investigation into the cause of the crash. As the plane was a produced both by the Indonesian IPTN and the Spanish CASA, they expected the Spanish investigation team to join and assist the NTSC. According to the ATC worker in Syamsudin Noor Airport, Captain Herybert had announced the engine failure and had stated his intentions to make an emergency landing. According to the Indonesian Transportation Minister, Haryanto Dhanutirto, the procedure the crew took was correct, and this claim was also correct. Observation on the crash site revealed that the plane's wreckage was heading towards the airport, meaning that the crew did attempt to return to the airport. =Response= In response to the crash, the Governor of South Kalimantan visited the survivor and the injured shortly after hearing the news. Indonesian Minister of Transportation Haryanto Dhanutirto visited the crash site. He, alongside with the South Kalimantan Governor, made a condolence statement to the families affected by the crash. Haryanto later added that the local government should make a regulation on industrial location around the airport and its risks. The insurance company told the media that there would be compensation for each passengers and crew members at Rp 40 million each person. They stated that they would only compensate the surviving passenger's hospital bill, up to a maximum of Rp 10 million. The insurance company, however, would not compensate the victims on the ground. The General Manager of PT. Barox Utama Jaya, Ranius, stated that he demanded a compensation from the airliner. He stated that his company suffered a Rp 500 million loss due to the crash, specifically a loss of a Fuso truck, an electrical generator, and the shutdown of the factory for three consecutive days. He later added that he would file a lawsuit if the airliner dismissed his demands. =Controversy= The CASA C-212 Aviocar was produced by the Spanish CASA and the Indonesian IPTN. The head of IPTN Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie claimed that the plane was \\"tough\\" in its class. For example, he noted the crash of a CASA C-212 in 1991 in Tihengo Mountain when the plane flew onto a tree and became stuck. Habibie stated that the plane didn't suffer any substantial damage. The same year a Pelita Air Service CASA C-212 crashed into the sea off Lampung. This crash later caused a public debate on the worthiness of the plane.

At the time of description A. dlusskyana was one of eight ant species known from Sakhalin fossil. History and classification A. dlusskyana is known from a single adult female fossil, the holotype, specimen number \\"PIN3387-172\\" which, at the time of the genus description, was residing in the Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, in Moscow. The described specimen is a worker caste adult preserved as an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Sakhalin amber. The amber specimen was recovered from deposits on Sakhalin island, in far eastern Russia during a 1972 collecting expedition. The expedition recovered amber from the beaches of the Okhotsk Sea at the mouth of the Naiba River and upstream on the banks of the river eroding out of exposures of Naibuchi Formation strata. Sakhalin amber has been attributed a range of geological ages, with Vladimir Zherikhin in 1978 suggesting dates between 59 and 47 million years old. In 1988, Gennady Dlussky suggested a tentative Paleocene age, which was followed by subsequent authors through 2013. Research published in 1999 on the Naibuchi Formation, in which Sakhalin amber is directly preserved, however, gives a Middle Eocene age based on geological and paleobotanical context. The Sakhalin amber forest had a variety of plants living in a mixed coastal swamp, river, and lake environment. The river and lake system had numerous swampy areas that resulted in active peat bog formation. The bogs were surrounded by Osmunda, Nymphaeaceae and Ericaceae plants, while Taxodium, Alnus, Salix, and other trees populated the forest. The amber fossil specimen was first studied by paleoentomologists A. G. Radchenko and E. E. Perkovsky of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, with their 2016 type description for the species being published in the Paleontological Journal. The species name was coined as a patronym honoring the Russian paleoentomologist and myrmecologist Gennady Dlussky, who had died in 2014. Radchenko and Perkovsky suggested in the description that A. dlusskyana was the oldest described Myrmicinae species belonging to a living genus of the subfamily. They noted older fossils are reported in the literature, but no detailed descriptions of the specimens have been published. Head of the A. dlusskyana holotype Head of the Aphaenogaster amphioceanica holotype A. dlusskyana has a pair of distinctive long spines near the rear of her propodeum that are not seen in any of the late Eocene European amber species, or in any Upper Eocene United States amber species. Workers of two amber species, Aphaenogaster amphioceanica from Miocene Dominican amber and Aphaenogaster praerelicta from Late Oligocene to Early Miocene Mexican Amber have similar spines. A. dlusskyana is separated from A. praerelicta in the shape of the spines, which widen near the base in A. praerelicta, in the more rounded petiole of the A. dlusskyana, and overall size, with A. praerelicta workers being more than longer. A. amphioceanica has a very elongated head that does not have distinct rear corners, rather the rear margin forms a \\"collar\\" shape, features not seen in the A. dlusskyana worker. Description The single worker of A. dlusskyana has a long body and a long head. The body has a number of long hairs scattered on it, with a large amount present on the upper surface of the gaster, while the tarsi have a dense covering of hairs that lie almost flat and curl upward at the tips. There is coarse parallel ridging running the length of the mesosoma, and the gaster, waist, and head are smooth with no surface sculpturing. The head is rectangular in outline, being 1.3 times as long as wide and with very slightly convex sides. The rear margin of the head also is slightly convex and the rear corners are \\"narrowly\\" rounded. Two lobes are well developed toward the front of the head, and partly cover the bases of the antennae and antennal sockets. The antennae are composed of 12 segments, each of the segments being elongated, and the last four at the tip forming a club. At the base, the scape is elongated and one third of its length projects past the rear edge of the head. On each of the triangular shaped mandibles, the inner chewing surface is 80 percent as long as the whole mandible length.

It operated in the Army Group Centre Rear Area, of the occupied regions of the Soviet Union behind Army Group Centre's front lines. Its duties included security of communications and supply lines, economic exploitation and combatting irregular fighters (partisans) in Wehrmacht's rear areas. The so-called anti-partisan operations in \\"bandit-infested\\" areas amounted to destruction of villages, plunder and enslavement of civilian population. In July 1942, the division took part in '\\"Operation Peter\\". The unit received specific instructions regarding the villages deemed \\"bandit-friendly\\" (those failing to meet agricultural quotas). The division was to appropriate livestock, deport the population for slave labour to Germany and burn the villages down.

It went into scheduled service on December 24, 1940. * Ship 41 went into service on January 19, 1941, flying from Atlanta to Ft. Worth, Texas. Delta Air Lines used the airplane for 17 years until 1958. Ship 41 was acquired by another airline in Delta’s family tree—North Central. North Central became part of Delta's history through its merger with Northwest Airlines in 2008. The aircraft then flew for a number of different airlines before finally being operated by Air Puerto Rico, a Puerto Rican cargo airline company. Restoration In 1990, a group of Delta retirees and enthusiasts located one of Delta's first five DC-3s in order to restore it to flying condition. Their investigation led them to \\"Ship 41\\", then flying as a cargo aircraft, registered N29PR for a local Puerto Rican airline, Air Puerto Rico. In 1993, Delta bought the aircraft from Air Puerto Rico and it was flown to Atlanta, where it underwent a five-year restoration and is now on display at the Delta Flight Museum. In 2000, Ship 41 won the EAA's AirVenture's Judges' Choice “Lindy” Award for outstanding restoration. In 2001, Ship 41 became the first aircraft to earn a National Trust for Historic Preservation award.

It was also released as a single off the album, backed with the more famous \\"The Shape I'm In\\" and, although it failed to reach the Top 40 in the United States, it peaked at #13 in the Netherlands. It has also been featured on several Band compilation and live albums. Lyrics and music On the surface, the lyrics of \\"Time to Kill\\" extoll the joy of country life, which the Band members had enjoyed prior to becoming famous. Music critic Barney Hoskyns states that the song sounds like a \\"celebration of the 'mountain hideaway' to which they'd at last returned,\\" and the lyrics explicitly reference the town Catskill in the Catskill Mountains, near Woodstock where the Band recorded The Basement Tapes with Bob Dylan. The music is also happy and upbeat. Steve Millward described the song as \\"a catchy medium-pacer.\\" Rolling Stone critic John Burks describes the music as having an old fashioned sound that a Kentucky moonshiner may have hummed to himself in the 1890s. Burks also describes Robertson's guitar intro to the song as sounding like 1956 rock 'n' roll and also sounding like \\"like tier of sound in motion.\\" The Band FAQ author Peter Asron notes that the song has an unusual rhyming structure, in which rhymes do not occur at regular intervals and sometimes appear to be out of sync with the song's meter. The happy lyrics and music belie the song's irony. Hoskyns notes that the song may just as easily be expressing the group's fear about how the world has encroached on their bucolic lifestyle since their first two albums made them famous. Aaron states that the music and title are misleading and that the real theme of the song is the danger of having too much idle time on one's hands. Allmusic critic William Ruhlmann similarly states that the song's theme is the \\"pitfalls of fortune and fame.\\" Something Else critic Nick DeRiso points out that around the time of the song's release the group in real life acted in accordance with the sentiments of the song, flying back to Woodstock by private plane when the opportunities arose during their concert tour. Burks notes that even the reference to Catskill may be a pun on a darker phrase \\"cats kill.\\" Rick Danko and Richard Manuel sing the lead vocal. Garth Hudson plays electric piano, in a style that DeRiso describes as sounding like coming from a \\"red light-district\\" and Hoskyns describes as \\"tinking.\\" Normal Band drummer, Levon Helm plays rhythm guitar on the song while Manuel takes the drums. Robertson plays lead guitar and Danko plays bass. Reception Hoskyns feels that this song plays it safe, describing it as \\"the most harmless piece of music the group had yet recorded as the Band.\\" Hoskyns does praise Hudson's piano, and the combination of Helms' \\"funky\\" rhythm guitar with Robertson's \\"piercing\\" guitar solo. DeRiso states that \\"Robertson’s guitar weaves in with a serrated economy, working in counterpoint to Levon Helm’s tough rhythm riffs.\\" Rolling Stone critic Dave Marsh described \\"Time to Kill\\" as one of the most notable \\"fine moments\\" from the Stage Fright album, along with \\"Stage Fright\\" and \\"The Shape I'm In.\\" Burks praised Robertson's guitar opening and described the song as \\"a controlled performance, if, paradoxically, a bashing one,\\" with \\"a complacent lyric\\" that he compared to Dylan's work at the time. \\"Time to Kill\\" peaked at #77 in the US on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked higher in Canada at #45. But it did much better in the Netherlands, reaching #13. Other appearances \\"Time to Kill\\" has been released on several of the Band's compilation albums, including the UK and Australian versions of The Best of the Band, Greatest Hits and A Musical History. The Band also played the song live in concert on several tours, including in 1970 and 1974. A live recording from 1971 was included on the 2001 CD release of Rock of Ages. That same recording was included on Live at Watkins Glen.

History The Congregational (or \\"Independent\\") Church in Adelaide had its beginnings in 1837 in a marquee erected by T. Q. Stow, then progressed to a pug and pine chapel on North Terrace, succeeded in November 1840 by a more substantial building on Freeman Street (later part of Gawler Place). In June 1851 a breakaway group led by William Peacock and I. J. Barclay founded their \\"Ebenezer Chapel\\" on land donated by Peacock off Rundle Street, near the old East Terrace Market. Revs. M. H. Hodge, of Port Adelaide, and George Stonehouse, of the Lefevre Terrace Baptist Church, North Adelaide took the first services before Rev. Joseph Haynes was appointed their pastor. Then came the rush to the Victorian goldfields, of which Haynes was a participant and the Ebenezer Chapel closed for fifteen months. In July 1853 Rev. John Hotham, recently arrived from England, reorganized the church. Two years later, Hotham took charge of the Port Elliot chapel, and his place was taken by Rev. Edward Dewhirst. A year later Dewhirst left to join the Baptist Church, and the British and Foreign Bible Society appointed Rev. F. W. Cox to take charge of the church. In the meantime Stow supervised both branches of the Congregational Church in Adelaide. Cox arrived in South Australia in 1857 and preached his first sermon at the Ebenezer Place (named for the chapel and not vice versa) chapel. Soon the little church (\\"obscurely situated in a dirty lane off Rundle street\\" — Rev. W. Harcus) was full to overflowing, and it was clear a larger chapel was called for. :A public meeting was held at White's Assembly Rooms, with William Peacock presiding over a gathering of 1,000 people. Vigorous addresses were delivered by the Hons. J. H. Barrow, Alexander Hay and Thomas Reynolds and Revs. William Butters, William Harcus, and Silas Mead of the Flinders Street Baptist Church, and as a result plans for a new building were soon under way. A block near the centre of the east side of Hindmarsh Square was purchased for £700 and in the first year the congregation raised £1,030 towards a new building, which was matched by Peacock. George Abbott (who also designed the first Clayton Congregational Church and the Flinders Street Presbyterian Church, died 3 April 1869) was the selected architect and English & Brown (also known for Chalmers/Scots Church) the builders. Abbott's design, described as \\"modified Byzantine\\", provided for a pair of steeples, which the committee decided to do without, as an economy measure.This was not unusual: the spire of St Peter's Cathedral, the \\"Victoria Tower\\" of the Adelaide GPO and the steeple of the Flinders Street Lutheran Church were built shorter than originally designed; the cathedral by some . The cornerstone was laid by Peacock on 21 August 1861 and new building, built to seat 450 and with its schoolroom and vestries completed a year later, cost £5,075. Extensive stabling was erected to the south of the building, which was to have been called the Ebenezer Congregational Church, but that was rarely observed, invariably being referred to by its location. The first service was held on Friday 5 September 1862, conducted by Revs. J. Jefferis and H. Cheetham. Hindmarsh Square Congregational Church, c. 1867 Compare with St. Saviour's Catholic Church, Port Road, Hindmarsh Rev. Cox preached his first sermon in the new church on Sunday 7 September 1862, assisted by Charles Manthorpe, and C. W. Evan, and was uninterruptedly associated with this church until 1897, and died eight years later. Rev. S. Lenton served the Hindmarsh Square Church from 1898 to 1904, when he transferred to Rose Park, and was followed by Henry Gainford, who shortly transferred to Carlton, Victoria, and was replaced by Joseph Thomas Huston (died 1953). =Later use= The building later became a \\"Protestant Hall\\", controlled by John Amos, and the subject of complex financial manoeuvering. The Australian Broadcasting Company (a commercial organisation) took over the building for the 5CL broadcast studio, from 1930 part of a national broadcasting network. This became the Adelaide studios of 5AN and 5CL for the Australian Broadcasting Commission (which later became the Australian Broadcasting Corporation). The church and its outbuildings became the orchestral studio and PMG technical workshops. The circular detail between the turrets was emblazoned with the callsigns \\"5AN\\" and \\"5CL\\" and lightning bolt motifs. The stables were demolished for a complex of ABC studios and other facilities. The broadcast studios and facilities joined the TV studios at Collinswood in 1974. What remained of the original Church building was demolished in the 1980s. Nothing now remains of these structures.

He has won a number of martial arts awards.  Biography  Luttrell has lived his whole live in New Mexico. He wrestled on the varsity team all four years at Manzano High School in Albuquerque. Throughout his teenage and young adult years, Luttrell trained in judo, which is how he met and befriended Mike Winkeljohn. Winkeljohn recruited him to start working with his kickboxing students, to teach them grappling skills, and in exchange he received instruction in various forms of striking (kickboxing, boxing, Muay Thai.) It was also through his judo classes that he met one of Greg Jackson's students and eventually Jackson himself, later introducing Jackson to Winklejohn. He went to college at University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, where he obtained his bachelor's degree in criminal justice.  Career  = Criminal justice = He served in the Bernalillo County Sheriff's department as a reserve deputy from 1995 to 2000 and then accepted a position with the New Mexico State Police.

Chris introduced Mike Winkeljohn to Greg Jackson and eventually talked Greg into converting his self defense gym into an MMA gym. They then needed to develop a system that they thought had the most effective, fight proven techniques. Luttrell did this by traveling the country as a flight attendant, finding every fight gym or serious martial arts dojo and requesting to train for a night. Chris trained with everyone from Royce Gracie and Pat Militech to Megaton Diaz with whom he had epic roll at his academy. City by city, as his travels took him, he trained, learned, and recorded, Chris would return to his hotel and take notes in a journal on every technique he'd learned at each academy and bring it back to Albuquerque. These techniques would then be tested in the gym, in the bars, streets, and wherever was necessary to verify the legitimacy of the technique and what didn't work was discarded. When cage matches or Vale Tudo matches first began happening in the southwest, Chris was the first to compete. Along with Jackson and Winklejohn, the three organized a belt system for Gaidojutsu, and in 2000 Luttrell was the first to obtain a black belt in the art. The original team was made up of the following: Chris Luttrell, Brad Ahrensfeld, Tom Vaughn, Josh Groves, Chad Lemoine, Keith Jardine, Diego Sanchez, and Kyle Seals. direct interview with Chris Luttrell. He was approached in 2011 by Keith Jardine to help establish a school to teach mixed martial arts as both a form of fitness training and self-defense.

Poteat was born at Forest Home in Caswell County, North Carolina, near the community of Yanceyville. She was the daughter of James and Julia A. McNeill Poteat; her siblings included William Louis Poteat, and through her niece Helen she was for a time the aunt-in-law of Laurence Stallings. She was also the great-aunt of philosopher William H. Poteat.The Raleigh News & Observer, Tuesday 23 May 2000, obituary of \\"William H. Poteat\\" and The Raleigh News & Observer, Thursday 25 May 2000, \\"Remembrances of One Great Teacher,\\" by Jim Jenkins, supplemented by telephone conversations and email messages with Poteat's second wife Patricia Lewis Poteat and James W. Stines, a close family friend and co-editor of The Primacy of Persons and the Language of Culture. Her early education came in local schools before she went to the Raleigh Female Seminary. She then traveled to New York City, studying at the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts and the Cooper Union and having lessons at the School of Applied Design in Philadelphia. She was a private pupil of William Merritt Chase, and also studied with Robert Henri, Charles Parsons, and Louis Mounier during her career. She also spent several summers abroad, studying at various times in London, Florence, Venice, and Carcassonne. Poteat first worked at the Oxford Seminary in Oxford, North Carolina, but she joined the faculty of the Baptist Female University, today Meredith College, in Raleigh upon its opening on September 27, 1899. She remained there until her death over forty years later. She turned the art department into one of the most highly regarded in the southern United States, modeling its curriculum on those of schools in New York, Philadelphia, and Paris. Among her pupils at Meredith was painter Francis Speight; others include Mary Tillery, Ethel Parrot Hughes, Lucy Sanders Hood, Mrs. Herbert Peele, Heslope Purefoy, Dorothy Horne Decker, and Effie Raye Calhoun Bateman Goff. Poteat designed costumes for the faculty's quadrennial production of Alice in Wonderland; she also designed the university seal, adopted in 1909. Poteat was a devout member of the Baptist Church. She never married. After her father's death her mother came to live with her; the two would frequently visit her brother William at Wake Forest University during his presidency. On her death she was buried in the family cemetery near Yanceyville. A portrait of Poteat, done by her pupil Mary Tillery and presented to Meredith College by a group of alumnae in 1938, hung in the dormitory Poteat Hall until 1995, when it was destroyed by vandalism. She was also memorialized with a magnolia tree on campus and with the creation of the Poteat Scholarship. She is among the artists represented in the North Carolina Women Artists Archive at the library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

In 1953 he was closely involved in Operation Cabin 12, arranging the defection of Vladimir Petrov from the Soviet Union to Australia. In 1954, he was appointed Deputy Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), roughly equivalent to the FBI and MI5. He received the Order of the British Empire in 1957. Early life and career Richards was born on 27 November 1905, in Nottingham, England. He moved to Australia at age 21 and joined the Western Australia Police in 1928. He later worked in the Criminal Investigation Branch and, from September 1939 to 1942, led the Special Bureau and Aliens Office. Richards began his intelligence career with a secondment to the Commonwealth Security Service until November 1945. In March 1942, he was key in the arrests of four members of the Australia First Movement in Perth, two of whom were convicted of conspiring to assist the enemy; the others were interned. Richards was appointed Perth's regional director of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in 1949 after its formation on 16 March and became involved in the multi-national Venona project, looking into leaks of information to the Soviet Union discovered in diplomatic cables intercepted by the United States. In 1950, Richards became deputy director for Venona and went to work with MI5 in November 1952, after which he became ASIO's deputy director for New South Wales. Petrov Affair Ron Richards (centre) with defectors Vladimir and Evdokia Petrov In 1953 and 1954, as deputy director for New South Wales, Richards was in charge of Operation Cabin12, the arrangement of the defection of USSR spy Vladimir Petrov. Since February 1951, Petrov had been working for the KGB from the Canberra embassy. Michael Bialoguski was assigned to stay close to Petrov and report on his activities to ASIO, for whom he worked part- time. In time, Petrov started to hint to Bialoguski about defection. After Bialoguski was fired by ASIO, he told them on 23 November 1953 that Petrov and his wife wanted to defect but also threatened to go to the papers if he were not reinstated. It was Richards who warned the Director-General, Charles Spry, about the situation. On 27 November, Richards met Bialoguski and re-employed him on behalf of ASIO and briefed him on how he was to deal with Petrov. Richards reported frequently to Spry from this point until the end of the operation.Manne 2014, pp.40–41 At this point, the planning for Petrov's defection was called Operation Cabin 11 (possible defectors were called \\"Cabin Candidates\\"). In December and January, the tentative plan was for Petrov to buy a chicken farm as the basis for his new life. Bialoguski showed him around the \\"Dream Acres\\" farm near Sydney on 12 December.Manne 2014, p.41 In January 1954 the plan was redesignated Operation Cabin 12. Richards' first in-person meeting with Petrov took place on 27 February 1954. In Bialoguski's flat, Richards offered Petrov political asylum and on 19 March offered him £5,000 in cash.Manne 2014, pp.54–56 In all, Richards met with Petrov twelve times, frequently recording him and negotiating the terms of the defection, particularly aiming to make sure Petrov brought with him valuable documents to share with the Australian government. Petrov's defection ultimately took place on 3 April and was announced on the 13th by thenPrime Minister Robert Menzies.Manne 2014, p63 In response, the Soviet Union closed its Australian Embassy on 23 April. Richards debriefed Petrov, starting on the day of his formal defection.Manne 2014, pp.67–71 Later career Richards with Charles Spry during the Petrov Royal Commission As a result of the Petrov affair, a Royal Commission on espionage was convened in May 1954. Richards was appointed deputy director-general of ASIO under Spry, in which role he had charge of ASIO's commission unit. He arranged for the Petrovs to appear before the commission and submitted ASIO documents to it, but Richards was not in the end questioned. In 1957, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). He subsequently served on a committee of security experts in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and in 1961 was chairman of the counter- subversion expert study group of the same organisation. In 1965, during the Cold War, Richards, together with ASIO head of counter-espionage Don Marshall, recruited defence analyst Paul Dibb to identify KGB agents at the re- established Soviet Embassy in Canberra and try to recruit them in turn, which Dibb did until 1984. Dibb remembered Richards as the only man Marshall ever referred to as \\"Sir\\". Dibb was later investigated by ASIO on suspicion of being a double agent but was exonerated, and wrote the influential Dibb Report about Australia's defence policy in 1985 and 1986. After four years as senior liaison officer at Australia House, Richards retired in 1969. Personal life Richards was married on 27 April 1929 to Clarice Edna Counsel, with whom he had one daughter, and a son who died in infancy. Clarice died on 22 December 1982, and Ron died on 25 September 1985 at home in Victoria Park, Perth. Both were buried in Karrakatta Cemetery.

Scott's early work contributed to the modern understanding of the biology of insulin and its use in diabetes management, though the exact role and significance of his research in this context has been a subject of controversy. Later, Scott developed a standard blood test for diabetes. After retiring from Columbia in 1942, Scott went on to become a noted horticulturist. Education and academic career Scott was born in 1877 in Kinsman, Ohio. He attended Ohio Wesleyan University as an undergraduate and received his B.S. in 1902. He received his M.S. from the University of Chicago in 1911, working with Anton Carlson, and left Chicago to begin his faculty career with a brief period teaching at the University of Kansas. In 1912 he moved to a teaching position at Columbia University. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1914 and remained on the faculty until his retirement in 1942, briefly interrupted by World War I service with the American Expeditionary Force in France. His tenure at Columbia included the development of blood tests for blood glucose and characterization of standards for identifying diabetes by blood test. Among his notable graduate students is physiologist Albert Baird Hastings. Role in the discovery of insulin Scott's work with Carlson at the University of Chicago subsequently became a subject of controversy over the scientific priority of significant discoveries about insulin and diabetes, which earned Frederick Banting and John Macleod the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1923. Although Scott was only a master's student, he worked relatively independently in the Carlson laboratory, using dogs with surgically disrupted pancreas as animal models to measure his efforts to isolate a hypothesized anti-diabetic \\"active principle\\" found in pancreatic secretions. Evidence from his 1911 master's thesis suggests that he did successfully isolate a protein with observable clinical benefits in his experimental diabetic dogs, which by his description must have been insulin. However, Scott's thesis was not published in its original form until much later, in 1966. Instead, while departing for his new position in Kansas, Scott left his thesis with Carlson, who published a version in Scott's name in 1912 in the American Journal of Physiology. In their subsequent work on insulin and diabetes, Frederick Banting and Charles Best expanded upon the themes in Scott's work and cited the 1912 paper. However, later controversy arose regarding Carlson's edits to Scott's thesis to produce the paper, which included a summary and conclusion paragraph described as \\"cautious\\" and insufficient to establish his priority in isolating insulin; in fact, writing in 1964, Scott himself denied authorship of the 1912 paper. The award of the 1923 Nobel to Banting and Macleod attracted dispute from a variety of sources, with Banting himself objecting to Macleod's inclusion and ultimately sharing his award money with his research associate Charles Best; Macleod sharing his with another member of the team, James Collip; and other researchers in the field, including Scott, contending that their role in the discovery had been overlooked and earlier work undercited. Scott's wife self-published a book on the subject years later called Great Scott: Ernest Lyman Scott's work with insulin in 1911. Personal life Scott's wife Aleita Hopping Scott also held a Ph.D. in physiology and shared his interest in plants and gardening. After Ernest Scott's retirement from Columbia, the couple established a reputation as horticulturists, extensively documenting their garden at their home in New Jersey. Ernest Scott served as the founding president of the National Chrysanthemum Society of America and Aleita co-founded the American Primrose Society. The couple coauthored a book on chrysanthemums. Ernest Scott died in 1966. His papers are held by the National Library of Medicine and the New York Botanical Garden.

Salomé Karwah ( – February 21, 2017) was a Liberian nurse who was named co-Person of the Year by Time magazine in 2014 for her efforts to combat the West African Ebola virus epidemic. She appeared on the cover of Time in December 2014 with other health care workers and colleagues working to end the epidemic. Karwah survived ebola herself, before returning to work with Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) to help other patients afflicted with the disease. The actions of Karwah and other health care professionals are believed to have saved lives of thousands. However, two years later, Karwah died from complications of childbirth; her widower suggested that this might have been due to the widespread, mistaken belief that ebola survivors can still transmit the virus. Even before the ebola outbreak, Liberia had one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world. Biography Karwah's father was a doctor. She met her future husband, James Harris, at a mutual friend's in 2013 after both had recently ended previous relationships. They began dating shortly afterwards. =Ebola work= One year after Karwah and Harris began dating, the West African Ebola virus epidemic struck Liberia, as well as neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone, in 2014. Her family was among the first to become ill with ebola during the summer of 2014. Her father was the first to die from ebola, which ultimately killed both her parents and seven other relatives. Karwah, her sister, Josephine, her mother, and Harris were all soon stricken with ebola as well. Salome, Harris and Josephine Karwah were all placed in a Doctors Without Borders medical unit in Monrovia with other ebola patients to be treated. Salome Karwah's priority was to care for her sister, Josephine Manly, who was pregnant at the time she contracted ebola. Salome cared for Josephine, who nearly died, by changing her clothes and cleaning fluids that contained ebola. She withheld the news of their mother's death from Josephine, fearing that it would have a detrimental effect on her health. By September 2014, both the Karwah sisters had recovered, determined free of the disease, and discharged from the hospital. Salome Karwah was released from the ebola unit on August 28, 2014. Karwah's boyfriend, James Harris, also recovered and was released from the medical unit a few days later. The staff at Doctors Without Borders (MSF) had noticed that Karwah and Harris had both shown an ability to care for other ebola victims, regardless of the risk to their own health, while they had been patients. Shortly after their discharge from the hospital, MSF hired them to serve as mental health counselors in their ebola units. Salome Karwah returned to the unit, this time as a counselor and nurse, one month after her release. As survivors, she and Harris had developed a natural immunity to that particular strain of ebola. Karwah, who was interviewed on her work by NPR in 2014, recalled that \\"It was not hard to come back [to the Ebola treatment center]. Of course I lost my two parents here...but if I can help someone survive, I will be very happy.\\" She remained at the unit until the end of the ebola epidemic.In October 2014, Karwah wrote a guest piece in The Guardian noting that helping others with ebola brought meaning to her life. In the same essay, Karwah reiterated that \\"if someone has Ebola, it isn’t good to stigmatize them, because you don’t know who is next in line to contract the virus.\\"Time magazine named Salome Karwah as its co-Person of the Year, alongside several other \\"ebola fighters\\". She appeared on the worldwide cover of Time in December 2014 just months after being released from the hospital. Harris and Karwah became engaged. They were married to January 2016 while Karwah was pregnant with their third child, who was born a few months later. In the summer of 2016, Karwah became pregnant with their fourth child, which they agreed would be their last. The couple, who were religious but already had three small children, thought of having an abortion, but chose to keep the baby. =Death from complications of childbirth= Salome Karwah went through a difficult pregnancy. In February 2017, Karwah underwent a caesarean section though she was suffering from high blood pressure at the time. Although she had high blood pressure, Karwah was discharged from Eternal Love Winning Africa Hospital (ELWA) on the outskirts of Monrovia several days after undergoing the caesarean. She and Harris returned to their home to care for their new infant son, Jeremiah Solomon Karwah, and their other children. Karwah continued to feel unwell, exhibit spikes in blood pressure, and confided to family members that staff at ELWA hospital had neglected her complications. Just hours after arriving home, Karwah collapsed and began foaming at the mouth. Her husband rushed her back to ELWA hospital on the night of February 19, 2017. However, the doctor who specialized in treating ebola survivors was not on duty. Another doctor refused to treat Karwah, who remained in the car for three hours while suffering from convulsions and seizures. Harris eventually went to the emergency room himself and brought out a wheelchair to bring his wife into the hospital. According to Harris, the doctor and nurses on duty still refused to see or touch Karwah, telling him that he would have to take her to another hospital. Harris gave his account to NPR, saying \\"\\"[The doctor] was checking Facebook...I had to rush into the emergency room myself to get a wheelchair, but I was struggling to take her from the car to put her in it. Other nurses came to help me, but the doctor told me that she would not touch her, and that if [Salome] stayed [at the hospital] she would die.\\" He managed to contact an epidemiologist named Dr. Mosoka Fallah, who arrived at ELWA three hours later and finally admitted Karwah to the hospital. Despite his efforts, Salome Karwah, who had survived ebola, died from complications of child birth on February 21, 2017, at the age of 28, just four days after giving birth. She was survived by her husband and their four children, including the newborn, Jeremiah Solomon Karwah. Harris and Karwah's sister, Josephine, accused the ELWA staff of malpractice due to her status as a former ebola patient. They accuse the medical staff of providing inadequate care because they were afraid to touch her. Josephine Manly, Karwah's sister who also survived ebola, reiterated Harris's claims of poor treatment by hospital staff, saying \\"They said she was an Ebola survivor. They didn't want contact with her fluids. They all gave her distance. No one would give her an injection.\\" Manly believes that Karwah would have survived the child birth complications if she had received proper, timely emergency medical treatment. The mistaken belief that ebola survivors can still transmit the disease remains widespread across the country, including among medical staff, which may have contributed to Karwah's death. According to the Associated Press, the country's chief medical officer, Dr. Francis Kateh, echoed this falsehood when he told reporters that \\"the hospital knew she had Ebola and they operated on her, which put them at more risk.\\" Tributes came in from around the world, including her former employer, Médecins Sans Frontières, who wrote, \\"Salome's own experience of Ebola gave her incredible empathy for the patients that she worked so hard to care for...Our many staff who remember working with her speak of her strength and compassion, but also of her smile...She made a huge contribution to MSF's work at the height of the outbreak in Monrovia.\\" Ella Watson-Stryker, a MDF health promoter and colleague of Karwah, told Time magazine of the shock of her death, \\"To survive Ebola and then die in the larger yet silent epidemic of health system failure … I have no words.\\"Karwah's life was remembered on BBC Radio 4's obituary programme Last Word by Time magazine’s Africa correspondent, Aryn Baker.

The train included a telegraph station, a library, a printing house, a radio station, an electric power station, a squad of picked sharpshooters and machine gunners, and an automobile garage. The staff on the train included many Soviet military and civilian procurement specialists. A special newspaper – En Route, which served as agitation for the Red Army – was published in it. The armored train contributed to the formation of the Red Army and the subsequent consolidation of the power of the Bolsheviks in Soviet Russia. The train was awarded the highly prestigious Decoration of the Red Flag in honor of the work that it and its crew performed during the civil war.  References  Sources and further reading  * Heyman N.

He became only the third judge ever to be elevated in this way, without first becoming the chief justice of some high court. In the Supreme Court, Abdul Nazeer was the lone Muslim judge in a multi-faith bench which heard the controversial Triple Talaq case in 2017. Though Justice Nazeer and one other judge upheld the validity of the practise of Triple Talaq (Talaq-e-Biddat) based on that fact that it is permissible under Muslim Sharia Law, it was barred by the bench by 3:2 majority and asked the Central government to bring legislation in six months to govern marriage and divorce in the Muslim community. The court said till the government formulates a law regarding triple talaq, there would be an injunction on husbands pronouncing triple talaq on their wives.

In between attending literary events, readings and book launches, you’ll be able to visit the popular beaches of [G]oa for some sun, sand and seafood! ...Participation is free, with pre-registration.\\" Writing in The Navhind Times, one critical point of view commented: \\"Goa needs to create rooms of its own to spur on the creative process. But, now, just when writers from here have an enhanced chance of getting heard, we could be building new hierarchies. Local work needs to be validated by the tastes of someone in New Delhi or New York, before it can be deemed as significant and having value for Goa. This is a deeply disturbing idea, even if it is implemented subconsciously. There seems to be little consultation happening to source out potential participants. In the case of national and international participants, one can go by what is said about them, or reputations built in other literary festivals. How does one choose participation from Goa when we are still to understand the field of who’s doing what?\\" Mridula Garg writes, \\"Sometimes, in a blink of an eye, we discover that the someone we thought lay at the extreme end of the margin is actually closest to us; in fact is our alter ego... That is the point when we begin to create literature or art. That’s why a Damodar Mauzo can write about a Goan boy’s life in East Africa in the last century with the same ease he can write about Goa now. It’s important to remember that the margin is not a homogenous space. Within the margin lie a number of invisible margins peopled with dissenters. And each of them is a significant other because dissent is the life-blood of literature and social change.\\"  See also  * Jaipur Literature Festival * International Film Festival of India References External links *GALF website *Videos from GALF (amidst other subjects) 2010 establishments in India December events Festivals established in 2010 Festivals in Goa Literary festivals in India ","title":"Goa Arts and Literature Festival"},{"id":"53499121","text":"Sitalcas is a monotypic genus of North American sheet weavers containing the single species, Sitalcas ruralis.

Berlin, Ontario (now Kitchener, Ontario, and Preston, Ontario (now part of Cambridge, Ontario), were only apart, but the route required a bridge over the Grand River. Berlin's city council awarded the line a subsidy. The line operated for just three months. Ice flowing down the Grand River damaged piers of its bridge at Doon, Ontario. The bridge never re- opened. There were recriminations over the line's failure, and the satisfaction of those who inspected the line, and its bridge. Eventually, in 1863, an act in Canada's Parliament exonerated Berlin City Council. Edward Irving Ferguson acquired the line's assets, because he had held a mortgage on some of the line's property. He sold those assets to the Grand Trunk Railway, on November 14, 1865. The from Berlin, to the Grand River, at Doon, was incorporated into a route the Grand Trunk built from Berlin to Galt, Ontario.

The operation called for Allied forces to mislead the Wehrmacht into believing that the Allies were going to attack the island of Crete. Operation Rayon was successful in its aims and forced the Germans to divert forces from other fronts to defend Crete and Occupied Greece. The operation was planned and implemented by Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force.  Background  The Battle of Greece and the subsequent Fall of Crete resulted in the Allies being driven from Greece by a combined German and Italian force. Greece was brought under German occupation, with the industry and infrastructure of the country being used to support the German North African Campaign. The loss of Crete was a major defeat for the British Empire, which had used the island to support naval activity and to base aircraft. Considerations were made for an actual invasion to recapture the island, but these plans were abandoned as being too risky, and the British efforts to fight in North Africa were already taxing resources. As such, the Allies focused instead on disrupting lines of supply between the Italian colony of Libya and the European mainland to hinder the Axis armies in North Africa. On the opposing side, the Germans knew that Crete was of vital importance to the control of the Aegean Sea, and as such made efforts to defend the island from and Allied counterattack. In December 1941 Britain declared war on the Japanese Empire, leading to the opening of the Pacific War. As Australia and New Zealand were now threatened by the Japanese advance, many commonwealth soldiers were redeployed from North Africa to the Pacific. To cover the movement of these troops, the British conducted maneuvers designed to make the Germans think that an attack in Greece was underway. Communications were also leaked to Axis intelligence agencies to support this deception. British intelligence reports indicated an increase in German and Italian activity in Greece during the redeployment, with this reaction being the direct inspiration for what would become Operation Rayon.  Operation  In mid July 1942 Operation Rayon was implemented. Rayon was intended to draw Axis attention away from Allied convoys travelling to Malta and to divert forces from North Africa. The \\"Story\\" that was promoted to the Germans was that the Allies were preparing to launch an air and seaborne assault on the Island of Crete using British and Greek troops supported by American air power. False intelligence was planted with the intent to mislead the Germans. Rumors were spread by British intelligence among the Greek exile communities in the Middle East, hinting that the liberation of the Greek mainland was imminent. Greek soldiers and a Greek destroyer undertook actual assault drills in preparation for an invasion. Dummy landing craft and gliders were constructed and placed in areas that were known to be within the range of German reconnaissance planes. American aircrews deployed in Cyprus were put through drills. The result of these activities was mixed. A moderate increase in German activity on Crete was detected, and the operation succeeded in drawing attention away from a convoy bound for Malta.  Aftermath  Many of the 'A' force personnel involved in Operation Rayon were employed in Operation Zeppelin, another operation intended to mislead the Wehrmacht into believing an Allied invasion of Greece would occur. Dummy landing craft (dubbed \\"Drybob\\" and \\"Wetbob\\") used in Operation Rayon were later used in Operation Bodyguard.

Biography  Rosenthal AG (1951). Based on dancer Harald Kreutzberg in the dance Night Song to the music of Johannes Brahms. Waldemar Fritsch was born in 1909 as a tenth and last child in Altrohlau (today Stará Role, part of Karlovy Vary), part of the double monarchy of Austria-Hungary. His father worked as a fiacre in Karlovy Vary until the age of 75. After graduating from the Volks und Bürgerschule, Fritsch trained as a porcelain tool and mold founder in the \\"Viktoria\\" porcelain factory in Altrohlau. The area around Egerland, Karlovy Vary and Teplitz-Schönau were regarded as important sites of the porcelain and ceramics industry. Technical schools for the technical and artistic training of ceramists existed in Karlovy Vary (since 1925) and Teplitz-Schönau (1875), and in 1811 porcelain was produced in Altrohlau. Fritsch went to the Prague School of Fine Art from 1929 and the Porzellanfachschule Karlsbad-Fischern from 1926. In his creations, he drew attention by the artistic quality of small sculptures such as the terracotta-relief \\"Jugend,\\" a kitten and chicken group as well as a lying wolfshund. In Prague, he created porcelain sculptures of Saint Sebastian, a loreley, a cockatoos, and a woman with a child and a baby. In 1934, Fritsch received an assistant position at the state school for ceramics in Teplitz-Schönau, which he took over in the autumn of 1938. In 1939, he was awarded a professorship for applied sculpture to the State College of the Porcelain Industry in Karlovy Vary. After denouncing the Nazis, Fritsch was imprisoned in Dresden and Berlin by the Gestapo in 1939. When freed in 1940, he was forbidden to work. From 1943 and until the war ended, he served in the war service Wehrmacht. In 1946, he moved to southwest Germany with his 80-year-old parents, where he found a new home in Ansbach in 1947 after temporary stays in Stuttgart-Wendlingen and Ellingen. A period of great creativity followed after moving to Ansbach. His porcelain sculptures were in the Ansbach museum, which dedicated a special exhibition to Fritsch in 1963. He died 13 July 1978 in Ansbach and is buried in the cemetery of the church of St. Lambertus in Ansbach-Eyb.

Prelude In early February 1967, intelligence reported that the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 1st Division was operating in the Plei Trap Valley near the Vietnam-Cambodia border and the 10th Division was believed to also be nearby. The area of the operation was described as being \\"an area of almost continuous jungle with hardwood trees of several varieties up to six or seven feet in diameter and 200-250 feet in height. Where sunlight can break through the overhead canopy, the jungle floor is covered with thick, dense undergrowth restricting observation to a few meters and making movement extremely difficult. The area represents some of the most difficult jungle terrain in all of Southeast Asia. It is intersected by valleys and mountains with elevations varying from about 500 to nearly 600 feet, presenting additional difficulties to movement and maneuver.\\" Operation On 12 February, the 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division deployed two Battalions by helicopter into the Plei Trap Valley to establish operating bases. On 14 February Company C 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment (1-12th Infantry) discovered a series of new unoccupied bunkers near its landing zone (LZ) 501 North. The following morning Company C was engaged by PAVN forces who attempted to overrun the landing zone, but the attack was repulsed by air strikes and artillery fire. On 16 February as the rest of the 1-12th Infantry was being landed by helicopter they were fired on by the PAVN 8th Battalion, 66th Regiment, damaging 8 UH-1 Hueys. The PAVN continued to attack the LZ into the night but disengaged before dawn on 16 February. On the morning of 16 February, a platoon of the 2nd Battalion, 8th Infantry Regiment (2-8th Infantry) which was patrolling east of the Plei Trap was ambushed by the PAVN 32nd Regiment and forced to withdraw with gunship and artillery support. Inside the Plei Trap a company of the 22nd Infantry Regiment chased several PAVN soldiers who led them into an ambush and were unable to disengage until nightfall. By the end of 16 February, the 2nd Brigade had lost 55 dead and 74 wounded, while the PAVN had lost almost 300 by body count. Concerned about the high casualties, MG Peers ordered the units to stay near their bases for the next five days while the area was hit by artillery and air strikes, including nine by B-52s. Peers also received reinforcement by the 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division. On 21 February, a patrolling company from 2-8th Infantry was engaged by a PAVN heavy weapons position. US losses were 7 killed and 34 wounded, while PAVN losses were 43 killed. On 25 February, Company A 1-12th Infantry in the Plei Trap detected a PAVN ambush and called in airstrikes killing 48 PAVN and leaving three wounded behind for the loss of one US soldier killed. On 27 February, a US reconnaissance patrol from 1-12th Infantry was mistakenly inserted into Cambodia. The patrol killed two PAVN soldiers and observed numerous others before being extracted. On 2 March, a PAVN mortar attack on a 1-12th Infantry position killed two US soldiers and wounded two others. On 12 March, a company of the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment (2-35th Infantry) patrolling in the Plei Trap came under fire from a PAVN bunker complex. Two more companies were landed by helicopter but were quickly pinned down. As night fell the US force came under mortar fire from Cambodia, as flares illuminated the battlefield, the Americans observed that the PAVN were crossing the Se San river into Cambodia and helicopter gunships were called to attack the disengaging PAVN. By the following morning the PAVN had left the area leaving 51 dead, while US casualties were 14 dead and 46 wounded. On 13 March the PAVN launched a mortar attack on LZ 3 Tango in the Plei Trap, hitting it with over 300 rounds, killing 1 US soldier, wounding 87 and damaging 25 vehicles. On 16 March, the 2nd Brigade air-assaulted into the area of Plei Doc (), approximately 15 kilometres northwest of the Đức Cơ Camp. As the UH-1s carrying the 1-12th Infantry landed the PAVN triggered several command detonated mines destroying one UH-1D and damaging seven others and killing 5 US troops and wounding 13 others. The PAVN then engaged the infantry with rifle and machine gun fire before breaking contact as US air and artillery fire was brought to bear, leaving 10 dead. Also on 21 March, a long-range reconnaissance patrol from 1-8th Infantry operating near the Cambodian border lost radio contact with its headquarters and on 22 March Companies A and B 1-8th Infantry were sent to locate them. The US companies encountered a Battalion of the PAVN 95B Regiment and withstood several assaults before the PAVN withdrew into Cambodia leaving 136 dead. US casualties were 27 killed and 48 wounded. With the change of focus of the operation from the Plei Trap valley to Plei Doc and believing that the PAVN had left the area, the 1st Brigade began withdrawing from the Plei Trap. On 21 March a PAVN force ambushed Company C 2-35th Infantry in the Plei Trap killing 22 Americans and wounding 53 for the loss of 18 dead. Despite this evidence of continued PAVN presence and given the oncoming rainy season, MG Peers continued the withdrawal and 1st Brigade had left the valley by 28 March replacing the 2nd Brigade in Plei Doc. The operation finally concluded on 5 April 1967. Aftermath Operation Sam Houston appeared to end inconclusively like Operation Paul Revere IV in the same area. Total US casualties were 155 killed, while PAVN losses were 733 killed (body count). The PAVN were always able to control the place and timing of the fighting, withdrawing to their sanctuaries in Cambodia when American pressure became too great. Most of the engagements of the operation occurred within five kilometres of the Cambodian border. Rather than keeping large forces close to the Cambodian border, MG Peers decided to move his Battalions back from the border area which going forward would be patrolled by long-range reconnaissance patrols. The PAVN had developed effective tactics of \\"hugging\\" the US forces to reduce the effectiveness of B-52 strikes which could not take place within a safety margin of three kilometres of friendly positions. During the operation the XM148 grenade launcher was field-tested and found to be difficult to load in combat, while the XM576 40mm grenade was tested and found to be very effective for jungle use.
