He was born in Alamance County, North Carolina. Career Jones played for several teams; the Keokuk Westerns, Hartford Dark Blues, Cincinnati Reds (NL), Chicago White Stockings, Boston Red Caps, Cincinnati Red Stockings (AA), New York Metropolitans, and Kansas City Cowboys. A popular but controversial player, despite his hitting ability he never played for a league champion. On June 10, 1880, Jones became the first big leaguer to hit two homers in the same inning. Both home runs came off Buffalo Bisons' pitcher Tom Poorman in the eighth inning of a 19‚Äì3 rout. Jones best period was from 1883 to 1885, when he hit 22 home runs, had 186 RBI, and batted .310. Through the first nine seasons of the major leagues' existence, Jones held the career record for home runs, despite missing two of those seasons (1881‚Äì82) as a result of being blackballed from the sport. In 1887, he dropped to fourth place. By 1889, he was just tenth, and by 1890 he was no longer among the top ten. After his playing career concluded, Jones spent two seasons as an umpire. He umpired 121 games in the Players' League in 1890, and 76 games in the American Association in 1891.

History The Great Western Sugar Company was incorporated in February 1901 by Charles Boettcher and others including John F. Campion, after having difficulty making their Colorado Sugar Manufacturing Company factory in Grand Junction, Colorado a success and selling it to locals. Colorado Sugar had an agreement to build a plant in Loveland, Colorado in 1899, with the Utah Sugar Company eyeing expansion into Colorado, and Colorado Sugar lacking resources to follow through quickly, they gave their Loveland agreement to Great Western. Great Western brought in other high-level investors (Eben Smith, David Moffat, William Jackson Palmer), created the Great Western Construction Company, then had the subsidiary build their first sugar beet processing plant, opening on November 21, 1901. The first year was a failure, both for beet quality and problems at the factory, so they hired Mark Austin from Utah Sugar to improve their situation. Great Western created the Great Western Railway subsidiary in 1902, which allowed an expansion of the territory a beet sugar factory could collect from. Great Western also created the Loveland Construction Company, which built the railway, primarily with Japanese workers. By 1976 the railway had of track, all standard guage. Rounds of price wars with the Sugar Trust in 1900-1902 eliminated Great Western's Colorado competitors, and the Trust acquired control of Great Western by 1904. The Trust set prices, trained factories and farmers, assigned plants and farmers to regional \\"beet districts\\" to prevent plants from competing against each other with the farmers, but left the factories independent to conduct other business. In 1905 Great Western was reestablished as a New Jersey corporation and acquired four Colorado factories. Colorado was the largest producer of beet sugar by 1906. By 1926 there were a total of 17 factories, including 13 from Great Western. Starting at its creation in 1901 Great Western brought in Russian Germans families (who had experience with sugar beet farming), single Japanese men (until immigration restrictions eliminated them in 1907), Mexican workers to help with the labors of sugar beet farming. The Russian Germans were preferred for their experience at producing high beet yields. Their upward mobility, not afforded to Hispanic workers, meant they contributed less in the labor pool. By the 1910s and the 1920s the Hispanic/Mexican farmworkers had taken over the need for beet labor. Great Western cut contract prices to farmers in the 1910s and 1920s, leading to the \\"Loveland Resolutions\\" accord by farmers associations against the company. Colorado passed the Cooperative Marketing Law in 1923, allowing co-ops as legal entities. This allowed farmers to present a united front and raise the contract prices of beets. This, fewer farmers planting beets, and curly top disease lowering yields caused Great Western to create a profitsharing contract, splitting the profits from selling the sugar 50-50. This became standard for the industry. The Great Depression in 1929 substantially reduced both demand and prices, nearly ruining the industry. Tariffs were passed, which did not help. The Sugar Trust lobbied and got included in the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) through the Jones‚ÄìCostigan amendment. This reduced imports and set base prices on sugar. The dust bowl continued the interwar period traumas to the industry. Some farmers were protected from drought per the Colorado-Big Thompson Project, created through farm and industry lobbying. World War II brought an end to the Depression and drought, and brought back consumer demand. The lack of labor incentivized change: more reliable seeds were developed, which meant labor- intensive thinning and blocking was unnecessary and mechanical harvesting was perfected becoming rapidly adopted. However, AAA kept a cap on prices and profitability, hindering recovery. A long drought also hit in the 1950s. During the war, Great Western sought employees from the Heart Mountain Japanese American internment camp An announcement on 2 April 1943 described \\"choice contracts\\" for Heart Mountain workers, and a quarter-page Great Western ad in September 1943 discussed pricing, transportation, and said \\"Many farmers need help to harvest the sugar beet crop. You will be welcomed by the public and your efforts will be appreciated.\\" During the 1942-1945 seasons, Japanese American laborers brought in 20% of the sugar beet crop in the nation, despite deep hatred and racism. After the war, Great Western offered relocation to families to work as laborers in near Billings and Lovell. A byproduct of the process was molasses that could not be crystallized into sugar. This was used as food, sold as livestock feed, or distilled into alcohol. Beginning in the 1950s, it was put through the Steffen process to produce monosodium glutamate (MSG). Great Western had one MSG plant in Fort Collins. In 1965, William M. White Jr., at age 25, was a vice present at Allen & Company. Invited back to Colorado from New York by James A. Krentler, the two acquired Denver's Colorado Milling and Elevator Company (established 1885) in that year, then used that to take over Great Western in 1968. Great Western merged with Colorado Milling and became Great Western United Corporation with White as the president. Colorado Milling and Elevator was sold in 1967 or 1969 to Peavey Flour Co. White Jr. was the fourth generation of his family to be involved with Great Western, and his father was a director at the time of the takeover. White Jr. described the merged company as \\"big enough to do anything we want\\". Robert R. Owen joined that year as the Great Western Sugar president, coming from Ford Motors. He remained president until 1971. The Colorado City, Colorado and California City, California land developments, both part of Nathan \\"Nat\\" K. Mendelsohn's California City Development Company, were added in 1968, becoming Great Western Cities, with Mendelsohn joining Great Western. For various reasons, all of these companies struggled in 1969-1970. White acquired the Emerald Christmas Tree Company, which grew Christmas trees and distributed and sold them, prepackaged, to retailers. It was acquired in 1968 for $1.5 million. It then lost $1 million in its first year and was sold for a loss in 1970. Colorado Milling was also sold in 1970 for $10 million, also at a loss. Timothy Wirth, a vice president of Great Western Cities, described White reading Future Shock in 1970 and then sending copies to company directors to bridge the gap between the \\"very young management\\" and the older management. By the 1970s, the New York Times described Great Western as a \\"house of cards\\". In 1971 White had cancelled cash dividends a month after promising at the annual meeting to not do so. This broke a nearly 40-year streak of dividends being paid at the company. White was willing to sell Colorado Milling and Great Western Sugar, but was dismissed as CEO in 1971, much of it through Mendelsohn's efforts. As the largest preferred shareholder, Mendelsohn launched a proxy fight for the company in 1972 to replace the directors and prevent the company from being split up. GWU's stock price dropped by more than a factor of 10 between late 1971 and mid-1973. Investigations of price fixing by six sugar producers including Great Western closed in 1974 with criminal indictments; the Justice Department and Council on Wage and Price Stability also investigated why prices had spiked 300-400% in 1974. Hunt International Resources acquired Great Western in late 1974 as a hostile takeover as the price fixing indictments came in, as the Hunt brothers attempted to corner the sugar market. They owned a combined 65% of the outstanding stock by 1976. They then removed the board of directors and executive leadership and moved the executive offices to the First National Bank Tower in Dallas, Texas, leaving the corporate office in Denver. They also added two lines of business: commodities trading and oil and gas exploration and development. Sugar prices remained high in 1975 even after the price fixing indictments were issued, even though the United States Sugar Act of 1937, which removed import quotas, also expired in 1974. Prices then began to deflate rapidly. By 1977 the industry was asking for government subsidies after the price deflation. In June 1975, GWU acquired Godchaux-Henderson Sugar, a cane sugar producer in New Orleans, from Southern Industries Corporation for $2.65 million cash, as well as making agreements on unsecured notes. This included their cane refinery in Reserve, Louisiana, which processed cane from local fields and from overseas, and a deepwater dock that was completed in 1973. In 1975-1976 they had contracts for raw cane from Corporation Azucarera La Victoria of Panama and the Philippine Exchange Company. GWU and Southern Industries sued each other in 1976 over the notes. The Rocky Mountain Beet Growers Association formed in 1971, and was later known as the Great Western Producers Co-Operative. Robert R. Owen, formerly Great Western Sugar's head until being demoted by White in 1971, became the co-op's head. As a farmers co-op, it attempted to buy the sugar division in 1971-1972 and again in 1973-1974 for $43.5 million. The 1974 effort failed after an increase in sugar prices led to record profits, which made the co-op's bid look undervalued. Great Western United sued in 1975 to void the contract and the co-op counterclaimed that United had failed to represent them accurately in proxy statements. The co-op lost the case in 1975, as well as on appeal in 1978 and on second appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court in 1980. In 1984 three divisions were put for sale: Godchaux- Henderson Sugar Company (Reserve, Louisiana), the Northern Ohio Sugar Company and the Great Western Railway Company. Holly Sugar expressed interest in buying Northern Ohio and Godchaux-Henderson but talks fell through in June 1984. By 1985 Great Western was described as \\"one of the many trouble spots\\" in the Hunt group, and Great Western filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 1985. Savannah Foods & Industries purchased the Fremont, Ohio plant and Findlay, Ohio storage facility. In 1985, Tate & Lyle created the Western Sugar Company and purchased six of the factories: Greeley, Fort Morgan, Scottsbluff, Baird, and Billings. They apparently also bought Loveland closed it down in 1985. By 2002 Western Sugar was still operating the Greeley and Fort Morgan factories. In 2002, more than 1000 sugar beet growers purchased the company, creating the Rocky Mountain Sugar Growers Co-operative. Later that year it merged into the Western Sugar Cooperative. The organization was headquartered in Denver, Colorado. It has five factories, located at Fort Morgan, Colorado, Scottsbluff, Nebraska, Torrington and Lovell, Wyoming, and Billings, Montana. In May 2015 the co-op announced it would be ending production at the Torrington site and would only use that site for storage. As such it plans to reduce the workforce at its Torrington site from 76 staffers to just 6. The changes were set to take effect late 2016, however as of early 2018 it is still fully operable. By 1976, related subsidiaries of GWU included: * The Great Western Sugar Company (incorporated in Delaware)  The Bighorn Limestone Company (incorporated in Montana)  Great Western Employment Agency, Inc. (incorporated in Texas, nonprofit; inactive by 1976)  Godchaux- Henderson Sugar., Inc. (incorporated in Louisiana)  Northern Ohio Sugar Company (incorporated in Ohio)  The Great Western Railway Company (incorporated in Colorado)  The Great Western Sugar Export Company (incorporated in Colorado)  The Great Western Sugar Leasing Company (incorporated in Delaware; inactive by 1976) * The Great Western Sugar Investment Company (incorporated in Delaware) =Leadership= Frank A. Kemp was named CEO in 1936 and remained so until 1967. He was elected chairman of the board in 1966, and died in 1971. It was noted that out of his $534,000 estate, there were no stock holdings in Great Western. William Mathews White Jr. (at age 28), became president in 1968 (after being head of Colorado Milling since 1965 until it was merged into GWU). In early 1967 White attempted to buy and merge Gorton's Fish into Colorado/GWU, acquiring 30 percent, but failed and sold the shares six months later. White Jr., (born ca 1940), was the son of the wealthy William M. White (1911-7 September 1966), noted for founding many companies in Colorado, including White and Davis Department Store, the first in the state, and controlling several Colorado- based banks. William Jr. graduated from Yale in 1961 and joined Allen & Company, becoming vice president by 1965 (at age 25). By 1972, in a Wall Street Journal describing his downfall, he was described as \\"a young kid who was copying the Lings and Perots, but didn't have in his bones an understanding of what they were doing.\\" It described how he lost Krentler's support after White berated Mendelsohn and others in a contentious 1971 board meeting; Krentler said \\"Making fun of someone in front of people is not my idea of fun. Nat Mendelsohn is a human being. I can't stand to see human beings treated like that.\\" The next day, the directors voted unanimously for White to resign. White was named tongue-in-cheek in a Cervi's Journal article, nominating him as a 1971 Denver Man Of The Year for \\"his classic execution of the lateral arabesque (see The Peter Principle)\\". After his ousting, he immediately announced he sold all of his common stock holdings to Colorado and Western Properties for cash and stock; Colorado and Western was owned by Neal Blue and Linden Blue. Neal and C&W;'s Arthur T. Cowperthwaite were then elected to the Great Western board. By February 1972 White amended the statement, indicating he had sold just under half of his shares, but both Neal and Cowperthwaite would remain on the board. By November 1972 Robert G. Everett was president and CEO. =Sugar beet factories= Sugar beets rapidly lost sugar content after harvesting, meaning many of the industrial processing factories were required.

Allen Smith in Knoxville, Tennessee. It was owned by Colorado Milling & Elevator when White took over. They then became part of Great Western Foods (GWF), a division of Great Western United, in 1968. GWF was based in Knoxville, and by 1972 had 6% of the southeast's regional flour milling capacity. It also produced its Three Rivers brand cornmeal. Federal Company and its subsidiary Dixie Portland Flour Mills purchased GWF in 1972. As Federal had 11% of the flour market, a Justice Department assistant district attorney in the antitrust division, Thomas E. Kauper, filed suit to require the divestment of GWF. The Justice Department lost that suit, as there was no basis for a regional market to the exclusion of others. Further, Federal's \\"home flour\\" market was fragmented between about 50 private-label and non-premium brands, and was also in a steep sales decline from 1965 to 1974. Federal/Dixie-Portland then renovated the plant in 1975. White Lily was the fourth most popular brand of flour in the US in 1988. The White Lily mill, after GWF and then Dixie Portland/Federal, went through many ownership changes from 1989 on: Holly Farms, Tyson Foods, Archer-Daniels- Midland, Windmill Holdings, then C.H. Guenther & Son Inc.'s Pioneer Flour Mills in 1995. Guenther used the site as a copacker for The J.M. Smucker Company; Smucker bought the White Lily brand in 2006, and Guenther closed the mill in 2008. The mill site was purchased by developer David Dewhirst in 2011, planning to turn part of it into lofts. =Shakey's Pizza= White purchased half of Shakey's Pizza in early 1967 through Colorado Milling, buying out Sherwood \\"Shakey\\" Johnson's half of the company, and then Great Western bought out Ed Plummer's remaining half of the company later in the year. There were 400 restaurants (of which 42 were company-owned) in 1971, and 530 (89 company- owned) in 1976. Shakey's franchisees settled a lawsuit with Great Western in April 1970 over (illegal) requirements to purchase ingredients from Great Western. The corporate headquarters was in Eagleton, Colorado. Joseph F. Dolan was president and CEO of Shakey's for some time until his resignation in February 1974. Hunt International Resources bought Great Western, including Shakey's, in 1974. Investors Gary Brown and Jay Halverson purchased it in 1984, then sold it to Singapore-based Inno-Pacific Holdings in 1988 (foreign locations) and 189 (domestic). =Great Western Restaurant Company= The company started a steakhouse chain, named Prime Time Restaurants in 1969 and called The Great Western Restaurant Company in the 1970s. It was incorporated in Delaware and inactive by 1976. =Great Western Cities= Mendelsohn started the California City, California in 1958, and added the Colorado City, Colorado development in 1962. After negotiating a 99 year lease with the Cochiti tribe, he added the Cochiti City, New Mexico development in 1969. The California City land was acquired without mineral rights, meaning titles sold to customers were not fee simple, with of mineral rights held by the state, primarily in the Second Community section. The U.S. Borax Company applied to prospect on of that land in 1966. This means the surface land could be at risk of being disrupted for the mining process, even used as part of an open pit mine. Through an agreement with California Department of Real Estate, Great Western Cities was effectively stopped from selling any of that land base. Tom Maney was the vice-president and general counsel for Great Western Cities (GWC) in 1975. Mendelsohn owned California City Development Company until it merged into GWU in 1969; he was then elected to GWU's board. In that same year Barron's described California City as \\"more suited to blizzards than people\\". Mendelsohn was fired by White in 1970, though he remained a large shareholder, and led criticism against White until he was removed a year later. Mendelsohn also owned North American Towns, Inc. and California City Realty Co. In addition to California and federal investigations, sales at Great Western Cities declined from almost $25 million in 1970 to $13 million in 1971. In 1971, the National Indian Youth Council sued over the agreement, stating lease terms weren't adequately explained, and the water rights guarantees were illegal. Bureau of Indian Affairs attorney William Veeder described it a \\"dereliction of duty\\". GWU agreed with the courts to not use the Cochiti water rights until matters were settled, and instead began purchasing water rights from ranchers in the surrounding area. Great Western Cities completed the California City Inn in June 1971. It had 105 guest rooms plus restaurants and convention faciltieies. They also built The Greenhorn Inn motel in Colorado City, with 60 rooms and facilities. Tom Watson was the CEO of Great Western Cities by 1971. Norman Gross, who had been at GWC and predecessors since 1958, was EVP and GM of GWC by late 1972, having rejoined after a brief absence. GWC was encumbered by the 1972 FTC settlement and by the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act of 1968, which combined to give buyers some recourse and forced additional disclosure from GWC. By 1972 regulations banning developments with septic tanks, which meant some lots could not be sold. By early 1974 it was clear the FTC was dissatisfied by their compliance with the order, and in 1975 they itemized many violation in the 1972-1974 time period. They reached a settlement in 1975, requiring $4 million in refunds to a class of customers and required $16 million investment in infrastructure projects at the three locations. Further, in March 1973, GWC settled with the California Department of Real Estate commissioner and the Attorney General, agreeing to an injunction. GWC then settled with the state in 1980 to get a clear title to the land encumbered with mining rights. This settlement meant the state relinquished their surface entry rights to the minerals (to depth), but did not remove the state's actual mineral rights, on the encumbered land. In exchange, GWC deeded a section () to the BLM for the Desert Tortoise Natural Area, deeded another section of 640 acres back to the State Lands Commission, and received clear title on the remaining approx of Second Community. Clearing the rights in the Third Community part of California City were left to a future agreement.People v.

Great Western salespeople only sold virgin land; resales were described as having \\"limited markets\\" and said \\"management believes that such resales are made at prices substantially lower to Great Western Cities' current offering prices.\\" In the same 1976 filing, GWU wrote down $4.3 million from GWC in 1975 and reserved $4 million for the FTC settlement.

In a 2003 interview for Vintage Guitar magazine, Mary Kaye (born Malia Ka'aihue) claimed to be descended from Hawaiian Queen Liliuokalani, through her father Johnny Kaaihue (Johnny Ukulele) whom she claimed was \\"pure Hawaiian\\" and stated, \\"he was the son of Prince Kuhio, Queen Liliuokalani's cousin.\\" However, according to the genealogy Liliuokalani put in her biography, her brothers were King David KalƒÅkaua and Prince William Pitt Leleiohoku II. Neither Liliuokalani nor her brothers had any biological children. The Mary Kaye Trio is credited with founding the Las Vegas \\"lounge\\" phenomenon at the Last Frontier in 1953 : an all-night party atmosphere where stars and common folk rubbed elbows in a freewheeling environment. Mary Kaye died in a Las Vegas hospital of pulmonary disease on February 17, 2007. Her son Jay Kaye, born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1953, was also a musician. In 1968, at the age of 15, he put out his first LP, Suddenly One Summer. Now a cult psychedelic album, it received little notice or airplay upon its release. He later moved to Mallorca, Spain, where he was a prominent part of the local music scene through the 1990s and 2000s. Jay died in Spain in 2015.  The Guitar  Mary was photographed with her equal partners Frank Ross and Norman Kaye (her brother, born Norman Ka'aihue) of the Mary Kaye Trio, in a 1956 Fender promotional advertisement featuring a new Stratocaster electric guitar. This ash blonde guitar with maple neck and gold hardware later became popularly known as \\"The Mary Kaye Strat.\\" Only a few were produced in 1956, but the color has been re-introduced to the Fender line after the strong international demand for the Mary Kaye color scheme. A limited Custom Shop series Mary Kaye Tribute Strat was issued in 2005. In 2007 a 57 Reissue Mary Kaye Strat was released for the 50th anniversary of the Stratocaster. The Custom Shop release can be seen in the 2005 Fender Frontline Catalog along with her personal history as interviewed by Fender.The MK Strat Story on the Fender homepage Endorsement Model (MK 001) In 2003, Mary Kaye received the first officially recognized \\"Mary Kaye\\" American Stratocaster, gifted by the Fender Custom Shop.

Written in 1762, it is considered Saint Paisius of Hilendar's greatest work and one of the most influential pieces of the Bulgarian revival, as well as the first work of Bulgarian historiography. The first printed edition of the full original text was prepared by Yordan Ivanov and published in 1914 by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. Until 1984, the manuscript was stored at the Bulgarian Zograf Monastery in Mount Athos, Greece. During the last years of the Cold War, the Bulgarian Committee for State Security replaced the manuscript with a copy and transferred the original in Bulgaria. In 1998, President Petar Stoyanov returned it to the Zograf Monastery, and in the meantime in 1998 and 2000 the Sofia University Publishing House produced two photo typical editions of Slavic-Bulgarian History, accompanied by translations into modern Bulgarian and English respectively. Although he was based in the Serbian monastery Hilandar, which was inhabited then mostly by Bulgarian monks, Paisius travelled extensively throughout the country and abroad and collected a vast amount of references to compile and write his concise but historically influential version of Bulgarian history. At that time the influx of Serbian monks decreased at the expense of Bulgarians, particularly from Macedonia. From the 17th to the 19th century, Hilandar was predominantly Bulgarian- populated. The importance of this manuscript is that it contributed to the formation of the Bulgarian national identity. What would follow is known as the Bulgarian National Revival, in which Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya played a significant role. The book's first manual copy was done by Sophronius of Vratsa in 1765. Structurally, Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya consists of two introductions, several chapters that discuss various historic events, a chapter about the \\"Slavic teachers\\", the disciples of Cyril and Methodius, a chapter about the Bulgarian saints, and an epilogue. Although some excerpts appeared in Petar Beron's Tsarstvenik of 1844, Paisii's History was not published in book form until the 1920s, in the edition of Nikola Filipov. There was an adaptation into modern Bulgarian in 1938. Critical editions were prepared in the 1960s, and a Russian translation. A German translation appeared in 1984, and an English version of the Zograph manuscript in 2001.http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3APaisii%CC%86%2C+Khilendarski%2C+Hieromonk%2C+b.+ca.+1722.&fq;=&dblist;=638&qt;=sort&se;=yr&sd;=asc&qt;=sort_yr_asc The Zografou draft of the Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya is depicted on the reverse of the Bulgarian 2 levs banknote, issued in 1999 and 2005.Bulgarian National Bank.

Of African descent, he was born at Portobelo in Panama on 2 April 1919. He became a French colonial administrator, and in this role was posted to Chad in 1946. In November of the same year Lisette was elected as deputy to the French National Assembly. In February 1947 he founded the country's first African political party, the Chadian Progressive Party (PPT), a radical and nationalist organization calling for self-determination. It was a branch of the Marxist- oriented inter-territorial African Democratic Rally, of which he was to be later chosen as secretary-general. The PPT was not immediately successful, as it found itself boycotted by the French colonial administration and from the African traditional rulers, who preferred the more conservative Chadian Democratic Union (UDT). The situation radically changed with the French Overseas Reform Act of 1956 which greatly expanded the electoral suffrage. Also, the UDT was riven by splits and dissensions; as a result, Lisette triumphantly won the 1957 elections for the Territorial Assembly, taking with his allies 47 seats out of 65. Following this victory Lisette became first on 14 May 1957, Vice-President, and then, on 26 July 1958, President of the Government Council. He kept this position until he was deserted by the African traditional rulers, who supported a motion of no confidence presented on 11 February 1959, behind which was Ahmed Koulamallah. Lisette was able to immediately throw-down the two succeeding governments led by Gontchom√© Sahoulba and Koulamallah, but when the PPT had again to form the government he stepped down in favour of a native Chadian, the party's secretary-general Fran√ßois Tombalbaye, who became head of the government on 26 March. Lisette entered the government as deputy Prime Minister in charge of economic coordination and foreign affairs. But Lisette's fall was nearing: a week before Chad became independent on 11 August 1960, Tombalbaye purged him from the PPT, declared him a noncitizen while he was traveling abroad, and barred him from returning to Chad. This event signed the end of Lisette's political career in Chad, and Lisette went in exile in France, where he had been named on 23 July 1959 \\"councillor minister\\" in the government guided by Michel Debr√©, a formal charge he would keep till 19 May 1961. In exile he continued to worry Tombalbaye as a possible menace for his regime, especially from 1971 when relations between France and Chad started cooling. In 1976 he founded with Alain Girard a non-governmental organization, the Soci√©t√© mutuelle des originaires d'Outre-Mer (SMODOM), with in mind the mutual aid societies active in Europe in the 19th century. As those, its main finalities were to create a society whose members covered the expenses if one of them was ill or, if dead, could not afford a funeral. He later wrote a book on the events to which he participated, Le Combat du Rassemblement d√©mocratique African pour la d√©colonisation pacifique de l'Afrique noire. He died at Port-de-Lanne, in France, on 3 March 2001.

She specialized in Scandinavian dancing.  Early Life & Education  The daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Roy Farwell, she was born on her family farm near Ridgeway, Wisconsin. After graduating from Central High School in Madison, Wisconsin, she created a major in \\"rural community leadership\\" and graduated with honors in 1938 from Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio.  Career  In 1938, she was a physical education instructor at a high school in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania. Soon thereafter, she became an extension recreation specialist in West Virginia, working with Oglebay Park's Oglebay Institute. She took a four-month leave of absence from that position in 1943 in order to become program director of a new United Service Organizations club in Tucson, Arizona. Deciding that folk dancing was going to be the main thrust of her recreational program, she became \\"the 'Johnny Appleseed' of folk dance camps\\", establishing the country‚Äôs first folk dance camps, including those in Ohio, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. She is credited as one of the founders of the modern folk dance movement, whose enthusiasts in the United States came to number in the thousands. In 1955, Farwell married Jergen Hinrichs, a young farmer from Germany, who was doing an internship on her father‚Äôs Ridgeway farm. The couple moved to Germany where she lived in Ostfriesland for 11 years. Throughout Germany, and in Switzerland, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, and Turkey, she continued to teach folk dancing and to study European folklore. In 1956, Jane was invited to tour Japan together with four other well-known folk dance leaders. In 1966, Farwell returned to Wisconsin, and purchased the old Wakefield School near Ridgeway, on an acre of land which her grandfather had donated to the county back in the early 1880s. There she created and directed Folklore Village ‚Äî the culmination of her ideas about festivals, folklore, dance, recreation, community, and the land. In 1988, Farwell and her Folklore Village community realized their dream of building a larger space to house the cultural activities expressed through dance, music, craft, and foodways traditions‚ÄîFarwell Hall, a large barn-like structure that contains an acclaimed dance floor, a certified kitchen, classrooms, a gallery, and office space.  Death  On April 6, 1993, Farwell died of complications of cancer at age 77. She deeded her family farm‚Äîlands and buildings‚Äî to Folklore Village, where her work to promote opportunities for individuals and communities to honor, experience, and support ethnic and traditional folklife continues to this day.  Legacy  Festivals are the heart of Folklore Village. From 1947 (when she began the Christmas Festival) to 1966, Farwell directed her original Festival of Christmas and Midwinter Traditions in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, in order to combat the growing commercialization of Christmas and the ignorance of increasing numbers of young people about the diverse pageantry, foods, and music of Christmas. Folklore Village continues to present some of Jane‚Äôs original festivals, as well as others that have grown organically from their diverse community base. In 2016, Folklore Village presented six festivals ‚Äì a Spring Scandinavian Music and Dance Weekend, an English Country Dance & Music Weekend, a Cajun Music and Dance Weekend, a Fall Swedish Music and Dance Weekend, the 69th Festival of Christmas and Midwinter Traditions, and their newest festival ‚Äì Sustainability Weekend. All embody Farwell‚Äôs original vision of a place where people can come to dance, sing, play music, eat, and live folk customs from the world over. In 2016, Folklore Village celebrated Farwell‚Äôs centennial, recognized by the joint state legislature and Governor Scott Walker; and marked by special events, a reunion weekend, and the publication of the Folklore Village Cookbook.

It was intended as a tongue-in-cheek look at the devices used by cartoonists. In it, Walker invented an international set of symbols called symbolia after researching cartoons around the world. In 1964, Walker had written an article called \\"Let's Get Down to Grawlixes\\", a satirical piece for the National Cartoonists Society. He used terms such as grawlixes for his own amusement, but they soon began to catch on and acquired an unexpected validity. The Lexicon was written in response to this.

Shortly after she vanished, her car was discovered parked around a mile from her home. A local security camera recorded a person who could not be identified parking Kesse's car and walking away. The case received local and national press attention.  Prior events  A graduate of Vivian Gaither High School in Tampa, Florida, Kesse attended the University of Central Florida in Orlando and graduated in 2003 with a degree in finance. At the time of her disappearance, she was working as a finance manager at Central Florida Investments Timeshare Company in Ocoee and had recently bought a condominium home in Orlando. The weekend before she vanished, Kesse had vacationed with her boyfriend on Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. Returning on the Sunday, she stayed that night at her boyfriend's home, then drove straight to work on the morning of Monday, January 23, 2006.  Disappearance  Kesse was seen for the last time leaving work at approximately 6 p.m. on January 23, 2006. She spoke by phone with her father while driving home at around 6:15, and then with her boyfriend at around 10:00 p.m. She was in the habit of texting or telephoning her boyfriend before leaving for work, so it was unusual when she did neither the next morning. His call to her went to voicemail. When Kesse failed to arrive at work, her employer contacted her parents, who began the two-hour drive from their home to hers. Her parents noticed that her car was missing but saw nothing out of the ordinary in her home. A wet towel and clothes laid out, among other things, suggested that she had showered, dressed, and prepared for work that morning. Friends and family distributed fliers about Kesse that evening, and the Orlando Police Department organized search parties on foot and on horseback, as well as by boat, helicopter, car, and ATV. =Timeline= Timestamps are approximate and based on witness statements. Monday, January 23, 2006 * 6:00 p.m. Kesse leaves work and calls her parents, the last time her family hears from her. She arrives home for the first time since having left for vacation. * 10:00 p.m. Kesse and her boyfriend talk by phone and say their goodnights. He is the last known person to speak with her before her disappearance. Tuesday, January 24, 2006 * 7:30 a.m. ‚Äì 8:00 a.m. Investigators initially believed that Kesse was abducted as she was walking from her front door to her car. They now believe that she left, and was abducted at some point on her way to work.fox35orlando.com * 8:00 a.m. ‚Äì 9:00 a.m. Kesse's boyfriend, who normally would have heard from her, calls her on the way to work but it goes directly to voicemail. He chalks it up to a meeting she had mentioned to him. His subsequent attempts are likewise unsuccessful. Kesse's parents call him to say that she had failed to show up at work. * 11:00 a.m. Alarmed at Kesse's uncharacteristic no call, no show, her employer contacts her parents, who begin the drive from Tampa to Orlando. On the way, they call to ask the manager of her condominium to check her home with a spare key. He reports that everything appears normal inside and that her car is missing outside. * 12:00 p.m. Only from Kesse's home, surveillance cameras at an apartment complex record a person in the act of parking her car and walking away. The car and footage are not discovered until two days later. * 3:00 p.m ‚Äì 3.15 p.m. Kesse's parents and brother arrive at her apartment. They find evidence that she had been home that morning. They call the police. As Kesse is an adult, police initially hold that she may have left of her own volition. * 5:00 p.m. ‚Äì 7:00 p.m. Family and friends saturate the area with fliers that show Kesse's picture. The police send a detective to her home and begin interrogations and searches. Thursday, January 26, 2006 * 8:10 a.m. Seeing Kesse's car on the news, a tenant of a nearby complex informs the police that it has sat abandoned in front of their apartment for several days. Police confirm that it is Kesse's 2004 Chevy Malibu. The vehicle is photographed and taken for forensic examination. Police examine local surveillance footage and discover an unidentified person parking her car and walking away.  Investigation  The person of interest who parked Kesse's car was captured by a surveillance camera that snapped a photo once every three seconds. To the dismay of investigators, all three captures of the subject in frame had the suspect's face obscured by the fencing. With no sign of forced entry or a struggle, investigators initially theorized that on the morning of January 24 Kesse left her apartment for work and locked her front door, only to be abducted at some point while walking toward or getting into her car. On January 26, around 8:10 a.m., her black 2004 Chevrolet Malibu was found parked at another apartment complex about a mile from her own. Investigators were excited to learn that several hidden cameras at the apartments surveilled the part of the lot where the car had been parked as well as the exit. The surveillance footage showed an unidentified \\"person of interest\\" dropping Kesse's vehicle off at approximately noon the day she went missing. None of her family or friends recognized the person, whose physical features were not clear on the video. Investigators were disheartened to find that the best video capture of this subject, in three separate snapshots, was obscured by the complex fencing, the posts aligning to conceal the face. One journalist called the suspect \\"The luckiest person of interest ever\\". The FBI was called in to help determine the person's size and gender, but could only say that the person stood between 5'3\\" and 5'5\\". NASA also enhanced the video to help identify the suspect. Detectives interpreted the valuables left inside the car to imply that robbery was not a motive in the case. A search dog tracked a scent that led from her parked car back to her apartment complex, prompting detectives to believe that the suspect might have returned to her apartment's parking lot after abandoning the car. No other evidence was found along the route. A forensic examination of the car yielded little in the way of evidence, only a latent print and a small DNA fiber. Investigators deduced that the car had been wiped down. The following items are known to be missing: her cell phone, her iPod, her keys, her purse, her briefcase, and the outfit she was wearing. Authorities were unable to ping her cellphone, its power remaining off. Her bank account keycard has not been used since her disappearance. As is customary, investigators first questioned Kesse's immediate family and close friends, to see if any of them could have had a motive to abduct her. Her ex-boyfriend, recently upset and wishing to get back together with her, was also interrogated, but it was concluded that he had nothing to do with her abduction. Her current boyfriend was also questioned but his alibi checked out, eliminating him as a suspect. At the time of her disappearance, Kesse's condominium complex had been undergoing a major expansion, and many of the laborers on site were non-English speaking. Kesse had told family members on several occasions that the construction workers constantly catcalled, whistled at, and harassed her. Due to the language barrier, investigators were unable to interrogate many of them. No other leads regarding them were discovered. Detectives then turned their focus to her place of employment and began questioning her coworkers. Her computer was taken for forensic examination. It was learned that a manager where she worked had desired a relationship with her, but that she had refused his advances because she was against workplace relationships. Detectives interviewed him multiple times but ultimately ruled him out as a suspect. Investigators and Kesse's friends and family remain open to the theory that she fell victim to human trafficking but consider it less likely than others. In May 2007, Kesse's company, led by David A. Siegel, offered a $1 million reward for information leading to her whereabouts, with a July 4 deadline and the stipulation that she had to be alive. It was never claimed. A $5,000 reward for information leading to the whereabouts of her remains was available through Central Florida Crimeline. The case received state and national press attention at the time of her disappearance. She is still considered missing and endangered by the Orlando Police Department, FBI, Orange County Police, FDLE, NCIC, NCMA, and Interpol. On May 2, 2008, the Florida House of Representatives unanimously passed Senate Bill 502, \\"The Jennifer Kesse and Tiffany Sessions Missing Persons Act\\", to reform how missing-persons cases are handled in Florida.laws.flrules.org As of June 10, 2010, the FBI has taken the case over from the Orlando Police Department; it did so at the urging of police chief Val Demings. Kesse remains on the FBI's Most Wanted/Missing List. The latest search for her took place in February 2014, and investigators continue to receive and pursue leads.

History and profile The first issue of Aku Ankka was published on 5 December 1951 and sold 34,017 copies. The first issue, with a special Christmas theme, and the Snow White story published later in the 1950s are very prized collectors' items and can fetch a price of several thousand euros on the collector market. The magazine was published monthly until 1956, twice a month between 1956 and 1960, and every Wednesday since 1961. Aku Ankka is published by Sanoma Media (formerly Sanoma Magazines), which is part of Sanoma. Despite being part of a multinational franchise and despite most stories being translations into Finnish of stories first published abroad, Aku Ankka has become a cultural icon in Finland. This is largely due to the magazine's colourful and innovative use of the Finnish language. Many characters' names are Finnish language spoofs of the names of celebrities. In 2001, in recognition of its work for the Finnish language, the editorial team was given the Kielihelmi award by the Finnish language department of the University of Helsinki.The Finnish language department of the University of Helsinki , Retrieved 17 November 2006. The Aku Ankka comic is now more popular in Finland than in the country of its origin, the United States (where Disney is better known for its cartoons and films than comics). The US Donald Duck cartoonist Don Rosa is exceptionally popular in Finland, and he has acknowledged this by creating The Quest for Kalevala, a Donald Duck story specifically set in Finland. There is a popular urban legend that Donald Duck was once banned in Finland for not wearing pants. This myth was sparked by an incident in 1977, when Helsinki councilman Markku Holopainen proposed discontinuing the use of city funds to subscribe to Aku Ankka comics for youth centers, due to the city's financial difficulties. The following year, when Holopainen was running for a parliament seat, his opponent called him \\"the man who banned Donald Duck from Helsinki\\", and Holopainen lost the election. A similar incident had taken place a few years earlier in Kemi, and international reports exaggerated the situation in claims that the character's attire and his extramarital relationship with Daisy Duck were the causes of the local ban. Circulation Aku Ankka is one of the most popular weekly publications in Finland as well as the world's largest edition per capita of a Donald Duck magazine. It had a circulation of 320,500 in 2006, 324,000 in 2007,YLE.fi: Aku Ankka teki uuden levikkienn√§tyksen and 306,555 in 2010. Its circulation of 282,794 in 2012 made it the third most popular magazine in Finland. When 260,455 copies were sold in 2013, it became the best-selling Finnish magazine.

Frosted Mini Wheats History Kelloggs introduced Frosted Mini-Wheats in the United States in 1969 as a large size portion that was available in regular and brown sugar/cinnamon flavor, later followed by a bite-size portion introduced in 1980. The original large size Mini-Wheats was renamed \\"Big Bite\\" by 2001 and discontinued entirely in 2015. In 1999, Kellogg's went into the line by introducing a non-frosted Mini-Wheats variety that contained raisin filling, replacing Raisin Squares. It was discontinued in two years. Frosted Wheats were available from the 1980s until the early 1990s in the United Kingdom under the Toppas name. They subsequently disappeared from shop shelves but were reissued several years later under the Frosted Wheats brand, similar to that used elsewhere in the world. The new cereal uses far smaller pieces of frosted wheat parcel than the original Toppas and contains beef gelatin. Initially Kellogg's Mini-Wheats were available without the sugar frosting and with raisins or blueberries in the center. The Mini-Wheats recipe when produced in Canada or the United States was slightly different. Since January 2008, Canadian-produced (plant in Belleville, Ontario) Mini-Wheats are available in Canada and are imported into the US. Advertising=US= Frosted Mini-Wheats are marketed variously. They tolerated a short stint on television advertisements with a series of commercials about one Frosted Mini- Wheat with \\"split personalities;\\" the sweet (frosted) side and wheat (shredded grain) side argued over who was more popular. When the new MyPyramid debuted, launching the whole grain craze, it enjoyed another short-lived advertising stint as a fiber-conscious cereal. These advertisements involved a man walking around, asking \\"Have you had your fiber today?\\", then handing unsuspecting, confused people a bowl of the cereal. However, these ads have discontinued. Meanwhile, in the early/mid-1990s, several ads aired showcasing conflict between children raving about the frosting and adults raving about the whole grain wheat. The best-known of these \\"The Kid in You\\" ads feature adults turning into children and kids turning into adults (actress Marcia Wallace appears in one of those \\"Kid in Us\\" spots, and one used the famous line from When Harry Met Sally..., \\"I'll have what she's having.\\", which was said by an elderly woman sitting next to a young businesswoman who turned into a 13-year- old girl in front of her). Current advertising involves Frosted Mini-Wheats helping children in various childhood situations. In one, a girl in a spelling bee retracts a letter after speaking it and passes, despite the fact that it is against the rules in an actual Spelling Bee competition. Another has the Mini-Wheat helping a girl keep time to a dance in a school play. It promotes eating breakfast in general. The tagline says, \\"Keeps 'em [your kids] full, and keeps 'em focused.\\" The Federal Trade Commission found fault with Kellogg's claims that Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal improved kids' attentiveness by nearly 20%. The consumer protection agency said that Kellogg's had misrepresented a study and violated federal law.Carey, Susan. Snap, Crackle, Slap: FTC Objects to Kellogg's Rice Krispies Health Claim. The Wall Street Journal. 4 June 2010.UPDATE 2-Kellogg changes ads for Frosted Mini-Wheats - FTC. Reuters. 21 April 2009. In 2009, Kelloggs introduced a \\"Little Bites\\" spinoff of the Mini-Wheats brand. This version had smaller squares and came in three flavors: Original, Chocolate, and Honey Nut. Eventually, the Honey Nut flavor was taken off of shelves and replaced with Cinnamon Roll, which was also short-lived. In 2011, Kelloggs introduced Frosted Mini-Wheats with Fruit in the Middle, which features strawberries and blueberries in the center. These are similar to the original Strawberry Mini-Wheats that Kellogg's sold in the 1990s which contained strawberry filling in the middle, as well as Raisin Squares and its successor Mini-Wheats Raisin, and Fruit Wheats, a variant of Nabisco Shredded Wheat made in the 1980s. =Canada= An ad for Mini-Wheats that aired in Canada in the early-1990s featured an animated \\"Mr. Mini-Wheat\\" (voiced by John Stocker) about to go on a blind date. After experiencing some pre-date anxiety, a disembodied voice convinces Mr. Mini- Wheat that between his wholesome wheatiness and his frosted side, he has much to offer. Now quite confident, Mr. Mini-Wheat sets off for his date, proclaiming that \\"She'll be my love slave forever!\\". This line was quickly changed to \\"She'll be my true love forever!\\" for later airings. More recently, an advertisement for Vanilla flavored Mini-Wheats featured an animated Mr. Mini-Wheat singing and dancing to a tune based on \\"Agadoo\\" by Black Lace. The success of the commercial prompted several more in this series: * Strawberry Flavour: Mr. Mini-Wheat sings with a 1960s rock-and-roll band. * Whole Wheat: Mr. Mini-Wheat sings in a 1970s disco club. * Blueberry Muffin: Mr. Mini-Wheat sings to the tune of Galop Inferno. * Cinnamon Streusel Varieties Bite Size Frosted Strawberry Delight Frosted Mini-Wheats currently come in the following varieties: * Bite Size Frosted Maple Brown Sugar * Bite Size Frosted Blueberry (formerly named Blueberry Muffin) * Bite Size Frosted Original * Bite Size Pumpkin Spice (seasonal) * Bite Size Frosted Strawberry (formerly named Strawberry Delight) * Unfrosted Mini-Wheats * Little Bites Original * Little Bites Chocolate * Touch of Fruit in the Middle Raspberry (US) * Centres Mixed Berry (Canada)MINI-WHEATS Products Page.

He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. An alumnus of Paul Quinn College, Cooper played nine seasons for the Detroit Stars and ten seasons for the Kansas City Monarchs. The Texan was tall and weighed . In defiance of a threatened five- year Negro league ban for contract jumping, Cooper joined a 1927 barnstorming team that toured Hawaii and Japan. He spent most of his later career with the Monarchs. Cooper is the Negro league record holder for career saves. In a 1937 playoff game, he pitched 17 innings. Cooper served as manager or player- manager for the Monarchs from 1937 to 1940, leading the team to the pennant three times during those four seasons. Early life Cooper was born in Waco, Texas, where he attended A. J. Moore High School. He continued his education in Waco at Paul Quinn College (the school moved to Dallas in 1990). Career=Early career= Cooper pitched for the Detroit Stars from 1920 to 1927. The Stars played in Mack Park, which was noted for its short fences. Despite the hitter-friendly dimensions of the park, Cooper excelled as a pitcher in Detroit. The short fences often allowed Detroit's powerful hitters to provide good run support for Cooper. In The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, James characterized Cooper as the best Negro league pitcher of 1923. Cooper was traded to the Kansas City Monarchs for five players in 1928. He became known for his durability as a pitcher. To open the 1928 season, the left-hander pitched a two-hit shutout against the Cleveland Tigers, which he followed with a 4-3 win over the Tigers the next day. =Later career= Cooper returned to the Stars for another season in 1930. In nine years with the Stars, he earned a 92-47 record. He rejoined the Monarchs in 1931. One of his best years was 1936, when he went 27‚Äì8 against all levels of competition. He made his only All-Star appearance that season, as Negro league All-Star games had not been played until three years earlier. Cooper became player- manager of the Monarchs in 1937. The Monarchs joined the newly formed Negro American League (NAL) that year. Nearing the end of his career, Cooper pitched 17 innings in a playoff game that year versus the Chicago American Giants. Cooper gave up two runs in the first inning of the game, but he pitched 16 subsequent scoreless innings. In Black Baseball in Kansas City, Cooper was described as having \\"more junk than Fred Sanford\\", but he walked only one batter. The game was declared a tie after the 17th inning, but the Monarchs won the playoff series four games to one with the one tie. Cooper became known for his ability to alter the speed of his pitches. He threw a fastball, a curveball and a screwball. He also had a well-known pickoff move. He posted a 116‚Äì57 career record and went 72‚Äì30 over a six-year span. He often pitched three games in a five-game series, starting two and relieving another. He holds the Negro league career record for saves (29). Negro league historian Dick Clark called Cooper the greatest pitcher to play for Detroit, either for the Stars or the Tigers. By 1940, Cooper had managed the team to three pennants. Negro league star Buck O'Neil said that Cooper and Kansas City owner J. L. Wilkinson were responsible for O'Neil joining the NAL and ultimately becoming a member of the Monarchs. In 1937, Cooper and Wilkinson were impressed by O'Neil but the team had a first baseman who was returning from an injury. They encouraged O'Neil to sign with the Memphis Red Sox. The Monarchs traded their first baseman the next year and purchased O'Neil's contract from Memphis. =Winter leagues and barnstorming teams= Cooper also played several seasons of winter baseball. He played in Cuba during the winters of 1923-24, 1924‚Äì25 and 1928‚Äì29; he compiled a 15-17 record there. By 1927, player pay had been cut and morale was low in the NNL and the Eastern Colored League (ECL). To limit the options of the players, the leagues announced a five-year ban on any contract-jumping players. Cooper and three other Negro league players - Biz Mackey, Rap Dixon and Frank Duncan - decided to test the ban. They joined a traveling all-star team, the Philadelphia Royal Giants, in a four-month barnstorming tour of Japan. The team traveled by ocean liner and it took 20 days to arrive in Japan. On their return, they played some games in Honolulu. The team won all 23 games they played on the tour. Upon his return, Cooper received a 30-day suspension and a $200 fine. Cooper went barnstorming in the Pacific with the Royal Giants in 1932-33. The team earned a 47-2-1 record as they visited the Philippines, China, Korea and Japan. Cooper recorded a .342 batting average on the trip. The next year, he accompanied the Royal Giants to Japan, China, the Philippines and Hawaii for a four-month, 35-game trip. Personal Cooper had one son, Andy Cooper Jr. Illness and death According to reports in the Chicago Defender, Cooper reportedly suffered a stroke early in the 1941 pre-season. He left for his home in Waco to rest and recover, leaving Newt Allen as interim manager, but suffered a fatal heart attack on June 3, having never returned to the Monarchs. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Waco. Legacy Cooper was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. His Hall of Fame class included 17 black players and executives from the Negro league or pre-Negro league eras. A special committee had been formed that year to select the group, and it narrowed down a pool of 39 candidates to arrive at the final selections. The 109th United States Congress issued a resolution that year honoring the 2006 Negro league and pre-Negro league inductees. As of 2014, Cooper is one of eleven inductees whose plaques do not depict them wearing a cap with a team logo. In 2014, Cooper made the final ballot for election to the Texas Sports Hall of Fame.

The song refers to the Victory Day (9 May) celebration and differs from most of these by its cheerful intonations of a marching song and by the fact that it was composed some thirty years after the war. In the words of Vladimir Shainsky, a veteran composer, \\"the song seemed to have turned back the time. Although written three decades after the war, it now seems that it was this song that helped us to gain the victory\\". History In order to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Soviet victory in the Second World War, the Soviet government announced a competition for the best song about the war. In March 1975, poet Vladimir Kharitonov, who had taken part in the war, approached his traditional co-author, the young composer David Tukhmanov with a proposal to write a new song for the occasion. This effort was to differ strikingly from their previous collaborations, which had been disco-influenced chartbusters. Several days before the deadline, Kharitonov brought his lyric to Tukhmanov and the latter composed a song just in time to be recorded track of an orchestra. His wife Tatyana Sashko (the singer and the lyricist) sang Den Pobedy before the jury. However, the jury, composed primarily of elderly songwriters whose tastes had been formed during Stalin's era, was exceedingly displeased with the result. The lyrics appeared to them lightsome and frivolous, while the melody was alleged to abuse the \\"rhythms of tango and foxtrot\\", two \\"bourgeois\\" dances which had been banned in the Soviet Union. Although the performance of the song was strongly discouraged, Lev Leshchenko, one of the most popular Soviet singers, dared to premiere it during his concert in Alma-Ata in late April. Then the song was performed in the Little Blue Light TV show on 9 May by another singer (Leonid Smetannikov)), but his interpretation was rather lackluster and failed to attract attention. Thereupon the song was not performed until 10 November when Leshchenko revived it for a grand concert (and live in Soviet television) in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses on the Militsiya Day. His performance astounded the censors but proved to be a runaway success with the audience, who clamored for an encore. Since then, the song has been invariably performed during every Victory Day celebrations in the Soviet Union and Russia, often concluding a program of festivities, with the last stanza drowned in sounds of fireworks over the Red Square. According to Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev liked this song greatly, especially when performed by Joseph Kobzon, and predicted to Kharitonov that \\"folks would sing this tune for many years after you and I are gone\\". Brezhnev's expectation did not fail to materialize, in part because, as the US-American researcher David MacFadyen explains, \\"this powerful song draws not upon the bravery of youthful soldiers but the private memories of ageing, greying veterans. Its poignant combination of joy at a stunning victory and sadness at great loss sounds just as relevant today, when the war itself is something about which many young Russians neither know nor care\\".David MacFadyen.

Delany. It is often published together with another book, most frequently (three times) with The Ballad of Beta-2. Delany hoped to have it first published as part of an Ace Double with Babel-17, but instead it was published with Tree Lord of Imeten by Tom Purdom. It was finally bundled with Babel-17 in a 2001 reprint. The story revolves around the protagonist, Comet Jo, and a narrator named Jewel. Nominally a tale of Comet Jo‚Äôs coming-of-age, his education into galactic society (and as such can be considered a mini-Bildungsroman), his efforts to deliver an important message to Empire Star, and the attempt to bring an end to slavery, the story has several layered loops of events which run back upon themselves‚Äîand the concepts, layering, and ordering of the events are as important as the story itself. Plot summary As the narrative opens, we meet Comet Jo at eighteen years of age. He has spent his entire life in a \\"simplex\\" society on Rhys, a satellite of a Jovian planet orbiting Tau Ceti. (At first it might seem that \\"simplex\\" means \\"simple\\" or \\"unintelligent,\\" but after Jo's encounter with the \\"Geodesic Survey Station\\" at the latest, it will be clear the notion is much more complicated.) Jo comes upon the wreckage of a spacecraft and encounters two survivors. The first is quickly dying and asks Jo to bring an important message to Empire Star moments before passing away. The other is a lifeform known as Jewel. Jewel is a tritovian in crystallized form, and in that state can easily view situations from several points of view, thus enabling narration from the point of view of the omniscient observer. Jo quickly leaves Rhys in an attempt to deliver the message to Empire Star, and on his journey he meets several other characters along with a race of creatures known as the Lll. The Lll are incredible builders‚Äînot merely of structures, but of ecosystems, societies, and ethical systems. As such, they have been enslaved. However, in order to protect the Lll, the Empire has created a phenomenon known as ‚Äúthe sadness of the Lll‚Äù‚Äîany being who owns the Lll suffers from a constant, overpowering sadness. This sadness increases geometrically with each Lll owned and with how much each Lll builds, so it is only possible to own a few Lll at a time. Indeed, just being in the presence of the Lll is a heartbreaking experience for even non-owners, a lesson that Jo learns early in his travels. The story then follows Jo over the next few months. Once he reaches a certain point in his maturity, knowledge, and ability to perceive events around him, the linear narrative stops and the reader is left with a few pages of important events not arranged in a strict order; by this point, the reader may have learned enough to sort out the tangle. Along the way, several questions are raised, either explicitly or implicitly. What is the message that Comet Jo must deliver? Who is coming to free the Lll? Will the Lll ever actually be freed? Is the story a closed loop, or is there indeed an end (or at least a point at which events move on past the ones mentioned in the story)? Who, exactly, entered the Empire Star? How many of the events of the story are arranged by those people? Characters * Comet Jo: Eighteen years old, the product of a simplex culture. * Jewel: A tritovian (presumably a non-human life form) who spends most of the story in a passive, crystallized form. Jewel is also the narrator of the tale. * Charona: The guardian of the gate to the spaceport, Charona and her pet 3-Dog are quite obviously a mythological reference to Charon and Cerberus. Charona is the first person in Empire Star to tell Jo about the concept of simplex/complex/multiplex. Who is San Severina in her old age * San Severina: Owner of seven Lll‚Äîfar more than any being has ever owned before‚Äîwho must rebuild eight worlds (along with fifty-two civilizations and thirty-two thousand three hundred and fifty-seven complete and distinct ethical systems) ravaged by war. San Severina is Jo's first tutor in the ways of galactic society. She helps Jo to move past his simplex upbringing and sets him on the path to becoming a multiplex being. * Oscar/The Lump: short for Linguistic Ubiquitous Multiplex, Lump is an artificial lifeform with a Lll-based consciousness and is Comet Jo's companion for much of the text. Towards the end of the story we learn that the Lll whose consciousness Lump is based on is none other than Muels Aranlyde. (\\"Muels Aranlyde\\" is an anagram of \\"Samuel R. Delany\\".) The LUMp said his use of \\"Oscar\\" was a literary allusion and since the person he originally claimed to be waiting for was Alfred Douglas, he is alluding to Oscar Wilde, Douglas's friend and lover. * Ni Ty Lee: A young poet who seems to have experienced all that Jo, or anyone else for that matter, has experienced. He is implied to be homosexual. * The Princess: stowaway on a military vessel headed for Empire Star. She is two years younger than Jo when they first meet, but she turns out to be a young San Severina.

Procedure by provisional order is a substitute for the more expensive course of private bill legislation; it is usually employed for such purposes as alteration of areas, compulsory purchase of land and building of light railways. A preliminary local inquiry is first held in public by an inspector of the department to whom application has been made to issue it. Upon the report of the inspector and other information, the department decides whether or not to issue the order. The order when issued has no force until it is confirmed by parliament. For this purpose it is included with other orders in a confirming bill, introduced by the minister at the head of the department concerned. In both houses of parliament all provisional order bills are referred to examiners for compliance with standing orders. In the House of Lords, if a provisional order bill is opposed, it is referred to a select committee and then to a committee of the whole house; if not opposed, it goes, after second reading, to a committee of the whole house, and in both cases then proceeds as a public bill. In the House of Commons, the bill goes after second reading to the committee of selection or to the general committee on railway and canal bills; if unopposed it is treated as an unopposed private bill; if opposed it goes to a private bill committee, which hears evidence for and against.

This was likely done for Bishop Hosius of C√≥rdoba. Very little is otherwise known of him. His translation of the Timaeus was the only extensive text of Plato known to scholars in the Latin West for approximately 800 years.Edward Grant, (2004), Science and Religion, 400 B.C. to A.D. 1550, pages 93‚Äì4. Greenwood Publishing Group His commentary also contained useful accounts of Greek astronomical knowledge. In the 12th century commentaries on this work were written by Christian scholars including HisdosusTerence Irwin, (1995), Classical philosophy: collected papers, page 206. Taylor & Francis and philosophers of the Chartres School, such as Thierry of Chartres and William of Conches. Interpreting it in the light of the Christian faith, the academics in the School of Chartres understood the dialogue to refer to creation ex nihilo.  Calcidius' life and philosophical sources  Direct evidence of Calcidius' biographical details are almost nil and we have only his translation and commentary of Plato's Timaeus as evidence for his philosophical views. Calcidius' name appears to have been Greek in origin and some linguistic evidence in his translations suggest Calcidius might have been predominantly a Greek-speaker rather than a native Latin one. He certainly paraphrases or directly quotes from a range of Greek sources, including Homer, Hesiod, and Euripides, in addition to Latin ones such as Terence and Virgil, suggesting a bilingual education. However, there is ultimately not enough evidence to locate a geographic origin for Calcidius. Calcidius‚Äô commentaries suggest some influence of Middle Platonism, and some scholars also detect influence from Porphyry although others downplay his influence on Calcidius. Multiple features of his commentary have been traced to Theon of Smyrna, Alcinous‚Äô Didaskalikos, works attributed to the Pseudo- Plutarch, Philo of Alexandria, Origen, as well as the Neopythagorean Numenius. In general however, these influences only suggest that Calcidius relied on various Middle Platonic sources to interpret Plato's dialogue and do not conclusively demonstrate Calcidius' own philosophical leanings. Calcidius appears to have expressed no bias towards Christianity in his works on Plato, and neither does he express any hostility towards Christian dogma generally. In his commentaries, Calcidius makes no explicit link between the Christian creation narrative found in Genesis and the Platonic one in the Timaeus dialogue.  Translation of the Timaeus  Calcidius' translation of Plato's original Greek dialogue covers the sections 17a ‚Äì 53c, i.e. from the Introduction where Critias discusses the story of Solon's journey to Egypt where he hears the tale of Atlantis, up to the discussion of the 'Receptacle' and the Divine Creator's use of four of the five regular solids (fire, earth, air and water) in the shaping of the Universe. The date of the work appears to be around the first half of the 4th century A.D. The impetus for producing the translation and commentary could have arisen from an invitation by Osius (or Hosius), Bishop of Cordoba, who participated in the ecumenical councils of Nicea and Serdica in 325 and 343 B.C. Calcidius' opening dedicatory epistle seems to be addressed to an 'Osius' although there are at least five different historical figures to whom this name could be ascribed. The translation itself is generally literal with some stylistic additions on Calcidius' part. The influence of Calcidius‚Äô translation on the Middle Ages was immense, perhaps more significant than even Cicero's version (composed c. 45 B.C.) However, scholars are not in agreement as to whether Calcidius relied on Cicero's translation for his own and the current opinion seems to be that there are no substantial parallels with Cicero's translation in Calcidius‚Äô work. Others doubt this claim, as in Ratkowitsch, who argues that not just single lexical items but also entire clauses from Cicero's version are echoed in Calcidius' translation. Calcidius‚Äô options when it came to expressing a Greek term from Plato's original for which Latin had no equivalent included: transliteration of the term without an explanation (e.g. noys for ŒΩŒø·ø¶œÇ), deployment of some neologism coined in Cicero's earlier version (e.g. medietas for ŒºŒµœÉœåœÑŒ∑œÇ), or lexical innovation where he coins his own term as the most suitable equivalent in Latin (e.g. adunatio for œÉœÖŒΩŒ±œÅŒºœåœÑœÑŒøŒΩ). = Manuscript tradition = The first extant manuscripts of both Cicero's and Calcidius' Latin versions of the Timaeus, as well as the original Greek version (Paris BNF MS grec. 1807), can be dated to the 9th century A.D. The relevant manuscripts of Calcidius' translation and commentary are the Valenciennes, Bibl. municipale MS 293; Lyons, Bibl. municipale MS 324; and Vatican City, BAV MS Reg. Lat. 1068 (which contains only the dialogue and no commentary). There are only two extant manuscripts preserved from the 10th century A.D.: the Paris, BnF MS lat. 2164 and the Brussels, BR MS 9625‚Äì9626. From the 11th century A.D. onwards, a significant increase in the production of manuscripts containing Calcidius' translation and commentary began to appear in Europe with 17 versions appearing in the 11th century, 5 in the 12th century, 3 in the 13th century, 2 in the 14th century and 11 in the 15th century. Many of these manuscripts contained glosses by various medieval scribes and annotators to clarify and expand upon the concepts discussed in Calcidius' work. ReferencesFurther reading *Bakhouce. B.

They ask Nick if he would like to go to Strangeday Hall, an institution for criminals aged under 18, and befriend inmate Johnny Powers, a gang leader known as \\"Public Enemy Number One\\" following his recent conviction and 15-year prison sentence for armed robbery. They want Nick to find out the true identity of an unknown master criminal who controls all the buying and selling of stolen goods in London, known only as \\"the Fence\\". Nick refuses their offer and the police leave. Soon afterwards, Nick visits Woburn Abbey on a school trip, but is framed for attempting to steal the Woburn Carbuncles, and despite his attempts to evade police, is arrested and sentenced to 18 months at Strangeday Hall. He has to share a cell with Johnny Powers - just as Snape and Boyle wanted, and no doubt arranged, to happen. Soon after he arrives, Snape and Boyle visit Nick and reveal that they arranged to have Nick framed. Nick manages to gain Johnny's trust after he saves Johnny from being killed by three followers of a notorious London gangster known as Big Ed. Nick and Johnny soon escape Strangeday Hall with the help of Tim Diamond, Nick's brother (an unsuccessful private detective), and Ma Powers, Johnny's mother. They are pursued by the police but manage to escape. However, during the chase, Snape and Boyle appear and their car crashes and explodes, leaving Nick convinced that they are both dead and that he's the only person alive who knows he's innocent. Nick and Tim stay at Johnny's hideout in Wapping for a while, until Nick overhears Johnny telling Ma that he is going to see \\"Penelope\\". Believing Penelope to be the Fence, Nick follows Johnny into the Wapping tube station but loses him there. After making his way out onto the street, he is then captured by henchmen of Big Ed, who later tie him to a train track, intending for him to be killed by a train. Nick is rescued by a man who cuts him free from the tracks just before the train passes. Nick knows that he had seen that man before, but doesn't know where, and the man has quickly disappeared. To prove his loyalty to Johnny, and take revenge on Ed, Nick burns the railway carriage which is their hide-out, by emptying an oil drum and starting a fire. Nick decides that he must go back to Johnny and Tim, but he is still determined to find the Fence, in the hope of being able to barter his freedom. Nick realises that Palis, his French teacher, could have seen Snape and Boyle on the afternoon that he was serving a detention. He heads for Palis's flat in Chelsea but is nearly caught by the police there; they had spotted him in a nearby street. Palis saves him, and Nick explains his mission to him. He stays the night at Palis's flat. Palis drives Nick back to Wapping the following morning and tells him to get in touch if he needs anything. At the hideout, Nick sees a doorbell. Not recalling one, he enters the house through the back and rescues Tim from a bomb rigged to go off if the newly installed bell had been rung. Tim then explains that Johnny had come back the previous afternoon from wherever he had been to find Nick gone. They hadn't liked his answers, and during the night Johnny dragged Tim out of bed and tied him up before rigging the bomb. Nick and Tim discover that \\"Penelope\\" is actually a boat, and decide to keep a watch on the Penelope from a nearby derelict house. After seeing men storing objects aboard the Penelope, Nick remembers that Johnny went to \\"Penelope\\" through Wapping Tube Station. Nick and Tim go there and discover a secret entrance to a tunnel, which Johnny lost Nick through. The tunnel leads under the River Thames to the Fence's hideout where the brothers see many valuable stolen articles. They then encounter Nails Nathan, and Johnny appears on the scene, aware that Nick is working for the police. He ties them up and locks them in a room, but they soon escape. Nick has brought the bomb with him in his backpack, and uses it to destroy the door to the room they are locked in. On their way out, Johnny re-appears and is ready to shoot Nick and Tim, but they are stopped by Snape and a group of armed policemen, who have been tracking Nick through the tracking device in his prison shoes since he escaped. Snape, who survived the crash uninjured (and had also rescued Nick when he was tied to the railway track), is intent on arresting Powers and his gang, but the roof of the underground den collapses. Ultimately, Nick and Tim survive, Ma Powers is arrested, but Johnny and Nails Nathan escape, while the Fence is still nowhere to be seen and there is still no clue to his or her true identity, although the Fence's operation is destroyed. Nick is subsequently cleared of all charges. After Nick returns to school, he is sitting in a French lesson when Palis instructs Nick to translate a French paragraph. While doing so, Nick realises from the message he reads that Palis is the Fence, and that Palis had told Johnny Powers that he had been working for the police. At the end of the lesson, Palis announces to the class that he is leaving the school. He dismisses the whole class except Nick, who realises that Palis wants to kill him. Palis chases Nick to the school's roof with a gun, but wastes all his bullets trying to kill him. Palis attempts to plough into Nick, but falls over the side of the building, and dies when he impales himself on a fence. With Palis dead, the story ends with Nick's troubles over.

After the seizure of power in 1933, he was elected as a member of the Reichstag for Westphalia. On 2 June 1933 Hitler appointed him a Reichsleiter, the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party.Dietrich Orlow: The History of the Nazi Party: 1933-1945 (University of Pittsburgh Press), 1973, Pages 74. .

In August 1934, Bouhler became police president of Munich, and was appointed chief of Adolf Hitler's Chancellery, a post specially created on 17 November 1934 that was first and foremost set aside for party business. He held that position until 23 April 1945. In this job, for instance, secret decrees might be prepared, or internal business managed, before being brought before Adolf Hitler. Moreover, Bouhler was chairman of the \\"Official Party Inspection Commission for the Protection of National Socialist Literature\\" (Der Chef der Kanzlei des F√ºhrers und Vorsitzender der Parteiamtlichen Pr√ºfungskommission zum Schutze des NS- Schrifttums), which determined what writings were and were not suitable for Nazi society.

It was first published in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Spirou until branching out into its own volumed comic albums in 1996. The series was popular enough to have spawned a French-Canadian-Belgian animated TV series produced by defunct animation studio Spectra Animation; that aired on M6 and Canal J in France, RTBF Television in Belgium and on Teletoon in Canada. Overview Both the comic strip and the TV show cover all the passions and interests of 8 to 12-year-old boys. The main character, Kid Paddle, is your typical young boy with a passionate love for video games, comic books, Blorks (fictional aliens), and sci-fi television. His two best friends are Big Bang and Horace. Big Bang is more of a kid scientist, who is always creating new gadgets for Kid to try out. He is very intelligent for his age. Horace is more naive compared to the other two, and has a very bizarre appetite. He's always very supportive of Kid and looks up to him. As is typical for young children, Kid often fights with his sister, Carol, who finds her brother to be a degenerate air-head. Regular features cover video games, movies and DVDs, technology, and comic books. By the second season some of the story lines revolved around crushes and the differences between boys and girls. Two seasons of 26 half-hour episodes (each consisting of two 11-minute episodes) have been produced thus far. It's not clear as of 2006 if a third season will be produced. The show has a huge following in its Belgian homeland, as well as in France.

At an estimated cost of ¬£425,000 (),, electric tramways were proposed as follows: #Market Place to Trent Bridge via Arkwright Street. #From tramway 1 via Greyfriar Gate or Canal Street, continuing via Castle Boulevard, Lenton Boulevard, Radford Boulevard and Gregory Boulevard to Mansfield Road. #From tramway 2 via Wilford Road and the Victoria Embankment to Trent Bridge. #Market Place to Winchester Street, Sherwood, via King Street/Queen Street, Milton Street and Mansfield Road. #From tramway 4 via Woodborough Road to Mapperley, Porchester Road. #Along Parliament Street, what is now King Edward Street, St Ann's Well Road and The Wells Road to Woodborough Road. #Market Place to Bulwell Market Place via Chapel Bar, Derby Road, Alfreton Road, Radford Road and Vernon Road. #Upper Parliament Street and Market Street. Powers for these were granted in the Nottingham Corporation Act 1899.Nottingham Corporation Act 1899 Certain fare reductions were made during March and, as a result, the bus service connecting the Basford tram service with Bulwell was curtailed at Bulwell Market Place. Suggestions for a bus service to Sneinton were turned down, but in October, following further representations, a service was instituted between Thurland Street, near the Market Place, and Carlton Road Brickyard via Pelham Street, Hockley and Sneinton Street. Six buses were purchased second-hand from Glasgow for this service. The service immediately attracted competition and three privately owned buses commenced operation over the route within a few days of its inception. On 1 February, J. Aldworth commenced office as Tramways Manager, a position he was to hold for 30 years. Previously he had been Manager of the Douglas, Isle of Man, Tramways, and he succeeded A. Baker on the latter being appointed Chief Officer of the London County Council Tramways. A further investigation into car design, type of traction and the method of current collection was made by the City Engineer and the Electrical Engineer during a visit to New York and Boston. They confirmed that the overhead electric system would have to be used, although the conduit current collection system was preferable. Tenders were invited from Westinghouse and Dick, Kerr & Co. for cars, and that of Dick, Kerr & Co. for 12 cars was accepted. Four buses were purchased for ¬£130 () each to replace old ones operating on the Carlton Road and Musters Road services. 1900 - first electric services Sherwood depot Dick, Kerr & Co. informed the Department in January that unless the cars were ordered at once it would not be able to supply them before 1902 and then only at a higher price, and consequently an order was placed for 25. The relaying of the Carrington route with heavier rails (107 lb to the yard girder rails laid on six inches of concrete) and the extension to Winchester Street, Sherwood, began on 1 June. Work on the Sherwood Depot had commenced some weeks previously. In May, horse buses were withdrawn from the St Peter's Square to Musters Road service and placed on a new service between St Peter's Square and Lenton Boulevard, the fare being 2d. Five months later the service was extended to the Radford Boulevard/Hartley Road junction at Radford. Negotiations were opened for the purchase of the ten horse buses of a Mr. Mann but these negotiations fell through, and two new ones were purchased from James Hudson of London for the opening of a service to Sneinton. Nottingham's New Tram Cars, from Nottingham Evening Post of 17 October 1900 In October, the first nine electric trams arrived in Nottingham and were assembled at Sherwood Depot. By November, only one, no. 4, was completed, and this made its trial run on 17 November loaded with three tons of sand to represent the weight of a full load of passengers; the journey into Nottingham was quite successful, but trouble was experienced on its return when climbing Queen Street. The destination indicator on the cars was a square ended box that pivoted on its ends, one side being painted ‚ÄúSherwood‚Äù the other ‚ÄúMarket Place.‚Äù It is believed that subsequently some cars had ‚ÄúBasford‚Äù and ‚ÄúBulwell‚Äù painted on the other sides. The delay in completing the cars was so great that in December a notice had to be served on Dick, Kerr to complete them within seven days and, as a result, the work was done. In the meantime an order had been placed with Westinghouse for ten cars for the Trent Bridge section and, shortly afterwards, orders were placed for a further ten cars and ten bogie cars. B.T.H. were awarded contracts for six cars and six bogie cars, all to be delivered by the end of May. 1900 also saw the discontinuance of the prepaid discount tickets, and the first year of non- operation on Christmas Day. From September, horse drivers and conductors were awarded five days' holiday per annum and alternate Sundays off duty, and electric car drivers received 5¬Ωd. per hour () for a six-day week averaging 62 hours, with an increase to 6d. per hour () after the first year; electric car conductors were awarded 4d. per hour, increasing to 4¬Ωd. after the first year, and to 5d. after the second. 1901 - expansion The depot at Bulwell Trent Bridge Tram depot opened on 14 September 1901 Following the sanctioning of the Sherwood route by the Board of Trade on 16 December 1900, a service commenced on 1 January, workmen then being transferred to the laying of the track on the Bulwell section, starting from the outer terminus. This service was a great success from the start, a five-minute frequency increasing to three minutes at peak periods, and the fare for the journey of just over two miles was 2d. A request for a connecting horse-bus service from St Andrew's Church to Porchester Road at Mapperley until the tram service was opened was not granted. By 23 April, new lines had been laid down Wheeler Gate, connecting for the first time the northern and southern sections, while work had commenced on relaying the Trent Bridge and Station Street sections. At this time a new electric line was laid from Bulwell as far as Gregory Boulevard at Hyson Green, which was some distance nearer the city than the Old Basford horse tram terminus. Horse buses provided a service connecting with the horse trams while the old rails were pulled up, thus continuing the service to Basford, and on 17 April horse trams commenced operating from Gregory Boulevard to Bulwell Market over the new rails. As further new rails were laid, so the Bulwell end of the service expanded, while the Nottingham end grew shorter. On completion of this work and the depot at Bulwell in June, a through horse tram service was inaugurated on 29 June. This did not last long, for electric cars superseded the horse trams on 23 July, a week after the Board of Trade inspection, the through fare being 3d., with intermediate 1d. and 2d. fares. Electricity at this time was 1¬Ωd. per Board of Trade unit. Some delay was being experienced in obtaining new trams due to the large orders in hand from all over the country, and it was thought that the start of the electric car service to Bulwell would have to be postponed. Fortunately, 16 cars numbered 10 to 25, identical with the first cars except for the three- board type indicators, arrived in July, number 13 making a trial trip to Bulwell on 8 July. On Saturdays all 25 cars were needed in service and short workings of the Bulwell service were operated between the Market Place and Hyson Green, and to the old horsecar terminus at Church Street, Basford; the service was well patronised, overcrowding being commonplace. The receipts for the Bulwell services for the first week in August were ¬£1,115 () compared with ¬£318 () the previous year. At a city council meeting in May, new electric routes were proposed to Arnold, Hucknall, Carlton, Kimberley, Beeston, Stapleford and to other places in the county, but it was agreed not to construct outside the city boundary for the time being. In July it was decided to obtain powers for the building of the Hartley Road section. By August 1901 the Arkwright Street and Station Street relaying was well under way, together with the building of a new depot at Trent Bridge, comprising 11 roads with accommodation for 80 cars. For a short period the Trent Bridge horse tram service was cut into two parts while the Midland Railway strengthened their bridge under Carrington Street; the bridge over the adjacent canal was rebuilt at the same time. A further 32 cars of the original type were delivered, but with 2x35 h.p. motors instead of 2x25 h.p. motors. The layout of the depot at Trent Bridge The council meeting held in September brought forth many new tramway proposals, of which the following were adopted: the conversion of the Forest Road line to electric traction (this had been left out of the original Bill), a line along Victoria Embankment from Trent Bridge to Wilford Bridge, and a line to Sneinton. The Nottingham Corporation Act 1902 gave powers for the Forest Road line and for a number of short lengths of tramway, principally in the Market Place, to link up constructed or authorised tramways. It also gave powers for the Corporation to operate motor omnibuses in connection with any tramway either during a period when it was impracticable to operate tramcars or as extensions. The layout in the Market Place caused much argument, and one suggestion was for a gyratory system, single line, that every car would have to negotiate when passing through the Market Place. Owing to a decrease in the number of passengers carried, it was found necessary at this time to curtail the Sherwood Rise horse bus service to operate between Basford and Mansfield Road, and, in October, vehicles were transferred from this service to operate on services to Sneinton and Carlton Road. September also saw two further batches of new trains arrive. The first numbered 58 to 67, were ordered from the British Electric Tram Car Company, but were built by G.F. Milnes & Co., of Hadley, Shropshire. They were open-topped cars with reversed stairs, had 21E trucks, B.T.H. controllers and 2x30 h.p. Westinghouse motors. The second batch, numbered 68 to 77, were open-topped reversed-stair cars with Brill 22E maximum-traction bogies; the bodies were built by G. F. Milnes, the controllers were B.T.H. and they had 2x30 h.p. Westinghouse motors. Trent Bridge Depot was completed by 14 September, with lines leading to it along Turney Street and Pyatt Street, and while the relaying was taking place junctions were put in at Trent Bridge and Station Street for the London Road line, although the Bill for this had not yet gone before Parliament. A start was made in October on the construction of the St Ann's Well Road section, this being the first new electric line, the others having all been either conversions of, or extensions to, horse tram routes. Authorisation was given for the route to be continued to Mapperley, via The Wells Road, but, for the time being only as far as Coppice Road (now Ransom Road) was to be built. The construction of this line brought forth a protest from Bamford's, the horse bus proprietors, alleging loss of receipts. Earlier in the year, shortly after the opening of the first electric car route, the Council had been asked if they would consider the purchase of Mann's Omnibus, Horse and Carriage Company Limited, but this was not proceeded with. Tram on Wheeler Gate by St. Peter's Church, Nottingham circa 1901 The Trent Bridge and Station Street sections were inspected and passed on 15 October, public service commencing on 21 October. The Station Street service was a continuation of the Sherwood service via the Market Place, and was the first cross-city service, but the Trent Bridge cars ran only to the Market Place, with cars every three minutes, increased to two minutes at peak times. Six cars were fitted with Tideswell's automatic lifeguards as an experiment about this time. A public notice in the local press on 11 October contained a most ambitious proposal for a light railway between Nottingham and Derby, via Long Eaton and Draycott, together with a line from Long Eaton to Alfreton, via Stapleford, Ilkeston, Heanor and Ripley. At the same time Stapleford Rural District Council was endeavouring to persuade Nottingham Corporation to extend its electric tramways to Stapleford. A month later another ambitious light railway proposal was put forward for a ‚ÄúNottingham Suburban Light Railway‚Äù, with routes to Carlton, Arnold, Hucknall and Ilkeston. Coupled with this was a scheme sponsored by Sir Bache Cunard (of liner fame) for a ‚ÄúDerby and Nottingham Light Railway‚Äù operating mainly on reserved track, via Beeston and Long Eaton. Owing to great opposition by the Midland Railway, both of these schemes were turned down by the Light Railway Commissioners in the following February. In the meantime, a start was made on the construction of the route to Mapperley, via Woodborough Road. 1902 - New services to Lenton, St Ann's and Mapperley Various suggestions were again put forward as to the layout in the Market Place, all being greatly objected to by the stallholders. One was for a line in front of the Exchange and along South Parade; another was for two large turning circles similar to those that had just been constructed at the Pier Head in Liverpool. Although both these projects had a lot of support, they were abandoned. The Westinghouse bogie cars, nos. 68 to 77, were good riders but extremely slow, so in January number 77 was sent away and retrucked with Brill 27G trucks, receiving 4x30 h.p. Westinghouse motors at the same time, thus doubling its motive power. As a result of the improvement created, the whole class was treated similarly during the next two months. On 12 February a trial run was made along the St Ann's Well Road section; it was inspected on 20 February and the next day public service commenced with a five-minute service to and from the Market Place. In consequence, Bamford's horsebus service was withdrawn, but after negotiations he agreed to take over the Carlton Road and the Sneinton services, together with four buses and twelve horses, but this number was later halved, only Carlton Road being involved. The horse-drawn services at that time were suffering increasing losses and it was decided to cease their operation. The Forest Road horse tram service was discontinued on 30 April and not replaced. Cars numbered 33 and 34, which were the two surviving ones on this service, were sold to Leicester Corporation, who operated them for a further two years. Mann was approached to see if he would take over the Basford and Old Lenton services, but he was apparently not interested; the remainder of the horses and vehicles, comprising 11 buses, one old brake, one old trap, one old dray, one old cart and 60 horses, were sold for ¬£1,335 to John Commons, who agreed to operate the Sneinton, Old Radford and Old Lenton horse bus services at existing times and fares. He further contracted for one year, commencing on 1 May, for the use of the Muskham Street stables and depot. For the year ending 31 March, the first full year of electric car operation, a profit of ¬£19,029 was made, of which ¬£12,000 was contributed to the relief of the rates. Sixteen new cars were ordered from Dick, Kerr. A trial trip to Mapperley was made on 1 May on car 57. Apparently it was a very hot day and the driver of the car said that much sand was needed to overcome the stickiness of the tar, which had melted and overflowed onto the rails from between the setts. The steepest gradient of the section was 1 in 11. Major Pringle, the Board of Trade inspector, duly inspected the approved route on 6 May and public service commenced a week later, on 13 May. This service operated via the Market Place to Trent Bridge every 12 minutes, alternating with a short working between Alexandra Park and Trent Bridge every 12 minutes. The fare between the Market Place and Mapperley was 2d., with intermediate 1d. stages. At first there was a stop on the outward journey at Cranmer Street, but this was discontinued early in 1903 because of the difficulty of restarting the cars, the hill being at its steepest at this point. The next section of electric tramway to be completed was the Nottingham Road route, and a trial run over this section was made in car 61 on 17 June. Major Pringle was again the inspector, on 2 July, and public service commenced on 7 July, a through service being provided via the Market Place to Station Street; the fare from the Market Place was 2d., with 1d. intermediate stages. Three further lots of cars were obtained, all being open-topped vehicles with reversed stairs. The first batch was numbered 78 to 83, built by G. F. Milnes, mounted on 21E trucks, with B.T.H. equipment and 2x30 h.p. B.T.H. motors. The second batch was also built by Milnes, but these were bogie cars mounted on 22E maximum-traction trucks, also with B.T.H. equipment and 2x30 h.p. motors; they were numbered 84 to 89 and were known as the ‚Äúpony wheel bogies‚Äù. The third batch was really part of the same order as cars numbered 26 to 57, being similar in every respect. At the same time two works cars were obtained; they were no. 1, a water sprinkler and line clearer, and no. 2, a snowplough. Both of these had 21E trucks and 2x35 h.p. Dick, Kerr motors. Installing the intersection at the junction of Lenton Boulevard and Derby Road. View looking south west. In the meanwhile, work was in progress on the Lenton route, and a junction was put in at Derby Road for a proposed route to Beeston, via Derby Road and Adams Hill. Later, on 1 September, work started on the Wilford Road route. Following a trial run over the Lenton route on 11 September, Major Pringle made an inspection on behalf of the Board of Trade on 26 September and public service commenced on 30 September. The service between Nottingham Road and Station Street was withdrawn and the cars ran from Nottingham Road, through the Market Place, and along the new section via Castle Boulevard, Lenton Boulevard and Radford Boulevard to the junction with Hartley Road. As both Greyfriar Gate and Canal Street were single line, the outward route to Lenton was via Greyfriar Gate and the inward route via Canal Street and Carrington Street. There was a good deal of complaint at the time about the use of centre traction poles in the middle of the road, as they were alleged to be the cause of most of the traffic congestion. Further routes were proposed at the September council meeting, including Bath Street, Carlton Road, Manvers Street, Colwick Road and Sneinton Boulevard, but only four routes, London Road, Hartley Road, Market Street and Forest Road, were applied for. In anticipation of these proposals being carried out, double junctions were laid at each end of Forest Road. The trial run along Wilford Road took place on 31 October. The line was inspected by Major Pringle on 7 November, public service commencing the next day. Through working was inaugurated to St Ann's Well Road, but on 10 December this practice ceased, both services terminating in the Market Place. Parliamentary sanction was obtained for the four short routes applied for, and an immediate start was made on the Market Street and Hartley Road sections. The construction of a line on Market Street was intended to remove congestion on Chapel Bar by making it a oneway working, and that on Hartley Road to link up Lenton Boulevard with Alfreton Road. The cost of laying the track on Market Street, including the complicated layout at the junction with Long Row, was ¬£6,575, while Hartley Road cost ¬£7,600. On 17 November, the Bulwell and Trent Bridge services were joined, short working being introduced between the Market Place and Church Street, Basford, and between the Market Place and Hyson Green. It was decided to fit all cars with Tideswell life guards as a result of the success of those fitted earlier in the year. The end of the year saw the withdrawal of free passes for members of all the councils committees. 1903 - Introduction of colour-coding During March the decision was taken to operate alternate cars on the Nottingham Road service only as far as Haydn Road, a practice that ceased in November of the following year. An offer of ¬£100 per annum was received from a syndicate for the carrying parcels on the cars, but although this offer was improved upon it was declined. The beginning of the summer found certain service alterations taking place. A through service was provided from St Ann's Well Road to Trent Bridge for workmen during the early morning at a fare of 1d., while on summer Sundays Sherwood cars were extended to Trent Bridge. At this time the London County Council were expanding their electric tramways, and a request received from Dick, Kerr to borrow a number of motormen from Nottingham to drive their cars before they were handed over to the London County Council was granted. On 11 May the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company Bill was passed. This gave their trams running powers over Nottingham Corporation metals to Arnold, Beeston, Carlton and Ripley, extensions beyond the Corporation routes to Sherwood, Lenton, Sneinton and Basford respectively. The Beeston line ran from the Corporation line on Lenton Boulevard by way of Church Street, Gregory Street, Abbey Street and Beeston Road, continuing over fields on which University Boulevard was subsequently constructed, thence along Fletcher Road, Humber Road, High Road, Beeston Square and Chilwell Road to the Beeston boundary. The Carlton line ran via Canton Road, Carlton Hill and Main Street West to Newgate Street, while the Arnold line followed Mansfield Road, Daybrook Square, Nottingham Road and Front Street to Spout Lane (later Coppice Road). The final line proposed was from the projected line to Ripley, along Nuthall Road, thence over the railway crossing at Bobbers Mill, continuing via Alfreton Road to Bentinck Road junction, at which point it joined the existing Corporation lines. Trial runs over the Market Street and Hartley Road sections were made on 20 July. They were duly inspected Major Pringle the next day and one-way working was brought into operation on 27 July, cars entering Market Place via Chapel Bar and leaving via Market Street The whole of the intricate layout at the bottom of Market Street was either relaid or new at this time. The Hartley Road section completed what was known the ‚ÄúBoulevard Circle‚Äù and circular services commenced 30 July. Cars from Nottingham Road ran round the inner rails (Radford and Lenton) and thence back to Nottingham Road, and the St Ann's Well Road cars ran round the outer rails (Lenton and Radford), returning to St Ann's Well Road. Both operated on a six-minute frequency. A system of coloured lights was used at night on the cars in order to distinguish the various services, as it was impossible to read the destination boards because they were not illuminated. The colours were: :Sherwood Station Street - red :Mapperley Trent Bridge - yellow :St Ann‚Äôs Well Road Boulevards - green :Nottingham Road Boulevards - blue :Wilford Road Market Place - green :Bulwell Trent Bridge - red :Basford Market Place - white These colours were illuminated by a light in the lower saloon immediately behind the offside bulkhead, through which there was a circular hole. The arrangement consisted of three coloured lenses on arms, which were pivoted, and by putting the lens or lenses in front of the hole the requisite light could be obtained. The side and front destination boards were painted as follows: :Sherwood Station Street - white on red :Mapperley Trent Bridge - blue on yellow :St Ann‚Äôs Well Road Boulevards - green on white :Nottingham Road Boulevards - white on blue :Wilford Road Market Place - white on green :Bulwell Trent Bridge - red on white :Basford Market Place - white on black Following an application by residents in Sherwood for a fare reduction by extending the length of one stage, a general review of fares and stages was made, but as the average length of a 1d. stage was 1.42 miles no alterations were deemed to be necessary. 1904 - Maximum speed increases to 12 m.p.h. This year saw welding of rail joints for the first time, on 8 January. The Thermit process was used and its introduction followed a visit by a deputation sent to Glasgow to inspect this process. At the February council meeting, great opposition was raised to the proposed construction of a line along Forest Road at an estimated cost of ¬£13,000, and so the scheme was dropped. One good thing which came out of this meeting was the approval for top-covering two trams experimentally, at a cost of ¬£85 each. Cars 33 and 94 made their appearance on 9 March with Bellamy-type roofs. This type of roof was the idea of C. R. Bellamy, the Manager of Liverpool Corporation Tramways, and consisted of a box-like structure over the main saloon, without covers over the canopies at each end. On the whole they were well received and increased receipts were taken on the cars, with the result that similar modifications to further cars, believed to be four in number, were made. Towards the end of 1903 an application had been made to the Board of Trade to revise speed limits. The findings were notified during March, a maximum speed of 12 m.p.h. being approved. A further report on fares was made by the Manager, this time on the question of cheap early facilities. He was against the issue of certain workmen's returns on account of the difficulties experienced on other systems. Consequently, return tickets at single fare where the latter exceeded 2d. were introduced. In April, the curves at the corner of Parliament Street and Queen Street were relaid with normal rail, the extremely high check rail being removed as it was a source of danger to cyclists and other road users. At the April council meeting proposals were made for routes in the Sneinton area, and two were adopted, one via Bath Street and Manvers Street to Colwick Road, and the other to Trent Bridge via London Road. These were incorporated in the Nottingham Corporation Act 1905. The Colwick Road route was an amended version of that previously arranged via Sneinton Road and Sneinton Hollows to Colwick Road. Owing to the extremely narrow streets in the Sneinton area, Bath Street had to be widened, and it was necessary to encroach on the cemetery to achieve this, the bodies being interred elsewhere. On Manvers Street 65 houses had to be pulled down, the main reason for this being Aldworth's strong objection to single lines with passing loops. Nearly two years were to elapse before these two routes came into being. In May, the conductors‚Äô maximum wage was increased from 5¬æd. to 6d. an hour. At the June council meeting the question of operating along Forest Road was again raised, and this time it was finally rejected. More peak-hour cars were put on between the Market Place and Hyson Green, together with other short workings. One councillor suggested that a clock be installed at Trent Bridge, to put an end to the present haphazard arrangement of guessing the time, and thus secure more regular running. The motion was adopted. A proposal was accepted that the Basford terminus should be moved from its present position at Church Street to Lincoln Street, put into operation in February 1906. Another motion carried at the meeting was for trams to have full topcovers instead of the Bellamy type. Car 8 was the first car to be so treated and all the Bellamy-type roofed cars were fully topcovered by 1908. In July, agreement was reached for children under three years of age to be carried free of charge, while from three until their tenth birthday they would be carried at half the adult fare where this exceeded 1d. A proposal was made to apply for Parliamentary powers to construct a line along Canton Road, but as a similar scheme had been included in the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company Bill, this was amended to a proposal to construct connecting lines comprising a single line along Handel Street and curves into Canton Road from Bath Street. Powers were also sought at this time for the operation of motorbuses, and, in November, the Brush Traction Electric Engineering Company of Loughborough was approached to see if it were willing to operate two of its motorbuses in Nottingham for a trial period of three months. This it declined to do. In November, Hucknall Urban District Council suggested the construction of lines from Hucknall to link with the Nottingham lines at Bulwell, but nothing further was heard of the proposal. 1905 The opening of the new Midland Railway Station on Carrington Street led to the old one on Station Street being closed, with the consequent loss of much tramway traffic on Station Street. The Great Northern Railway had already vacated their London Road Station for the more commodious Victoria Station in 1902, so the service of cars between Sherwood and Station Street was reduced, only alternate cars running along it, the others being directed along Arkwright Street to Trent Bridge. More cars received top covers as they went into the Works for major overhaul; the Manager said that they were being top covered in Trent Bridge Works at the cost of ¬£60 per car (). Previously, when undertaken by an outside firm, the cost had been ¬£80 per car (). The existing iron guards fitted to 32 cars were replaced by Tideswell's patent life guards. Representations were made for the carriage of parcels on the cars, but this was not agreed to, nor was the request by various church authorities that tram services on Sunday mornings should be suspended. In November, agreement was given for the replacement of existing ticket punches by a type that would register more accurately. The Nottingham Corporation Act 1905 repealed the 1902 Act relating to the running of motor omnibuses, but gave generally similar powers in its place, including the use of animal or mechanical power, the latter including battery-driven vehicles. 1906 Motor bus by Thorneycroft and Company, ordered by Nottingham Corporation Tramways in 1906 During the previous year inquiries had been made of other municipalities as to their experience in the operation of motor buses, principally with a view to motorbus operation on the Carlton Road service, as Bamford was under no obligation to continue his service of horsebuses. As a result, three Thorneycroft double-deckers were ordered for early delivery following Bamford's withdrawal earlier in the year. Bamford had agreed to take over the tenancy of the Muskham Street stables from 25 March in succession to Common's Nottingham Carriage Company, which had gone into liquidation, but, following the refusal of the West Bridgford Urban District Council to grant licences for operation in their area, Bamford was released from his agreement. On 26 March the motorbus service between the Market Place and the Crown Hotel, Carlton Road commenced operation. Two vehicles were required for the normal operation of the service, the third one being kept in reserve at the depot built on spare land adjoining Trent Bridge Depot. At first the service was operated Monday to Saturday only, but it was shortly afterwards increased to daily operation; time and a quarter was agreed upon for Sunday work. It was also agreed that after 12 months‚Äô service each employee should be granted six days‚Äô paid holiday. The question of traction poles in the centre of the road came before the April committee meeting, as apparently they were becoming troublesome. It was decided to replace them by side poles and brackets, or side poles and span wires, as the opportunity occurred. At the June Council meeting, the fitting of new and more powerful motors was approved for cars 1 to 25, as, with their weaker motors, they frequently lost time and hindered the cars behind. 35 h.p. motors were obtained from Dick, Kerr and the 25 h.p. ones were returned in part payment. The laying of track for the Colwick Road service along Bath Street, Manvers Street and Colwick Road, together with that for the London Road service, via Pennyfoot Street, Plumptre Square and London Road to Trent Bridge, commenced on 22 August 1906. Grooved wire was used for the overhead line. 1907 - New services to Colwick Road and Wilford Road The first trial car was run over both the above routes on 6 March. Major Pringle inspected them on behalf of the Board of Trade on 13 March and, following the official opening of the Colwick Road section the next day, a service commenced between the Market Place and Colwick Road during the afternoon. The London Road route opened the following day, 15 March, this route being linked up with the one to Wilford Road. At the same time the Sherwood Station Street service was extended via London Road and Pennyfoot Street to Colwick Road. A week later the Colwick Road and Basford services were linked together. New cars were purchased from Milnes Voss for these extensions, numbered 106 to 115, and they entered service on 28 March. These vehicles were a new departure for Nottingham, having normal staircases and top-covered bodies. The trucks were Mountain and Gibson 2IEM type, having M&G; equipment and controllers. In addition to the usual slipper brake, hand brake and rheostatic brake, they had a magnetic runback brake. All had with wooden block slipper brakes, as were several of the earlier cars, and a fitter had to be kept in the Market Place fitting new blocks every two or three journeys for they quickly wore out, particularly on the Mapperley service. The drivers liked these wooden brake blocks, saying that they gave a good purchase on the rail, but this class of car on the whole was greatly disliked and, shortly afterwards, the wooden blocks were replaced by cast-iron ones. The Hockley portion of the motorbus route had been causing some difficulty and in March the service was altered to operate between Milton Street - Parliament Street junction and Thorneywood Lane junction on Carlton Road, via Parliament Street and Bath Street. In April 1907, barely a month after it had started, the Station Street to Colwick Road service was discontinued, and the cars from the Sherwood to Station Street route continued via London Road to Trent Bridge. This meant that all cars from Sherwood ran to Trent Bridge, alternating via Arkwright Street and via London Road. At about this time the terminal line at Trent Bridge was moved from the centre of the road to the kerbside outside Hickling's Cafe, and a new terminal line was put in for the London Road cars. For the first four or five weeks of running all London Road cars had to use the existing Trent Bridge terminus, causing much congestion. Colwick Road residents objected greatly to the loss of their Station Street service, so a circular one was introduced from Colwick Road to Colwick Road, via Station Street, the Market Place and Bath Street, alternate cars going different ways. This service also proved unremunerative and was withdrawn in October. Fares at this period averaged 1.6 miles for 1d. Top covering of cars proceeded at a steady rate. By May 1906, 24 cars had been dealt with and work on a further 12 was in hand. A year later, in June 1907, 12 more were fitted. In November, the fitting of a sanding device on all cars at a cost of 55/- per car () was agreed upon. The centre poles on Derby Road were replaced by side poles and span construction at a cost of ¬£350-¬£375; Milton Street was similarly treated later in the year. This work was extended to include Mansfield Road, Castle Boulevard and Lenton Boulevard early in 1908, these schemes costing some ¬£1,547 (). 1908 Agreement was reached with the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company for the construction of a line within the city from Cinderhill to connect with the existing Corporation lines at Basford, and in return the Company were to transfer powers for their lines within the city to the Corporation. In April a Bill was passed through Parliament authorising the Corporation to take over the powers for three of the Company's routes, namely, to Beeston, Arnold (a continuation of the Sherwood route) and Carlton. The Carlton route, as sanctioned to the Company, was for single line with passing loops, a type of construction not favoured by the Corporation, and during the construction of the various routes within the city, endeavours had always been made to have property demolished in order to widen the roadways, making them suitable for double track. A new Bill was therefore introduced by the Corporation to authorise a double line to Carlton, but owing to the dissolution of Parliament it was not passed until 1910. Only a few days after their introduction in March 1906, the motorbuses had started to give considerable mechanical trouble; split pins dropped out of the steering gear and out of the wheels, while blocked petrol supply pipes were a continual source of delay. Some repairs were carried out by the drivers, but usually the fitter employed on this work would bring out the third bus as a replacement. As time went by the vehicles became more troublesome and often the service had to be maintained by one bus because mechanical work was being carried out on the other two. It was not unusual for one bus to go out two or three hours late to enter service, and on one occasion the crew of one vehicle waited five hours after a breakdown for the second bus in service to work its last journey and tow them in. In April, the Committee were informed that considerable expenditure was needed to keep these vehicles in service and that it was not possible to maintain them satisfactorily, whereupon it was decided to ask Seldon Brothers, Wentworth's, and W. Bamford if any of them would be willing to provide horsebuses for the service, pending construction of the tramway. Bamford agreed to the proposal that he should operate between the top of King Street and the Crown Inn on Carlton Road, via Coalpit Lane (later Cranbrook Street), on a 20-minute frequency at a fixed charge of 9d. per mile; receipts were collected by a Corporation conductor, but the driver was provided by Bamford's. The last day of motorbus operation was 15 June. After withdrawal, two of the vehicles were converted into tower waggons. A further ten cars, numbered 116 to 125, were obtained during the year and during their life proved popular with the crews. They were top-covered, with normal stairs, and bodies built by the United Electric Car Company of Preston. They were fitted to Brill 21 E trucks and had two 40 h.p. Dick, Kerr motors with Dick, Kerr controllers and equipment, and B.T.H. magnetic slipper brakes. In May, one of these, no. 121, was demonstrated to the Committee, showing the action of the ‚Äúrun back‚Äù preventer and of the combined magnetic and mechanical track brake. At a later date this car was involved in an incident. It was foggy at the time, and both driver and conductor alighted near the top of Derby Road to find their whereabouts. On returning to their car they found that it had run away backwards down the hill to Gregory Street, where it collided with another car, knocking the latter into some gardens. In August the removal of the centre poles along Alfreton Road was agreed to and, on account of heavy losses, the Carlton Road horsebus service was reduced to a half-hourly frequency. 1909 Little development took place during this year. The top covering of cars continued and, by October, 72 out of 125 cars had been so fitted. The covers cost just over ¬£80 each and at this period were being bought from the United Electric Car Company of Preston. Until 1909 the fare for children under 12 was for two children to travel with one adult ticket or for one child to ride two adult stages. This system had come in for a certain amount of criticism, the outcome of which was the introduction of children's tickets in January. Children under 15 years of age were supplied with books of 30 tickets, each book costing 1/3d. Each ticket was available for one adult 1d. stage and had to be handed to the conductor in exchange for a section ticket. A suggestion was made by the Public Parks Committee that the success of the proposed recreation ground and golf, course at Bulwell Hall Estate would depend on the extension of the Bulwell tramway service to the entrance to the Estate. This proposal was found to be costly, as increased generating equipment would be required, and the idea was not proceeded with. In November, alterations to wages and working conditions took place. Spare conductors were granted 1/ per day, provided that they attended at the depot and were not required. A proposed reduction in working hours per week from 63 to 56 for six days was turned down by a ballot of the men. Cleaners‚Äô pay was increased from 5¬Ωd. to 6d. an hour and the hours reduced from 9¬Ω to 9 each night for a six- night week. 1910 - Carlton Road relaid A change in the supplier of tickets took place during April, following a request for quotations from a number of printers. The new contractors were the C.A.S. Punch and Ticket Company Limited of London and this firm supplied the bulk of the tickets for 20 years. The Nottingham Corporation Act 1910 authorised the borrowing of money in order to purchase a further ten cars for use on increased services and on the new Carlton Road service. Before ordering, a visit was made to West Ham to inspect a new type of car in service there. During the visit a Johannesburg gentleman placed at the party's disposal a motor omnibus for demonstration. Notts. County's new football ground was opened in August and, in order to assist in operating cars to and from the ground, a siding line to hold either eight bogie or ten four-wheel cars was constructed. On 31 August a start was made on laying the Carlton Road track to the revised specifications, this being completed up to Thorneywood Lane (now Porchester Road) by early December. Major Pringle inspected it on 16 December at 12.30 p.m. and at 1.30 p.m. a regular service was running to and from the Market Place. This track contained an interlaced section of approximately 200 yards. On the same day a fifteen- minute service was instituted between the Midland Station and Colwick Road; some three years later this was linked with the Carlton service. The inauguration of the tramcar service resulted in the withdrawal of the horse bus service operated by Bamford on behalf of the Corporation. Requests were continually being made for various fare alterations, and these resulted in the decision in December to introduce 1¬Ωd., 2¬Ωd., and 3¬Ωd. fares. Following an experiment with a new type of punch, 300 were hired from the Ticket Punch and Register Company Limited of London at 9/- per annum. 1911 - Fleet increases to 100 vehicles Nottingham Corporation Tramways car 66 descending Wheeler Gate, ca. 1910 The top covering of cars was carried out continuously between June 1910 and March 1911, a further 10 cars being so treated, bringing the total to 100. 14 more top covers were then purchased, four for bogies and ten for single-truck cars. Eight sets of magnetic brakes were also ordered to replace the mechanical type on the 1907 cars. Owing to an increase in electricity consumption by the cars the Manager recommended that meters should be fitted to each one. The offer of a Birmingham firm to supply these was accepted, on condition that if the consumption had not decreased by at least 500 units at the end of the first year, the meters would be removed and the cost refunded. A subsequent agreement reduced the period to six months following the conclusion of a maintenance agreement between the Corporation and the firm. During the trial period consumption did decrease, following which a sum was set aside to be shared between those drivers and their conductors who used least current on their cars. The 126 to 135 batch of cars came in December. They were top-covered cars with normal stairs, built by the United Electric Car Company at their Preston works. They had six side windows in the lower saloon and three in the upper saloon, two 40 h.p. Dick, Kerr 9.A.2 interpole motors and Dick, Kerr controllers and equipment. To celebrate the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary on 22 July a decorated and illuminated tramcar was run. 1912 In February E. L. Fleetwood of London requested a licence to operate motorbuses between St Peter's Square and West Bridgford, but the granting of this was deferred pending consideration of the introduction of a joint service between the Market Place and West Bridgford. It was, however, decided that as there was sufficient vehicular traffic already using Arkwright Street and a frequent tramcar service operating as far as Trent Bridge, the licence should be refused, although the Corporation had no objection to a service between West Bridgford and the city side of Trent Bridge. Bulk purchase scholars‚Äô tickets were withdrawn about March and replaced by a concession allowing children under 14 years of age to be carried over a 1d. adult stage for ¬Ωd. After visiting Birmingham to see drivers‚Äô screens in use on the cars, six Nottingham vehicles were similarly treated. The reequipment of twenty older cars also took place, Dick, Kerr interpole motors being used. In November, service numbers replaced colours on destinations, this being the outcome of a visit several months earlier to see similar destination number boxes in use at Liverpool. The services were numbered: :# Sherwood Trent Bridge. :# Mapperley Trent Bridge. :# Bulwell Trent Bridge. :# Basford Colwick Road. :# Nottingham Road Radford and Lenton. :# St Ann‚Äôs Well Road Lenton and Radford. :# Wilford Road London Road. :# Carlton Road Market Place. In September, orders were placed for top-covers for a further 12 standard cars, thus completing the topcovering of all regular service cars. The ‚Äúpony wheel‚Äù bogie class never received top-covers. No. 76 appeared late in this year with a totally enclosed top deck, there being no bulkheads. This car had no service number holders and the number ‚Äú3‚Äù was painted at each end of the upper deck. These enclosed ends were not popular with the conductors for, when leaning out of the rather narrow end sliding windows to see that all passengers had boarded or alighted, their hats were knocked off unless they had taken the precaution to remove them first. A further innovation was the fixing of transparencies on gas lamp glasses to denote stopping places. 1913 The 1913 Nottingham Corporation Bill proposed tramway extensions along Derby Road, via Hucknall Road to Bagthorpe Hospital, along Sneinton Road to Sneinton Dale, and from Bulwell Market to Bulwell Hall Park, together with various motorbus and trolley vehicle routes. The principal motorbus routes were in West Bridgford, i.e., via Trent Boulevard to Adbolton Grove, and a circular route via Musters Road, Chaworth Road and Loughborough Road. Others were between the tramcar terminus at Sherwood, continuing via Daybrook Square to Arnold, and along Carlton Road o Newgate Street, both of these being routes for which tramway powers had been taken over from the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company. Suggestions were made that powers would probably also be required for other feeder services to tramways, such as from Mansfield Road, via Gregory Boulevard and Alfreton Road to Bentinck Road, along Forest Road, along Hucknall Road to the Bagthorpe Workhouse, via Sneinton Road to Sneinton Dale, between Bulwell Market Place and Bulwell Hall Park, and from the Mapperley tramway terminus to Spout Lane (now Coppice Road). The subsequent Act gave general powers for motorbus operation within the city boundary. Trolleybus powers were sought for a route from the Market Place, via Arkwright Street to Trent Bridge, and thence along the two routes proposed for motorbus operation in West Bridgford. Owing to opposition from the West Bridgford Urban District Council, the latter clause was deleted, but powers for trolleybuses were granted, including the section of route between the Market Place and Trent Bridge. The vehicles were restricted to a maximum laden weight of five tons, powers being given to enable provisional orders to be applied for on any route required. West Bridgford Urban District Council then promoted their own Bill to operate motorbuses, but endeavoured to make a satisfactory agreement with the Corporation to operate the services; eventually, after lengthy negotiations, West Bridgford commenced operation on their own account in January the following year. The construction of the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company's Ripley route began in May 1913, and it was opened in several sections, all outside the city. The section between Church Street Basford, and Cinderhill was constructed by the Corporation and, after inspection by Major Pringle on 1 January 1914, through services to Ripley started. This section of the line included the only reserved track in Nottingham, ballasted sleeper track about ¬º mile long cutting off the corner between Nuthall Road and Stockhill Lane. The only Corporation cars to run over this track, so far as can be ascertained, were two test cars and the inspection car and, later, about 1919, one of the Westinghouse bogie cars borrowed by the Tramway Company in order to try out a car of this type on their line. It is thought that this car was no. 77: the car ran all the way to Ripley, probably the only Nottingham car to do so. Corporation tickets were issued on the Company's trams between the Nottingham terminus on Parliament Street and Cinderhill, rebooking being necessary at the latter point on journeys either way. The Company issued a special colliers' ld. ticket, available to colliers going to and from work in their \\"pit clothes\\", irrespective of distance. One passenger answering to this description boarded a Company car on Alpine Street and asked for his ld. ticket, wanting to go to Nuthall. This placed the conductor in a quandary as he had no corresponding ticket for the Corporation, but being an obliging person, he issued a ld. joint ticket which was marked \\"Parcel or Perambulator\\"! The said passenger was most insulted by this and informed the conductor so in language not too polite. When the conductor said that he could not do anything about it, the passenger's ire was so roused that he punched the conductor on the nose. Litigation ensued. The experiment with the Birmingham type screen proved so successful that in October it was agreed to fit a further 40 suitable cars with this type, the remaining 25 to be fitted with the best kind obtainable. An extension of the Carlton Road route from the old terminus at Thorneywood Lane to Standhill Road was commenced in the September. 1914 - Extension to Carlton and along Derby Road In addition to his inspection of the Cinderhill section on 1 January, Major Pringle also included the Carlton extension. Services on the latter commenced on 5 January, cars running alternately to the Market Place or to Colwick Road, via Station Street. Following the Council meeting in January, an immediate start was made with the line down the other side of Carlton Hill into Carlton. The Derby Road and Arnold extensions followed. Construction of the Derby Road section commenced on 4 May and, at the same time a start was made on the relaying the track on Derby Road from the top (now Canning Circus) to Chapel Bar. The Carlton section opened throughout on 14 June the cars continuing to operate alternately to the Market Place or to Colwick Road. A short working was introduced between the Market Place and Standhill Road Loop (as it was called on the timetables and on the tickets) this service shortly afterwards being allocated the letter A. In April, quotations were received from the Daimler Company for the supply of motorbuses. An order was placed with them for two single-deckers of the 40 h.p. type fitted with Dodson 25-seat (plus three next to the driver) clerestory-roof single-deck bodies. These were to provide a service between the Derby Road tramway at Gregory Street and Dunkirk, with a l¬Ωd. through transfer ticket. Until this time transfer tickets had not been issued, but fare revisions introduced about December 1914 included this facility. Certain reductions in workmen's fares also took place. In May, work was completed on rebuilding the bodies of three cars, and a considerable number of others required to be fitted with steel braces. As this type of work fully committed the coachbuilders at the Works for some time, orders were placed with the United Electric Car Company for six new car bodies and with Dick, Kerr for new electrical equipment to be fitted to the six oldest cars requiring these bodies. Two batches of new cars were obtained for the extensions built or being built, Carlton, Derby Road and Arnold. The first were numbered 136 to 145; these had vestibuled bodies with four windows on each side built by the United Electric Car Company Limited. They were mounted on Brill 21E wide wing trucks, had 2x40 h.p. Dick, Kerr motors, Dick, Kerr equipment with D.B.I. controllers and, besides the usual brakes (hand, rheostatic and runback), they had Cole, Marchint and Morley air slipper brakes. These cars were 64-seaters. The second batch, numbered 146 to 155, had similar bodies built by the Brush Electrical Engineering Company Limited of Loughborough, mounted on Brush-built P.22 trucks and with identical equipment to the U.E.C. cars, except for 146, which had a B.T.H electromagnetic brake instead of the air slipper type. All these cars were delivered with roller blind indicators, and gradually, but with no small objection from the travelling public, this type of indicator was fitted to practically all the remaining cars. The first car to be fitted with a new U.E.C. lower saloon was no. 16 and this appeared in service during the summer, the remaining rebuilt cars appearing shortly afterward. The fitting of top covers to these earlier cars had caused the original lower saloon frames to bow owing to the extra weight. These new saloons had normal staircases, while the existing equipment was replaced by the new Dick, Kerr 40 h.p. motors and D.B.I. controllers. The position of the track wheel was altered, and roller blind indicators were fitted. On 25 September, the Derby Road route was complete and inspected by Major Druit. The route was pronounced be in order and a ten-minute service numbered 9 to and from the Market Place, inward via Chapel Bar and outward via Market Street was inaugurated the same day. Construction of the Arnold extension beyond Winchester Street was then in hand and at the same time the whole of Mansfield Road between Gregory Boulevard and Sherwood Depot was relaid. Despite the outbreak of World War I, this work was completed in early December, being inspected by Major Druit on 29 December. Public service commenced on 1 January 1915. 1915 - First women employed as conductresses The interior of Bulwell Depot This new service was also numbered 9, being linked with the Derby Road section and thus providing the longest run the city, all over new track. Previously, Arnold had been served by a bus service operated by John Bradhury, whose call for compensation failed. By this time many of the motormen and conductors had enlisted, so in order to operate a satisfactory service to Arnold it was necessary to reduce the frequency of the service along Wilford Road. This depleted service lasted for some 16 months. In March, a driver dropped dead at Bulwell Depot just before he was due to take a car out. Consequently, all drivers were required to be medically examined periodically. A further noteworthy incident at Bulwell at this time occurred when an officer stationed at Bulwell Hall commandeered a tramcar standing at Bulwell Market Place to take 17 men to Victoria Station. This created quite a stir, for if such occasions occurred frequently the service would be thrown into disorder. From this time soldiers were carried at half fare, a later concession being the issue of prepaid ¬Ωd. and 1d. passes to wounded soldiers. Owing to the war and consequent lack of materials, it was impossible to construct the tramways to Beeston as originally intended. Much of the proposed route, which was to have been along a private right of way on approximately the line of University Boulevard, had been pegged out. A three-year extension of powers to build the line was granted. During the summer, blinds were fitted over the ends of all cars with normal staircases, so that when it rained or the sun shone directly into the driver's eyes he could pull down this blind and gain a little protection. These blinds were fitted because of complaints from drivers that they had no protection at all from the weather on cars of this type, whereas they did gain a little protection on those fitted with reversed stairs. The number of men enlisting increased considerably, their places being taken by women employed as conductresses, the first starting about October 1915. Some 18 months later a visit was made by the Manager and others to Glasgow to see women working as tramcar drivers. They formed the opinion that this was not desirable in Nottingham. Track replacements took place during the year on the Arkwright Street, Bulwell and Mapperley sections, while the centre poles were replaced by side poles and span wires on Parliament Street and King Edward Street. By October, traffic had fallen off considerably during the evening, the service being terminated at 11 p.m. Six months later this was amended to 10.30 p.m. because of air raid dangers, and, in October 1916, to 10 p.m. Despite the war, the Royal Show was held at Wollaton Park in 1915, special cars being operated on the Derby Road service at a fare of 3d. 1916 This year marked the introduction of the 5/- change money for conductors; at first this was issued only to full service conductors. Following the Zeppelin raid on Nottingham, a form of blackout blind was fitted to the cars, while revised Board of Trade regulations in June necessitated the fitting of side lifeguards. A further six tramcar bodies were ordered at this time from the United Electric Car Company Limited as replacements, followed by six more in October. 1917 Many wounded soldiers were sent to the Corporation hospital at Bagthorpe and the necessity arose for some sort of service to be provided. The production of motorbuses by the Daimler Company had ceased as far as the order placed with them in 1915 was concerned, so an approach was made to Barton Brothers of Beeston to see if they would provide a service. This they declined to do because of the labour shortage, and there the matter rested. By May it had become apparent that there was no alternative but to revise fares to meet the increased cost of operation and particularly that of labour. The availability of workmen's fares was altered to cease after 7 a.m., but the time had to be amended shortly afterwards to 7.30 a.m. All transfer facilities were abolished after 20 May; the half-fare limit for children was altered from under 15 to under 12, and other half-fare concessions were abolished, except those for wounded soldiers. Shortly afterwards, workmen's return fares were also withdrawn. In September, lost property charges were introduced of 2d. for articles claimed within the month, plus 1d. for each additional month thereafter. The cost to the Department for separation allowances to dependants of persons in the Forces was ¬£400 () per week at this time. 1918 Labour costs rose considerably during the latter part of the war, and a further wage award by the Committee on Production, together with increased cost of materials, made it necessary to consider further fare increases. The first scheme in March consisted of children's fares being made half adult fares and an alteration to ordinary stages, with no alteration to workmen's fares; this scheme was amended in April to revert to the old stages, with children's fares fixed at half the adult fare, with a 1d. minimum fare rising to 1¬Ωd. over a 2¬Ωd. and 3d. adult stage, and to 2d. over a 3¬Ωd. and 4d. stage. Ordinary fares of 1d. and 1¬Ωd. were increased by ¬Ωd. and all fares of 2d. and over were increased by 1d., the 1¬Ωd. minimum taking effect from Sunday 14 April. War Weapons Week was held from 15 to 20 July, and a few cars decorated for use as mobile National Savings booths were parked at the principal termini or loop lines. As a means of reducing current consumption in order to conserve coal supplies, the number of stopping places was reduced in July, followed by the starting of Sunday services at 2 p.m. instead of at 10 a.m. November saw the end of hostilities and a further wage increase. 1919 A children's fare of ¬Ωd. was introduced on 8 January over the adult 1¬Ωd. stage. In June 1917, an order was placed with Dick, Kerr for 35 car equipments for delivery when circumstances permitted. These were to replace the small motors supplied on the earlier cars, and early in 1919 Dick, Kerr intimated that they would be able to execute the order during the year. A further 12 bodies were ordered from Dick, Kerr for replacement purposes, together with two top covers to complete the top covering of all service cars. New tramcars were required to meet the increase in traffic and an order was placed with the English Electric Company Limited (successors to Dick, Kerr) for 25 cars. Later running, until 11 p.m., was agreed upon in May. Two months later, the issue of free passes to disabled ex-servicemen was restricted to those who were unable to walk freely. In October 1919 an amended route to Beeston was proposed, incorporating an extension of this route to Chilwell. This was to include two portions of reserved track, one approximately two miles long between Nottingham and Beeston, and the other, just over a mile long, between Beeston and Chilwell. A further proposal was for the extension of the Bulwell line to Hucknall. These proposals were carried by the Council, with only one dissension. Both these lines were incorporated in a Bill before Parliament in 1920, the Beeston and Chilwell line being passed, and the Hucknall line being passed subject to the completion of certain road works. Hucknall Urban District Council, the highway authority, objected to the line terminating in Hucknall Market Place; they were anxious for its extension to Annesley, but the Corporation was unwilling to do this because of the sparseness of the population between the two districts. 1920 Motorbuses were considered as an alternative to the proposed tramways to Beeston and Hucknall and powers for these two routes were granted under Section 18 of the 1920 Act. This Act further enabled the Corporation to run motorbuses on any route outside the city, provided that consent was obtained from the Minister of Transport and the local authority concerned. The first vehicles inaugurated a service to Bagthorpe, from the Bulwell tramway at its junction with the Lenton service at Bentinck Road, Radford, on 17 May, operating via Gregory Boulevard; it thus provided a link between Mansfield Road and Alfreton Road, broken since the withdrawal of the Forest Road horse-tram service. The new cars were numbered 156 to 180. Two were promised for December 1919, and two for each succeeding month, but owing to various strikes no cars arrived until May, when ten arrived, all without brakes: apparently the brake manufacturers were still on strike. Many complaints were coming in that there were insufficient cars on each service and the Manager stated that he had 27 cars off the road awaiting spares. A member of the council inquired as to when the newly arrived cars would be working, and when told about the brakes remarked about running a non-stop service. Many improvements took place at Trent Bridge at this time, and in June 1920 an automatic trolley pole reverser was installed. This did not remain in use long, as the principal terminus was shortly afterwards removed to the end of Victoria Embankment, a new kerbside loading line being put in at the same time. The old terminus by the bridge approach remained in use for football and other specials. A new single-track line was laid along the Embankment and Bathley Street to Trent Bridge Depot, the entrance to the depot was altered, and a new shed to hold 25 cars was built on the opposite side of Turney Street. At the Council meeting in June, ¬£41,000 () was allocated for new car bodies and trucks, and from then on it was the policy to have the lower saloon ends of the cars vestibuled. That meant that, with a few minor variations, there were to be two types of standard car, with either three or four side windows, but there were numerous variations. As cars came in for major repairs, they received a new lower saloon: if the lower saloon was in good condition it was vestibuled locally by a firm of body builders near Trent Bridge, Henry Street & Company Limited, whose works occupied part of the property forming the former horse-tram sheds on Muskham Street. The locally vestibuled types were easily recognisable by the red lights above the driver's head, which on these were of plain red glass, the ones on the new saloons being fluted; and the small side windows behind the stairs next to the saloon, which were divided into two, with small upper panes and large lower ones, the new ones having one complete pane. These overhauls were extremely thorough and by the time the car took the road it was equivalent to a new vehicle. Experiments were tried in fitting carbon skids for current collection instead of trolley wheels, and five cars were experimentally fitted: these were reputed to be nos. 74, 121, 136, 147 and 160; the last three definitely had skids. A bow collector was suggested, but as the skids were not considered a success, nothing further was done about this, and these cars later had wheels refitted. During this year, ¬£33,000 () was spent on track, and in order to keep costs down all facing point turnouts had a dummy tongue on one side: in the case of trailing points, both sides had dummy tongues. As far as can be ascertained, Nottingham was unique in having a complete system with these types of points. When a car had to take a two-dummy trailing junction in the facing direction, dextrous placing of a point iron in the track was required to make the car go in the required direction. Considerable difficulty was encountered in the Market Place at peak times in the control of the crowds, and a system of queuing was considered, visits being made to Leeds, Bradford and Sheffield to see similar systems there. Previously, on race cars to Colwick ordinary fares had been charged, but in October the fare was fixed at 6d. (). 1921 During May, the coal strike had its effect on services; cars ceased at the end of the evening peak hour on Mondays to Fridays and at 7.30 p.m. on Saturdays. There was no service on Sundays. Motorbuses were taken off the Bagthorpe and Dunkirk services in the evenings, two being run over the tram route to Bulwell and one to Sherwood. On 9 July normal running was resumed. The Council passed a resolution in June suggesting the operation of a fleet of motorbuses. This was followed by Barton Brothers of Beeston offering their business as a going concern, an offer that was turned down. Short workings were introduced to Thorneywood Lane (now Porchester Road) on the Carlton service about this time to meet increased traffic; they were extended to Standhill Road in October 1922. A complaint brought to the attention of the Notts. and Derbyshire Tramways Company in September was rather unusual, for it concerned the practice of certain drivers in running two cars in the same direction over the outward and the inward tracks between Church Street and Cinderhill. 1922 The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company were experiencing considerable competition from buses at this period, and reduced fares were introduced for visitors to Nottingham on the Wednesday and Saturday market days, with a consequent reduction in the amount payable to the Corporation. 1923 In August 1922 the question of running either tramcars or motorbuses to Beeston was raised and consideration given to their operation along University Boulevard. The trustees of Sir Jesse Boot intimated that they could not agree to the laying of a tramway along the boulevard, and consequently motorbuses were decided upon In June a further ten car body saloons were ordered from the English Electric Company, together with 20 D.B. lK3B controllers. Requests were continually being made by various departments and organisations to put work in hand to relieve unemployment and, in October, permission was given to go ahead with the relaying of Castle Boulevard and Lenton Boulevard as far as Derby Road, and along Sherwood Rise and Nottingham Road. The first section was relaid, but work on the other was deferred pending a report on the advisability of adopting this route for trolleybuses. Important fare concessions were given during the year. Following the withdrawal of 2d. workmen's fares on 11 January, a 2d. transfer was introduced on 1 February and finally the 1d. adult fare on trams was reintroduced on Sunday, 21 October. 1924 On 10 January, a deputation visited Birmingham to inspect the trolleybus system, following which a recommendation was made to introduce this system in place of all single-line tramways in the City. A provisional order was obtained to convert the Nottingham Road, Wilford Road and Wells Road sections. A limit of nine tons gross weight was imposed by the Ministry on these vehicles. Tram stops had been marked by a series of bands painted round the poles, but early in 1924 stops in the city centre were indicated by metal plates attached to the poles. On 10 June workmen's fares were made available until 8 a.m., an extension of half an hour, following the resumption of these fares on 10 March. 1925 Merit stars that carried a gratuity not exceeding 2/- per week were introduced in 1925 for employees with not less than 25 years‚Äô service. For some time approaches had been made to the Electricity Committee suggesting that they reduce the charges for current, and reductions took place in July. Another subject continually being raised was the formation of queues by intending passengers. Powers to enforce this had been granted in the 1920 Act, but nothing further was done in the matter until June, when experiments with a queuing system were decided upon. On 17 August an additional motorbus service was commenced from Clinton Street to Sneinton Dale. The decision to operate followed an application by a local operator to run a similar service. A 30-minute headway was operated at off-peak periods, increased to 15 minutes at peak periods. In September, an alternative service to Beeston was instituted via University Boulevard. In view of the operation of motorbuses along Hucknall Lane and to Beeston, powers in respect of tramway operation along these routes were allowed to lapse. The extension of the tramway to Westdale Lane was granted at the same time and the work put in hand, while the short extension of the Derby Road section to Wollaton Park Lodge Gates and trolleybus powers for Wells Road and Wilford Road were granted. By July a loss of ¬£30 per week () was being incurred on the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company‚Äôs working, and in October it was agreed that the fare between Parliament Street and Cinderhill be reduced from 3 ¬Ωd. to 2d., the Corporation to receive half this amount, as before. 1926 - New depot at Carter Gate On 1 January, the 25th anniversary of the electric tramway system, reduced fares came into operation. A start was made in April on building the new depot at Carter Gate (Parliament Street), with accommodation for buses, trams and trolleybuses. Trams were given eight roads, all with pits, the capacity being 80 cars. A most complicated layout of track leading to the depot was put in at same time, the intention being to build a single line for one-way traffic inward to the Market Place along Lower Parliament Street and Hockley, via Victoria Street and South Parade, the outward route, also single line and one-way traffic via Long Row and Pelham Street to Hockley. Hockley was a narrow thoroughfare that had been widened towards its junction with Lower Parliament Street, but, owing to the Corporation being unable to obtain a property higher up the street at a reasonable price, the whole scheme was later abandoned, although not before much track and pointwork had been laid. The double turnout at the bottom of Hockley had been in position for approximately six months when it was removed together with the short length of track leading to it, no car ever having run over it. Lines built in connection with the depot were along Southwell Road, with a three-way junction at Manvers Street, another three-way junction at Lower Parliament Street, and then along Lower Parliament Street to within 30 yards of Pennyfoot Street. There were trailing points from both lines into Stanhope Street, where the depot entrances were. A single line ran along Stanhope Street, with trailing junctions both ways into Manvers Street. The extension from the city boundary on Woodborough Road to Westdale Lane, the third portion to be constructed outside the city, opened for traffic on 7 June. During 1925, Barton Bros. started a service from Sandiacre via the city to Redhill and Arnold and to meet this competition the tram short working to Winchester Street at Sherwood was extended to Villiers Road and the working to Villiers Road extended to Daybrook early in 1926. On 11 March the transfer ticket system between tram services was extended to cover transfers between Sherwood trams and Bagthorpe buses. This proved satisfactory and further facilities were introduced. The fares on inward journeys on motorbuses operating services over roads common with trams were reduced to the tram level on 26 June. Suggestions had been made that the city's colours of green and red should be used as a livery on the vehicles, and after Railless Ltd. had forwarded a panel showing a proposed green livery, the suggestion was adopted that motorbuses and the projected trolleybuses be painted green and cream. Green with red piping was adopted for uniforms shortly afterwards. The British General Strike of 1926 caused disruption in the services, all services being suspended on and from 4 May. On 7 May, an emergency subcommittee of the Transport Committee met to consider the position and resolved that all employees should be instructed to report for duty on Monday, 10 May, failing which they had to return their uniform. On Monday 10 May 14 buses manned by volunteer crews were in service and on the next day this total was increased to 23, while Wednesday found 26 buses in operation. A meeting of the Tramways Emergency Sub-Committee was held on Wednesday 12 May, at which it was reported that the General Strike had been called off. It was resolved that all employees who had been on strike should apply for reengagement, giving an undertaking not to withdraw their services except after giving proper notice. On the following day 14 tramcars and 26 motorbuses were in service, full normal service being resumed on Friday 14 May. The volunteers who drove these buses during the strike period were given permanent employment if they so desired. The strike delayed the construction of the Carter Gate depot and also delivery of the trolleybuses, for the manufacturers were unable to obtain certain parts. In the meantime, facilities were afforded for the garaging of motorbuses at the City Engineer's premises at Eastcroft. A loss was still being made on the inter-running with the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company, but, as the Company had no practical suggestions to make, the matter was left in abeyance. Delivery of 20 new cars commenced later in the year; they were built by the English Electric Company of Preston, having 2x40 h.p. Dick, Kerr motors, Dick, Kerr controllers and equipment, and Brush P.22 trucks. They were totally enclosed, and the last 15 had leather upholstered seats on both decks. Five of the cars, nos. 185, 188, 189, 195 and 200, had roller bearings. Late in 1926 Sunday morning services were reduced for the first time in peacetime. 1927 - The last extension and the first closure 1 January marked a reduction in fares, this time the introduction of a 2d. maximum between the Market Place and any tram terminus. This reduction was primarily to compete with the rival bus services to some of the outer termini. The no. 8 tram service from Carlton was altered to operate via the Market Place and then round the Radford and Lenton circle. The remainder of the service, between the Market Place and Colwick Road via Station Street, was partially curtailed and replaced by a new un-numbered service between Colwick Road and Station Street, via Pennyfoot Street. The last extension of the tramway took place on 16 April, when the Derby Road route was extended from Gregory Street to Wollaton Park Gates, just over a quarter of a mile in length. This was inspected by Lt. Col. G. L. Hall on 19 May. The terminus was on a private track to the north side of the gate. Maximum tramway route mileage, 25.9 miles, existed for only a short while, from 7 June 1926, the date of the Mapperley extension, to 10 April 1927, when the Nottingham Road service was taken off. The Wollaton Park extension started a week after the first tram route was taken over by trolleybuses operating on the new Nottingham trolleybus system. 1928 - Changes in the Market Square The opening of the Arnold and West Bridgford motorbus services resulted in a reduction in the frequency of the tram service between Arnold and Trent Bridge, while the frequent Sherwood to Trent Bridge service was altered to run between Arnold and Wollaton Park. The rebuilding of the Council House and alterations to the Market Square resulted in the tram lines being moved to give more road space on the north side. During this year the Notts. & Derbys. Traction Act of 1928 enabled the abandonment of that tramway system, the introduction of trolleybuses in their stead, and to change the Company's name to Traction Company. The Corporation agreed not to oppose the Bill, the Company expressing willingness to pay the Corporation the cost of constructing and removing the Cinderhill tramway. The Corporation then applied for trolleybus powers over the route in 1929, agreeing that when trolleybuses were introduced the Corporation would take all the receipts and allow the Company a certain amount in return for working expenses. Subsequently, the Company intimated that they were desirous of substituting motorbuses instead, but later withdrew this. As the Wilford Road tram track needed repair, trolleybuses were again considered for this road and in September, following a report from the Manager regarding the whole of the services and types of traction, the decision was made to replace the single-line tram lines along Wells Road and Wilford Road with trolleybuses, and to apply for powers in the 1929 Parliamentary session to operate, in one direction, via George Street, Victoria Street and South Parade. It was also agreed that when further motorbuses were required, vehicles of larger capacity would be purchased in order to give a better service and improved peak hour facilities. J. Aldworth, the Manager, retired on 31 December, his place being taken on 1 January 1929, by W. G. Marks, formerly Manager of Chesterfield Corporation Transport and, before that, Deputy Manager of Rotherham Corporation Tramways. Others on the short list for the position were W. Boot, Rolling Stock Superintendent at Nottingham, and R. Hoggard, the Manager of Lincoln Corporation Transport. Hoggard was subsequently appointed to fill Marks‚Äô former position at Chesterfield. Carter Gate (renamed Parliament Street) depot and offices opened on 2 December, Trent Bridge depot becoming a workshop. Nottingham Corporation Passenger Transport Department=1929= The appointment of Marks as General Manager was followed by a lengthy period of development and expansion, indicated by a change of designation to ‚ÄúNottingham Corporation Passenger Transport Department‚Äù. Delay to Nottingham cars was being caused by Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company cars loading produce at the Parliament Street terminus, so henceforth they continued along to Sneinton Market to load. The operation of special trams and motorbuses to meet railway excursion trains commenced on 3 March, with a fare of 6d. for adults () and 3d. for children (). =1930= The operation of a motorbus service to Arnold, which started during the previous September at a fare of 2d., quickly had its effect on the services of Barton Bros., who withdrew on 3 November 1929, and J. Bloomfield, who operated three buses over a similar route. This resulted in the purchase of Bloomfield's business by the Corporation, the through fare immediately being raised to 3d. This, together with the opening of the Wells Road Wilford Road trolleybus service on 20 March, brought about tramcar working alterations. The frequency of the Arnold to Trent Bridge service was reduced, while alternate cars ran only between Villiers Road, Sherwood, and Trent Bridge. Cars previously running to Villiers Road were altered to serve Lenton and Radford, the London Road service being linked with that to Wollaton Park. Following experiments with Forest City type electrically operated points on the tram track at Woodborough Road and a set made by the Equipment and Engineering Company at the Queen Victoria Statue, a further eight of Forest City manufacture were purchased, enabling the release of 20 point boys. The Nottingham Corporation Bill of 1930 contained ambitious proposals for trolleybus operation which, had they been granted and put into full operation, would have required some 200 vehicles. These proposals covered the conversion of tram routes, together with extensions and linking services. The extensions comprised sectors from Carlton, via Station Road and Conway Road, returning via Burton Road and Main Street with a connection along Manor Road, via Main Street, Gedling Road and Westdale Lane to Mapperley; from Mapperley, along Plains Road to Spring Lane and via Woodthorpe Drive to Mansfield Road; via Sneinton Dale, Cardale Road, Thorneywood Lane, Porchester Road to Mapperley; in Arnold, via Mellors Road, Redhill Road, Mansfield Road to Daybrook Square; from Bulwell Market to the City boundary at Bulwell Hall Estate; along Ilkeston Road, Middleton Boulevard and Derby Road; via University Boulevard, Broadgate to Beeston; Queens Road and Chilwell bypass to Attenborough. A second route to Beeston was via Derby Road and Wollaton Road, together with a branch along Woodside Road, Lenton Abbey Estate. University Boulevard was deleted on account of legal difficulties encountered in the terms of Lord Trent's bequest of the land for the Boulevard. Although all the proposed routes were passed by the House of Commons, those not served by tramcars outside the city boundary were deleted by the House of Lords because of strong opposition by Nottinghamshire County Council and the Trent Motor Traction Company Limited. The remainder were passed, the Act imposing a 12-ton weight limit on the vehicles. The additional routes granted comprised those along Sneinton Dale, Cardale Road and Porchester Road to Woodborough Road; Canal Street, round Castle Boulevard, Lenton Boulevard, Radford Boulevard and Gregory Boulevard, thence via Mansfield Road, Huntingdon Street and Lower Parliament Street to Canal Street; along Derby Road and Woodside Road to the City boundary; Abbey Bridge to Greenfield Street at Lenton. A loan of ¬£781,000 () was authorised in connection with the conversion. It was intended that eventually the Aspley Estate should be looped from Cinderhill and that there should be an outer circle via Valley Road and Western Boulevard. =1931 - First tramcars sold= A promise had been made to Carlton Urban District Council that the Carlton tramway service would be the first to be converted to trolleybus operation. It was intended to connect this service with the Wollaton Park section by introducing trolleybuses in place of motorbuses via Ilkeston Road, continuing round Middleton Boulevard to Derby Road and returning via the Derby Road tram route to the city. In June, the tramway along Derby Road was cut back to the city side of the railway bridge while the bridge was rebuilt and widened, the motorbus service via Ilkeston Road to Wollaton Park being extended in August to Wollaton Park gates on Derby Road to cover the curtailment. The tram service was not reinstated for, on 29 November a circular trolleybus service was opened, the city terminus being at the Central Market. Despite the introduction of trolleybuses on the Nottingham Road, Wells Road and Wilford Road services, the strength of the tram fleet remained at 200 until May, when nine old cars were sold for ¬£20 10s. 0d. each =1932 - Lenton and Sherwood services curtailed= Due to difficulties with the turning arrangements at Carlton, the conversion of this route was not completed until March, and Lt. Col. Anderson inspected the route on 18 March, the last tram ran on 19 March, and trolleybuses commenced operation the next day. The service was linked with the route to Wollaton Park, and a turning circle was erected at Scalford Drive on Middleton Boulevard to enable vehicles to turn from Derby Road. On 15 May later services were introduced over the principal routes, some being extended to 11.20 p.m. This was followed on 5 September by the curtailment of off-peak tram services to Lenton and Sherwood. The Sherwood curtailment resulted in a saving of ¬£2,500 per annum. A further saving was made by removing tram track on Derby Road beyond Canning Circus for use in repair work elsewhere. =1933 - More trams sold= In February, a decision was made to go ahead at the earliest opportunity with the conversion of the Bulwell tramcar service to trolleybus operation, and an extension of the route to Bulwell Hall Estate. Before any action was taken, however, the Colwick Road route and both routes to Trent Bridge were included in the scheme, together with two routes not served by trams, i.e. Huntingdon Street, and Nuthall Road, between Bentinck Road and Stockhill Lane. Although no tramway abandonment had taken place since 1932, some 30 trams were considered as surplus to requirements in November, but the only price offered was ¬£13 per car, so they were dismantled by the Department, the bodies and scrap metal being sold separately. =1934= The conversion of the Bulwell and Arkwright Street routes to trolleybus operation was well in hand, together with the extension to Bulwell Hall Estate, and trolleybus services over these routes came into operation on Sunday 13 May. The conversion would have left one tram route in the west of the city, the Lenton and Radford service, which it had been intended to convert to trolleybuses before the Bulwell section. However, Gunn recommended its conversion to motorbuses to coincide with the Bulwell trolleybus conversion and this took place on 13 May. New oil-engined motorbuses were operated on this service, numbered 26, while the Monday to Friday peak hour tram service 27 between the Midland Station and Colwick Road was converted to petrol bus operation. =1935= In April, the Committee accepted the Manager's recommendation that the Mapperley tram service should be converted to motorbus operation, and it was hoped that this would happen before August. However, the matter was delayed on account of an 8d. increase in the tax on fuel oil. Proposals for this conversion were brought before the City Council, who approved, by a small majority, the use of motorbuses instead of trolleybuses. In November it was similarly agreed to convert the Arnold tramway. After the closing of the Colwick Road and the London Road tramways, the tramcar fleet was reduced to 40 cars. Six of the trucks from surplus cars were disposed of to Buenos Aires. Nottingham City Transport=1936 - The end of tramcar operation in Nottingham= The name of the undertaking was changed from Nottingham Corporation Passenger Transport Department to Nottingham City Transport. On 9 January officials went for a trial run over the Mapperley via Woodborough Road route in one of the new motorbuses destined to displace the trams on 2 February. Conversion work on some new buses entailed the alteration of Sherwood Depot to accommodate motorbuses, the remaining trams being transferred to Parliament Street. Some seven months later, on 6 September, the remaining tram service to Arnold was replaced by motorbuses. This ended the era of the tram in Nottingham. Twelve trams and one railgrinder were sold for only ¬£17 l0s. 0d. each () as a result of the first conversion. The remaining trams were sold after September, many of the 1927 cars to Aberdeen Corporation Tramways, where they worked for a further 15 years. A debt of ¬£65,000 () remained on the tramway system, this being repaid at the rate of ¬£24,000 () per annum.

It depended not on the services, but on the wants of the applicants: the employers being repaid out of the poor rate (local taxation) all they advanced in wages beyond a very low-wage amount. Variants of the Roundsman system operated and co-existed from parish-to-parish and sometimes depending on type of labour. Details According to this plan the parish in general agreed with a farmer to sell to him the labour of one or more paupers at a certain price, paying to the pauper out of the parish funds the difference between that price and the subsistence rate (the difference being an allowance which the scale, according to the price of bread and the number of his family, awarded him). It received the local name of \\"billet\\" or \\"ticket system\\" from the ticket signed by the overseer which the pauper in general carried to the farmer as a warrant for his being employed, and afterwards took back to the overseer, signed by the farmer, as a proof that he had fulfilled the conditions of relief. In other cases and parishes the parish contracted with a person to have some work performed for him by the paupers at a given price, the parish paying the paupers from that person and general funds. Labour auctions In many parishes the roundsman system was conducted by means of an auction, all the unemployed men being put up to sale periodically, sometimes monthly or weekly, at prices varying according to the time of year, the old and infirm selling for less than the able-bodied.

During the 1970s, Bandy became one of the most well known and highest paid make-up artists in the fashion industry. Photographer and frequent collaborator Francesco Scavullo called Bandy \\"one of the great makeup artists of our time.\\" Early life Bandy was born Ronald Duane Wright in Birmingham, Alabama, the second of three sons of a middle-class family. Bandy later admitted that his childhood was difficult as he was not interested in \\"traditional masculine things‚Äîfishing, hunting, baseball\\" like his brothers. As a child, Bandy preferred to read, sew and take piano lessons. His love of movie magazines and the stars featured in the pages led him to begin portrait paintings. He said, \\"I would make them up the way I thought they should look. That's how I learned about cosmetics‚Äîit's a direct outgrowth of my painting.\\" After high school, Bandy attended Birmingham‚ÄìSouthern College where he was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. After two years, he dropped out to work as a department store model. He later enrolled in Tennessee Technological University where he earned a degree in education. Upon graduation, he got a job teaching elementary and high school English in Tennessee and then in Maryland. During this period, Bandy got married. In the summer of 1965, he and his wife visited New York City. Bandy later said, \\"The minute we arrived I knew I would never go back to my former life. This was a new beginning.\\" Bandy quit his teaching job and he and his wife separated. Career After moving to New York City in 1966, Bandy enrolled at the Christine Valmy Beauty School. It was there that he learned about proper skin cleansing and structure and became interested in makeup application. Bandy then became the school's \\"dermaspecialist\\" and was later assigned to teach makeup application techniques to students. The school was one of the first in New York to offer such a course. Around this time, Bandy set about reinventing himself. He underwent a nose job and face lift and capped his teeth. He also changed his name to \\"Way Bandy\\" explaining, \\"The name just came into my consciousness.\\" After his reinvention, Bandy never publicly discussed the details of his previous life and refused to reveal his birth name or real age. In 1969, Bandy was hired as the makeup director at Charles of the Ritz where he met photographer Francesco Scavullo. Scavullo was impressed by Bandy's \\"face designing\\" techniques and the two became frequent collaborators. In 1971, he left Charles of the Ritz to do makeup for the Broadway show No, No, Nanette. After the show closed, Bandy began working as a freelance makeup artist for print, television and films. Bandy's work was featured in editorials for Vogue, Cosmopolitan, Harper's Bazaar and Rolling Stone. He also worked with several noted photographers including Scavullo, Richard Avedon, Hiro, Horst P. Horst, Helmut Newton, Irving Penn, and Victor Skrebneski. Bandy‚Äôs career took off when he and hairstylist Maury Hopson transformed Martha Beall Mitchell, the wife of United States Attorney General John N. Mitchell, during a photo session with Francesco Scavullo for New York magazine. Bandy's emphasis on skin care (he used cold pressed avocado or olive oil to cleanse client's faces) and natural makeup he created and mixed himself made him a favorite among celebrities. Over the course of his career, Bandy was hired by Catherine Deneuve, Farrah Fawcett (Bandy did her makeup for the 1978 film Somebody Killed Her Husband), Elizabeth Taylor, Cher, Diana Ross, Lee Radziwill, Gloria Vanderbilt, and Barbra Streisand. In 1976, Margaux Hemingway requested that he be her personal makeup artist for her film debut in the thriller Lipstick. Bandy also appeared in the film as a makeup artist. Bandy also did work for commercials and television. By the late 1970s, Bandy was charging $2,000 a session for makeup application and earned over $100,000 a year. In 1977, Random House published Bandy's first book, Designing Your Face: An Illustrated Guide to Using Cosmetics. The book includes step by step techniques that teach Bandy's signature style of heavy, yet clean and all natural makeup application. The book became a best seller. In 1982, Random House released his second book, Styling Your Face: An Illustrated Guide to 15 Cosmetic Face Designs for Women and Men. Four months before his death, he did then First Lady Nancy Reagan's makeup for a photo spread that appeared in the September 1986 edition of Harper's Bazaar. Personal life Bandy separated from his wife in 1965, but the two never divorced. He began a long term relationship with writer and antiques dealer Michael Gardine in 1973. The two shared an apartment in New York City and owned homes in Nantucket and Key West, Florida. They remained together until Gardine's death from AIDS in 1985. Illness and death By the mid-1980s, the AIDS epidemic was spreading throughout the United States and would claim the lives of many fashion industry figures. Bandy's friend, hairstylist Maury Hobson, later said that he and Bandy became fearful of contracting the disease after both had what Hobson described as a \\"running crazy period\\". The two, who had never been romantically involved, decided to become celibate and adopted a macrobiotic diet to help boost their immune systems. Bandy was already a well known devotee to naturopathy, iridology, and vegetarianism after he contracted pneumonia and pleurisy in 1962. He routinely soaked organic vegetables in a solution of bleach and distilled water (one half teaspoon in a gallon of water) believing that \\"Clorox raises its energy level and removes insecticides.\\" He also requested bottled water when he was on tour promoting his book as he believed tap water contained impurities. Intensely private about his personal life, Bandy never publicly revealed that he had contracted AIDS sometime in the early 1980s, fearing the stigma of the disease would cause him to lose work. He and friend Maury Hobson had previously discussed their displeasure with the way that designer Perry Ellis' AIDS-related death had been handled and promised each other that if either died of the disease, their true cause of death would be publicly announced. In June 1986, Bandy developed a persistent cough and sore throat but refused to see a doctor because he did not trust them. He instead opted to treat his ailments with natural remedies which did not help. Bandy's health continued to decline. On August 6, 1986, Bandy was scheduled to do makeup for a photo shoot at Francesco Scavullo's studio. When he arrived at the studio, he was too exhausted and delirious to work. Concerned about her client's declining health, Bandy's agent Helen Murray called former Vogue editor-in-chief Grace Mirabella for advice. Mirabella contacted her husband, a doctor, who convinced Bandy to check into the hospital. Bandy relented and checked into New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center the following day. On August 13, Bandy died of AIDS-related pneumocystis carinii pneumonia at the age of 45. He was cremated and a memorial service was later held in Manhattan. His ashes, along with the ashes of his lover Michael Gardine, were later scattered in a pine forest in Key West, Florida by his friend and estate executor Maury Hobson. Per his request, Bandy's cause of death was identified as AIDS-related in his obituary. He also requested that no survivors be named. Legacy Way Bandy has been cited as one of the first well known makeup artists. Hairstylist and friend Maury Hobson noted that before Bandy began his career, models applied their own makeup for photo shoots. Hobson stated, \\"He put make-up artists into another category. [...] He defined the career.\\" Sandy Linter, a makeup artist who began her career in the early 1970s and worked with Bandy, said of him, \\"His technique was flawless. He did that signature Way Bandy make-up: precise and clean.\\" Bandy's signature techniques influenced a generation of makeup artists including Kevyn Aucoin who cited Bandy as his personal hero.

It was served by three railway stations for many years, and is now served by two. Cromer Beach station, which opened in 1887, was renamed Cromer following the closure of the other early stations. Layout of the four Cromer railway stations; the Great Eastern Railway lines are in red, the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway line in blue, and the disused Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway line to Mundesley in orange. Cromer High station, on the outskirts of the town, was opened in 1877 as the terminus of the Great Eastern Railway main line from London. It was followed in 1887 by Cromer Beach station, on the rural Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway (M&GNJR;). Cromer Links Halt station, on the little-used and now closed Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway line to North Walsham Town via Overstrand and Mundesley, was opened in 1923. A British Rail Class 101 in Regional Railways livery. Following a reduction in traffic caused by Cromer's decline in popularity as a holiday destination after World War II, and the closure of many Norfolk railway lines in the 1950s, a decision was made to concentrate all passenger traffic into a single station. Although Cromer High had far better facilities, it was inconveniently situated on the edge of the town. Therefore, all passenger services were diverted into Cromer Beach (renamed Cromer) and the other stations closed. Following growth of the town as a commuter town to Norwich, a new station called Roughton Road opened in 1985, near the site of the former Cromer High. Cromer railway station Because the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway (M&GNJR;) line approached Cromer from the west, following the coastal clifftops, it avoided the steep escarpment which had prevented the earlier line from Norwich running all the way into the town. Consequently, it became possible to build a far more conveniently located station, near to the town centre and the beach. The station opened as Cromer Beach on 16 June 1887 and was renamed Cromer on 20 October 1969, following the closure of Cromer High station in 1954. It is down the line from . Roughton Road railway station Roughton Road was opened on 20 May 1985, to serve the new housing developments in the area.

It served as the terminus of Great Eastern Railway services from London and Norwich. Initially named Cromer on opening, it was renamed Cromer High on 27 September 1948. =Cromer Links Halt railway station= Cromer Links Halt (located at ) was a railway station on the outskirts of Cromer.

The planned railroad would start at the mouth of Whites Creek on the Big Sandy River in Wayne County, West Virginia and would proceed to the East Fork of Twelvepole Creek and eventually to the Guyandotte River near Logan, Logan County, West Virginia. The railroad was planned to pass through the town of East Lynn in Wayne County, West Virginia. The first leg of the railroad was from the town of Wayne, WV to the town of East Lynn, WV and the first trains ran in the fall of 1903. However, the railroad was never completed from the Big Sandy River to the Guyandotte. The Big Sandy, East Lynn and Guyan Railroad sold all of their rights-of-way to the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1908 and went out of business in 1911.

It was founded in 1902 by the Benedictine monks of Savannah Priory, which still operates the school, under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Savannah. History { class=\\"toccolours\\" cellspacing=\\"3px\\" style=\\"width: 24em; float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; text- align:left;\\" Leo Haid's coat of arms, a lion with ten stars above (symbolizing the ten monks who first arrived), is still used to this day at Benedictine. } Starting in 1874, Benedictine monks had gone to Georgia from St. Vincent Abbey in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, at the invitation of William Hickley Gross, C.Ss.R., at that time the Roman Catholic Bishop of Savannah. He was acting in response to a mandate given to all the Catholic bishops of the nation at the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore, held in 1866, to establish missions to the newly emancipated African American slaves. Two separate attempts were made to establish such a mission. By about 1900, both had failed. Having decided to place themselves under the authority of Leo Haid, O.S.B., the Abbot Nullius of Belmont Abbey in North Carolina, ten monks established a monastery in the city at 31st and Habersham Streets, where they served Sacred Heart Parish. Recognizing the need for a Catholic boys' school, they established Benedictine College in 1902. In 1906, the groundbreaking ceremony was performed on the ground that would become the school's campus on Bull Street. In 1920, the school changed its name to Benedictine School because of the confusion that Benedictine was a college. However, the nickname \\"BC\\" stuck. In 1963, the school moved to its current campus located on Seawright Drive on the south side of Savannah. Shortly after moving to the new location, the priory elected to return to the authority of St. Vincent Archabbey in Latrobe. Along with this change came the removal of the four year mandatory military program, with reduction to two years mandatory. Academics Benedictine's curriculum is College Preparatory. Advanced Placement classes are offered in Language, Literature, Calculus, Environmental Science, Human Geography, Biology, Government, American History, Economics and European History, in conjunction with a religious curriculum that caters to Catholic and Jewish demographics. The JROTC program at Benedictine, with over 350 cadets, is one of the largest in the Sixth ROTC Brigade. = Organization = Benedictine Military School organizes its military program based on an actual U.S. Army formation. Everyone in JROTC is part of the brigade, which is commanded by an outstanding senior student with the rank of cadet colonel, assisted by an executive officer (XO) who holds the rank of cadet lieutenant colonel. Below that the unit's organization continues to follow traditional army regulations: three battalions each commanded by a senior with the rank of cadet lieutenant colonel and an XO with the rank of cadet major; and nine companies total, three in each battalion, commanded by a cadet captain and a cadet first lieutenant as XO, including a headquarters company (1st Battalion) and a band company (2nd Battalion), organized very differently than the seven \\"regular\\" companies (3rd Battalion is the only unit to have three regular companies; the others each have only two). In the seven regular companies (lettered A through G) are two platoons each, commanded by a cadet first lieutenant. The lowest level of command is a squad, usually commanded by a junior with the rank of cadet sergeant first class; however, there are often a handful of squads led by some outstanding sophomores who hold the rank of cadet staff sergeant. Squad strengths vary but normally are around five or six, with at least two squads assigned to each platoon. Sometimes fire teams are organized, but they never operate independently of the squad, and their \\"leaders\\" (usually sophomores) have little real responsibility or authority. Another special unit that is part of headquarters company is the brigade color guard, consisting of anywhere from six to twelve freshmen and sophomores, normally some of the top cadets commanded by a cadet staff sergeant. The brigade color guard is separate from the varsity color guard team and the drill team, which are considered quasi-sports teams that compete in multiple drill competitions in the spring, with the first competition always taking place at Benedictine (others are held throughout south Georgia). The brigade color guard takes part in numerous civic, military, and other public functions throughout the Savannah area during the school year, averaging several dozen. When the brigade is completely formed up in marching order (such as during the St. Patrick's Day Parade) the color guard marches just behind the brigade commander and his staff in the front, with two riflemen (carrying real rifles that have been de-militarized) on the ends \\"protecting\\" the flag bearers in the middle, flying the U.S., Georgia, and Irish flags (the Irish flag is only carried during the parade). During the parade battalion color guards are also temporarily formed, consisting of the two riflemen and a cadet carrying a JROTC flag. Each company also has a guidon bearer (a freshman or sophomore), who marches in front with the company commander. The top ranks freshmen and sophomores may obtain are cadet corporal and cadet staff sergeant, respectively. The reason there are no cadet second lieutenants in the brigade is due to the fact that some JROTC units promote their juniors to officer rank, and it was decided long ago that no BC senior should be outranked by a junior from another school. Juniors hold all senior NCO ranks, ranging from cadet sergeant first class to cadet command sergeant major (CSM). All seniors are, of course, officers following the same rank structure as the regular army. The brigade and each battalion also have a full staff, once again organized like the army. The brigade staff consists of an S-1 (personnel/administrative), S-3 (plans and operations), S-4 (supply), and S-5 (public affairs). Each brigade staff officer holds the rank of cadet lieutenant colonel, and each also has several assistants, including a junior serving as a sergeant major. There is also a brigade ordnance officer, a cadet major, who serves under the brigade S-4 (when marching he marches as part of HQ Company, not with the staff). Each battalion also has an S-1, S-3, and S-4 who are cadet captains and have an NCO with the rank of cadet master sergeant to assist. Unlike the army, the battalion staff officers are really under the control of the brigade staff instead of the battalion XO, which leaves the XO with little to do unless the CO is not present. There are also several other important NCO positions held by juniors ‚Äì the brigade CSM, battalion CSM (3), company first sergeant (9), and platoon sergeants (who wear the stripes of a master sergeant). Normally, these positions lead to the corresponding positions senior year (though some are moved around to fill the XO positions, which have no equivalent NCO position). The JROTC unit at Benedictine Military School has held the honor of being an Honor Unit with Distinction, which means that it is one of the top JROTC programs in the entire country. Benedictine has held the honor ever since it was created. It is decided by a variety of factors, including \\"points\\" accumulated throughout the year for participating in public events and also the Regional Formal Inspection (RFI) held in February, conducted by officers and NCOs from U.S. Army Cadet Command who grade a wide range of factors (including a uniform inspection of the entire brigade formed up at attention in Class A uniforms). = Staff/instructors = The current senior army instructor (SAI), who is in charge of the JROTC program, is Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Suhr . The sophomore JROTC class is taught by Chief Warrant Officer 4 Don Schaefer, who served as a helicopter pilot in the Aviation Branch while in the army. Chief Schaefer holds the position of operations officer (basically S-3) and coach of the rifle team. Master Sergeant Reinaldo Osorio, who served as a medic and is the first instructor new cadets will experience as he teaches the freshman JROTC class. Sergeant Osorio is also in charge of personnel/administration (basically S-1), is the advisor to the brigade color guard, and serves as coach of the varsity color guard. In addition to the four full-time instructors, Mr. Cyril Durant, the music instructor, serves as the instructor for the band. All of the instructors are retired from the U.S. Army with nearly a century of service total, not including their years at BC. They also hold many high military awards and decorations both from America and foreign countries, including six Bronze Stars with Valor device (LTC Owens), Purple Heart (LTC Owens), Legion of Merit (MSG Osorio), Air Medal with Valor device (CW4 Schaefer), and Meritorious Service Medal. Also included is Master Sergeant Smith, who instructs the junior JROTC class (LTC LaRossa, CW4 Schaefer, MSG Smith, MSG Osorio). Student life=Athletics= Up until 2004, BC had always competed in Georgia's highest classification. In 2004, the school dropped to AAA. In 2008, to AA. In 2010, BC returned to Region 3-AAAAA. Currently, BC is in Region 2-AA of the GHSA. Benedictine won state championships in soccer (2017, 2018), baseball (1961, 2014, 2018), golf (1983, 1985, 1993), and football (2014, 2016). During the 2009‚Äì2010 school year BC won eight region 2-AA championships. The athletic program finished second in the Boys' Athletic Director's Cup Standings, which recognizes the best athletic programs in the state. In the past eight years BC has finished no lower than 17th in the Cup standings, including four Top 10 finishes. For a third consecutive year, BC earned the distinction of being the #1 athletic program in southeast Georgia as determined by the Georgia Athletic Director's Association. The Benedictine football program ranks 23rd in all-time wins in the state of Georgia and has won 8 region titles. Two Benedictine coaches have eclipsed the 200 win mark in Jim Walsh and Bob Herndon. Benedictine football games have traditionally been played at Memorial Stadium since the 1960s, following decades of home games at Grayson Stadium in Daffin Park. Since 2012, all home football games have been played at Savannah State University's T.A. Wright Stadium. The Cadet football team has won two state championships, one in 2014 and one in 2016, both under coach Danny Britt. They defeated Greater Atlanta Christian in the GHSA Class AA State Championship and win 45-21 claiming their first state title. In 2016 the Cadets defeated Fitzgerald High School 49‚Äì26 in the 2016 GHSA Class AA State Championship avenging their 54‚Äì28 loss to Fitzgerald in the state quarterfinals the previous year. The Cadet soccer program won back to back state championships in 2017 and 2018. In the 2017 matchup, they defeated Coosa by a score of 4‚Äì1. In a repeat performance in 2018, the Cadets downed Putnam County by a score of 7‚Äì1. Coaches Charlie Moore and Jack Turbiville were at the helm for both titles. =Student traditions= The Corps of Cadets has marched in every St. Patrick's Day parade in Savannah since 1903. There has been a football rivalry with Savannah High School since the 1920s; a past tradition of many decades was the Thanksgiving Day contest between the two schools. However, they have not played since 2011 due to region alignments. The Cadets have begun a rivalry with Vidalia High School since joining Region 2 AA in 2012. George K. Gannam, a 1938 Benedictine graduate, was killed during the attack on Pearl Harbor and was the first Savannah resident to die during World War II. The school holds a military review and formal ceremony on or around Pearl Harbor Day (December 7) each year to commemorate Staff Sergeant Gannam. The American Legion Post 184, named in his honor, presents the Gannam Award to the most outstanding sophomore cadet, and the God and Country Award to an outstanding senior cadet. The school presents the Gannam family an American flag which, in turn, the Gannam family gives back to the school to fly on the flagpole for the following year. The Benedictine fight song is sung to the tune of the Washington and Lee Swing. Upperclassmen expect freshmen to correctly recite the fight song within the first days of a new school year. The song is sung by students, alumni, and friends at almost every athletic and school sponsored events. Notable alumni * John \\"Hook\\" Dillon (1941) - basketball player * SSG George K.

The former security was first created by the 1283 Statute of Merchants, or Statute of Acton Burnell (named after Acton Burnell in Shropshire, the place where Parliament met and passed the statute) and amplified by the 1285 Statute of Merchants 1285, whence its name, and the latter by an act of 1353, which provided that in every staple (i.e. public mart) the seal of the staple should be sufficient validity for a bond of record acknowledged and witnessed before the mayor of the staple. They were originally permitted only among traders, for the benefit of commerce, but afterwards extended by an act of Henry VIII (1532) to all subjects, whether traders or not. The creditor under either form of security was allowed to seize the goods and hold the lands of a defaulting debtor until satisfaction of his debt. While he held the lands he was termed tenant by statute merchant or by statute staple. In addition to the loss of his goods and lands the debtor was liable to be imprisoned. Statute merchant, owing to the summary method of enforcing payment, was sometimes known as pocket judgment. Both were repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1863. An example of a suit of Statute Merchant can be seen in the Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas, in 1430, where John Salter, citizen & tanner of York, John Wyot, vicar of St Nicholas, Mikelgate, John Yoman, (the latter 2 as executors of Henry Ravenswath) are parties.

It is encoded by the VCAN gene. Versican is a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan with an apparent molecular mass of more than 1000kDa. In 1989, Zimmermann and Ruoslahti cloned and sequenced the core protein of fibroblast chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. They designated it versican in recognition of its versatile modular structure. Versican belongs to the lectican protein family, with aggrecan (abundant in cartilage), brevican and neurocan (nervous system proteoglycans) as other members. Versican is also known as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan core protein 2 or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 2 (CSPG2), and PG-M.  Structure  These proteoglycans share a homologous globular N-terminal, C-terminal, and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding regions. The N-terminal (G1) globular domain consists of Ig-like loop and two link modules, and has Hyaluronan (HA) binding properties. Versican occurs in 5 isoforms : V0, V1, V2, V3, V4. The central domain of versican V0 contains both the GAG-Œ± and GAG-Œ≤ domains. V1 isoforms has the GAG-Œ≤ domain, V2 has the GAG-Œ± domain, V3 is void of any GAG attachment domains and V4 has a portion of the GAG-Œ≤ domain. The GAGs, being composed of repeating disaccharide units, contribute to the negative charge and many other properties of proteoglycans. The C-terminal (G3) globular domain consists of one or two Epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats, a C-type lectin domain and complement regulatory protein (CRP)-like domain. The C-terminal domain binds a variety of ligands in ECM which contribute significantly to the functions of lecticans.  Function  The role of versican in cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation has been extensively studied. Versican is often considered an anti-adhesion molecule. Considering the large size (>1000 kDa) and hydration capability of versican, it is possible that the interaction of integrins (large family of cell adhesion molecules) with their cell surface receptors is sterically hindered. Expression of versican is observed in various adult tissues such as blood vessels, skin, and developing heart. Smooth muscle cells of blood vessels, epithelial cells of skin, and the cells of central and peripheral nervous system are a few examples of cell types that express versican physiologically. Versican is involved in development, guiding embryonic cell migration important in the formation of the heart and outlining the path for neural crest cell migration. = N-terminus = The N-terminal of versican has an important role in maintaining the integrity of the ECM by interacting with hyaluronan. Its interactions with link protein has also been studied. = Glycosaminoglycan binding region = The central domain of Versican is decorated with glycosaminoglycans. The structural and functional diversity of Versican is increased by variations in GAG sulfation patterns and the type of GAG chains bound to the core protein. There is a single versican gene, however alternative splicing of its mRNA produces 4 distinct versican isoforms that differ in their potential number of GAG chains. All isoforms have homologous N-terminal (HA binding) and C-terminal (lectin-like) domains. The central domain of versican V0 contains both the GAG-Œ± and GAG-Œ≤ domains. V1 isoforms has the GAG-Œ≤ domain, V2 has the GAG-Œ± domain, and V3 is void of any GAG attachment domains, and only consists of the N-terminal and C-terminal globular domains. It is known that the isoforms are differentially expressed in different tissue types. The biological significance of alternative splicing is yet to be determined. Because of their negatively charged sulfates or carboxyl groups, chondroitin sulfate chains are attracted to various positively charged molecules such as certain growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines. This interaction in the extracellular matrix or on the cell surface is important in the formation of immobilized gradients of these factors, their protection from proteolytic cleavage, and their presentation to specific cell-surface receptors. The binding of versican with leukocyte adhesion molecules L-selectin, P-selectin, and CD44 is also mediated by the interaction of CS chains of versican with the carbohydrate-binding domain of these molecules. Both CD44 and L-selectin have been implicated in leukocyte trafficking. The ability of versican to bind a large panel of chemokines and the biological consequences of such binding has also been examined. Versican can bind specific chemokines through its CS chains and this interaction down- regulates the chemokines function. Recently, in light of results that V1 and V2 isoforms of versican have opposite effects on cell proliferation, glycosaminoglycan domain GAG-Œ≤ has been implicated in versican-enhanced cell proliferation and versican-induced reduction of cell apoptosis. = C-terminus = The C-terminal of Versican interacts with a variety of molecules in the matrix. One important family of ligands is the tenascin family. For example, The C-lectin domain of versican interacts with tenascin R through its fibronectin type III (FnIII) repeat 3-5 domain in a calcium dependent manner, in vivo. Different tenascin domains interact with a wide range of cellular receptors, including integrins, cell adhesion molecules and members of the syndecan and glypican proteoglycan families. Versican‚Äôs C-terminal domain interacts with fibulin-2, a protein whose expression is associated with that of versican in the developing heart. The EGF domain of the C-terminal of versican also binds the EGF-receptor molecule in vivo.  Clinical significance  Versican is a key factor in inflammation through interactions with adhesion molecules on the surfaces of inflammatory leukocytes and interactions with chemokines that are involved in recruiting inflammatory cells. In the adult central nervous system, versican is found in perineuronal nets, where it may stabilize synaptic connections. Versican can also inhibit nervous system regeneration and axonal growth following an injury to the central nervous system. = Cancer and metastasis = Increased versican expression is often observed in tumor growth in tissues such as breast, brain, ovary, gastrointestinal tract, prostate, and melanoma, sarcoma, and peritoneal mesothelioma. A fifth isoform of versican, V4, that is similar to V1 but with a shortened beta-GAG region, is present and upregulated in human breast cancer. Versican is required for Lewis lung carcinoma in mice to metastasize to lung, liver and adrenal glands, acting via TLR2 to activate myeloid cells and produce TNF-alpha. = Lung disorders = Versican is increased in the changing tissue extracellular matrix in inflammatory lung disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Cells (myofibroblasts, macrophages and other inflammatory cells) can migrate more easily through extracellular matrix that has a higher versican content. = Skin disorders = Deposits of versican are not present in normal skin but are found in the reticular dermis during keloid scarring, a condition where scar formation becomes uncontrolled and overgrowth of skin tissue occurs at the site of the wound. Interactions Versican has been shown to interact with hyaluronan and a link protein (hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1; HAPLN1).

It is down the line from (including the reversal at ). Its three-letter station code is SHM. It was opened by British Rail on 2 January 1967 replacing the original station in Sheringham opened by the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, which is located across the road, enabling the closure of the level crossing there. The original station subsequently became the terminus of the North Norfolk Railway heritage line. At the time of opening, the railway itself was listed for closure - with the basic timber platform provided being intended to cover only the last months of the line's operation.Proposed withdrawal of passenger services between Norwich - Sheringham. 1967 The station is situated on the southern edge of the town centre, but within walking distance of the beach. It is currently managed by Greater Anglia, which also operates all trains serving it. Services The station is currently served by one train per hour to Norwich on Mondays-Saturdays reducing to a train every two hours on Sundays Rebuild The old platform, intended as a temporary structure when the line was scheduled for closure. This photograph was taken before the restoration of the level crossing, showing the buffer stops that marked the limit of operation at that time. With the pending introduction of longer Stadler FLIRT Class 755 units by Abellio Greater Anglia, the temporary station platform was finally scheduled to be replaced. The replacement platform would be doubled in length, at 80 metres, and fitted with improved lighting and shelter. The station was due to be closed Sunday 31 March to Sunday 5 May 2019 for the works to be completed. In April, it was reported that the reopening of the station would be delayed due to a fault with supplied components. Further delays were then caused by issues with signalling. The new station finally opened in late May 2019. Connection with the North Norfolk Railway The second train to use the new level crossing, April 2010 Between 2007 and 2010, work was undertaken to reinstate the original level crossing across the road to allow trains from Norwich to run onto the North Norfolk Railway (NNR) heritage line tracks. The BBC reported in December 2007 that Network Rail supported the plans to allow occasional crossing of the tracks for trains onto the heritage route. Work began in January 2010 with the moving of the NNR headshunt to slew into line with the National Rail section. The link was reinstated in March 2010 when the first passenger train over the new crossing was steam locomotive ‚ÄòOliver Cromwell‚Äô, hauling a train from London Liverpool Street.NNR Sheringham Level Crossing . Occasional uses by charter trains and visiting rolling stock are anticipated not to exceed 12 times a year. The North Norfolk Railway also operate a number of dining trains over the entire surviving section of the M&GN;, between Holt and Cromer, during Summer months. Services began in 2016, working in partnership with the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, who were already a licensed operator on Network Rail. These services do not stop at the Network Rail station.

The double telescope's construction began in the 1930s with a grant from the Carnegie institution, although it was not completed until the 1960s when a second lens was added. The telescope is not designed for visual observation, rather it has two lenses used for taking photographs for a specific wavelength recorded on a film emulsion. It was used for photographic sky surveys in the late 20th century, which were successfully completed. The overall goal of the telescope was to study the \\"problem of galactic rotation and proper motion.. \\" The first survey was conducted between 1947 and 1954, using the blue-light corrected lens which was installed in 1946. Lenses: *Ross-Fecker lens added in 1946 Corrected for blue light *Perkin-Elmer lens added in 1962 Corrected for yellow light, four elements The double telescope is on a precision equatorial mount. It was designed for astrophotographic surveys, and two noted results were the Shane-Wirtanen galaxy counts and the Lick Northern Proper Motion project. The Carnegie twin refractor is located in a mid-sized dome at the observatory. Because the Carnegie is actually two telescopes, side by side on a single mount, it looks more like a large set of very long binoculars rather than a telescope. One side is designed to photograph blue light and the other yellow light. The Carnegie was built expressly to measure the motions of as many stars as possible in our local area of the Milky Way. Called the Lick Proper Motion Survey, the Carnegie's mission was to photograph the entire night sky twice; once in the 1950s and again 20 years later. By comparing both sets of photographs, much was learned about the motion of stars and the structure of our galaxy. The Carnegie is not used today except when photographs of a wide area of the sky are needed. The telescope was built by Warner & Swasey according to a design by Doctor F.E. Ross. The second lens was not installed until 1962, and was corrected for yellow light. The second lens was manufactured by Perkin-Elmer. This lens has four elements, including two crown elements and two flint elements. The clear aperture of the first element surface is 21.5 inches and the entire lens weighs 820 pounds including all four elements.

Biography  Carl Kellner was born in Hirzenhain, Wetteraukreis, in Hesse. In 1849 he founded in Wetzlar a company called \\"Optisches Institut\\" for the production of lenses and microscopes. Kellner had invented a new achromatic combination of lenses for an eyepiece, published in his treatise Das orthoskopische Ocular, eine neu erfundene achromatische Linsencombination, that was able to produce an image with correct perspective and without the distortions that were usual for other optical instruments of the time. His invention is still useful and known as the Kellner eyepiece.  Legacy  After his early death in Wetzlar in 1855 from tuberculosis at the age of 29, his widow led the company, which had twelve employees at that time. In 1856, she married her employee Friedrich Belthle (February 27, 1829 - May 9, 1869), who from then on managed the company. In 1864, precision mechanic Ernst Leitz joined them; he became a partner on October 7, 1865, took over the company in 1869 and re-founded it as the Ernst Leitz GmbH.

The prior Georgia Power headquarters building was in downtown Atlanta at the corner of Alabama and Forsyth streets in the former Atlanta Constitution Building. Passive solar design Completed in 1981 the building utilizes 4,500 tons (4,000 metric tons) of structural steel, and its floors have a passive solar design, with each floor on the south-facing side extending beyond the one below. In summer, when the sun is high in the sky, each extension partially shades the windows below; in winter, when the sun is lower in the southern sky, it shines directly into the windows to assist with space heating. This design allows for the building to use nearly 60% less energy than most other buildings of the sort. Because of this incremental increase in floor size from the ground to the roof on the southern facade, the building is sometimes referred to as the \\"Leaning Tower of Power\\". Solar thermal project When the building opened, it featured an experimental solar thermal project on the south plaza [see \\"Further reading\\" below], which was dismantled after a few years due to maintenance costs and scarcity and expense of replacement parts.

His paintings are hung today in Germany's leading museums, including the National Gallery Berlin, Breslau Museum and the Brunn Museum. His son, Karl M√ºcke, was also a recognized genre painter. Heinrich M√ºcke was a professor at the D√ºsseldorf Academy and received the Portuguese Medal for Art and Sciences as well as the Breslau Medal. He is associated with the D√ºsseldorf school of painting. Early life and travels Heinrich M√ºcke was born in Breslau, then in Prussia and today in Poland, in the spring of 1806. He received formal training in art at both the Berlin Academy and the D√ºsseldorf Academy. M√ºcke worked under the well established painter Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow. Travel was an important element of life to M√ºcke, Italy being his first extended foreign sojourn over the winter of 1834-35. Later, in the year 1950 he visited England, while he vacationed in Switzerland many times. From earliest predilections, he chose historical religious subjects, especially those containing dramatic or exalted themes. Liturgical paintings Biblical topics were the first for which M√ºcke was well known. In the core of his early painting career he completed such works as: Saint Catherine carried by Angels to Mount Sinai (1836); Saint Ambrose and Emperor Theodosius (1838); Saint Elizabeth taking Farewell of her Husband (1841); Saint Elizabeth Giving Alms (1841), the last of which pieces is hung in the National Gallery Berlin, Alte Nationalgalerie. Further liturgical oils of the late 1840s,early 1850s and undated works are: Coronation of the Virgin (1847); Saint Adelbert (1851); Cycle of Life of Saint Meinrad; Good Shepherd; and Christ Crucified. Paintings of noble life, genre scenes and portraiture Heinrich M√ºcke also attended to other subject matter, especially while in his early forties. He enjoyed portraying famous historic people in foreign lands, such as Dante in Verona (1846) and Cleopatra Dying (1873). The well known Male Portrait (1861) hangs in the D√ºsseldorf Museum. Finally to note his genre work, one can turn to his painting Mother and Child (ca. 1850); the latter work was destroyed by wildfire in 2017 from the collection of C. Michael Hogan. The frescoes Not content with liturgical art on canvas, M√ºcke relished the creation of expansive frescoes in some of the superb old buildings in Germany. The earliest well-known example is a series of many large images produced over a nine-year period at Castle Heltorf near D√ºsseldorf: Scenes from life of Barbarossa (1829‚Äì1938). In general M√ºcke's frescoes comprised early compositions, although these works were clearly interleaved in time with his liturgical oil paintings. Karl M√ºcke, Heinrich's son St. Catherine (1836) Karl M√ºcke was born in 1847 and surely studied under his father. Karl became a distinguished painter in his own right, although not as renowned as his father. He specialized in genre painting and is recognized for such works as Little Brother, Sunday Afternoon, Mother's Joy, Paternal Joys and Mending Nets on the Coast of Holland. Karl died on 27 May 1923.

There is evidence that Mochlos was not an island in Minoan times, but was attached to the mainland and acted as an eastern harbor. The name Mochlos also applies to the small fishing village and resort located on the main island of Crete, opposite Mochlos island. Only 150 metres separates them. The island is administered from Tourloti which is only away. Archaeology The Minoan settlement of Mochlos Mochlos was first excavated by Richard Seager in 1908 at the western end of the island, where a prepalatial cemetery was found. At that time, tombs, pithos burials and pit graves were uncovered, as well as two large tombs at the western tip of the island. In the 1970s, Jeffrey Soles documented the tombs and cemetery uncovered by Seager. The cemetery was in use from Early Minoan I to Middle Minoan IA.

Professors Jeffrey S. Soles from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and Costis Davaras from the University of Athens are co-directors. It has uncovered remains dating from 3100 BC to the 10th century AD, including a Minoan town of the Neopalatial period (c. 1700-1430 BC), a Mycenaean village and its cemetery (c. 1400-1250 BC), and a Late Hellenistic settlement of the 2nd and 1st centuries BC. Details are to be found on the project's website. In addition to the Minoan town on the island, two buildings were uncovered behind the modern village of Mochlos. Both are artisans' quarters belonging to the Minoan town. One was used for crafting bronze, ivory and stone. The other was for making pottery. The Mycenaean cemetery was excavated above the artisans' quarter on the hill above, and a Minoan farmhouse was uncovered at Chalinomouri at the far eastern end of the Mochlos plain. Some excavations continue, but the core work on the project is study and publication of data. =Metalwork= Minoan gold necklaces, 2500-1500 BC, from Mochlos and Platanos Ten Late Minoan I metal hoards were recently excavated at Mochlos. Among them are foundry hoards, traders' hoards and ceremonial assemblages. Lead isotope analyses indicate that copper oxhide ingots and fragments from these hoards originated in Cyprus.Bryn Mawr Classical Review, 2009Jeffrey Soles, Metal Hoards from LM IB Mochlos, Crete, 143-156. in Iris Tzachili (ed.), Aegean Metallurgy in the Bronze Age: Proceedings of an International Symposium Held at the University of Crete, Rethymnon, Greece, on November 19‚Äì21, 2004.

Born in the village of Yantic, now part of the town of Norwich, Connecticut, Backus was influenced by the Great Awakening and the works of Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield. He was converted in 1741. For five years, he was a member of a Separatist Congregationalist church. In 1746, he became a preacher. He was ordained in 1748.McLoughlin, William G., Soul Liberty: The Baptists' Struggle in New England, 1630-1833, Hanover: Brown University Press, 1991, p. 250-251. Backus became a Baptist in 1751 when he became pastor of the Middleborough Baptist Church in Middleborough, Massachusetts. In 1764, Isaac Backus joined John Brown, Nicholas Brown, William Ellery, Stephen Hopkins, James Manning, Ezra Stiles, Samuel Stillman, Morgan Edwards and several others as an original fellow or trustee for the chartering of the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (the original name for Brown University), the first Baptist school of higher learning. American Revolutionary Period Considered a leading orator of the \\"pulpit of the American Revolution.\\" Backus published a sermon in 1773 that articulated his desire for religious liberty and a separation of church and state called An Appeal to the Public for Religious Liberty, Against the Oppressions of the Present Day. In that book, Backus stated: \\"Now who can hear Christ declare, that his kingdom is, not of this world, and yet believe that this blending of church and state together can be pleasing to him?\\"Isaac Backus, An Appeal to the Public for Religious Liberty Against the Oppressions of the Present Day, 1773, http://classicliberal.tripod.com/misc/appeal.html In 1778, he authored a historically important work entitled Government and Liberty Described and Ecclesiastical Tyranny Exposed of which a copy is held by the John Carter Brown Library at Brown.Religion and the Founding of the American Republics, Library of Congress, July 23, 2010, https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel05.html  During the Ratification Debate  Backus served as a delegate from Middleborough to the Massachusetts ratifying convention, which ratified the United States Constitution in 1788. In a speech during the convention, Backus praised the constitution for its prohibition of religious tests for federal office holders: > Many appear to be much concerned about it [prohibition of religious tests], > but nothing is more evident, both in reason, and in the holy scriptures, > than that religion is ever a matter between God and individuals; and > therefore no man or men can impose any religious test, without invading the > essential prerogatives of our Lord Jesus Christ. Ministers first assumed > this power under the Christian name; and then Constantine approved of the > practice, when he adopted the profession of Christianity, as an engine of > state policy. And let the history of all nations be searched, from that day > to this, and it will appear that the imposing of religious tests hath been > the greatest engine of tyranny in the world. In the same speech Backus also praised the constitution for giving the federal government the power to tax and eventually (after twenty years) regulate or abolish the slave trade. He voted in favor of ratification. ReferencesFurther reading * Allison, William Henry. \\"Isaac Backus.\\" Dictionary of American Biography. Vol I., p. 471\\\\.

Via Margutta is a narrow street in the centre of Rome, near Piazza del Popolo, accessible from Via del Babuino in the ancient Campo Marzio neighborhood also known as \\"the foreigner's quarter\\". Mount Pincio is nearby. Via Margutta originally was home to modest craftsmen, workshops and stables, but now hosts many art galleries and fashionable restaurants. After the 1953 film Roman Holiday became popular, Via Margutta developed into an exclusive neighborhood, where such celebrities as film director Federico Fellini lived. From the north the area can be reached from Via Cassia or Flaminia, passing then through Piazzale Flaminio, and through the city door in the wall that leads to Piazza del Popolo. From this point one walks several metres to the left of Flaminio Obelisk towards Via del Babuino, and on the left there is an alley that leads to Via Margutta. From Piazza di Spagna, one can take via del Babuino, turn right on via Albert, and via Margutta will be on the left. Etymology and history The name probably originates from the word \\"Marisgutta\\", meaning \\"Sea Drop\\", a gentle euphemism for a dirty stream that came down from the hill of the villa of the Pincii, used like a natural Roman Cloaca. Via Margutta was behind the palaces of Via del Babuino (Baboon road), where warehouses and stables were found. At the base of Pincio hill, there were homes and shops of masons, marble cutters, and coachmen, who conducted their business in the areas. In the Middle Ages an unknown artist opened the first workshop where the finest Roman craftsmen painted portraits, cut marble for fountains and forged metal plates, giving birth to a flourishing industry that attracted foreign artists (including Flemish and German), as well as Italians from other regions. These immigrants gradually replaced the shacks and stables with houses, workshops and gardens. During the reign of Pope Pius IX, (1846-1878), a Belgian monsignor, Saverio de Merode, seeing the potential of the area, purchased land, built drains, and incorporated the narrow street into the public city plan. Via Margutta today is a charming, quiet lane. Although it is fully in the city centre, it still maintains its garden atmosphere, perfumed by trees and vineyards, which has made it a perfect choice for artists, painters, sculptors, and antiquarians, even though many of former artists' studios have been converted into flats and apartments. Yearly exposition of \\"100 Painters of Via Margutta\\" \\"One hundred painters of Via Margutta\\", is a traditional arts festival warmly celebrated by citizens. The expo is sponsored by the Mayor and the Province of Rome (Lazio), and for many years has been a burgeoning field for the discovery of new artists. The celebration makes Via Margutta a true public art gallery, presenting more than 1,000 works of art, including oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors in every expressive style. Some of the works on exhibit are of unknown or less-famous artists, chosen by a multi-national jury of art critics. Admission is free, the exposition is open to everybody, the viewing of the works is casual. Via Margutta under the snow 4 February 2012 Famous residents Among the historical inhabitants of the street were Giulietta Masina, Federico Fellini, Renato Guttuso, Marina Punturieri, and Amerigo Tot. Fountain of the Arts In the same area can be found the \\"Fontana delle Arti\\", which has a triangular base, crowned by a bucket of paint-brushes (symbolizing the presence of artists in the area dating from the 17th century). According to the project architect, Pietro Lombardi, who also designed other small \\"fontanelle\\" throughout Rome (usually inspired by the coats of arms of the ancient Roman quarter (rione), the marble fountain was carved in 1927. Two masks are on opposite sides, mounted over marble supports. The images are of the now familiar sad and happy faces, symbolizing the fluctuating moods typical of artists. The two carved faces pour their weak water streams into two small bathtubs.

With a simple implementation, an adaptive optimizer may simply make a trade- off between just-in-time compilation and interpreting instructions. At another level, adaptive optimization may take advantage of local data conditions to optimize away branches and to use inline expansion to decrease the cost of procedure calls. Consider a hypothetical banking application that handles transactions one after another. These transactions may be checks, deposits, and a large number of more obscure transactions. When the program executes, the actual data may consist of clearing tens of thousands of checks without processing a single deposit and without processing a single check with a fraudulent account number. An adaptive optimizer would compile assembly code to optimize for this common case. If the system then started processing tens of thousands of deposits instead, the adaptive optimizer would recompile the assembly code to optimize the new common case. This optimization may include inlining code. Examples of adaptive optimization include HotSpot and HP's Dynamo system.HP's Dynamo In some systems, notably the Java Virtual Machine, execution over a range of bytecode instructions can be provably reversed. This allows an adaptive optimizer to make risky assumptions about the code. In the above example, the optimizer may assume all transactions are checks and all account numbers are valid. When these assumptions prove incorrect, the adaptive optimizer can 'unwind' to a valid state and then interpret the byte code instructions correctly.

Museums and libraries  * Victoria Memorial was built in the heart of the City of Joy, Kolkata to commemorate the Empress of India and Queen of the United Kingdom, Queen Victoria after her death in 1901. The Victoria Memorial was modelled on the Taj Mahal and was commissioned in 1906 by Lord Curzon's brainchild. Opened to the public in 1921, it was designed by the architects William Emerson and his protege Vincent Esch at the extraordinary cost of Rupees 10.5 million ($262,500), all of which was collected as voluntary donations, mostly from the British and Indian nobility. The memorial holds numerous paintings of the British royal family, miniature paintings of the Mughal School, oil paintings of the Company School (notably the uncle - nephew pair of Thomas Daniell and William Daniell), historical artefacts like the throne of the Nawab of Bengal, many lithographs and documents of historical interest, and various post-Raj artefacts significant in the history of Kolkata (added to the collection after independence). The memorial is set in extensive and beautiful lawns, and is lit up at night. A laser audio-visual show is held on the lawns every evening. 'Nike', the Greek Goddess of victory, on the top of the museum is said to be haunted, and has been prominently featured in many Kolkata stories and novels. It is regarded with pride and joy in Kolkata and colloquially referred to as the \\"Victoria\\".Victoria Memorial. iloveindia.com * The Indian Museum is the largest museum in Asia and the oldest in the Asia - Pacific region (est. 1814 at the location of the Asiatic Society). The Museum shifted to its present sprawling residence in 1875. Situated on Chowringhee Road (now J.L. Nehru Road), it houses perhaps the greatest collection of Indian natural history and an Indian Art collection to rival the Smithsonian Institution and the British Museum. Of specific note are the meteorite hall and dinosaur hall in the Natural History and Geology section, the numismatics section and the collections of Gandhara Art, Burmese woodwork, Mughal miniatures and Tibetan banner sections in the Indian Art section. The Anthropological Survey of India headquarters and the Government College of Art and Craft are housed in the same building. The Geological Survey of India headquarters moved from the museum to Bidhan Nagar recently. The Indian Museum has a library of excellent historical value, with a special focus on the Raj and Kolkata. * The Marble Palace is a privately owned collection of eclectic sculptures, paintings and a small menagerie and aviary off Chittaranjan Avenue in North Kolkata. Built by Raja Rajendra Mullick in 1835, it houses, among other treasures two little- publicized Reubens and a Joshua Reynolds, not to mention over 50 varieties of marble which grace the interiors of this mansion. * Birla Industrial & Technological Museum on Gurusaday Dutta Road, was inaugurated in 1959 as the first popular science museum in Asia. Modelled on the Deutsches Museum, it has interactive popular science exhibits and a significant collection of historical industrial holdings in India. Its collection of old gramophones, sound recorders, telephones, steam engines, road rollers, and other industrial machinery of the period 1880‚Äì1950 is very significant. The museum sports a vintage model of the Rolls-Royce Phantom I make. It also actively organizes summer camps, awareness programs and astronomy observations for school children. * Science City is a complex on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass featuring a lot of interactive science and live bioscience exhibits, as well as having Kolkata's first OMNIMAX theatre. * The Jorasanko Thakur Bari is the ancestral home of the Tagore family and was converted into a museum in 1961. The huge sprawling brick mansions were the cultural hub of Kolkata for close to a century and were a major force in the women's liberation movement. It hosted the first Brahmo wedding and was an important center of the Independence movement. The museum has three large galleries - one of the life and works of Rabindranath, a second gallery about his close relatives such as father Debendranath Tagore, Abanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore etc. and a third gallery on the Bengal Renaissance in general. * Gurusaday Museum, on Diamond Harbour Road, is the outcome of a lifetime collection of traditional Bengal folk arts in undivided Bengal by Sir Gurusaday Dutt. On his death in 1941, the collection was handed over to the Bratachari Society founded by Sir Gurusaday Dutt to preserve and protect Bengal folk arts. It was opened as a museum to the public with the help of the Government of India in 1963. It contains, among other fine handicrafts, terracotta panels, kantha or folk quilt work, and patas (or hand painted scrolls of the late 1900s), notably of the Kalighat School. The Asutosh Museum of Indian Art, on College Street, is the other museum specializing in Bengal folk arts, but with significant archaeological holdings from sites in West Bengal and Bihar like Chandraketugarh and Tamluk. The first university owned museum in India, it is run by the University of Calcutta and is named after its famous vice chancellor Sir Asutosh Mukherjee. * Nehru Children's Museum is named after Jawaharlal Nehru, whose love for children was well known. In order to pay homage to Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru, National Cultural Association established the Museum in 1972 on Panditji's name on his birthday. The museum has a collection of dolls and toys from across the globe, and has a doll - based retelling of the Indian epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. Established in 1972 close to the Victoria Memorial, and commonly referred to as \\"Nehru Children's Museum\\"; this museum is aging awkwardly fast. There are dolls which are not only bounded to India, but also of different states, countries, religious like the dolls of Bangladesh, Japan, China, Rhodesia, Korea, Indonesia. Other than these there are dolls which are dressed according to the places like Delhi, Assam, West Bengal, Chennai, Maharashtra, Andaman, Mexico, Portuguese and many more. There is even a separate cabin displaying various forms and styles of Ganesh. * Sabarna Sangrahashala located at Baro Bari, Barisha, is the only family museum of Kolkata which is open to public. It was established in 2005 by the Sabarna Roy Choudhury Paribar Parishad and is a tourist destination specially for those who want to know more about the history of Kolkata. It is also a research institute in the making. The museum possesses some of the rarest Kabulatipatras, documents and articles of historical importance besides several artifacts dating back to the 17th century. The museum is dedicated to students for creating an awareness of history, heritage, and culture of the land. Every year in the month of February, the museum organizes the International History and Heritage Exhibition which is only of its kind in Eastern India. * National Library of India located in Alipore is India's leading public library. It was inaugurated in 1836 by the Governor General Lord Metcalfe by transferring 4675 books from the College of Fort William. Public donations were the main source of books for the library, and by donations of Rupees 300 from proprietors. Dwarakanath Tagore was the first proprietor of the library. The library was initially only partially public, as poor students could use the library for a limited period of time. The Imperial Library was founded in 1891 by merging several libraries like those of the East India College and East India Board. Governor General Lord Curzon initiated the merger of these two libraries into a single Imperial Library in 1903 at the Metcalfe Hall. The goals of the library were to collect every book written about India at any time. The Assistant Librarian of the British Museum John Macfarlane was the first librarian and was succeeded by the first Indian librarian Harinath De. The library was moved to its present quarters in Belvedere Estate, Alipore and renamed the National Library. It is a fully public library which co-ordinates the activities of all other Indian public libraries. True to its goal, any book published in India today has to send one copy to the National library in the spirit of the Library of Congress, United States. * Kolkata also has some other small museums like the National Maritime Museum and the Police Museum. * Birla Planetarium in Kolkata runs many shows on educational and entertainment purposes about astronomy, astrophysics, space science, history of astronomy and mythology regarding stars and planets. It is situated on Jawaharlal Nehru road near several notable places like Indian Museum, Victoria Memorial, Maidan, and St. Paul's Cathedral. It was inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru on 2 July 1963. Projection on spherical ceiling accompanied by live audio (Bengali, English, and Hindi) is the major attraction of the Birla Planetarium. It also has an electronics laboratory, astronomy gallery, and an astronomical observatory equipped with a Celestron C-14 Telescope. * The other popular Kolkata libraries include the General Library of Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture located at Gol Park, maintained by the Ramakrishna Mission, Kolkata. The collection of this library was initially confined to a few books and journals, stacked in one or two book-cases. Dr. Barid Baran Mukherjee gifted over 33,000 volumes to the library in 1941. * The other historically significant libraries are Calcutta Club library, Asiatic Society, Indian Museum, Presidency College, Scottish Church College and St. Xavier's College, Calcutta.  Heritage administrative offices  * Calcutta High Court - It is the oldest High Court in India. It was established as the High Court of Judicature at Fort William on 1 July 1862 under the High Courts Act, 1861. It has jurisdiction over the state of West Bengal and the Union Territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The High Court building is an exact replica of the Stand Haus in Ypres, Belgium. It is recorded that when the original Stand Haus burnt down, a blueprint of Granville's Calcutta High Court had to be consulted before rebuilding it. The court has a sanctioned judge strength of 63. Despite, the name of the city was officially changed from Calcutta to Kolkata in 2001, the old name is retained by the court as it is an institution. * Bankshall Court - It is the present City Sessions Court of Kolkata. Two of its buildings are old heritage. * Raj Bhavan (Government House) - It was built in the early 19th century, is modeled on Kedleston Hall. The house was once the seat of the viceroys of India; later, when the government moved to New Delhi, it became the residence of the Governor of Bengal, a function that it fulfills to this day. While the basic features of Kedleston have been faithfully copied (the Palladian Front, the Dome etc.), Government House is a much larger, three-storeyed structure. Also, the Government of India evidently did not have the funding constraints that forced the Curzons to leave their house incomplete: Government House has all four wings originally conceived for Kedleston. So today, a 'complete', brick built Kedleston, on a much grander scale, is located in its acres of gardens at the heart of the Kolkata business district. * Town Hall - In Roman-Doric style, this building was built by the architect Col. John Garstin in 1813 with a fund of Rupees seven lakhs raised from lottery to provide the Europeans with a place for social gatherings. At first, the hall was placed under a committee, which allowed the public to use the hall under such terms and conditions as were fixed by the Government. The public could visit the ground floor hall to see statues and large size portrait paintings but they were not allowed indiscriminate access to the upper storey. Applications for the use of the upper storey were to be made to the committee. In 1867 Town Hall came under the custody of the Calcutta Municipality (later on Kolkata Municipal Corporation). In the year of 1897 the Town Hall had been partly renovated. After political independence in 1947, indiscriminate interference with the structure inevitably took its toll. That, at last, has been prevented in 1998 by timely intervention. The town hall was featured on the 6th leg of The Amazing Race 18, when the teams had to compete in a tea-drinking roadblock. * Writers' Building - It is the secretariat building of the State Government of West Bengal in India. The Writers' Building originally served as the office for writers of the British East India Company, hence the name. Designed by Thomas Lyon in 1777 the Writers' building has gone through several extensions over the years. In 1821 A 128 ft-long verandah with ionic style columns, each 32 ft high, were added on the first and second floors. From 1889 to 1906 two new blocks were added. It acquired its Greco-Roman look, complete with the portico in the central bay and the red surface of the exposed brick. The parapet was put in place and the statues sculpted by William Fredric Woodington in 1883, that line the terrace, were installed. The giant pediment at the centre is crowned with the statue of Minerva. The terrace also contains several other statues and notable among them are four clusters of statues, christened 'Justice', 'Commerce', 'Science' and 'Agriculture', with the Greek Gods and Goddesses of these four streams (Zeus, Hermes, Athena and Demeter respectively) flanked by a European and an Indian practitioner of these vocations, adorn the building. The 150 meter long Writers' Building covers the entire northern stretch of the a water body locally called Lal Dighi in B.B.D. Bagh area. Various departments of the West Bengal government are housed in this building. It is an edifice of great political significance and memories of the Indian Independence Movement. Writer's building was used as Chief Minister's Office and secretariat. However, from October 2013 certain departments and the office of Chief Minister moved to Nabanna, in Howrah to facilitate restoration of Writers Building.Teething troubles at Nabanna ease out. Indian Express (9 October 2013).\\"Chaos greets employees at Nabanna\\". The Times of India. (8 October 2013).Facelift for Writers' Building: Didi shifts to Nabanna. Business Standard (8 October 2013). * General Post Office - It is the central post office of the city of Kolkata, India and the chief post office of West Bengal. The post-office handles most of the city's inbound and outbound mail and parcels. Situated in the B.B.D. Bagh area, the imposing structure of the GPO is one of the landmarks in the city. * Esplanade Mansions * South Eastern Railway Headquarters, Garden Reach * Howrah station - It is one of the five intercity train stations serving Howrah and Kolkata, India; the others are Sealdah Station and Kolkata railway station in Kolkata and Shalimar Station and Santragachi Station in Howrah. Howrah is situated on the West bank of the Hooghly River, linked to Kolkata by the magnificent Howrah Bridge which is an icon of Kolkata. It is the oldest station and the largest railway complex in India.  Historic hotels  Great Eastern Hotel (officially Lalit Great Eastern Hotel) in February 2014, a large part of the hotel is still under renovation Grand Hotel, now The Great Eastern Hotel (officially Lalit Great Eastern Hotel) was founded as the Auckland Hotel in 1841, at the crossroads of the Old Courthouse Street and British India Street, founded by confectioner David Wilson and named after the then Governor General Lord Auckland. It grew from strength to strength over the 19th and first half of the 20th century. Locally known as \\"Wilson's Hotel\\", it was also known as \\"Auckland Hotel and the \\"Hall of Nations\\" in the 19th century, and was referred to as the \\"Japani Hotel\\" (Japanese Hotel) colloquially in the 20th century, due to a large number of Japanese tourists there. The hotel was extremely elite, referred to as the \\"Jewel of the East\\" and \\"the best hotel East of the Suez\\" by Mark Twain on his voyage along the Equator, and described by Rudyard Kipling in \\"The City of Dreadful Night\\". It had notable board members like the author Peary Chand Mitra and stockholders like W. C. Bonnerjee - president of the Indian National Congress. The hotel was famous for its new year parties thrown by Maharajahs (like the Maharajah of Cooch Behar) until the 1950s. It has been host to such notables as Elizabeth II on her India visit, Nikita Khrushchev's delegation in the 1950s, and visiting international cricket teams. The hotel kitchens, manned by the legendary Baruahs of Chittagong (now in Bangladesh), was the talk of Kolkata. It steadily progressed downhill since the 1970s, and was taken over by the Government of West Bengal in 1975 on grounds of insolvency. Labour union problems caused the hotel to worsen until a sensationalist news campaign by The Telegraph exposed the sorry state of the hotel in the 1990s. The hotel was privatized in November 2005 with the help of PricewaterhouseCoopers and has been re-christened The Lalit Great Eastern Kolkata. After an extensive restoration, a part of the property was reopened in November 2013. The Lalit Great Eastern offers 244 rooms and suites along with four restaurants and bars, the largest conference and banqueting facility in Kolkata, besides all other five-star deluxe facilities and services. The Grand Hotel had humble beginnings. In the 1870s Mrs. Annie Monk opened her boarding house at numbers 13, 14 and 15 Chowringhee. In the meantime, Arathoon Stephen, Armenian from Isfahan had arrived in Calcutta and proceeded to make his fortune in the jewellery business. By the early 20th century he had put together a sizeable fortune and had purchased numbers 16 and 17 Chowringhee. Soon he purchased Mrs. Monk's boarding house and number 18 Chowringhee as well, and proceeded to develop all the properties together into the hotel that came to be known as the Grand Hotel. The Grand Hotel had humble beginnings as Mrs. Monte's Boarding House at 13, Chowringhee Street. Acquired by the real-estate baron Arrathoon Stephen, it turned into a 3-story 500-room hotel. Acquired by hotelier Mohan Singh Oberoi in 1938, it became the Oberoi Grand. The hotel got a major lift during World War II when about 4000 soldiers were billeted there and would party regularly. Events like the U.S. Marines' Ball at the hotel remind visitors of such times.  City parks  Maidan, overlooking the Chowringhee Skyline One of the few lakes inside the Alipore Zoological Gardens Maidan means \\"field\\" in Hindi, Marathi, Urdu and Bengali. The Kolkata Maidan was once a vast uninterrupted field, right down to the edge of the Hoogli River, but is being encroached upon by the city and is fragmented by roads. The Maidan has nurtured sports like Polo and has been the home of equestrianism, horse racing, football, cricket and rugby in Kolkata. It houses numerous clubs including the \\"big three\\" of Indian football - Mohun Bagan Athletic Club, East Bengal Football Club and Mohammedan Sporting Club along with their respective home stadiums. The arterial Chowringhee Avenue, the Eden Gardens, the Millennium Park and the associated 3 km long Riverfront beautification project border the Maidan. The Maidan abounds with monuments and statues, the most famous of them being Shaheed Minar and the statue of ace footballer Gostho Pal. Elliot Park, Mohor Kunja and Victoria Memorial complex are three parks which are situated in the Maidan area. Rabindra Sarobar or \\"The Lake\\" is an artificial lake and urban park in the spirit of Central Park, New York City. The park has a lake and an island with a footbridge, an open- air amphitheatre (Nazrul Mancha), a sports stadium (Rabindra Sarobar Stadium), a children's park and the rowing clubs of Calcutta Rowing Club, Bengal Rowing Club and Lake Club. A view of Rabindra Sarobar in South Kolkata Lush green grass along the lake at New Town Eco Park The Central Park is a large urban park in the centre of the Salt Lake township in Kolkata Metropolitan Area, with a lake in the middle and information technology and government offices along its fringes. Eco Park (officially Prakriti Tirtha), located in New Town in Kolkata Metropolitan Area, is situated on a plot and is surrounded by a waterbody with an island called Ekanto in the middle. The park has been divided into three broad parts; (1) ecological zones like wetlands, grasslands, and urban forest, (2) theme gardens and open spaces, and (3) urban recreational spaces. The Eco Park is further divided into different sub-parts according to the different types of fauna planted. Recently in the month of November 2017, it also opened up another section which displays the replica of \\"The seven wonders of the World\\". Toy trains and chair cars are available for the tourists on rent for making round around the park. There are four Gates for entry and exit purpose. The Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden (previously known as Indian Botanical Garden) spread over , was founded in 1786 and is the oldest botanical gardens in India. It is located at the bank of Hoogly River, Shibpur, Howrah near Kolkata. Housing 50,000 species, the Botanical Survey of India and one of the world's most historically relevant herbariums, it is famous for its 250-year-old, 98-foot-tall The Great Banyan tree - which has the largest girth of any banyan tree ever recorded (1300 ft). Alipore Zoological Gardens was founded in 1875, inaugurated by The Prince of Wales (later Edward VII). Initially started from the personal menagerie of the then Governor General of Bengal Arthur Wellesley and Carl Louis Schwendler - a German electrician, it grew based on gifts from British and Indian nobility - like Raja Suryakanta Acharya of Mymensingh in whose honour the open air tiger enclosure is named the \\"Mymensingh Enclosure\\". The zoo was ill-reputed because of cross breeding experiments between lions and tigers to produce strains like tigons, ligers, and litigons. Adwaita was a male Aldabra giant tortoise in the zoo which died in March, 2006. He was reported to have been more than 250 years old - a candidate for the longest- lived animal. The other success story of the zoo was a live birth of the rare Sumatran rhinoceros in 1889. The zoo is downsizing to meet animal comfort requirements laid down by the Central Zoo Authority of India. The zoo is also on the flyway for several migratory birds like the sarus crane. A host of new amusement parks have sprung up in recent times - the most notable being are Nicco Park in Salt Lake - the first modern amusement park in Kolkata Metropolitan Area and Aquatica in New Town - the theme water park. Other important parks include Nalban in Salt Lake and Captain Bhery Eco & Aquatic Hub in Chingrighata.  Statues and memorials  The Shaheed Minar or Ochterlony Monument, Kolkata A view of Prinsep Ghat in the evening Gwalior Monument The Shaheed Minar or \\"Tower of the Martyrs\\", (formerly Ochterlony Monument) was constructed on the northern fringe of the Maidan in honour of Sir David Ochterlony who commanded the British East India Company forces in the Gurkha War (1814‚Äì1816). It was renamed Shaheed Minar in honor of the fallen freedom fighters after Indian independence. Situated at Prinsep Ghat, is a Palladian porch in the memory of the eminent Anglo-Indian scholar and antiquary James Prinsep was designed by W. Fitzgerald and constructed in 1843 .Located between the Water Gate and the St George's Gate of the Fort William, the monument to Prinsep is rich in Greek and Gothic inlays. It was restored by the state's public works department in November 2001 and has since been well- maintained. In its initial years, all royal British entourages used the Prinsep Ghat jetty for embarkation and disembarkation. Other memorials in Kolkata include the Panioty fountain, Police Memorial and the William Jones obelisk at the South Park Street Cemetery. Lascar War Memorial located on the Napier Road in the Hastings area, is a memorial dedicated to the memory of 896 Lascars (sailor or militiaman from Indian subcontinent), who died fighting for the British Navy during the World War I. Gwalior Monument, also known as Ellenborough‚Äôs Folly is an octagonal cenotaph about 60 feet high, crowned with a bronze dome cast from guns captured from the Marathas. It was erected in 1847 by Lord Ellenborough, the Governor-General of India, as a memorial to the officers and men who fell during the Gwalior War in 1843. Kolkata has many statues celebrating British heritage and the Indian Renaissance and freedom movement. The Maidan is a particularly good place for statue-hunting. A few of the more notable landmarks are as follows: * The statue of Subhas Chandra Bose, by Marathi sculptor Nagesh Yoglekar is located at the Shyambazar five- point crossing. * The statue of Sir James Outram by Irish sculptor John Henry Foley built in 1874 is located in front of the Victoria Memorial, originally at the Park Street and Chowringhee Avenue crossing. * The statue of Iswarchandra Vidyasagar by Bengali sculptor Pramod Gopal Chattopadhyay built in 1899 is located on the premises of Sanskrit College. * The statue of Rabindranath Tagore by Soviet Belarusian sculptor of Jewish origin Zair Azgur built in 1963 is located at the premises of Jorasanko Thakur Bari, the Tagore family residence. * The statue of David Hare was built in 1847.

The gardens house a transported Burmese pagoda of exquisite design. The pavilion was built in 1871 and the 1st first class match played in the season of 1911-12. It has since hosted many international Test matches, one day matches and tournaments, including the final of the Cricket World Cup in 1987. Its exalted status in cricketing history comes from the lush outfield, stellar performances (like V.V.S. Laxman's 281), and not least the intense crowd support. The stadium has a history of crowd violence - involving riots in the stands in 1967 (when the stadium burnt), 1996 and 1999. * Yuva Bharati Krirangan, also called the Salt Lake Stadium, is a 122,000 - strong amphitheatre used for soccer matches and concerts.

Founded in 1792 as the Calcutta Cricket Club, it merged later with the Calcutta Football Club (founded 1872) to become the Calcutta Cricket and Football Club, and is located on Gurusaday Dutta Road. It has arguably the most picturesque cricket ground in Kolkata. Recent evidence in the form of an article in Hickey's Bengal Gazette, suggests the club existed in 1780 - which would make it the oldest cricket club in the world. * The Royal Calcutta Turf Club is the oldest turf club in India, and one of the most beautiful and largest in the world. Encompassing a significant area of the Maidan, it was founded in 1847, and is distinguished for its \\"Monsoon Track\\" - one of the fastest draining tracks in the world.

Markets and malls  South City Mall Interior South City Mall, biggest mall of Kolkata New Market), Kolkata New Market is Kolkata's historic shopping district. Opened in 1874, it was named Hogg Market after the commissioner Sir Stuart Hogg. The beautiful fountain and benches at the market no longer exist, but the popularity of the market has not waned, and the beautiful gothic clock tower recalls the British heritage of the market. It was renamed New Market after Independence. New Market led the way for Christmas and New Year festivities with confectionery shops like Nahoum's putting up a special spread. The market is organized on the basis of merchandise. It burnt down partially in 1985 but has been restored and expanded with a new building which houses very famous Kashmir Handicraft store-Pumposh. The Park Street, Camac Street and Shakespeare Sarani are considered to be a high street of Kolkata with many commercial establishments, lots of shopping complexes, boutiques, restaurants and stand alone retail outlets. Gariahat and Shyambazar are two shopping districts catering mostly to the middle class and lower middle class of Kolkata. College Street is an area famous for its bookstores. Kolkata has seen a spurt of shopping malls with the rise of the buying power of the Kolkata populace. Shopping arcades like Forum Mall and Emami Shoppers' City in Central Calcutta have brought international brands from Swarovski to Godiva to the city, breaking the city's dependence on the older market complexes like A.C. Market, Dakshinapan shopping center and Vardaan Market, which were mainly Chinese import dependent. Most of the new malls in Kolkata are located in the newer developed areas like Salt Lake, New Town and along the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. Some of the popular malls in Kolkata are City Centre (Salt Lake), City Centre 2, Axis Mall and Home Town (New Town), South City Mall (the biggest mall in Eastern India) (Jadavpur), Acropolis Mall (Rajdanga in Kasba/ East Kolkata Township), Metropolis Mall (Hiland Park), Mani Square Mall (Kankurgachi). Swabhumi has been modeled as an ethnic shopping arcade near the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass in Phoolbagan.

It allows haulage companies to search a database of available freight that needs to be delivered and advertise their available vehicle capacity. Logistics providers and freight forwarders can advertise their freight loads that needs delivering as well as match their freight loads to the available vehicle capacity. These systems provide a platform that allows carriers to communicate freight traffic information to fellow operators such as transporters, forwarders and logistics companies. They allow forwarders to advertise their freight either privately or publicly to a large number of freight operators that are looking for loads. They also allow freight operators to offer vehicle space. Online systems are normally subscription-based with a small charge for advertising (posting) and searching (consulting). The main purpose of a freight exchange is to fill empty vehicles on their return journeys (when they are on their way back to their depot after a delivery) by matching them to available freight. For example, a trucker has an order to transport tulips from Keukenhof in the Netherlands to Como, Italy. Ideally, a freight order for the return trip would increase profitability, so the trucker would search for return freight or return load on a freight exchange. By finding return loads it results in improving efficiency for haulage and transport companies as well as helping cut down on empty journeys which reduces CO2 emissions.http://www.fleetpoint.org/expertblog/top-5-benefits-of-using-a- freight-exchange/ The world's first electronic freight exchange was called Teleroute and was launched in France on the Minitel system in 1985. Before the Internet, users were supplied with a terminal to advertise or search for freight. Today, there are many examples around the world offering many services to haulers and freight forwarders. The classic freight exchange was a favorite tool in the centralized economies. For example, there was a ban against driving with an empty truck in the socialistic Czechoslovakia. Transport companies had to use the national system showing information about available loads. With the help of new technology freight exchanges are now able to improve efficiency even more by integrating with telematics and transport management systems to offer realtime freight load matching utilizing GPS technology.http://www.transportengineer.org.uk/transport-engineer- news/online-freight-exchange-now-features-free-vehicle-tracking/110893/ References Category:Freight transport Category:Sustainable transport ","title":"Freight exchange"},{"id":"3959525","text":"Naser Khader ( Levantine pronunciation: ; born 1 July 1963) is a Syrian- Danish politician who is member of the Parliament of Denmark for the Conservative People's Party. He was first elected to Parliament representing the Danish Social Liberal Party in 2001. In 2007 he left this party to found New Alliance (later Liberal Alliance), whom he represented from 2007 until 5 January 2009. A leading proponent of peaceful co-existence of democracy and Islam, he established a new movement, Moderate Muslims (later renamed Democratic Muslims), when the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy began. In the national elections on 13 November 2007, Naser Khader's New Alliance party won five parliamentary seats. After a tumultuous year, in which two MPs left the party, one was excluded from the parliamentary group, and the party was renamed to Liberal Alliance, Naser Khader too left the party. Following a short period as an Independent Member of the Danish Parliament, Naser Khader joined the Conservative People's Party on 17 March 2009. Khader lost his seat in the 2011 Danish parliamentary election, but regained it in the 2015 election.. Retrieved August 26, 2015. Khader co-founded an association of Islamism critics in 2008, with the aim to promote freedom of speech and inspire moderate Muslims worldwide. Khader and the Conservative Party advocate a complete ban on the burqa as part of an integration initiative by the Conservatives' parliamentary group, describing it as \\"un- Danish\\" and \\"oppression against women\\".Danish Conservatives Call for Burqa Ban Life Naser Khader is the son of a Palestinian father and a Syrian mother. He was raised in a small rural town outside Damascus in the traditional Syrian way. As a Palestinian refugee, his father had difficulties getting a good job in Syria, and although they lived in the village of his wife, she was often referred to as \\"The one who married a stranger\\". Naser Khader was named after Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Khader's father emigrated to Europe in the 1960s‚Äîa period when European countries had begun the call for foreign workers. Naser himself did not join his father until 1974, when he moved from his village in Syria to a flat in central Copenhagen, Denmark. He graduated from the Rysensteen Gymnasium in 1983. =Freedom of Expression and Jyllands- Posten= In 2006, he was awarded Jyllands-Posten's Freedom of Expression award. As the newspaper had published cartoons of the Islamic prophet Muhammad the award affected the perception of Khader among \\"practicing Muslims\\" according to Tim Jensen,. When it was reported that Ahmed Akkari, spokesman for the group of Danish Imams that toured the Middle East seeking support during the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, said \\"...If Khader becomes Minister of Integration, it would be likely that someone dispatched two guys to blow him and the Ministry up?...\\".Vid. (Fr.) Naser Khader stated that he had to consider whether or not to continue in politics. When Akkari was later confronted with his statement, he said that he was joking. Later, on 1 April 2006, Khader indicated that he would return to politics. =Network of journalists and political consultants= Naser Khader is well connected among political commentators and journalists. He is on friendly terms with two of the former press secretaries of the Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, as well as the current press secretary, Michael Ulveman.Khaders magtfulde netv√¶rk  Journalisten In a documentary about the Mohammed-cartoons crisis, Naser Khader is shown jogging with political commentator Henrik Qvortrup, exclaiming: \\"I don't want to give that idiot any more screentime\\" (referring to Ahmed Akkari). During the 2007 parliamentary election campaign, Qvortrup published a story in his tabloid magazine Se og H√∏r, accusing Khader of tax fraud on the basis of one paid anonymous source, and without any substantiated evidence to support the claim. Several anonymous workers were reported to having admitted to moonlighting at Khader's private home. In reaction, Khader called Qvortrup a \\"swine\\", a common Danish insult similar to the word \\"jerk\\", and declined to comment on the story; shortly after, he expressed regret for the use of that word.TV-Avisen, October 31, 2007 Khader claimed he had documents proving that everything was legitimate and threatened to sue the magazine for libel, which he later did.

Painting in Britain 1530‚Äì1790 (Penguin Books, 1957). was a leading English portrait painter who enjoyed a high reputation during the last decade of King George I's reign and remained in high fashion in the first decade of King George II's reign. George Vertue's opinion was that only intemperance and extravagance prevented Vanderbank from being the greatest portraitist of his generation, his lifestyle bringing him into repeated financial difficulties and leading to an early death at the age of only 45.

Gainsborough's vision (Liverpool University Press, 1999) p71. John Vanderbank senior was the leading tapestry weaver in England throughout his life and by the introduction of the lighter and less formal style, now referred to as chinoiserie, he exercised a powerful influence on the style of the Soho weavers.Survey of London: Volumes 33 and 34, St Anne Soho. Originally published by London County Council, London, 1966, Appendix 1: The Soho Tapestry Makers, pages 515-520 John Vanderbank first studied composition and painting under his father and then the painter Jonathan Richardson, before becoming one of Sir Godfrey Kneller's earliest pupils in 1711 at his art academy in Great Queen Street, neighbouring his father's tapestry workshop. After Sir James Thornhill took over from Kneller in 1718, Vanderbank continued his studies there for two years before founding an academy of his own in 1720. Vanderbank's younger brother, Moses Vanderbank, was also an artist and draughtsman, although besides a family group depicting three children (1733), three altarpieces in the 12th century church at Adel near Leeds,John Mayhall, The Annals and History of Leeds and Other Places in the County York, Kirkstall,1860, p27. p138 and a portrait of a young child with a lamb (1743), his painted works are exceptionally rare.. He succeeded his father to the post of Yeoman Arras-maker to the Crown in 1727. The family's relationship to the leading late 17th century painter and engraver Peter Vanderbank is uncertain although the Parisian origins of both, the similarity of profession, the facial similarities of Kneller's chalk portrait of Peter Vanderbank and John Vanderbank's self-portrait drawing, and John Vanderbank senior's ownership of land in Hertfordshire where Peter Vanderbank married and spent his final years are suggestive.Survey of London: Volumes 33 and 34, St Anne Soho, London County Council, London, 1966, Appendix 1: The Soho Tapestry Makers, pages 515-520 Career=Portrait painter= Vanderbank worked chiefly as a portraitist, also painting some allegorical subjects, and as an illustrator. He began his portrait practice in 1719 with a large equestrian portrait of Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough, developing a free, painterly style, his faces admirably drawn with what Vertue describes as ‚Äògreatness of pencilling, spirit and composition‚ÄôWaterhouse, Ellis. Painting in Britain 1530‚Äì1790 (Penguin Books, 1957)., and partly derived from his admiration for Rubens and Van Dyck, many of whose works he had studiously copied. His early portraits continued the vigour and grand style of Kneller but with a more vital and energetic drawing than his contemporaries. He used a bold pigmentation in the flesh where pink tones are painted thinly over the cooler greys of the ground layer to suggest glowing skin, the technique of colori cangianti derived from Rubens who was himself inspired by the artists of the seicento. Equally distinctive is the way in which mid-tones are represented by unpainted areas of grey-green primer and the placing of pure red pigments for highlights.. =Vanderbank's academy= In 1720, after a period of infighting, Thornhill closed Kneller's Academy and opened a new academy of his own, conducting free life-drawing classes from a room he added to his own house in James Street, Covent GardenWilliam Sandby, The History of the Royal Academy of Arts from Its Foundation in 1768 (London: Longmans, Green) 1862:21.. In October of the same year a faction led by John Vanderbank, who on his father's death in 1717 had received a legacy of ¬£500The Will of Johannis Vanderbank, proved 1717, The National Archives; Kew, Surrey, England; Records of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, Series PROB 11; Class: PROB 11; Piece: 559, and the elderly Louis Ch√©ron established an academy which they advertised as 'The Academy for the Improvement of Painters and Sculptors by drawing from the Naked' at premises in St Martin's Lane. Vanderbank's Academy, as it became known, proved popular and its list of subscribers is a roll call of the next generation of leading artists. Conversely Thornhill had little success in finding subscribers, despite making no charge, and Hogarth, Thornhill's son- in-law, attributed its failure at least in part to the competition from Vanderbank's Academy. In 1724 it was discovered that the academy treasurer had embezzled the subscription fundsJames Ayres, Art, Artisans and Apprentices: Apprentice Painters & Sculptors in the Early Modern British Tradition, 2014. and this, coupled with Vanderbank's growing debt problems, and perhaps Ch√©ron's old age and illness (he died in May of the following year), led to the closure of the academy that summer. Vanderbank's Academy was shortlived but had an important influence on the development of English art, not least by furthering the introduction in England of life drawing classes for promising students such as William Hogarth, Joseph Highmore, William Kent, John Faber, John Ellys and James Seymour. Moreover in leading the academy Vanderbank was at the centre of an influential artistic hub enjoying the patronage of the wealthiest aristocrats, largely responsible for shaping the taste and cultural life of England in the 1720s and 1730s, encompassing art, architecture, music and the landscape. For example when William Kent joined Vanderbank's Academy he was already painting interiors at Cannons for the Duke of ChandosTim Mowl, William Kent: Architect, Designer, Opportunist, 2006, p101, the princely palace designed by James Gibbs whom Vanderbank had known since Kneller's Academy, and in 1722 Vanderbank painted a portrait of the Duke of Chandos which has in the background the great basin lake created at Cannons (of which Nicholas Hawksmoor said \\"I cannot but own that the water at Cannon's... is the main beauty of that situation and it cost him dear\\"., and in 1727 Hogarth, probably on Vanderbank's recommendation, was invited to paint a cartoon of The Element of the Earth for Joshua Morris, the tapestry maker of Great Queen Street, for some hangings for Cannons, so initiating Hogarth's painting career.Ronald Paulson, Hogarth, The modern Moral Subject, 1697-1732, 1991, p155. The Duke of Chandos had installed Handel as musician in residence at Cannons Paul Henry Lang, George Frideric Handel, 1966, p258., where he composed the Chandos Anthems and his first oratorios, and in 1719 was one of the principal founding subscribers to the Royal Academy of Music to ensure a steady supply of baroque opera under Handel's aegis. Vanderbank was a frequent concert goer, drawing a caricature of Senesino, Cuzzoni and Berenstadt in a scene from Handel's Flavio in 1723, which was anonymously etched and engraved, and in the same year painting the portrait of the leading soprano, and later contralto, Anastasia Robinson, Countess of Peterborough, of which Faber produced a popular mezzotint in 1727. Vanderbank's extravagant habits saw him repeatedly in financial difficulties between 1724 and 1729, when his debts were cleared by his brother Moses. From 1729 John Vanderbank occupied a house in Holles Street, Cavendish Square, rent-free thanks to the generous patronage of Lord Carteret who, however, appropriated the contents of his studio after his death. According to Vertue, there Vanderbank lived ‚Äògalantly or freely according to the custom of the Age‚Äô Vertue, Note books, 3.97 and so in the 1730s Vanderbank's career returned to the ascendant, Vertue noting that he had 'a great run of business painting persons of quality and distinction'. =Works= Vanderbank's portraits of royalty, leading aristocrats and eminent persons of his day are to be found in every major art gallery around the world including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, National Gallery of Art, Washington DC, Royal Academy of Arts, Tate Gallery, The Royal Collection, The Courtauld Gallery, the Dulwich Picture Gallery, and the National Portrait Gallery. A great many of Vanderbank's portraits were engraved in mezzotint by John Faber, George Vertue, George White and others, and were highly popular at the time. Vanderbank's most characterful and distinguished portraits are generally of the 1720s including the great patron of Handel and of the arts the Duke of Chandos (1722), the two portraits of Sir Isaac Newton (1725 and 1726), the painter George Lambert (untraced but engraved by Faber in 1727), the eccentric Newmarket trainer Tregonwell Frampton (c.1725), the poet James Thomson (1726), and the sculptor John Michael Rysbrack (c.1728). Ellis Waterhouse considered that Vanderbank's masterpiece was the large full-length of Queen Caroline (1736). Vanderbank painted three allegorical subjects incorporating an equestrian portrait of George I for the decoration of the staircase at 11 Bedford Row, London, and contributed The Apotheosis, or, Death of the King (1727) to the series of ten paintings by various artists, including Ch√©ron and Pieter Angelis, engraved in 1728 and advertised by John Bowles as Ten Prints of the Reign of King Charles the First. By contrast, some of Vanderbank's later portraits of ‚Äòpersons of Quality‚Äô, male or female, are technically well painted but can betray a lack of rapport with his sitters and a tendency to rely on stock poses sometimes directly derived from Van Dyck. Vertue noted that, like many portraitists of the period, Vanderbank sometimes used the services of the drapery painter Joseph van Aken from the mid 1730sManners and Morals, p.247. As a draughtsman and illustrator, Vanderbank demonstrates a verve and originality not always found in his portraiture. A series of pen, ink, and wash drawings of horses and riders being trained in the exercises of haute √©cole, drawn in the early 1720s when the artist ‚Äòwas himself a Disciple in our Riding-Schools‚ÄôAlejandra Aguado, Martin Myrone, Tate Britain: 100 Works from the Tate Collection, 2007, p7 was engraved and published by Joseph Sympson in 1729 as 'Twenty Five Actions of the Manage Horse'. The drawings were widely copied and pirated. In 1723 Vanderbank was commissioned by the publishers J and R Tonson to illustrate Don Quixote, in the original Spanish and this eventually appeared as a lavish four-volume quarto edition in 1738 with sixty-eight engraved plates after Vanderbank. This project, for which Vanderbank's initial designs were preferred over Hogarth's, appears to have preoccupied Vanderbank, perhaps almost empathetically, for the remainder of his life, resulting in three sets of drawings; first sketched then finished for the engraver's use, then drawn afresh, elaborated, and fully finished, as well as a series of some thirty-five small freely painted oil panels. Vanderbank also illustrated or designed frontispieces for various volumes of plays. Vanderbank's only known apprentice was John Robinson (1715-1745) whom he took on for five years for a premium of ¬£157 10s on 23 July 1737. Robinson attained some success as a portrait-painter in his short life. Having married a wife with a fortune, he purchased the late Charles Jervas's house in Cleveland Court, Bath, and thus inherited a fashionable practiceHenry B Wheatley FSA, Historical Portraits, London, 1897, p66. =Character= From Vertue we know that Vanderbank was immensely talented, 'so bold and free was his pencil and so masterly his drawing', and also that Vanderbank might have made a greater figure than almost any painter England had produced had he not been so careless and extravagant; 'only intemperance prevented Vanderbank from being the greatest portraitist of his generation'.George Vertue, Note books 5.98 Vertue notes that Vanderbank ‚Äòlivd very extravagantly a mistres drinking & country house a purpose for her‚Äô. This extravagance led him into debt and in 1724 Vanderbank fled to France briefly to avoid imprisonment by his creditorsGeorge Vertue, Note books 3.98, returning to enter 'the liberties of the Fleet', mansion houses near the Fleet prison in which privileged prisoners could enjoy relative comfort in return for payment. In 1727 Vanderbank's mother died, having prudently left her assets out of reach of John's creditors to her younger son Moses, and in 1729 Moses sold a share in the family tapestry business to the painter John Ellys to settle John Vanderbank's debts. Vanderbank then accepted a free residence in Lord Carteret's house in Holles Street, neighbouring the Duke of Chandos's house in Cavendish Square, London.Survey of London: Volumes 33 and 34, St Anne Soho, London County Council, London, 1966, Appendix 1: The Soho Tapestry Makers, pages 515-520 That Vanderbank succeeded in remaining in the first rank of portraitists in the 1720s and again in the 1730s in spite of his intemperance, sometimes producing outstanding works of art, testifies to the accuracy of Vertue's opinion. Horace Walpole, Anecdotes of Painting in England, 1849, vol 2, p676 Personal life On 12 July 1723 Vanderbank married the actress Ann Hardaker (b 1703) at St Mary's Church, IslingtonOriginal data: England, Marriages, 1538‚Äì1973.

She was deemed by Vertue to be ‚Äòa Vain empty wooman‚Äô though, judging by the portrait miniature by Christian Friedrich Zincke and Faber's mezzotint from her portrait by her husband, she was certainly strikingly attractive. Church of England Parish Registers, 1538-1812. London, England: London Metropolitan Archives, Reference Number: P83/MRY1/1167 The Hardakers had links to the West Riding of Yorkshire where Vanderbank's older sister Elizabeth had married John Hotham in 1715. This northern connection might have been the source of Moses Vanderbank's commission in Leeds. Vertue noted that Vanderbank ‚Äòleft no children behind him by this wooman‚Äô and indeed none has ever been traced from the marriage. Vanderbank died of consumption (tuberculosis) in Holles Street on 23 December 1739 aged 45 and was buried in St Marylebone Parish Church, Westminster.

It has been suggested that rock formations within the cave resemble female figures, most prominently a stalagmite in the centre that appears as a standing female. Geography The cave is located one kilometer south of the town of Amnisos. Mythology The cave is mentioned in Odysseus's Cretan narrative to Penelope in the Odyssey. Archaeology The Eileithyia Cave was occupied by prehistoric human settlers from the Neolithic period until around 400 BCE. The archaeological finds made in the cave are on display at the Iraklion Museum and the Archaeological Museum of Iraklion. Pottery ranging from the Neolithic to Roman periods has been discovered in the cave, with the most significant number of finds coming from the Minoan era. Four anthropomorphic vases from the Orientalizing period, which could be of Greek origin were found in the sanctuary. They are similar to Egyptian vases that show Isis nursing her infant son Horus.

Luna had been stabbed 36 times with his own pocketknife and then drowned in a creek next to his car in rural Lancaster County. Investigations have proven inconclusive, and there is debate on whether Luna's death was murder or suicide.  Personal life  Luna was born on October 21, 1965, and grew up in the Patterson housing project near Yankee Stadium in the South Bronx, New York City. His father was Filipino, and his mother an African-American from the American South. Luna received his undergraduate degree from Fordham University. He later studied at the University of North Carolina School of Law, where he was roommates with Reggie Shuford. He worked at Arnold & Porter in Washington, D.C. from 1993 to 1994 and the Federal Trade Commission from 1994 to 1997. Luna served as a prosecutor in the Brooklyn borough of New York City before moving to Baltimore, Maryland to become an Assistant United States Attorney. Luna married Angela Hopkins, an obstetrician, on August 29, 1993, and they had two children.  Death  At 11:38 pm on the night he died, Luna left the Baltimore courthouse and went northeast on I-95. He used his E-ZPass on I-95 into Delaware but not on the New Jersey and Pennsylvania Turnpikes. After three toll interchanges, he switched to buying toll tickets. At 12:57 am, $200 was withdrawn from Luna's bank account from the ATM at the JFK Plaza service center near Newark, Delaware. At 2:47 am he crossed the Delaware River toll bridge to the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and at 3:20 am his debit card bought gas at the Sunoco King of Prussia service plaza. At 4:04 am his car exited the turnpike at the Reading-Lancaster interchange. The toll ticket had a spot of his blood on it suggesting that he was already injured. His car was parked at the back of the Sensenig & Weaver Well Drilling company at 1439 Dry Tavern Road, Denver, Pennsylvania (Brecknock Township) before it was later driven into the creek. At 5:00 am the first employee of Sensenig & Weaver arrived, and half an hour later at 5:30 am the car was noticed, with its lights off and the front end into the stream. Blood was smeared over the driver's door and the front left of the car. Luna was face down in the stream under the car engine. He was wearing a suit and a black overcoat with his court ID around his neck. A pool of blood was found on the rear seat floor. Although stabbed 36 times with his own pocketknife around the chest and neck plus a head injury, the death was due to drowning. No suspects or motive for murder were determined. The federal authorities (FBI) lean toward calling it a suicide and came to the conclusion he was alone from the time he left his office until his body was found, but the local Lancaster County authorities, including two successive coroners, ruled it a homicide. Additional evidence collected during the investigation captured a second blood type and a partial print, as well as some grainy footage from near the time of the gas station purchase made with Luna's credit card at the Sunoco service plaza. The investigation remains ongoing, and there is an unclaimed federal reward of $100,000 for information leading to a conviction.  Theories = Suicide = It was initially reported that Luna did not have the expected substantial defense wounds on his hands and that many of the wounds are shallow which are called \\"hesitation\\" wounds in a suicide victim. Some suggested motives for suicide were that Luna was to take a polygraph test concerning $36,000 which disappeared from a bank robbery case that he had prosecuted. Luna had a charge card which his wife, Angela, did not know about. His name was on an Internet dating site and he had a $25,000 credit card debt. There is also an accidental suicide theory that Luna was fabricating a kidnapping and attack and that he went too far. = Homicide = The Lancaster County coroner who performed the autopsy ruled Luna's death a homicide by drowning. Luna left his glasses, which he needed to drive, and his cell phone on his desk. He had called defense attorneys earlier in the night saying he would fax over documents that night but they never arrived. The pool of blood in the back seat would suggest Luna was in back and someone else was driving.  Inquest  In early February 2007, a private investigator and an attorney, both hired by Luna's family, filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in order to force the Lancaster County coroner to conduct an inquest into Luna's death, after an earlier request was declined.

In 1917 he invented the first wide-field eyepieces for telescopes and binoculars. During his short life he developed a number of new designs for telescopes and eyepieces. Education Heinrich Erfle studied at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t and the Technical University of Munich (TUM), from which he graduated in 1907 with a thesis on \\"Optical properties and electron theory.\\" His dissertation advisers were Wilhelm Ebert and Sebastian Finsterwalder. Career After a two-year residency at the TUM he began to work at C.A. Steinheil & Sons. In 1909 he joined the telescope division of Carl Zeiss, in Jena, Germany. He began to run the division in 1918. During his years there, he focused mainly on improving submarine periscopes as well as the scopes on shotguns, prism binoculars, and guns on naval vessels. Erfle is particularly well known for his introduction of wide-angle eyepieces, which he began to produce during the First World War for military use. Erfle eyepieces are relatively cheap to produce, and are still produced for many binoculars as well as for telescopes used by amateur astronomers. The book Classic Telescopes describes Erfle as a ‚Äúfamous Zeiss employee...who in 1921 patented a practical design for a wide- angle ocular. Erfles usually consist of five elements comprising two achromatic doublets, with a convex singlet element sandwiched in between,‚Äù and ‚Äúare designed to have a wide field of view (about 60 degrees) but suffer from astigmatism and ghosting, especially in the shorter focal lengths.‚Äù Still, ‚ÄúErfles remain quite popular owing to their large eye lenses and good eye relief.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe basic Erfle,‚Äù according to an overview of ‚ÄúCommon Telescope Eyepiece Designs,‚Äù ‚Äúuses five elements in three groups and delivers a wide apparent field of view of about 60-degrees. Erfle variations are also made with six elements in three groups...Erfles have a nice, flat field from edge to edge, although sharpness and contrast is slightly inferior to the Orthoscopic and Plossl designs‚Äù by Ernst Abbe and Georg Simon Plossl respectively. ‚ÄúThey also feature long eye relief, especially important for eyeglass wearers. This combination of features makes these oculars excellent for wide sky viewing of open clusters, star fields, etc.‚Äù The design for Erfle's wide-angle eyepiece for Carl Zeiss was patented in the U.S. (patent number 1,478,704) on December 25, 1923. The patent application, for ‚Äúa new and useful Ocular,‚Äù describes ‚Äúoculars comprising two lenses, each of which consists of a collective and of a dispersive member, and which are so disposed that the two dispersive members lie outermost, hence, that of the double lens to be turned towards the incident light the dispersive member, and of the double lens to be turned towards the eye the collective member lies foremost.‚Äù Between these lenses lies ‚Äúa single collective lens.‚Äù This combination of lenses attains ‚Äúa diminution of the defects in the images, especially of the astigmatism and of the distortion, to the extent that the field of view may be raised to comparatively large angles, amounting to about 70 degrees. This was not feasible in oculars hitherto in use, if the image was to be of the same quality.‚Äù Erfle also held U.S. patent number 1,479,229 (patent date January 1, 1924) for ‚Äúa new and useful Eyelens System‚Äù which includes ‚Äúfour member eye- lens systems in which every two members, one made of glass of smaller and one of glass of greater refractive index, are cemented together,‚Äù and are ‚Äúso arranged that the cemented surfaces always turn their respective concave side towards the incident light, and that of each pair lenses that lens which consists of glass of smaller refractive index faces the incident light.‚Äù The result is a system ‚Äúin which the angles of incidence of the rays of light...become in no place excessively large, so that with systems corresponding to the invention...a correction of the astigmatism and of the distortion as well as of the spherical aberrations may in a sufficient measure be attained.‚Äù He held U.S. patent number 1,505,878 for ‚Äúa new and useful Telescope‚Äù with a prism system containing ‚Äútwo lateral boundary surfaces, parallel to each other and an optional number of reflecting surfaces, inclined to these boundary surfaces.‚Äù This makes it possible to look ‚Äúin two different directions in succession.‚Äù He also held U.S. patent number 1,507,111 (September 2, 1924) for ‚Äúa new and useful Lens System for Galilean Telescopes.‚Äù In previous lens systems for Galilean telescopes, ‚Äúthe elimination of the image defects was generally confined to the removal of the chromatic longitudinal aberration and the chromatic difference in magnification as well as to the elimination of the astigmatism for a certain definite locus of the eye.‚Äù But ‚Äúa faultless image outside the axis can only be attained by simultaneously eliminating for the whole telescope the spherical longitudinal aberration and the condition of sine.‚Äù These requirements were fulfilled by the invention in question, in which the astigmatic difference no longer depended ‚Äúso largely from the locus of the eye, as such has been the case in the Galilean telescopes hitherto known.‚Äù This was achieved by ‚Äúmaking the objective consist of two collective members, each of which is composed of two cemented lenses, of which the one having the lower refractive index is facing the incident light, and by composing the ocular of three cemented lenses, the inner one being a flint lens.‚Äù Up to the present day, Erfle's patents have continued to be cited in later patent applications by other scientists.

The Efik speak the Efik language which is a Benue‚ÄìCongo language of the Cross River family. Efik oral histories tell of migration down the Cross River from Arochukwu to found numerous settlements in the Calabar and Creek Town area. Creek Town and its environs are often commonly referred to as Calabar, and its people as Calabar people, after the European name Calabar Kingdom given to the state [in present-day Cross River State. Calabar is not to be confused with the Kalabari Kingdom in Rivers State which is an Ijaw state to its west. Cross River State with Akwa Ibom State was formerly one of the original twelve states of Nigeria known as the Southeastern State. The Efik people also occupy southwestern Cameroon including Bakassi. This area, formerly a trust territory from German Cameroon, was administered as a part of the Eastern Region of Nigeria until it achieved autonomy in 1954, thus separating the Efik people politically. This separation was further extended when as a result of a 1961 plebiscite the area voted to join the Republic of Cameroon. Most of the area was immediately transferred, but in August 2006 - Nigeria handed over the Bakassi peninsula to Cameroon. History Ethno-linguistic groups in Nigeria.

The Efik are related to the Annang, Ibibio, Oron, Biase, Akamkpa, Uruan, and Eket people. Although the actual origins of the Efik people are unknown, oral traditions provide accounts of their migration from Igbo and Ibibio territory (to the north-west of Calabar) to the present location. The bulk of them left to Uruan in present-day Akwa Ibom State, some to Eniong and surrounding areas. They stayed in Uruan for about a hundred or so years and then moved to Ikpa Ene and Ndodihi briefly before crossing over to their final destination in Creek Town (Esit Edik / Obio Oko). There would seem to be three successive stages in the history of efik migration and settlement: (a) an Igbo phase (b) an Ibibio phase and (c) the drift to the coast. The people of Uruan were said to have given them the name \\"Efik\\" deriving from a verb meaning to press or oppress, since they were alleged to be aggressive. Although their economy was originally based on fishing, the area quickly developed into a major trading centre and remained so well into the early 1900s. Incoming European goods were traded for slaves, palm oil and other palm products. The Efik kings collected a trading tax called comey from docking ships until the British replaced it with 'comey subsidies'.Fubara, Dagogo M.J.

Latham (Contributor), David Northrup (Contributor) The Efik were the middle men between the white traders on the coast and the inland tribes of the Cross River and Calabar district. Christian missions were at work among the Efiks beginning in the middle of the 19th century. Mary Slessor, a Presbyterian missionary from Scotland, was concerned with eliminating the superstitious practice of killing twin babies. Even by 1900, many of the native peoples were well educated in European ideologies and culture, professed Christianity and dressed in European fashion. In 1884 the Efik kings and the chiefs of the Efik placed themselves under British protection. These treaties and attendant territorial economic rights, are documented in CAP 23 of Laws of Eastern Nigeria, captioned 'Comey subsidies law'. The Efik king, also known as the Obong of Calabar, still (as of 2006) is a political power among the Efik.Nwagbara, Friday (2 June 2006) \\"Efik monarch withholds blessing for South-South\\" The Tide Rivers State Newspaper Corp., Port Harcourt, Nigeria ; The Efik and indeed the people of the Old Calabar kingdom were the first to embrace western education in present-day Nigeria, with the establishment of Hope Waddel Training Institute, Calabar in 1895 and the Methodist Boys' High School, Oron in 1905. Secret societies A powerful bond of union among the Efik, and one that gives them considerable influence over other tribes, is the secret society known as the Ekpe, the inventor of the Nsibidi, an ancient African script. This society was transformed into the Abaku√° cult in Cuba, the Bonk√≥ cult in Bioko and the Abakuya dance in mainland Equatorial Guinea. The Ekpe society is exclusive for male, while females have their own Ekpa society. People of Efik descent are known as √±√°√±igos or carabal√≠s in Cuba. Language The Efik people speak the Efik language, which is a Benue‚ÄìCongo language of the Cross River family.

His notes and testimony contained colorful quotes by Microsoft executives threatening to \\"cut off Netscape's air supply\\" and Bill Gates' guess that \\"this antitrust thing will blow over\\". Attorney David Boies said that McGeady's testimony showed him to be \\"an extremely conscientious, capable and honest witness\\", while Microsoft portrayed him as someone with an \\"axe to grind\\".Computer Business Review Online, 13 November 1998 McGeady left Intel in 2000, but later again gained notoriety for defending his former employee Mike Hawash after his arrest on federal terrorism charges. From its founding in 2002 until its sale in November 2013, he was Chairman of Portland-based healthcare technology firm ShiftWise.Business Week Executive Profile He is a member of the Reed College Board of Trustees, the Portland Art Museum Board of Trustees, and the PNCA Board of Governors, and lives in Portland, Oregon. Early life Steven McGeady was born in Baltimore, Maryland. His father was a manager for Bethlehem Steel. After high school in Michigan City, Indiana he briefly attended Purdue University. Then in 1976, he enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. While attending Reed College from 1976 to 1980, he studied Physics and Philosophy but did not graduate. The majority of his time was occupied at the school's computer center where he and friends would experiment with a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-11/70 computer donated by Howard Vollum, the founder of Tektronix. Reed's computer was the first in the Northwest to run the Unix operating system, allowing McGeady to become an early developer in that environment. After college, McGeady was a software engineering manager at Ann Arbor Terminals and Oregon based Tektronix. In 1985 he joined Intel, and in 1991 he co-founded the Intel Architecture Labs in Hillsboro. In 1993, he was promoted to a vice president position at the company.  Intel  At the time of his departure in June 2000, McGeady was Vice President of Intel's New Business Group. During 15 years at Intel, he led a variety of software, marketing, and investment initiatives for Intel, including the i960 RISC microprocessor software development, Intel's digital video and multimedia research, Intel's first Internet development group, and a group focused on Internet-based healthcare delivery. McGeady was a co-founder of the Intel Architecture Labs, a research and development group focused on advancing the personal-computer platform. McGeady ran the software, multimedia, data security, and Internet programs within this group for most of the 1990s. His group developed Intel's ProShare video-conferencing technology, the Indeo video compression technology, and Intel's Display Control Interface and VxD graphics software, later licensed to Microsoft to form the core of DirectX. His research group worked with the MIT Media Lab, Xerox PARC, and other groups, and developed early prototypes of digital video recorders (DVRs), video broadcast servers, and other technologies.Fifth International World Wide Web Conference As manager of the i960 software development tools team from 1986‚Äì1996, McGeady was an early developer and promoter of open- source software, beginning with Richard Stallman's GNU C compiler and tools. McGeady wrote the i960 target for GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) and led the team that developed a suite of tools including a globally optimizing, trace- driven optimizer for gcc and the first GNU Debugger (gdb) port to a remote, stand-alone system. He hired Cygnus Support to integrate those changes into the mainline GNU tools and to improve the tools' ability to deal with many object file formats. McGeady was Vice-President of Intel's Multimedia, Communications, and Internet activities from 1990 through 1996, where he led the development of the first desktop video-compression software for the PC, Intel's early implementations of multimedia network broadcast protocols, the first products to combine television and web pages, online virtual communities, the Java language, and data security infrastructure. As a software engineer and developer, McGeady was often a minority voice at hardware-dominated Intel. In 1996 he was asked by then-CEO Andy Grove to take a job as Grove's assistant and is the only known person to turn the job down. Grove later said that he and Intel would have grasped the importance of the Internet to the company more quickly had McGeady taken the job. McGeady had a less positive relationship with succeeding CEO Craig Barrett, reportedly telling Barrett to \\"pound sand\\" when Barrett instructed him not to testify in the Microsoft case.  Microsoft trials  In 1998, McGeady was a witness for the US Department of Justice in the U.S. vs. Microsoft antitrust case, where he testified about Microsoft's attempts to control Intel's software efforts as well as their behavior toward Netscape and Sun's Javasoft. He was the only executive from the PC industry to testify for the government. McGeady testified that Microsoft opposed Intel's 1995 work on a new technology called Native Signal Processing, which would have used instructions from Intel's chips, rather than software code from Microsoft, to run multimedia and communications programs more quickly. McGeady testified for the government and against Microsoft despite pressure from inside Intel. Intel's then-COO Craig Barrett instructed McGeady not to cooperate with Department of Justice attorneys, but \\"He [told] Barrett to go stuff it\\". McGeady also claimed in his testimonyUnited States v. Microsoft: Trial Summaries that Microsoft Vice- President Paul Maritz had described, in a meeting at Intel, Microsoft's plan to \\"embrace, extend, [and] extinguish\\" the HTML standard until it would be incompatible with the Netscape browser.US Dept. of Justice: Microsoft Engaged In A Predatory Campaign To Crush The Browser Threat To Its Operating System Monopoly While this term had some currency before his 1998 testimony, this was its first prominent public exposure.Intel exec: MS wanted to 'extend, embrace and extinguish' competition Documents presented by the government showed Microsoft was concerned about McGeady: \\"Steve McGeady remains an issue for us. He is a champion of Java and a believer that the day of bloatware is over\\", wrote Microsoft VP Paul Maritz in an email to Bill Gates. \\"He has more IQ than most [people at Intel]\\".Paul Thurrott: Antitrust trial this week: Intel exec testifies In November 1998, McGeady testified that Microsoft leveraged its monopoly power in Windows to impede Intel's ability to compete with Microsoft in areas involving system software and influence of OEMs:Transcripts: November 9 pm through November 12 pm *McGeady testified that Microsoft feared competition from Intel's software development: At an August 2, 1995 meeting Bill Gates allegedly threatened to terminate Windows support for Intel's new microprocessors unless they were able to \\"get alignment\\" between Intel and MS on Intel's Internet and communications software programs, and Gates allegedly told Andy Grove to shut down the Intel Architecture Labs, the organization driving Intel's Internet program. *McGeady testified that Microsoft was upset that Intel \\"shifting the software boundary\\" without Microsoft's permission: IAL's development of Native Signal Processing (NSP) program caused this concern. NSP was a layer of software that interfaced with both the Windows OS and the hardware in order to support real-time audio, real-time video, and 3D graphics. According to McGeady, NSP threatened Microsoft because it was software at the operating system level, while Microsoft believed they \\"owned software to the metal\\", (i.e., to the hardware level). (10AM17, 12PM13) Ultimately, Andy Grove admitted that Intel \\"caved\\" by retracting NSP. *Microsoft was concerned about IAL: Gates allegedly said regarding Intel Architecture Labs: \\"Having 700 software engineers running around in the industry is an okay thing as long as Microsoft knows what they're doing first\\". According to McGeady, they did not want to relinquish control over any application interfaces to Intel. To take advantage of multimedia hardware, Intel was writing device drivers that allowed application developers direct control of (e.g.) graphics and video devices. To prevent this Microsoft threatened to continue bad-mouthing IAL's software and to withhold support for Intel's MMX microprocessor. *McGeady testified that Microsoft used its monopoly power in Windows to restrict support for Netscape and Java, and to their plans to compete with Netscape through predatory pricing, through the leveraging of their Windows OS monopoly, and through the creation of incompatible HTML standards: Netscape: McGeady testified that Microsoft generally discouraged Intel from working with Netscape, and that Gates allegedly urged Grove to push Intel's internal information technology group away from Netscape's server toward Microsoft's IIS, and stressed that it was \\"very important\\" that Intel \\"NOT ever publicly say they are standardizing on Netscape browsers\\". McGeady testified to Microsoft's three-prong strategy to defeat Netscape: they allegedly stated that they would \\"cut off Netscape's air supply\\" by giving away Internet Explorer for free, preventing Netscape from deriving any revenue from its browser; that Microsoft asserted they would \\"fight with the OS and the apps arm\\", meaning they would create dependencies between Windows and the browser that would create advantages for their browser over Netscape's; and MS's professed strategy of \\"embrace, extend, extinguish\\", planning to \\"extend\\" the HTML standard to the point where it would be incompatible with the Netscape browser. Java: McGeady testified that Microsoft made it clear to Intel that support for Java would be a \\"show stopper\\" in Intel's relationship with Microsoft, threatening to terminate cooperation that Intel required for new microprocessors. Microsoft allegedly proposed that Intel help them prevent the Java component model from becoming a de facto standard by developing a Java system incompatible with Sun's, defeating Java's \\"write once, run anywhere\\" capabilities, and tying Java to Windows. Microsoft would distribute this Java virtual machine as part of Internet Explorer, a variant of MS's \\"embrace, extend, extinguish\\" strategy. When Microsoft learned that McGeady's group at Intel had implemented its own Java VM and multimedia class libraries that ran very fast on the Intel architecture, Microsoft became very upset. McGeady testified that Microsoft pressed Intel to stop this work. The DoJ made four major arguments based on McGeady's testimony: #Intel and its software development effort were hampered by Microsoft's bully tactics; #Microsoft used Intel against Netscape in the \\"Browser Wars\\"; #McGeady was an expert witness on software standards, innovation and competition; and #McGeady felt Microsoft hampered Java development. Microsoft, in their response to McGeady's testimony, made the point that his testimony contained several pro-Microsoft threads and that Intel practiced similar cross-product subsidization, distributing free Intel Architecture Labs software funded by microprocessor revenues. They also claimed that Microsoft's influence over Intel and its microprocessors was unrelated to the downstream software segment. Cross-examination of McGeady revealed conflicting interpretations of many Microsoft/Intel meetings, differing reasons for Intel's decisions, and for McGeady's anti-Microsoft bias: #Microsoft defended its attempts to coordinate strategy with Intel and tried to dispel the bully image; #Microsoft presented reasons for the discontinuation of Intel's Native Signal Processing initiative; #Microsoft highlighted Intel practices that resemble Microsoft's alleged anti-competitive behavior; #Microsoft defended its Java program; and #Microsoft aggressively attacked McGeady to discredit him as a witness. McGeady's notes suggested that portions of his testimony could be considered embellishments or stories heard in other contexts, and he was frequently forced to suggest that he had a recollection of meetings and conversations superior to that of other Intel officials, as well as Netscape officers. Microsoft revealed Intel documents that painted McGeady as a \\"prima donna\\" who was criticized for his department's belligerence toward Microsoft. Microsoft claimed that McGeady's actions suggested that he considered himself above Intel policy and an extra- corporate defender of truth and justice in the Internet world, and McGeady openly suggested that Intel's interference with Microsoft would aid the industry. McGeady admitted leaking confidential information to The New York Times journalist John Markoff and met with Netscape's Jim Clark to keep Netscape from being complacent about the threat from Microsoft. Documents show McGeady envisioning entrapping Microsoft in an antitrust suit, and later he indirectly volunteered to testify against Microsoft. McGeady was called again to testify in the 2001 remedy phase of the Microsoft trial.  Other activities  During 1996/97, McGeady was a visiting researcher at the MIT Media Lab, pursuing research on emergent and self-organizing behavior in computer networks. During this time he was a keynote speaker at the first Harvard Conference on the Internet and Society. His speech from the event, \\"The Digital Reformation: Freedom, Risk, Responsibility\\" was reprinted in the Harvard Journal of Law and Technology, and is credited by some as formulating early theories regarding what became social media. During 1997 and 1998, McGeady was a member of the National Research Council Computer Science and Technology Board Committee on Information Systems Trustworthiness, and is a co-author of its book on the subject.Trust in Cyberspace. Committee on Information Systems Trustworthiness, National Research Council (1999).  Mike Hawash case  McGeady entered the news again in 2003 because of his defense of his former Intel employee Mike Hawash who was arrested at Intel in early 2003. McGeady organized a defense fund and protested Hawash's 6-week incommunicado detention without charge. Hawash ultimately pleaded guilty to conspiring to aid the Taliban in fighting against U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and received a reduced sentence in the so-called Portland Seven case in exchange for testifying against some of his co-conspirators.

It also refers to methods or devices which can translate sounds or music into a related visual presentation. An expanded definition may include the translation of music to painting; this was the original definition of the term, as coined by Roger Fry in 1912 to describe the work of Wassily Kandinsky. There are a variety of definitions of visual music, particularly as the field continues to expand. In some recent writing, usually in the fine art world, visual music is often confused with or defined as synaesthesia, though historically this has never been a definition of visual music. Visual music has also been defined as a form of intermedia. Visual music also refers to systems which convert music or sound directly into visual forms, such as film, video, computer graphics, installations or performances by means of a mechanical instrument, an artist's interpretation, or a computer. The reverse is applicable also, literally converting images to sound by drawn objects and figures on a film's soundtrack, in a technique known as drawn or graphical sound. Famous visual music artists include Jordan Belson, Oskar Fischinger, Norman McLaren, John Whitney Sr., and Thomas Wilfred, plus a number of contemporary artists. Instruments Sometimes also called \\"color music\\", the history of this tradition includes many experiments with color organs. Artist or inventors \\"built instruments, usually called 'color organs,' that would display modulated colored light in some kind of fluid fashion comparable to music\\".Moritz, W, (1997), The Dream of Color Music, And Machines That Made it Possible in Animation World Magazine For example, the Farblichtspiele ('coloured-light-plays') of former Bauhaus student Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack. Several different definitions of color music exist; one is that color music is generally formless projections of colored light. Some scholars and writers have used the term color music interchangeably with visual music. The construction of instruments to perform visual music live, as with sonic music, has been a continuous concern of this art. Color organs, while related, form an earlier tradition extending as early as the eighteenth century with the Jesuit Louis Bertrand Castel building an ocular harpsichord in the 1730s (visited by Georg Philipp Telemann, who composed for it). Other prominent color organ artist-inventors include: Alexander Wallace Rimington, Bainbridge Bishop, Thomas Wilfred, Charles Dockum, Mary Hallock-Greenewalt and Kurt Laurenz Theinert. On film Visual music and abstract film or video often coincide. Some of the earliest known films of these two genres were hand- painted works produced by the Futurists Bruno Corra and Arnaldo Ginna between 1911 and 1912 (as they report in the Futurist Manifesto of Cinema), which are now lost. Mary Hallock-Greenewalt produced several reels of hand-painted films (although not traditional motion pictures) that are held by the Historical Society of Philadelphia. Like the Futurist films, and many other visual music films, her 'films' were meant to be a visualization of musical form. Notable visual music filmmakers include: Walter Ruttmann, Hans Richter, Viking Eggeling, Oskar Fischinger, Len Lye, Jordan Belson, Norman McLaren, Harry Smith, Hy Hirsh, John and James Whitney, Steven Woloshen and many others up to present day. Artist Larry Cuba, founded the iota Fund in 1994, which was later called iotaCenter. They currently own the films of such artists as Sara Petty, Adam Beckett, some of the films of Jules Engel, Sky David, Robert Darroll and others. They hosted the renowned Kinetica programs (1999‚Äì2003) touring the world introducing new audiences to the wonders of visual music. Computer graphics Oscilloscope showing a single pitch, a sine wave The cathode ray tube made possible the oscilloscope, an early electronic device that can produce images that are easily associated with sounds from microphones. The modern Laser lighting display displays wave patterns produced by similar circuitry. The imagery used to represent audio in digital audio workstations is largely based on familiar oscilloscope patterns. The Animusic company (originally called 'Visual Music') has repeatedly demonstrated the use of computers to convert music  principally pop-rock based and composed as MIDI events  to animations. Graphic artist-designed virtual instruments which either play themselves or are played by virtual objects are all, along with the sounds, controlled by MIDI instructions. In the image-to-sound sphere, MetaSynth includes a feature which converts images to sounds. The tool uses drawn or imported bitmap images, which can be manipulated with graphic tools, to generate new sounds or process existing audio. A reverse function allows the creation of images from sounds. Some media player software generates animated imagery or music visualization based on a piece of recorded music: *autom@ted_VisualMusiC_ 4.0 planned and realized by Sergio Maltagliati. This program can be configured to create random multiple visual-music variations, starting from a simple sonorous/visual cell. It generates a new and original audio-visual composition each time play is clicked. Virtual reality With the increasing popularity of head mounted displays for virtual reality there is an emerging new platform for visual music. While some developers have been focused on the impact of virtual reality on live music or on the possibilities for music videos, virtual reality is also an emerging field for music visualization and visual music. Graphic notation Many composers have applied graphic notation to write compositions. Pioneering examples are the graphical scores of John Cage and Morton Feldman. Also known is the graphical score of Gy√∂rgy Ligetis Artikulation designed by Rainer Wehinger. Musical theorists such as Harry Partch, Erv Wilson, Ivor Darreg, Glenn Branca, and Yuri Landman applied geometry in detailed visual musical diagrams explaining microtonal structures and musical scales.

Origins On the outbreak of war with Russia in 1788, Sweden planned to attack the Russian capital St. Petersburg. One Swedish army was to advance through Finland; a second army, accompanied by the Swedish coastal flotilla, was to advance along the Finnish coast into the Gulf of Finland; while a third army sailed with the Swedish battlefleet in order to land at Oranienbaum to advance on St. Petersburg. To succeed, the Russian Baltic Fleet had to be eliminated or blockaded in its ports at Reval (now Tallinn) and Kronstadt. A part of the Swedish battlefleet, 12 ships of the line and 5 frigates under the command of Prince Karl, Duke Charles of S√∂dermanland had set sail from Karlskrona on 9 June 1788. While Duke Charles had overall command of the fleet, he was assisted by Admiral Anton Johan Wrangel (the younger) and had experienced naval officer Lieutenant Colonel Otto Henrik Nordenskj√∂ld as his flag-captain. Already before the war started, the fleet had intercepted a small Russian squadron of 3 ships of the line and 4 frigates headed for Denmark and demanded these to salute his flag which was in direct contradiction of the treaties of 1743. After being notified that state of war was in effect on 7 July, the Swedish fleet headed for Helsingfors to wait for reinforcements. Before reaching the destination, the Swedes intercepted and promptly captured two Russian frigates, which were unaware of the war and got caught by surprise. At Helsingfors three ships of the line joined the fleet together with one frigate and 2 light frigates from the Swedish archipelago fleet. On 14 July, the Swedish fleet with a front line of 20 ships, of which 15 were ships of the line and five were frigates, together with 6 lighter frigates sailed deeper into the Gulf of Finland. Russians were well aware of the Swedish movements in the Baltic Sea but still had hopes that the situation would not escalate into a war. Already on 4 July 1788, Admiral Samuel Greig moved his fleet of 12 ships of the line, 5 frigates and 3 cutters out of Kronstadt. His ships were ordered on 7 July to engage and defeat the Swedish fleet and after receiving reinforcements on 9 July the fleet started sailing towards the western Gulf of Finland. The Russian fleet consisted of 17 ships of the line, 7 frigates and 7 smaller ships after being reinforced. Since most of the sailors had been recruited shortly before that and had no experience with maritime matters, Greig made efforts to train his subordinates to improve their skill. Calm winds left the Russian fleet adrift near the island of Bolshoi Tyuters, and Admiral Grieg used this lull for training his hastily assembled fleet. Battle Calm winds slowed down the progress of the fleets and it was not until the morning of 17 July that the opposing fleets were able to see each other. The Swedish fleet formed into line and tried to close in the distance using north-easterly heading. After preparing the ships for battle, the Swedish battle line reversed their direction and headed south in order to avoid the perilous coastal waters. The Russian fleet responded in kind but the turn had reversed their intended battle line and caused some disorder in the vanguard which forced four ships to leave the others behind. The first shots were fired by the Swedish lead ship Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotta at 17:00 on 17 July. As ships from both sides joined the battle, the already very mild winds kept getting calmer. As the winds diminished it became impossible for ships to maintain their positions by sails alone; currents in the sea forced both sides to use longboats to move and steer their ships. The Swedes also concentrated their fire on the masts and rigging of the Russian ships in order to further impede them. The Swedish flagship Gustaf III had drawn the attention of the Russian flagship Rotislav as well as that of two other Russian ships which concentrated their fire on the Swedish flagship. Damage to the rigging of the Gustaf III made it vulnerable to the currents and the ship started turning, nearly exposing its vulnerable rear to the Russians. The Russians tried to take advantage of this by towing two of their ships into positions where they could fire on the Swedish flagship. Meanwhile, the Russian 74 gun ship of line Vladislav had struck its colors to the Swedish ships Prins Gustaf Adolf and Sofia Magdalena after fierce close range action. The Vladislav had drifted into the Swedish line after losing both its rigging and its longboats. By 20:00 in the evening the Swedish ship of the line Prins Gustaf, commanded by Vice-Admiral Gustav Wachtmeister, which had finally forced its opponent, the Russian ship of the line Svetaja Jelena to depart from the battle line was engaged by another Russian ship of the line Vseslav. Calm winds hadn't dissipated the thick clouds of gunpowder smoke which hid the Prins Gustaf from the other Swedish ships which by this time turned around leaving the Swedish ship to face several Russian ships alone. Prins Gustaf was pounded by four Russian ships of the line and was forced to strike its colors. Disorder in the Swedish line following the turn and the visible attempts to tow the flagship away from the battle line made the Russians believe that they had won the battle. Gunfire finally ended with the surrender of Prins Gustaf by 2200 on 17 July 1788. Swedish flag-captain Nordenski√∂ld intended to resume the engagement in the first light but the reports of severe damage to the ships as well as lack of ammunition prevented this and instead at 0300 on 18 July the Swedish fleet was ordered to sail to Sveaborg. Swedish fleet had come better off from the engagement as unlike the Russian fleet it had been able to sail away from the battle. Nine of the ships of the line had suffered only light damage which full third of the ships in fleet had suffered heavy but mostly repairable damage to the hull, riggings and masts. The Russian fleet under Admiral Grieg had been unable to chase the Swedish and was forced to lay anchor at the site of the engagement. Several ships had been hulled and stayed only afloat by pumps. Eight of the Russian ships of the line had been severely damaged and four of those could no longer be sailed but had to be towed away. Russian fleet started slowly back towards Kronstadt on 19 July after critical repairs. On return voyage fleet encountered heavy weather near island of Seskar causing more damage to some of the ships. Aftermath Unusually for a naval battle, both sides captured one ship. The Swedes fared slightly better in the artillery duel leaving four Russian ships dead in the water but failed to capitalize their success while all Swedish ships were able to set sail after the battle. The Russians suffered the worst casualties, losing 319-580 men killed compared with between 200 and 300 Swedes, but the battle was a strategic victory for the Russians because Greig had done enough to prevent the Swedish landing. One reason why fight had ended even though Swedish battlefleet had the advantage was that Swedish fleet was rapidly running out of ammunition especially to its heavier cannons and had to depart. Swedish battlefleet retired to Sveaborg for repairs and resupply. However upon arriving the prepared stocks at the Swedish forward base were noticed to have been prepared solely with coastal or archipelago fleet in mind. The result of this was that the Swedish battlefleet had sailed to Sveaborg only to be stranded there as the ships could not be re-armed or repaired. Situation was aggravated when small Russian squadron under James Trevenen blockaded Hang√∂ cutting the coastal sea route causing considerable problems for Swedish material deliveries from Sweden. Admiral Grieg hurried the repairs of the Russian fleet and constructed a forward base to the island of Seskar to accomplish this. Already by 5 August the Russian fleet set sail towards Sveaborg. It encountered Swedish squadron which had been tasked on investigating the status of the Russian fleet outside of Sveaborg on the early hours of 6 August. Swedish ships fled disorderly to the safety of the fortress but the ship of the line Prins Gustaf Adolf run into a previously unknown underwater rock at full speed and sails spread. The Ship then grounded on the rock and started flooding heavily. Water quickly also flooded the ship's gunpowder magazines forcing it to strike its colours. Russians took the crew as prisoners but were unable to re-float the ship and instead torched it. Prisoners the Swedes had captured from the Vladislav had carried relapsing fever which now spread widely amongst the Swedish crews at Sveaborg further impeding any chances of getting the fleet either ready to sail or ready to fight. The Russian fleet under Admiral Grieg had total control over the Baltic Sea and with new ships could deploy full 18 ships of the line. Control of Reval made it easy for the Russians to maintain their blockade.

(ed.) (2003) The Concise Larousse Gastronomique London: Hamlyn The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition definition from dictionary.com Gratin originated in French cuisine and is usually prepared in a shallow dish of some kind. A gratin is baked or cooked under an overhead grill or broiler to form a golden crust on top and is often served in its baking dish. A gratin dish is a shallow oven-proof container used to prepare gratins and similar dishes. Terminology The etymology of gratin is from the French language words gratter, meaning \\"to scrape\\" or \\"to grate\\" (for example, \\"scrapings\\" of bread or cheese), and gratin√©, from the transitive verb form of the word for crust or skin.Gratin from epicurious.com's Food Dictionary The technique predates the current name which did not appear in English until 1846 (OED, s.v. \\"gratin\\"). In addition to the well-known potato dishes such as gratin dauphinois, gratin may be applied to many other bases of meat, fish, vegetables, or pasta.Le R√©pertoire de La Cuisine by Louis Saulnier, 17th Edition, published 1982 Preparations=Potato-based=Potatoes gratin√© Potatoes gratin√© Potatoes gratin√© is one of the most common of gratins and is known by various names including \\"gratin potatoes\\" and \\"Gratin de pommes de terre\\". Slices of boiled potato are put in a buttered fireproof dish, sprinkled with cheese and browned in the oven or under the grill (broiler). They may also be baked under a steamed crust of potatoes.Elvia Firuski; Maurice Firuski (eds.) (1952) The Best of Boulestin. London: William Heinemann. p. 249. In North America, the dish is referred to variously as scalloped potatoes, funeral potatoes, potatoes au gratin, or au gratin potatoes. (Note that the term scalloped originally referred to a style of seafood dish rather than to one specifically based on the scallop.)Rombauer, Irma S. and Marion Rombauer Becker (1931 [1964]) The Joy of Cooking, p 369. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill. . In French-speaking Canada, the dish is referred to as patates au gratin. Australians and New Zealanders refer to it as scalloped potatoes or potato bake. Pommes de terre gratin√©es To make pommes de terre gratin√©es, or \\"potatoes with cheese\\", according to the recipe of Marcel Boulestin, large floury potatoes are baked in the oven, then halved and the flesh scooped from the skins. The flesh is then mashed together with butter, cream, grated cheese and seasoning(s). The mix is then scooped back into the skins, arranged in a baking dish, sprinkled with grated cheese and browned in the oven or under the grill. This preparation is also called twice- baked potatoes. Gratin dauphinois Gratin Dauphinois is a speciality of the Dauphin√© region of France. The dish is typically made with thinly sliced and layered potatoes and cream, cooked in a buttered dish rubbed with garlic. Some recipes add cheese and egg.Elizabeth David (1964 [1960]) French Provincial Cooking. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books. pp. 251‚Äì2. Gratin savoyard Gratin savoyard is a similar dish found in the adjacent Savoie (Savoy) department. It consists of alternating layers of sliced potatoes, Beaufort cheese, and pieces of butter, with bouillon as the liquid.Larousse Gastronomique (2001) Cream is not used. =Other preparations=Pasta A common alternative to using potatoes in a gratin is the use of various kinds of pasta, such as penne, rigatoni, fusilli / spirelli, or tagliatelle. Seafood Sole au gratin is a sole gratin, often is covered with mushrooms. Many fish-based gratins use a white gratin sauce and cheese, and brown quickly. Cozze gratinate is a mussels-based recipe found in Italy. Vegetable Gratin Languedocien is made with eggplant and tomato, covered in breadcrumbs and oil, then browned. This dish is similar to the Italian dish known as melanzane alla parmigiana. Other vegetables commonly used in gratin dishes include cauliflower, spinach, and butternut squash. Janssons frestelse (\\"Jansson's Temptation\\") is a Swedish gratin of potatoes, onions, and preserved fish, somewhat similar to a French dish of potatoes with anchovies.Julia Child, Mastering the Art of French Cooking I, 1961:154f \\"Gratin de pommes de terre aux anchois\\" Many gratin√©ed dishes are topped with b√©chamel, mornay or other sauces.Julia Child, Mastering the Art of French Cooking (1961) See also * List of casserole dishes References Category:Casserole dishes Category:French cuisine Category:Cuisine of Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes Category:Potato dishes Category:Baked goods ","title":"Gratin"},{"id":"3959712","text":"Now That's What I Call Music! 62 or Now 62 refers to at least two Now That's What I Call Music! series albums, including: *Now That's What I Call Music! 62 (UK series) *Now That's What I Call Music! 62 (U.S. series) ","title":"Now That's What I Call Music! 62"},{"id":"3959715","text":"William Moritz (May 6, 1941 ‚Äì March 12, 2004), film historian, specialized in visual music and experimental animation. His principal published works concerned abstract filmmaker and painter Oskar Fischinger. He also wrote extensively on other visual music artists who worked with motion pictures, including James and John Whitney and Jordan Belson; Moritz also published on German cinema, Visual Music, color organs, experimental animation, avant-garde film and the California School of Color Music. Early life Moritz was born in Williams, Arizona and raised in California and Arizona. His father Edward Moritz, a German immigrant, influenced his son's interest in music and literature. In an interview with Cindy Keefer of the Center for Visual Music in Los Angeles, Moritz related the importance of his early experiences with animation: > I saw a lot of animation in movie theatres, while growing up (there was no > television then), like Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Porky Pig, Woody > Woodpecker cartoons, character animation made by studios. This was a vital > part of everyday life. The big transformation for me was seeing interesting > animation ‚Äî the UPA cartoons in particular were really a completely > different change. I saw things that were actually art, and not just > cartoons. Moritz received his Ph.D in comparative literature from the University of Southern California in 1968; though he took courses in Cinema Studies, his degrees were in comparative literature, possibly due to what one colleague speculates was the lack of \\"a credible Cinema Studies program until the 1980s.\\" (Deneroff 2004) Scholarship Moritz developed his interest in the work of Oskar Fischinger while a student at USC in 1958. His early enthusiasm for Fischinger's work became the focus of his career: \\"I saw my first Fischinger film, and it popped all my buttons!\\" (Keefer 2003) Moritz's first major critical work on Fischinger was published in Film Culture, in an issue devoted largely to this extensive essay about Fischinger, in 1974. In 1969, Moritz had begun his decades-long study, aided by Fischinger's widow Elfriede, finally culminating in the major biographical work Optical Poetry: The Life and Work of Oskar Fischinger (2004). (The title is an allusion to An Optical Poem, a short film made by Fischinger for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1937). Optical Poetry is regarded as a major study of Fischinger's life and work. It received a Willy Haas Award as best book publication at cinefest - International Festival of German Film Heritage 2004. Moritz had a long career as teacher and researcher of film and the humanities. He taught humanities and film history, and in the course of his career worked at a wide variety of institutions: the Otis Art Institute, Pitzer College, UCLA, USC, the American University Center (in Calcutta, India). In 1987 he began teaching courses on the \\"History of Experimental Film,\\" \\"History of Animation\\" and \\"Theory of Comedy\\" at CalArts. He also worked at the Creative Film Society (now-defunct), and at radio station KPFK, as a film and music critic. As a film curator, he programmed screenings at a variety of Southern California venues including Theatre Vanguard. He was also involved in film preservation, for which he received an award from Anthology Film Archives. Moritz was himself a filmmaker, making 34 experimental films during his lifetime. He was a published poet, and two of his plays were produced. His performance piece The Midaswel Show was staged for several performances. His most significant contributions however are widely thought to be in the criticism and history of abstract film, experimental film, animation and visual music, as well as his promotion of little-seen films, which he had screened to audiences worldwide. Moritz died on March 12, 2004, at Mokelumne Hill, California after a long battle with cancer. His papers and original research collection are at the Center for Visual Music in Los Angeles, of which he was a founder, and the LGBT-related papers are at ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives in Los Angeles.

This process is known to occur in achiral column chromatography. The phenomenon was first reported in 1983 in the separation of an excess of carbon-14 labeled (S)-(‚àí)-nicotine enantiomer and its isomer. Two fractions were recorded, one containing racemic nicotine and the other pure (S) enantiomer. In 2006, Vadim A. Soloshonok introduced the term Enantiomer self-disproportionation or self-disproportionation of enantiomers. He investigated achiral separations of several trifluoromethyl compounds. Enantiomer self-disproportionation (S)-trifluoromethyl substrate By column chromatography on regular silica gel with a hexane / ethyl acetate eluent (5:1), a 66.6% ee sample of a trifluoromethyl substrate is separated into several fractions ranging from 8.1% ee for the first fraction collected to > 99.9% ee for the last fraction collected. A presence of a strong electronegative group in the substrate such as the trifluoromethyl group is a prerequisite. The effect disappears when a more polar eluent is selected. A possible explanation is offered. Compounds with large electronegative groups such as trifluoromethyl can form supramolecular associations or aggregates or clusters in which these groups are separated from each other as much as possible with minimized electrostatic repulsions. When these associations are stacks of alternating (R) and (S) molecules (as in syndiotactic polymers) this can be accomplished very efficiently. This association will form a racemic fraction of relatively high molecular weight eluting more slowly than the non- associating enantiopure fraction.

Andelson‚Äôs book Critics of Henry George: An Appraisal of Their Strictures on Progress and Poverty, Blackwell Publishing, 2004. His grandson, Spencer Heath MacCallum, popularized and expounded on his ideas, most notably in his book The Art of Community.Spencer MacCallum: Looking Back and Forward, Lewrockwell.com, December 19, 2003.Spencer Heath McCallum, The Art of Community, Institute for Humane Studies, 1970. Life and technical career Heath graduated from the Corcoran Scientific School in Washington, D.C., studying electrical and mechanical engineering. While working for the Navy Department he earned law degrees at National University Law School. In 1898 he married Johanna Maria Holm, a suffragist and friend of Susan B. Anthony. They had three daughters. As a patent lawyer and engineering consultant his clients included Simon Lake, inventor of the even-keel-submerging submarine, and Emile Berliner, inventor of the flat-disk phonograph record. Heath helped Berliner design and build the first rotary engine blades used in helicopters.Alvin Lowi, Jr., P.E. The Legacy of Spencer Heath, July 13, 2006. Heath founded the American Propeller Manufacturing Company in 1909 and developed and first mass-produced airplane propellers, including 70 percent of the propellers used by Americans in World War I. In 1922 he demonstrated the first engine-powered and controlled, variable and reversible pitch propeller. In 1929 he sold his patents and facilities to Bendix Aviation Corporation and retired to work on projects in horticulture and the natural and social sciences,Spencer MacCallum, From Upstate New York to the Horn of Africa\\", Liberty Magazine, May 2005, Volume 19, Number 5. including research with the aim of establishing the basis for an authentic natural science of society. His articles on aeronautical engineering were published by the Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers, the Journal of the Franklin Institute and other technical journals. International Who's Who listed him in 1947-1949 and Who's Who in the East in 1948-1951. Economic and political views Around 1898, attracted by the Georgists' free-trade stance, Spencer Heath became recording secretary for the Chicago Single Tax Club and participated in the movement for 40 years. He assisted in the formation of the Henry George School in New York City and conducted public seminars there on community organization in the early 1930s. School Director Frank Chodorov later fired him for straying from the Georgist line. Heath had rejected the Georgist antipathy toward landlords and had come to believe that society only could outgrow its subservience to the state through a particular use of land. In 1936, he self-published his views in a monograph entitled \\"Politics versus Proprietorship.\\" It was the first statement of the proprietary community principle. In 1952, The Freeman published Heath‚Äôs polemic ‚ÄúProgress and Poverty Reviewed‚Äù, a critique of Henry George's tax argument. Heath completed his major work, Citadel, Market and Altar, in 1946, publishing it through his Science of Society Foundation, Inc. in 1957. In a review of the book Manas journal wrote: > Mr. Heath returns to the socio-economic relationships of pre-Norman England > for the foundation of an ideal society which will combine freedom and > justice. This is a serious book with carefully worked-out plans and precise > definitions. Mr. Heath's notion of ownership is very like Gandhi's > conception of the stewardship of wealth: ‚ÄúIn its Anglo-Saxon meaning, now > only dimly realized, to own was to owe. Ownership was inclusive of others, > not exclusive. What was owned, chiefly land, was held in trust, as it > were.‚ÄùChanging Allegiances, Manas Journal, Vol. X, No. 43, October 23, 1957. Heath wrote: > To obviate the essential tyranny (coercion) of political administration the > proprietary authority, suitably organized, must extend its jurisdiction, and > thus its revenues, by itself supplying police and other community services > without coercion, out of its own revenues and properties, and thus raise its > own values and voluntary incomes. The model for Heathian anarchism is proprietary communities, multi-tenant properties such as hotels, shopping centers, industrial parks, and apartment buildings. Multi-tenant properties are the opposite of traditional real-estate developments; the developers would lease the homes rather than sell them, and thus be responsible for providing community services to maintain rental income and land value. Influence Murray Rothbard based much of his criticism of Henry George on Spencer Heath‚Äôs writings. These in turn have influenced many libertarians. He also mentioned Heath‚Äôs views on community a number of times in his book Man, Economy and State.Murray Rothbard, Man, Economy, and State Scholars Edition, Mises Institute, Auburn, AL, 2004, pp. 565, 660, 670, 891, 936, 1131, 1203, 1204, 1207-08, 1281. Heath's system has been the model for intentional community and \\"new country\\" projects such as Werner K. Stiefel‚Äôs 1970s motel community and ‚ÄúAtlantis‚Äù projects.Spencer H. MacCallum, Werner K. Stiefel ‚Äôs Pursuit of a Practicum of Freedom, LewRockwell.com, June 16, 2006.

Riegel whose papers also are held by the Foundation.E.C. Riegel, The New Approach to Freedom, Editorial preface by Spencer MacCallum, San Pedro, CA, The Heather Foundation, 1979 edition. Spencer MacCallum built upon and promoted his grandfather's ideas of proprietary community in his 1970 booklet The Art of Community and many articles, including \\"The Enterprise of Community: Market Competition, Land, and Environment\\" (2003)Spencer H.

Heath's system differs from the standard anarcho-capitalist private defense agency (PDA) model. Heath himself eschewed the term, and did not refer to himself as an anarchist. The PDA model envisions competing security agencies in the same geographical area rather than a proprietary zone. Citing Spencer MacCallum, economist Edward Stringham discusses how a system composed of many proprietary communities would encourage landlords to provide police in a way that their tenants value most, even if there were one provider of law in a given area. Stringham contrasts that vision with one that focuses on having multiple law enforcement agencies.Stringham, E.P.

Background Shawn Nelson was born in Birdseye, Utah, on August 21, 1959,California Death Records ; accessed May 17, 2009. the second of three sons. He grew up in the Clairemont neighborhood of San Diego, California, and graduated from Madison High School prior to his enlistment in the United States Army, where he served for two years until his honorable discharge in 1980. After his discharge, he returned to San Diego and worked as a plumber. Nelson's mother died in 1988 and his father died in 1992; in between, his wife of six years filed for divorce in 1990. That same year, he was hospitalized at Sharp Memorial Hospital for neck and back injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident. Nelson later sued the hospital for $1.6 million, citing negligence, assault, battery, and false imprisonment. A superior court judge dismissed the case, and the hospital counter-sued for $6,640 in medical fees and legal expenses. Nelson claimed that he was forced to be treated without his consent. Nelson's brother, Scott, said that he became addicted to methamphetamine in the few years prior to the tank incident. His neighbors complained to authorities of him yelling at his roommate at night. Nelson then began to exhibit unusual behavior. On one occasion, he dug a hole deep in his backyard in an attempt to mine for gold. One of his friends, Carson Honings, referred to the mine shaft as Nelson's \\"new hobby\\". In April, he filed two damage claims against the city for police negligence and false arrest totaling $2 million. Nelson's neck and back problems, combined with the theft of plumbing equipment from his truck in June 1994, effectively halted his business. With no income, his utilities were cut off and his house went into foreclosure. In April 1995, Nelson's live-in girlfriend moved out of their shared home. Tank rampage According to San Diego police, in the week before his tank rampage, Nelson told a friend that he was thinking of committing suicide, and the following weekend, told a friend that \\"Oklahoma was good stuff,\\" in apparent reference to the Oklahoma City bombing which happened about a month before. Whether Nelson condoned the attack or simply meant that he enjoyed the drama was not clear. Police did not believe that Nelson had any connection with the bombing or with a terrorist group. At dusk, approximately 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, May 17, 1995, Nelson drove his Chevrolet van to the California Army National Guard Armory on Mesa College Boulevard in the Kearny Mesa neighborhood of San Diego. Employees at the armory were working late and the gate to the vehicle yard, which was completely deserted, was left open. An M60A3 Patton (the same type of tank Nelson drove) on display in April 2005 The tanks at the armory started with a push button and did not require an ignition key. The first two tanks Nelson broke into would not start. As he lowered himself into the third tank, a 57-ton M60A3 Patton, he was finally noticed by a guardsman, who approached the tank. Nelson started the vehicle, and with little chance of stopping him, the guardsman rushed to a phone and called the police. As ammunition was kept in another building, none of the vehicle's weapons could be loaded or used by Nelson. Nelson led police on a 23-minute, televised chase through the streets of Clairemont. Police agencies involved in the chase included the San Diego police, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, the California Highway Patrol, and due to the tank being stolen from the armory, possibly military police as well. The tank had a top speed of , making the chase slow compared to police chases involving automobiles. The 57-ton tank easily plowed through road signs, traffic lights, utility poles, and fire hydrants, and crushed approximately forty parked vehicles, including an RV. The damage to utility poles knocked out power to at least 5,100 San Diego Gas & Electric customers in the Linda Vista neighborhood. From the armory, Nelson traveled along neighborhood streets, eventually turning north on Convoy Street, west on to Balboa Avenue (then signed as State Route 274), and entered Interstate 805 heading south. While on I-805, he attempted to knock down a pedestrian bridge by running into the pillars, but failed after a few hits, and decided to continue onto the freeway. Nelson then drove the tank onto the State Route 163 freeway heading southbound, resulting in the freeway being closed and thousands of motorists being stuck. At least one news article speculated that he may have been headed to Sharp Memorial Hospital, which he had unsuccessfully sued in 1990 and partially blamed for his mother's death. After Nelson attempted to cross into the northbound lanes of State Route 163,Approximate location: just north of the Genesee Avenue interchange, ; refer to San Diego Union-Tribune article of May 18, 1995, including map of Nelson's route the tank became caught on the concrete median barrier and lost one track. After the tank was immobilized, four policemen climbed onto the tank. San Diego Police officer Paul Paxton, a gunnery sergeant at the time with the Marine Corps Reserve, opened the hatch using bolt cutters. They ordered Nelson to surrender, but he said nothing and began rocking the tank back and forth in an attempt to free it from the median. Reproduction of front page, including map of Nelson's route Paxton's partner, Officer Richard Piner, leaned in and shot Nelson. The bullet entered through Nelson's neck. Nelson later died at the Sharp Memorial Hospital. Despite the widespread property destruction, he was the only fatality reported during the rampage. =Police action= Questions were raised as to whether it was necessary for the police to kill Nelson. Police Captain Tom Hall said that if Nelson had managed to free the tank, he \\"could have taken out no less than 35 vehicles that were passing at that moment.\\" Police decided that if non-lethal action such as tear gas were used, this might have stopped Nelson, but not the tank, and officers would not be able to enter the tank if it were still mobile with tear gas present. According to live news coverage at the time, officials were seriously considering asking for help from the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton in the form of a Bell AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter, as the police force lacked the means for disabling a tank. Nelson's brother, Scott, stated that police were justified in the shooting. Armory security Officials at the armory where Nelson stole the tank were criticized for what appeared to be a huge lapse in security, especially after the attack in Oklahoma City the previous month. In addition to the open, unguarded gate to the vehicle lot, the fence surrounding the lot had damaged barbed wire in some places. Residents near the armory said that even if the gate had been locked, Nelson could have simply climbed the fence in sections where the barbed wire was damaged. Armory officials said that only a few people were given keys to the vehicles, that the vehicles were kept far away from fences to make them difficult to reach, that only someone with the proper knowledge could operate and even start a tank, and that there was just no way to foresee such an event taking place. After Nelson's theft of the tank, security was tightened at the Kearny Mesa armory. In popular culture *Cul de Sac: A Suburban War Story, a documentary film, is based on the incident. *The tank rampage also appears in TV shows such as the World's Most Amazing Videos and Destroyed in Seconds. *The rampage is parodied by The Simpsons in the season 11 episode \\"Brother's Little Helper\\".

This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct competent tribunals to determine whether detainees are, or are not, entitled to the protections of prisoner of war status. Subsequently, the Department of Defense instituted the Combatant Status Review Tribunals. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the detainees were lawful combatants‚Äîrather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the detainee had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an enemy combatant.

As a group they are also referred to as the Rabbeinu Sevorai or Rabanan Saborai, and may have played a large role in giving the Talmud its current structure. Modern scholars also use the plural term Stammaim (Hebrew; \\"closed, vague or unattributed sources\\") for the authors of unattributed statements in the Gemara. Role in the formation of the Talmud Much of classical rabbinic literature generally holds that the Babylonian Talmud was redacted into more or less its final form around 550 CE.Oesterley, W. O. E. & Box, G. H. (1920) A Short Survey of the Literature of Rabbinical and Medi√¶val Judaism, Burt Franklin:New York. The Talmud states that Ravina and Rav Ashi (two amoraim) were the \\"end of instruction\\",Bava Metzia 86a which many understand to mean they compiled the Babylonian Talmud.R' Meir Triebitz, History & Development of Talmud 1 Maimonides wrote that Ravina and Rav Ashi were the last generation of sages in the Talmud, and that it was Rav Ashi who composed the Babylonian Talmud.Maimonides, Introduction to Mishneh Torah However, some statements within classical rabbinic literature, and later analysis thereof, have led many scholars to conclude that the Babylonian Talmud was smoothed over by the Savora'im, although almost nothing was changed.Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations Shalom Carmy, Ed. The Orthodox Forum Series, Jason Aronson, Inc. There are statements in the Talmud itself referring to generations later than Ravina and Rav Ashi. Occasionally, multiple versions of the same legalistic discussion are included with minor variations. The text also states that various opinions emanated from various Talmudic academies.Berkovits E., \\"Savora'im\\". In: Encyclopedia Judaica (first edition) Keter Publishing, 1972 Sherira Gaon (c.987 CE) indicates that the Talmud was not in its final form until many generations after Ravina and Rav Ashi, and that Rav Yose was the final member of the Savora'im. Occasionally, specific Savora'im are mentioned by name in the Talmud itself, such as Rabbi Ahai, who (according to later authority Rashbam) was a Savora. David Weiss Halivni, a modern scholar, has attempted to determine the authorship of anonymous portions of the Talmud. Halivni terms the editors of the Talmud as Stamma'im, a new term for rabbis that he places after the period of the Tannaim and Amoraim, but before the Geonic period. He concludes that to a large extent, the Stamma'im essentially wrote the Gemara (the discussions in the Talmud about the Mishna). Halivni posits that during the time of Ravina and Rav Ashi, they compiled a Gemara that was much smaller than the Gemara known today, and which likely was similar to the Mishna and to the Tosefta. He sees this proto- Gemara as a compilation of rulings that probably had little record of discussions. Halivni also posits that the Stamma'im did not always fully understand the context and import of the statement of the Tanna or Amora when it was said. The methodology employed in his commentary, Mekorot u' Mesorot, will attempt to give Halivni's analysis of the correct import and context and will demonstrate how the Talmud erred in its understanding of the original context.David Weiss Halivni Peshat and Drash: Plain and Applied Meaning in Rabbinic Exegesis Oxford University Press, NY, 1991 See also *Eras of history important in Jewish law ReferencesExternal links * JewishEncyclopedia.com: Sabora Category:Orthodox rabbinic roles and titles 4 Category:Chazal ","title":"Savoraim"},{"id":"3959823","text":"Ritzaus Bureau A/S, or Ritzau for short, sometimes stylized as /ritzau/, is a Danish news agency founded by Erik Ritzau in 1866.

Niels Klim's Underground Travels, originally published in Latin as Nicolai Klimii Iter Subterraneum (1741), is a satirical science- fiction/fantasy novel written by the Norwegian-Danish author Ludvig Holberg. His only novel, it describes a utopian society from an outsider's point of view, and often pokes fun at diverse cultural and social topics such as morality, science, sexual equality, religion, governments, and philosophy. Plot summary The novel starts with a foreword that assures that everything in the story is a real account of the title character's exploits in the Underworld. The story is set, according to the book, in the Norwegian harbor town of Bergen in 1664, after Klim returns from Copenhagen, where he has studied philosophy and theology at the University of Copenhagen and graduated magna cum laude. His curiosity drives him to investigate a strange cave in a mountainside above the town, which sends out regular gusts of warm air. He ends up falling down the hole, and after a while he finds himself floating in free space. After a few days of orbiting the planet which revolves around the inner sun, he is attacked by a gryphon, and he falls down on the planet, which is named Nazar. There he wanders about for a short while until he is attacked, this time by an ox. He climbs up into a tree, and to his astonishment the tree can move and talk (this one screamed), and he is taken prisoner by tree-like creatures with up to six arms and faces just below the branches. He is accused of attempted rape on the town clerk's wife, and is put on trial. The case is dismissed and he is set by the Lord of Potu (the utopian state in which he now is located) to learn the language. Klim quickly learns the language of the Potuans, but this reflects badly on him when the Lord is about to issue him a job, because the Potuans believe that if one perceives a problem at a slow rate, the better it will be understood and solved. But, since he has considerably longer legs than the Potuans, who walk very slowly, he is set to be the Lord's personal courier, delivering letters and suchlike. During the course of the book, Klim vividly chronicles the culture of the Potuans, their religion, their way of life and the many different countries located on Nazar. After his two-month-long circumnavigation on foot, he is appalled by the fact that men and women are equal and share the same kind of jobs, so he files a suggestion to the Lord of Potu to remove women from higher positions in society. His suggestion is poorly received and he is sentenced to be exiled to the inner rim of the Earth's crust. There he becomes familiar with a country inhabited by sentient monkeys, and after a few years he becomes emperor of the land of Quama, inhabited by the only creatures in the Underworld that look like humans. There, he marries and fathers a son. But again he is driven from hearth and home due to his tyranny and as he escapes he falls into a hole, which carries him through the crust and back up to Bergen again. There, he is mistaken by the townsfolk to be the Wandering Jew, mostly due to a lingual misunderstanding (he asks a couple of young boys where he is in quamittian, which is Jeru Pikal Salim, and the boys think he is talking about Jerusalem). He learns that he has been away for twelve years, and is taken in by his old friend, mayor Abelin, who writes down everything Klim tells him. He later receives a job as principal of the college of Bergen, and marries.  Influence  * Holberg knew that the satirical content of the novel would cause an uproar in Denmark-Norway, so the book was first published in Germany, in Latin. He thus got a broader audience than he would have gotten in his homeland. The novel made him widely acclaimed across Europe. Danish, German, French, and Dutch translations were also published in 1741. * The book is significant in the history of science fiction, being one of the first science- fiction novels in history along with Johannes Kepler's Somnium (The Dream, 1634), Cyrano de Bergerac's Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon (1656), Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726), and Voltaire's Microm√©gas (1752). Along with a number of those stories, an excerpt was included in the anthology The Road to Science Fiction, Volume 1: From Gilgamesh to Wells. * The work is referenced in Poe's \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\". * It is one of the first science fiction novels to use the Hollow Earth concept. * The Danish Communist author and artist Hans Scherfig [1905‚Äì1979] created a graphic retelling of \\"Niels Klims underjordiske rejse\\", which was originally published in the Danish newspaper Land og folk [Country and people] from 3 July 1955 to 21 January 1956 and later as a book at Sirius Publishing House, Risskov, Denmark in October 1961. * The story was adapted to a costly 3 episode TV-series for The Danish Broadcasting Corporation in 1984, starring actor Frits Helmuth in the title role. Allusions * In one chapter, Klim refers to Pliny the Elder and his Naturalis Historia when he feels that his descriptions of the Underworld inhabitants would seem too incredible for other humans to believe. * There are a few characters in the book that were actual persons. Niels Klim (died 1690) was employed at Holy Cross Church, a church in downtown Bergen, as bellringer. He was also a retailer of books and a publisher. Klim's friend in the book, Mayor Abelin, was also a real person named Rasmus Christenssen Abelin, and he was mayor of Bergen in Klim's lifetime.

Taylor, was a Scottish playwright. He wrote almost 80 plays during his 16 years as a professional playwright, including several for radio and television. He also made a number of documentary programmes for the BBC. His plays tended to draw on his Jewish background and his Socialist viewpoint, and to be written in dialect. Personal life Taylor was born on 6 November 1929 in Glasgow and grew up in the Crosshill district of Govanhill, in a politically radical Jewish family with strong ties to the Labour Party. His parents immigrated from Russia. He left school at 14 and began his working life as a radio and television repairman. In 1955, when he was 26, he met his first wife, Irene Diamond, in a drama group. In order for them to afford to marry, he took a job as a record salesman in Newcastle, the city where his mother had grown up. He and Irene lived there, in Fenham, for many years and had two children, Avram and Clare. In 1967 he married Elizabeth Screen, with whom he also had two children, David and Catheryn. Shortly after their marriage, he and Elizabeth settled at the village of Longhorsley in Northumberland, where he lived until his death on 9 December 1981. He is buried in St. Helen's Church graveyard in the village. His death from pneumonia has been attributed to his habit of writing in his garden shed. Plays His first play Mr David (1954) won second prize in a playwriting competition organised by the World Jewish Congress. Unperformed until 1969, a production was arranged by the Jewish State Theatre in Warsaw. In 1962 Aa Went Tae Blaydon Races was the first play by Taylor to be premiered by a professional theatre company. A historical drama about a miners' strike on Tyneside in 1862, it opened the new Flora Robson Theatre in Newcastle. A long relationship with the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh began in 1965, enabling Taylor to leave his day job and concentrate on his work as a dramatist. The first play for the Traverse was Happy Days Are Here Again, followed by Bread and Butter (1966), Lies about Vietnam (1969), The Black and White Minstrels (1972), Next Year in Tel Aviv (1973), Schippel (1974), Gynt (1975), Walter (1975), and Withdrawal Symptoms (1978). By the late 1970s, Taylor became increasingly involved with the Live Theatre Company in Newcastle, which premiered several of his plays, among them Some Enchanted Evening (1977), Bandits (1977), Operation Elvis (1978), And a Nightingale Sang (1978) ‚Äì a bitter-sweet comedy set on wartime Tyneside ‚Äì and The Saints Go Marching In (1980 ‚Äì later known as Bring Me Sunshine, Bring Me Smiles'). In The Peter Pan Man (Scottish Youth Theatre 1978) he transferred J. M. Barrie's play to an Elswick estate. His most successful play is probably Good (1981), in which the liberal German professor Halder (Alan Howard) becomes involved with the Third Reich war machine and Auschwitz through moral cowardice and subtle corruption. Halder, however, continues to see himself as a 'good man' even as he is drawn further and further into Hitler's nightmare. Good was first staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Donmar Warehouse in September 1981, with Alan Howard winning both the Evening Standard Award and the Plays and Players Best Actor awards. The play is frequently revived; in March 1999, also at the Donmar Warehouse, Charles Dance was in the leading role. Film and television versions of his plays *In 1989, playwright Jack Rosenthal made a posthumous adaptation for television of And a Nightingale Sang. This Tyne Tees Television production, starring Joan Plowright, Phyllis Logan, John Woodvine, Stephen Tompkinson and Tom Watt, won a Prix Europa in 1990. *In 2008, Good was released as a feature film, with Viggo Mortensen in the role of Halder and Jason Isaacs playing his Jewish friend Gl√ºckstein.

In developing the concept of \\"individual psychology\\" Adler broke away from the psychoanalytic school of Sigmund Freud.(Dinkmeyer, Pew, & Dinkmeyer, 1979)Eric Berne, A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis (1976) p. 277-8 In this development, Adler did call his work \\"free psychoanalysis\\" for a time, but he later rejected the label of \\"psychoanalyst\\" (Hoffman, 1994). His method, involving a holistic approach to the study of character (Mosak & DiPietro, 2006), has been extremely influential in later 20th century counselling and psychiatric strategies (Oberst & Stewart, 2003). The term \\"individual psychology\\" () does not mean to focus on the individual. Adler said one must take into account the patient's whole environment, including the people the patient associates with. The term \\"individual\\" is used to mean the patient is an indivisible whole. Adler's psychology Adler shifted the grounds of psychological determinance from sex and libido, the Freudian standpoint, to one based on the individual evaluation of world. He gave special prominence to societal factors. According to him, a person has to combat or confront three forces: societal, love-related, and vocational forces. These confrontations determine the final nature of a personality. Adler based his theories on the pre-adulthood development of a person. He laid stress on such areas as hated children, physical deformities at birth, birth order, etc. Adler's theory has similarities with the humanistic psychology of Abraham Maslow, who acknowledged Adler's influence on his own theories. Both maintain that the individual human being is the best determinant of his or her own needs, desires, interests, and growth. =The theory of compensation, resignation and over-compensation= According to Adler, humans are primarily motivated by an inferiority complex. In his view, an individual derives his or her personality traits from external factors that arise out of drive for superiority. The character of the individual is formed by his or her responses to their influence in the following ways: Compensation Compensation is a tendency to make up for underdevelopment or inferiority of physical or mental functioning through interest and training, usually within a relatively normal range of development. Neurosis and other pathological states reveal the safe-guarding or defensive strategems (largely unconscious or out of awareness) of the individual who believes her- or himself to be unequal to the demands of life, in a struggle to compensate for a felt weakness, physical or psychological.Adler, Understanding p. 40 In \\"normal\\" development, the child has experienced encouragement and accepts that her or his problems can be overcome in time by an investment of patient persistence and cooperation with others. The \\"normal\\" person feels a full member of life, and has \\"the courage to be imperfect\\" (Sofie Lazarsfeld). In less fortunate circumstances, the child, trapped within a sense of inferiority, compensates - or overcompensates, perhaps in grandiose fashionAdler, Understanding p. 70-1 \\\\- by striving, consciously and unconsciously, to overcome and solve the problems of life, moving \\"from a felt minus to a felt plus\\". A high level of compensation produces subsequent psychological difficulties.Lake, p. 6 Resignation There are those who give in to their disadvantages and become reconciled to them. Such people are in the majority. The attitude of the world towards them is of a cool, rather uninterested sympathy. Over- compensation Over-compensation reflects a more powerful impulse to gain an extra margin of development, frequently beyond the normal range. This may take a useful direction toward exceptional achievement, as the stutterer Demosthenes became an outstanding orator,Brian Lake, 'Adler, Alfred', in Gregory ed., p. 5 or a useless direction toward excessive perfectionism. Genius may result from extraordinary over-compensation. Under-compensation reflects a less active, even passive attitude toward development that usually places excessive expectations and demands on other people. There are some persons who become so infatuated with the idea of compensating for their disadvantages that they end up over-indulging in the pursuit. These are the neurotics. Thus, the external factors are vital in character formation. =Primary and secondary feelings of inferiority= The primary feeling of inferiority is the original and normal feeling in the infant and child of smallness, weakness, and dependency: appreciation of this fact was a fundamental element in Adler's thinking, and an important part of his break with Sigmund Freud.'Inferiority Complex', in Richard Gregory ed., The Oxford Companion to the Mind (1987) p. 368 An inferiority feeling usually acts as an incentive for development. However, a child may develop an exaggerated feeling of inferiority as a result of physiological difficulties or handicaps, inappropriate parenting (including abuse, neglect, over-pampering), or cultural and/or economic obstacles. The secondary inferiority feeling is the adult's feeling of insufficiency that results from having adopted an unrealistically high or impossible compensatory goal, often one of perfection. The degree of distress is proportional to the subjective or felt distance from that goal. In addition to this distress, the residue of the original, primary feeling of inferiority may still haunt an adult. An inferiority complex is an extreme expectation that one will fail in the tasks of life that can lead to pessimistic resignation and an assumed inability to overcome difficulties. =Feeling of community= Translated variably from the German, Gemeinschaftsgefuehl can mean community feeling, social interest, social feeling or social sense. Feeling of community is a recognition and acceptance of the interconnectedness of all people, experienced on affective, cognitive, and behavioral levels; and was increasingly emphasised in Adler's later writings.A. Adler et al, Superiority and Social Interest: A Collection of Later Writings (1964) p. 38 At the affective level, it is experienced as a deep feeling of belonging to the human race and empathy with fellow men and women. At the cognitive level, it is experienced as a recognition of interdependence with others, i.e., that the welfare of any one individual ultimately depends on the welfare of everyone. At the behavioral level, these thoughts and feelings can then be translated into actions aimed at self- development as well as cooperative and helpful movements directed toward others. Thus, at its heart the concept of \\"feeling of community\\" encompasses individuals' full development of their capacities, a process that is both personally fulfilling and results in people who have something worthwhile to contribute to one another. =Withdrawal= In cases of discouragement the individual, feeling unable to unfold a real and socially valid development, erects a fantasy of superiority - what Adler termed \\"an attempt at a planned final compensation and a (secret) life plan\\"Adler, quoted in Eric Berne, What Do You Say After You Say Hello? (1974) p. 58 \\\\- in some backwater of life, which offers seclusion and shelter from the threat of failure and annihilation of personal prestige. This fictional world, sustained by the need to safeguard an anxious ego, by private logic at variance with reason or common sense, by a schema of apperception which interprets and filters and suppresses the real- world data, is a fragile bubbleAdler, Understanding p. 188-9 waiting to be burst by mounting tension within and by assaults from the real world.Ellenberger, p. 608 The will to be or become has been replaced by the will to seem. =Holism= Central to the Adlerian approach is to see the personality as a whole and not as the mere net result of component forces. Thus the term individual (indivisible) psychology.J. & E. Sommers-Flanagan, Counselling and Psychotherapy Theories in Context and Practice (2012) p. 82 Adlerians adopt a radical stance that cuts across the nature-nurture debate by seeing the developing individual at work in creating the personality in response to the demands of nature and nurture but not absolutely determined by them. The self-created personality operates subjectively and idiosyncratically. The individual is endowed with a striving both for self- development and social meaning - what Adler himself called \\"the concept of social usefulness and the general well-being of humanity\\"Alfred Adler, Understanding Human Nature (1992) p. 141 \\\\- expressed in a sense of belonging, usefulness and contribution, and even cosmic consciousness.Henri F. Ellenberger, The Discovery of the Unconscious (1970) p. 609 Classical Adlerian psychology today Classical Adlerian psychology is also a contemporary Adlerian movement claiming (in quasi-polemical fashion) to preserve the genuine values of Adler's work in the present age.'Classical Adlerian Individual Psychology: Alfred Adler's Original Approach' The contemporary movement describes itself as a values-based, fully integrated theory of personality, model of psychopathology, philosophy of living, strategy for preventative education, and technique of psychotherapy, involving both depth psychology and an appreciation of practical, democratic principles in daily life.'Adlerian psychology' Its mission is to encourage the development of psychologically healthy and cooperative individuals, couples, and families in order to effectively pursue the ideals of social equality and democratic living. Henri Ellenberger wrote in the seventies of \\"the slow and continuous penetration of Adlerian insights into contemporary psychological thinking\\".Henri F. Ellenberger, The Discovery of the Unconscious (1970) p. 644 Adlerians continue to flourish in the 21st century, some employing an eclectic technique integrating elements of other therapies, from the psychodynamic to the cognitive, others focusing on a more classical approach.Frew/Spiegler, p. 93-4 With a solid foundation in the original teachings and therapeutic style of Alfred Adler, the movement today integrates several resources: the contributions of Kurt Adler, Alexander M√ºller, Lydia Sicher, Sophia de Vries, and Anthony Bruck; the self-actualization research of Abraham Maslow, himself mentored by Adler;U. E. Oberst/A. E. Stuart, Adlerian Psychotherapy (2003) p. 130-1 and the creative innovations of Henry Stein. 'Classical Adlerian Individual Psychology: Alfred Adler's Original Approach' =Striving for significance= The basic, common movement of every human being is, from birth until death, of overcoming, expansion, growth, completion, and security. This may take a negative turn into a striving for superiority or power over other people. Unfortunately, many reference works mistakenly refer only to the negative \\"striving for power\\"Compare e.g. Ernest Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (1964) p. 400 as Adler's basic premise. =Style of life= A concept reflecting the organization of the personality, including the meaning individuals give to the world and to themselves, their fictional final goal, and the affective, cognitive, and behavioral strategies they employ to reach the goal: it may be normal or neurotic.Lake, p. 6 This style is also viewed in the context of the individual's approach to or avoidance of the four tasks of life: other people, work, love and sex. =Fictional final goal= Classical Adlerian Psychology assumes a central personality dynamic reflecting the growth and forward movement of life, reflecting the influence on Adler of Vaihinger's concept of fictions.Lake, p. 6 It is a future-oriented striving toward an ideal goal of significance, superiority, success or completion: what Adler himself called \\"an attempt at a planned final compensation and a (secret) life plan\\".Adler, quoted in Eric Berne, What Do You Say After You Say Hello? (1974) p. 58 The early childhood feeling of inferiority, for which one aims to compensate, leads to the creation of a fictional final goal which subjectively seems to promise total relief from the feeling of inferiority, future security, and success. The depth of the inferior feeling usually determines the height of the goal which then becomes the \\"final cause\\" of behavior patterns. =Unity of the personality= The position that all of the cognitive, affective, and behavioral facets of the individual are viewed as components of an integrated whole, moving in one psychological direction, without internal contradictions or conflicts. Gerald Corey (2012) stated in his book, Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy, that personality can only be understood holistically/systemically. The individual is an indivisible whole, born, reared, and living in specific familial, social, and cultural contexts. In a recent interview with the Journal of Individual Psychology, Jane Griffith said, \\"The holistic character of thought is in Adler's choice of the term Individual Psychology. It's one word in German, Individualpsychologie: indivisible. Not to be chopped into bits. Adler also thought that not only is the individual not to be divided up, he's not to be seen as apart from his context either. He said that you can't examine an isolated individual.\\" =Private logic (vs. common sense)= Private logic is the reasoning invented by an individual to stimulate and justify a style of life. By contrast, common sense represents society's cumulative, consensual reasoning that recognizes the wisdom of mutual benefit. Harold Mosak in 1995 described Five Basic Mistakes: * Overgeneralizations * False or Impossible Goals * Misperceptions of Life and Life's Demands * Denial of One's Basic Worth * Faulty Values =Safeguarding tendency= Cognitive and behavioral strategies used to avoid or excuse oneself from imagined failure. They can take the form of symptoms‚Äîsuch as anxiety, phobias, or depression‚Äîwhich can all be used as excuses for avoiding the tasks of life and transferring responsibility to others. They can also take the form of aggression or withdrawal. Aggressive safeguarding strategies include deprecation, accusations, or self-accusations and guilt, which are used as means for elevating a fragile self-esteem and safeguarding an overblown, idealized image of oneself. Withdrawal takes various forms of physical, mental, and emotional distancing from seemingly threatening people and problems. =Psychology of use (vs. possession)= The perspective that an individual uses his thinking, feeling, and actions (even his symptoms) to achieve a social end. He does not merely inherit or possess certain qualities, traits, or attitudes, but adopts only those characteristics that serve his goal, and rejects those that do not fit his intentions. This assumption emphasizes personal responsibility for one's character. Classical Adlerian psychotherapy Classical Adlerian psychotherapy may involve individual psychotherapy, couple therapy, or family therapy, brief or lengthier therapy ‚Äì but all such approaches follow parallel paths, which are rooted in the individual psychology of Adler.Stein, H.T. and Edwards, M.E., 2003. Classical Adlerian Psychotherapy. HERSEN, M. SLEDGE, WH, The Encyclopedia of Psychotherapy, 1, p.4. Adler's therapy involved identifying an individual's private life plan, explaining its self-defeating, useless and predictable aspects, and encouraging a shift of interest towards social and communal goals.Brian Lake, 'Alfred Adler' in Richard Gregory ed., The Oxford Companion to the Mind (1987) p. 6 Among the specific techniques used were paradoxes, humorous or historical examples, analysis of the self- protective role of symptoms, and reduction of transference by encouraging self-responsibility.Lake, p. 6 Adler also favoured what has been called 'prescribing the symptom' ‚Äì a form of anti-suggestion aimed at making the client's self-defeating behavior less attractive to them.Gerald Corey, Theory and Practice of Counselling and Psychotherapy (1991) p. 155 Based on a growth model of the mind, Adler's approach aimed at fostering social interest,U. E. Oberst/A. E. Stuart, Adlerian Psychotherapy (2003) p. 37 and p. 47 and reducing repetitive life styles based on archaic private logic.Alfred Adler, Understanding Human Nature (1992) p. 231 With its emphasis on reasoning with the patient,Eric Berne, A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis (1976) p. 278 classical Adlerian therapy has affinities with the later approach of cognitive behavioral therapy. At the heart of Adlerian psychotherapy is the process of encouragement,J. Frew/M. D. D. Spiegler, Contemporary Psychotherapies for a Diverse World (2012) p. 116 grounded in the feeling of universal cohumanity and the belief in the as yet slumbering potential of the patient or client. By making the patient aware of their secret life plan, the therapist is able to offer an alternative outlook better adapted to the wider world of social interests.Ellenberger, p. 620 This process of encouragement also makes the Adlerian approach so valuable to all those professions that concern themselves with the development and education of children - therapeutic education being one of Adler's central concerns.Ellenberger, p. 621-2 =Goals/overview= Adlerian psychotherapy is unique in the sense that each client has their own individual type of therapy. The therapy, however, is created by the therapist on a six-phase process. The overall goal of the therapy is to establish a relationship between client and community in order not only to challenge the client's unhealthy and unrealistic thoughts of the world, but also to challenge them to replace self- defeating behaviors for ones that will lead to a more positive and healthy lifestyle.Encyclopedia of Psychotherapy, San Diego, 2002. The stages of this classical psychotherapy are: *Phase 1: This stage focuses on support and is broken down into two stages. The first stage emphasizes empathy and relationships. The therapist provides warmth, acceptance, and generate hope while giving reassurance and encouragement to the client. The second stage in this phase is focused on gathering information on the client. Early childhood memories and influences are sought out as well as details that provide information on how the client faces life problems. *Phase 2: The primary focus in phase two is on encouragement. This is done through two stages of clarification and encouragement. Therapists clarify any vague thinking with Socratic questioning and evaluate the consequences of various actions or ideas. They help the client correct inappropriate ideas about his or her self and others. They also help the client create alternative ways of thinking to move his/her life into a new direction while clarifying feelings. *Phase 3: Insight is the headline for phase 3. Interpretation and recognition, as well as knowing are the focus of the Insight phase. The client will learn to interpret his/her feelings and goals as well as identify what s/he has avoided in the past. This stage integrates many Freudian ideas such as dreams, daydreams, and recollections. The Knowing stage is where the client is now fully aware of his/her lifestyle and does not require any additional help with this. They know and accept what they need to change. *Phase 4: The fourth phase is all about change. Change is first addressed through the stage of an Emotional Breakthrough. This can be achieved through the use of role playing, guided imagery and narration. The next stage is Doing Differently. The client will break old patterns and change their attitude. This is achieved through creating steps which are based on abstract ideas. The last stage in this phase is Reinforcement. The therapist will encourage all efforts made by the client to promote change. They will reward and affirm positive feelings and changes while simultaneously evaluating the progress made by the client. *Phase 5: The final phase is about Challenge. The client goes through a first stage which is characterized by social interest. S/he is instructed to give 100% in all relationships and is encouraged to take risks. S/he is required to extend new feelings of cooperation and empathy to others. Then, through goal redirection, the client is challenged to release his/her old self and open a new self and live by these new values. The last and final stage is focused on support and launching. The therapist will inspire the client to enjoy the unfamiliar, strengthen their feelings of connectedness to others, and to continue self growth.Stages of Classical Adlerian Psychology, additional text. *Phase 6: The Meta-Therapy phase is for clients who have gone through Alder's therapy, readjusted their lives to better suit their goals, and who are making progress in becoming who they want to be. This ending part of the therapy advises clients to find out what aspects of life are truly important to them, and to pursue these \\"higher values\\". The Socratic method is aimed to guide clients to clarify feelings and meanings, gain insight to intentions and consequences and to consider alternative options. Guided imagery helps bring awareness, change and growth. Role playing encourages new behaviors and gives the client practice in how to manage conflict and other challenges. =Uses=Individual The basic structure of individual therapy in classical Adlerian psychotherapy is broken down into 5 phases plus a post-therapy follow up, and each phase is broken down into multiple stages, 13 total. Each of these stages has different goals for the client and therapist to accomplish. This is the type of therapy classical Adlerian psychotherapy was designed for. Teacher-education programs Teacher-education programs have been designed to increase child cooperation in classrooms. Teachers, parents, and school administrators attend these programs and learn techniques to increase their own teaching effectiveness in the classroom as well as how to learn to better handle children. These programs are taught in the same manner that marital programs are taught. Couple-enrichment programs Similar to group couple counseling, couple-enrichment programs are conducted by trained professionals and have groups of couples (typically about 10) attend and learn how to improve and enrich their relationships. Many different teaching formats are used that include tools such as role playing, the viewing of videos, and the implementation of other psycho-social exercises. Sessions run for about an hour's time. Parent and family education programs These programs are comparable to classes taught by family life educators. The programs focus on building better family relationships. Contemporary techniques There are two main contemporary schools of Adlerian psychotherapy, those following Rudolf Dreikurs, and those calling themselves by contrast classical Adlerians. There are many organizations that write about and still practice this psychology (The North American Society of Aldlerian Psychology (NASAP), The Journal of Individual Psychology, the International Associate of Individual Psychology (IAIP), the International Congress of Adlerian Summer Schools and Institutes (ICASSI), and various other organizations). Many universities around the world offer postgraduate training in Adlerian psychology. This psychotherapy is growing and is steadily and increasingly being assimilated into mainstream psychotherapy. There is a debate among contemporary Adlerians over the relative roles of belongingness and superiority in determining character, the school associated with Rudolf Dreikurs emphasising the former, as opposed to the classical Adlerian theorists.Paul R. Rasmussen, The Quest to Feel Good (2010) p. 44 =Dreikurs= Rudolf Dreikurs is a psychiatrist who studied under Adler in Vienna. While Adler's work was very popular and received well by American audiences, it lost popularity after his death. Dreikurs revived Adler psychotherapy after Adler's death. Building on Adler's writings, Dreikurs conceptualised a four-stage approach to Adlerian psychotherapy: # Establishing the therapeutic relationship. # Assessing the client's life style. # Promoting the client's insight into their fictive goal. # Encouraging clients to broaden their interests from the defensive function of a private logic into a broader sense of community.U. E. Oberst/A. E. Stuart, Adlerian Psychotherapy (2003) p. 49 =Classical Adlerian psychologists= Adlerian pertains to the theory and practice of Alfred Adler (1870 - 1937), the founder of individual psychology(Individualpsychologie).Brian Lake, 'Adler, Alfred', in Richard Gregory ed., The Oxford Companion to the Mind (1987) p. 5-7 Adlerian clients are encouraged to overcome their feelings of insecurity, develop deeper feelings of connectedness, and to redirect their striving for significance into more socially beneficial directions. Through a respectful Socratic dialogue,Henry T. Stein, 'Stages of Classical Adlerian Psychotherapy' they are challenged to correct mistaken assumptions, attitudes, behaviors and feelings about themselves and the world. Constant encouragement stimulates clients to attempt what was previously felt as impossible. The growth of confidence, pride, and gratification leads to a greater desire and ability to cooperate. The ultimate objective of classical Adlerian psychotherapy is to replace exaggerated self-protection (safeguarding), self-enhancement and self- indulgence, with greater self-knowledge and genuine, courageous social feelings.Adler, p. 139-42 Notable Adlerians include: History Alfred Alder Alfred Adler was greatly influenced by early socialism and Freud. This can be seen in his early work and theories. He emphasized that individuals themselves can change their lives. Adler and Freud respected one another; however, Adler did not fully agree or accept Freud's theories. Adler believed childhood experiences have influences on people's current problems, but he also did not believe they are the only contributions. He also emphasizes free will and an inborn drive as contributors to current problems people face. He doesn't believe individuals are victims of their past experiences. =Biography= \\"Alfred Adler was born to a Jewish family on February 7th, 1870 in the outskirts of Vienna. He was the second oldest child of six. He was often sick as a child, and once he became knowledgeable of death, he decided to become a physician some day. Adler's childhood sickness made him appear weak and inferior. A teacher recommended that he quit school to become an apprentice shoemaker. Adler's family objected to this and Alfred eventually went to medical school and graduated from the University of Vienna with his medical degree specializing in ophthalmology. Alfred met his future wife, Raissa Timofeyewna Epstein, in a series of political meetings which revolved around the current rising socialist movement. The two were married in 1897 Adler started a private practice which slowly switched to internal medicine. It was here that he observed that many of his patients had diseases that could be traced to social situation origins. Adler's first publication discussed how the social conditions of where people worked influenced diseases and disease processes.\\" =Career= Early in his career, Adler was focused on public health, medical and psychological prevention, and social welfare. Later on he shifted towards children at risk, women's rights, adult education, teacher training, community mental health, family counseling and education, and briefly psychotherapy. Adler started a group: The Group for Free Psychoanalytic Research, which was later changed to Individual Psychology, with individual meaning \\"indivisible\\". With this he also founded his own journal. This is when classical Adlerian psychotherapy began. Adler focused on psychoanalysis when he started his own group, even working in his private practice as a psychiatrist, but that did not last long. After World War I he turned to community and social orientation. He was known as a psychoanalyst before World War I. After the war, he was more of a philosopher, social psychologist, and educator.Primer of Adlerian Psychology: The Analytic ‚Äì Behavioral ‚Äì Cognitive Psychology of Alfred Alder, Brunner-Routledge, 1999. =Components= Adler had many areas of focus, but there are some key components that contributed to classical Adlerian psychotherapy (a.k.a. individual psychology). Children are born with an inborn force, which enables people to make their own decision, and develop their own opinions. He stated that individuals aren't just a product of their situations; they are creators of their situations. A person's feelings, beliefs and behaviors all work together to make each individual unique. Another area of focus on was the concept of fictions. It is believed that fictions are conscious and non- conscious ideas that are not necessarily aligned with reality, but serve as a guide to cope with reality. People create fictions as ways of seeing themselves, others around them and their environments and that people do this to guide their feelings, thoughts, and actions. Another concept is finality. This is the belief that there is only one organized force, a fictionate final goal. Fictionate final goal has been established in early childhood and is present for the rest of a person's life. It is mostly unconscious and influences behavior. With fictionate final goal, questions are asked more along the lines of \\"what for\\" or \\"where to\\" instead of \\"why\\" or \\"where from\\". The goal and purpose of a behavior is looked at instead of finding the cause of a behavior. The final cause of the behavior is the focus, which is where fictionate final goal is termed. Social interest is another area that contributes to classical Adlerian psychotherapy. He believes individuals are social beings. The way an individual acts with other people is greatly important in terms of their psychological health. Social interest means feeling a part of a family, group or community. An important concept related to social interest is the ability to feel empathy. Showing empathy is a way to connect with others.

Early life Satyananda was born Samuel Evans Stokes, Jr., in an American Quaker family. His father, a very successful businessman, was the founder of the Stokes and Parish Machine Company which was a leading manufacturer of elevators in the USA. The Young Samuel did not acquire any professional skill as he was not interested in business. Nevertheless, his father made many efforts to involve him in running the business but Samuel was not interested as he believed in doing greater good in life. Since the family was wealthy, they provided for his needs. In 1904, aged 22, Samuel came to India to work at a leper colony located at Subathu in the Shimla. His parents were opposed to this move, but he did it anyway because it was a job where he felt happy and satisfied. India was also far away from his parents and other people who looked down on him for not taking over his family business with eagerness. The lepers needed him and adored him and the other local people treated him with great respect because he was a foreign man doing a pious job. Once his parents realized that this job fulfilled some deep emotional need of their son, they supplied him with considerable money, which he used both for the leper colony and for helping local villagers in small ways, all of which further enhanced his respectability. Raised a Quaker, Samuel was drawn to the asceticism that is exalted in Indian spirituality and began living a simple, frugal life among the villagers, becoming a sort of Christian Sannyasi. A few years later, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was visiting the Viceroy at Shimla (the summer capital of the British Raj) heard of the leper colony and was impressed. He encouraged Samuel to form an order of Franciscan Friars, an order of monkhood committed to living in poverty and aiding the diseased and dying. Samuel formed such an order, but his membership in this wandering brotherhood of monks lasted only two years. In 1912, Samuel married a local Rajput girl, gave up his life of poverty, purchased a chunk of farmland near his wife's village and settled there. His wife, Agnes, was the daughter of a first generation Rajput Christian. Samuel's father had settled a considerable fortune upon Samuel, and the purchasing power of this inheritance was magnified manifold in the remote, beautiful part of India where he settled. He had also by now dealt with the demons of failure that had plagued his growing years, and as a white man in an uncritical rural society, in the company of an Indian wife who was non-judgmental and made few demands on his, Samuel was happier than he had ever been before. The family grew with the birth of five children. Stokes was a critic of the Christ myth theory.Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence. Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans. Footnote 28. p. 13. He authored the book The Historical Character of the Gospel published by the Christian Literature Society for India, Madras. It was republished in London as The Gospel According to Jews and Pagans (1913). He argued for the historicity of Jesus and his crucifixion.Sharma, Asha. (2008). An American in Gandhi's India: The Biography of Satyanand Stokes. Indiana University Press. p. 57. Samuel applied himself to improving the farmland he had purchased and was able to access scholarly resources unknown to the other villagers in this endeavour. He identified a new strain of apples developed by the Stark brothers of Louisiana, United States as being suitable to the Simla Hills and began cultivating them on his farm. This was in the year 1916. The resulting bumper crops, coupled with Samuel's access to the white people who ran the export business in Delhi encouraged the other farmers to do as Samuel was doing, and he helped them wholeheartedly in every way. Indeed, he purchased more land and devoted it to growing apple cultivars which the villagers would use to seed their own farms. The local economy was vastly reinvigorating. This happy idyll was shattered with the loss of his son Tara to amoebic dysentery. He moved closer to Hinduism and a few years later in 1932 he converted to Hinduism, taking the name \\"Satyananda\\" while his wife Agnes changed her name to \\"Priyadevi\\".The Pacific Historical review https://www.jstor.org/stable/3640095?seq=20 Stokes' decision to convert to Hinduism was painful for his wife Agnes because it would cut her off from those she loved but she was prepared to follow the rest of the family through the painful readjustment. Stokes had always had a strong sense of social justice and later became active in India's freedom struggle for independence from Great Britain.Fit to Post:Satyananda Stokes http://in.yfittopostblog.com/tag/satyananda-stokes/ Stokes had the rare honour of being the only American to become a member of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) of the Indian National Congress. Along with Lala Lajpat Rai, he represented Punjab. He was the only non-Indian to sign the Congress manifesto in 1921, calling upon Indians to quit government service. He was jailed for sedition and promoting hatred against the British government in 1921, becoming the only American to become a political prisoner of Great Britain in the freedom struggle. On Stokes‚Äô arrest, Mahatma Gandhi wrote: \\"That he (Stokes) should feel with and like an Indian, share his sorrows and throw himself into the struggle, has proved too much for the government. To leave him free to criticise the government was intolerable, so his white skin has proved no protection for him‚Ä¶\\" He died on 14 May 1946 after an extended illness shortly before Indian independence.

It came against England in 2000 when he had the difficult task of filling the gap left by the Azzurri prop and captain Massimo Cuttitta. He was named in the BBC's dream XV at the 2004 Six Nations Championship and was part of the Barbarians squad to take on New Zealand later that year. Lo Cicero was the only European player to receive a call, and he capped the feat by scoring a try. In 2005 he again represented the Barbarians for their matches against Scotland and England. In the 2007 Six Nations Championship, he celebrated his 50th appearance in the Six Nations with a thumping 37‚Äì17 victory over Scotland at Murrayfield, Italy's first away victory in the tournament. Lo Cicero won his 100th cap for Italy against Scotland in the 2013 Six Nations tournament and his 101st in the match against Wales, equalling Alessandro Troncon's record as Italy's most-capped player, breaking that record against England.

These issues are due in large part to Kazakhstan's years under the Soviet Union. Partly because of the country's enormous semi-arid steppe, the Soviet government used Kazakhstan as its nuclear testing site. Along with near-absent pollution controls, this has contributed to an alarmingly high rate of disease in many rural areas. Kazakhstan has identified at least two major ecological disasters within its borders: the shrinking of the Aral Sea, and radioactive contamination at the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing facility (in fact a large zone south of Kourchatov (–ö—É—Ä—á–∞—Ç–æ–≤)) and along the Chinese border. The Central Asian Regional Environmental Center is located in Kazakhstan, which fosters regional cooperation on environmental issues. Most of Kazakhstan‚Äôs water supply has been polluted by industrial and agricultural runoff and, in some places, radioactivity. The Aral Sea, which is shared with Uzbekistan, has shrunk to three separate bodies of water because of water drawdowns in its tributary rivers. A Soviet-era biological weapons site is a threat because it is located on a former island in the Aral Sea that is now connected with the mainland. The reduction in the Aral Sea‚Äôs water surface has exacerbated regional climatic extremes, and agricultural soil has been damaged by salt deposits and eroded by wind. Desertification has eliminated substantial tracts of agricultural land. Plants in industrial centers lack controls on effluents into the air and water. The Semey region in the northeast has long-term radiation contamination from Soviet-era weapons testing. The Ministry of Environmental Protection is underfunded and given low priority. Some new environmental regulation of the oil industry began in 2003, but new oil operations on Kazakhstan‚Äôs Caspian coast add to that sea‚Äôs already grave pollution. International programs to save the Aral and Caspian seas have not received meaningful cooperation from Kazakhstan or other member nations. Aral Sea The Aral Sea covers with Kazakhstan to the north and Uzbekistan to the south. Soviet irrigation projects begun in the 1960s and other environmental challenges have severely depleted this once massive inland sea and by 2007, it had shrunk to 10 percent of its original size. Efforts to revive the Aral Sea The efforts included Syr Darya Control & Northern Aral Sea (NAS) project. The $86 million NAS project, funded jointly by the World Bank through a loan of $65 million and the Government of Kazakhstan which covered the rest, was designed to mitigate the environmental and economic damage to the region, sustain and increase agriculture and fishing in the Syr Darya basin and secure the continued existence of the Northern Aral Sea (also known as the Small Sea) by improving environmental and ecological conditions in the delta area. In addition, three revival programs were designed for implementation in the Aral Sea Basin (ASBP 1, ASBP 2 and ASBP 3). The most detailed and comprehensive of these, ASBP 3, covers the 2011-2015 period and was developed during Kazakhstan‚Äôs presidency of the executive committee of IFAS.

Bisha was its own province before merging with its neighboring province, 'Asir. Bisha has a population of 205,346 according to the 2010 Census, with nearly 240 villages and 58 larger settlements that are spread out on both sides of the Bisha Valley (the longest valley in the Arabian Peninsula). The city is located to the south of the Arabian Peninsula, which is almost entirely under the administration of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It stands at an altitude of approximately 610 meters (2,000 ft.) above sea level. Agriculture The Bisha area is of immense agricultural importance due to high soil fertility, abundant water, and palm cultivation. There are around 3,000,000 palm trees, among other trees of multiple varieties, and their fruits are sold widely to cities in the vicinity. Ibn Saud then set out to conquer the surrounding region with the goal of bringing it under the rule of a single Islamic state. Ibn Dawwas of Riyadh led the most determined resistance, allied with forces from Al Kharj, Al Ahsa, and the Banu Yam clan of Najran. However, Ibn Dawwas fled and Riyadh capitulated to the Saudis in 1774, ending long years of wars, and leading to the declaration of the first Saudi State, with Riyadh as its capital. The government of Saudi Arabia's strategic plan involves using a newly constructed dam to supply water to population centers rather than to irrigate farms. The Ministry of Agriculture and Water was concerned about the Bisha area's dependence on groundwater and initially decided to construct a dam in the Bisha Valley (King Fahad Dam) to support agricultural activities in the region. However, due to the scarcity of clean drinking water, the dam output has been redirected for drinking purposes, resulting in a sharp decline of agricultural output. And if Saudis wake up to the use of drip irrigation and moisture Agriculture techniques in this misty region, they will be able to produce vegetables and herbs for the local population.

It was organized in 1927 by suspended former members of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) following an intrasynodical controversy. It currently consists of six churches and their churchworkers in Wisconsin, Michigan, and California. It is a conservative, confessional Lutheran Christian group with German immigrant roots. It publishes the periodical Faith-Life as a conference, and operates the Protes'tant Conference website. It does not consider itself as a denomination or a church body, but a loose association of churchworkers and independent congregations. Orthography The organization's name includes a single typewriter quotation mark after the second syllable of the word ‚ÄúProtestant,‚Äù indicating an accent thereon.  History  The Protes'tant Conference arose out of a controversy over a document known as the Beitz Paper (written by then WELS pastor W. F. Beitz) inside the WELS in 1926-1927\\\\. In his paper, Pastor Beitz discussed the current doctrinal philosophy then prevalent in the synod. Debate arose over the theological nature of the document and about 40 supporters of Pastor Beitz were subsequently suspended from the WELS as a result. These pastors, teachers, and some congregations organized into the non-centralized Protes'tant Conference. It has undergone three schisms, in 1930, 1952, and 1964. Internally, the Protes'tant Conference sometimes refers to itself as The Protes'tant Conference of the Wisconsin Synod. The name \\"Protes'tant\\" was adopted in 1929, on the 400 year anniversary of the Second Diet of Speyer. (The Second Diet of Speyer resulted in the adoption of the name \\"Protestant\\" against this Holy Roman Imperial decision to outlaw the Lutherans.) The name \\"Protes'tant\\" was chosen to signify their protest against \\"synodicalism\\" on the part of both the Wisconsin and Missouri Synods. While the Missouri Synod did not expel the Protes'tants, it synodically ratified the expulsions in 1927. Hensel, Ph.: \\"A Brief History of the Protes'tant Controversy\\", Faith-Life, 73(6):5. Core beliefs The Protes'tant Conference teaches that the Bible is the only authoritative and error-free source for doctrine. It subscribes to the Lutheran Confessions (the Book of Concord) not in-so-far-as but because it is an accurate presentation of what Scripture teaches. It teaches that Jesus is the center of Scripture and the only way to eternal salvation, and that the Holy Spirit uses the gospel alone in Word and Sacraments (Baptism and Holy Communion) to bring people to faith in Jesus as Savior and keep them in that faith, strengthening them in their daily life of sanctification.

It consisted of the offender being forced to stand on the narrow flat top of a peg for a period of time. The punishment died out in the 18th century and was so unfamiliar by 1800 that when the then governor of Trinidad, Sir Thomas Picton, ordered Luisa Calderon, a woman of European and African ancestry to be so punished, he was accused by public opinion in England of inflicting a torture akin to impalement. It was thought erroneously that the prisoner was forced to stand on the head of a pointed stake, and this error was repeated in the New English Dictionary. The punishment required placing a wooden peg (for the sort used for tents or for a line for cavalry horses ‚Äî \\"picket\\" etc. were originally alternative names for such pegs) in the ground with the exposed end facing upward. The malefactor was typically a private soldier who had disobeyed orders. One wrist was suspended from a tree by a rope, while the sole or heel of the opposite bare foot was balanced atop the peg, a piece of wood about four inches long by two inches wide and rounded at the top to about half an inch to meet the legal requirements. The top of the peg was narrow enough to cause considerable discomfort, but not sharp enough to draw blood. To relieve pressure upon a foot, the prisoner relegated all his weight to the wrist, which could only be relieved by shifting weight back onto the other foot. The procedure could be continued for a few hours, to as much as a day or two. The punishment generally did not cause lasting physical harm. A much more severe and physically damaging suspension torture is known as strappado.

The World War II story depicts events before and after the assassination of top German leader Reinhard Heydrich in Prague (Operation Anthropoid). Czech historians have called the film the historically most accurate depiction of the events surrounding Operation Anthropoid. Plot On September 27, 1941, Reinhard Heydrich, one of the most feared top officials of the Nazi Party, an architect of the Holocaust and Hitler's possible successor, is appointed \\"Reichsprotektor\\" of Bohemia and Moravia. As a result of his brutality and oppression he is also called \\"The Butcher of Prague\\" or \\"The Blond Beast\\". In UK, a squad of agents is selected, trained and parachuted into Czechoslovakia. The team operated in Prague and planned the attack for about six months. The mission, Operation Anthropoid, is executed in the capital on May 27, 1942 by means of an ambush; it almost fails when one of their Sten guns jams, but Heydrich is severely wounded by a grenade. Heydrich eventually succumbs to his wounds and during the frenzied aftermath the German high command takes savage reprisals, including the massacre of 340 men, women and children of the village of Lidice and the razing of the village. The group is eventually betrayed by one of its members and they are cornered in a church crypt in Prague. In the gun-battle that follows all agents commit suicide.

He joined Viadana in 2003 and was also included in Italy's squad for the World Cup in Australia that year. He had his 2005 season disrupted by injury. In the 2008 Six Nations Championship, new coach Nick Mallett played Masi at fly-half, a role he had not played before but many experts believed this move was unsuccessful and he was moved to full- back for the start of the 2009 Six Nations Championship. In March 2011, Masi was named the 2011 Six Nations Player of the Championship. Masi scored Italy's late try in their first ever Championship win against France. In June 2011 he joined the Pro12 Italian franchise Aironi. However, the team was discontinued in 2012, and Masi moved to England to join Wasps.

After another two years as shop foreman, he found employ as production superintendent at the United Shoe Machinery Company in 1899 in Boston. The United Shoe Machinery Company, formed in 1899 out of the merger of three shoe machinery companies, developed revolutionary new shoemaking equipment, which revolutionized the shoe industry.Background & History at cummings.com.

Accessed November 2014. In 1902 Alford got promoted to mechanical engineer, and invented and patented some new constructions for the United Shoe Machinery Company. In 1907 Alford started working in engineering journalism for the Engineering Magazine company. From 1907 to 1911 he was engineering editor at the American Machinist, and from 1911 to 1917 editor-in-chief. Sequentially he was editor for the Industrial Management from 1917 to 1920, from 1921 to 1923 editor for Manufacturing Industrial Management, and from 1923 to 1928 consulting editor for the Factory and Industrial Management and vice-president of the Ronald Press Company in New York.Robert Cecil Cook. Who's who in American Education: A Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Living Educators of the United States, Volume 9. Who's Who in American Education, 1940. p. 17 Alford co-developed the theory called systematic management, and was an advocate of this management style within the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). In 1929, Herbert Hoover appointed a president's commission to investigate the current state of the economy. Alford served on this panel and was the principal co- author of the committee's report, Recent Economic Changes (1929). From 1935 to 1937 he joined the Federal Communications Commission, where he was assistant engineer-in-charge of the manufacturing costs unit. In 1937 Alford jointed the faculty of New York University, where he became chairman of the department of administrative engineering. Alford was elected fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and was its former vice-president, and fellow of the Institute of Management and its former president. He was awarded the first Melville Medal in 1927ASME Honors Manual . Accessed 14 October 2013. and in 1929 the Henry Laurence Gantt Medal from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  Work = Systematic management and scientific management = Alford was a practitioner of systematic management and an advocate of this management style within the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. This systems of management principles, partly based on the ideas of Charles Babbage, was developed together with Alexander Hamilton Church, would paved the way to modern industrial management. Their views clashed with the scientific management approach advocated by Frederick Winslow Taylor.Richard Vangermeersch (1996) \\"Church, Alexander Hamilton (1866-1936.\\" In History of Accounting: An International Encyclopedia, edited by Michael Chatfield and Richard Vangermeersch. New York: Garland Publishing, 1996. p. 124. In 1912, Alford published a critique of scientific management that undermined Taylor's claims of success. Alford argued that labor efficiency improvements at the Philadelphia plant of the Link-Belt Company were due to the personality of company's president, James Mapes Dodge. Dodge had won much respect and trust from the workers because of arrangements and incentives he offered so that they would accept Taylor's changes. Later in 1912, Alford sat on the ASME committee that considered whether or not to publish Taylor's book, The Principles of Scientific Management. Alford's criticisms of Taylor and his management techniques moderated the committee's position on the text. Because the committee's report was ambivalent about the merits of Scientific Management, the ASME declined to publish Taylor's book. = Industrial management = Alford published his own management text, Industrial Management. He advocated a reformist approach to labor and to unionism. In 1920, he co-founded the Management Division within the ASME. Alford advocated flexibility in \\"industrial relations\\" and \\"human engineering\\" and rejected fixed and rigid approaches to labor management such as scientific management. His approach to labor soon became the dominant accepted practice of corporate liberal management. Because of this approach, the Management Division soon became the largest division within the ASME.

He wrote only in the Catalan language. He was one of the founders of both the group and the publication known as Dau-al-Set (1948) and one of the leading early proponents of visual poetry in Catalan literature. Although he was in the vanguard of the post-war poets. He also wrote hundreds of formally perfect sonnets, sapphic odes and sestinas as well as thousands of free and direct poems. His creative work embraced every aspect of the arts: cinema, theatre (more of 360 pieces), music, cabaret, the para-theatrical arts, magic and the circus. Life and work For him, expression had priority over content, and he managed to give his poetry the appearance of plays on words. His lyrical work is connected with the theatre while the totality of his literature (more of 80 books, all written in the Catalan language) is impregnated with the theatrical dimension as he always employed a broad and interdisciplinary vision of culture, the arts in general and the performance arts in particular. This vision was expressed in his literary and visual works which often appeared as satirical, cutting, ironic and critical or, on other occasions, irreverent yet playful. In the latter years of his creative life, he received a number of awards such as the National Prize for the Visual Arts (1992), the National Theatre Prize (1998) and the UNESCO Picasso Medal. He has been posthumously awarded doctorate honoris causa from the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (1999). He was a member and then Honorary Member of the Associaci√≥ d'Escriptors en Llengua Catalana (Association of Catalan Language Writers).

(The other was Fort La Jonqui√®re built two years earlier.) It was originally called Fort St. Louis, and later also called Fort des Prairies, Nippeween and Fort √† la Corne. It was located downstream from the Saskatchewan River Forks at the mouth of the Pehonan Creek a mile west of the later HBC post. It was built in 1753 by Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne, the third of the four western commanders who followed La V√©rendrye. It was a fur trade post, the western end of the chain of posts that diverted furs away from the English on Hudson Bay and a base for exploration of the Saskatchewan which the French thought might lead to the Pacific. For most of its existence it was an outpost of Fort Paskoya. It was closed in 1759 with the fall of New France. The site was apparently well-chosen. In 1775 the \\"Pedlars\\" built post in the area before moving upstream to Fort Sturgeon in 1776. In 1795 the Pedlars or North West Company built a Fort St Louis on the right bank of the river immediately below Peonan Creek. About five miles upstream were three more houses possibly called Isaac's House, named after Isaac Batt, and Fort aux Trembles. In 1796 the Hudson's Bay Company built the first Carleton House a mile and a half downstream. In 1846 the Hudson's Bay Company built its Fort St. Louis a few miles from original fort. This fort became linked to the Carlton Trail by a side route called Fort √† la Corne Trail in the Saskatchewan Valley. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1926. Today the Fort √† la Corne Provincial Forest surrounds the site of the old fur trade posts. Recently diamond exploration by De Beers and ShoreGold has been occurring in the area, and speculation exists that a mine will open someday.See Cassandra Kyle, \\"Diamond site valued at 5.3 billion\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, August 28, 2009; www.thestarphoenix.com.\\"Patience, luck are key to diamond mining in Saskatchewan\\", CBC, January 20, 2014; cbc.ca.

It is one of the oldest cities in the state and still preserves vestiges of its colonial heritage. The Areias River passes through the municipality. Location and Geography Located in the micro-region of Entorno do Distrito Federal, is linked by highways BR-070 and BR-414. Important distances are: 110 km to Goi√¢nia, 45 km to An√°polis and 130 km to Bras√≠lia. Corumb√° is bounded by the following municipalities: Piren√≥polis, Cocalzinho de Goi√°s, Santo Ant√¥nio do Descoberto, Alex√¢nia and Abadi√¢nia.Sepin Anu√°rio Estat√≠stico do Estado de Goi√°s - 2005 Due to variations in elevation, temperatures are quite varied. The average is around 26 ¬∞C; The rains obey a tropical pattern and are at their strongest in the period of October to March. The municipality contains part of the Pirineus State Park, created in 1987. Nature is the tourist attraction of the municipality. The region is full of waterfalls, caverns, and rivers. The Salto de Corumb√° is known throughout the region and attracts many tourists from Bras√≠lia and Goi√¢nia. The Corumb√° River crosses the municipality and has beaches and rapids. The town is one of the oldest in the state and still preserves part of the houses from past centuries, with special notice given to the Igreja Matriz de Nossa Senhora da Penha de Fran√ßa. Corumb√°, like neighboring Piren√≥polis, receives a great number of tourists for the Festival of the Cavalhadas, which are mock battles between Moors and Christians. History The settlement of Corumb√° de Goi√°s began in 1731 when miners looked for gold at the confluence of the Corumb√° River and the Bagagem River. In 1734 a chapel was built honoring Nossa Senhora da Penha da Fran√ßa. In 1840 the town was already a parish with its first priest Manoel Inoc√™ncio da Costa Campos. In 1849 it was raised to the status of \\"vila\\" (like a municipality today) only to lose this status in 1863, becoming a district of Meia Ponte, which is today called Piren√≥polis. The Vila de Corumb√° became a city in 1902 changing its name to Corumb√° de Goi√°s because of the confusion with the more important Corumb√° in Mato Grosso. Corumb√° de Goi√°s had grown to 20,212 inhabitants in 1980 with 17,765 living in the rural area. Between 1991 and 1996 the population dropped 15% with the rural population being reduced to 4,109 inhabitants. The population continued to diminish gradually until stabilizing after 2000.Sepin S√©ries Hist√≥ricas Economy The economy is poorly developed due to isolation and is based on rural agricultural production and tourism.

Scouting in Suriname officially started in 1924 and became a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) in 1968. The coeducational association has 2,601 members (as of 2004). History On September 12, 1910, the \\"Korps Surinamese Boy Scouts\\" was established in Thalia. In 1915 the name was \\"Surinaamsche Padvinders Organisatie\\". There was no more activity, after Scouting was blamed for the drowning of 16-year-old Boy Scout, Herman Sas R√∂mer, on March 13, 1916 in the Domin√©kreek near Poelepantje. Suriname : koloniaal nieuws- en advertentieblad, Een treurig ongeval. Scouting in Suriname officially restarted on July 29, 1924, when the Surinamese district of the Vereeniging de Nederlandsche Padvinders (NPV) was officially founded in the Thalia theatre in Paramaribo. On this occasion, 107 Boy Scouts, many Cub Scouts and some girls made their Scout Promise.Dagblad Suriname, Boy Scouts 84 jaar In 1938, the Dutch Scout movement was split after a decision of the Roman Catholic episcopate into the interreligious NPV and the Katholieke Verkenners (KV). Scouting in Suriname had to follow this despite all protests, so the Katholieke Verkenners Suriname (KVS) were founded out of the Catholic members of the groups. The logo of the KVS was the same as the KV, a Fleur-de- lis for Boy Scouts, on a cross potent for Catholic Scouts. The red Jerusalem Cross with the fleur-de-lis was the symbol of the Katholieke Verkenners Suriname During World War II, the Surinamese Scouts had to stand alone, since Scouting was banned in the German occupied Netherlands. So, after the war, the Suriname district of NPV decided to found its own, nearly independent association, the Surinaamse Padvinders Vereniging (SPV), which was incorporated in 1964. SPV and KVS worked close together and received recognition by WOSM in 1968, seven years before the independence of Suriname. After four years of cooperation both association merged and formed the Boy Scouts van Suriname on April 23, 1972. The first Chief Scout was Johan Ferrier. Johan Ferrier, eerste Chief Scout Suriname In 1974, the new association hosted the 5th Caribbean Jamboree.

The biggest radio stations in the region from the late 70s to mid-80s were Raidio Luimni (8 years), www.BigLradiolimerick.com (7 years), Hits 954. (3 years) and RLWE (Radio Limerick Weekly Echo) (6 months). Other reasonably- significant radio stations in the area over the years included Independent Radio Limerick, CCR (City Centre Radio), Radio Vera, Radio Munster, SoundChannel and Mid-West Radio (a name since adopted somewhat confusingly by a legal radio station in Mayo, in the West of Ireland). Following the biggest closedown of the pirates in Ireland in 1988, and the subsequent legalisation of local radio services in the country, many people viewed that the pirate era was consigned to the past, and Limerick became home to a single government- licensed service called Radio Limerick One which ironically later had its broadcasting licence revoked only to continue operating as a pirate station (RLO) for 10 years, being constantly raided and fined, finally ceasing transmission after 10 years early 2007 as owners and engineers ventured to other projects. The inexplicable failure to offer more choice - Limerick had initially been earmarked for at least two stations - meant that inevitably a number of pirate stations reappeared, the biggest ones being Kiss FM, Radio Magic 107.6FM, Galtee Radio, Country Gold, Estuary, NCW 106, and Wave FM, which later became Galaxy 105. There were also all-too-brief appearances of Q101, Power 98FM, Club FM, Fresh 103 and Enterprise Radio In 2009 Radio-Filou has been broadcasting for a year and has catered for listeners from the alternative audience, sharing content with Rascal Radio in Galway.

He played for Ghial Calvisano, with whom he won the Italian championship in 2005. He signed a contract with Leicester Tigers, and after a successful 2006/07 season with them, was named Guinness Premiership player of the season.Guinness Premiership player of the season He wears the name \\"Castro\\" on his shirt rather than \\"Castrogiovanni\\" A native of Paran√°, Argentina, Castrogiovanni made his international debut for the Italian national team on June 8, 2002, during the tour against the All Blacks, and since, has become a regular in the national side. He played every game of Italy's 2004 Six Nations campaign and was a reliable member of their forward pack, being selected man of the match in the victory against Scotland. One of his most famous moments came in 2004, when, during the summer tour against Japan, he scored a hat-trick - a rarity for a prop forward. He led the national team for the game against Scotland during the 2012 Six Nations Championship, which Italy won 13-6, leading him to Tweet \\"Only unbeaten 6 Nations Captain\\". Castrogiovanni and Marcos Ayerza signed three-year contract extensions with the Premiership champions in January 2008. In 2011, after much speculation about a move to France, he declared \\"money isn't everything\\" and renewed his contract with Leicester Tigers, much to the relief of the Leicester, where the chant of \\"Castro\\" is heard often as he is a firm favourite of the fans. During his time at Leicester Castrogiovanni played in two victorious Premiership finals in 2010 and 2013 (the latter as a replacement). During the 2008 Six Nations Championship, Castrogiovanni was Italy's top try scorer. After seven years at Welford Road, he signed for French club Toulon for the 2013‚Äì14 season. On 10 June 2015, Castrogiovanni signed for Top 14 rivals Racing 92 from the 2015-16 season. While he helped lead Racing to their first-ever European club final in 2016, he would be suspended by Racing for that particular match. He did not play in Racing's European Rugby Champions Cup semi-final against Leicester Tigers, telling the club that he was in Argentina attending to family matters. However, he was instead spotted in Las Vegas partying with players from Parisian football club Paris Saint-Germain, including superstar Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá, with photos of the group appearing in multiple French publications. The club indicated that it would take legal action against Castrogiovanni. Personal life Castrogiovanni is co-owner of an Italian restaurant in Leicester, Timo. In October 2010 a second Timo was soon to open in Market Harborough. He speaks four languages: his native Spanish, Italian, English and French.

Phourni is Greek for \\"furnace, oven\\" and the name of the hill on which the cemetery is located. Geography Phourni can be seen from Mount Juktas. It is a small hill situated northwest of Archanes, between Archanes and Kato Archanes. Phourni is reachable from a signed scenic path that starts at Archanes. Archaeology Excavations began at Phourni in 1964 by Efi and Yannis Sakellarakis and have continued until at least 1995. The cemetery at Phourni was in use from Early Minoan II to Late Minoan IIIC - over one thousand years. A tholos tomb first discovered in 1965 dates to 14th century BCE and shares a ground plan with tholos tombs at Mycenae and Orchomenus. Early Minoan tholos tombs and ossuaries have been excavated in the south part of the cemetery. Finds include a dismembered corpse of a sacrificed horse, a bull's skull, a gold ring from a burial with a cultic scene engraved on it, knives, lead weights from a scale, 46 loom weights, a wine press, a libation table, bell-shaped figurines, approximately 250 cups, Early Minoan II seals, an Egyptian diorite vase, ivory seals and amulets and a pillar crypt. The bodies of two women found in a Late Minoan tholos tomb are of almost certain royal or religious importance due to the wealth of objects and the unusual sacrifices of a horse and a bull made to the chambers. More than twenty buildings and tombs have been excavated at Phourni. Finds excavated from Phourni are at the Heraklion Archaeological Museum.

EDC replaces the traditional paper-based data collection methodology to streamline data collection and expedite the time to market for drugs and medical devices. EDC solutions are widely adopted by pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations (CRO). Typically, EDC systems provide: * a graphical user interface component for data entry * a validation component to check user data * a reporting tool for analysis of the collected data EDC systems are used by life sciences organizations, broadly defined as the pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology industries in all aspects of clinical research, but are particularly beneficial for late-phase (phase III-IV) studies and pharmacovigilance and post-market safety surveillance. EDC can increase data accuracy and decrease the time to collect data for studies of drugs and medical devices. The trade-off that many drug developers encounter with deploying an EDC system to support their drug development is that there is a relatively high start-up process, followed by significant benefits over the duration of the trial. As a result, for an EDC to be economical the saving over the life of the trial must be greater than the set- up costs. This is often aggravated by two conditions: #that initial design of the study in EDC does not facilitate the decrease in costs over the life of the study due to poor planning or inexperience with EDC deployment; and #initial set-up costs are higher than anticipated due to initial design of the study in EDC due to poor planning or experience with EDC deployment. The net effect is to increase both the cost and risk to the study with insignificant benefits. However, with the maturation of today's EDC solutions, much of the earlier burdens for study design and set-up have been alleviated through technologies that allow for point-and-click, and drag-and-drop design modules. With little to no programming required, and reusability from global libraries and standardized forms such as CDISC's CDASH, deploying EDC can now rival the paper processes in terms of study start-up time. As a result, even the earlier phase studies have begun to adopt EDC technology. History EDC is often cited as having its origins in remote data entry (RDE) software, which surfaced in the life sciences market in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, its origins might be tracked to a contract research organization known then as Institute for Biological Research and Development (IBRD). Drs. Nichol, Pickering, and Bollert offered \\"a controlled system for post-marketing surveillance (PMS) of newly approved (NDA) pharmaceutical products,\\" with surveillance data being \\"entered into an electronic data base on site\\" at least as early as 1980. Clinical research data‚Äîpatient data collected during the investigation of a new drug or medical device is collected by physicians, nurses, and research study coordinators in medical settings (offices, hospitals, universities) throughout the world. Historically, this information was collected on paper forms which were then sent to the research sponsor (e.g., a pharmaceutical company) for data entry into a database and subsequent statistical analysis environment. However, this process had a number of shortcomings: * data are copied multiple times, which produces errors * errors that are generated are not caught until weeks later * visibility into the medical status of patients by sponsors is delayed To address these and other concerns, RDE systems were invented so that physicians, nurses, and study coordinators could enter the data directly at the medical setting. By moving data entry out of the sponsor site and into the clinic or other facility, a number of benefits could be derived: * data checks could be implemented during data entry (real-time), preventing some errors altogether and immediately prompting for resolution of other errors * data could be transmitted nightly to sponsors, thereby improving the sponsor's ability to monitor the progress and status of the research study and its patients These early RDE systems used \\"thick client\\" software‚Äîsoftware installed locally on a laptop computer's hardware‚Äîto collect the patient data. The system could then use a modem connection over an analog phone line to periodically transmit the data back to the sponsor, and to collect questions from the sponsor that the medical staff would need to answer. Though effective, RDE brought with it several shortcomings as well. The most significant shortcoming was that hardware (e.g., a laptop computer) needed to be deployed, installed, and supported at every investigational (medical) site. This became expensive for sponsors and complicated for medical staff. Usability and space constraints led to a lot of dissatisfaction among medical practitioners. With the rise of the internet in the mid-1990s, the obvious solution to some of these issues was the adoption of web-based software that could be accessed using existing computers at the investigational sites. EDC represents this new class of software. Current landscape The EDC landscape has continued to evolve from its evolution from RDE in the late 1990s. Today, the market consists of a variety of new and established software providers. Many of these providers offer specialized solutions targeting certain customer profiles or study phases. In 2005, Medrio was the first provider to offer cloud-based data storage. Modern features of EDC now include features like cloud data storage, role-based permissions, and case report form designers, as well as clinical trials analytics, interactive dashboards, and electronic medical record integration. Future In 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) introduced its eSource guidance, which suggests methods of capturing clinical trial data electronically from the very beginning and moving it to the cloud, as opposed to EDC's more traditional method of capturing data initially on paper and transcribing it into the EDC system. Adoption of eSource was initially slow, with the FDA producing a webinar in July 2015 to further promote the guidance. Efforts like the TransCelerate eSource Initiative (in 2016) have been founded \\"to facilitate the understanding of the eSource landscape and the optimal use of electronic data sources in the industry to improve global clinical science and global clinical trial execution for stakeholders.\\" A 2017 study by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development suggested that with the following three years a \\"majority of [surveyed clinical information] companies\\" (growing from 38 percent to 84 percent) planned to incorporate eSource data. With 87 percent of research sites (2017) stating that eSource would be \\"helpful\\" or \\"very helpful\\" if integrated with today's EDC, a shift away from EDC (or EDC taking a more complementary role) may be possible.

He predominantly played as an open-side flanker, although his versatility means that he had also played a number of international games on the wing, and started at scrum-half in an infamously error-prone performance. He was considered to be one of Italy's best players in his preferred position. His younger brother Mirco is also a professional rugby player. Both brothers are featured on the cover of the Italian version of the EA Sports game Rugby 08. Early life Mauro Bergamasco was born in Padua into a rugby family; his father Arturo gained four caps for the Italian national side between 1973 and 1978, whilst his brother, Mirco, has also won caps for the Italian national team. Bergamasco cites his father as the main reason for his interest in rugby: as a young boy, he would accompany his father to the training sessions of rugby club Selvazzano, the team Arturo coached. Playing career Bergamasco began his playing career with Petrarca Padova, before moving to Treviso. In 2003, he moved to France with his younger brother to play for Stade Fran√ßais, reportedly negotiating a contract for his brother Mirco without telling him.

Masshouse is a development site in Birmingham, United Kingdom where 13 highrise blocks are being constructed for public services, commerce and residential purposes. When completed, the blocks will have a prominent position on the Eastside skyline. History The Masshouse area existed in the Victorian times as nothing else but Masshouse Lane. It was a small lane which was connected to Dale End and the junction at Albert Street and Duddeston Row. The name derives from the establishment of a Roman Catholic chapel (i.e. for the celebration of Mass) there by a Franciscan priest, Leo Randolph, in 1687, followed by a convent in March 1688. Both were burned down by a mob, instigated by the Protestant Lord Delamere, in November 1688.Chinn, Carl The Streets of Brum (Part 3).

The foundation stone was laid 23 March, in the above year, and on 16 August 1688, the first stone of a Franciscan Convent was laid adjoining to the Church, which latter was consecrated 4 Sept.. The Church was 95ft long by 33ft. wide, and towards the building of it and the Convent, James II gave 125 \\"tuns of timber,\\" which were sold for ¬£180; Sir John Gage gave timber valued at ¬£140; the Dowager Queen Catherine gave ¬£10 15s.; and a Mrs. Anne Gregg, ¬£250.

It was developed in the 1960s into an elevated road intersection on the A4400 road and was named Masshouse Circus. The area below it was cleared and used as a surface car park. The elevated roadways were made of concrete which created an appearance disliked by locals. Under the roads was a large car park with pedestrian subways. There were six subways: *New Meeting *Henns Walk *James Watt *Chapel Street *Ryder *Hospital The ring road became known as the \\"concrete collar\\" and restricted the expansion of the city centre core beyond it into the east. In March 2002, the roundabout was demolished to clear the land for development and this demolition was named the \\"breaking of the concrete collar\\". The work was carried out by Birse Civils and designed by Gifford & Partners in a contract worth ¬£24.2 million. The contractors sought to reuse the of reinforced concrete that was removed during demolition. Over ¬£9 million from the European Regional Development Fund was invested into the project. A replacement road to connect the Bullring Shopping Centre with Jennens Road was completed and opened in August 2003. However, this was closed for a time due to a number of injuries to pedestrians. The road (B4100, Moor Street Queensway) is now open although a potential accident spot remains as buses using the Moor Street Queensway bus lane eastbound have to go around a pedestrian crossing point to continue along Queensway at Masshouse. However, the land was left as a car park for a number of years as plans and designs for the development were created. Pieces of the rubble collected from the demolished structure, were put on sale by the Birmingham branch of Friends of the Earth with a price tag of 50p per piece. Development Block I. in April 2007. Masshouse is now cleared and ready for development with the largest of the three sites being used as a temporary car park. It has been separated into two phases with Phase 1 retaining the Masshouse name and the other plot, Phase 2, being called City Park Gate, named after the new Eastside City Park to be constructed next to it. Phase 1 will stretch from the McLaren Building to the Park Street. The scheme is being developed by David McLean Developments and has been designed by Edward Cullinan Architects. The entire scheme is expected to cost ¬£350 million and provide of space. The planning application for Block I was submitted in October 2004. Block I has been completed and the first residents moved into the building in December 2006. Construction of the 14-storey building cost ¬£30 million and consists of 173 studio, one and two- bedroom apartments. Over 50% of the building's 173 apartments were sold in the first week of release. The building is clad in of pre-cast panels. They consist of a complex mixture of finishes with some containing black polished bands bounded by a white concrete frame and finished to two different levels of exposure. The top floor penthouse apartments are clad with grey polished pre-cast panels. Many of the main cladding panels are either concave or convex with pointed ends and most will be pre-fitted with windows at the Techrete factory to accelerate the construction process. Block M In March 2007, an outline planning application was submitted to Birmingham City Council by GVA Grimley to build a mixed-use development of up to (gross internal area) on Plot 7. The application consisted of four buildings for retail, office, hotel and residential use. The entire scheme aims to create of Grade A office accommodation, 550 high specification apartments, Ground floor cafes, restaurants and retail units, Two new public squares, with traffic free landscaped areas, water features and public art and 800 car parking spaces. There will also be a Birmingham Magistrates' Court, with 24 court rooms in a purpose designed complex designed by Denton Corker Marshall. The courts will cost ¬£80 million and will be 15 storeys tall. In January 2010, Braemar Estates (Residential) Ltd were appointed as property managers to Block I at Masshouse. Block M (Hive) Masshouse submitted plans for a second residential building named Block M in August 2006. Construction commenced in August 2007 and was due for completion in 2009 however, the collapse of development partner David McLean in 2008 caused the construction to be put on hold. In 2009 McLaren were appointed to take over from David McLean and construction recommenced and completed in 2011. The development is estimated to have cost ¬£23 million and consists of 167 studio, one and two bedroom apartments with 12 apartments per floor over 14 floors. The apartments went on sale in Spring 2011 under the name Hive, studio apartments start at ¬£90,000 and one bedroom apartments start at ¬£110,000. Although the apartments are on sale hard landscaping at the eastern side is incomplete and due to delays to the Magistrates Court project the western side remains as derelict land. All properties are powered by Birmingham District Energy Company (BDEC), the first time residential homes in the city have benefited from the city's district water heating system the apartments receive power from the new Jennens Road Energy Centre on Aston University‚Äôs campus.

McClure in multiple American newspapers and then published in the British publication Black and White in April 1892Johanningsmeier, Charles. \\"How Real American Readers Originally Experienced James's 'The Real Thing.'\\" The Henry James Review. 27.1 Winter 2006: 75-99. and the following year as the title story in the collection, The Real Thing and Other Stories published by Macmillan. This story, often read as a parable, plays with the reality- illusion dichotomy that fascinated James, especially in the later stages of his career. For the illustrator who narrates the story, the genuine article proves all too useless for his commercial purposes. The story portrays the unfortunate victims of a society in which reality and representation are closely intertwined in ways that make art a difficult project to disentangle the two. Plot summary The narrator, an unnamed illustrator and aspiring painter, hires a faded genteel couple, the Monarchs, as models, after they have lost most of their money and must find some line of work. They are the \\"real thing\\" in that they perfectly represent the aristocratic type, but they prove inflexible for the painter's work. He comes to rely much more on two lower-class subjects who are nevertheless more capable: Oronte, an Italian, and Miss Churm, a lower-class Englishwoman. The illustrator finally has to get rid of the Monarchs, especially after his friend and fellow artist Jack Hawley criticizes the work in which the Monarchs are represented. Hawley says that the pair has hurt the narrator's art, perhaps permanently. In the final line of the story the narrator says he is \\"content to have paid the pricefor the memory\\". Major themes James plays with the exact meaning of \\"the real thing\\" throughout the story's plot, which was suggested to him by George du Maurier. The Monarchs may be the real thing when it comes to country-house visits and drawing-room conversation, but Oronte and Miss Churm are just as much the genuine article for professional modeling. Late in the story the Monarchs desperately try to keep their jobs by actually becoming servants to the narrator, Miss Churm, and Oronte, in a superb example of Jamesian chiasmus. Commentators have noted a bit of fantasy wish-fulfillment in the tale. The painter is hired to illustrate a series of novels by \\"the rarest of the novelistswho, long neglected by the multitudinous vulgar and dearly prized by the attentive (...) had had the happy fortune of seeing, late in life, the dawn and then the full light of a higher criticisman estimate in which, on the part of the public, there was something really of expiation.\\" James's own most laudatory criticism would come only posthumously. Critical evaluation Critics have generally praised what one of them called \\"one of James's neatest tales...important as poignant fiction, aesthetic parable, antiaristocratic satire, and sunken autobiography.\\" That James was able to fit so complex a subject into under ten thousand words was a genuine triumph of his by now completely mature technique. James does not make the parable into an arid demonstration of a debating point. The characters all come alive as fully individualized creations. The incompetent Monarchs are sympathetic, and the narrator himself is memorable for his increasingly desperate but ultimately futile attempts to help them.

Since the early 1990s he and his partner Marian Ilitch have been catalysts for legalization of gambling and development of gambling halls from coast to coast and in Hawaii with mixed results. Among them: casinos for Michigan's Little River Band of Ottawa Indians in Manistee; and the Bay Mills Indian Community in Brimley and a proposed off-reservation casino in Port Huron; several failed attempts to legalize gambling in the State of Hawaii and develop casinos on Waikƒ´kƒ´ Beach; a planned casino resort on Long Island, New York in the Town of Southampton (often referred to as The Hamptons) as \\"Gateway Casino Resorts, LLC\\" partnered with the Shinnecock Indians; and as Barwest, LLC, partners with the Big Lagoon Rancheria Indians and the Los Coyotes Band of Cahuilla and Cupe√±o Mission Indians to develop proposed dual off-reservation casinos in Barstow, California. Detroit casino development As a partner with NAG, Malik directed a ballot effort to bring casino gambling to Detroit, Michigan. In 1996, NAG teamed with Atwater Entertainment to support the passage of a Michigan statewide proposal facilitating the development of three commercial casinos in Detroit. Following passage of the proposal, Malik worked with state elected officials to negotiate and implement the regulatory oversight framework for the Detroit casinos. Malik was a partner in the casino group Detroit Entertainment, which included Marina Ilitch and more than 130 local partners. Detroit Entertainment selected Mandalay Bay Group as casino operator, and Malik worked with them on the development of the casino project now called MotorCity Casino. His efforts have resulted in an entertainment industry in Detroit that today exceeds $1.3 billion per year. Native American gaming Malik helped develop a casino for the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians in Manistee in northwest Michigan.

She is particularly known for her documentation of her experience at R. D. Laing's experimental therapeutic community at Kingsley Hall, London. She is referenced in the book The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson and Thomas Szasz's Schizophrenia. Life= Early life = Mary Barnes grew up in Portsmouth, England and then later in the London countryside. Her father was a lab technician and her mother was a homemaker. When Barnes was 18, her brother Peter who was 16 at the time, was committed to a psychiatric ward and diagnosed with Schizophrenia. A few years later he was sent to long-term institutional care. = Nursing career = Mary Barnes trained as a nurse and joined the army in World War II. In 1945, Barnes spent a year working at hospitals in Egypt and Palestine. She worked in Frankfurt for two years before returning to London as a full-time nurse. = Kingsley Hall = Kingsley Hall Barnes suffered from her first psychotic breakdown in 1952. She was admitted to St. Bernard's Hospital and diagnosed with Schizophrenia. After a year, Barnes was discharged and returned to working as a nursing tutor. In 1963, after reading R. D. Laing's book The Divided Self, she contacted him and began therapy. She was admitted to Kingsley Hall as the first patient. This intensified when in 1965 when she underwent regression therapy. During the process, she discovered a talent for art. She would later be described as \\"an ambassador for Laing\\", emerging from her journey to co-author a book about it with Dr. Joseph Berke, the resident psychiatrist who helped her.  Artistic career  Barnes's first paintings were done with her own feces on the walls depicting black breasts. Berke later gave her grease crayons which led to Barnes evolving from crayon scribbles, to finger-painting, and lastly led ultimately to oil painting. 183x183pxHer works, vivid oils often depicting religious themes, were first shown at the Camden Arts Centre in 1969. She subsequently became a respected artist, painting evocative works based on her experiences and showing her work on tour worldwide, accompanying it with talks on her experiences and mental health. In 1979 a play was produced, with script by Barnes with David Edgar. This was broadcast on BBC radio in the United Kingdom, most recently in December 2011 on Radio 4 Extra. In 1985, she moved to Scotland. Something Sacred, her book of conversations, writings and paintings, was published in 1989. In 1993, she moved to Tomintoul, where she died in 2001, aged 78. In 2010 there was a major retrospective exhibition of Barnes's work at SPACE (studios) in London and in 2015 at Bow Arts Boo-bah a retrospective co-curated by Dr. Joe Berke of Mary's work on paper and board in pastels and oils alongside photographs chronicling the therapeutic period at nearby Kingsley Hall. The exhibition Boo-Bah refers to a pet name Barnes called Berke in a love letter she wrote which was over a meter high. = Selected works = Small Figure  Small Figure is a painting which depicts a childlike figure made up of black lines. The black lines are thick and messy as Barnes was encouraged by staff at Kingsley Hall to use her fingers to paint. The figure is shown wearing what seems to be an oversized coat or sweater with the hands peeking out of the large sleeves. The checkered patterned clothing item reaches down past the small child's torso and seems to end right above where the child's knees would be. The figure is placed in the forefront and the feet are placed near the bottom of the paper. The head is tilted slightly to suggest a hunched over position. There are some faint marks coming from darker areas near the head that show wisps of long hair that also cover parts of the head. The face is facing towards the right. There are a lot of opposing elements such as movement, space, proportion, and color in Small Figure. Having the child not centered in the space adds to the illusion of the figure along with the coat covered most of the figure's body. The messiness of the strokes brings movement to the work. One can almost imagine the artist hurriedly using her paint-stained fingers to complete the form. There are lines that look like they had been gone over multiple times outlining the sweater and its pattern. The messiest strokes are around the head, face, and hands. The hands look like explosions coming from the sleeves. This movement brings a lot of energy to a figure whose pose does not allude to very much motion at all. In other works such as, Volcanic Eruption, Barnes is known for using a plethora of colors. In Small Figure, however, those colors are absent. Instead, black is the only color added to the white surface of the paper. The movement in the work comes through solely with short quick lines from the artist's fingers. Fingers that move so fast they may look just like the hands in the painting, exploding outwards from the wrists. This movement is confined mostly to the figure and a small space surrounding it giving the viewer a sense of angry tension bubbling right under the surface. Beyond the figure in the background is the clear white sheet untainted by the black energy of the figure. These conflicting elements show the inner struggle with anger and powerlessness the artist may have felt around the time of her painting this work and working on her regressive therapy. Small Figure is a self portrait of the girl Barnes‚Äô was growing up with her parents. Small under the coat and short on the page it portrays a scene of a small girl hunching over further emphasizing how powerless she felt as a child. The sweater covering her figure and the use of monotone color palette convey a sense of being hidden away in the background. Although the figure doesn't take all the vertical space on the paper, it takes of a majority of the overall space that utilizes perspective to make the viewer see the child from the child's point of view. The artist in her childlike state painted a portrait of her old life at the start of her new life. A resurrection in a way she would go through turmoil to find her inner peace alluding to Jesus's crucifixion.

It is a very large protein (600‚Äì900 kDa) and binds as many as 200 actin monomers. Because its length is proportional to thin filament length, it is believed that nebulin acts as a thin filament \\"ruler\\" and regulates thin filament length during sarcomere assembly and acts as the coats the actin filament. Other functions of nebulin, such as a role in cell signaling, remain uncertain. Nebulin has also been shown to regulate actin-myosin interactions by inhibiting ATPase activity in a calcium- calmodulin sensitive manner. Mutations in nebulin cause some cases of the autosomal recessive disorder nemaline myopathy. A smaller member of the nebulin protein family, termed nebulette, is expressed in cardiac muscle.  Structure  The structure of the SH3 domain of nebulin was determined by NMR.; The SH3 domain from nebulin is composed of 60 amino acid residues, of which 30 percent is in the beta sheet secondary structure (7 strands; 18 residues).  Knockout phenotype  As of 2007, two knockout mouse models for nebulin have been developed to better understand its in vivo function. Bang and colleagues demonstrated that nebulin-knockout mice die postnatally, have reduced thin filament length, and impaired contractile function. Postnatal sarcomere disorganization and degeneration occurred rapidly in these mice, indicating the nebulin is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of myofibrils. Witt and colleagues had similar results in their mice, which also died postnatally with reduced thin filament length and contractile function. These nebulin-knockout mice are being investigated as animal models of nemaline myopathy.

He currently plays for French club Toulon and captains the italian national team. Parisse is Italy's most-capped player, and currently third most-capped player worldwide. He was the first Italian rugby union player to be nominated for the IRB International Player of the Year, first in 2008 and again in 2013. Parisse is widely considered as one of the greatest number eights to play the game in the modern era, and the greatest Italian rugby player of all time. He also holds the joint record of playing in five Rugby World Cups. Early life Parisse was born in La Plata, capital of Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Italian parents. His father, also Sergio, played for the l'Aquila club with whom he won the Italian club championship in 1967 before his job with the Alitalia airline took him to Argentina in 1970. His family spoke Italian at home and every year Sergio would go on holiday to Italy. Career Sergio Parisse jumps to catch an up and under during a warm up session in Toulouse Parisse played junior rugby divisions and his first senior division for Club Universitario de La Plata, at La Plata city. In 2003, Parisse moved to Italy permanently to pursue a rugby career. He signed for Benetton Treviso where he played for four years before being lured to Stade Fran√ßais by then president Max Guazzini in 2005. He had a long and successful career with the Parisian team, staying there for 14 seasons and winning two Top 14 titles. In 2019, he cut ties with the club after disagreements with the coaching team led by South African Heyneke Meyer. Although it was rumoured that he could go back to finish his career with his first professional club, Treviso, Parisse signed for Top 14 rivals Toulon.  International career  Parisse was eligible to play international rugby for Argentina, the country of his birth, and Italy, the country where his parents are from. At just 17 years old, he played for Italy U20s in the Junior World Championship in Chile. There he was spotted by Argentinian selectors and approached in an attempt to persuade him to switch his allegiance to the Pumas set-up. When asked if he had any regrets on staying on with Italy, he answered ‚ÄúI have no regrets at all (...) it never occurred to me not to play for Italy. My parents are Italian, we were brought up speaking Italian and returned home to L‚ÄôAquila every summer. To play for Italy was a dream, to play for my culture and my family. When you pull on a jersey, it is not just a piece of clothing for the day, a convenience. Loyalty, honour and trust - these are the things that mean a lot to me\\" Parisse made his full Test debut for the Italy national team in June 2002, being capped at the age of 18 by then Azzurri coach John Kirwan, in a 64-10 defeat to New Zealand in Hamilton. Though Italy failed to make it beyond the pool stage of the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Parisse played well. Parisse continued his form into the 2008 Six Nations Championship. Parisse won his 50th cap for Italy against England in the 2008 Six Nations Championship at the age of 24. Parisse is also the Italian captain, appointed in 2008 by Nick Mallett in place of Marco Bortolami. In September 2008 Parisse was nominated for IRB International Player of the Year alongside Dan Carter, Ryan Jones, Shane Williams and Mike Blair. Parisse missed most of the 2009‚Äì10 Top 14 season with a serious knee injury that ruled him out of the 2010 Six Nations Championship. Parisse captained Italy in the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. Italy finished third in their group, one place short of qualification, after two losses against Australia and Ireland on top of their two wins against USA and Russia. Parisse scored a total of two tries at the tournament. He captained Italy in the 2012 Six Nations Championship. Italy had a mixed championship with losses against France, Wales, England and Ireland but also victory against Scotland to avoid the wooden spoon. Parisse again captained Italy for the 2013 Six Nations Championship. The campaign started very well for the Italians when they beat France for only the second time ever, with Parisse himself scoring a try. The following week Italy lost 33‚Äì10 to Scotland in an underwhelming performance at Murrayfield. Parisse missed Italy's match with Wales on 23 February 2013 due to abusing a referee in a club game with Stade Francais. Italy struggled without their captain and lost 26‚Äì9. Parisse returned for Italy's next game against England and despite England being massive favourites Italy put in a competitive display to only lose by seven points, 18‚Äì11. In the last week of the championship Italy beat Ireland for the first time ever in a competitive match on a margin of 22‚Äì15 making it one of Italy's most successful Six Nations ever. Personal life He is a keen skier, but has done it less often after teammate Sylvain Marconnet broke his leg skiing in 2007. Parisse married Miss France 2006 and Miss Europe 2006 Alexandra Rosenfeld in early 2010. They got married in H√©rault where Rosenfeld is from. The couple's first child, a daughter named Ava, was born on 23 August 2010 in B√©ziers. Rosenfeld and Parisse divorced in April 2013. Parisse married Silvia Bragazzi in 2014. Parisse has appeared on Dieux du Stade on numerous occasions. Parisse's mother tongue is Italian, and he aso speaks Spanish, French and English.  Style of play  Parisse is known for having many qualities, among them, his powerful running ability, poised offloading and supreme awareness. He is a powerful ball-carrier, athletic and furiously committed; a useful line-out option, defensively sound, and blessed with superb handling, pace and impressive footwork. As a team-mate at Stade in Paris, England lock Tom Palmer described him as \\"a high-quality player, a very good and powerful athlete, who combines that with being very skilful. He has a high work-rate, so he has everything you need to be a top player.\\" Ireland legend Paul O'Connell has also waxed lyrical about Parisse. \\"Sergio has everything. He catches high balls, he chases high balls, he chips, he can make turnovers on the ground, he intercepts, he‚Äôs a phenomenal carrier, if he has to go straight he has great footwork, he‚Äôs a brilliant passer, he pressurise the referee. He does it all.\\"  Legacy  Parisse has often been praised for maintaining his high standards and world-class performances even as a part of a lacklustre era for Italian rugby. About this fact, he stated that \\"Obviously I did not achieve a lot of wins in the Italy jersey but that doesn't make me feel any less proud. I have always hated defeat but that does not make me feel like a failure. I was not playing for New Zealand, so I knew there would be more defeats than victories, but as captain you have to set an example. My job as captain was not just to make speeches. The day after a game, you might wake up and feel dead because you've given a lot of emotion, but you've failed to win. You lose by three points and you're overthinking. \\"Why did we lose? How do we get better? Why didn't our plan work?\\" But you have to keep going. Again. Again. Again. It is easier to captain a team when you are winning 80 per cent of the time, sure, but you stay positive.\\" He has played in 142 tests, of which he has lost 106. Italy last won a Six Nations game in 2015. Parisse played in five Rugby World Cups, making his debut in the 2003 tournament hosted by Australia, and going on to play in France (2007), New Zealand (2011), England (2015) and Japan (2019). He's only the third player to achieve such a feat, along with fellow italian back-rower Mauro Bergamasco and Samoan midfielder Brian Lima. With 69 appearances, Parisse is the most-capped player in Guinness Six Nations history. He's the third player with most international caps (142) in world rugby, only behind All Blacks legend Richie McCaw and Wales stalwart Alun Wyn Jones. Parisse has been twice nominated for the prestigious World Rugby Player of the Year award, losing to Welsh speedster Shane Williams in 2008 and All Blacks icon Kieran Read in 2013 . To date, he's the only italian to be nominated. When Italy coach Franco Smith was asked how to replace Parisse, he was straightforward, \\"You don't. The more you want to replace him, the more difficult it is going to be. He's one of a kind. There are a lot of rugby personalities around the world that have never been replaced. You lose them forever, but there are new personalities that can develop. He's overshadowed Italian rugby, for the right reasons, for a very long time. Now it's time to shine a light on others who can develop with Sergio as their example.\\" Honours *National Championship of Excellence Champions Treviso: 2002‚Äì03, 2003‚Äì04 *Coppa Italia Champions Treviso: 2004‚Äì05 *French Top 14 Champions Stade Fran√ßais: 2006‚Äì07, 2014‚Äì15 *European Challenge Cup  Champions Stade Fran√ßais: 2016‚Äì17 Runners-up (2) 2010‚Äì11, 2012‚Äì13 ReferencesExternal links *RBS 6 Nations profile *Parisse handed Italy captaincy *Role As Captain *Knee Injury *ESPN Profile Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine rugby union players Category:Benetton Rugby Treviso players Category:Italian people of Argentine descent Category:Italian rugby union players Category:Italy international rugby union players Category:Barbarian F.C. players Category:Rugby union number eights Category:Stade Fran√ßais rugby players Category:RC Toulonnais players Category:Italian expatriate rugby union players Category:Expatriate rugby union players in France Category:Italian expatriate sportspeople in France Category:Sportspeople from La Plata ","title":"Sergio Parisse"},{"id":"3960317","text":"A Sagartian, Apadana, Persepolis.

Their exact location is unknown; they were probably neighbors of the Parthians in northeastern Iran. According to Herodotus (1.125, 7.85) they were related to the Persians (Southwestern Iranian), but they may also have entered a political union with the Medians (Northwestern Iranian) at some point (J. van Wesendonk in ZII 9, 1933, pp. 23f.).

The term may also be used for any personal container for gunpowder, the shape has to be long and curved for which powder flask is the strictly correct term. Features Typically there was a stopper at both ends, in later examples spring-loaded to close automatically for safety.In 1833 a letter to the English magazine The Sportsman's Cabinet, and Town and Country Magazine explained graphically the need for such safety devices, Google Books The wide mouth was used for refilling, while the powder was dispensed from the narrow point. In some cases the point was closed and the mouth used for both, with a powder measure, a type of scoop used to dispense the powder, and in others both ends were open and the horn merely used as a funnel. The horn was typically held by a long strap and slung over the shoulder.Garry, 192 The inside and outside of a powder horn were often polished to make the horn translucent so that the soldier would be able to see how much powder he had left. The use of animal horn along with nonferrous metal parts ensured that the powder would not be detonated by sparks during storage and loading. Horn was also naturally waterproof and already hollow inside. Reasons for use Although forms of pre-packaged paper cartridges go back to the Middle Ages, their extra cost and small benefit to civilian users discouraged wide-spread adoption of them except for militia duty. For example, on April 19, 1775, in Lexington and Concord, paper cartridges were routinely used by many civilians on the opening day of the American Revolutionary War. Similarly, the British soldiers there carried cartridge boxes holding 36 paper cartridges. The advantage of paper cartridges was speed; 3 to 4 rounds a minute were possible using paper cartridges. Measuring each charge before firing reduced the rate of fire to about one round per minute. There were other methods, including small cloth bags containing the correct amount of powder for a single shot, that might be carried on a bandolier (again requiring a container for a supply for refilling). An important safety concern was that when reloading a muzzle-loading gun soon after a shot there might be small pieces of wadding burning in the muzzle, which would cause the new load of powder to ignite as a flash. So long as no part of the loader faced the end of the barrel this was not dangerous in itself, but if a spark reached the main supply in the powder flask a fatal explosion was likely. Various precautions were taken, both in the design and use of powder measures used with flasks, or in the flasks themselves, to prevent this from happening. Powder horns also served the important purpose of keeping black powder dry. They began to be replaced by copper flasks in the nineteenth century. Powder horns were also used for the priming of large naval guns, and in blasting operations; apparently sometimes the horn shape was merely a convenient form of funnel in such cases, and was open at both ends and not used as a container. Decoration In America, a number of period horns dating from the French and Indian wars throughout the American Revolution and beyond have been preserved in private and other collections. Many decorated examples shed light on the life and history of the individuals that used them and can be classified as a medium of folk art. Powder horns were often decorated, most often with engraving, making a form of scrimshaw, which was sometimes supplemented with color. Rendered obsolete The powder horn was rendered obsolete by the innovations brought about by Hall, Sharps, Spencer and the later development of self-contained cartridges that were developed and marketed successfully by Oliver Winchester, after which manufactured metallic cartridges became standard.

The presumption lies in the similarity between the Phonology, or sounds of the correct name and the name as written. Such similar-sounding words are called a homonym, while similar- sounding phrases or names would be a holorime. In Latin it means \\"Sounding the same.\\" Find Law Definition Some examples are Seagrave/Segrave, Hutson/Hudson, Coonrad/Conrad, Keen/Keene, and Diadema/Deadema. United Kingdom Under UK jurisdiction, there has been little judicial activity in this area. The old judgment of R v Davis(1851) 15 JP 450 provides: :\\"If two names spelt differently necessarily sound alike, the court may, as matter of law, pronounce them to be idem sonantia; but if they do not necessarily sound alike, the question whether they are idem sonantia is a question of fact for the jury\\". The modern case of Re Vidiofusion Ltd[1975] 1 All ER 76 establishes a four-stage test when a name of a company is spelled differently in writing: * No Company of a similar name * Idem Sonantia - similar pronunciation * No marked vision difference (judge gave example of Jackson/Jaxon being too dissimilar visually) * Misspelling does not substantially change the placement of the name if placed in an alphabetical list. United States Remnants of this common law doctrine exist today in the United States in the Uniform Commercial Code. Name changes can mislead searchers of official records of titles or liens. Article 9 of the UCC states that a financing statement shall not perfect a valid security interest if a name change would be \\"seriously misleading.\\".UCC 9-402 A creditor may gain priority over other creditors in the event of a bankruptcy by filing a financing statement. The financing statement contains information relevant to the secured transaction and puts other creditors on notice that the filer has a secured interest in the property. Should the filer use a debtor name that is substantially different from the debtor's actual name, the purpose of filing the financing statement is defeated. On the other hand, if there is a minor difference in spelling or an idem sonans, the error is not fatal, but only if it is not seriously misleading. The actual search results may reveal a debtor with a similar name and address which would put the researcher on notice to investigate further, which is the purpose of the filing in the first place. The legal effect of an idem sonans is that the minor name difference shall have no bearing on the priority of debtors. There is some movement away from this doctrine under modern New York Common law, especially in Conveyancing.Collect Law website , citing Big Fur v. Gross, N.Y.L.J., August 12, 1998, p. 23, col. 3; and Grygorewicz vs. Domestic and Foreign Discount Corp., 179 Misc. 1017 (Sup. Ct. Kings Co. 1943). That means that a creditor filing a judgment lien or a title abstract company searching title to real property by a deed filed in an office of a county clerk must search by exact name, and can not rely on idem sonans.Id. California is also showing movement from this common law doctrine in transfer of property. The court held that for the \\"purposes of identification\\" the doctrine applies, but refused to allow it in the transfer of real property.Orr v Byers, 244 Cal Rptr. 13 (Court of Appeal of Ca, 4th, 1988) New Hampshire Supreme Court in 1994 took a stance on this doctrine and said \\"We concur with the court in Orr that \\"the simple alternative is to require [attachment creditors] simply to spell the names of their ... debtors properly.\\"\\" Brady v Mullen., 139 N.H. 67 (Sup.

Route San Vicente is the northernmost primary thoroughfare in Santa Monica. San Vicente begins at Ocean Avenue at Palisades Park (Santa Monica) adjacent to the historic Native American totem pole sculpture of public art, and heads east. Continuing through Santa Monica, the route begins to curve south. San Vicente enters the city of Los Angeles at 26th Street. San Vicente becomes the central thoroughfare in downtown Brentwood, home to many restaurants and popular shops. San Vicente curves to the south at the Veterans Administration complex, intersecting Wilshire Boulevard, where it ends, becoming Federal Avenue and continuing south into West Los Angeles. The entire route carries a wide median with abundant grass and trees, and its only traffic lights between Ocean Avenue and Bundy Drive are at 7th Street and 26th Street. Intersections with Ocean Avenue and 7th Street in Santa Monica lead down to Santa Monica Canyon and on to the Pacific Coast Highway. The intersection with 26th Street (north) connects with Sunset Boulevard and Mandeville Canyon. For most of its length, it runs generally parallel and south of Sunset Boulevard and north of Montana Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard. Features San Vicente Boulevard is four lanes wide with a large landscaped median along its entire length, planted with ~120 large Coral trees (Erythrina caffra), along its center. Those in the western section within Los Angeles, between 26th Street and Bringham Avenue, are a designated Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. Brentwoodcommunitycouncil.org: Brentwood Coral Tree Endowment Fund The median is popular with joggers. Other features along the boulevard include The Brentwood Country Mart at 26th and San Vicente, and the private Brentwood Country Club and golf course. The Santa Monica and Brentwood neighborhoods north of San Vicente Boulevard often have larger properties with distinctive residences. History The Mezzaluna Trattoria, formerly located at 11750 San Vicente Boulevard, was involved in one of Los Angeles' most notorious murders: the O. J. Simpson murder case. Nicole Brown Simpson was a frequent patron and had eaten there with her family on the last night of her life. Her friend Ronald Goldman, a waiter at the restaurant, was also murdered at Brown's condominium that night, when he had stopped by to return the eyeglasses Brown's mother had left behind at the restaurant. 15 months later, Goldman's friend and fellow Mezzaluna Trattoria waiter, Michael Nigg, was murdered in Hollywood, in a crime F. Lee Bailey described as \\"fishy\\". In separate books, Bailey and the authors of Killing Time: The First Full Investigation Into the Unsolved Murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman (1996), Donald Freed and Raymond P. Briggs, have noted that the restaurant was the nexus of drug trafficking in Brentwood, and Nigg and Goldman were not the only Mezzaluna waiters who had fallen victim to foul play around that time: two others were missing, and a third had his car destroyed by fire in Corona del Mar during 1994. The restaurant's patronage suffered in the wake of the murders and the lengthy O.J. Simpson murder trial, and the establishment closed in 1997. The building now under new ownership, currently is vacant.

Geo Milev is perhaps best known for his epic poem Septemvri, written in the aftermath of the Communist-led September Uprising. Life Geo Milev was born Georgi Milev Kasabov in Radne mahale, today Radnevo, the first son in the family of school teachers Milyo and Anastasia Kasabovi. In 1897 the family moved to Stara Zagora, where his father started a publishing business in 1907. Geo Milev attended the town's high school from 1907 to 1911 before he went on to study at the Faculty of Philology of Sofia University. From 1912 Geo Milev continued his education at the Faculty of Philosophy of Leipzig University, where he was introduced to German Expressionism. On 30 July 1914, two days after the outbreak of the First World War, he traveled from Leipzig to London, where he spent several months sightseeing and improving his English and met the Belgian Symbolist poet √âmile Verhaeren. On returning to Germany, Geo Milev was detained in Hamburg on 18 October 1914 on suspicion of being an English spy. He was released after eleven days and returned to Leipzig, where he worked on his university thesis on Richard Dehmel. On 8 August 1915 he returned to Bulgaria without having obtained a degree. Beginning in 1916 he fought in World War I, where he was severely injured. After recuperating in Berlin he began to collaborate with the magazine Aktion. Upon his return to Bulgaria he started to publish the Bulgarian modernist magazine –í–µ–∑–Ω–∏ (Scales), in Sofia. He contributed to the publication as a translator, theatre reviewer, director and editor of anthologies. Death On May 15, 1925, in the course of government reprisals following the St Nedelya Church assault, Geo Milev, a member of the Bulgarian Communist party, was taken to a police station for a \\"short interrogation\\" from which he never returned. His fate remained unknown for 30 years. In 1954 during the trial of General Ivan Valkov and a group of former police and military executioners, one of the defendants confessed how victims of the 1925 purge had been executed and where they were buried. Geo Milev had been strangled with wire and then buried in a mass grave in Ilientsi, near Sofia. His skull was found in the mass grave. His body was identified by the glass eye he was wearing after he lost his right eye in World War I. Self- portrait 1918 His daughter was the writer and diplomat Leda Mileva.

Note the toll-house at left. Alexandra Bridge Provincial Park is a provincial park in British Columbia, Canada. It is located in the Fraser Canyon approximately two kilometres (one mile) north of Spuzzum and 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of Hope. The bridge built in 1926 for the newly built Cariboo Highway, looking to the west bank. Overview The small 55 ha (136 acre) park is centred on the site of the original Cariboo Wagon Road bridge over the Fraser River. The park was established in 1984 because of its historical qualifications. It has picnic tables but no camping. Public access is via a trail from a parking lot on the east side of the Fraser, as the old portion of the pre-modernization Cariboo Highway, which used the bridge, is no longer open to the public. History The Nlaka'pamux and Sto:lo First Nations have inhabited the area for over 9000 years. The first persons of European descent known to have visited the site were Simon Fraser and his crew during their expedition down the Fraser Canyon in 1808. Situated at a narrows in the canyon, with room for the necessary abutments, the site was an important fishing site for the Sto:lo and Nlaka'pamux First Nations peoples. Like all such locations in the Fraser Canyon (which are many), there was a large aboriginal village on the west bank just downstream from the bridge site in pre-railway times. Fish-drying racks can still be seen at the location today, and were visible in historic photographs from early times. A difficult and costly trail, intended to link Fort Langley with New Caledonia because of the loss of the old route in the wake of the Oregon Treaty of 1846, began on the east bank of the river and switchbacked up the mountainside, with \\"staircases\\" made for the mules and other pack animals. Dangerous and beset with difficult snows, the trail was abandoned after only a few uses and superseded by trails connecting inland farther south.British Columbia Chronicle, 1847-1871: Gold & Colonists, Helen and G.P.V. Akrigg, Discovery Press, Vancouver (1977) There is mention of a pole-bridge built by aboriginal people at the site, torn down to make way for the \\"new\\" one of the 1860s, but a ferry also operated in this area connecting with Kequaloose on the east bank, where the Brigade Trail begins its climb over the Cascade Mountains before descending back to the Fraser via the Anderson River at Boston Bar. During the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in 1858, a ferry service was established here in a monopoly situation, as J.W. Hicks, the magistrate at Yale, had his \\"fingers in the pie,\\" as with many other businesses under his official purview.McGowan's War, Donald J. Hauka, New Star Books, Vancouver (2000) (Hicks was fired because of his various indiscretions during the affair known as McGowan's War.) Alexandra Bridge (original) The original road bridge was constructed in 1861 by Joseph Trutch, Commissioner of Public Works for the Colony of British Columbia, as part of the development of the Cariboo Road using aboriginal and Chinese labour (though a government minister, Trutch contracted the job privately to his own profit and had the toll license at the location as part of his remuneration).F.W. Howay and E.O.S. Scholfield, British Columbia From the Earliest Times to the Present, p. 103, publ. 1916 He named the bridge after Princess Alexandra of Wales (wife of Queen Victoria's eldest son, who would become Edward VII). Trutch's bridge was rebuilt by the Royal Engineers as construction of the Cariboo Road progressed, with the newer span opening in 1863. Just above the bridge on the east bank is Alexandra Lodge, on the site of one of the more important roadhouses of the many on the Cariboo Road, situated at the base of the arduous climb up the next hill northwards and at the end of the torturous journey connected Yale to Spuzzum. Also nearby is the Alexandra Tunnel, one of many on the route of the Canadian National Railway through the Fraser Canyon. The original bridge was destroyed by the rising waters of the Fraser Flood of 1894 and its remains dismantled in 1912 due to hazards during railway construction, and the long abandonment of the Cariboo Road, itself a casualty of CPR construction in the 1880s. After World War I, the dawn of the automotive era saw a reinvestment in roads in the province including the re-opening of the Fraser Canyon to road traffic in the form of the new Cariboo Highway in the 1920s, and a new suspension bridge was built upon the footings of the original structure in 1926 (with a deck level ten feet higher than the previous design). This second Alexandra Suspension Bridge still exists today, though it ceased to be used for automobile traffic in 1964. The new Alexandra Bridge, constructed by the B.C. Ministry of Highways in 1960-64, is approximately two kilometres (one mile) downstream and uses a high truss-arch span to cross the canyon. The site of the bridge, like most similar spots along the Fraser Canyon, is a traditional fishing spot because of the way the river is forced through narrow, steep banks, offering fishermen a chance to reach salmon struggling through the stronger current through the narrowed gorge. Millions of Spring, Coho, Chum, Pink and Sockeye salmon pass through the park on their way to spawning grounds every year. As well, the park contains many large tree species such as Western hemlock, Western redcedar and Douglas-fir. Terrain Rising steeply on the east bank of the Fraser River, the site contains two well-defined glacio-fluvial benches.

History  The Danish People's Party was formed on March 1, 1941 by former members of the Nazi DNSAP, as well as some politicians originally from the liberal Danmarks Retsforbund, the Conservative People's Party and the Social Democratic Party. The party supported a corporativist state and was anti-communist. The first leader of the party was Victor P√ºrschel, a former conservative MP and deputy spokesman. Wilfred Petersen quickly became the new leader of the party which was then influenced by his sympathies for Nazism and anti-semitism. However, this caused Victor P√ºrschel and other leading members to leave the party during 1943. This reduced Danish People's Party to a historical footnote that was soon forgotten. After the war, some of its founders were convicted for unnational behaviour. When the current Danish People's Party were founded in 1995, opponents drew attention to the fact that the name had been used in the past by a Nazi-friendly party. Representatives of the new Danish People's Party, however, rejected any connection with the wartime party, largely unknown by 1995, and said they regarded the coincidence as unimportant.

In December 1963/January 1964, 17-year-old Gardner stayed awake for 11 days and 25 minutes (264.4 hours), breaking the previous record of 260 hours held by Honolulu DJ, Tom Rounds. Gardner's record attempt was attended by Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William C. Dement, while his health was monitored by Lt. Cmdr. John J. Ross. A log was kept by two of Gardner's classmates from Point Loma High School, Bruce McAllister and Joe Marciano Jr. Accounts of Gardner's sleep- deprivation experience and medical response became widely known among the sleep research community.Eleven days awake, Extract from \\"Elephants on Acid: And Other Bizarre Experiments,\\" by Alex Boese. Elephants on Acid: And Other Bizarre Experiments, Alex Boese, , Harvest Books, 5 Nov 2007Neurological Findings After Prolonged Sleep Deprivation, Ross J. (1965), Archives of Neurology 12:399-403. Health effects It has been claimed that Gardner's experiment demonstrated that extreme sleep deprivation has little effect, other than the mood changes associated with tiredness, The Nature of Sleep and its Impact on Health, Ben Best, life-extensionist homepage, undated article primarily due to a report by researcher William Dement, who stated that on the tenth day of the experiment, Gardner had been, among other things, able to beat Dement at pinball. However, Lt. Cmdr. John J. Ross, who monitored his health, reported serious cognitive and behavioral changes. These included moodiness, problems with concentration and short term memory, paranoia, and hallucinations. On the eleventh day, when he was asked to subtract seven repeatedly, starting with 100, he stopped at 65. When asked why he had stopped, he replied that he had forgotten what he was doing. On his final day, Gardner presided over a press conference where he spoke without slurring or stumbling his words and in general appeared to be in excellent health. \\"I wanted to prove that bad things didn't happen if you went without sleep,\\" said Gardner. \\"I thought, 'I can break that record and I don't think it would be a negative experience.'\\"Sleeping In, David Goldenberg, Gelf Magazine, 31 May 2006 Recovery Gardner's sleep recovery was observed by sleep researchers who noted changes in sleep structure during post-deprivation recovery.Psychiatric and EEG observations on a case of prolonged (264 hours) wakefulness, G. Gulevich et al., Arch Gen Psychiatry, Vol. 15, Issue 1, 29-35, 1 July 1966 After completing his record, Gardner slept for 14 hours and 40 minutes, awoke naturally around 8:40 p.m., and stayed awake until about 7:30 p.m. the next day, when he slept an additional ten and a half hours. Gardner appeared to have fully recovered from his loss of sleep, with follow up sleep recordings taken one, six, and ten weeks after the fact showing no significant differences. No long-term psychological or physical effects have been observed.Dement, William C. The Promise of Sleep. (New York: Dell Publishing, 1999) Subsequent record information According to news reports, Gardner's record has been broken a number of times. Some of these cases are described below for comparison. Gardner's case still stands out, however, because it has been so extensively documented. It is difficult to determine the accuracy of a sleep deprivation period unless the participant is carefully observed to detect short microsleeps, which the participant might not even notice. Also, records for voluntary sleep deprivation are no longer kept by Guinness World Records for fear that participants will suffer ill effects. Some sources report that Gardner's record was broken a month later by Toimi Soini, in Hamina, Finland, who stayed awake for 11¬Ω days, or 276 hours from February 5-15, 1964 and the Guinness World Records record is 449 hours by Maureen Weston, of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, UK in April 1977 in a rocking-chair marathon.What happens when you stay awake for eleven days?, pseudonymous contributor, Digital Journal, October 2007 Because of the policy against maintaining this record, recent editions of Guinness do not provide any information about sleep deprivation.Guinness World Records 2004, Guinness World Records Ltd, 2003; no reference to sleep deprivation or wakefulness is found in the index. More recently, Tony Wright on May 25, 2007, was reported to have exceeded Randy Gardner's feat in the apparent belief that Gardner's record had not been beaten. He used 24-hour video for documentation. The Australian National Sleep Research Project states the record for sleep deprivation is 18 days, 21 hours, and 40 minutes.40 Facts About Sleep You Probably Didn't Know, The National Sleep Research Project, undated, site ¬© Australian Broadcasting Corporation 2000 See also * Sleep deprivation ReferencesFurther reading  * The Sleepwatchers, William C.

The U.S Forest Service and a group of professors, including six at the Oregon State University College of Forestry, wrote a letter to the prestigious scientific journal Science requesting that publication of a short forestry paper written by an OSU Forestry graduate student and others be delayed until the authors could respond to it, arguing the article was \\"short on qualifiers and context\\". The group requested alternatively that Science publish a sidebar illustrating their concerns alongside the paper. Science refused, and the paper, which had already undergone peer review and been approved for publication, appeared in the January 20, 2006 issue. The paper had been published in the online edition of Science before the letter was written.  Science article  The paper, written by graduate student Dan Donato and several colleagues, concerned the effects of logging in the aftermath of the 2002 Biscuit Fire, a massive wildfire which burned nearly a half million acres (2,000 km¬≤) in southwestern Oregon. Some forestry scientists, and the Bush administration, proposed that salvage logging‚Äîremoval of dead trees, many still usable as timber, after a fire‚Äîwas necessary for fire safety and forest regeneration.Sessions, J., P. Bettinger, R. Buckman, M. Newton, and J. Hamann. 2004. Hastening the return of complex forests following fire: The consequences of delay. Journal of Forestry 102(3):38-45. Donato et al.'s research provided some evidence contradicting this view. They compared sections of the burn which were burned severely and then salvage-logged to sections which had only been burned. They found the unlogged portions had significantly more conifer seedlings than were found in the logged portions. The paper suggested that soil disturbance and materials left over from the logging process may have disturbed the growth of seedlings. The paper also reported elevated surface fuels in the logged sites, which they concluded elevated the risk of future fire.  Political involvement  The incident and its aftermath had significant repercussions in the forestry community, and highlighted the political obstacles surrounding much of forestry science and research. When the letter first came to light the College of Forestry was subjected to heavy criticism from both within and outside for what many perceived as an unwarranted attack on academic freedom.Wildfire logging debate heats up Accusations of politically motivated bias were made by both sides, and critics of the incident noted that the College received 10% of its funding from a tax on logging, and that many professors had ties with the Forest Service and the logging industry. Defenders of the college noted that the vast majority of research in the college was funded by competitive grants, and that collaboration with government agencies and relevant industries is common across the sciences.MR Zine: Corporate Forestry and Academic Freedom Hal Salwasser, the dean of the College of Forestry, eventually survived a vote of confidence, apologized for his part in the controversy (but not for calling environmentalists \\"goons\\" http://www.gazettetimes.com/news/opinion/letters- osu-forestry-dean-hal-salwasser-should-be- fired/article_90d55382-8c09-5be0-982c-a641b8b5be6e.htmlhttps://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/11/nation/na- salvage11), and reaffirmed OSU's support for academic freedom. The letter's primary author, OSU forestry engineering professor John Sessions, claimed that the paper's publication constituted a failure of the peer review process, and that he would appeal the matter to the board of Science.The Herald: Forestry professor continues to fight anti-logging research Science editor-in-chief Donald Kennedy said in a letter to The Oregonian that it \\"would be foolish to argue that no consideration of the political extensions of this finding could have entered the decision\\" regarding publication; however, he believes that the paper would have \\"made it (to publication) on its own\\".

The station broadcasts in Austin, Texas on 91.7 MHz at an effective radiated power of 3 kilowatts and is licensed to Texas Educational Broadcasting Co-operative, Inc., a nonprofit organization (doing business as KOOP Radio, previously Austin Co-op Radio). The station was assigned the KOOP call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on October 27, 1993. The 91.7 frequency is shared with KVRX, the student radio station for The University of Texas at Austin. KOOP broadcasts on 91.7 FM from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday and from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. KVRX, which is licensed to the University, broadcasts during the remaining hours. KOOP streams online during KVRX's broadcast hours. KOOP's studios and transmitter are located separately in East Austin. Programming format KOOP's radio format consists of 75 locally produced shows each week. Daytime programming typically consists of music programs, while late afternoon programming is usually news. Awards The KOOP radio station has won 19 Best of Austin awards from the Austin Chronicle from 1994 to 2006. In 1994 the station shared the Austin Music Awards honor for \\"Best Thing To Happen in Austin\\" with KVRX. Early History Founder The Austin Co-op Radio project was initiated by James R. (Jim) Ellinger, whose community radio experience included social justice programming for prisoners, broadcast on KOPN-FM in Columbia, Missouri; local information programming on KAZI-FM in Austin, Texas; and engagement with NFCB (the National Federation of Community Broadcasters and AMARC (l'Association Internationale des Radiodiffuseurs Communautaires / World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters). He also worked with cooperatives in the areas of housing and food. He released a first call-out for interested persons in December 1983. The first official meeting was held March 28, 1984, and a newsletter including the minutes was published.Washington DC: \\"Station of the Month - Austin Co-op Radio, NFCB News, n.d., p.7Handwritten timeline in KOOP Radio archive collection, Briscoe Center for American History Locating a frequency and a tower site In January 1984, nine individuals and five local businesses including a bookstore, a record store, and a local free weekly contributed $10 each towards a frequency search. The $140 raised was sent to Broadcast Technical Services, which by June 1984 had identified the sole full- power FM channel open in the Austin area - 91.7 FM, channel no. 218. One obstacle in having the FCC grant a license was a 1972 treaty to counter ‚Äúborder blaster‚Äù stations that broadcast from Mexico, which affecting the application because of the proximity to Mexico. Ellinger and the group lobbied Texas‚Äô Sen. Lloyd Bentsen and were successful in having the treaty changed, freeing up the frequency. Applications for new noncommercial frequencies, however, had been frozen by the FCC and were not lifted until July 1985. Although two members, Judy Douglass and Tom Donahue, formed a cable broadcasting committee, the main effort was still focused on over the air broadcasting. In July 1986, Board Members Jim Ellinger and Michelle Rosenberg signed a lease with the nonprofit Center for Maximum Potential Building Systems, located in Hornsby, Texas, for space to erect a broadcasting tower. Formal organization During 1985, Austin Co-op Radio was incorporated with the State of Texas, had its bylaws approved by the National Federation of Community Broadcasters, and received charitable status from the city of Austin. In January 1986, the registered name of the organization was officially changed to Texas Educational Broadcasting Co-operative, Inc. In May 1986, the Internal Revenue Service approved its 501(c)3 charitable status; in June, the state approved tax exempt status.NFCB News op. cit.Certificates in the Austin Co-op Radio collection at Briscoe Center for American History According to the author of the Bylaws, Hunter Ellinger: KOOP bylaws contain two main sets of provisions to protect democracy: 1) The Community Board is to be elected annually from eight different constituencies (20% by station volunteers, 15% by individual dues-paying members, 15% by organizational dues- paying members, 10% by Hispanic community organizations, 10% by women's community organizations, 10% by youth/student community organizations, 10% by co-op community organizations, and 10% by other community organizations). 2) Each year's Community Board is to elect only one-third of the Board of Trustees. If vacancies occur, the rest of their terms are to be served by replacements chosen by the remaining Trustees (who represent several years' voters), not by the current year's Community Board.'' These provisions are designed to ensure that each Community Board is broadly representative and is not dominated by a narrow set of interests. Note that these provisions do not prevent a change in the direction, philosophy, or leadership of the station. They simply require that any such change be based on support from many membership sectors and on more than one annual election.Hunter Ellinger, letter to the editor, Austin Chronicle, https://www.austinchronicle.com/columns/1998-11-20/520630/ Acquiring the frequency In the summer of 1986, engineer Bob duTreil completed an engineering study for the broadcast license application, for which the fledgling station agreed to pay $2,500, the first of a number of debts incurred by the organization. An application dated July 4, 1986, was submitted to the FCC. That was rejected August 5, 1987; an additional $1,500 of engineering work was required to comply with FAA requirements, and the proposed tower height was lowered to 98 feet. There were also special requirements because of a non- interference treaty between the US and Mexico, although the tower site was more than 200 miles from the Mexican border.Washington DC: \\"Station of the Month - Austin Co-op Radio, NFCB News, n.d., p.8https://michaelbluejay.com/archive/savekoop/ On May 4, 1988, the Co-op Radio checking account was frozen for 90 days, for inability to pay the $7.50 monthly fee. They still owed more than $2,000 on their engineering study. On the same day, the University of Texas student newspaper, the Daily Texan, reported that the student assembly had approved $10,000 for a frequency search. On May 11, well known community radio lawyer John Crigler of the Washington firm Haley, Bader & Potts filed a motion to dismiss and replace Co- op's original application,https://www.radioworld.com/columns-and- views/community-broadcaster-thank-you-john-crigler and on June 1, the FCC stated that Co-op's (amended) application would be processed \\"in an expedited manner.\\" On July 25, 1988, the FCC's window for noncommercial license applications for the frequency closed. Two business days before that, The University of Texas filed a competing application, to be used for a student stationWashington DC: NFCB News, n.d., pp.7-8 The FCC awarded the license to KOOP, and the University appealed. In 1995, the FCC stopped using comparative hearings for deciding which applicant for a noncommercial educational radio frequency would win.Letter from John Crigler to KOOP General Manager Jenny Wong, November 4, 1998. File No. 0621-101-60 In the summer of 1992, the FCC ordered the two applicants to share the frequency. Both applicants rejected the regulator's plan that the stations should use the frequency on alternating days. By February 1993, they had negotiated the current time-sharing arrangement.KOOP also agreed to lease tower space from University station for $10,000 a year, for up to five years.Austin American-Statesman, February 25, 1993 Because the two stations were sharing the frequency, neither was eligible for a noncommercial radio equipment grant from the US Department of Commerce. Fires In early 2006, KOOP's 304 E. Fifth Street studio was hit by two fires. On 6 January a fire caused significant smoke damage; the station suspended operation for just five days and sought a new home. Before a site could be found, a second fire occurred on 4 February which destroyed KOOP's building and three adjacent structures that housed artist studios and a nightclub. Both fires were declared accidental. The first was blamed on careless smoking by a neighbor; the second, on the nightclub's faulty heating and air conditioning unit. The February fire knocked KOOP off the air for 17 days, during which time KVRX covered its sister station's hours, as it had following the original fire. KOOP resumed broadcasting on 21 February from studios at the city's classical music station KMFA. By the end of 2006, KOOP had found new quarters at 3823 Airport Boulevard, where it built two broadcast studios, two production rooms, a music library, meeting space and offices. The station began broadcasting from the facility on 9 December 2006. KOOP had been broadcasting from its new home for less than 13 months when it suffered yet another blaze. On 5 January 2008, a fire swept through the Airport Boulevard studios, causing an estimated $300,000 damage. Austin fire officials declared the incident arson and within weeks charged a former station volunteer, Paul Webster Feinstein, with setting the blaze. According to investigators, Feinstein had quit a month earlier following a dispute over the music lineup for the station's overnight webstream. On 12 June 2009, Feinstein pleaded guilty to setting the 2008 fire, and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment; however, as part of a plea agreement, Feinstein would serve 120 days at the Texas State Prison in Huntsville, pay $134,000 restitution, serve 10 years probation upon release from prison, and undergo community service and counseling. The station was back on the air within a few weeks, using studio space donated by Entercom Austin, which owns three of the city's commercial stations. KOOP returned to its Airport Boulevard studio in September 2008.

Locke, 1975, 96 S.Ct. 243, 423 U.S. 48, 46 L.Ed.2d 185. and bestiality.Andrews v. Vanduzer, N.Y.Sup. 1814 (January Term, 1814) (Vanduzer accused Andrews of having had connection with a cow and then a mare and the court understood this to mean that Vanduzer was going around telling others that Andrews had been guilty of the crime against nature with a beast. History and terminology For much of modern history, a \\"crime against nature\\" was understood by courts to be synonymous to \\"buggery\\", and to include anal sex (copulation per anum) and bestiality. Early court decisions agreed that fellatio (copulation per os) was not included, though mainly because that practice was virtually unknown when the common-law definition was established (it remained so rare that first attempted fellatio prosecutions under the \\"crime against nature\\" statute date to 1817 in England and 1893 in the United States.Rex v. Samuel Jacobs (1817); Prindle v. State of Texas, 21 S.W. 360 (1893)) Likewise, sexual activities between two women were not covered. Over time, particularly starting in the early 20th century, some jurisdictions started enacting statutes or developing precedents the extended the scope of the crime to include fellatio and, sometimes, other sexual activities. The term crime against nature is closely related to, and was often used interchangeably with, the term sodomy. (This varied from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Sometimes the two terms were understood to be synonymous; sometimes sodomy was limited to sexual activities between two humans; and sometimes sodomy was taken to include anal sex or bestiality, whereas crime against nature also included fellatio.) Until the early 19th century, courts were divided on whether the act needed to be completed (to result in ejaculation) in order to be a punishable offense. This question was deemed sufficiently important that, in 1828, English law was explicitly amended to specify that proof of ejaculation was not necessary for convictions for buggery and rape. The crime was not limited to same-sex activities, and, in case of an act between two adults, both participants were guilty, regardless of consent. Attempted or completed act of sodomy, committed by a husband against his wife, was grounds for divorce in common law. Historically, the offense was usually referred to by its longer name, the detestable and abominable (or abominable and detestable, or, sometimes, infamous) crime against nature, committed with mankind or beast. This phrase originates in Buggery Act 1533, with words \\"crime against nature\\" substituted for \\"vice of buggery\\" in the original, and it was present in one of these forms in criminal codes of most U.S. states. Specific acts included under this heading were typically deemed too detestable to list them explicitly, resulting in a number of vagueness-based legal challenges to corresponding statutes. One of the most recent, and one of the rare successful challenges, is the 1971 Florida case of Franklin v. State. On the other hand, just 7 years prior, a similar challenge (Perkins v. State) failed in North Carolina. (In Perkins, the Court wrote that, if this were a new statute, it would have been \\"obviously unconstitutional for vagueness\\", but, since this was a statute whose history was traceable back to the reign of Henry VIII, it accumulated a number of judicial interpretations, and, backed with these interpretations, it was not unconstitutionally vague.) Penalties for this offense varied greatly over time and between jurisdictions. Crime against nature remained punishable by death or life imprisonment both in the UK and in many U.S. states well into the 19th century. Liberalization of sexual morals led to reduction of penalties or decriminalization of the offense during the second half of the 20th century, so that, by 2003, it was no longer a punishable offense in 36 out of 50 U.S. states, and was only punishable by a fine in some of the remaining 14. (See Sodomy laws in the United States for details.) Current use Currently, the term crime against nature is still used in the statutes of the following American states. However, these laws are unconstitutional to enforce for sexual conduct between consenting adults in light of Lawrence v. Texas (2003). The crime against nature statutes are however still used to criminalize sexual conduct involving minors, incest, public sex, prostitution and bestiality. * Idaho (I.C. ¬ß 18-6605) * Louisiana (R.S. 14:89) (Struck down the part of the statute that criminalized adult consensual anal and oral sex by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in 2005) * Massachusetts (MGL Ch. 272, ¬ß 34) (Struck down the part of the statute that criminalized adult consensual anal and oral sex by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in 1974) * Michigan (MCL ¬ß 750.158) * Mississippi (Miss.

Furthermore, in 2003, in Lawrence v. Texas, the US Supreme Court held that nonremunerative sex between consenting adults in private was protected by the Constitution and could not be criminalized under \\"crimes against nature\\" laws.

Carlson et al., ‚ÄúSinjar ‚Äî ‹´‹ù‹ì‹™ ‚Äù in The Syriac Gazetteer last modified June 30, 2014, http://syriaca.org/place/184.) is a town in the Sinjar District of the Nineveh Governorate in northern Iraq. It is located about five kilometers south of the Sinjar Mountains. Its population in 2013 was estimated at 88,023. The town is predominantly populated by Yazidis. History=Antiquity= Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) province in the early Islamic era In the 2nd century AD, Sinjar became a military base called Singara and part of the Roman limes. It remained part of the Roman Empire until it was sacked by the Sasanians in 360. Starting in the late 5th century, the mountains around Sinjar became an abode of the Banu Taghlib, an Arab tribe. At the beginning of 6th century, a tribe called Qadi≈°aiƒì (KŒ±Œ¥ŒØœÉŒ∑œÖŒøŒπ) dwelt there. According to the early Islamic literary sources, Singara had long been a bone of contention between the Sasanian and Byzantine empires and several times switched hands between the two empires. A 6th-century sources describes the population of Singara being composed of Zoroastrians, Christians and Jews. There are few visible traces of the ancient town of Singara. =Islamic era= Qutb al-Din, the Zengid ruler of Sinjar in 1197‚Äì1219, with representation of Roman Emperor Caracalla, Sinjar mint 1199. Sinjar was conquered in the 630s‚Äì640s by the Arab Muslims led by the commander Iyad ibn Ghanm and thereafter incorporated into the Diyar Rabi'a district of the Jazira province. In 970, the city was conquered by the Hamdanid dynasty, a branch of the Banu Taghlib tribe. Toward the end of the century, another Arab dynasty, the Uqaylids captured the city and erected a citadel there. Beginning with the rule of the Turkmen atabeg Jikirmish in 1106/07, Sinjar entered its most prosperous historical period lasting through the mid-13th century. The Zengid ruler Nur ad-Din conquered the area in 1169 and 1171; in the latter year, a cadet branch of the Zengids was established in Sinjar under Zengi II (), whose court was noted for its high culture. The scholar Ibn Shaddad (d. 1186) noted that Sinjar was protected by a double wall, the first being the original wall built by the Uqaylids and the newer wall built by the local Zengid ruler Qutb ad-Din Muhammad (). Also noted by Ibn Shaddad were two mosques, six madrasas (schools of Islamic law) for the Hanafi and Shafi'i schools of jurisprudence, a mashhad (shrine) dedicated to Ali ibn Abi Talib and three khanqas (buildings for Sufi gatherings) and Ibn al-Adim (d. 1262) further notes a zawiya (Sufi lodge). A surviving mosque minaret from this era, remarked on by the 19th- century epigraphist Max van Berchem, contains an inscription crediting Qutb ad-Din as the minaret's builder in 1201. The city came under Ayyubid rule during the reign of Saladin and was controlled by the Ayyubid ruler of the Diyar Bakr district of the Jazira, al-Ashraf Muzaffar al-Din (). It later was controlled by the ruler of Mosul, Badr al-Din Lu'lu'. The Ilkhanid Mongols destroyed the double wall of Sinjar and the mashhad of Ali in 1262; the mashhad was rebuilt afterward by the Ilkhanid's Persian governor of the area Muhammad al-Yazdi. Ibn al-Adim and al-Dhahabi (d. 1348) list several Islamic scholars who hailed from Sinjar, including the polymath Ibn al-Akfani (d. 1348). The geographer Zakariya al-Qazwini (d. 1283) referred to Sinjar as \\"little Damascus\\", noting in particular the similarities of Sinjar's ornate bathhouses with their mosaic-laced floors and walls and octagonal stone pools. During his visit of the city, Ibn Batuta (d. 1369) remarked that Sinjar's congregational mosque was encircled by a perennial stream. The Timurid successors of the Ilkhanids captured Sinjar after a seven-month siege according to oral traditions cited by Evliya Celebi (d. 1682). The city was later conquered successively by the Turkmen tribes of Ak Koyunlu and Kara Koyunlu before being taken by the Safavid dynasty of Iran in 1507/08. During the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1532‚Äì1555), Sinjar was captured by the Constantinople (Istanbul)-based Ottoman Empire in 1534. The city became the center of its own sanjak (district) within Diyarbekir Eyalet (province of Diyarbakir). It was later reduced to being the administrative center of its own nahiya (subdistrict) of the Mardin Sanjak. Writing in the 17th century, Evliya Celebi noted that the population of the city of Sinjar was composed of Kurds and Arabs from the Banu Tayy tribe, while the Sinjar Mountains were inhabited by 45,000 Yazidis and Kurds. After 1830, the nahiya of Sinjar became part of the Mosul Sanjak. During the 19th century, the Yazidis of the Sinjar Mountains often posed a threat to travelers in the region. The governor Dawud Pasha of Baghdad (in office in 1816‚Äì1831) was unable to suppress the Yazidis and the Yazidi revolts of 1850‚Äì1864 were ended after the diplomatic efforts of the Ottoman statesman Midhat Pasha enabled the authorities to tax and impose customs in the area. Modern era The important Chermera temple (meaning '40 Men') is found on the highest peak of the Sinjar Mountains. In 1974‚Äì1975, five neighborhoods in the city of Sinjar were Arabized during a campaign by the Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein dubbed as a \\"modernization drive\\"; the neighborhoods were Bar Barozh, Saraeye, Kalhey, Burj and Barshey, whose inhabitants were relocated to the new towns or elsewhere in Iraq and replaced by Arabs. The majority of the Arabs resettled in the Sinjar Mountains have remained in the region as of 2010. On 13 August 2009, a suicide bombing killed 21 people and wounded 32 in a cafe in the Kalaa neighborhood of Sinjar. On 14 August 2010, a series of truck bombings by al-Qaeda in Iraq in the towns of Qahtaniya and al-Jazira, both in the Sinjar District, killed 326 Yazidis and injured 530 more. According to statistical survey of the Sinjar District in 2013, the city of Sinjar had a population of 77,926. The ethnic composition of the city consisted of Kurds, Arabs, Turkmens, and Assyrians and the religious composition consisted of Yazidis, Sunni Muslims, and Christians. There were 23 primary schools, three intermediate schools and seven secondary schools, a hospital, two other health care facilities, three public parks and two sports fields. The town had three churches, a Syriac Orthodox Church, Syriac Catholic Church, and Armenian Apostolic Church, all of which were destroyed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. = Northern Iraq Offensive (2014) = Sinjar after the reconquest of the so-called \\"Islamic State\\", December 2015 In the course of their second Northern Iraq offensive in August 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) took over large areas of Nineveh province. Following the withdrawal of the Kurdish Peshmerga they captured the city of Sinjar on 3 August. During the following days, IS militants perpetrated the Sinjar massacre, killing 2,000 Yazidi men and taking Yazidi women into slavery, leading to a mass exodus of Yazidi residents. According to a United Nations report, 5,000 Yazidi civilians were killed during ISIL's August offensive. It is also known as the genocide of Yazidis by ISIL. The genocide was enabled partly as a result of the Peshmerga flight from the ISIL offensive, which left the Yazidis defenseless. On the night of 20 December 2014, in the course of a first offensive to retake Sinjar from ISIL militants, Kurdish forces pushed into the city. However, the Kurdish advance into Sinjar was stalled, as they faced stiff resistance from ISIL militants inside the southern half of the city. On 13 November 2015, a day after launching a major second offensive, Kurdish forces and Yazidi militias backed by US airstrikes, entered the city and fully regained its control from ISIL. Following the recapture, in the nearby hamlet of Solagh, east of Sinjar city, Kurdish forces found a mass grave with the remains of at least 78 Yazidi women from Kocho village believed to be executed by ISIL militants. Following the recapture of Sinjar, Yazidi groups engaged in revenge looting and burnings targeting Sunni Muslims, as well as reprisal killings. =Declaration of autonomy= Yazidi fighters of the √äz√Ædxan Protection Force in Sinjar In August 2017, the Yazidis of Sinjar declared their government autonomous at a press conference. Peshmerga forces withdrew from Sinjar on October 17, 2017, allowing the Iraqi Army and the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU) to enter the town.

Initially assigned to the Channel Fleet, she spent much of her early career as flagship for the East Indies Station. She was reduced to reserve in 1912 after a lengthy refit before becoming the flagship of the Cape of Good Hope Station in 1913. After the beginning of World War I in August 1914, she spent the first few months of the war escorting convoys around South Africa. In early 1915, she was deployed to German East Africa to blockade the German light cruiser SMS K√∂nigsberg. She destroyed a German blockade runner attempting to bring supplies through the blockade in April and sank a German merchant vessel in early 1916. Hyacinth remained on the Cape Station for the rest of the war and was paid off in 1919, although she was not sold for scrap until 1923. Design and description The two 6-inch guns on her sister ship Hermess quarterdeck Hyacinth was designed to displace . The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of designed to give a maximum speed of . The engines were powered by 18 Belleville boilers.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 79 She carried a maximum of of coal and her complement consisted of 470 officers and ratings.Friedman 2012, p. 336 Her main armament consisted of 11 quick-firing (QF) Mk I guns.Friedman 2011, p. 87 One gun was mounted on the forecastle and two others were positioned on the quarterdeck. The remaining eight guns were placed port and starboard amidships.Friedman 2012, p. 171 They had a maximum range of approximately with their shells.Friedman 2011, pp. 87‚Äì88 Eight quick- firing (QF) 12-pounder 12 cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. One additional 12-pounder 8 cwt gun could be dismounted for service ashore. Hyacinth also carried six 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes, one on each broadside. The ship's protective deck armour ranged in thickness from . The engine hatches were protected by of armour. The main guns were fitted with 3-inch gun shields and the conning tower had armour 6 inches thick. Construction and service Hyacinth was laid down by London and Glasgow Shipbuilding Company at their shipyard in Govan, Scotland on 27 January 1897 and launched on 27 October 1898, when she was christened by Mrs. Richmond, wife of David Richmond, Lord Provost of Glasgow. She was completed on 7 December 1899. She served with the Channel Fleet under Captain Douglas Gamble, and took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII. In 1903 she relieved her sister Highflyer as flagship of the East Indies Station. In April 1904 she took part in the Somaliland Campaign, including supplying men for the landing party that stormed and captured the forts at Illig, the ship's guns supporting the attack.\\"The capture of the forts at Illig from the Mad Mullah, 21 April 1904\\", Paul G Lane. Orders & Medals Research Society Journal (Volume 59, number 2) June 2020. pp 152-156. She was in reserve at Devonport Royal Dockyard in 1906 until she again became flagship of the East Indies Station in February 1907. In December 1910, she was used to bombard the town of Dubai after a British search party had become pinned down by local forces protesting a British incursion to search for arms traders, the Hyacinth incident. She returned home in March 1911 for a refit at Chatham Royal Dockyard and was transferred to the reserve Third Fleet in February 1912. She recommissioned a year later for service as the flagship of the Cape of Good Hope Station, relieving her other sister, .Gardiner & Gray, p. 16 K√∂nigsberg in Dar es Salaam, 1914 Shortly before the beginning of the war, Rear-Admiral Herbert King-Hall, commander of the Cape Station, was ordered to find and shadow SMS K√∂nigsberg, based at Dar-es-Salaam, German East Africa. Two of his ships, including Hyacinth, spotted the German ship, but neither was fast enough to follow her. In early September she escorted the troopships transporting the garrison of the Cape Colony home up to the Central Atlantic before returning to the Cape.Corbett, Vol. I, pp. 152, 264 In November, King-Hall briefly transferred his flag to the armoured cruiser when his command was strengthened in anticipation of a battle with the German East Asia Squadron after its victory in the Battle of Coronel. Hyacinth hoisted his flag after Minotaur was ordered home as a result of the decisive victory over the German squadron in the Battle of the Falklands in early December 1914. When the predreadnought battleship Goliath arrived later that month, he transferred his flag to her and ordered Hyacinth north to German East Africa. She arrived at the end of January 1915 and blockaded K√∂nigsberg in the Rufiji delta. Goliath was ordered to the Dardanelles on 25 March and the ship again became King-Hall's flagship.Corbett, Vol. II, pp. 234‚Äì35, 238‚Äì39 1915: Hyacinth meets the German auxiliary ship Rubens on the coast of German East Africa. Rubens escapes into Manza Bay. On 14 April Hyacinth intercepted the captured British merchantman making an attempt to deliver supplies to German East Africa. The cruiser spotted her bound for Tanga, but was not able to board and capture her when one engine broke down. Rubens beached herself out of sight in Manza Bay, although Hyacinth set her afire. The fire was too hot for her cargo to be salvaged when Hyacinths crew approached the stranded ship. The Germans, however, were able to salvage a great deal of her cargo after the fire had burnt out.Corbett, Vol. III, pp. 8‚Äì9; Newbolt, Vol. IV, p. 80 Hyacinth remained on the Cape Station until the end of the war. On 23 March 1916 she sank the German merchant ship in Dar-es-Salaam. In January 1917 she was stationed off Tanganyika, where she served as the depot ship for the Royal Naval Air Service. On 6 January, Squadron Leader Edwin Moon was on a reconnaissance flight with Commander Richard Bridgeman as observer, when they were forced to land with engine trouble and came down in a creek of the Rufiji River delta. Moon and Bridgeman wandered for days in the river delta before eventually building a makeshift raft which was swept out to sea. Bridgeman died of exposure but Moon was blown back to shore where he was taken into captivity. Moon was awarded a bar to his Distinguished Service Order for the display of \\"the greatest gallantry in attempting to save the life of his companion\\", together with the Royal Humane Society's silver medal for his attempts to save Bridgeman's life and the Legion of Honour ‚Äì Croix de Chevalier. Bridgeman's body was recovered from the sea and is buried in Dar es Salaam Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery.

He is a right-handed middle order batsman who has also opened the innings. He holds the equal world record for the highest Test score (214) by a number three batsman on debut when he opened his international career against West Indies in the 1999 Boxing Day Test. Personal life Born in Katherine, Northern Territory, Australia, Sinclair moved to New Zealand with his mother after the death of his father in an accident when he was only five years old. Domestic career A right-handed middle-order batsman occasionally used as an opener, he played for Central Districts from the 1995‚Äì96 season, and in a period when the New Zealand cricket authorities were actively developing their infrastructure with the aim of raising the standards of the New Zealand team, he played for both Academy and A teams before making his Test debut. International career He scored 214 on his debut, against West Indies at Wellington in 1999, and followed that with 204 not out against Pakistan in the following summer. But despite this most promising of starts, Sinclair struggled to gain a permanent place in both the Test and one-day sides after disappointing scores. As a result, he was intermittently featured in the international squad, most recently being the One Day International against the West Indies at Eden Park in January 2009. An injury to Michael Papps in 2004/05 saw him called into the tour of Bangladesh as a 'makeshift' opener. His preferred position in the top of the middle-order was not available at the time. He did enough on that tour to gain selection for the tour to Australia where he had mixed results in the Tests, but not enough to maintain his spot when the Australians crossed the Tasman later that summer. His form in the ODIs in Australia was sufficient to retain his place for the return series, but he lost his place after averaging 15 in the first three matches. Retirement In July 2013 he announced his retirement from all cricket. At 37, after 18 seasons in the Central Districts side he is the team's all-time highest run-scorer, with more than 20,000 runs across all formats and remained a solid performer to the last, averaging over 40 in 2012-13.

By contrast, a coachman controls the horses from the vehicle itself. Originally the English name for a guide or forerunner for the post (mail) or a messenger, it became transferred to the actual mail carrier or messenger and also to a person who rides a (hired) post horse. The same persons made themselves available as a less expensive alternative to hiring a coachman, particularly for light, fast vehicles. Postilions draw ceremonial vehicles on occasions of national importance such as state funerals. On the battlefield or on ceremonial occasions postilions have control a coachman cannot exert. Mount Postilions ride the left or nearsideBecause horses are mounted from the horse's left side (the horse prefers no surprises) that side is nearest to the rider.

The display might extend to liveried men walking on foot beside each horse. Travel by post This style of travel was known as \\"posting\\".Rogers (1900), p. 278 The postilions and their horses (known as \\"post-horses\\")Rogers (1900), p. 282 would be hired from a \\"postmaster\\" at a \\"post house\\". The carriage would travel from one post house to the next (a journey known as a \\"stage\\"), where the postilions and/or spent (exhausted) horses could be replaced if necessary. In practice unless a return hire was anticipated a postilion of a spent team frequently was also responsible for returning them to the originating post house. Posting was once common both in England and in continental Europe.Rogers (1900), pp. 279‚Äì280 In addition to a carriage's obvious advantages (a degree of safety and shelter for the inside passengers and accessibility to non-riders) on long trips it tended to be the most rapid form of passenger travel. Individually mounted riders are subject to their personal endurance limits, while posting could continue indefinitely with brief stops for fresh horses and crew. In England, posting declined once railways became an alternative method of transport, but it remained popular in France and other countries. Artillery The gun detachments of the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery are each driven by a team of three post riders. The King's Troop is a ceremonial unit equipped with World War I veteran 13 pounder field guns drawn by six horses in much the same configuration as the guns of the 19th and early 20th century would have been. Officers and Senior Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) ride separately. The United States Army's Old Guard Caisson Platoon also rides postilion, as their predecessors did in the 19th Century, carrying cannon to war. The section sergeant, on a separate horse, is in charge of the team and there are 6 other horses teamed together, used at Arlington National Cemetery.

Miller, BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names (Oxford UP, 1971), p. 9. ) is a small village on the Isle of Man in the parish of the same name, in the sheading of Michael. It is the only village in the parish. The parish adjoins Jurby to the north, Lezayre to the east, Michael to the south and south-west, and the Irish Sea to the west. It stretches about 5 miles or 8 km from north to south: at the extreme southern end it includes part of Sulby Reservoir, and to the west, it includes part of Bishopscourt, the former house of the island's Bishop. Village The Raven public house The village is situated on the main A3 Castletown to Ramsey road (this part of which forms part of the Snaefell Mountain Course used during the annual TT and Manx Grand Prix races) about seven miles west of Ramsey. The road crosses Ballaugh Bridge, a hump-backed bridge, in the village. It is a favourite spectator spot and is always accessible via the A10 road and A13 road when the TT Course is closed for racing. There is one pub in Ballaugh ‚Äì the \\"Raven\\" ‚Äì and one convenience store, operated by Spar, which incorporates a post office. The village has one primary school, Ballaugh School, for children between the ages of 4 and 11. Currently the school has about 80 pupils. After year six pupils generally attend either Queen Elizabeth II High School in Peel or Ramsey Grammar School in Ramsey. A mile east of the village is Curraghs Wildlife Park, situated in Ballaugh Curraghs wetland, which is recognised by the Ramsar Convention. Ballaugh was only connected to the water mains in the early 1950s; until then most residents used the local wells, including one situated in the rear yard of Ellan Vannin, a former coach house with stabling beside the yard. The village had a station on the (long-closed) Manx Northern Railway. In recent years the village has expanded, with new housing estates to the north of the village centre. The north of the parish (roughly north and west of the A3 road) is a flat agricultural area. The remainder of the parish is hilly and partly used for coniferous plantations, reaching about 375 metres near the summit of Slieau Dhoo. Churches and chapels New parish church The Church of England parish church is St Mary's Church located in the village, although there are two churches, the old and the new. The old parish church of Ballaugh was located in what is now the hamlet of The Cronk, about 1.5 miles or 2.5 km north of the current village, on the treen (a subdivision of the parish) of Ballamona. In 1717, Thomas Wilson who was then the Bishop of Sodor and Man, added a simple baroque front and the church was lengthened by with a gable topped by a Bell-Cote added to the west end. Between 1757 and 1777, rear and side galleries were added. On 24 March 1830 the parishioners of the old Ballaugh church held a vestry meeting to vote on whether to relocate and build a new larger church closer to the village. The Bishop of Sodor and Man presided at the meeting. It was decided by a vote of 110 to 84 to relocate the church. The foundation stone was laid for the new church on Ballatersson just one month later by Bishop Ward; the cost of building the church was ¬£1,714. With the building of the new church, the old church fell into disrepair. It was restored in 1849 with a new roof, although the galleries and chancel extension were removed. It was further restored in 1877 and 1955 and has since been used regularly for services. The new church was last renovated in 1893. There have been a number of Methodist chapels in Ballaugh. Ballaugh (Ballaterson) Primitive Methodist Chapel closed in 1969 and since been demolished. The land on which the first Ballaugh Village Wesleyan Methodist Chapel stood was sold in 1778 to Thomas Clark for ¬£2. He conveyed the property to a group of trustees on 19 December 1791. After the chapel was built, it was soon found to be too small, and in 1806 additional land was provided to expand the chapel. In 1868 a new village Wesleyan Methodist Chapel was built and the first chapel was then used as a Sunday school and hall. However, in 1999 the second chapel was closed and services reverted to the hall. Ballaugh New (Ballakinnag) Wesleyan Methodist Chapel was built in 1898. It is now a garage. (Ballaugh) Curragh Wesleyan Methodist Chapel was originally built in 1815 and closed in 1971.

GeneRIFs provide a simple mechanism for allowing scientists to add to the functional annotation of genes described in the Entrez Gene database. In practice, function is constructed quite broadly. For example, there are GeneRIFs that discuss the role of a gene in a disease, GeneRIFs that point the viewer towards a review article about the gene, and GeneRIFs that discuss the structure of a gene. However, the stated intent is for GeneRIFs to be about gene function. Currently over half a million geneRIFs have been created for genes from almost 1000 different species. GeneRIFs are always associated with specific entries in the Entrez Gene database. Each GeneRIF has a pointer to the PubMed ID (a type of document identifier) of a scientific publication that provides evidence for the statement made by the GeneRIF. GeneRIFs are often extracted directly from the document that is identified by the PubMed ID, very frequently from its title or from its final sentence. GeneRIFs are usually produced by NCBI indexers, but anyone may submit a GeneRIF. To be processed, a valid Gene ID must exist for the specific gene, or the Gene staff must have assigned an overall Gene ID to the species. The latter case is implemented via records in Gene with the symbol NEWENTRY. Once the Gene ID is identified, only three types of information are required to complete a submission: # a concise phrase describing a function or functions (less than 255 characters in length, preferably more than a restatement of the title of the paper); # a published paper describing that function, implemented by supplying the PubMed ID of a citation in PubMed; # a valid e-mail address (which will remain confidential).  Example  Here are some GeneRIFs taken from Entrez Gene for GeneID 7157, the human gene TP53. The PubMed document identifiers have been omitted from the examples. Note the wide variability with respect to the presence or absence of punctuation and of sentence-initial capital letters. * p53 and c-erbB-2 may have independent role in carcinogenesis of gall bladder cancer * Degradation of endogenous HIPK2 depends on the presence of a functional p53 protein. * p53 codon 72 alleles influence the response to anticancer drugs in cells from aged people by regulating the cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1 * Logistic regression analysis showed p53 and COX-2 as dependent predictors in pancreatic carcinogenesis, and a reciprocal relationship to neoplastic progression between p53 and COX-2.

For example, ballroom cha-cha-cha is a syncopated dance in this sense, because the basic step \\"breaks on two\\". An example for a syncopated dance figure is the lockstep in quickstep and waltz. When dancing to the disparate threads contained within the music, hands, torso, and head can independently move in relation to a thread, creating a fluidly syncopated performance of the music. #The word \\"syncopation\\" is often used by dance teachers to mean improvised or rehearsed execution of step patterns that have more rhythmical nuances than \\"standard\\" step patterns.

Many dance teachers criticise the use of the term \\"syncopation\\" and abandon it in favour of the term \\"double-time\\".

Laos has the second largest Francophone community in Southeast Asia, the others being found in Vietnam and Cambodia. French is used as a diplomatic and commercial language and is also studied by over a third of students in Laos. History The French language was introduced to Laos in the 19th century when French explorers arrived in Laos trying to make inroads into China after colonizing Vietnam. The French did not pay much attention to the kingdom of Lan Xang but established a consulate in present-day Luang Prabang. The actual catalysts for the establishment of colonial protectorate over Lao cultural regions were French fears of economic and political competition from Britain.John Holt (2009). Page 79. Spirits of the Place: Buddhism and Lao Religious Culture. University of Hawaii Press. By the 1890s, border disputes with Siam and France led to the Franco-Siamese War and the borders of Laos and Siam were established in favor of France and Laos became a French protectorate. Unlike in Vietnam, the French did not pursue to fully exert their influence in Laos and it was not until the 1900s that French began to be introduced into schools in Laos, but it was mostly limited to Vientiane. However, French rule finally gained firmer ground and French soon became the primary language of government and education and the language spread into southern Laos following the founding of Pakse. The French language peaked between the 1910s and World War II and spread throughout the nation but, like Vietnam, was not widely spoken in most rural areas. French eventually became the language of government officials and the elite. When Japan invaded Laos in World War II, French remained in the educational system, unlike in Vietnam, where Vietnamese became the sole language of education, but the Lao language was briefly used in the government.Chieu, p. 309. French returned as the sole political language after France resumed its rule of Laos and was co-official with Lao when Laos was granted self-rule in 1949, but Lao became the sole official language after independence in 1953. The French language's decline was slower and occurred later than in Vietnam and Cambodia in Laos as the monarchy of Laos had close political relations with France. At the eve of the Vietnam War, the Secret War was beginning in Laos as political factions between communist Pathet Lao and the government occurred. Pathet Lao held areas used Lao as their sole language and following the end of the Vietnam War, French began its sharp decline in Laos. Additionally, many elite and French-educated Lao immigrated to nations such as the United States and France to escape government persecution. With the end of isolationism in the early 1990s however, the French language rebounded, thanks to the establishment of French, Swiss and Canadian relations and opening of French-language centers in central Laos. Today, French has a healthier status in Laos than the other Francophone nations of Asia and about 35% of all students in Laos receive their education in French, with the language being a required course in many schools. French is also used in public works in central and southern Laos and Luang Prabang and is a language of diplomacy and of the elite classes, higher professions and elders. However, the English language has continued to threaten the French language in Laos as it is seen as the language of international commerce and some schools have also made English a mandatory subject. Laos is also a member of La Francophonie. Characteristics The French spoken in Laos is based on standard Parisian French but has some minor differences in vocabulary as in other French dialects of Asia. Mixtures of Lao are sometimes added into French, giving it a local flavor. Some Lao words that have found their way into the French language are used in Laos as well. There are some notable differences between Lao and standard French such as: * The word can be used to refer to any street, road, avenue and highway unlike standard French which also uses or . * The incorporation of Lao words into French when referring to native Lao topics such as food, plants, etc. See also * French language in Vietnam * French language in Cambodia * French Laos ReferencesExternal links * Official website of La Francophonie Laos Category:Languages of Laos Category:French dialects ","title":"French language in Laos"},{"id":"3960788","text":"Remy Zero is a 1996 self-titled album by Remy Zero, and was produced for Geffen Records.

Pair of Moccasins, early 20th century. Brooklyn Museum A soft-soled moccasin A moccasin is a shoe, made of deerskin or other soft leather, consisting of a sole (made with leather that has not been \\"worked\\") and sides made of one piece of leather, stitched together at the top, and sometimes with a vamp (additional panel of leather). The sole is soft and flexible and the upper part often is adorned with embroidery or beading. Though sometimes worn inside, it is chiefly intended for outdoor use. Historically, it is the footwear of many indigenous people of North America; moreover, hunters, traders, and European settlers wore them. Etymologically, the moccasin derives from the Algonquian language Powhatan word makasin (cognate to Massachusett mohkisson / mokussin, Ojibwa makizin, Mi'kmaq mks…®n), and from the Proto-Algonquian word *maxkeseni (shoe).

In the 1800s, moccasins usually were part of a Canadian regalia, e.g. a powwow suit of clothes. The most common style is that of the Plains Indians moccasin. Moccasins protect the foot while allowing the wearer to feel the ground. The Plains Indians wore hard-sole moccasins, given that their territorial geography featured rock and cacti. The eastern Indian tribes wore soft-sole moccasins, for walking in leaf-covered forest ground.  Contemporary use  In New Zealand and Australia, sheep shearers' moccasins are constructed of a synthetic, cream-colored felt, with a back seam and gathered at the top of the rounded toe. These moccasins are laced in the front, and the lacing is covered with a flap fastened with a buckle at the shoe's outer side. The fastener arrangement prevents the shearer's handpiece comb from catching in the laces. Shearers' moccasins protect the feet, grip wooden floors well, and absorb sweat. The word moccasin can also denote a shoe of deer leather adorned with laces. =Driving moccasins= A driving moccasin (driving moc) is a contemporary version of the traditional Native American moccasin with the addition of rubber tabs on the sole. The addition of rubber- pad sole adds to the versatility and longevity of the shoe while maintaining the flexibility and comfort of a traditional moccasin. They were invented for men who wanted extra grip while driving. There are two variations of the sole, including: *Rubber-dotted - These have a uniform covering of small, round rubber pads. * Separated Pad - These have larger, flat rubber pads separated by only small areas. = Work boot moccasins = Moc Toe Boots, commonly referred as a \\"Moc Toe\\", the boots are normally combined with hard rubber compounded soles.

Influenced by \\"Populuxe\\" architecture, it is an example of the Mid-century modern design movement later to become known as \\"Googie\\". The Airport Theme Building Exterior and Interior was designated as a historic-cultural monument in 1993 by the city.  Architecture  The distinctive white building resembles a flying saucer that has landed on its four legs. The initial design was created by James Langenheim, of Pereira & Luckman, subsequently taken to fruition by a team of architects and engineers headed by William Pereira and Charles Luckman, that also included Paul Williams and Welton Becket. The appearance of the building's signature crossed arches as homogeneous structures is a design illusion, created by topping four steel-reinforced concrete legs extending approximately 15 feet above the ground with hollow stucco-covered steel trusses. To counteract earthquake movements, the Theme Building was retrofitted in 2010 with a tuned mass damper without changing its outward appearance. Constructed near the beginning of the Space Age, the building is an example of how aeronautics and pop culture, design and architecture came together in Los Angeles.  History  The original design for the airport created by Pereira & Luckman in 1959 had all the terminal buildings and parking structures connected to a huge glass dome, which would serve as a central hub for traffic circulation. The plan was eventually scaled down considerably, and the terminals were constructed elsewhere on the property. The Theme Building was subsequently built to mark the spot intended for the dome structure, as a reminder of the original plan. There are conflicting reports to whether the restaurant once had a 360 degree rotating floor when it originally opened. However, that is only legend and LAX officials confirmed the restaurant never revolved, yet because of its appearance and views, many visitors ‚Äúthink it revolves.‚Äù The structure was dedicated on June 25, 1961, by Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. The Los Angeles City Council designated the building, which lies within the Westchester neighborhood of the city of Los Angeles, a historic-cultural monument (no. 570) in 1993. A $4 million renovation, with retro-futuristic interior and electric lighting designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, was completed before the Encounter Restaurant opened there in 1997. Visitors are able to take an elevator up to the Observation Level to get a 360-degree view of arriving and departing planes.Kreuzer, Nikki \\"Offbeat L.A.: Sexy Space Age ‚Äì The Theme Building at LAX\\", The Los Angeles Beat, May 30, 2013. After the September 11 attacks, the Observation Level was closed for security reasons. Following a $12.3 million restoration of the building completed in 2010, the observation level re-opened to the public on Saturdays and Sundays starting July 10. Additionally, on September 9, 2003, a permanent memorial honoring those who perished in the attacks of September 11 was opened on the grounds of the Theme Building. The Encounter Restaurant closed for business in December 2013 with no future plans to reopen, although the building's observation level is still open on weekends. Previously, the restaurant was closed in March 2007 for repairs after a half-ton piece of the stucco skin on the upper arches crashed onto the roof of the restaurant, and reopened on November 12, 2007. Delaware North Companies Travel Hospitality Services operated the restaurant. The restaurant being in a non-secure area of the airport, where travelers are reluctant to spend time when a possibly lengthy security checkpoint lay ahead, or leave after being screened and have to go through security again upon returning, was cited as a reason for closing. In 2018, the Bob Hope USO at LAX relocated to the ground floor of the Theme Building, opening a 7,100 square foot facility described by its president as \\"the most technologically advanced USO in existence.\\" See also *Niter√≥i Contemporary Art Museum References External links  *Theme Building ‚Äì via USC *Theme Building via Emporis Category:Buildings and structures in Los Angeles Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1961 Category:Googie architecture Category:Googie architecture in California Category:Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments Category:Los Angeles International Airport Category:Modernist architecture in California Category:Towers in California Category:William Pereira buildings Category:Westchester, Los Angeles Category:Retrofuturism Category:Paul Williams (architect) buildings ","title":"Theme Building"},{"id":"3960875","text":"Location of Slepotice in the Czech Republic Slepotice is a village in the Pardubice Region of the Czech Republic.

Overview The protagonist of the game is a boy named Clayton, whose scientist father has developed a serum that can transform people into animals when it's combined with clay. Suddenly, Jobo the witch doctor appears and demands the formula for the serum. The father refuses, to which Jobo replies by changing Clayton into a ball of clay and stealing away both his father and the serum. Clayton vows to save his father in spite of his new form and embarks on a journey through his backyard, the Pacific, Japan, Africa, and finally outer space. The player uses samples of serum lying around in these levels to transform into one of five different animals (Muckster the Cat, Doh- Doh the Duck, Oozy the Mouse, Goopy the Guppy, and Globmeister the Gopher) to best fit with the environment and make it to the end of the level. Special abilities that are in a clay ball transform Clayton into helpful animals as he races the clock to collect as much as possible and still make it to the end, jumping over obstacles and attacking with the animal in use.

They number approximately 1,000 and form a well-established and homogeneous religious, cultural and linguistic minority. The Tatars are the oldest Muslim minority in Finland and in the Nordic countriesKookas.fi: Keit√§ ovat tataarit? and operate the Finnish Islamic Congregation, the oldest state-recognised Muslim congregation in the Western world. Finnish Tatars (mainly Mishar Tatars) have their historical origins in Eastern Europe and their language belongs to the Turkic language family.  History  During the early years of Finland's status as an autonomous Grand Duchy under the Russian Tsars, Tatars were already being employed by the Russians at the construction of the Bomarsund fortress in √Öland and at the Suomenlinna sea fortress off the coast of Helsinki. Most of those returned to Russia. For the ones who did not, an Islamic cemetery in Bomarsund bears witness to their presence in Finland. The ancestors of the present-day Tatars came to Finland from the 1870s to the mid-1920s from a group of some 20 villages in the Sergachsky District on the Volga River, to the southeast of Nizhny Novgorod. Most of them had been farmers but they settled in Finland as merchants trading in furs and textiles and chose initially to reside in Helsinki and its surrounding area. Tatars living in the city of Vyborg on the Karelian Isthmus resettled in Tampere and Helsinki when the area was ceded to the Soviet Union in the Moscow Peace Treaty of 1940. Most Finnish Tatars continue to live in Helsinki and its surroundings.Tatar Cultural Association  Finnish Islamic Congregation  In 1925, the Finnish Islamic Congregation () was founded. Finland was thus the first Western European country to officially recognise an Islamic congregation.Leskinen, M. & J. Keronen. Secret Helsinki. Jonglez Publishing, 2019. The Finnish Freedom of Religion Act had been adopted in 1922. Today, the congregation has mosques in Helsinki and J√§rvenp√§√§. A second congregation of Tatars was established in Tampere in 1943. Non-Tatar Muslims may worship at, but cannot become members of, the Finnish Islamic Congregation. There are Tatar Islamic cemeteries in Helsinki, Turku and Tampere.  Modern day  The Tatars are fully integrated into Finnish society and they are actively engaged in Finnish economic and cultural life in a wide array of professions. At the same time, they have succeeded in maintaining a distinct identity and in keeping the Tatar language alive by using it in family and private circles and also in their cultural organisations. Since 1935, the Tatar Cultural Society has organised principally Tatar-language cultural events in the form of plays, folk music, folk dancing and poetry recitals. The pride of the sports club, Yolduz, established in 1945, is its football team. Both the cultural society and the sports club operate with the support of the Islamic Congregation, which thus contributes to the maintenance of the Tatar culture and language. One notable Finnish Tatar is the former soccer player Atik Ismail. From 1948 to 1969 there was a Tatar primary school in Helsinki, which was partly subsidised by the Islamic Congregation and partly by the City of Helsinki. About half of the teaching was in Finnish and half in Tatar. Reform of the Finnish school system in the 1970s made the school unviable due to the small number of pupils and the conditions governing state subsidies. Instead, during the autumn and spring terms after school hours, the Islamic Congregation provides regular teaching of Tatar language, culture, religion and history, with Tatar as the language of instruction. A Tatar kindergarten has existed since the 1950s. Summer courses in Tatar are now held at the Tatar Training Centre in Kirkkonummi, near Helsinki. It is remarkable that the small group of Finnish Tatars has managed to preserve proficiency in the Tatar language for as long as five generations. The publishing activity of the Tatars was once extensive but has now ceased. Past publications include religious texts, poetry, plays, novels as well as periodicals, the earliest from 1925.

He first served the Date clan as a junior page under Date Masamune's father Terumune. Then, on End≈ç Motonobu's recommendation, he became Masamune's personal attendant, and was heavily relied upon as a strategist. Kagetsuna would soon become deeply trusted by his lord, as the following anecdote illustrates: Masamune, in his first battle, suddenly found himself surrounded; he was only saved when Kagetsuna arrived on the scene shouting \\"I am Masamune!\\" („Çè„Çå„Åì„Åù„ÅåÊîøÂÆó„Å™„Çä; Ware koso ga Masamune nari), distracting the enemy long enough for Masamune to escape. Kagetsuna fought in most of Masamune's major battles, including the Battle of Hitotoribashi in 1586, Battle of Koriyama in 1588, Battle of Suriagehara in 1589, Odawara in 1590, the Korean campaign in 1590, and Sekigahara in 1600. He also assisted in the Date clan's administrative duties, serving as castle warden of Nihonmatsu Castle, lord of ≈åmori Castle, Watari Castle, and others. Kagetsuna played a key role in the survival of the Date clan in 1590, by recommending that Masamune submit to Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the Odawara Campaign. Following the Odawara Campaign, Hideyoshi granted Kagetsuna the 50,000 koku fief of Tamura. This made Kagetsuna a daimy≈ç in his own right; however, soon after taking possession of the fief, he returned it, in a show of loyalty to his master.Katakura Nobumitsu. \\"Katakura Koj≈´r≈ç,\\" in Rekishi to Tabi Vol. 11 \\"Shohan Mei-kar≈ç Hyakusen\\" (Tokyo:n.p., 1975), p. 81. Two years after Sekigahara, when Masamune was made lord of Sendai, Kagetsuna was granted Shiroishi Castle (ÁôΩÁü≥Âüé Shiroishi-j≈ç), and a stipend of 13,000 koku. This was a special exception to the Tokugawa Shogunate's newly passed ikkoku ichij≈ç (‰∏ÄÂõΩ‰∏ÄÂüé; \\"One Castle per Territory\\") rule. The Katakura clan, as senior retainers of the Sendai domain, would remain in Shiroishi as local lords for the next two centuries, spanning over 11 generations. As Kagetsuna was ill, he was unable to join Masamune at the Osaka Winter Campaign of 1614, choosing to send his son Shigenaga in his stead. Kagetsuna died the following year at age 60, and was buried with the posthumous name of Sanzan J≈çei (ÂÇëÂ±±Â∏∏Ëã±). Upon Kagetsuna's death, six of his retainers were so deeply grieved that they committed junshi (ÊÆâÊ≠ª; suicide to follow one's lord in death).

Although at times she finds nifty tricks to multitask and consolidate household chores (like vacuuming the rug and waxing the wooden floor all at once), she is awfully clumsy and gets herself into sticky situations from losing control (some hardcore fans consider her a total idiot to begin with).

She often steps out on shopping trips and afternoon teas with her good friends Mrs. Mizushima and Mrs. Toyama (collectively they call themselves the \\"Madam D√©jeuner Club\\"). Additionally, they often take part in activities with (the more affluent) Mrs. Misumi. They often envy Mrs. Misumi's \\"rich\\" lifestyle and try to find \\"affordable ways\\" to be more stylish and upbeat (and often, the three \\"Madam D√©jeuner Club\\" members tend to embarrass Mrs. Misumi with their louder personalities) Her hobbies include shod≈ç and cooking and eating chikuwa.

Although she had a childhood friend (that she liked a lot and hoped to marry), she was placed into an Omiai arranged marriage and married Father. She is also a very strict mother to her two children, and tries to have them waste less money/electricity/food, etc. Although she tries to make herself look more upbeat, she is very patriarch-ist when it comes to her daughter Mikan.

She is sweet on her younger son, however, and often lets him slide with things Mikan can't get away with. She is also known for her own hypocrisy and downright ignorant. She doesn't want to admit her own mistakes for whatever reason. In one episode, Mikan was angry for her exaggerating Mikan's bad habit by telling her to admit her worst habits (slurping spaghetti as fast as she can in a rude manner), but she won't budge. ; Voiced by: Fumiko Orikasa A 17-year-old second-year high school student, and is the intended \\"main protagonist\\" of the series. (The \\"atashi\\" (me) in the title.) She goes to school in a public high school, which unfortunately is a long, stressful commute away. It also doesn't require school uniforms. She is portrayed as an easy-going, relaxed girl who likes to have fun. Often very maiden-like, but other times very tomboyish, she goes through every day with something funny happening. Her best friends in high school consist of the \\"adult\\"-like Shimi- chan (her last name Shimizu), who always stays calm and collected, and always has good advice from diets to dealing with parents; and Yukarin (her first name Yuka), who loves karaoke and introduces Mikan to the \\"cuter\\" things in life. Mikan has a crush on the bish≈çnen-type Iwaki. Although she wants to confess her feelings to him, she is often foiled by his best friend, Yoshioka, whose wisecracks get under Mikan's skin. What's worse is that Mikan and Yoshioka have attended the same academies since Elementary School, and people (including her own Mother) persuade her to date Yoshioka. At times, when she looks in the direction of Iwaki and Yoshioka, Shimi-chan gets the wrong idea and assumes Mikan is staring at Yoshioka, not Iwaki. (In the Shin Atashin'chi reboot, Shimi-chan is fully aware of Mikan's feelings for Iwaki‚Äîand in one episode, a dream sequence shows that she in fact holds her own torch for Yoshioka) She \\"gets-by\\" in school, is horrible at taking notes, and is a heavy sleeper, which unfortunately makes her late to school. She also has a habit of falling asleep through homework assignments, causing her to have no choice but to submit incomplete assignments. Her interests include karaoke, eating sweets (although she dislikes chocolate cake), and admiring/creating teddy bears. She is part of her high school's \\"Bear Brigade\\" (composed of the wealthy, fashionable Rio; the geeky-yet-romantically-involved Nitta; and best friends Kajii and Asada), who create original teddy bears, perform teddy bear acts, and admire expensive teddy bear toys. Her goal in life is to become a famous teddy bear and/or fashion designer. According to her mother, she taught herself how to sew on buttons (through observation) at the age of 3. She once fancied being a breadmaker, but lost interest soon after. She is often bogged down by her Mother's rules, which inhibit her allowance, her fashions, her curfew, and mostly‚Äîher simple boxed lunches. She is frustrated that her Mother lets her younger brother get away with some rules, however, she often (and cleverly) makes her case. ; Voiced by: Daisuke Sakaguchi A second-year junior high school student who is very studious and forward-thinking. He is innovative and his brain far exceeds his age. He tends to find solutions to the family's (common) mishaps. Yuzuhiko is far more intelligent than Mikan. He enjoys playing video games and listening to music. His secret pastime is admiring the fictional idol Marumi Maruno. He collects photos, magazines, and keepsakes related to her. However, he keeps this secret from his family (in fear of ridicule) and his friends (since they prefer other idols aside from Maruno). He has a love for mayonnaise, and is very picky about which brand his penny pinching mother buys. Although he reveres in the fact that his Mother is sweet on him, he hates all the attention she gives him. He prefers to be treated more as an adult, and to not be called \\"Yuu-chan\\" anymore. At school, he does well and gets very good marks, but is often intimidated by his teacher, Miss Hara. He also has many friends, and is seen as one of the more popular students. His best friend is Fujino, who shares his interests in books, music, and games. However, Fujino is seen as more of a boke to Yuzuhiko's tsukkomi, by acting very immature and childish. Fujino has a crush on Mikan, which disturbs Yuzuhiko. (He even goes as far as to tell Fujino about Mikan's \\"disgusting\\" traits, only to get caught and scolded loudly by Mikan.) His other friends include the self-centered Nasuo (last name Arai in the manga and first anime version, Nasuno in the reboot), who at one point shared his love for Marumi Maruno; the popular girl Sudou, who makes friends with everyone; and the \\"unique\\" Yuri Ishida, whose appearance and weird quirks seem to repel the other classmates, yet attract the attention of Yuzuhiko, Fujino, and Sudou. He also has a \\"Fan Club\\", which was founded by Kawashima (first name Sayu, in the manga only), who has a strong crush on Yuzuhiko. She comes up with many ways to convey her feelings to him, but those plans always get foiled, often by Yuri Ishida. She considers Ishida to be her \\"rival\\", even though Ishida shows no interest in Yuzuhiko. At times, she gets into situations where Yuzuhiko \\"saves\\" her (by catching her when she falls, or bumps into him), which result in a lovestruck scurry. The other member of the \\"Fan Club\\" is her best friend, Yamashita. Yamashita is often the voice of reason or gives her the (much-needed) reality check that calms Kawashima down. Additionally, only Yamashita is comfortable enough to actually initiate conversation with Yuzuhiko. In one note-worthy moment, after seeing Yuzuhiko's caricature drawing of Kawashima (which turned out terrible), Kawashima gave up her feelings for him, but after Yuzuhiko's apology and explanation that he intended the doodle to be \\"cute\\", Kawashima regained her feelings. Aside from his nickname, Yuzupii, the \\"Fan Club\\" refer to him by the code name \\"Hibari- chan\\" (Little Skylark). This comes from a mass string of word association.

The College is the direct descendant of the Princely Academy of Saint Sava, which was divided in 1864 by Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza into the University of Bucharest and the present high school. During the Communist era, its name was changed to Nicolae BƒÉlcescu High School. The name of the College comes from the Monastery of Saint Sabbas the Sanctified in Bucharest, in which it has been founded. To this day, it celebrates its birthday on 5 December, the feast day of Saint Sabbas the Sanctified.  History  In the 17th century Saint Sava was actually an old monastery built in Bucharest's historic centre, in the proximity of today's University Square. It was in the rooms of this monastery that Romania's first higher education institution was set up. The founding of this college in the late 17th century was brought about by a strong European influence, mostly Italian, that encouraged the rise of the national spirit. This assertion of a national awareness had the firm support of many writers and historians of the age. In Wallachia (Southern Romania), the most remarkable representative of this trend was Constantin Cantacuzino, a writer and a boyar, who had been educated in Padua, Italy. He was a widely‚àítravelled aristocrat and adviser to Prince »òerban Cantacuzino. As Constantin Cantacuzino was determined to have a college similar to the Italian ones set up in Bucharest, his brother's coming to power in 1678 made it possible for him to achieve his goal. Saint Sava Princely Academy was therefore created by Wallachia's reigning Prince ≈ûerban Cantacuzino and it was placed under the aegis of the Prince and of Dositheos II, Patriarch of Jerusalem. Cultural and religious allegiance accounted for the fact that tuition was carried on in modern Greek, a symbol of Byzantine civilization. The first principal of the school was Sebastos Kyminitis, who had been educated in Constantinople. Saint Sava Academy thrived during the reign of Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu's, who sketched out the curriculum and ensured the funds needed to run the school. A law given in 1707 demanded that \\"teachers should be understanding and principled; they should also have excellent reputation\\".

It first appeared in Unix v7. The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system. Overview expr evaluates integer or string expressions, including pattern matching regular expressions. Each symbol (operator, value, etc.) in the expression must be given as a separate parameter. Most of the challenge posed in writing expressions is preventing the invoking command line shell from acting on characters intended for expr to process. Syntax Syntax: The operators available * for integers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus * for strings: find regular expression, find a set of characters in a string; in some versions: find substring, length of string * for either: comparison (equal, not equal, less than, etc.) Example The following is an example involving boolean expressions: expr length \\"abcdef\\" \\"<\\" 5 \\"\\" 15 - 4 \\">\\" 8 This example outputs \\"1\\". This is because length \\"abcdef\\" is 6, which is not less than 5 (so the left side of the  returns zero). But 15 minus 4 is 11 and is greater than 8, so the right side is true, which makes the or true, so 1 is the result. The program exit status is zero for this example. For pure arithmetic, it is often more convenient to use bc. For example: echo \\"3*4+14/2\\"  bc since it accepts the expression as a single argument.

Seeking to strengthen the bond between the Labour Party and the Israeli Labor Party, it organises meetings of senior figures in both the UK and Israel. =2000‚Äì2015= In 2003, LFI described itself as \\"a Westminster based lobby group working within the British Labour Party to promote the State of Israel\\". It has been described as \\"less unquestioning in its support of the Israeli government than the Conservative Friends of Israel\\". Between 2001 and 2009, LFI sponsored more than 60 MPs to visit Israel, more than any other group. In 2010, Jennifer Gerber, previously director of Progress and before that, special advisor to Andy Burnham, was appointed director. In 2011, LFI adopted a new strategy of becoming a wider membership organisation and of operating under the slogan \\"Working Towards a Two-State Solution\\". In 2011, John Woodcock was appointed chair, followed in May 2013 by Dame Anne McGuire and, in 2015, Joan Ryan. In 2014, Adrian Cohen, a corporate lawyer, the chair of the London Jewish Forum, a trustee of the Jewish Leadership Council and a deputy of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, was appointed Lay Chair. =2016 onwards= With the ascent to the leadership of the Labour Party, in September 2015, of Jeremy Corbyn, who has a history of support for Palestinians, the relationship between the LFI and the party leadership became more complicated. LFI had been depleted of Parliamentary supporters who had lost their seats at the 2015 general election. In 2016, LFI announced it had trebled its number of Parliamentary supporters, at a time when many moderate MPs rebelled against the leadership of the party, stating that 65 MPs had pledged to back the group. LFI re-branded itself as \\"Labour Friends of Israel: For Israel, For Palestine, For Peace\\", created a Young LFI group, and stated it would support the Alliance for Middle East Peace‚Äôs international fund. In early 2017, Al Jazeera released a four-part documentary entitled The Lobby, which investigated aspects of the Israel lobby in the United Kingdom, particularly relating to the Labour Party. A member of Israeli embassy staff, Shai Masot, was recorded \\"plotting\\" to take down British MPs who favour recognition of a Palestinian state; links to the Labour Friends of Israel were put under the spotlight, including a reference to the availability of ¬£1m from the Israeli government. In March 2018, supporters of LFI, along with the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council, took part in a protest critical of the Corbyn leadership, stating that antisemitism was present in the Labour Party. In February 2019, after having lost a vote of no confidence by her local constituency Labour Party, Joan Ryan resigned from the Labour Party to join the recently formed The Independent Group but retained her position as Chair of LFI. She became Honorary President in August 2019 and Dame Louise Ellman succeeded her as Parliamentary Chair. In October 2019, Ellman resigned from the Labour Party. Neither stood for reelection in the 2019 General election. However, despite resigning from the Labour Party, they remained members of LFI. As of July 2020, around a quarter of the Parliamentary Labour Party and a third of the shadow cabinet were members of the group LFI. In September 2020, Jennifer Gerber steppd down as director and was replaced by Michael Rubin. In September 2020, LFI doubled its number of vice-chairs to 11, with six additional MP's announced to join the team. The incoming vice-chairs were: Rosie Cooper, Chris Evans , Dame Diana Johnson, Peter Kyle, Conor McGinn and Catherine McKinnell. =Related groups= Labour Friends of Israel is distinct from the Jewish Labour Movement (successor to the UK's Poale Zion) and Jewish Voice for Labour. The Yigal Allon Educational Trust, founded in 1985 by former Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Ian Mikardo MP, Lord Glenamara and others, has supported Labour Friends of Israel.

As it was produced in Australia, the Cartoon Network and later Boomerang broadcasts were sourced from PAL masters, rather than NTSC masters like many other Hanna-Barbera productions.

The difference is that Kwicky moves at super-speed, which looks more like vanishing into thin air with an accompanying \\"beep\\" sound effect, much like Speedy Gonzales (the animation shortcut used to facilitate this often went to extremes by making Kwicky disappear from one spot and reappear instantly in the next, with no intermediate smear frames).

The label specialized in what became known as 'Atmospheric' or 'Intelligent' Drum & Bass, very much 'spacey' synthesizer driven with elements of jazz & soul although some releases have a more darker amen break style to them. The label is synonymous for its crystal clear-pin sharp production & lavish sci-fi influenced record covers which were a trademark of the label. After the label's mid 2000s hiatus all 12\\" singles issued after were housed in a plain grey card sleeve with the label's logo on the front cover. Some of the label's Drum & Bass releases went under the banner of Looking Good Records. These also featured identical sci-fi influenced sleeves, not unlike those on Good Looking. The only difference between the two was the Good Looking releases had a yellow spine while the Looking Good had a Royal Blue spine. Artists who have released on this label include LTJ Bukem, Blame (music producer) Photek, Blu Mar Ten, Seba, Source Direct, Makoto, Future Engineers, Big Bud, Nookie, Q Project, Blame, PFM, Peshay, Intense, Artemis, Tayla, Phazer, MC Conrad, New Balance, Greg Packer and Vice Versa. In the UK around 1990 the dance music sounds of \\"house\\" and \\"acid house\\" had evolved into \\"hardcore\\" and \\"breakbeat techno\\" and \\"rave culture\\". What was later referred to as \\"drum & bass\\" and \\"jungle\\" developed as offshoots from the \\"rave\\" scene. Through DJing at such raves with acclaim LTJ Bukem naturally turned his hand to production. In 1990 he produced his first track \\"Demons Theme\\". Bukem soon grew frustrated with the lack of control over his own recordings, so in 1991 he formed his own label Good Looking Records. Early Good Looking tracks like \\"Atlantis\\" and \\"Music\\" provided a soulful, melodic alternative to the prevailing hardcore tracks then in vogue. By 1994, LTJ Bukem had formed his second label Looking Good Records and begun the formation of an artist collective including Peshay, Aquarius (aka Photek), Blu Mar Ten, Blame, Nookie & Tayla, ‚Äî similarly inclined towards melodicism and epic expanses of sound. In 1994 Bukem also launched the legendary club night \\"Speed\\" at the Mars Bar in order to promote Good Looking's approach to sound. With Bukem & Fabio playing breakbeat records while MC Conrad provided verbal gymnastics, it soon became one of the most popular clubs in London. In 1996 the release of Logical Progression signalled Good Looking's commitment to the drum & bass and jungle community providing shelter for a unique band of producers. In 1996 Good Looking introduced the Earth series of compilations. The Earth series showcases a range of mid-tempo musical styles from hip-hop, lounge, cosmic funk, and future soul, jazz and house music. The most recent volume ‚Äì Earth 7 featured a DVD with 5.1 DTS surround sound. 1998 saw the release of the first Progression Sessions mix CD. These live recordings capture the vibe of the Progression Sessions tours & residencies from around the world. Now in its 10th edition the Progression Sessions series documents the musical direction of Good Looking Records through the years and illustrates the live element brought to each event through the complementary pairing of LTJ Bukem's music and the vocals of MC Conrad. Into the 2000s, Good Looking Records continued to release further Progression Sessions mix CDs, compilation CDs and vinyl. The last release, the 76th in the vinyl catalogue, took place in 2009.

McSherry wore uniform number 9 when he entered the National League, then wore number 10 from 1979 through the rest of his career. A respected arbiter, he was one of several umpires who were noticeably overweight. McSherry was officially listed at and . McSherry died from cardiac arrest which occurred behind home plate during the opening game of the 1996 Major League Baseball season in Cincinnati on April 1, 1996. Umpiring career=Post-season games= McSherry umpired in the World Series in 1977 and 1987. He also officiated in the National League Championship Series in 1974, 1978, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1988, 1990, and 1992, and in the National League Division Series in 1981 and 1995. =All-Star Games= McSherry worked the 1975, 1982, and 1991 All-Star Games, for which the umpiring crew consisted of three American League umpires and three National League umpires during the years 1949 to 1999. =Other notable games= * Home plate umpire during the game on May 4, 1975, where Houston Astros first baseman Bob Watson scored MLB's one millionth run in a game against the San Francisco Giants at Candlestick Park. Watson reached the milestone by scoring on a three-run homer from Milt May. * Home plate umpire for no-hitter thrown by Houston Astros right-hander Larry Dierker on July 9, 1976 at Houston. * Home plate umpire for the sixth and final game of the 1977 World Series, in which Yankees slugger Reggie Jackson belted three home runs off three different Los Angeles Dodgers pitchers at Yankee Stadium on the way to an 8-4 victory. After Jackson's first home run off Burt Hooton, Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda came to the mound to make a pitching change. Lasorda asked McSherry who he should summon from the bullpen; McSherry suggested that Lasorda go with right-hander El√≠as Sosa. Sosa gave up Jackson's second home run in the fifth inning. Knuckleballer Charlie Hough gave up the third shot in the eighth inning. * First base umpire during the August 12, 1984 game between the San Diego Padres and the Atlanta Braves, which featured several brawls and resulted in multiple ejections. While McSherry did not eject anyone directly (home plate umpire Steve Rippley did), he ordered the benches cleared and all reserve players back to their dressing rooms in the ninth inning. * Home plate umpire during June 23, 1986 Chicago Cubs/Philadelphia Phillies game at Veterans Stadium, where the Phillies set an NL record with 15 extra-base hits in a 19‚Äì1 rout of the Cubs. The hits were four home runs and eleven doubles. Second baseman Juan Samuel had a pair of three-run home runs. * First base umpire during a Cubs/Astros game that saw a record 53 players used in an eighteen-inning game that began on September 2, 1986 and ended the next day. * Started off behind the plate of Game 7 of the 1992 National League Championship Series but had to leave in the early innings because of dizziness. Death The headstone of McSherry in Gate of Heaven Cemetery On April 1, 1996, the Cincinnati Reds and Montreal Expos were playing an Opening Day game, and McSherry was the home plate umpire. Seven pitches into the game, McSherry called a timeout, spoke briefly to Reds catcher Eddie Taubensee, and walked slowly towards the Reds' dugout. Moments after signaling for the second base umpire to come in and replace him, McSherry stumbled and collapsed. Resuscitative efforts were begun on McSherry and he was taken to University Hospital in Cincinnati, but was pronounced dead upon arrival. He was 51 years old. Because third-base umpire Tom Hallion had followed the ambulance to the hospital, it left the remaining two umpires, Steve Rippley and Jerry Crawford, to decide whether to proceed with the game. Shaken and tearful players on both teams consoled the grieving umpires, and the umpires decided to postpone the game. Reds manager Ray Knight recalled a comment from shortstop Barry Larkin: \\"Barry told me very quietly and with very much emotion: 'Ray, I've had a lot of deaths in my family. In good conscience, out of respect for life, I can't go out there.'\\"www.baseball-almanac.com Obituary of John McSherry Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott was quoted as having said, \\"Snow this morning and now this. I don't believe it. I feel cheated. This isn't supposed to happen to us, not in Cincinnati. This is our history, our tradition, our team. Nobody feels worse than me.\\" Schott's statement was criticized as a public gaffe, though supporters contended that she was thinking of the some 50,000 fans who had expected to see a baseball game and might be unable to attend a makeup game. Schott sent flowers to the umpire's dressing room, but a story in the Dayton Daily News later said that the flowers had been given to Schott on Opening Day by Reds television affiliate WLWT in Cincinnati. According to the story, Schott hastily wrote a sympathy note and attached it to the flowers. An autopsy revealed that McSherry had suffered a massive heart attack. He went into cardiac arrest when he collapsed during the game. McSherry dealt with health issues prior to this one, including leaving a few games due to dizziness and dehydration in the early 1990s. The next day, the game went on as planned, with the Reds winning 4-1 over the Expos. Rich Rieker joined the umpiring crew as an emergency replacement at third base. McSherry's funeral was held at St. Nicholas of Tolentine Catholic Church in the Bronx, and he was interred in the Gate of Heaven Cemetery. Aftermath It was later revealed McSherry had a doctor's appointment for the day after his death; McSherry had been diagnosed with a cardiac arrhythmia. After the incident, Major League Baseball compelled its umpires to be more physically fit. NL umpire Eric Gregg, a friend of McSherry who was likely as heavy, made an effort to lose excess weight via exercise and diet, but resigned after the 1999 season in a dispute with MLB and subsequently died at age 55 due to a stroke in 2006. The New York Mets honored McSherry's memory by embroidering \\"J.M. N.L. Umpire 10\\" in a home plate crossed by two baseball bats on the right sleeves of their 1996 game jerseys. In memory of McSherry, the Reds dedicated Riverfront Stadium's umpires' dressing room to him, and the National League retired his number 10.

Although his scope covers a wide range of jazz, Wilber was a dedicated advocate of classic styles, working throughout his career to present traditional jazz pieces in a contemporary manner. He played with many distinguished jazz leaders in the 1950s and 1960s, including Bobby Hackett, Benny Goodman, Sidney Bechet, Jack Teagarden and Eddie Condon. In the late 1960s, he was an original member of the World's Greatest Jazz Band, and in the early 70s of Soprano Summit, a band which gained wide attention. In the late 1970s, he formed the Bechet Legacy Band. Wilber was active in jazz education, including working as director of the Smithsonian Jazz Repertory Ensemble. He wrote for films, including The Cotton Club. In his autobiography, Music Was Not Enough, he recounts his childhood, meeting his mentor Sidney Bechet, in 1946, and his struggles as a musician in the 1950s and 1960s. He died at the age of 91 in 2019.  Early life  Wilber, a \\"superb soprano saxophonist, a classic clarinetist, a gifted arranger and composer, and an invaluable preserver and enhancer of jazz tradition\\", was born in New York City on March 15, 1928.Balliett, Whitney. \\"Profiles: The Westchester Kids (Bob Wilber)\\", The New Yorker 53, no. 12 (1977). He became interested in jazz at the age of three when his father brought home a recording of Duke Ellington's song \\"Mood Indigo\\". In 1935, the family moved to Scarsdale, New York, and at the age of thirteen Wilber began formal clarinet study under his first teacher, Willard Briggs. He began listening to jazz from New Orleans, Kansas City, and Chicago by Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Eddie Condon, and Frank Teschemacher. He played jazz in high school and with his friends formed a \\"hot club\\", listening and jamming to records. Wilber graduated from high school in 1945. Although his parents wanted him to attend an Ivy League college, he was set on becoming a musician. He attempted to compromise with his parents by attending the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, in the fall of 1945. But after one term at Eastman, he dropped out and moved back to New York City to \\"hang out on Fifty-second Street and in the Village\\".  The Wildcats  In 1945, Wilber formed the Wildcats, which included pianist Dick Wellstood and trombonist Eddie Hubble. The Wildcats were the first jazz group in New York to \\"do what Lu Watters and Turk Murphy had been doing on the Coast ‚Äì playing the music of the Hot Five and the Red Hot Peppers and the Creole Jazz Band.\\" The group performed regularly at Jimmy Ryan's club over the next two years and was recorded in 1947 by Ramp-art Records.Johnson, Ron D. \\"Tracking the Wildcat\\", The Mississippi Rag, June 1974, 2. Wilber worked with some of the best traditional jazz musicians of the era, including Muggsy Spanier, Baby Dodds, Danny Barker, Bud Freeman, Pee Wee Russell, George Wettling, Jimmy McPartland, Wild Bill Davison, and James P. Johnson.Box 2, Folder 3. Bob Wilber Papers, 1943‚Äì2006. Milne Special Collections & Archives, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH. May 11, 2015.  Meeting Bechet  Bob Wilber and Sidney Bechet, Jimmy Ryan's (Club), New York, c. January 1947; image: William P. Gottlieb Sidney Bechet was one of the most accomplished and influential musicians of the post World War I period and was viewed by many as the best clarinetist of his time. Nevertheless, Bechet's primary instrument eventually became the soprano saxophone. In 1944, Wilber had become fascinated with Bechet's sound, and later that year, when Wilber was sixteen, he was introduced to Bechet through Mezz Mezzrow. He found out there was an opening for a pupil out at Bechet's house in Brooklyn, and so he became a Bechet pupil.Wilber, Bob. \\"Studying with Bechet\\", Jazz Music 3, no.10 (1948): 24. In the spring of 1945, he began studying both clarinet and soprano saxophone under Bechet and eventually lived with him for several months. He often sat in with Bechet at Jimmy Ryan's and they often performed duets. In 1948, Bechet sent Wilber to Nice, France, in his absence to perform at the first jazz festival. At the festival, Wilber's group shared the bill with Louis Armstrong and his Allstars. Wilber recorded for Columbia Records, Commodore, and Circle with Bechet and with his own group in the late 1940s.R.C. \\"Bob Wilber Could Take Up Where Bechet Left Off\\", The Jazz Beat, August 1959.  Boston era  In 1948, Wilber formed a trio to play at intermissions at the Savoy Caf√© in Boston. The trio featured traditional New Orleans-style jazz (dixieland). Eventually, Wilber expanded the band to a sextet and was booked as the main attraction: Bob Wilber and the Dixieland Band. This group featured Wilber on clarinet and soprano sax, Henry Goodwin on trumpet, Jimmy Archey on trombone, Dick Wellstood on piano, Johnny Fields on bass, and Tommy Benford on drums.Box 2, Folder 6. Bob Wilber Papers, 1943‚Äì2006. Milne Special Collections & Archives, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH. May 11, 2015. Wilber gained a strong following in Boston and the Savoy gig lasted through the better part of 1949. The Savoy also led to other opportunities to play in the New York City area through 1950, most notably at Jimmy Ryan's and the Stuyvesant Hotel.

Traditionally, and as recently as the APG III system it given family rank under the name Hydnoraceae. It is now submerged in the Aristolochiaceae. It contains two genera, Hydnora and Prosopanche: * Prosopanche is native to Central and South America ; * Hydnora can be found in semi-arid to desert regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and Madagascar. Members of this subfamily have been described as the strangest plants in the world. Description The most striking aspect of the Hydnoroideae is probably the complete absence of leaves (not even in modified forms such as scales). Some species are mildly thermogenic (capable of producing heat), presumably as a means to dispersing their scent. = Morphology in pictures = Image:HydnoraJohannisYoungParasiticAttachmentsWadMedaniSudanMusselman.jpgHydnora johannis, young plant in Um Barona, Wad Medani, Sudan.

In Hydnora africana there are bait bodies with a strong smell, whereas in Hydnora johannis the scent comes from a region at the tip of the perianth called a cucullus. The flowers may be above ground or underground. The fruits have edible, fragrant pulp, which attracts animals such as porcupines, monkeys, jackals, rhinoceros, and armadillos, as well as humans. The host plants, in the case of Hydnora, generally are in the family Euphorbiaceae and the genus Acacia. Hosts for Prosopanche include various species of Prosopis and other legumes.  Biochemistry  The plants contain high levels of tannins.  Genomics  The highly reduced plastid genome map of a member of Hydnoroideae, Hydnora visseri The complete plastid genome sequence of one species of Hydnoroideae, Hydnora visseri, has been determined. As compared to the chloroplast genome of its closest photosynthetic relatives, the plastome of Hydnora visseri shows extreme reduction in both size (27,233 bp) and gene content (24 genes appear to be functional). The plastome of Hydnora visseri is therefore one of the smallest among flowering plants.List of sequenced plastomes: Flowering plants.  Classification  Like many parasitic plants, the affinities with non- parasitic plants are not obvious, and 19th and 20th century botanists proposed a variety of placements for the taxon. Molecular data places them in the Piperales, and nested within the Aristolochiaceae and allied with the Piperaceae or Saururaceae.

The new venue is part of an AU$3.4b revitalisation of Darling Harbour by the NSW Government. An interim facility for large consumer and trade shows, the Sydney Exhibition Centre @ Glebe Island, opened in February 2014 and operated during the construction of the new Darling Harbour facilities. History The Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre was built by Leighton Contractors and officially opened in 1988, with a new section of the centre added for the 2000 Summer Olympics. During those games, the venue played host to the boxing, fencing, judo, weightlifting, and wrestling competitions. The building was owned by the State Government of New South Wales, with the centre administration and business run initially by a company Called Arena Meetings Conventions and Exhibitions, which at the time also operated the Sydney Entertainment centre since the date of its opening. They were awarded the contract to commission and operate the site for the first 5 years of its operations. The Accor Hotel Group subsequently gained the second 5-year term on a competitive bid basis. The Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre was used as a conference and convention venue and to hold exhibitions, as well as hosting various smaller events such as weddings and meetings. The Convention Centre had around 30 rooms, ranging from small meeting rooms to a 3,500 capacity auditorium, as well as foyer areas and other spaces which can be adapted for use as an exhibition space or pre-dinner function venue. The Exhibition Centre consisted of initially five primary halls, and was subsequently expanded to 6 and was used primarily for exhibitions, but also for gala dinners and other large-scale events. The Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre was used as the biggest venue for the Sydney Olympic Games outside of Sydney Olympic Park. The Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre was a key meeting venue of APEC Australia 2007 in September, 2007 when the political leaders of the 21 member states of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation met.

It was the 70mm version of the Technirama exhibition format. Unlike Super Panavision 70 and Ultra Panavision 70, Super Technirama 70 films were not actually photographed on 65mm film stock, but rather a specialized 35mm film process that was then blown up to 70 mm prints for use on curved Cinerama-type screens. History and Description In the late 1950s, 70mm film exhibitions were very popular, due to the large screen size and thunderous soundtrack. In 1959, Walt Disney was interested in using a prestigious 70mm release of his film Sleeping Beauty, and this was the first use of Super Technirama 70. The same year, the live action \\"Solomon and Sheba\\" was released with Super Technirama 70 prints. As the technique was still relatively new, the films only credited it as traditional Technirama, however the promotional materials heavily advertised the new technology. A big advantage to Super Technirama 70 was that the prints were fully compatible with Todd-AO and the other systems using a spherical 65mm negative. All Super Technirama 70 pictures were photographed in the 35 mm 8-perforation Technirama process and optically un-squeezed and enlarged to 70mm 5-perforation prints for theatrical presentation. A few of the Super Technirama 70 films (including Circus World and Custer of the West) were presented in 70 mm Cinerama at some venues. Special optics were used to project the 70 mm prints onto a deeply curved screen to mimic the effect of the original 3-strip Cinerama process.https://www.in70mm.com/newsletter/2000/61/technirama/index.htm Films The following films were exhibited in the Super Technirama 70 format: * Sleeping Beauty (1959) * Solomon and Sheba (1959) * Spartacus (1960) * King of Kings (1961) * El Cid (1961) * The Savage Innocents (1961) * La Fayette (1961) * Black Tights (1961) * Barabbas (1961) * Imperial Venus (1962) * 55 Days at Peking (1963) * Hercules and the Conquest of Atlantis (1963) *The Pink Panther (1963) * Circus World (1964) * The Long Ships (1964) * Zulu (1964) * The Golden Head (1965) * Le Corsaire (1965) * The Great Wall (1965) * Shellarama (1965) * Custer of the West (1967) * The Black Cauldron (1985) * Spartacus Re-release of restored print (1991) ReferencesSee also *List of Technirama films *List of 70 mm films *Cinerama *Super Panavision 70 *Technirama *Todd-AO *Ultra Panavision 70 Category:Motion picture film formats Category:70 mm film ","title":"Super Technirama 70"},{"id":"3961305","text":"The Eli Broad College of Business is the business college at Michigan State University.

Plot In 1979 in Charkhi,On location shooting actually done in Wah village, Northern Punjab. See a village in the Punjab province of Pakistan, Ayesha (a middle-aged widow) lives with her son Saleem, a teenager in love with schoolgirl Zubeida. Ayesha supports herself and Saleem with her late husband's pension and by giving lessons in the Qur'an to village girls. She refuses to go to the village well, and her neighbor's daughters draw water for her. Villagers like Amin, the postman, are troubled by the recent hanging of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto by Zia-ul- Haq, the new military ruler who has promised to enforce Islamic law and encourages Islamic missionary and political groups. Two Islamic activists come to the village and, supported by the village choudhury, spread their message of Islamic zealotry and gain recruits to fight the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The older men in the village are disdainful of their intolerance and puritanism, cynical about Zia's postponement of elections and angry when the activists accuse them of being traitors. The activists gain a following amongst the village youth, including Saleem. They cajole and intimidate Saleem into attending a political meeting in Rawalpindi, where the speakers exhort the audience to commit themselves to jihad for the creation of an Islamic Pakistani state. Attracted by their zeal and call to serve Islam and Pakistan, Saleem (who wants to be more than a village farmer) breaks up with Zubeida and becomes estranged from his mother. Ayesha unsuccessfully tries to discourage him from following the Islamists. Saleem helps build a wall around the girls' school to \\"protect\\" them and enforces the closing of village shops during namaaz in line with Zia-ul-Haq's Islamisation, and Ayesha and Zubeida are alarmed by his transformation. After an agreement between the Indian and Pakistani governments, a group of Sikh pilgrims from India, arrives in Pakistan to visit Sikh shrines. They come to Charkhi, the village they were forced to flee during the bloody partition of India in 1947. A pilgrim wants to look for his sister, who he believes survived the violence. The visitors have a mixed reception: a warm welcome from the village barber and hostility from the growing number of young Muslim zealots. Saleem is embarrassed that his mother sent food to the pilgrims and teaches the village girls that non- Muslims can go to heaven. The pilgrim asks some villagers, including Amin, if they knew if a Sikh woman survived the riots. They say they do not know, but Amin later visits the pilgrim's hut and tells him to look for the woman who never goes to the well. Following the girls who bring water to her house, the pilgrim finds Ayesha. When he asks her if she knows a Sikh woman who survived the riots, she anxiously tells him to leave. Saleem sees the pilgrim talking to his mother, and hears him call her \\"Veero\\" and tell her that her father wanted to see her before he died. Saleem is shocked to learn that Ayesha was Veero, a Sikh; in a flashback, she was amongst a group of village Sikh women lined up to jump into the village well rather than be raped by a Muslim mob in 1947. The Sikh men (including her father) want her to jump, but Veero runs away and is later caught, raped and imprisoned. Her rapist, remorseful, offers to marry her and she begins life as a Muslim. Saleem reports this to his friends, who demand that Ayesha make a public declaration of her Islamic faith; she refuses and is shunned by the villagers, including her best friends. For the first time in over thirty years, she must fetch her own water. Ayesha meets her Sikh brother at the well but refuses to accompany him, condemning her father for encouraging her to commit suicide and asking how he would feel knowing that she was living as a Muslim. Her isolation increases, with only Zubeida keeping in touch with her. Realizing that she cannot escape her past, Ayesha jumps into the well. Saleem buries her, gathers her papers and belongings and throws them into the river. In 2002 in Rawalpindi, Zubeida remembers Ayesha. In the street she sees a bearded Saleem, secretary-general of an Islamist organisation, answering questions about the compatibility of Islamic law with democracy.

It is one of many types of special use airspace designations and is depicted on aeronautical charts with the letter \\"R\\" followed by a serial number. According to the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA): \\"Restricted areas denote the existence of unusual, often invisible, hazards to aircraft such as artillery firing, aerial gunnery, or guided missiles. Penetration of restricted areas without authorization from the using or controlling agency may be extremely hazardous to the aircraft and its occupants.\\" Restricted airspace zones may not be active (\\"hot\\") at all times; in such cases there are typically schedules of local dates and times available to aviators specifying when the zone is active, and at other times, the airspace is subject to normal VFR/IFR operation for the applicable airspace class. A few zones are activated by NOTAM; an example is R-2503D over Camp Pendleton in southern California, between San Diego and Los Angeles. This particular zone, beginning at 2000ft above sea level over most of southern Camp Pendleton, can be active only for a certain number of days per year, thus allowing small planes to fly a direct route between the two metro areas instead of being diverted offshore or into mountainous terrain further inland.

As of 2015, it is the home of association football club IFK Malm√∂, presently of Division 2, and athletics club MAI. The stadium served as the home ground for Malm√∂ FF, an association football team in Sweden's top flight, Allsvenskan, from its opening in 1958 until 2009, when the club moved to the newly constructed Stadion, built beside Malm√∂ Stadion, in 2009. Malm√∂ FF still use the stadium for training purposes and youth matches. Besides being used for sports, the stadium has also hosted various concerts and other events. The ground's record attendance, 30,953, was set in the first match played at the ground, a 1958 FIFA World Cup match between Argentina and West Germany. Malm√∂ Stadion was originally built for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, during which it was the venue for four matches. It replaced Malm√∂ IP as Malm√∂'s main sports stadium, where IFK Malm√∂, MAI and Malm√∂ FF had been based since the early 20th century. It also hosted three matches during the 1992 UEFA European Football Championship. The stadium today holds 26,500 spectators when in its sporting configuration, with 14,000 fans seated and 12,500 standing. For concerts, the ground can hold up to 40,000 people depending on the location of the stage. On 2 February 2015 Malm√∂ Stad took the decision to approve the demolition of the stadium for redevelopment of the area. Malm√∂ Stad has previously decided that a new public swimming arena is to be built on the site in the near future. As of February 2015 it is still not known when the demolition process will begin. History Pel√© playing for Brazil at Malm√∂ Stadion in an exhibition match against Malm√∂ FF in 1960 Malm√∂ FF supporters in an Allsvenskan match against Hammarby IF in 2008 The exterior of the Southern Stand of Malm√∂ Stadion in 2014 The exterior of the Northern Stand of Malm√∂ Stadion in 2013 Plans to build a new stadium in Malm√∂ originated in 1943, when local officials deemed Malm√∂ IP to be too small for major events. However, the city council could not agree where to build the new stadium, and the matter was dropped for the time being. It was not until Sweden was chosen to host the 1958 FIFA World Cup that the question resurfaced. The location of the stadium was a main subject of discussion: some suggested a suburban location in J√§gersro, while others thought that the stadium should be located in central Malm√∂, near the neighbourhood of Pildammsparken. Proponents of a central location ultimately won the day; the site was confirmed in 1954. The plans were agreed upon in 1956, and building started on 5 June that year, when the chairman of the city's sports committee turned the first sod. The ground officially opened about two years later, on 28 May 1958. At the time of the stadium's inauguration, it held 31,000 spectators. It was designed by architects Sten Samuelsson and Fritz Jaenecke, who also designed another of the World Cup stadiums, Ullevi in the city of Gothenburg; as a result, the two grounds share many architectural features. During the World Cup, the stadium hosted four matches: West Germany vs Argentina in Group 1, which was the inaugural match of the stadium; West Germany vs Northern Ireland, also in Group 1; Northern Ireland vs Czechoslovakia, in the Group 1 play-off; and, finally, West Germany vs Yugoslavia in the quarter-final round. During the 1992 UEFA European Football Championship (commonly called Euro 1992), Malm√∂ Stadion hosted three matches in Group 1, which comprised the national teams of Sweden, Denmark, England and France. None of the matches played in Malm√∂ involved Sweden, however, as the host nation played all of their matches at R√•sunda, a stadium in the capital city Stockholm. Malm√∂ Allm√§nna Idrottsf√∂rening (MAI), the largest athletics club in Malm√∂, have used the stadium for training purposes and outdoor competition since the stadium's inauguration in 1958. MAI organises its own international athletic competition, the MAI Gala, which has been held since the 1930s. It was originally hosted at Malm√∂ IP, but moved to Malm√∂ Stadion after its construction. Some notable athletes who have competed in the gala are Marion Jones, Maurice Greene, Sergej Bubka and Kajsa Bergqvist. Malm√∂ Stadion served as the home ground of association football club Malm√∂ FF between 1958 and 2008. The team moved to the stadium on its opening in 1958, leaving its original home ground at Malm√∂ IP to do so. The first Malm√∂ FF match at the new ground was played on 8 August 1958; in an Allsvenskan fixture, Malm√∂ FF took on their cross-town rivals, IFK Malm√∂, who had also moved to the stadium from Malm√∂ IP. Played in front of 17,368 fans, the game ended with a 4‚Äì4 draw. IFK were relegated from Allsvenskan in 1962, and have not returned to the first tier since, but the club continues to play at Malm√∂ Stadion nonetheless. Malm√∂ FF experienced an average attendance of around 13,000 for the first ten years at the stadium; average crowds then dropped to below 10,000 by the end of the 1970s. By the 1990s, attendances were at an all-time low, with less than 5,000 people on average coming to Malm√∂ FF matches. The club therefore let Malm√∂ Stadion for the newly renovated Malm√∂ IP in 1999, IFK Malm√∂ followed in August the same year.Alsi√∂, 2011, p. 199. By this time IFK Malm√∂ were playing in Division 2, then the third tier in the Swedish league system. During their seasons in Allsvenskan, IFK Malm√∂ had attracted an average attendance of around 10,000 spectators between 1957‚Äì58 and 1962. IFK Malm√∂'s attendance at Malm√∂ Stadion reached its peak during the 1960 season when the club finished as runners-up in Allsvenskan and attracted 12,787 spectators on average to the stadium. The attendance had decreased to around 1,000 spectators per match in 1999 when the club had dropped in the league.Alsi√∂, 2011, p. 150. Malm√∂ FF's move to Malm√∂ IP occurred during the second half of the 1999 Allsvenskan. It soon became apparent to the club that Malm√∂ IP was too small, and lacked the safety facilities that Malm√∂ Stadion offered. When Malm√∂ FF were relegated to the second tier of Swedish football at the end of the 1999 season, the club board decided to move the team back to Malm√∂ Stadion before the next season started. IFK Malm√∂, however stayed at Malm√∂ IP. After Malm√∂ FF were promoted back to Allsvenskan after one season in the second division, Superettan, the average attendance began to rise. Malm√∂ FF's average crowd during the 2001 Allsvenskan season was 11,315; it was the first time since the 1970s that the club had drawn an average crowd of more than 10,000 spectators. Average attendances then increased year on year as Malm√∂ FF experienced a successful period. In the 2004 Allsvenskan season, as Malm√∂ FF won their first Swedish championship since 1988, the team also set a new club record for attendances over a season, with an average of 20,061 spectators watching Malm√∂ FF matches. Around this time, both club and fans began to feel that Malm√∂ Stadion had served it purpose, as the ageing stadium began to deteriorate. Some fans also expressed their discontent with the distance between the pitch and the stands, necessitated by the running tracks surrounding the playing area. Malm√∂ Stad, the city council, announced on 25 April 2005 its intention to either help the club renovate Malm√∂ Stadion, or build a new stadium in the same area. Four days later, five different scenarios were laid out by the municipality: the first proposed the construction of an entirely new, football-specific stadium to the south of Malm√∂ Stadion, while the second suggested the demolition of Malm√∂ Stadion, and the erection of a new ground for football and athletics on the same site. The third, fourth, and fifth ideas all proposed the building of two stadiums, one for football and one for athletics, on various local plots. The municipality chose the first option on 3 December 2005: the new football ground would be built south of Malm√∂ Stadion, with a capacity of 20,000 to 25,000, on a 399 million kronor budget. Malm√∂ Stadion, meanwhile, would be renovated into an athletics stadium for 50 million kronor. Stadion was completed in 2009. As of 2012, no renovation has been done on Malm√∂ Stadion. Malm√∂ FF left Malm√∂ Stadion at the end of the 2008 Allsvenskan season. The last Allsvenskan match played at the stadium was the team's final game of the season, against GIF Sundsvall on 9 November 2008. The match was won 6‚Äì0 by Malm√∂ FF, who wore a special kit designed to honour the legacy of the stadium. Malm√∂ FF still uses the stadium for training purposes and youth matches. IFK Malm√∂ returned to Malm√∂ Stadion for the 2009 season. The move was done in protest against Malm√∂ Stad's decision to lay out an artificial turf at Malm√∂ IP. Since returning to Malm√∂ Stadion, IFK Malm√∂'s average attendance has been around 100‚Äì200 spectators per match. The team currently plays in Division 4, the sixth tier of Swedish football. In June 2011, Malm√∂ Stad decided that a new public swimming arena is to be built in the same area as the stadium in the near future. This leaves the stadium's future clouded in uncertainty. Recent occurrences have indicated that Malm√∂ Stadion might continue to be used as an athletics arena, as MAI intends to revive the MAI Gala. In November 2012, MAI lobbied to attract 100 metres Olympic champion Usain Bolt to the stadium for the proposed MAI Gala in August 2014. MAI are also working towards hosting the European Athletics Junior Championships in 2015, and have written to the European Athletic Association to express their interest. On 31 January 2015 new reports suggested that the city council had reached an agreement that Malm√∂ Stadion is to be demolished. The decision to approve the demolition of the stadium was taken on 2 February 2015. As of February 2015 it is still unknown when the demolition process will start and what will become of the area. Structure and facilities Malm√∂ Stadion has an overall capacity of 26,500 spectators for sports, of which 14,000 are sitting spectators. When hosting concerts, the stadium can host 25,000 spectators when the stage is on either long side of the stadium, or up to 40,000 when it is placed in front of either short side. It comprises two main stands on each of the long sides of the pitch: the Southern Stand and the Northern Stand, both of which have two tiers. The lower tier of the Northern Stand is terraced, and was the only tier of the stand until the upper, seated tier was built in 1992. The short sides of the pitch feature two minor terracing sections, respectively named the Eastern Stand and the Western Stand. When Malm√∂ FF were based at the ground, the Northern Stand terracing was the section with the most season ticket holders, while the Eastern Stand was the section used to house away fans. The stadium features a association football pitch, and eight all-weather running tracks, which surround the pitch. The tracks are certified for national and international athletic competitions. Also available at the stadium are areas on each short side of the pitch for the high jump, javelin throw, pole vault and shot put events. In front of the Southern Stand there are pits for long jump and triple jump. When the stadium is used for association football, two dugouts are placed at the edge of the pitch in front of the Southern Stand. Behind the two dugouts, on the other side of the running tracks, is the entrance and exit to the players' changing rooms, which are located in the Southern Stand. There are a total of 12 changing rooms inside the stand, as well as facilities for referees and media. There are reserved seats for officials and media in the Southern Stand. In the respective corridors behind the Southern and Northern Stands, as well as in the open area between the Northern and Western Stands, there are several vendors selling snacks, light meals, and beverages. The entrances to the stadium are located along the Southern and Northern Stands. A ticket office, formerly used for selling the tickets for Malm√∂ FF home matches, is connected with the Southern Stand.

This is a list of all competitive matches played by Sweden at Malm√∂ Stadion: Other uses On 15 September 1961, the stadium was used for Motorcycle speedway when it was chosen as the host for the Speedway World Championship Final. The event, the first of its kind not to be staged at Wembley Stadium in England, was won by Swedish rider and defending champion Ove Fundin who won the third of his five Individual World Championships. It would prove to be the only World Final staged at Malm√∂ Stadion. From 1964, World Final's held in Sweden were run at the Ullevi Stadium in Gothenburg. Malm√∂ also hosted other World Championship Motorcycle speedway meetings. In 1967 it hosted the Final of the Speedway World Team Cup. The host nation Sweden won their 5th WTC title with riders G√∂te Nordin, Bengt Jansson, Torbj√∂rn Harrysson and Ove Fundin. They defeated Poland, Great Britain and the Soviet Union. In 1970 Malm√∂ hosted the Speedway World Pairs Championship which was won by New Zealand riders Ivan Mauger and Ronnie Moore. The Kiwis defeated Sweden (Ove Fundin and Bengt Jansson), and England who were represented by brothers Nigel and Eric Boocock. 1970 was the final time the stadium was used for World Championship speedway.International Speedway results Mauger would go on to break Ove Fundin's record of 5 World Championships by winning the title on 6 occasions. Sweden later regained a share of the record when Tony Rickardsson would win 6 World Championships between 1994 and 2005. The use of Malm√∂ Stadion for concerts has increased since the construction of Stadion and Malm√∂ FF's departure. Since 2007, several known artists such as Ozzy Osbourne, Elton John, Dolly Parton, The Eagles, Kiss, and Rod Stewart have performed at the stadium. Due to the climate in Sweden and the lack of a retractable roof at the ground, all of these concerts have been held during the European summer, between June‚ÄìAugust. The main stage has been placed either facing the Southern Stand, or along one of the short sides of the stadium. The pitch has been covered up with wooden floorboards during the performances to minimize the damage done to the grass. Many spectators complained about the less than impressive sound quality at both the Elton John and Dolly Parton concerts, citing the stadiums layout as unsuitable for this kind of concert. Records A graph of Malm√∂ FF's average attendances over the period from 1958 to 2008 The ground's present attendance record was set during the 1958 World Cup, when 30,953 spectators saw the first game ever played at the stadium, the Group 1 match between Argentina and West Germany. The match ended 3‚Äì1 in West Germany's favour. The record crowd for a Malm√∂ FF match played at the ground was set on 24 September 1967, when 29,328 attended the Allsvenskan match between Malm√∂ FF and Scanian rivals Helsingborgs IF. Helsingborg won the match 2‚Äì1. IFK Malm√∂'s record attendance was set on 10 September 1969 in a Division 2 Scanian derby fixture against Helsingborgs IF which attracted 25,624 spectators to the stadium, the match ended 1‚Äì0 in Helsingborg's favour. Malm√∂ FF's average attendance at Malm√∂ Stadion initially lay steady at around 15,000 per season from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, before decreasing to around 10,000 spectators per season for the remainder of that decades. During the 1980s and the 1990s, attendances decreased even further down to an average of around 5,000 fans per season; the general interest in Swedish football was also very low at the time. Attendance took a sharp turn upwards during the 2001 season, Malm√∂ FF's first season back in Allsvenskan after a season in Superettan. Average crowds then increased annually, and reached their peak during the 2004 season, when Malm√∂ FF reached an all-time record average attendance of 20,061. Attendances afterwards decreased each year, and were down to a seasonal average of 11,182 by the time of Malm√∂ FF's final season at the ground. Only 6,580 attended Malm√∂ FF's last Allsvenskan match at the stadium, on 9 November 2008. IFK Malm√∂ played five Allsvenskan seasons at Malm√∂ Stadion between 1957‚Äì58 and 1962 before being relegated to Division 2. The average attendance during these years stayed around 10,000 fans, reaching its peak at 12,787 spectators in average during the 1960 Allsvenskan season when IFK Malm√∂ finished as runners-up. Transportation Triangeln, the closest railway station to Malm√∂ Stadion Just like the neighbouring Stadion, Malm√∂ Stadion is currently served by Malm√∂ bus lines 3, 5, 6 and 34, all of which stop in the vicinity of the two stadiums. Local transit authority Sk√•netrafiken also operates dedicated match-day buses, branded as line 84, which run from different areas of Malm√∂ when Malm√∂ FF play home matches at Stadion. Due to the central location of the two stadiums within the city, parking space is limited, and spectators are advised to use public transportation, particularly for more prominent matches at Stadion. This does not apply to matchdays for IFK Malm√∂, as not so many fans are drawn for that club's games. Malm√∂ Stadion is also near the underground railway station Triangeln, which opened in December 2010 as a part of Citytunneln. The station is served by P√•gat√•g and √ñresund Trains, and is reachable non-stop from many parts of the √ñresund Region. The closest parking location to Malm√∂ Stadion is \\"P-huset Stadion\\", a parking garage with 440 parking spaces, which was purpose-built for Stadion. The garage opened in September 2009. It is located from Stadion, just beside Malm√∂ FF's training ground. There are also various other local parking spaces, and a large number of bicycle stands surrounding the western edge of Stadion.

He was the Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain under the name Carlos VII from 1868 (his father's Spanish abdication), and the Legitimist claimant to the throne of France under the name Charles XI after the death of his father in 1887. Life coin of Carlos VII Carlos was born in Ljubljana, the capital of Carniola in what is now Slovenia, the elder son of Juan, Count of Montiz√≥n and of his wife Archduchess Maria Beatrix of Austria-Este. His name in full was Carlos Mar√≠a de los Dolores Juan Isidro Jos√© Francisco, Quirico Antonio Miguel Gabriel Rafael. As an infant he lived with his family briefly in London where his younger brother Alfonso was born. After their father, considered too liberal for Carlist tastes, left their mother, the boys lived with her in Modena. Her brother Duke Francis V of Modena was largely responsible for the education of the boys and was the chief influence in their early lives. Carlos was known for his traditionalist views, much different from those of his father. Family On 4 February 1867, at Frohsdorf in Austria, Carlos married Princess Margherita of Bourbon-Parma, daughter of Duke Charles III of Parma and of his wife, Louise Marie Th√©r√®se of France.

It is currently the home venue of Villarreal CF of La Liga, the highest football league in Spain. The stadium has 23,500 seats, a figure which is half the population of the city of Villarreal, making it the 25th- largest stadium in Spain and the 5th-largest in the Valencian Community. There is a statue of a yellow submarine outside the stadium to represent the club's nickname. History Plaque at the stadium's exterior The stadium was inaugurated on 17 June 1923 with a match between Castell√≥n and Cervantes under the name Campo del Villarreal (Villarreal Field), becoming renamed two years later in honour to the rural lands on which it was erected. Nicknamed the Feudo Amarillo (\\"Yellow Fief\\"), it is located at Plaza Labrador, five kilometres away from the Mediterranean Sea, and at an altitude of 50 metres. The first remodeling works took place on the stadium in the close season before the 1952‚Äì53 season. The size of the pitch was taken from 95 x 65 m to 105 x 65 m, matching that of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium of the 1952 Summer Olympics, a reference to copy during those years. During the 1960s the club erected a small covered stand, and during the 1971‚Äì72 season the southern stands were finished. In 1988 it was demolished to make room for a new stand which opened on 8 March 1989 with a friendly match against Atl√©tico Madrid. For the club's 75th anniversary new renovation works were started. The south stand was again demolished to erect a new one with a roof, an amphitheatre, the VIP sector, and the northern stand were built, finishing the works at the 1999‚Äì2000 season. The stadium was first floodlit for night matches on 16 September 1973 for the third division match between Villarreal and Ibiza. The city hall provided help for the construction of the floodlight towers located at each of the four corners of the field, with nine halogen lamps on top of each one. The changing rooms were moved several times. Until the 1935‚Äì36 season they were at the south eastern corner of the stadium, then at the north east until 1989, when they were moved to the south western part. After the last modifications to the stadium, they are now under the main stand. On 8 January 2017, just before a La Liga match against Barcelona, Villarreal changed the name of its stadium from El Madrigal to Estadio de la Cer√°mica () recognising the local industry. The \\"Casals Grocs\\" There are 30 Casals Grocs VIP boxes with air conditioning, TV with live transmission of the matches, catering service, individual seats and independent access from the southern stand with three elevators. Of the 30 boxes, five accommodate 20 people, 23 accommodate 16, and the last two 12 fans. Champions League To be approved for the UEFA Champions League, stadiums have to fulfil a series of requisites, for which the Stadium had to be quickly renovated in 2005 to meet those regulations. The facade was covered with yellow tiles, both to improve aesthetics, and to benefit the local industry of tiles. The dressing rooms were also renovated, creating an office for the coach, physiotherapy room, and a bath and showers area. There was also an office created for the UEFA delegates, an anti-doping hall, and the room for press conferences was expanded. The separation of the pitch from the public has been expanded by one metre, and the entrance to the dressing rooms had to be revised. Two restaurants have been created inside the facilities, and the advertising system was computerised.

In other words, the movement postulates that Galician and Portuguese languages did not only share a common origin and literary tradition, but that they are in fact variants of the same language even today. According to this, Galicia should re-integrate into the Community of Portuguese Language Countries. The opposite view holds that Portuguese and Galician should be viewed as distinct languages, which is called Isolationism. Controversy There are two main views in Galicia about the Galician language: * The isolationist considers Galician and Portuguese to be two distinct languages, although they are closely related. Isolationists favour differentiated rules of writing and spelling between Galician and Portuguese. In this fashion, Galician spelling follows the model of Spanish orthography and its own traditional conventions, which converge with it in some aspects. This view is held by the majority of public and Government organizations. Its standard norm, the \\"NOMIGa\\", is elaborated by the Real Academia Galega (Royal Galician Academy) and the Instituto da L√≠ngua Galega (Institute for Galician Language). : Among other criteria, isolationism argues that since the majority of the Galician population was educated in Spanish only (as official use of Galician was forbidden for centuries, especially in Francoist Spain), it is easier to create a Galician written norm which is closer to Spanish, therefore more \\"familiar\\", regardless of other considerations. It is also alleged that since the Spanish language had such a vast influence in modern Galician its contribution should not be simply disregarded. This influence is noticeable in some aspects of Galician phonetics and colloquial speech. * The reintegrationist view considers Galician to be a variant of a shared Galician- Portuguese linguistic diasystem, as evidenced by the common origin, grammar, syntax, vocabulary, morphology and overall high level of mutual intelligibility. Therefore, reintegrationists support the use of spelling rules similar to the ones used in Portuguese-speaking countries. This is supported by the AGAL (Galician Association of the Language), Galician Academy of the Portuguese Language, Brazilian Academy of Letters, Lisbon Academy of Sciences, and a number of civic and cultural associations both in Galicia and Portuguese-speaking countries. : In this fashion, it is argued that Galician would be faithful to its history and etymology and subsequently its written norm would be more scientific and precise. Thus, it would allow Galician speakers to have direct access to a world culture and it would also clarify some spelling problems of the isolationist norm (for example in terms of accentuation).Accentuation section on the 'Critical Study' to the ILG-RAG norm, by AGAL . Access date 1 September 2011Article about the 'Continuum' of the norms in Galicia. Access date 1 September 2011 : Reintegrationism is a cultural stand as much as a linguistic position. Its supporters believe that Galicia rightfully belongs to Lusophony since, in fact, modern Portuguese originated in what is today Galicia (see History of Portuguese, Galician- Portuguese period). They aim for stronger cultural and economic ties with the Portuguese-speaking countries using the common language as a tool for direct communication. : From the Portuguese side, a number of relevant linguists and authors such as Lu√≠s Lindley Cintra, Manuel Rodrigues Lapa, Fernando Ven√¢ncio, Carlos Reis or Malaca Casteleiro have expressed their agreement with the reintegrationist views.On the opening of the Galician Academy for Portuguese Language. Access date 8 October 2008 =Genesis of the debate= The divergences between isolationism and reintegrationism can be traced back to the time of the Galician Rexurdimento (Revival), in the nineteenth century, when Galician began to be systematically written again in Galicia for the first time since the Middle Ages. Up to that time, written Galician was either forbidden or simply dismissed by the Spanish authorities, and certainly not used officially. Hence, Rexurdimento Galician writers realized they did not \\"know\\" how Galician should be spelled properly. There were three possible options: to infer it from the Medieval forms; to use a Spanish-based spelling, which was already known to all; or to use the Portuguese spelling, feeling that written Portuguese was \\"what Galician would have been if it had not been forbidden\\". Authors such as Castelao, among others, stated that Galician should gradually merge with Portuguese, namely in its written form.Selected quotes of Castelao and other Galician classics , commenting on Galician language and politicsSelected quotes Galician classics on Reintegrationism and the Galician-Portuguese issue, commenting on Galician language and politics The reality was that until the 1980s Galician was often written using a mix of the three options. Yet, with the end of Francoist Spain in 1975, and with the Spanish transition to democracy shortly afterwards, Galicia became an autonomous community with the Statute of Autonomy of 1981, with Galician as its official language (alongside Spanish). Establishing a fixed standard form then became urgent. Claims for Galician-Portuguese linguistic unity had already been produced, as evidenced with the Manifesto para a superviv√™ncia da cultura galega (Manifesto for the Survival of Galician Culture), first published in 1974.Manifesto para a superviv√™ncia da cultura galega, published in 1974, probably written originally circa 1971‚Äì72 Still, the first draft of the language norms was produced in 1979 under the guidance of linguist Professor Ricardo Carballo Calero. These norms recommended a gradual approach to Portuguese, often allowing for a number of different solutions in the case of uncertainty. However, political issues forced the resignation of Carvalho Calero and, consequently, the 1979 pro-reintegrationist norms were revoked. The new official norms and reforms passed from 1982 onwards would be strongly pro-isolationist.Biography of Carvalho Calero , explaining the development of the language norm and his implication in itAo Lonxe: Ou o comezo da guerra normativa, blog entry explaining the \\"story\\" behind the \\"standards war\\"  Practicalities  Reintegrationism accepts two possibilities for writing Galician: either adopting the standard Portuguese written norm or using a slightly modified norm following the recommendations of AGAL. In any case, reintegrationism considers that spoken Galician and all of its characteristic words, expressions, and pronunciation should not be radically substituted by standard Portuguese. The main recommendations of reintegrationism when referring to spoken Galician revolve around the avoidance of unnecessary Spanish loanwords, namely colloquialisms. In writing, the most obvious differences from the official norm (NOMIGa) are (according to AGAL):http://www.agal- gz.org/corporativo/reintegracionismo/5-reintegracionimo/113-guia-de-leitura- dos-grafemas-e-digrafos-da-escrita-do-galego * Use of nh instead of the letter √± to represent the palatal nasal sound. For example: caminho instead of cami√±o (way). * Use of mh instead of nh to represent the velar nasal sound. For example: algumha instead of algunha. * Use of the digraph lh instead of ll to represent the palatal lateral sound. For example: coelho instead of coello (rabbit) * Use of -√ßom/-√ß√£o and -√ß√µes instead of the suffix -ci√≥n and -ci√≥ns. For example: associa√ßom/associa√ß√£o instead of asociaci√≥n and associa√ß√µes instead of asociaci√≥ns (association, associations) * Preference for the use of suffixes -aria and -vel over -er√≠a and -ble or even -bel. For example: livraria instead of librer√≠a (bookshop); incr√≠vel instead of incrible or incr√≠bel (incredible) * Use of ss between vowels, when appropriate, instead of the simplified s for all cases. For example: associa√ß√£o instead of asociaci√≥n * Use of either x, j or g preceding e or i, according to the etymology of the word, instead of x for all cases. For example: hoje instead of hoxe (today), geral instead of xeral (general), but ex√©rcito as in ex√©rcito (army) * Use of m instead of n at the end of a word. For example: som instead of son (sound) * Use of a wider range of accentuation signs instead of the simplified single stroke. For example: portugu√™s instead of portugu√©s (Portuguese), coment√°rio instead of comentario (commentary). Note that the official orthography, being a calque of the Spanish one in that respect, does not cater for any difference between open and closed vowels, since Spanish does not have them. * Avoidance of specific lexical choices introduced by Spanish Even though the reintegrationist norm does not have official status, it has been recognized in courts of law. Furthermore, Galician members of the European Parliament (such as Jos√© Posada, Camilo Nogueira and Xos√© Manuel Beiras) have used spoken Galician when addressing the chamber and have used standard Portuguese orthography to encode their Galician speech. In all cases, these interventions and encodings have been accepted by the Parliament as a valid form of Portuguese, that is, an official language of the European Union.O galego j√° √© oficial na Uniom Europeia, by Jos√© Manuel Barbosa, 2004O galego na Uni√£o Europea, sound file, by Camilo Nogueira, Celso √Ålvarez C√°ccamo et al., 2004Interview to Manuel Garcia: \\"I spoke Galician in the European Parliament\\" , 2005 Furthermore, members of Galician reintegrationist associations have been regularly present at meetings of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries. In 2008, Galician delegates were invited as speakers to the Portuguese Parliament when discussing the new spelling norms for Portuguese language.Presen√ßa galega no parlamento portugu√™s na comunica√ßom social , 2008  Common positions  Theoretically, the positions of the standards of NOMIGa (official norm) and AGAL are not so different. Although usually accused of having pro-Spanish tendencies, it is stated at the introduction of the NOMIGa that \\"standard choices must be in harmony with those of other languages, especially to those of Romance languages and especially to those of Portuguese\\". Furthermore, they value \\"the contribution of Peninsular and Brazilian Portuguese\\" in the creation of the Galician norm. This being the philosophy behind the \\"official standard\\", NOMIGa and AGAL share an initial starting point, but it is often argued that the NOMIGa are far removed from the usual speech of day-to-day and older Galician speakers, in addition to \\"isolating\\" Galician (hence the term isolationist) from the rest of Portuguese-speaking areas by using a different writing system. In any case, European and Brazilian Portuguese are usually analyzed by both isolationists and reintegrationists as a primary source from which to extract scientific and technical terminology and neologisms.  Political implications As with many other aspects of Galician society and culture, language is deeply politicized in Galicia. Traditionally, the defence and promotion of Galician language has been linked to Galician nationalism, yet this is often considered a simplification. Likewise, different political groups and parties have adopted different approaches to the \\"isolationism vs reintegrationism\\" polemic.Reintegracioniso e nacionalismo hoje , by Jos√© Manuel Outeiro Broadly speaking, pro-independence groups have traditionally expressed a greater support for the reintegrationist norm, while others have adopted the isolationist. In any case, all the linguistic organizations behind both reintegrationism and isolationism have attempted to dissociate themselves from the political debate. For example, AGAL members have often expressed that this is merely a linguistic, hence scientific, discussion, and that it should not become the arena for political fights among the community of Galician speakers.O reintegracionismo deve rachar com a imagem de marginalidade e seitarismo , Forum da L√≠ngua, 2004Interview to Maur√≠cio Castro: O conhecimento e interesse polo reintegracionismo est√° hoje mais estendido socialmente , 2006Outeiro , op. cit.

It was launched in April 1987. Publication ceased seven months later, in November 1987. Origins The founders of the paper were former members of the left-wing group Big Flame. They decided that a left-wing mass-circulation tabloid Sunday newspaper was possible and endeavoured to start one. The idea of the paper was originally thought up by Benjamin Lowe. The leaders were John Pilger as editor-in-chief and Alan Hayling, but Pilger left before the newspaper was launched. The decision to base its headquarters in Manchester was criticised as it was away from the centre of national political activity. The paper gave a controlling interest to a collective of workers and its share issue raised ¬£6.5 million from trade unions and Labour local authority pension funds. Keith Sutton was appointed editor. Launch and bankruptcy The advertisement campaign for the paper was carried out by BBH (Bartle, Bogle & Hegarty), who came up with the slogan \\"No tits but a lot of balls\\", in an attempt to distance the paper from those with images of topless women, and emphasise an overt political agenda not usually associated with tabloids. The slogan offended the feminists working on the paper and was subsequently dropped, though an element of the idea survived for the TV advert. The slogan used was \\"The paper that bites back\\".Socialist Standard, Volumes 82-83, 1986 The newspaper's attitude to news values, and the inexperience of its staff, was illustrated on the front page of its first edition on 26 April. The lead story was about a boy in Brazil who had to sell one of his kidneys to pay for medical care. Although most agreed that this was a worthwhile issue, the story was considered inappropriate as the lead story for a British Sunday paper. The paper was not as successful as had been hoped. In order to break even, the paper had to sell 800,000 copies. BBC Two documentary summary The first issue sold 500,000 and by its eighth issue circulation had gone down to 200,000. The failure of the paper is attributed to inexperienced staff, \\"bad management, poor marketing, a commitment to political correctness and ideological purity at the expense of news values\\". However the paper was kept afloat during the general election campaign thanks to the extension of an additional subordinated loan from the TGWU, so that its folding would not embarrass the Labour Party. It went bankrupt immediately after the election had been held and was purchased by convicted rapist Owen Oyston but finally closed down five months later, in November 1987.Concise History of the British Newspaper in the 20th Century: The British Library Newspaper Library Two ex-employees, Peter Chippindale and Chris Horrie, wrote a \\"withering\\" account of its demise called Disaster!. Editorial line The newspaper was socialist in tone and internationalist in outlook. It supported the principle of self determination for all nations and regarded British society as 'based on the unequal ownership of wealth, prosperity and power'. It also believed that the root cause of the Troubles in Northern Ireland was the 'British presence in that country'. It supported trade unions when they went on strike and was against the 'imposition of suffering on animals'.

It is the largest stadium in the Balearic Islands and the 26th largest in Spain. The stadium was renamed during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in a conjoined effort with Consell de Mallorca, and other public entities to reactivate tourist activities on the island, its main resource. The stadium is located in the Can Valero industrial zone in north-west Palma, 3 km from the city center and 13 km from the airport. It can be seen from the V√≠a de Cintura, Palma's urban motorway. Previously known as the Son Moix Stadium (, ), the Iberostar Stadium () and the Ono Estadi, the stadium was built for the 1999 Summer Universiade. In 1999, RCD Mallorca obtained an agreement with the city council to use it for the next 50 years, replacing their previous stadium, Estadio Llu√≠s Sitjar. The stadium can hold 23,142 spectators, making it the biggest stadium in the Balearic Islands. It has a bowl shape design with two of the stands having two tiers. The stadium was designed to allow for further development of both ends, eventually creating a fully two-tiered stadium with a capacity of over 40,000. These plans now look unlikely as further detailed below. A small temporary stand is sometimes erected on the athletics track; this can be removed for athletics events. International games The Spain national football team has played three international matches at the stadium, the most recent was on October 11, 2013 against Belarus in a 2014 World Cup qualifying match. Spain won this fixture 21. Future Any future improvement plans seem to be on hold, with RCD Mallorca preferring to explore the construction of a new stadium. This is in part to the club and their landlords being in disagreement over improvements to the existing stadium..

The program premiered in syndication on January 23, 1989. It aired in first-run until June 9, 1989, for a total of one hundred episodes, and reruns aired after that until September 8, 1989. Couch Potatoes was hosted by Marc Summers, who at the time was also hosting the children's game show Double Dare on both Nickelodeon and local stations. Comedian and voice actor Joe Alaskey was also featured on the show, serving as its announcer and also playing an on-camera role as Summers' next door neighbor. After Alaskey left the series toward the end of its run, his character was retired and Jim McKrell took over his announcer role (albeit off camera). Couch Potatoes was taped at Hollywood Center Studios and was a production of Saban Entertainment with Westinghouse Broadcasting's Group W Productions as distributor. The series was created by Ellen Levy and the show's producer-writer David M. Greenfield. Gameplay Couch Potatoes featured two teams of three players each, with one of the teams usually a returning champion. To tie in with the overall theme of the show, both teams were given some sort of TV-centric name. The game started with a toss-up question, referred to as the \\"Tune-In\\" question, a multiple choice question worth 25 points and control. All six players had the ability to ring in and answer, but answering incorrectly forfeited control to the other team. The team in control was then asked three questions referred to as \\"Spin-Offs\\". Each question was worth 25 points (referred to as \\"ratings points\\") and each member of the team could only attempt one question. If at any time the team answered incorrectly, the other team was given a chance to steal control. Four rounds were played in this manner, and for the third and fourth the point values doubled to 50 for each correct answer. Late in the run, two additional rounds of questioning were added; the first three rounds were worth 25 points and the last three 50. =Couch Up Round= The Couch Up Round was the last round and was played face-off style. Each question was a toss up, and the value for each question was determined by a randomizer. After the question was asked, whichever team member that buzzed in first was told the value of the question and prompted for an answer. Answering correctly awarded the points, but answering incorrectly gave the opponent a chance to steal. The question values ranged from 50 to 200 points in increments of 50. The randomizer could also display \\"Couch Up\\", which meant that if the trailing team answered the question correctly they would immediately tie the score. If the leaders answered correctly the team did not gain or lose anything. Six questions were asked, and play moved in order from one end of the couch to the other. At the end of the six questions, the team in the lead won the game, $1,000, and a chance for $5,000 more in the Channel Roulette bonus round. The opponents, by virtue of not having enough ratings points, they would \\"cancelled\\" and left with Some Cancellation gifts and if it there was returning's Champions they keep the money they won. The most Rating points a team could score was 1,800 Rating points (2,100 points when the six-round format was introduced). If there was a tie at the end of the Couch Up Round, one final question was played and whoever answered it correctly won the game for his/her team. =Bonus Round: Channel Roulette= In Channel Roulette, the objective for the team was to identify TV shows using pictures of their casts. There were twelve \\"channels\\", laid out in a 4-by-3 grid and numbered 2-13 as on a standard VHF setup, and eleven of them featured pictures. Each of those pictures had a value attached, with amounts ranging from 100 to 1,000 points; the higher the value, the more obscure the picture. One at a time, moving end to end as before, each team member would choose a channel. If a picture was hidden behind the channel Summers would inform the team of its value before the player guessed. One of the channels hid a screen called \\"Pay TV\\". If this came up at any time the team's score reset to zero, but play would continue as long as there was time left. The team had thirty seconds to accumulate at least 1,000 points; doing so won $5,000. If they did not do so, they kept whatever money earned in the round. Teams stayed on the show until they won five games or were defeated, therefore making it theoretically possible to win up to $30,000. Episode status All episodes of Couch Potatoes exist. Reruns began airing on USA Network on September 11, 1989, three days after the show aired for the final time in syndication, and continued to air until March 23, 1990. Guests During its eight-month run, Couch Potatoes had numerous celebrity guests on the show; they usually appeared in Round Four asking questions about their career or show. One show featured Jack Larson and Noel Neill, better known as Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane from the 1950s series The Adventures of Superman, asking questions about the series. Another notable guest was Gary Coleman, who asked questions about Diff'rent Strokes and mentioned to host Summers he was asked to be the youth chairman for the Just Say No Foundation. During one week, game show celebrities Bob Eubanks, Jim Lange, Janice Pennington, Wink Martindale, Peter Marshall, Johnny Gilbert, and Gary Owens appeared. Other celebs included Cubby O'Brien from The Mickey Mouse Club, Jay North from Dennis the Menace, Larry Mathews from The Dick Van Dyke Show, Isabel Sanford from The Jeffersons, Dick Sargent from Bewitched, Alaina Reed Hall from 227, Dorothy Lyman from Mama's Family, Steve Allen, and Rebeca Arthur from Perfect Strangers. The premiere episode had Dennis Franz as a guest asking questions about Hill Street Blues.

It was released as Distant in North America, a literal translation of its title (). The movie is the winner of 31 awards including Best Actor at Cannes, Special Jury Prize at Chicago, and Best Balkan Movie at Sofia International Film Festival. Plot Uzak tells the story of Yusuf (Mehmet Emin Toprak), a young factory worker who loses his job and travels to Istanbul to stay with his relative Mahmut (Muzaffer √ñzdemir) while looking for a job. Mahmut is a relatively wealthy and intellectual photographer, whereas Yusuf is almost illiterate, uneducated, and unsophisticated. The two do not get along well. Yusuf assumes that he will easily find work as a sailor, but there are no jobs, and he has no sense of direction or energy. Meanwhile, Mahmut, despite his wealth, is aimless too: his job, which consists of photographing tiles, is dull and inartistic, he can barely express emotions towards his ex-wife or his lover, and while he pretends to enjoy intellectual filmmakers like Andrei Tarkovsky, he switches channels to watch porn as soon as Yusuf leaves the room. Mahmut attempts to bond with Yusuf and recapture his love of art by taking him on a drive to photograph the beautiful Turkish countryside, but the attempt is a failure on both counts. At the end of the film, Yusuf leaves without telling Mahmut, who is left to sit by the docks, watching the ships on his own.

Depending on its location, the abdominal mass may be caused by an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), protruding kidney, a pancreatic mass, a retroperitoneal mass (a mass in the posterior of the peritoneum), an abdominal aortic aneurysm, or various tumours, such as those caused by abdominal carcinomatosis and omental metastasis. The treatments depend on the cause, and may range from watchful waiting to radical surgery. Presentation Many abdominal masses are discovered incidentally during routine physical examination. When they are present symptomatically, abdominal masses are most frequently associated with pain or digestive problems. However, depending on the cause, masses may be associated with other signs and symptoms, such as jaundice or bowel obstruction. Causes * Abdominal aortic aneurysm * Bladder distention * Cholecystitis (an inflammation of the gallbladder) * Colon cancer * Crohn's disease * Bowel obstruction * Diverticulitis * Gallbladder tumor * Hydronephrosis (fluid- filled kidney) * Kidney cancer (including renal cell carcinoma) * Liver cancer * Hepatomegaly (Liver enlargement) * Neuroblastoma * Ovarian cyst * Pancreatic abscess * Pancreatic pseudocyst * Splenomegaly (Spleen enlargement) * Stomach cancer * Uterine leiomyoma (fibroids) * Volvulus (twisted piece of the gastrointestinal tract) * Uretero-pelvic junction obstruction Diagnosis The first steps in diagnosis are a medical history and physical examination. Important clues during history include weight loss, diarrhea and abdominal pain. During physical examination, the clinician must identify the location of the mass, as well as characterize its location (usually specified in terms of quadrants). The mass should be assessed for whether it is rigid or mobile. It should also be characterized for pulse or peristalsis, as these would help in further identifying the mass. Routine blood tests are usually the next step in diagnosis after a thorough medical history and physical examination. They should include a full blood count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and liver function tests such as albumin, international normalized ratio (INR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), serum amylase and total bilirubin (TBIL). If late-stage liver disease is suspected, then a serum glucose may be appropriate.

Their home ground is Lorimer Park and they currently play in the South of Scotland Football League. It was also the name of a previous club from the town, who were in membership of the Scottish Football League from 1923 to 1927. History=Original club= Nithsdale Wanderers originally formed in 1897 and enjoyed a measure of local success in their early years. The 1920s would see them achieve their highest level of national prominence. The decade began with them moving to a new ground at Crawick Holm. In the 1923‚Äì24 season, they were one of the clubs invited to join the Scottish League's new Third Division. Although this competition would exist only for three seasons and would have terrible economic consequences for many of its clubs, Nithsdale Wanderers were to thrive, albeit briefly, on their new found status. In 1924‚Äì25, Wanderers won the Third Division championship, clinching the title with an 8‚Äì0 victory over Montrose in the final match of the season. Although they finished comfortably mid-table in their d√©but season in the Second Division, the 1926‚Äì27 season saw them finish bottom and they had to seek re-election to the league (by this time Division Three was no more). They were unsuccessful and the brief league career of Nithsdale Wanderers was at an end. They continued to compete in local senior competitions, including the Southern Counties League and the South of Scotland League, and occasionally qualified for the Scottish Cup (suffering a 14‚Äì0 defeat against Dundee United in the 1930‚Äì31 competition). In 1951, the club dropped down to the junior grades, but continued to struggle, finally going out of existence in 1964. =Modern club= After a gap of 37 years, the name of Nithsdale Wanderers was revived when the new club successfully applied for membership of the South of Scotland Football League in 2001. Their biggest impact on the competition to date was finishing in second place in the 2006‚Äì07 season. As they are only associate members of the SFA, they are only eligible to compete in the Scottish Cup in the event of them winning the league. The team's home colours are blue and white.

Typically, adherents of such religions believe the ETs to be interested in the welfare of humanity which either already is, or eventually will become, part of a pre-existing ET civilization. Others may incorporate ETs into a more supernatural worldview in which the UFO occupants are more akin to angels than physical aliens; this distinction may be blurred within the overall subculture. These religions have their roots in the tropes of early science fiction (especially space opera) and weird fiction writings, in ufology, and in the subculture of UFO sightings and alien abduction stories.  Summary  Some adherents believe that the arrival or rediscovery of alien civilizations, technologies and spirituality will enable humans to overcome current ecological, spiritual and social problems. Issues such as hatred, war, bigotry, poverty and so on are said to be resolvable through the use of superior alien technology and spiritual abilities. Such belief systems are also described as millenarian in their outlook.When We Enter Into My Father's Spacecraft. Andreas Gr√ºnschlo√ü. Marburg Journal of Religion, Vol. 3, No. 2 (December 1998),pp. 1‚Äì24 UFO religions developed first in such countries as the United States, Canada, France, the United Kingdom and Japan as the concept presumes the cultural context of a society technologically advanced enough to conceive of ET as such and one in which religion of any kind is not discouraged or suppressed. The term \\"flying saucers\\" and the popular notion of the UFO originated in 1947. The 1950s saw the creation of UFO religions, with the advent of the purported contactees.  Notable UFO religions = Aetherius Society = The Aetherius Society was founded in the United Kingdom in 1955. Its founder, George King, claimed to have been contacted telepathically by an alien intelligence called Aetherius, who represented an \\"Interplanetary Parliament.\\" According to Aetherians, their society acts as a vehicle through which \\"Cosmic Transmissions of advanced metaphysical significance\\" can be disseminated to humanity. These \\"transmissions\\" were recorded on magnetic reel-to-reel tape by persons present during each \\"telepathic transmission\\" as George King sat in a state of \\"Samadhi\\" and the \\"transmission\\" was \\"delivered\\" via his own voicebox. In 1956 and 1957, and on occasion before a public audience, several of these \\"transmissions\\" forecast flying saucer activity in specific parts of the world on certain dates (You Are Responsible! Aetherius Society 1961). Shortly after these dates, newspapers, such as the Sunday Times and The Daily Telegraph, reported sightings which coincided with the dates and locations forecast in these \\"transmissions\\". As a spiritual teacher, George King taught certain yoga practices, spiritual healing, Eastern mantra and \\"dynamic prayer\\"‚Äîtools for spiritual self-advancement and service to the world‚Äîwhich the Aetherius Society is principally based upon. = Church of the SubGenius = Founded in 1979 with the publication of SubGenius Pamphlet #1 by Ivan Stang and Philo Drummond, the Church of the SubGenius has been known as a \\"parody religion\\" due to its extensive use of comedy and parody. In spite of this, the organization claims over 10,000 followers worldwide who have paid $30 to become \\"ordained SubGenius ministers\\", and it has been embraced by many skeptic and atheist groups. With the publication of The Book of the SubGenius in 1983, the Church of the SubGenius prophesied that its founder, J.R. \\"Bob\\" Dobbs, was in contact with an exterrestrial race called the Xists (\\"X-ists\\"), and these Xists were scheduled to launch a worldwide invasion of Earth on July 5, 1998. (See also: X-Day (Church of the SubGenius)) The day of the scheduled invasion came and went without an appearance by the Xists, but church members remain unconvinced. The church now holds annual \\"X-Day\\" celebrations on July 5 of every year. The church also claims that its members are not entirely human, having descended from the Yeti. = Heaven's Gate = The Heaven's Gate group achieved notoriety in 1997 when founder Marshall Applewhite convinced 38 followers to commit mass suicide. Members reportedly believed themselves to be aliens, awaiting a spaceship that would arrive with Comet Hale-Bopp. The suicide was undertaken in the apparent belief that their souls would be transported onto the spaceship, which they thought was hiding behind the comet. They underwent elaborate preparations for their trip, including purchasing and wearing matching shoes and living in a darkened house to simulate the long journey they expected to have in outer space. = Nation of Islam = The Nation of Islam subscribes to the belief that UFOs are man-made machines that are piloted not by extraterrestrial beings, but by humans. It is believed that these machines will have a hand in the Day of Judgment. Its late leader Elijah Muhammed claimed that the biblical Book of Ezekiel describes a \\"Mother Plane\\" or great \\"Wheel\\". Elijah reported in his books that his mentor, Wallace Fard Muhammad, claimed that there was hidden technology on the Earth which selected scientists all around the world are secretly aware of. Fard explained that he had had a huge \\"Mother Plane\\" or \\"Wheel\\" constructed on the island of Nippon (Japan) in 1929. The movement's current leader, Louis Farrakhan, describes the \\"Mother Plane\\" thus: > The Honorable Elijah Muhammad told us of a giant Motherplane that is made > like the universe, spheres within spheres. White people call them > unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Ezekiel, in the Old Testament, saw a > wheel that looked like a cloud by day but a pillar of fire by night. The > Hon. Elijah Muhammad said that that wheel was built on the island of Nippon, > which is now called Japan, by some of the original scientists. It took 15 > billion dollars in gold at that time to build it. It is made of the toughest > steel. America does not yet know the composition of the steel used to make > an instrument like it. It is a circular plane, and the Bible says that it > never makes turns. Because of its circular nature it can stop and travel in > all directions at speeds of thousands of miles per hour. He said there are > 1,500 small wheels in this mother wheel which is a half mile by a half mile > (800 by 800 m). This Mother Wheel is like a small human built planet. Each > one of these small planes carry three bombs.\\"The divine destruction of > America: Can she avert it?\\". finalcall.com = Ra√´lism = The International Ra√´lian Movement has been described as \\"the largest UFO religion in the world.\\"Susan J. Palmer, \\"Women in Controversial New Religions\\", in New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America, ed. Derek H. Davis & Barry Hankins, p. 66. Baylor University Press, 2004. Ra√´lians believe that scientifically advanced extraterrestrials, known as the Elohim, created life on Earth through genetic engineering, and that a combination of human cloning and \\"mind transfer\\" can ultimately provide eternal life. Past religious teachers, like Jesus, Buddha and Muhammad, are said to have been sent by these scientifically advanced extraterrestrials to teach humanity. The Elohim are said to be planning a future visit to complete their revelation and education of humanity. Ra√´lian Priest Thomas said on this topic, \\"The difference between Ra√´lians and Heaven's Gate and Jim Jones etc., is that the others destructively believed in a God who would give them a better life after death, just like most believers in a monotheistic religion do today, and hence the risk for suicide chasing afterlife rewards ‚Ä¶ as Ra√´lians we want the best right now in our life, who would want to die now in that scenario with all those pleasures to enjoy? Ra√´lians believe in enjoying life now, with happiness and laughter.\\" = Scientology = Scientology has been discussed in the context of UFO religions in UFO Religions by Christopher Partridge, The Encyclopedic Sourcebook of UFO Religions by James R. Lewis, and UFO Religion: Inside Flying Saucer Cults and Culture by Gregory Reece. Stories of extraterrestrial civilizations and interventions in past lives form a part of the belief system of Scientology. The most well-known story publicized and held up to ridicule by critics is that of Xenu, the ruler of the Galactic Confederacy who is said to have brought billions of frozen people to Earth 75 million years ago and placed them near a number of volcanoes, and dropped hydrogen bombs into them, thus killing the entire population in an effort to solve overpopulation. The spirits of these people were then captured by Xenu and mass implanted with numerous suggestions and then \\"packaged\\" into clusters of spirits.OT III Scholarship Page From the early 1950s onwards, Scientology's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, published a number of books, lectures, and other works describing what he termed \\"space opera\\". Scientology teaches that all humans have experienced innumerable past lives, including lives in ancient advanced extraterrestrial societies, such as Helatrobus and the Marcabians. Traumatic memories from these past lives are said to be the cause of many present-day physical and mental ailments. Scientologists also believe that human beings possess superhuman powers which cannot be restored until they have been fully rehabilitated as spiritual beings through the practice of \\"auditing\\", using methods set out by Hubbard in his various works. According to Hubbard, a thetan (the Scientology term for a soul) has a body. When that body dies the thetan goes to a \\"landing station\\" on the planet Venus, where they are re-implanted and are programmed to forget their previous lifetimes. The Venusians then \\"capsule\\" each thetan and send them back to Earth to be dumped into the Gulf of California; whereupon, each thetan searches for a new body to inhabit. To avoid these inconveniences, Hubbard advised Scientologists to simply refuse to go to Venus after their death.Cempa, Joe; \\"Petrolia's New Neighbors\\", North Coast Journal, June 1991. = Unarius Academy of Science = Founded by Ernest L. Norman and his wife, Ruth, in 1954, the Unarians are a group headquartered in El Cajon, California, who believe that, through the use of Four-dimensional space physics, they are able to communicate with supposed advanced intelligent beings that allegedly exist on \\"higher frequency\\" planes. Unarians believe in past lives and hold that the Solar System was once inhabited by ancient interplanetary civilizations.How Prophecy Never Fails: Interpretive Reason in a Flying-Saucer Group (Sociology of Religion 59.2 (Summer 1998), pp. 157‚Äì170) = Universal Industrial Church of the New World Comforter = The Universal Industrial Church of the New World Comforter is a UFO religion founded in 1967 by Allen Michael. In 1947, Allen Noonan was a pictorial sign painter in Long Beach, California, who that year claimed to have an encounter with Galactic Space Beings. While painting a signboard he said he was beamed up into a Mothership. He then changed his name to Allen Michael. He claimed to have physically encountered a flying saucer in 1954 at Giant Rock in the Mojave Desert of California. During the Summer of Love, he began the One World Family Commune with a vegan restaurant on the northeast corner of Haight and Scott streets in San Francisco, California, called the Here and Now. 7 similar restaurants followed. His communal group lived in two large houses during the early 1970s in Berkeley, California. In 1969, the commune established a vegan restaurant in a much larger space on Telegraph Avenue and Haste Street in Berkeley and the name of the restaurant was changed to the One World Family Natural Food Center. They published a vegetarian cookbook called Cosmic Cookery. There was a large mural on the side of the restaurant painted by Allen Michael that had written above it the phrase Farmers, Workers, Soldiers Unite ‚Äî The People's Spiritual Reformation 1776‚Äì1976! The farmer was holding a pitchfork, the worker was holding a hammer, and the soldier was holding a gun, and they had their arms around each other's shoulders. Above the three were three flying saucers coming in for a landing. In 1973, Allen Michael founded \\"The Universal Industrial Church of the New World Comforter\\" and published the first volume of his channeled revelations, The Everlasting Gospel. In 1975, the church headquarters and the vegetarian restaurant relocated to Stockton, California. Allen Noonan ran for president of the United States in the 1980 and 1984 elections on the Utopian Synthesis Party ticket.Michael, Allen The Everlasting Gospel Universal Industrial Church of the New World Comforter 1975 = Universe People = The Universe People or Cosmic people of light powers (Czech: Vesm√≠rn√≠ lid√© sil svƒõtla) is a Czech movement centered around Ivo A. Benda. Its belief system is based upon the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations communicating with Benda and other \\"contacters\\" since October 1997 telepathically and later by direct personal contact. According to Benda, those civilizations operate a fleet of spaceships led by Ashtar (sometimes written Ashtar Sheran) orbiting and closely watching the Earth, helping the good and waiting to transport the followers into another dimension. The Universe People teaching incorporates various elements from ufology (some foreign \\"contacters\\" are credited, though often also renounced after a time as misguided or deceptive), Christianity (Jesus was a \\"fine-vibrations\\" being) and conspiracy theories (forces of evil are supposed to plan compulsory chipping of the populace).  UFOs in other Non-UFO religions = Share International and Maitreya = The Theosophical-influenced guru Benjamin Creme of Share International claimed that the Messiah figure he referred to as Maitreya is in telepathic contact with Nordic aliens.Creme, Benjamin Maitreya's Mission‚ÄîVolume II Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 217 Creme believed that Nordic aliens live on the etheric plane of Venus and visited earth in flying saucers. Creme accepted George Adamski's UFO sightings as valid.Creme, Benjamin The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom London:1980 Tara Press Page 205 According to Creme, the Venusians have mother ships up to four miles long. It is also believed by the Theosophists in general as well as Creme in particular that the governing deity of Earth, Sanat Kumara (who is believed to live in a city called Shamballa located above the Gobi desert on the etheric plane of Earth), is a Nordic alien who originally came from Venus 18,500,000 years ago.Creme, Benjamin The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom London:1980 Tara Press Page 117 The followers of Benjamin Creme believe there is regular flying saucer traffic between Venus and Shamballah and that crop circles are mostly caused by flying saucers. = Ascended Master Teachings = The Ascended Master Teachings are a group of religions based on Theosophy. In the traditional Ascended Master Teachings of Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet, no mention is made of UFOs or flying saucers. However, the Ascended Master Teachings teacher Joshua David Stone in his teachings began, beginning in 1993, to refer to Ashtar, believed by some UFO enthusiasts to be the commander of a flying saucer fleet called the \\"Ashtar Galactic Command\\" that operates near Earth (manned mostly by Venusians), as a Master along with the more traditional ascended masters. He continued to include \\"Ashtar\\" on his list of ascended masters that he mentioned he received dictations from when speaking at his yearly Wesak Festival Mount Shasta gatherings that began to be held in 1996. Stone also taught that the Master Jesus, under his \\"galactic\\" name Sananda, sometimes rides with \\"Commander Ashtar\\" in his flying saucer fleet.Stone, Joshua David Cosmic Ascension: Your Cosmic Map Home (March 1998) (Book 6 of the multi- volume series, The Easy-To-Read Encyclopedia of the Spiritual Path) Joshua David Stone: \\"The Ashtar Command‚ÄîThe Airborne Division of the Great White Brotherhood\\". Retrieved from http://www.luisprada.com/Protected/the_ashtar_command_ii.htm. = Tempelhofgesellschaft = A neo-Nazi esoteric Nazi Gnostic sect headquartered in Vienna, Austria, called the Tempelhofgesellschaft, founded in the early 1990s, teaches what it calls a form of Marcionism. They distribute pamphlets claiming that the Aryan race originally came to Atlantis from the star Aldebaran (this information is supposedly based on \\"ancient Sumerian manuscripts\\"). They maintain that the Aryans from Aldebaran derive their power from the vril energy of the Black Sun. They teach that since the Aryan race is of extraterrestrial origin it has a divine mission to dominate all the other races. It is believed by adherents of this religion that an enormous space fleet is on its way to Earth from Aldebaran which, when it arrives, will join forces with the \\"Nazi Flying Saucers from Antarctica\\" to establish the Western Imperium.Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke (2002).

The Age. 22 September 2007. \\"2. Early life The brothers were born in Kuwait to Iraqi parents. Their father, a merchant, moved to Kuwait from the Iraqi city of Basra together with some other fifty Jewish families to form the Jewish community of Kuwait. When Saleh was 10 years old, and Daud 8, they received a gift from their uncle who came back from a business trip to India: a violin and an oud. Saleh began studying music from Khaled Al-Bakar, a Kuwaiti Oud player. He soon began to compose his own music. His first song, \\"Walla Ajabni Jamalec\\" (By God, I admire your beauty), is still heard on Gulf radio stations. While still children, the brothers started performing before dignitaries in Kuwait. Soon enough, Iraqi record companies began recording the brothers and distributing their music throughout the Kingdom of Iraq. Because of Saleh & Daud's success, the Al-Kuwaity family moved back to Basra in Iraq. There Saleh joined the Qanun master Yusuf Zaarur, and learned how to write in the \\"Makam\\" style of composition, considered the highest and most prestigious of all styles in Arab music. The brothers started performing in the nightclubs of Basra, and after a while ‚Äì a result of their growing success ‚Äì the family moved to Baghdad. Life in Israel The brothers helped the Jewish community in Iraq, both with material aid for the needy and with influence in the political establishment when necessary, and their being Jews was generally not problematic. Yet their fortunes changed quickly along with those of Jews in many Arab countries after 1948, with the expansion of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the association of Jews throughout the Arab world with the enemy Israeli state, and the rising tide of exclusive Arab Nationalism. In the beginning of the 1950s, facing increasing persecution in Iraq, the al-Kuwaiti family decided to flee the country and join the big wave of emigration to the State of Israel. In spite of their wealth and of the wide range of possibilities before them Saleh and Daud had to leave everything behind. Saleh and Daud's status in Iraq was of no use to them when faced with the difficulties of finding their place in Israel. Their welcome in the new country was harsh, and due to a number of factors. First, along with the masses of Jewish refugees from Arab lands, the brothers were sent first to live in a temporary \\"Ma'abara\\" in Beer Yaakov, a transit camp with very poor conditions. Later they moved to the poor Hatikva quarter of Tel Aviv, where they would play in the Noah caf√©. Secondly, the dominant ideology of the Israeli state at that time sought to suppress eliminate vestiges of 'diaspora culture', including Yiddish, Sephardi/Ladino, and Judeo-Arabic music. Thus, the mainstream Hebrew-language radio, which at that time was entirely state- owned and wished to promote only Western-sounding music, did not play any Middle Eastern music, even that Jewish performers of Arabic music such as the al-Kuwaiti brothers, their Iraqi contemporary Salima Murad, Salim Halali (an Algerian- and French-Jewish star), Laila Mourad (an Egyptian Jewish singer and actress), or Zohra Al Fassiya (a famous Jewish singer in Morocco). Despite the prejudice against their music in Israel, Saleh and Daoud found a small outlet for their music on the Arabic network of \\"The Voice of Israel\\" shortwave radio service (which broadcast to Arab countries), soon becoming two of its leaders. They performed as guest soloists with the Arabic orchestra of the Israeli Radio led by Zuzu Mussa. For many years the al-Kuwaiti brothers gave a regular live radio performances, with thousands of Arabic speaking people in Israel and millions in Iraq and Kuwait listening. Thanks to the Arabic language shortwave broadcasts of the Israel Broadcasting Authority (which no longer exist), dozens of songs they wrote and composed in Israel also became hits in the Arab world. In fact, despite the constant state of war between Israel and most of the Arab world, the state-controlled radio in Kuwait and Iraq kept on broadcasting their music; however, while earlier generations of Arab listeners had been familiar and comfortable with the brothers and their Jewish identity, Arabic radio after the 1970s, increasingly under the control of nationalist movements such as the Ba'ath Party, began to change this by omitting their name, their Jewish identity, or their Israeli citizenship from credits, causing this history to be forgotten. Legacy Saleh and Daoud al-Kuwaiti's songs are still played on the radio throughout the Arab world, and they have fans among both the Iraqi and Kuwaiti people and with Iraqi and Kuwaiti expatriates. In 2009, a street in the Hatikva Quarter of Tel Aviv was named Al Kuwaiti Brothers Street in their memory.https://www.kqed.org/arts/128400/from- israel-a-jewish-singer-with-arab-roots-revives-the-music-of-his-familys- pasthttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7918339.stm In 2011, Daoud's grandson, Israeli rock musician Dudu Tassa, formed the band Dudu Tassa and the Kuwaitis to play his grandfather's and great-uncle's music.

People who have a wingman can have more than one wingman. Formerly \\"Do Your Friends Help (or Hurt) Your Chances to Find Love?\\". A wingman is someone who is on the \\"inside\\" and is used to help someone with intimate relationships. In general, one person's wingman will help him or her avoid attention from undesirable prospective partners or attract desirable ones, or both.  Origin  The term originated in combat aviation in various international military aviation communities shortly before and after the advent of fighter jets. Pilots flying in formation, especially when in combat training or in actual aerial combat, refer to the pilot immediately next to them (traditionally on their right, sometimes on either side) as their \\"wingman\\" (the man on their wing). In actual aerial combat pilots are often trained to attack and defend in pairs watching out for each other, thereby making the term even more clearly demonstrated. The term is also very commonly used in combat aviation on longer range aviation patrols which are often carried out by only two fighter planes, sometimes manned by only two pilots depending on the type of aircraft. On these two plane patrols (Air Force) or \\"watches\\" (Naval Aviators flying protective patterns around surface vessels on timed intervals) referring to the pilot that an aviator is teamed with on patrol as their \\"wingman\\" is very common.  In sociology  In 2007, sociologist David Grazian interviewed male students at the University of Pennsylvania on their dating habits, and postulated that the wingman role was part of collective \\"girl hunt\\" rituals that allow young men to collectively perform masculinity. Grazian writes:  Popular usage  Popular media and informal discourse describe a situation in which a pair of friends are socialising together, approaching other pairs and groups while avoiding the awkwardness or perceived aggression of acting alone. The wingman strikes up conversation and proposes group social activities, providing their friend with a pleasant and unthreatening social pretext to chat or flirt with a particular attractive person. The wingman can also keep their friend safe by preventing them from drinking excessively or behaving in a reckless or socially embarrassing way. The wingman can occupy the attention of any less attractive people in the other group, allowing their friend to express an interest in the most attractive group member. Despite the name, wingmen are not exclusively male; women can also act as wingmen. Wingmen also do not necessarily share their friend's sexual orientation; gay people can be wingmen for straight friends, and vice versa. Certain sources describe the wingman role as a part of predatory heterosexual male seduction, with women referred to as \\"targets\\" and men as \\"pilots\\". Others highlight the ability of a wingman (of any gender) to step in and rescue their female friend from unwanted persistent sexual advances. American entrepreneur Thomas Edwards founded a dating service called The Professional Wingman, in which he performs the wingman role for socially reticent clients, coaching them on the social skills needed to approach potential romantic partners in bar settings. Edwards emphasises that he is not a pick-up artist.  In fiction and popular culture  The term 'wingman' was popularised by its use in the 1986 romantic military action drama film Top Gun, in which US Navy pilots are shown in a bar pursuing women in pairs, similarly to their in-flight tactics. Nick 'Goose' Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards) is the best friend and wingman to Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell (Tom Cruise). In a much-quoted line from the end of the film, Maverick's former archrival, Tom 'Iceman' Kazansky (Val Kilmer), shows his respect to Maverick when he says, \\"You can be my wingman anytime.\\" Other characters claimed as wingmen in literature, film and popular culture include: * Horatio, Hamlet's best friend in William Shakespeare's play. * Cyrano de Bergerac, the witty but ugly protagonist of Edmond Rostand's 1897 play, who helps his handsome but foolish friend Christian to woo Roxane, the woman with whom Cyrano himself is hopelessly in love. * Dr John Watson, the trusted friend and colleague of Sherlock Holmes. * Samwise Gamgee, the loyal companion of Frodo Baggins in JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. * Bud Baxter (Jack Lemmon) in Billy Wilder's 1960 film The Apartment, who loans his New York apartment to four of his bosses as a place for their extramarital affairs. * Sharon and Susan (Hayley Mills), twin sisters raised separately, who meet at summer camp and decide to matchmake their divorced parents in the film series The Parent Trap. * Mr Spock, the endlessly logical Vulcan second-in-command to Captain Kirk in Star Trek. * Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), who lends his father's prized Ferrari to his best friend Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) in the film Ferris Bueller's Day Off. * Lisa (Kelly LeBrock), a computer-generated 'ideal woman' in the film Weird Science, who teaches horny nerds Gary Wallace (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt Donnelly (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) how to approach girls. * Trent (Vince Vaughn) in Doug Liman's 1996 film Swingers, who tries to get his heartbroken friend Mike (Jon Favreau) back in the dating game. * Roger Swanson (Campbell Scott) in the film Roger Dodger, an obnoxious pick-up artist who coaches his nephew Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) on how to seduce women. * Jack (Thomas Haden Church) in Alexander Payne's film Sideways, who helps his downtrodden friend Miles (Paul Giamatti) to pursue the beautiful Maya (Virginia Madsen). * Officers Slater and Michaels (Bill Hader and Seth Rogen) in the film Superbad, who after a night of carousing with nerdy teen Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), 'fake arrest' him to make him appear cool to his crush. * Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris) in the TV sitcom How I Met Your Mother, who seeks to pass on his wealth of pick-up artist knowledge to his friend Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor). * Magic Carpet, the sentient carpet from the Disney film Aladdin.

It was active in supporting conscientious objectors (\\"CO's\\"), war resisters and draft evaders during the Vietnam War. Founded in Philadelphia in 1948 and dissolved in 2011, CCCO emphasized the needs of secular and activist COs, while other organizations supporting COs principally focused on religious objectors and/or legislative reform and government relations.

Freeman, Office of the Dean, Cornell University (1993) At its largest between about 1966 and 1971, CCCO maintained regional offices and staff in Chicago, Atlanta, Denver and San Francisco, in addition to the national office in Philadelphia. It published multiple editions of a Handbook for Conscientious Objectors, the looseleaf (and frequently updated) Draft Counselor's Handbook, and Advice for Conscientious Objectors in the Armed Forces (by Mike Wittels and CCCO Western Region, 1979,https://www.worldcat.org/title/advice-for-conscientious-objectors-in-the- armed-forces/oclc/22126968 later updated and revised by other staff, including Robert A.

Three editions were published, 1969-1971 CCCO staff trained hundreds of volunteer \\"draft counselors\\" throughout the United States to give informed and non-directive advice during the Vietnam era to as many as 10,000 young men exploring their choices in the face of the draft, including such well-known COs as Muhammad Ali and Arlo Guthrie.https://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/DG051-099/dg073CentralComm(CCCO)/dg073CCCO.html Swarthmore College Library Peace Collection, CCCO CCCO also offered counseling to military members opposed to current wars as well as civilians faced with decisions regarding legal requirements for Selective Service registration. CCCO Western Region, based in San Francisco, was the last regional office to remain open as the organization scaled back after the end of the Vietnam War, and as draft registration without active conscription became the norm in the U.S. after 1980. The Philadelphia office closed in about 1994, having transferred national control of the organization to San Francisco in 1989. In CCCO's final years, the office moved to Oakland, where activities focused on counter-recruitment activism through its \\"Military Out of Our Schools\\" program, and production of a youth magazine, AWOL! Youth for Peace and Revolution, in collaboration with the War Resisters League. CCCO's \\"Third World Outreach Program\\" focused on the issue of the \\"poverty draft,\\" viewing impoverished young people, disproportionately people of color, as effectively coerced into military service by a lack of viable options in the civilian economy.

Persaud‚Äôs novels deal with the intricacies of Caribbean identity and individual and communal memory. Her first novel Butterfly in the Wind was published by Peepal Tree Press in 1990, and in it Persaud records the mental conflicts that attending a Catholic school caused for a Hindu girl. The novel deals in an imaginatively autobiographical way with the first 18 years of her life. Persaud records that her reading of Edmund Gosse‚Äôs Father and Son: A Study of Two Temperaments and Laurie Lee‚Äôs Cider with Rosie were significant influences in writing this book. It was followed by her second novel, Sastra, which was published in 1993 also by Peepal Tree Press. In one of the episodes, Persaud draws on her tertiary experience. Both novels explore the tensions within Hinduism between the somewhat puritanical, patriarchal forms orthodox Hinduism took in the Trinidad of her childhood and youth and its latent capacity for a sensuous embrace of life. In October 1994, the Trinidad Guardian published the bestseller list for Caribbean books published abroad. Sastra was placed first on the list and Butterfly in the Wind was fifth. Following extensive visits to Guyana (the birthplace of her husband), she wrote For the Love of My Name, published by Peepal Tree Press in 2000, a novel which moves far from the more familiar domestic Hindu territory of the earlier two novels. Though the fictional island of Maya draws heavily on the actuality of Guyana from the mid-1960s to the 1980s, it has resonances for states throughout the world where political repression and ethnic conflict have gone hand in hand. In March 2004, Raise the Lanterns High was published by BlackAmber Publishers and in 2012, Persaud's fifth novel, Daughters of Empire, was published by Peepal Tree Press. There has been increasing recognition of Lakshmi Persaud‚Äôs work by academic institutions. Her novels are being used as texts in Caribbean and post-colonial literature courses in a number of universities and extracts from her novels have been used in English exams in the Caribbean.  Awards  In recognition of her work, Warwick University established a 'Lakshmi Persaud Research Fellowship' at its Centre for Translation and Comparative Cultural Studies. In 2012, in recognition of the 50th Anniversary of the Independence of Trinidad and Tobago, the National Library and Information System Authority (NALIS) awarded Lakshmi Persaud with a Lifetime Literary Award for her significant contribution to the development of Trinidad and Tobago‚Äôs Literature. In October 2013, Persaud was conferred with an Honorary Doctorate, Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.), by The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, in recognition of her literary contributions.

Since 1991, collegiate teams with the backing of industry and government have fielded autonomous flying robots in an attempt to perform missions requiring robotic behaviors never before exhibited by a flying machine. In 1990, the term ‚Äúaerial robotics‚Äù was coined by competition creator Robert Michelson to describe a new class of small highly intelligent flying machines. The successive years of competition saw these aerial robots grow in their capabilities from vehicles that could at first barely maintain themselves in the air, to the most recent automatons which are self-stable, self-navigating, and able to interact with their environment‚Äîespecially objects on the ground. The primary goal of the competition has been to provide a reason for the state of the art in aerial robotics to move forward. Challenges set before the international collegiate community have been geared towards producing advances in the state of the art at an increasingly aggressive pace. From 1991 through 2009, a total of six missions have been proposed. Each of them involved fully autonomous robotic behavior that was undemonstrated at the time and impossible for any robotic system fielded anywhere in the world, even by the most sophisticated military robots belonging to the super powers. In October 2013 a new seventh mission was proposed. As with previous missions, the Mission 7 involves totally autonomous flying robots, but this is the first IARC mission to involve the interaction between multiple ground robots and even simultaneous competition between two aerial robots working against each other and against the clock to influence the behavior and trajectory of up to ten autonomous ground robots. In 2016, the International Aerial Robotics Competition and its creator were officially recognized during the Georgia legislative session in the form of \\"Senate Resolution 1255‚Äù which recognized it as the longest running aerial robotics competition in the world and for having been responsible for moving forward the state of the art in aerial robotics on several occasions during the past quarter century. History=First mission= Third mission Southern Polytechnic State University helicopter-based aerial robot flying near fire hazard The initial mission to move a metallic disc from one side of an arena to another with a completely autonomous flying robot was seen by many as almost impossible. The college teams continued to improve their entries over the next two years when the competition saw its first autonomous takeoff, flight, and landing by a team from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Three years later in 1995 a team from Stanford University was able to acquire a single disk and move it from one side of the arena to the other in a fully autonomous flight‚Äîhalf a decade earlier than some pundits had predicted. =Second mission= The competition mission was then toughened and made a bit less abstract by requiring teams to search for a toxic waste dump, map the location of partially buried randomly oriented toxic waste drums, identify the contents of each drum from the hazard labels found somewhere on the outside of each drum, and bring a sample back from one of the drums‚Äîall without any human intervention whatsoever. In 1996 a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston University, with backing from Draper Labs, created a small fully autonomous flying robot that repeatedly and correctly mapped the location of all five of the toxic waste drums, and correctly identified the contents of two from the air, thereby completing approximately seventy five percent of the mission. The following year, an aerial robot developed by a team from Carnegie Mellon University completed the entire mission. =Third mission= Third mission autonomous pneumatic animatron designed by Prof. Michelson. TU-Berlin helicopter-based aerial robot‚Äîwinner of third mission in 2000 The third mission was begun in 1998. It was a search and rescue mission requiring fully autonomous robots to take off, fly to a disaster area and search for survivors and the dead amid raging fires, broken water mains, clouds of toxic gas, and rubble from destroyed buildings. The scenario was recreated at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hazardous Material Management and Emergency Response (HAMMER) training facility where the above hazards could be recreated. Because of the realism of the scenario, animatrons were used instead of human actors to simulate survivors incapable of extracting themselves from the disaster area. An aerial robot from Germany's Technische Universit√§t Berlin was able to detect and avoid all of the obstacles (many of which could have destroyed the robot itself), identify all the dead on the ground and the survivors (distinguishing between the two based on movement), and relay pictures of the survivors along with their locations back to first responders who would attempt a rescue. This mission was completed in 2000. =Fourth mission= The fourth mission was initiated in 2001. This fully autonomous mission involved three scenarios requiring the same autonomous behavior. * The first scenario was a hostage rescue mission where a submarine 3 kilometers off the coast of a third world nation must send in an aerial robot to find a coastal city, identify the embassy where the hostages are being held, locate valid openings in the embassy building, enter (or send in a sensor probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the hostages back 3 km to the submarine prior to mounting an amphibious assault on the embassy to free the hostages. * The second scenario revolved around the discovery of an ancient mausoleum by archaeologists. An ancient virus contained in the mausoleum has quickly killed all the archaeological team, but prior to their death they radioed that a very important and undocumented tapestry is hanging inside. The local government is planning to cleanse the area with a fuel-air explosion in 15 minutes, so the scientists will send in an autonomous aerial robot to find the mausoleum, enter it (or send in a sensor probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the tapestry back prior to the destruction of the mausoleum and its contents. * The third scenario involved an explosion at a nuclear reactor facility which shuts down two of three reactors. Everyone is killed in the disaster and scientists must send in an aerial robot to find the operating reactor building, enter the building (or send in a sensor probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the control panels to determine if a melt-down is imminent. The scientists are forced to maintain a 3 kilometer stand-off distance due to the extreme radiation hazard. All three missions involve the same elements: # Rapid ingress over a 3 km path # Location of a building complex # Location of a specific building within the complex # Identification of valid openings in that building # Entry into the building by the aerial robot or a sensor-carrying subvehicle # Relay of pictures from within back to the launch point 3 km away # Mission completion within 15 minutes # Full autonomy throughout all aspects of the mission This fourth IARC mission was conducted at the U.S. Army's Fort Benning Soldier Battle Lab using the McKenna MOUT (Military Operations on Urban Terrain) site, which replicates a complete German village created for war gaming when the main cold war threat was perceived to come through the Fulda Gap into Germany. The fourth mission was completed in 2008 with various teams having already demonstrated all of the required aerial robotic behaviors mandated by the fourth mission rules, except being able to demonstrate these behaviors seamlessly in under 15 minutes‚Äîa feat considered by the organizer and judges to be inevitable given a bit more time, and therefore no longer a significant challenge. Thus the fourth mission was terminated, $80,000 in awards distributed, and the fifth mission established. A virtual representation of the McKenna MOUT site was developed by the Army Research Laboratory in 2002 for soldier training and experimentation. =Fifth mission= Fourth/fifth mission nuclear reactor complex explosion scenario The fifth mission picked up where the fourth mission left off by demonstrating the fully autonomous aerial robotic behaviors necessary to rapidly negotiate the confined internal spaces of a structure once it has been penetrated by an air vehicle. The nuclear reactor complex explosion scenario of the fourth mission was used as the backdrop for the fifth mission. The fifth mission required a fully autonomous aerial vehicle (presupposed to have been launched from a \\"mothership\\" just outside the structure as demonstrated during the fourth mission) to penetrate the structure and negotiate the more complex interior space containing hallways, small rooms, obstacles, and dead ends in order to search for a designated target without the aid of global-positioning navigational aids, and relay pictures back to a monitoring station some distance from the structure. The First Symposium on Indoor Flight Issues was held in conjunction with this 2009 IARC event. =Sixth mission= The sixth mission began in 2010 as an extension of the fifth mission theme of autonomous indoor flight behavior, however the sixth mission demanded more advanced behaviors than were currently possible by any aerial robot extant in 2010. This espionage mission involved covertly stealing a flash drive from a particular room in a building, for which there was no a priori knowledge of the floor plan, and depositing an identical drive to avoid detection of the theft. The 2010 Symposium on Indoor Flight Issues was held concurrently at the University of Puerto Rico - Mayag√ºez during the 20th anniversary competition. The Official Rules for the 6th Mission are available at the Competition web site. =Seventh mission= University of Michigan mission 7a aerial robot at the 2014 American Venue The seventh mission began in 2014 demanding more advanced behaviors than were currently possible by any aerial robot extant in 2014. The mission involves autonomous aerial robots controlling autonomous ground robots tactually. The mission is divided into mission 7a and 7b. Mission 7a requires a single autonomous aerial robot to herd as many of the 10 autonomous ground robot targets as possible, across the green boundary line in under 10 minutes. The arena is 20m x 20m (65.62 feet x 65.62 feet) and has a green boundary line at one end, a red boundary line at the opposite end, and white sidelines. The pattern on the floor of the arena is unknown to the aerial robot designers a priori, however it is known that there is a 1m x 1m (3.28 feet x 3.28 feet) white square grid pattern overlaid upon the arena. Other than what is seen on the arena floor, there are neither walls for SLAM mapping nor GPS availability. Techniques such as optical flow or optical odometry are possible solutions to navigation within the arena. In addition to the 10 ground robot targets, there are 4 \\"tall\\" robot obstacles (as much as 2m (6.56 feet in height) which circulate within the arena. Collisions with obstacle ground robots ends the run with no score. The (non obstacle) ground robot targets automatically reverse direction every 20 seconds and have up to 20¬∞ of noise applied to their trajectories at 5 second intervals. If an aerial robot touches the ground robot on top with a magnet, the ground robot will turn clockwise 45¬∞. If the aerial robot blocks its forward motion by landing in front of it, the ground robot targets will reverse direction. Ground robot targets that feely escape the arena count against the aerial robot's team score. The autonomous aerial robots must decide which ground robots are in imminent danger of crossing any boundary but the green one, and redirect them toward the green boundary. Five of the 10 ground robot targets are green and 5 are red. Mission 7b pits the best teams from 7a against each other, one on one, to get as many of its own green ground robots across the green boundary while misdirecting the opponent's red ground robots. Similarly, the opponent is trying to get as many of its red ground robots across the red boundary while misdirecting the opponent's green ground robots. The Official Rules for the 7th mission are available at the Competition web site. In addition, a video derived from the August 2014 events held at the American Venue (the Georgia Institute of Technology's McAmish Pavilion) and Asia/Pacific Venue (Yantai China), explains the details of mission 7 graphically. On 28 September 2018 the overall winner of mission 7 was announced as Zhejiang University. Details can be found at the Official IARC website along with a video of the winning flight by Zhejiang University and in Beihang University press release. In all, 52 teams from 12 nations were entered as competitors for mission 7. =Eighth mission= IARC mission 8 scenario In 2018, the 27th year of the International Aerial Robotics Competition, the 8th mission was announced. The Official Rules for the 8th mission are available at the Competition web site along with a video summarizing the 8th mission. Mission 8 focuses on non-electronic human-machine interaction for the first time, with four aerial robots assisting humans to complete tasks that one person cannot independently accomplish. The gist of mission 8 involves a swarm of autonomous aerial robots working with a human to achieve a task in the presence of hostile Sentry aerial robots which are autonomously trying to impede the human. The Sentry robots carry lasers (similar to those used in Laser tag) which will disable the human and end the run after a specified number of ‚Äúhits‚Äù. The task is structured so that it can not be achieved by the human without the assistance of the swarm of aerial Helpers that are directed only by the human's gestures and voice commands. In 2018, the inaugural year of mission 8, the American Venue was held on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Asia/Pacific Venue was conducted at Beihang University in Beijing China. In 2019, Mission 8 was successfully completed in Kunming China in under 8 minutes by three teams. Of those, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) was able to complete the mission in 5 minutes and 6 seconds, representing the fastest completion time. Completing the mission within 10 seconds of NUAA, was Sun Yat Sen University. Harbin Institute also completed the mission, but did so with only 12 seconds remaining on the clock. By completing the mission in the least time, NUAA won the grand prize of $10,000. Details of the winning performances can be found at the Official IARC website along with a video of the winning flight by NUAA =Ninth mission= IARC mission 9 scenario In 2021, the 30th year of the International Aerial Robotics Competition, the 9th mission will commence. The Official Rules for the 9th mission are available at the Competition web site along with a video summarizing the objectives of the 9th mission. Mission 9 focuses on fully autonomous flight using ONLY onboard computing (no data links except for kill switch and safety pilot override) while avoiding obstacles and other aerial robots over a 3km route, to replace a 2kg (4.4 pound), approximately 1m (39 inch) long communications module on the mast of a moving platform (a boat in Sea State 2) and return home in under 9 minutes. Participants Collegiate teams participating in the IARC have come primarily from the United States and the People's Republic of China, but also from Germany, England, Switzerland, Spain, Canada, Chile, Qatar, Iran, and India. Teams range in size from several students, up to twenty or more. Both undergraduate and graduate students populate the teams, but some teams have been composed entirely of undergraduates or postgraduates. Industry is not permitted to enter, but it may assist the student teams with funding and equipment. Aerial robots Unconventional aerial robotic flying machine from the University of British Columbia The aerial robots vary in design from fixed wing airplanes, to conventional helicopters, to ducted fans, to airships, and beyond to bizarre hybrid creations. Because the competition focuses on fully autonomous behavior, the air vehicle itself is of less importance. Teams choosing to develop new air vehicle types have never won, as they are disadvantaged in comparison to those which adapt existing, working, air vehicles, and can therefore concentrate on performing the mission rather than developing something that will fly at all. As a result, adaptations of conventional rotary wing and fixed wing entries have always been the overall winners, with airships and ducted fans a close second. Aerial robots must be unmanned and autonomous, and must compete based on their ability to sense the semi-structured environment of the competition arena. They may be intelligent or preprogrammed, but they must not be controlled by a remote human operator. Computational power need not be carried on the air vehicle itself. Computers operating from standard commercial power may be set up outside the competition arena boundary and uni- or bi-directional data may be transmitted to/from the vehicles in the arena. Size or weight constraints are normally placed on the aerial robots, which must be equipped with a method of manually activated remote override of the primary propulsion system. Venues The International Aerial Robotics Competition was first held on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology (first mission, 1991‚Äì1995). Walt Disney World's EPCOT Center asked that the competition move to its location for the second mission, where it was held at the entrance to the park during 1996 and 1997. The U.S. Department of Energy's Hazardous Material Management and Emergency Response (HAMMER) training facility then brought the IARC to Richland WA from 1998 to 2000 for the conduct of the third mission. The fourth mission began in 2001 at the U.S. Navy's Webster Field in Maryland, but was moved to the Canada Olympic Village (Calgary, Canada) the following year because Webster Field was unsuitable. Weather, difficulty in airspace management, and extreme electromagnetic interference drove the IARC to an ideal venue where these issues could be managed: the U.S. Army's Fort Benning Soldier Battle Lab, McKenna MOUT site. For the fourth mission scenarios, the existence of the uninhabited McKenna village provides the perfect venue. Due to the nature of the challenge, the fifth mission took place in an indoor location at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez. The sixth mission was initiated in the coliseum on the campus of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez during August 2010, however the sixth mission was moved to Grand Forks, North Dakota beginning in 2011. A second venue was established in Beijing China beginning in 2012. This \\"Asia/Pacific Venue\\" serves the Asian and Australian continents while the \\"American Venue\\" serves the American, European, and African continents. Teams are free to enter the competition at either venue. Beginning in August 2012, the two venues conducted the sixth mission under the same set of rules. The seventh mission was begun at the McAmish Pavilion on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology (American Venue) and in Yantai, Shandong Province, China (Asia/Pacific Venue) during August 2014. The 8th Mission American Venue is being held on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Asia/Pacific Venue is being conducted at Beihang University in Beijing China, beginning in August 2018. Fourth mission McKenna MOUT site with specific buildings designated Prizes IARC prizes have traditionally been \\"winner take all\\", although during the competition's early years monetary progress awards were given to further development of the best performers. With the fourth mission it was realized that there would be no quick winners, and that several years of development would be required by each of the teams. Therefore, an incremental \\"growing prize pot\\" was established, to which the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International Foundation adds another US$10,000 each year. The 2008 prize level was set at a total of $80,000. Any team completing the fourth mission in under 15 minutes would receive the entire $80,000 prize, otherwise the prize would be distributed based on 2008 competitor performance most closely approaching the 15-minute mission goal. By 2008, Levels 1 through 3 of the fourth mission had been demonstrated, proving that all required aerial robotic behaviors were possible, but by the end of the 2008 event, no single team was able to sequentially and seamlessly demonstrate all behaviors in under 15 minutes. The $80,000 was therefore divided between the ten finalists: (Georgia Institute of Technology received $27,700; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University $17,700; and Embry Riddle/DeVry Calgary $12,200, with the remainder shared between the other finalists based on merit). $10,000 was awarded to a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2009 which, in addition to receiving the AUVSI-sponsored prize award, also received their $1,000 application fee back under the incentive program outlined in the Official IARC Rules for 2009 which stated that any team completing the fifth mission during the first year of the mission, would receive a full rebate of their application fee. In August 2013, a team from Tsinghua University completed the entire sixth mission, thereby winning $40,000.

The IARC was first established with seed money for logistics and a grand prize that was backed by the Association. After the initial success and tremendous media attention garnered by the IARC, the AUVSI launched the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition a few years later in Detroit, MI. This was organized by AUVSI Board member, Jerry Lane who worked at the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Command at the time. In 1998, the underwater community was represented when AUVSI and the U.S. Office of Naval Research teamed up to offer the first International Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Competition which is held annually in the U.S. All of these competitions, land, sea, and air, have at their core, \\"full autonomy\\" as a distinctive characteristic. The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International Foundation continues to support these competitions with logistics and prize money although there are numerous industry co-sponsors as well.

Early life Alfonso Carlos was the second son of Infante Juan of Spain, Count of Montiz√≥n and Archduchess Maria Beatrix of Austria-Este. Since his parents separated when he was young, he and his elder brother were raised in Modena under the tutelage of his maternal uncle Duke Francis V of Modena. Military career In 1868 Alfonso Carlos joined the Papal Zouaves which had been formed to defend the Papal States from the army of the Kingdom of Italy. In 1869 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. In September 1870 he fought for the pope during the Capture of Rome where he defended the Porta Pia. When he was ordered to surrender, he refused to give up his sword which had belonged to his grandfather Carlos V. He escaped to Toulon in a French naval ship. In 1872 Alfonso Carlos joined the armies of his older brother Carlos, Duke of Madrid, in the Third Carlist War in Spain. He was appointed commanding general of the Royal Army of Catalonia and distinguished himself at the Battle of Alpens in July 1873 and the siege of Cuenca in July 1874. In spite of these successes, however, the Carlists eventually lost the war which was over by February 1876. Campaigner against duelling Alfonso Carlos spent most of the rest of his life in Austria where he owned castles at Puchheim and at Ebenzweier near Altm√ºnster, and a house in the Theresianumgasse in Vienna. He devoted himself to the abolition of duelling. To gain popular support, he wrote a book on the topic in French (translated into German), and several journal articles in English. He used his wide social contacts to encourage the establishment of anti-duelling leagues in the German Empire (with his wife's uncle Charles, 6th Prince of L√∂wenstein- Wertheim-Rosenberg, as President), France, Austria, Italy (under the patronage of King Victor Emmanuel II), Hungary, Belgium, and Spain (with King Alfonso XIII as Honorary President). Claimant to Spanish and French thrones Infante Alfonso Carlos and his wife Maria das Neves of Portugal. On 2 October 1931, at the age of 82, Alfonso Carlos succeeded his nephew Jaime, Duke of Madrid as Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain and legitimist claimant to the throne of France. He issued several manifestos to his Spanish followers including one in August 1932\\"A Romantic Manifesto: Carlist Pretender Will Not Unite Monarchists of Spain\\", The New York Times (4 September 1932): E3. and another in June 1934. He affirmed that he would be \\"succeeded by whoever follows me according to the Salic law and accepts our fundamental proposition of fueros-regional rights\\". Since many Carlists believed that Alfonso Carlos' heir presumptive according to the Salic law, the deposed King Alfonso XIII of Spain, did not hold to traditional principles, Alfonso Carlos designated his nephew Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma as Regent of the Carlist movement. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, Alfonso Carlos instructed his Carlist followers to co-operate with the Nationalists under the command of General Francisco Franco. On 28 September 1936, Alfonso Carlos was hit by a car as he crossed a street in Vienna. He died the next day. His body was buried in the chapel of his castle at Puchheim. The obituary for Alfonso Carlos in The Times described him as \\"a great gentleman ... ; the very picture of distinction in his looks, there was in him a rare combination of uprightness, simplicity, and kindliness; and through it all there ran a vein of deep, unostentatious religious feeling.\\"\\"Don Alfonso Carlos: The Renaissance of Carlism\\", The Times (30 September 1936): 7. Alfonso Carlos was the last male male-line descendant of Infante Carlos, Count of Molina. With his death the position of senior male descendant of King Charles IV of Spain passed to the deposed King Alfonso XIII of Spain. Marriage On 26 April 1871, at Kleinheubach in Bavaria, Alfonso Carlos married Infanta Maria das Neves of Portugal, a daughter of King Miguel of Portugal and Princess Adelaide of L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. They had no children. Maria das Neves accompanied Alfonso Carlos on many of his military campaigns in Spain.

It was used mainly for football matches as it was home to the Lille OSC football club from 1975 until 2004, when the stadium was closed. The club originally planned to have Grimonprez-Jooris redeveloped into a 33,000-seat stadium, but this proposal was rejected, and the Grand Stade Lille M√©tropole was constructed instead. The stadium was officially opened on 28 October 1975, when Lille played a friendly against Dutch side Feyenoord (which ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw) and the last match at the stadium was played on 15 May 2004, Lille's last home game in the 2003‚Äì04 Ligue 1 season against SC Bastia. Lille won the game 2‚Äì0 with Matt Moussilou scoring the last goal in the history of Grimonprez-Jooris. History The club's original stadium Stade Henri-Jooris had been demolished in 1975 in order to allow the enlargement of the Canal de la De√ªle, a navigable waterway which passes through the city of Lille, and the design for a new stadium was made by Lille architect Pierre-Fran√ßois Delannoyla. Although the club wanted the new stadium to retain the old name Stade Henri Jooris (named after Henri Jooris, former Lille OSC manager), the mayor proposed it to be called Stade F√©lix Grimonprez after F√©lix Grimonprez, a former field hockey player who competed in the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1936 Summer Olympics. This resulted in a compromise solution in which the stadium was hence named Stade Grimonprez-Jooris. The stadium's original capacity was 25,000 at the time it was opened, but this was reduced to around 17,000 by 2000 due to the evolution of safety standards. In 2000 the stadium was renovated and the capacity was increased to 21,128 (14,534 seated). However, the stadium still failed to meet FIFA licensing regulations and Lille had to play their 2001‚Äì02 UEFA Champions League matches at the Stade F√©lix- Bollaert. Redevelopment plans and demolition Plans to build a new stadium compliant with UEFA's standards were made in 2002, when the club was privatised. City authorities tried to persuade the club's new owners to redevelop the existing stadium, but they refused and instead opted for a plan to build a new 60,000-seat stadium outside the city, financed as a public- private partnership. However, their search for investors willing to finance the ambitious project was met with little success. In June 2003 the club's board agreed to a new proposal put forward by the city mayor to build a new 33,000-seat stadium on the site of the Grimonprez-Jooris. Preliminary works which included dismantling of training grounds were undertaken, and the delivery was scheduled for 31 December 2004 but was postponed. In the meantime the funding of the project moved from the City Council to the Urban Community of Lille M√©tropole and became 100 percent public. Construction work was then planned to begin in early 2005, but the project faced opposition from preservationists who successfully prevented the project to obtain necessary permits as the site of the stadium was close to the 17th-century Citadel of Lille. The delays forced Lille OSC to play their league matches at Stadium Nord Lille M√©tropole and their 2005‚Äì06 UEFA Champions League games at Stade de France in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis. After two years of court battles, local courts had declared issued building permits void in July and December 2005, which meant that Grimonprez-Jooris II would never come into existence. Once the dismantling of training grounds was completed, the club moved their facilities to Camphin-en-P√©v√®le. The failed project cost the city of Lille 6 million euros, including 3 million paid to the architecture bureau, 2 million in damages to businesses which invested in the project and 1 million for court fees. The future of the stadium was unclear until January 2007 when the Urban Community of Lille M√©tropole decided to fund the demolition of the stadium. The demolition works finally began in March 2010.

He is credited with introducing free verse poetry to Sinhala. He became blind later in his life and still managed to write 16 books with help from his sister. The second stage of Sinhala short stories begins with G.B. Senanayake's short stories. Though mainly focused on short stories Senanayake also wrote Novels and Poetry as well. He introduced 'Nisandas' during a time when Sinhala poetry was in need of a different style. G.B. Senanayake was a writer who was very concerned about being grammatically correct in writing. Biography Born on 13 July in the year 1913 in Wekada , Panadura, Gunathilaka Bandara Senanayake was the youngest of a family of four boys. He had his primary education at Sri sumangala college in Panadura. Then he had his secondary education at Ananda College Colombo. Due to economic problems he gave up schooling at the age of 14. Later he did further studies on his own. At the age of 18 he started going to the public library in Colombo which gave him the opportunity to access thousands of books. G.B. Senanayake calls the public library his own university. Martin Wickramasinghe, then editor of the 'Dinamina' newspaper recognising G.B. Senanayake's abilities offered him a job at Lake House. For some time Senanayake worked as a professional journalist at 'Dinamina' and 'Sinhala Bauddhaya'. Later he left Lake House and while living an unmarried life devoted his time to writing books. G.B. Senanayake was awarded the Sahithya Shoori (literary doctrine) award by the Sri Jayawardanapura University in 1985. During the later part of his life Senanayake started losing his eyesight. Yet notwithstanding, he didn't give up writing. 'Vinividimi Andura' is a book written during that time. G.B. Senanayake died on 16 March 1985. Literary work At the age of 19 he started writing short stories to the newspapers. Though they weren't published he didn't give up. This was how Martin Wikramasinghe got to know about Senanayake's talents. Senanayake's first collection of short stories was 'Duppathun Nethi Lokaya' which was published in 1945. This was followed by 'Paliganima' (revenge), published in 1946. The works he included in 'Paliganima\\" calling works between prose and poetry is considered as the beginning of 'Nisandas' (Free Verse Poetry). Some of his books are used as text books for Sinhala General Certificate of Education Advanced Level examination and at Universities. Three of his novels won the Sinhala Literary Awards granted by the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. When he lost this eyesight he was halfway through writing the book 'Sahithya Sithuwili Dharshana'. When he declared his fear of being unable to finish the book his sister-in-law offered to write it if dictated. Out of his 50 odd books about 20 were written after he became blind. His last poem 'Rathriya' was written barely five hours before his death. Contribution towards the development of Sinhala short stories G.B. Senanayake is considered as the writer who paid special attention to the artistic side of short stories and developed Sinhala short stories from a skilled aspect. Senanayake improved Sinhala short stories as a pleasing and flexible medium. Especially language and structure were more polished in G.B. Senanayake's works. On the other hand, the characters and incidents are allowed to develop with an interrelationship with reason and result in his stories. Likewise G.B. allows incidents and facts causing the incidents and the mental status caused by the incident and its development to come out automatically. It can be seen that Senanayake's stories improved the composition and regulations of Sinhala short stories. G.B. Senanayake has been a person who has shown ability in drawing the language flexibly into fiction writing. He thought that written language was artificial. He didn't fancy high flown language used by intellectuals. Critics show that it was G.B. who highlighted the importance of poetic styles in short stories. It is said that Senanayake became more prone to artistic side of the work because he was influenced by foreign literature. Being influenced by French and Russian literature would have forced Senanayake to exceed the limits of Sinhala short stories. G.B. was most influenced by French short story styles, especially [Guy de Maupassant]. Maupassant tried to bring out the tragedy of the high class. Likewise Senanayake tried to speak about the middle class of the middle-class people living in towns. He brought it out in a more personalised manner rather than bringing it in a subject wise manner. Because of this while bringing out feelings he also brought out signs and descriptions of the environment. Looking at how Russian literature affected G.B. Senanayake's works it seems that Anton Chekhov's works have influenced him. Especially exploring the artistic beauty of his own short stories was a path he found from Russian literature.

The first Scavenger was Peter Mortimer, an Aquaman villain who debuted in Aquaman vol. 1 #37 (January 1968), and was created by Bob Haney and Nick Cardy. He is re-introduced in the New 52 series Aquaman by writer Geoff Johns and artist Paul Pelletier.Aquaman vol.7 #15 The second Scavenger first appeared in Superboy #2 (March 1994), and was created by Karl Kesel and Tom Grummett. Fictional character biography=Peter Mortimer= In his first appearance, the first Scavenger was looking for something called the Time Decelerator, a device left on Earth by an extraterrestrial race. When he finds it, it apparently de-ages him to nothing. In his next appearance, while battling Aquaman for the second time, he explains that the Time Decelerator simply sent him into a timeless, limbo-like dimension.Aquaman #59 The Scavenger then resurfaces in the other-dimensional world of Skartaris, where he gains mystical powers, becoming the Scavenger of Souls and battling Travis Morgan, known as the Warlord. He apparently loses these mystical powers and returns to his own world sometime later. In his next appearance, the Scavenger is shown to have reformed, also becoming a friend of Aquaman's.Aquaman (vol. 4) #13 (December 1992) However, a later encounter with Hawkman retconned his redemption, stating that Peter Mortimer was secretly part of a pedophile ring who videotaped himself beating young boys and girls. Moreover, he now calls himself Barracuda and explains that he was the avatar of the barracuda, just as Hawkman is the avatar of the hawk. After Barracuda attempts to kill both Aquaman and Hawkman, Hawkman kills him.Hawkman (vol. 3) #15 (December 1994) In The New 52, after the events of Throne of Atlantis, Mortimer begins scouring the ocean floor with the help of his minions for all Atlantean technology and weaponry, then sells them off to the highest bidder. He, along with villains such as the Weapons Master, the Key, the Scarecrow, Captain Cold, and the Cheetah were all attacked, captured, tortured, and interrogated by the villain David Graves who intended to acquire information on the members of the Justice League. Mortimer was among the villains recruited by the Crime Syndicate of America during the events of the Forever Evil story arc, and was later captured along with several other members of the Secret Society by the reformed Justice League in the aftermath of the Crime Syndicate's defeat. =Second Scavenger= The second Scavenger first appeared in Superboy #2. He is an old man, with a wide range of weaponry at his disposal. Little of the man's history has been revealed, except once during \\"Superboy and the Ravers\\" he mentioned he was one of the men who originally were the Argonauts and challenged the gods, which led to his dilemmas later in life. He believes he is being persecuted by an enemy from his past, and stockpiles weapons and gadgets to be ready when the enemy strikes. The identity of the nemesis has never been revealed and only made one appearance near the end of Superboy's series in which the enemy's identity was never revealed; Scavenger suffers severe paranoia, and believes anyone who tries to stop him is working for his nemesis. He later joins the Secret Society headed by Alexander Luthor. Scavenger and other villains, including Red Panzer, are sent to Gotham City, where they go on a murderous attack against law enforcement officers.Gotham Central #37 (2005) Scavenger somehow survives to the 30th century (at least in the post-Zero Hour version of future history), where he fights Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes.

The series is produced by both Bee Train and Synergy Japan and began airing in Kids Station on April 12, 2004 to November 1, 2004. Theme Panda-Z: The Robonimation includes characters that were modeled after the main cast of Mazinger Z. None of the characters are voiced, and the show's infrequent dialogue is instead presented through intertitles. Some episodes have no dialogue at all, relying on mime movement, sound effects, and the show's electric guitar-based blues/rock/fusion soundtrack for expression. Each episode is five minutes long, including both the opening and ending credits. The ending credits also include a profile of one character or set piece from the series. Story The series consists of short comedy sketches, involving the adventures of Pan-Taron, a super deformed robotic panda, pilot of the Panda-Z mecha, and his equally small cute robotic friends, as they fight the evil Skullpander, leader of the Warunimal forces. The story is confined to the small Robonimal Island (containing Robonimal City and P-Z Labs) and a tiny nearby volcanic island that is home to the Warunimal base. Buildings in Robonimal City are all topped with panda heads. Never taking itself seriously, the story is often just an excuse to put the characters in common everyday situations, but with a robotic twist, which allows for comical results. In several episodes the characters can be seen playing the card game Old Maid against one another. The deck they play with has characters from the show on them, including Skullpander as the Joker. In one episode they play Rock-Paper-Scissors...a game made more difficult by their mitten-like hands. Being robots, they can often be seen ingesting batteries for their food. Some other times, the struggle between the two groups is present, but either one of them, or sometimes even both, don't take the fighting seriously. List of Pan-Taron's Robonimal friends *Dr. Panji - Taron's grandfather and the director of the laboratory. He is a researcher at the mysterious \\"Super P-Z\\" and an authority on Robonimal engineering. He created the Panda-Z along with Taron's father (who left one day years ago and never returned). But outside of that, he is just a kind grandfather, who loves his grandson very much. *Rabina/Rabinna - A kindhearted girl that everyone adores. She dreams of becoming a great nurse someday. She has a cheerful, kind personality and also has a strong sense of responsibility. She's a pink robot rabbit with angel wings and a white nurse's outfit. *Denwan - He is something of a leader in Taron's group of friends. He is dependable, but sometimes, he gets ahead of himself and ends up failing. His dream is to become a great public Denwan someday. (Den means phone and WanWan is the sound a dog makes so he is basically a blue Phone dog.) He is, however, a pay phone...you have to pay him to make an outgoing call. Also, his dial only has seven digits. *Eteckee - He is a brilliant and talented scholar. Sometimes, he can be timid and a bit of a scaredy-cat, but he dreams of becoming a researcher at the Panda-Z Lab someday. His name seems to be a pun on \\"techie\\" and \\"monkey\\", and is a yellow robot monkey. *Hamu Ichiro, Hamu Jiro - They are the mechanical team at the lab. They are both incredible mechanics and Panda-Z's feats are often made possible thanks to these two. They pilot the Ham Gears, giant robots that let them repair Panda-Z at its own scale, as well as carry a damaged Panda-Z off the battlefield. There seems to be no relation between the noncombatant Ham Gears and Dr. Jangarly's Black Ham Gear. *Zoutank - A green robot that is a cross between an elephant and a tank, with a cannon for a trunk. It seems to be an independent character, rather than merely a vehicle. However, it's large enough for other Robonimals to ride in. The Bear Rescue Team The Bear Rescue are the rescue professionals at the Panda-Z lab: *Firebear - basically the fire fighter of the group. *Rescue Bear 01, Rescue Bear 02 - Nearly identical bear robots, with \\"01\\" or \\"02\\" on their ears. They're litter- bearers, among other tasks. *Medical Bear - A white bear with red rescue flasher ears and a doctor's speculum (mirror headband). Rabinna is his nurse. List of Warunimal enemies *Skullpander/Skull Panda - leader of the Warunimals, what's beneath his cloak is a source of mystery to his own generals. He's spooky and mysterious and rarely seems to do anything, generally staying in his cloud-wreathed island headquarters. *Rubyrabeauty/Rubyraby - rabbit-princess with adult proportions (as opposed to the child-body proportions of everyone else). Her minions are pink. Her giant robot occasionally demonstrates the ability to act on its own, and at one point seems to fall in love with Panda-Z. *Moogyuu/Mougyu - cow-like appearance. His minions are yellow. Probably Panda-Z's most frequent opponent, he's often cheated of victory because his remote control breaks, or he is injured when he gets dragged along behind it on the remote's cable. His giant robot Moujumbo uses a large hammer. *Doctor Jangary/Jangarly - robo-hamster with a mustache, his skull is a clear dome that shows his computer brain. When he smokes, the smoke fills his dome and he shorts out. His minions wear black. His \\"Black Ham Gear\\" giant robot is not completed until the end of the series, and he frequently threatens dire vengeance once it's ready. *Wolgaoh/Wolgar - robot wolf who's perhaps a little too domesticated, sometimes playing fetch when he should be fighting. Normally light gray, turns red under a full moon. His minions are light gray, and his giant wolf robot (that also seems to be named Wolgaoh) has a set of \\"bone nunchaku\\". *Kokekkou - A giant robotic rooster, apparently an unpiloted Warunimal asset. It can launch egg bombs, fly, and is assisted by smaller flying robot roosters. *Warunimal soldier - Identical masked minions, appearing in four color schemes, denoting which general they follow. They don't seem to much like their generals, and sometimes argue amongst each other which group has it worst. *Bokkuma - Box on legs with panda features. More pet than minion. Theme songs *\\"VOYAGER\\" By JAM Project Home Release The series is collected in 6 DVD volumes under Bandai's \\"Anime Legends\\" banner, each of which also has a bonus 3-D animated short and a short featuring a large rotocast Panda-Z toy.

Retrieved on 23 November 2011. which focuses on either finding obscure breakbeats or re-sampling much used drum-and-bass breakbeats from their original source and transforming them into constantly shifting drum patterns, noticeably different from traditional drum and bass. He also records a duo with producer Nucleus. He also has regularly collaborated with artist Seba. He also records under the pseudonym Alaska. From 1994 to 2020(new release under the name Alaska to come out at the end of 2020), Pandya went by the alias Brown in collaboration with Rhymeside (Scott Williams), DJ Trax (David Davies) and Dangerman, which is another alias from Davies. Under the artist name of DMR Pandya released tracks as Paradox & DMR on the label Certificate 18 in 1998. Pandya runs four record labels: Paradox Music, Esoteric, Outsider, and Arctic Music. He also ran the labels Mob Handed, Stronghold Records and Offset Recordings together with Davies from 1994 to 1997. Those labels are inactive, which means that there are no more records released on them. Paradox released his first full-length album Musician as Outsider in 2000 on Reinforced Records as single artist. Both the CD and LP releases have ten tracks on them, but the CD version had a bonus CD with live PA-footage from Paradox's 2000 tour. There was a special Japan version of the CD, released by Sony Japan, which featured changed patterns, different run times and the bonus-track \\"The Unspoken Divide\\". In 2002 the second Paradox album, again on Reinforced came out, called What You Don't Know. The LP version features ten tracks and the double CD release has 12 tracks on CD 1 and video footage from the 2002 live tour on CDVD (CD 2). In 2004, the album The Esoteric Funk by Nucleus & Paradox was again released on Reinforced Records. Nucleus' real name is Dave Sims. Sims and Pandya had released a CD album before in 1997 which is called Noise & Paradox Transmograpfication. At that time Simms went by the name \\"Noise\\". Paradox released the first CD Seba & Paradox Beats Me on his label Paradox Music in 2006 featuring tracks from Seba, Paradox and Seba & Paradox collaborations. In 2007, Paradox released the first CD on his label Outsider called Paradox Presents: The Age of Outsiders featuring selected tracks from all releases on Outsider. CD 1 was mixed by Nucleus and CD 2 was mixed by DJ Trax. July 2006 saw the 100th release of Paradox. On this occasion the 12\\" release was a special red vinyl featuring remixes of the Paradox-tracks \\"The Unspoken Divide\\" and \\"Give the Drummer Some\\". In collaboration with Bill Laswell and Herbie Hancock, Paradox is featured on the album Method of Defiance Inamorata on the label Ohm Resistance with two tracks. While the track \\"Panepha\\" has Paradox programmed the drums, Hancock plays the keyboard and Laswell the bass. The track \\"Humanoid\\" has Paradox, again drum programmer, Toshinori Kondo (is an avant-garde jazz and jazz fusion trumpeter) on the trumpet, Bernie Worrell (Parliament Funkadelic) on the keyboards and Laswell as usual on the bass.

PEER serves as a resource to potential government whistleblowers, allowing them to anonymously expose environmental wrongdoings and assisting them in redressing agency retaliation. Founded in 1996, PEER operates primarily by investigating claims from public employees about government environmental misconduct. Because whistleblowers often face direct retaliation from the offending agencies, PEER encourages employees to act through the organization to reveal government environmental misdeeds. Once a claim is made, PEER investigates it, often using Freedom of Information Act requests. The organization then can choose to take a number of actions, including press releases or lawsuits. PEER also serves to provide legal services to whistleblowers who find themselves the target of agency retaliation.Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. Accessed June 6, 2009.

Some of their work includes = EPA library closings = In 2006, the Environmental Protection Agency began to dismantle its network of technical libraries, an important resource for research, without Congressional approval. Upon learning of these closings, PEER brought them to the attention of Congress. Despite Congress' recent order to reopening of the libraries, the EPA continues to limit and remove library resources. =Arctic drilling debate= PEER has released e-mails and documents from current and former Interior scientists challenging the integrity of the environmental assessments of Arctic offshore oil development. These e-mails have been used to fuel lawsuits currently threatening to impede new lease sales. =Off-road recreation damage= Off‚Äìroad vehicle recreation, an activity growing in popularity, can devastate local wildlife growth and disrupt the environment. PEER and Rangers for Responsible Recreation are campaigning to draw attention to the growing threat posed by off-road vehicle misuse and to assist over matched state and federal land managers. = Genetically engineered crops = In 2011 PEER participated in a lawsuit against the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for entering into agreements which had allowed Genetically Engineered (GE) crops to be planted on 54 U.S. national wildlife refuges. Co-plaintiffs in the suit were the Center for Food Safety and Beyond Pesticides. The group also filed a lawsuit in 2012 against the White House under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) demanding release of an email the White House had received from Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), a lobbying firm which represents GE seed companies such as Monsanto. The Obama Administration had refused to release the email, claiming that doing so would reveal BIO's lobbying strategies. =Teresa Chambers= Former Chief of the United States Park Police, Teresa Chambers served for nearly 2 years before she was fired after revealing in an interview the potential dangers of their low staffing levels. PEER has provided Teresa legal defense and publicity for her appeal for reinstatement and for her wrongful firing lawsuit. = Suppression of Wolf Research = PEER has been involved in challenging the suppression of research by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and Washington State University concerning the ineffectiveness of lethal control in preventing future depredation of livestock. They have also been critical of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources' lax regulation of recreational hunting and its impact on the federally endangered Great Lakes gray wolf. =PEER also maintains many campaigns in the following categories= *Climate Change *Eco-Enforcement *Good Governance *Protecting Public Employees *Public Health *Public Lands *Scientific Integrity *Water and Wetlands *Whistleblowers *Wildlife Protection Faith-based parks PEER has worked to keep religious promotions out of public parks. =Grand Canyon National Park= The National Park Service in 2003 approved for sale in the Grand Canyon National Park bookstore Grand Canyon: A Different View: a book that presents the formation of the Grand Canyon as a result of Biblical events. PEER exposed the selling of this book as preferential treatment of a religion that toes the line of constitutional legality. On January 4, 2007 the National Park Service Chief of Public Affairs, David Barna released a response stating that the National Park Service neither uses the text in their teaching nor do they endorse its content. The release further states that the book is sold in the inspirational section of the bookstore which includes anthropological works on Native American culture. As PEER contests, the inspirational section was only created after PEER had exposed the book's sale as a natural history. The controversial book remains on sale. The National Park Service has continued to delay the issuing of a pamphlet \\"Geologic Interpretive Programs: Distinguishing Science from Religion\\" which is meant to instruct park officials on how to respond to questions like those concerning biblical interpretations of the Grand Canyon. =Mojave National Preserve= PEER board member, Frank Buono, along with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, filed a lawsuit to remove an white cross displayed in the Mojave National Preserve. The cross, which was originally erected in 1934 as a war memorial has since undergone many changes in appearance, including the loss of its plaque. It now stands as an white cross serving occasionally as the site for Easter sunrise services. Most recently, the order to remove the cross has been upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, despite four appeals by the U.S. Justice Department. The cross now awaits removal, unless there is a fifth appeal by the Justice Department that could potentially bring the case to the Supreme Court.

It may be the most affecting and profound of James's stories about writers. The novelist in the tale speculates that he has spent his whole life learning how to write, so a second life would make sense, \\"to apply the lesson.\\" Second lives aren't usually available, so the novelist says of himself and his fellow artists: \\"We work in the dark‚Äîwe do what we can‚Äîwe give what we have. Our doubt is our passion and our passion is our task. The rest is the madness of art.\\" Plot summary Dencombe, a novelist who has been seriously ill, is convalescing at the English seaside town of Bournemouth. He is sitting near the water and reading his latest book entitled, of course, The Middle Years. A young physician named Dr. Hugh comes over to Dencombe and begins to talk about his admiration for the novel, though he doesn't realize that he's speaking to the book's author. The weakened Dencombe suddenly loses consciousness. When he revives, he finds that Dr. Hugh has recognized him, and that the physician is also attending a wealthy woman referred to only as the Countess. Over the next few days Dr. Hugh pays more attention to Dencombe than to the Countess, and he is warned about this by the wealthy woman's companion, Miss Vernham. A few days later Dencombe relapses. Dr. Hugh tells Dencombe that the Countess has died and left him nothing in her will. Close to death Dencombe whispers to Dr. Hugh the eloquent words quoted above. The tale's final sentence tells how Dencombe's first and only chance at life and art has ended. Major themes Many of James's stories about writers show some evidence, usually smothered in ironic humor, of resentment that his own fiction didn't reach a much larger audience. \\"The Middle Years\\" is free from such rather querulous regrets. Instead, the tale shows the artist's quest as something far more important than a search for popularity and material rewards. The plot is so simple that it almost seems an afterthought. Dr. Hugh's devotion is genuine and touching, but it serves mainly to inspire Dencombe to his sad, wise reflections on a lifetime of artistic effort. Dencombe never will enjoy \\"an extension\\" of his life, \\"another go\\" at his art. But he comes to realize that his life's work is already enough for him to \\"possess his kingdom\\" and to die with a genuine sense of having achieved all he could. Critical evaluation Many critics have noted how \\"The Middle Years\\" differs from James's other tales of writers and their troubles. As Frank Kermode said: \\"'The Middle Years' stands somewhat apart from the other stories of the literary life; the tone is darker, the ironies less vivid, the relationship between old and young more intimate and more understanding.\\" This gentler approach, free from bitterness about James's own problems as an artist, has attracted sometimes hyperbolic praise. Edward Wagenknecht, for instance, called it \\"by all means the most beautiful\\" of James' stories about writers, and said the tale made him want to cry rather than lecture. In his own New York Edition preface to the story, James expressed pride at compressing his material into the short length magazine editors often demanded. The mature and unobtrusive technique of the tale masks the complexity of its treatment of the artist, doomed and triumphant, tragic and victorious. Influence Philip Roth in his 1979 work The Ghost Writer references and quotes from \\"The Middle Years\\" extensively with long sections being quoted verbatim. A part of the theme of The Ghost Writer can be seen as a homage to \\"The Middle Years\\" with Nathan Zuckerman and E.I Lonoff representing Dr. Hugh and Dencombe respectively.

[(Aviation Safety Network)] Operations According to the authors of The Power of Unreasonable People Air Serv has provided more than 150,000 flights enabling hundreds of humanitarian relief organizations access to parts of the world under stress. Of these flights Air Serv has delivered more than 1,600 metric tons of supplies and served more than 230,000 passengers and patients. The environment that Air Serv operates in is often war torn countries, ravaged by fighting and unrest between rebel forces and governments. One pilot working with Air Serv recounted how she was held at gunpoint by a local needing transportation until the police aided her in resolving the issue. Another pilot that formerly flew with the Air Force remarked how he was shot at more than when he flew with the military. Sometimes fighting stops only for the planes to come in and deliver supplies and then the fighting will resume. On one flight the pilot of Air Serv was given 30 min by the rebel forces fighting in that region to land, refuel and evacuate fellow humanitarians and be back up in the air. Other factors that Air Serv pilots must deal with is inadequate runways and severe weather conditions. Landing in mud so deep that the plane becomes stuck requiring locals to dig out with machetes and rain that is so severe that it removes paint from the aircraft are just a few of the weather related challenges Air Serv has faced. Air fields that these pilots use are sometimes just desert areas marked by rocks showing where the pilots must land.

This is a view held by many value theorists, but most famously by some classical utilitarians. Nozick attacks the thesis by means of a thought experiment. If he can show that there is something other than pleasure that has value and thereby increases our well-being, then hedonism is defeated. The thought experiment Nozick asks us to imagine a machine that could give us whatever desirable or pleasurable experiences we could want. Psychologists have figured out a way to stimulate a person's brain to induce pleasurable experiences that the subject could not distinguish from those he would have apart from the machine. He then asks, if given the choice, would we prefer the machine to real life? Nozick also believes that if pleasure were the only intrinsic value, people would have an overriding reason to be hooked up to an \\"experience machine,\\" which would produce favorable sensations. =Initial concerns= Who would run the machines if everyone plugs in? Nozick asks us to ignore this concern, since it does not adversely affect the thought experiment. One could simply stipulate that the machines have been so well designed as to be fail-proof. The experiment is also open to multiple interpretations. For instance, Nozick claims that you could either map out the rest of your life in the machine before plugging in, or you could unplug periodically to choose your programming for the next cycle. While interesting, these variations do not directly affect the argument either. =The argument= The argument is along these lines: *P1: If experiencing as much pleasure as we can is all that matters to us, then if we will experience more pleasure by doing x than by doing y, we have no reason to do y rather than x. *P2: We will experience more pleasure if we plug into the experience machine than if we do not plug into the experience machine. *C1: If all that matters to us is that we experience as much pleasure as we can then we have no reason not to plug into the experience machine. (P1&P2;) *P3: We have reason not to plug into the experience machine. *C2: Experiencing as much pleasure as we can is not all that matters to us. (C1&P3;, by MT) =Reasons not to plug in= Nozick provides us with three reasons not to plug into the machine. # We want to do certain things, and not just have the experience of doing them. #* \\"It is only because we first want to do the actions that we want the experiences of doing them.\\" (Nozick, 43) # We want to be a certain sort of person. #* \\"Someone floating in a tank is an indeterminate blob.\\" (Nozick, 43) # Plugging into an experience machine limits us to a man-made reality (it limits us to what we can make). #* \\"There is no actual contact with any deeper reality, though the experience of it can be simulated.\\" (Nozick, 43) = Additionally = These are not quoted by Nozick himself, but rather other philosophers who have come up with or shared additional reasons. * Status Quo Bias, humans tend to dislike change, especially when considering the thought of having to be prodded with wires. (Bramble, 4) * We would never see your real family and friends again, although unbeknownst to us. (Kawall, 383) * The concept of free will becomes murky. (Bramble, 142) * Plugging in is a form of suicide. (Bramble, 141) = Argument against hedonism = Hedonism states that the things in life worth pursuing are the highest good, or the things that will make you happiest both long term and short term. Happiness is the highest value in human life. The Experience Machine is hedonistic, and yet people still refuse to be plugged in for the reasons listed above. Therefore, a conclusion is made that being personally happy is not the greatest value everyone carries. (Lin) =Counterarguments= Psychologist and philosopher Joshua Greene says that our intuitions about the experience machine may be affected by status quo bias, and suggests reformulating the thought experiment in a form which counters this. According to his version: > you wake up in a plain white room. You are seated in a reclining chair with > a steel contraption on your head. A woman in a white coat is standing over > you. 'The year is 2659,' she explains, 'The life with which you are familiar > is an experience machine program selected by you some forty years ago. We at > IEM interrupt our client's programs at ten-year intervals to ensure client > satisfaction. Our records indicate that at your three previous interruptions > you deemed your program satisfactory and chose to continue. As before, if > you choose to continue with your program you will return to your life as you > know it with no recollection of this interruption. Your friends, loved ones, > and projects will all be there. Of course, you may choose to terminate your > program at this point if you are unsatisfied for any reason. Do you intend > to continue with your program? If we feel differently about this version of the story compared to the form that Nozick offers, according to Greene this is due to status quo bias. In fiction Before it became a philosophical thought experiment in the mid seventies, the pleasurable but simulated experience versus reality dilemma had been a staple of science fiction; for example in the short story \\"The Chamber of Life\\" by Green Peyton Wertenbaker (fr) , published in the magazine Amazing Stories in October 1929. The novel Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace involves a similar formulation of the experience machine. The novel revolves around a film titled Infinite Jest that is lethally pleasurable: the film is so entertaining that, once watched, the viewer will desire nothing else but to watch the film over and over. Examples of movies centering on machines capable of replaying experiences previously recorded include the 1983 film Brainstorm and the 1995 film Strange Days. The choice between standard human life and transforming into creatures that can experience a much more intense pleasure life is also one of the main twists of the classic novel City, by Clifford Simak. In that story, as opposed to Nozick's argument, most people opt for the pleasure life, mostly because they can fully appreciate what they can gain in the process thanks to a sophisticated language method, suggesting that the terms of the choice have to be well chosen and fully understood for the experience to be significant. It also is a running theme of the 1999 film The Matrix. Agent Smith's account of the early history of the Matrix includes the idea that humans reject a virtual reality that offers them paradise; however, later his informant Cypher is willing to betray his colleagues because he would prefer to be reinserted into an (arguably less perfect) Matrix as a wealthy and successful man than continue to live in the harsh realities outside the simulation. While this later version of the Matrix is not a paradise-like reality in the literal sense, it may be argued that it is a lot like a pleasure-inducing experience machine, since Cypher is given the opportunity to have a prominent position of power and wealth in this new simulation. As he says while dining at a simulated restaurant: > \\"You know, I know this steak doesn't exist. I know that when I put it in my > mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy, and delicious. After > nine years, you know what I realize?

Its main role at the start of the strike was to mobilise a large vigilante street presence in order to intimidate those workers uncertain about joining the strike, a tactic Tyrie described as essential in order that the strike would succeed.Anderson, 14 May Days, p. 31 According to journalist Don Anderson, its role became much less important once the strike had been going for a few days as by that stage the majority of the Protestant workforce were behind the initiative voluntarily.Anderson, 14 May Days, pp. 33‚Äì34 The group was replaced by the Ulster Loyalist Central Co-ordinating Committee (ULCCC) after the 1974 strike.

The play‚Äî\\"probably the most sophisticated treatment of domestic tragedy in the whole of Elizabethan-Jacobean drama\\"Logan and Smith, p. 15.‚Äîis based on events that supposedly took place in the parish of Edmonton, then outside London, earlier that year. The play depicts Elizabeth Sawyer, an old woman shunned by her neighbours, who gets revenge by selling her soul to the Devil, who appears to her in the shape of a black dog called Tom. In addition, there are two subplots. One depicts a bigamist who murders his second wife at the devil's prompting, and the other depicts a clownish yokel who befriends the devil-dog. Date and authorship Written and first acted in 1621, the play was not published until 1658. It was entered into the Stationers' Register on 21 May that year; the edition that followed was issued by the bookseller Edward Blackmore. The title page of the first edition attributes the play to \\"divers well-esteemed Poets; William Rowley, Thomas Dekker, John Ford, &c.;\\"Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 298. Scholars have generally ignored the \\"et cetera\\" and assigned the play to the three named playwrights‚Äîthough a few have noted that the three writers were working with John Webster at the time, on Keep the Widow Waking, and have suggested that the \\"&c.;\\" might stand for Webster.Logan and Smith, p. 29. Sources The play was inspired by the real-life story of Elizabeth Sawyer, who had been executed for witchcraft on 19 April 1621, and draws heavily on a pamphlet by Henry Goodcole, The wonderful discovery of Elizabeth Sawyer, Witch (1621). While Goodcole's witch is simply a bad woman, the Sawyer of the play is treated more sympathetically. Performance history The play was first acted by Prince Charles's Men at the Cockpit Theatre in 1621 (there is a record of a performance at Court on 29 December of that year). In the modern age it has been performed twice by the Royal Shakespeare Company, first in a touring production which ran from 1981-1982, and secondly in 2014, in a production starring Eileen Atkins in the lead role. In June 2019, the play was revived and reworked by Hoof and Horn Productions at the BT Theatre in Oxford, to rave reviews. In this retelling, Elizabeth Sawyer's storyline took centre stage: the Frank plot was removed and replaced by bits of new writing and theatrical portions of Henry Goodcole's pamphlet. Primary characters *Sir Arthur Clarington. A wealthy knight and the employer of Frank Thorney and Winifred. He has a secret affair with Winifred, and when she gets pregnant, he pushes Frank to marry her in order to cover his own indiscretion. * Old Thorney. Frank Thorney's father. He is a gentleman who has mortgaged all of his lands. He pushes his son to marry Susan Carter in order to escape his financial difficulties. * Old Carter. The father of Susan Carter and Katherine Carter. He is a wealthy farmer who uses his daughters‚Äô marriages as means to improve his social status. * Old Banks. The father of Cuddy Banks. He beats Mother Sawyer at the beginning of the play for gathering sticks on his land. * Warbeck. Suitor to Susan Carter. A stuffy scholar. He becomes bitter when Susan chooses Frank Thorney over him. * Somerton. Suitor to Katherine Carter. * Frank Thorney. Old Thorney's son. He marries Winifred because he thinks she is pregnant with his child, enters into a second bigamous marriage with Susan, murders Susan as he attempts to escape with the dowry money, and is eventually executed for his crimes. * Young Cuddy Banks. Old Banks‚Äô son (the clown). A country yokel and Morris-dancer. He makes friends with the Devil-Dog, but due to his innocence and ignorance, he proves incorruptible. * Old Ratcliffe. The husband of Anne Ratcliffe, a woman who is driven insane by the Devil-Dog at Mother Sawyer's behest. * Justice. The local Justice of the Peace. He passes judgment on Frank Thorney and Mother Sawyer at the end of the play. * Dog. A devil or spirit who has assumed the form of a black dog. Sometimes called ‚ÄòTom‚Äô. He performs mischievous acts for Mother Sawyer after she promises her soul to him. He can only be seen by Mother Sawyer and Cuddy Banks. * Mother Sawyer (Elizabeth Sawyer). The ‚Äòwitch‚Äô of Edmonton. At the beginning of the play, she is merely a poor old decrepit woman, but she makes a deal with a devil to get revenge on her neighbors when they treat her poorly and accuse her of using witchcraft to spoil their crops and kill their livestock. * Anne Ratcliffe. Old Ratcliffe's wife. At Mother Sawyer's bequest, the Devil-Dog drives her insane and causes her to beat her own brains out. * Susan Carter. Old Carter's eldest daughter. She chooses to marry Frank Thorney rather than Warbeck. Frank murders her when she tries to follow him as he escapes with the dowry money. * Katherine Carter. Old Carter's younger daughter. She is wooed by and agrees to marry Somerton. While nursing Frank back to health, she finds the bloody knife he used to murder her sister Susan, thereby revealing Frank's guilt. * Winifred. Sir Arthur Clarington's maid and Frank Thorney's first wife. Sir Arthur gets her pregnant and offers Frank money to marry her. When Frank flees after his second marriage, she travels with him disguised as his boy-servant. Plot Elizabeth Sawyer is a poor, lonely, and unfairly ostracized old woman, who turns to witchcraft after having been unjustly accused of it, having nothing left to lose. A talking devil-dog Tom (performed by a human actor) appears, becoming her familiar and only friend. With Tom's help, Sawyer causes one of her neighbours to go mad and kill herself, but otherwise she does not achieve very much, since many of those around her are only too willing to sell their souls to the devil all by themselves. The play is divided fairly rigidly into separate plots, which only occasionally intersect or overlap. Alongside the main story of Elizabeth Sawyer, the other major plotline is a domestic tragedy centering on the farmer's son Frank Thorney. Frank is secretly married to the poor but virtuous Winnifride, whom he loves and believes is pregnant with his child, but his father insists that he marry Susan, elder daughter of the wealthy farmer Old Carter. Frank weakly gives in to a bigamous marriage but then tries to flee the county with Winnifride disguised as his page. When the doting Susan follows him, he stabs her. At this point, the witch's dog Tom is present on stage and it is left ambiguous whether Frank remains a fully responsible moral agent in the act. Frank inflicts superficial wounds on himself, so that he can pretend to have been attacked, and attempts to frame Warbeck, Susan's former suitor, and Somerton, suitor of Susan's younger sister Katherine. While the kindly Katherine is nursing her supposedly incapacitated brother-in-law, however, she finds a bloodstained knife in his pocket and immediately guesses the truth, which she reveals to her father. The devil-dog is on stage again at this point, and \\"shrugs for joy,\\" according to the stage direction, which suggests that he has brought about Frank's downfall. Frank is executed for his crime at the same time as Mother Sawyer, but he, in marked contrast to her, is forgiven by all and the pregnant Winnifride is taken into the family of Old Carter. The play thus ends on a relatively happy note‚ÄîOld Carter enjoins all those assembled at the execution, \\"So, let's every man home to Edmonton with heavy hearts, yet as merry as we can, though not as we would.\\" The note of optimism is also heard in the play's other main plot, centering on the Morris dancing yokel Cuddy Banks, whose invincible innocence allows him to emerge unscathed from his own encounters with the dog Tom; he eventually banishes the dog from the stage with the words \\"Out, and avaunt!\\" Despite the optimism of the play's ending it remains clear that the execution of Mother Sawyer has done little or nothing to purge the play's world of an evil to which its inhabitants are only too ready to turn spontaneously. Firstly, the devil-dog has not been destroyed, and indeed resolves to go to London and corrupt souls there. Secondly, the village's voice of authority, the lord of the manor Sir Arthur Clarington, is represented as untrustworthy, and Mother Sawyer utters a lengthy tirade indicting his lechery (he has previously had an affair with Winnifride, which she now repents) and general corruption, a charge which the play as a whole supports. The Witch of Edmonton may be very ready to capitalize on the sensational story of a witch, but it does not permit an easy and comfortable demonization of her; it presents her as a product of society rather than an anomaly in it.

Daffy's Elixir (also sometimes known as Daffey's Elixir or Daffye's Elixir) is a name that has been used by several patent medicines over the years. It was originally designed for diseases of the stomach, but was later marketed as a universal cure. It remained a popular remedy in Britain and later the United States of America throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  Origins  Daffy's Elixir was one of the most popular and frequently advertised patent medicines in Britain during the 18th century. It is reputed to have been invented by clergyman Thomas Daffy, rector of Redmile, Leicestershire, in 1647. He named it elixir salutis (lit. elixir of health) and promoted it as a generic cure-all. A home recipe for the True Daffy's Elixir, from William Augustus Henderson Modern domestic cookery and useful receipt book, New York, 1829.  Ingredients  An early recipe for \\"True Daffy\\" from 1700 lists the following ingredients: aniseed, brandy, cochineal, elecampane, fennel seed, jalap, manna, parsley seed, raisin, rhubarb, saffron, senna and spanish liquorice. Chemical analysis has shown this to be a laxative made mostly from alcohol. Other recipes include Guiuacum wood chips, caraway, Salt of Tartar, and scammony.  Uses  According to an early nineteenth century advertisement it was used for the following ailments: The Stone in Babies and Children; Convulsion fits; Consumption and Bad Digestives; Agues; Piles; Surfeits; Fits of the Mother and Vapours from the Spleen; Green Sickness; Children's Distempers, whether the Worms, Rickets, Stones, Convulsions, Gripes, King's Evil, Joint Evil or any other disorder proceeding from Wind or Crudities; Gout and Rheumatism; Stone or Gravel in the Kidnies; Cholic and Griping of the Bowels; the Phthisic (both as cure and preventative provided always that the patient be moderate in drinking, have a care to prevent taking cold and keep a good diet; Dropsy and Scurvy. The frequent use of the medicine to treat Colic, gripes or fret in horses was deplored in early veterinary manuals.  Subsequent history  After Daffy's death in 1680 the recipe was left to his daughter Catherine, and his kinsmen Anthony and Daniel who were apothecaries in Nottingham. Anthony Daffy moved to London in the 1690s and began to exploit the product issuing pamphlets such as Directions for taking elixir salutis or, the famous purging cordial, known by the name of Daffy's elixir salutis [London], [1690?]. His widow Elleanor Daffy continued from about 1693 and (their daughter?) Katharine from about 1707. During the early 18th century the product was advertised widely in the emerging national and local newspapers. The success attracted several counterfeit copies, using inferior alcohol rather than brandy. The medicine was later produced by William and Cluer Dicey & Co. of Bow Church yard c.1775 who claimed the sole rights of manufacture of the True Daffy's Elixir, although the recipe was not subject to any patent. Proprietorship was also then claimed by Peter Swinton of Salisbury Court and his son Anthony Daffy Swinton who may have been descended from the inventor.Fleming, (1953), p.238. Dicey and Co. and their successors marketed it in the United States of America. It then passed to Dicey and Sutton, and later to Messrs W. Sutton & Co. of Enfield Middlesex who continuing to market it throughout the nineteenth century. The use of Daffy's elixir is referred to in Anthony Trollope's novel Barchester Towers, 1857. Daffy's elixir is also mentioned on several occasions in Thomas Pynchon's novel Mason & Dixon, particularly by Jeremiah Dixon, who attempts to procure large quantities before beginning his surveying trip with Charles Mason. Dixon is warned by Benjamin Franklin, however, that imported Daffy's Elixir is extremely expensive, and he would be better off ordering a customized version from the apothecary. During the same visit, Dixon also orders laudanum, a well-known constipating agent. Daffy's elixir is also mentioned in the Charles Dickens book, Oliver Twist, Ch. II, where it is referred to as Daffy, in the sentence: 'Why, it's what I'm obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put into the blessed infants' Daffy, when they ain't well, Mr. Bumble,(the Parish Beadle)' replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a bottle and glass. 'It's gin. I'll not deceive you, Mr. B. It's gin.' Daffy‚Äôs Elixir is also mentioned in the William Makepeace Thackeray book, Vanity Fair, Chapter XXXVIII A Family In a Small Way, where it is referenced in the sentence ‚Äò..and there found Mrs. Sedley in the act of surreptitiously administering Daffy‚Äôs Elixir to the infant.‚Äô  Early advertisements  . . .

It was designed just two years after the J-3 Cub, and differed by having a wider fuselage with the pilot sitting in the front seat and two passengers sitting in the rear seat. Equipped with a 75-hp Continental engine the plane's cruising speed was 75 mph. Though officially a three- seater, it would be more accurately described as a \\"two-and-a-half-seater\\", as two adults would find themselves quite cramped in the wider rear seat. The Cruiser sold for $1,798 when it was first designed. Production of the three models of the J-5 (-A, -B, -C), fall into two categories that differ considerably. The obvious difference can be seen in the landing gear. Early versions, of which 783 were built between 1940 and early 1942, have external bungees. Those built from 1944 to 1946 included design changes developed for the United States Navy HE-1 flying ambulance, and these models have internal bungees. In August 2018, 327 J-5s remained on the Federal Aviation Administration registry.. History Ex US Navy Piper AE-1 showing the hinged rear decking for access for ambulance work Throughout World War II, Piper modified the basic structure of the J-5A. The J-5B had a 75 h.p.

Early years Barrett was born in Saint Catherine Parish, British Jamaica; her parents brought her to Croydon, England in 1963. In the late 1960s she moved to Germany, where she joined a band and toured with Karel Gott and Rex Gildo. In 1971 she signed to Metronome Records and made her first record, \\"Could Be Love\\", written by Drafi Deutscher. At the same time she kept touring with such songs as \\"Son of a Preacher Man\\", \\"Oh Happy Day\\" and \\"Big Spender\\". Boney M. era In 1975 she joined Boney M., a group of models and dancers, to make discoth√®que and television performances of \\"Baby Do You Wanna Bump\\", a song recorded by record producer Frank Farian. The single was sold in the Benelux countries. When singer Claudja Barry left in early 1976, Barrett suggested a fellow Jamaican, Liz Mitchell, as replacement. Mitchell was a singer, and Farian engaged her and Barrett to make a follow-up recording, \\"Daddy Cool\\". They recorded Boney M.'s first album, Take the Heat Off Me, in 1976. After an appearance on the German television programme Musikladen in September, the group was in the charts all over Europe, and a series of hit singles and albums followed over the next decade. Boney M. counted four official members, but only Barrett and Mitchell were in the recording studio when Boney M.'s records were recorded. Frank Farian (and, from 1982‚Äì85, Reggie Tsiboe) provided male vocals that Bobby Farrell mimed to on stage. While Mitchell was regarded as the lead singer, owing to her larger number of songs on which she performed lead vocals, Barrett contributed harmony on many the group's well- known songs and shared the lead with Mitchell on hits such as \\"Daddy Cool\\", \\"Ma Baker\\", \\"Rasputin\\" and \\"Gotta Go Home\\". She also led on a couple of tracks on each of the group's studio albums up to Christmas Album (1981), including the title of the first album Take the Heat off Me and \\"Lovin' or Leavin'\\". These were released as a Barrett solo single in 1977. She sang lead vocal on \\"Belfast\\", a song she had performed live in her solo years, which became the second single from the second album Love for Sale; it was a German no. 1 and a European Top 10 hit. On that album she also performed \\"Silent Lover\\" On Nightflight to Venus, Barrett sang \\"Nightflight To Venus\\" and a cover of \\"King of the Road\\" as well as the original \\"Never Change Lovers in the Middle of the Night\\" which became a standard during the group's performances. She sang the a capella intros of Boney M.'s 1978 Christmas hit, \\"Mary's Boy Child/Oh My Lord\\", and \\"Ribbons of Blue\\", was lead singer of \\"No Time to Lose\\" on the group's 1979 album Oceans of Fantasy and had a solo on the opening track \\"Let It All Be Music\\" After an unsuccessful solo single \\"You\\" in the late 1980s, written by Kelvin James, she abandoned her solo project. Farian took one of the songs written by James for her, \\"Breakaway\\", and used it on Boney M.'s next album Boonoonoonoos‚Äîwith his own vocals on verses. Barrett, however, sang lead on the single \\"We Kill the World (Don't Kill the World)\\" in 1981. Although only a modest hit in the UK (#39), it topped the charts in Spain and South Africa. The group became less popular from 1982 onwards, when Bobby Farrell was replaced by Reggie Tsiboe. In 1983, Barrett was introduced to Eddy Grant who produced demos with her for CBS. Farian reminded her she was still contractually committed to Boney M. On their seventh album Ten Thousand Lightyears she is only occasionally heard on backing vocals. On their final album Eye Dance, she can barely be heard, and on the group's reunion remix album, Greatest Hits of All Times - Remix '88, her vocals were toned down on most tracks. After Liz Mitchell's departure during the 1989 tour, Madeleine Davis joined the group. When Farian announced he would not be making any new recordings, the group went to France to record \\"Everybody Wants to Dance Like Josephine Baker\\" with producer Barry Blue. She did all lead and backing vocals on the A-side, but Farian withdrew the single, angry that the group used the name Boney M. After a court case in 1990, the group members went their separate ways. Barrett was never involved in any of the Boney M. projects and recordings throughout the following decades. Life after Boney M. \\"Life after Boney M. ‚Äì my dear, I've been through hell and back\\", Barrett said in a radio interview in November 2001. After the group split in 1990, Barrett was recording rock tracks in Munich when she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She had a recurrence of her disease and was unable to work. By 1997, she began working with producer Scott Christina on dance tracks. The resulting album, Survival, appeared in November 1999. Two new tracks, a solo of Boney M.'s No. 1 hit \\"Rivers of Babylon\\" and a new track called \\"Seasons\\" were played on a very small Dutch radio show, but neither track was released. In 2003, a benefit EP No War! Peace and Love was released as a protest against the US military intervention in Iraq, and generated $295 for the War Child charity. Present day Barrett made her second album, Come into My Life, in 2005. It included a cover of \\"Hey Joe\\", a new version of \\"Belfast\\", as well as original recordings written by her and her husband Marcus. In addition, a cover of Fleetwood Mac's instrumental \\"Albatross\\", for which Barrett had been allowed to add her own lyrics by its composer Peter Green, and the song \\"Rip It Up\\" were also part of the track listing. She also toured with her own version of Boney M. She attended with Liz Mitchell and Frank Farian at the London and Berlin premi√®res of the Daddy Cool musical. In October 2007, she turned down a song for the album Disco 2008, a project by UK music producer Ian Levine. In October, she and her Boney M. were invited by President Mikhail Saakashvili to perform in South Ossetia. In 2009, she started Xoah Records. The first release on the label was a remix of her Survival track \\"Seeing Is Believing\\", released on 6 March 2009, followed by \\"I Don't Know Why\\". While her third solo album Strange Rumours had been announced to follow, the album was put on hold when she was hit by another bout of cancer. Barrett is currently living in Berlin. June 2018 saw Barretts biography \\"Forward - My life with and without Boney M.\\" being published.

Written by Eric Isaacson, it was first made available as shareware in June 1986. The assembler is contained in one 32K executable and can directly produce a COM file or an object file for use with a standard linker. It comes with a debugger, D86. While supporting expected x86 syntax, A86 allows slightly simpler shorthand in some cases, and does not require directives, such as \`ASSUME\` and \`PROC\`, which Microsoft Macro Assembler and other contemporaries rely on. Speed of assembly is a primary selling point. Isaacson claimed that A86 could assemble 100,000 lines of source per second on a Pentium II or better. A86 and D86 target 16-bit x86 platforms. Isaacson added 32-bit support in the mid 1990s in the form of A386 and D386. These were not distributed as shareware, but were provided to users who registered A86. The A86 family of products were never ported to Microsoft Windows, though it is possible to use the object files created by A386 with a Windows linker. The assembler does not support 64-bit code. A86-specific features Any label consisting of one letter followed by one or more digits is local and can be redefined as needed, with each definition replacing the prior. The manual recommends using through for normal code and through in macros. Branches to local labels are assumed to be backward, but a forward branch can be specified by prefixing the label reference with the greater than symbol (e.g.,). Numbers starting with a zero are hexadecimal, such as , instead of using a custom prefix. A trailing \\"K\\" indicates kibibytes. is the same as 16*1024 or 16384. Multiple registers can be pushed or popped on the same source line. generates one instruction for each of the three operands. There's shorthand for conditionally executing a single instruction. outputs two instructions: a conditional branch followed by the move. If is specified as the label for a conditional branch, it automatically targets a return instruction within the 8-bit branch range (e.g., ). Macros use a different syntax than contemporaneous assemblers. Code fingerprint The assembler automatically embeds a \\"fingerprint\\" into the generated code through a particular choice of functionally equivalent instruction encodings. This is mentioned in the legal terms section of the manual. The fingerprint makes it possible to tell if code was assembled with A86 and also to distinguish between registered and unregistered versions of the assembler. This analysis requires access to the source code.

It is one of the important governorates in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and is located in the southeast of the capital Riyadh, within an area of 19,790 km2 ~ 4,890,215.5 acres, and a population of 376,325 people, according to the statistics of the General Authority for Statistics for the year 2010. The city of Al Saih () is the capital of modern Al-Kharj and its administrative and economic center. Etymology It has also been said that Alkharj means what comes out of the earth because it is an agricultural region since the earliest times, and the name is older than those poets like the poet of King Al-Himyari (), Asaad Abi Karb Al-Awsat (), who mentioned the name of the Alkharj in their poems. The Ministry of Transport recently started making some corrective changes to the indicative panels on the roads leading to the city of Al Saih, within the administrative borders of Alkharj governorate and include the entrances to the city of Al Saih, the Riyadh highway, the old Riyadh road, the Haradh road, and the Al Saih-Dalam road, in implementation of the directives issued by the Amir of Riyadh in this regard that emphasizes the necessity of committing to launching the name (the City of Al Saih) in line with the correct name of this city that was launched by the unifier of this country, King Abdulaziz (), in the year 1356 Hijri. History Alkharj, with its historical monuments, is an important destination for researchers and those interested in the history of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and of the founder King Abdulaziz. Alkharj has some of the factors that are considered essential for tourism in the Kingdom and need to be considered and sought to achieve them archeology tourism, as there is a feast of archaeological monuments, perhaps the most important of which is the King Abdulaziz Palace. The historical site located in Al-Aziziyah () district in the heart of Al-Saih city. It was built in 1359 Hijri in the center of Al-Saih city. Among the historical palaces abound in Alkharj is \\"Abu Jafan Palace\\" () located east of the city of Al-Saih, and it was built during the reign of King Abdulaziz in the year 1366 Hijri and the purpose of its construction was to be a place at where those coming from the eastern region and pilgrims to the Great Mosque of Mecca which is still open to visitors. The city of Dalam (), which has a historical value to Alkharj governorate, abounds with many archaeological monuments and witnessed many historical battles represented in a fierce battle between King Abdulalaziz and Ibn Rashid (). The town of Yamama (), located in the north of the city of Al-Saih, is one of the oldest towns in the Arabian Peninsula (). In the northeastern corner of the town, there locates one of the oldest settlements that is called (Al-Banna) (), which is part of the old settlement that was found in this place before Islam. A variety of pottery was found on surrounding area of the town which indicates a time settlement that extends from the middle of the third millennium BC. Also, there has been found three pieces of ancient coin on the site, as well as accessories made of silver and bronze. Geography There are many valleys that flow into Alkharj. The most important of which are the Hanifa Valley (), the Haniyeh () Valley and the Al-Sahba Valley (). Also, Alkharj is known for the presence of [al-ee-u-oon] () which means literally ‚Äúeyes‚Äù, which are cavities inside the earth. these cavities in Al-Kharj, during summer period, are popular with visitors who come to see them from inside and outside the Kingdom, especially citizens of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The ‚Äúeyes‚Äù of Al-Kharj are distinguished for a long time by their cold water during the summer and warm during the winter, as these massive wells were flooding with water and running in large quantities like a river in the desert, especially in the valleys that penetrate the city of Al- Saih and which have acquired this name for the flow of water in it All year round. Al-Kharj is known that it is a water land where it gained its name since ancient times from the content of its geographical nature, which was characterized by the abundance of its agricultural production, the fertility of its lands and the sweetness of its water, as it has many natural springs that used to supply farms and agricultural projects with water through a group of channels and streams of water. Ain of al-Dila (), a spring, located in the southwest of the city of Al-Saih, is one of the largest ‚Äúeyes‚Äù in the Kingdom, in addition to the presence of many wells and springs with mineral sulfur water, which had an important place since ancient times, the most famous of which are Ain Samha (), Ain Umm Kheisa (), Ain Al-Dila ()and Ain Farzan (). These wells have remained the main source of water supplies for all uses in the Alkharj Oasis, and its quantities and levels have started to gradually decrease over the past two decades as a result of increasing the withdrawal and consumption of water from the feeding layer after the expansion of digging artesian wells by farmers, especially major agricultural and animal projects, which in return led to a stoppage of flow Natural in all eyes and the gradual depletion of the deeper eyes, the depth ranges between 5 to 16 meters, then the deepest. =Climate= The climate of Alkharj is continental, really hot through the summer and dry cold through the winter plus a little chance of rain. The weather cools down at night in mid-September until the cold becomes more intense in December and January, and the average maximum temperature in winter is 18 ¬∞C and the lowest 5 ¬∞C, while summer is the average maximum temperature is 48 ¬∞C and the lowest of 31 ¬∞C. Economy Al-Saih is one of the main and active cities in the present and future of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which is the modern capital of Alkharj and its administrative and economic center with a population of more than 376 thousand people. It is also worth noting what this city is known for in terms of its characteristics and what it possesses of advantages and constituents as it is one of the rich regions with all the economic rectifiers that attract investment and settlement. Not only that but also from natural resources, geographical location and population density, which is undoubtedly factors that give this city a successful environment for investment, if you take advantage of optimal exploitation to create a strong, effective and solid economic entity that will be a tributary of diversification of income sources and support for the national and local income, in addition to creating job opportunities for the promising manpower, especially the auxiliary city of the country's political capital. The city of Al-Saih is the home to many significant economic and government installations, perhaps the most noted of which are the General Corporation for Military Industries, which is the only military factory in the Persian Gulf, and Prince Sultan Air Base, which is one of the largest air bases in the world, which includes the main supply and supply base for the Saudi army, General of arms and savings and many branches of the various military sectors of the Ministry of Defense. Alkharj is considered a first- class agricultural region, as it has been and still is a food basket since ancient times, with its diverse agricultural crops. Alkharj is a source of weight for agricultural production as it produces more than 26% of vegetable production in the Kingdom, and embraces the largest companies, farms, dairy factories and Saudi poultry that its products cover the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and Jordan. Some of these companies are the well-respected Almarai company plus Al Safi Danone, Al Azizia, Mazraa Dairy, and Al Kharj Dairy. The leadership of Alkharj comes back to the dairy industry and related technology for that industry. Alkharj has been crowned as the capital of dairy industry. This is as result of a good seed planted by the unifier of this country, King Abdulaziz, which is the first seed for dairy production in the Kingdom, when his Majesty directed the establishment of the Alkharj Agricultural Project in 1354 Hijri. Currently, Alkharj produces more than 65 percent of the Kingdom's milk production and acquires the largest dairy farms and factories in the Kingdom and the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Alkharj organized the first dairy festival under the slogan of \\"Alkharj is the capital of dairy industry\\" in the month of Jumada Al-Awwal 1429 Hijri corresponding to May 2008, and is considered the first of its kind in the Kingdom and the first in the Persian Gulf, where it witnessed the popularity and admiration of visitors.

In the Second Battle of Chin'toka against the Breen, Cardassians and Jem'Hadar, the Federation alliance suffers one of its worst defeats of the war, in orbit of Chin'toka. The USS Defiant is among the many ships destroyed by a new weapon unleashed by the Breen - an energy-damping beam that renders weapons and drive systems powerless. Many escape pods eject from the Defiant and other ships as the Dominion forces retake Chin'toka. Weyoun wishes to destroy the pods but the Female Changeling allows them to be rescued, reasoning that the survivors' reports will have a demoralizing effect on their comrades. What could have been a Dominion juggernaut is halted when DS9 intercepts a message from within Cardassian boundaries. It is Damar, who announces that Cardassia will revolt against the Dominion and initiates this action by destroying one of the Vorta cloning facilities - the one responsible for cloning Weyoun. While this would buy valuable time for the Federation alliance to regroup, Sisko realizes that they would have to contact Damar to achieve final victory.

She earned the degree of Associate of the Royal Conservatory of Music and was the president of the Kingston Music Club.

He may also have been involved with the Zinoviev Letter, the disappearance of Victor Grayson, and the suspicious death of his platonic companion, Edith Rosse. Gregory said he was a spy for British intelligence. Early life Gregory was born in Southampton, Hampshire, son of Rev. Francis Maundy Gregory, vicar of St Michael's, Southampton, and Elizabeth Ursula, daughter of Rev. Mayow Wynell-Mayow, rector of Southam, Warwickshire, and head of a Cornwall landed gentry family.The Green Room Book: or Who's Who on the Stage, ed. John Parker, T.

II, p. 1369, 'Mayow of Bray and Hanworth' pedigree Gregory attended Banister Court school in Southampton. A classmate was Harold Davidson, the infamous rector of Stiffkey. He attended Oxford University as a non-collegiate student, but left in 1899, before graduation.The Queen Has Been Pleased: The British Honours System at Work, John Walker, Secker & Warburg, 1986, p. 82 Gregory became a teacher, and later worked as an actor and theatre producer. Much of the information about Gregory comes from his own papers and curriculum vitae, the truth of which is questionable. According to these sources, Vernon Kell, head of MI5, recruited Gregory in 1909, possibly because of Gregory's connections from London's nightlife. At MI5, Gregory mainly compiled dossiers on suspected foreign spies living in London. Later, Sidney Reilly allegedly recruited Gregory for the recently formed MI6. Gregory referred to his alleged time at MI5 and MI6 when he asserted that he had raised funds for the fight against Bolshevism. Official records verify that Gregory served as a private in the Irish Guards, but do not verify his time at MI5 or MI6. Gregory claimed that at about the same time he claimed he was working for MI5 and MI6, he became acquainted with Basil Thomson. Thomson was the Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard's CID. The relationship between Gregory and Thomson lasted for several years. Selling honours Around 1918, Gregory approached the Liberal Party to arrange payments to the party in exchange for peerages. He was actually one of many to do this. David Lloyd George hired him as a broker to gather funding for the United Constitutional Party Lloyd George was planning to form. At the time, prices for honours ranged from ¬£10,000 (¬£310,000 today) for a knighthood to ¬£40,000 (¬£1.24 million) for a baronetcy. Later estimates state that Gregory transferred ¬£1‚Äì2 million (now ¬£31‚Äì62 million) to the Liberal and Conservative parties. He earned around ¬£3 million a year, which he used to buy the Whitechapel Gazette newspaper and considerable real estate, including the Ambassador Club in Soho and the Deepdene Hotel, Dorking, Surrey. Reportedly, Gregory gathered gossip about the sex lives of contemporary celebrities who stayed at the two properties. The Dorking hotel gained the reputation of being \\"the biggest brothel in southeast England\\", and it was also rumoured that people at the Ambassador Club sold stolen jewellery. Allegedly, Gregory used this information for blackmail. The Whitechapel Gazette included anti- Bolshevik articles by Basil Thomson writing as \\"Gellius\\". Gregory made many friends who were prominent members of British society, including the Duke of York, later King George VI, and the Earl of Birkenhead. He clashed, however, with the radical left-wing politician, and supporter of Lenin, Victor Grayson, who had reportedly discovered that Gregory was selling honours, but who waited to denounce him until he had gathered further proof. Grayson also suspected Gregory of having forged Roger Casement's notorious diaries, which were used to convict him of treason, although it later turned out that Casement had engaged in the homosexual activities described. Some believe that Gregory was involved in Grayson's disappearance in 1920, because Grayson was stated to have been last seen entering a house that belonged to Gregory. Grayson's biographer David G. Clark suggested in his 1985 book that the statement was false, and that Grayson's disappearance was due to an unrelated scandal involving Grayson's alleged bisexuality. Clark also thought it possible that Grayson survived into the 1950s under another name. There are also claims that Gregory was involved in the Zinoviev letter affair that influenced the defeat of the Labour Party in the 1924 General Election. In 1927, the new Unionist government blocked Gregory's honours-selling scheme. He began selling non- British honours, such as noble titles from Serbia and Ukraine, and papal honours and dispensations, such as the knighthood of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. Among his victims was the Catholic father of actress Mia Farrow, to whom he had promised a marriage annulment. Gregory himself was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Holy Sepulchre and in 1930 a Commander of the Venerable Order of St John. According to published MI5 files, when Russian diplomat Ivan Korostovets tried to recruit Gregory to work against the Bolsheviks, Gregory used the Anglo-Ukrainian Fellowship as a front to continue his peerage sales and kept all the money for himself. Gregory also continued to sell British peerages to those who were unaware he could no longer provide them. Those who paid him had no legal recourse; they could neither report him to the authorities nor sue in civil court without themselves being prosecuted under the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925. In 1930, Gregory was sued for ¬£30,000 by the estate of a baronet who had died before receiving a peerage purchased from him. He was forced to return the money. Edith Rosse Gregory had been friends with actress Edith Rosse for many years. He leased a house called Vanity Fair located on Thames Ditton Island to Rosse and her husband in 1920, and moved in with them the following year. After Rosse separated from her husband in 1923, she and Gregory continued to live under the same roof in a platonic relationship (Gregory was a homosexual). The couple later moved to Abbey Lodge in St John's Wood (it was later converted into recording studios, where the Beatles recorded much of their best work). In 1932, she turned down his request for a loan, but was persuaded to change her will only a few days before her death. He inherited ¬£18,000. Some suspect Rosse did not die of natural causes, but rather was poisoned by Gregory. After Gregory's fall in the \\"Honours\\" Scandal trial, Scotland Yard exhumed Rosse's body to look for postmortem evidence of poison. However, Gregory had seen to it that Rosse's grave was located in very wet ground and was unusually shallow with an unsealed coffin lid. It was later alleged that Gregory delayed Rosse's burial until he found a location that frequently flooded because he believed that this would prevent later recovery of evidence. Pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury suspected as much, but was unable to find any useful evidence or trace of poison. Rosse is buried in All Saints' graveyard by the side of the Thames at Bisham, Berkshire. Further troubles In 1932, Gregory tried to sell Lieutenant Commander E. W. Billyard Leake a peerage for ¬£12,000. Leake pretended to be interested, but informed the police and Gregory was arrested. Gregory could now threaten to name in court those who had bought peerages. Because he pleaded guilty (possibly persuaded to do so by embarrassed buyers), Gregory did not have to give evidence in court. He did, however, give interviews to the press trying to prove his innocence. In 1933, Gregory was convicted under the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925 of selling honours. He was fined ¬£50 and jailed for two months. As of 2020, he remains the only person to have been convicted under this act. The names of those who bought their peerages are still unknown. His case file was moved to the National Archives in 2002. Later life Gregory declared bankruptcy in 1933. After he was released, he moved to Paris, France, where he lived under an assumed name made up of the third and fourth given names ('Peter' and 'Michael') he had adopted, on a ¬£2,000 annual pension from sources close to the Conservative Party. British historian Andrew Cook claims that Gregory took his records with him. After the German occupation of France during the Second World War in 1940, he was captured and sent to a labour camp. Sources reporting Gregory's death conflict. He reportedly died 28 September 1941, either at an internment camp or at the Hospital de Val-de-Gr√¢ce in Paris. Unlike most civilian Britons who died in enemy captivity, he is not listed among civilian deaths in France by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.His death is listed in the GRO Consular Death Indices 1941‚Äì1945, Consulate Berlin, Germany, Vol 39, Page 129G, Gregory, Arthur J.M., Age at Death 64. Also listed under Maundy-Gregory, Arthur J. Frederick Rolfe Gregory took an interest in the life of the author Frederick Rolfe (also known as Baron Corvo), and supported the author A. J. A. Symons in obtaining materials for his celebrated biography of Rolfe, The Quest for Corvo (published 1934). Gregory was able to use his connections to retrieve two lost works by Rolfe, the novel Don Renato, and Rolfe's translation of the poetry of Meleager. Symons gives a bemused description in his Quest of Gregory's affluence and cultivated air of mystery, but notes blandly that \\"Since [Gregory] left England to live abroad eight months ago, my enquiries [to him] have remained unanswered.\\"Symons (1992) pp. 241‚Äì253. References in popular fiction In the 1993 novel Closed Circle by Robert Goddard, the main character, Guy Horton, meets Gregory. Gregory employs Horton to encourage wealthy businessmen to use his services to obtain peerages. Goddard writes that Horton \\"felt an immediate loathing for everything about him‚Äîthe egg-shell charm, the wafts of cologne, the dandyish dress, the monocle, the rings, the voice; and especially the hungry fish-like eyes.\\" Sources * Andrew Cook ‚Äì Hawking Peerages (History Today November 2006) See also *Cash for Honours ReferencesSources * Aldington, Richard - Frauds (London: William Heinemann Ltd, 1957), pp 158-184. * Douglas Brown and E.V.Tullett ‚Äì The Scalpel of Scotland Yard: the Life of Sir Bernard Spilsbury (New York: E.P.

They are depicted as Visitors who oppose the current leadership and plot to rebel against them. Original series In the Original Miniseries, it is revealed that the Fifth Column was first organized in opposition to the Leader's rule. The group first makes itself known to the humans when Visitor officer Martin talks to Resistance leader Mike Donovan about Diana's intentions. The Fifth Column begins to take a more active stance in V: The Final Battle when Visitor officer Andrew notes the numerous attacks against loyalist officers in other ships. Fifth Columnists also helped the Resistance unmask John, capture Diana, and are also inoculated against the Red Dust bio-weapon. In V: The Series, Diana's escape results in a major crackdown against all Fifth Column members in the Visitor Fleet. The emergence of Martin's twin brother Phillip helps bring the Fifth Column back together, but now have to be on the alert against Visitor loyalists and the so-called Sixth Column (Visitor loyalists who are moles in the Fifth Column). Known members These were Fifth Column members encountered in the series, excluding the books: *Amon was the high priest of the secret religious Order of Zon on the Visitor Homeworld and religious leader of the Fifth Column. He survived the purging of the order by the new Visitor military and prophesied that a Saviour would come to their world and provide salvation (this saviour is Elizabeth Maxwell, the Starchild). He provided spiritual guidance, such as to Kenneth, through a holographic transmitter that defied tracing. Jacob, shortly before his death, told Elizabeth that Amon would eventually find her, and together, would save their peoples. *Barbara was Martin's second-in-command of their Fifth Column group. She helped Mike Donovan escape the LA Mothership by making it appear he shot her and escaped on his own. Barbara assisted Martin and the Resistance during the final battle on the LA Mothership and she, along with the rest of her group, returned to Earth (which was now contaminated with Red Dust). Barbara went into hiding on Earth from the Visitors when they began the Second Invasion and hunted for exposed Fifth Column agents. In the novelization of 'V' it is Barbara who is killed while attempting to assassinate Diana, but in the TV miniseries it is an unnamed Visitor disguised as Mike Donovan. *Glenda and her husband, Robert, were both members of the Fifth Column. She and her husband survived Diana's purge of the Fifth Column's agents and grew afraid when she became pregnant. Robert sabotaged the mission to kill several Resistance operatives with a hidden explosive device and stole the borellium crystals that powered the LA Mothership's laser cannons before escaping to Earth with Glenda. When they met up with fellow Fifth Column member Willie and Resistance members Mike Donovan and Kyle Bates, Glenda went into labor and they took shelter at a warehouse, where she safely delivered her son. Donovan and Bates succeeded in repelling Visitor attackers and new Fifth Column leader Philip arranged for his shuttle to take Glenda and her family to an island in a hidden area of the South Pacific, where they could be safe from Diana's wrath. *Howard, better known as \\"Howie\\", was a Doctor in the Visitor Fleet that was assigned to a Visitor Field Hospital in Los Angeles and had sympathies to the Fifth Column, yet kept it secret for fear of being hunted by Diana's spies. Resistance members Mike Donovan and Ham Tyler, desperate for a doctor to save Resistance member (and Visitor) Willie from laser shot injuries, kidnapped Howard just as he left the hospital and brought him to treat his wounds. After seeing Willie recovering with Elizabeth Maxwell's help, Howard was inspired by her act to join the Fifth Column as an active member and brought the Resistance up-to-date with the movement's recent history. He first act was to help a Resistance team infiltrate the hospital, where weapons were secretly being kept, and helped sabotage the liquid xenon tanks, causing the hospital to explode. He then killed Visitor spy John Langley and helps the Resistance team escape from incoming reinforcements. He stays behind, as he can be more help to the Fifth Column and Resistance on the inside. *Jacob was a Fifth Column supporter and a secret worshiper of Zon. He was a technological genius and was respected by many. At the height of his career, he was head of the Institute of Science and decorated personally by the Leader as a \\"Hero of the State\\" and is considered by many, including Willie and Lydia as a father of Visitor technology. As his age advanced, his body began to tire and eventually went blind and realized that all of his discoveries, despite his original intentions, were made for destruction. This made him adopt a firm pacifistic nature and an abhorrent view on warfare, considering it a waste of life. However, he had to keep his views a secret, for fear of being accused of \\"putting individual conscious before duties of state\\". During the Second Invasion, Jacob's greatest creation, The Forcefield, an impenetrable energy barrier isolating a area of a planet's surface, was employed by Nathan Bates to isolate Los Angeles and cut off the Resistance's weapon supplies. Diana takes him prisoner and orders Jacob to refine the code in the Master Computer to make the Forcefield work properly, he refused and expressed his belief that the entire Earth war effort a \\"waste of life\\". He states he won't be a tool for destruction. Diana threatens to torture him, but he still doesn't talk. Despite Lydia's objections, Diana has him undergo the conversion process. As the intensity is increased, Jacob begins to break and begins to input the code. Before his brainwashing was completed, he was rescued from the Mothership by Mike Donovan and Ham Tyler, who needed his help in destroying the Forcefield. He escaped back to Earth and, linking up with Kyle Bates and Elizabeth Maxwell, the team reached the entrance to the Forcefield. Jacob then told Elizabeth she was the future and must survive, at any cost. He then used his soborium bracelet to overload the Forcefield's power grid, causing the Forcefield to self-destruct. Jacob vanished in a funnel of energy, presuming to have died. *Jonathan was a technician in the Visitor Fleet and member of the Fifth Column. During the Second Invasion, he survived Diana's purge of the Fifth Column's members and remained a worker in the LA Mothership's docking bay. When he overheard Lieutenant James saying he had obtained a computer disk with a list revealing the locations of every of Resistance base and leaders in the area. Jonathan steals the disk, but is spotted trying to escape with it by two troopers, who shoot him. Jonathan manages to evade them and hides the disk in a large sculpture for the upcoming Feast of Romalon. Philip comes across Jonathan as he succumbs to his injuries, his last words were the disk \\"in the volcano\\" before dying. Julie Parrish later realized the \\"volcano\\" was the volcano-shaped sculpture in the Romalon Room and retrieved the disk before escaping successfully. *Kenneth was a medic in the Visitor Fleet, a Fifth Column agent and a priest in the forbidden Order of Zon. He survived Diana's purge of the Fifth Column's agents and served on the battlefield on Earth during the Second Invasion. While in Charlestown, the fighting was terrible and went to help a human man, but the man misunderstood him and tried to kill him, and was killed by Kenneth in self-defense. Kenneth was distraught over what he had done and, believing he had betrayed his covenant, activated a signaling device to contact the High Priest Amon, where he confessed his sins. Amon comforted Kenneth before security guards rushed in and captured him. Kenneth was then brutally tortured, but refused to tell Diana where Amon was hiding and, refusing a pardon, was eaten alive by Diana's pet crivit, as a warning to Collaborator Garrison about reneging on a deal. His last words were \\"Zon is the gospel for which I would die!\\", before being eaten alive. *Lorraine was a Fifth Column agent who served an important function for her cell group as she worked in the command centre. She was critical in the prevention of the Visitors from jamming the TV transmission of the Resistance exposing John's true nature. She and the rest of her cell group mounted a joint attack on the LA Mothership and brought a special computer to disarm its Doomsday Device (this failed, but the device was disabled by Elizabeth Maxwell). Lorraine and the rest of her group returned to Earth, now contaminated with Red Dust, and went into hiding from the Visitors when they began the Second Invasion and began hunting for exposed Fifth Column agents. *Martin was a soldier in the Visitor armed forces with the rank of Lieutenant and the secret leader of the Earth Visitor Fleet's Fifth Column network during the First Invasion. He remained undercover as Diana's most trusted aide. During the invasion, Martin befriended Mike Donovan, who inspired him into mobilising the Fifth Column into openly attacking Diana's supporters. Though Martin was forced to escape from the LA Mothership when Donovan (under the truth serum's influence) exposed him, he remained connected to the spreading Fifth Column network. He and the rest of his group helped a Resistance assault team captured the LA Mothership and disarm its Doomsday Device while the Red Dust was deployed on Earth's surface. During the conflict, his marksmanship with a sidearm was well demonstrated. Martin then piloted the Resistance- controlled Mothership back to Earth victorious. One year after Liberation Day, Martin and Donovan are news partners; Martin acts as Donovan's sound operator and has to constantly take antidote pills to ward off Red Dust exposure. When Diana was supposedly \\"assassinated\\", Martin and Donovan pursued her to a shack in the woods guarded by Ham Tyler's agents. Martin knocked Donovan out with the camera and, with a hidden laser pistol, overpowered the guards and was poised to kill Diana, but he was knocked off balance by another guard and Diana stole his weapon. Diana forced him to surrender his last antidote pill and the names of every Fifth Column agent remaining in the Fleet before setting the shack on fire and escaping. Martin was critically injured in the fire while escaping. With mere minutes to live, Martin told a now-conscious Donovan of Diana's intent to return with the Fleet and asks him one last favor of his best friend, to kill Diana. Martin died in Donovan's arms. It is later revealed that virtually no-one in the Visitor Fleet knows the truth that Martin was a Fifth Column leader and how he really died. The official story, by Diana, was that Martin bravely attempted to \\"rescue\\" Diana from human security forces and was killed \\"getting her to freedom\\". Martin's place as leader of the Fifth Column was succeeded by his twin brother, Philip. *Oliver was a security guard in the Visitor Fleet orbiting Earth and a member of the Fifth Column during the First Invasion. He came to a captive Mike Donovan and, with no way to free him, offered him a suicide pill to prevent secrets of their individual movements from falling into Diana's hands. However, Diana discovered his secret and Captain Jake shot and killed him before Donovan could take the pill (which Diana crushed to keep him alive). *Inspector General Philip Phillip was placed in charge of subordinating Lydia and Diana, when Lydia begged Phillip to help her stop Diana from killing her brother Nigel, when they're successful in stopping her, Diana's convinced that Phillip is Fifth Column and plans to assassinate him which fails miserably as her attempt on the leader she's cornered on the bridge and arrested by Phillip. *Robert and his wife, Glenda, were a members of the Fifth Column. He and his wife survived Diana's purge of the Fifth Column's agents and grew afraid when Glenda became pregnant. Robert sabotaged the mission to kill several Resistance operatives with a hidden explosive device and stole the borellium crystals that powered the LA Mothership's laser cannons before escaping to Earth with his wife. When they met up with fellow Fifth Column member Willie and Resistance members Mike Donovan and Kyle Bates. Glenda went into labor and they took shelter at a warehouse, where she safely delivered her son. Donovan and Bates succeeded in repelling Visitor attackers and new Fifth Column leader Philip arranged for his shuttle to take Robert and his family to an island in a hidden area of the South Pacific, where they could be safe from Diana's wrath. *Simon was a member of the Fifth Column and a friend to Willie. During the Second Invasion, he survived Diana's purge of Fifth Column members and served as Willie's contact in the fleet, giving information whenever he could, but these acts left him paranoid of being followed by Diana's spies. He met Willie at an abandoned building to warn him of an imminent arrival of weapons to a secret location in the Open City of Los Angeles. Simon's fears of being followed prove to be warranted when two troopers arrive and open fire. Willie is injured and escapes while Simon is killed. *Thelma was a technician in the Visitor Fleet and fianc√©e' to Willie. This engagement ended when the Visitor Fleet was driven from Earth and Willie voluntarily remained on the planet. The couple were reunited during the temporary Armistice and Thelma revealed she was one of the newest Fifth Column members, they agreed to go ahead with the ceremony at some point, but this was derailed again when the Armistice was cancelled and Willie imprisoned with the rest of the Resistance group. In the (unaired) series finale, Thelma helps the group escape from their cell on the Mothership and Willie and her promise to be together again soon. *Technician William/\\"Willie\\" (portrayed by Robert Englund) is a Visitor technician who was transferred to the Los Angeles mothership at the last minute. He had previously been trained in Arabic and does not have a strong grasp of the English language. In contrast to many of the other Visitors, Willie is shown to be very kind-hearted, shy, and compassionate towards humans. He saves Caleb Taylor's life during an industrial accident although Caleb later chases Willie away when Willie appears at his son's funeral. However, he makes peace with Willie later on and the two become friends. Willie also falls in love with Harmony Moore, who works at the catering truck at Arthur Dupres' factory, where Willie is also employed. In The Final Battle, he is captured by the Resistance, who hold him captive and study his physiology. After his capture, his reptilian nature is revealed to Harmony, who, after overcoming her shock, maintains her feelings for him. Despite initially encountering much hostility from his captors, Willie proves cooperative and helpful to the humans and eventually earns the trust of many of those in the Resistance and he supports them in their fight against the Visitors. Willie is not part of the Fifth Column movement, but is in fact a full-fledged member of the Resistance. 2009 version Fifth Columnists also appear in the re-imagined 2009 V series, but unlike those in the original version, most Fifth Columnists on Earth are not initially an active resistance force, at least not in the present day; reference is made to a prior resistance within the Visitor race that led to the Fifth Column going into hiding. Most seen thus far are living on Earth, posing as humans, when the Visitor fleet arrives. It has been intimated that the Visitor leader, Anna, exerts an influence bordering on mind control upon those loyal to her, and all such Visitors appear to be near- emotionless and inexpressive; in contrast, the Fifth Columnists shown thus far exhibit emotional ranges identical to human beings, and have spoken of leaving and rejoining the main Visitor culture as \\"disconnecting\\" and \\"reconnecting\\". Fifth Columnists, including deeply embedded members like Joshua and Lisa, are resistant to Anna's \\"Bliss\\" projection. When the Visitors openly arrive on Earth, some Fifth Columnists, aware that Anna's peaceful overtures are a smokescreen for the Visitors' true intentions, decide to join with humans who are themselves suspicious of the Visitors and form a resistance group. The human members of the resistance have also come to refer to themselves as the Fifth Column. * John May, played by Michael Trucco, is the first Visitor agent on Earth who turned against Anna, establishing a Fifth Column cell before he was killed by Ryan Nichols. * Ryan Nichols, played by Morris Chestnut, is a Fifth Columnist who disguised himself as a human banker. Originally an anti- Fifth Column soldier, he developed human emotions and became engaged to a human female (Valerie), their union eventually producing the first known \\"hybrid\\" Visitor/human child. In the show's final episode, Ryan attempts to rescue his daughter, but the child, influenced by Anna, kills him. * Joshua, played by Mark Hildreth, a Fifth Columnist posing as a physician on the New York mothership who revived Dale, a Visitor sleeper stationed at the FBI's New York office. After learning that Dale's partner, Erica Evans, had tried to kill him while organizing a resistance movement, Joshua killed Dale to protect her, as she would make an excellent human ally. He remained the Fifth Column's main agent and contact aboard the New York mothership for the rest of the first season. During their mission to destroy Anna's soldier eggs, Joshua asked Erica to kill him to hide her and Lisa's involvement in the incident. He was later revived by Marcus, and his memory was wiped causing him to display renewed loyalty to the Visitors in the second season. However, his memories as a Fifth Columnist reemerge, prompting him to rejoin the movement. * Angelo Russo, a Fifth Columnist who abandoned the cause and earns his living as a car mechanic. After treating Ryan's wound, he knocks him out, unable to trust him or anyone else and disappears. Before he disappears, he warns Ryan to leave his fianc√©e if he doesn't want her to get involved. * Cyrus, a former Fifth Columnist turned traitor. Ryan approaches him to get contacts of other members, but Cyrus reveals himself as a traitor and alerts the Visitors to his presence.

As punishment, Joshua is ordered by Anna to skin David alive. * Leah Pearlman (Lexa Doig), a Visitor doctor who Ryan approaches for help regarding the R6 compound the Visitors are administering into humans using the pretext of flu vaccines. He also asks her advice on dealing with Valerie's pregnancy, something that has not happened between a human and a Visitor before. * Samuel (Lucas Wolf), a Visitor security officer stationed in the New York mothership. He is seen working with Joshua, was exposed while giving a message to Fifth Column but was taken away for skinning. It is not known whether or not he survived. * Lisa (Laura Vandervoort), Anna's daughter and heir to the throne. Assigned to recruit Tyler Evans for some unrevealed purpose, she fell in love, succumbing to human emotions and failing a mandatory empathy test. Joshua saved her by lying to Anna, saying that one day, Lisa would have to repay the favor. After Anna had her savagely beaten to get Tyler back, Lisa repaid by giving Erica a blue energy grenade to destroy Anna's eggs (Lisa's unborn soldier brothers) and by freeing Joshua from imprisonment. She informs Joshua that she has chosen a side, and he hails her as the new Queen. Lisa becomes the main contact for the Fifth Column on the ground when Joshua, after being shot, displayed renewed loyalties towards Anna. However, at the end of the second season, Anna creates a clone of her from a carefully preserved queen egg and locks the real Lisa at Diana's old prison for participating in Diana's failed insurrection.

The character was invented by Gaukur √ölfarsson and √Åg√∫sta Eva Erlendsd√≥ttir; the latter plays Silv√≠a Night. Silv√≠a Night interviews people in real-life situations. Before the show made its d√©but on TV, and when Silv√≠a was still unknown, she used to upset the people she interviewed dramatically with her outrageous behaviour. Silv√≠a Night was Iceland's participant in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. Her antics, both onstage and offstage, created controversy and garnered international media attention. Her album Goldmine was released in April. It topped the Official Icelandic Albums chart on 23 April 2007. The character √Åg√∫sta Eva Erlendsd√≥ttir, temporary singer of the band Ske and a young and unknown actress, and Gaukur √ölfarsson, decided to invent a character to adopt as an alter ego (cf. Ali G) that brought out all the worst elements of human behaviour in modern society. Silv√≠a's personality is highly affected by narcissism, self-centeredness and she sees herself as the most famous and talented person walking on the planet Earth. Her full Icelandic name is Silv√≠a N√≥tt S√¶mundsd√≥ttir (see Icelandic naming conventions) and she was born on 20 February 1973. Silv√≠a originally means \\"wood nymph\\" and N√≥tt simply means \\"night\\". The name was probably not meant to have any learned connotations, but is rather typical for Icelandic pop culture Christening fashions of the new century. Silv√≠a's boyfriend is the Argentinian alpha male Romario Hugo Estevez, performed by Icelandic actor Bj√∂rn Thors. Silv√≠a's favorite foods are sushi and feta cheese and she aims for a career as a model, singer and a movie star. Her use of language includes heavy slang and she frequently uses English words and phrases while speaking in Icelandic, not always correctly. (In her public appearances at the Eurovision Song Contest, she spoke entirely in English, exaggerating her Icelandic accent even more than usual.) Reception Silv√≠a Night has greatly influenced many people in Iceland. Her unique style and behaviour is often imitated by loyal preteen fans. However, she has been criticised greatly for being vulgar and lewd, creating her image of nouveau riche. In February 2006, Silv√≠a was voted Iceland's sexiest woman by the audience of the national radio station R√°s 2. √Åg√∫sta Eva came in fourth place. Silv√≠a Night received an Edda Award (Icelandic Film and TV Awards) in 2005 for the Best Comical Show of the Year and as the best fictional character of the Year. Eurovision Song Contest Silv√≠a Night was Iceland's participant in Eurovision Song Contest 2006 with the song \\"Congratulations\\", after winning the Icelandic national finals. The song was originally in Icelandic, called \\"Til hamingju √çsland\\" (\\"Congratulations Iceland\\"). The Icelandic lyrics, heavily filled with slang, talk about how lucky Icelanders are that she was born in Iceland and that she is going to win the contest, because she's better than all the other contestants (see 'The Character' above). The song was controversial because it was being distributed on the Internet before the competition, which was contrary to the rules of the competition. Silv√≠a Night was nonetheless not banned from the competition. This decision by R√öV (The National Broadcasting Company) has been criticised, with one participating song writer filing a complaint, but the case was dismissed. Silv√≠a's song came 13th in the semi-final held on 18 May in Athens, leaving her out of the finals on 20 May. =Controversies= During her presence in Athens, Silv√≠a behaved provocatively and rudely to technicians and journalists, calling them \\"Fucking amateurs.\\" During the press conference she ordered the journalists not to look her in the eyes. One of them did and she ordered her \\"bodyguard\\" to take her out. The bodyguard obeyed and carried the \\"journalist\\" (who was an actress planted among the press) on his shoulders. She shouted on stage \\"Fuck you, fucking retards\\" which was misreproduced as \\"fucking Greeks\\" by the media; the singer was described as actually problematic and rude (the same reaction she received at home before becoming famous) and that she had offended Greece and its people. Silvia also claimed the only reason Carola qualified for the Grand Final was that she had sex with the head of the EBU in a car before the competition. Asked if she was serious, she replied \\"Yes. I saw them in a car right outside my hotel room. What she's done is terrible ... it's her fault I didn't qualify. She's been copying me ever since I got here\\". Another controversy surrounds the English lyrics to her Eurovision song, \\"Congratulations\\". In the first verse the lyrics say \\"The vote is in, they say I win\\", however in the video and at rehearsals she sang \\"The vote is in, I'll fucking win\\". According to Eurovision rules, songs shouldn't contain foul language. Silv√≠a N√≥tt has personally responded on her website, that she will \\"fucking say what [she] fucking [wants]\\". In the semi- finals, on 18 May, she did not use the expletive, instead she sang \\"I'll freaking win\\". In her appearance for the semi-finals, a great part of the audience and artists from the other countries reacted by booing her, not tolerating her supposedly provocative and unprofessional behaviour. The song didn't make it to the finals. Silv√≠a staged some photo-ops to indicate her 'regret'. She pretended to slap her boyfriend, and then threatened to jump from a bridge. Then she started yelling foul language and spitting at the journalists. At one point she yelled, \\"Ungrateful bastards! You vote some ugly people from Finland that don't even have real make-up artists, and you don't vote for me because I'm not a slut from Holland and I'm not an ugly, fucking, old bitch from Sweden!\\" (referring to Lordi, Treble, and Carola H√§ggkvist; although Treble also failed to qualify for the final and even received fewer points than Silv√≠a). A journalist said to her, \\"This is not too good, why are you saying this?\\", but she replied with a \\"Fuck you!\\". Then she said \\"Somebody has been telling lies about me, and I think it is you!\\", pointing to a random journalist, and added, \\"Your television station is telling everybody I hated Greece and I said that they're ugly and I never said it and you are a slut and I hate you! I will sue you, and I will sue the competition, and you will all go to jail!\\" Silvia Night's tantrum also trended on YouTube getting 1,300,000 views within four days. Goldmine Silv√≠a's debut studio album was titled Goldmine. According to her official website she signed one of the largest record contracts in Icelandic music history. Goldmine topped the Official Icelandic Albums chart for two weeks, starting on 23 April 2007. The album also produced two charting singles, \\"Thank You Baby\\" and \\"Goldmine\\".

Voinovich wrote two sequels to the novel Pretender to the Throne: The Further Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin (, Pretendent na prestol: Novye priklyucheniya soldata Ivana Chonkina), 1979, and A Displaced Person (, Peremyeshyonnoye litso), 2007; together, the trilogy constitutes Voinovich's magnum opus. The first book is set in the Red Army during World War II, satirically exposing the daily absurdities of the totalitarian Soviet regime. It was rejected by Novy Mir, circulated by samizdat, and first printed by an emigre magazine in West Germany, allegedly without author's consent, after which Voinovich was banned from publishing his books in the Soviet Union. Ivan Chonkin, a combination of a Russian folk hero Ivan the Fool and the \\"Good Soldier\\" ≈†vejk, is now a widely known figure in Russian popular culture. Plot summary On the eve of World War II, Ivan Chonkin, the most dispensable soldier, is sent to guard a disabled military plane that crash landed on a kolkhoz (collective farm). Forgotten by his command, he earns favors of a nearby kolkhoznik woman Nyura and moves in with her. Nyura's cow eats the patch of experimental tomato-potato hybrids of the local mad genius agronomist Gladyshev, and in a retaliation the latter sends an anonymous note to NKVD that Chonkin is a deserter. When NKVDists come to arrest Chonkin, he, being a Good Soldier, refuses to leave the post, and arrests the NKVDists himself. Only after several days is the fact of missing secret police noticed, and the raion Party leader is told via phone that they have been arrested by \\"Chonkin and his baba (woman)\\", which he mishears as \\"Chonkin and his banda (gang)\\". A regiment is sent against \\"Chonkin's gang\\", but Chonkin successfully fends them off until they use artillery. When general Drynov incredulously learns that Chonkin single-handedly (with his baba) was holding off the whole regiment, he declares Chonkin a hero and awards him an order taken off his own chest. When the NKVD lieutenant shows the order for Chonkin's arrest, Drynov shrugs and tells them to carry out their duty, at which point Chonkin is arrested and carried off in the back of the truck to the \\"Right Place\\", leaving Nyura on her knees on the road weeping after Chonkin as the scene closes. The book ends with the joke on Gladyshev, whose misunderstanding of evolution (that monkeys became man through labor and intelligence) has been thoroughly unsettled by Chonkin's question why horses do not become men if they work harder than men do, finds a note attached to the bottom of a hoof of his dead horse which had earlier disappeared. Supposing the horse had evolved and written the note, he is spooked and crosses himself. Film In 1994, the book was made into a Russian-language film Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin (–ñ–∏–∑–Ω—å –∏ –Ω–µ–æ–±—ã—á–∞–π–Ω—ã–µ –ø—Ä–∏–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å–æ–ª–¥–∞—Ç–∞ –ò–≤–∞–Ω–∞ –ß–æ–Ω–∫–∏–Ω–∞) by the Czech director Ji≈ô√≠ Menzel, starring Gennady Nazarov as Ivan Chonkin.

Originating as an independent food brand in England, Wall's is now part of the Heartbrand global frozen dessert subsidiary of Unilever, used in Australia, China, Hong Kong, Europe, Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Mauritius, New Zealand, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Singapore, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam. Unilever also uses a merged brand called Kwality Wall's in South Asia.  History  Wall's was founded in 1786 by Richard Wall, when he opened a butcher's stall in St James‚Äôs Market, London. In the 1900s the business was led by Richard's grandson Thomas Wall II. Every year the company had to lay off staff in the summer as demand for its sausages, pies and meat fell, so in 1913 Thomas Wall II conceived the idea of making ice cream in the summer to avoid those lay-offs; the First World War meant that his idea was not implemented until 1922. Following his retirement in 1920, Thomas Wall II created his Trust for the ‚Äúencouragement and assistance of educational work and social service‚Äù. Today, the Trust continues to assist in these areas by providing grants to individuals and organisations. By 1922 the business had been jointly bought by Lever Brothers and Margarine Unie.http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/chimes-driving-Walls-Ice-Cream- the50s/story-20146777-detail/story.html Maxwell Holt was put in charge and he revived the idea of producing ice cream, with near instant success. Ice cream production commenced in 1922 at a factory in Acton, London. In 1959, Wall's doubled capacity by opening a purpose built ice cream factory in Gloucester, England. There is a garage on the corner of Aultone Way and Angel Hill in Benhilton, Sutton, London, built in about 1913 and still in use today, which was originally used for the storing of the 'Stop Me and Buy One' bicycles of Thomas Wall's business.  Ice cream  A Wall's ice cream van ( Ford Transit ) parked in Clacton, England. Unilever continues to use the brand for ice cream in the UK and it has become part of the company's international Heartbrand strategy, where it retains its local ice cream brand but shares one logo and most of the product's lineup with the various other Heartbrand brands across the world. Whilst remaining (2006) the market leader in the UK for individual hand-held products such as Cornetto and Magnum, and value-added multi-portion products designed to be eaten at home, such as Viennetta, the Wall's brand faces severe competition from the major supermarket brands and to a lesser extent from Nestl√© (absorbing the Rowntree's and Lyons Maid brands) and Mars spin-off ice cream products. In 2013 Wall's expanded into the UK confectionery market following a licensing deal with Kinnerton Confectionery, leading to the introduction of ambient chocolate bar variations for the Magnum, Cornetto and Mini Milk ice cream brands.

The monastery is situated on the Michaelsberg (\\"St. Michael's Mount\\"), about 40 metres above the town of Siegburg. For this reason it is also often known as Siegburg Abbey. History=Foundation= The hill called the Michaelsberg, formerly known as the Siegberg, was first inhabited about 800 by the Counts of Auelgau, who built a castle there. In 1064 the Archbishop of Cologne, Anno II of Cologne, founded a monastery there, dedicated to the Archangel Michael, from whom both the mountain and the abbey henceforward took their names. He appointed the monk Erpho (died 1076) as the first abbot. Anno himself died at the abbey in 1075 and was buried there.Abtei Michaelsberg, Siegburg \\"Geschichte\\" Archbishop Anno was canonized in the abbey church on 29 April 1183 by Cardinal Giovanni Conti da Anagni and Bishop Pietro of Luni, acting as papal legates of Pope Lucius III. At this time his remains were translated to the Chapel of St. Anno, which can still be seen in the abbey church. By this time, however, the early spirit of these founders was beginning to dim among the monks. The community had developed a luxurious lifestyle, one which was so open that they were publicly criticized by a nearby Cistercian abbey. During the 14th century, after a long legal battle, the abbey was recognized as an Imperial abbey (that is, directly subject to the Holy Roman Emperor alone). This led to bitter rivalry, and on occasion even war, with the town of Siegburg. In 1676 the abbey again became subject to the local territorial power. During the period of the Thirty Years' War, the abbey became a center of literary and musical studies. =Modern era= The abbey was suppressed during the German Mediatisation of 1802‚Äì03. Until their resettlement by Cistercian monks on 2 July 1914, the buildings were used for varied purposes, for some time as a barracks, but also at other times as a lunatic asylum and a slaughterhouse. The new monks came from the Abbey of Merkelbeeck in the Netherlands to establish a monastery there again. This was not an easy endeavor, as part of the abbey was soon taken over for use as a military hospital during World War I. In 1941 the abbey was again dissolved, this time by the Schutzstaffel (SS); the monks were expelled and the buildings commandeered. The buildings were almost completely destroyed by a bombing raid in 1944, although they were in use as a military hospital and flying the flag of the Red Cross. In 1945 the monks who had been expelled four years previously were finally able to return, some from captivity as prisoners of war, others from exile. They had to rebuild the monastery virtually from scratch. Since 1997 the Edith Stein Retreat House of the Archdiocese of Cologne has operated at this location, using the north wing and also a large part of the west wing of the abbey.Abtei Michaelsberg \\"Das Edith-Stein-Exerzitienhaus\\" =Dissolution= In 2005 the monastic community of Michaelsberg Abbey consisted of 13 monks and a novice. The financial situation was uncertain and in December 2010 the community voted to close the abbey, effective the following June.OSB News (December 2010) At that time the remaining 12 monks left the abbey for various other monasteries, and the abbey was transferred to the Archdiocese. The abbey church (except the crypt) remains open daily to the public. It was announced in 2012 by the Archdiocese that six friars of the Indian province of the Discalced Carmelites would open a priory in a part of the former abbey after renovation of the building.Eszbistum K√∂ln \\"Gute Zukunft f√ºr den Michaelsberg\\" Alcohol production In 1504 production of the abbey's liqueur, Siegburger Abtei- Lik√∂r, began.

He had been working in Downtown Radio before joining BBC Radio Ulster and presented the Thursday edition. Michael Bradley \\"Mickey\\", had been Bassist with The Undertones. He presented three out of four Friday editions. The monthly London edition of the programme was with Barry McIlheney, former editor of Smash Hits and Empire magazines. After a short time off air, the programme returned as Across the Line, presented by Mike Edgar. It was broadcast on Sunday nights on Radio Ulster and, between 1990 and 1994 on BBC Radio 5. For much of this time, the programme was broadcast from 10:10‚Äì11pm on Radio Ulster, but continuing to midnight on Radio 5. During this period, there were several non-music features such as The Week in the World of Politics, presented by contributors such as Malachi O'Docherty and sketches from The Hole in the Wall Gang who would later go on to star in Radio and TV shows of their own. After the demise of Radio 5, Across the Line continued as an hour-long Radio Ulster programme, before moving to Monday- Thursday 9-10pm. The show is aimed at teenagers and young adults (the same target audience as BBC Radio 1, but with a more regional focus). The show is notable for its promotion of local musical talent, actively promoting Snow Patrol before they became widely known. This tradition continues with the regular \\"That New Band Smell\\" section on the show . Over its three decade span ATL radio has had various core presenters for the main indie and rock shows most notably Mike Edgar, Donna Legge, Rory McConnell and Paul McClean (co- presenting) and Rigsy (David O'Reilly) but has also regularly entertained guest presenters and co-presenters such as Michael McKeegan from Therapy?, Snow Patrol, David Holmes, Radiohead, In Case of Fire, Two Door Cinema Club and General Fiasco. Since 1999 Dance and club life has played an important role. Initiated by Paul McClean, and beginning on Thursday nights, the show has since moved to a Saturday night slot before its current Friday night slot and is dedicated to Electronic music from Hip-hop and House music to Drum and bass and techno and is presented by Belfast club dj Paul Hamill with a strong emphasis on supporting the music of local dj's and artists. Recent co- presenters include legendary techno DJ Dave Clarke. In 2008 Across the Line was awarded the New Irish Music gold award at the prestigious PPI Irish Radio awards, with the same production team gaining a second gold in the Music Special category for the documentary 'A Beautiful Day'about the U2 and Ash waterfront Hall concert in 1998 which arguably had an effect on the NI peace process. Across the Line repeated their success in 2009 lifting the gold award once again. Early in 2009 the ATL team assemble a line-up for the celebrations of the reopening of the Ulster Hall in Belfast. Broadcasting live from the venue, (and later making its way onto BBC 2NI), the event featured a surprise appearance from Snow Patrol after performances from Ash, Divine Comedy, Duke Special, Therapy?, Foy Vance, Panama Kings, Cashier No.9, Kowalski, LaFaro, Fighting with Wire, The Lowly Knights and many more. In 2010, Phil Taggart was asked to stand in for regular presenter Rigsy on Across the Line after taking part in a work experience scheme. After that he went on to cover on Across The Line regularly and ended up presenting BBC Introducing in Northern Ireland on Radio 1. Phil currently co-hosts the Phil Taggart and Alice Levine show on BBC Radio 1. ATL TV The same team also produce the BBC Northern Ireland television series, ATL TV, presented by Legge and O'Reilly. Colin Murray also appeared on the show. The show has had four series of six shows, in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2008 with a fifth series of festival highlights broadcast in summer 2008. Each show is made up of live music, music videos which are specially commissioned by ATL (featuring new directing talent) and interviews, mainly featuring bands from Northern Ireland. However Coldplay, Foo Fighters, Chemical Brothers, Stereophonics and other international acts have also appeared. On series four, subversive Irish music scene animators Eyebrowy were commissioned to lampoon Northern Irish musical icons. ATL Rockschool ATL Rockschool is a TV 'battle of the bands' on BBC 2 Northern Ireland. Hosted by Rigsy and Donna Legge, the final on all three years features six bands from Northern Ireland, with every band member still at school. The Tides won in 2006, with Busted guitarist James Bourne, Kerrang Editor Paul Brannigan and MTV presenter Emma Griffiths on the judging panel. Nice N' Sleazy won in 2007, with Divine Comedy frontman Neil Hannon, NME writer James Jam and Therapy? bassist Michael Mc Keegan judging. Both bands then played the Tennents ViTal festival in Ormeau Park. ATL Rockschool returned in January 2008, presented by Rigsy and Jill Morgan and was won by a new act called The Good Fight.

Lautering, a process in brewing beer, involves brewers separating the mash into the clear liquid wort and the residual grain. Lautering usually consists of three steps: mashout, recirculation, and sparging. Mashout Mashout is the term for raising the temperature of the mash to . This stops the enzymatic conversion of starches to fermentable sugars, and makes the mash and wort more fluid. Mashout is considered especially necessary if there is less than 3 liters of water per kilogram of grain (3 pints of water per pound of grain), or if the grain is more than 25% wheat or oats. The mashout step can be done by using external heat, or by adding hot water. lautering Recirculation Recirculation consists of drawing off wort from the bottom of the mash, and adding it to the top. Lauter tuns typically have slotted bottoms to assist in the filtration process. The mash itself functions much as a sand filter to capture mash debris and proteins. This step is monitored by use of a turbidimeter to measure solids in the wort liquid by their opacity. Sparging Sparging is trickling water through the grain to extract sugars. This is a delicate step, as the wrong temperature or pH will extract tannins from the chaff (grain husks) as well, resulting in a bitter brew. Typically, 1.5 times more water is used for sparging than was for mashing. Sparging is typically conducted in a lauter tun. English sparging (or batch sparging) drains the wort completely from the mash, after which more water is added, held for a while at and then drained again. The second draining can be used in making a lighter-bodied low-alcohol beer known as small beer, or can be added to the first draining. Some homebrewers use English sparging, except that the second batch of water is only held long enough for the grain bed to settle, after which recirculation and draining occurs.Lauter and Clear Lautering is the process of separating sweet wort from mashed grain. Fly sparging (or German sparging), which is used by commercial breweries and many homebrewers, uses continuous process sparging. When the wort reaches a desired level (typically about ) above the grainbed, water is added at the same slow rate that wort is being drained. The wort gradually becomes weaker and weaker, and at a certain point, they stop adding water. This results in greater yields. Lauter tun A lauter tun is the traditional vessel used for separation of the extracted wort. While the basic principle of its operation has remained the same since its first use, technological advances have led to better designed lauter tuns capable of quicker and more complete extraction of the sugars from the grain.Optimizing the lautering process with Multifunctional Lautering Management The false bottom in a lauter tun has thin () slits to hold back the solids and allow liquids to pass through. The solids, not the false bottom, form a filtration medium and hold back small solids, allowing the otherwise cloudy mash to run out of the lauter tun as a clear liquid. The false bottom of today's lauter tun is made of wedge wire, which can provide a free-flow surface of up to 12% of the bottom of the tun.How is false bottom constructed? The run-off tubes should be evenly distributed across the bottom, with one tube servicing about of area. Typically, these tubes have a wide, shallow cone around them to prevent compaction of the grain directly above the outlet. In the past, the run-off tubes flowed through swan-neck valves into a wort collection grant. While visually appealing, this system led to a lot of oxygen uptake. Such a system has mostly been replaced either by a central wort-collection vessel or the arrangement of outlet ports into concentric zones, with each zone having a ring-shaped collection pipe. Brewhouses in plain public view, particularly those in brewpubs, often maintain the swan- neck valves and grant for their visual effect. A good quality lauter tun has rotating rake arms with a central drive unit. Depending on the size of the lauter tun, there can be between two and six rake arms. Cutting blades hang from these arms. The blade is usually wavy and has a plough-like foot. Each blade has its own path around the tun and the whole rake assembly can be raised and lowered. Attached to each of these arms is a flap which can be raised and lowered for pushing the spent grains out of the tun. The brewer, or better yet an automated system, can raise and lower the rake arms depending on the turbidity (cloudiness) of the run-off, and the tightness of the grain bed, as measured by the pressure difference between the top and bottom of the grain bed. There must be a system for introducing sparge water into the lauter tun. Most systems have a ring of spray heads that ensure an even and gentle introduction of the sparge water. The watering system should not beat down on the grain bed and form a channel. Large breweries have self-closing inlets on the bottom of the tun through which the mash is transferred to the lauter tun, and one outlet, also on the bottom of the tun, into which the spent grains fall after lautering is complete. Craft breweries often have manways on the side of the mash tun for spent grain removal, which then must be helped along to a large extent by the brewer. Some small breweries use a combination mash/lauter tun, in which the rake system cannot be implemented because the mixing mechanism for mashing is of higher importance. The stirring blades can be used as an ersatz rake, but typically they cannot be moved up and down, and would disturb the bed too much were they used deep in the grain bed.

Advertisements for the muffins place emphasis on their \\"nooks and crannies.\\" The company also produces toasting/swirl breads, pitas, and wraps. History The company was founded by Samuel Bath Thomas (1855‚Äì1919). In 1874, he immigrated from England to New York City and after other menial jobs began working in a bakery. By 1880, he had purchased his own bakery at 163 Ninth Avenue, where he featured his namesake muffins which were baked on a griddle, not an oven. The business expanded to 337 West 20th Street (a plaque designates the building as \\"The Muffin House\\"). Thomas died in 1919, and the company, S.B. Thomas, was inherited by his daughter and nephews, and was incorporated. It was later owned by George Weston Bakeries. Some television commercials for the muffins have highlighted Thomas' immigrant story, joking about how disappointed Thomas' fans in England supposedly were when he decided to take his muffins to America. (Whether the muffins were invented after Thomas had moved to the US is unclear, but the comments in the commercials are not intended to be accurate and are used for a humorous purpose.) In 2010, the company won a trade secret suit when an executive uploaded the company's recipes and retired to work for Hostess.

Introduced at the 1987 Frankfurt Auto Show, it was a fully functional, four-door, four-seat sport sedan. Design In 1986, Kevin Verduyn designed a concept car model for Chrysler called the Navajo. The concept never went beyond the clay model stage, but when Chrysler acquired Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1987, the design was resurrected and with some fairly minor tweaks, turned into the Portofino. The Portofino was built by Coggiola of Turin, Italy on a lengthened Jalpa chassis, giving the car a mid-engine rear-wheel drive layout. It also made use of the Jalpa's 3.5 L V8 water-cooled engine and 5-speed manual transmission. The engine could rev to 7,000 rpm, with 64.6 bhp/liter. The most interesting feature of the Portofino was the dual scissor doors, enclosing a pillarless passenger compartment. The front doors pivoted forward, as in Lamborghini's Countach. The rears were also scissor-style, but pivoted upward to the rear. The logo on the hood featured the Lamborghini bull inside the Chrysler Pentastar. While the Portofino was a one of a kind concept and Chrysler ownership of Lamborghini would not survive, the concept's design would inform and influence Chrysler cars for the next two decades. The wide low stance and open plan interior would become the hallmark of the Chrysler LH body vehicles and their \\"cab-forward\\" design standard. The triangular headlights and dual notched rear indicators would find their way directly to the first generation Dodge Intrepid and serve as key design points throughout that vehicle's existence. One Of A Kind Only the single prototype Portofino, chassis #LC0001, was ever produced. In 1991, it was heavily damaged in an accident in transit. However, Chrysler had it restored by Metalcrafters in Costa Mesa, CA for $300,000, and it is now on display at Chrysler headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The Portofino was notable for being an early example of cab forward styling, and many aspects of its design made it into the Chrysler LH platform which initially included the Chrysler Concorde, Dodge Intrepid and Eagle Vision.

Brescia began working in film against his father's wishes, and eventually directed his first film Revolt of the Praetorians in 1964.Curti, Roberto (2013). Italian Crime Filmography, 1968-1980. McFarland. . Brescia worked in several genres in the Italian film industry, including five science fiction films he directed following the release of Star Wars. Brescia's work slowed down towards the late 1980s, and his last film Club Vacanze could not get distribution. Biography Alfonso Brescia was born in Rome on January 6, 1930. Brescia was the son of a film producer and entered the film business against his father's will. His father had him work as a production driver, which involved getting up early to persuade him against entering the business which did not work. He began work as an assistant director as well as working in production offices, eventually directing his first film Revolt of the Praetorians in 1964. Following the release of Star Wars, he shot five science fiction films in a row, Anno zero: guerra nello spazio, Battaglie negli spazi stellari, La guerra dei robot, Sette uomini d'oro nello spazio and The Beast in Space. The Beast in Space was a science fiction pornography film based on Walerian Borowczyk's The Beast. In the 1980s, with the decline of genre cinema, Brescia's output drastically diminished. His final works included Iron Warrior and Miami Cops and Omicidio a luci blu. He directed his last film in 1995, Club Vacanze, which failed to interest a distributor, making it the only film he lost money on. Brescia died in Rome on May 5, 2001. Style Italian film historian Roberto Curti described Brescia as \\"a hack, but a reliable one\\". Curti referred to Brescia as \\"one of the most prolific and versatile Italian filmmakers of the 1970s\\".

It is usually asymptomatic, rarely grows or bleeds, and has no malignant potential. This tumour was once often resected because it was difficult to distinguish from hepatic adenoma, but with modern multiphase imaging is usually now diagnosed by strict imaging criteria and not resected. Presentation Ultrasound of malformed vessels within the fibrous scar of FNH. Liver tumor types by relative incidence in adults in the United States, with focal nodular hyperplasia at right.Table 37.2 in: Focal nodular hyperplasia's most recognizable gross feature is a central stellate scar seen in 60‚Äì70% of cases. Microscopically, a lobular proliferation of bland- appearing hepatocytes with a bile ductular proliferation and malformed vessels within the fibrous scar is the most common pattern. Other patterns include telangiectatic, hyperplastic-adenomatous, and lesions with focal large-cell dysplasia. Rarely, these lesions may be multiple or can occur as part of a syndrome with hemangiomas, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, hepatic adenomas, fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, vascular malformations of the brain, meningiomas, and/or astrocytomas. Pathophysiology FNH is not a true neoplasm; it is believed to result from localized hyperplastic hepatocyte response to an underlying congenital arteriovenous malformation. It consists of normal liver constituents in an abnormally organized pattern, grows in a stellate pattern and may display central necrosis when large. Additionally evidence suggests that the incidence of FNH is related to oral contraceptive use. Diagnosis Unenhanced CT or MRI usually does not show the difference in intensity between the FNH and surrounding liver except when there is marked liver steatosis that reduces the attenuation of the liver, causing FNH to be hyperattenuating when compared with the surrounding liver. In the arterial phase CT or MRI, there is a strong enhancement not followed by washout. The lesion presents a slight hyperintensity or isodensity on portal venous phase or delayed phase images. There is also a presence of a central scar and absence of a capsule for the FNH.

A large population from Baljurashi's locals have been known as academics in the universities and colleges throughout the kingdom. They are famous for their contribution to industrial and commercial firms in Saudi Arabia, especially the national oil firm ARAMCO, where many vice presidents are from Baljurashi. The place is considered to be a tribal city dominated by the Ghamidi tribe, which is one of the large tribes in Saudi Arabia. Ghamid tribe has been known since the time of the Islamic Nabƒ´ (, Prophet) Muhammad, and many were mu·∏•addith≈´n (, narrators or transmitters) to his sayings. \\"A major summer resort located on Sarah Mountains and one of the most beautiful southern cities on the road linking Taif with Abha.

This first book revolves around Axis, Battleaxe of the Axe-Wielders, and Faraday, daughter of Earl Isend of Skarabost. Their lives are forever changed by a prophecy, and by meeting each other. Plot introduction The first characters introduced are two unnamed women in mortal peril, one who is pregnant and one who has just given birth. The pregnant one is trying desperately to reach shelter during a snowstorm. She is an outcast of her people, the Avar because she has decided to carry her child, conceived during a festival and considered an abomination, to term. A group of demonic creatures, skraelings, watch as her unborn child brutally eats his way out of her womb, killing her. The monsters are delighted and decide to adopt the hateful child. The second woman had given birth to an illegitimate child two days before, who she believes is dead. The child was illegitimate, and she is of high-born, perhaps noble, birth. After giving birth, she is taken and dumped in the freezing cold mountains to die. Plot summary The land of Achar has prospered for centuries under the care of the one god, Artor the Ploughman. Now, however, disturbing rumors have reached the ears of Jayme, Brother-Leader of the Seneschal, head of the worship of Artor. Evidence suggests that the Forbidden, who were driven out of Achar long ago, have returned. Jayme is relieved to find that Axis, the leader of the Axe-Wielders, an elite force under the command of the Seneschal, has returned from his latest assignment. Others are not as welcoming, because Axis is the illegitimate son of the Princess Rivkah, sister of King Priam. Rivkah is thought to have died while giving birth to Axis, and he has been a thorn in the King's side ever since. Meanwhile, Faraday, the beautiful daughter of Earl Isend, is also at court for the King's nameday celebration. The Earl manages to get a betrothal for her to Borneheld, Rivkah's legitimate son and Priam's likely heir. Unfortunately, Faraday is far more interested in Borneheld's half-brother, Axis. Axis embarks on an assignment to support the towns that may be facing the Forbidden. Faraday rides with him, but she is separated from Axis along the journey. Faraday and her companions now travel to Gorkenfort, where her betrothed lives. She is unsettled by ideas and people she encounters, both along the way and by her husband's side. Though in love with Axis, she is told that it is vital to the future that she marry Borneheld. Even more confusing, she seems to have some kind of relationship with the forest, which all Artor-fearing Acharites hate. As Axis continues his journey, he begins to encounter strange things that call into question everything he has devoutly believed all his life. In Smyrton, he meets two of the Forbidden who have been cruelly treated by the villagers. Touched by pity, he sings to the little girl, who is near death, and mysteriously saves her life. Even more disturbing than this, he is told that his fate is intertwined with a prophecy about a world in which the human and the Forbidden live side by side, and that he may be the one to defeat Gorgrael, who is mounting a campaign to take over Achar.

It is a left-oriented media, promoting social-democracy and European integrations. It is a vocal media supporter of Serbian NGO activities towards human rights and minorities protection. History The first issue of Danas appeared on 9 June 1997. It was established in 1997 after a group of discontented journalists from the Na≈°a borba newspaper walked out after getting into a conflict with the paper's new private majority owner. Right from the start the paper employed a strong independent editorial policy with respect to Milo≈°eviƒá's regime. Because of open reporting and uncensored coverage on issues and events plaguing Yugoslav and Serbian society in the late 1990s, the paper often found itself targeted by Serbian authorities. Danas was one of the three newspapers (Dnevni telegraf and Na≈°a borba being the other two) to be banned by governmental decree on 14 October 1998 for \\"spreading fear and defeatism\\" at a time when NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia seemed a distinct possibility. As the threat of bombing went away (for a few months anyway), the ban was lifted on 20 October 1998, only to be replaced by a piece of legislation called the Information Law. Under that law, Danas was fined severely and on numerous occasions. The paper's day-to- day operations were often under threat of shutting down until the regime was finally overthrown on 5 October 2000. In the period since the regime change, Danas has been one of the rare Serbian newspapers (or Serbian media outlets in general, for that matter) to ignore the commercial temptations of yellow journalism. Its circulation has been continually in decline. Most of the foreign investors in Serbian media market have been avoiding it.

Overview The .460 S&W; round is a lengthened, more powerful version of the popular .454 Casull, itself a longer and more powerful version of the .45 Colt. For this reason, the .460 S&W; Magnum could be considered an example of a \\"super magnum\\". Consequently, firearms that fire .460 S&W; are usually capable of firing the less powerful .454 Casull, .45 Colt, and .45 Schofield rounds, but this must be verified with each firearm's manufacturer. For instance, some lever-action firearms are designed to handle cartridges within a certain length and bullet profile range. The reverse, however, does not apply: .45 Schofield, .45 Colt, and .454 Casull handguns generally cannot safely fire .460 S&W; rounds ‚Äî nor can they even chamber the .460 S&W; because of the longer case length. It is also the most versatile big bore revolver being able to fire four standardized cartridges, as well as lesser known rimmed and straightwall cartridges of .45 caliber that predate the .45 Colt. The .460 Smith and Wesson Magnum is built to handle both long-range hunting and Dangerous Game hunting and defensive performance. Performance Smith & Wesson says that the .460 S&W; is the highest velocity revolver cartridge in the world, firing bullets at up to . The .460 cartridge achieves high velocities by operating at chamber pressures (65,000 psi max) normally reserved for magnum rifle cartridges. The recoil when shooting .45 Colt ammunition out of the S&W; .460 firearm is comparable to recoil from a 9mm or .380 load, due to the weight of the gun and lower chamber pressures. Since firearms chambered in .460 S&W; magnum can also fire cartridges of dissimilar trajectories, such as .45 Colt, S&W; provides an extra additional rear sight with the gun to compensate for bullet drop down range, depending on the user's load and shooting applications.

An experience modifier of 1 would be applied for an employer that had demonstrated the actuarially expected performance. Poorer loss experience leads to a modifier greater than 1, and better experience to a modifier less than 1. The loss experience used in determining the modifier typically comprises three years but excluding the immediate past year. For instance, if a policy expired on January 1, 2018, the period reflected by the experience modifier would run from January 1, 2014 to January 1, 2017. Methods of calculation Experience modifiers are normally recalculated for an employer annually by using experience ratings. The rating is a method used by insurers to determine pricing of premiums for different groups or individuals based on the group or individual's history of claims. The experience rating approach uses an individual's or group‚Äôs historic data as a proxy for future risk, and insurers adjust and set insurance premiums and plans accordingly. Each year, a newer year's data is added to the three year window of experience used in the calculation, and the oldest year from the prior calculation is dropped off. The other two years worth of data in the rating window are also updated on an annual basis. Experience modifiers are calculated by organizations known as \\"rating bureaus\\" and rely on information reported by insurance companies. The rating bureau used by most states is the NCCI, the National Council on Compensation Insurance. But a number of states have independent rating bureaus: California, Michigan, Delaware, and Pennsylvania have stand-alone rating bureaus that do not integrate data with NCCI. Other states such as Wisconsin, Texas, New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and North Carolina, maintain their own rating bureaus but integrate with NCCI for multi-state employers.Ultimate Guide to Workers' Compensation Insurance, Edward J. Priz, 2005, Entrepreneur Press, P. 81 The experience modifier adjusts workers compensation insurance premiums for a particular employer based on a comparison of past losses of that employer to what is calculated to be \\"average\\" losses of other employers in that state in the same business, adjusted for size. To do this, experience modifier calculations use loss information reported in by an employer's past insurers. This is compared to a calculation of expected losses for a company in that line of work, in that particular state, and adjusted for the size of the employer. The calculation of expected losses utilizes past audited payroll information for a particular employer, by classification code and state. These payrolls are multiplied by Expected Loss Rates, which are calculated by rating bureaus based on past reported claims costs per classification. Errors in experience modifiers can occur if inaccurate information is reported to a rating bureau by a past insurer of an employer. Some states (Illinois and Tennessee) prohibit increases in experience modifiers once a workers compensation policy begins, even if the higher modifier has been correctly calculated under the rules. Most states allow increases in experience modifiers if done relatively early in the term of the workers compensation insurance policy, and most states prohibit increases in experience modifier late in the term of the policy. The detailed rules governing calculation of experience modifiers are developed by the various rating bureaus. Although all states use similar methodology, there can be differences in details in the formulas used by independent rating bureaus and the NCCI. In many NCCI states, the Experience Rating Adjustment plan is in place, allowing for the 70% reduction in the reportable amount of medical-only claims. That is, for claims where there has been no payment to the worker for lost time, but only for medical expenses. This gives employers an incentive to report all claims to their insurers, rather than trying to pay for medical-only claims out of pocket. Discounting medical-only claims in the experience modifier calculation greatly reduces the impact of medical-only claims on the modifier. Formula and calculations The formula primarily used by the NCCI is the following. \\\\frac{I+(C*(1-A)+G)+(A*F)}{E+(C*(1-A)+G)+(A*C)} A = Weight Factor G = Ballast I = Actual Primary Losses H = Actual Incurred Losses F = Actual Excess Losses (H-I) E = Expected Primary Losses D = Expected Incurred Loses C = Expected Excess Losses (D-E) The formula is broken down into 3 main categories or subsections for understanding. # Primary Losses #* Primary losses show up as both I and E in the above formula, E is for \\"Expected\\" primary losses vs actual. This expected value is determined based on a company's payroll cost with a little actuarial calculations. #* I #* E # Stabilizing Value #* This is a calculation based on expected excess losses, a weighting factor, and a Ballast factor. #* The weighting factor and Ballast factor are determined from proprietary calculations that are not published publicly. #* (C*(1-A)+G) # Ratable Excess #* Using the weighting factor the Ratable excess is simply the excess losses times this factor. #*(A*F) #*(A*C) These 3 categories are summed up, with Actual numbers divided by Expected numbers, notice that the Stabilizing value does not change between the numerator and denominator. \\\\frac{ActualPrimaryLosses + StabilizingValue + ActualRatableExcess}{ExpectedPrimaryLosses + StabilizingValue + ExpectedRatableExcess} = A note about losses = In the EMR calculation there are 4 fundamental losses that are necessary for the calculation, they are: # D = Expected Incurred Losses # E = Expected Primary Losses # H = Actual Incurred Losses #* Claims under $2,000. # I = Actual Primary Losses #* All claims including Actual Incurred Losses The losses that are not part of this fundamental 4 are, # C = Expected Excess Losses #* (D-E) # F = Actual Excess Losses #* (H-I) Examples Unemployment insurance is experience rated in the United States; companies that have more claims resulting from past workers face higher unemployment insurance rates. The logic of this approach is that these are the companies that are more likely to cause someone to be unemployed, so they should pay more into the pool from which unemployment compensation is paid. Unemployment insurance is financed by a payroll tax paid by employers. Experience rating in unemployment insurance is described as imperfect, due in large part to the fact that there are statutory maximum and minimum rates that an employer can receive without regard to its history of lay-off. If a worker is laid off, generally the increased costs to the employer due to the higher value of unemployment insurance tax rates are less than the UI benefits received by the worker.

There are twenty-three appointees in all, including parliamentary secretaries of each parliamentary group. As one of six Organs of the Bundestag, the Council of Elders (under the Rules of Procedure) is tasked with managing the internal affairs of the Bundestag. It is the entity which determines daily legislative agenda items and assigning committee chairpersons based on party representation. The council also serves as an important forum for interparty negotiations on specific legislation and procedural issues. Mechanics The Council of Elders performs two functions: # Assist the President in the conduct of business and ensure the parliamentary groups reach an agreement; # Making decisions on the internal affairs of the Bundestag, provides such activities are without the exclusive competence of the President. At the beginning of each electoral term, the Council is to reach agreement on the distribution of committee (and deputy) chairs among parliamentary groups. The number, size of committees, as well as the system used to determine their composition, which is proportional to the relative strengths of the parliamentary groups, are decided ultimately by the Bundestag. As a rule, the Council's decisions are based on agreements reached among all the parliamentary groups in the House (cross-party agreements). While the parliament is in session, the Council of Elders convene weekly at meetings chaired by the President of the Bundestag. A minister of state at the Federal Chancellery or some other representative of the Federal Government is usually in attendance at these meetings. Chair distribution Until 1970, the relative strengths of the parliamentary groups were calculated using a process that favoured larger parties. This process, known as the d'Hondt method, was also used to calculate the outcome of federal elections until the Bundestag's tenth term in 1983. Since then, a system that aims to ensure parity for minority parties has been adopted. In the ninth electoral term (1980), this system was refined by applying the Sainte-Lagu√´ method (or Schepers method.) Using this method, the total number of Members of the Bundestag is divided by the number of members of each parliamentary group; the resulting number is then multiplied progressively by 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and so on. These newer calculations produce rank order numbers according to which the seats are then distributed: the first seat is allocated to the parliamentary group with the lowest rank order number, the second seat to the one with the next lowest rank order number, and so on.

It was first published in 2004. It is the first of the Norumbegan Quartet which continues in The Suburb beyond the Stars (2010) and The Empire of Gut and Bone (2011).  Plot summary  The book follows the story of two boys in their teen years, named Brian and Gregory (who are friends, but complete opposites) who visit a mansion in Vermont owned by Gregory's Uncle Max. Uncle Max is a strange and weird character who uses complicated words from the past such as \\"effluents\\" and \\"insalubrities\\" and acts very much like an Edwardian-era aristocrat. The two boys uncover the board of the Game of Sunken Places in the nursery and unintentionally set the game into motion. They also meet Gregory's cousin Prudance, a girl from the area. Thus they become involved in an age-old ritual conflict between enchanted supernatural races. Once they go out into the woods and begin playing the game, they meet unlikely allies such as Kalgrash the troll and work together to accomplish all the challenges using the game board as a map. In the final challenge, Gregory is about to win and Brian is being strangled by Jack Stimple. By believing that Jack was their opponent, the two almost fell into his trap. Jack was not playing the game at all. Gregory was the player for the Thusser Hordes and was about to win when Brian stopped him. Jack Stimple was meanwhile being dragged away by monks for strangling Brian. Gregory trusts Brian, and lets him win the game and so another battle had been won in the name of the Norumbegans. Prudance is the one who actually came up with the idea of The Game in the first place.

This modest profit, coupled with a fast turnover of inventory, caused Grant's business to grow to almost $100 million in annual sales by 1936, the same year that he started the William T. Grant Foundation. The stores were generally of the dime store format located in downtowns. Among his avocations were philosophy, painting, and local philanthropy. In his later years, Grant was Chairman of the Board of the W. T. Grant Company and President of the Grant Foundation, and later Chairman of the Board. He received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from Bates College in Maine and the University of Miami. He retired from both the W. T.

Car collections Less well known is the fact, that Dovaz was the owner of a collection of 50+ unrestored oldtimers, which he stored on his estate south of Paris up to 1984. The collection consisted of prewar and postwar cars of the most luxurious brands (nine Bugatti, nine Lancia, four Alfa Romeo, four Lincoln, two Ferrari, two Lotus, two Rolls Royce, two Bentley...). The collection became famous when a German photographer was allowed to take photos of the neglected cars in 1983 in the savaged garden south of Paris. Most of the cars have been sold since then and many have been restored, but some are still asleep. Two books have been written about the Dovaz car collection. The first was 'Sleeping Beauties' (1986/2007/2013) which showed the collection in its dilapidated 'as found' state. The book brought unwanted attention to the Dovaz collection.

This class of relays provided manufacturing and operating advantages over previous designs. Wire spring relays entered mass production in the early 1950s. Arthur C. Keller, A New General Purpose Relay for Telephone Switching Systems, Bell System Technical Journal, v.31(6), 1023 (November 1952) A.L. Quinlan, Automatic Contact Welding in Wire Spring Relay Manufacture, Bell System Technical Journal, v.33(4), 897 (July 1954) Wire spring relays were the most suitable relays for logic and computing functions. They were used extensively in markers, which were special purpose computers used to route calls in crossbar switch central offices. Wire spring relays were primarily manufactured by the Western Electric Company for use in electromechanical telephone exchanges in the Bell System. The design was licensed for use around the world, and was commonplace in Japan. Manufacturing of wire spring relays greatly declined in the late 20th century due to the introduction of digital electronic switching systems that used them in very small numbers. A pair of wire spring relays in one frame, called a \\"split relay\\" Description A relay has two major parts, the electromagnet and the contacts. The electromagnet may have a resistance between 15 and 200 ohms, and is often designed to operate satisfactorily at a common telephony voltage, such as 24 or 48 volts. The electromagnet can also be modified by the insertion of metallic slugs (lumps) to create a brief delay before pulling in the contacts (slow operate), or hold the contacts in place briefly after power is removed (slow release). A wire spring relay typically has many individual contacts. Each contact is either a fixed contact, which does not move, or is a moving contact, and is made from a short piece of wire. The contact points are made from small blocks of precious metals, such as palladium, which are spot-welded to the wire springs. The majority of the wire spring relays manufactured in the 1960s had twelve fixed contacts. A normally open (make) contact, a normally closed (break) contact, or both can be provided for each fixed contact. A moving contact consists of two wires projecting out of the base of the relay, bent slightly inwards in order to exert pressure against the armature. The moving contacts are held away from the fixed contacts by a phenolic paper pattern called a \\"card\\". By changing the depth of the cuts on this form, the contacts can be made to make or break earlier or later than others. This can be used to transfer electrical control or power from one source to another by having a \\"make\\" contact operate before the corresponding \\"break\\" contact does. For the stored program control exchanges of the early 1970s, many relays were made with steel cores that remained magnetized after current ceased to flow in the winding. A. Feiner, The Ferreed, Bell System Technical Journal, v.43(1), 1 (January 1964) This magnetic latching feature, different from the use of slugs to delay relay operation, was used in the arrays of reed relays that switched connection paths in the early models of electronic switching systems. A miniature wire spring relay was also produced, starting in approximately 1974 as part of the 1A redesign of the 1ESS switch. Use in logic Wire spring relays could be interconnected to create the typical combinational circuits that were later used in silicon design. The contacts of one or more relays can be used to drive the coil of another relay. To make an OR gate for example, the contacts of several input relays may be placed in parallel circuits and used to drive the electromagnet of a third relay. This, along with series circuits and more complicated schemes such as multiply wound electromagnets, allows the creation of AND gates, OR gates and Inverters (using the normally closed contact on a relay). Using these simple circuits in combination with De Morgan's Laws, any combinational function can be created using relays. When output wires are fed back as inputs, the result is a feedback loop or sequential circuit that has the potential to consider its own history. Such circuits are often suitable as memories. Use as memory Memory circuits in the form of latches can also be created by having a relay contact complete the circuit of its own coil when operated. The relay will then latch and store the state to which it was driven. With this capability, relays were used to create special purpose computers for telephone switches in the 1930s. Starting in the 1950s, these designs were converted to wire spring relays, making them faster and more reliable. The majority of wire spring relays were used in 5XB switches. Most wire spring relays have a permalloy core, and require continuous power to maintain state. Some have a steel core, making them magnetically latching relays, similar to the ferreed and remreed types of reed relay. Reed relays are smaller and cheaper, thus better suited to data storage. They were used in conjunction with wire spring relays, for example to store digits for sending to other crossbar switching offices. In a multi-frequency sender (the part of a switch which sends routing information about outgoing calls over trunk lines), for example, wire spring relays direct the dialed digits one at a time from reed relay packs to frequency generators, under sequential control of logic implemented with wire spring relays. At the other end, similar relays steered the incoming digits from the tone decoder to a reed relay memory. In such uses, two-out-of-five codes and similar schemes checked for errors at both ends. Use in carrier systems Wire spring relays were also incorporated into the signaling channel units of carrier systems.

The adult mites are about 0.385 millimeters long, have eight legs with combs instead of claws, and have palpi that end in prominent hooks. They do not burrow into the skin, but live in the keratin level. Their entire 21-day life cycle is on one host. They cannot survive off the host for more than 10 days. Cheyletiellosis Cheyletiellosis (also known as Cheyletiella dermatitis),\\"Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . is a mild dermatitis caused by mites of the genus Cheyletiella. It is also known as walking dandruff due to skin scales being carried by the mites. Cheyletiellosis is seen more commonly in areas where fleas are less prevalent, because of the decreased use of flea products that are also efficacious for the treatment of this mite. Cheyletiellosis is highly contagious. Transmission is by direct contact with an affected animal. =Presentation= Symptoms in animals vary from no signs to intense itching, scales on the skin, and hair loss. The lesions are usually on the back of the animal. Symptoms in humans include multiple red, itchy bumps on the arms, trunk, and buttocks. Because humans are not a host for the mite, the symptoms usually go away in about three weeks. Though the medical community does not consider a human mite infestation a legitimate diagnosis, it will treat the symptoms if necessary. =Diagnosis= Diagnosis is by finding the mites or eggs microscopically in a skin scraping, combing, or on duct or packing tape applied to the skin. =Treatment= The most common treatment in animals is weekly use of some form of topical pesticide appropriate for the affected animal, often an antiflea product. Fipronil works well, especially in cats. Cats can also be treated with a lime sulfur insecticide dip or a shampoo with non-pyrethrin insecticide for two weeks beyond the conclusion of symptoms. In unresponsive cases, ivermectin is used. Selamectin is also recommended for treatment. None of these products are approved for treatment of cheyletiellosis. Other pets in the same household should also be treated, and the house or kennel must be treated with an environmental flea spray.

It is the fourth installment in the Killzone series, the first game in the series to be presented in stereoscopic 3D, and the first to include motion controls using the PlayStation Move. It is a direct sequel to Killzone 2. It was released worldwide in February 2011 to positive reviews. Plot In the climax of Killzone 2, Emperor Scolar Visari is assassinated by ISA forces, triggering a full-scale attack by the Helghan First Army. Overwhelmed, ISA commanders order a full withdrawal, leaving thousands of their own soldiers to die on Helghan. With the Helghast now driven to seek revenge for Visari's death, the survivors must join forces to find a way home. =Story= After failing to save Visari's life, Sgt. Tomas Sevchenko and Rico Velasquez regroup with Captain Jason Narville outside the imperial palace. With Helghan cruisers preparing to attack their fleet, they are forced to fight their way through the ruins of Pyrrhus, sacrificing most of their remaining armor and manpower in order to reach an extraction point near the edge of the city. Admiral Orlock, commander of the First Army, is pressured by Jorhan Stahl, the chairman of arms manufacturer Stahl Arms, to either ensure the total destruction of the ISA or turn over control of the army to him. Meanwhile, Rico receives a transmission from Jammer, a sniper whose platoon has been cut off by the Helghast. Against Narville's orders, he goes to assist them. The rest of the force attempts to link up with the fleet, but enemy interference leads to several ships being shot down, forcing the remainder to leave without Narville's men. Six months later, Stahl calls for a vote in the Helghan Imperial Senate to remove Orlock for incompetence, but his request is denied. Furious, Stahl ends his company's cooperation with the First Army and organizes his personal guard to hunt down the ISA, who have set up a base in a remote jungle near one of their destroyed cruisers. While working to restore the base's communication uplink, the soldiers learn that the UCN has agreed to a ceasefire with the Helghast, effectively abandoning them. The transmission is intercepted by Stahl's men, who subsequently attack the camp and kill everyone aside from Tomas and Narville, who are taken captive. Rico and Jammer's platoon, now calling themselves the Raiders, ambush the convoy and free Tomas. They carry out several attacks against Helghan facilities in the area, eventually reaching the main campus of Stahl Arms. Learning that Stahl plans to publicly execute Narville, Tomas and Rico don Helghast uniforms and rescue him and his fellow prisoners. Accessing the company's mainframe, they discover that Stahl has built his own armada armed with weapons powered by irradiated Petrusite, powerful enough to tear living organisms apart. Believing himself to be Visari's rightful successor, Stahl intends to win the favor of Helghan by conquering Earth itself. Fed up with Stahl's arrogance, the senate grants Orlock the title of Autarch, giving him Visari's throne instead. Stahl is ordered to surrender his ships to the First Army's fleet above Helghan so they may be used to attack Earth. The ISA comes under attack from a massive Helghan assault mech, and though they manage to defeat it, their numbers are reduced to just 60 men. Nevertheless, they deactivate the perimeter defenses around Pyrrhus's spaceport, allowing them to access the imperial orbit command center. Aware of Orlock's plans to murder him after securing his weapons, Stahl double-crosses and kills him before launching an attack on the First Army, giving the ISA a desperately needed opening to steal several Helghast transports. Stahl orders his flagship to warp to Earth, but Tomas manages to destroy its warp coil, causing the ship to plummet towards Helghan's surface. A direct nuclear strike ordered by Narville obliterates the vessel, causing it to drop its Petrusite arsenal on Helghan. The resulting fallout destroys what remains of the Helghast, leading Tomas to comment on how many innocent lives must have perished as a result of their actions. With the war over, the last of the ISA returns to Vekta. Around the same time, two Helghast soldiers recover an escape pod from Stahl's ship. Though the occupant's identity is not revealed, it is implied that Stahl is still alive, which is confirmed by the sequel. =Characters= *Andrew Bowen as Sergeant Tomas 'Sev' Sevchenko. The main protagonist, Sev, along with Rico and Narville, lead the resistance against the Helghans. *Charles Everett as Sergeant Ricardo 'Rico' Velasquez. Rico, along with Sev and Narville, helps lead the resistance against the Helghans and forms his own squad with Jammer, the Raiders, while stranded for six months on Helghan after being separated from Sev and the other ISA forces. *James Remar as Captain Jason Narville. Captain of the stranded ISA forces on Helghan. *Brian Cox as Scolar Visari. The dead Autarch of Helghan. Though absent in the game, he is seen and speaks during the intro (as in every game) in a scene which occurred before the nuclear explosion during Killzone 2. *Ray Winstone as Admiral Orlock. One of the two main antagonist, Orlock is the hot-tempered and strict commander in chief of the Helghan military and soon becomes its autarch. *Malcolm McDowell as Jorhan Brimve Stahl. One of the two main antagonists, Stahl is the CEO of Stahl Arms, a weapons company, he seeks to become Helghans new autarch as he believes Orlock is a nothing more than a miserable excuse of an officer. He also holds little respect for the Helghan military as he looks at the soldiers as \\"fat\\", \\"lazy\\" and \\"careless\\" oafs among other qualities. *La'Myia Good as Jammer. A resourceful female ISA soldier. *Mac Brandt as Kowalski. An ISA soldier who helps Sev through the Kaznan Jungle. *Mark Engelhardt as Hooper. A rookie ISA soldier who helps in take down Stahls cruiser before the nuke is dropped on it. *Rob Brownstein as Bradshaw Gameplay A screenshot showing the new Arctic environments of the game. The gameplay strongly resembles that of Killzone 2 albeit with several tweaks and changes. Similar to the first Killzone, the game takes place in various harsh environments such as Arctic landscapes, a lethal alien jungle, nuclear wastelands as well as space battles rather than only the city-scape environments which were present in Killzone 2. Another notable new feature is the ability to use jet packs in the game, which were also used in Killzone: Liberation. The game also features a revamped close combat melee system (called Brutal Melee) which includes new brutal melee attacks as well as the ability to string together multiple attacks in a combo. A new weapon called the WASP has also been added, which acts as a multi-firing rocket launcher firing in spiral formation. =Multiplayer= Online multiplayer of Killzone 3 supports three different game modes: Guerilla Warfare, Warzone, and Operations. \\"Guerilla Warfare\\" is a classic team death match style game that supports up to 16 players per map for each map that supports this mode. \\"Warzone\\", returning from Killzone 2's multiplayer, is an objective based game (seven objectives: \\"Body Count\\", \\"Capture and Hold\\", \\"Search and Retrieve\\", and two rounds of \\"Assassination\\" and \\"Search and Destroy\\" respectively) that supports up to 24 players per map for each map that supports this mode. What sets \\"Warzone\\" apart from other games in the genre is the way that each objective is used. Rather than having each game type be its own separate mode, the objectives cycle randomly during the course of gameplay without ever interrupting the match. Each game type comes up with a timer, and when the timer ends or the objective is completed the winning team is awarded that \\"round\\" and the match continues until all 7 rounds have been completed. Each warzone match is decided in a \\"best of 7\\" manner and since players continue to play and fight for control of strategic points on the map, there is a substantial continuous metagame of territory control present throughout every match. This is exemplified further by the addition of \\"Tactical Spawn Areas\\" in Killzone 3 (a change from the spawn grenades of Killzone 2) where certain spawn locations need to be fought over and are better for some of the objectives than they are for others so a teams tacticians must decide which ones are needed for the current objective, as well as weighing the possibility of what future objectives may come up and the risk involved with capturing and maintaining them. \\"Operations\\" is a new game mode that features cinematic scenes and supports up to 16 players per map for each map that supports this mode. In Operations, the ISA and the Helghast battle for control of specific objectives ‚Äì the ISA on the offensive and the Helghast on defense. The best players are featured throughout the match in cutscenes depicting their successes. Killzone 3 also supports offline split- screen co-operation for two players, which allows two players using the same console to play the campaign of Killzone 3 offline. This is a feature not present in Killzone 2. This is the only mode that supports offline split- screen multiplayer in Killzone 3. There is also an offline multiplayer mode named 'BotZone' in which players can play against computer bots. There are a total of eight multiplayer maps on the disk, including Corinth Highway, Pyrrhus Crater, Bilgarsk Boulevard, Turbine Concourse SE-6, Frozen Dam, Akmir Snowdrift, Mawlr Graveyard, and Kaznan Jungle. Guerilla Warfare mode is supported on the Pyrrhus Crater, Bilgarsk Boulevard, Frozen Dam, Akmir Snowdrift, and Kaznan Jungle maps. Warzone mode is supported on all maps except the Kaznan Jungle map. Operations mode is supported on the Frozen Dam, Akmir Snowdrift, and Mawlr Graveyard maps. A new feature to Killzone multiplayer for Killzone 3 is the ability to use vehicle-like mechanisms: the jet packs and Exos (each available on one game disc map respectively). The jet packs are exclusive to the Turbine Concourse SE-6 map while the Exos, as well as the WASP rocket launcher created by the Engineer, are only available on the Corinth Highway map. Another new feature is the ability to use Mortar Beacons, which can be used if a Tactician captures a tactical spawn point from which the Mortar Beacons are found. Mortar Beacons are featured on the Corinth Highway, Pyrrhus Crater, Bilgarsk Boulevard, Frozen Dam, and Mawlr Graveyard maps. Miniguns can be created by the Engineer on the Pyrrhus Crater, Bilgarsk Boulevard, and Turbine Concourse SE-6 maps. A snowstorm is featured on the Akmir Snowdrift map and a crusher (which the player can control) is featured in the Mawlr Graveyard. There are a total of five classes for players to choose from: Marksman, Engineer, Field Medic, Tactician, and Infiltrator. Each class has his own special abilities and weapons, such as disguise for the Infiltrator or cloaking for the Marksman. Unlike Killzone 2, players may choose any class from the start, however, they must earn Unlock Points to upgrade the abilities and to gain more weapons for each class (Unlock Points are awarded by ranking up). Each class's abilities can be upgraded twice, and they can unlock two additional primary weapons, one or two additional secondary weapons, and/or one heavy weapon (e.g. rocket launcher) depending on class. Other abilities, such as armor or silent footsteps, are earned based on obtaining a certain rank in multiplayer and can be used on any class. Ribbons (e.g. Faster Reload, Faster Aim, Double XP, etc.) are earned in-game based upon a certain achievement required by the ribbon and only apply to that particular match and must be re-earned each match. The points system has also been updated where one kill equals 100 points, as opposed to one kill equaling 1 point in Killzone 2. Other updates to the points system include Assist kills (25 points), destroying Bots (50 points), Explosive kills (150 points), objective based points (e.g. 600 points for completely assassinating the assassination target in Assassination), Double and Triple kills and kill streaks (3, 5, 10, etc.). Players can purchase a standalone version of Killzone 3s multiplayer from the PlayStation Store which includes all online multiplayer game modes, all original maps, and all DLC maps, as well as BotZone. The online servers for the game were closed down on the 29th of March 2018.https://www.guerrilla-games.com/read/killzone-2-and-3-servers-to-be- decommissioned Development The game was unveiled by Sony Computer Entertainment on May 24, 2010 through the PlayStation.Blog. The game was leaked on May 21, 2010 through an early release copy of the June issue of gaming magazine GamePro alongside a leaked screenshot. Rumors about a new entry in the Killzone series have been around shortly after the release of Killzone 2.Official PlayStation Magazine Australia Issue 03 January 2010 pg 12 On March 20, 2010 that Sony confirmed that they were working on Killzone 3. President of Sony Computer Entertainment America, Jack Tretton, confirmed its development in an interview with GameTrailers, but at that point of time could not yet say when the game would be announced. Guerrilla's managing director, Herman Hulst, has stated Killzone 3 would use close to 100% of the PlayStation 3's power. The rumors of the intervention of Naughty Dog in the development were denied by Guerrilla: \\"Guerrilla is working on Killzone 3s graphics engine all on its own, confirming Naughty Dog has no hand in its development\\". The first teaser trailer for the game was released on June 3, 2010 and features the new brutal melee combat system. The cinematic trailer shows Sev battling a Helghast ending with him taking the Helghast's helmet and putting it on himself. The single player demo reveals that this is part of the game as Sev and Rico dress as Helghast to infiltrate a Helghast facility at Stahl Arms. On June 11, 2010 on Killzone.com and the U.S. PlayStation Blog, Guerrilla Games released a pre-E3 gameplay video. Guerrilla said the gameplay video is made of gameplay footage from the game's fourth mission called \\"Frozen Shores\\". At E3 2010, it was confirmed that Killzone 3 would support the PlayStation Move and would be released in February 2011. A pre-alpha code gameplay video was also shown at E3 in 3D; a special screen was lowered and the audience had 3D glasses available to them. The E3 gameplay video featured the jet packs as well as the player riding on a craft using a turret. Guerrilla Games game director, Mathijs de Jonge, has been chatting about the merits of swearing in games, and with Killzone 3 he feels the studio have got just the right amount. \\"In Killzone 2 we ended up with too much of it, Killzone 3 swearing 'a lot more impactful'.\\" he told Edge. Tommy de Roos, principal programmer at Guerrilla Games, who headed development for Move with Killzone 3, has said that he thinks \\"Most [first-person shooter] games will be played with motion control in a few years.\\" Killzone 3 takes up a full dual-layer Blu-ray disc. This is due to the duplication of level texture files for faster disc streaming and also the presence of video files in multiple languages. According to Guerilla Games, Killzone 3s story is more light-hearted compared to its predecessor, which Guerrilla felt suffered from an overly serious and dark story which was one of the major complaints of the original, though they mentioned that it would not be too light-hearted as it is still a war. In addition, Guerrilla Games hired an external writer to focus on only writing the storyline so as to give a fresh perspective to the story as well as hiring a lot more Hollywood actors to elevate the level of storytelling within the dialogue of the game (such as Malcolm McDowell voicing Jorhan Stahl and Ray Winstone voicing Admiral Orlock). Guerrilla Games stated that the game's story would be an integral part of the game with dialogue and character development being greatly improved from its predecessor. In addition, Guerrilla Games stated that they are curtailing the swearing in Killzone 3, which many felt was unnecessary in the dialogue of Killzone 2. They mentioned that the dialogue in the game should be focused on advancing the story rather than \\"gratuitous\\" swearing. =Beta= The Killzone 3 Multiplayer Closed Beta began on October 12, 2010 for select participants of the Killzone community.

In alpha version, 3D sacrificed things like sharpness, speed, a feeling of orientation and a lot more aliasing. Jagged edges as well as some ghosting of interface elements are reported to occur. At E3 2010, it was revealed that Killzone 3 was built with 3D support from the ground up.

According to the PlayStation.Blog post, \\"the author delved deep into the game's story to answer... questions\\" about the game, such as what drives Sev and Rico's actions. Reception Killzone 3 received positive reviews and has a GameRankings score of 86.38% based on 63 reviews, and a score of 84 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 85 reviews. The first English review of the game was published by PlayStation Official Magazine (UK), which gave the game a 9/10. The review stated \\"on a visual level, as a 3D breakthrough, this feels like a watershed moment in a revolution affecting all of gaming\\". The review also stated on gameplay terms, \\"Black Ops is the only [first-person shooter] on PlayStation 3 that can match this\\". The voice acting, however, was criticised as not being perfect, thus lacking \\"emotive punch\\" and the reason for not receiving a perfect 10/10. IGN gave the game an 8.5, praising the atmosphere, graphics and multiplayer. Destructoid gave the game a perfect 10/10, with reviewer Jim Sterling stating: \\"I don't think the PlayStation 3 has ever had quite such a rounded, satisfactory package as this, with this level of polish, refinement and pure, simple, unpretentious action.\\" PlayStation Lifestyle awarded it a 10/10 as well, calling the game \\"the ultimate ending to a new form of sci-fi epic.\\" GamesTM was generally positive and gave the game 7/10, although was critical over the storyline and when comparing it to Killzone 2 said the game \\"...takes inexplicable backward steps in almost every department.\\" Game Informer, who scored the game a 9/10, however praised the story saying \\"[Killzone 3's] shocking and abrupt campaign ending serves as a suitable wrap to Guerilla's extended war-themed trilogy. Even if it is a conclusion of sorts, Killzone 3 stands on its own.\\" They also praised its intuitive use of the PlayStation Move as an optional controller. Sequel Before Killzone 3s release, Guerrilla Games already had a \\"lot of ideas\\" for the next installment. In an interview with PlayStation Official Magazine (UK), Mathijs de Jonge said: \\"We're looking at new projects, there's a lot of ideas already floating around the company to put in a new Killzone.\\" On November 18, 2011, Edge reported that Guerrilla Games is making a new Killzone game. Killzone 2 and 3 senior producer Steven Ter Heide is reportedly game director. Guerrilla studio recruiter Adrian Smith is quoted as saying \\"we've got to continue the Killzone franchise.\\" Earlier in the week Edge reported that one of Sony's studios had stopped PlayStation 3 development and moved onto its successor. The unnamed developer is also apparently involved in building the graphics technology for Sony's next system. Alongside Killzone, the studio is also working on a new IP, Edge reported, led by former Killzone game director Mathijs de Jonge. On February 20, 2013, a sequel, Killzone Shadow Fall, was shown at the PlayStation Meeting 2013, announcing the PlayStation 4 with Shadow Fall as a launch title.

At in height, it is the tallest lighthouse in the state and one of the tallest in the United States (the Cape Hatteras Light in North Carolina is taller at ). It is located between St. Augustine Light and Cape Canaveral Light. Restored by the Ponce de Leon Inlet Lighthouse Preservation Association, the lighthouse became a National Historic Landmark in 1998. History Spiral staircase inside the lighthouse National Historic Landmark plaque The first lighthouse for what is now the Ponce de Le√≥n Inlet was erected on the south side of Mosquito Inlet in 1835. Unfortunately, the oil for the lamp was never delivered, and soon after the tower was completed a strong storm washed much of the sand from around the base of the tower, weakening it. The Second Seminole War began soon after, and in December 1835 Seminole Indians attacked the lighthouse, smashing the glass in the lantern room and setting fire to its wooden stairs. The area was abandoned. The war prevented repairs from being made to the tower, and it collapsed the next year. There were many shipwrecks along the coast near the Mosquito Inlet, but it was not until 1883 that another effort was begun to place a light there. Completed in 1887 and located on the north side of the inlet, the new lighthouse was based on Light-House Board standard plans with modifications made for the specific site. Construction was supervised by Chief Engineer Orville E. Babcock until his death by drowning in the Mosquito Inlet in 1884. The tower was completed and the lamp, which could be seen away, lit in 1887. In 1897, author and journalist Stephen Crane was en route to cover a brewing revolt against Spanish rule in Cuba, when the ship he was on, the SS Commodore, sank off the coast of Florida. Crane escaped in a small dinghy with several crewmen, and they eventually sighted and steered for the Mosquito Inlet Light. Crane used this experience in his short story \\"The Open Boat\\". The original lamp burned kerosene; in 1909 it was replaced with an incandescent oil vapor lamp. In 1924 a generator was installed to provide electricity in the keepers' dwellings and to pump water, replacing an old windmill pump. The lighthouse beacon was electrified in 1933 with a 500-watt lamp. The first order Fresnel lens was replaced with a third order rotating Fresnel lens at the same time. In 1927 the name of Mosquito Inlet was changed to Ponce de Leon Inlet. The lighthouse was transferred from the abolished Lighthouse Service to the United States Coast Guard in 1939, which would oversee it for the next three decades. In 1970, the Coast Guard abandoned the old light station and established a new beacon at New Smyrna Beach. The abandoned property was then deeded to the Town of Ponce Inlet. At the urging of concerned citizens, the Town of Ponce Inlet accepted the Light Station property from the Coast Guard in 1972, and the Lighthouse Preservation Association was formed to manage the museum. That same year, the lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Present day museum In 1982 the light was restored to active service, primarily because highrise buildings blocked the Coast Guard's beacon on the other side of the inlet. The Ponce De Leon Inlet Light Station was designated a National Historic Landmark on August 5, 1998, one of only eleven lighthouses to earn this designation.\\"Ponce de Leon Inlet Light Station official site\\". Ponce de Leon Inlet Lighthouse Preservation Association. Retrieved 2010-03-01. The lighthouse and three keepers' dwellings have been restored, and are open to the public seven days a week. The lighthouse tower is open for climbing. The original 1867 Barbier et Fenestre first order fixed lens (installed 1887), and 1860 \\"Henry Lepaute\\" rotating first order Fresnel lens used at Cape Canaveral Light Station are all on display at the museum. The 1904 Barbier, Benard, et Turenne rotating third order Fresnel lens has been restored to service in the tower, which operates today as a private aid to navigation and is maintained by the museum staff. It is just south of Daytona Beach.

The group formed in Indiana where they performed on local radio before moving to Chicago and a nationwide broadcasting and recording career. The group later moved to Hollywood to star in western movies. Membership The Hot Shots' core personnel were multi-instrumentalists, playing brass band instruments as well as their standard instrumentation of guitar (Ken), clarinet (Gabe), string bass (various), and a strange, homemade instrument known both as the \\"Wabash Washboard\\" and \\"the Zither,\\" played by Hezzie. It consisted of a corrugated sheet metal washboard on a metal stand with various noisemakers attached, including bells and a multi-octave range of squeeze-type bicycle horns; Hezzie Trietsch constructed this instrument himself. Hezzie also played slide whistle on which he was able to play melodies and variations in addition to effects. The washboard, along with other artifacts from the band, is now in the collection of the Indiana State Museum. The Hot Shots' repertoire focused on swing and jazz standards and originals, especially those with a comedic element. Powered by a frantic and seemingly freewheeling instrumental virtuosity, grounded in the musical comedy of vaudeville, the Hot Shots were nevertheless able to cover both comic and more serious material, although some of their more serious recordings retain whimsical ornamental elements, capable of evoking a subtle musical irony. The lineup consisted of the following members: *Ken Trietsch (September 13, 1903 - September 17, 1987) *Hezzie Trietsch (born Paul Trietsch) (April 11, 1905 - April 20, 1980) *Gabe Ward (born Charles Otto Ward) (November 26, 1904 - January 14, 1992) *Frank Kettering (January 1, 1909 - June 9, 1973) *Gil Taylor (born Gilbert Ossian Taylor) *Nate Harrison (born Nathan Harrison) (August 19, 1907 - August 10, 1995) *Billy Keith Milheim Success in vaudeville and radio The story of the Hoosier Hot Shots begins in the first years of the 20th century on the Trietsch family farm near Arcadia, Indiana, about 20 miles north of Indianapolis. The Trietsch family grew to be one of four girls and five boys, two of which‚ÄîKenneth and Paul‚Äîwere to become the nucleus of the Hot Shots. Growing up in rural Indiana and aided by the example of a banjo-playing father, Kenneth, Paul and the other Trietsch children developed a keen interest in music and developed their various talents. An ensemble featuring father and sons toured the American and Canadian vaudeville circuit for several years. After the family act broke up, Ken and Paul went to work with another vaudeville group called Ezra Buzzington's Rube Band. It was while touring with the Rube Band that they met another Hoosier, Charles Otto Ward, known to his audiences as Gabriel Hawkins. \\"Gabe\\" became the third Hot Shot. When the crash of '29 effectively ended vaudeville they, like other vaudevillians, looked to radio and landed a job at WOWO in Ft. Wayne, Indiana. One day they arrived late for a performance and the announcer greeted them with \\"Hey, you Hoosier hot shots, get in here!\\", and the name stuck. Developing their style in Chicago In 1933 they moved to Chicago's WLS, the Prairie Farmer Station. Now Paul (\\"Hezzie\\", on his washboard), \\"Gabe\\" (on clarinet) and Ken (tenor guitar). With the addition in 1934 of Frank Delaney Kettering on bass fiddle, the Hoosier Hot Shots became the quartet that they would remain until the 60s. In the late 1930s, the group had a five-minute radio show on NBC sponsored by Alka-Seltzer and appeared on National Barn Dance on WLS-AM in Chicago, Illinois; they also had a radio program for one season (1949-1950) on the Mutual Broadcasting System. Their music was characterized by novelty songs and arrangements ‚Äì such as \\"I Like Bananas (Because They Have No Bones)\\" and \\"From the Indies to the Andes in His Undies\\" ‚Äì hot jazz rhythms and the occasional sweet harmonies. They also played the pop songs of the day, like \\"Nobody's Sweetheart.\\" Ken kicked off the band with \\"Are you ready, Hezzie?\\"‚Äîdirected at his brother Paul‚Äîand it became one of the band's big taglines, even entering the common vernacular. Recording and film career Over their career the Hoosier Hot Shots recorded hundreds of 78s for such labels as Banner, Conqueror, Decca, Melotone, Oriole, Perfect, Romeo, and Vocalion. Some of these releases have made it to LPs, cassettes, and compact discs. Recordings of songs made by the Hoosier Hot Shots often include the signature spoken (by Ken Trietsch) intro, \\"Are you ready, Hezzie?\\" followed by the sound of the bustle of the musicians preparing to play their instruments. However, the tightly-rehearsed skill of the performers lets the listener in on the joke as soon as the song actually begins. Their producer avoided recording too many takes of their performances, preferring a spontaneous sound: according to one member, the producer would record at most two takes of a particular song, and use the one that sounded worse. Between 1937 and 1950, the Hot Shots appeared in more than 20 movies, sharing billing with the likes of Gene Autry, Dale Evans, Bob Wills, the Three Stooges and Merle Travis. During the mid- to late 1940s they starred in their own series of musical westerns for Columbia Pictures. They were an ongoing presence in the early Billboard magazine country (hillbilly) charts with songs like \\"Beer Barrel Polka\\", \\"When There Are Tears In The Eyes Of The Potato\\", \\"Everybody Loves My Baby\\" and \\"O-Hi-O\\". The World War II era their popularity was at its peak and, in addition to their normal pursuits they toured with the USO in North Africa and Italy. Frank Kettering left in 1943, and replaced by singer-bassist Gil Taylor. They moved to the West Coast where they continued to make movies, records, stage, and radio appearances. They made the transition to television easily and were seen on such TV shows as the Tex Ritter \\"Ranch Party.\\" Legacy The Hoosier Hot Shots' career was winding down by the late '50s but they continued recording (adding Keith Milheim on drums) and playing live venues until the death of Hezzie Trietsch on April 20, 1980. Gabe Ward continued to perform solo after the others had died or retired, until shortly before his own death on January 14, 1992. The Hoosier Hot Shots were not just a comical music act, they were the inspiration for a musical genre that thrived during the '30s, '40s and, thanks to latter-day proponents like \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic and John Lithgow (who recorded a cover of \\"From the Indies to the Andes in His Undies\\" as well as \\"I Like Bananas Because They Have No Bones\\"), can still be heard today. Among the acts that were inspired by the Hot Shots were the Freddie Fisher's Schnickelfritz Band, the Korn Kobblers, and Spike Jones and His City Slickers. Spike Jones's early recordings were heavily influenced by the Hoosier Hot Shots. Both Jones and Fisher copied the \\"Wabash Washboard\\" developed by Ken Trietsch. Further reading Young, Jordan R.

Met Park sat 6,200, and was located near the end of the primary runway of the Norfolk International Airport. This often proved distracting to fans and players when aircraft flew overhead, but inadvertently proved strategic - as the AAA franchise of the New York Mets, players for the Tides could hope to someday be called to play in Shea Stadium, the location of which endures similar noise from nearby LaGuardia Airport. After Met Park was demolished following the Tides' move to Harbor Park, the city built the Lake Wright Executive Center on the former Met Park land.

All insurance policies have exclusions for specific causes of loss (also called \\"perils\\") that are not covered by the insurance company. An extended coverage endorsement (EC) was a common extension of property insurance beyond coverage for fire and lightning. Extended coverage added insurance against loss by the perils of windstorm, hail, explosion, civil commotion, riot and riot attending a strike, aircraft damage, vehicle damage, and smoke damage.\\"extended coverage (EC) endorsement\\" International Risk Management Institute. Retrieved 2014-5-14. The endorsement has been largely supplanted by what is referred to as \\"basic\\" causes-of-loss form first introduced by Insurance Services Office in 1986 as part of its simplified language revisions. The basic form includes most of the perils previously provided by fire and extended coverage and it adds vandalism and malicious mischief, sprinkler leakage damage, sinkhole collapse, and volcanic action. Coverage can also be extended on scheduled personal articles or applied as extensions to personal umbrella liability or extended title. Broader coverage is available in \\"broad form\\" and \\"special form\\" causes-of-loss forms. Broad form adds three additional perils plus collapse due to certain causes. Special form covers almost all risks of loss except those that are specifically excluded.

Early life Osmon was born in Marlow, New Hampshire. He entered the Wilbraham Wesleyan Academy at the age of fifteen, where soon after he converted to Christianity and was received into the church by Dr. Wilbur Fisk (who was at that time Principal of the school). Osmon was licensed to exhort in his seventeenth year. In 1830 he entered Wesleyan University. He had successfully completed three years at Wesleyan when failing health compelled him to leave the institution. Yet, while in college he also was licensed as a Local Preacher, laboring diligently in that office Ordained and academic ministry The Rev. Mr. Baker became a teacher in the seminary at Newbury, Vermont in 1834. He was elected Principal of this seminary in 1839. Having resigned the seminary principalship in 1844, the Rev. Mr. Baker was appointed Pastor of the M.E. Church in Manchester, New Hampshire. He was appointed Presiding Elder of the Dover District in 1846. During the next year he accepted a professorship in the General Biblical Institute in Concord, New Hampshire, which later became the Boston University School of Theology. Dr. Baker became a distinguished scholar. He also continued to reside in Concord for the remainder of his life. Episcopal ministry The Rev. Dr. Osmon Cleander Baker was elected and consecrated to the Episcopacy of the Methodist Episcopal Church by the 1852 General Conference. He discharged the varied duties of this office with diligence and success until 1866. In 1866 Bishop Baker was attacked with partial paralysis while on his way to preside over the Colorado Annual Conference. He reached his destination with great difficulty. He thus examined and ordained the ordinands in a private room, rather than before the entire Conference. He then returned home, having suffered much pain and extreme exhaustion. Bishop Baker's health then became sufficiently restored to enable him to preside at a few other Annual Conferences, and to attend the annual and semi-annual meetings of the Board of Bishops of the M.E. Church for two more years, when his strength again declined and his voice was greatly affected. Death Bishop Baker was no longer able to take a public role in the work of the church. Nevertheless, he continued to attend the various meetings and enjoyed them, up until a short time before his death. Returning from worship one Sabbath, he fell helpless at the threshold of his home, but regained his strength for a time. The fatal stroke of paralysis came 8 December 1871. Bishop Baker lingered but a few days afterwards. He died 20 December 1871 in Concord, New Hampshire, aged fifty-nine years. Honors The Rev. Mr. Osmon Cleander Baker was awarded the honorary degree Doctor of Divinity. Also, Baker University in Kansas is named in his honour. Chartered 12 February 1858, Baker University is the oldest University in the State of Kansas. Baker is memorialized in a stained glass window at Marsh Chapel at Boston University. Bishop Simpson's assessment Matthew Simpson, who was made a bishop at the same General Conference, wrote this of his colleague Osman Cleander Baker: :In his general character he was distinguished for regularity and symmetry. His temperament was even and quiet; he was possessed of sound judgment and retentive memory, and combined calmness with firm religious convictions. As a teacher, he was assiduous; as a preacher, he was persuasive in manner, chaste in style, and often his ministrations were attended with divine power. As a Bishop, he was impartial and judicious, and his administration was marked by a clear understanding of the constitution and laws of the church. His published work on the Discipline indicates his thorough knowledge of the administration of the church.

It may be played with a dedicated yonin shogi set or with two sets of standard shogi pieces, and is played on a standard sized shogi board. Rules of the game = Objective = The objective of the game is to capture all of the opponents‚Äô kings as an individual or with the option of teaming up with one or two fellow players. Fast matches are common. = Game equipment = Four players play on a standard 9√ó9 shogi board, which is commonly colored black in dedicated yonin shogi sets. Each player has a 9-piece subset of the standard shogi pieces: * 1 king * 1 rook * 2 gold generals * 2 silver generals * 3 pawns = Setup = Each side places his pieces in a triangular arrangement, facing toward the player opposite him, as shown below. * In the rank nearest the player,  The king is placed in the center file;  The two gold generals are placed on either side of the king;  The two silver generals are placed next to the gold generals. The four outside files are left empty. * In the second rank,  The rook is placed in the same file as the king;  A pawn is placed on either side of the rook, in front of the gold generals. * In the third rank, a pawn is placed in the same file as the king and rook. { border=\\"0\\"  valign=\\"top\\"  { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"background:#000000\\" - align=center border=\\"0\\" style=\\"background:white;\\" ! style=\\"width:25px\\"  9 !! style=\\"width:25px\\"  8 !! style=\\"width:25px\\"  7 !! style=\\"width:25px\\"  6 !! style=\\"width:25px\\"  5 !! style=\\"width:25px\\"  4 !! style=\\"width:25px\\"  3 !! style=\\"width:25px\\"  2 !! style=\\"width:25px\\"  1 !! style=\\"width:25px\\" - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  ÈäÄ  Èáë  Áéã  Èáë  ÈäÄ  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  ‰∏Ä - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  Ê≠©  È£õ  Ê≠©  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  ‰∫å - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  ÈäÄ  Ê≠©  ÈäÄ  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  ‰∏â - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  Èáë  Ê≠©  Ê≠©  Èáë  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  Âõõ - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  Áéã  È£õ  Ê≠©  Ê≠©  È£õ  Áéã  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  ‰∫î - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  Èáë  Ê≠©  Ê≠©  Èáë  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  ÂÖ≠ - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  ÈäÄ  Ê≠©  ÈäÄ  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  ‰∏É - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  Ê≠©  È£õ  Ê≠©  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  ÂÖ´ - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  ÈäÄ  Èáë  Áéã  Èáë  ÈäÄ  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  ‰πù }  style=\\"width:33px\\"  valign=\\"top\\"  { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"color:white; background:#000000\\" - align=center border=\\"0\\" style=\\"background:white;\\" ! style=\\"width:25px\\"  1 !! style=\\"width:25px\\"  2 !! style=\\"width:25px\\"  3 !! style=\\"width:25px\\"  4 !! style=\\"width:25px\\"  5 !! style=\\"width:25px\\"  6 !! style=\\"width:25px\\"  7 !! style=\\"width:25px\\"  8 !! style=\\"width:25px\\"  9 !! style=\\"width:25px\\" - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  S  G  K  G  S  style=\\"width:15px\\" style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  a - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  p  R  p  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  b - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  S  p  S  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  c - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  G  p  p  G  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  d - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  K  R  p  p  R  K  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  e - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  G  p  p  G  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  f - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  S  p  S  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  g - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  p  R  p  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  h - align=center style=\\"color:white\\"  S  G  K  G  S  style=\\"width:15px\\" style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  i } } Note: some common sets feature a black board with white pieces. = Game play = The order of play may be decided by flipping four pawns and counting the number that land promoted-side up. Turns proceed clockwise from the first player. Movement and capture are identical to standard shogi, except for check and checkmate. Each player has a full three-rank promotion zone as in standard shogi. Repetition, perpetual check, and illegal moves are also dealt with as in standard shogi. = Check and mate = Yonin shogi departs from standard shogi in its rules for check and checkmate, due to the complications of having four players. In yonin shogi, it is checkmate rather than forcing resignation that ends a player's game. These are not equivalent as they are in standard shogi: In yonin shogi a third player might capture the mating piece before the defeated player has a chance to resign; this is avoided by ending a player's game immediately upon checkmate. In team play, check and checkmate do not count against the other member of one's team. They are simply ignored. One player may inadvertently place a second player in check due to the movement of a third player‚Äôs piece. This is a special form of discovered check unique to multiplayer chess variants. Similarly, if one player places a second player in check, a move of a third player may result in checkmate for the second player without the third player attacking directly. In yonin shogi, it is the player who makes the move that results in checkmate that gets credit for the checkmate, not the player who makes the initial check. Once a king is in check, the threatened player immediately takes the next turn in defense and play continues clockwise from there. If two or three kings are placed in check simultaneously, the first player in the clockwise direction to defend takes the next turn. = Game end = When a player is mated, all remaining pieces except the king are left on the board and placed under the control of the mating player. Their original direction of movement is maintained. Any pieces held in hand are given to the mating player, but can only be dropped in the original direction of the mating player. The defeated king is turned upside-down and left as an obstacle for the remaining players. It cannot be captured or removed from the board. In some descriptions of the game, the winner is the first player to checkmate twice, or to checkmate a player who has already checkmated another. In others, the winner is the last player standing. In the latter case, the first player to be checkmated is ranked fourth, the next is ranked third, and the player losing at the end is ranked second. Because of the dead kings left as obstacles, it is possible for a player to be unable to make a legal move. This also counts as a loss. It is possible to check or checkmate two or three players with a single move. A bare king may remain on the board in opposition to the other players in an effort to increase its ranking. In a timed game, a bare king can move faster than its opponent, therefore it may attempt to win the game by forcing its opponent to run out of time. Note that some league tournaments may disallow this.  Game notation  Yonin game notation is the same as that of shogi, except that there are four columns instead of two. History This version of Yonin shogi was devised in 1993 by Ota Mitsuyasu, former mayor of Hirata (present day Izumo) in Shimane Prefecture. It is a recognized variant and plastic play sets are available for as little as ¬•300 (‚âàUS$2.50). Yonin shogi sets were sold at the stand of the shogi hall. Some elementary schools even hold tournaments. It is likely that four-person shogi has been played for many decades with rules made up as players went along. A fully complete and playable set of rules first appeared in a weekly children‚Äôs magazine in February 1991. The primary differences between this and the current rules are in the pieces used (nearly a complete standard shogi set for each player) and the initial setup, which is also closer to standard shogi. In the diagram below, pieces are color-coded as to the player they belong to. { border=\\"0\\"  valign=\\"top\\"  { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" style=\\"background:#000000\\" - align=center border=\\"0\\" style=\\"background:white;\\" !

History It opened on 5 April 1857.Victoria Street Station NSWrail.net It is in about the same location as the first East Maitland station and marked the temporary terminus of the railway from Newcastle while the bridge over Wallis Creek was built. From 1906 to 1926 it was also an interchange station with the steam tramway line that ran from West to East Maitland. The present building was built in 1877 and in 1914 the single platform was converted to an island platform and a footbridge added when the line was duplicated.Victoria Street Railway Station NSW Environment & Heritage The station footbridge was added along with the island conversion in 1914. From 2017 to 2018, under the Transport Access Program, Victoria Street Station received three new lifts, new canopies and signage, bike racks and improvements to the interchange areas. Platforms & services Victoria Street has one island platform with two faces. It is serviced by NSW TrainLink Hunter Line services travelling from Newcastle to Maitland, Muswellbrook, Scone, Telarah and Dungog.

It is currently used mostly as a home ground for Eredivisie club Heerenveen. The current capacity is 26,400. Naming The stadium is named after Abe Lenstra, generally considered to be the greatest Heerenveen player in the history of the club. Abe was born on 27 November 1920 in Heerenveen and joined the club aged 15 years. After almost 17 years at Heerenveen, he joined SC Enschede in 1954. He left this club in 1960 to join SC Enschede's archrival Enschedese Boys. In 1963 he stopped playing football at the age of 42. In total he scored 700 goals in about 730 matches. Abe died on 2 September 1985, he was 64 years old, at the eve of what was to become the only international match to be played in the community sportspark that was to become the (old) Abe Lenstrastadium. Construction of the stadium The construction of the stadium started in 1993. The plan was to build a stadium with open corners, but when the construction was well underway the club decided to close the gaps. At the time the building was finished, it had a maximum capacity of 14,500. On 20 August 1994 the stadium was officially opened by Prince Willem- Alexander of the Dutch royal family. He made the symbolic first kick-off in this stadium. After the opening the first match started between SC Heerenveen and PSV Eindhoven. At the time Ronaldo played at PSV, this match was his first one in Europe. Expansions East entrance of the stadion Because SC Heerenveen kept growing and the results were getting better every year, the club planned the first expansion of the stadium in 2002. The capacity of the stadium was almost doubled to 26,100 seats. Throughout the years empty spots in the stadium were filled with seats. Together with some other changes in the stadium the number of seats increased to the current 26,800. In 2011 there was a plan to have another expansion of the stadium, taking the capacity to 32,000. The construction should be ready for the start of the 2012/2013 Eredivisie season. The reason for the expansion is the ever growing waiting list for the club's season tickets. Along with that, more people in the stadium means more income which leads to a bigger budget for the club to work with. However, this expansion was seen as too risky and financially unfeasible. There were plans to expand the stadium to 29,000 seats over the course of the summer of 2012, however the economic downturn shelved these plans. World Cup bid As part of the combined Netherlands and Belgium bid to host the 2018 or 2022 FIFA World Cup, the stadium was one of five stadiums in the Netherlands selected by the KNVB to host games. A successful bid would have meant that the stadium capacity would have been increased to the minimum required seating of 44,000 . In the beginning of December 2010 FIFA announced that the 2018 World Cup would be awarded to Russia. Just before the announcement of the World Cup the club announced that the next expansion would be postponed. The other four selected host cities in the Netherlands were Amsterdam (Amsterdam Arena and Olympisch Stadion), Rotterdam (Feijenoord Stadion De Kuip and De Nieuwe Kuip), Eindhoven (Philips Stadion) and Enschede (De Grolsch Veste). 800px References Category:Football venues in the Netherlands Category:Sports venues completed in 1994 Category:Sports venues in Heerenveen Category:SC Heerenveen Category:1994 establishments in the Netherlands ","title":"Abe Lenstra Stadion"},{"id":"3962982","text":"Erve Asito, formerly the Polman Stadion, is a multi-use stadium in Almelo, Netherlands.

In 2006 NAC Breda named the stadium after its most famous NAC Player, Antoon Verlegh. The stadium was built from 1995 to 1996 at a cost of ‚Ç¨ 13.2 million, and was officially opened on 11 August 1996. It has been used for association football, concerts, and other events. It has a capacity of 19,000 fans, including 1,500 standing room-only, for sports matches. The stadium has been used for several Intertoto matches, UEFA Cup matches and international matches. Concerts have also been held at the Rat Verlegh stadion. History VVV during the 2009‚Äì10 season. In November 1991 NAC Breda's board officially announced that it researched the possibilities to either renovate the NAC Stadion located at the Beatrixstraat, or to build a new stadium within Breda's city borders.Dutch text former stadium plans Renovation of the original stadium was too costly and in 1993 NAC Breda announced plans to build a new stadium. In mutual agreement with the city of Breda, the grounds near the Lunetstraat in Breda were allocated as the new stadium zone. On 18 August 1995 the construction of the new stadium began. NAC Breda announced that FUJIFILM had signed a contract for 10 years, in which the stadium's name would be named after NAC's former main sponsor. After a construction period of almost one year, the stadium was officially opened by Breda's mayor Fred Rutten and KNVB chairman Jos Staatsen. After the official opening, NAC Breda played their first match in front of 17,000 fans in the FUJIFILM Stadium against vice World Champion Porto Alegrense Gremio from Brazil. NAC's first official match was at 16 August 1996 in a Cup tie against Dordrecht 90. NAC player Stanley MacDonald scored the first goal in the new stadium. During its existence, the stadium was host for numerous competition matches, cup ties, friendly matches, but also Intertoto matches, a UEFA Cup match and an international friendly between Ecuador and Turkey. In 2017 the stadium was used for the UEFA Women's Euro 2017 . In total the stadium hosted 4 group matches and 1 semi-final between Denmark and Austria. In 2003 the stadium was renamed to the Mycom Stadion, at that time a sponsor of NAC Breda. In 2006 the stadium was renamed after NAC's most famous and important player; Antoon 'Rat' Verlegh.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History The first site to bear the East Maitland name was a temporary terminus while the bridge over Wallis Creek was being built, was about where Victoria Street is now. The second was directly north of William Street between the East Maitland Courthouse and Post Office. The third site was opened originally as Morpeth Junction when the short Morpeth branch to Morpeth opened in 1866 and was about 400 metres west of the present East Maitland. The second station closed in 1873 and became the goods yard and Morpeth Junction was renamed East Maitland. The current site was opened in 1914 when the Main Northern line was quadrupled with the two extra coal roads built south side of the existing tracks. At that time the Morpeth branch was realigned to allow trains to proceed directly from Newcastle instead of from Maitland. It received its own platform on a lower level.East Maitland Railway Precinct NSW Environment & Heritage The new site of East Maitland became the junction and the third East Maitland then became the goods siding. For many years after 1916 there were five tracks from the goods siding to just east of East Maitland station. The remains of this can be seen in the wider than now required overpass of Melbourne Street and in the wider Pitnacree Road bridge over the railway line. The line to Morpeth closed in 1953 with the branch line platform at East Maitland still remaining today. Platforms and services High Street has one island platform with two faces.

It is home to football club NEC. The stadium was opened on 8 July 1939 by Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands. Since 1951 the opening of the International Four Days Marches Nijmegen, the so-called Vlaggenparade, a parade with the national flags of all participants is held in the stadium. N.E.C. (football club) are the tenants of the 12,500 capacity venue. On 19 October 1983 NEC played a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup match against FC Barcelona, still seen as the most important match ever played in the Goffertstadion. It was rebuilt into a modern stadium with all seats covered and heated and updated catering facilities. The first home-match in the new stadium took place in September 1999. The grand re-opening was on 25 January 2000. One of the many advantages the renovated stadium offers is the improved atmosphere because the spectators are now situated much closer to the playing ground. Because of this the players have a better interaction with the crowd. The playing ground and the rest of the stadium are separated from each other by a promenade which is situated under the spectators‚Äô seats. This promenade has a double function: It prevents supporters from entering the playing ground while at the same time containing food and beverage outlets as well as toilets. A specially constructed space under the playing ground can store heat to warm up the playing ground, so that matches can still take place during winter. In November 2007 the board of NEC and the city of Nijmegen presented new plans for De Goffert. The capacity is intended to be increased to 20,000 and the stadium will be placed largely underground inside a large hill. www.gelderlander.nl This hill will also serve as a home for basketball (Matrixx Magixx), judo and other sports, creating a 'House of Topsports'. The strange, but innovative, design is needed because the city will not allow the stadium to grow in height because of the Goffert Park, which is a protected nature-site. The Nijmegen venue hosted three international matches of the Dutch national football team in the 1970s, with the last being a qualifying match for Euro 1980 on 20 September 1978 against Iceland: 3‚Äì0. The goals were scored by Ruud Krol, Ernie Brandts and Rob Rensenbrink (penalty).

The KKM lemma can be proved from Sperner's lemma and can be used to prove the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. Statement Let \\\\Delta_{n-1} be a n-1-dimensional simplex with n vertices labeled as 1,\\\\ldots,n. A KKM covering is defined as a set C_1,\\\\ldots,C_n of closed sets such that for any I \\\\subseteq \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\}, the convex hull of the vertices corresponding to I is covered by \\\\bigcup_{i\\\\in I}C_i. The KKM lemma says that a KKM covering has a non-empty intersection, i.e: :\\\\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}C_i eq \\\\emptyset. Example When n=3, the KKM lemma considers the simplex \\\\Delta_2 which is a triangle, whose vertices can be labeled 1, 2 and 3. We are given three closed sets C_1,C_2,C_3 such that: * C_1 covers vertex 1, C_2 covers vertex 2, C_3 covers vertex 3. * The edge 12 (from vertex 1 to vertex 2) is covered by the sets C_1 and C_2, the edge 23 is covered by the sets C_2 and C_3, the edge 31 is covered by the sets C_3 and C_1. * The union of all three sets covers the entire triangle The KKM lemma states that the sets C_1, C_2, C_3 have at least one point in common. thumb The lemma is illustrated by the picture on the right, in which set #1 is blue, set #2 is red and set #3 is green. The KKM requirements are satisfied, since: * Each vertex is covered by a unique color. * Each edge is covered by the two colors of its two vertices. * The triangle is covered by all three colors. The KKM lemma states that there is a point covered by all three colors simultaneously; such a point is clearly visible in the picture. Note that it is important that all sets are closed, i.e., contain their boundary. If, for example, the red set is not closed, then it is possible that the central point is contained only in the blue and green sets, and then the intersection of all three sets may be empty.  Equivalent results  Generalizations =Rainbow KKM lemma (Gale)= David Gale proved the following generalization of the KKM lemma. Suppose that, instead of one KKM covering, we have n different KKM coverings: C^1_1,\\\\ldots,C^1_n,\\\\ldots,C^n_1,\\\\ldots,C^n_n. Then, there exists a permutation \\\\pi of the coverings with a non-empty intersection, i.e: :\\\\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}C^{\\\\pi(i)}_i eq \\\\emptyset. The name \\"rainbow KKM lemma\\" is inspired by Gale's description of his lemma: > \\"A colloquial statement of this result is... if each of three people paint a > triangle red, white and blue according to the KKM rules, then there will be > a point which is in the red set of one person, the white set of another, the > blue of the third\\". The rainbow KKM lemma can be proved using a rainbow generalization of Sperner's lemma. The original KKM lemma follows from the rainbow KKM lemma by simply picking n identical coverings. =Connector-free lemma (Bapat)= A connector of a simplex is a connected set that touches all n faces of the simplex. thumb A connector-free covering is a covering C_1,\\\\ldots,C_n in which no C_i contains a connector. Any KKM covering is a connector-free covering, since in a KKM covering, no C_i even touches all n faces. However, there are connector-free coverings that are not KKM coverings. An example is illustrated at the right. There, the red set touches all three faces, but it does not contain any connector, since no connected component of it touches all three faces. A theorem of Ravindra Bapat, generalizing Sperner's lemma, implies the KKM lemma extends to connector-free coverings (he proved his theorem for n=3). The connector-free variant also has a permutation variant, so that both these generalizations can be used simultaneously. = KKMS theorem = The KKMS theorem is a generalization of the KKM lemma by Lloyd Shapley. It is useful in economics, especially in cooperative game theory. While a KKM covering contains n closed sets, a KKMS covering contains 2^n-1 closed sets - indexed by the nonempty subsets of [n] (equivalently: by nonempty faces of \\\\Delta_{n-1}). For any I \\\\subseteq [n], the convex hull of the vertices corresponding to I should be covered by the union of sets corresponding to subsets of I , that is: > \\\\operatorname{conv}(\\\\\\\\{v_i : i\\\\in I\\\\\\\\}) \\\\subseteq \\\\bigcup_{J \\\\subseteq > I}C_J. The KKMS theorem says that for any KKMS covering, there is a balanced collection B of 2^{[n]}, such that the intersection of sets indexed by B is nonempty: :\\\\bigcap_{J\\\\in B} C_J eq \\\\emptyset It remains to explain what a \\"balanced collection\\" is. A collection B of subsets of [n] is called balanced if there is a weight function on B (assigning a weight w_J\\\\geq 0 to every J\\\\in B), such that, for each element i\\\\in [n], the sum of weights of all subsets containing i is exactly 1. For example, suppose n=3. Then: * The collection {{1}, {2}, {3}} is balanced: choose all weights to be 1. The same is true for any collection in which each element appears exactly once, such as the collection {{1,2},{3}} or the collection { {1,2,3} }. * The collection {{1,2}, {2,3}, {3,1}} is balanced: choose all weights to be 1/2. The same is true for any collection in which each element appears exactly twice. * The collection {{1,2}, {2,3}} is not balanced, since for any choice of positive weights, the sum for element 2 will be larger than the sum for element 1 or 3, so it is not possible that all sums equal 1. * The collection {{1,2}, {2,3}, {1}} is balanced: choose w_{1,2}=0,w_{2,3}=1,w_{1}=1. In hypergraph terminology, a collection B is balanced with respect to its ground-set V, iff the hypergraph with vertex-set V and edge-set B admits a perfect fractional matching. The KKMS theorem implies the KKM lemma. Suppose we have a KKM covering C_i, for i=1,\\\\ldots,n. Construct a KKMS covering C'_J as follows: *C'_J = C_i whenever J=\\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\} (J is a singleton that contains only element i). *C'_J = \\\\emptyset otherwise. The KKM condition on the original covering C_i implies the KKMS condition on the new covering C'_J. Therefore, there exists a balanced collection such that the corresponding sets in the new covering have nonempty intersection. But the only possible balanced collection is the collection of all singletons; hence, the original covering has nonempty intersection. The KKMS theorem has various proofs. Reny and Wooders proved that the balanced set can also be chosen to be partnered. Zhou proved a variant of the KKMS theorem where the covering consists of open sets rather than closed sets. = Polytopal KKMS theorem (Komiya) = Hidetoshi Komiya generalized the KKMS theorem from simplices to polytopes. Let P be any compact convex polytope. Let \\\\textrm{Faces}(P) be the set of nonempty faces of P. A Komiya covering of P is a family of closed sets \\\\\\\\{C_F: F\\\\in \\\\textrm{Faces}(P)\\\\\\\\} such that for every face F\\\\in \\\\textrm{Faces}(P): > F\\\\subseteq \\\\bigcup_{G\\\\subseteq F, ~ G \\\\in \\\\textrm{Faces}(P)} C_G. Komiya's theorem says that for every Komiya covering of P, there is a balanced collection B\\\\subseteq \\\\textrm{Faces}(P), such that the intersection of sets indexed by B is nonempty: :\\\\bigcap_{F\\\\in B} C_F eq \\\\emptyset Komiya's theorem also generalizes the definition of a balanced collection: instead of requiring that there is a weight function on B such that the sum of weights near each vertex of P is 1, we start by choosing any set of points \\\\textbf{b} = \\\\\\\\{b^F: F\\\\in \\\\textrm{Faces}(P), b^F\\\\in F \\\\\\\\}. A collection B\\\\subseteq \\\\textrm{Faces}(P) is called balanced with respect to \\\\textbf{b} iff b^P \\\\in \\\\operatorname{conv} \\\\\\\\{ b^F: F\\\\in B \\\\\\\\}, that is, the point assigned to the entire polygon P is a convex combination of the points assigned to the faces in the collection B. The KKMS theorem is a special case of Komiya's theorem in which the polytope P = \\\\Delta_{n-1} and b^F is the barycenter of the face F (in particular, b^P is the barycenter of \\\\Delta_{n-1}, which is the point (1/n, \\\\ldots, 1/n) ). = Boundary conditions (Musin) = Oleg R. Musin proved several generalizations of the KKM lemma and KKMS theorem, with boundary conditions on the coverings. The boundary conditions are related to homotopy.

In accordance with longstanding custom, during her time as Secretary of State she largely avoided taking stances on most domestic political issues. In 2015, she announced her candidacy for the presidency. Clinton won the Democratic primaries and formally became the party's nominee at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. She lost the electoral college and the 2016 US presidential election to billionaire real estate mogul Donald Trump. Over her career, Clinton has developed a reputation as a \\"policy wonk\\" who frequently consults with expert advisors and is deeply involved in the details of policy proposals.Tamara Keith, Clinton Runs As Wonk In Chief, Trying To Win Hearts With Plans, All Things Considered, NPR (January 30, 2016).Jim Tankersley, How Hillary Clinton created her plan for America ‚Äî behind-the-scenes, The Washington Post (August 2, 2016).Glenn Thrush, Wonk Warrior: Inside the Relaunch of Hillary Clinton, Politico Magazine (June 12, 2016). By August 2016, the Clinton campaign had released 38 policy proposals and 65 fact-sheets, totaling 112,735 words.  Political philosophy = In her own words = In her 1996 book It Takes a Village, Clinton writes, \\"Most of us would describe ourselves as 'middle of the road'‚Äîliberal in some areas, conservative in others, moderate in most, neither exclusively pro- nor anti- government.\\" Clinton has stated that she prefers the term \\"progressive\\" to \\"liberal\\", explaining that \\"Unfortunately, in the last 30, 40 years, [the word 'liberal'] has been turned up on its head and it's been made to seem as though it is a word that describes big government, totally contrary to what its meaning was in the 19th and early 20th century. I prefer the word 'progressive,' which has a real American meaning, going back to the Progressive Era at the beginning of the 20th century.\\" Yale historian Beverly Gage claims this was due to the fact that \\"liberal\\" was considered \\"a term of opprobrium\\" by the time Bill and Hillary became involved in national politics, while the term \\"progressive\\" has consistently referred to vaguely positive notions of progress, from Republicans and Democrats alike, especially with regard to the Progressive Era. At a Democratic primary debate in June 2007, in response to the question of whether she would describe herself as a liberal, Clinton said: \\"I consider myself a modern progressive, someone who believes strongly in individual rights and freedoms, who believes that we are better as a society when we're working together and when we find ways to help those who may not have all the advantages in life get the tools they need to lead a more productive life for themselves and their family. So I consider myself a proud modern American progressive, and I think that's the kind of philosophy and practice that we need to bring back to American politics.\\" In a September 2015 Women for Hillary event, Clinton said, \\"You know, I get accused of being kind of moderate and center. I plead guilty.\\" When asked by Anderson Cooper in October 2015 how she reconciles being both a progressive and moderate, \\"Do you change your political identity based on who you're talking to? Just for the record, are you a progressive or a moderate?\\", Hillary answered \\"I'm a progressive. But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done. And I know how to find common ground, and I know how to stand my ground, and I have proved that in every position that I've had, even dealing with Republicans who never had a good word to say about me, honestly.\\" = Scales and rankings = Clinton's 2015 Crowdpac rating was ‚àí6.4 on a left-right scale, where ‚àí10 is the most liberal and 10 is the most conservative. The score is an aggregate of primarily campaign contributions but also votes and speeches. This represents a slight rightward shift from her 2008 rating of ‚àí6.9. Clinton is rated a \\"Hard-Core Liberal\\" according to the OnTheIssues.org scale, which is based on her public statements on social and economic issues. According to FiveThirtyEight's review of this and other analyses, \\"Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate\\", slightly more liberal than Barack Obama, \\"as liberal as Elizabeth Warren and barely more moderate than Bernie Sanders\\". A New York Times analysis found that Clinton and Bernie Sanders voted the same 93 percent of the time in the two years they shared in the Senate (2007‚Äì2009), but also noted key areas of disagreement which possibly reflected \\"political calculations by Mrs. Clinton, who was preparing for a presidential run in 2008\\" Clinton \\"was the 11th most liberal member of the Senate\\" according to DW-NOMINATE, a multidimensional scaling method based on legislative votes.  Interest groups  Clinton's lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union (based on Senate votes) is 8.13%, similar to that of Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).  Economic policy  According to Vox, Clinton was more liberal on economic issues than former President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton, and had a more liberal voting record than Obama when they both served in the United States Senate.Matthew Yglesias, Hillary Clinton has always been to Obama's left on economics, Vox (June 15, 2015) According to a report by Moody's Analytics on Clinton's 2016 economic proposals, \\"Secretary Clinton's economic policies when taken together will result in a stronger U.S. economy under almost any scenario.\\" Clinton's proposals would, if enacted, create 10.4 million jobs during a four-year presidential term (3.2 million more than expected under current law). GDP growth would be 2.7%, as opposed to the 2.3% expected under current law until 2020. The report noted that her immigration proposal would increase the number of skilled workers in the economy, her infrastructure spending would help business productivity, and her paid family leave proposal would bring more people into the workforce. According to a Financial Times survey of economists, roughly 70% of the economists polled between July 28‚Äì29 said a Clinton victory in November would be positive for U.S. economic growth (compared with just under 14% for Trump). According to a survey of National Association for Business Economics (NABE) members, 55% of business economists feel that Clinton would do the best job as president of managing the U.S. economy (with 15% choosing Gary Johnson, 15% saying that they did not know or did not have an opinion, and 14% choosing Donald Trump). According to a survey by the Wall Street Journal, 13 of the 20 former Democratic members of the White House Council of Economic Advisers openly support Clinton, and none of the 20 opposes her. Nineteen Nobel laureates in economics signed a letter endorsing Clinton, saying \\"Hillary Clinton is by far the superior presidential candidate for our economy and our country\\" than Donald Trump. Clinton's \\"infrastructure plan has been widely praised by economists across the political spectrum.\\" However, John H. Cochrane, an economist at the conservative Hoover Institution, argues that Clinton's infrastructure spending plan would have limited effects on economic growth. He has also said that \\"a President Trump 'could be responsible for more lost jobs than anyone.'\\" The 2016 Clinton campaign's in-house economic advisors include Michael Shapiro and Michael Schmidt, who worked on economic policy in the Obama administration at the National Economic Council and Treasury Department, respectively. The campaign's external advisory group includes Princeton professor Alan Krueger, former Treasury official and former chairperson of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers; Princeton professor Alan Blinder, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers and a Federal Reserve official in the 1990s; liberal Columbia professor Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate, former World Bank chief economist and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and prominent critic of free-market fundamentalism and the management of globalization; MIT professor Simon Johnson, a former chief economist of the IMF; Duke professor Aaron Chatterji; Berkeley professor Christina Romer, a former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration; and Heather Boushey, an expert on inequality and paid family leave who serves as the executive director and chief economist of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. = Bankruptcy = In 2001, Clinton voted to advance a bankruptcy reform bill that would have made it more difficult for borrowers to discharge their debt as part of bankruptcy proceedings. Clinton stated that her vote for the legislation was contingent on the inclusion of provisions intended to protect women, including allowing women to collect child support payments after the father has declared bankruptcy. Credit card companies and banks supported the overhaul, as did women's groups, while consumer groups opposed the legislation. When explaining her vote, Clinton stated, \\"I will not vote for final passage of this bill if it comes back from conference if these kind of reforms are missing ... I am voting for this legislation because it is a work in progress, and it is making progress towards reform.\\" The bill did not come up for a final vote that legislative session. When similar legislation came up again in 2005 but without the amendments added by Democrats in 2001, Clinton opposed the legislation. In 2006 and 2007, while in the Senate, Clinton introduced the Student Borrower Bill of Rights. The legislation \\"would have made it easier for cash-strapped student borrowers to pay back their loans, have their loans refinanced, qualify for income-based loan payments, and discharge student debt in bankruptcy.\\"Mandi Woodruff, How Hillary Clinton might solve the student debt crisis, Yahoo Finance (May 1, 2015). The legislation did not pass at the time. = Campaign finance = Clinton has said that she would, if elected President, introduce a constitutional amendment within the first 30 days of her presidency to overturn the Supreme Court's controversial decision in Citizens United v. FEC (2010), which \\"launched a new era of unbridled fundraising\\" in U.S. elections.Dave Levinthal, How 'Citizens United' is helping Hillary Clinton win the White House, Center for Public Integrity (April 13, 2016), reprinted at NBC News. Clinton says that she would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Citizens United, stating: \\"I will do everything I can to appoint Supreme Court justices who protect the right to vote and do not protect the right of billionaires to buy elections.\\"Hillary Clinton Says Citizens United Would Guide Supreme Court Picks, The New York Times (May 19, 2015). Clinton also pledged, if elected, to push for legislation demanding more \\"effective\\" disclosure of political spending by outside groups and, if Congress does not act, to sign an executive order requiring federal government contractors to disclose all political spending. In 2002, Clinton voted in favor of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold Act), which imposed restrictions on soft money and political campaign advertising. In 2007, Clinton spoke in favor of public financing of some campaigns: \\"I believe we have to move, eventually in our country, toward a system of public financing that really works for candidates running for federal office. I will support that as president.\\"Jeffrey Gold, \\"Clinton Backs Public Funds for Campaigns\\", Associated Press, September 19, 2007. Retrieved September 19, 2007. At the same time, her own fundraising allowed her to opt out of the 30 year old public financing scheme for presidential elections, a move followed by the other candidates for the democratic nomination: Barack Obama and John Edwards. In 2016, Clinton proposed a public financing system that would amplify small contributions. = Capitalism and economic philosophy = In a 1996 interview, Clinton commented on the relationship between government and the private sector, saying: \\"I just believe that there's got to be a healthy tension among all of our institutions in society, and that the market is the driving force behind our prosperity, our freedom in so many respects to make our lives our own but that it cannot be permitted just to run roughshod over people's lives as well.\\"Rob Dietz, Klein, Raasch praised Giuliani's misrepresentation of Clinton quote, Media Matters for America (May 18, 2007). In a speech in October 2014, Clinton stated \\"Don't let anybody tell you that it's corporations and businesses that create jobs. You know that old theory, trickle-down economics. That has been tried; that has failed. It has failed rather spectacularly.\\"Igor Bobic, GOP Sees ‚ÄòYou Didn‚Äôt Build That‚Äô In Hillary Clinton Jobs Remark, The Huffington Post (October 25, 2014). In a July 2015 speech at the New York University Stern School of Business, Clinton condemned what she called \\"short-termism\\" and \\"quarterly capitalism\\"‚Äî\\"the obsession with share prices and quarterly earnings over real value creation, which Clinton views as dangerous to the economy.\\"Tory Newmyer, Hillary Clinton: Capitalism is out of balance, needs a reset, Fortune (July 24, 2015).Alex Seitz-Wald, How Hillary Clinton plans to 'save capitalism', MSNBC (July 30, 2015). Clinton called for \\"new, creative, disruptive ideas to save capitalism\\" and has said that capitalism \\"needs to be reinvented, it needs to be put back into balance.\\" In a Democratic primary debate in October 2015 with Senator Bernie Sanders, her then-primary rival, Clinton said: \\"When I think about capitalism I think about all the business that started because they had the opportunity and the freedom to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families ... We would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in history.\\"Tessa Berenson, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Spar on Capitalism in First Debate, Time (October 13, 2015). Unlike Sanders, Clinton is not a supporter of the Nordic model, saying in the same debate: \\"We are not Denmark. I love Denmark, but we are the United States of America, and it's our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism so it doesn't run amok.\\"Ezra Klein, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton's debate over capitalism, explained, Vox (October 14, 2015). and \\"what we have to do every so often in America ... is save capitalism from itself.\\" Noting that the U.S. economy has performed better under Democratic presidents than Republican ones since World War II, Clinton has said: \\"The economy does better when you have a Democrat in the White House and that's why we need to have a Democrat in the White House in January 2017.\\" Analysis by Max Ehrenfreund in The Washington Post noted that Clinton's statement was accurate but also noted it was difficult to say how much credit the White House could take for such economic upturns; or if other factors boost the economy and Democrats \\"just got lucky\\".Max Ehrenfreund, Hillary Clinton was right: The economy has done better under Democrats, The Washington Post (October 13, 2015). In March 2016, she laid out a detailed economic plan, which The New York Times called \\"optimistic\\" and \\"wide-ranging\\". Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a \\"clawback\\" which would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an \\"exit tax\\" on companies that move their headquarters out of America in order to pay a lower tax rate overseas. = Child care = In 2015, Clinton proposed to cap the expenses that a household spends on child care by at 10 percent of a household's income. Clinton intended to accomplish the 10 percent cap with tax credits and subsidized child care. = Financial regulation and Wall Street reform = Clinton called for more robust financial regulation early on in the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08. Clinton specifically called for regulations to crack down on financial derivatives and subprime mortgages and strengthen oversight of financial institutions and private-equity markets.Lauren Carroll, Hillary Clinton says she called for Wall Street regulations early in the financial crisis, PolitiFact (July 15, 2015).Nicholas Confessore & Amy Chozick, Wall Street Offers Clinton a Thorny Embrace, The New York Times (July 7, 2014). In a 2007 speech, Clinton \\"called for major federal intervention in the market for subprime loans, arguing that 'we need to acknowledge that Wall Street has played a significant role in our current problems, and in particular the housing crisis.'\\" Clinton supported the subsequent Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, a major overhaul of U.S. financial regulations enacted in the wake of the Great Recession.Jonathan Allen, Hillary Clinton Defends Dodd-Frank, Bloomberg Politics (January 16, 2015).Zachary Warmbrodt, Barney Frank advising Clinton on Wall Street plan, Politico (October 7, 2015). Several key architects and supports of the Dodd-Frank Act, including Barney Frank and Gary Gensler, are Clinton supporters who advise her on financial regulations during her 2016 campaign. Clinton has proposed to impose a tax on types of high-frequency trading that she describes as \\"harmful\\". Her official platform says, \\"In particular, the tax would hit HFT strategies involving excessive levels of order cancellations, which make our markets less stable and less fair.\\" On December 7, 2015, in a New York Times op-ed, Clinton outlined her plans for regulating Wall Street. Clinton wrote: \\"As president, I would not only veto any legislation that would weaken financial reform, but I would also fight for tough new rules, stronger enforcement and more accountability that go well beyond Dodd-Frank.\\" Clinton also called for an enhanced Volcker rule that would close \\"loopholes that still allow banks to make speculative gambles with taxpayer-backed deposits.\\" Clinton does not support reinstating the Glass- Steagall Act, a law (repealed in 1999) that mandated the separation of commercial and investment banks,Dan Merica, Clinton dismisses reinstating Glass-Steagall, CNN (October 6, 2015).Linda Qiu, O'Malley: Hillary Clinton doesn't want to reinstate Glass-Steagall, PolitiFact (October 22, 2015).Mark Thoma, Clinton on Glass-Steagall: Right or wrong?, CBS Bews (November 16, 2015). preferring instead other tools to combat systemic risk, including \\"a 'risk fee' on the financial institutions with assets over $50 billion, regulations on the 'shadow banking' sector (i.e. hedge funds) and guidelines for prosecuting financial wrongdoing.\\" Clinton has received criticism for her ties with Wall Street. Her claim in April 2016 that \\"I'm the only candidate in the Democratic primary, or actually on either side, who Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are actually running ads against,\\" received a \\"Pants on Fire\\" rating from PolitiFact. The fact checking service found that all the candidates had been the target of attacks by \\"Wall Street funded groups\\", and that Trump had received the most Wall Street funded attacks of all the presidential candidates. Also the Clinton-affiliated super PAC, Priorities USA Action, received a third of its contributions from the financial industry.Linda Qiu, Hillary Clinton's absurd claim that she's the only candidate being attacked by Wall Street, PolitiFact (April 3, 2016) According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Clinton received 53 percent of campaign contributions from Wall Street in March 2016, up from 32 percent and 33 percent in January and February respectively. = Fiscal policy and taxation = In a May 2016 report, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) estimated that Clinton's \\"proposals would cost $1.80 trillion over a decade with interest, and they would be nearly fully paid for with $1.60 trillion of offsets ‚Äì primarily from taxes on high earners.\\"2016 Fiscal Fact Check: Adding Up Secretary Clinton's Campaign Proposals So Far, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (May 2, 2016). Among the major initiatives proposed by Clinton are the enactment of the \\"New College Compact\\"; an expansion of the Affordable Care Act; an expansion of early childhood education and paid family leave; increased spending on infrastructure, increased funding for veterans, and expanded research funding. The CRFB concluded that \\"Secretary Clinton's policies would not substantially add to current law debt levels\\" but would keep debt at historically high post-war levels, which are currently on track to increase from 74% of GDP in 2015 to 86% in 2026. A December 2015 analysis by McClatchy newspapers similarly concluded that Clinton's proposals \\"would cost at least $1.1 trillion over 10 years as she looks to pump billions of additional dollars into reducing college costs, increasing treatment for drug addiction and helping employers pay for mandatory family and sick leave,\\" mostly offset by new revenue.Anita Kumar, Clinton plan: $1 trillion in new spending, $1 trillion in new taxes, McClatchy (December 22, 2015). During her 2016 campaign for the presidency, Clinton has pledged not to raise taxes on working and middle-class families, defined as those with annual incomes below $250,000. Clinton's pledge has been controversial within the Democratic Party.Sam Frizell, Hillary Clinton's Middle-Class Tax Pledge Divides Democrats, Time (November 25, 2015).Matthew Yglesias, Hillary Clinton's pledge to avoid middle-class tax hikes is bad news for progressive politics, Vox (December 19, 2015). In April 2016, Clinton expressed support for taxes on sugary drinks, a policy opposed by Clinton's primary rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, who opposes such taxes and contends that they would violate Clinton's pledge not to raises taxes of families with incomes below $250,000.Margot Sanger-Katz, A New Policy Disagreement Between Clinton and Sanders: Soda Taxes, The New York Times (April 22, 2016). A Coca- Cola executive later said that she had received assurances from the Clinton campaign that they would no longer comment on the soda tax.Belluz, Julia. \\"Cola tried to sway Hillary Clinton on a soda tax,\\" Vox. Oct 26, 2016, 12:40pm. Retrieved October 28, 2016. A March 2016 analysis by the Urban- Brookings Tax Policy Center summarized Clinton's tax proposals as follows: \\"Hillary Clinton proposes raising taxes on high-income taxpayers, modifying taxation of multinational corporations, repealing fossil fuel tax incentives, and increasing estate and gift taxes. Her proposals would increase revenue by $1.1 trillion over the next decade. Nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent; the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes. Marginal tax rates would increase, reducing incentives to work, save, and invest, and the tax code would become more complex. The analysis does not address a forthcoming proposal to cut taxes for low- and middle-income families.\\"Richard C. Auxier, Leonard E. Burman, James R. Nunns & Jeffrey Rohaly, Research Report: An Analysis of Hillary Clinton's Tax Proposals, Tax Policy Center (March 3, 2016). Clinton specifically has proposed a 4% surcharge on taxpayers earning over $5 million a year; a 30% minimum tax rate on millionaires, defined as those with adjusted gross incomes above $1 million (the \\"Buffett Rule\\"), a 28% cap on most deductions, and increased taxes on long-term capital gains. The proposal also increases several business taxes, and seeks to penalize excessive risk-taking in the financial sector while at the same time creating incentives for business programs that would help workers and communities in distress.Linda Qiu, PolitiFact's guide to the 2016 presidential candidate tax plans, PolitiFact (April 7, 2016).Tami Luhby, Conservative group: Clinton tax plan would hit top 1%, economic growth, CNN (January 26, 2016) The Tax Policy Center estimates that Clinton's plan, on average; would: leave the poorest earners' taxes essentially unchanged; increase middle-income households' taxes by $44 (a 0.001% change); increase the top 1%'s taxes by $78,000; and increase the top 0.1%'s taxes by $520,000. Clinton has proposed a number of new tax credits.Richard Rubin & Laura Meckler, Clinton's Proposed Tax Credits Expand, The Wall Street Journal (November 23, 2015). Clinton has proposed a new caregiver tax credit of up to $1,200. Clinton has also proposed a tax credit for up to $5,000 per family to those paying out-of-pocket healthcare costs in excess of 5 percent of their annual incomeJulie Rovner, Does Hillary Clinton Have The Prescription For Out-Of-Pocket Health Costs?, NPR (September 25, 2015). and a tax credit aimed at families paying for college. Clinton has also proposed to simplify tax filings for small businesses, citing research showing that small businesses currently spend 20 times more per employee to prepare their taxes. In December 2015, Clinton outlined a plan to crack down on the use of corporate tax inversions.Kate Gibson, Hillary Clinton says no to corporate tax inversions, CBS News (December 9, 2015).Hillary Clinton targets corporate inversion with new 'exit tax' plan, The Guardian (December 7, 2015). Clinton specifically criticized Pfizer's plan to make use of the controversial tax-avoidance maneuver by means of its proposed merger with Allergan. Richard Phillips, senior policy analyst at Citizens for Tax Justice, praised Clinton for her support for limiting inversions (which he described as \\"a loophole through which U.S. companies pretend to be foreign in order to avoid taxes\\"), but criticized her proposal to use the new revenue to reduce corporate taxes, arguing that the revenue should go toward public investments or deficit reduction instead.Richard Phillips, Hillary Clinton's Tax Proposal is Right on Inversions, Wrong on New Tax Cuts , Citizens for Tax Justice/Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (December 11, 2015). Clinton has expressed support for stripping tax benefits from companies that outsource jobs overseas. Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said that Clinton's proposals \\"would make the tax code more complex, especially for high-income households, and would reduce incentives to work, save, and invest.\\"Howard Gleckman, Hillary Clinton Would Raise Taxes On High-Income Households By $1.1 Trillion Over 10 Years, TaxVox (Tax Policy Center) (March 3, 2016). Reprinted at The Christian Science Monitor (March 5, 2016). The conservative Tax Foundation estimated in January 2016 that, in the long term, the plan would decrease economic growth by 1%, wages by 0.8% and jobs by 311,000.Kyle Pomerleau & Michael Schuyler, Details and Analysis of Hillary Clinton's Tax Proposals (January 26, 2016). The Tax Foundation estimates an increase in revenues of $498 billion, but applied dynamic scoring analysis to that figure and reduced it to $191 billion due to weaker economic growth. The Clinton campaign \\"said the Tax Foundation's analysis is misleading and doesn't take into account her tax relief for businesses and individuals, nor her investments that would promote growth.\\" In a 2005 fund-raising speech in San Francisco, she was highly critical of the George W. Bush tax cuts, saying that \\"Many of you are well enough off that ... the tax cuts may have helped you. We're saying that for America to get back on track, we're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you. We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good.\\" In January 2008 Clinton called upon Congress to pass an economic stimulus package totaling as much as $110 billion, to deal with the effects of a possible recession. The package would consist of funds to help deal with the effect of the subprime mortgage crisis, to help lower-income families pay for higher home energy costs, to extend unemployment insurance, and to possibly provide some tax refunds. = Health care = A 2016 RAND Corporation report analyzed four of Clinton's major proposed health-care policies and concluded that their combined effect, relative to current law, would be \\"to increase the number of insured by 9.1 million and increase the federal deficit by $88.5 billion.\\" The report found that Clinton's plans would lower expenses, mainly for low- and moderate-income people; the greatest reductions in out-of-pocket spending under Clinton's plan would benefit Americans with incomes between 139 and 250 percent of the federal poverty level (i.e., $33,534 to $60,750 for a family of four).  Medicaid  Her 2016 plan proposes to encourage states to expand Medicaid by giving each signatory state a 100% match for the first three years. Her 2016 plan proposes an investment of $500 million per year in advertisement to encourage those eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled to enroll.  Medicare  Under Clinton's 2016 health care plan, people over 55 years old would be allowed to buy into Medicare if they wanted to. Currently, only those age 65 and over are covered by under Medicare. According to experts consulted by PolitiFact, nothing in Clinton's health care plan would undermine Medicare or harm current beneficiaries. Clinton supports allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices.  Mental health  On mental health, Clinton has proposed investing in brain and behavioral science research; fully enforcing existing laws that require mental health coverage to be an essential benefit in health insurance plans; creating a national suicide prevention initiative; expanding the reimbursement structures in Medicare and Medicaid; tasking the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to create and implement the new payment models; emphasizing; treatment over jail for low-level criminal offenders with mental health issues; and creating new housing and job opportunities for mentally ill Americans. Clinton's plan states that \\"the next generation must grow up knowing that mental health is a key component of overall health and there is no shame, stigma, or barriers to seeking out care.\\" As Senator, Clinton sponsored the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, which requires that limits on mental health benefits to be no lower than the limits for medical and surgical benefits offered by health insurance plans.  Other  Clinton supported a 2007 proposal to increase funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program by $35 billion over five years.  Prescription drugs  Clinton has proposed to redirect subsidies that go to direct-to-consumer drug company advertising to research and development of drugs. According to her plan, health insurance plans will be required to place a monthly limit of $250 on covered out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for individuals. She proposes to \\"fully fund the FDA's Office of Generic Drugs to clear out their multi-year generic drug approval backlog.\\" She proposes to lower the exclusivity period of \\"biologics\\" from 12 to 7 years to \\"spur greater competition\\" and save government spending. Her prescription drug plan says that she will seek to prohibit \\"pay for delay\\" arrangements, referring to arrangements where patent holders make payments to potential competitors to stop them from entering the market with generic drugs. In June 2015, when TPP was still being negotiated, Clinton said that drug firms that benefit from deal should offer discounts. One of her stated reasons for opposing the final version of the TPP agreement is that it puts \\"the interests of drug companies ahead of patients and consumers\\".  Universal health care and the Affordable Care Act  In a speech to Harvard Medical School on June 4, 1998, Clinton outlined general support for federal universal affordable health care for Americans. \\"There are 41 million people without health insurance. Who will take care of these people in the future? How will we pay for their care? How will we pay for the extra costs that come when someone is not treated for a chronic disease or turned away from the emergency room? The job of health care reform cannot be done when access to care depends on skin color or the neighborhood they live in or the amount of money in their wallet. Let's continue to work toward universal affordable, quality health care.\\" Reportedly, Clinton expressed support when she was First Lady for universal single-payer health care in the U.S. during multiple private conversations, while sometimes indicating that she believed such an approach would not be politically tenable.\\"Clinton visits New Haven, stresses health care plan\\", The News-Times (February 4, 2008). Clinton later said that health care coverage improvements need to be made incrementally, in contrast to the more ambitious, wide-ranging plan that failed in 1993 to 1994. In September 2007, as part of her presidential campaign, Clinton proposed her own health system reform plan (dubbed the \\"American Health Choices Plan\\"), which would require that individuals have health care coverage from some source. Clinton explained that the coverage options available would be enrollment in private insurance plans via an \\"individual mandate\\" and an \\"employer mandate\\" requiring employers to provide health care benefits, or enrollment in a public program via an expanded version of Medicare or federal employee health plans. The projected cost of the plan was $110 billion annually and would require all employers to cover their employees' health insurance or contribute to the costs of their employees' health insurance coverage; tax credits will be provided to companies with fewer than 25 employees to help cover costs.\\"Clinton Sees Better Chances for Health Overhaul\\". NPR. September 18, 2007. Retrieved September 18, 2007. In order to pay for the program's estimated $110 billion per year cost, Clinton favored repealing some of the Bush tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000. In January 2016, Clinton said that single-payer healthcare \\"will never, ever come to pass.\\" She does not disagree with the idea of single-payer healthcare (which she has advocated in the past), finding it instead impractical. She proposes to defend the Affordable Care Act from efforts to repeal it; she will build upon it. In July 2016, Clinton proposed to make Affordable Care Act funding for Federally Qualified Health Centers (such as community health centers) permanent, and expand the funding by $40 billion over the next 10 years. Clinton claimed during a debate in January 2016 that \\"We now have driven (health care) costs down to the lowest they've been in 50 years\\". PolitiFact rated this statement \\"false,\\" noting that \\"although the rate of growth has been at historic lows, the actual per-person cost of health care has increased steadily over the last half century.\\" =Public option= Clinton supports federal and state efforts to create Medicare-like \\"public option\\" health insurance plans to compete against private insurers. According to a RAND Corporation study, Clinton's public option would provide insurance to 400,000 additional Americans and reduce the deficit by $700 million.  Vaccines  According to Vox, of the top four 2016 presidential candidates (Clinton, Donald Trump, Gary Johnson, and Jill Stein), Clinton is \\"the only candidate not pandering to the anti-vaccine movement\\" and the only candidate with views on vaccines that are consistent with the scientific consensus.German Lopez, Hillary Clinton is now the only candidate not pandering to the anti-vaccine movement, Vox (August 1, 2016). During her campaign, Clinton has written: \\"Through vaccinations and vaccine science, I am committed to protecting our nation's children, as well as populations worldwide, from infectious disease threats.\\" Clinton has said that if elected president, she will work globally toward the elimination of vaccine-preventable infections such as measles, whooping cough, and diphtheria and domestically to \\"educate parents about vaccines, focusing on their extraordinary track record in saving lives and pointing out the dangers of not vaccinating our children.\\" Clinton has criticized Republicans who have called vaccine science into question, writing, \\"The earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork. Let's protect all our kids.\\"Karen Tumulty, Vaccine debate presents a political minefield ‚Äî as Hillary Clinton can attest, The Washington Post (February 4, 2015).Catalina Camia, Hillary Clinton: The earth is round and vaccines work, USA Today (February 3, 2015). On a candidates' questionnaire in 2008, when asked whether \\"vaccines should be investigated as a possible cause of autism?,\\" Clinton wrote: \\"I am committed to make investments to find the causes of autism, including possible environmental causes like vaccines. ... We don't know what, if any, kind of link there is between vaccines and autism ‚Äî but we should find out.\\" This statement was made two years before 2010, when a study published in 1998 alleging that the MMR vaccine caused autism was retracted after it was found to have been fraudulent. In 1993, as first lady, Clinton was a key supporter of the program that became the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vaccines for Children program, which provides free inoculations for eligible children.Sara Fritz & Alan C. Miller, Clinton Plan for Immunization Raises Questions, Los Angeles Times (July 17, 1994). = Jobs, labor, and employment =Job creation An independent report by Moody's Analytics issued in 2016 found that Clinton's proposals would, if enacted, create 10.4 million jobs during a four-year presidential term (3.2 million more than expected under current law). The report used a forecasting model similar to those used by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Federal Reserve. Clinton has proposed to put her husband Bill \\"in charge of revitalizing the economy\\" in her administration, citing economic growth under his Presidency (1993‚Äì2001). Infrastructure Her 2016 official platform claims that investments in \\"infrastructure, clean energy, and scientific and medical research\\" will create jobs during her administration. In November 2015, her five-year, $275-billion federal infrastructure program \\"aimed at creating middle-class jobs\\" was described by the New York Times as \\"the most sprawling ‚Äî and costliest ‚Äî government program of her campaign to date\\". She has proposed a $30 billion plan for coal-producing areas, which is partly intended to help displaced coal workers find new jobs. Regulations and licensing In her book Hard Choices, Clinton wrote that there were regulatory hurdles for businesses to create jobs in America and India, saying, \\"There were still too many barriers and restrictions, but American companies were slowly gaining access to Indian markets, creating jobs and opportunities for people in both countries.\\" Clinton proposes to reduce unnecessary occupational licensing requirements to ease burdens on small business owners. She argues that this will help small businesses, in particular, by reducing the time and costs associated with licensing. She has proposed to incentivize states and localities to make licensing cheaper, easier and streamlined by providing federal funding to support innovative programs and offset forgone licensing revenue. She says she will work with states to standardize licensing requirements and reduce barriers for Americans seeking to work across state borders. Labor unions While a U.S. senator, Clinton \\"was a reliable labor ally, co-sponsoring, for instance, the pro-labor Employee Free Choice Act ('card check'), which cleared the House in 2007, 241-185, but was filibustered in the Senate.\\"Brian Mahoney, Clinton clinches labor majority, Politico (October 23, 2015). During her 2016 campaign, Clinton has pledged to \\"restore collective bargaining rights for unions and defend against partisan attacks on workers' rights.\\"Labor and workers‚Äô rights: When unions are strong, America is strong, Hillary for America (last. Retrieved September 17, 2016). In August 2016, Clinton said that \\"strengthening unions doesn't just serve members ‚Äì it leads to better pay, and benefits, and working conditions for all employees.\\" According to NPR, there is evidence to support that assertion.  Manufacturing  Clinton has stated that \\"manufacturing is critical to the U.S. economy.\\" Clinton wants to create tax incentives to encourage investment in communities that face significant manufacturing job losses, and has proposed a tax penalty for companies that move jobs or production overseas. She has said that she will \\"aggressively [combat] trade violations\\" by other countries. Clinton has pledged to build and expand upon President Obama's support for a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation, which focuses on developing and commercializing manufacturing technologies through public-private partnerships between U.S. industry, universities, and federal agencies. Minimum wage During her 2016 campaign, Clinton proposed raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour.Lauren Carroll, Does Hillary Clinton want a $15 or $12 minimum wage?, PolitiFact (April 15, 2016). Clinton has expressed support for the \\"Fight for $15\\" campaign for higher minimum wages in individual states and cities (such as New York, Los Angeles, Detroit and St. Louis). At a Democratic primary debate in 2016, Clinton said that if Congress passes a bill for a $15 federal minimum wage, she would sign it. She explained her decision to support a $12 an hour federal minimum wage by invoking the research of Princeton professor Alan Krueger. As a Senator, Clinton voted for an increase in the federal minimum wage. In 2014, Clinton said: \\"Don't let anyone tell you that raising the minimum wage will kill jobs ‚Äì they always say that. I've been through this. My husband gave workers a raise in the 1990s. I voted to raise the minimum wage and guess what, millions of jobs were created or paid better and more families were secure.\\" She followed that statement by saying \\"[a]nd don't let anybody tell you that it's corporations and businesses that create jobs. You know that old theory, trickle-down economics. That has been tried, that has failed. It has failed rather spectacularly.\\" She has described the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 as a \\"starvation wage\\". Paid family leave Clinton supports 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave at a minimum two-thirds wage replacement rate. She would pay for this plan with increased taxes on the wealthy. She opposes pending similar legislation, called the Family Act, because it relies on a small increase to the payroll tax. = Social Security = Clinton opposes cutting Social Security. She instead supports an expansion of Social Security: boosting survivor benefits and creating a caregiver benefit for those who left the paid workforce to care for children, parents or ailing family members. Her expansion of Social Security has been criticized by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee for not going far enough. Clinton opposes a raise in the retirement age. In 2008, Clinton supporting retaining the cap on the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax, the payroll tax which funds Social Security and Medicare. Under the cap at that time, the FICA tax applied to income up to $102,000, with income in excess of this amount (earned by the top 6% of income-earners) not taxable. Clinton said that a repeal of the FICA tax cap would amount to a \\"tax increase on the middle class.\\" = Student loans = Clinton's plan for student debt relief is to allow those carrying existing student debt to refinance their student loans at current rates available to students taking out new loans. The Clinton campaign asserts that her plan \\"will cost around $350 billion over 10 years‚Äîand will be fully paid for by limiting certain tax expenditures for high-income taxpayers.\\" The campaign estimates that 25 million borrowers will obtain relief, with the average borrower saving about $2,000 in total. Clinton proposes to permit start-up founders and early employees to forgo payments on their federal student loans for up to three years. Those who launch businesses that provide social benefits would also be permitted to apply for forgiveness of up to $17,500 of their debt after five years. = Subprime mortgage crisis relief = On December 5, 2007, Clinton unveiled her plan to ameliorate the effects of the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis on homeowners. She called for a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures, in order that lenders and mortgage servicers have sufficient time to get through paperwork complications and an expected high volume of troubled borrowers without having to shut out the lights, and a five-year freeze on the interest rates of adjustable rate mortgages, so that borrowers would not get slammed by expected 30, 40 or more percent increases in monthly payments due to the effects of the crisis and of unwise initial borrowing decisions. In late 2008, Clinton voted for the Troubled Asset Relief Program which provided $350 million to purchase toxic assets and equity from financial institutions to strengthen the financial sector during the subprime mortgage crisis. Clinton claimed during a nationally televised townhall meeting in February 2016 that \\"You are three times more likely to be able to get a mortgage if you're a white applicant than if you're black or Hispanic, even if you have the same credentials.\\" PolitiFact rated this claim \\"false,\\" noting \\"while there is evidence of disparities in mortgage acceptance rates by race ... Experts say the gaps are not as drastic as Clinton says once you equalize for other key factors, such as income and credit history.\\" = Trade = Clinton opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and holds that \\"any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security\\". As Senator (2001‚Äì2009), her record on trade was mixed, voting in favor of some trade agreements but not others. She favors Trade Adjustment Assistance, a measure that would help retrain and provide aid to workers displaced by globalization.  NAFTA  During the 1993 internal debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement, Clinton made clear her feeling that its passage was getting higher priority within the administration than it should, especially compared to the Clinton health care reform plan. By most accounts, Clinton was also unenthusiastic about the merits of the agreement, believing it would cause a loss of American jobs and would be politically unpopular. Once her husband decided to proceed with NAFTA, Clinton as First Lady participated in at least five meetings at the White House aimed at securing Congressional passage of the agreement, which Gergen and former official Robert J. Shapiro felt showed she had been a \\"good soldier\\" in getting behind a settled decision, but which other attendees interpreted as showing Clinton was in fact behind the agreement. During later years of the administration and in her memoir, Clinton touted her husband's support for NAFTA. Clinton has since 2008 repeatedly called for renegotiating the \\"core labor and environmental standards\\" of NAFTA. During her 2008 presidential campaign, Clinton repeatedly criticized the NAFTA agreement, despite it being one of the major achievements of her husband's administration. She said, \\"NAFTA did not do what many had hoped. NAFTA was a mistake to the extent that it did not deliver on what we had hoped it would.\\" She did say that she believed in the underlying idea behind trade agreements such as NAFTA: \\"I believe in the general principles it represented. But what we have learned is that we have to drive a tougher bargain. Our market is the market that everybody wants to be in. We should quit giving it away so willy-nilly. I believe we need tougher enforcement of the trade agreements we already have.\\" She promised that if elected, she would work to implement changes to it that would benefit American workers, saying \\"I want to be a president who focuses on smart, pro-American trade. I will review every trade agreement. I'm going to ask for revisions that I think will actually benefit our country, particularly our workers, our exporters ... And NAFTA will be part of that review, to try to reform and improve it.\\"  Other  In 2005, while representing New York in the U.S. Senate, Clinton said: \\"During my tenure as senator, I have voted for every trade agreement that has come before the Senate, and I believe that properly negotiated trade agreements can increase living standards and foster openness and economic development for all parties.\\" Later in 2005, Clinton voted against the Central America Free Trade Agreement, believing that it did not provide adequate environmental or labor standards. As Secretary of State, Clinton adhered to the position of the Obama administration on the United States‚ÄìColombia Free Trade Agreement, supporting the agreement that she had opposed in the 2008 campaign given her \\"concerns about the history of violence towards trade unionists in Colombia\\". Clinton, together with fellow New York Senator Charles Schumer, welcomed a 2006 decision by the United States Commerce Department that called for a 108.3% duty on imports from Chinese candlemakers, as the imports sought to circumvent an Anti-dumping Duty Order. Clinton stated, \\"This is a real victory for the Syracuse candle-making industry.\\" Clinton supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank, a decades-old trade promotion agency. She has asserted that \\"across our country, the Export-Import Bank supports up to 164,000 jobs.\\" In August 2016, Clinton promised to create a new position of trade prosecutor and to triple the number of enforcers. In the same speech, she said that \\"China and other countries have gamed the system for too long\\",\\"Enforcement ‚Äî especially during the Bush administration ‚Äî has been too lax\\" and that \\"Investments at home that would make us more competitive have been blocked.\\" She said, however, that \\"the answer is not to rant and rave ‚Äì or to cut ourselves off from the world. That would kill even more jobs.\\"  Trans-Pacific Partnership  Former top Obama adviser David Axelrod said on MSNBC that when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, she \\"owned\\" the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). During her tenure as Secretary of State, she spoke of the TPP negotiations in glowing terms: \\"exciting,\\" \\"innovative,\\" \\"ambitious,\\" \\"groundbreaking,\\" \\"cutting-edge,\\" \\"high-quality,\\" \\"high-standard\\" and \\"gold standard.\\" During a 2012 visit to Australia, Clinton referred to the TPP as \\"the gold standard in trade agreements.\\" In February 2013, Clinton left her job with the general framework of TPP in place. In her 2014 memoir Hard Choices, she wrote: In an April 2015 presidential campaign stop in New Hampshire, Clinton said, \\"Any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security\\". Upon the completion of the TPP negotiations in October 2015, Clinton stated her opposition to the TPP, indicating that the final agreement did not meet the high standards she had set for such agreements. PolitiFact rules her shifting stance on TPP as a flip-flop. In August 2016, Clinton said, \\"I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages ‚Äì including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as president.\\" Clinton has named former Senator Ken Salazar, who is a prominent supporter of TPP, to chair her presidential transition team.  Energy and environment policy  Clinton supports energy conservation, releasing oil reserves, increasing the number of hydrogen-powered vehicles, and ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. She opposes drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Bush administration's energy policy. Clinton supports cap-and- trade, which allows companies to trade carbon credits, seeks an 80% carbon cut by 2050, seeks a 10% national energy reduction by 2020, advocates a zero emission policy for federal buildings by 2030, calls for raising gas mileage standards to within 10 years (having indicated a willingness to use administrative power if Congress fails to act on this), and opposes drilling in the Atlantic. Clinton was endorsed by the League of Conservation Voters in 2015. = Climate change and renewable energy = Clinton accepts the scientific consensus on climate change and criticizes climate-change deniers \\"who still refuse to accept the settled science of climate change.\\" Clinton called climate change \\"an urgent threat\\" and \\"the most consequential, urgent, sweeping collection of challenges we face as a nation and a world.\\"Renee Cho, Trump vs. Clinton: What the Election Could Mean for Climate Policy, The Earth Institute, Columbia University (May 18, 2016). Clinton writes in her memoir Hard Choices that during her tenure in the State Department she played an instrumental role in the push toward an enforceable international agreement to reduce carbon emissions.Clinton, Hard Choices, chap. 21. In December 2009, as secretary of state, Clinton endorsed a climate-change adaption plan, stating: \\"The United States is prepared to work with other countries toward a goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion a year by 2020 to address the climate change needs of developing countries.\\" The commitment was welcomed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others as a solid first step, although the European Union made a more ambitious proposal for 100 billion euros a year (44% higher than the value Clinton mentioned). Clinton did not say specifically how much the U.S. would contribute, but did say that U.S. funding of climate-change mitigation efforts would be conditional upon China and other nations agreeing to \\"transparency\\" and verification of cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.Janet Raloff, U.S. backs $100-billion-a-year plan for climate adaptation: U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived at the climate talks December 17, Science News (December 17, 2009). In July 2015, Clinton set forth two ambitious renewable energy goals for the United States: to generate enough clean renewable energy to power every U.S. home within ten years after taking office, and to install 500 million solar panels within her first term.In Their Own Words: 2016 Presidential Candidates on Renewable Energy , League of Conservation Voters (May 10, 2016).Alana Wise, Hillary Clinton sets renewable energy goals to spur more wind, solar power, Reuters (July 27, 2015). Clinton aims to generate one-third of America's electricity from renewable sources by 2027.James West, This Chart Shows Where All the Candidates Stand on the World's Biggest Issue, Mother Jones (October 30, 2015) Clinton said in February 2016 that these proposals aim to \\"move from fossil fuels to clean energy ... in a quick, but thoughtful way\\" and to \\"reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30 percent in 2025 relative to 2005 levels and chart a path to cut emissions more than 80 percent by 2050.\\" Clinton states: \\"I want more wind, more solar, more advanced biofuels, more energy efficiency.\\" Clinton supports the wind energy production tax credit and has called for making it permanent, and in the past has praised efforts to use vegetable oils as alternative energy. Clinton has emphasized the jobs that renewable energy creates, saying in an April 2016 town-hall event broadcast on MSNBC that the U.S. must \\"use clean renewable energy to create more jobs.\\" Clinton has said that \\"somebody is going to be the 21st century clean energy superpower. It's either going to be China, Germany or us. I want it to be us because there will be a lot of jobs, again, that have to be done right here in America.\\" On one occasion in December 2015, Clinton stated that \\"we now have more jobs in solar than we do in oil\\"; PolitiFact found that this was not true, although the number of workers in the oil and gas industry has been declining while the number of workers employees in the solar industry has increased. Clinton has praised the international Paris Agreement reached at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, saying: \\"The Paris agreement is testament to America's ability to lead the world in building a clean energy future where no one is left out or left behind ... as president, I will make combating climate change a top priority from day one, and secure America's future as the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.\\" Clinton has promised to implement the U.S. commitment to the Paris Agreement. In her official 2016 presidential platform, Clinton proposes to: While in the Senate, Clinton had long opposed ethanol subsidies before she introduced a bill in May 2006 to create a $50 billion fund to expand the use of ethanol and other alternative fuels. In 2007, Clinton expressed support for corn ethanol as a biofuel. In August 2015, the Clinton campaign said that she would \\"strengthen\\" the Renewable Fuel Standard to promote development of advanced biofuels and access to ethanol products. =Fossil fuels= Coal  During a debate in March 2016, Clinton said that \\"we need\\" to implement \\"all of the president's executive actions\\" on the environment and that we need to \\"quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to clean energy.\\" Speaking at a CNN town hall forum in March 2016, Clinton said: \\"I'm the only candidate which has a policy about how to bring economic opportunity using clean renewable energy as the key into coal country. Because we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business, right? And we're going to make it clear that we don't want to forget those people. Those people labored in those mines for generations, losing their health, often losing their lives to turn on our lights and power our factories. Now we've got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don't want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on.\\"Lauren Carroll, In context: Hillary Clinton's comments about coal jobs, PolitiFact (May 10, 2016). When confronted about her \\"out of business\\" statement while campaigning in West Virginia, Clinton stated \\"I don't know how to explain it other than what I said was totally out of context for what I meant because I have been talking about helping coal country for a very long time. It was a misstatement because what I was saying is the way things are going now, they will continue to lose jobs. It didn't mean that we were going to do it. What I said is that is going to happen unless we take action to help and prevent it.\\"Martina Stewart, Emotional unemployed W.Va. coal worker confronts Hillary Clinton over comment about putting coal 'out of business', The Washington Post (May 3, 2016). She has a $30 billion plan intended to revitalize coal communities and aid them in the transition away from coal. The plan calls for increased job training, small-business development, and infrastructure investment, especially in Appalachia. The plan also seeks to safeguard miners' healthcare and pensions. Fracking Clinton supports allowing hydraulic fracturing (fracking) but only when it meets her conditions regarding local choice, stronger environmental regulation and chemicals. In a March 2016 debate, Clinton outlined her position as follows: \\"I don't support it when any locality or any state is against it, No. 1. I don't support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I don't support it ‚Äî No. 3 ‚Äî unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using. So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. And I think that's the best approach, because right now, there are places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated.\\" According to PolitiFact, the implementation of Clinton's three conditions \\"would uphold existing bans and add new ones to the mix.\\" PolitiFact notes that there are 11 states with noted cases of spills (which could be covered under her second condition) and two fracking states where there are no rules on chemical disclosure on the books (which would be covered under her third condition). As Secretary of State under President Obama, Clinton promoted fracking services by American companies to various countries as \\"part of a broader push to fight climate change, boost global energy supply, and undercut the power of adversaries such as Russia that use their energy resources as a cudgel.\\" Keystone XL pipeline In 2010, Clinton stated that she was inclined to support the issuance by the State Department of a cross-border permit for the Northern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline. Through June 2015, she delayed announcing her position on the pipeline, noting that as Secretary of State, she had set in motion the review process a number of years previously to evaluate the pipeline, and preferred to allow time for her successor John Kerry, and President Obama to make the decision. \\"I will refrain from commenting because I had a leading role in getting that process started,\\" Clinton had said, \\"and I think that we have to let it run its course.\\"Colleen McCain Nelson - \\"Hillary Clinton Sidesteps Keystone in Climate Plan Rollout\\", The Wall Street Journal, July 27, 2015.. Retrieved July 28, 2015 In September 2015, Clinton announced her opposition to Keystone. The Keystone XL pipeline was officially rejected by Secretary of State Kerry and President Obama in November 2015. PolitiFact found that Clinton had not flip-flopped on the issue.  Dakota Access Pipeline  In a Los Angeles Times op-ed in September 2016, Democratic platform member Bill McKibben was critical of the disparity between the Democratic platform ‚Äì which calls for recognition of the \\"right of all tribes to protect their lands, air, and waters\\" ‚Äì and Clinton's silence on the issue. In October 2016, young Native American activists met outside of Clinton headquarters in Brooklyn to protest her lack of a position on continued pipeline construction and to give her a letter. In an email to Democracy now!, campaign spokesperson Tyrone Gayle said that everyone should be heard on federal infrastructure agreements, a position that Bill McKibben characterized as \\"say[ing] literally nothing\\". = Nuclear power = Clinton wants to renew permits for existing nuclear power plants that are safe to operate and increase public investment in advanced nuclear power. At a February 2007 campaign rally in Columbia, South Carolina, Clinton stated, \\"I think nuclear power has to be part of our energy solution ... We get about 20% of our energy from nuclear power in our country ... other countries like France get much much more, so we do have to look at it because it doesn't put greenhouse gas emissions into the air.\\" Subsequently, in a July 2007 Democratic debate, when asked about nuclear power as an alternative energy source, she said, \\"I'm agnostic about nuclear power. Until we figure out what we're going to do with the waste and the cost, it's very hard to see nuclear as a part of our future. But that's where American technology comes in. Let's figure out what we're going to do about the waste and the cost if we think nuclear should be a part of the solution.\\"Part II: CNN/YouTube Democratic presidential debate transcript (July 23, 2007). In Democratic primary debates in 2016, Clinton said that she supported greater oversight of the Indian Point nuclear power plant, which had experienced calls for closure following leaks and other problems.Alan Yuhas, New York nuclear plant's future further divides Sanders and Clinton, The Guardian (April 7, 2016). Clinton said any action \\"needs to be done in a careful, thoughtful way\\" and that: \\"We also have to be realistic and say, 'You get 25% of the electricity in the greater New York City area from Indian Point.' I don't want middle-class taxpayers to see a huge rate increase.\\" = Environment = Evaluating all her votes throughout Clinton's Senate career, the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) has given Clinton a lifetime 82 percent pro- environment action rating. Clinton accepts the scientific consensus on climate change.Ben Adler, 8 things you need to know about Hillary Clinton and climate change, Grist (April 12, 2015). In a December 2014 speech to the LCV, Clinton said, \\"The science of climate change is unforgiving, no matter what the deniers may say. Sea levels are rising; ice caps are melting; storms, droughts and wildfires are wreaking havoc. ... If we act decisively now we can still head off the most catastrophic consequences.\\" Clinton has called climate change \\"the most consequential, urgent, sweeping collection of challenges we face as a nation and a world.\\"Clare Foran, Why Environmentalists Are Anxious About a Hillary Clinton 2016 Run , National Journal (April 10, 2015). In 2007, Clinton co-sponsored the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act (a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade initiative proposed by John McCain and Joseph Lieberman which aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 percent from 2000 levels by 2050) and the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act (a more ambitious plan propose by Bernie Sanders and Barbara Boxer which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent from 2000 levels by 2050).Robert Farley, They have. Yours, in fact, Politfact (May 14, 2008). Clinton's then-colleague Barack Obama also cosponsored both bills. Clinton is a supporter of the Clean Power Plan (proposed by the Obama administration's EPA), which would regulate carbon emissions from power plants. In her speech to the LCV, Clinton stated that \\"the unprecedented action that President Obama has taken must be protected at all costs.\\" Clinton has supported offshore oil drilling, and in 2006 voted for a bill to open new Gulf Coast areas to drilling. In a speech to the AFL-CIO, Clinton stated that she supports a green building fund and green- collar job training. Clinton supports the protection of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and would not allow drilling there. She co-sponsored the Roadless Area Conservation Act. Some environmentalists have expressed concern about the millions of dollars of contributions from major fossil fuel companies accepted by the Clinton Foundation. Clinton opposes issuance by the State Department of a cross-border permit for the Northern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline.Hillary Clinton opposes Keystone XL pipeline By Eric Bradner, Dan Merica and Brianna Keilar, CNN, September 22, 2015. Clinton was endorsed by the Sierra Club in her 2000 Senate campaign.Randal C. Archibold, Hillary Clinton Is Endorsed By Sierra Club as Better Ally, The New York Times (September 6, 2000). = Animal protection = The Humane Society gave Senator Clinton scores of 100 in the 108th and 109th Congresses, and an 83 in the 110th Congress on her actions on legislation that would protect animals. The Humane Society endorsed Clinton in the 2016 Presidential Race, saying that she \\"has a clear, compelling record of support for animal protection\\".  Immigration policy  The Clinton 2016 platform proposes to: * \\"Fight for comprehensive immigration reform legislation with a path to full and equal citizenship.\\" * \\"Defend President Obama's DACA and DAPA executive actions.\\" * Promote the naturalization of the estimated nine million lawful permanent residents in the United States who are eligible to become U.S. citizens. * Support immigrant integration through the creation of a national Office of Immigrant Affairs, $15 million in new grant funding for integration services, and an increase in federal resources for adult English language education and citizenship education. * Conduct more humane and targeted immigration enforcement, by detaining and deporting those individuals who pose a violent threat to public safety; ending family detention and closing private immigrant detention centers. = Legal rights = Clinton's stance on illegal immigration has softened over time.Anita Kumar, As she woos Hispanics, Clinton moves left on immigration, McClatchy Washington Bureau (October 9, 2015). In a 2003 radio appearance, Senator Clinton said: \\"We've got to do several things and I am, you know, adamantly against illegal immigrants. ... Certainly we've got to do more at our borders. And people have to stop employing illegal immigrants.\\" However, also during her time in the Senate, Clinton cosponsored a bipartisan amnesty bill for many illegal workers in the agricultural industry; backed a bill by Senator Edward M. Kennedy that would grant permanent resident status to some illegal immigrants who had been in the country for at least five years and worked for at least two years; and supported college tuition relief for young people who had entered the county illegally. In April 2006, speaking to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Clinton said her work for her New York constituents could fall afoul of the Border Protection, Anti-terrorism and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005, since some of her constituents are illegal immigrants. \\"I realize I would be a criminal, too. My staff would be criminal. We help people with all kinds of problems.\\" On March 8, 2006, she strongly criticized H.R. 4437, a bill passed by the House of Representatives in December 2005 and sent to the Senate, Clinton called the measure \\"a rebuke to what America stands for\\" and said it would be \\"an unworkable scheme to try to deport 11 million people, which you have to have a police state to try to do.\\" She believed the solution to the illegal immigration problem was to make \\"a path to earned citizenship for those who are here, working hard, paying taxes, respecting the law, and willing to meet a high bar for becoming a citizen.\\" In May and June 2007, Clinton cast preliminary votes (in terms of amendments and cloture) in support of the high-profile, compromise-based but very controversial, comprehensive immigration reform bill known as the Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007. When the bill was again brought forward, she continued to vote in favor of cloture motions to consider it. In October 2007, Clinton voted in favor of a small subset of the previous bill, the DREAM Act. In 2007, Clinton called for an increase in the number of H-1B visas. At a debate at Drexel University in Philadelphia on October 30, 2007, Clinton committed to support of New York Governor Eliot Spitzer's plan to give driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. Two minutes later, she recanted the position and blamed the Bush administration for not passing immigration reform. The following day, she clarified her position in a prepared statement by coming out in support of Spitzer's bill. Two weeks later, after Spitzer abandoned the plan due to widespread opposition, Clinton reversed her position on the issue once again, stating: \\"I support Governor Spitzer's decision today to withdraw his proposal. As president, I will not support driver's licenses for undocumented people and will press for comprehensive immigration reform that deals with all of the issues around illegal immigration, including border security and fixing our broken system.\\" On November 16, when asked again if she supported granting driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants, she gave a one-word answer: \\"No.\\" In 2008, Clinton received a rating of \\"D-\\" from Americans for Better Immigration, an anti-immigration organization. In 2014, Clinton stated that children from Central America who entered the United States illegally \\"should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back. But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families.\\" She added: \\"We have to send a clear message. Just because your child gets across the border, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay. We don't want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey.\\" On May 5, 2015, Clinton stated that allowing illegal immigrants to have a path to citizenship \\"is at its heart a family issue.\\" Clinton also \\"sharply criticized Republican presidential candidates who favor granting legal status for some undocumented immigrants, but oppose citizenship,\\" saying: \\"When they talk about 'legal status,' that is code for 'second-class status.'\\" Clinton said that she supported President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which grants undocumented youth (those who entered the U.S. as children) the chance to apply for a stay of deportation. In 2015, Clinton said that she wanted the United States to accept 65,000 Syrian refugees, a significant increase to the 10,000 that the Obama administration pledged to accept. On July 14, 2016, Clinton expressed support for Obama's Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which would allow up to five million undocumented immigrants to gain deferral of deportation and authorization to legally work in the United States, and she promised to expand it.Katie Shepherd & Alan Rappeport, How Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton Compare on the Issues, The New York Times (July 22, 2016).Elise Foley, Hillary Clinton Promises Deportation Relief, Despite Supreme Court Ruling, The Huffington Post (July 14, 2016). = Border barrier = In September 2006, Clinton voted for the Secure Fence Act, authorizing the construction of of fencing along the United States‚ÄìMexico border. In 2015, Clinton said, \\"I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in. And I do think you have to control your borders\\".  Foreign and defense policy =Africa= Libya  Clinton reportedly played a key role in persuading Obama to militarily intervene in Libya during the Libyan Civil War, and deemed it worthwhile to intervene due to fears of further atrocities by Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi; calls to action from Britain, France, and the Arab League; and a belief that the Libyan opposition could govern in the aftermath of an intervention. After the conclusion of the Libyan Civil War and the demise of Gaddafi, there remained factional violence in Libya until it erupted into renewed civil war in 2014. Terrorist groups have taken refuge in Libya, and large numbers of refugees have fled to neighboring countries and across the Mediterranean. When asked to defend her record on Libya, Clinton called it \\"a classic case of a hard choice\\" and found that the overthrow of Gaddafi represented \\"smart power at its best.\\" When told of news reports of Qaddafi's death by an aide in between formal interviews, Clinton laughed and replied with \\"We came, we saw, he died\\". Clinton has said that history's judgment on the intervention, and her role in it, are not yet final. In November 2015, she said to the Council on Foreign Relations that \\"the Libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections for the kind of leadership they want. They have not been able to figure out how to prevent the disruptions that they are confronted with because of internal divides and because of some of the external pressures that are coming from terrorist groups and others. So I think it's too soon to tell. And I think it's something that we have to be, you know, looking at very closely.\\" = Asia = East Asia =China= Clinton described the U.S.-China relationship in Hard Choices as one that does not fit \\"neatly into categories like friend or rival\\". According to the Council on Foreign Relations, \\"Clinton was a central actor in the Obama administration's strategic 'pivot' to Asia\\" during her tenure as Secretary of State. She has criticized China for its cyberattacks and industrial espionage against the U.S., and for behaving in threatening ways towards U.S. allies such as the Philippines. Clinton stated in 2010 that competing maritime claims in the South China Sea were a U.S. national interest: \\"The United States has a national interest in freedom of navigation, open access to Asia's maritime commons and respect for international law in the South China Sea.\\" The Chinese foreign minister responded, saying that \\"remarks were in effect an attack on China\\". Clinton has repeatedly criticized the Chinese government's human rights record. In 2011, for example, she described the Chinese government's human rights record as \\"deplorable\\" and its crackdown on dissent as \\"a fool's errand.\\" Clinton has criticized Chinese leader Xi Jinping's record on gender inequality, accusing the Chinese regime of \\"persecuting feminists,\\" referring to the detention of five Chinese women activists (Wei Tingting and four others) who had campaigned against sexual harassment. As First Lady, she criticized China's one-child policy. She has been criticized by Chinese state media and \\"government-affiliated opinion writers,\\" as well as by Chinese social media commentators, for her forceful human rights critiques and her opposition to China's activities in the South China Sea. In 2008, she called on President Bush to boycott the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics, citing political violence in Tibet and China's failure to pressure Sudan to halt the violence in Darfur. As Secretary of State, Clinton warned against \\"new colonialism\\" in Africa, referring to China's involvement in Africa. On a trip to Africa in 2011, Clinton said that China was not a role model for governance. In a trip to Africa the following year, Clinton launched the trip by contrasting the U.S. commitment to \\"democracy and human rights\\" with rival powers' desire \\"to look the other way and keep the resources flowing\\"‚Äîa comment that was widely interpreted as a veiled attack on China.David Smith, Hillary Clinton launches African tour with veiled attack on China, The Guardian (August 1, 2012). =North Korea= Clinton says that she wants to increase sanctions on North Korea to curtail its nuclear weapons program, urge China to put pressure on North Korea to curtail its nuclear weapons program, and bolster the ballistic missile shield with allies Japan and South Korea. She supported the Obama administration's pivot to Asia, in part because the United States needed a greater military presence in the region to counter the North Korean threat.  South Asia = Afghanistan = Clinton supports President Barack Obama's decision to keep 5,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan through the end of his term in January 2017. She has said that the primary goal of these forces should be to support and train the Afghan National Army rather than to engage in \\"on- the-ground combat.\\" When asked in June 2014 about U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, Clinton said that it would depend upon \\"conditions on the ground and what was being asked for.\\" As Secretary of State under Obama, Clinton advocated more hawkish policies than other senior administration officials; \\"Clinton's more activist philosophy\\" occasionally clashed with Obama's \\"instincts toward restraint.\\"Mark Landler, How Hillary Clinton Became a Hawk, New York Times Magazine (April 21, 2016). Clinton supported the 2009 increase in U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan. During the administration's Afghanistan War review in 2010, Clinton endorsed General Stanley McChrystal's recommendation for 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan, before endorsing a fallback proposal (ultimately accepted by Obama) for 30,000 troops. In January 2010, Clinton supported a $500 million plan developed by NATO, Britain, and the Afghan government to reintegrate low-level Taliban insurgents into Afghan society. The plan, to be funded by a \\"Peace and Reintegration Trust Fund,\\" Clinton set three end conditions for any reintegration of insurgents: the renunciation of violence, a break with al-Qaeda, and a commitment to abide by Afghan law, including an Afghan Constitution guaranteeing \\"the rights of all individuals, especially women.\\"Marc Grossman, Lessons From Negotiating With the Taliban: Attempts at US-Taliban talks require persistence, moral guidelines on end goals, YaleGlobal (October 9, 2013). Mary Akrami of the Afghan Women Skills Development Center, were \\"initially dubious\\" of the plan, given the Taliban's record of threatening and attacking girls and women. Marc Grossman (who served as U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan at the time) stated that \\"the moral ambiguity of talking to insurgents was clarified by our commitment to the principles Secretary Clinton had laid out before we started to talk.\\" U.S.-Taliban talks lasted from mid-2011 to March 2012 and were ultimately unsuccessful. In October 2011, Clinton said that a door for a negotiated peace as part of an inclusive political process was still open to the Taliban, and that the Taliban would face \\"unrelenting\\" attacks if they refused. Clinton also said at the time that Pakistani cooperation was vital to Afghan security and urged the Pakistani government \\"to deny safe haven to extremists sheltering across the border.\\" Clinton stated in her memoir Hard Choices: \\"I acknowledged, as I had many times before, that opening the door to negotiations with the Taliban would be hard to swallow for many Americans after so many years before. Reintegrating low-level fighters was odious enough; negotiating directly with top commanders was something else entirely. But diplomacy would be easy if we had to talk only to our friends. That's not how peace is made.\\"Hillary Rodham Clinton, Hard Choices (Simon & Schuster 2015), p. 152. During internal U.S. government talks in 2011-12, Clinton was highly skeptical of the exchange of five Taliban detainees for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Clinton pushed for stricter conditions as part of any agreement and was \\"disinclined to trust the Taliban or the Haqqani network in Pakistan,\\" which held Bergdahl prisoner.Josh Rogin, Hillary Clinton Was Skeptical of Taliban-Bergdahl Swap, Daily Beast (June 3, 2014).  Southeast Asia = Burma = Clinton has described Burma's transition to democracy as \\"a high point of my time as Secretary.\\" While noting that obstacles toward full democracy remain, Clinton emphasized her role in nudging the nation toward political reform. Clinton praised the landmark free elections held in Burma in 2015, calling them \\"an important, though imperfect, step forward in the country's long journey toward democracy\\" and saying that they represented \\"an affirmation of the indispensable role the United States can and should play in the world as a champion of peace and progress.\\"  West Asia = Iran = Clinton has described Iran as a long-term strategic challenge to the United States, its NATO allies, and Israel. In 2006, she called for sanctions to deter Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and refused to rule out a military strike, saying: \\"We cannot take any option off the table in sending a clear message to Iran that they will not be permitted to acquire nuclear weapons.\\" In 2007, she accused Iran of state- sponsored terrorism and using its surrogates to supply explosives that kill U.S. troops in Iraq. She criticized the Bush administration for refusing to talk to Iran about its nuclear program; meanwhile, Iran allegedly enhanced its nuclear-enrichment capabilities. On September 26, 2007, Clinton voted for a symbolic non-binding amendment to label Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" and to use diplomatic economic, intelligence economic, and U.S. military \\"instruments\\" to enforce U.S. policy against Iran and \\"its proxies\\" within Iraq.US Senate brands Iran Guard 'terrorist organization Agence France-Presse. September 27, 2007. Retrieved September 29, 2007. Clinton insisted that she continued to support vigorous diplomacy with Iran, defending her vote by saying Iranian arms shipments to Iraq have slowed down since the Senate resolution passed. But her Democratic opponents criticized her for contributing to what they said was Bush administration saber rattling on Iran. In October 2007, Clinton cosponsored a bill prohibiting the use of funds for military action in Iran without \\"explicit Congressional authorization.\\" On April 22, 2008, Clinton threatened Iran with nuclear annihilation if they attacked Israel with nuclear weapons, saying \\"If Iran were to launch a nuclear attack on Israel what would our response be? I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran. That's what we will do. There is no safe haven.\\" She continued, \\"Whatever stage of development they might be in their nuclear weapons program in the next 10 years during which they may foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel, we would be able to totally obliterate them.\\" During Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, \\"upping sanctions on Iran was a clear priority.\\"Lauren Carroll, She says she helped usher Iran to the negotiating table, PolitiFact (November 23, 2015). Clinton was personally involved in the U.S. State Department's successful efforts to convince other nations, including Russia and China, to rapidly ramp up international sanctions against Iran. Clinton also successfully secured the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929 in June 2010, which added strict new sanctions on Iran, including an arms embargo and limits on the country's financial and shipping activities.Robin Renwick, Ready for Hillary?: Portrait of a President in Waiting (Biteback Publishing, 2014), chap. 16 (\\"Hillary became exasperated at attempts by Brazil and Turkey to broker an agreement that would impose no real constraints on Iran. In meetings with the Chinese President and Premier in Beijing, Hillary emphasized that the issue was critical for the US and managed to get their support for a UN Security Council resolution in June 2010 imposing tougher sanctions on Iran.\\"). The sanctions imposed on Iran by the U.S. during Clinton's tenure are generally regarded as one of several factors that compelled Iran to go to the negotiating table over its nuclear program. According to experts, \\"Clinton's team also played a role in the sanctions that Congress passed\\" during Clinton's tenure, although \\"Congress did pass some sanctions that went further than the administration's wishes.\\" One such measure, placing sanctions on the Iran's central bank, was enacted by Congress and signed into law by President Obama over the objections of State Department officials. The State Department ultimately implemented it, although it issued waivers from the sanctions for several countries, prompting criticism from some lawmakers and advocacy groups. During her 2008 election campaign, Clinton criticized Obama for being willing to negotiate with Iran without preconditions. As Secretary of State, Clinton helped arrange secret lower- level talks with the nation in 2012 and in 2013. After resigning as Secretary of State, she stated that negotiations were the most likely way for the U.S. to influence the country's nuclear development. On April 2, 2015, Clinton confirmed her support for an agreement to lift economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on the country's nuclear program, calling it \\"an important step\\" in controlling the nation's security. In January 2016, Clinton said, \\"I'm very proud of the Iran Nuclear Agreement. I was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office. I was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed which put the pressure on Iran. It brought them to the negotiating table which resulted in this agreement. But I think we still have to carefully watch them.\\" =Iraq= On October 11, 2002, Clinton voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, commonly known as the Iraq War Resolution, to give President Bush authority for the Iraq War. In an interview on December 18, 2006, she expressed regret for the vote: \\"Obviously, if we knew then what we know now, there wouldn't have been a vote, and I certainly wouldn't have voted for it.\\" By February 2007, Clinton failed to state that her vote was a mistake, or to apologize for it, as anti-war Democrats demanded. \\"If the most important thing to any of you is choosing someone who did not cast that vote or has said this vote was a mistake, then there are others to choose from,\\" Clinton told an audience in Dover, New Hampshire.Clinton Gives War Critics New Answer on '02 Vote, Patrick Healy, New York Times, February 18, 2007 In the second Democratic debate of the 2008 presidential race, Clinton said that she voted for the resolution under the impression that Bush would allow more time for UN inspectors to find proof of weapons of mass destruction before proceeding. Reporter Carl Bernstein and others have questioned why Clinton would have voted against the Levin Amendment, which would have required President Bush to allow more time to UN weapons inspectors and also would have required a separate Congressional authorization to allow a unilateral invasion of Iraq, if her vote was simply a vote for strong diplomacy. During an April 20, 2004 interview on Larry King Live, Clinton was asked about her October 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq war resolution. > Obviously, I've thought about that a lot in the months since. No, I don't > regret giving the president authority because at the time it was in the > context of weapons of mass destruction, grave threats to the United States, > and clearly, Saddam Hussein had been a real problem for the international > community for more than a decade. ... The consensus was the same, from the > Clinton administration to the Bush administration. It was the same > intelligence belief that our allies and friends around the world shared. > But, she said, the Bush Administration \\"really believed it. They really > thought they were right, but they didn't let enough sunlight into their > thinking process to really have the kind of debate that needs to take place > when a serious decision occurs like that.\\" In a November 29, 2005 letter to her constituents, Senator Clinton said, \\"There are no quick and easy solutions to the long and drawn out conflict [the Bush] Administration triggered ... I do not believe that we should allow this to be an open-ended commitment without limits or end. Nor do I believe that we can or should pull out of Iraq immediately.\\" On June 8, 2006, Clinton said of the U.S. airstrike that killed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi: \\"I saw firsthand the terrible consequences of Zarqawi's terrorist network when Bill, Chelsea and I visited the hotel ballroom in Amman, Jordan last November where Zarqawi's followers had detonated a bomb at a wedding, killing and wounding innocent people. We owe our thanks to our men and women in uniform and others in Iraq who have been fighting Zarqawi and other insurgents and who are responsible for today's success.\\" In a speech on June 13, 2006, Clinton sharply criticized President George W. Bush's handling of the Iraq War,Dan Balz, Liberal Activists Boo Clinton, The Washington Post (June 14, 2006). saying that Bush \\"rushed to war\\" and \\"refused to let the UN inspectors conduct and complete their mission ... We need to be building alliances instead of isolation around the world ... There must be a plan that will begin to bring our troops home.\\" In the same speech, Clinton reiterated her longstanding opposition to a timeline for U.S. withdrawal, saying: \\"I do not think it is a smart strategy either for the president to continue with his open-ended commitment which I think does not put enough pressure on the Iraqi government, nor do I think it is a smart policy to set a date certain.\\" On February 17, 2007, she announced the Iraq Troop Protection and Reduction Act of 2007. This act would compel President Bush to begin relegating troops from Iraq within 90 days of remote passage, or, according to Clinton, Congress would have to dismantle their authorization for the war. The Act would also end the blank check to the Iraqi government and submit them to harsh consequences if boundaries are violated. Lastly, the Act would require the Secretary of Defense to verify the condition, in terms of supplies and in terms of their training, of all Iraqi troops before they are sent. In March 2007 she voted in favor of a war spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq within a certain deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines but was subsequently vetoed by President Bush. In May 2007, Clinton, along with then democratic rival Obama and 12 other senators, voted against a compromise war funding bill that removed previously vetoed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government. She said, \\"I fully support our troops [but this measure] fails to compel the president to give our troops a new strategy in Iraq.\\" While calling for ending the war in Iraq, Clinton's indicated in July 2007 that she advocates keeping a reduced number of U.S. troops in Iraq for the foreseeable future, stating \\"we cannot lose sight of our very real strategic national interests in this region.\\" In the speech, she posited redeploying U.S. forces to protect the Kurdish region in the north, to engage in targeted operations against al-Qaeda in Iraq, and to train and equip Iraqi forces. Clinton's position is similar to that of the Iraq Study Group in that she highlights the need for political reconciliation in Iraq, supports the withdrawal of U.S. combat brigades, and favors keeping a reduced number of troops to serve in training and support roles such as protection of the U.S. Embassy. On August 22, 2007, Clinton credited the troop surge and related new tactics with helping to produce the Anbar Awakening in Al Anbar Governorate, but said that overall the increase in troops had not met stated goals: \\"The surge was designed to give the Iraqi government time to take steps to ensure a political solution to the situation. It has failed to do so. The White House's report in September wont change that. It is abundantly clear that there is no military solution to the sectarian fighting in Iraq. We need to stop refereeing the war, and start getting out now.\\" Furthermore, Clinton, following the lead of Senate Armed Services Committee chair Carl Levin, called on the Iraqi Parliament to replace Nouri al-Maliki as Prime Minister of Iraq with \\"a less divisive and more unifying figure,\\" saying that Maliki had failed to make progress in bridging differences between the hostile factions within Iraq: \\"Iraqi leaders have not met their own political benchmarks to share power, modify the de- Baathification laws, pass an oil law, schedule provincial elections, and amend their constitution.\\" By late November 2007, with still more evidence that the surge and other tactics and developments had led to a significant lessening of the civil violence in Iraq, Clinton acknowledged the successes but said that the underlying equation had not changed: \\"Our troops are the best in the world; if you increase their numbers they are going to make a difference. The fundamental point here is that the purpose of the surge was to create space for political reconciliation and that has not happened, and there is no indication that it is going to happen, or that the Iraqis will meet the political benchmarks. We need to stop refereeing their civil war and start getting out of it.\\" At the January 16, 2008 Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Clinton, along with Senators Barack Obama and John Edwards, maintained that they cannot guarantee the removal of all U.S. troops by the end of their first presidential term due to continuing support roles. All three pledged to begin the withdrawal of combat brigades within 60 days of taking office. Additionally, Clinton used the opportunity to ask Senator Obama to co-sponsor legislation to prevent President Bush from signing long-term agreements with the government of Iraq without the express consent of congress, stating: \\"So I've introduced legislation that clearly requires President Bush to come to the United States Congress. It is not enough, as he claims, to go to the Iraqi parliament, but to come to the United States Congress to get anything that he's trying to do, including permanent bases, numbers of troops, all the other commitments he's talking about as he's traveling in that region.\\" =Israel= Clinton has stated that she is \\"an emphatic, unwavering supporter of Israel's safety and security.\\"The Senate Campaign: Excerpts From the 3rd and Last Debate Between Clinton and Lazio, The New York Times (October 28, 2000). CNN noted in 2016 that Clinton \\"has a long and detailed track record on supporting Israel in efforts to find a two-state solution throughout her time in the Senate and as secretary of state.\\"Tal Kopan & Elise Labott, Hillary Clinton's views on Israel win out in DNC platform, for now, CNN (June 26, 2016).

In 1998, Clinton said that such an arrangement would \\"be in the long- term interests of the Middle East.\\" In 2010, as secretary of state, Clinton presided over three sessions of direct face-to-face talks between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. In her 2016 AIPAC speech, Clinton said that if elected president she would continue to pursue direct Israel-Palestinian negotiations but would \\"vigorously oppose any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council.\\" Clinton has condemned the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement and \\"all efforts to malign, isolate and undermine Israel and the Jewish people.\\" Clinton is opposed to Israeli settlement expansion, arguing that a settlement freeze is key for peace talks to succeed. In July 2006, Clinton expressed support for Israel's efforts in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict: \\"We are here to show solidarity and support for Israel. We will stand with Israel, because Israel is standing for American values as well as Israeli ones.\\" In November 2005, Clinton said that she supports the creation of the West Bank barrier, stating: \\"This is not against the Palestinian people. This is against the terrorists.\\"International Mideast envoy says time running out for Gaza crossing deal, CBC News, November 14, 2005 As a senator and throughout her career, Clinton has said that she regards Jerusalem as the \\"eternal and indivisible capital of Israel,\\" and Clinton supported legislation requiring the U.S. government to identify Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move the U.S. Embassy to Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem (the Jerusalem Embassy Act).First lady supports Jerusalem as capital of Israel, CNN (July 9, 1999).Alexandra Jaffe, Jerusalem back in the political spotlight, CNN (June 11, 2015). In 2011, as Secretary of State, Clinton filed a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Zivotofsky v. Clinton, involving an act of Congress requiring that U.S. passports for persons born in Jerusalem read \\"Jerusalem, Israel\\" (rather than \\"Jerusalem\\") under place of birth. Consistent with the U.S.'s policy of the last 60 years recognizing no state as having sovereignty over Jerusalem,Ariane de Vogue, Supreme Court strikes down law in Jerusalem passport case, CNN (June 8, 2015). Clinton's brief argued that \\"any American action, even symbolically, toward recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel\\" might have an influence on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The Supreme Court subsequently struck down the passport law on separation-of-powers grounds, holding that Congress had intruded upon the president's constitutional power to recognize foreign states. During an interview while the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict was ongoing, Clinton said that Hamas had intentionally provoked Israel by firing rockets into that country. In regard to whether Israel's response against Hamas had been proportionate, she said, \\"I'm not a military planner, but Hamas puts its missiles ‚Äì its rockets ‚Äì in civilian areas. Part of it is that Gaza's pretty small and it's very densely populated. They put their command and control of Hamas military leaders in those civilian areas. Israel, I know, has sent warnings and tried to get people to move, but in any kind of conflict there are going to be civilian casualties, and we need to try to get to a cease-fire as soon as possible.\\" = Turkey = During the 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt, Clinton said: \\"We should all urge calm and respect for laws, institutions, and basic human rights and freedoms - and support for the democratically elected civilian government.\\"Clinton calls for support of Turkey's elected civilian government, Reuters (July 15, 2016). Armenian Genocide  During her time in the Senate, Clinton was a co-sponsor of the Armenian Genocide Resolution, and as senator twice wrote to President Bush calling on him to refer to the Armenian Genocide in his annual commemorative statement.Taylor Wofford, Hillary's Shifting Stance on the Armenian Genocide, Newsweek (April 24, 2015). (The use of the word \\"genocide\\" is contested by the government of Turkey.) In 2008 (the year Clinton unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for president), Clinton stated that \\"I believe the horrible events perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire against Armenians constitute a clear case of genocide.\\" As secretary of state under Obama, Clinton shifted her position on the atrocity; consistent with administration policy, neither Clinton nor the Department of State used the word genocide, which angered Armenians and the Armenian National Committee of America.ANCA Condemns Clinton's Complicity in Genocide Denial, Armenian Weekly (January 27, 2012). At a State Department event in January 2012, Clinton stated that the atrocity \\"has always been viewed, and I think properly so, as a matter of historical debate\\" causing \\"high emotions\\" and \\"that is the right posture for the United States Government\\" to avoid using the word. After leaving office as secretary of state, Clinton resumed using the term genocide. A Clinton aide told Newsweek in April 2015 that Clinton \\"has a record of expressing her own view that this was a genocide.\\" = Europe = Russia and Ukraine  As secretary of state, Clinton oversaw the completion of the New START nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia, and successfully pushed for its ratification.Associated Press, U.S.-Russia nuclear arms treaty finalized (February 5, 2011).Hillary Rodham Clinton & Robert M. Gates, Clinton and Gates: Why the Senate should ratify New START, The Washington Post (November 15, 2010). In April 2016, the Clinton campaign ran an advertisement claiming credit for Clinton in \\"securing a massive reduction in nuclear weapons\\" through the treaty. FactCheck.org found that this ad overstated Clinton's nuclear achievement, noting that New START limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads but does not require either side to destroy nuclear weapons or reduce their nuclear stockpile, that Russia was below the limit when the treaty took effect, and that the country has increased them since then. The New START treaty was part of Clinton's broader role in the 2009 \\"reset\\" of U.S.-Russia relations. Clinton defended the \\"reset\\" in 2014, saying that the signing of the New START treaty, enhanced sanctions on Iran and the securing of supply lines to American troops in Afghanistan were all successes that came from the reset.Dan Merica, Hillary Clinton stands by 'Russian reset' in face of recent events, CNN (July 24, 2014). In an interview with a Russian journalist in 2010, Clinton stated \\"One of the fears that I hear from Russians is that somehow the United States wants Russia to be weak. That could not be farther from the truth. Our goal is to help strengthen Russia. We see Russia with the strong culture, with the incredible intellectual capital that Russia has, as a leader in the 21st century. And we sometimes feel like we believe more in your future than sometimes Russians do.\\"Interview With Vladimir Pozner of First Channel Television , State Department (March 19, 2010).Is Christie telling the truth about Clinton's Libya record?, Politico (July 20, 2016). After Russia's 2011 elections, Clinton said that they were \\"neither free nor fair\\", a statement that was consistent with claims by elections observers and the statements by other Western leaders. Clinton has criticized Russian president Vladimir Putin on a number of occasions for his aggressive conduct, particularly after Russia annexed Crimea and supported separatists in eastern Ukraine, which led to ongoing increased tensions with the West.Ben Schreckinger, Clinton urges more financial, military aid to Ukraine, Politico (January 22, 2015). In July 2014, Clinton said that Putin \\"can be dangerous\\" and that \\"his latest aggression in Ukraine must be answered with a joint reaction by the West.\\" In January 2015, Clinton called for increased financial aid, military equipment, and military training to Ukraine (contingent on measures to ensure accountability) to \\"help Ukraine defend its borders\\" and combat Russian-backed separatists. = North America = Cuba  Clinton supported the Helms‚ÄìBurton Act of 1996. In 2000, Clinton stated that she supported increasing food and medicine exports to Cuba and allowing more travel to the Cuba, but was \\"not ready to vote to lift\\" the U.S. embargo against Cuba, insisting that \\"Castro should make some good faith show of moving toward ending repression, freeing political prisoners and some steps toward democratization\\" before the U.S. acted to lift the embargo. Clinton held the same view for the same reasons in 2008. Clinton later shifted her view, writing in her 2014 book Hard Choices that near the end of her tenure as Secretary of State, she recommended that Obama review the Cuban embargo, as it was not achieving its goals and might have been counterproductive. Clinton wrote that the embargo was \\"holding back our broader agenda across Latin America\\" and that \\"After 20 years of observing and dealing with the U.S.-Cuba relationship, I thought we should shift the onus onto the Castros to explain why they remained undemocratic and abusive.\\" In December 2014, after expressed her support for lifting the embargo, after President Obama announced that the administration would be taking steps to do so.Daniel Strauss, Hillary Clinton to call for lifting Cuba embargo, Politico (July 29, 2015). Clinton said in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in 2014 that the embargo was \\"Castro's best friend,\\" and the following year stated that \\"Despite good intentions, our decades-long policy of isolation has only strengthened the Castro regime's grip on power. As I have said, the best way to bring change to Cuba is to expose its people to the values, information, and material comforts of the outside world. The goal of increased U.S. engagement in the days and years ahead should be to encourage real and lasting reforms for the Cuban people.\\" Haiti The Clinton Foundation has been involved in channeling significant financial aid to Haiti both before and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, leading both Bill and Hillary Clinton to become active supporters of Haitian politicians with mixed results. The Clinton Foundation's role in the creation of the Caracol Industrial Park has been the source of significant criticism.  Honduras  Greg Grandin and some other commentators have criticized Clinton for legitimizing the military- backed ouster of President Manuel Zelaya in the 2009 Honduran coup d'√©tat, which occurred amidst a constitutional crisis in that country.Greg Grandin, A Voter's Guide to Hillary Clinton's Policies in Latin America, The Nation (April 15, 2016).Mark Weisbrot, Clinton's Latin American clangers, The Guardian (March 5, 2010). Grandin also faulted Clinton for supporting what he characterized as neoliberal economic policies such as privatization in Mexico, El Salvador, and elsewhere in Latin America. In 2016, when asked about events in Honduras, Clinton took the position that the removal of President Zelaya was legal, although \\"I didn't like the way it looked or the way they did it.\\"Amy Goodman, Hear Hillary Clinton Defend Her Role in Honduras Coup When Questioned by Juan Gonz√°lez, DemocracyNow! (April 13, 2016). Clinton noted that if the U.S. government had declared a coup, it would have been legally obliged to immediately cut off all aid, including humanitarian aid, which would \\"just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people.\\" Clinton noted that she had worked with Nobel Peace Prize laureate √ìscar Arias to navigate \\"a very difficult situation, without bloodshed, without a civil war, that led to a new election\\" and stated: \\"I think that was better for the Honduran people. But we have a lot of work to do to try to help stabilize that and deal with corruption, deal with the violence and the gangs and so much else.\\" = South America = Brazil  In 2010, Clinton criticized the Brazilian government (then led by President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva) and the Turkish government (led by President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan) for making a fuel- swap agreement with Iran. Clinton stated that the agreement had a \\"number of deficiencies\\" and was a \\"transparent ploy\\" by Iran.Daniel Dombey, Harvey Morris & Geoff Dyer, Clinton attacks Turkey-Brazil deal with Iran, Financial Times (May 18, 2010).Sarah Diehl & Eduardo Fujii, Brazil Challenges International Order by Backing Iran Fuel Swap, Nuclear Threat Initiative (July 15, 2010). Clinton visited Brasilia in 2012, leading the U.S. delegation to the third U.S.-Brazil Global Partnership Dialogue. and giving opening remarks with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff at the First Annual High-Level Meeting of the Open Government Partnership (OGP), an international initiative (co- chaired by Brazil and the United States and including many countries and civil society organizations) that is aimed at fighting corruption.Sarah de Sainte Croix, U.S. Secretary of State Clinton in Brazil, Rio Times (April 17, 2012). On the occasion, Clinton praised Rousseff for her \\"commitment to openness, transparency, her fight against corruption\\"; Rousseff was at the time known as a champion of anti-corruption efforts, although years later (in 2016), Rousseff was impeached on allegations of impropriety.  Venezuela  As secretary of state, Clinton frequently criticized controversial Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez and his government, saying that the U.S. was open to improving relations with the country but that \\"it doesn't appear that he wants to.\\"Hugo Chavez: Memorable moments, BBC News (March 6, 2013). In 2010, Ch√°vez said in a speech: \\"I'm not loved by Hillary Clinton ... and I don't love her either.\\" Clinton described Ch√°vez as \\"a self-aggrandizing dictator who was more of an aggravation than a real threat\\" in her book Hard Choices.Clinton, Hard Choices, p. 224. =Counterterrorism and homeland security= Syria, Iraq and fight against ISIL  Clinton has proposed intensifying the current air campaign against ISIL's strongholds in Iraq and Syria. She says she will step up support for local forces on the ground. In 2014, Clinton advocated for arming the moderate rebels in the Syrian Civil War, saying that \\"the failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the protests against Assad ... left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.\\" She wants to pursue \\"a diplomatic strategy to resolve Syria's civil war and Iraq's sectarian conflict\\". She is opposed to putting combat troops on the ground in Syria or Iraq, but does support an expanded deployment of U.S. special operations troops on the ground to assist local forces. On the American-led military actions against ISIL in Syria, Clinton advocates going further than what President Obama has done in terms of the air campaign and support for local forces.Amy Chozick & David E. Sanger, Hillary Clinton Goes Beyond President Obama in Plan to Defeat ISIS, The New York Times (November 19, 2015). Clinton has also proposed a no-fly zone in northern Syria, enforced by the U.S. and allies, that would provide a humanitarian buffer zone (or \\"safe haven\\") that would protect civilians fleeing the Assad regime and ISIL.Matthew Jaffe, Obama adviser explains why Clinton's Syria plan won't work, CNN (April 18, 2016). Clinton has also called upon the Arab states of the Persian Gulf to stop funding terrorist groups, saying: \\"Once and for all, the Saudis, the Qataris and others need to stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations.\\" At the beginning of his administration, President Obama sought to improve relations with Syria. He returned the U.S. ambassador to the country (who had been withdrawn by the Bush administration following the assassination of the Lebanese prime minister) and a number of congressional delegations visited the country. Appearing on Face the Nation on March 27, 2011, Secretary of State Clinton said \\"There's a different leader in Syria now. Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he's a reformer.\\" After members of Congress and the media criticized her statement, she said \\"I referenced opinions of others. That was not speaking either for myself or for the administration.\\" Upon investigation, The Washington Post Fact Checker found no evidence that any Republicans has made statements to support Clinton's statement and concluded: \\"In fact, Clinton's remarks gave a highly misleading impression‚Äîthat there was general consensus by experts on Syria in both parties that Assad was a reformer, even though Clinton's own State Department reports label him otherwise.\\" Following the 2016 Brussels bombings, Clinton said: \\"We need to work with the brightest minds of Silicon Valley to more effectively track and analyze ISIS' social media and map jihadists' networks online.\\" Criticism of the Arab Gulf states for terrorist funding Clinton criticized several Arab states of the Persian Gulf in June 2016 for their funding of terrorism, saying: \\"It is long past time for the Saudis, the Qataris and the Kuwaitis and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations. And they should stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path toward extremism.\\" The Associated Press describes her rhetoric as \\"a window into how a President Clinton might approach the combustible, complex Middle East: polite but harsh truth-telling, with specifics, delivered as if among friends.\\" It was reported in 2010 that Clinton in leaked diplomatic cables described donors in Saudi Arabia as the \\"most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide\\". Homeland security On December 8, 2004, in a speech regarding the passage of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) of 2004, Senator Clinton delivered remarks on her approach to homeland security. \\"[This] legislation calls for dramatic improvements in the security of our nation's transportation infrastructure, including aviation security, air cargo security, and port security. Through this legislation, the security of the Northern Border will also be improved, a goal I have worked toward since 2001. Among many key provisions, the legislation calls for an increase of at least 10,000 border patrol agents from Fiscal Years 2006 through 2010, many of whom will be dedicated specifically to our Northern Border. There will also be an increase of at least 4,000 full-time immigration and customs enforcement officers in the next five years. Later in the speech, Clinton described her satisfaction with the way in which IRTPA tackles what she views as the root causes of terrorism by improving education around the world and establishing schools in Muslim countries that will replace the current madrassas. > I am also pleased that the legislation addresses the root causes of > terrorism in a proactive manner. This is an issue that I have spent a good > deal of time on in the past year because I believe so strongly that we are > all more secure when children and adults around the world are taught math > and science instead of hate. The bill we are voting on today includes > authorization for an International Youth Opportunity Fund, which will > provide resources to build schools in Muslim countries. The legislation also > acknowledges that the U.S. has a vested interest in committing to a long- > term, sustainable investment in education around the globe. Some of this > language is modeled on legislation that I introduced in September, The > Education for All Act of 2004, and I believe it takes us a small step > towards eliminating madrassas and replacing them with schools that provide a > real education to all children. Clinton has sponsored and co-sponsored several bills relating to protecting Americans from acts of terrorism, as well as providing assistance to the victims of such acts. In February 2006, then-Senator Clinton, along with Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, introduced legislation to bar companies controlled by foreign governments from buying U.S. port operations. Clinton and Menendez expressed concern about port security following the Dubai Ports World controversy.Patrick McGeehan, 2 Senators Seek to Stop Ports Deal, Citing Security, The New York Times (February 18, 2006). = Humanitarian intervention abroad = As first lady, Clinton said, \\"I am very pleased that this president and administration have made democracy one of the centerpieces of our foreign policy.\\" Clinton favored intervention in Haiti (1994), the Bosnian War (1995), as well as in the Kosovo War (1999). Before the Kosovo war, she phoned Bill Clinton from Africa. As she recalled later, \\"I urged him to bomb\\", arguing that Bill Clinton could not let the massacres in Kosovo \\"go on at the end of a century that has seen the major holocaust of our time.\\" In a February 2005 speech at the annual Munich Conference on Security Policy, Clinton expressed regret that the international community had failed to effectively intervene in the 1990s during the Rwandan genocide and early in the Bosnian War. She praised the United Nations and NATO interventions that did occur later in the Bosnian War (leading to the Dayton Agreement), Kosovo War, and East Timor. Regarding the ongoing large-scale killing in the Darfur conflict, she then advocated \\"at least a limited NATO role in logistics, communication and transportation in Darfur in support of the African Union.\\" During the July 2007 CNN/YouTube Democratic debate in South Carolina, Clinton was characterized by The Chicago Tribune as against U.S. military intervention. Asked again whether U.S. troops should be sent to Darfur, Clinton focused on \\"...sanctions, divestment and UN peacekeepers.\\" When pressed with the question, \\"How about American troops on the ground?\\" she said, \\"American ground troops I don't think belong in Darfur at this time.\\" = NATO and U.S. relations with allies = Clinton has also criticized the \\"inflammatory rhetoric\\" of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, adding that Trump's proposal to build a wall on the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border and his proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States would harm the security of the United States and the world as a whole. Clinton added that Trump's suggestion for the U.S. to withdraw from involvement in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would benefit the Russian government, saying in an address at Stanford University that: \\"If Mr. Trump gets his way, it will be like Christmas in the Kremlin.\\" Clinton added that \\"Putin already hopes to divide Europe.\\" Clinton has said that the U.S.'s partnerships through NATO have been one of the best security investments made by the United States.Clifton B. Parker, Clinton at Stanford: Global alliances key to ending terrorism, Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Stanford University (March 23, 2016). Clinton has stressed the role of international alliances and coordination in counterterrorism efforts, saying in March 2016 that \\"We need our allies as much as ever\\" and adding that these alliances provide the United States and Europe with a strategic advantage over nations such as China or Russia.  U.S. relationship with Britain and other European allies  Clinton has affirmed \\"America's steadfast commitment to the special relationship with Britain and the transatlantic alliance with Europe.\\"Hillary Clinton Statement on Brexit Vote , Hillary for America (June 24, 2016). After the UK voted in a June 2016 referendum to withdraw from the European Union, Clinton issued a statement saying: \\"We respect the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made. Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America. ... This time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans' pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our adversaries, and to defend our interests.\\" Clinton has expressed admiration for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, referring to her in 2014 as \\"the greatest leader in Europe\\" and praising her role in navigating the Eurozone's sovereign debt crisis. = Security vs. human rights = On November 15, 2007, when asked \\"[is] national security more important than human rights?\\" Clinton responded, \\"I agree with that completely. The first obligation of the president of the United States is to protect and defend the United States of America. That doesn't mean that it is to the exclusion of other interests. And there's absolutely a connection between a democratic regime [in Pakistan] and heightened security for the United States.\\" Prior to assuming the role of Secretary of State, Clinton signed an agreement with the administration which precluded the Clinton Foundation from accepting new donations from foreign governments during her tenure in order to mitigate the potential for inappropriate influence of the State Department. In February 2015, the Washington Post reported that the foundation had accepted $500,000 from Algeria in 2010, in apparent violation of her agreement with the administration. The foundation indicated that the donation was to contribute to relief efforts in Haiti. The Post noted that the donation \\"coincided with a spike\\" in lobbying efforts by Algeria of the State Department regarding their human rights record. = Torture = Clinton has pledged to \\"never condone or practice torture anywhere in the world\\" if elected President. Clinton has stated that \\"lots of empirical evidence\\" shows that torture does not work, a statement rated \\"true\\" by PolitiFact. Clinton believes that torture is counterproductive, stating that \\"It does put our own soldiers, and increasingly our own civilians, at risk.\\" = United Nations = On February 13, 2005, at the Munich Conference on Security Policy, Clinton outlined her support for a strong United Nations: > My first observation is simple but it must govern all that we do: The United > Nations is an indispensable organization to all of us ‚Äì despite its flaws > and inefficiencies. This means quite simply, that everyone here today, and > governments everywhere, must decide that our global interests are best > served by strengthening the UN, by reforming it, by cleaning up its obvious > bureaucratic and managerial shortcomings, and by improving its > responsiveness to crises, from humanitarian to political. ... At its > founding in San Francisco sixty years ago, fifty members signed the Charter. > Today, the UN has 191 members, and, quite frankly, many of them sometimes > act against the interests of a stronger UN, whether consciously or not, with > alarming regularity. Since the UN is not, in the final analysis, an > independent hierarchical organization, like for example a sports team or a > corporation, but no more ‚Äì or less ‚Äì than a collection of its members, the > UN becomes progressively weakened by such action. Ironically, 'the UN' ‚Äì an > abstraction that everyone from journalists to those of us in this room use > in common discussions ‚Äì is often blamed for the actions (or inactions) of > its members.The Future Role of the United Nations Within the Framework of > Global Security. Munich Conference on Security Policy. Remarks as Prepared > for Delivery February 13, 2005 While in the Senate, Clinton co-sponsored a resolution \\"expressing the sense of the Senate on the importance of membership of the United States on the United Nations Human Rights Commission.\\"S.Res. 88: A resolution expressing the sense of the Senate on the importance of membership of the United States on the United Nations Human Rights Commission (107th United States Congress). =Wikileaks= Reacting to WikiLeaks and the 2010 U.S. diplomatic cables release, Clinton expressed her condemnation of any disclosure that puts lives at risk and threatens national security.  Democracy and governmental structure = D.C. statehood = In May 2016 Clinton declared her support for D.C. statehood, saying that she would be a \\"vocal champion\\" on the issue if elected. = Electoral college = In November 2000, Clinton called for a Constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College, replacing it with a national popular vote, saying \\"we are a very different country than we were 200 years ago.\\" \\"I believe strongly that in a democracy, we should respect the will of the people and to me, that means it's time to do away with the Electoral College and move to the popular election of our president. I hope no one is ever in doubt again about whether their vote counts.\\" She promised to co-sponsor legislation that would abolish it resulting in the direct election of the president.New York Times: \\"The Case for the Electoral College\\" December 19, 2000Fox News: \\"Time to eliminate the Electoral College?\\" by William La Jeunesse November 5, 2012 = Executive authority = Clinton's advisors have said that she believes that the \\"president usually deserves the benefit of the doubt from Congress on matters of executive authority\\". In 2003, Clinton stated that she was \\"a strong believer in executive authority,\\" wishing that when her husband was president, Congress had been more willing to recognize presidential authority. = Supreme Court = An analysis by FiveThirtyEight shows that, under the assumption that Scalia's vacant seat on the Court will not be filled and taking account of the old age of three of the sitting justices, that under a Clinton presidency, \\"the court may quickly become the most liberal it's been in at least 80 years.\\"  Civil liberties and domestic policy  The American Civil Liberties Union has given her a 75 percent lifetime rating through September 2007. Breakdown is 3/5 60% for 2001‚Äì2002, 7/9 78% for 2003‚Äì2004, 10/12 83% for 2005‚Äì2006, 4/6 67% for 2007, for a total of 24/32 75%. = 9/11 responders = In 2006, Senator Clinton co-sponsored the Zadroga 9/11 Health Act which became law in 2011. The legislation funds and establishes a health program to provide medical treatment for responders and survivors who experienced or may experience health complications related to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Since leaving the Senate, Clinton has repeatedly urged Congress to reauthorize the legislation. = Abortion and birth control = Clinton is pro-choice, stating that abortion should be safe and legal. Clinton has stated that \\"birth control is basic health care\\". Clinton favors legislation that would make it illegal for pharmacists to refuse to provide access to emergency contraception. Clinton opposes the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funds to pay for abortion unless the pregnancy arises from incest, rape, or to save the life of the mother. NARAL Pro-Choice America consistently gave Clinton a 100 percent pro-choice rating from 2002 to 2006. Planned Parenthood endorsed Clinton in 2016, stating that \\"no other presidential contender in our nation's history has demonstrated such a strong, proactive commitment to women or has such a clear and outspoken record on behalf of women's health and rights.\\" Clinton has stressed prevention, sexual education, and abstinence. In 2005 and 2006, Senators Clinton and Senator Patty Murray led the opposition towards the Bush administration's attempt to restrict over-the-counter sales of the Plan B contraceptive. In April 2007 Clinton expressed dismay at the Supreme Court's Gonzales v. Carhart ruling that upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Clinton opposed the 2014 Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Supreme Court decision, stating, \\"It's the first time that our court has said that a closely held corporation has the rights of a person when it comes to religious freedom, which means the corporation's employers can impose their religious beliefs on their employees, and, of course, denying women the right to contraceptives as part of a health care plan is exactly that. I find it deeply disturbing that we are going in that direction.\\" In June 2016, she hailed the Supreme Court decision to strike down an anti-abortion law in Texas as \\"a victory for women in Texas and across America.\\" Clinton stated in June 2016, \\"I will always stand with Planned Parenthood. It should be funded, supported and appreciated ‚Äì not undermined, misrepresented, and demonized.\\" = Americans with disabilities = Clinton supports the American with Disabilities Act, because \\"it opened educational opportunities to all Americans, expanded transportation, made sure everyone can enter buildings, and ensured that no one would be turned down for a job because of a disability\\". As Secretary of State, Clinton tried to get the United States to join the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Clinton supports the Disability Integration Act, which requires that states and insurance companies provide people with disabilities who need long term care the choice to receive care at home instead of solely in institutions and nursing facilities.\\" The Disability Integration Act is supported by many disability rights groups. Clinton has called for closing a loophole that allows employers to gain an exemption from the minimum for workers with disabilities. = Anti-terrorism and domestic surveillance = Clinton voted for the USA PATRIOT Act in October 2001 when it was first enacted. In December 2005, when a political battle ensued over its renewal, Clinton supported a general filibuster against it, on the grounds that the renewal legislation did not appropriate enough money to New York for anti- terrorism efforts. During the renewal debate she expressed some concerns with it regarding civil liberties.\\"Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report\\", December 16, 2005. She then voted in favor of a compromise renewed act in March 2006 that passed by an 89‚Äì10 margin.\\" U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 109th Congress ‚Äì 2nd Session ... On the Conference Report (H.R. 3199 Conference Report)\\", United States Senate, March 2, 2006. Regarding the December 2005 NSA warrantless surveillance controversy, Clinton stated that she was \\"troubled\\" by President Bush's 2002 actions. In a statement, she said: \\"The balance between the urgent goal of combating terrorism and the safeguarding of our most fundamental constitutional freedoms is not always an easy one to draw. However, they are not incompatible, and unbridled and unchecked executive power is not the answer.\\" Following the 2016 mass shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Clinton called for creating more \\"integrated intelligence use\\" among local, state and national law enforcement; \\"strengthening communication\\" with other countries; and working with Silicon Valley to \\"prevent online radicalization.\\" Edward Snowden Clinton has called for Edward Snowden to face trial, saying \\"He broke the laws of the United States. He could have been a whistleblower, he could have gotten all the protections of a whistleblower. He chose not to do that. He stole very important information that has fallen into the wrong hands so I think he should not be brought home without facing the music.\\" PolitiFact rated her statement that Snowden could have gotten the protections of a whistleblower as \\"mostly false\\", noting that \\"the protections that Clinton referenced do not seem to be as strong as she suggested, and most of the expert opinion suggests they would not apply to Snowden.\\" = Arts and culture = Clinton has frequently expressed support for the arts and humanities. Clinton served as honorary chairwoman of a committee that issued a report, Creative America, in February 1997, calling for an appropriation by $2 per citizen by the year 2000 for museums, libraries, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities, which would represent a modest increase in federal arts and humanities spending.Associated Press, Hillary Clinton Calls for U.S. to Promote the Arts (February 27, 1997). Clinton's position was in contrast to that of congressional Republicans who called for an end to all federal funding of the National Endowment for the Arts. Clinton stated at the time that: \\"The arts and humanities can offer children safe and productive alternatives to crime, violence, gangs and drugs, transporting them beyond the bounds of their difficult circumstances.\\" While in the Senate, Clinton‚Äîalong with fellow New York Senator Chuck Schumer‚Äîunsuccessfully pushed for the inclusion of a $1 million appropriation for the Museum at Bethel Woods (a museum commemorating the Woodstock Music Festival of 1969) in a 2007 omnibus health and education spending bill. Republicans criticized the proposed expenditure as wasteful, while Schumer and Clinton said that the museum would \\"continue to promote education, the arts, culture and tourism in the region.\\" In January 2013, while secretary of state, Clinton published an article in Vanity Fair magazine, writing that \\"art is also a tool of diplomacy\\" and promoting the Department of State's longstanding Art in Embassies Program.Hillary Clinton, The Diplomacy of Art, Vanity Fair (January 24, 2013). On the campaign trail in 2015, Clinton has expressed support for art education,Hillary Clinton Expresses Support for Arts Education at NH Town Hall, Americans for the Arts Action Fund (July 29, 2015). and has said: \\"I believe that the arts and culture are important in their own right ... but they're also important drivers for economic growth, tourism, and attracting young people.\\"Hillary Clinton: \\"The arts and culture are important in their own right\\", Americans for the Arts Action Fund (November 4, 2015). = Capital punishment = Clinton is not in favor of abolishing capital punishment \\"because I do think there are certain egregious cases that still deserve the consideration of the death penalty, but I'd like to see those be very limited and rare, as opposed to what we've seen in most states.\\" She has encouraged the federal government to rethink the use of capital punishment, citing concerns over the frequent and discriminatory application of the punishment. Clinton sponsored the Innocence Protection Act, which requires DNA testing before administering federal executions. In regards to the Justice Department's decision to seek the death penalty for Dylann Roof, Clinton's spokesperson said \\"she respects the Justice Department decision.\\" = Church and state = In a 2005 speech, Clinton said that religious political officials should be able to \\"live out their faith in the public square.\\" Speaking at an event for candidates on faith and compassion in April 2008, Clinton said that \\"we want religion to be in the public square. If you are a person of faith, you have a right and even an obligation to speak from that wellspring of your faith.\\" = Crime = Clinton summarizes her key proposals on criminal justice reform as follows: * \\"End the era of mass incarceration, reform mandatory minimum sentences, and end private prisons.\\" * \\"Encourage the use of smart strategies ‚Äî like police body cameras ‚Äî and end racial profiling to rebuild trust between law enforcement and communities.\\" * \\"Help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully re-enter society.\\" According to PolitiFact, Clinton \\"focuses more on what happens before prison (such as sentencing of people not currently incarcerated) and after prison (especially reintegrating ex-convicts into society after they are released) than actually releasing current inmates.\\" As for releasing current inmates, Clinton focuses on nonviolent offenders. In 2000, during a Senate debate in Manhattan, Clinton voiced her support for drug courts to address drug abuse problems when she stated, \\"We need more treatment [for drug addicts]. It is unfair to urge people to get rid of their addiction and not have the treatment facilities when people finally make up their minds to get treatment.\\" In 2001, Clinton co-sponsored legislation that would create more tracking and harsher sentences for hate crimes. In a speech in April 2015, Clinton said that body-worn cameras for police should be \\"the norm everywhere.\\" During the same speech, she also urged an end to excessive prison sentences that burden black communities. She said that reform of mandatory sentencing laws are \\"long overdue\\" and criticized the militarization of police. In March 2016, when asked about the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 signed into law by Bill Clinton that she supported at the time, she said that \\"there were some aspects that worked well\\" including violence against women provisions, but she noted that other portions related to increasing incarceration \\"were a mistake.\\" In 1994, she referred to the bill as a \\"very well-thought-out crime bill that is both smart and tough,\\" and voiced support for three strikes laws when she stated \\"We need more police, we need more and tougher prison sentences for repeat offenders. The three strikes and you're out for violent offenders has to be part of the plan.\\" According to the Marshall Project's reporting, Clinton's position on the 1994 crime bill started to shift in a 1998 column as she picked and chose \\"from the crime bill's legacy, emphasizing the gun-control measures, prevention programs for juveniles, and funding for more police officers, without mentioning the law's contributions to mass incarceration.\\" = Drug policy = During her 2016 presidential campaign, Clinton had proposed a $10 billion plan, much of which would have been funded by the federal government, intended to treat addicts, increase emergency responders' access to a life-saving rescue drug targeting overdoses, and curb incarceration for nonviolent drug offenses. Clinton supports diversion programs such as treatment-focused drug courts,Aliyah Frumin, In 2016 race, drug courts get second look, MSNBC (August 25, 2015). saying in 2007: \\"Non-violent offenders should not be serving hard time in our prisons. They need to be diverted from our prison system.\\"Transcript of the Third Democratic Primary Presidential Debate (PBS, June 28, 2007).  Sentencing disparities  While in the Senate, Clinton has supported reducing the sentencing disparity that currently punishes crack cocaine crimes more harshly than powder cocaine crimes, and in 2015, Clinton called for eliminating the disparity, saying: \\"We're talking about two forms of the same drug. It makes no sense to continue treating them differently.\\"Laura Meckler, Hillary Clinton Lays Out Plans for Criminal-Justice Overhaul, The Wall Street Journal (October 30, 2015).Wesley Lowery, Hillary Clinton to call for ending racial profiling and disparities in crack cocaine sentences, The Washington Post (October 30, 2015). (A 1986 federal law created a 100:1 power-crack disparity; the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 reduced this to an 18:1 disparity). While campaigning in 2007, Clinton did not support making the elimination of the sentencing disparity retroactive, but in 2015 she expressed support for making change retroactively as well as prospectively.  Marijuana  Clinton supports rescheduling marijuana, legalizing medical marijuana, and the right of states to legalize recreational marijuana. She has called for greater research on the subject. Her views on marijuana were described in 2015 as similar to the \\"cautious, leave-it-to-the-states strategy\\" of the Obama administration.German Lopez, Democratic voters love marijuana legalization. Hillary Clinton doesn't, Vox (June 13, 2015). In May 2007, Clinton suggested the federal government was being \\"excessive\\" in its approach to patients who used medical marijuana. The following month, while campaigning in New Hampshire, Clinton has said she would end federal raids against such patients in states where the use of marijuana for medical purposes is legal.Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton Vows to End Federal Raids on Medical Marijuana Patients (press release), Drug Policy Alliance (June 19, 2007). In June 2014, Clinton said that on medical marijuana, \\"I don't think we've done enough research yet. Although I think for people who are in extreme medical conditions and have anecdotal evidence that it works, there should be availability under appropriate circumstances. But I do think we need more research, because we don't know how it interacts with other drugs.\\" On recreational marijuana, which has been legalized in Colorado and a few other states, Clinton said: \\"states are the laboratories of democracy. We have at least two states that are experimenting with that right now. I want to wait and see what the evidence is.\\" In April 2016, Clinton stated that she favored the removal of marijuana from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, which would make scientific studies of the substance significantly easier.Lauren Carroll, Hillary Clinton's hazy claim that researchers can't study marijuana, PolitiFact (April 26, 2016). Clinton also stated: \\"We have enough anecdotal evidence ... about what marijuana can do for medical conditions, easing pain. And we need to be doing research on it because I am 100 percent in favor of medical uses for marijuana. But I want to know what the evidence is.\\" In her 2016 policy position on marijuana, Clinton says that she supports rescheduling marijuana to Schedule II; \\"allowing states that have enacted marijuana laws to act as laboratories of democracy, as long as they adhere to certain federal priorities such as not selling to minors, preventing intoxicated driving, and keeping organized crime out of the industry\\"; and \\"focus[ing] federal enforcement resources on violent crime, not simple marijuana possession.\\"Issues: Criminal Justice Reform, Hillary for America (accessed May 19, 2016).  Opioid crisis  While campaigning for the presidency, Clinton has hosted forums on the opioid addiction crisis in the United States,Katharine Q. Seely, In Heroin Crisis, White Families Seek Gentler War on Drugs, The New York Times (October 30, 2015). listing it as a top concern.Kay Lazar, In N.H., Hillary Clinton hits on opioid abuse as a top concern, Boston Globe (January 4, 2016). Clinton has pledged to make substance-abuse treatment, including medication-assisted treatment, available to more addicts.Amanda Terkel & Jason Cherkis, Hillary Clinton Proposes $10 Billion Plan To Fight Addiction, The Huffington Post (September 2, 2015). Clinton also has pledged to make naloxone (Narcan), an antidote to opioid overdose, available to all police departments. = Education = Clinton voted for President Bush's No Child Left Behind Act in 2001, but subsequently criticized the program because of the government's failure to fully fund it.Eleanor Chute, Both Clinton and Obama attack No Child Left Behind Act, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (April 9, 2008). In June 2007, with the Act up for renewal by Congress,\\"No Child Left Behind lowers the bar on school reform\\", San Francisco Chronicle, June 11, 2007. Retrieved June 14, 2007. Clinton criticized the program, saying that its emphasis on testing has caused American children to narrow their studies and lose their creative edge. In 2007, Clinton stated \\"No Child Left Behind has been a terrible imposition on teachers and school districts and families and students.\\"Elizabeth Whitman, Hillary Clinton Endorses Obama's Reductions In School Testing Wrought By No Child Left Behind, Education Law She Voted For, International Business Times (October 24, 2015). Clinton said that she believed in accountability and acknowledged \\"a place for testing,\\" but said that the U.S. had \\"gone overboard\\" with too much emphasis on testing. In 2008, Clinton called for extensive changes to the act, saying that she would put an end to the unfunded mandate called No Child Left Behind.\\" In 2008, Clinton said: \\"I will work to reduce the teaching to the test and bring back a well-rounded curriculum and change the one-size-fits-all approach to addressing the challenges facing struggling schools. In 2015, Clinton praised an Obama administration initiative to reduce unnecessary standardized testing. Clinton stated: \\"While testing can provide communities with full information about how our students are doing and help us determine whether we have achievement gaps, we can and must do better. We should be ruthless in looking at tests and eliminating them if they do not actually help us move our kids forward. I embrace the principles laid out today by the Obama administration because they move us in the right direction. Standardized tests must be worth taking, high quality, time-limited, fair, fully transparent to students and parents, just one of multiple measures, and tied to improving learning.\\" Clinton has been a longtime supporter of early childhood education. During her 2008 campaign for the Democratic nomination for president, Clinton has proposed a $10 billion matching grant program for the states to provide universal access to voluntary pre-kindergarten programs.Clinton Calls For Pre-Kindergarten For All Children (press release) (May 21, 2007). In 2015, in one of her first policy speeches during the 2016 campaign, Clinton again pledged to work for affordable access to prekindergarten for every American four-year-olds if elected president.Amy Chozick & Jess Bidgood, Hillary Clinton Pushes to Expand Access to Pre- Kindergarten, The New York Times (June 15, 2016).Evan Halper, Hillary Clinton calls for preschool for all children, Los Angeles Times June 15, 2016). Clinton has specifically proposed giving incentives to states \\"to provide public preschool to children whose family incomes are below 200 percent of the federal poverty line.\\" Clinton has often emphasized the importance of community colleges in the United States, and on the campaign trail met with community college students and called for more community-college funding.Philip Rucker, Hillary Clinton stresses importance of first jobs and vocational training, The Washington Post (March 22, 2014).Louis Jacobson, Hillary Clinton says U.S. was first to create community colleges, PolitiFact (April 21, 2015). Clinton has also emphasized the importance of vocational and technical education, saying that one of the U.S.'s \\"biggest errors was getting rid of all technical and vocational education in most of our high schools.\\"Scott Wartman & Jeremy Fugleberg, Clinton ventures into conservative NKY, calls Trump 'dangerous', Cincinnati Enquirer (May 15, 2016). Clinton has proposed an expansion of apprenticeships in the United States, proposed new tax credits for businesses that hire and train apprentices (a $1,500 tax credit for each apprentice under 25 years old and a $1,000 tax credit for each older apprentice).Jana Kasperkevic, Hillary Clinton to renew push for apprenticeships to help hire millennials, The Guardian (June 17, 2015). Clinton is against education vouchers for use at private schools. On September 13, 2000, she said, \\"I do not support vouchers. And the reason I don't is because I don't think we can afford to siphon dollars away from our underfunded public schools.\\" Outlining a different objection, on February 21, 2006, she said: \\"First family that comes and says 'I want to send my daughter to St. Peter's Roman Catholic School' and you say 'Great, wonderful school, here's your voucher.' Next parent that comes and says, 'I want to send my child to the school of the Church of the White Supremacist ... ' The parent says, 'The way that I read Genesis, Cain was marked, therefore I believe in white supremacy. ... You gave it to a Catholic parent, you gave it to a Jewish parent, under the Constitution, you can't discriminate against me.' So what if the next parent comes and says, 'I want to send my child to the School of the Jihad'? ... I won't stand for it.\\"Clinton raps vouchers By Glenn Thrush (Newsday) February 22, 2006 Clinton supports the Common Core State Standards. She said this about Common Core: \\"The really unfortunate argument that's been going on around Common Core, it's very painful because the Common Core started off as a bipartisan effort. It was actually nonpartisan. It wasn't politicized. ... Iowa has had a testing system based on a core curriculum for a really long time. And [speaking to Iowans] you see the value of it, you understand why that helps you organize your whole education system. And a lot of states unfortunately haven't had that, and so don't understand the value of a core, in this sense a Common Core.\\" Clinton has supported charter schools as early as the 1990s.Laura Meckler, Clinton Views on Charter Schools, Teacher Evaluations Upset Some Democrats, The Wall Street Journal (December 17, 2015).John Cassidy, Where Does Hillary Clinton Stand on Education Reform?, New York (March 7, 2016). During her campaign for the presidency in 2015, Clinton expressed support for charter schools as long as they are high quality, and expressed support for federal funding to expand \\"high-quality charter schools.\\" Clinton said that she did not support requiring school districts to tie teacher pay to student test scores. At a town-hall meeting in November 2015, Clinton said that she had for thirty years \\"supported the idea of charter schools, ... not as a substitute for the public schools, but as a supplement for the public schools\\" and said that \\"there are good charter schools and there are bad charter schools, just like there are good public schools and bad public schools.\\"Valerie Strauss, Hillary Clinton: Most charter schools 'don't take the hardest-to-teach kids, or, if they do, they don‚Äôt keep them‚Äô, The Washington Post (November 8, 2015). Clinton stated that \\"Most charter schools‚ÄîI don't want to say every one‚Äîbut most charter schools, they don't take the hardest-to-teach kids, or, if they do, they don't keep them.\\"Kimberly Hefling, Hillary Clinton rebukes charter schools, Politico (November 9, 2015). FactCheck.org found that Clinton's \\"broad claim\\" on charter schools and the hardest-to-teach students was \\"not supported by the evidence\\", noting that a GAO report found that information on \\"why enrollment levels of students with disabilities in charter schools and traditional public schools differ\\" is anecdotal, and that while some charter schools had high rates of expulsion, the evidence did not show that \\"most\\" charter schools had high rates of expulsion.Eugene Kiely, Clinton's Charter School Exaggeration, FactCheck.org (November 12, 2015). = Faith-based initiatives = Clinton supports faith-based programs that address social issues and provide social services, saying that \\"there is no contradiction between support for faith- based initiatives and upholding our constitutional principles.\\" = Gun control = Clinton was the \\"first candidate to produce an extensive position paper on guns and gun violence\\" during the 2016 campaign.A Guide to the 2016 Presidential Candidates‚Äô Records on Gun Control and the Second Amendment, The Trace (January 14, 2016). Her plan calls for strengthening background checks for firearm purchases and closing loopholes in the current system by requiring, for example, background checks on purchases at gun shows; barring firearm sales to suspected terrorists, as well as \\"domestic abusers, other violent criminals, and the severely mentally ill\\"; and reinstating the now- expired Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which Clinton voted for in the Senate.David Weigel, Clinton calls for a new ban on assault weapons, 12 years after the last one expired, The Washington Post (June 13, 2016).Ed Pilkington, Hillary Clinton calls for renewed assault weapons ban: they're a 'weapon of war', The Guardian (June 13, 2016). Clinton's opponent in the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump, has repeatedly and falsely claimed that Clinton has advocated \\"abolishing\\" the Second Amendment. PolitiFact found \\"no evidence that Clinton has ever advocated for repealing or abolishing the Second Amendment,\\" and FactCheck.org found Trump's statement to be a distortion of Clinton's actual views. Clinton supports the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 (the \\"Brady Bill\\"), which mandates federal background checks on firearm purchasers and imposes a five-day waiting period on purchases.Gabriel Debenedetti, Brady Campaign to endorse Hillary Clinton, Politico (January 12, 2016). During the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, Clinton criticized her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, for voting against the Brady Bill five times.Linda Qiu, Hillary Clinton: Bernie Sanders voted against Brady bill five times, PolitiFact (October 13, 2015). Clinton opposes what she calls the \\"Charleston loophole,\\" which allows gun sales to go through without a background after the three-day waiting period for the government to perform a background check runs out. Clinton also opposes the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act of 2005, which protects firearms manufacturers and dealers from being held liable when crimes have been committed with their products, She has called for the act's repeal, saying: \\"the industry's sweeping legal protection for illegal and irresponsible actions ... makes it almost impossible for people to hold them accountable.\\" Clinton disagrees with the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, in which a divided Court struck down, by 5-4 vote, a handgun ban in Washington D.C. and found an individual right to keep and bear arms in the Second Amendment (as opposed to a right to keep and bear arms only as part of a \\"well-regulated militia\\"). A Clinton spokesman said that Clinton \\"believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe.\\" Clinton suggested on one occasion in 2015 that Australia's gun buyback program was \\"worth looking at\\" and \\"worth looking into,\\" although such a program is not part of her gun policy proposals. Although the Australian program was compulsory, Clinton referenced it alongside voluntary gun buyback programs conducted in U.S. communities, comparing them to President Obama's Cash for Clunkers program. Clinton made gun licensing and registration a part of her 2000 Senate campaign. Clinton was taught to shoot and hunt by her father. On hunting and shooting, Clinton said in 2008: \\"It's part of culture. It's part of a way of life. People enjoy hunting and shooting because it's an important part of who they are.\\" In the 1999 Proposition B in Missouri campaign, which would have allowed concealed carry of firearms in the state, Clinton's voice was used in a robocall message aimed at women, saying \\"It's just too dangerous for Missouri families.\\" She made gun rights a part of her 2008 Presidential campaign, after highlighting the importance of passing \\"gun-safety laws\\" during her 2000 campaign for the Senate, although according to Politico her messages were not directly contradictory. In 2016, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence endorses Clinton for president, saying that she \\"has been a national leader on gun violence prevention for decades\\" and \\"has the experience, record, and demonstrated commitment to help reach the Brady Campaign's goal of cutting gun deaths in half by 2025.\\" She has received an \\"F\\" rating from the National Rifle Association;Ellen Brait, Candidates' NRA ratings: a telling reflection of reactions to San Bernardino shooting, The Guardian (December 3, 2015). the NRA, which endorsed Trump,Sarah Wheaton, NRA facing member backlash over Trump endorsement, Politico (May 21, 2016). has been a longtime Clinton adversary. = Habeas corpus = Clinton \\"vigorously opposed\\" and voted against the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which changed the law to explicitly forbid the invocation of the Geneva Conventions when executing the writ of habeas corpus or in other civil actions. Clinton called the act \\"deeply troubling\\" and said: \\"Our Nation must not indefinitely detain anyone without safeguards to ensure we are holding the right person. This is one of the bedrock principles enshrined in our Constitution; it is the way our Founders believed we could be secure against those who would abuse government power. I believe we do not have to abandon our constitutional principles or our values as Americans in the name of fighting terrorism.\\"Senator Clinton Underscores Opposition to Military Commissions Act, Hillary Clinton Senate official webpage (September 28, 2006).Ari Melber, Clinton Backs Habeas Corpus as Supremes Deliberate, The Huffington Post (May 25, 2011). Clinton was a co- sponsor of the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act in 2007.How to Restore Habeas Corpus, The Nation blog, June 14, 2007 = Income inequality = Clinton believes that income inequality is a barrier to equal opportunity. She has suggested that the growing inequality is reminiscent of the Gilded Age of the robber barons: \\"economists have documented how the share of income and wealth going to those at the very top, not just the top 1% but the top .1% or the .01% of the population, has risen sharply over the last generation. Some are calling it a throwback to the Gilded Age of the robber barons.\\" = Space = Clinton has said that investments in the space program has \\"prompted a long period of American leadership in science and technology, and spurred a generation of innovators.\\" She wants to \\"advance inspirational, achievable, and affordable space initiatives. We must maintain our nation's leadership in space with a program that balances science, technology and exploration; protect our security and the future of the planet through international collaboration and Earth systems monitoring; expand our robotic presence in the solar system; and maximize the impact of our R&D; and other space program investments by promoting stronger coordination across federal agencies, and cooperation with industry.\\" = Technology policy = Net neutrality  Clinton strongly supports net neutrality. Senator Clinton was a cosponsor of the Internet Freedom Preservation Act, also known as the Snowe-Dorgan bill, as an amendment to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, that protects network neutrality in the United States. The bill aims to protect internet consumers and small businesses from Internet service providers charging large companies different amounts for Internet access than smaller customers. Clinton has stated that the Internet must continue to use an \\"open and non-discriminatory framework\\" so that it may be used as a forum where \\"views are discussed and debated in an open forum without fear of censorship or reprisal\\". In 2007, she stated, \\"I support net neutrality ... [The Internet] does not decide who can enter its marketplace and it does not pick which views can be heard and which ones silenced. It is the embodiment of the fundamental democratic principles upon which our nation has thrived for hundreds of years.\\" While secretary of state, Clinton delivered a major speech (entitled \\"Remarks of Internet Freedom\\") in January 2010, declaring that \\"We stand for a single Internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas.\\" In her 2016 platform, Clinton proposed to defend and enforce \\"the FCC decision under the Obama Administration to adopt strong network neutrality rules that deemed internet service providers to be common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act.\\"  Broadband competition and access  Clinton has been critical of the lack of broadband competition, stating that the monopolies \\"[use] their power to raise prices, limit choices for consumers, lower wages for workers, and hold back competition from startups and small businesses.\\" Her 2016 platform proposes to \\"reduce regulatory barriers to the private provision of broadband services\\", \\"coordinate the development of broadband infrastructure with other municipal services\\" and \\"develop public- private partnerships for broadband.\\" She proposes to create a grant program encouraging local governments to reduce regulatory barriers to private investment; promote \\"dig once\\" programs that install fiber or fiber conduit during road construction projects; and develop public-private partnerships. In June 2016, Clinton released a comprehensive technology plan.Jon Swartz, Clinton wants high-speed Internet in every U.S. home by 2020, USA Today (June 30, 2016). The plan calls for every American household to have access to high- speed Internet by 2020, as part of her $275 billion infrastructure program.Dawn Chmielewski, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are worlds apart on tech policy issues, Recode (June 30, 2016). The plan also proposes expanding free Wi-Fi in public places, such as recreation centers, airports, and train stations. Clinton has said that she would seek \\"to speed development of next- generation 5G mobile technology and free up spectrum to make way for more connected devices.\\" She has proposed to continue investments in the Connect America Fund, the Rural Utilities Service program, the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), and Lifeline. She wants to expand federal funding to bring free Wi-Fi and high-speed Internet to \\"recreation centers, public buildings like one-stop career centers, and transportation infrastructure such as train stations, airports, and mass transit systems.\\" She proposed to encourage state and local governments to relax rules that protect incumbents from new competitors, such as \\"local rules governing utility-pole access that restrain additional fiber and small cell broadband deployment.\\" She proposes to push federal agencies to identify anticompetitive practices \\"such as tying arrangements, price fixing, and exclusionary conduct,\\" and refer potential violations of antitrust law to the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission.  Patent reform  Clinton has \\"pledged to continue the Obama Administration's efforts to rein in frivolous lawsuits by patent trolls, supporting laws that would curb forum shopping.\\" She wants to require that specific allegations be made in demand letters and pleadings in patent litigation, and to increase transparency in ownership by making patent litigants disclose the real party in interest. She has called for faster review of patent applications, and investment in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to make it act faster and ensure that only valid patents are issued.  Other  Clinton opposes the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), stating that the bill would \\"unnecessarily restrict the free flow of data online\\". = Voting rights = In June 2015, Clinton called for sweeping changes in national voter access laws, including automatically registering American citizens to vote at age 18 and mandating 20 days of early voting in all states. Clinton has criticized laws passed by Republican-controlled state legislatures that do not permit student IDs at polling places, place limits on early voting, and eliminate same-day voter registration. Clinton has said: \\"Today Republicans are systematically and deliberately trying to stop millions of American citizens from voting. What part of democracy are they afraid of?\\" Clinton alleged that Republican efforts to limit voter registration have a disproportionate impact on \\"people of color, poor people and young people.\\" In 2013, Clinton gave a speech to the American Bar Association, in which she \\"slammed the Supreme Court's Shelby County ruling that year weakening the Voting Rights Act (VRA), called on Congress to fix the landmark law and urged the Obama administration to step up enforcement of voting rights cases.\\"Zachary Roth, Hillary Clinton has been outspoken on voting rights, MSNBC (April 14, 2015). = Kenneth Starr investigation = As First Lady, she referred to the Lewinsky scandal as being part of a politically motivated \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\" against President Bill Clinton.Philip Bump, Hillary Clinton dusts off the 'vast right-wing conspiracy' charge. Does she have a point?, The Washington Post (July 8, 2015). Clinton later wrote in her 2003 autobiography that \\"I might have phrased my point more artfully, but I stand by the characterization of [Kenneth] Starr's investigation.\\" =LGBT rights= ;First Lady of the United States On December 9, 1999, Clinton told a group of gay contributors that LGBT people should be allowed to openly serve in the United States military. Also that same day, Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson stated she supported the Defense of Marriage Act and that \\"same-sex unions should be recognized and that same-sex unions should be entitled to all the rights and privileges that every other American gets.\\" On January 10, 2000, Clinton stated she opposed legalizing same-sex marriage. ;107th United States Congress On February 1, 2001, Clinton voted against the George W.

I think this is a reminder that if you stand for equal rights, if you stand against discrimination, you don't just do it once and you're done,\\" and \\"You've got to keep fighting for it, you've got to keep standing up for it, you've got to keep moving forward.\\" On December 17, 2015, Clinton revealed a comprehensive plan for LGBT rights, including an endorsement of federal ban LGBT conversion therapy for minors.

Maddow asked Clinton about her thoughts on Republican ideas to abolish the VA or privatize the VA, and what she would do to fix the problems at the VA. In response, Clinton acknowledged that there were problems, \\"but it's not been as widespread as it has been made out to be. There have been a number of surveys of veterans, and overall, veterans who do get treated are satisfied with their treatment ... Nobody would believe that from the coverage that you see and the constant berating of the VA that comes from the Republicans, in part, in pursuit of this ideological agenda that they have.\\" Clinton said that recent efforts to speed up treatment for veterans should be given a chance to work, but that VA health reforms may need a \\"SWAT team\\" to ensure accountability.Bruce Japsen, Hillary Clinton Says VA May Need 'SWAT Team' To Improve Veterans Healthcare, Forbes (October 23, 2015). = Video game regulation = Clinton urged an inquiry into the \\"Hot Coffee\\" mod of the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, which unlocked hidden sexually graphic images. She said that if the game's manufacturer did not change the game's ESRB rating from M (Mature 17+) to AO (Adults Only 18+), she would introduce federal legislation to regulate video games. On July 20, 2005, the ESRB changed the rating and as a result, the game was removed from the shelves of Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, and other stores. Five months later, Clinton introduced the legislation anyway. On December 16, 2005, Clinton introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act, S.2126, a bill that would prohibit the sale of sexual or violent video games to anybody under the age of 18. = Women's rights = In 2015, Clinton said that she \\"absolutely\\" considers herself a feminist. In 2014, Clinton defined being a \\"feminist\\" as favoring equal rights for women, saying, \\"I don't see anything controversial about that at all.\\" She also told those who think of feminism as outdated, \\"I don't think you've lived long enough.\\" \\"[W]omen and girls ... [are] central to our foreign policy,\\" adding that nations that support women are more stable and \\"less likely to breed extremism.\\" Clinton has promoted equal pay for equal work and proposes action to close the gender pay gap. She supports the Paycheck Fairness Act. As a Senator, Clinton co-sponsored the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009; during her 2016 campaign, Clinton received the endorsement of the Act's namesake, Lilly Ledbetter.Anne Gearan, Equal pay litigant Lilly Ledbetter endorses Clinton, Washington Post (January 29, 2016).Valentina Zarya, This Equal Pay Champion Just Endorsed Hillary Clinton, Fortune (January 29, 2016). In 2014, Clinton supported an Oregon state Equal Rights Amendment, which provides legal protection against discrimination based on sex.Oregon Constitution, Article I, ¬ß 46 (2014) Clinton has called for the U.S. to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which was signed by President Jimmy Carter in 1980 but never ratified by the Senate. Clinton said in 2016 that if elected president, she will fill half of her Cabinet with women, a move that would be historic in the United States. Gender-equal cabinets are rare worldwide. Clinton gave an influential speech called \\"Women's Rights are Human Rights\\" on September 5, 1995 at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. In 2013, she launched a partnership between the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995. This is called \\"No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project.\\" As Secretary of State, Clinton created the post of Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues. = Zika = Clinton has been critical of Congress's handling of the Zika outbreak in Florida. In August 2016, she stated that she was \\"very disappointed that the Congress went on recess before agreeing what resources to put in this fight.\\" She stated that \\"We need to step up mosquito control and abatement, provide families with critical health services, including access to contraception, develop a vaccine and treatment, and ensure people know how to protect themselves and their kids.\\"  References  External links  * On the Issues issue positions * Project Vote Smart candidate information including issue positions * Select2008 ‚Äì Compare and choose candidates to the 2008 presidential election ‚Äì Japanese * Security and Opportunity for the Twenty-first Century by Hillary Clinton, Foreign Affairs * Hillary Rodham Clinton positions on other top foreign policy issues by Council on Foreign Relations * Clinton & environmental issues: Comprehensive review from the League of Conservation Voters. * 2008 Presidential Candidate Health Plan Report Card issued by the National Physicians Alliance * \\"Wahoo-wonk: Clinton talks policy with UVA class\\" * Envisioning the Future: The 2008 Presidential Candidates' Health Reform Proposals from The Commonwealth Fund Political positions Category:Political positions of the 2008 United States presidential candidates Category:Political positions of the 2016 United States presidential candidates Category:Political positions of United States senators ","title":"Political positions of Hillary Clinton"},{"id":"3963037","text":"The Presidents Club Charitable Trust is a British charity known for an annual charity dinner held from 1985 to 2018. The dinner, held usually at The Dorchester hotel in London, was for male guests only and was considered a \\"mainstay of London‚Äôs social calendar\\". After the Financial Times reported on sexual misconduct at the 2018 dinner, the charity announced its intent to disband. The charitable trust's joint chairmen as of 2018 were the property developer Bruce Ritchie and the businessman and Department for Education director David Meller. Charity dinners The 360 guests at the annual dinners ‚Äì all men ‚Äì included leading figures in business, entertainment and politics. They would pay for a dinner and participate in auctions of such prizes as meetings with influential people. The proceeds would go to charities, including children's charities, and other organisations, for example the British Olympic Association and Disability Rights International. In 2008, guests at the dinner organised by Harvey Goldsmith included Justin King, Harold Tillman and Robert Tchenguiz. In 2010, guests at the dinner organised by Peter Shalson and sponsored by HSBC included Len Blavatnik, Mike Sherwood, Charles Dunstone, Sir Martin Sorrell, Richard Desmond, Bernie Ecclestone, Flavio Briatore, Nick Candy, David Reuben, Gerald Ronson, Howard Shore, Harvey Goldsmith, Jarvis Astaire, Jimmy Lahoud, Dan Wagner, and Jimmy Tarbuck. 2018 sexual harassment controversy In January 2018, the Financial Times sent two undercover reporters to join the 130 scantily clad \\"hostesses\\" specially hired for the event by the Artista agency. It reported that several of the guests had sexually harassed or assaulted the hostesses in the course of the evening. The lead reporter, Madison Marriage, wrote that the hostesses were subject to groping, lewd comments, requests to join guests in their bedrooms, questions whether they were prostitutes, and that one attendee exposed his penis to a hostess. Marriage said that she herself had been groped several times. The event's brochure included a full-page warning that harassment would not be tolerated, and that the Presidents Club would not be liable for it if it did happen. The report caused a scandal in the United Kingdom, and commentators connected the event to the #MeToo movement, the Harvey Weinstein scandal and resulting allegations indicating frequent sexual abuse of women. Within a day, the Presidents Club announced that it would disband. Some MPs called for the resignation of children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi, who had been among the guests, as well as for a police investigation of the event. Presidents Club co-chairman David Meller resigned from his Department of Education directorship. Jonathan Mendelsohn, another of the guests, was removed from the Labour frontbench in the House of Lords. Several bookshops stopped the sale of books by the comedian David Walliams, who had hosted the event and put up the right to name a character in his next book as a prize. All of these men said to the media that they had neither participated in nor witnessed any misconduct.

Situated below the ilium and behind the pubis, it is one of these three bones whose fusion creates the hip. The superior portion of this bone forms approximately one third of the acetabulum. Structure The ischium is made up of three parts‚Äìthe body, the superior ramus and the inferior ramus. The body contains a prominent spine, which serves as the origin for the superior gemellus muscle. The indentation inferior to the spine is the lesser sciatic notch. Continuing down the posterior side, the ischial tuberosity is a thick, rough-surfaced prominence below the lesser sciatic notch. This is the portion that supports weight while sitting (especially noticeable on a hard surface) and can be felt simply by sitting on the fingers. It serves as the origin for the inferior gemellus muscle and the hamstrings. The superior ramus is a partial origin for the internal obturator and the external obturator muscles. The inferior ramus serves partially as origin for part of the adductor magnus muscle and the gracilis muscle. The inferior ischial ramus joins the inferior ramus of the pubis anteriorly and is the strongest of the hip (coxal) bones. =Body= The body enters into and constitutes a little more than two-fifths of the acetabulum. Its external surface forms part of the lunate surface of the acetabulum and a portion of the acetabular fossa. Its internal surface is part of the wall of the lesser pelvis; it gives origin to some fibers of the internal obturator. No muscles insert on the body. Its anterior border projects as the posterior obturator tubercle. From its posterior border there extends backward a thin and pointed triangular eminence, more or less elongated in different subjects, the ischial spine, origin of the gemellus superior muscle. Above the spine is a large notch, the greater sciatic notch; Below the spine is a smaller notch, the lesser sciatic notch. =Superior ramus= The superior ramus of the ischium (descending ramus) projects downward and backward from the body and presents for examination three surfaces: external, internal, and posterior. The external surface is quadrilateral in shape. It is bounded above by a groove that lodges the tendon of the external obturator; below, it is continuous with the inferior ramus; in front it is limited by the posterior margin of the obturator foramen; behind, a prominent margin separates it from the posterior surface. In front of this margin the surface gives origin to the quadratus femoris, and anterior to this to some of the fibers of origin of the external obturator; the lower part of the surface gives origin to part of the adductor magnus. The internal surface forms part of the bony wall of the lesser pelvis. In front it is limited by the posterior margin of the obturator foramen. Below, it is bounded by a sharp ridge that provides attachment to a falciform prolongation of the sacrotuberous ligament, and, more anteriorly, gives origin to the transverse perineal and ischiocavernosus muscles. Posteriorly the ramus forms a large swelling, the tuberosity of the ischium, where the hamstrings originate. =Inferior ramus= The inferior ramus of the ischium (ascending ramus) is the thin, flattened part of the ischium, which ascends from the superior ramus, and joins the inferior ramus of the pubis‚Äîthe junction being indicated in the adult by a raised line. The outer surface is uneven for the origin of the obturator externus and some of the fibers of the adductor magnus; its inner surface forms part of the anterior wall of the pelvis. Its medial border is thick, rough, slightly everted, forms part of the outlet of the pelvis, and presents two ridges and an intervening space. The ridges are continuous with similar ones on the inferior ramus of the pubis: to the outer is attached the deep layer of the superficial perineal fascia (fascia of Colles), and to the inner the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm. Tracing these two ridges downward, they join with each other just behind the point of origin of the transverse perineal muscles. Here the two layers of fascia are continuous behind the posterior border of the muscle. To the intervening space, just in front of the point of junction of the ridges, the transverse perineal attaches, and in front of this is a portion of the ischiocavernosus, and the crus penis in the male, or the crus clitoridis in the female. Its lateral border is thin and sharp, and forms part of the medial margin of the obturator foramen. Clinical significance Clinically, an avulsion fracture of the ischial tuberosity may occur. Avulsion fractures of the hip bone (avulsion or tearing away of the ischial tuberosity) may occur in adolescents and young adults during sports that require sudden acceleration or deceleration forces, such as sprinting or kicking in football, soccer, jumping hurdles, basketball, and martial arts. These fractures occur at tubercles (bony projections that lack secondary ossification centers). Avulsion fractures occur where muscles are attached: anterior superior and inferior iliac spines, ischial tuberosities, and ischiopubic rami. A small part of bone with a piece of a tendon or ligament attached is avulsed (torn away). Ischial bursitis (also known as weaver's bottom) is inflammation of the synovial bursa located between the gluteus maximus muscle and the ischial tuberosity, and is usually caused by prolonged sitting on a hard surface. History Adoption of ischium into English-language medical literature dates back to c. 1640; the Latin term derives from Greek ·º∞œÉœáŒØŒøŒΩ iskhion meaning \\"hip joint\\". The division of the acetabulum into ischium (·º∞œÉœáŒØŒøŒΩ) and ilium (ŒªŒ±Œ≥œéŒΩ, os lagonicum) is due to Galen, De ossibus. Galen, however, omits mention of the pubis as a separate bone.De ossibus chapter 20, ed. K√ºhn, vol. 2, p. 772, cited after Charles Singer, C. Rabin, A Prelude to Modern Science: Being a Discussion of the History, Sources and Circumstances of the 'Tabulae Anatomicae Sex' of Vesalius, Cambridge University Press, 1946 (reprinted 2012), p. 35. Other animals=Dinosaurs= The clade Dinosauria is divided into the Saurischia and Ornithischia based on hip structure, including importantly that of the ischium.Seeley, H.G. (1888). \\"On the classification of the fossil animals commonly named Dinosauria.\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, 43: 165-171. In the majority of dinosaurs, the ischium extends down from the ilium and towards the tail of the animal. The acetabulum, which can be thought of as a \\"hip-socket\\", is a cup-shaped opening on each side of the pelvic girdle formed where the ischium, ilium, and pubis all meet, and into which the head of the femur inserts. The orientation and position of the acetabulum is one of the main morphological traits that caused dinosaurs to walk in an upright posture with their legs directly underneath their bodies.Martin, A.J.

It serves the town of Greta opening on 24 March 1862 as Farthing being renamed in 1878.Greta Station NSWrail.net It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. It briefly served as the terminus of the Great Northern Railway when it was extended from Lochinvar. In May 1863 Greta lost its terminus status when the line was extended to Singleton.Greta Railway Station NSW Environment & Heritage The station initially consisted of one platform with the current Platform 2 added in 1915 when the line was duplicated. The Platform 1 building was built in 1889, the Platform 2 shelter in 1915 and the footbridge in 1922. Platforms & services Greta has two side platforms. It is serviced by NSW TrainLink Hunter Line services travelling between Newcastle, Muswellbrook and Scone.  Description  The heritage-listed complex includes the two station buildings: a second class wayside station of type 3 design dating from 1889, and a duplication station of type 11 design dating from 1915, with brick platform faces also from 1915. A 1899 parcels office, 1915 type 3 skillion roofed signal box and 1922 footbridge are also heritage-listed, as are the trees on the up side of the station and historic fencing, signs and lighting within the station complex.  Heritage listing  Greta station group is perhaps the best late 19th century station group surviving from the period before the introduction of standard and economical construction methods around 1890. Its significance is enhanced by its intactness and completeness. The station building and residence (no longer owned by State Rail) are particularly fine buildings and the residence appears to be of unique design. The station building is the only surviving example of its kind without significant alteration. The site exhibits layering of different periods and styles, largely due to duplication and the need for additional buildings at that time. As new buildings were constructed at each stage and buildings were not extended (with the exception of the awning on the signal box) it displays a range of unaltered structures from various periods co-existing at one location. The footbridge, signs, lights, fencing and other details of the site add to the significance and completeness of the site and help create what is a unique small country railway station group. Greta railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare.

The process of personal branding involves finding your uniqueness, building a reputation on the things you want to be known for, and then allowing yourself to be known for them. Ultimately, the goal is to create something that conveys a message and that can be monetized. Whereas some self-help practices focus on self-improvement, personal branding defines success as a form of self-packaging. The term is thought to have originated from an article written by Tom Peters in 1997. In Be Your Own Brand, first published in 1999, marketers David McNally and Karl Speak wrote: \\"Your brand is a perception or emotion, maintained by somebody other than you, that describes the total experience of having a relationship with you.\\" Individuals sometimes associate personal names or pseudonyms with their businesses. Notably, 45th President of the United States and real estate mogul Donald Trump uses his last name on properties and other enterprises (e.g. Trump Tower). Celebrities may also leverage their social status to support organizations for financial or social gain. For example, Kim Kardashian endorses brands and products through her media influence. The relationship between brands and consumers is dynamic and must be constantly refined. This continuous process demonstrates the ambivalence of consumerism.Banet-Weiser, Sarah (2012). Authentic‚Ñ¢The Politics of Ambivalence in a Brand Culture. New York: NYU Press. Bop Design estimates that 80% of consumers are more likely to evaluate solutions from the brands they follow on a social network. A personal brand is a widely-recognized and largely-uniform perception or impression of an individual based on their experience, expertise, competencies, actions and/or achievements within a community, industry, or the marketplace at large. Personal brands may be deliberately modified to reinvent a public persona. This may be to recover from a public embarrassment, or to re-emerge from obscurity. The public perception of authenticity often determines the success of a rebranding.  History  Personal branding, self-positioning, and all individual branding by whatever name, were first introduced in 1937 in the book Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. In Chapter 6 ‚Äì Organized Planning, Planning the Sale of Services‚Äì Hill states, \\"It should be encouraging to know that practically all the great fortunes began in the form of compensation for personal services, or from the sale of IDEAS.\\" The idea surfaced later in the 1981 book Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind, by Al Ries and Jack Trout. More specifically in \\"Chapter 23. Positioning Yourself and Your Career - You can benefit by using positioning strategy to advance your own career. Key principle: Don't try to do everything yourself. Find a horse to ride\\". It was later popularized by Tom Peters. Personal branding has gained significance due to the use of the Internet, as social media and online identities affect the physical world. Employers are increasingly using social media tools to vet applicants before offering them interviews. Practices include searching an applicant's history on sites such as Facebook and Twitter, and conducting background checks using search engines and other tools. This is leading to the decline of resume-only job applications, in favor of presenting other forms of personal branding. These may include links to a professional profile (such as LinkedIn), a personal blog, a portfolio of industry-related articles, and evidence of an online following. These efforts may improve a person's chances of obtaining a job.  Personal Branding Steps  Step 1: Perform an audit of your online footprint. Step 2: Remove threats hurting your reputation in search results. Step 3: Create and post assets highlighting your best qualities. Step 4: Strengthen your credibility through reputation maintenance. Step 5: Monitor the results and tweak your strategy based on successes.  Goffman's Self- presentation theory  Erving Goffman's Self-presentation theory explores the way people want to be seen and how people are perceived by their peers. Goffman uses the term Dramaturgy to describe looking at one's own persona as a drama, treating your actions as an actor in a play. One can control how they are viewed by their peers, and in the case of celebrities or athletes, can build a personal brand through utilizing what they present to their publics using various social media outlets. Self-presentation theory and personal branding go hand in hand, we see celebrities and athletes building a particular brand, or persona over with the use of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Building a personal brand is a big part of a celebrity's life, and it can help them spread awareness and also provide an outlet to connect with their fans/supporters. This is made possible through the use of social media and the ability of the person looking to build a personal brand to make their messages heard. The theory of self-presentation looks at how people look to create an identity for themselves that they would like to be seen as by their peers or in the public eye. This is what Goffman calls the front stage. The front stage is a key component of this theory and it is a way a person acts when in public or around other people to build a certain persona for how they would like others to view them. The front stage is where celebrities and athletes tend to build their own brand and show many positive, deliberate messages that will try to portray them in a certain light in which the person would like to be seen. As opposed to what Goffman refers to as the back stage, which is a particular way a person acts when they are not in public or not posting on social media, trying to build a particular persona or brand they would like others to see. There are many examples of celebrities building a brand for themselves over some sort of social media platform. In fact, it is rare to see an athlete or celebrity without a social media page whether it is Twitter or Instagram. Celebrities use these outlets as ways of branding themselves, by showing people their lives and having fans feel close to them, almost like they are friends, and have a connection through social media outlets such as Twitter and Instagram. Also, to keep more of their fans interested, and to reach as many as possible many celebrities will update daily on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat so their message can be seen by a wider audience. They can keep fans informed on everything from what they want to wear, to their political views. Social Media has provided a simple way for celebrities to get their personal brand to reach a wider audience, and they utilize the 'front stage' to influence people in a particular way and to make themselves look good in the public eye. The 'back stage' is part of Goffman's theory of self-presentation theory, and it is happenings or beliefs people wouldn't want their peers or public to necessarily see or hear. These are happenings that go on behind the scenes that can oftentimes hurt someone's reputation and are avoided when a celebrity is trying to build a personal brand. These are often personal happenings, or beliefs that will negatively effect how an audience will look at the brand you are building. There are numerous examples of celebrities saying something that they didn't want their public to hear but got out and this hurts the brand they are building. One example of this is when LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling made racist comments to his then girlfriend and she had recorded them and put them on her social media. Donald Sterling was quickly removed from the team and is no longer associated with the NBA. This is an example of how something in the back stage will negatively affect what you want the public to see you as. Self-presentation theory is very apparent in the world of celebrities and professional athletes and is a big part of building a brand for themselves. Goffman's theory seems to identify itself well with the personal branding of these celebrities and you can see why they would want to utilize social media to positively show a message they want to be heard by their public (front stage) and avoid more personal beliefs that may negatively effect their brand (back stage).  Social media  Social media can be \\"roughly defined as 'a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0 and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content'\\".Dijck, Jos√© Van. \\"Chapter 1: Engineering Sociality in a Culture of Connectivity.\\" The Culture of Connectivity: A Critical History of Social Media. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2013. N. pag. Print. Social media extends beyond just Facebook and Twitter and into the professional world as well. There are general professional profiles like LinkedIn and company or industry-specific networks, such as Slack. Because of these professional networks, self-branding is useful in finding a job or improving one's professional standing. As an online open source, social media has become a place that is fulfilled with highly reliable and resourceful information to target user identities.Ang, L., Khamis, S., & Welling, R. (2017). Self-branding, ‚Äòmicro-celebrity‚Äô and the rise of social media influencers. Celebrity Studies, 8(2), 191-208. doi: 10.1080/19392397.2016.1218292 Building a brand and an online presence through internal corporate networks allows for individuals to network with their colleagues, not only socially but professionally as well. This kind of interaction allows for employees to build up their personal brand relative to other employees, as well as spur innovation within the company because more people can learn from more people. Some social media sites, like Twitter, can have a flattened, all-encompassing audience that can be composed of professional and personal contacts, which then can be seen as a more \\"'professional' environment with potential professional costs\\".Marwick, A. E., and D. Boyd. \\"I Tweet Honestly, I Tweet Passionately: Twitter Users, Context Collapse, and the Imagined Audience.\\" New Media & Society 13.1 (2011): 114-33. Sage Journals. Web. 20 May 2014. Because of its explicitly public nature, Twitter becomes a double-sided platform that can be utilized in different ways depending on the amount of censorship a user decides on. Personal branding focuses on \\"self-packaging,\\" where \\"success is not determined by individuals' internal sets of skills, motivations, and interests but, rather, by how effectively they are‚Ä¶branded\\";Lair, D. J. \\"Marketization and the Recasting of the Professional Self: The Rhetoric and Ethics of Personal Branding.\\" Management Communication Quarterly 18.3 (2005): 307-43. Sage Journals. Web. 20 May 2014. it is more about self-promotion rather than true self-expression. The difference between the two is that self-promotion is deliberately intentional in all aspects because the individual is purposely shaping their image or persona, while self-expression can even be a byproduct of promotion.Dijck, J. Van. \\"'You Have One Identity': Performing the Self on Facebook and LinkedIn.\\" Media, Culture & Society 35.2 (2013): 199-215. Sage Journal. Web. 19 May 2014. Aside from professional aspirations, personal branding can also be used on personal-level social networks to flare popularity. The online self is used as a marketing and promotional tool to brand an individual as a type of person; success on the virtual platforms then becomes \\"online social value [that could transform] to real rewards in the offline world.\\" When one is branding themselves on social media they need to consider these three things: \\"crafting their physical footprint, creating their digital footprint, and communicating their message.\\" A prominent example of a self-made self-branded social media icon is Tila Tequila, who rose to prominence in 2006 on the Myspace network, gaining more than 1.5 million friends, through expertly marketing her personal brand. As social media has become a vehicle for self-branding, these moguls have begun to situate the maintenance of their online brand as a job, which brings about new ways to think about work and laborBanet-Weiser, Sarah (2012). Authentic‚Ñ¢The Politics of Ambivalence in a Brand Culture. New York: NYU Press. . The logic of online sites and the presence of feedback means that one's online presence is viewed by others using the same rubric to judge brands: evaluation, ranking, and judgment. Thus, social media network sites serve as complex, technologically mediated venues for the branding of the self.  Criticisms  Personal branding offers promises of increased success in the business world. Thousands of self-help books, programs, personal coaches, and articles exist to help individuals learn to self-brand. These strategies emphasize authenticity and are often framed as becoming 'more of who you are' as well as who 'you were meant to be.'Banet-Weiser, Sarah. \\"Branding the Postfeminist Self: The Labor of Femininity.\\" Authentic‚Ñ¢: The Politics of Ambivalence in a Brand Culture. New York: New York U, 2012. 51-90. Print. The other side of these 'strategies for success' is that this is very subtle self-commodification. Because personal branding is basically pointing out, and in some cases, glorifying, certain positive characteristics of an individual, it is not unlike traditional branding of products and companies. This puts individuals in the place of products, in which their efforts to appear more human are subverted. This possibility is exploited by celebrities and politicians, as \\"marketing individual personalities as products\\" is an effective way to gain millions of fans not just online but in real life as well. For celebrities of all types, online personas are their brands. Public relations for Justin Bieber and Barack Obama alike can easily control the \\"brand\\" and maximize exposure and profitability. On the other hand, personal branding may afford potential employers the opportunity to more accurately judge a candidate's abilities and cultural suitability, since blogs, profiles, websites, etc., are pieces of work that can be evaluated.  Disclosure  Personal branding involves the practice of self-disclosure, and this transparency is part of what Foucault would call \\"the proper care of the self\\". In this sense, disclosure refers to the details of one's everyday life for other's consumption, while transparency is the effect of this kind of disclosure. Transparency essentially works to give viewers a complete view of one's authentic self. Digitally aided disclosure, which involves building a self-brand on a social network site, relies on traditional discourses of the authentic self as one that is transparent, without artifice, and open to others. Authenticity is viewed as both residing inside the self and is also demonstrated by allowing the outside world access to one's inner self. It is interesting to think about the idea of authenticity with disclosure, and the freedom social networks allow in disclosing an inauthentic self. All the while, these posting are forming a digital archive of the self, through which a brand could be crafted by others. An example of this is Carly Fleishmann, whose Twitter posting created an iconicity and brand without her ever speaking out loud. Another example of a figure who rose to prominence through this disclosure is Ingrid Nilsen, who posted a video on YouTube coming out as lesbian and subsequently took off as a YouTube star. Through disclosure individuals are able to go through the process of personal branding.

A coal breaker is a coal processing plant which breaks coal into various useful sizes. Coal breakers also remove impurities from the coal (typically slate) and deposit them into a culm dump. The coal breaker is a forerunner of the modern coal preparation plant.Carris, David M. \\"A Historic Perspective.\\" In Designing the Coal Preparation Plant of the Future. Barbara J. Arnold, Mark S. Klima, and Peter J. Bethell, eds. Littleton, Colo.: Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration, 2007. Generally speaking, a coal tipple was typically used at a bituminous coal mine, where removing impurities was important but sorting by size was only a secondary, minor concern. Coal breakers were always used (with or without a tipple) at anthracite mines. While tipples were used around the world, coal breakers were used primarily in the United States in the state of Pennsylvania (where, between 1800 and the mid-20th century, many of the world's known anthracite reserves were located).Rottenberg, Dan. In the Kingdom of Coal: An American Family and the Rock That Changed the World. Florence, Ky.: Routledge, 2003. As of 2007, the vast majority of proven anthracite coal reserves were located primarily in Asia. The following anthracite coal producing nations held the following estimated reserves: Russia, 6,870 megatonnes (MT); China, 6,350 MT; Ukraine, 5,860 MT; Vietnam, 2,230 MT; North Korea, 1,425 MT; South Africa, 710 MT; South Korea, 240 MT; Spain, 195 MT; Canada, 100 MT; Poland, 62.5 MT; and the U.S., 50 MT. See: Marston, Richard and Ewart, Jr., Don. \\"Upcoming Trends in World Anthracite Trade.\\" 2d World Anthracite Conference. Kiev, Ukraine. September 17‚Äì18, 2007. At least one source claims that, in 1873, coal breaking plants were found only at anthracite mines in Pennsylvania.Macfarlane, James. The Coal-Regions of America: Their Topography, Geology, and Development. New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1873. Function Coal breaker at an anthracite coal mine near Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 1905 The first function of a coal breaker is to break coal into pieces and sort these pieces into categories of nearly uniform size, a process known as breaking.Ketchum, Milo Smith. The Design of Mine Structures. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1912. The second function of a coal breaker is to remove impurities (such as slate or rock), and then grade the coal on the basis of the percent of impurities remaining. The sorting by size is particularly important for anthracite coal. In order to burn efficiently, air must flow evenly around anthracite. Subsequently, most anthracite coal is sold in uniform sizes. In the 1910s, there were six commercial sizes of coal (with the smallest size having three subsets):International Textbook Company. International Library of Technology: A Series of Textbooks for Persons Engaged in the Engineering Professions and Trades. Vol. 38. Scranton, Pa.: International Textbook Co., 1903. * Steam ‚Äì in size (primarily used as steamship fuel). * Broken ‚Äì in size. * Egg ‚Äì in size. * Stove ‚Äì in size (primarily used in home cooking stoves). * Chestnut ‚Äì in size. * Pea ‚Äì in size. There were three subsets of \\"pea coal\\":  No. 1 Buckwheat ‚Äì in size.  No. 2 Buckwheat ‚Äì in size.  No. 3 Buckwheat ‚Äì in size. Coal pieces smaller than in size were considered \\"culm,\\" and unable to be separated from the impurities (and thus useless). The grade of coal ranged from a low of 5 percent impurities for steam or broken coal to a high of 15 percent for pea- size coal and its subsets. Pre-breaker treatment of coal Coal breakers were generally located as close to the anthracite mine entrance as possible, so as to minimize the distance the coal had to travel before processing.Greene, Homer. Coal and the Coal Mines. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and company, 1889. Prior to entering the breaker, the coal would be crushed and sorted in a coal tipple and, if necessary and if water was available, washed. All coal was screened in the tipple as it came out of the mine so that steam-sized or smaller pieces could travel immediately to the coal washer and/or coal breaker. Chunks of coal which were too large were then crushed (sometimes several times) in the tipple until it passed through the screen (e.g., was of acceptable steam size or smaller). Raw coal often contains impurities such as slate, sulphur, ash (or \\"bone\\"), clay, or soil, which requires that it be cleaned before shipment to market. Mine workers sampled the coal as it came out of the mine to determine whether the level of impurity recommended washing (if washing was available). Slate, sulphur, and ash have a higher relative density than coal, and will sink in agitated water.Foster, Thomas J. Coal Miners' Pocketbook. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Publishing Co., 1910. Passing the coal through the tipple was an essential pre-treatment process for coal washing, however, because the impure coal must be of similar sized lumps for coal washing to work. If coal washing was conducted, coal might enter the breaker \\"wet\\". This meant the incline of the various belts and conveyors had to be lowered so that the coal did not slide on the belts or move too quickly down chutes. Where coal washing was used, the coal breaker was expanded to handle both \\"dry\\" and \\"wet\\" coal simultaneously. History of coal breakers and their technology Coal being sorted by size and impurities removed on a \\"dry\\" screen at the Saint Nicholas breaker near Gilberton, Pennsylvania, in 1938. Prior to 1830, bituminous and anthracite coal received little processing. The individual miner would use a sledgehammer to break up large lumps of coal, then use a rake whose teeth were set two inches apart to collect the larger pieces of coal for transport to the surface.Korson, George Gershon. Black Rock: Mining Folklore of the Pennsylvania Dutch. Manchester, N.H.: Ayer Publishing, 1950. Smaller lumps of coal were considered nonmarketable and left in the mine. Beginning about 1830, surface processing of coal began. Lumps of coal were placed on plates of perforated cast iron and men known as \\"breakers\\" would hammer on the coal until it was in lumps small enough to fall through the holes. The coal fell into a second screen, where it was shaken (by hand, animal, steam, or water power) and the smaller lumps sorted. This \\"broken and screened\\" coal was worth much more than lump coal. Although bituminous coal had been widely burned as fuel since ancient times, anthracite coal did not come into widespread use until the 1820s.Owen, George. The Description of Pembrokeshire. Dillwyn Miles, ed. Llandysul, West Wales, UK: Gomer Press, 1994, Shortly after the start of the 19th century, experiments in the United States showed that if anthracite coal lumps were more uniform in size and air flowed more evenly around the fuel, anthracite would burn hotter, more cleanly, and for a longer period of time than bituminous coal.Swank, James Moore. Introduction to a History of Ironmaking and Coal Mining in Pennsylvania. Philadelphia: James Moore Swank, 1878; Scharf, John Thomas and Westcott, Thompson. History of Philadelphia, 1609-1884. Vol. 3. Philadelphia: L.H. Everts, 1884. Jesse Fell was the first to successfully burn anthracite coal on an open air grate. His method and 'discovery' in Wilkes-Barre, PA in 1808 led to the widespread use of coal as the fuel source that helped to foster America's industrial revolution. Anthracite coal began to be widely used in Wales in 1813 and France by 1814, and throughout the eastern United States by 1828.Freese, Barbara. Coal: A Human History. Cambridge, Mass.: Da Capo Press, 2003. Efforts were soon made to discover ways to process anthracite coal to achieve the desired uniformity. The modern coal breaker can be traced to 1844. Joseph Battin, a supervisor at a coal gas manufacturing plant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, invented the first coal breaker‚Äîtwo cast iron rollers (one with teeth, one with holes to accept the teeth) through which the coal was crushed before it rolled down a chute and then through an inclined cylindrical screen. The screen had a mesh which was fine toward the front and became progressively less so toward the end. Larger chunks of coal, falling inside the cylinder as it rotated, broke up and eventually passed through the screen. Impurities, which were heavier, tended to exit the breaker at the end of the screen. The sorted coal would then be collected in bins below the screen, and transported to market. A fellow Pennsylvanian, Gideon Bast, licensed the technology from Battin, and erected the first commercial coal breaker in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, on February 28, 1844. A number of coal processing machines‚Äîsuch as rollers, crushers, washers, and screens‚Äîwere developed in Europe and later utilized in the United States. By 1866, the coal breaker in the United States had taken the form most recognized today, with multiple stories and numerous screening processes and mechanical sorting devices.Daddow, Samuel Harries and Bannan, Benjamin. Coal, Iron, and Oil, or, The Practical American Miner: A Plain and Popular Work on Our Mines and Mineral Resources, and Text-book or Guide to Their Economical Development. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott, 1866. The first steam-powered shaking screens were used in the U.S. 1890, and the first steam- powered coal washers installed in 1892. Until about 1900, nearly all anthracite coal breakers were labor-intensive. The removal of impurities was done by hand, usually by boys between the ages of 8 and 12 years old known as breaker boys.Freedman, Russell. Kids at Work: Lewis Hine and the Crusade Against Child Labor. Reprint ed. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1998. Batchelor, Bob. The 1900s.

Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2001. Black, Brian. Nature and the Environment in Nineteenth-Century American Life. Santa Barbara, Calif.: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006. The use of breaker boys began in the U.S. around 1866.Derickson, Alan. Black Lung: Anatomy of a Public Health Disaster. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1998. The breaker boys would sit on wooden seats, perched over chutes and conveyor belts, picking slate and other impurities out of the coal.Miller, Randall M. and Pencak, William. Pennsylvania: A History of the Commonwealth. State College, Pa.: Penn State Press, 2003. Novak, Michael. The Guns of Lattimer. Reprint ed. New York: Transaction Publishers, 1996. Breaker boys worked 10 hours a day for six days a week.Phelan, Craig. Divided Loyalties: The Public and Private Life of Labor Leader John Mitchell. Albany, N.Y.: SUNY Press, 1994. The work was hazardous. Breaker boys were forced to work without gloves so that they could handle the slick coal better. The slate, however, was sharp, and boys would leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Many breaker boys lost fingers to the rapidly moving conveyor belts, while others, moving about the plant, had their feet, hands, arms, and legs amputated when they moved among the machinery and accidentally slipped under the belts or into the gears. Many died when they fell into the gears of the machinery, their bodies only retrieved at the end of the working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. The \\"dry\\" coal kicked up so much dust that the breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Breaker boys sort coal at an anthracite coal breaker near South Pittston, Pennsylvania, in 1911. Public outrage against the use of breaker boys was so widespread that in 1885 Pennsylvania enacted a law forbidding the employment of anyone under the age of 12 from working in a coal breaker. But the law was poorly enforced, and many employers and families forged birth certificates or other documents so children could work. Estimates of the number of breaker boys at work in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania vary widely, and official statistics are generally considered by historians to undercount the numbers significantly. Estimates include 20,000 breaker boys working in the state in 1880, 18,000 working in 1900, 13,133 working in 1902, and 24,000 working in 1907.\\"Install Mechanical Slate Pickers.\\" Technical World Magazine. September 1906-February 1907. Technological innovations in the 1890s and 1900s such as mechanical and water separators designed to remove impurities from coal significantly reduced the need for breaker boys,\\"A Great and Efficient Coal Breaker.\\" New York Times. January 6, 1895. but adoption of the new technology was slow. By the 1910s, the use of breaker boys was finally dropping because of improvements in technology, stricter child labor laws, and compulsory schooling laws.Hindman, Hugh D. Child Labor: An American History. Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, 2002. The practice of employing children in coal breakers largely ended by 1920 because of the efforts of the National Child Labor Committee, sociologist and photographer Lewis Hine, and the National Consumers League, who educated the public about the practice and succeeded in passing child labor laws.Cohen, David and Wels, Susan. America Then & Now: Great Old Photographs of America's Life and Times, and How Those Same Scenes Look Today. New York: HarperCollins, 1992. The regulation of coal breakers came slowly in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the government enacted a law in the mid-19th century requiring that coal breakers be built away from mine entrances.Kashuba, Cheryl A. \\"Avondale Mine Disaster Claimed 110 Lives.\\" Scranton Times Tribune. September 6, 2009. But in the U.S., neither the federal government nor the states adopted regulation of coal breakers until after many lives had been lost. Two disasters prompted the adoption of legislation. The first occurred on September 6, 1869, when a small explosion at the Avondale mine in Plymouth, Pennsylvania, blew flames up the mine shaft. The wooden breaker built over the mine opening caught fire and collapsed, trapping and killing 110 workers in the mine below.\\"Group Works to Rehabilitate Avondale Breaker Site.\\" Wilkes-Barre Times Leader.

But in 1871, a fire destroyed the wooden breaker built over a mine opening in West Pittston, Pennsylvania, trapping and killing 24 miners.Raymond, R.W. \\"Biographical Notice of Richard P.

Despite a shift away from wooden construction of coal breakers and opposition from the coal industry, the state of Pennsylvania adopted a law in 1885 requiring that coal breakers be situated at least 200 feet from the opening of any mine. =Dry sorters and wet jigs= A number of inventions in the late 19th century and early 20th century led to the use of mechanical devices for separating impurities from coal in coal breakers. Screens and sorters were used for dry coal. Some examples from the beginning of the 20th century are: :* Sorting bars ‚Äì Sorting bars were iron bars (set in a rectangle 3 to 6 feet wide and 8 to 12 feet long) which were close together where the coal was poured in but which spread progressively further apart, allowing the coal to be roughly separated by the size of each lump. The bars were at an incline, and the heavier slate, ash, and sulphur generally slid off the bars (and down a chute which delivered it to a culm pile) while the coal fell through. :* Oscillating bars ‚Äì Sometimes bars moved back and forth (often at 100 to 150 oscillations per minute), which not only tended to move the coal along the bars toward the end but also shake off dirt and slightly crush the larger lumps of coal into smaller pieces. :* Slate pickers ‚Äì The \\"Houser slate picker\\", invented in 1893,Index of Patents Issued From the United States Patent Office. Washington, D.C.: United States Patent Office, 1894. passed sorted coal of a uniform size over a corrugated iron plate that tended to force the flat slate upright. The upright slate would be caught between horizontal iron bars suspended over the corrugated plate, the bars suspended high enough over the plate to permit coal to pass beneath them. :* Gravity separators ‚Äì One example of a gravity separator is the \\"Herring separator\\". This separator consisted of an inclined chute with a rough surface, at the end of which was an opening in the bottom the chute. The heavier slate, ash, and sulphur would slide along the bottom of the chute, picking up friction from the rough surface and falling through the gap in the bottom of the chute, while the lighter coal would have enough velocity to pass over the gap and continue down the chute for further processing. A Chance \\"wet\\" coal jig separator in operation in the Saint Nicholas breaker near Gilberton, Pennsylvania, in 1938. To handle wet coal, coal jigs were used. Coal jigs separated coal from impurities by using gravity. Since the relative density of uniformly sized pieces of coal, slate, ash, dirt, and sulphur vary, pieces of each element will descend through water at different speeds‚Äîallowing them to be separated. Some examples of coal jigs from the beginning of the 20th century include: :* The \\"Luhrig jig\\" or \\"piston jig\\" \\\\- The piston jig pulled water down through a fine mesh screen so that the lighter coal rose to the top of the water and the heavier impurities did not. A conveyor belt with a paddle scraped across the top of the water as the piston reached the point of highest pressure and scooped the coal off and down a chute, while the heavier impurities (such as slate) were drawn down against an inclined screen and fell down a chute toward the culm pile. :* The moveable pan or \\"Stewart jig\\" - This jig developed after the Luhrig jig, and consisted of a large round tub set at an incline. A perforated metal plate moved up and down about 180 times a minute inside the tub. The movement of the tub created upward water pressure. The lighter coal was pushed toward the top of the tub, where paddles on a conveyor belt scraped it off the top of the water and down a chute for further processing, while the heavier slate tended to stay near the bottom of the tub and slide out an exit gate toward the culm pile. :* Sluice boxes (also known as Scaife trough washers) - Sluice boxes were used to separate small pieces of coal from heavier impurities. Riffles (low ridges set horizontal to the flow of water down the sluice) would capture the heavier impurities while permitting the lighter coal to move on. :* The \\"Christ coal jig\\" - Introduced in 1895, the Christ jig was an inclined rectangular box jig. A perforated iron plate moved up and down inside the box at a rapid rate, creating an upward water pressure that allowed slate to sink toward the bottom of the box (and out a culm gate) while the lighter coal tended to float toward the top of the water (where it was scooped off by a conveyor belt and then down a chute for further processing). :* The \\"Righter coal washer\\" - Invented just before 1900, the Righter coal washer used a conveyor belt with paddles to pass coal slurry over a finely woven iron screen. Dirt and other small particles of impurities tended to sink to the bottom of the water and pass through the screen into a collection tank, while the lighter coal floated in the water until it exited the washer and was collected by a conveyor. :* The \\"chestnut coal jig\\" - This was yet another circular coal jig. Used for lumps of coal which were chestnut size or smaller, the bottom of the jig was a circular tub. A convex (or concave upwards) perforated iron plate moved up and down in the water, creating upward water pressure. The upper part of the jig was a rotating round tub with a spiral shelf running around the inside. The iron plate forced the lighter coal toward the top of the water, where the rotating spiral shelf picked it up and conveyed it to the top of the jig and out a chute. The heavier impurities slid off the iron plate and out a culm gate. :* The Jeffrey-Robinson coal washer - This jig was similar in construction to the chestnut coal jig, but the water reached the top of the upper tub so that both water and coal would be spun out the top of the tub (dropping the coal into a catcher). From 1936 to 1964, the amount of coal processed in wet jigs in the United States rose to 146 million tons per year from 27 million tons per year. Separating, sorting, and jig technology continued to advance in the 20th century. The first compressed air sorter for fine coal (pea and smaller) was installed in the U.S. in 1916. Major innovations in the pneumatic cleaning of coal were made in 1924, 1932, and 1941. In 1935, the first dense-media separator was introduced. In these wet separators, a very dense medium (such as magnetite) is introduced into an agitated mixture of coal and water.Gupta, Ashok and Yan, Denis Stephen. Mineral Processing Design and Operation: An Introduction. Maryland Heights, Mo.: Elsevier, 2006. The dense media drops to the bottom of the tank, sending water and the lighter material (such as coal) over the top for collection and drying. The first coal processing plant to utilize dense-medium separation widely was established by Dutch State Mines in 1945, and by 1950 the technology was in wide use in the U.S. =Shift to coal preparation plants= Methods of drying coal through the use of forced-air dryers, heat, and centrifuges were adopted by American coal companies throughout the 20th century.Inspector's Guidance Manual. Stationary Sources Branch. Air Pollution Control Division. Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Denver, Colo.: Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, June 22, 1998. As many coal breakers handled heavier loads of coal, wooden buildings were abandoned in favor of structures made entirely of steel or reinforced concrete. In the mid-20th century, \\"Diester tables\\"‚Äîoscillating table-sized sluices‚Äîwere widely adopted by the American coal industry, allowing even finer grades of coal to be processed and captured. Other processing devices such as froth flotation jigs and disc filtersHalberthal, Josh. \\"Disc Filters.\\" Solidliquid-Separation.com. No date. Accessed 2009-09-26. were also employed. However, changing demand for coal in the post-World War II era led to the abandonment and consolidation of many coal breaking plants. Tipples, coal washing plants, and coal breakers were often merged into a single large plant to achieve economies of scale. Automation led to very significant reductions in the number of personnel needed to run plants, with smaller modular facilities sometimes requiring only a single operator. These coal preparation plants often accepted coal from several mines, and many were built far away from operating mines. By the 1970s, many coal breakers around the world were being shut down in favor of newer, larger coal preparation plants. The coal breaking process Ideally, coal breakers were placed so that the top of the breaking plant was equal to or slightly below the mine mouth so that gravity would move the coal to the breaking plant. Where this was not possible, coal would be hoisted to the top of the coal breaking plant. A boiler and boilerhouse would be located nearby to provide power for the hoist, moving screens, jigs, and crushers (although in more modern times this is supplied by electricity), along with an engine house (to house the engine for the hoist), pumps and pumphouse (to supply the coal washing machines with water), and headframe (for the hoist). The typical coal breaking plant was often eight or nine stories tall, sometimes rising 150 feet high or more. In the typical coal breaking plant at the beginning of the 20th century, the coal entered the plant at the upper floor and slid down a gently inclined \\"picker table\\" where breaker boys removed obvious impurities such as rocks and large pieces of slate and threw them down chutes to the culm pile. The breakers also removed obviously clean lumps of coal and sent them down a separate \\"clean coal\\" chute for crushing. Lumps intermixed with impurities would go down a third chute for crushing and further cleaning. On the second level of a typical breaker, coal would be roughly sorted. The fuel would move over sorting bars, with the various sizes of coal going down different chutes. Each type of roughly sorted coal would next pass over a \\"slate-picker screen\\" (sometimes called a \\"mud screen\\"), with the generally round coal falling through the screen and the flat slate passing over the screen to fall down a chute to the culm pile. Coal passing through the slate- picker screen would then be sorted by additional screens. Some of these second screens were composed of flat iron perforated by holes of larger size toward the rear (where the coal entered) and smaller holes toward the front. These flat screens were sometimes shaken back and forth (hence the name \\"shaking screens\\"), which not only removed dirt and sulphur from the coal but broke down larger lumps of coal into smaller sizes and sorted it for further cleaning and processing. Other screens were cylindrical, making 10 revolutions per minute and performing the same function as shaking screen. Flat and cylindrical screens could be single-jacketed (a single screen) or double- jacketed (two screens, the first or inner screen having larger openings while the second screen had smaller ones). A company inspector examining coal on a car loading belt at the Saint Nicholas coal breaker in Gilberton, Pennsylvania, one of the two largest coal breakers in the world in 1938. The third level from the top was the crushing level. Most coal was still lump coal at this stage, and needed to be crushed in order to create smaller, more marketable product. Here, a series of interlocking, toothed crushers or rollers would break lump coal into progressively smaller sizes. On the fourth level down, the coal was further cleaned of impurities. This was originally done primarily by hand, but hand picking was gradually supplanted after 1910 by improved screens and jigs. Although breaker boys worked at all levels of the coal breaker, most of the removal of impurities by hand occurred on this level. (Some picking did occur on the ground level of the coal breaker, where boys would locate good pieces of coal in the culm and return it to the \\"clean\\" coal stream.) Some coal might travel to this level directly from second level, if small enough, as at this level the screens and jigs were only capable of handling egg-grade coal and smaller. This area of the coal breaker was also where most dry screens and wet jigs operated. At this level, the use of conveyor belts (with or without paddles or scoops) was necessarily in order to move the smaller grades of coal, with most belts moving at about 33 feet per minute for pea coal and 50 feet per minute for larger grades. Multiple sorting and picking levels might exist in a single coal breaker, depending on the amount of coal to be processed. Coal and culm were received at the ground level. Dry culm was taken away from the coal breaker by conveyor belt or rail car and dumped nearby. Very fine dry culm was sometimes separated from the heavier culm by forced air and blown through tubes to a separate pile. Wet culm was generally held in settling tanks or behind a coal slurry impoundment dam to allow particulate to settle out of the water. The \\"clean\\" coal, emerging from the coal breaker already sorted into its respective sizes, was collected primarily by rail cars and then delivered to market.

Built in 1876, the facility was built to alleviate overcrowding at the state's only other \\"lunatic asylum\\" located in Trenton, New Jersey. Originally built to accommodate 350 people, the facility, having been expanded several times, reached a high of over 7700 patients resulting in unprecedented overcrowding conditions. In 2008, the facility was ordered to be closed as a result of deteriorating conditions and overcrowding. A new facility was built on the large Greystone campus nearby and bears the same name as the aging facility. Despite considerable public opposition and media attention, demolition of the main Kirkbride building began in April 2014 and was completed by October 2015. History Greystone as seen in a postcard from 1923 =Early years= The idea for such a facility was conceived in the early 1870s at the persistent lobbying of Dorothea Dix, a nurse who was an advocate for better health care for people with mental illnesses. At that time in history, New Jersey's state-funded mental health facilities were exceedingly overcrowded and sub-par compared to neighboring states that had more facilities and room to house patients. Greystone was built, all of it, in part to relieve the only ‚Äì and severely overcrowded ‚Äì \\"lunatic asylum\\" in the state, which was located in Trenton, New Jersey. Because of her efforts, the New Jersey Legislature appropriated $2.5 million to obtain about of land for New Jersey‚Äôs second \\"lunatic asylum\\". Great care was taken to select a location central to the majority of New Jersey's population. After visiting approximately 42 different locations, officials approved purchase of a portion of a few farms and lots, on August 29, 1871, near Morristown and a short distance from the Morris and Essex Railroad. The plots of land contained fertile soil, rock quarries for mining stone, a sand pit for building materials and reservoirs for water and ice access. The new asylum, when completed, would hold approximately 600 patients, with the large main building to be completed in sections as usage detailed. The plan of the main building was drafted to allow for a total of 40 wards split into two wings, one wing for each sex. There was to be no communication between wards. The corridors served a purpose other than just separating wards: they provided for fire protection, so that a fire would be unable to spread past a single section of the building. Upper floors in the center section contained apartments for employees, and the third story contained the amusement room and chapel for patients. Samuel Sloan was named architect of the main building and its smaller supporting buildings. Sloan chose to follow the Kirkbride Plan, a list of ideals pertaining to hospital design created by Thomas Story Kirkbride. There would be a center section for administrative purposes, then a wing on each side with three wards on a floor. Each ward would be set back from the previous one to allow patients to take in the beautiful grounds from their wards. Each ward was designed to accommodate 20 patients, with a dining room, exercise room and activity room. The wards were furnished with the highest quality materials such as wool rugs, pianos and fresh flowers. Patients worked on the farms growing and raising food and performed hard labor tasks in the clearing away of building debris, excavating for roads, and sodding grounds. The plan of the institution called for carriage drives ending at all doorways, and a central road leading up to the front entrance flanked by trees on both sides. Grounds on both sides of the wings would provide for simultaneous exercise of both sexes while keeping them separate. An industrial building opened in 1914, allowing for more jobs for patients than just manual labor jobs in farming or groundworks. It was a widely popular belief that putting the insane to work in certain circumstances was beneficial both to the patient and the institution. Those who were chronically ill, restless in the day and night, were thought to be aided in their general well-being by working out some of the oversupply of blood to the brain. Within the walls of the new building, male patients were able to make brooms, rugs, brushes, carpets, and do printing and bookmaking. By 1895, the State Lunatic Asylum was operating at 325 patients over capacity. The overcrowding was a major health and cleanliness issue, resulting in a small outbreak of typhoid fever, eventually blamed on the water supply. The passing of years brought no relief for a bursting hospital, occupied with 1,189 patients bedded down in an institution meant to hold only 800 every night. Cots were placed in activity rooms, exercise halls and hallways in order to try to find sleeping arrangements for all. \\"From a sanitary point of view these cots are an abomination,\\" declared the board of managers. Cots were set up and taken down on a daily basis on the hallways, and were not able to be cleaned between uses. Patients often soiled themselves during the night, and the cots were simply handed out again the following evening. The asylum scrambled to create more housing. By 1901, the new dormitory building was completed and quickly filled, slightly easing crowding issues. Patients were once again able to be grouped according to disease classification and had access to exercise and activity rooms again. The new dormitory building would gain infirmaries and operating rooms in the coming years, as well as a bowling alley which was extremely popular among patients and staff during the winter months when outdoor exercise was not an option. By 1903, the hospital had crossed over the 1,500-patient mark, continuing its steady climb. Once again, the numbers were an issue. A state- of-the-art electroconvulsive therapy room was installed in the main building, and the women‚Äôs wing of the dormitory received a hydrotherapy room. Medical Director Britton D. Evans described this new treatment in his report in 1906, writing, \\"It is well recognized that the application of water at varying degrees of temperature and pressure exerts influences of a valuable therapeutic character upon the entire human economy and aids the recuperative powers of the body.\\" Female patients were able to receive treatment for their afflictions through use of douches, massages, and hot air cabinets. A hydrotherapeutic treatment room for male patients was opened the following year. By 1911, the newly renamed State Asylum at Morris Plains held 2,672 patients, and cots were once again placed in corridors and activity rooms. A photographic department was established and began documenting patients in hopes of cataloging facial expressions and characteristics which go with certain mental disorders. A dental clinic opened for treatment of teeth ailments. A tuberculosis pavilion was finished and occupied the following year, as well as a new larger fire department house, and enlargements to the greenhouse and piggery. In 1916, women began participating in sewing and arts and crafts on the top floor of the Industrial Building, and a small patient library was founded with 184 volumes of books. Annexes to the Dormitory building opened in 1917 to provide more space for housing. The next few years saw much progress in the department of building construction. The Voorhees Cottage and Knight Cottage were opened as homes for nurses, as well as cottages for senior physicians and the superintendent. The Psychiatric Clinic Reception Building opened in 1923 and all operating rooms, laboratories and x-ray equipment were moved to the new building. A Social Service Department was instituted, in charge of letting patients out for \\"trial\\" visits to help them assimilate back into the real world. Parts of the hospital are set aside of \\"War Risk Patients\\" or veterans from World War I suffering from various mental diseases, including the yet-to-be-named post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The hospital was given with its modern-day name, Greystone Park Psychiatric Center, in 1924. The new reception building, dubbed the Curry Building after Medical Superintendent Marcus Curry, opened in 1927, as well as a new fire station, power plant, greenhouse, and auxiliary buildings. The Men's Occupational Therapy Building opened that same year, allowing for patients to take on new duties in service to the hospital such as tailoring and woodworking. 1929 and 1930 proved to very trying times for Greystone. In the two-year span, three fires severely handicapped the institution‚Äôs ability to treat the mentally ill. The most devastating of the three fires, on November 26, 1930, was ruled to have originated from faulty electrical wiring on the sixth floor of the center section. Some patients were tied to trees with fireman‚Äôs ropes to prevent escape after evacuation. The fourth floor north wards were destroyed as well as the central tower. Once rebuilt, the fourth floor in the north wards never matched the rest of the hospital in construction and style again. The state of New Jersey opened the Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital in 1931, and patients were transferred over the next few years down to the new hospital to help with overcrowding issues. However, Greystone officials were faced with a new problem: patients transferred to Marlboro had to pass a series of tests, and often the most able-bodied patients were removed from the campus, leaving older or more seriously ill patients behind. A change in the population began, and there was a shortage of patients capable of work or occupational therapy. Some of this need was filled by working men brought in by the state through the WPA program and other similar programs starting around 1935. = Modern era = late 20th century  The 1970s and 1980s saw a redirection in mental health towards deinstitutionalization. States around the country decided that mental health patients were better off living in the home with their families and being treated by the community than staying in removed surroundings in a hospital for a long-term stay. Two factors caused this sudden change. New psychological drugs were able to control patients much more effectively than previous methods ever could, and suddenly dangerous patients were capable of existing in the community in a less harmful state. Secondly, laws were passed in the 1970s forbidding patients to work unless paid fairly, which meant at least minimum wage. Suddenly hospital costs skyrocketed, as patients were no longer able to work in order to defray fees. Due to the landmark Doe vs. Klein case in 1974, Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital was forced to build community homes for patients to provide halfway house type living situations, and adequate staffing and patient care was required of the institution. Twenty \\"independent living\\" cottages opened in 1982 and by 1988 all patients had been moved out of living in the main Kirkbride building, and the wings were basically abandoned. Now only the center section was used for administrative purposes. Students of Drew University led an effort to try to get Greystone Park Psychiatric Center listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but were turned down. The Register claimed that the study submitted focused too much on the Kirkbride building, and that they wanted to see the entire hospital system submitted as a National Historic District. However, one student did manage to get the gas house placed on the Register. Greystone had dark years in the 1990s. Patient escapes became commonplace, including some that involved criminals and sex offenders. Staff were accused of abuse and rape, and some female residents became pregnant. Buildings were falling apart and lacking in basic creature comforts. Greystone was in danger of losing its accreditation from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. If this had happened, the hospital would have lost approximately $35 million annually from Medicaid and Medicare. A Senate task force was appointed to conduct a six-month probe on how to improve conditions, and the hospital was able to pass. The hospital is located on \\"Koch Avenue\\", named for Otto Adolf Koch. Otto Koch was a German immigrant who moved to New Jersey before WW1. He was the landscaper and won international acclaim for his florist work. In his honor, the avenue was named after him.  21st century  In 1997, the original tuberculosis pavilion was demolished, along with the morgue, a large garage, the print and tailor shops, and several employee dormitories and cottages. A new era for Greystone had begun, and the state was realizing it did not include many of its decaying antiquated buildings. The State of New Jersey released a report in 1999 stating the behemoth Kirkbride building was \\"not suitable for long-term future use.\\" The report went on to say that a new smaller building should be built and the hospital consolidated under this structure, and that while older structures should be razed, the main building should be saved due to historical significance. Governor Christine Todd Whitman ordered the now 550-bed facility closed within the next three years in 2000. Morris County purchased approximately of the Greystone Park Psychiatric Center property in 2001 for one dollar, with the stipulation that it would clean up asbestos and other environmental hazards on the site within its decaying buildings. When this land was sold, a law was also passed that Greystone land cannot be used for any purpose other than \\"recreation and conservation, historic preservation or farmland preservation.\\" This meant no commercial development and no condos or townhomes. The major effort to clean up the larger decaying buildings which still stood, and were viewed as eyesores, began in 2005 with the demolition of the dormitory. On September 8, 2005, the New Jersey Health Care Facilities Financing Authority closed a $186,565,000 bond issue on behalf of the State of New Jersey Department of Human Services for the completion of a new, Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital, still with a shortage of about 75 beds. Ground was ceremonially broken on November 16, 2005, for the new psychiatric hospital on the Greystone campus, located up the hill across the street from the Ellis complex. The new hospital is two-thirds the size of the Kirkbride building and can house about 450 patients, with another 100 patients living in hospital-run cottages on the grounds around the main building. The entire Curry Complex, including the Medical Clinic Building, the Curry Reception Building and the Employee Cafeteria came down in 2007 and 2008. The trio of buildings known as the Ellis Complex were cleared to make way for a parking lot. On July 16, 2008, after countless unexplained delays, patients were moved into the new hospital building. Administration and other departments followed suit. Today, almost all hospital services have relocated to the new complex. Morris County has installed skating rinks and a ball field on its 300-acre share, and plans to incorporate a dog park where the Curry Complex once stood, as well as an athletic complex for disabled athletes. The Central Avenue Complex is planned to become a mall for nonprofit charitable agencies. The building and the Kirkbride Plan Thomas Story Kirkbride (July 31, 1809 - December 16, 1883) was a physician, advocate for the mentally ill, and founder of the AMSAII, a precursor to the American Psychiatric Association. The original Second Empire Victorian style building was . At the base of this building was the alleged largest continuous foundation in the United States from the time it was built until it was surpassed by the Pentagon when it was constructed in 1943. However, many other Kirkbride asylum buildings (such as the Athens Lunatic Asylum in Ohio) also lay a claim to this fame and it has not been verified which one is true. The building has a characteristic linear arrangement, which was designed to the specifications of the Kirkbride Plan. The main building has a center section that was used for administrative purposes with three wings radiating out from the center, each about long. They were set back from the previous one so that patients could enjoy the beauty of the outside surroundings. This was a central concept, along with moral treatment, that was the hallmark of the Kirkbride Plan for treating the mentally ill. The building form itself was meant to promote treatment and have a curative effect. Each ward was initially set up to accommodate 20 patients. Each was furnished with a dining room, exercise room, and parlor. Most wards had wool rugs that ran the full length of the corridors. Other amenities included Victorian stuffed furniture, pianos, pictures, curtains and fresh flowers. Though not all wards were created equally. Wards that housed the most excitable patients were sparsely furnished ‚Äì presumably for their own safety ‚Äì with sturdy oak furniture. =Thomas Story Kirkbride's philosophy= During the time that Greystone was built, the predominant philosophy in psychology was that the mentally ill could be cured or treated, but only if they were in an environment designed to deal with them. A major proponent of this philosophy was Thomas Story Kirkbride, who participated in the design phase of the main building at Greystone, though the two main designers were architect Samuel Sloan and Trenton State Asylum Superintendent Horace Buttolph (a friend of Kirkbride's). The building was constructed and furnished according to Kirkbride's philosophy, which proposed housing no more than 250 patients in a three-story building. The rooms were to be light and airy with only two patients to a room. To reduce the likelihood of fires, Greystone and other Kirkbride asylums were constructed using stone, brick, slate and iron, using as little wood as possible. A street on the Greystone Park campus bears Buttolph's name. The Greystone campus itself was once a self-contained community that included staff housing, a post office, fire and police stations, a working farm, and vocational and recreational facilities. It also had its own gas and water utilities and a gneiss quarry, which was the source of the Greystone building material. Below the building, a series of tunnels and rails connect the many sections. =Fate of the historic buildings= The Curry Building as it appeared in 2006. The building was demolished in 2008 after an inspection deemed it irreparable. By the 2000s, many of the buildings were vacant and needed major repairs. Preservationists had been working for several years to guarantee the survival of this complex of buildings and Morris County had been negotiating with the State of New Jersey to take over vacant structures for non-profit agencies. Citizens of Morris County and surrounding areas formed the Preserve Greystone society to save the buildings. After the transition of the hospital's activity to its new location, the remaining property, including the historic Kirkbride building, was turned over to the state's treasurer in October 2007 as excess property with the intention that it would be sold. In the summer of 2008, the Curry building, as well as the surrounding vacant buildings, were demolished. In August 2013, state officials from the New Jersey Department of the Treasury announced plans to demolish the main Kirkbride building. In response to the community preservation group, Preserve Greystone, the Department worked with a consultant who found that redevelopment of the building would be too costly. The following year the state announced the awarding of a $34.4 million demolition bid to Northstar Contracting Group to take down the Kirkbride Building as well as other structures of the old hospital. Governor Chris Christie announced that the state was not considering a bid by Alma Realty to restore the property at no cost to the state. The plans for the demolition included the designation of an area on the property to memorialize the Kirkbride Building. State officials announced the demolition was scheduled to begin on April 6, 2015 and that work to clean up the site had already begun. Preserve Greystone filed an appeal to halt the demolition which the state court declined to hear. Despite considerable public opposition and open protestHundreds rally to save Greystone, an article of April 12, 2015 (retriieved April 27, 2019) and media attention, the main Kirkbride building was demolished in a process that began in April 2014 and was completed by October 2015.Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital remembered 1 year after demolition, an article of October 23, 2016 (retrieved April 22, 2019) However, some items of the stunning architectural details (manifesting unique Victorian motifs)Stunning Historic Cast Iron Staircases Rescued from Greystone Park Hospital, an article of August 19, 2016 (retrieved April 22, 2019) and other items with symbolic and historic valuesee the article New direction home of March 2018, detailing a visit made by Bob Dylan in October 2016 at the Woody Guthrie Center in Tulsa, during which he was showen \\"...the doors to Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital in New Jersey, which were salvaged and sent to the Center before the hospital was demolished in 2014.

The left and right pubic bones are each made up of three sections, a superior ramus, inferior ramus, and a body. Structure The pubic bone is made up of a body, superior ramus, and inferior ramus (). The left and right hip bones join at the pubic symphysis. It is covered by a layer of fat, which is covered by the mons pubis. The pubis is the lower limit of the suprapubic region. In the female, the pubic bone is anterior to the urethral sponge. =Body= The body forms the wide, strong, middle and flat part of the pubic bone. The bodies of the left and right pubic bones join together at the pubic symphysis. The rough upper edge is the pubic crest, ending laterally in the pubic tubercle. This tubercle, found roughly 3 cm from the pubic symphysis, is a distinctive feature on the lower part of the abdominal wall; important when localizing the superficial inguinal ring and the femoral canal of the inguinal canal. The inner surface of the body forms part of the wall of the lesser pelvis and joints to the origin of a part of the obturator internus muscle. =Superior pubic ramus= The superior pubic ramus is the upper of the two rami. It forms the upper edge of the obturator foramen. It extends from the body to the median plane where it joins with the ramus of the opposite side. It consists of an inner flattened part and a narrow outer prismoid portion. Medial surface Surfaces * The anterior surface is rough, directed downward and outward, and serves for the origin of various muscles. The Adductor longus arises from the upper and medial angle, immediately below the crest; lower down, the obturator externus, the adductor brevis, and the upper part of the gracilis take origin. * The posterior surface, convex from above downward, concave from side to side, is smooth, and forms part of the anterior wall of the pelvis. It gives origin to the levator ani and Obturator internus, and attachment to the puboprostatic ligaments and to a few muscular fibers prolonged from the bladder. Borders * The upper border presents a prominent tubercle, the pubic tubercle (pubic spine), which projects forward; the inferior crus of the subcutaneous inguinal ring (external abdominal ring), and the inguinal ligament (Poupart‚Äôs ligament) are attached to it. Passing upward and laterally from the pubic tubercle is a well-defined ridge, forming a part of the pectineal line which marks the brim of the lesser pelvis: to it are attached a portion of the inguinal falx (conjoined tendon of obliquus internus and transversus), the lacunar ligament (Gimbernat‚Äôs ligament), and the reflected inguinal ligament (triangular fascia). Medial to the pubic tubercle is the crest, which extends from this process to the medial end of the bone. It affords attachment to the inguinal falx, and to the rectus abdominis and pyramidalis. The point of junction of the crest with the medial border of the bone is called the angle; to it, as well as to the symphysis, the superior crus of the subcutaneous inguinal ring is attached. The medial border is articular; it is oval, and is marked by eight or nine transverse ridges, or a series of nipple-like processes arranged in rows, separated by grooves; they serve for the attachment of a thin layer of cartilage, which intervenes between it and the interpubic fibrocartilaginous lamina. The lateral border presents a sharp margin, the obturator crest, which forms part of the circumference of the obturator foramen and affords attachment to the obturator membrane. Lateral portion Surfaces * The superior surface presents a continuation of the pectineal line, already mentioned as commencing at the pubic tubercle. In front of this line, the surface of bone is triangular in form, wider laterally than medially, and is covered by the Pectineus. The surface is bounded, laterally, by a rough eminence, the iliopectineal eminence, which serves to indicate the point of junction of the ilium and pubis, and below by a prominent ridge which extends from the acetabular notch to the pubic tubercle. * The inferior surface forms the upper boundary of the obturator foramen, and presents, laterally, a broad and deep, oblique groove, for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve; and medially, a sharp margin, the obturator crest, forming part of the circumference of the obturator foramen, and giving attachment to the obturator membrane. * The posterior surface constitutes part of the anterior boundary of the lesser pelvis. It is smooth, convex from above downward, and affords origin to some fibers of the obturator internus. =Inferior pubic ramus= The inferior pubic ramus is a part of the pelvis and is thin and flat. It passes laterally and downward from the medial end of the superior ramus; it becomes narrower as it descends and joins with the inferior ramus of the ischium below the obturator foramen. Surfaces * Its anterior surface is rough, for the origin of muscles‚Äîthe Gracilis along its medial border, a portion of the Obturator externus where it enters into the formation of the obturator foramen, and between these two, the Adductores brevis and magnus, the former being the more medial. * The posterior surface is smooth, and gives origin to the Obturator internus, and, close to the medial margin, to the Constrictor urethrae. Borders * In the female pelvis, the medial border is thick, rough, and everted, and presents two ridges, separated by an intervening space. The ridges extend downwards, and are continuous with similar ridges on the inferior ramus of the ischium;  to the external ridge is attached the fascia of Colles  to the internal ridge is attached the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm * The lateral border is thin and sharp, forms part of the circumference of the obturator foramen, and gives attachment to the obturator membrane. Other animals=Mammals= Non-placental mammals possess osteological projections of the pubis known as epipubic bones. These evolved first among derived cynodonts, and evolved as a means of support for muscules flexing the thigh, facilitating the development of an erect gait.White, T.D. (August 9, 1989). \\"An analysis of epipubic bone function in mammals using scaling theory\\". Journal of Theoretical Biology 139 (3): 343‚Äì57. . . However, these prevent the expansion of the torso, preventing pregnancy and forcing the animal to give birth to larval young (the modern marsupial \\"joeys\\" and monotreme \\"puggles\\").Michael L. Power, Jay Schulkin. The Evolution Of The Human Placenta. pp. 68‚Äì. Placentals are unique among all mammals, including other eutherians, in having lost epipubic bones and having been able to develop proper pregnancy. In some groups, remnants of these pre-pubic bones can be found as os penises.Frederick S. Szalay (11 May 2006). Evolutionary History of the Marsupials and an Analysis of Osteological Characters. Cambridge University Press. pp. 293‚Äì. . =Dinosaurs= The clade Dinosauria is divided into the Saurischia and Ornithischia based on hip structure, including importantly that of the pubis.Seeley, H.G. (1888). \\"On the classification of the fossil animals commonly named Dinosauria.\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, 43: 165-171. An opisthopubic pelvis is a condition where the pubic bone extends back towards the tail of the animal, a trait that is also present in birds.Barsbold, R., (1979) Opisthopubic pelvis in the carnivorous dinosaurs. Nature. 279, 792-793 In a propubic pelvis, however, the pubic bone extends forward towards the head of the animal, as can be seen in the typical saurischian pelvic structure pictured below. The acetabulum, which can be thought of as a \\"hip-socket\\", is an opening on each side of the pelvic girdle formed where the ischium, ilium, and pubis all meet, and into which the head of the femur inserts. The orientation and position of the acetabulum is one of the main morphological traits that caused dinosaurs to walk in an upright posture with their legs directly underneath their bodies.Martin, A.J. (2006). Introduction to the Study of Dinosaurs. Second Edition. Oxford, Blackwell Publishing. pg. 299-300. . The prepubic process is a bony extension of the pubis that extends forward from the hip socket and toward the front of the animal. This adaptation is thought to have played a role in supporting the abdominal muscles.

Their implements for surface blasting consisted simply of a boat and iron rod, to feel the bottom with and to let down charges with an electric battery. Later, the firm obtained a contract to clear away Pot Rock and Sheldrake Reef, the contract ending on January 1, 1870. The result of their labor was not entirely satisfactory, as during the summer the rock was blown away only so as to give a depth from 12 to 20 feet, while the contract called for 25 feet. The Government then took charge of the work under Gen. Newton. Prof. Maillefert since then led a quiet life, not engaging in any business.

It serves the town of Branxton opening on 24 March 1862.Branxton Station NSWrail.net It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. A crossing loop previously ran behind Platform 2 but this has now been taken out of use. To the south-west of the station, is a branch to the Hunter Valley Railway Trust's North Rothbury museum. Platforms & services Branxton has two side platforms. It is serviced by NSW TrainLink Hunter Line services travelling between Newcastle, Muswellbrook and Scone.  Description  The up platform station building is a brick combination office/residence of type 1 design, originally dating from 1862 with alterations in the 1880s and again in 1915. The down platform station building is a brick island building dating of type 11 design from duplication in 1915. The platform faces were completed in brick with a dock platform. A timber, skillion roofed signal box with remaining telegraph wires and poles ( 1915), a timber store, a steel footbridge ( 1915), the concrete base of a JC Commenson T431 5 ton jib crane, and signs, seats, and fences including examples from different periods of railway development are all included within the heritage listing. A Pooley 5 ton weighing machine was recorded in the initial heritage listing, but was found to be not existent in 2004. The original double light colour light, metropolitan-style signals from 1946 were replaced with standard colour light signals.  Heritage listing  Branxton features some of the earliest buildings on the northern line. The substantial nature of the buildings reflects the importance once attached to the town and its station. The original station incorporated a rare example of a residence (1 of 5 similar structures in the State). The group exhibits the effects of duplication and the addition of structures from later periods including several additions to the 1862 building during the 1880s and again in 1914 to make a substantial main line railway group.

It is similar to the M1911 in design and operation. Colt manufactured both stainless steel and blued versions with eight-round magazines. A Delta Gold Cup model was also offered for target competition. The stainless steel Government Model version has recently been reintroduced. Released in 1987, it was the second commercial pistol chambered in the 10mm cartridge, following the Dornaus & Dixon manufactured Bren Ten pistol, which was released in 1983 and pioneered the 10mm Auto chambering. History The Delta Elite is credited as being the first firearm produced by a major manufacturer to chamber the 10mm. The ill-fated Bren Ten sparked a genuine interest in the 10mm round with outdoorsmen and as a defense round. The pistol was dropped from production in 1996 due to lackluster sales and the availability of smaller pistols with higher magazine capacities chambered in .40 S&W.; Colt announced the re-introduction of the Delta Elite at the 2008 SHOT Show. This new generation is generally similar to the previous version. The \\"new\\" Delta Elites will be manufactured with the traditional barrel/bushing arrangement. Colt Customer Service stated they had a lack of acceptable accuracy problem with the \\"bull\\" bushingless barrel setup. That was the cause of the delay in the Delta Elite's production schedule. The new Delta Elite pistol was released March 31, 2009. Design The Delta Elite is a standard M1911 design, with a few minor differences from the latest Series 80 derivative of that pistol. It carries the rowel \\"Commander\\" type hammer of that pistol and the same overall features of the 1911 that have made it so popular with users. However, the Delta Elite carries a stiffer double recoil spring to handle the increased recoil of the 10mm round. Unlike the .400 Corbon, the 10mm can easily exceed the pressure levels of the .357 Magnum, thus stressing the original design's limitations, unless care is given. Many gunsmiths have their own modifications which they feel adjust the level of felt recoil of the Delta Elite. Some of the very first Delta Elites had a tendency to suffer flex-induced slide rail stress cracks. This was quickly addressed by removing the section of the rail above the slide-stop cutout. Original design before improvement to allow flexing. Metal removed to allow the frame to flex. A Delta Elite on display at the National Firearms Museum. Police issue from Hartford, CT.

Her large-scale installations, sculptures, drawings, and prints utilize everyday objects to explore the transformative effects of accumulation and aggregation. Known for her commitment to process, she has earned acclaim for her ability to exploit the inherent physical characteristics of an object in order to transform it into works that generate unique perceptual phenomena and atmospheric effects. Her work has been conceptually linked to an art historical lineage that includes Postminimalism and Process artists such as Eva Hesse, Jackie Winsor, Richard Serra, and Robert Morris, along with Light and Space artists such as Mary Corse, Helen Pashgian, Robert Irwin, and James Turrell. Education  Donovan's formal art studies began at the School of Visual Arts (New York) in 1987‚Äì88. Donovan received her BFA at the Corcoran College of Art and Design (Washington DC) in 1991. After completing her undergraduate work, she maintained a studio in Baltimore and began participating in group exhibitions at galleries and non-profit art spaces.  Career = Early exhibitions = Her first major exhibition was ArtSites 96 at Maryland Art Place in Baltimore, where she first presented her toothpick cubes. She also participated in Options 1997 at Washington Project for the Arts, where she presented her first project utilizing torn pieces of tar paper, as well as group exhibitions at Baumgartner Galleries and Numark Gallery in Washington, DC. In 1998, Donovan held her first solo exhibition, Resonances, at Hemphill Fine Arts in Washington DC. In the same year, she exhibited New Sculpture at Reynolds Gallery in Richmond, Virginia. Donovan returned to her studies and earned her MFA at VCUarts, part of Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in 1999, when she also received her first interview in Articulate Contemporary Art Review. Upon graduating, she mounted her first major museum solo exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art's Hemicycle Gallery in Washington, DC in 1999, where she presented Whorl, an installation made out of approximately 8,000 pounds of nylon fiber that was bundled into units and then spread out on the floor in an expanding spiral pattern. Soon after, she relocated to New York and was invited to participate in the 2000 Biennial Exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, where she presented a floor installation (Ripple, 1998) made of cut electrical cable. =Exhibitions= Untitled by Tara Donovan Donovan's first major commercial gallery exhibitions were mounted at Ace Gallery in New York and Los Angeles. Her work was included in the 2000 Whitney Biennial. Earlier, from 1999 to 2000, Donovan exhibited Whorl at Hemicycle Gallery, Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. Upon receiving the call that she would be exhibiting this site-specific installation, Donovan is quoted as saying \\"I screamed and ran around in circles ... What do you think?\\" In a review of that exhibition, art critic Jessica Dawson observed that \\"Like Whorl, the artist's past works transformed outsize quantities of everyday materials‚Äîtoothpicks, roofing felt, rolls of adding machine paper‚Äîinto the unexpected: natural formations, seemingly living organisms, topographic maps.\\" Following Whorl, Donovan showed a series of exhibitions at Ace Gallery in Los Angeles, CA. In 2003, she occupied the entire Ace Gallery space at 274 Hudson Street in New York with a series of ‚Äòsite-responsive‚Äô installations, many of which have now come to define the artist's oeuvre. Examples include Haze (2003), which is composed entirely of translucent plastic drinking straws stacked against a wall and buttressed by the adjoining walls to create a monumental frieze with atmospheric effects. The floor installation Nebulous (2002) is made entirely of Scotch tape that has been unspooled and extemporaneously ‚Äòwoven‚Äô into interconnected units. Transplanted (2001) expanded upon her previous projects with torn pieces of tar paper in order to create a monumental slab of material occupying a footprint of over 25-feet square. Strata (2000) is another expansive floor installation made of pooled and layered pieces of dried Elmer's glue. Moir√© (1999) consists of large spools of adding machine paper that are manipulated and layered to form radiating patterns that shift with the position of the viewer. Colony (2000) is composed of cut pieces of standard pencils at various lengths, which are arranged on the floor to suggest the architectural sprawl of urban development. The exhibition received widespread critical acclaim, garnering reviews and profiles in The New York Times, Village Voice, Artforum, Art in America, Flash Art International, and W Magazine, among others. A series of solo museum projects followed at venues such as Rice University Art Gallery in Houston, Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, UCLA's Hammer Museum, Berkeley Art Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland, and the Saint Louis Art Museum, among others. Donovan says of her work, \\"It is not like I'm trying to simulate nature. It's more of a mimicking of the way of nature, the way things actually grow.\\" Fellow artist Chuck Close told a reporter that \\"\\"At this particular moment in the art world, invention and personal vision have been demoted in favor of appropriation, of raiding the cultural icebox. For somebody to go out and try to make something that doesn't remind you of anybody else's work and is really, truly innovative‚Äîand I think Tara's work is‚Äîthat's very much against the grain of the moment. To me, it represents a gutsy move.\\" =Pace Gallery= In 2005, Donovan joined Pace Gallery where her work was included in both a summer group show and the group exhibition Logical Conclusions: 40 Years of Rule-Based Art curated by Marc Glimcher. Her first major solo exhibition at Pace in 2006, Tara Donovan: New Work, presented Untitled (Plastic Cups), an installation of stacks of plastic cups assembled at a scale that suggested a rolling topographical landscape. Later that same year, she presented Tara Donovan: Rubber Band Drawings. She has since proceeded to debut most of her new projects in solo and group exhibitions at Pace and its global affiliate galleries in London, Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul, Menlo Park and Palo Alto, which include the following (among others): * Light, Time and Three Dimensions, Pace Gallery, New York, June 28August 24, 2007 * Tara Donovan: New Drawings, Pace Gallery, New York, April 10May 2, 2009 * On the Square, Pace Gallery', New York, January 8February 13, 2010 * 50 Years at Pace, Pace Gallery, New York, September 17‚ÄìOctober 16, 2010 * Tara Donovan: Drawings (Pins), Feb 12, 2011Mar 19, 2011 included more than twelve drawings composed of thousands of nickel-headed steel pins pierced into white gatorboard. * Untitled (Mylar), May 4April 9, 2011 * Beijing Voice 2011: Leaving Realism Behind, November 9, 2011February 12, 2012 * Grounded, January 17February 22, 2014 * Tara Donovan, Pace Gallery, New York, May 22August 23, 2014 * Tara Donovan, Pace Gallery, New York, May 9July 8, 2015 * Talking on Paper, Pace in Beijing, April 17June 18, 2016 * Tara Donovan, Pace in Palo Alto, January 26March 26, 2017 * Chewing Gum II, Pace in Hong Kong, February 10March 11, 2017 * Tara Donovan, Pace Gallery, New York, February 17March 18, 2017 * Tara Donovan, Pace in Seoul, September 6October 22, 2017 * Tara Donovan: Compositions, Pace in London, January 24March 9, 2018 In addition to Pace, Donovan's work has been included in solo and group exhibitions at other galleries including Krakow Witkin Gallery in Boston, Reynolds Gallery in Richmond, Galerie Perrotin in Paris, Stephen Friedman Gallery in London, and Quint Gallery in La Jolla, among others. =Museum exhibitions= Donovan has produced many large-scale exhibitions at museums. One of the most notable is her 2007 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Titled Tara Donovan at the Met, the project was the fourth in a series of projects with contemporary artists commissioned by the museum. She produced a site- responsive installation using loops of Mylar tape affixed in clusters to all of the walls of a gallery, which surrounded the viewers in a shifting, phenomenological experience as they moved through the space. Donovan also had work as part of the Material Matters exhibition hosted by the Cornell University Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art in 2005. This show featured the work of 20 artists who highlighted material and process but also drew from vocabulary of conceptual and minimalist art of the '60's and '70's. The featured work was a cube made with thousands of pins held together by friction and gravity. Donovan's first major survey exhibition was produced by the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, where it opened in 2008. The exhibition traveled to the Cincinnati Art Center, the Des Moines Art Center and the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego throughout the rest of 2008 and 2009. In addition to new iterations of Haze, Nebulous, Strata, Moir√©, Untitled (Plastic Cups), Untitled (Mylar Tape), and Untitled (Styrofoam Cups), the exhibition included examples of Bluffs (sculptures made of stacks of clear plastic buttons), Untitled (Paper Plates) (another series of sculptures that use the ridged edges of standard paper plates to form orbs that fuse together into crystalline-like clusters), and three of her cubes made of different materials: Untitled (Toothpicks), Untitled (Pins), and Untitled (Glass). Donovan also introduced museum audiences to newer projects such as Untitled (Mylar), which consists of folded sheets of Mylar condensed into spherical units, and Untitled, a wall-based installation that uses sheets of folded and compressed polyester film to construct a thick screen of material that plays with light, optics and perspective (a subsequent iteration of this project was commissioned for the Lever House Art Collection). In 2010, Donovan worked with the Indianapolis Museum of Art to produce Tara Donovan: Untitled, an exhibition of many of her previous sculptural installation projects (including Ripple, Colony, Strata, Transplanted, and Untitled (Plastic Cups)) along with examples of many of her drawings and monoprints produced since 2000. In addition, the museum commissioned a large-scale version of Untitled (Mylar), which is now part of the collection. In 2012, Donovan was invited by the Milwaukee Art Museum to participate in its series of contemporary artists‚Äô projects. Currents 35: Tara Donovan featured new iterations of Haze and Untitled (Lever House Project) as well as examples from her new series of Drawings (Pins) (2011) and a new sculptural installation of clear acrylic rods assembled into spiky crystalline units that can be combined in different orientations to create a sprawling floor installation. Donovan's first European museum exhibition was organized in 2013 by the Arp Museum in Remagen, Germany in collaboration with the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Humlebaek, Denmark. The exhibition presented a sampling of her installations and sculptural projects produced over the previous fifteen years. In 2015, Donovan was invited by curator Andrea Grover to participate in the Parrish Museum's Platform initiative, which is a series of contemporary artists‚Äô projects that respond to the architecture, context, and environmental conditions of the museum. Donovan presented new works related to her experiments with Slinkys (the children's toy) as both a sculptural and mark-making material. The artist was also invited to participate in her first UK-based exhibition at Jupiter Artland in Scotland where she presented a wall installation of Slinkys along with iterations of Untitled (Plastic Cups) and Untitled (Mylar). An installation of Donovan's monumental stacks of styrene cards (which previously debuted at Pace Gallery in 2014) was included in the Wonder exhibition at the Smithsonian Museum of American Art's Renwick Gallery, which opened in November 2015. The 2018 exhibition Hyperobjects at Ballroom Marfa‚Äîcurated in collaboration with Timothy Morton‚Äîconsidered Donovan's work within a broad conceptual framework of geological time and the imprint of human activity and its material residue on the present and future. Donovan's 2018 exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver occupied the entire David Adjaye- designed building. Curator Nora Abrams combined Donovan's older and more recent two-dimensional and three-dimensional works in order to ‚Äúopen up new areas of dialogue within her practice and enable viewers to make connections across time and subject matter.‚Äù Including sculpture, drawings, works on paper, and site-responsive installations, the exhibition called attention to how Donovan's material experimentations result in a varied practice.

In January 1945 two of his battalions were encircled by the 1st Ukrainian Front in Breslau where they were destroyed. In the Battle of the Seelow Heights the 9th Division was positioned between Seelow and Neuhardenberg, they received the full force of the first days artillery bombardment by Marshal Georgi Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front on 16 April. Under this bombardment the 9th Division buckled. It rallied briefly on the morning of 17 April, when it was given some armoured support, but collapsed again shortly afterwards. Br√§uer suffered a nervous breakdown and was relieved of his command at the request of Goering, angry at the collapse of one of his Luftwaffe divisions.Beevor pp. 223 236‚Äì237, 243, 246‚Äì247 Br√§uer was followed in command by Colonel Herrmann.Le Tissier, p. 228 The SS Nordland Division rounded up some elements of the 9th Division and managed a temporarily successful counterattack. By 19 April, the remnants of the 9th Division along with what remained of the rest of the LVI Panzer Corps were within the Berlin U-Bahn outer defensive ring.Beevor p. 286 During the attempted breakout on the night of 1/2 May a small group of the 9th Division stormed the tower of Spandau Rathaus (Town Hall) from which Soviet machine-gunners were decimating Germans attempting to break out of Berlin over the Havel using the Charlottenbr√ºcke ('Charlotten Bridge').Beevor p. 385 By the end of 2 May the 9th Parachute Division had ceased to exist.

He competed in the AMA Motocross Championships from 1988 to 2006. During his nineteen-year professional motocross career, LaRocco won two AMA Motocross Championships and one FIM World Supercross title. He was inducted to the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2014. Motorcycle racing career Born in Michigan City, Indiana, LaRocco competed professionally from 1988 to 2006. LaRocco began his motocross racing career riding a Yamaha then, signed a contract to race for the Suzuki factory racing team and placed third in the 1990 AMA 250cc national championship. In 1992, he switched to the Kawasaki team and won the 1993 500cc Motocross national championship, becoming the final AMA 500cc champion when the AMA discontinued the class after the 1993 season. LaRocco also won the 1994 250cc Motocross national championship, the 2000 World Supercross title and the 2002 U.S. Open Supercross Championship. In 2002 another rider caused LaRocco to crash at a small town Supercross event. The accident caused LaRocco to dislocate his wrist and tear ligaments in his leg. The injury caused him to discontinue the Supercross season, the first time in seven years he had not participated. He retired in 2006 with 53 podium appearances in the 450cc class and 16 in the 125cc class. At the time of his retirement, he had finished in the top five 145 times. LaRocco was inducted to the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2014. LaRocco's Leap In 1991, a 120 ft triple jump was constructed at Red Bud motocross track in Buchanan, Michigan. It was modeled after \\"Kong\\", a large jump found at LaRocco's personal track. Track co-owner Tim Ritchie decided to build a replica of the jump at the Red Bud track. It was later named after LaRocco as he became the first person to clear it, doing so on a 125cc motorcycle.

It was the first of eight forts built during the elder V√©rendrye's expansion of trade and exploration westward from the Great Lakes. History In 1688 Jacques de Noyon, the first European to reach the area, built a temporary post or camp possibly at the same location.Morton, page 98 For its position on the fur trade route see Winnipeg River#Exploration and fur trade. The elder V√©rendrye reached Grand Portage in late August 1731. Here most of the men refused to continue because of the late season, difficult portage and largely unknown country. V√©rendrye wintered with most of the men at Fort Kaministiquia, but was able to send a few willing men westward under Christopher Dufrost de La Jemeraye. La Jemeraye reached Rainy Lake before the freezeup and built a fort at its outlet. Next May he sent a small load of furs back eastward, V√©rendrye arrived in July, and pushed west to Lake of the Woods where he built Fort Saint Charles which quickly overshadowed Fort St. Pierre. Coureurs des bois spread out and drew trade away from the English, but we only know of them from rumors picked up by the English on Hudson Bay.Morton, page 178 The area produced fish and wild rice. The local people were Monsonis, with Cree further west. Both were at war with the Sioux to the south. The post remained in operation until 1758. Fort Lac la Pluie was built nearby by the North West Company sometime between 1775 and 1787. There was a modern reconstruction of the fort, but it was demolished in 2003 due to the deteriorated condition of the building. The site was on the north bank of the Rainy River just past a series of rapids near its outflow from the lake at the modern town of Fort Frances. La Colle, a Monsoni chief who assisted La V√©rendrye a great deal, made his main camp in the vicinity of the fort. He and his warriors helped control the Sioux of the Prairies in the period when La V√©rendrye was leading expeditions and fort building westward.

This constitution was amended in 1786, and again in 1793 following Vermont's admission to the federal union in 1791. The Old Constitution House in Windsor, Vermont, where the constitution of the Vermont Republic was signed. The first Constitution of Vermont was drafted in July 1777, almost five months after Vermont declared itself an independent country, now frequently called the Vermont Republic. It was in effect until its extensive revision in 1786. The second Constitution of Vermont went into effect in 1786 and lasted until 1793, two years after Vermont was admitted to the Union as the fourteenth state. In 1791 Vermont became the fourteenth US state and in 1793 it adopted its current constitution.  1777 Constitution  The 1777 constitution was the first in what is now the territory of the United States to prohibit adult slavery, grant suffrage to non-landowning males, and establish free public education. The constitution was adopted on July 8, 1777, at the tavern in Windsor now known as the Old Constitution House and administered as a state historic site. The constitution consisted of three main parts. The first was a preamble reminiscent of the United States Declaration of Independence: :It is absolutely necessary, for the welfare and safety of the inhabitants of this State, that it should be, henceforth, a free and independent State; and that a just, permanent, and proper form of government, should exist in it, derived from, and founded on, the authority of the people only, agreeable to the direction of the honorable American Congress. (Here the term \\"American Congress\\" refers to the Continental Congress.) Jonas Fay was a delegate to the convention; he was named chairman of the committee appointed to draft the declaration announcing the creation of the Vermont Republic, and received credit as the document's primary author. = Chapter 1 = The second part of the 1777 constitution was Chapter 1, a \\"Declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of the State of Vermont.\\" This chapter was composed of 19 articles guaranteeing various civil and political rights in Vermont: * The first article declared that \\"all men are born equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent and unalienable rights, amongst which are the enjoying and defending life and liberty; acquiring, possessing and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety,\\" echoing the famous phrases in the Declaration of Independence that declared that \\"all men are created equal\\" and possess \\"inalienable rights,\\" including \\"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\\" The article went on to declare that because of these principles, \\"no male person, born in this country, or brought from over sea, ought to be holden by law, to serve any person, as a servant, slave or apprentice, after he arrives to the age of twenty-one Years, nor female, in like manner, after she arrives to the age of eighteen years, unless they are bound by their own consent.\\" While this was the first such partial ban on slavery in the New World, it was not strongly enforced and slavery in the state persisted for at least another sixty years. See also History of slavery in Vermont. * The second article declared that \\"private property ought to be subservient to public uses, when necessity requires it; nevertheless, whenever any particular man's property is taken for the use of the public, the owner ought to receive an equivalent in money.\\" This established the basic principles of eminent domain in Vermont. * The third article established freedom of religion. * The fourth through seventh articles subordinated the government to the interests of the people. * The eighth article gave all freemen the right to vote (even if they owned no property). * The ninth article said that since everyone has a right to be protected in his life, liberty, and property, that he ought to contribute his share to the expense of that protection. * The tenth through thirteenth articles concerned due process of law. * The fourteenth and fifteenth articles concerned freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to bear arms, and the subordination of the military to the civil power. * The seventeenth article recognizes a right to emigrate. * The eighteenth article recognizes rights of assembly and petition. * The nineteenth article says no one should be liable to be transported from Vermont to any other place to be tried for offenses committed in Vermont. = Chapter 2 = Chapter 2 of the Constitution is called A Plan or Frame of Government. * Sections I through IV of Chapter 2 provide that \\"THE COMMONWEALTH or STATE of VERMONT, shall be governed, hereafter, by a Governor, Deputy Governor, Council, and an Assembly of the Representatives of the Freemen of the same\\". It vests executive power in the governor and council, and legislative power in the House of Representatives, and requires a court of justice to be established in every county. * Section V prescribes universal military training. * Section VI says every man at least 21 years old (even those not owning property) may vote if they take an oath promising to vote consistently with the interests of the state of Vermont. (The Vermont voter's oath is still required today for first-time voters when they register. None of the other states require an oath of voters.) * Sections VII through IX and XI through XVI provide for annual election of legislators and annual legislative sessions. * Section X says the legislature is to elect delegates to the Continental Congress. (However, the Continental Congress refused to recognize the independence of Vermont and to allow it representation.) * Sections XVII and XVIII deal with the powers of the governor and council, in particular making the governor the commander-in-chief of the military. * Sections XXI through XXVI deal with courts of law, in particular the supreme court and the courts of common pleas. Chapter 2 continues through 44 Sections.  1786 Constitution  The 1786 Constitution of Vermont established a greater separation of powers than what had prevailed under the 1777 Constitution. In particular, it forbade anyone to simultaneously hold more than one of certain offices: governor, lieutenant-governor, judge of the supreme court, treasurer of the state, member of the governor's council, member of the legislature, surveyor-general, or sheriff.Vermont state archives, 1786 Constitution, Chapter II, Section XXIII, https://www.sec.state.vt.us/archives-records/state- archives/government-history/vermont- constitutions/1786-constitution.aspx#ChapterII It also provided that the legislature could no longer function as a court of appeals nor otherwise intervene in cases before the courts, as it had often done. The 1786 Constitution continued in effect when, in 1791, Vermont made the transition from independence to the status of one of the states of the Union. In particular, the governor, the members of the governor's council, and other officers of the state, including judges in all courts, simply continued their terms of office that were already underway.  1793 Constitution  The 1793 Constitution was adopted two years after Vermont's admission to the Union and continues in effect, with various later amendments, to this day. It eliminated all mention of grievances against King George III and against the State of New York. In 1790, New York's legislature finally renounced its claims that Vermont was a part of New York, the cessation of those claims being effective if and when Congress decided to admit Vermont.

XTR stands for 'ECSTR', which is an abbreviation for Efficient and Compact Subgroup Trace Representation. It is a method to represent elements of a subgroup of a multiplicative group of a finite field. To do so, it uses the trace over GF(p^2) to represent elements of a subgroup of GF(p^6)^*. From a security point of view, XTR relies on the difficulty of solving Discrete Logarithm related problems in the full multiplicative group of a finite field. Unlike many cryptographic protocols that are based on the generator of the full multiplicative group of a finite field, XTR uses the generator g of a relatively small subgroup of some prime order q of a subgroup of GF(p^6)^*. With the right choice of q, computing Discrete Logarithms in the group, generated by g, is, in general, as hard as it is in GF(p^6)^* and thus cryptographic applications of XTR use GF(p^2) arithmetics while achieving full GF(p^6) security leading to substantial savings both in communication and computational overhead without compromising security. Some other advantages of XTR are its fast key generation, small key sizes and speed.  Fundamentals of XTR  XTR uses a subgroup, commonly referred to as XTR subgroup or just XTR group, of a subgroup called XTR supergroup, of the multiplicative group of a finite field GF(p^6) with p^6 elements. The XTR supergroup is of order p^2-p+1, where p is a prime such that a sufficiently large prime q divides p^2-p+1. The XTR subgroup has now order q and is, as a subgroup of GF(p^6)^*, a cyclic group \\\\langle g\\\\rangle with generator g. The following three paragraphs will describe how elements of the XTR supergroup can be represented using an element of GF(p^2) instead of an element of GF(p^6) and how arithmetic operations take place in GF(p^2) instead of in GF(p^6). =Arithmetic operations in GF(p^2) = Let p be a prime such that p ‚â° 2 mod 3 and p2 \\\\- p + 1 has a sufficiently large prime factor q. Since p2 ‚â° 1 mod 3 we see that p generates (\\\\mathbb{Z}/3\\\\mathbb{Z})^* and thus the third cyclotomic polynomial \\\\Phi_3(x)=x^2+x+1 is irreducible over GF(p). It follows that the roots \\\\alpha and \\\\alpha^p form an optimal normal basis for GF(p^2) over GF(p) and :GF(p^2) \\\\cong \\\\\\\\{x_1 \\\\alpha + x_2 \\\\alpha^p : x_1, x_2 \\\\in GF(p)\\\\\\\\}. Considering that p ‚â° 2 mod 3 we can reduce the exponents modulo 3 to get :GF(p^2) \\\\cong \\\\\\\\{y_1 \\\\alpha + y_2 \\\\alpha^2 : \\\\alpha^2+\\\\alpha+1=0, y_1, y_2 \\\\in GF(p)\\\\\\\\}. The cost of arithmetic operations is now given in the following Lemma labeled Lemma 2.21 in \\"An overview of the XTR public key system\\": Lemma * Computing xp is done without using multiplication * Computing x2 takes two multiplications in GF(p) * Computing xy takes three multiplications in GF(p) * Computing xz-yzp takes four multiplications in GF(p). = Traces over GF(p^2) = The trace in XTR is always considered over GF(p^2). In other words, the conjugates of h \\\\in GF(p^6) over GF(p^2) are h, h^{p^2} and h^{p^4} and the trace of h is their sum: :Tr(h)=h + h^{p^2} + h^{p^4}. Note that Tr(h) \\\\in GF(p^2) since : \\\\begin{align} Tr(h)^{p^2} &= h^{p^2} + h^{p^4} + h^{p^6} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= h + h^{p^2} + h^{p^4} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= Tr(h) \\\\end{align} Consider now the generator g of the XTR subgroup of a prime order q. Remember that \\\\langle g\\\\rangle is a subgroup of the XTR supergroup of order p^2-p+1, so q \\\\mid p^2-p+1. In the following section we will see how to choose p and q, but for now it is sufficient to assume that q>3. To compute the trace of g note that modulo p^2-p+1 we have :p^2 = p-1 and :p^4 = (p-1)^2 = p^2 -2p +1 = -p and thus : \\\\begin{align} Tr(g) &= g + g^{p^2} + g^{p^4}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= g + g^{p-1} + g^{-p}. \\\\end{align} The product of the conjugates of g equals 1, i.e., that g has norm 1. The crucial observation in XTR is that the minimal polynomial of g over GF(p^2) :(x-g)\\\\\\\\!\\\\ (x-g^{p-1})(x-g^{-p}) simplifies to :x^3-Tr(g)\\\\\\\\!\\\\ x^2 + Tr(g)^p x -1 which is fully determined by Tr(g). Consequently, conjugates of g, as roots of the minimal polynomial of g over GF(p^2), are completely determined by the trace of g. The same is true for any power of g: conjugates of g^n are roots of polynomial :x^3-Tr(g^n)\\\\\\\\!\\\\ x^2 + Tr(g^n)^p x -1 and this polynomial is completely determined by Tr(g^n). The idea behind using traces is to replace g^n \\\\in GF(p^6) in cryptographic protocols, e.g. the Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange by Tr(g^n) \\\\in GF(p^2) and thus obtaining a factor of 3 reduction in representation size. This is, however, only useful if there is a quick way to obtain Tr(g^n) given Tr(g). The next paragraph gives an algorithm for the efficient computation of Tr(g^n). In addition, computing Tr(g^n) given Tr(g) turns out to be quicker than computing g^n given g. = Algorithm for the quick computation of Tr(g^n) given Tr(g) = A. Lenstra and E. Verheul give this algorithm in their paper titled The XTR public key system in. All the definitions and lemmas necessary for the algorithm and the algorithm itself presented here, are taken from that paper. Definition For c in GF(p^2) define :F(c,X) = X^3 - cX^2 + c^pX - 1 \\\\in GF(p^2)[X]. Definition Let h_0,\\\\\\\\!\\\\ h_1, h_2 denote the, not necessarily distinct, roots of F(c,X) in GF(p^6) and let n be in \\\\mathbb{Z}. Define :c_n=h_0^n + h_1^n + h_2^n. Properties of c_n and F(c,X) # c=c_1 # c_{-n}=c_{np}=c_n^p # c_n \\\\in GF(p^2) \\\\text{ for } n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} # c_{u+v}=c_u c_v - c_v^p c_{u-v} + c_{u-2v} \\\\text{ for } u, v \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} # Either all h_j have order dividing p^2-p+1 and > 3 or all h_j are in GF(p^2). In particular, F(c,X) is irreducible if and only if its roots have order diving p^2-p+1 and > 3. # F(c,X) is reducible over GF(p^2) if and only if c_{p+1} \\\\in GF(p) Lemma Let c,\\\\\\\\!\\\\ c_{n-1}, c_n, c_{n+1} be given. # Computing c_{2n} = c_n^2 - 2c_n^p takes two multiplication in GF(p). # Computing c_{n+2} = c_{n+1} \\\\cdot c - c^p \\\\cdot c_n + c_{n-1} takes four multiplication in GF(p). # Computing c_{2n-1} = c_{n-1} \\\\cdot c_n - c^p \\\\cdot c_n^p + c_{n+1}^p takes four multiplication in GF(p). # Computing c_{2n+1} = c_{n+1} \\\\cdot c_n - c \\\\cdot c_n^p + c_{n-1}^p takes four multiplication in GF(p). Definition Let S_n(c)=(c_{n-1}, c_n, c_{n+1}) \\\\in GF(p^2)^3. Algorithm 1 for computation of S_n(c) given n and c * If n<0 apply this algorithm to -n and c, and apply Property 2 to the resulting value. * If n=0, then S_0(c)\\\\\\\\!\\\\ =(c^p, 3, c) . * If n=1, then S_1(c)\\\\\\\\!\\\\ =(3, c, c^2-2c^p) . * If n=2, use the computation of c_{n+2}= c_{n+1} \\\\cdot c - c^p \\\\cdot c_n + c_{n-1} and S_1(c) to find c_3 and thereby S_2(c). * If n>2, to compute S_n(c) define :::\\\\bar{S}_i(c) = S_{2i+1}(c) ::and \\\\bar{m}=n if n is odd and \\\\bar{m}=n-1 otherwise. Let \\\\bar{m}=2m+1, k=1 and compute \\\\bar{S}_k(c) = S_3(c) using the Lemma above and S_2(c). Let further :::m=\\\\sum_{j=0}^r m_j 2^j ::with m_j \\\\in {0,1} and m_r=1. For j=r-1, r-2, ..., 0 in succession, do the following: ::* If m_j=0, use \\\\bar{S}_k(c) to compute \\\\bar{S}_{2k}(c). ::* If m_j=1, use \\\\bar{S}_k(c) to compute \\\\bar{S}_{2k+1}(c). ::* Replace k by 2k + m_j. When these iterations finish, k=m and S_{\\\\bar{m}}(c) = \\\\bar{S}_{m}(c). If n is even use S_{\\\\bar{m}}(c) to compute \\\\bar{S}_{m+1}(c).  Parameter selection =Finite field and subgroup size selection= In order to take advantage of the above described representations of elements with their traces and furthermore ensure sufficient security, that will be discussed below, we need to find primes p and q, where p denotes the characteristic of the field GF(p^6) with p\\\\equiv 2\\\\ \\\\text{mod}\\\\ 3 and q is the size of the subgroup, such that q divides p^2-p+1. We denote with P and Q the sizes of p and q in bits. To achieve security comparable to 1024-bit RSA, we should choose 6P about 1024, i.e. P\\\\approx 170 and Q can be around 160. A first easy algorithm to compute such primes p and q is the next Algorithm A: Algorithm A # Find r\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z} such that q=r^2-r+1 is a Q-bit prime. # Find k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z} such that p=r+k\\\\cdot q is a P-bit prime with p\\\\equiv 2\\\\ \\\\text{mod}\\\\ 3. :Correctness of Algorithm A: :It remains to check that q\\\\mid p^2-p+1 because all the other necessary properties are obviously satisfied per definition of p and q. We easily see that p^2-p+1=r^2+2rkq+k^2q^2-r-kq+1=r^2-r+1+q(2rk+k^2q-k)=q(1+2rk+k^2q-k) which implies that q\\\\mid p^2-p+1. Algorithm A is very fast and can be used to find primes p that satisfy a degree-two polynomial with small coefficients. Such p lead to fast arithmetic operations in GF(p). In particular if the search for k is restricted to k=1, which means looking for an r such that both r^2-r+1\\\\text{ and }r^2+1 are prime and such that r^2+1\\\\equiv 2 \\\\text{ mod } 3, the primes p have this nice form. Note that in this case r must be even and r\\\\equiv 1\\\\text{ mod }4. On the other hand, such p may be undesirable from a security point of view because they may make an attack with the Discrete Logarithm variant of the Number Field Sieve easier. The following Algorithm B doesn't have this disadvantage, but it also doesn't have the fast arithmetic modulo p Algorithm A has in that case. Algorithm B # Select a Q-bit prime q so that q\\\\equiv7\\\\ \\\\text{mod}\\\\ 12. # Find the roots r_1 and r_2 of X^2-X+1\\\\ \\\\text{mod}\\\\ q. # Find a k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z} such that p=r_i+k\\\\cdot q is a P-bit prime with p\\\\equiv 2\\\\ \\\\text{mod}\\\\ 3 for i\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\} :Correctness of Algorithm B: :Since we chose q\\\\equiv7\\\\ \\\\text{mod}\\\\ 12 it follows immediately that q\\\\equiv1\\\\ \\\\text{mod}\\\\ 3 (because 7\\\\equiv1\\\\ \\\\text{mod}\\\\ 3 and 3\\\\mid 12). From that and quadratic reciprocity we can deduce that r_1 and r_2 exist. :To check that q\\\\mid p^2-p+1 we consider again p^2-p+1 for r_i\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\} and get that p^2-p+1=r_i^2+2r_ikq+k^2q^2-r_i- kq+1=r_i^2-r_i+1+q(2rk+k^2q-k)=q(2rk+k^2q-k), since r_1 and r_2 are roots of X^2-X+1 and hence q\\\\mid p^2-p+1. =Subgroup selection= In the last paragraph we have chosen the sizes p and q of the finite field GF(p^6) and the multiplicative subgroup of GF(p^6)^*, now we have to find a subgroup \\\\langle g\\\\rangle of GF\\\\\\\\!\\\\ (p^6)^* for some g\\\\in GF(p^6) such that \\\\mid\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle g\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\mid=q. However, we do not need to find an explicit g\\\\in GF(p^6), it suffices to find an element c\\\\in GF(p^2) such that c=Tr(g) for an element g\\\\in GF(p^6) of order q. But, given Tr(g), a generator g of the XTR (sub)group can be found by determining any root of F(Tr(g),\\\\ X) which has been defined above. To find such a c we can take a look at property 5 of F(c,\\\\ X) here stating that the roots of F(c,\\\\ X) have an order dividing p^2-p+1 if and only if F(c,\\\\ X) is irreducible. After finding such c we need to check if it really is of order q, but first we focus on how to select c\\\\in GF(p^2) such that F(c,\\\\ X) is irreducible. An initial approach is to select c\\\\in GF(p^2)\\\\backslash GF(p) randomly which is justified by the next lemma. Lemma: For a randomly selected c\\\\in GF(p^2) the probability that F(c,\\\\ X)=X^3-cX^2+c^pX-1\\\\in GF(p^2)[X] is irreducible is about one third. Now the basic algorithm to find a suitable Tr(g) is as follows: Outline of the algorithm # Pick a random c\\\\in GF(p^2)\\\\backslash GF(p). # If F(c,\\\\ X) is reducible, then return to Step 1. # Use Algorithm 1 to compute d=c_{(p^2-p+1)/q}. # If d is not of order q, return to Step 1. # Let Tr(g)=d. It turns out that this algorithm indeed computes an element of GF(p^2) that equals Tr(g) for some g\\\\in GF(p^6) of order q. More details to the algorithm, its correctness, runtime and the proof of the Lemma can be found in \\"An overview of the XTR public key system\\" in.  Cryptographic schemes  In this section it is explained how the concepts above using traces of elements can be applied to cryptography. In general, XTR can be used in any cryptosystem that relies on the (subgroup) Discrete Logarithm problem. Two important applications of XTR are the Diffie‚ÄìHellman key agreement and the ElGamal encryption. We will start first with Diffie‚ÄìHellman. = XTR-DH key agreement = We suppose that both Alice and Bob have access to the XTR public key data \\\\left(p,q,Tr(g)\\\\right) and intend to agree on a shared secret key K. They can do this by using the following XTR version of the Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange: # Alice picks a\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z} randomly with 1, computes with Algorithm 1 S_a(Tr(g))=\\\\left(Tr(g^{a-1}),Tr(g^a),Tr(g^{a+1})\\\\right)\\\\in GF(p^2)^3 and sends Tr(g^a)\\\\in GF(p^2) to Bob. # Bob receives Tr(g^a) from Alice, selects at random b\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z} with 1, applies Algorithm 1 to compute S_b(Tr(g))=\\\\left(Tr(g^{b-1}),Tr(g^b),Tr(g^{b+1})\\\\right)\\\\in GF(p^2)^3 and sends Tr(g^b)\\\\in GF(p^2) to Alice. # Alice receives Tr(g^b) from Bob, computes with Algorithm 1 S_a(Tr(g^b))=\\\\left(Tr(g^{(a-1)b}),Tr(g^{ab}),Tr(g^{(a+1)b})\\\\right)\\\\in GF(p^2)^3 and determines K based on Tr(g^{ab})\\\\in GF(p^2). # Bob analogously applies Algorithm 1 to compute S_b(Tr(g^a))=\\\\left(Tr(g^{a(b-1)}),Tr(g^{ab}),Tr(g^{a(b+1)})\\\\right)\\\\in GF(p^2)^3 and also determines K based on Tr(g^{ab})\\\\in GF(p^2). = XTR ElGamal encryption = For the ElGamal encryption we suppose now that Alice is the owner of the XTR public key data (p,q,Tr(g)) and that she has selected a secret integer k, computed Tr(g^k) and published the result. Given Alice's XTR public key data \\\\left(p,q,Tr(g),Tr(g^k)\\\\right), Bob can encrypt a message M, intended for Alice, using the following XTR version of the ElGamal encryption: # Bob selects randomly a b\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z} with 1 and computes with Algorithm 1 S_b(Tr(g))=\\\\left(Tr(g^{b-1}),Tr(g^b),Tr(g^{b+1})\\\\right)\\\\in GF(p^2)^3. # Bob next applies Algorithm 1 to compute S_b(Tr(g^k))=\\\\left(Tr(g^{(b-1)k}),Tr(g^{bk}),Tr(g^{(b+1)k})\\\\right)\\\\in GF(p^2)^3. # Bob determines a symmetric encryption key K based on Tr(g^{bk})\\\\in GF(p^2). # Bob uses an agreed upon symmetric encryption method with key K to encrypt his message M, resulting in the encryption E. # Bob sends (Tr(g^b),\\\\ E) to Alice. Upon receipt of (Tr(g^b),\\\\ E), Alice decrypts the message in the following way: # Alice computes S_k(Tr(g^b))=\\\\left(Tr(g^{b(k-1)}),Tr(g^{bk}),Tr(g^{b(k+1)})\\\\right)\\\\in GF(p^2)^3. # Alice determines the symmetric key K based on Tr(g^{bk})\\\\in GF(p^2). # Alice uses the agreed upon symmetric encryption method with key K to decrypt E, resulting in the original message M. The here described encryption scheme is based on a common hybrid version of the ElGamal encryption, where the secret key K is obtained by an asymmetric public key system and then the message is encrypted with a symmetric key encryption method Alice and Bob agreed to. In the more traditional ElGamal encryption the message is restricted to the key space, which would here be GF(p^2), because Tr(g)\\\\in GF(p^2)\\\\ \\\\forall p\\\\in GF(p^6)^*. The encryption in this case is the multiplication of the message with the key, which is an invertible operation in the key space GF(p^2). Concretely this means if Bob wants to encrypt a message M\\\\\\\\!\\\\ ', first he has to convert it into an element M of GF(p^2) and then compute the encrypted message E as E=K\\\\cdot M\\\\in GF(p^2). Upon receipt of the encrypted message E Alice can recover the original message M by computing M=E\\\\cdot K^{-1}, where K^{-1} is the inverse of K in GF(p^2). Security In order to say something about the security properties of the above explained XTR encryption scheme, first it is important to check the security of the XTR group, which means how hard it is to solve the Discrete Logarithm problem there. The next part will then state the equivalency between the Discrete Logarithm problem in the XTR group and the XTR version of the discrete logarithm problem, using only the traces of elements. =Discrete logarithms in a general GF\\\\left(p^t\\\\right)= Let now \\\\langle \\\\gamma\\\\rangle be a multiplicative group of order \\\\omega. The security of the Diffie‚ÄìHellman protocol in \\\\langle \\\\gamma\\\\rangle relies on the Diffie‚ÄìHellman (DH) problem of computing \\\\gamma^{xy}\\\\text{ given }\\\\gamma, \\\\gamma^x\\\\text{ and }\\\\gamma^y. We write DH(\\\\gamma^x,\\\\ \\\\gamma^y)=\\\\gamma^{xy}. There are two other problems related to the DH problem. The first one is the Diffie‚ÄìHellman Decision (DHD) problem to determine if c=DH(a,b) for given a,b,c\\\\in\\\\langle\\\\gamma\\\\rangle and the second one is the Discrete Logarithm (DL) problem to find x=DL(a) for a given a=\\\\gamma^x\\\\in\\\\langle\\\\gamma\\\\rangle\\\\text{ with }0\\\\leq x<\\\\omega. The DL problem is at least as difficult as the DH problem and it is generally assumed that if the DL problem in \\\\langle \\\\gamma\\\\rangle is intractable, then so are the other two. Given the prime factorization of \\\\omega the DL problem in \\\\langle \\\\gamma\\\\rangle can be reduced to the DL problem in all subgroups of \\\\langle \\\\gamma\\\\rangle with prime order due to the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm. Hence \\\\omega can safely be assumed to be prime. For a subgroup \\\\langle\\\\gamma\\\\rangle of prime order \\\\omega of the multiplicative group GF\\\\left(p^t\\\\right)^* of an extension field GF(p^t) of GF(p) for some t, there are now two possible ways to attack the system. One can either focus on the whole multiplicative group or on the subgroup. To attack the multiplicative group the best known method is the Discrete Logarithm variant of the Number Field Sieve or alternatively in the subgroup one can use one of several methods that take \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\sqrt{\\\\omega}) operations in \\\\langle\\\\gamma\\\\rangle, such as Pollard's rho method. For both approaches the difficulty of the DL problem in \\\\langle\\\\gamma\\\\rangle depends on the size of the minimal surrounding subfield of \\\\langle\\\\gamma\\\\rangle and on the size of its prime order \\\\omega. If GF\\\\left(p^t\\\\right) itself is the minimal surrounding subfield of \\\\langle\\\\gamma\\\\rangle and \\\\omega is sufficiently large, then the DL problem in \\\\langle\\\\gamma\\\\rangle is as hard as the general DL problem in GF\\\\left(p^t\\\\right). The XTR parameters are now chosen in such a way that p is not small, q is sufficiently large and \\\\langle g\\\\rangle cannot be embedded in a true subfield of GF(p^6), since q\\\\mid p^2-p+1 and p^2-p+1 is a divisor of \\\\mid\\\\\\\\! GF(p^6)^*\\\\\\\\! \\\\mid=p^6-1, but it does not divide p^s-1\\\\text{ for }s\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,2,3\\\\\\\\} and thus \\\\langle g\\\\rangle cannot be a subgroup of GF\\\\\\\\!\\\\ (p^s)^* for s\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,2,3\\\\\\\\}. It follows that the DL problem in the XTR group may be assumed as hard as the DL problem in GF(p^6). = Security of XTR = Cryptographic protocols that are based on Discrete Logarithms can use many different types of subgroups like groups of points of elliptic curves or subgroups of the multiplicative group of a finite field like the XTR group. As we have seen above the XTR versions of the Diffie‚ÄìHellman and ElGamal encryption protocol replace using elements of the XTR group by using their traces. This means that the security of the XTR versions of these encryption schemes is no longer based on the original DH, DHD or DL problems. Therefore, the XTR versions of those problems need to be defined and we will see that they are equivalent (in the sense of the next definition) to the original problems. Definitions: *We define the XTR-DH problem as the problem of computing Tr(g^{xy}) given Tr(g^x) and Tr(g^y) and we write XDH(g^x,\\\\ g^y)=g^{xy}. *The XTR-DHD problem is the problem of determining whether XDH(a,b)=c for a,b,c\\\\in Tr(\\\\langle g\\\\rangle). *Given a\\\\in Tr(\\\\langle g\\\\rangle), the XTR-DL problem is to find x=XDL(a), i.e. 0\\\\leq x\\" such that a=Tr(g^x). * We say that problem \\\\mathcal{A} is (a,b)-equivalent to problem \\\\mathcal{B}, if any instance of problem \\\\mathcal{A} (or \\\\mathcal{B}) can be solved by at most a (or b) calls to an algorithm solving problem \\\\mathcal{B} (or \\\\mathcal{A}). After introducing the XTR versions of these problems the next theorem is an important result telling us the connection between the XTR and the non-XTR problems, which are in fact equivalent. This implies that the XTR representation of elements with their traces is, as can be seen above, faster by a factor of 3 than the usual representation without compromising security. Theorem The following equivalencies hold: :i. The XTR-DL problem is (1,1)-equivalent to the DL problem in \\\\langle g\\\\rangle. :ii.

It was created by Genie Toys and licensed to Playmates Toys and it began with the majority of the superheroes and supervillains from Marvel in 2006. Marvel Battle Dice=Purchasing= The figures can be purchased in booster packs or in starter sets. The booster packs contain 3 random battle figures and one battle die. The starter set comes with 6 figures (two of which are secret). There are also battle dice launchers, which are large sized versions of the Thing and the Hulk. =The Game= The game works by placing the figures (approximately 1\\" inch) in the battle dice, which have certain attributes by popping the dice open. When the dice are rolled, the player with the lower dice roll goes first. They select an attribute on the character, and use them to battle the other figure(s). Then the attributes take place, and so on and so forth, and the player with a certain roll wins, etc. Currently, there are 23 different dice. The attributes are measured on a 0-6 scale, 6 being the highest; those attributes are: Intelligence, Strength, Speed, Durability, Energy, and Fighting Skills. Characters are ranked points; in most tournaments teams cannot exceed 30 points, making figures like the powerful Dark Phoenix too expensive to use. A comprehensive explanation can be found at any of the first two links in the links section. =The Production Run= On September 12, 2006 Playmates Toys officially announced that the game would no longer be supported. The official site announced that the company would be turning its attention away from the game. Series 2 figures although announced for release no longer have an official release date and may never ship. The game received quite a few reviews all of which were above average. And an official reason has not been given as to the end of this games production. Tournament vouchers should be honored until the beginning of December 2006. After that time they will return any further vouchers un-opened. The first official tournament was held in Sandy Utah on May 20, 2006. The last official tournament has not been revealed.

It is a direct sequel to the latter, and forms part of the \\"Shatnerverse\\" collection of novels, being the third novel written by Shatner for the Trek series of novels. It was published in 1997 by Pocket Books. Plot summary The Federation must contain a \\"virogen\\" (plague) that is killing plant life, damaging animal young, and killing people on several vital systems that collectively supply food for the entire Federation. Avenger opens with the Federation trying to maintain a strict quarantine to contain the spread of the virogen as the Federation's reserves run low. The Enterprise-E is assigned to a blockade of the Alta Vista system, home to the Gamrow Station, a research facility designed to house about 60 scientists which is temporarily being used as a refugee camp for 1400 people. Captain Jean-Luc Picard and his crew attempt to stop a shuttlecraft, piloted by a Vulcan called Stron and a pregnant human woman, from fleeing the quarantined system, but the two appear to commit suicide by trying to jump into warp while caught in the Enterprise-E's tractor beam. Picard, however, knowing that Vulcans believe suicide to be illogical, is unconvinced that the couple actually died in the warp core explosion. Meanwhile, on the once-verdant planet of Chal (first referenced in The Ashes of Eden), a mysterious stranger walks through the desolation towards a Starfleet medical outpost. He meets with the commanding officer, Christine McDonald, and requests the location of the burial place of a native woman named Teilani. He discovers, with Christine's help, that Teilani is not dead, not yet, but will be soon with the virogen quickly working through her body. He goes to her and prepares an unusual herbal tea with dried leaves and hot water. Commander McDonald and the outpost's doctor, Andrea M'Benga, look on in amazement as Teilani begins to miraculously recover. The stranger reveals to M'Benga that the leaves are Trannin leaves, native to the Klingon home planet. Christine determines to send a message to Starfleet, announcing that a way to combat the virogen has been found. Christine's suspicions of the stranger's identity are aroused when Teilani calls the stranger \\"James.\\" Her suspicions are further confirmed when she finds a plaque that the stranger had used as a tray for the tea, emblazoned with the name and number of the starship Enterprise from eighty years in the past. Christine confronts the stranger with her belief that he is actually James T. Kirk, which he does not deny, insisting that she only refer to him as \\"Jim,\\" and that she reveal his real identity to no one. It is later revealed Kirk was saved by a fortuitous last-minute Borg transporter beam-out. Flung to another galaxy entirely, he materializes on planet which is used as a dumping ground for the detritus of failed Borg missions. At the verge of death, on a planet near a galactic core, Kirk is discovered by beings who were able to release themselves from Borg assimilation. His body is purged of the Borg nanites which had been killing him, and after two years of working, living, and learning from, and with, the survivors, he discovers a Borg scout ship which he uses to return to the planet Chal. Captain Picard dispatches a search party to an asteroid which was nearby to the explosion of the Vulcan shuttle to determine whether Stron and his wife really died there. Commander Data confirms that there are no traces of organic particles in the area, thus proving that Stron and his mate somehow escaped the shuttle prior to its detonation. However, the manner of their escape remains a mystery. Picard reports his findings personally to the commander of the Gamrow Station, Chiton Kincaid, by beaming down alone to speak with her. He realizes with horror as their conversation goes on that she was already, in fact, aware that Stron and the woman did not die in the explosion. Before he can react, she attacks him with a disruptor and he blacks out. Back on Chal, Teilani is almost fully recovered, but still weak. Kirk cares for her faithfully, and is in the process of building a home. However, their peaceful life is jarringly interrupted when a wing of Orion pirates begin mercilessly attacking the medical base. Jim begins running towards the base, only to be beamed up to Commander McDonald's ship, the U.S.S. Tobias. Christine insists that Kirk momentarily assume command and take out the Orion fighters. Reluctantly, Jim agrees on the condition that Teilani be beamed up immediately. Once he knows she is safe, he takes a course of action by bringing the Tobias into the planet's atmosphere and successfully outmaneuvering the pirate ships. To Christine's dismay, he insists on destroying all of the pirates, rather than letting the survivors flee. Jim explains that Orions are mercenaries, with no reason to attack Chal if there's no money in it; someone must have intercepted Christine's message to Starfleet about the Trannin leaves, and sent the Orions to ravage the base. Kirk's suspicions are aroused: there's no way in his mind that the rapid spread of the virogen is an accident. It is soon discovered that the virogen outbreak was created intentionally by the Symmetrists, a group of eco-terrorists who have links to Captain James T. Kirk's past. The resurrected Kirk, along with Captain Jean-Luc Picard, and their respective crews, must unite to uncover the conspiracy that caused this before it undermines the Federation. Ambassador Spock, concurrently, is on a deeply personal mission of his own. He is personally bound to find the murderer of his father Sarek, believing that a conscious decision, not a disease, sealed his father's fate. He and Kirk reunite to avenge Sarek's death. During this time, Spock, though not entirely of his own volition, occasionally releases all his emotional self-control. This lack of control, uncharacteristic for a Vulcan, is a signature trait of Bendii disease, the same affliction which (supposedly) killed his father. Kirk and Spock discover that the people who assassinated Sarek are now after Spock, having infected him with a disease very similar to Bendii. It is revealed that a personal aide to both Sarek and Spock killed Sarek by using a poison whose effects were nearly identical to those of Bendii syndrome. In the end, it is Kirk, accompanied by Spock, who avenges Sarek's death. After, Kirk returns to Teilani and Spock is given treatment to expunge the poison from his body.

The town was founded sometime in the 1320s, at first becoming the capital of the Tarascan state and later its ceremonial center. After the Spanish took over, Vasco de Quiroga worked to make P√°tzcuaro the capital of the New Spain province of Michoac√°n, but after his death, the capital would be moved to nearby Valladolid (today Morelia). P√°tzcuaro has retained its colonial and indigenous character since then, and it has been named one of the 111 \\"Pueblos M√°gicos\\" by the government of Mexico. P√°tzcuaro, and the lake region to which it belongs, is well known as a site for Day of the Dead celebrations. There are several possibilities as to the meaning of \\"P√°tzcuaro.\\" The first is \\"phascuaro,\\" which means \\"place dyed in black;\\" or \\"patatzecuaro,\\" which means \\"place of foundations.\\" Another possible meaning is \\"petatzim√≠cuaro,\\" \\"place of bullrushes.\\" Other possible meanings are: \\" happy place;\\" and \\"seat of temples.\\" P√°tzcuaro received its coat of arms in 1553 from Charles V of Spain. History The only history available about the founding of P√°tzcuaro comes from the Relaci√≥n de Michoac√°n written in 1539-1541, during the era of Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza. It states that two chiefs by the names of P√°racume and V√°peani arrived in the area, then called Tarimichundiro, with their tribe, the Chichimecas. Here they began to build their temples, called \\"cues\\" by placing four large rocks close together. No date is given for this event, but since the deaths of the two original chiefs occurred in 1360, it is widely supposed that the founding occurred around 1324. Around this time, three indigenous groups lived around Lake P√°tzcuaro, who continuously fought each other. One group was called the \\"Coringuaro,\\" another group the \\"Isle√±os\\" and the third the Chichimecas in P√°tzcuaro. The Tarascan kingdom began with Tari√°curi, the first chief of the area assumed the title of \\"caltzontzin,\\" or emperor, by conquering his neighbors. P√°tzcuaro was the first capital of the Tarascos. The new kingdom was divided into three principalities called Ihuatzio, Tzintzuntzan and P√°tzcuaro. Later, power shifted to the Tzintzuntzan principality, becoming the new capital, leaving P√°tzcuaro as the ceremonial center, and a retreat for the nobility. When the Spanish arrived in Michoac√°n, many sought refuge in P√°tzcuaro. Forts were built in a neighborhood that is still called \\"Barrio Fuerte\\" (Fort Neighborhood). Fighting continued between the Tarascans and the Spanish. A meeting between the emperor Tanganxoan II and Crist√≥bal de Olid was arranged. Getting down off his horse, Olid embraced the monarch, then forced him to kneel in front of the crowd. Later a chapel was built which is called \\"El Humilladero\\" (The Place of Humiliation). In 1526, Nu√±o de Guzm√°n came as head of the new Spanish government to punish the Tarascans harshly. This culminated with the torture and death of Tanganxoan II the last Tarascan emperor. After this, most residents of P√°tzcuaro fled to the mountains leaving the area mostly unpopulated. Vasco de Quiroga arrived in P√°tzcuaro to take over. He expelled Nu√±o de Guzm√°n and confiscated his properties. Nu√±o was eventually sent back to Spain as a prisoner for his crimes in New Spain. A statue of the Virgin Mary in indigenous garb In 1538, the Spanish established their settlement in P√°tzcuaro, founding the Diocese of Michoac√°n with Vasco de Quiroga as first bishop. P√°tzcuaro was made the capital of the new Spanish province. The 1540s saw a repopulation of the area with Bishop Vasco de Quiroga convincing many of the Indians to return and brought in a number of Spanish families. For this Vasco de Quiroga is considered to be the founder of modern P√°tzcuaro. He renamed the city as the City of Michoac√°n, which was confirmed by royal decree in 1553, with P√°tzcuaro receiving its current coat of arms. The cathedral was constructed over the temple dedicated to the goddess Cuer√°ppari. Vasco de Quiroga wanted to build an ambitious cathedral here, with five naves, but this was declared unacceptable by the Spanish crown and only one of the naves was built. It remains to this day. P√°tzcuaro remained the largest city in the Spanish province until about ten years after Vasco de Quiroga's death. Viceregal authorities then decided to change the capital to the recently founded Valladolid (today Morelia) in 1575. Ecclesiastical authorities moved the diocese and the College of San Nicol√°s, established by Vasco de Quiroga, to Valladolid as well. P√°tzcuaro remained the economic and spiritual center of the Lake P√°tzcuaro region with life dominated by Franciscan and Augustinian friars. In the mid 18th century, the city had a population of about 3,300 people. During the Mexican War of Independence, P√°tzcuaro was attacked several times. Gertrudis Bocanegra was shot by firing squad for her participation in insurgent activities by royalist forces on the main square of P√°tzcuaro on 10 October 1817. After Independence, the town was the capital of the 12th district of the West Department of Michoac√°n. In 1831, the state was reorganized and P√°tzcuaro became the seat of the municipality of the same name. During the Reform War in 1867, P√°tzcuaro sided with the Conservatives, who wanted to maintain the second Mexican empire. The city was then attacked by General R√©gules of the Republican side, who took possession of the town after a bloody fight and named liberal leaders. During the Porfirio D√≠az period, just before the Mexican Revolution, the P√°tzcuaro area was heavily dominated by large landholders, haciendas and some foreign companies, pushing popular sympathy with the rebels to come. The town became a strategic point for taking the Michoac√°n capital. The town remained in rebel hands for most of the conflict but was taken in 1913 by Victoriano Huerta's government. During the presidency of L√°zaro C√°rdenas (1934‚Äì40), who was from Michoac√°n, P√°tzcuaro became a cultural center and national destination for tourism, building infrastructure to support the industry, creating public monuments and archeological excavations, and conservation of its colonial and indigenous look.Jennifer Jolly, Creating P√°tzcuaro, Creating Mexico: Art, Tourism, and Nation Building Under L√°zaro C√°rdenas. Austin: University of Texas Press 2018. Town Street in front of Casa de los Once Patios Since the Mexican Revolution, Patzcuaro has worked to keep its traditional colonial- indigenous look. Unlike the capital, houses in P√°tzcuaro are made of adobe and/or wood and generally have tiled roofs. Cobblestone streets dominate the center of town down to the lake. The town is filled with stores and vendors selling a wide variety of crafts, many in bright colors. Patzcuaro is the market hub of the region, with smaller villages bringing in their own specialized crafts such as copperware, black pottery, musical instruments, baskets etc. Local dishes include tamales or uchepos, filled with fish, tarasca soup, red pozole, atole, trout dishes, and a number of cold drinks based on corn. The courtyards and balconies are almost always filled with flowering plants, which is a tradition in Patzcuaro, with many homeowners sharing tips and plants with each other, sometimes even cross breeding a new variety of flower. The most common flower to be seen is the begonia, which blooms best between July and September. Other common plants include geraniums, mallows, bougainvilleas, tiger lilies, marigolds, azaleas, hydrangeas, roses and others. Non-flowering plants that can also be seen include palm trees, selaginella and various cacti. Some grow medicinal and culinary herbs such as aloe, chamomile, mint, basil and others. street next to the Plaza Grande The town center is called the Plaza Vasco de Quiroga or the Plaza Grande. This plaza is large considering the size of the town. The Plaza Grande was dedicated to Vasco de Quiroga in 1964, when a fountain containing a bronze statue of the bishop was placed in the center. This sculpture was done by Costa Rican artist Francisco Z√∫√±iga. The Plaza is surrounded by old, stately ash trees and colonial-era mansions. Unlike most other towns and cities in Mexico, the main church does not face this plaza. While crafts can be seen for sale in all of the town, they are prominent in the Plaza. The main square is filled with stores selling a very wide variety of crafts including carved wooden statues and furniture, brightly painted accents depicting flowers and animals, brilliant piles of woven textiles, draperies, tablecloths, bedspreads and napkins, wooden figures, religious art, clay plaques and pots, polished wooden boxes and guitars, picture frames, woolen blankets, copper vases and platters, basketry and items made of woven straw and reed, and sculpted and scented candles. Many of these are on display in the shops set into the colonial buildings around the plaza, with much more inside. Upper level of the Palace Facing the main plaza is the Palace of Huitzim√©ngari. This structure, like most of the rest of the town, is made of adobe and has a clay tile roof. This palace belonged to Antonio de Huitzim√©ngari, the son of the last Tarascan cazonci (monarch), and the godson of the first viceroy of New Spain, Antonio de Mendoza. It has two floors, a sober facade and the inner courtyard is surrounded with round arches and filled with flowers. On the upper floor, there is a statue of a dog, an allusion to Huitzim√©ngari's name which in Tarascan mythology referred to the dog that served the Lord of Paradise. The dog motif is repeated on some of the inside doors. Juan O‚ÄôGorman mural at the library One block to the north of the Vasco Plaza is the Plaza Gertrudis Bocanegra, also called the Plaza Chica. The market off of Gertrudis Bocanegra specializes in woolen goods, kitchen implements, pottery, copper and straw items. Friday is market day, filling the walkways here with stalls with goods from various villages. Near main holidays, such as Day of the Dead, this market can spill over to the other two plazas in town as well. One of the buildings next to this plaza is the Ex Temple of San Agustin, which was founded in the 16th century. Today it houses the Gertrudis Bocanegra Library. This library has a mural painted by Juan O'Gorman depicting the history of Michoac√°n. Facade of the Basilica Two blocks east of the Plaza Chica is the most important church in P√°tzcuaro, the Basilica of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Salud. This church was built by Vasco de Quiroga over a pre-Hispanic ceremonial site to function as the Cathedral of Michoac√°n. Vasco de Quiroga's original project was ambitious, with five naves surrounding a cupola, but the Spanish Crown thought the project inappropriate and only one of the naves was built. The church served as the Cathedral until 1850, when that function was moved to Valladolid (now Morelia). This church was designated a basilica in 1924. The facades have been modified since it was built at the end of the 19th century, which is why it now has a Neoclassical appearance. The inside has a roof decorated to look like a vault but it is really a flat roof. The image here is the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception that originally was in the Hospital of Santa Marta. Now called \\"Our Lady of Health\\", it is made with corn-stalk paste and honey that was created in the 16th century. The remains of Vasco de Quiroga are interred here. This basilica is visited every day, but especially on the eighth day of every month to pay homage to the region's patroness. Facade of the Museo de Artes e Industrias Populares The Museo de Artes e Industrias Populares (Museum of Popular Arts and Industries) is located just south of the Basilica. The building was originally constructed as the College of San Nicol√°s in the 16th century by Vasco de Quiroga to prepare young men for the priesthood and to teach Indian youth to read and write. After the College was moved to Valladolid in 1580, the building was turned over to the Jesuits to found the College of Santa Catarina which functioned as a primary school. It contains one of the largest collections of lacquered items, models, and other crafts. The Temple Sagrario The Temple Sagrario was begun in 1693 and completed exactly two centuries later. For this reason, it has incorporated a number of different architectural styles, with different decorative elements. The temple has a Neoclassical interior, with the parquetry floors as the only aspect left of the original construction. It has a Churrigueresque altar and on the west wall there is a small chapel dedicated to the Virgin of Dolores on a Baroque altarpiece. These are the only ones of their type left in P√°tzcuaro. The building has functioned as the Sanctuary of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Salud since 1924. Entrance patio of the Casa de los Once Patios The Casa de los Once Patios (House of Eleven Courtyards) was constructed in 1742 for Dominican nuns of the order of Santa Catarina de Sena. They gradually expanded the initial building by buying adjacent houses, which is why the complex once had eleven courtyards, but now that is down to only five. In the west corridor, the oldest part of the complex, there is a fountain and a Baroque portal leading to a room that had a bathtub with hot and cold running water, a rare luxury at the time. In the 1960s, the complex was restored and since then has functioned as workshops and stores for local crafts. The workshops include those that make shawls and lacquered items. Behind the Casa de los Once Patios is the Pila de San Miguel. According to legend, the devil was bothering the women who were coming here to get water. To scare the devil away, Vasco de Quiroga put the image of the Archangel Michael there. The Church of San Ignacio de Loyola, better known as the Temple of the Company of Jesus, is one of the most relevant religious structures architecturally. It has a sober Baroque facade divided into panels which is typical for this area. The interior guards valuable religious paintings such as a series of angels, and works done in wood. One of these is multicolored panel about Saint Ignatius of Loyola. The east wall of this church held the remains of Vasco de Quiroga before they were moved to the Basilica. The complex has a large courtyard and a \\"punished\\" clock, set high up in a tower. It is considered \\"punished\\" as it does not chime at twelve noon. It is said that the machinery for the clock was brought from Spain on orders of Charles V who wanted to get rid of it for marking an hour that was disagreeable to the Crown. Another story states that an unfortunate young woman was killed by the clock when she got in the way of the bell and the pendulum when it was ready to ring twelve. In the 16th century, the complex suffered major damage due to a fire. It was rebuilt to the look that it has now. This temple and the cloister next door housed the Jesuits when they came to P√°tzcuaro at the request of Vasco de Quiroga because of their reputation in the field of education. The adjoining building is now the Casa de Cultura. The Chapel del Humilladero was constructed by Vasco de Quiroga in 1553 on the site where the last Tarascan emperor, Tanganxoan II, was forced to kneel before the Spanish, giving the site its name (The Place of Humiliation). The crucifix of this chapel was sculpted from a single block of cantera stone, both the body and the cross. It is said that Vasco de Quiroga had the piece sculpted in 1553, but it was not finished until 1628. Lake P√°tzcuaro Fishing boats on the lake P√°tzcuaro sits on the southern edge of Lake P√°tzcuaro, and this lake still has important economic and cultural significance for the town. Associated with P√°tzcuaro are a number of islands, the best-known of which is Janitzio, a name that means corn hair. It is recognizable through the forty- meter statue of Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n that is on the top of the hill. Underneath the statue is a series of murals about the life of this Mexican hero. There are four other islands in the lake. La Pacanda is in the center. This island has a small pond in it with carp and ducks. Yune√©n Island is near the center and its name means half moon. Its attractions include its vegetation, traditional houses and cabins for visitors. Urandenes is closer to Patzcuaro and consists of three islands surrounded by canals in which white fish were formally raised. The pez blanco (whitefish) that used to bring tourists to P√°tzcuaro are no longer fished because of the lake's contamination, although on special occasions the famous butterfly nets are often displayed in canoes on the water. Tecuena is the smallest island in the lake and its name means good honey. The docks at P√°tzcuaro have boats that travel to these islands. Until 2007, only P√°tzcuaro had a water treatment facility with smaller communities discharging wastewater directly into the lake, causing grave pollution problems. Contamination has mostly been chemical, trash and wastewater, as well as sediment during the rainy season. The government of the state of Michoac√°n, the federal environmental protection agency and the Instituto Mexicano de Tecnologia del Agua have started a program to clean up the basin of Lake P√°tzcuaro. The plan is to repair the existing water treatment facilities and build two more. It also includes reforestation around the lake, landfills and barriers to prevent the contamination of the streams of the basin. Day of the Dead Catrina figure bought in P√°tzcuaro P√°tzcuaro and the surrounding lake area have one of the best-known Day of the Dead celebrations in Mexico. Markets catering to Day of the Dead abound in all of Michoac√°n but the best of what is to be had is in the market in the main plaza of P√°tzcuaro. This is where one of the major craft competitions is held. Day of the Dead is celebrated very intensely in the towns and villages around Lake P√°tzcuaro. Preparations include major cleaning and repair of the local cemeteries and the creation of flowered arches for gates of the atriums of local churches. These are made with a flower called cempas√∫chil, also known as the Mexican marigold. In the early morning of November 1, the \\"velaci√≥n de los angelitos\\" (wake for the little angels) to honor children who have died during the previous year. This is generally done in the local cemeteries. During this day also is an event called the \\"teruscan,\\" in which children run around town \\"stealing\\" ears of corn, squash and chayotes from the roofs of neighbors‚Äô houses. The stolen food is brought to the community center to be cooked to feed the community. Festivities continue to midnight on November 2, which begins the \\"velaci√≥n de los difuntos\\" (wake for the deceased) when again the towns gather in local cemeteries. This time men remain outside. Women and children enter to lay offerings of flowers and food, generally laid on embroidered napkins. Then prayers and chants are recited. For this reason Day of the Dead is usually referred to in P√°tzcuaro as Night of the Dead. When daylight comes, a collection of food is taken for the parish priest and most people go to mass. A parallel event in P√°tzcuaro and other towns in Michoac√°n is the Festival Cultural de la Muerte. Since 1993, this event has been held to exhibit paintings, photographs, film, dance, crafts and altars that are created for this day. Canoeing competitions on the lake are popular here as well as \\"torneos de calaveras\\"(tournaments of skulls) which are satirical poetry contests with the theme of death and black humor. This festival takes place from 27 October to 2 November. Other traditional events associated with Day of the Dead here include the Concert of the Basilica of P√°tzcuaro and the staging of \\"Don Juan Tenorio\\" in Erongar√≠cuaro. Both take place at 9 pm on 1 November. Another interesting event is the \\"Juego Prehispanico de Pelota Encendida (Mesoamerican ball game ‚Äìlighted) At 7 pm on 1 November in the village of Tzintzuntzan the game is played in the old ball court, called Las Y√°catas, with a ball set on fire. It is also done in the main square of the village. There is a legend related to the Day of the Dead here about two Tarascan nobles, the princess Mintzita and the prince Itzihuapa. They were in love but unable to unite in part because of the arrival of the Spanish to Michoac√°n. Princess Mintzita offered the Spanish the treasure that was hidden at the bottom of Lake Patzcuaro for the release of her father. Itzihuapa himself offered to go and get it, but when he did, he was captured by the twenty ghosts that guard treasure, becoming the 21st guardian. This broke Mintzita's heart. However, this occurred on the night that these guardian ghosts come back to life for one night and the two lovers were able to spend time together until daylight. Municipality As municipal seat, the town of P√°tzcuaro is the governing authority over 104 other named communities, with a total population of 79,868 and a territory of 435.96km2. The 2005 census indicates that just under 4,000 people still speak an indigenous language, Tarascan, in the municipality. The municipality borders the municipalities of Tzintzuntzan, Huiramba, Salvador Escalante, Tingambato and Erongar√≠cuaro. The municipality covers most of the P√°tzcuaro basin, which is part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and surrounded by a number of mountains such as the Cerro el Blanco, Cerro del Estribo, Cerro del Frijol and Cerro del Burro. Almost all the water in Lake P√°tzcuaro comes from one stream called the El Chorrito and a number of fresh-water springs. The climate is temperate with rains in the summer. Temperatures vary during the year between a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 30C.Weather Underground station IMICHOAC7 The municipality is primarily covered in forests with pine, holm oak and cedar trees. Most fauna consists of small mammals and fish found in the lake. Agricultural activity mostly revolves around the growing of corn, wheat, beans, lentils and tomatoes. Livestock such as cattle, pigs, sheep, donkeys, horses and fowl are also raised in the area. Most industry here involves food processing and the making of crafts such as furniture, textiles, jewelry, ironwork, religious figures and other things. Most commerce revolves around catering to tourists and meeting locals‚Äô basic needs. Fishing is still done in the lake. Tourism is mostly based on sites located in the town of P√°tzcuaro, along with neighboring archeological sites of Ihuatzio and Tzintzuntzan. Sports such as mountain biking and paragliding have also been introduced. See also *Tourism in Mexico Further reading *Jolly, Jennifer.

On 20 October 1975, the station was demolished and replaced with the current wooden platform to reduce the maintenance costs.Wiragulla Station NSWRail.net In the late 1990s it was proposed that Wirragulla, along with Allandale and Belford would be closed, as all three stations had extremely low patronage, and there were some safety concerns at these stations. The proposal to close these stations was later withdrawn (this explains why Allandale, Belford and Wirragulla are not shown on ticket machines installed in the late 1990s).
