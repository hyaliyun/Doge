Born in Garron Borris in Ossory, County Laois in 1933 a townsland on the outskirts of his native village of Knock in Co. Tipperary. Kieran Carey first arrived on the inter- county scene at the age of twenty-five when he first linked up with the Tipperary senior team. He made his senior debut in the 1957‚Äì58 National League. Carey went on to play a key role for Tipperary as part of the so- called \\"Hell's Kitchen\\" full-back line, and won five All-Ireland medals, seven Munster medals and five National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Carey won several Railway Cup medals as a non- playing substitute. At club level he was a one-time All-Ireland medallist with Roscrea. In addition to this he also won two Munster medals and four championship medals. Carey also won a championship medal with Kyle. Throughout his career Carey made 29 championship appearances. His retirement came following Tipperary's defeat by Kilkenny in the 1967 championship. In retirement from playing Carey became involved in team management and coaching, serving as a selector with the Tipperary senior team. Playing career =Club= Carey began his club hurling career with Kyle. He was just out of the minor grade when the club qualified for the 1951 senior decider, which was delayed until the following year A three-point victory gave Carey a championship medal. Shortly after this victory Carey joined the Roscrea club after moving to the town in an effort to find work. In 1968 he was in the twilight of his career when Roscrea enjoyed a brief period of success. A 2‚Äì13 to 3‚Äì4 of Thurles Sarsfields gave him his first championship medal. Roscrea retained their championship crown in 1969, with Carey collecting a second championship medal following a 4‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì5 trouncing of Carrick Davins. He later won a Munster medal following a narrow 3‚Äì6 to 1‚Äì9 defeat of Glen Rovers. In 1970 Roscrea made it three championships in-a-row following a 3‚Äì11 to 2‚Äì12 defeat of Thurles Sarsfields. Carey later won a second Munster medal as Clarecastle were heavily defeated by 4‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì6. On 19 December 1971 Roscrea faced St. Rynagh's in the inaugural All-Ireland cub decider. Goals proved the key for Roscrea as two solo-run goals from Joe Cunningham and Joe Tynan helped the club to a 5‚Äì5 to 2‚Äì5 victory. The victory gave thirty-eight-year-old Carey an All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship medal. Four-in-a-row proved beyond Roscrea, however, the club bounced back in 1972. A 5‚Äì8 to 3‚Äì6 defeat of Borris-Ileigh gave Carey a fourth and final championship medal. =Inter- county= Beginnings On 1 June 1958 Carey made his senior championship debut in a 2‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì5 Munster quarter-final defeat of Limerick. He later won his first Munster medal following a 4‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì5 trouncing of reigning champions Waterford. Tipp later defeated Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi- final before lining out against Galway in the All-Ireland decider on 7 September 1958. Galway got a bye into the final without picking up a hurley. Liam Devaney, Donie Nealon and Larry Keane all scored goals for Tipperary in the first-half, while Tony Wall sent a seventy-yard free untouched to the Galway net. Tipperary won the game by 4‚Äì9 to 2‚Äì5 giving Carey his first All- Ireland medal in his debut season. Carey won his first National League medal in 1959 following a 0‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì7 defeat of Waterford, however, Tipperary subsequently surrendered their provincial and All-Ireland crowns. Tipperary asserted their dominance in 1960 by retaining the National League title with a 2‚Äì15 to 3‚Äì8 defeat of Cork. It was Carey's second winners' medal in that competition. He later won a second Munster medal following a narrow 4‚Äì13 to 4‚Äì11 defeat of Cork in what has been described as the toughest game of hurling ever played. This victory allowed Tipperary to advance directly to an All- Ireland final meeting with Wexford on 4 September 1960. A certain amount of over-confidence was obvious in the Tipperary camp, particularly in trainer Phil Purcell's comment that no player was capable of marking star forward Jimmy Doyle. The game ended in remarkable circumstances as the crowd invaded the pitch with a minute to go, mistaking the referee's whistle for the end of the game. When the crowd were finally moved off the pitch Tipperary continued playing with only twelve men, but Wexford won on a score line of 2‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì11. It was Carey's first All-Ireland defeat. Total dominance 1961 saw Doyle collect a third National League medal following a 6‚Äì6 to 4‚Äì9 defeat of Waterford. He later added a third Munster medal to his collection, as old rivals Cork were downed by 3‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì7. The absence of the All-Ireland semi- final allowed Tipperary to advance directly to the final itself, with Dublin's first native hurling team providing the opposition on 3 September 1961. The game was a close run thing, however, Tipperary held on to win by 0‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì12. It was Carey's second All-Ireland medal. In 1962 Tipperary were still the kingpins of Munster. A 5‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì3 trouncing of Waterford in the decider gave Carey a fourth Munster medal. Tipperary's nemesis of two years earlier, Wexford, waited in Croke Park to test them once again in the subsequent All- Ireland final on 2 September 1962. Wexford, however, were not the force of old and the side got off to possibly the worst start ever by a team in a championship decider. After just ninety seconds the Leinster champions were down by two goals, however, the game turned out to be much closer than people expected. Tipperary eventually secured the win on a score line of 3‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì11, giving Carey a third All-Ireland medal. After losing the following year's Munster final to Waterford in one of the hurling shocks of the decade, Tipperary bounced back in 1964 with Carey collecting a fourth National League medal. Tipperary later cantered casually past Cork by fourteen points in the provincial decider, giving Carey a fifth Munster medal. The All-Ireland final on 6 September 1964 saw Kilkenny enter the game as firm favourites against Tipperary. John \\"Mackey\\" McKenna scored Tipp's first goal after ten minutes as the Munster champions took a 1‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì6 interval lead. The second half saw Tipperary score goals for fun, with Donie Nealon getting a hat-trick and Se√°n McLoughlin another. Kilkenny were humiliated at the full-time whistle as Tipperary triumphed by 5‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì8. It was Carey's fourth All-Ireland medal. In 1965 Carey won a fifth and final National League medal as New York were narrowly defeated on an aggregate score of 6‚Äì19 to 5‚Äì20. Tipperary demolished all opposition in the provincial championship once again and a 4‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì5 trouncing of Cork gave Carey a sixth Munster medal. Wexford were Tipperary's opponents in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 5 September 1965, however, the game failed to live up to the two classic games between the two sides in 1960 and 1962. Victory went to Tipperary on that occasion by 2‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì10, courtesy of a brace of goals by Se√°n McLoughlin. The win gave Carey a fifth All-Ireland medal. Decline After surrendering their provincial crown in 1966, Tipperary bounced back the following year, with Carey winning a seventh Munster medal following a 4‚Äì12 to 2‚Äì6 defeat of Clare. 3 September 1967 saw Kilkenny face Tipperary in the All-Ireland decider. Tipp looked like continuing their hoodoo over their near rivals as they took a 2‚Äì6 to 1‚Äì3 lead at half-time. Goalkeeper Ollie Walsh was the hero for Kilkenny as he made a series of spectacular saves, however, the team lost Eddie Keher and Tom Walsh to injury in the second half. In spite of this, Kilkenny laid to rest a bogey that Tipperary had over the team since 1922, and a 3‚Äì8 to 2‚Äì7 victory resulted in defeat for Carey's team. The defeat brought the curtain down on Carey's inter-county career. =Inter-provincial= Carey was first picked for the Munster inter-provincial team in 1959 as a member of the extended panel. He won his first Railway Cup medal that year, albeit as a non-playing substitute, as Munster trounced Connacht by 7‚Äì11 to 2‚Äì6. It was the first of three successive winners' medals in that competition for Carey, however, they were all claimed from the substitutes' bench. In 1962 Carey was at left corner-back as Munster qualified for yet another Railway Cup decider. Leinster were narrowly triumphant on that occasion by 1‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì9. Carey was once again dropped from the starting fifteen in 1963, however, he won a fourth Railway Cup medal as a non-playing sub as Munster narrowly defeated Leinster in a replay. After a on-year absence Carey was added to the starting fifteen again in 1965, however, in a similar pattern to previous years Munster were heavily defeated by Leinster. Carey won his fifth and final Railway Cup medal as a non-playing substitute in 1965 as Munster accounted for their old rivals Leinster by 3‚Äì13 to 3‚Äì11.

The majority of Cronobacter sakazakii cases are adults but low-birth-weight preterm neonatal and older infants are highest at risk. The disease is associated with a rare cause of invasive infection infants with historically high case fatality rates (40‚Äì80%). Free full text In infants it can cause bacteraemia, meningitis and necrotizing enterocolitis. Most neonatal C. sakazakii infections cases have been associated with the use of powdered infant formula with some strains able to survive in a desiccated state for more than two years. However, not all cases have been linked to contaminated infant formula. In November 2011, several shipments of Kotex tampons were recalled due to a Cronobacter (E. sakazakii) contamination. There also was a study done where they found the strands of pathogen in 12% of field vegetables and 13% of hydroponic vegetables. All Cronobacter species, except C. condimenti, have been linked retrospectively to clinical cases of infection in either adults or infants. However multilocus sequence typing has shown that the majority of neonatal meningitis cases in the past 30 years, across 6 countries have been associated with only one genetic lineage of the species Cronobacter sakazakii called 'Sequence Type 4' or 'ST4', and therefore this clone appears to be of greatest concern with infant infections. The bacterium is ubiquitous being isolated from a range of environments and foods, and the majority of Cronobacter cases are in the adult population. However it is the association with intrinsically or extrinsically contaminated powdered formula which has attracted the main attention. According to multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) the genus originated ~40 MYA, and the most clinically significant species, C. sakazakii, was distinguishable ~15-23 MYA. Taxonomy E. sakazakii was defined as a species in 1980 by JJ Farmer III et al. DNA-DNA hybridization showed that E. sakazakii was 53‚Äì54% related to species in two different genera, Enterobacter and Citrobacter. However, diverse biogroups within E. sakazakii were described and Farmer et al suggested these may represent different species and required further research for clarification. The taxonomic relationship between E. sakazakii strains has been studied using full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing, DNA-DNA hybridization, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), f-AFLP, automated ribotyping. This resulted in the classification of E. sakazakii as a new genus, Cronobacter within the Enterobacteriaceae, initially comprising four named species in 2007. The taxonomy was expanded to five named species in 2008, and more recently (2011) to seven named species. Free full text The initial four named species in 2007 were Cronobacter sakazakii (comprising two subspecies), C. turicensis, C. muytjensii and C. dublinensis (comprising three subspecies) plus an unnamed species referred to as Cronobacter genomospecies I. The taxonomy was revised in 2008 to include a fifth named species C. malonaticus, which in 2007 had been regarded as a subspecies of C. sakazakii. In 2012, Cronobacter genomospecies I was formally renamed Cronobacter universalis, and a seventh species was described called Cronobacter condimenti. Etymology The first documented isolation of what would become known as Cronobacter sakazakii was from a can of dried milk in 1950, although these organisms have likely existed for millions of years. In 1980, John J. Farmer III, proposed the name Enterobacter sakazakii for what had been known as \\"yellow-pigmented E. cloacae\\", in honor of Japanese bacteriologist Riichi Sakazaki. Over the next decades, E. sakazakii was implicated in scores of cases of meningitis and sepsis among infants, frequently in association with powdered infant formula. In 2007, the genus Cronobacter was created to accommodate the biogroups of E. sakazakii, with C. sakazakii as the type species. The genus was named for Cronos, the Titan of Greek myth, who devoured his children as they were born.

The road is part of a long multi-state route that also goes through Georgia and South Carolina. Route description Beginning in Lebanon Station at a channelized intersection with US 19/US 98 and County Road 336 (CR 336) in Levy County, SR 121 travels through Goethe State Forest where it turns east and intersects CR 337\\\\. The road makes a sharp left curve to the northeast where it travels through desolate farmland; the only resemblance to a major intersection is CR 326\\\\. Within the city of Williston, SR 121 has a concurrency with CR 316, until the intersection with US 41\\\\. It then joins US 41 as CR 316 continues eastward, which then joins the east end of US 27 Alternate (US 27 Alt.), and then the US 27/US 41 concurrency before breaking away to the northeast again, taking the DeSoto Trail away from US 41\\\\. North of CR 335, SR 121 hugs the west side of the Levy‚ÄìMarion county line, but never crosses it, choosing to enter Alachua County instead. Immediately after the interchange with Interstate 75 (I-75) at exit 382, SR 121 makes a sharp left onto Northwest 34th Street as SR 331 becomes the designation for Williston Road. As it crosses SR 24 it borders the University of Florida to the east until crossing SR 26A and then SR 26\\\\. North of US 441, the DeSoto Trail breaks away. After the intersection with CR 236 in Santa Fe, SR 121 is carried along bridges across the former Seaboard Coast Line railroad line to Crystal River 3 Nuclear Power Plant and Santa Fe River in Worthington Springs, where it intersects SR 18\\\\. Briefly traveling parallel to SR 100 in Lake Butler, it intersects SR 100 as it continues northeast. The road also intersects SR 16 in Raiford, and I-10 and US 90 in Macclenny close to SR 228 before crossing the Georgia state line on its way to South Carolina. History State Road 23 was defined in the 1945 renumbering as: * From a point on SR 20 and SR 25 approximately northwest of Paradise in a northwesterly direction to the intersection with SR 235 in LaCrosse and along SR 235 for approximately , then continuing northwesterly via Santa Fe to a junction with SR 18 at Worthington Springs and along SR 18 to a point approximately north of Worthington Springs, then northeasterly to a junction with SR 100 in Lake Butler and East on SR 100 to a point near the eastern city limits of Lake Butler then northeasterly via Raiford to a junction with SR 10 in Macclenny and along SR 10 to 5th Street then in a northerly direction along 5th Street to the St. Mary's River at the Georgia state line. Prior to the renumbering, this had been: * SR 99 from northwest of Paradise to Worthington Springs * SR 113 from northwest of Paradise to LaCrosse * SR 49 from Worthington Springs to Georgia At some point, SR 23 was renumbered as part of SR 121, probably to match Georgia State Route 121. Before that, however, SR 23 had been extended around the west side of Gainesville to end at US 441/SR 25 at Rocky Point, and the southernmost part did not become part of SR 121\\\\. It was later given to the county, and has a possibility of becoming County Road 23. The State Road 23 designation has since been reused for a partial beltway around Jacksonville. Major intersections County Road 121A County Road 121A is the sole suffixed alternate of SR 121 that exists within the State of Florida. It is a former segment of SR 121 that exists entirely in LaCrosse.

Themes  Endicott and his Puritan followers suppress freedom and individuality, a common theme for Hawthorne. At the beginning of the story \\"jollity\\" and \\"gloom\\" are said to be contending for an empire, the Merry Mount colonists personifying jollity or mirth and the Puritans being the emblems of gloom. Hawthorne satirizes both parties and the narrative point of view seems to oscillate between them. It is perhaps worth noting that Hawthorne chooses to use \\"jollity\\", \\"mirth\\" and \\"gloom\\" and not \\"joy\\", \\"woe\\" or \\"sadness\\". Real joy, Hawthorne seems to be saying, arises spontaneously out of contrasts. The only time he mentions it is when the youth and maiden suddenly realise that their mirth is visionary and that by truly loving they had subjected themselves \\"to earth's doom of care and sorrow, and troubled joy, and had no more a home at Merry Mount\\". The youth and maiden go from being Merry Mounters to, presumably, becoming members of the Puritan community. In this sense it is not clear whether Hawthorne actually sides with the Puritans or the Merry Mount people, or if he is trying to find some middle ground. By his ambiguous point of view and use of allegory, Hawthorne seems to be trying to focus the readers' attention on the fact that certain aspects of the American past were already shrouded and obscured by myth. It is not too difficult to see the Merry Mounters as the precursors of hippies (Beats, or, perhaps, more accurately free thinkers) or the Puritans as the archetype of the establishment. Hawthorne goes against the tradition of casting America as a promised land where people came to act out their daydreams or to possess it by portraying both the Puritans and the Merry Mounters as a persecuted minority who sought refuge in the new land. Being a descendant of the earliest arrivals who were seeking freedom over 200 years before, Hawthorne must have known well the stories that typically lie behind official tales, such as those that we find from William Bradford, John Endicott, John Winthrop, and others. His insight about the interplay of personal freedom and family, or civic, responsibility continues to resonate today. As Nathaniel knew then, these matters of choice, such as whether 'strong watter' leads, by necessity, to debauchery or not, are perpetual issues readdressed with each generation. And he is critical of Merry Mount, suggesting that the Puritan critique of feckless pleasure-seeking has substantial truth, even if the Puritans themselves are a little heavy-handed. Stage adaptations The American poet Robert Lowell adapted this story into one of the three plays in his trilogy The Old Glory, first produced by the American Place Theatre in New York City in 1964. Lowell's version combines parts of this story with another Hawthorne short story, \\"Endicott and the Red Cross,\\" and with sections from the early American colonist Thomas Morton's book New Canaan. Howard Hanson's opera Merry Mount is loosely based on the story.

He has since published widely on Church reform, the rights of ethnic and sexual minorities, and plain language. Biography Born in 1934 in Long Beach, California, William H. DuBay attended public and Catholic schools before entering Los Angeles College Junior Seminary at the age of 13. After graduating and attending St. John's Major Seminary in Camarillo, California, he was ordained for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles in May 1960. While stationed in a segregated white section of San Fernando Valley, DuBay became very interested in the civil rights movement. After publishing a Sunday newsletter calling on Catholics to support integration, he was disciplined and sent to a racially mixed parish in Compton, CA. While there, he attempted to organize other priests who also had been disciplined to protest the Cardinal's racial policies. In June, 1964, he sent a cable to Pope Paul VI asking him to remove Cardinal McIntyre from office as Archbishop of Los Angeles for \\"conducting a vicious campaign of intimidation against priests, nuns, and lay Catholics\\" supporting the civil-rights movement. DuBay wrote, \\"His Eminence has condemned direct action demonstrations on the grounds that they incite violence. But as a matter of fact he has contributed to the possibility of serious racial violence by depriving civil rights groups of responsible Catholic and clerical leadership necessary to encourage Christian forms of nonviolent protest. His inaction has promoted the prolongation of Negro grievances by failing to mobilize the Catholic population against the social evils of segregation.Cogley, John (August 22, 1965) \\"Religion: Churchmen on Riots.\\" New York Times. p. E5. There was massive attention to the incident in the secular and religious press. Daniel Callaghan wrote in the June 26 Commonweal: \\"While it is open to doubt whether ‚Äòremoval‚Äô of a Cardinal is the way to solve such problems, it is a shame that a priest should feel compelled to castigate his Ordinary in public. Only on the rarest of occasions should he actually do so. I think Los Angeles, 1964, is one of those occasions.\\" On July 10, Commonweal devoted a whole issue to Catholicism in Los Angeles. The editors wrote: \\"It is as if the Los Angeles hierarchy constituted a Church unto itself, free to chart its own course, free to abuse the rights and duties of its clergy, free to make light of the social teachings of the Church and free to leave its laity in ignorance of the teachings of the Church universal and the Holy See.\\" In A Church of Silence, Al Krebs wrote the background story of the Cardinal's delivering his church to extremist right-wing elements. In The DuBay Case, John Leo wrote about betrayal felt by the Catholic Negroes of Los Angeles who \\"have to struggle to see in the Archdiocesan position something other than outright hypocrisy.\\" DuBay was again reassigned, first to St. Boniface Church in Anaheim and then to serve as chaplain at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica. In February 1966, DuBay was suspended from the priesthood on the occasion of publishing The Human Church, which called for democratizing the Catholic Church. It recommended that the people elect bishops for limited terms. It called for abandoning the parochial school system in favor of programs that teach Catholics the principles of Christian action. The book argued that the Catholic Church should abandon its tax exemptions and let individual congregations create their own liturgies and creeds. Citing DuBay's \\"public expressions of insubordination\\" and a lack of the bishop's imprimatur, the Vatican ordered DuBay to cease selling and distributing his book. DuBay protested that \\"prior censorship is a ghost that has been hovering around the Catholic Church since the Spanish Inquisition\\" and refused to stop distributing The Human Church.Editors (August 19, 1966) \\"The Issue of Imprimatur.\\" Time. In 1968, DuBay married Mary Ellen Wall of Seattle.Editors (August 11, 1968) \\"Suspended Priest Marries Divorcee.\\" New York Times. p. 38. They had a child, Alfred Zarubica. In 1971, DuBay moved to Seattle, where he worked two years in a residential treatment center and another two years managing a health-food store. In 1975, he moved to Ninilchik, Alaska, where he lived on a homestead for two years. From 1977 to 1985, while working for the Mayor's Office of the North Slope Borough, he published the Arctic Coastal Zone Management Newsletter and The Arctic Policy Review, both monthly publications that covered arctic-resource conflicts between the multinational oil firms and local Inupiat Eskimos. Beginning in 1985, DuBay worked for the health program of the non-profit Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association. In 1987, he returned to southern California, where he worked as a technical writer, first for Ashton-Tate and then for Phoenix Technologies. During that time, he published Gay Identity: The Self Under Ban, a sociological study of the homosexual role. In 2001, he retired from technical writing to become a plain-language consultant. In 2003, he began publishing The Plain Language at Work Newsletter. He has since self-published on Amazon three books on plain language: The Principles of Readability, Smart Language: Readers, Readability, and the Grading of Text, and Unlocking Language: The Classic Readability Studies. DuBay also is the author of a blog, Civic Language: Comments on Current Events and Building Social Capital. On that page is a three-part essay, The Roots of the Holocaust, about the youth of Adolf Hitler in Austria. in 2016, DuBay self-published on Amazon ‚ÄúThe Priest and the Cardinal: Race and Rebellion in 1960s Los Angeles,‚Äù a memoir about his conflict with Cardinal McIntyre over the Civil Rights Movement. Many of DuBay's papers concerning this conflict with can be found in the Special Collections of the Doheny Library of the University of Southern California.

She founded a night school in Preston called St Peter's School, aimed at educating women and girls. Later she became a prominent activist, and was incarcerated seven times and committed several acts of arson. She was a contemporary of Christabel and Sylvia Pankhurst. Biography Born Edith Rayner on St Luke's Day (18 October) in 1872 in Preston, Lancashire, she was one of seven children of Dr Alexander Clement Rayner and was educated at Penrhos College in North Wales. She married Dr Charles Rigby and lived with him in Winckley Square in Preston. From an early age she questioned the differences between working-class and middle-class women and after she was married she worked hard to improve the lives of women and girls working in local mills. In 1899, she founded St Peter's School, which allowed these women to meet and continue their education which otherwise would have stopped at the age of 11. At home, she was critical of her neighbours' treatment of their servants. The Rigbys had servants themselves, but allowed them certain unconventional freedoms such as being able to eat in the dining-room and not having to wear uniforms. =Activism= In 1907 she formed the Preston branch of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). Rigby was a suffragette recruiter, gathering new members from among the local Independent Labour Party, including Eleanor Higginson, who became a lifelong friend. Rigby took part in a march to the Houses of Parliament in London with Christabel and Sylvia Pankhurst in 1908. Fifty-seven women, including Rigby, were arrested and sentenced to a month in prison. During this time (and her subsequent sentences, seven in total) Rigby took part in hunger strikes and was subjected to force-feeding. Her activism included planting a bomb in the Liverpool Corn Exchange on 5 July 1913, and although it was later stated in court that ‚Äòno great damage had been done by the explosion‚Äô, Mrs Rigby was found guilty and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment with hard labour.Mrs Rigby committed to trial, The Times, 18 July 1913, page 14, column c.‚ÄòThe Explosion At Liverpool Exchange‚Äô, The Times, 31 July 1913, p. 8. Rigby had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU. She also claimed to have set fire to the bungalow of Sir William Lever, Bt (later Lord Leverhulme) on 7 July 1913.Rivington Bungalow Fire, Confession by a Doctor‚Äôs Wife‚Äô, Bolton Evening News, 13 July 1913, p. 4 The property, near Rivington Pike on the West Pennine Moors, contained a number of valuable paintings and the attack resulted in damage costing ¬£20,000. Afterwards she said: Rigby disagreed with the WSPU's decision not to campaign on suffrage issues during World War I. She joined the Independent Women's Social and Political Union split, forming a branch in Preston. =Later life= Edith Rigby plaque in Winckley Square, Preston, featuring incorrect year of death According to Elizabeth Ashworth in Champion Lancastrians, in 1888, Rigby was the first woman in Preston to own a bicycle. During World War I, she bought a cottage near Preston named Marigold Cottage and used it to produce food for the war effort. With short hair and wearing men's clothes, she grew fruit and vegetables and kept animals and bees, following the teachings of Rudolf Steiner. She had a happy marriage with her husband, who lived with her at her cottage. They adopted a son called Sandy. In the 1920s, Rigby was a founding member and the president of the Hutton and Howick Women's Institute. In 1926, Charles Rigby retired and the couple built a new house, called Erdmuth, outside Llanrhos, North Wales. Charles died before it was finished, however, and Edith moved there alone at the end of 1926. She continued to follow Steiner's work, forming an \\"Anthroposophical Circle\\" of her own, and visiting one of his schools in New York. Into old age she enjoyed a healthy lifestyle, bathing in the sea, fell walking and meditating in the early hours of every morning. She eventually suffered from Parkinson's disease and died in 1950 at Erdmuth.

Early life and education Bradley was born in Oakland to Kathryn Lee Culver, an author and artist, and Dwight Jaques Bradley, author and Congregational Church leader. He was raised in El Paso, Texas, Webster Groves, Missouri, and Newton Centre, Massachusetts. In 1947, he married Paula Anne Elliott, later a New Hampshire State Representative (1992‚Äì98; 2000‚Äì02). He received his B.A. from Oberlin College (1941), B.D. from Andover Newton Theological School (1950), and Ph.D. from University of Edinburgh, Scotland (1949). He was a Sergeant in the United States Army Air Corps in World War II (1942‚Äì45), serving in the South Pacific.  Career  A fifth-generation ordained minister in the Congregational Christian Churches (later merging to become the United Church of Christ), he served as a Professor at Hartford Seminary from 1950-1966. He was a visiting Professor at Thammasat University in Bangkok, Thailand for the last three years of his tenure at Hartford. In Bangkok, he served on the field staff of The Rockefeller Foundation and researched his ancestor, the Dr. Dan Beach Bradley, the first medical missionary to Siam and court physician to Siam's King Mongkut and his son, King Chulalongkorn. After his time at Hartford, Bradley took a position at the Rockefeller Foundation as Associate Director for the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences, from 1966‚Äì1971, and was then President of the Edward W. Hazen Foundation in New Haven, Connecticut from 1971-1984. At The Rockefeller Foundation, he was particularly proud of his work assisting emerging playwrights and theatres in the heydey of the Off-Off- Broadway theatre movement in New York City in the late 1960s and early 1970s, assisting such emerging talents as playwrights Julie Bovasso, Maria Irene Fornes, John Guare, Sam Shepard, Ron Whyte, and Lanford Wilson, as well as theatres such as the artistic leadership of producers such as Ellen Stewart (La MaMa Experimental Theatre Company or LaMaMa, E.T.C.), Joseph Papp (New York Shakespeare Festival - The Public Theater), Wyn Handman (The American Place Theatre), Joe Cino (Caffe Cino), and the theatre at St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery. His theatre involvement continued in the 1980s when he served as Chair of the Board of Circle Repertory Company in New York City. As President of the Hazen Foundation, he was known for taking creative philanthropic risks by providing crucial seed funding for innovative programs and organizations that often later attracted substantial funding from larger foundations. The reach and influence of the Hazen Foundation under his leadership, therefore, was amplified well beyond the value of the grants awarded. While in Connecticut, Bradley also served on the Governor's Commissions on Human Services; Libraries; and Equity and Excellence in Education. Following his retirement from the Hazen Foundation, which he continued to serve as President Emeritus, William and Paula moved to Randolph, New Hampshire, where both became active in that community. Bradley co-founded and served as the first editor of the Mountain View, a quarterly news magazine in Randolph, served as President of the Randolph Foundation from 1991‚Äì1996, and continued his lifelong activity in Democratic Party politics on the local and statewide level.  Publications  Bradley was the author of many articles and several books, including P.T. Forsyth: The Man and His Work, The Meaning of Christian Values Today, Introduction to Comparative Religion, and Siam Then: The Foreign Colony in Bangkok Before and After Anna. He was the coauthor of Thailand: Domino By Default? He remained active in ministry throughout his career, performing weddings and funerals for several generations of friends and family in the several communities he and Paula called home.

It studies the nature and strength of adhesion to dental hard tissues, properties of adhesive materials, causes and mechanisms of failure of the bonds, clinical techniques for bonding and newer applications for bonding such as bonding to the soft tissue.The Journal of Adhesive Dentistry: Online Introduction There's also direct composite bonding which uses tooth-colored direct dental composites to repair various tooth damages such as cracks or gaps. Dental bonding is a dental procedure in which a dentist applies a tooth-colored resin material (a durable plastic material) and cures it with visible, blue light. This ultimately \\"bonds\\" the material to the tooth and improves the overall appearance of teeth. Tooth bonding techniques have various clinical applications including operative dentistry and preventive dentistry as well as cosmetic and pediatric dentistry, prosthodontics, and orthodontics. History Adhesive dentistry began in 1955 with a paper by Dr. Michael Buonocore on the benefits of acid etching. Technologies have changed multiple times since then, with generally recognized generations established in the literature. Dental bonding agents have evolved from no-etch to total-etch (4th- and 5th-generation) to self-etch (6th- and 7th-generation) systems.De Munck J, Van Landuyt KL, Peumans M, Poitevin A, Lambrechts P, Braem M, Van Meerbeek B. A critical review of the durability of adhesion to tooth tissue: methods and results. J Dent Res 2005;84:118-132. The evolution of products improved convenience and reduced sensitivity to operator errors. However, the best bonding and longevity was achieved with 4th generation agents (having separate etch, prime, and bond steps). All in one self-etch adhesive and a single component universal adhesive by Kerr, both used in the adhesion of direct and indirect dental restorations Irwin Smigel founder and current president of the American Society for Dental Aesthetics and diplomate of the American Board of Aesthetic Dentistry, was one of the first to broaden the usage of bonding by using it to close gaps between teeth, lengthen teeth as well as to re-contour the entire mouth rather than using crowns. Having done more extensive work on the process than any other dentist, Dr. Smigel lectures worldwide on aesthetic dentistry. In 1979 he published a guide to aesthetic dentistry entitled ‚ÄúDental Health/Dental Beauty.‚Äù In 2012, new dental universal adhesives are commercialized. The universal adhesives bond to all dental substrates, which include enamel, dentin, metal, porcelain, ceramic and zirconia, with a single application. The term ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù adhesive is not new. In fact, many early bonding agents were named or described as ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù adhesives, such as XP Bond-Universal Total-etch Adhesive (Dentsply), One-Step- Universal Dental Adhesive (Bisco). However, there is still not a definition of dental ‚Äúuniversal adhesive‚Äù. It is highly confusing what the term ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù means. In 2012, the term ‚Äúuniversal adhesive‚Äù has several definitions which may include:Christensen G. New universal adhesives (part I): are they better? Clinicians Report 2012;5(3): 1-4. a)Can be used in total-etch, self-etch, and selective etch techniques; b)Can be used with light-cure, self-cure, and dual- cure materials (without the separate activators); c)Can be used for both direct and indirect substrates; d)Can bond to all dental substrates, such as dentin, enamel, metal, ceramic, porcelain, and zirconia.  In orthodontic treatments  Bonding of orthodontic brackets to teeth is crucial to enable effective treatment with fixed appliances.

She was popularly known as Amai (Mother) in Zimbabwe. Early life Born Sally Francesca Hayfron in 1931 in the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana), then a British colony, Sally and her twin sister, Esther, were raised in a political family, which was part of the growing nationalist politics in the colonial Gold Coast. She went to Achimota School, then went on to university to study before qualifying as a teacher. She met her future husband, Robert Mugabe, in the Gold Coast at Takoradi Teacher Training College where they were both teaching, and went with him to Southern Rhodesia, where they were married in April, 1961 in Salisbury.Nyarota, Geoffrey. Against the Grain. Page 101-102 Exile and family A trained teacher who asserted her position as an independent political activist and campaigner, Hayfron demonstrated this activism as early as 1962 when she was active in mobilising African women to challenge the Southern Rhodesian constitution. She was charged with sedition and sentenced to five years imprisonment. Part of the sentence was suspended. In 1967, Sally went into exile in London, and resided in Ealing Broadway, West London; her stay in Britain was financed, at least in part, by the British Ariel Foundation.Source of finance and partial text of a letter to Harold Wilson given here (see also footnote 57 of that source) This was a charity founded in 1960. She spent the next eight years agitating and campaigning for the release of political detainees in Rhodesia, including her husband who had been arrested in 1964 and was to remain incarcerated for ten years. Their only son, Nhamodzenyika, who was born in 1963 during this period of detention and imprisonment, would succumb to a severe attack of malaria and die in Ghana in 1966. Mugabe was prevented from attending the burial of his son.Robert Mugabe and the Betrayal of Zimbabwe, Andrew Norman, McFarland, 2004, page 91 Her father died in 1970. The British Home Office attempted to deport her in 1970, but after her husband, still in prison, petitioned the British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, she was given British residency. Her case for residency was supported by two British Government ministers in particular: Labour MP Maurice Foley, and the Conservative peer Lord Lothian. With Robert Mugabe's release in 1975 and subsequent departure for Mozambique with Edgar Tekere, Sally rejoined her husband in Maputo. Here, she cast herself in the new role of a mother figure to the thousands of refugees created by the Rhodesian Bush War. This earned her the popular title Amai (Mother).Sally Mugabe; Wife of Zimbabwe President, Los Angeles Times, January 28, 1992 Return to politics In 1978, she was elected ZANU-PF Deputy Secretary for the Women's League. In 1980 she had to make a quick adjustment to a new and national role of the wife of Zimbabwe's first black Prime Minister. She officially became the First Lady of Zimbabwe in 1987 when her husband became the second President of Zimbabwe. She was elected Secretary General of the ZANU-PF Women's League at the Party's Congress of 1989. She also founded the Zimbabwe Child Survival Movement. Sally Mugabe launched the Zimbabwe Women's Cooperative in the UK in 1986 and supported Akina Mama wa Afrika, a London-based African women's organisation focusing on development and women's issues in Africa and the United Kingdom. Death and remembrance Sally Mugabe died on 27 January 1992 from kidney failure. Upon her death she was interred at the National Heroes Acre in Harare, Zimbabwe. In 2002, to mark the 10th anniversary of her death, Zimbabwe issued a set of five postage stamps, of a common design, using two different photographs, each photograph appearing on two of the denominations. She is remembered fondly with love and affection, as she is still considered the founding mother of the nation of Zimbabwe.

He died of malaria at the age of 50. He was born in Batavia sometime in 1684. For his education and training he was sent to the Netherlands. He graduated in Law at Leiden University on 1 April 1707. He returned to Batavia on the clipper Donkervliet and spent some time in Dutch Coromandel. He was among other things a district overseer in Sadraspatnam. He got into a fight with the governor of Coromandel, Adriaan de Visser, who accused Van Cloon of delivering bad quality goods. The government in Batavia sent Van Cloon back to the Netherlands, but he persuaded the Directors of the Dutch East India Company that de Visser was not to be trusted. Van Cloon was reinstated and he left for the Indies on 4 November 1719 on board the van de Huis te Assenburg as supercargo. In 1720, he became district chief at Negapatnam. In 1723, he became Governor of Dutch Coromandel. In 1724, he returned to Batavia to advise the Governor-General and in 1730, he became ‚ÄúRaad-ordinair‚Äù (chief advisor) of the Indies. On 9 October 1731 the Directors of the Dutch East India Company named Dirck van Cloon Governor- General of the Indies, to which he succeeded on 28 May 1732, following the disgrace of Diederik Durven. By 20 December 1733 van Cloon was asking to resign because of sickness. He died in the post, however, and it was not until after he had died that his successor took over. Van Cloon was involved in a stand-off with the nascent Swedish East India Company, but he resolved it amicably. Less happy was an insurrection of unemployed Chinese sugar plantation workers. This was caused by the collapse of the sugar market, due to over-production and government mishandling.

Web search queries are distinctive in that they are often plain text or hypertext with optional search-directives (such as \\"and\\"/\\"or\\" with \\"-\\" to exclude). They vary greatly from standard query languages, which are governed by strict syntax rules as command languages with keyword or positional parameters.  Types  There are three broad categories that cover most web search queries: informational, navigational, and transactional.Broder, A. (2002). A taxonomy of Web search. SIGIR Forum, 36(2), 3‚Äì10. These are also called \\"do, know, go.\\" Although this model of searching was not theoretically derived, the classification has been empirically validated with actual search engine queries.Jansen, B. J., Booth, D., and Spink, A. (2008) Determining the informational, navigational, and transactional intent of Web queries, Information Processing & Management. 44(3), 1251-1266. * Informational queries ‚Äì Queries that cover a broad topic (e.g., colorado or trucks) for which there may be thousands of relevant results. * Navigational queries ‚Äì Queries that seek a single website or web page of a single entity (e.g., youtube or delta air lines). * Transactional queries ‚Äì Queries that reflect the intent of the user to perform a particular action, like purchasing a car or downloading a screen saver. Search engines often support a fourth type of query that is used far less frequently: * Connectivity queries ‚Äì Queries that report on the connectivity of the indexed web graph (e.g., Which links point to this URL?, and How many pages are indexed from this domain name?).  Characteristics A list of search suggestions for a search query Most commercial web search engines do not disclose their search logs, so information about what users are searching for on the Web is difficult to come by.Dawn Kawamoto and Elinor Mills (2006), AOL apologizes for release of user search data Nevertheless, research studies appeared in 1998.Jansen, B. J., Spink, A., Bateman, J., and Saracevic, T. 1998. Real life information retrieval: A study of user queries on the web. SIGIR Forum, 32(1), 5 -17.Silverstein, C., Henzinger, M., Marais, H., & Moricz, M. (1999). Analysis of a very large Web search engine query log. SIGIR Forum, 33(1), 6‚Äì12. Later, a study in 2001 analyzed the queries from the Excite search engine showed some interesting characteristics of web search: * The average length of a search query was 2.4 terms. * About half of the users entered a single query while a little less than a third of users entered three or more unique queries. * Close to half of the users examined only the first one or two pages of results (10 results per page). * Less than 5% of users used advanced search features (e.g., boolean operators like AND, OR, and NOT). * The top four most frequently used terms were, (empty search), and, of, and sex. A study of the same Excite query logs revealed that 19% of the queries contained a geographic term (e.g., place names, zip codes, geographic features, etc.). Studies also show that, in addition to short queries (i.e., queries with few terms), there are also predictable patterns to how users change their queries.Jansen, B. J., Booth, D. L., & Spink, A. (2009). Patterns of query modification during Web searching. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology. 60(3), 557-570. 60(7), 1358-1371. A 2005 study of Yahoo's query logs revealed 33% of the queries from the same user were repeat queries and that 87% of the time the user would click on the same result. This suggests that many users use repeat queries to revisit or re-find information. This analysis is confirmed by a Bing search engine blog post telling about 30% queries are navigational queries http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2011/02/10/making- search-yours.aspx In addition, much research has shown that query term frequency distributions conform to the power law, or long tail distribution curves. That is, a small portion of the terms observed in a large query log (e.g. > 100 million queries) are used most often, while the remaining terms are used less often individually. This example of the Pareto principle (or 80‚Äì20 rule) allows search engines to employ optimization techniques such as index or database partitioning, caching and pre-fetching. In addition, studies have been conducted on discovering linguistically-oriented attributes that can recognize if a web query is navigational, informational or transactional. But in a recent study in 2011 it was found that the average length of queries has grown steadily over time and average length of non-English languages queries had increased more than English queries. Google has implemented the hummingbird update in August 2013 to handle longer search queries since more searches are conversational (i.e. \\"where is the nearest coffee shop?\\"). For longer queries, Natural language processing helps, since parse trees of queries can be matched with that of answers and their snippets. For multi- sentence queries where keywords statistics and Tf‚Äìidf is not very helpful, Parse thicket technique comes into play to structurally represent complex questions and answers.  Structured queries  With search engines that support Boolean operators and parentheses, a technique traditionally used by librarians can be applied. A user who is looking for documents that cover several topics or facets may want to describe each of them by a disjunction of characteristic words, such as \`vehicles OR cars OR automobiles\`. A faceted query is a conjunction of such facets; e.g. a query such as \`(electronic OR computerized OR DRE) AND (voting OR elections OR election OR balloting OR electoral)\` is likely to find documents about electronic voting even if they omit one of the words \\"electronic\\" and \\"voting\\", or even both.

It was directed by Howard Hawks, who also wrote the story. It stars James Caan, Laura Devon and Marianna Hill in a story about young stock-car racers trying to establish themselves and about the complicated romantic relationships in their lives. The title is from the RPM an engine could make on a tachometer before crossing the red line beyond the safety margin. Plot A racing team run by Pat Kazarian starts out with two drivers, Mike Marsh and Jim Loomis, but a crash at Daytona results in Jim's death. His girlfriend Holly McGregor arrives too late for the race and feels guilty for not being there. A young driver, Ned Arp, joins the team and also makes a play for Kazarian's sister, Julie. A third driver, Dan McCall, arrives from France and brings along girlfriend Gabrielle Queneau, but soon he develops a romantic interest in Holly. Arp is seriously hurt in a crash, losing a hand. Mike, meanwhile, doesn't care for Dan's ways with women and tries to run him off the track in a race, but Dan survives. He and Holly end up together, but Mike is consoled by Gabrielle. The movie is distinguished by the appearance of a 1965 Shelby GT-350 racing on the track, and one of the characters drives a 1965 Cobra Daytona Coupe as his street car. For Shelby enthusiasts, this is one of the few movies they appeared in.

Hawks said the film would feature \\"three old fashioned hot love stories about these racers and their girls. They have their own code. They kid about danger. They aren't tough guys but they talk awful rough. The picture will have something of a wartime feeling: on Friday night a girl doesn't know if a boy will still be alive on Saturday night.\\"Howard Hawks' Eagle Eye for Film Realism Scheuer, Philip K. Los Angeles Times 24 Jan 1965: b4. Hawks said he originally wanted to tell just the one story but then \\"suddenly it hit me. 'This is a lot of padding'. Today audiences are way ahead of us. So I added two more stories and now we tell so much more in a few scenes without having to lead up to them step by step. In other words, stripped of all the non essentials.\\" Hawks said that in his film \\"you don't care who wins the race; it's the people who count.\\" =Casting= Howard Hawks had enjoyed success discovering stars in the past (Lauren Bacall, Carole Lombard, George Raft) and decided to cast the film with six newcomers plus Charlene Holt and Norman Alden. He said it took five months to cast them. The six newcomers were Gail Hire, Mariana Hill, Laura Devon, James Ward, John Crawford and James Caan (though Caan had been in Lady in a Cage).

Mutchmor Public School opened under the name Mutchmor Street Public School taking its name from the adjacent Mutchmor Street, which was later renamed Fifth Avenue. The original portion of the school was built in 1895 making Mutchmor one of the oldest schools in Ottawa. Only two other schools built in Ottawa in the late nineteenth century remain, with nearby First Avenue Public School being one. Further additions were made to the school in 1911, 1920 and 2015. The building is officially designated as a heritage structure. The school is home to over 500 students from junior kindergarten to grade six. Mutchmor is a French Immersion Centre. Students typically attend Glashan Public School for their middle school years and Glebe Collegiate Institute for their high school years. In the 1990s Mutchmor was threatened with closure by the school board. Action by the local community ensured that Mutchmor stayed open, and enrollment is growing steadily. In 2005 Today's Parent magazine named Mutchmor one of the top 40 schools in Canada, highlighting how the school 'rose to the challenge'.

More generally, it is the difference between what people say and what people do. The phrase is associated with environmental geography, relating to attitudes and behaviors surrounding environmental issues. Numerous studies have reported an increase in global environmental concern, but have shown that environmental engagement is not adjusting in accordance. Debates surrounding the issue of the value- action gap have mainly taken place within environmental and social psychology and research is often based within cognitive theories of how attitudes are formed and how this affects individuals‚Äô behavior. Pro-environmental behavior is a term often used in the literature, which can be defined as behavior that consciously seeks to minimize the negative impact of one's actions on the natural and built world. Research on the factors that influence behavior, however, have received far less attention than institutional actors such as governments and industries. The research suggests that there are many internal and external factors that affect behavior and the reasons behind consumer choices. Therefore, it can be difficult to identify the exact reasons for why this gap exists. When purchasing a product for example, many attributes are assessed by the purchaser in order to make their decision such as; price, quality, convenience, and brand familiarity. These factors influence the reasons behind buying behavior and environmental considerations are often not taken into account, regardless of the attitudes people have regarding the environment. Overcoming this gap is of particular importance for environmental policies as finding ways to overcome it should increase the effectiveness of these strategies. This would lead to a fundamental shift in behavior towards the environment and individuals‚Äô use of natural resources, ensuring sustainable development and conservation of the environment. When considering the importance of individual behavior, it has been stated that national policies and major energy transformations often take decades to change locked- in infrastructure and institutions, but behavioral shifts have the potential to be more rapid and widespread. Additionally, individual behavior ultimately drives societal change via adoption of lifestyle changes and technologies, and support for environmental policies.  Development of the term  = Summary = Theories regarding reasoned action state how attitudes shape and influence behavioral intention, which in term shape actions. The theory of reasoned action states that behavioral intention is dependent on attitudes surrounding that behavior and social norms. This means that a person acts or behaves in a way that correlates to their attitudes towards that behavior. Therefore, a person's voluntary behavior can be predicted by his/her attitudes and values on that behavior. Homer and Kahle (1988) argue that attitudes influence behaviors and can explain the reasons behind human behavior. However, this is often not the case for actions related to environmental behaviors. According to Barr (2004), in recent decades, public support for environmental protection measures has grown. This has been fuelled by pressure groups, consumer groups, and even businesses. Furthermore, increased media coverage of environmental disasters has also resulted in a heightened concern of such issues. This was given a political boost by the publication of the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change. Therefore, people are more aware of environmental issues, such as global warming or climate change and it is often reported that many people have a high concern for environmental issues. For example, Dunlap (2002) used survey data which states that 54% of Americans agreed environmental protection was a key priority, even if economic growth was restricted. Furthermore, Banerjee and Solomon (2003) also argue that the general support for Ecolabels is high among the US public. With these studies in mind, it is expected that there would be an increase in pro-environmental behavior, such as recycling or limiting energy usage. However, a significant increase has not been reported. Thus, attitudes are not always a clear prediction of behavior, resulting in the ‚Äòvalue-action gap‚Äô. The decision- making process is hard to predict as positive attitudes are not followed by positive intentions, and what shapes behavior is a complex process. Even if values are high, few people take environmental actions which involve changes to their lifestyle and often environmental actions can be unrelated to particular concerns an individual may have. The result is that attitudes are not necessarily a clear determinant of behavior.  Application  Even though many support pro-environmental trade in principle, this is often not taken into consideration as a purchase criterion. Cohen and Murphy (2001) argue that for around 40% of consumers the environmental friendliness of a product will never be a factor in purchasing decisions regardless of positive attitudes towards ethical consumption. There are many studies which support the existence of a value-action gap. Mostly these can be found within the field of environmental geography. This gap has been illustrated by Lane and Potter (2007) who found a discrepancy between attitudes and behavior regarding the adoption of cleaner vehicles. They reported that those with a concern for the environmental impact of cars did not translate this into behavioral changes at the individual level. Thus, consumers stated intention did not reflect their actual behavior. This gap is also shown within the market share for environmental goods, as ethical consumerism is still relatively low. Vermeir and Verbeke (2006) point out that initiatives such as legally logged wood, often have market shares of less than 1%, which they argue is partly due to the value-action gap. Even well known, high-profile ethical products still have a small percentage of the market share. Ronchi (2006) reports that the global sales of Fairtrade were over US$83 million in 2003, yet the total value of Fairtrade sales accounts for little over 0.01% of global trade. Thus, consumers‚Äô buying behavior does not reflect their positive attitudes toward ethical products. Vermeir and Verbeke (2006) also found that there was an inconsistency between the positive attitudes consumer expressed towards sustainability and their behavioral patterns. They found that intentions to buy sustainable dairy products were low regardless of positive attitudes towards these products. They argue that environmental factors are only taken into consideration for a minority of consumers, which means these markets remain small and only attracting a particular niche of consumer. For the majority of consumers other factors are more significant than values relating to the environment when purchasing products. Therefore, positive attitude towards sustainable products are not followed by sustainable actions, contrary to the theory of reasoned action. However, they also found that people's perceptions of the availability of sustainable dairy products was low, which might explain why intentions to buy was low.  Key issues  The main issues surrounding the value action gap are described below: = Factors that affect behavior = The key issue is why people's attitudes often fail to materialize into actions. Many factors exist that lead to an individual's behavior, and therefore it is not just personal values that affect behavior. Moreover, people's values are not fixed and are negotiated, and sometimes contradictory. Thus, cognitive factors alone will not adequately explain environmental action. Blake (1999) argues that the relationship between attitudes and behaviors is moderated by the structure of personal attitudes themselves; and external or situational constraints. He argues that if attitudes are based on direct experience then they are more likely to be predictors of behavior and behaviors often result from social norms. Behaviors can also be restricted by external or situational constraints which refer to restrictions outside the individual's control, such as economic or political factors. There are many different theories regarding how consumers make decisions. These can be applied to try to explain why there is a value-action gap for some behaviors. For example, as Sammer and W√ºstenhagen (2006:188) point out microeconomic theory (consumer theory) states that, ‚Äúhumans make decisions that maximize their utility‚Äù. Therefore, if buying environmental products does not maximize an individual's utility then they will not purchase them, regardless of their attitudes towards these issues. Making decisions requires a comparison of the costs and benefits of alternative actions within a specific budget, rather than about certain values. Young et al. (2010) argue that the gap can be due to ‚Äúbrand strength; culture, finance; habit; lack of information; lifestyles; personalities; or, trading off between different ethical factors‚Äù (p 22). Moreover, time or convenience can often be the major determinant of consumer behavior, and therefore the value-action gap is understandable for environmental products, as other constraints are more dominant. This means other factors, such as price or quality, are still more important. Vermeir and Verbeke (2006) argue that consumers are passive with regard to sustainable consumption, and work within their budget rather than following their values . Furthermore, behavior is often based on habit and therefore values concerning the environment are usually not taken into consideration. People act impulsively and in ways that do not correspond to their declared evaluations and goals. Moreover, Chatzidakis et al. (2007) argue that consumers use neutralization techniques to justify pursuing their more selfish goals instead of purchasing environmental friendly products. Environmental values are usually less dominant in the decision-making process. Thus, the main motivation for actions is self-interest rather than altruistic. Therefore, this may account for the low market share of sustainable products. = Information deficit = The most effective means to overcome the 'value-action gap' is to translate environmental concern into pro-environmental behavior. This may be achieved through increasing information. Therefore, one key explanation for the discrepancy between attitudes and buying behavior is the lack of information on specific issues. Blake (1999) identifies that the core assumption regarding the value-action gap is that the main barrier between environmental concern and action is the lack of appropriate information. In models of behavior, information generates knowledge, which then shapes attitudes, leading to behavior. Eden (1996) argues that polices fail to understand the gap between information and action. She argues that understanding issues creates awareness and it is this understanding that is the cause of behavior. Hence, it is often considered that one of the most effective ways to encourage pro-environmental behavior is to highlight important facts relevant to the issues. This is referred to as the ‚Äòinformation deficit model‚Äô of behavior change, which is based on the assumption that providing knowledge about the consequences of certain actions, would lead to a change in behavior. Environmental education and new knowledge is one way in which these environmental messages can be delivered, and therefore filling the value-action gap with information could help towards a change public behaviors. Furthermore, Owens (2000: 1142) argues that ‚Äúif people had more information about environmental risks, they would become more virtuous‚Äù. Traditional thinking supported this idea that increased knowledge tended to encourage favorable attitudes which, in turn, lead to pro- environmental action. This relates to broader issues relative to methods of environmental governance. Attempts by government to affect public behavior have traditionally been based on increasing environmental awareness. Many environmental policies are based on this ‚Äòinformation deficit model‚Äô as policy-makers assume knowledge on certain issues will lead people to act in order to meet policy objectives. Owens (2000) points out that governments often aim to encourage action through big publicity campaigns and changing behavior. For example, the UK government's ‚ÄòAre You Doing Your Bit?‚Äô campaign which was launched in 1998 aimed to develop public understanding of sustainable development, and thus, to encourage a change in behavior of individuals. Additionally, many Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) campaign for increasing awareness, on the assumption that this will led to action. Some argue that to increase environmental action there needs to be educational marketing campaigns on the environmental issues to change people's attitudes towards these issues, and thus change their behavior. However, the effect of information on behavioral change is debatable. Different people will respond and interpret the same environmental information in various ways and sometimes it is interpreted in an opposite way to what is expected. Barr and Gilg (2002) argue that just increasing information will not lead to a behavior change that would close this gap, and information-intensive campaigns are likely to be unproductive. Due to the increased media attention surrounding environmental issues and organizations such as Greenpeace having a high profile, it could be argued that there is already a lot of information on these issues, and it is considered that general awareness on environmental issues is high. Sammer and W√ºstenhagen (2006) point out that while people may be aware of environmental issues, this does not necessarily mean that they play a major role in their actions. These findings suggest that the 'value-action gap' cannot be overcome simply by using an 'information deficit' model of individual participation. Increasing information does not itself guarantee action at the individual level and information campaigns intended to raise awareness are not as effective as some may suppose. This raises issues regarding the effectiveness of methods used by NGOs, whose activities generally involve awareness campaigns and the use of non-state market driven (NSMD) forms of governance which rely on consumers to create change. If attitudes are not translated into behavior then these methods are essentially flawed. This would suggest that other methods are more appropriate to encourage environmental action, such as regulation and economic incentives (taxes and grants). = Barriers to behavior = It is widely considered that many other barriers exist, besides a lack of information, which inhibit ethical behavior causing a value-action gap to exist. Retallack et al. (2007) identifies other barriers such as uncertainty, skepticism about the issue and distrust of national governments and organizations. Jackson (2005) uses the concept of ‚Äòbounded rationality‚Äô to explain how individuals‚Äô decision making processes are ‚Äòbounded‚Äô by psychological and environmental constraints. Blake (1999) points out that various models of behavior are flawed in that they fail to take into consideration the social, individual and institutional constraints. Various conditions and personal day-to-day responsibilities constrain actions that can be regarded as ethical. Blake identifies that this gap is not empty, but is filled with barriers that block the progress from environmental concern to environmental action. In his model, action is blocked by many factors intruding into the process, rather than just a lack of information. Thus, the cause of the value-action gap can be explained in terms of personal, social and structural barriers to action. Blake identifies three categories of obstacles that exist between the environmental concern and action: individuality; responsibility and practicality. However, which factors are important will vary for different individuals and environmental actions. Moreover, barriers often overlap and are combined which limits behavioral change. * Individual barriers refer to environmental concerns being outweighed by other conflicting attitudes. People may perceive themselves as the wrong type of person to carry out ethical actions or have a lack of interest in environmental issues, e.g. a divorce of position. * Responsibility barriers refers to the idea that people may not act, despite supporting environmental action, because they believe it is not their responsibility to help solve environmental problems. This is supported by Jackson (2005) who identifies that the acceptance of personal responsibility for one's actions, and their consequences, is the basis for the intention to perform a pro-environmental behavior. People may also not act because they possess a lack of trust for national governments and organizations which aim to tackle environmental issues., e.g. cynicism. * Finally, practical constraints prevent people from adopting pro-environmental action, regardless of their attitudes or intentions. These include lack of time, money, physical storage space (in the case of recycling), encouragement and pro-environmental facilities such as recycling and adequate public transport provision. Some people may also be physically unable to carry out some environmental actions, e.g. space limitations. Therefore, Blake argues that policies need to tackle these barriers, not just provide more information or recycling facilities.

Bosa is located in the southwest of Bogot√° and is the 8th largest locality and 9th most populated. This district is inhabited by lower class residents.  Etymology  The name of Bosa in Muysccubun means \\"enclosure of the one that guards and defends the cornfields\\". Etymology localities of Bogot√°  Geography  Bosa limits to the north with the Tunjuelo River and the Camino de Osorio neighborhood of the locality Kennedy. To the south Bosa borders the Autopista Sur separating it from the localitity of Ciudad Bol√≠var and the municipality of Soacha in Cundinamarca. To the east, Bosa borders the Tunjuelo River and the locality of Kennedy and to the west the Bogot√° River and the municipalities of Soacha and Mosquera. Besides being crossed by the Tunjuelo and Bogot√° River, Bosa also has numerous creeks and streams which include the Quebrada Limas, Quebrada Trompeta, La Estrella, El Infierno, Quiba, Calder√≥n, Bebedero and Aguas Calientes.  History  Church of San Bernardino, in the central park of Bosa. It is said that the fa√ßade was built in 1538 by Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada, Nicol√°s de Federman and Sebasti√°n de Belalc√°zar Bosa was once the site of an important Muisca village. During the Pre-Columbian era, the area was governed by caciques as part of the Muisca Confederation, among them and at the moment of the Spanish arrival; the cacique Techovita. Early in 1538, Bosa witnessed one of the most dramatic chapters in the history of the Muisca. The last zipa, Sagipa (also called Saquesazipa among other names), was hung by Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada when his subjects failed to fill up a room with the amount of gold the conquistadors asked as ransom for his freedom. At the same time, Cuxinimpaba and Cuxinimegua, or Cuxininegua, the legitimate heirs to the throne of Tisquesusa, the last independent Muisca ruler who had been assassinated in Funza in 1537 by Jim√©nez de Quesada's soldiers, were hanged. This way the conquistador put an end to the lineage of the Muisca rulers. In 1538, Bosa became a meeting place for Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada, Nikolaus Federmann and Sebasti√°n de Belalc√°zar during the Spanish conquest of the Muisca. The exact location of their encounter was marked with a stone cross, today located on the east side of Bosa's main square. The 4th article of the June 22, 1850 Law dissolved the resguardo for indigenous people, in an effort to drive them away from the villages. These process ended in 1886. On November 22, 1853, a battle took place in Bosa between the forces of Tom√°s Cipriano de Mosquera, Jos√© Hilario L√≥pez and Pedro Alc√°ntara Herr√°n against the forces of Dictator Jose Maria Melo, this became known as the Battle of Bosa. Until the mid 20th century, Bosa was a relatively small municipality formed by five neighborhoods and a population less than 20,000 people. The people dedicated to rural agricultural activities. By 1954, the government of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla annexed Bosa to the Special District of Bogot√°, which triggered a demographic expansion. Bosa then became a commuter town for Bogot√°. In the Colombian Constitution of 1991, Bogot√° was rearranged and became the Capital District in which Bosa formed the 7th locality. In 1992 and 2000, the Cabildos of Suba and Bosa were officially recognized by the Government of Bogot√° as stipulated in Law 89 of 1890. The Cabildo Mayor del Pueblo Muisca was founded on September 22, 2002 in Bosa.

The Real Football Factories was the first series, where presenter and actor Danny Dyer travelled the UK, meeting some of the more notorious football firms. In this spin-off series, Dyer goes international, meeting firms from across the globe. Dyer played the main character of Tommy Johnson, a main member of a fictional Chelsea firm in the 2004 film The Football Factory. In 'The Real Football Factories International', Dyer visits Turkey, Argentina, Italy, Croatia and Serbia, The Netherlands, Brazil, Poland and Russia. In late 2007, The Score in Canada started to broadcast these episodes along with \\"The Real Football Factories.\\" But with an altered soundtrack due to copyright issues. It was also shown on CNN and CNN International under the name The Real Soccer Factories International in 2008. Episode guide * Argentina * Brazil * Croatia and Serbia * Italy * The Netherlands * Poland * Russia * Turkey Episode 1: Turkey In the first episode, Dyer goes to Turkey, one of the more notorious countries for football violence, due to the passion of their supporters. The episode is shot mainly in Istanbul, where the countries two biggest clubs and fierce rivals are Fenerbah√ße and Galatasaray. Dyer meets two members of Fenerbah√ße's firm, Kill For You (KFY) and learns of one of their supporters, nicknamed Rambo, who once broke into Galatasaray's Ali Sami Yen Stadium with a Fenerbah√ße flag and a kebab knife. He then meets Alpaslan Dikmen(B:20.12.1965 - D:27.09.2008), the leader of Galatasarays UltrAslan Ultras group. Dyer speaks with them about their hatred of Fenerbah√ße; and also their hatred of English fans, which had been exposed in 2000 when two Leeds United fans were fatally stabbed in Istanbul at a UEFA Cup semi-final match against Galatasaray. Dyer then meets up with a few more of Fenerbah√ße's KFY, before they take him to the Fenerbah√ße vs Galatasaray derby match at the ≈û√ºkr√º Saracoƒülu Stadium. Fenerbah√ße win the game 2-1 and Galatasaray fans tear apart the away section of the ground. Dyer then goes to experience lower division football in Turkey in ƒ∞zmir, and meets the firms of the two main teams in the city. First he meets the G√∂ztepe A.≈û. team and travels with their 'Yali' firm to an away game. He then meets their arch-rivals Kar≈üƒ±yaka S.K., whose firm are run by godfather type figures, who bring the players and management over to the fans after the game to celebrate with them. Episode 2: Argentina In Argentina, Dyer travels mainly around the capital city, Buenos Aires, meeting firms from all across the city and province. Buenos Aires has the most football clubs in one city in the world. Rivalry and violence between fans is never far away. First is the Avellaneda derby (Club Atl√©tico Independiente vs Racing Club de Avellaneda), in the port town of Avellaneda in the Greater Buenos Aires (belonging to the Buenos Aires Province). This match was played in the stadium of Independiente (Libertadores de Am√©rica). Dyer is taken to the popular of the stadium, a stand said to be so crazy, that even the police will allegedly not enter it. Before the game, Dyer spoke with Pablo \\"Bebote\\" (Big baby) √Ålvarez, the leader of the Los Diablos Rojos (The Red Devils), the barra brava of Independiente; and entered to the stadium with him. Ten minutes into the game, the stand is jumping so much that the Independiente firm member Dyer is with takes them out of the popular and into a safer stand. Independiente take a 2-0 lead, and the Racing fans take matters into their own hands. The game is abandoned due to crowd trouble in the away section. We then meet members of Club Atl√©tico V√©lez S√°rsfield's firm, who take Dyer onto the pitch of their stadium and around the trophy room, something that Dyer would never get back home in his home country of England. Finally he meets Rafa Di Zeo, the leader of the La 12 firm from Boca Juniors. Dyer learns that firms are an integral part of the clubs in Argentina, and that it is very different from just the pre-arranged violence between sets of supporters in the English game. Episode 3: Italy Italy has a reputation for football violence, in part due to the Ultras culture. Dyer firstly travels to Turin, and meets the Drughi Ultras from Juventus. The Drughi are named after the Droogs in the cult film A Clockwork Orange. Dyer speaks with members of the Drughi about the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, and is told of Juventus fans hatred of all English football fans. Dyer then briefly travels to Bergamo in Lombardy, and meets a top member of Atalanta B.C.'s Curva Nord Ultras. Dyer then goes to Rome and attends the biggest derby in Italian football, the Derby della Capitale, between S.S. Lazio and A.S. Roma. The two teams share the Stadio Olimpico, with Lazio fans using the Curva Nord as their home stand, and Roma fans using the Curva Sud as their home stand. In the first half, Dyer stands in the Curva Sud with Roma's ultras, where before kick off, Roma legend Marco Delvecchio comes and greets the fans in the stand. At half time Danny goes round to the other side of the stadium to experience the derby from the Curva Nord with Lazio's Irriducibili ultras. Lazio end up winning the match 3-0, sparking wild celebrations in the Curva Nord. Episode 4: Croatia and Serbia In his trip to the Balkans, Dyer visits both Croatia and Serbia who fought one of the bloodiest wars in recent European history. A war which some believe began with the riot between fans of (Croatian club) Dinamo Zagreb and (Serbian club) Red Star Belgrade in May 1990. In Croatia he attends the biggest derby in their footballing calendar, Hajduk Split vs Dinamo Zagreb in Split. He then sets off on a road formerly known as the Highway of Brotherhood and Unity into Serbia, where he gets rejected by Red Star Belgrade's fans Delije who refuse to appear on the programme, but manages to meet Partizan Belgrade‚Äôs hardcore Grobari (the Grave Diggers) ultras. Dyer is also on hand for the Belgrade derby between FK Partizan and Red Star, both the football as well as the basketball one. Episode 5: The Netherlands The Dutch are famous for their tolerant culture and liberal attitude to sex and drugs. Dyer begins his journey in Amsterdam, where he takes in the cosmopolitan life of the capital. But Danny soon learns that the Netherlands has a dark underbelly as he starts his journey into its fierce and secretive hooligan culture. Whilst in Amsterdam he has a secret meeting with the F -Side Firm of AFC Ajax. He learns about Ajax‚Äôs long-standing rivalry with Feyenoord hooligans from Rotterdam which has seen bombings and even murder. He then travels to Rotterdam, where he experiences De Klassieker (The Classic) derby, Feyenoord against Ajax ‚Äì the biggest game in Holland. We see how drugs and weapons have fueled their rivalries, which have seen the firms battle around the football ground and even at clubs and raves. Dyer then travels to The Hague to find out how the rivalries have intensified with arson attacks and the difficulties the police have in controlling the spread of hooliganism. Because he has earlier talked with Ajax, ADO Den Haag supporters would not talk to him. His final destination is Utrecht, where he finds out about the hooligans' power and influence within clubs. He meets the Utrecht firm who have a base within the football club. It becomes apparent that many of the firms are deeply embedded in the clubs, and violence has become a part of Dutch culture. Episode 6: Brazil Brazil is considered one of the most violent societies in the world, a society with a high murder rate. Brazilian football is rife with passion and brutality. In Rio de Janeiro Dyer visits the Ra√ßa Rubro Negra, a Torcida group from Flamengo. He learns that in Brazil the firms are waging war, with guns and shootings commonplace and visit her main rival the For√ßa Jovem do Vasco group from Vasco da Gama. In Porto Alegre he meets one more torcida group, Geral do Gr√™mio of Gr√™mio, and he attends a game between the team and Flamengo. In S√£o Paulo he meets the torcida group, Mancha Verde (Green Stain) of Palmeiras who he travels with to Rio de Janeiro. During the trip gun violence is experienced first hand as they come under fire from a rival group from Botafogo. In S√£o Paulo he also meets Gavi√µes Da Fiel, which is the biggest firm in Brazil and a Corinthians supporter.  Episode 7: Poland  During this film Dyer visits Poland, a country which has been saddled with the yoke of oppression throughout its history. At the beginning of his journey, he heads to Gda≈Ñsk where he meets Lechia's supporters Chuligani Wolnego Miasta - a firm that helped to abolish the communist regime. He then travels on to Krak√≥w to sample The Holy War (pol. ≈öwiƒôta Wojna) - the Krak√≥w derby between Cracovia and Wis≈Ça. First he meets one of Cracovia hooligans groups - Anty Wis≈Ça, later he meets Sharks (main of Wis≈Ça's hooligans firm). On October 28, 2006, Danny experienced what The Holy War really is. In the stadium, a fight broke out between Cracovia hooligans and the police. During the 18 months leading up the derby, eight fans have died due to football-related violence in Krak√≥w, a city also ominously known, in hooligan circles, as The City of Knives. Dyer wanted to talk with two main groups of Polish ultras - Legia's TB'95 and Lech's LPH, but they refused to meet with him on television. Danny leaves Poland reflecting on a country whose football violence problem appears to be stuck in a 1980s time warp.  Episode 8: Russia  In Russia, Dyer visits Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Whilst in Moscow it quickly becomes apparent that it is a city which is out of the ordinary. Moscow has its own rules, and beneath its exterior it becomes apparent that anything goes. He meets Vasilli the Killer the leader of Spartak Moscow's Gladiators firm. Whilst in Russia his fame from the film, Football Factory precedes him when outside a game he is mobbed. He learns that the CSKA Moscow (Gallant Steeds Firm, leader - \\"CashPoint\\") and Spartak firms went to watch the film together in the same cinema, and to celebrate they took to the streets for a fight afterwards. He also meets a female hooligan, a unique experience on his travels around the world.

This group is considered the pioneer of Neue Deutsche Welle. History =The beginning= Kai Horn, one of the founder members, left the group suddenly before their first recording. The first single was recorded with the support of Chrislo Haas and Robert G√∂rl (both DAF members at the time). The recording of a jam session was carried out in an underground shelter using a cassette dictation machine. In 1979 the band released 1500 units of their debut single themselves. This was the start of Der Plan's own label \\"Warning Records\\", later known as \\"Ata Tak\\". Their early recordings are reminiscent of industrial sounds of the same period (e.g. early works of US band Chrome). =1980s= Kurt Dahlke aka Pyrolator (ex DAF) joined Der Plan a short time later. The group became more musical, clearly reducing the noisy elements of their songs. Their 1980 debut album Geri Reig still showed their experimental side. On this album, they strongly displayed their musical influences, which included The Residents and Throbbing Gristle. Some titles were kept deliberately \\"inaudible\\" by the members in order to explore the boundary of music. At the end of the year, they released the single Da Vorne Steht 'Ne Ampel which had a plausible melody. Der Plan thereby began to seek out a musical framework which would lead to their later style of \\"Electronic Schlager\\" (electronic hit song), or \\"Synthi Pop\\", as they called it themselves. The single became one of the first hit tunes of Neue Deutsche Welle, and the group received offers from major record companies. Der Plan decided to remain independent within their own label, although they accepted a partial contract with Teldec to re-release the single. The LP Normalette Surprise was released in 1981 where the group developed \\"electronic schlagers\\" further and finally fixed their own style. In 1982, Rainer Kirberg, the film director, made a film Die letzte Rache (The Last Revenge), for which Der Plan composed the soundtrack. The group not only provided the film music: Moritz R was partly responsible for the film's surrealistic scenic design, which resembled The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari-like German expressionism, whilst Frank Fenstermacher played a small role as an actor. The film was broadcast by ZDF as a part of \\"Das Kleine Fernsehspiel\\" series and received critical acclaim. The soundtrack emphasized the group's experimental side in a mixture of experimental sounds and plausible melodies as in preceding works. In 1984, Der Plan released two singles. Gummitwist did not achieve the expected high chart position, although it was released by a major label (WEA) and enabled the group to appear on ARD's music program '. Soon after that, the double single Golden Cheapos was released. It featured three instrumental tunes. The group subsequently released the video Japlan, after which they did a successful Japan tour. The LP entitled Japlan was quite successful in the Japanese market, but was never released in Germany. This LP work was re-released in CD in 2002. In 1985, the compilation album LP Fette Jahre (Fat years) was released in Germany. It contained well-known single tracks, outtakes, and remixes of previous works. The record sleeve shows an ironic picture of the band members disguised in homeless type clothing. A new album was released in 1987, entitled Es Ist Eine Fremde Und Seltsame Welt (It is a strange world). The title was taken from a famous quote of Blue Velvet by the cult director David Lynch. The sleeve is very eye-catching, as the wording and the main monochrome image are almost entirely in black. One song from this album 1 Mann, 1 Ball was later covered by Der wahre Heino. As CDs swept across the market, Der Plan decided to release their best album in CD. It was released in 1988 under the title of Perlen. =Breakup= Working for the label and record distribution activities over-shadowed the focusing on the band's music. Differences within the group about career priorities began in 1983, resulting in Moritz R leaving the label Ata Tak and moving to Hamburg. Since then Der Plan had changed from a full-time project to an occasional side-project of its members. Nevertheless, they released yet another album, entitled Die Peitsche Des Lebens in 1989, which was much less successful than their previous works. In 1992 Der Plan eventually split up. In 1993 the fake live album \\"Live At The Tiki Ballroom ...\\", which is confirmed as a studio album on their official website, was released. Its first edition was accompanied by a mini CD, which contained \\"techno versions\\" of well known Der Plan titles. Moritz R dedicated himself to painting after the group's break up. He chronicled his experiences as part of Der Plan in the book Der Plan - Glanz und Elend der Neuen Deutschen Welle (Der Plan - the Splendor and Misery of the New German Wave). Pyrolator and Frank Fenstermacher formed a trance project A Certain Frank later. They joined another German group, Fehlfarben in 2002. =Der Plan v4.0= Der Plan was formed again as Der Plan v4.0 in Berlin by Moritz R, Achim Treu and JJ Jones in 2003. The album Die Verschw√∂rung (The Conspiracy) was released in 2004. =Der Plan v5.0= In 2008 Der Plan was formed as Der Plan v5.0 within the online virtual world Second Life. The entirely virtual band played two gigs using scans of stage designs and masks from their real life in the early 1980s and was represented by the avatars Mo Eriksen, Moni Duettmann and Popeye235 Baxter. Musical Style Der Plan's musical style is a thing of much, and often heated debate. It has been referred to (in almost equal measures ) as \\"a work of Genius\\", and \\"the demented results of a kindergarten music project gone terribly wrong\\".

Early life Hvam was born in Kongsberg, Norway where he excelled at skiing as a youth, winning a ski jumping contest at the age of 12. He emigrated to Canada in 1923 before moving to Portland, Oregon, U.S. in 1927. Early Career and Competition In Oregon, Hvam co-founded the Cascade Ski Club in 1928 and soon established himself as a strong skiing competitor. On April 26, 1931, Hvam and two fellow members of the Cascade Ski Club, Arne Stene and Andr√© Roch, became the first to descend on skis from the summit of Mount Hood. In 1932, he won the first U.S. nordic combined championship held at Lake Tahoe, California, taking first in jumping and cross-country racing. Though originally a Nordic skier, Hvam soon became a competitive alpine skier as well, winning both runs of his very first slalom race at the 1933 Oregon state championships on borrowed skis. He continued to race competitively throughout the Pacific Northwest in the early 1930s, winning event at Mount Rainier and all four disciplines (ski jumping, cross-country, slalom, and downhill) on Mount Baker in 1936. He qualified for the 1936 U.S. Olympic team, but as a Norwegian citizen, could not compete, and did not want to compete in Hitler's Germany. In 1936, Hvam was the first winner of the nation's oldest ski race, the Golden Rose Ski Classic at Timberline Lodge ski area, and repeated his victory in 1937. Saf-Ski bindings Hjalmar Hvam displaying the mini-ski, another of his inventions. While celebrating his 1937 repeat victory in the Golden Rose, Hvam, like many skiers of his era, broke his leg. Hvam, who had been trained as a mechanical draftsman, had been working for years on a design that would reliably release a ski boot in a fall, but remain in place for normal skiing maneuvers. While laid up in the hospital, he had an inspiration for a new design, which became the Saf-Ski, the world's first ski safety bindings. The bindings made it to Europe for use by the 10th Mountain Division in World War II. After the war, the design caught on and became popular around the world into the 1960s. Hvam sold and rented thousands of pairs until the early 1970s, when insurance premiums for sale of the bindings became too expensive and the Saf-Ski disappeared from the market. Later years Hvam coached the U.S. Nordic combined teams at the 1952 Winter Olympics in his native Norway, where he found he could still outjump the athletes he coached. He continued to operate ski shops in Portland and on Mount Hood until he retired in 1962. He continued to ski recreationally into his mid-80s. He was inducted into the United States National Ski Hall of Fame in 1967, the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1992, and is a member of the Northwest Ski Hall of Fame and the U.S. Ski Business Hall of Fame. Hvam suffered a heart attack at his Beaverton home and died on March 30, 1996.

The purpose of the mission was to investigate \\"alleged Polish pogroms\\" and the \\"treatment of the Jewish people\\" in Poland. The mission consisted of three American members: former US ambassador Henry Morgenthau, Brigadier General Edgar Jadwin of Engineer Corps, and professor of law Homer H. Johnson from Cleveland; and from the British side Sir Stuart M. Samuel. They were selected to investigate accounts of mistreatment of Jews in the newly-reborn Second Polish Republic. The report by Morgenthau was published on October 3, 1919. The final report \\"denied the authenticity of the pogroms\\" but it noted \\"isolated excesses\\" of antisemitic nature, in which approximately 300 Polish Jews died, which it attributed to the chaos of the post war situation. It also cleared the Polish government of any role or support for the incidents, although it did chastise it for insensitivity with regard to Jewish issues, and suggested \\"culpable negligence\\". Morgenthau also criticized both Zionism and Polish nationalism as well as \\"widespread antisemitic prejudice\\" created by contemporary social and political conflicts. The report stated that the condition of Jews in Poland was not satisfactory and could be improved but also noted that the situation had been widely exaggerated. Morgenthau called for improvement in Polish-Jewish relations which required good willed people to stand up against \\"extremists on both sides\\". Popularly regarded as the definitive statement of the commission, in effect, it was a minority opinion released one month ahead of the joint Jadwin-Johnson deposition. The Jadwin-Johnson deposition agreed with the Morgenthau report that no pogroms had occurred, but it downplayed the criticisms of Polish government found in the previous report. It also blamed \\"German propagandists\\" for spreading the image of Poles as \\"barbarous anti- semites\\". History American public opinion was informed primarily by newspaper articles about the Jewish first-party accounts of mistreatment and atrocities committed against them in Eastern Europe during local conflicts such as the Polish-Ukrainian and Polish-Soviet wars which erupted in the aftermath of the World War I. In June 1919, Herbert Hoover, then head of the American Relief Administration (ARA), after discussions with Polish Prime Minister Ignacy Jan Paderewski, wrote to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson warning that the reports of atrocities were damaging the reputation of Poland, a nascent ally being cultivated by the U.S. to counter Soviet Russia. Hoover, whose ARA oversaw relief efforts in Europe, secured the support of Padrewski through blunt warnings that the reports of atrocities against Jews \\"could develop into a most serious embarrassment to all of us in connection with the relief of Poland.\\" Such pressure for government action reached the point where President Woodrow Wilson sent an official commission to investigate the matter. The Morgenthau commission was dispatched by the United States to verify those reports.Sonja Wentling. \\"The Engineer and the Shtadlanim: Herbert Hoover and American Jewish non-Zionists, 1917-28.\\" American Jewish History 88, 3 (September 2000): 377-406. Morgenthau's delegation was met by thousands of Polish Jews in Warsaw and other Polish cities it visited,Henry Morgenthau, All in a Life-time. French Strother. Doubleday, Page, and Company, 1922, p. 360. Original from the New York Public Library, digitized Jul 17, 2007. although Morgenthau ‚Äì an assimilationist, critical of Jewish nationalism ‚Äì was shunned by Polish Zionist leaders. While the Polish Jewish press gave the delegation a warm welcome, the non-Jewish Polish press response ranged from cool to overtly hostile with instances of open expressions of anti-Jewish hostility. The daily Robotnicza called for a complete boycott of Polish Jews, while the leading weekly Mysl Niepodlegla accused Wilson of siding against the Polish people in favor of Jews who \\"live upon usury, fraud, receiving of stolen goods, white slavery, counterfeiting and willful bankruptcy.\\" While Paderewski had welcomed the investigation, Morgenthau found hostility in other Polish political circles, especially from the camps of National Democratic Party (\\"Endecja\\") leader Roman Dmowski and his rival, Chief of State Jozef Pilsudski. Compared to Paderewski, who had substantial U.S. support, Pilsudski at the time was regarded as a less reliable military adventurer, and was described by Morgenthau as a \\"high-class pirate.\\"Neal Pease. Poland, the United States, and the Stabilization of Europe, 1919-1933. Oxford University Press US, 1986. Page 9. Pilsudski resented the interference of Morgenthau's mission in Polish affairs, although he was acknowledged as an opponent of the open anti-semitism of Dmowski and a leader committed to a liberal policy towards Jews and other minorities that respected their rights. Morgenthau immersed himself in meetings with representatives of all segments of Polish society from all sides of the dispute. He attended a packed service for the 35 Jewish victims of the Pinsk massacre of April 1919, noting afterward that \\"This was the first time I ever completely realized what the collective grief of a persecuted people was like.\\"Neal Pease. \\"'This Troublesome Question': The United States and the 'Polish Pogroms' of 1918-1919.\\" In: Mieczys≈Çaw B.

Ticknor & Fields, 1991. =Incidents identified= The Morgenthau report ultimately identified eight major incidents in the years 1918‚Äì1919, and estimated the number of victims at between 200 and 300 Jews. Four of these were attributed to the actions of deserters and undisciplined individual soldiers; none were blamed on official government policy. Among the incidents investigated by the Morgenthau mission was the Pinsk massacre. In Pinsk, a Polish officer accused a group of Jewish civilians who had gathered at a town meeting to discuss the distribution of American relief aid of being Bolsheviks and of plotting against the Poles. Thirty-five of the men were summarily executed. The Morgenthau mission issued a strong condemnation of the commander responsible: > While it is recognized that certain information of Bolshevist activities in > Pinsk had been reported by two Jewish soldiers, we are convinced that Major > Luczynski, the Town Commander, showed reprehensible and frivolous readiness > to place credence in such untested assertions, and on this insufficient > basis took inexcusably drastic action against reputable citizens whose loyal > character could have been immediately established by a consultation with any > well known non-Jewish inhabitant.Reproduced in: Henry Morgenthau, French > Strother.

It concluded that some forms of discrimination against Jews was of political rather than anti- Semitic nature, rooted in political competition. The report specifically avoided use of the term \\"pogrom,\\" noting that the term was used to apply to a wide range of \\"excesses,\\" (Morgenthau's preferred term) and had no specific definition. Tadeusz Piotrowski, noted that Morgenthau reasons for avoiding the word pogrom was based on the chaotic conditions existing within a war zone. Morgenthau noted that it would be unfair to condemn the entire Polish nation for the acts of renegade troops or mobs, and believed the attacks were not premeditated or the result of a preconceived plan. He noted, however, that \\"It is believed that these excesses were the result of a widespread anti-Semitic prejudice aggravated by the belief that the Jewish inhabitants were politically hostile to the Polish State.\\"Quoted in: Andrzej Kapiszewski, Controversial Reports on the Situation of the Jews in Poland in the Aftermath of World War Studia Judaica 7: 2004 nr 2(14) s. 257-304 (pdf) Jadwin and Johnson submitted their report separately from Morgenthau. As described by Sonja Wentling in an article for American Jewish History, Morgenthau emphasized that Jews had been deliberately murdered based solely on the fact that they were Jews, while Jadwin and Johnson concluded that the violence against Jews in Poland was largely rooted in Jewish separatism and commercial competition. Criticism Assessments of the mission's works varied, with supporters and critics alternately concluding that it had either debunked allegations of Polish anti-semitism or provided support for them. Hoover considered the mission as having done a \\"fine service,\\" while others considered its findings to be a \\"whitewash\\" of Polish atrocities. The possibility of bias in the Morgenthau report has been discussed by numerous scholars. Professor Andrzej Kapiszewski wrote that the report was influenced by U.S. foreign policy objectives at the time. Professor Neal Pease wrote, \\"To protect Poland's international reputation against widespread, if exaggerated, accusations of mistreatment of her large Jewish minority, Washington dispatched an investigatory commission led by Henry Morgenthau, one of the most prominent American Jewish political figures. Morgenthau was selected for the job precisely because he was known to be sympathetic to Poland, and his report largely exculpated the Polish government, exactly as expected.\\" Some contemporary responses in the Jewish press accused Morgenthau and Samuel, the Jewish members of the commission, of having presented a \\"whitewash\\" of the massacres, and charged them with being guilty of treason.

It was dedicated to Jos√© Vasconcelos, the philosopher and former presidential candidate and former president of the National Library of Mexico. The library is spread across 38,000 square metres (409,000 sq ft) and had an initial planned cost of 954 million pesos (roughly US$98 million). The Congress of Mexico proposed plans to reduce the budget of 2006 that included cuts for all three branches of government. National Action Party (PAN) presented an alternative budget that preserved funds for Enciclomedia and the Vasconcelos Library. The library is located in downtown Delegaci√≥n Cuauht√©moc at the Buenavista train station where the metro, suburban train, and metrobus meet. It is adorned by several sculptures by Mexican artists, including Gabriel Orozco's Ballena (Whale), prominently located at the centre of the building. History Then President of Mexico Vicente Fox inaugurated the library on 16 May 2006, and stated that this was one of the most advanced constructions of the 21st century, and that it would be spoken of throughout the world. This inauguration took place a week before the deadline the president had to promote his accomplishments before the 2006 presidential election. The library had to close in March 2007 due to construction defects. The Superior Auditor of the Federation detected 36 construction irregularities and issued 13 motions of responsibility for public servants of the federal government. Among the irregularities found was the misplacement of marble blocks at a cost of 15 million pesos (roughly 1.4 million dollars). During Calder√≥n's administration, efforts to restore it continued with a further investment of 32 million pesos (roughly US$3 million). It was reopened to the public in November 2008 after 22 months.

A mercenary and veteran of several wars, including the Xhosa and Crimean conflicts, he was assigned by the Ottoman military to Wallachia, where he later settled, becoming in time a supporter of the liberal current in Romania. He was an influential figure in local politics during the early 1870s, and a mediator between Ion BrƒÉtianu's government and the Porte at the start of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878. Lakeman is also noted for having introduced Eastern European fish species to England. Biography Born into a family of Dutch origins Kirson but settled in Devon where he was born at Dartmouth,Dod's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage of Great Britain and Ireland for 1894, Sampson Low, 1894, p.479 he was a graduate of the Lyc√©e Louis-le- Grand in Paris, France.Cernovodeanu, p. 40. Lakeman first saw action with the July Monarchy's armies resisting Abd al-Qadir's uprising in French Algeria. He later joined the British Army, left for the Cape Colony.Shaw, p. 350. A captain and commander of the Waterkloof Rangers in clashes with the Xhosa people, he was made a Knight Bachelor by Queen Victoria, during a ceremony at Windsor Castle (25 November 1853). According to his descendant Sybille Manu- Chrissoveloni, Lakeman had unsuccessfully tried to persuade British military officials to generalize the usage of khaki, replacing red coats in the standard uniforms; when his proposal was rejected, he established his own Waterkloof troops of volunteers (also known as the \\"Death Regiment\\"). An account of the formation of the Waterkloof Rangers appears in the historical novel Shark Alley: The Memoirs of a Penny-a-Liner by Stephen Carver. Soon afterwards, he opted to join the Ottomans in their Crimean-centered conflict with the Russian Empire, becoming a binba≈üƒ±, and later a pasha (becoming known under his Turkish pseudonym Mazar Pa≈üa). When Russian troops evacuated Wallachia, Lakeman, who was serving under Omar Pasha, was appointed to a command position in the region, becoming police chief in Bucharest (September 1854). This occurred as the two Danubian Principalities came under Austrian supervision, a measure which was meant to create a buffer area, while allowing for an Ottoman garrison to be maintained. Austrian troops in Bucharest, 1854 Lakeman kept close contacts with the Wallachian nationalist circles, clashing with the Austrian governor, Johann Coronini-Cronberg, and becoming the subject of the latter's complaints to Omar Pasha and to Stratford Canning, the British Ambassador in Istanbul. During the same period, he met Maria Arion, belonging to a mixed Romanian-Greek family, whom he married in 1856. In December 1854, Canning agreed to have Lakeman relieved from his post, and he was given instead military assignments on the Crimean front. As the war ended and Austrian troops withdrew, he returned to Bucharest and became the owner of several estates, establishing his main residence in a house next to Enei Church. In June 1857, Stephen Bartlett Lakeman met with Carroll Spence, the American Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, who was visiting Wallachia. Spence asked Lakeman to mediate between him and Wallachia's Kaymakam, Alexandru II Ghica, after being offended that the latter had failed to receive him upon arrival.Com≈üa, p. 45. Lakeman visited the Kaymakam, who agreed to meet with the diplomatic envoy and apologize for the lack of courtesy. Around 1864, on temporary return to England, he introduced there species of Wels catfish and tench, both native to the Danube basin.Buckland, p. 359.Wheeler & Maitland The Lakemans' house, also known to Bucharesters as Mazar Pa≈üa, remained an important landmark and meeting spot for political figures after the creation of a unified Principality of Romania. Starting in 1875, Stephen Lakeman was a supporter of the radical groupings inside the liberal trend, while his house hosted anti-Conservative meetings which involved, among others, Ion and Dimitrie BrƒÉtianu, Ion Ghica, Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu, Dimitrie Sturdza, C. A. Rosetti, Alexandru G. Golescu, and Nicolae Fleva. Negotiations between the moderate and radical faction resulted in the creation of the National Liberal Party, sealed by the so-called Coalition of Mazar Pa≈üa on 24 May 1875.Cernovodeanu, pp. 40-41. Shortly after the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878, he was present in Istanbul, as an unofficial representative of the Ion BrƒÉtianu cabinet.Kellogg, p. 142.Ozanne, p. 221. As Romania evaluated joining the Russian side in exchange for independence, Lakeman negotiated with Saffet Pasha, the Grand Vizier, arguing that the Bucharest authorities were to adopt neutrality and resist a Russian offensive in exchange for the official recognition of the name \\"Romania\\".Kellogg, pp. 142-43 He also called on the Ottoman Empire to offer assistance in the military effort.Kellogg, p. 143. Despite the secret character of the proceedings, the Romanian press published allegations that Saffet had agreed to the demands, and that it had made other sizable concessions to the BrƒÉtianu government. Nevertheless, the negotiations' only visible outcome was the pledge of Ottoman authorities in Dobruja to aid Romania in the likelihood of an invasion  this offer was ignored by BrƒÉtianu, who also opted to reject approaching the Russian side until, in April 1877, Romania declared war on the Ottoman Empire. According to memoirist James William Ozanne, who was visiting Romania during the period, Lakeman \\"made no secret of his disgust\\" in respect to the Russian-Romanian alliance. Following that moment, the pasha withdrew from political life, and returned to his native country.Cernovodeanu, p. 41. He died in Bucharest, in relative obscurity.Totnes Times and Devon News, issue 1644, 14 July 1900, p.5, col d Stephen Lakeman had three children with Maria: two sons, George (whose daughter, Georgeta Lakeman, married the banker Nicolae Chrissoveloni in 1941) and Dan (who settled in Argentina), as well as a daughter, Celia. George Lakeman was naturalized Romanian in 1906. In his March 2004 address to the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South African President Thabo Mbeki made ample mention of Lakeman's activities in the region. Quoting historian Noel Mostert, he indicated that the British commander had engaged in war crimes and atrocities: Lakeman was reported to have cut the throats of women and children prisoners with a sickle.Inaugural Albert Luthuli Lecture Additionally, Lakeman himself admitted that he ordered his men to boil the severed heads of Xhosa people \\"for scientific interest\\".Peires, p. 24.

An earthwork mound, built about 1000 CE, marks a ceremonial site here. The Cherokee identify Kituwa as one of the \\"seven mother towns\\" in their former homeland of the American Southeast. This site is in Swain County, North Carolina, in the Great Smoky Mountains. Present-day Bryson City was developed nearby by European Americans after the Cherokee were removed from the area in the 1830s. Kituwa was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 because of its significance. Since the mid-19th century, the term \\"Keetoowah\\" has been associated with Cherokee people, initially full-blood only, who supported a kind of religious nationalism. They adhered to pre-contact communal ways. Conservative descendants of Cherokee who had migrated to Arkansas and Indian Territory in the 1810s and 1820s later formed what is now the federally recognized tribe of the United Keetoowah Band. During the 19th century, after removal to Indian Territory, there were Cherokee groups that identified as Keetoowah, at times forming secret societies that maintained rituals and sacred ceremonies. History Kituwa is the site of an ancient earthwork mound, built by about 1000 CE. The Cherokee hold the site sacred. At the time of European encounter, the Cherokee regularly burned the vegetation on the mound for agricultural use. It may also have been part of ritual to preserve the mound, to keep it visible and free of trees. Burning underbrush was part of sustainable farming practices. After European Americans invaded the Cherokee Nation in the 1830s and forced their removal from the Southeast, they repeatedly plowed the mound area for corn cultivation. The mound is still visible although much shorter than it would originally have been. During the period of European-American uses, the mound was within the boundaries of a larger property called Ferguson's Field. The remaining mound is in diameter and five feet tall, although archeologists know that it was once taller. According to the Cherokee oral tradition, they had built a structure on top that housed their sacred flame, which was to be kept burning at all times.\\"Kituwah Mound, NC (Eastern Cherokee), 2004\\", The Pluralism Project, Harvard University, accessed 3 Mar 2009 People of several Woodland and Mississippian cultures frequently built earthwork mounds, and remains are evident throughout the Mississippi Basin and Ohio Valley. The area of moundbuilding by various cultures included Tennessee to the west, Georgia to the southeast, Louisiana to the southwest, and Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri to the northwest. The Mississippian culture is documented as established in what is now known as western North Carolina from 1000 CE.David G. Moore, Robin A. Beck, Jr., and Christopher B. Rodning, \\"Joara and Fort San Juan: culture contact at the edge of the world\\" , Antiquity, Vol. 78, No. 229, Mar. 2004, accessed 26 Jun 2008 Joara was a regional chiefdom in this culture, which Spanish explorers recorded encountering in the late 16th century. Additional Mississippian-culture sites have been identified extending southwest to the village later called Kituwa. The Mississippian-culture peoples were part of vast trade networks that connected chiefdoms throughout the present-day eastern United States, spanning the continent from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes. Archaeologists believe the people of the smaller chiefdoms were eventually absorbed by the developing, larger Catawba and Cherokee tribes. The inhabitants of Kituwah, known as the Ani-kitu-hwagi, influenced all of the towns along the Tuckasegee and Little Tennessee rivers. The people of this region became known as the Kituwah, also spelled Keetoowah. Because the Kituwah were responsible for the protection of the northern border from the Iroquois and the Algonquian peoples, the name became synonymous with the Cherokee among the people. Although the Cherokee language is of Iroquoian origin, this tribe is believed to have migrated long ago from the Great Lakes area, where the Five Nations of the Iroquois developed in the 14th or 15th centuries. The ancient site of the Mother Town Kituwa is visible in the general area of the Qualla Boundary, which has been recognized Cherokee territory again since the late 20th century (see below \\"reclamation\\"). During the Anglo-Cherokee War (1758‚Äì1761), British general James Grant used his army to destroy the ancient town of Kituwa. Its inhabitants migrated westward and settled in Mialoquo (Great Island Town) on the Little Tennessee River among the Overhill Cherokee. A later headman of this group was Dragging Canoe, son of Attakullakulla. When he led his warriors southwest to continue fighting the colonists of Upper East Tennessee, the entire population went with him, including those formerly of Kituwa.Klink, Karl, and James Talman, ed. The Journal of Major John Norton. (Toronto: Champlain Society, 1970), p. 62 In the 1820s the Cherokees lost control of the Kituwa area after making land cessions to the United States. =20th-century reclamation= The Cherokee people did not regain their \\"mother town\\" until 1996, when the Eastern Band of the Cherokee purchased the site and an associated . A 1997 archaeological survey of Kituwah found an early 18th-century village site covering . The density of artifacts indicated a long period of settlement.\\"Proposed Development of Kituwah 'Mother Town' of the Cherokee, Debated\\" , Cherokee Nations News, 20 Apr 2000 The Cherokee have debated how to use the land, with some people wanting to develop the property for community uses. Non-invasive archaeological surveys have revealed 15 burials, with the likelihood of up to 1000. A gradiometer was used to map the area. It also depicted the location of many hearth sites, including one at the center. This would likely have been associated with the sacred fire. With such discoveries, more Cherokee citizens believe that any development must be compatible with the sacred nature of the site. They are planning uses associated with community wellness and renewal. The Eastern Cherokee have sponsored two youth retreats at the site, which highlighted traditional ways of spiritual expression. =Duke Energy controversy= Duke Energy attempted to build a $52 million substation near the Kituwah Cherokee ceremonial mounds. Both Swain County and the Eastern Cherokee opposed this project; the county asked for a moratorium on such projects until it could consider zoning ordinances to regulate them. But the state Utilities Commission has the power to override local ordinances to achieve its mission of supplying electricity at reasonable rates. On February 4, 2010, the Eastern Cherokee Tribal Council passed a resolution opposing the project, stating, > It is this Tribe's solemn responsibility and moral duty to care for and > protect all of Kituwah from further desecration and degradation by human > agency in order to preserve the integrity of the most important site for the > origination and continuation of Cherokee culture, heritage, history and > identity.\\"Tribe opposes Substation at Kituwah Site\\", Cherokee One Feather, > SCOTT MCKIE B.P., accessed 9 Feb 2009 In March, Swain County passed a resolution calling for a 90-day moratorium to stop construction of Duke Energy's project until they could better consult. On April 23, 2010, the North Carolina Utilities Commission denied Duke Energy's \\"Motion to Hold Complaint in Abeyance.\\" It directed Duke to file an answer to the complaint on or before May 10, 2010. Duke agreed to halt the construction that threatened Kituwah for 90 days until the complaint was heard.\\"Citizens to Protect Kituwah Valley\\", Save Kituwah Valley In July 2010 the Swain County commission passed an ordinance requiring Duke Energy to consult with local stakeholders about projects, which they had not originally done in this case. In August 2010, after continued consultation, Duke agreed to move the proposed Hyatt Creek tie station away from sight of the Kituwa mounds. The Cherokee tribes and leaders of Swain County praised Duke Energy for their consultation on this project and this outcome. Traditions Cherokee oral traditions tell that all Cherokee settled in Kituwa after the migration from the Great Lakes region of the United States and southern Canada as early as 4,000 years ago. Cultural and archaeological evidence support the people's accounts of their migration, but there is no scholarly consensus about when they reached the Southeast. The ancient Cherokee had a hereditary priesthood, called the Ah-ni- ku-ta-ni, a structure that may have been adopted from another tribe. According to research by the early 20th century ethnographer James Mooney, the Cherokee held the Ah-ni-ku-ta-ni \\"in awe\\" and \\"greatly feared them.\\" They were not the regular chiefs. These were of two types, known as the ugus (owls), \\"white\\" chiefs (sometimes identified as those who worked for peace or during times of peace), and the colona (ravens), or \\"red\\" chiefs (identified as those who led in times of war.) Some traditional Cherokee identify by the autonym of Ah-ni- ki-tu-wa-gi (spelled variously in local Oklahoma dialects as Ki-tu-wa or Gi- du-wa), Kituwa people. The meaning of the word Kituwa is known to contemporary Cherokee speakers. It is not widely reported because of its sacred nature. Honoring the \\"mother town\\" was analogous to honoring Selu, the Cherokee Corn Mother (of the ancient Green Corn Ceremony and many other connections). Honoring mothers is a concept that has pervaded Cherokee culture. Well into the 20th century, the Cherokee had a matrilineal kinship system, by which clan membership, inheritance and status were carried by the mother's family. A child was considered born into its mother's family and clan. In the Green Corn Ceremony, one of the two social dances performed is of ancient origin. It may have been practiced in the mother town of Kituwa. The dance is called ye-lu- le, which means \\"to the center\\". During it, all of the dancers shout ye-lu-le and move toward the fire in the center of the dance circle. This dance symbolizes the dispersal of the sacred fire given to the people, according to their ancient legends. During Green Corn ceremonies in traditional Cherokee society, the coals of new fire were carried to all the Cherokee. They were used to kindle the ceremonial fires in each town before any of the new corn could be eaten. The home fires in outlying Cherokee communities were extinguished before the ceremonies and relit from the coals of the fire kindled during the Green Corn Dances.

Whistler painted the paneled room in a rich and unified palette of brilliant blue-greens with over-glazing and metallic gold leaf. Painted between 1876‚Äì77, it now is considered one of the greatest surviving Aesthetic interiors, and best examples of the Anglo-Japanese style. History The Peacock Room was originally designed as a dining room in the townhouse located at in the neighbourhood of Kensington in London, and owned by the British shipping magnate Frederick Richards Leyland. Leyland engaged the British architect Richard Norman Shaw to remodel and redecorate his home. Shaw entrusted the remodelling of the dining room to , another British architect experienced in the Anglo-Japanese style. Jeckyll conceived the dining room as a Porsellanzimmer (porcelain room). He covered the walls with 16th-century wall hangings of Cuir de Cordoue that had been originally brought to England as part of the dowry of Catherine of Aragon. They were painted with her heraldic device, the open pomegranate, and a series of red roses, Tudor roses, to symbolise her union with Henry VIII. They had hung on the walls of a Tudor style house in Norfolk for centuries, before they were bought by Leyland for ¬£1,000. Against these walls, Jekyll constructed an intricate lattice framework of engraved spindled walnut shelves that held Leyland's collection of Chinese blue and white porcelain, mostly from the Kangxi era of the Qing dynasty. To the south of the room, a walnut welsh dresser was placed in the centre, just below the large empty leather panel, and flanked on both sides by the framework shelves. On the east side, three tall windows parted the room overlooking a private park, and covered by full-length walnut shutters. To the north a fireplace, over which hung the painting by American painter James McNeill Whistler, , that served as the focal point of the room. The ceiling was constructed in a pendant panelled Tudor-style, and decorated with eight globed pendant gas light fixtures. To finish the room, Jekyll placed a rug with a red border on the floor. The Princess from the Land of Porcelain, in situ in the Peacock Room. Jeckyll had nearly completed his decorative scheme when an illness compelled him to abandon the project. Whistler, who was then working on decorations for the entrance hall of Leyland's house, volunteered to finish Jeckyll's work in the dining room. Concerned that the red roses adorning the leather wall hangings clashed with the colours in The Princess, Whistler suggested retouching the leather with yellow paint, and Leyland agreed to that minor alteration. He also authorised Whistler to embellish the cornice and wainscoting with a \\"wave pattern\\" derived from the design in Jeckyll's leaded-glass door, and then went to his home in Liverpool. During Leyland's absence however, Whistler grew bolder with his revisions. Upon returning, Leyland was shocked by the \\"improvements.\\" Artist and patron quarrelled so violently over the room and the proper compensation for the work that the important relationship for Whistler was terminated. At one point, Whistler gained access to Leyland's home and painted two fighting peacocks meant to represent the artist and his patron, and which he titled . Whistler is reported to have said to Leyland, \\"Ah, I have made you famous. My work will live when you are forgotten. Still, per chance, in the dim ages to come you will be remembered as the proprietor of the Peacock Room.\\" The dispute between Whistler and Leyland did not end there. In 1879, Whistler was forced to file for bankruptcy, and Leyland was his chief creditor at the time. When the creditors arrived to inventory the artist's home for liquidation, they were greeted by , a large painted caricature of Leyland portrayed as an anthropomorphic demonic peacock playing a piano, sitting upon Whistler's house, painted in the same colours featured in the Peacock Room. He referenced the incident again in his book, The Gentle Art of Making Enemies. Adding to the emotional drama was Whistler's fondness for Leyland's wife, Frances, who separated from her husband in 1879. Another result of this drama was Jeckyll who, so shocked by the first sight of his room, returned home and was later found on the floor of his studio covered in gold leaf; he never recovered and died insane three years later. Having acquired The Princess from the Land of Porcelain, American industrialist and art collector Charles Lang Freer anonymously purchased the entire room in 1904 from Leyland's heirs, including Leyland's daughter and her husband, the British artist Val Prinsep. Freer then had the contents of the Peacock Room installed in his Detroit mansion. After Freer's death in 1919, the Peacock Room was permanently installed in the Freer Gallery of Art at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. The gallery opened to the public in 1923. The Peacock Room was closed for renovation, along with other parts of the gallery, in January 2016. It reopened to the public in the summer of 2017. Legacy Filthy Lucre, an installation by contemporary artist Darren Waterston, replicates The Peacock Room in a state of decay and disrepair. It opened in May 2015. In March 2020, Church Life, a journal of The University of Notre Dame's McGrath Institute, published \\"The Art of Madness and Mystery,\\" an essay which uses The Peacock Room and Waterson's Filthy Lucre to examine at length the differences and inherent character of traditional art (especially in the context of Aestheticism) and Contemporary Art.

They have been called \\"The Masters of Black Romantic\\" by their fans. The band's song lyrics often focused on fantasy, occult or historical themes, along with their contemporaries and countrymen Helloween. They performed at Wacken Open Air festival in 2002. Over time they have changed their sound from a Judas Priest-esque style of heavy metal to a more keyboard based form of power metal. History Stormwitch was founded in the early eighties by childhood friends Harald Spengler (Lee Tarot), Stefan Kauffmann (Steve Merchant), and Andy M√ºck, writing their first songs while they searched for the final pieces of the band to play live shows, including clubs and youth centers. The first line-up was completed by Peter Langer (Pete Lancer) and J√ºrgen Wannenwetsch. Their first album, Walpurgis Night, in 1984, was recorded using as little post-production as possible to remain true to the sound they were trying to achieve. They did not use multi-track recording, instead recording the album straight through. Approximately a year later they recorded the album Tales of Terror, of which the master tapes were supposed to be destroyed, only recently being re-recorded using original LP albums. Their third album Stronger Than Heaven was released in 1986, followed by The Beauty and the Beast in 1987. In 1989, they released Eye of the Storm and Live in Budapest. They toured much of Europe during the Cold War, including Eastern European countries such as Hungary, where they were waylaid by officials and nearly missed the first gig of that particular tour. Shortly after, Harald Spengler left the band to concentrate on managing. In 1992, Stefan Kauffmann and Wolfgang Schludi (who replaced Harald Spengler) also left the band before the recordings for War of the Wizards could start. The recording line-up for War of the Wizards consisted of Andy M√ºck (Vocals), Damir Uzunovic (Guitar), Joe Gassmann (Guitar), Martin Albrecht (Bass) and Peter Langer (Drums). After the release, Joe Gassmann had to leave the band. As a four-piece they recorded \\"Shogun\\" in 1994. After some changes in line up once again and an eventual break up in 1996, Andy M√ºck, the only member from the original line-up, and Martin Winkler wrote the song Dance with the Witches in 2002, and with a new line up and the help of Nuclear Blast Records, Stormwitch regrouped once more and took to the stage. This new line-up also released the album Witchcraft in 2004 but split up shortly after. Again Andy M√ºck was the original member. He regrouped with first bass-player J√ºrgen Wannenwetsch in 2005. In 2010 the line-up was completed once again with Ralf Spitznagel (Guitar), Marc Scheunert (Guitar) and Harry Reischmann (Drums). Reischmann's departure was announced in January 2011, with Stefan K√∂llner being brought in to replace him on drums. The band have commented on their website that a new album is in progress and should be released in 2011. It will be titled Season of the Witch. On April 11, 2013 Original Guitarist Lee Tarot died of a stroke at the age of 50 In April 2013 Guitarist Marc Scheunert left the band due to problems caused by the age gap between himself and the other members of the band. Discography Stormwitch formed in the 1980s and released seven albums in their original spell: * Walpurgis Night (1984) * Tales of Terror (1985) * Stronger Than Heaven (1986) * The Beauty and the Beast (1988) * Live in Budapest (1989) * Eye of the Storm (1989) * War of the Wizards (1992) * Shogun (1994) * Dance with the Witches (2002) * Witchcraft (2004) * Season of the Witch (2015) * Bound to the Witch (2018) Members =Current= * Andy M√ºck ‚Äì Vocals (1981‚Äì1994, 2002‚Äì2004, 2010‚Äìpresent) * J√ºrgen Wannenwetsch ‚Äì Bass (1981‚Äì1983, 2010‚Äìpresent) * Marc Oppold ‚Äî Drums (2002‚Äì2004, 2016‚Äìpresent) * Volker Schmietow ‚Äî Guitar (2013‚Äìpresent) * Tobias Kipp ‚Äî Guitar (2016‚Äìpresent) =Former= Guitar * Steve Merchant (1981‚Äì1989) * Lee Tarot (1981‚Äì1989; died 2013) * Damir Uzunovic (1990‚Äì1994) * Joe Gassmann (1990‚Äì1992) * Robert Balci (1992‚Äì1994) * Martin Winkler (2002‚Äì2004; died 2019) * Fabian Schwarz (2002‚Äì2004) * Marc Scheunert (2010‚Äì2013) Bass * Ronny Pearson (1983‚Äì1987) * Andy Hunter (1987‚Äì1989) * Martin Albrecht (1990‚Äì1994) * Dominik Schwarz (2002‚Äì2004) Drums * Marc Oppold (1981‚Äì1994, 2012‚Äì2014) * Michael Blechinger (2004‚Äì2005) * Harry Reischmann (2010‚Äì2011) * Micha Kasper (2014‚Äì2015) =Timeline= References External links * Official Stormwitch website * Stormwitch on Nightfall in Metal Earth * In-depth information on Stormwitch Category:German heavy metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1981 Category:Nuclear Blast artists ","title":"Stormwitch"},{"id":"11526193","text":"Manuel Alberto Freire de Andrade y Armijo (4 November 1767 - 7 March 1835) was a Spanish cavalry officer and general officer during the Peninsular War, and later Defense Minister. Freire (also known as Freyre) was born in Carmona, Spain near Seville, to a Spanish cavalry officer from Galicia, Francisco Freire de Andrade, and his wife Josefa Armijo y Bravo, also from Carmona. He joined his father's Alc√°ntara cavalry regiment as a minor cadet when just seven years old, and on 1 January 1780 became an ordinary cadet. He participated in his first battle on 15 May 1793, against revolutionary French forces during the opening of the Battle of Mas Deu, part of the War of the Pyrenees. Freire spent the next two years in Rousillon and Catalonia, including that war's last actions during which Spanish forces recaptured Puigcerda and Bellver (after the peace treaty had been signed).Urquijo Goitia, Jos√© Ram√≥n \\"Diccionario biogr√°fico de ministros\\". Instituto de Historia. Retrieved 1 September 2103. Freire received several promotions during that war, having been named a junior lieutenant on 10 October 1793, full lieutenant on 20 November, ayundante on 13 December 1793, captain on 18 February 1794, and cavalry captain on 28 July 1795. During the following peace, Freire was promoted to sergeant major, then command of a squadron on 4 April 1801. He later participated in a campaign against Portugal in Arronches, before being assigned to training in Mallorca. Peninsular War Freire joined fellow Spaniards in fighting against invading Napoleonic forces, and on 15 September 1807, took command (as colonel) of a volunteer cavalry regiment in Madrid. The following year he saw action in Extremadura and other locations. He was promoted to brigadier on 2 March 1809 after a campaign in La Mancha, and to field marshal after the Battle of Talavera. On 10 January 1810, he was appointed commander of cavalry under Juan Carlos de Ar√©izaga and led them at Oca√±a on 19 November, a devastating defeat that cost the Spanish control of Andalusia. He wrote a manual revising Spanish cavalry tactics, published in Murcia in 1813. After fighting the French in Murcia, Granada, and Valencia (1810-1812), Freire became a general and succeeded Francisco Javier Casta√±os in command of the Fourth Army, or Army of Galicia on August 12, 1813.\\"El 12 de agosto fue relevado del mando del cuarto ej√©rcito espa√±ol el General Casta√±os, por haberle llamado las C√≥rtes √° desempe√±ar su plaza de Consejero de Estado, sucedi√©ndole el Mariscal de Campo Manuel Freire, y destinado al ej√©rcito de Catalu√±a al de igual clase Don Pedro Agustin Giron, Comandante general del Centro. Casta√±os, que conoci√≥ el pretesto con que la Regencia le separaba del mando, escribi√≥ en estos t√©rminos al Ministro de la Guerra: \\"Tengo la satisfacci√≥n de entregar al Mariscal de Campo Freire, sobre la frontera de Francia, el mando del ej√©rcito que he tomado en Aldea Gallega, delante de Lisboa\\". (Mu√±oz Maldonado, vol. III. p. 420) His corps defeated Soult at the Battle of San Marcial on 31 August 1813, earning him the San Fernando Cross. At the Battle of the Bidassoa on 7 October, Freire led the divisions of Generals Del Barco and Barcena across the river to capture French positions on Mont Calvaire.Glover, p. 285 Freire also participated in the Battle of Nivelle on 10 November.Glover, p. 385 He fought with \\"conspicuous gallantry\\"Gates, p. 34 at the Battle of Toulouse in 1814, where his two divisions were desperately mauled in the fighting for the French redoubts on Mont Rave.Longford, p. 420 On 7 October 1814, Freire married Beatriz Abbad y Alfaro, the 33-year-old widow of a fellow officer. They had two sons, Manuel (who died shortly after his father) and Jose (who succeeded to the title of Marquis de San Marcial awarded his father shortly before his death). Freire's military career continued, and he also became active in politics during the turbulent post-war era. In 1818, Freire and three other officers published \\"Informe sobre la mejora y aumento de la cr√≠a de caballos, dado al Supremo Consejo de Guerra\\".Tenientes Generales D.

It was created by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in order to improve the effectiveness of United Nations development activities at the country level. Its strategic priorities are to respond to the Triennial comprehensive policy review (TCPR) ‚Äì which became in 2008 the Quadrennial comprehensive policy review (QCPR) ‚Äì and global development priorities, as well as to ensure the UN development system becomes more internally focused and coherent. The UNSDG strategic priorities give direction to UNDG members' efforts at the global, regional and country level to facilitate a step change in the quality and impact of UN support at the country level. Currently, the UNSDG is one of the main UN actors involved in the development of the Post-2015 Development Agenda. The UNDG was renamed as the UNSDG around January 2018.  History  By 1997, there were calls within the United Nations to draw all UN agencies working on development issues together; for the many UN Development Programmes, Funds, and Specialised Agencies were encroaching upon each other's activities.Stokke, O., 2009, The UN and Development: From Aid to Cooperation, Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, p.403-404Klingebiel, S., 1998, Effectiveness And Reform of The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), German Development Institute Book Series No. 13, London: Frank Cass This was especially so with the Delivering as One initiative. An initial proposal was to merge UNICEF, the World Food Programme and the UNFPA into the UNDP. Finally, then Secretary- General Kofi Annan worked to form the UNDG and won praise from then UNDP Administrator James Speth. In May 2018 the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) was reorganized into the United Nations Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG) in order to accelerate progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals.

The CEB brings the executive heads of UN organizations together on a regular basis under the chairmanship of the Secretary-General. Within the CEB structure, the High-Level Committee on Management works on system-wide administrative and management issues, the High-Level Committee on Programmes considers global policy issues, while the United Nations Development Group deals with operational activities for development with a focus on country-level work. The Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) chairs the UNSDG. The UNSDG Chair reports to the Secretary-General and the CEB on progress in implementing the group‚Äôs work plan, and on the management of the Resident Coordinator System. Governance Structures = Leadership = The United Nations Economic and Social Council and the United Nations General Assembly provide oversight and mandates for the UNSDG.https://undg.org/home/about-undg/mandates/ UNDG Mandates (TCPR/QCPR)] The UNSDG is overseen by the Economic and Financial Committee (Second Committee) of the General Assembly. The UNSDG has provided reports such as the Comprehensive statistical analysis of the financing of operational activities for development of the UN system for 2006 and the Comprehensive statistical analysis of the financing of operational activities for development of the UN system for 2007 to the General Assembly. The UNSDG's chairperson is the UNDP's Administrator. Since its inception, the following have been the Chair of the UNSDG: * James Speth (1997‚Äì1999) * Mark Malloch Brown (1999‚Äì2005) * Kemal Dervi≈ü (2005‚Äì2009) * Helen Clark (2009‚Äì 2017) * Achim Steiner (2017- ) = UNSDG Advisory Group = Under Kemal Dervi≈ü' leadership, an \\"Advisory Group\\", which provides the UNSDG Chair with advice and guidance on managing the operational dimensions of the UNSDG and the Resident Coordinator System, was established. In 2009, the non-rotational members of the advisory group were: the FAO, ILO, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNHCR, WFP, WHO and UNIDO. The rotational members (for a period of one year, as of 2016) are: the UNCTAD (representing UNEP, UN Habitat and UNODC) and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Africa (representing all five Regional Commissions). UNDG Chair and Advisory Group = Development Coordination Office = The UN Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) is a key component within the UNSDG, promoting social and economic progress by providing support. It was key part of UNSDG's formation in 1997, uniting the UN system and improve the quality of its development assistance. Coordination leads to more strategic UN support for national plans and priorities, makes operations more efficient, reduces transaction costs for governments, and ultimately helps people attain the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development objectives. At present is the Secretariat and technical and advisory support unit of the UNSDG. It brings together the UN development system to promote change and innovation to deliver together on sustainable development. DOCO works under the leadership of the UNSDG Chair and guidance of the UNSDG. The team provides field evidence to inform policy, facilitates the achievement of shared results, and promotes excellence in UN leadership and coordination. The core objective is a relevant and impactful UN contribution to development.

He was the thirteenth child of his parents, John and Deborah Knapp Randall. His father was a Revolutionary War veteran, born in Westmoreland County, Virginia and later was Collector of the Port of Annapolis and was elected three times as Mayor of Annapolis between 1813 and 1818. Education As a child, Randall attended schoolrooms taught by Miss Sally Ross, Thomas Bassford and Mr. Curran. He graduated with first honor in his class from St. John's College in Annapolis in 1822, teaching during his junior and senior years. Career After graduation, Randall thought of teaching but his father quashed the idea, directing him instead to the legal profession. Randall studied law for two years in the law offices of Addison Ridout and was admitted to the bar in 1824, the same year that Lafayette visited Annapolis. Two years later, when his father died, Randall took his place as Collector of the Port of Annapolis until about 1830. In 1833, John Johnson Jr., son of the elder John Johnson and older brother of Reverdy Johnson, persuaded Randall to consider the post of Auditor of the Court of Chancery, which position Randall held until he resigned in 1840, when he was nominated as Candidate to the 27th Congress on the Whig ticket with John Pendleton Kennedy At the same time, he was made a Trustee of St. John's College and affairs of the College remained a lifelong passion for him. Randall's nephew and namesake, Alexander Burton Hagner, joined Randall in his law office in 1845 and the two formed a law practice under the name of Randall and Hagner; the partnership lasted for 34 years. In 1868, Randall's son John Wirt Randall joined the firm.Brune-Randall Papers at the Maryland Historical Society, SC # 652 During the Civil War, Randall was firm in his opposition to secession and maintained unwavering loyalty to the Union. Many of his friends and family, however, found themselves needing his help when they were threatened with arrest or forfeiture of property. Randall was elected Maryland Attorney General in 1864, an office he held until 1867 when Maryland's State Constitution was revised. He was a delegate to the National Republican Convention in Philadelphia in 1872, nominating Ulysses S. Grant as a candidate for President of the United States. After the Civil War, Randall worked to recover from the government funds for St. John's College for damages done during the use of the grounds and buildings as a hospital during the war years. He also sought to ensure the permanence of the Naval Academy in Annapolis. He formed Gas and Water Companies to provide Annapolis with gas lighting and to replace its brackish well water with pure. In 1877, Randall, a long-time member of the Board of Directors of Farmers' National Bank, received the unwelcome news that the Bank was over leveraged against properties in Annapolis. The Board elected Randall as President of the Bank; he turned most of his law practice over to his son, John Wirt Randall, and he worked for the remainder of his life to resolve bank matters, straighten out the books and records, maintain public confidence, sell properties and set the bank on a profitable course. Hagner resigned from Randall & Hagner in 1879 to move to Washington to become an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. The firm subsequently became Randall & Randall when John Wirt Randall took as his partner his brother Daniel. Personal After a long courtship, Randall married Catharine Gamble Wirt, the daughter of US Attorney General William Wirt, in 1841. Together they had eight children, five of whom survived to adulthood. Catharine died in 1853, leaving children ranging in ages from to 9 years old. Catharine's mother, Elizabeth Washington Gamble Wirt, was living with the Randall family at the time and continued to reside with them after her daughter's death. In 1856, Randall married Elizabeth Philpot Blanchard, the daughter of an old friend of his, the Reverend John Blanchard. Together they had seven children. Randall was keenly interested in the welfare and promotion of his city of Annapolis. He was an early advocate of public school education and organized in Annapolis the first primary school in the State under the original law of 1825, and served for many years as clerk, trustee or commissioner of these schools. He was interested in farming, gardening and horticulture and planted trees around Annapolis, an action that was considered at that time to be unhealthful. His son, John Wirt Randall, continued with his father's work and was a Member of the House of Delegates from Anne Arundel County, 1884-85 which introduced and pushed through the Legislature the joint resolutions that created Maryland's \\"Arbor Day\\" in 1884. Randall was a devout member and vestryman of St. Anne's Episcopal Church in Annapolis and a member of the Diocese. He attended the General Conventions in Baltimore, New York and Philadelphia as lay delegate. He was a firm adherent to the Temperance Movement and for many years was the President of the State Temperance Society. He died at his home on November 21, 1881, two months before his 79th birthday and is buried at St. Anne's Cemetery in Annapolis. Children Randall left six sons and six daughters when he died.

The film was adapted by Lonne Elder III from the 1970 Newbery Medal-winning novel Sounder by William H. Armstrong. Plot In 1933 Louisiana, the Morgans (Cicely Tyson, Paul Winfield, Kevin Hooks), a loving and strong family of black sharecroppers raising sugar cane, face a serious family crisis in the midst of the Great Depression. Nathan Morgan tries to teach his son David to be a man and survive in difficult times with their dog, Sounder. But Nathan is imprisoned for a year after stealing a ham to feed his starving family. While Nathan is in the local jail awaiting shipment to a work camp, the sheriff will barely allow the family to visit. A sympathetic local woman with access to the sheriff's filing cabinet tells the family the location of Nathan's camp, and plots the route on a road map. Sounder, who had been injured and lost, returns home in time to accompany David on a long but unsuccessful walk to visit his father. On the way home, David discovers a school. A kindly but firm teacher named Camille takes him in and starts to teach him about important African- American figures in history. David becomes desperate to go to school, but when his father is released a maimed man, David must choose between leaving home for an education that can give him a better life and staying home to support his father.

He noted that he at first refused the assignment, but producer Robert B. Radnitz and director Martin Ritt convinced him to work with them, as \\"I wanted to keep Sounder accurate in its historical context, and not go off on any present-day fantasies.\\"\\"Sounder\\". American Film Institute. Retrieved March 1, 2014. A notable aspect of casting in the film is that the minister is played by an actual minister and the judge is played by an actual judge.  Soundtrack  Taj Mahal recorded a soundtrack to the film, released in 1972 by Columbia Records. According to music journalist Robert Christgau, it was \\"the first soundtrack ever patterned after a field recording\\", featuring a \\"suite/montage/succession of hums, moans, claps, and plucked fragments\\", all performed in the key of the gospel blues song \\"Needed Time\\" by Lightnin' Hopkins. Fellow critic Greil Marcus regarded it as Mahal's \\"most eloquent music\\", although Christgau said \\"even Greil doesn't know anybody who agrees. I've always regarded field recordings as study aids myself.\\" He gave the soundtrack album a C-plus in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). Release Sounder opened September 24, 1972 at the Embassy and Plaza theaters in New York City. =Home media= When the film was released on VHS, Paramount Home Video assumed distribution rights. Sterling Entertainment currently has DVD distribution rights. Reception =Critical reception= Sounder received warm reviews, and was praised as a welcome antidote to the contemporaneous wave of black films, most of which were considered of low quality and budget and exploitative. The film's depiction of a loving family was hailed as a banner accomplishment for black filmmakers and audiences. Variety wrote that the picture had been \\"for good or ill, singled out to test whether the black audience will respond to serious films about the black experience rather than the 'super black' exploitation features.\\" Some of Sounder's success was due to its innovative marketing strategy. Fox focused on group sales in major cities and targeted religious organizations and schools. Radnitz personally visited 35 cities and held over 500 screenings, with 60 simultaneous sneak previews held in New York City. The religious establishment came out in favor of the film, with an endorsement by the Catholic Film Office and a study guide for religious educators created by the National Council of Churches. The Variety article noted that Fox wrote a study guide, prepared by Dr. Roscoe Brown, Jr., director of Afro-American Affairs at New York University. 20th Century Fox spent over $1 million promoting the film, according to Variety. John Simon wrote \\"Sounder is a rare honest movie about people who work the soil under conditions of extreme rigor. Sounder is also a rare honest Hollywood movie about blacks, making it virtually unique'. Based on 16 reviews, Sounder holds an 88% \\"Fresh\\" score (and an average of 7.7/10) on Rotten Tomatoes. In his Family Guide to Movies on Video, Henry Herx wrote: \\"Sounder captures the humanity of [its] characters and a fine, distanced sense of its sleepy Southern locale. The movie earns a deep emotional response from its audience because its [appealing] story and characters are believable. Not only a valid examination of the black experience in America, it is also a fine family experience.\\" He added that the boy's search for his father \\"provides additional drama\\". Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four, stating that \\"This is a film for the family to see.\\" Both Gene Siskel and Ebert placed the film on their 10-best lists of 1972. =Box office= Despite popular skepticism that the film would not be a financial success, and the belief that \\"the black film market is exclusively an action and exploitation market\\", the picture was a major box-office hit. The film grossed $27,045 from 2 theaters in its opening week and grossed 30% more the following week. Made for less than $1 million, it grossed just under $17 million, generating $9 million of theatrical rentals in the United States and Canada in 1973, the 10th highest-grossing film of 1972.

It stars Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo as two small-time mobsters from Newark, New Jersey, and features Harvey Keitel, Ray Sharkey, Lou Albano, Dan Hedaya, and Frank Vincent. Plot Italian American Harry Valentini and his Jewish friend and next-door neighbor Moe Dickstein occupy the bottom rung of Newark Mafia boss Anthony Castelo's gang. Making a living by doing Castelo's lowest jobs (such as looking after his goldfish, testing out bullet- proof jackets, or checking the boss's car for bombs) the two men dream of opening the world's first Jewish-Italian delicatessen. However, they get little to no respect from their boss or his subordinates, who frequently ridicule them. They accompany Frank \\"The Fixer\\" Acavano, one of Castelo's top men and a violent, heavyset psychopath, to Meadowlands Racetrack to place a bet on Castelo's behalf. Valentini changes horses at the last minute because his boss usually bets on the wrong one. However, this time Castelo had fixed the race, meaning that Harry and Moe now owe their boss $250,000. After a night of torture, both are forced to agree to kill each other. Unaware that each has made a deal and frightened following the murder of Harry's cousin Marco, they steal Acavano's Cadillac and travel to Atlantic City to see Harry's uncle Mike, a retired mobster who started Castelo in the crime business. After using Acavano's credit cards to pay for a luxury stay in a hotel owned by their old friend Bobby DiLea, the two go to Uncle Mike's house to ask for help. They find only Uncle Mike's ashes, leading to Moe leaving in disgust. Grandma Valentini, however, is able to give Harry the money he owes. Harry tries to get DiLea to sort things out with Castelo. As he and Moe leave the hotel, their limo is being driven by Acavano, after DiLea appears to double-cross the two. Harry luckily spies Castelo's hitmen and decides to stay behind and gamble the money. After a chase through the hotel casino, Moe catches up to Harry and accidentally shoots him. Harry is pronounced dead and Moe flees. Back in Newark, Moe hides out of sight at Harry's funeral. He is spotted by the huge Acavano (who is eating a sandwich during the burial service) and Castelo resolves to kill Moe after the service. Moe returns to his house and prepares to hang himself. Before doing so, sees a vision of Harry at the foot of the stairs. He quickly realizes that it is actually Harry, who arranged the whole thing with DiLea. Moe is thrilled, although he is so shocked that he is almost hanged anyway until Harry intervenes. Harry provides a skeleton for Moe and they write a suicide note before turning on the gas and setting fire to the curtains. As the two leave Moe's house, however, the door slams shut and puts the fire out. Castelo and his men enter to find a bizarre scene. Castelo takes out a cigarette, prompting his stooges to routinely spark their lighters for him. Acavano asks \\"Who farted?\\", prompting Castelo to realize the house is filled with gas just before the house explodes, with the crew inside it. Harry and Moe return to Atlantic City, where Moe bemoans the fact that they didn't keep the money. Harry informs him that he did save the money, but has invested it. Moe seems perturbed, but the film ends with their dream realized as the two stand in their Jewish-Italian delicatessen.

His parents divorced when he was 10, after which Kokesh says he took refuge in punk rock. His father, Charles Kokesh, is a businessman, trophy hunter, and at one time the owner of Santa Fe Horse Park. As an adolescent, Kokesh had an interest in sports, science and technology, and was encouraged by his parents to read numerous books. When Kokesh was fourteen, he attended Devil Pups junior base camp at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County, California. He attended Stevenson School, a boarding school in Pebble Beach, for his first year of high school, until he was kicked out for possession of alcohol.

In April 2007, Kokesh and a number of other activists were arrested after protesting the Iraq war in the Senate Hart Office Building. Kokesh had performed a ceremony for lost service members using an American flag.Marine veteran, protester faces discharge, United Press International, June 4, 2007. During the Senate Hart Office Building demonstration, Kokesh was wearing combat fatigue pants (with name tags and emblems removed), which the Marine Corps prohibits reserve troops from wearing during anti-war demonstrations. After Kokesh was contacted via e-mail with a warning for violating uniform regulations, he responded with a refusal to comply and used an expletive in his reply. He contends that the warning was an attempt to silence and punish members of the military for exercising their constitutional rights; while the Marine Corps said it was a matter of ordinary discipline and Kokesh was not singled out. In June, a panel of officers stripped Kokesh of his \\"honorable discharge\\" status as a result of his conduct. Supporters of Kokesh from around the country later staged a protest, holding banners and signs in support of Kokesh, and criticizing George W. Bush over the war. Many of the protestors wore red badges bearing the number \\"3,495\\", the number of U.S. military deaths in Iraq at the time. In June 2007, Kokesh, along with IVAW members Liam Madden and Nate Lewis, was arrested for crossing onto Fort Benning during an anti-war protest. A spokesperson for the IVAW said the three had accidentally stepped onto the base while talking to a guard. The trespass charges were dismissed. =Ron Paul 2008 presidential campaign= On September 2, 2008, Kokesh spoke at Ron Paul's Rally for the Republic in St. Paul, Minnesota.David Weigel, Anti-War Activist Mounts GOP Campaign for Congress , The Washington Independent, December 18, 2009. = Thomas Jefferson Memorial silent dance = On May 28, 2009, Kokesh and other activists participated in a flash mob-silent dance at the Thomas Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C. in protest of a recent ruling against dancing within the monument. Kokesh, along with four others including Medea Benjamin of Code Pink, were arrested by the U.S. Park Police for demonstrating without a permit. Kokesh was told he was under arrest after dancing a jig. He refused officers orders and was subsequently violently body- slammed onto the marble floor, put in a choke hold, then cuffed. The aggressive nature of the arrests raised concerns about the actions of some of the officers and prompted an internal investigation by the Park Police.Sarah Kaufman, Dancing in Jefferson Memorial? Our Founding Father would approve, The Washington Post, May 2011. A much larger protest on June 4 organized by Kokesh and Code Pink involved about 200 protesters and 75 dancers. About 10 minutes after the dancing began, police began clearing the monument. No arrests were made. When asked by a journalist if he had a permit to protest, Kokesh reportedly produced a copy of the Constitution and said, \\"Actually I got a permit. It's the same one I swore an oath to when I enlisted in the Marine Corps. And it says something about 'freedom of assembly.'\\" =Veterans for Ron Paul (2012)= Kokesh was a spokesperson for \\"Veterans for Ron Paul\\", a grassroots group in support of the Ron Paul 2012 presidential campaign. On February 20, 2012, after a \\"Veterans for Ron Paul\\" rally organized by Kokesh, 500 marchers, including veterans, active-duty service, and their families, marched towards the White House. There they engaged in ceremonial flag-folding in memory of deceased soldiers and periods of silence for soldiers who died in battle and for those who committed suicide after returning.Matthew Larotonda, Veterans for Ron Paul Rally at White House, ABC News, February 20, 2012. = Cursing ban in Middleborough, Massachusetts = On June 26, 2012, Kokesh organized a protest against the decision of Middleborough, Massachusetts, to ban cursing in public with punishment of a $20 fine. Kokesh said efforts to limit citizens' free speech was \\"more offensive, vulgar and obscene than any curse word.\\" In October 2012, the decision was overturned by the state's attorney general on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. =Open Carry March on Washington= In May 2013, Kokesh announced an \\"Open Carry March on Washington\\" where thousands of marchers bearing arms would cross from Virginia into Washington, D.C. on Independence Day to protest strict gun laws. He described the event as a nonviolent demonstration to be coordinated with DC law enforcement and that marchers should respond \\"with Satyagraha\\" and peacefully turn back if met with force, and should be prepared to \\"submit to arrest without resisting.\\" On July 4, 2013, Kokesh posted a YouTube video of himself allegedly loading a shotgun in Freedom Plaza in the District of Columbia in open defiance of DC law. Police indicated they believed he may have used a green screen, though on his return to the plaza on July 8 he insisted data from government surveillance cameras in Freedom Plaza would show he was there. On the evening of July 9, a U.S. Park Police SWAT team raided Kokesh's house in Herndon, Virginia, executing a search warrant for the shotgun and raw footage from the July 4 video. With helicopters providing air support, the police officers knocked then kicked in the door and lobbed a flash grenade in the foyer, filling the house with smoke. Police clad in body armor stormed in and handcuffed Kokesh and his housemates, who alleged mistreatment during the raid and the ensuing five-hour search, which allegedly turned up the shotgun and Psilocybin mushrooms. Kokesh was charged with possession of Schedule I or II drugs and possession of a gun with Schedule I or II drugs, both felonies. Kokesh refused to leave his cell to be arraigned and fingerprinted, but was arraigned by a judge in his cell the next day. In a jailhouse interview on July 18 Kokesh denied any connection to the drugs found in the raid, implying they were planted. On the same day, Kokesh announced his plans to run for President of the United States in 2020 on a platform of an orderly dissolution of the U.S. Federal Government. On July 26, Kokesh posted bail in Virginia and was immediately rearrested by U.S. Park Police for breaking a D.C. law forbidding bearing arms which carries a penalty of up to five years in jail, in connection with his Freedom Plaza video. Magistrate Judge Lori Parker ordered Kokesh to remain in the D.C. jail over the weekend because, she said, he had violated the rules of his release in another case. Specifically, she noted that in June 2013, Kokesh was charged with possession of marijuana after he was arrested on the south side of the White House allegedly smoking a marijuana cigarette. On July 29 D.C. Superior Court Judge Frederick Sullivan, calling Kokesh \\"a very dangerous man,\\" ordered him to remain in D.C. jail until trial. On November 6, 2013, Kokesh was released from jail after waiving his right to a trial and pleading guilty to the July 4 weapons charges and a marijuana possession charge from the June 8 White House protest. On January 16, 2014, Kokesh was sentenced to two years of probation. On June 12, 2014, Kokesh, after entering an Alford plea in Circuit Court to two felonies related to his possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms while possessing a gun, was convicted of drug and gun charges, which he did not contest. In September, Kokesh received a suspended sentence. =Protest against the war in Syria= In April 2017, Kokesh had organized a demonstration in front of the White House as a protest against the Syrian bombing campaign, but before it could start Kokesh was arrested on an outstanding warrant for failing to appear in court on charges related to him disrupting a TSA security line in Maryland in 2015.  2010 New Mexico 3rd Congressional District bid  On October 15, 2009, Kokesh filed with the FEC to run for the U.S. House of Representatives from New Mexico's 3rd congressional district as a Republican. He finished second in the Republican primary with 29 percent of the vote, losing the nomination to businessman Tom Mullins, who went on to lose the November general election to incumbent Democrat Ben Ray Luj√°n.  FREEDOM!  While in jail after his 2013 arrest stemming from his civil disobedience at Freedom Plaza, Kokesh began work on his book FREEDOM! Kokesh got the idea for the book while reading other libertarian tracts during his stay in jail. The book advocates for the use of cryptocurrency and claims the safest populace is a well-armed one. FREEDOM! was published on Independence Day (July 4) in 2014. =Book tours= In August 2016, Kokesh embarked on the \\"For the Love of FREEDOM!\\" tour. The tour, featuring over 60 stops and including all of the 48 contiguous states, served as an exploratory tour for his 2020 Presidential run. Free copies of his book were given away to all in attendance at each event. In January 2019, 204,453 copies of FREEDOM! were mailed for free to residents in many neighbourhoods of New Orleans, Louisiana. The distribution cost around US$131,000, which was primarily raised from cryptocurrency-related companies. The promotional campaign was named \\"Operation Big Easy Book Bomb\\" and intentionally timed before the 2020 Libertarian National Convention. 2020 presidential campaign On July 23, 2013, Kokesh announced his candidacy for U.S. president in 2020 from a jailhouse interview with Fox 5, after he was arrested for the Open Carry incident earlier that month. He stated he was running on the single-issue idea of an \\"orderly dissolution of the U.S. Federal Government\\". He was the first Libertarian Party candidate to announce a presidential bid for the 2020 election. On January 16, 2018, Kokesh reaffirmed his candidacy for president. He was pulled over by Texas Department of Public Safety Troopers twice that day and arrested the second time on marijuana and controlled substance charges. He was bailed out on January 25. In April 2020, he announced that John McAfee, the software developer running his own campaign for the nomination, as his running mate; McAfee also endorsed Kokesh. Kokesh chose Larry Sharpe as his new running mate. Kokesh was eliminated in the second round of the 2020 Libertarian National Convention, and subsequently endorsed Libertarian nominee Jo Jorgensen's campaign. =Endorsements= * Arvin Vohra, endorsed after he was eliminated in primary * Cynthia McKinney, former Democratic Representative and Green Party politician * John McAfee, software developer = Government = Kokesh views government as the greatest cause of violence in the world today and believes that governmental coercion is just as undesirable as coercion performed by a private citizen. He believes that government should be abolished in order to reduce violence and build a society based on respect. Kokesh has stated he does not hate the people running the U.S. government, however he believes government has invalidated itself by betraying the principles from which it was founded. Kokesh ran for President of the United States in 2020 on the platform of an orderly dissolution of the federal government. Kokesh stated that if elected, he would immediately sign his one-and-only executive order to declare the federal government bankrupt and of no authority. He would then resign to become \\"Custodian of the Federal Government\\" to oversee the process as a bankruptcy agent. Every federal agency would then either be liquidated, localized to the state level or privatized, over the next four years. = Foreign policy = Kokesh supports a non-interventionist foreign policy. Kokesh is a prominent anti-war activist. Adam vs. The Man = Radio = Adam vs. The Man was a talk show which was available in a variety of formats, such as AM radio, web- access, podcast and Facebook-linked YouTube channel. Initially airing in 2011 as an evening two-hour broadcast on KIVA AM 1550 talk radio in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Adam vs. The Man then shifted to a half-hour video news format on RT before fully moving to the internet as an hour-long video podcast. On April 7, 2014, AVTM 4.0 was launched from Los Angeles, California, and could be viewed live daily from noon to 2 PM, Pacific Time Zone. =RT America= Adam vs. The Man was licensed by the Russian affiliated RT America in April 2011. The move was criticized by Accuracy in Media's columnist Cliff Kincaid who referenced his own column entry from 2008 discussing RT's coverage of the Russia‚ÄìGeorgian War in which he condemned RT for \\"preferring to use foreigners, especially Americans, to make Russian propaganda points\\"Cliff Kincaid, \\"Hostile Takeover of Fox News\\" , November 21, 2005Cliff Kincaid, Russian TV Sounds Like Soviet TV, Accuracy in Media, August 19, 2008. before stating that \\"the American Marine Veteran, Adam Kokesh, seems to fit the bill, having emerged as an anti-war activist who ran as a Republican for Congress and supported Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) for president\\".Cliff Kincaid, KGB TV to Air Show Hosted by Anti-war Marine Vet, Accuracy in Media, April 5, 2011. Slate writer David Weigel quoted Kokesh describing RT's model, saying: \\"Truth is the best propaganda. I love it! I really love the concept of that. It's funny: People say we're hiding shit as a network. No, no‚Äîwe put the fact that this is propaganda right out front. We're putting out the truth that no one else wants to say. I mean, if you want to put it in the worst possible abstract, it's the Russian government, which is a competing protection racket against the other governments of the world, going against the United States and calling them on their bullshit.\\"David Weigel, Pravda Will Set You Free; Russia's answer to Fox News and MSNBC., Slate, June 27, 2011. After only a few months on RT, Adam vs. The Man was canceled in August by the network to avoid potential legal problems stemming from a Federal Election Commission complaint filed against RT by the group America's Survival, Inc. over the matter of Kokesh endorsing Ron Paul for President (thereby allegedly running afoul of the Foreign Agents Registration Act). *ASI FEC Complaint = YouTube channel = Kokesh routinely uploads activism videos to his YouTube channel, Adam vs. The Man. As of July 2019, the YouTube channel had 248,000 subscribers. Topics include Kokesh's political views, and videos about how to complete a DUI-checkpoint. In 2015, the Kokesh renamed the channel to Freedom! Film appearances Kokesh appears in the role of \\"A Soldier\\" in the 2016 film The Prey, and as himself in the documentaries The Road to Fallujah (2008), For Liberty: How the Ron Paul Revolution Watered the Withered Tree of Liberty (2009), Owned & Operated (2012), Derrick J's Victimless Crime Spree (2012), ShadowRing (2015), and Gray State: The Rise (2015). On January 19, 2013, Kokesh appeared as a future version of himself at an anti-war-debt rally scene in the 2014 sci-fi thriller, Alongside Night. Kokesh wrote the speech he delivered, a tribute to the character of Dr. Martin Vreeland (played by Kevin Sorbo), in the background during an action sequence. Most of the speech plays during the movie's end credits and the unedited full speech is on YouTube.

Early life and family Andrew H. Ward was born near Cynthiana in Harrison County, Kentucky.\\"Ward, Andrew Harrison\\". Biographical Directory of the United States Congress He was the son of Andrew and Elizabeth (Headington) Ward.Biographical Cyclopedia, p. 29 Ward was named for his father and for William Henry Harrison, under whom his father served in the War of 1812. Ward attended the county schools, then matriculated to Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He served as clerk on a steamboat on the Tombigbee River for several years. He began to study law in 1842 and was admitted to the bar in 1844, commencing practice in Cynthiana. In 1846, Ward married Ellen V. Moore. The couple had one daughter (Mollie M. Ward Gaddy) before Ellen V. Moore Ward died in 1848. Ward married Elizabeth Ware on December 31, 1857; she died in 1865, leaving no children. On April 28, 1868, he married Helen H. Lair. The couple had two daughters - Bertie M. (Ward) Lafferty and Catherine Ward - and three sons - Harry R. Ward, Paul S. Ward, and Ashley F. Ward. Political career During his early political career, Ward was affiliated with the Whig Party, but after the dissolution of the Whigs, he associated himself with the Democratic Party. He was elected city attorney of Cynthiana in 1860. In 1861, Ward unsuccessfully sought election to the Kentucky House of Representatives but was elected to that chamber two years later, serving a single, two-year term. He was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the Thirty-ninth Congress in 1864 but was later elected to represent the Sixth District to the 39th Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Green Clay Smith. He served from December 3, 1866, to March 3, 1867, and was not a candidate for renomination in 1866. Although he never formally enlisted for service in the American Civil War, he opposed secession and was among the 330 citizens who successfully resisted John Hunt Morgan's raid on Cynthiana in 1864. Later life and death Following his tenure in Congress, Ward resumed the practice of law. He defended the first case of treason tried in Kentucky. He practiced law into his eighties, and the maximum penalty ever imposed on one of his clients was ten years in the penitentiary. Concurrent with his late law practice, he served as president of the National Bank of Cynthiana and was Sunday school superintendent at the local Christian church.Biographical Cyclopedia, p. 30 He died in Cynthiana, Kentucky, on April 16, 1904, and was interred in Battle Grove Cemetery.

At low tide, the Sands of Nigg are exposed. Nigg Bay can be said to start at Balintraid pier ‚Äì probably the oldest pier on the Cromarty Firth ‚Äì built by Thomas Telford in 1821. There is a wartime mining base alongside the pier and a series of coastal gun emplacements on the road to North Sutor.  RSPB Reserve  Nigg Bay is an extensive area of mudflats, saltmarsh and wet grassland on the Cromarty Firth. Visitors between October and March are sure to see countless wading birds and wildfowl, such as bar-tailed godwits, knots, pink-footed geese and wigeon, feeding and roosting on the mudflats, moving with the tide in and out of the bay. The best time to visit is two hours either side of high-tide, as the birds are pushed up closer to the hide. The summer months bring breeding birds to the wetland areas and saltmarsh. The RSPB are also creating a new area of wet grassland to attract breeding lapwings and redshanks. Up to 10,000 pink-footed geese can be seen feeding in the bay on their return migration to their breeding grounds. Lapwings and oystercatchers prepare for the breeding season here in spring The reserve is well equipped with one wheelchair accessible hide and it is also pushchair friendly.RSPB Villages On the south east coast of Nigg Bay lie the village and parish of Nigg, which took its name from the bay, with the village of Pitcalnie further up the coast. On the north west shore of the bay are the villages of Milton to the east side of the shore, Barbaraville almost directly across from the fabrication yard and Balintraid further west. A ferry links the villages of Cromarty on the Black Isle to Nigg Ferry just prior to its opening into the Moray Firth.  Industry At the south east corner of the bay, is the former oil platform construction and fabrication yard, opened in 1972 by a joint venture of Brown & Root and Wimpey Construction. The fabrication yard was \\"mothballed\\" some years ago and was put up for sale by KBR in 2006. In 2012 the yard was taken over by the Global Energy Group and renamed Nigg Energy Park. Since the purchase of the fabrication yard by Global Energy Group in 2011 and with investment from the Scottish Government the area has begun to see a new influx of workers to the area again with the yard having plenty of work in the renewable energy sector and also in oil drilling rig refurbishment. In 2012 Global Energy Group set up a skills academy to create new jobs for local residents and young people and this has resulted in a fall in unemployment in the area and a welcome boost to the local economy. The extra work at Nigg has also seen an increase in work at the docks in Invergordon. In addition to this there is also an oil depot operated by Talisman Energy where there is a crude oil storage and processing depot for oil piped in from the Beatrice oil field in the Moray Firth.  Balintraid Pier  Probably the oldest pier on the Cromarty Firth built by Thomas Telford in 1821, The 9th report to the Commission on Highland Roads and Bridges, 1821, noted \\" a Landing Pier of massive dimensions has been erected for the express purpose of facilitating the importation of lime, coals and other articles of consumption in the very fertile district of Easter Ross, and for the exportation of corn and timber.\\" the cost is noted as amounting to \\"about Two Thousand Four Hundred Pounds; of which Mr Kenneth Macleay contributes a Moiety.\\" The pier still stands today but as of May 2018 the pier is in a very poor state and much of it is beginning to collapse.

From Latin meƒÅtus: a course, passing. also known as the external urethral orifice, is the opening of the urethra. It is the point where urine exits the urethra in males and in females and where semen exits the urethra in males. The meatus has varying degrees of sensitivity to touch. The meatus is located on the glans of the penis or in the vulval vestibule. In human males Drawing of the male internal sexual anatomy The male external urethral orifice is the external opening or urinary meatus, normally located at the tip of the glans penis, at its junction with the frenular delta. It presents as a vertical slit, possibly bounded on either side by two small labia-like projections, and continues longitudinally along the front aspect of the glans, which facilitates the flow of urine micturition. In some cases, the opening may be more rounded. This can occur naturally or may also occur as a side effect of excessive skin removal during circumcision. The meatus is a sensitive part of the male reproductive system. Meatal stenosis is a late complication of circumcision, which occurs in about 10‚Äì20 percent of newborn circumcised boys after the loss of the protection of the foreskin. In human females Lateral anatomy view of the female reproductive system The female external urethral orifice is the external opening of the urethra, from which urine is ejected during urination. It is located about behind the clitoris and immediately in front of the vagina in the vulval vestibule. It usually assumes the form of a short, sagittal cleft with slightly raised margins. To its left and right are the openings of the Skene's glands. Some evidence exists to suggest that the clitoral-urinary meatus distance (CUMD) in human females relates to the ease with which she may achieve orgasm through penetrative sex. Orgasm from penetration alone is observed to be more likely as CUMD decreases. In other mammals Unlike most other mammals, female spotted hyenas have a urinary meatus that is located on the clitoral glans. Clinical significance Congenital disorders of the meatus, in the male, include epispadias (the misplacement to the upper aspect) and hypospadias (the misplacement to the underside of the penis). A congenital misshaping can result in its narrowing (meatal stenosis), causing a partial or total urinary blockage or the bifurcation of the urinary stream. A urethral blockage can also be caused by foreign material, kidney stones, or bladder stones (lithiasis).

It lies on the north shore of the entrance to the Cromarty Firth.  Nigg Old Church  The present parish church is an 18th-century building on an early Christian site dating back to at least the 8th century. The Nigg Stone, one of the most elaborate stone monuments of early medieval western Europe, is preserved in a room at the west end of the church. This late 8th century Pictish cross-slab formerly stood in the churchyard, but was moved indoors for preservation in recent years. The nearby manse is one of the oldest to survive in Scotland, dating back to the first half of the 17th century. It is now privately owned and no longer used as the parish minister's residence. Nigg Old has its odd and curious features. In the churchyard is the Cholera Stone, dating from the cholera epidemic of 1832. One of the elders, on coming out of the church, saw a cloud of vapour hovering above the ground. He believed it to be a cloud of cholera, threw a blanket or cloth over it and placed this large stone on top to keep it from escaping. And inside the church, according to one tradition, the beadle (church officer) allowed an illicit still to be kept in the space under the pulpit.  Marine fabrication yard  Nigg was the site of a crude oil storage and processing depot for oil piped in from the now abandoned Beatrice oil field in the Moray Firth and of a major multi user energy park including a dry dock operated by Global Energy Group. In the oil boom of the 1970s, the oil fabrication yard at Nigg was extremely busy with many of the skilled workers moving up from areas such as Glasgow. This resulted in what was called \\"Glasgow colonies\\" in towns such as Invergordon and Alness, with many of the families choosing to make the move permanent. This can be seen as even now with some of residents still possessing a Glaswegian accent. Since the purchase of the fabrication yard by Global Energy Group in 2011 and with investment from the Scottish Government the area has begun to see a new influx of workers to the area again with the yard having plenty of work in the renewable energy sector and also in oil drilling rig refurbishment. In 2012 Global Energy Group set up a skills academy to create new jobs for local residents and young people and this has resulted in a fall in unemployment in the area and a welcome boost to the local economy. The extra work at Nigg has also seen an increase in work at the docks in Invergordon. In March 2017, Global Energy submitted an application to the Scottish Government requesting the yard be made a private port. The order which was eventually granted, created Nigg Port and gave Global and Nigg Energy Park increased management powers over the quays, wharfs, enclosed dry dock and adjoining land area at Nigg, the ability to maintain and improve the facility through development rights powers, set reasonable charges for facility users, control goods and hazardous substances and manage the security of the port area. It also gives them the right to board vessels moored alongside the port facility or remove vessels, goods and vehicles within Nigg Port's boundaries. The order would give Global and Nigg Energy Park increased management powers over the quays, wharfs, enclosed dock and adjoining land area at Nigg, including the ability to maintain and improve the facility through development rights powers, set reasonable charges on facility users, control goods and hazardous substances and manage the security of the port area, and provide the right to board vessels moored alongside the port facility or remove vessels, goods and vehicles within the Port of Nigg.  Ferry service  The Nigg to Cromarty ferry route is often called The King‚Äôs Ferry ‚Äì the route taken by King James IV of Scotland when on pilgrimage to the shrine of St Duthac at Tain, doing so at least 18 times in the years between 1493 to 1513. It is the only ferry service from the Black Isle. The ferry crosses the entrance to the Cromarty Firth, one of the finest natural harbours in Europe and also an area rich in wildlife and world-famous for its dolphin population. The current service is operated by the , one of the smallest car ferries in Britain, carrying up to 16 passengers and 2 cars.

TaleSpin was previewed on The Disney Channel in May through July 1990,The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 8, no. 2 (typo in magazine: should be \\"no. 3\\"), May/June 1990: pp. 22, 34, 37, 46, 49-53, 57-59.The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 8, no. 3 (typo in magazine: should be \\"no. 4\\"), July/August 1990: pp. 45-47. and premiered in syndication in September of that year. Higher for Hire =Baloo= Baloo von Bruinwald XIII (voiced by Ed Gilbert) is the main character of the series, based primarily on the sloth bear from Disney's The Jungle Book, but with a flight cap and a yellow shirt (and four-fingered hands unlike in The Jungle Book where he had claws). Although lazy, slobbish, unreliable and always broke, he is also an excellent pilot and capable of the most daring maneuvers in the air. He flies a cargo plane called the Sea Duck. He will also selflessly come to the aid of those in need of help. His irresponsible behavior sometimes jeopardizes important situations, as seen in the episode \\"Your Baloo's in the Mail\\" when he fails to mail a winning ticket in the proper way, which puts Rebecca's ability to receive $100,000 in prize money at risk. He also has a penchant for getting into schemes that require him to dress up in drag to suit the situation, such as when he became Rebecca's \\"female\\" co-pilot Tan-Margaret (a play on Ann-Margret) in the episode \\"Feminine Air\\". Some of his mannerisms survive from The Jungle Book, including his nickname of \\"Papa Bear\\" by Kit, which Mowgli had given to him. He also calls Kit \\"Li'l Britches\\", as he did with Mowgli. In the first part of the episode \\"A Bad Reflection on You\\", Baloo gives his full name as \\"Baloo Bear\\" when introducing himself to a guard at Khan Tower. However, in the episode \\"The Balooest of the Bluebloods\\", it is revealed that Baloo comes from a prominent noble family and that Baloo's full designation is in fact \\"Baloo, Baron von Bruinwald XIII\\". However, he himself had been initially unaware, which raises the possibility that he was adopted. In this episode, he inherited $500 million in the form of an extravagant estate, which was taken from him to settle the matter of his family's impressively long history of owing back taxes, thus restoring the status quo. Baloo only once mentioned any family, in reference to a gramophone record that had belonged to his father. The name \\"Baloo\\" comes from the Hindi word for bear: bhƒÅl≈´ (, pronounced ). Gilbert replaced Phil Harris, who had originally been hired to reprise his role from The Jungle Book. At 85 years old, Harris had lost some of his comic timing, and producers concluded he would not be able to handle the load of a 65-episode series at his age and condition, nor were they in the position to chauffeur him to and from his home in Palm Springs, California, a two-hour trip in each direction, for each session.Voice actor decisions ‚Äì Baloo and Kit Jymn Magon, co-creator of TaleSpin who initially cast Harris for the role of Baloo: \\"his age was a factor. He didn't have the slick, con man timing anymore. I loved working with Phil, so I was distraught to inform management that he just wasn't going to work out for 65 episodes. (Besides, we had to chauffeur him to and from Palm Springs for the recording sessions ‚Äì a 4 hour round trip!!)\\" =Kit Cloudkicker= Kit Cloudkicker (voiced by R. J. Williams in some episodes, Alan Roberts in others) is a 12-year-old brown bear cub and the navigator aboard Baloo's plane, the Sea Duck. His first appearance was in the pilot episode and introductory television movie Plunder & Lightning. He was originally voiced by Alan Roberts who did his voice for 11 episodes that aired as a preview-run before the series' syndicated premiere. R. J. Williams voiced Kit for the rest of the series (including in the pilot episode Plunder & Lightning). His trademarks are a green sweater, a blue and red baseball cap worn backward and his ability to \\"cloud surf\\" (also referred to in the show as \\"cloud skiing\\"). The baseball cap was a gift to Kit from Baloo, as a sign of friendship and trust. In the episode \\"Flight School Confidential\\", Kit's height is revealed to be 3 feet 9 inches. Having lived with the air pirates under Don Karnage for one year prior to the start of the series, the introductory movie states that he left the air pirates because he \\"got sick\\" of them. Kit first encountered Baloo when he crashed into him in Louie's Place, and later rejoined Baloo by grabbing onto the Sea Duck in order to escape from the air pirates because they were trying to catch him. His ambition was to become a pilot and to purchase his own aircraft. Occasionally showing a selfish streak, Kit sometimes put his dreams ahead of those of his friends. Having lived on his own for most of his life, Kit's distrust of adults was apparent in the show. He warmed to Baloo only after being given the chance to fly the Sea Duck, and even then was ready to leave for greener pastures. Nevertheless, he looked upon the other members of the \\"Higher for Hire\\" company as a surrogate family, affectionately referring to Baloo as \\"Papa Bear\\" on occasion. He clearly demonstrated his fondness for Rebecca Cunningham's daughter Molly on a number of occasions throughout the show, having been seen giving Molly piggyback rides, and on one occasion rescuing her on his airfoil (the device Kit uses for cloud surfing ‚Äì see below). Baloo gives him the same nicknames, such as \\"Little Britches\\" that was bestowed on Mowgli from The Jungle Book. In the episode \\"Stormy Weather\\", Kit chastised Baloo saying, \\"You can't tell me what to do! You're not my dad!\\" This was a decision Kit would come to regret later in that episode. Kit had the ability to cloud surf using a crescent shaped metal device called an airfoil and a regular cord attached to the back of the Sea Duck or another plane, thus allowing him to \\"surf\\" in a similar fashion to someone wakeboarding or water skiing. It was not made clear where Kit learned this skill, but he demonstrates at numerous times throughout the various episodes that he is incredibly adept at it. He can also use his board to free glide without being towed by a plane. Baloo would often give his permission for Kit to be towed behind the Sea Duck when appropriate, trusting in Kit's skill to let him have some fun. Baloo also had enough confidence in Kit to keep himself safe on the airfoil when separated and under attack, or when Kit had to be outside for something important. Outside such situations however, he did not like Kit to take unnecessary risks, such as doing dangerous tricks or stunts. It is not exactly known when, where or how Kit was orphaned, but in the associated comics, it was revealed he spent some of his life on the streets and later a village of hobos (not unlike the Hoovervilles of actuality) prior to the series. He also claims that he never knew his parents, which could mean he had lost them when he was too young to remember, such as during infancy. Also his orphaning could be based on the fact that orphans were common during the nineteen-thirties, as the Great Depression was responsible for many children being orphaned, even though no reference to the Great Depression was made in the show. =Rebecca Cunningham= Rebecca Cunningham (voiced by Sally Struthers) is a petite brown bear with long brown hair in a 1940s style, usually wears a white turtleneck sweater, and a purple-red jacket and matching slacks. She is nicknamed \\"Becky\\", \\"Beckers\\", \\"Beck\\" (used only once in episode \\"A Star is Torn\\"), and/or \\"BC\\" (used once in \\"War of the Weirds\\") by Baloo which at first she highly resented being called, but soon grew accustomed to with affection (in return, she calls him \\"Fly Boy\\" on occasion). She is an unassumingly attractive, yet shrewd businesswoman with an MBA. Rebecca bought out Baloo's Air Service and his plane in the introductory episode Plunder & Lightning when the pilot failed to pay his bank loan, and renamed the business \\"Higher for Hire\\". Although she originally relegated herself to the administrative and sales functions of the business, the series shows she eventually learns to be a capable would-be pilot in her own right. Baloo's laziness and carefree attitude towards his responsibilities often infuriates her explosive temper, despite having some possible feelings toward him at times which does come up as a blistering jealous streak, such as in the episode \\"A Star is Torn\\". Rebecca can sometimes be too quick to jump to conclusions and judge people. Rebecca lives with her daughter Molly in an apartment in an upscale part of Cape Suzette, one which incorporates a waterfall in its design. She occasionally concocts outrageous schemes to quickly make extra money, such as when she buys a pig to sniff out truffles instead of a new pontoon which the Sea Duck needs in the episode \\"The Bigger They Are, the Louder They Oink\\". She sometimes acts as a maternal figure for Kit Cloudkicker. However, in the episode \\"It Came from Beneath the Sea Duck\\", Rebecca's confidence in Kit was put to the test. While Kit was babysitting her daughter Molly, the girl accidentally got separated from him when the wagon she was on rolled down a hill and Kit had to chase it all the way to the docks. When Rebecca heard that her young daughter had been so far from home, she blamed Kit and would not let him explain what happened, accusing him of being \\"reckless and irresponsible\\". Later in the episode, her confidence in him was restored when he saved her daughter from a giant squid (voiced by Peter Cullen), and she apologized to him for being too quick to judge him. =Molly Cunningham= Molly Elizabeth Cunningham (voiced by Janna Michaels) is Rebecca's yellow-furred, 6-year-old daughter. She is an adventurous child who even at her age, is not afraid to speak her mind just like her mother, who nicknames her \\"Honey\\" and \\"Pumpkin\\" (while Baloo calls her \\"Button Nose\\"). Molly has a thing for her favorite ice cream brand \\"Frosty Pep\\", and sometimes pretends she is \\"Danger Woman\\" (the action/adventure heroine of a popular kids radio program modeled somewhere along the lines of a proto-Wonder Woman) while seeking adventure along with Kit and Baloo. She carries a doll named \\"Lucy\\". She often outwits adversaries much older than her. Her middle name, Elizabeth, is revealed in the episode \\"Mommy for a Day\\", and Molly is the only character to have any middle name revealed. Molly has taken a special interest in snow, which is problematic since it never snows in Cape Suzette. No mention was ever made of Molly's father, as series creator Jymn Magon reportedly said that Rebecca is either a widow or divorced, although at a 1998 U.S. fan convention Q&A; online chat he did state in roundabout tones that she is actually divorced as originally written in the first TaleSpin press release. However this would clash with the comic The Long Flight Home which, although more centered toward Kit's past, states that her father died. =Wildcat= Wildcat (voiced by Pat Fraley) is a clueless and gangly lion who typically wears a mechanic's outfit. Although very childlike, he is ultimately a mechanical genius. For example, he can fix a smashed telephone in under ten seconds. He speaks with a slight lisp. Wildcat has a special place in his heart for dinosaurs as they are his favorite animal. He is also fond of pets and toys. He is honest and truthful, but at times too truthful, much to the annoyance of Baloo. Air Pirates =Don Karnage= Don Karnage (voiced by Jim Cummings, and by Jaime Camil in DuckTales) is the leader of a crew of air pirates and captain of the massive hybrid airship, the Iron Vulture, which serves as an airborne aircraft carrier. He is the main antagonist in the series. According to series creator Jymn Magon, he is a wolf, but has orangish-brown fur reminiscent of a fox. He wears a blue Napoleonic-style high-collared captain's tailcoat (with a red interior, red cuffs, and gold trim and buttons, and with the upper-front part unbuttoned and folded down as a small red triangular fold on his chest), a red belt, light bluish-gray pants, and dark-gray boots with gray cuffs. He is armed with a cutlass, which he wears on the left side of his waist, so that he can easily access it with his right hand. He speaks with an accent that is a blend of Spanish, Italian, and French accents. He pronounces /t/ and /d/ as dental consonants rather than the normal English alveolar consonants. He is a skilled pilot and ruthlessly cunning with an oversized ego that makes him blunder with whatever scheme or raid he conducts with his pirates. When dogfighting or raiding, he flies a hybrid fighter plane that appears to be based on a low-wing monoplane but with wings added so that it is actually a triplane. Voice actor Jim Cummings has cited Desi Arnaz's performance as Ricky Ricardo from the TV sitcom I Love Lucy as an inspiration. =Other Pirates= *Mad Dog (voiced by Charlie Adler) is a scrawny dachshund with a \\"Fu Manchu\\" style mustache who wears aviator goggles on his head. He is Don Karnage's first mate (second-in-command) and the smarter of the two sidekick henchmen, which isn't saying much. He has a whiny, nasal voice and is usually paired with Dumptruck. *Dumptruck (voiced by Chuck McCann) is a large stocky canine who is the second mate (third-in-command) of Don Karnage, though he made himself captain of the Iron Vulture in Karnage's absence in the episode \\"Stuck on You\\", and (true to his name) is rather unintelligent. He is a hulking Mastiff who speaks with a thick Swedish-Dutch accent and wears a top hat with a purple feather on the left side. He is frequently seen in the company of Mad Dog. *Gibber (voiced by Chuck McCann) is a pirate who whispers advice and other information into Karnage's ear. He has never spoken a word louder than his mumbles. *Hacksaw (voiced by Charlie Adler) is a big yellowish colored husky pirate who has sticks of dynamite strapped around his arms and has his ears tucked together in a ring. He speaks with a whining Australian accent. *Ratchet (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is the mechanic of the group, who helped put together the lightning gun in the pilot episode Plunder & Lightning. *Hal (voiced by Frank Welker) is a large, overweight tan cat. Seen in only a few episodes, his only major role in the series (and probably the only one where he spoke) was when he accompanied Mad Dog and Dumptruck on their mission to take over the cliff guns in the episode \\"Jumping the Guns\\". His name stemmed from a throwaway line spoken by Don Karnage in Plunder & Lightning: \\"Open the bomb bay doors please, Hal\\", which is a reference to the famous line spoken by Dave in 2001: A Space Odyssey: \\"Open the pod bay doors please, HAL\\". *Sadie (voiced by Chuck McCann) is a short, fat brown pirate who has a grey mustache and wears a Viking helmet. *Jock (voiced by Tony Jay) is a black Scottish terrier and head engineer of the Iron Vulture who appears in the second part of the episode \\"A Bad Reflection on You\\". The TaleSpin DVD release of Volume 1 verified his name in the hearing-impaired English subtitles as being \\"Jock\\". Due to his thick Scottish burr, his name sounded like it was \\"Jacques\\" instead. Don Karnage mistakenly calls him \\"Scotty\\", a tongue-in-cheek reference by the writers to the famous Star Trek character portrayed by James Doohan. Moreover, \\"Jock\\" rhymes with \\"Spock\\", another classic Star Trek character, who was portrayed by Leonard Nimoy. Jock originally is from the Walt Disney film Lady and the Tramp. *Will is a one- time gag pirate seen very briefly in the episode \\"In Search of Ancient Blunders\\": Don Karnage ordered his crew to \\"Fire at will!\\". Ever obedient, they began shooting at Will as he ran past Karnage, instead of shooting at the Sea Duck which was what Karnage meant. Thembrians *Colonel Ivanod Spigot (voiced by Michael Gough) is a bluish-colored warthog (as are all Thembrians), who is unnaturally short with a Napoleon complex and a prominent lisp, and who is the head of Thembria's \\"Glorious People's\\" Air Force. He never took a single flying lesson in his life, until he accidentally gave the High Marshall the idea to shoot every commanding officer in the Thembrian Air Force who failed an upcoming flight exam in the episode \\"Flying Dupes\\". He considers himself to be highly famous, and always introduces himself thus: \\"Perhaps you've heard of me?\\" He can easily be outsmarted by Baloo and Kit, as seen in the episode \\"The Idol Rich\\" when they reclaim an idol that Spigot had stolen from them. His grandmother was, apparently, devoured by polar bears, though whether as punishment for losing a national artifact (as that is the crime that warrants that punishment) or accident is unknown. *Sergeant Dunder (voiced by Lorenzo Music) is Spigot's second-in-command. He is gregarious and somewhat dense like Wildcat, but is nowhere near as self-centered and ruthless as Spigot. In fact, he is close friends with Baloo and Kit. He selflessly takes the blame for many of Colonel Spigot's numerous failures, and appears to be a devoted soldier. *The High Marshal (voiced by Jack Angel) is the highest- ranking military official in Thembria, and appears to serve as the country's strongman. He is dour, humorless and dislikes Spigot for his incompetence. He is married to an equally humorless unnamed female Thembrian who is strong enough to knock him out with a single punch. There are few problems the High Marshal does not solve without the threat of violence and death. *Professor Crackpotkin (voiced by John Stephenson) is a mad scientist imprisoned at Bedevilled Island Maximum Security Prison for terrorist acts in the episode \\"Gruel and Unusual Punishment\\". He hates gruel, and has been shown to be willing to commit suicide in order to destroy Thembria's gruel reserves with no regard for the resultant collateral damage. His name is a reference to Peter Kropotkin, a famous communist leader. *Warden Slammer (voiced by Allan Melvin) is the stern warden of Bedevilled Island Maximum Security Prison in the episode \\"Gruel and Unusual Punishment\\". Although at first he seems ruthless, he is eventually revealed to be a more-or-less fair and levelheaded individual. *Bobbo (voiced by Edan Gross) is a 12-year-old boy who, along with Kit, enrolls in what seems to be a Thembrian flight school for 12-year-olds in the episode \\"Flight School Confidential\\". He meets and befriends Kit at the recruitment center, and the two boys become bunkmates at the supposed flight school. His height is 3 feet 2 inches. *Wally (voiced by Jack Angel) is a manager of a Thembrian bomb factory who plots to send a bomb addressed to the High Marshal in the episode \\"Flying Dupes\\". He tricks Baloo into delivering the package containing the bomb, but he never really wants the bomb to reach the High Marshal. Instead, he wants the Thembrian border guards to find it before it can reach the High Marshal, so as to put the blame on Baloo and trigger a war with Cape Suzette which would increase bomb sales for his factory. Things do not go as planned, however, and the bomb does make it to the High Marshal, but in the end it is Wally who gets blown up (and survives). His fate after this is unknown. *Mick (voiced by Jim MacGeorge) is an associate of Wally who plots with him to send a bomb addressed to the High Marshal in the episode \\"Flying Dupes\\". He and Wally are both managers for the same bomb factory. Khan Industries =Shere Khan= Shere Khan (voiced by Tony Jay) is a Bengal tiger who also appeared in The Jungle Book, but here stands upright and wears a business suit. He sports retractable claws, which is a rarity in the show. He is sometimes accompanied by an unnamed emaciated tiger \\"yes-man\\" office aide. Khan is an extremely wealthy businessman and the head of the corporation Khan Industries (sometimes called Khan Enterprises) which is the dominant economic force in the city of Cape Suzette. Dour, humorless and slightly arrogant because of his wealth and position, he takes enjoyment out of running small companies out of business (Higher for Hire is sometimes on his hit list) with a sense of ruthlessness to skirt around the law as he chooses. He also likes to feed tiny insects to the many carnivorous plants he grows in his office. He once even made a deal with Don Karnage and his air pirates to create an artificial oil shortage so he could extort higher prices from the public in the episode \\"On a Wing and a Bear\\". He has a well- armed air force and navy, complete with battleships (referred to as \\"gunships\\"). This is mainly to protect his shipping and business interests worldwide. However, despite his ruthless and self-interested behavior, Khan is willing to act nobly at times, such as ordering his forces into the air to protect Cape Suzette from air pirate attacks. He is also shown to respect Baloo's piloting skills, most notably in the episode \\"From Here to Machinery\\", in which Khan's plane had been ambushed by Don Karnage's air pirates and the robotic pilot (created by the sleazy Professor Martin Torque) refused to deviate from its flight plan due to its programming, causing an arriving Baloo to forcibly remove the robot and take control of the plane (with Khan's permission) in order to engage in his usual dogfight with the pirates, resulting in the reinstatement of his laid off pilots. He also refers to Baloo as \\"a pilot to be reckoned with\\" in Plunder & Lightning after Baloo manages to destroy Don Karnage's lightning gun and severely damage the Iron Vulture. The name \\"Shere Khan\\" is derived from Hindi: Shere or Sher, i.e., a lion/tiger (, , pronounced ), and Khan, i.e., a South Asian title or surname (, , ). =Others= *Buzz (voiced by Kenneth Mars) is a short purple-haired bird of indeterminate species who is Khan's eccentric in-house inventor as well as an old friend of Baloo's. A self-described \\"loyal company man,\\" he is also the captain of the company chess team. Buzz's most noted invention is a prototype helicopter which promises to allow his employer to be the first marketer of a revolutionary new kind of aircraft. He appeared in the episodes \\"Baloo Thunder\\" and \\"Bullethead Baloo\\". *Mrs. Snarly (voiced by Jennifer Darling) is Khan's ruthless and loyal elderly secretary who appeared in the episodes \\"On a Wing and a Bear\\", \\"Baloo Thunder\\", and \\"Bullethead Baloo\\". She is (apparently) a shrew. *Doctor Debolt (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is Khan's head scientist, and a slightly nervous rabbit, who led the effort that created the sub-electron amplifier to power Khan's industrial sectors, which was later stolen by Don Karnage and eventually used to power the lightning gun in the pilot episode Plunder & Lightning. In the episode, the name \\"Debolt\\" is never mentioned and he is simply referred to as \\"Doctor\\". However, his name is revealed to be Doctor Debolt in the comic book adaptation of the episode.Weiss, Bobbi J.G. (adaptation from a teleplay by Len Uhley) (w), Quartieri, Cosme (p), Valenti, Carlos, Robert Bat (i). \\"Take Off: Part Three ‚Äì Khan Job\\" Disney‚Äôs TaleSpin Limited Series #3 (March 1991), W. D. Publications, Inc., p. 24, , Cover code: KB 0690, Story code: KB 0490 *Douglas \\"Dougie\\" Benson (voiced by Mark L. Taylor) is a tabby cat and an investor working for Khan Industries who lost his job as a result of a combination of ridiculously bad investments (like glow-in-the-dark sunglasses), forging Khan's signature and flagrant misuse of Khan's private air force for personal gain in the episode \\"Louie's Last Stand\\". His quick temper and somewhat clumsy antics were a constant source of laughs for those around him (especially Khan's elite pilots). This laughter was something he absolutely could not stand, and he responded to it by repeatedly shouting \\"Stop laughing!\\" at the top of his lungs. *Walters (voiced by Phil Crowley) is a gray panther investor who was Douglas Benson's aide and confidant in the episode \\"Louie's Last Stand\\". *Mr. Perry (voiced by Michael Bell) is a scheming and sharply dressed cheetah employee who was secretly cooperating with Khan's rival Mr. Sultan (the head of the Miniversal Corporation) to steal a top-secret helicopter from Khan Industries in the episode \\"Baloo Thunder\\". *Garth (voiced by Patric Zimmerman) and his unnamed partner (voiced by Tony Pope) are Khan's well-dressed panther and tiger goons respectively, who he sent to teach Baloo a lesson about greed after the bear foolishly took advantage of Khan's generosity in the episode \\"Save the Tiger\\". Garth's knees were in dire peril when he shouted angrily at Baloo during a phone call with his boss unintentionally, but he apparently avoided being the target of his employer's wrath. *Captain Hotspur (voiced by Frank Welker) is the gravelly-voiced lion commander of one of Khan's gunships in the episode \\"A Bad Reflection on You\\", in which he was sent on a mission to solve the mysterious disappearances of Khan's cargo planes in the ultra-secret \\"Master Run\\" route near the towering Twin Spires, which turned out to be caused by Don Karnage's air pirates. Hotspur, much like Khan, is highly impressed with Baloo's abilities after seeing him in action flying the Sea Duck while setting off a mine in order to warn the ship in the nick of time that it was being dangerously lured into a minefield, and performing daring aerial maneuvers while dodging the pirates. Other characters *Louie (voiced by Jim Cummings) is a fun-loving orangutan who also appeared in The Jungle Book, but here he wears a Hawaiian shirt, a straw hat and lei, and owns an island nightclub and motel called \\"Louie's Place\\", located near but outside the protection of Cape Suzette. It also serves as a refueling station/pit stop area for pilots. He has numerous monkey employees that help him run his establishment. He is Baloo's best friend (not the case in The Jungle Book but like in the later Jungle Cubs) but sometimes can be competitive with him when it comes to women, treasure-hunting and, on occasion, in business matters. As revealed in the episode \\"Louie's Last Stand\\", his hold on the island is somewhat tenuous, though through his own ingenuity and the aid of his friends he has managed to avoid losing it. *Louise L'Amour (voiced by Jim Cummings) is Louie's wealthy ace aviator aunt who loves to party, and who appears in the episode \\"The Ransom of Red Chimp\\". Much to her nephew's chagrin she wreaks havoc everywhere she goes (particularly in his place of business), calls him \\"Louis\\", and aggressively chases handsome men who speak with accents (like Don Karnage and dashing French pilot Jacques Toujour) and ruins their lives. She suffers a broken heart quite easily yet always bounces back with a new flame at the ready. Her name is a play on the Western novelist/adventurer Louis L'Amour, and the title and plot of the episode in which she appears are loosely based on O. Henry's short story \\"The Ransom of Red Chief\\". *The Jungle Aces Secret Midnight Club (often simply referred to as The Jungle Aces) is a club of young wannabe pilots, of whom Kit Cloudkicker is a member. Other club members include club leader Ernie (a hyena; voiced by Whitby Hertford), a hippo, a rabbit, and a bird. The club rules state that all members must have had an adventure before joining, a fact that temporarily prevented Oscar Vandersnoot from joining until he had an adventure in the episode \\"Captains Outrageous\\". They briefly changed their name to \\"The Bullethead Brigade\\" in the episode \\"Bullethead Baloo\\". *Oscar Vandersnoot (voiced by Ben Ryan Ganger) is a short, geeky-looking yellow bear cub who wears a formal jacket, shirt, bowtie, and thick glasses in the episode \\"Captains Outrageous\\". He is an upper-crust na√Øve friend of Kit's who wants to join his Jungle Aces Secret Midnight Club, much to the consternation of the other members since one rule stipulates that a person must have experienced a real adventure in order to join the club. An attempt by Kit to help him join is thwarted by Don Karnage, who wants to kidnap Oscar in order to force his rich parents, in particular his very overprotective mother, to pay a hefty ransom for him. Kit, Baloo and Wildcat hatch up a plan in which Baloo takes Oscar on a ride in the Sea Duck while, unbeknownst to Oscar, Kit and Wildcat dress up as pirates and fly out in a biplane in order to pretend to attack the Sea Duck so as to give Oscar an \\"adventure\\", and thus get him into the club. (Rebecca and Mrs. Vandersnoot require a little convincing before Oscar is allowed to ride in the Sea Duck.) Before the plan can succeed, however, Kit and Wildcat are captured by the real pirates, who then launch a real attack on the Sea Duck, resulting in Oscar and Baloo actually being held hostage, along with Kit and Wildcat, by the air pirate leader. In the end, Oscar manages to outsmart Karnage, saves himself and his friends, becomes a local hero, and becomes a member and honorary president of The Jungle Aces Secret Midnight Club. *Trader Moe (voiced by Cummings) is a diminutive international criminal alligator with a short temper who is always accompanied by a pair of hulking and very dim-witted heavies, a rhinoceros and a gorilla (voiced by McCann and Cummings respectively), who are only known collectively as \\"The Goons\\". He appeared in the episodes \\"Time Waits for No Bear\\", \\"The Golden Sprocket of Friendship\\", and \\"Double or Nothing\\". His name is a reference to the grocery store, Trader Joe's. *El Gato (voiced by Cummings) is a large, maniacal swarthy-looking feline with a thick Spanish accent and a nasty temper, who wears a colorful poncho, a Mexican- styled sombrero, and braided hair in the episode \\"Destiny Rides Again\\". Accompanied by a pet crow and flying on a giant condor (both voiced by Frank Welker), he is persistent on obtaining the Idol of Doom (a golden llama- statuette talisman famed for having great mystical powers for those who control it) which he wants to use for evil and almost succeeds when he tries to wrangle it from Baloo and Kit's unwanted possession. *Professor O'Bowens (voiced by Patrick Pinney) is a chimpanzee archaeologist who discovers the \\"Idol of the Spirit Switcher\\" in an ancient, booby-trapped temple in the episode \\"A Baloo Switcheroo\\". When Don Karnage and his pirates try to steal the idol, O'Bowens escapes with it and gives it to Baloo and Kit for safekeeping, telling them to fly off while he stays behind to distract the pirates. Later on, after the idol causes Baloo to switch bodies with Kit and Rebecca to switch bodies with Karnage, O'Bowens joins Baloo, Kit, and Rebecca, and goes with them to help resolve the situation. He makes a cameo appearance in the episode \\"Destiny Rides Again\\". His clothing and the whip that he carries are references to Indiana Jones, as is the fact that he takes an idol from a booby-trapped temple. *Ignatius, a.k.a. Ignatz (voiced by S. Scott Bullock), is an intelligent semi-anthropomorphic parrot who knows the location of a large treasure in the episode \\"Polly Wants a Treasure\\". He and Baloo do not get along, but he befriends Kit, and the two of them go looking for the treasure. However, Don Karnage wants to get Ignatz so that the parrot can tell him where the treasure is. *Seymour (voiced by Hamilton Camp) is the red wolf owner of the aquarium/theme park \\"Seymour's See More Seaquarium\\" in the episode \\"All's Whale That Ends Whale\\". He abuses and neglects the animals in his care, including a whale named Moby Dimple (voiced by Frank Welker) who is befriended by Kit. Kit and Baloo become concerned about Dimple's wellbeing, much to Seymour's annoyance. Kit and Baloo eventually help Dimple escape from the theme park, and Seymour ends up getting arrested for possessing an illegal type of harpoon. *Inspector Burrow (voiced by Cummings) is an otter and an inspector who works for ACHOO (the Agency Concerned with the Happiness of Oceanic Oddities) in the episode \\"All's Whale That Ends Whale\\". He inspects Seymour's theme park, but due to illusions created by Seymour and his employees, Burrow fails to notice anything wrong with the park. Later on, Burrow spots Seymour with an illegal harpoon, and leads the police to arrest Seymour. *Barney O'Turret (voiced by Angel) is a short and grizzled, but good- natured retiree pig cliff gun guard in Cape Suzette who wears overalls and a captain's cap, and who worked on the cliffs for 50 years and never fired a shot (but claims to, according to his catchphrase, \\"have seen it done a million times\\"). He is clueless and constantly underfoot as Baloo and Louie try to stop a plot by the air pirates to launch a raid on the city when they overpower the guards in order to let the Iron Vulture pass beyond the protective outer cliffs. Despite his bumbling, he along with the pilot and nightclub owner, manages to save the day. He appears in the episode \\"Jumping the Guns\\". *MacKnee (voiced by Cummings) is a large, child-hating koala with a nasty temper and a gruff Australian accent who appears in the episode \\"Mommy for a Day\\". This hunter/poacher will go to any lengths to bag the perfect beast (even endangering the lives of others in the name of profit), in particular when he captures, loses and re-hunts a mythical but gentle Inkara, who Molly befriends and names Henry (voiced by Frank Welker) and whom she protects from MacKnee's clutches. *Covington (voiced by Cummings) is a smooth- talking, debonair, light-gray panther con artist who wears a moustache, sharp clothing and a toupee in the episode \\"Molly Coddled\\". During a high-speed boat chase around Cape Suzette's inner harbor, he stashed an ancient wooden cat talisman that lead to a rich treasure on Skull Island (which isn't exactly like the real Skull Island very much) in the Sea Duck to hide it from two criminal badger associates he recently double crossed. When Molly discovered it and took it for a doll the next morning, he charmed Rebecca's heart in order to get to the doll. Molly saw him for what he was and knowing that he was really not interested in her mother, did everything she could to drive him away and keep him from getting his hands on the doll. After a series of tangles and shin-kicks from the little girl, he recovered the wooden figurine and briefly possessed the ruby statuette it pointed the way to, only to be foiled by Molly who finally exposed him as a fraud to Rebecca. A little later on, after accidentally letting go of the ruby during a greedy struggle near a bubbling hot mud pit, he was finally caught by his ex-partners and received (off-screen) his just deserts from them. *Daring Dan Dawson (voiced by Cam Clarke) is the sleazy owner and lead performer of an aerial circus in the episode \\"Stormy Weather\\". He appears to be a ferret wearing an old fashioned aviator's cap and goggles. He nearly destroyed the father/son bond between Kit and Baloo through manipulation and outright lies, briefly convincing Kit to run away and join his circus. *Prince Neverhasbeenbroke (voiced by Cummings) is an eccentric but kindly hyena ruler of an unnamed Middle Eastern desert country who requests Higher for Hire to deliver a large iceberg to his country in order to create a ski slope near his palace in the episode \\"I Only Have Ice for You\\". The crew manage to pull off the delivery, despite being temporarily hijacked by Don Karnage's air pirates who think that diamonds are hidden in it, and a know-it-all Rebecca who flies the Sea Duck while delivering it due to Baloo's temporarily suspended license. He wears a turban and tunic, and speaks with a stereotypical Indian accent. He also has his own harem which is shown briefly with him during a cameo appearance in the episode \\"The Golden Sprocket of Friendship\\". *Howard Huge (voiced by Adler) is a rich but maniacal hippopotamus airplane designer appearing in the episode \\"Bearly Alive\\". When Baloo encountered him, he was kidnapping pilots and stripping their planes for parts and materials to build a gigantic flying wing, which he called the \\"Titanium Turkey\\". His name is an obvious pun on famed aviation pioneer Howard Hughes. *Jack Case (voiced by Brian Cummings) is a semi-villainous rabbit and wannabe spy who appeared in the episode \\"A Spy in the Ointment\\". He is actually a mailman who accidentally sent the wrong package to the Thembrian High Marshal. Planning to switch the wrong package for the right one, he convinced Rebecca that he was a government spy and that as a matter of national security he needed to be flown into Thembria. Shortly afterward, it was revealed that Case was a fraud: the package contained expensive fishing worms for the High Marshall. Case endangered Baloo and Rebecca by getting them caught up in his espionage fantasies and making Colonel Spigot think they were involved in a bomb plot against the High Marshall, and in return they left him behind when they fled Thembria. Case is last seen in the custody of Thembrian forces, and his fate after this is unknown. *Doctor Axolotl (voiced by Rodger Bumpass) is a psychotic lizard inventor who sought revenge against Shere Khan with his robot, the Mechanical Electric Laborer or M.E.L. (voiced by David Lodge), which he reprogrammed to be highly destructive and nearly unstoppable in the episode \\"Bullethead Baloo\\". *Doctor Zibaldo (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) is a short, manic fox mad scientist who invented a shrink ray for the purpose of fitting his clothes into luggage easier in the episode \\"The Incredible Shrinking Molly\\". After a mishap in which Molly Cunningham was accidentally shrunk, he abandoned his research in favor of a new idea: television. Needless to say, Baloo was not impressed with this idea. An interesting fact about Doctor Zibaldo is that the voice Castellaneta used to play him is the same voice he used to play Megavolt in Darkwing Duck. *Colonel Grogg (voiced by Bell) is a jingoistic, paranoid and overly excitable military intelligence officer spaniel who appeared in the episode \\"War of the Weirds\\". Obsessed with the \\"threat\\" of an alien invasion, he clandestinely monitored and recorded Baloo's radio transmissions during his phony flight to Mars, which, unbeknownst to Grogg was actually a lame attempt to scam a two-week vacation at Lake Flacid out of Rebecca. He subsequently became convinced that a Martian invasion was imminent after Baloo faked a Martian attack over the radio in order to keep Rebecca from continually calling him. Overzealous in stopping the Martians and threatening to put those responsible in jail if it proved to be a hoax, he dragged Rebecca ‚Äî who was in on the \\"invasion\\" in order to teach her pilot a lesson about lying ‚Äî and Wildcat along to the lake. After seeing the convincing light show put on by Baloo and Kit, he went into a frenzy and attacked Baloo's camp with machine gun fire and grenades. He was soon confronted by Baloo (in a Martian outfit) and saw him \\"attack\\" Rebecca with a \\"flesh-melting ooze gun\\" that squirts guacamole on her. Terrified, Grogg fled from the scene to bring reinforcements led by his bulldog uncle general Bucky (voiced by John Stephenson). Unfortunately for Grogg, upon his return to the lake, not only were there no signs of an invasion (Martian or otherwise), but the only people there (actually the Higher for Hire crew posing as a \\"family\\" out on a camping trip) claimed to have seen nothing either. Embarrassed and convinced that his nephew was hallucinating (again), the general quickly busted Grogg down in rank to private, much to his disillusionment. *Professor Martin Torque (voiced by Patrick Gorman) is a Doberman inventor who sought to replace every pilot in Cape Suzette with his Auto-Aviator (voiced by Fraley), a coldly efficient robotic pilot that was bought by Shere Khan in the episode \\"From Here to Machinery\\". The result was that every freelance cargo service in the city (including Higher for Hire) was put out of business, and every pilot (freelance or otherwise) was put out of work. After his attempt flopped in an incident with the air pirates (due to the robots' programing rendering them unable to deviate from their course), he attempted to sell his reprogrammed machines to uninterested Thembrian housewives at a miserable post in the middle of nowhere. *Babyface Half Nelson (voiced by Camp) is a bulldog gangster who tricked Baloo into helping him escape police custody in the episode \\"Bringing Down Babyface\\". When he is not in police custody, he lives with his mother Mrs. Half Nelson and is sometimes accompanied by two goons (voiced by Ed Gilbert). His name is a reference to Baby Face Nelson. *Mrs. Half Nelson (voiced by Billie Hayes) is Babyface Half Nelson's mother in the episode \\"Bringing Down Babyface\\". *Detective Thursday (voiced by Angel) is a hard-boiled canine detective who apparently runs a secret branch of the Cape Suzette police force, which is headquartered beneath a Laundromat in the episode \\"Vowel Play\\". He is highly reminiscent of Humphrey Bogart, and his name is a clear reference to Joe Friday. His main underling is Officer Gertalin. *Heimlich Menudo (voiced by Mars) is a leopard criminal featured in the episode \\"Vowel Play\\", and who is absolutely obsessed with diamonds, to the point that he practically worships them and even has diamonds for teeth. He and his weasel henchman Weazel (voiced by David L. Lander) tried to steal all the diamonds in Cape Suzette using a highly ambitious plan he called \\"the Heimlich Maneuver\\". *Officer Gertalin (voiced by Danny Mann) is a dog police officer and the main underling of Detective Thursday in the episode \\"Vowel Play\\". An unnamed police officer (voiced by Camp) who looks almost identical to Gertalin but has a different voice appears in the episode \\"Bringing Down Babyface\\", but it is unclear whether it is Gertalin or a separate officer. Likewise, an officer who resembles Gertalin makes a non- speaking appearance near the end of the episode \\"All's Whale That Ends Whale\\", in which he participates in the arrest of Seymour for possessing an illegal harpoon. *Officer Malarkey (voiced by Cummings) is a pig police officer who speaks with an Irish accent in the episode \\"Bringing Down Babyface\\". An unnamed pig police officer also makes a brief non-speaking appearance in the episode \\"Vowel Play\\", but it is unclear whether it is Malarkey or a separate officer. Likewise, an officer who resembles Malarkey makes a non-speaking appearance near the end of the episode \\"All's Whale That Ends Whale\\", in which he participates in the arrest of Seymour for possessing an illegal harpoon. *Tiny (voiced by Cummings) is an exceptionally large and tall polar bear and the owner and bartender of \\"Tiny's Grill\\", a restaurant and bar frequented by gangsters in the episode \\"Bringing Down Babyface\\". An alleyway behind Tiny's restaurant features a manhole that is the entrance to Babyface Half Nelson's sewer hideout. *Mr. Sultan (voiced by Corey Burton) is the head of the Miniversal Corporation, the rival of Shere Khan's corporation Khan Industries. He is an elderly tiger who paid Mr. Perry to steal Buzz's top secret helicopter prototype and apparently planned to pass it off as his own company's design. He appears in the episode \\"Baloo Thunder\\". *Kitten Kaboodle (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is a seductive blond feline Starrywood (read \\"Hollywood\\") starlet with a husky Lauren Bacall-like voice who acts like a femme fatale and can manipulate any hapless male under her spell in the episode \\"A Star is Torn\\". She became a wedge between Baloo and Rebecca's relationship when he saved Kaboodle's life in an accident during a street film shoot and hires him to be a stunt pilot for her next film that is being plagued by a series of accidents by a mysterious saboteur who Rebecca discovers to be Kaboodle herself. Kaboodle was sabotaging her own films in order to boost her sagging popularity and poor acting skills. She outed herself during the failed plane accident she set up for the smitten Baloo (who gave her the nickname \\"Kiki\\") and was subsequently taken in by the police. She also had a cameo appearance in the episode \\"Louie's Last Stand\\". *Katie Dodd (voiced by Ellen Gerstell) is a vixen archaeologist who discovered the lost city of Tinabula in the desert nation of Ghaphia in the episode \\"For Whom the Bell Klangs\\". This tall, feisty and voluptuous redhead has as much attitude as she does in looks and intelligence, since she is prone to stand-offish behavior and not afraid to tell any man to go jump in a lake. However, this did not stop Baloo and Louie from showing off for her in a futile attempt to compete for her attentions. *Myra (voiced by Liz Georges) is a petite brunette vixen dressed in khakis, a pith helmet and wears square-rimmed glasses, and is the State Archaeologist and Minister of Culture for the tiny desert country of Aridia in the episode \\"In Search of Ancient Blunders\\". A genuinely nice and very intelligent woman, her sunny disposition is nearly the exact polar opposite of Katie Dodd's. She enlists Baloo and Wildcat to help find a lost pyramid, in order to create a tourist attraction for her impoverished country. She is normally slow to anger, but not afraid to stand up and show some backbone when it really counts. *Princess Lotta L'Amour (voiced by Kath Soucie) is the vixen crown princess of the Middle-Eastern Kingdom of Macadamia who is smart, beautiful and strong in comparison to her seemingly dim-witted monarch rabbit father King Amuck in the episode \\"The Road to Macadamia\\". She not only becomes the target for Baloo and Louie's affections during a cargo pick-up to the country, but also of the power-hungry buzzard Chancellor Trample who wants to marry her in order to run the kingdom after staging a palace coup d'etat by withholding back the tax money of the national treasury to create a public uprising that she, Baloo and Louie foil in time. Although she does like both Baloo and Louie, she does not fall for either one of them but is grateful to them for restoring her kingdom back to the rightful rulers. *King Amuck (voiced by Howard Morris) is the aged and congenial rabbit monarch of the Kingdom of Macadamia and Princess Lotta L'Amour's father in the episode \\"The Road to Macadamia\\". Dressed as a cross between a king and a court jester, he appears at first as not too bright but is a shrewd leader who is manipulated by his scheming Royal Chancellor Trample to consider abdicating his throne by making him believe he is too incompetent to rule the people, and to almost allow Trample to marry Princess Lotta against her wishes in order to restore faith in the monarchy. After the plot fails, Amuck frugally rewards Baloo and Louie with the cargo order of ten sacks of chocolate-covered macadamia nuts and an invoice of $192.12 that they came for in the first place, instead of the rich reward they expected. *Chancellor Trample (voiced by Cummings) is a conniving vulture out to usurp the throne of King Amuck in order to gain the riches of the royal house of Macadamia in the episode \\"The Road to Macadamia\\". At first, he plans to do this by secretly raising taxes to make the king unpopular and the kingdom's citizens and coffers poor. At the time of Baloo and Louie's arrival, he hatches another scheme to marry Amuck's daughter Princess Lotta L'Amour as the three of them attempt to uncover the plot despite him having his own small army of Royal Guard rhinos at his command. When Trample's plans go awry, he confesses his crimes, begging to be locked up and tortured than endure more of Baloo and Louie's antics, which all parties agreed heartily. *Owl Capone (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is a diminutive gangster who appears in the episode \\"My Fair Baloo\\". He overtakes the gigantic Spruce Moose (read \\"Spruce Goose\\"), which is a giant airplane where Baloo and Rebecca go out to a swanky businessman's ball, primarily since Rebecca wished to schmooze with the wealthy clientele. Capone steals jewelry from most of the people there (except Rebecca, who did not have any on her) and takes the people in the plane hostage twice. He is a parody the real-life gangster \\"Scarface\\" Al Capone. *Thaddeus E. Klang (voiced by Tim Curry) is the leader of a cult-like organization seeking the secret weapon hidden in the lost city of Tinabula in the episode \\"For Whom the Bell Klangs\\". He is a green cobra with a black cloak, warlock-like hat, metallic jaw (capable of crushing hard objects with his bites), and metallic limbs, who speaks with a metallic echo in his voice (the abundance of metal being the basis for his name). He managed to pose quite a threat and even obtained the lost city's weapon (a destructive bell-like device that utilized sonic waves), but was defeated when he fired the weapon at the \\"master bell\\", which triggered it and buried the city. Afterward, his metallic parts fell off, revealing him to simply be a regular, albeit oversized, cobra, who then began to wander in the desert. His fate after this is unknown. *Ace London (voiced by Phil Hartman) is a highly arrogant, yet highly regarded gray wolf test pilot who went to school with Baloo and makes fun of him and his capabilities after winning a game of billiards against him in the episode \\"Mach One for the Gipper\\". He then accidentally switches Baloo's cargo of pickles with a top-secret jet engine, but instead of telling the truth when asked, he lies and says that Baloo did it. When Don Karnage tries to steal the engine, the true test of the two pilots begins. Unfortunately for Ace, not only do Baloo and Wildcat break the soundbarrier instead of him, but his lies are revealed and he is forced to deliver Baloo's cargo. Extremely egotistical, he not only lies about Baloo switching the cargo, but he also claims that Baloo resisted his orders to hand over the cargo and forced him and the pilots sent to assist him to land, when in reality Baloo had no idea he had the wrong freight, and Ace himself fired on Baloo, who tried to return the engine and did not attack at all. *Whistlestop Jackson (voiced by Camp) is Baloo's childhood hero who appears in the episode \\"Whistlestop Jackson, Legend\\". Whistlestop was a \\"hero to millions\\" and a \\"legend in his own time\\" for his aviation mastery and trademark biplane. As a younger man, he once beat out start-up entrepreneur Shere Khan on an air cargo contract, leaving Khan a bitter rival. However, by the time Rebecca hires him to be Higher for Hire's vice president, Whistlestop's skills are sorely obsolete and he does business solely based on his reputation. Although Baloo's opinion of Whistlestop becomes deflated when the aging pilot bungles a trial flight of the Sea Duck and makes him take the blame, the two make up and, with Baloo's help, Whistlestop again beats Khan in securing another lucrative air cargo contract, this time for Higher for Hire, which allows the aviation master to retire in the great bang he had always hoped for. *Finance Minister LaFong (voiced by Angel) is the finance minister of the country of Clopstokia who conspires with Shere Khan to secure a lucrative air cargo contract between Clopstokia and Khan Enterprises in the episode \\"Whistlestop Jackson, Legend\\". He is also in favor of Khan's efforts to eliminate Whistlestop Jackson as a threat to their plan. *Joe Magee (voiced by Hal Smith) is an old ace pilot and flight instructor who appears in the episode \\"The Old Man and the Sea Duck\\". During a situation in which Baloo is flying alone in the Sea Duck, Magee helps Baloo to land at his airfield because Baloo cannot remember how to fly due to amnesia he had suffered from a blow to the head during a previous flight. He then helps Baloo regain his memories of flying by teaching him how to fly again and about the true meaning of flying (that is, having fun and feeling free). When Baloo regains his memories, Magee suggests that he fly home alone but Baloo is too scared to fly solo due to a phobia of flying alone that he has developed since his two recent flight emergencies in the Sea Duck. When Baloo fakes that he is sick in order to avoid flying, Magee pretends to fall off a ladder and break his leg. Fearing that his friend is hurt, Baloo does what Magee asks him to and flies to the nearest town to get Doctor Cooper, but when he returns he finds that Magee is gone and the airfield and flight school look abandoned. The doctor explains that Magee walked with a cane because he broke his leg while rescuing the crew of a burning airplane (the injury forced him to permanently quit flying), and afterwards he built the flight school. According to the doctor, people say that Magee \\"trained the best\\" and \\"was the best\\". The doctor then tells Baloo that Magee died twenty years earlier. After hearing this, Baloo realizes that he was helped by Magee's spirit, whom he refers to as a \\"guardian angel\\". *Doctor Cooper (voiced by Alan Young) is a tortoise doctor whom Joe Magee told Baloo to go and get in order to treat Magee's supposedly injured leg in the episode \\"The Old Man and the Sea Duck\\". Cooper is the one who later informs Baloo of the truth about Joe Magee's life. Cooper lives and works in a town twenty miles north of Magee's flight school. *Rick Sky (voiced by Simon Templeman) is an ace fighter pilot who speaks with a British accent and appears in the episode \\"Bygones\\". Captain Rick Sky was the leader of the legendary \\"Squadron of Seven\\" who fought in the Great War, which ended 20 years before the episode takes place. While transporting a shipment of silver bars to help finance the war effort, he and his squadron mysteriously vanished, and people thought that he and his squadron stole the silver. Baloo (who has been a fan of Rick Sky since childhood and reads comic books about him) ends up finding him adrift in the sea. At first Baloo doubts that the person he rescued is Rick Sky, because the idea seems unbelievable and he looks far too young (since he should be about 50 years old by this time, but he looks like he is only 30). However, after the mysterious figure demonstrates his flying skills by taking the controls of the Sea Duck and evading an air pirate attack, Baloo becomes inclined to believe that the man really is Rick Sky. Baloo's belief, however, is later extinguished when Sky steals the Sea Duck in order to search for the missing silver so he can finish his squadron's mission to deliver it and restore the honor of his squadron. Baloo chases after the stolen Sea Duck, which is captured along with Sky by Don Karnage's air pirates. Baloo rescues Sky and retrieves the Sea Duck, and threatens to throw the \\"thief\\" out of the plane, but the man proves he is indeed Rick Sky by showing Baloo his Distinguished Flying Cross medal. Afterwards, they fly to some ice cliffs in search of the silver, but end up finding the rest of Sky's squadron frozen in ice. It is then made clear to Sky that he and his squadron froze into the cliffs during a snowstorm, preserving them alive in suspended animation so that they did not age, and preserving their planes in perfect working order. Two decades later, Sky thawed out and drifted out to sea, where he was rescued by Baloo at the beginning of the episode. Baloo and Sky thaw out the other six members of the squadron just before the air pirates show up. Sky persuades Baloo to take the silver (which was stored in one of the squadron's biplanes) and finish the delivery mission, while Sky and his squadron engage the pirates in a dogfight. Despite the fact that their biplanes are 20 years obsolete, the squadron is able to defeat the pirate fighter planes, but they run into trouble when the pirates' mother- ship, the Iron Vulture, attacks them. However, after Baloo flies in with his Sea Duck and rescues Sky from being annihilated by cannon fire, the squadron together with Baloo are able to inflict severe damage to the Iron Vulture, forcing it to retreat. Afterwards, Rick Sky and the Squadron of Seven fly off into the sunset to an unknown fate, while Baloo flies back to Higher for Hire to refuel before completing the squadron's mission to deliver the silver and restore their honor. Of the other six members of the Squadron of Seven, only three are named: Scott, Johnny, and Reggie. Reggie (voiced by Neil Ross) is the only member other than Rick Sky who speaks, and he does so in a British accent like his leader. *Cool Hands Luke (voiced by Ron Feinberg) is a polar bear who is about the same size as Baloo, and has a highly aggressive, chauvinistic, narcissistic, and apparently sociopathic (he claims when caught cheating that he does not have a conscience) attitude. He appears in the episode \\"Feminine Air\\", in which he makes fun of the fact that Baloo works for a woman, and presses the issue to drive business away from Higher for Hire. His winning streak in the Air Scavenger Race (achieved through cheating) was broken when Rebecca and Baloo (in his \\"Tan-Margaret\\" persona) beat him and revealed him to be a fraud. His name is a pun on the book and film Cool Hand Luke. *Mr. Pomeroy (voiced by Alan Oppenheimer) is the principal at Kit's grade school in the episode \\"Sheepskin Deep\\". He is a short gruff brown bear who administers and grades Baloo's equivalency test to determine whether he will receive his diploma. At first, it seems that Baloo failed by one question, but later Baloo proves to Pomeroy that he answered the question correctly, and so Pomeroy gives Baloo a passing grade and his diploma. *Mrs. Morrissey (voiced by Susan Tolsky) is a teacher at Kit's grade school in the episode \\"Sheepskin Deep\\". Kit is a member of her class, and Baloo temporarily joins the class in order to get his diploma. When she first appears, she welcomes Baloo back to school and Baloo recognizes her and addresses her by name, indicating that she was one of Baloo's original grade school teachers when he was a child. She is an elderly brown bear with tan fur and a slightly hunched back. *Clementine Clevenger (voiced by Soucie) is a tall, smart and earthy blonde feline dressed up in Western clothing and speaks with an American Southern accent in the episode \\"Citizen Khan\\". She is the unwitting secretary/court reporter/Girl Friday of the corrupt and self-appointed Sheriff Gomer in the small, Western frontier-type mining town of Boomstone (read Tombstone, Arizona) owned by Khan Industries and where the Higher for Hire crew of Baloo, Kit and Wildcat are forced to land by the unscrupulous sheriff and his dim-witted deputy Wendell. Fed up with the corrupt Gomer for hijacking and kidnapping people to mine for the highly volatile and yet-to-be valuable substance urgonium and hiding it from Khan, she (and the other residents of the town/mine) mistakes Wildcat for the corporate magnate after an explosion soots his face with tiger-like markings that make him look like Khan (and he decides to impersonate Khan after Baloo convinces him to do so in order to allow them to leave), for whom she has a deep admiration. When the mistreated miners hold Wildcat hostage in order to leave the mine, she sneaks off to phone Khan's headquarters in Cape Suzette where she unknowingly speaks to the real Shere Khan about the situation, but she gets cut off by Gomer, who locks her up in her boarding room and Khan decides to investigate his own apparent kidnapping. After a daring escape and rescuing Baloo and Kit from Gomer's jail cell, she leads them to the mine where the sheriff and deputy blow-up the entrance and decide to make their getaway just as Khan arrives in his private plane to find out what is going on. In the aftermath of catching the crooked lawmen and meeting the CEO, she becomes the new foreman of the urgonium mine. She appreciates Wildcat's gentleness, innocent sincerity and mechanical genius, with him having mutual feelings for her as well (calling her \\"Clem\\"), and they both fall in love. She makes a cameo appearance in the episode \\"Sheepskin Deep\\". *Sheriff Gomer (voiced by David Doyle) is a hog wearing a small-town Western frontier sheriff outfit and speaks with an abrasive voice in the episode \\"Citizen Khan\\". He is actually a mine foreman in the mining town of Boomstone who works for Khan Enterprises, and withholds information from Khan about the explosive urgonium. With his less-than-smart cohort and deputy Wendell, he forces any passersby to work in the mines on trumped-up charges and even imprisons them. Baloo, Kit and Wildcat manage to stop Gomer and Wendell during a mid-air chase involving rotten kumquats that gum up their getaway plane. They are later (ironically) forced to work in the very same mine in which they held their former captives. *Wendell (voiced by Frank Welker) is Sheriff Gomer's not-so-intelligent wolf deputy and accomplice who speaks with an American Southern accent in the episode \\"Citizen Khan\\". *Wan Lo (voiced by Robert Ito) is the evil panda emperor of the city of Panda-La (read \\"Shangri-La\\") featured in the episode \\"Last Horizons\\". When Baloo rediscovers the city and tells him and his people that they can visit Cape Suzette, Wan Lo jumps at the chance and orders his people to fly the city there using giant balloons in order to invade and conquer it. With heat-seeking rockets among their weapons, Panda-La easily defeats the city's defenses. Being blamed for causing the invasion, Baloo seeks to redeem himself by flying out alone to fight against Wan Lo's forces. Filling the Sea Duck with ice cream, Baloo at first evades the heat-seeking rockets, but is eventually captured. While in captivity, Baloo tries to negotiate with Wan Lo, but the emperor explains that his people do not seek to make friends but rather to conquer new territories in which to live. Baloo later receives some unexpected help from Kit, Louie, Rebecca, and Wildcat, which allows him to escape and get back to the Sea Duck. During the ensuing battle, Baloo manages to use the pandas' own weapons against them and defeats Panda-La. Wan Lo is last seen floating down into Cape Suzette's bay in the basket of a parachute-balloon with his two sons after escaping from his crashing palace-balloon. His fate after this is unknown, as is the fate of his people. *Muffy and Buffy Vanderschmere (voiced by Linda Gary and Welker respectively) are a fox con artist couple posing as rich, snobbish clients who trick Higher for Hire into transporting some supposedly valuable family jewels to Hyenasport, hoping to get the Sea Duck as collateral insurance in case of theft or loss of the jewelry as deemed by Rebecca in the episode \\"A Touch of Glass\\". Thus they make an effort to lose the jewels at every opportunity, including throwing them out one of the seaplane's windows and, after landing at Louie's Place, by putting the blame on Louie for the \\"stolen\\" jewels (since both they and Rebecca find the nightclub/motel and its owner too seedy for their tastes). They are later exposed by the nightclub owner as frauds wanted by the law and the jewels are proved to be fakes. They are overpowered by Louie and Rebecca just minutes after they had taken-off in the plane. Muffy is dressed in a blue dress and wide-brimmed hat, a pearl necklace, bangles on her ankles and has blond hair (that turns out to be a wig), and Buffy is dressed like a golfer. Both speak by imitating Bostonian blueblood accents, although Buffy does sound a bit like Thurston Howell, III. They make cameo appearances in the episodes \\"Vowel Play\\", \\"The Golden Sprocket of Friendship\\", \\"Last Horizons\\", \\"My Fair Baloo\\", and \\"Mach One for the Gipper\\". *Broadcast Sally (voiced by Sheryl Bernstein) is a large, strong and sensual female hippopotamus with a very sultry voice who works as a popular morning disc jockey at K-CAPE radio station in Cape Suzette, mainly wearing a flower print dress and big picture hat plus spritzing herself in perfume habitually in the episode \\"The Time Bandit\\". She is so popular that her broadcast range goes as far as Thembria, where her transmission is banned by law but is heard, regardless of the penalty that comes with it. Baloo is the constant object of her desire as he owes her a grocery list of favors that in return she wants him to repay by going on a date with her, much to his reluctance and aversion to her blackmailing methods in doing so. She is possibly a pun on the World War II-era propagandist broadcaster Axis Sally during the war against the Allies by Nazi Germany with the same type of voice and patronizing tone in her broadcasts throughout war-torn Europe and on shortwave American radio. She also makes cameo appearances in the episodes \\"Louie's Last Stand\\" and \\"Time Waits for No Bear\\". *Ralph Throgmorton (voiced by Ken Sansom) is an immaculately dressed coypu with round glasses who works as a flight instructor for FLAP (the Federal Licensing Agency for Pilots) in Cape Suzette in the episode \\"On a Wing and a Bear\\". Uptight and humorless, he is known by the well-reputed and dreaded moniker \\"Love to Flunk 'Em\\". Throgmorton is extremely meticulous and does absolutely everything \\"alphabetically\\" (for example, he insists on having his car serviced by first having the Air in the tires checked, then the Brake fluid, then the Coolant, then the Dipstick, etc. in alphabetical order). This approach makes Baloo extremely nervous, which prevents him from renewing his flying license (he was also Baloo's driving instructor during his adolescence). In desperation, Baloo tries to find work in other fields, but somehow gets fired every time due to complaints by Throgmorton and even by his equally alphabetical granddaughter Kathy (voiced by Sherry Lynn) at a carnival ride. Baloo finally redeems himself in the instructor's eyes, and gets his license back when he rescues them both from a tight situation involving Don Karnage's air pirates, after discovering that they had been behind a series of oil raids that were causing an energy crisis on behalf of Shere Khan. *Airplane Jane, a.k.a. Plane Jane (voiced by Susan Silo), is a highly capable female hippopotamus pilot who learned to fly from Baloo (it reputedly took her a minute), and who shares almost the same mannerisms and behavior as her former mentor in the episode \\"Waiders of the Wost Tweasure\\". Plane Jane (as she is called by Baloo) was once a finishing school attendee with Princess Grace of Walla Walla Bing Bang, but \\"never finished\\". Despite her show-offish attitude (she never misses a chance to rub it to Baloo that she is the better pilot) and often sneaky, competitive nature, she also has a heart of gold underneath and would help out a friend in need. *Princess Grace (voiced by Victoria Carroll) is a white swan princess and first in line to the throne of the kingdom of Walla Walla Bing Bang in the episode \\"Waiders of the Wost Tweasure\\". However, her right to the throne is challenged by her supposed long-lost cousin Prince Rudolf, and in order to prove her right to rule she must obtain the long-lost Ruby Wings. After Baloo and Airplane Jane retrieve the wings and bring them to her, she is crowned queen. When said in a Walla Walla Bing Bang accent, her name is pronounced \\"Pwincess Gwace\\". *Prince Rudolf (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) is a black swan who is supposedly second in line to the throne of the kingdom of Walla Walla Bing Bang and Princess Grace's long-lost cousin who is challenging the princess's right to the throne in the episode \\"Waiders of the Wost Tweasure\\". In reality, however, he is neither, since he is really a foreign imposter who wants to use the Ruby Wings to steal the throne and the kingdom. In the end, he is defeated by Baloo and Airplane Jane, who retrieve the wings and bring them to the princess in time for her to be crowned queen at the coronation. When said in a Walla Walla Bing Bang accent, his name is pronounced \\"Pwince Wudolf\\". *Captain William Stansbury (voiced by Peter Reneday) is a 19th-century lion sea captain who crashed his sailing ship a hundred years earlier onto what is now the island where Louie built his nightclub and whose ghost haunts when he is magically brought forth during a casual night of carousing in the episode \\"Her Chance to Dream\\". Frightened off the island and back to Cape Suzette, both Baloo and Louie tell an overtired Rebecca about the haunting, but she disbelieves them. Returning with trepidation and bringing Rebecca along, they find that the place is deserted until the captain's apparition appears before them in solid form (pretending to be a living person) and is highly enamoured by the businesswoman. With his handsome looks and gentlemanly manners, Rebecca becomes smitten with him, but in reality he is a snobbish, judgemental and bothersome poltergeist who prevents them from leaving the island. Seducing her under the moonlight with his charms during a walk on the island, the lonely ghost wants to take Rebecca away from the earthly world, an idea which she accepts in her tired state of mind. Baloo and Louie eventually discover that Stansbury is the ghost, so they try to capture him in a net but fail, and Stansbury then causes the wrecked ship to be restored and to bust out from under the nightclub as a flying ghost ship. While Baloo and Louie are forced to do chores by the captain's magical power, they find a book of spells in the ship that will get rid of Stansbury and return everything back to normal. They then begin to exorcise the ghost by reading a spell from the book, but Rebecca intervenes before they can finish. After the pilot gently convinces his tearful employer that this is neither a dream nor the life for her by reminding her of her daughter Molly who she left at home, Rebecca reluctantly finishes off the spell that sends the ghostly captain back into the spirit world. The captain promises to wait for her in the afterlife as the ghost ship flies up into the night sky. A painting of Stansbury that was shown earlier in the shipwreck under Louie's Place is now shown hanging prominently on a wall in Rebecca's apartment as she tells Molly about the captain. *Crazy Edie (voiced by Billie Hayes) is a female wild-eyed and gravelly-voiced bird mechanic con-artist who sabotages airplanes in order to charge high prices to fix them, with the help of her four cute, furry gremlin-like creatures (voiced by Frank Welker) who are forced against their will to assist her in the episode \\"The Sound and the Furry\\". She controls them with special collars fitted around their necks which cause them to destroy/disassemble machines (such as airplanes) when exposed to a certain sound frequency (such as that created by her tuning fork device, or when Wildcat banged a wrench against an engine). She is also accompanied by her pet alligator named Al. At one point, Edie temporarily loses the furry creatures, who are then found and befriended by Wildcat who mistakes and refers to them as lobsters. He later helps to free them and return them back to their home in the bayou after he and Baloo foil Edie's latest acts at a flying competition. Wildcat named the one with the red collar Sammy, the one with the green collar Frankie, the one with the pink collar Maxine, and the one with the blue collar Homer. Crazy Edie should not be confused with Baloo's old grade school classmate of the same name, who appears near the end of the episode \\"Sheepskin Deep\\". In the episode it's pronounced \\"E-dee\\" *Hans and Helga (voiced by Stan Jones and Joan Gerber respectively) are the homicidal servants of the von Bruinwald Castle in Bearvaria (read \\"Bavaria\\") who live to serve and kill the von Bruinwald family in order to gain the family's inheritance when Baloo becomes the latest Baron to hold the title in the episode \\"The Balooest of the Bluebloods\\". The badger butler Hans provides everything, including placing a shark into the pool and spooking Baloo with a family curse to make him paranoid, while the shrew housekeeper Helga dishes out poisonous meals to serve the pilot. They then go on a rampage to finish him and his houseguests off. They are finally stopped after Baloo fakes his own death with Rebecca's help, and informs the local authorities about the situation just as they and the von Bruinwald family lawyer Austin Featheridge arrive to tell him that they are foreclosing the castle and confiscating the fortune due to centuries of unpaid taxes. *Austin Featheridge (voiced by Gilbert) is the von Bruinwald family lawyer and financial representative who belongs to the law firm \\"Featheridge, Featheridge, and Nowinski\\". He is the one who first informs Baloo about his noble lineage, and he is also the one who later informs Baloo of the confiscation of his estate due to his family's unpaid taxes. He is an elderly white bird. *O'Roarke (voiced by Cummings) is an obnoxious, raspy- voiced bull who tricks Baloo and Wildcat into taking him to a mysterious land of dinosaurs that come alive with the aid of a magical waterfall, presumably to start a touring business in the episode \\"Paradise Lost\\". However, his real motives are considerably darker than what he leads the others to believe (he wants to start a hunting-guide business for big-game hunters who want to kill dinosaurs). In order to foil his plans, Wildcat shuts off the waterfall so as to hide the valley from the hunters, but due to the mechanic's good nature and feelings of wonder toward the prehistoric creatures, he secretly allows the waterfall to later reopen which allows the dinosaurs to live again in peace. *Nanuk (voiced by Cummings) is a large polar bear who lives in the Arctic in an igloo and speaks with an Inuit accent, and to whom Baloo delivers pizzas in the episode \\"Pizza Pie in the Sky\\". Nanuk is one of the customers of Baloo and Louie's \\"Pizza Pie in the Sky\\" pizza air delivery business, but the first delivery to him involves the wrong-sized pizza, prompting two more repeated deliveries to him, each of which also go awry. *Bob (voiced by Cummings) is the pelican fishmonger and owner of \\"Bob's Discount House of Fish\\" who reluctantly sells rancid anchovies to Baloo and Kit in the episode \\"Pizza Pie in the Sky\\".

It was a conventional two-bay biplane of greatly uneven span, equipped with two large central floats and two outriggers. The race was called off at the outbreak of the First World War, but the British Admiralty was aware of the type and ordered five examples, with modified floats and tail. In service, these proved completely unsuitable, and it was discovered that with a second person aboard, the aircraft could barely fly. In October 1915, the 510s in service were sent to Supermarine for modification and improvement, but by March the following year all were removed from service.Jackson 1990, pp.136‚Äì138.

After over 100 years of existence, the company merged with Friedrich Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp to form ThyssenKrupp in 1999. History On 29 September 1891, August Thyssen and his brother Joseph Thyssen came to be in possession of all shares of Gewerkschaft Deutscher Kaiser, a coal mining company. On 17 December 1891, the steelworks of the same company opened in Hamborn (today part of Duisburg). Subsequently, the plant was modernized and expanded by August Thyssen, becoming a vertically integrated company producing iron and steel and manufacturing ships, machines etc. After the First World War came the occupation of the Ruhr and the loss of many foreign interests; however the company remained viable. On 4 April 1926, August Thyssen died; his son, Fritz Thyssen became chairman of a new group Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG (United Steelworks) which was formed by a consortium of companies, with Thyssen representing 26% of the company's value. In 1934, August Thyssen-H√ºtte AG was founded as part of the new group. The Nazi rearmament policy and subsequent war made the plants essential to the war economy. After the end of World War II, the Allies ordered the company to be liquidated and in 1953 a new company, also named August Thyssen-H√ºtte AG, was formed in Duisburg. The other mills of the company in Duisburg became legally independent entities; in the 1950s and 1960s they were reintegrated into the Thyssen group. However, the mining division was not reconglomerated; thus Thyssen became largely a steel company. In 1954/55, the group focused on acquisitions to restore the vertical integration by acquiring mining concerns. Further companies were acquired: Niederrheinischen H√ºtte AG in 1956, Deutschen Edelstahlwerke AG in 1957, Phoenix-Rheinrohr AG (metallurgical works and mills), and H√ºttenwerk Oberhausen AG in 1968. The product range included steel sections and flat steel in all grades, including high-alloy steel. By the mid 1960s, August Thyssen-H√ºtte AG was Europe's largest crude steel producer, and the fifth largest in the world. In the 1960s, the company also formed cooperative alliances with companies such as Mannesmann AG. By 1972, it employed 92,200 people and generated annual sales of 9.8 billion DM. In 1973, the company acquired Rheinstahl AG, which was mainly a manufacturing company. This takeover reduced the company's dominance in the steel industry and converted it to a conglomerate. In 1977, the company became Thyssen AG, with Rheinstahl AG already having been renamed Thyssen Industrie AG in 1976. In 1983, Thyssen Stahl AG was spun off. During the 1980s, talks on a merger between Thyssen Stahl AG and Krupp Stahl AG took place. An alliance did not take place at that time, but there began cooperation on certain business areas (tinplate, electrical steel, and stainless steel). In 1997, the flat steel production divisions of both groups were merged to form Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG. On 17 March 1999, a new group formed by the merger of Thyssen and Krupp was registered, and on 23 October the merger took place, forming Thyssen-Krupp AG. That same year, they acquired the elevator division of American-based conglomerate Dover Corporation.

The principal character/narrator is Tommy Johnson, whose internal monologues allow the reader an inside view of football hooliganism and the adrenaline highs involved. Major battles take place with Chelsea‚Äôs traditional enemies, among them Tottenham and Millwall, and the book‚Äôs authenticity has often been commented upon. The language used is hard-hitting but imaginative, as Tommy‚Äôs frustration and outspoken views on life in modern- day Britain delve into a range of subjects including class, patriotism, prejudice, poverty and the political system. Equally as important to the novel‚Äôs structure is the presence of pensioner Bill Farrell, a former soldier who fought in the Second World War and was decorated for his bravery. After the war he married a concentration-camp survivor, and is trying to cope with her recent death. He is seen as a hero by subsequent generations, among them Tommy and various older members of the Chelsea firm, hardcore hooligans such as Dave Harris and Billy Bright. Bill Farrell is a calmer voice, but while his more measured reflections present an alternative approach to that of the younger men, he shares their frustrations and feelings of powerlessness. Vignettes from a range of minor characters are also included, among them the story of Vince Matthews, a former hooligan who has broken out of the circle of violence to travel the world. The Football Factory is rich in cultural references, from popular music to the songs and chants of the terraces. Tommy remembers the glory days of the Shed at Stamford Bridge, the Chelsea North Stand and Gate 13, along with his own assessments of opposing players and supporters. The role of a sensationalist media and the hypocrisy of the political classes is highlighted in relation to football-connected violence, with modern warfare brought into the equation. London is shown in detail, the allegiance to a football club as an extension of community, in many cases involving populations that have been displaced. Whether it is a street, pub, greasy spoon, Indian restaurant or launderette, the reader will know which part of London they are seeing. On its release The Football Factory was heralded as a ‚Äòstate of the nation‚Äô novel by some reviewers, while others criticised its aversion to political correctness. Football fans and the wider public made it a best-seller. It has been translated into a number of languages and was followed by Headhunters and England Away. Together these three novels make up The Football Factory Trilogy. In 2004 the book was turned into a high-profile film by director Nick Love, starring Danny Dyer as Tommy Johnson and Dudley Sutton as Bill Farrell. The controversy of the book‚Äôs initial release was repeated, as the subject matter and the presence of a number of known Chelsea hooligans among the extras caused great excitement in the media.

Their frequency varies with geographical location and historical period. Gray wolf attacks are rare because wolves are often subsequently killed, or even extirpated in reaction by human beings. As a result, wolves today tend to live mostly far from people or have developed the tendency and ability to avoid them. The country with the most extensive historical records is France, where nearly 7,600 fatal attacks were documented from 1200 to 1920. Moriceau, Jean-Marc (2013), Sur les pas du loup: Tour de France et atlas historiques et culturels du loup, du moyen √¢ge √† nos jours [On the trail of the wolf: a tour of France and a historical and cultural atlas of the wolf, from the Middle Ages to modern times], Paris, Montbel, There are few historical records or modern cases of wolf attacks in North America. In the half-century up to 2002, there were eight fatal attacks in Europe and Russia, three in North America, and more than 200 in south Asia. Experts categorize wolf attacks into various types, including rabies-infected, predatory, agonistic, and defensive. Wolves and wolf-human interactions The gray wolf is the largest wild member of the canid family, with males averaging , and females . It is the most specialized member of its genus in the direction of carnivory and hunting large game. Although they primarily target ungulates, wolves are at times versatile in their diet; for example, those in the Mediterranean region largely subsist on garbage and domestic animals. They have powerful jaws and teeth and powerful bodies capable of great endurance, and often run in large packs. Nevertheless, they tend to fear and avoid human beings, especially in North America.Mech, L. D.(1990) Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?, Audubon, March. (Reprinted in International Wolf 2(3):3-7.) Wolves vary in temperament and their reaction to humans. Those with little prior experience with humans, and those positively conditioned through feeding, may lack fear. Wolves living in open areas, for example the North American Great Plains, historically showed little fear before the advent of firearms in the 19th century, and would follow human hunters to feed on their kills, particularly bison. In contrast, forest-dwelling wolves in North America were noted for shyness. Wolf biologist L. David Mech hypothesized in 1998 that wolves generally avoid humans because of fear instilled by hunting.Mech, L. D. (1998), \\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?\\"  Revisited. International Wolf 8(1): 8-11. Mech also noted that humans' upright posture is unlike wolves' other prey, and similar to some postures of bears, which wolves usually avoid. Mech speculated that attacks are preceded by habituation to humans, while a successful outcome for the wolf may lead to repeated behavior, as documented especially in India. =Characteristics= Rabid Cases of rabid wolves are low when compared to other species since wolves do not serve as primary reservoirs of the disease, but can be infected with rabies from other animals such as dogs, golden jackals and foxes. Cases of rabies in wolves are very rare in North America, though numerous in the eastern Mediterranean, Middle East and Central Asia. The reason for this is unclear, though it may be connected with the presence of jackals in those areas, as jackals have been identified as primary carriers. Wolves apparently develop the \\"furious\\" phase of rabies to a very high degree, which, coupled with their size and strength, makes rabid wolves perhaps the most dangerous of rabid animals, with bites from rabid wolves being 15 times more dangerous than those of rabid dogs. Rabid wolves usually act alone, traveling large distances and often biting large numbers of people and domestic animals. Most rabid wolf attacks occur in the spring and autumn periods. Unlike with predatory attacks, the victims of rabid wolves are not eaten, and the attacks generally only occur on a single day. Also, rabid wolves attack their victims at random, showing none of the selectivity displayed by predatory wolves, though the majority of recorded cases involve adult men, as men were frequently employed in agricultural and forestry activities which put them into contact with wolves. Non-rabid Petits paysans surpris par un loup by Fran√ßois Grenier de Saint-Martin, 1833 Experts categorize non-rabid attacks based on the behavior of the victims prior to the attack and the motivations of the wolf. =Provoked= Attacks whose victims had been threatening, disciplining, disturbing, teasing, or annoying attacking wolves, their pups, families, or packs are classified as \\"provoked\\", \\"defensive\\" or \\"disciplinary\\". The attackers in such cases seem motivated, not by hunger, but fear or anger and the need to escape from or drive the victim away. Examples would include a captive wolf attacking an abusive handler; a mother wolf attacking a hiker who had wandered near her pups; an attack on a wolf hunter in active pursuit; or a wildlife photographer, park visitor, or field biologist who had gotten too close for the wolf's comfort. While such attacks may still be dangerous, they tend to be limited to quick bites and not pressed. =Unprovoked= Unprovoked attacks have been classified as \\"predatory\\"; \\"exploratory\\" or \\"investigative\\"; or \\"agonistic\\". Predatory Unprovoked wolf attacks motivated by hunger are categorized as \\"predatory\\". In some such cases, a cautious wolf may launch \\"investigative\\" or \\"exploratory\\" attacks to test the victim for suitability as prey. As with defensive attacks, such attacks are not always pressed, as the animal may break off the attack or be convinced to look elsewhere for its next meal. In contrast, during \\"determined\\" predatory attacks, the victims may be repeatedly bitten on the head and face and dragged off and consumed, sometimes as far away as 2.5 km from the attack site, unless the wolf or wolves are driven off.Rajpurohit, K.S. 1999. Child lifting: Wolves in Hazaribagh, India. Ambio 28(2):162-166 Experts in India use the term \\"child lifting\\" to describe predatory attacks in which the animal silently enters a hut while everyone is sleeping, picks up a child, often with a silencing bite to the mouth and nose, and carries a child off by the head. Such attacks typically occur in local clusters, and generally do not stop until the wolves involved are eliminated. Agonistic Agonistic attacks are motivated not by hunger nor fear but rather by aggression; designed to kill or drive off a competitor away from a territory or food source. As with predatory attacks, these may begin with or be limited to exploratory or investigative attacks designed to test the vulnerability and determination of the victim. Even when pressed until the death of the victim, agonistic attacks normally leave the victims body uneaten, at least for some time. Characteristic =Habituation= Wolf attacks are more likely to happen when preceded by a long period of habituation, during which wolves gradually lose their fear of humans. This was apparent in cases involving habituated North American wolves in Algonquin Provincial Park, Vargas Island Provincial Park and Ice Bay, as well as 19th- century cases involving escaped captive wolves in Sweden and Estonia.McNay, Mark E. and Philip W. Mooney. 2005. Attempted depredation of a child by a Gray Wolf, Canis lupus, near Icy Bay, Alaska. Canadian Field-Naturalist 119(2): 197-201. =Seasonality= Predatory attacks can occur at any time of the year, with a peak in the June‚ÄìAugust period, when the chances of people entering forested areas (for livestock grazing or berry and mushroom picking) increase, Oriani, A. & Comincini, M. Morti causate dal lupo in Lombardia e nel Piemonte Orientale nel XVIII secolo, in atti del Seminario ‚ÄúVivere la morte nel Settecento‚Äù, Santa Margherita Ligure 30 settembre - 2 ottobre 2002 though cases of non-rabid wolf attacks in winter have been recorded in Belarus, the Kirovsk and Irkutsk districts, in Karelia, and in Ukraine. Wolves with pups experience greater food stresses during this period. =Victim age and gender= A worldwide 2002 study by the Norwegian Institute of Nature Research showed that 90% of victims of predatory attacks were children under the age of 18, especially under the age of 10. In the rare cases where adults were killed, the victims were almost always women. This is consistent with wolf hunting strategies, wherein the weakest and most vulnerable categories of prey are targeted. Aside from their physical inferiority, children were historically more vulnerable to wolves as they were more likely to enter forests unattended to pick berries and mushrooms, as well as tend and watch over cattle and sheep on pastures. While these practices have largely died out in Europe, they are still the case in India, where numerous attacks have been recorded in recent decades. Further reason for the vulnerability of children is the fact that some may mistake wolves for dogs and thus approach them. =Wild vs. captive= Experts may distinguish between captive and wild wolf attacks, the former referring to attacks by wolves, while still of course wild animals, are kept in captivity, perhaps as pets, in zoos, or similar situations. History and perception worldwide =Europe= Map showing the number of wolf attacks in France by d√©partement from 1400 to 1918 Map of Eurasia showing the distribution of wolf attacks, with blue indicating areas where both rabid and predatory attacks occurred, purple for purely predatory attacks, and yellow for purely rabid ones Chart showing the hypothetical stages leading up to wolf attacks on humans in 15th- to 19th-century Italy. While these factors are now largely absent in modern-day Europe, they are still present in rural India, where many attacks took place during the late 20th century. In France, historical records compiled by rural historian Jean- Marc Moriceau indicate that during the period 1362‚Äì1918, nearly 7,600 people were killed by wolves, of whom 4,600 were killed by non-rabid wolves. However, the zoologist Karl-Hans Taake found evidence that many of the alleged French wolf attacks occurring during the reign of Louis XIV were actually carried out by big carnivores of other species which had escaped from captivity.Carnivore Attacks on Humans in Historic France and Germany: To Which Species Did the Attackers Belong? by Karl-Hans Taake. ResearchGate. 2020 Numerous attacks occurred in Germany during the 17th century after the Thirty Years' War, though the majority probably involved rabid wolves. Although Italy has no records of wolf attacks after WWII and the eradication of rabies in the 1960s, historians examining church and administrative records from northern Italy's central Po Valley region (which includes a part of modern-day Switzerland) found 440 cases of wolves attacking people between the 15th and 19th centuries. The 19th-century records show that between 1801 and 1825, there were 112 attacks, 77 of which resulted in death. Of these cases, only five were attributed to rabid animals. Cagnolaro, L., Comincini, M., Martinoli, A. & Oriani, A., \\"Dati Storici sulla Presenza e su Casi di Antropofagia del Lupo nella Padania Centrale\\", in atti del convegno nazionale ‚ÄúDalla parte del lupo‚Äù, Parma 9-10 ottobre 1992, Atti & Studi del WWF Italia, n ¬∞ 10, 1-160, F. Cecere (a cura di), 1996, Cogecstre Edizioni In Latvia, records of rabid wolf attacks go back two centuries. At least 72 people were bitten between 1992 and 2000. Similarly, in Lithuania, attacks by rabid wolves have continued to the present day, with 22 people having been bitten between 1989 and 2001. Around 82 people were bitten by rabid wolves in Estonia during the 18th to 19th centuries, with a further 136 people being killed in the same period by non- rabid wolves, though it is likely that the animals involved in the latter cases were a combination of wolf-dog hybrids and escaped captive wolves. Russia and the Soviet Union As with North American scientists later on (see below), several Russian zoologists after the October Revolution cast doubt on the veracity of records involving wolf-caused deaths. Prominent among them was zoologist Petr Aleksandrovich Manteifel, who initially regarded all cases as either fiction or the work of rabid animals. His writings were widely accepted among Russian zoological circles, though he subsequently changed his stance when he was given the task of heading a special commission after World War II investigating wolf attacks throughout the Soviet Union, which had increased during the war years. A report was presented in November 1947 describing numerous attacks, including ones perpetrated by apparently healthy animals, and gave recommendations on how to better defend against them. The Soviet authorities prevented the document from reaching both the public and those who would otherwise be assigned to deal with the problem. All mention of wolf attacks was subsequently censored.Geist, Valerius. \\"Let's get real: beyond wolf advocacy, toward realistic policies for carnivore conservation\\". Fair Chase. Summer 2009. pp. 26‚Äì30. =Asia= In Iran, 98 attacks were recorded in 1981, and 329 people were given treatment for rabid wolf bites in 1996. Records of wolf attacks in India began to be kept during the British colonial administration in the 19th century. In 1875, more people were killed by wolves than tigers, with the worst affected areas being the North West Provinces and Bihar. In the former area, 721 people were killed by wolves in 1876, while in Bihar, the majority of the 185 recorded deaths at the time occurred mostly in the Patna and Bghalpur Divisions.Knight, J. (2003), Wildlife in Asia: Cultural Perspectives, Routledge, p. 219, In the United Provinces, 624 people were killed by wolves in 1878, with 14 being killed during the same period in Bengal. In Hazaribagh, Bihar, 115 children were killed between 1910 and 1915, with 122 killed and 100 injured in the same area between 1980 and 1986. Between April 1989 to March 1995, wolves killed 92 people in southern Bihar, accounting for 23% of 390 large mammal attacks on humans in the area at that time.Jhala, Y.V. and D.K. Sharma. 1997. Child- lifting by wolves in eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. Journal of Wildlife Research 2(2):94‚Äì101 Police records collected from Korean mining communities during Japanese rule indicate that wolves attacked 48 people in 1928, more than those claimed by boars, bears, leopards and tigers combined.Neff, Robert, \\"Devils in the Darkness: The Korean Gray Wolf was a Terror for Miners\\", OhmyNews (June 23, 2007) =North America= There are no written records prior to the European colonization of the Americas. The oral history of some Indigenous American tribes confirms that wolves did kill humans. Tribes living in woodlands feared wolves more than their tundra-dwelling counterparts, as they could encounter wolves suddenly and at close quarters. Skepticism among North American scientists over the alleged ferocity of wolves began when Canadian biologist Doug Clarke investigated historical wolf attacks in Europe and, based on his own experiences with the (as perceived by him) relatively timid wolves of the Canadian wilderness, concluded that all historical attacks were perpetrated by rabid animals, and that healthy wolves posed no threat to humans.C. H. Doug Clarke, 1971, The beast of G√©vaudan, Natural History Vol. 80 pp. 44-51 & 66-73 His findings are criticized for failing to distinguish between rabid and predatory attacks, and the fact that the historical literature contained instances of people surviving the attacks at a time when there was no rabies vaccine. His conclusions received some limited support by biologists but were never adopted by United States Fish and Wildlife Service or any other official organisations. This view is not taught in wolf management programs. United States Fish and Wildlife Service concludes that wolves are very shy of humans but are opportunistic hunters and will attack humans if the opportunity arises and advise against \\"actions that encourage wolves to spend time near people\\".https://www.fws.gov/home/feature/2007/qandasgraywolfbiology.pdf Mr Clarke's view did, however, gain popularity among laypeople and animal rights activists with the publication of Farley Mowat's semi-fictional 1963 book Never Cry Wolf, with the language barrier hindering the collection of further data on wolf attacks elsewhere. Although some North American biologists were aware of wolf attacks in Eurasia, they dismissed them as irrelevant to North American wolves. Wolf numbers consistently dropped across the US during the 20th century and by the 1970s they were only significantly present in Minnesota and Alaska (though in greatly reduced populations than prior to the European colonization of the Americas https://www.wolf.org/wow/united- states/gray-wolf-timeline/). The resulting decrease in human-wolf and livestock-wolf interactions helped contribute to a view of wolves as not dangerous to humans. By the 1970s, the pro-wolf lobby aimed to change public attitudes towards wolves, with the phrase \\"there has never been a documented case of a healthy wild wolf attacking a human in North America\\" (or variations thereof) becoming a slogan for people seeking to create a more positive image for the wolf. Several non-fatal attacks including the April 26, 2000, attack on a 6-year-old boy in Icy Bay, Alaska, seriously challenged the assumption that healthy wild wolves were harmless. The event was considered unusual and was reported in newspapers throughout the entire United States.Boyd, Diane K. \\"(Case Study) Wolf Habituation as a Conservation Conundrum\\". In: Groom, M. J. et al (n.d.) Principles of Conservation Biology, 3rd ed., Sinauer Associates. Following the Icy Bay incident, biologist Mark E. McNay compiled a record of wolf-human encounters in Canada and Alaska from 1915 to 2001. Of the 80 described encounters, 39 involved aggressive behavior from apparently healthy wolves and 12 from animals confirmed to be rabid.McNay, Mark E.

Students attend seven classes per day, five days a week. Prior to entering the eleventh grade, students choose a course of study that reflects where they intend to pursue university studies. *ACP Curriculum Those students wishing to attend non-Japanese universities and who are deemed capable of embracing a rigorous academic program and workload enter the American College Preparation(ACP)program. This prepares students for undergraduate study in western universities, whilst also providing continued language support in ESL classes. In the senior year, students have the opportunity to take Advanced Placement(AP)courses in either Calculus or Studio Art. *JCP Curriculum KLAS students who plan to return to Japan for undergraduate studies take the Japanese College Preparation(JCP)program. Nevertheless, up to half of their weekly classes are offered in English, reflecting the core mission of KLAS as a bilingual educational institution. JCP students prepare for study at a Japanese university but, with their ever-developing English skills, the possibility for further studies at a non-Japanese university remains very strong.

They chose their name (derived from Mount Vesuvius) because, in their words, \\"Like lava, so long held back, that must at last pour out around us, [our idea of feminist equality] is in no way incendiary but in all ways regenerating.\\" With the overthrow of King Louis- Philippe of France in 1848, the newly formed Republic lifted all restrictions on the press and assembly. This encouraged a proliferation of new feminist publications, organizations, and groups. The V√©suviennes were among the latter. Considered to be the most radical of all of the feminist factions of the time, the V√©suviennes promoted female military service, the right of women to dress the same as men, and legal and domestic equality between husband and wife, even as that extended to the distribution of household chores. Most V√©suviennes were between the ages of 15 and 30, unmarried, poorly paid workers. Even some other feminists disapproved of their tactics, which included wearing culottes (not unlike the bloomers worn by radical American feminists at the time) and staging frequent street demonstrations. The image of a young woman in culottes came to represent all feminists to some, as can be seen in the caricatures of , one of several artists who satirized the efforts of feminists of the period in popular political papers such as Le Charivari. Until recently the existence of this feminist organization was regarded as genuine, if poorly documented. Some historians have recently argued that the organisation was itself \\"a burlesque creation of the French police who drew up a constitution for it and provided it with prostitutes as members\\".

Character fictional life =Early life= According to the novel and film in which he appears, David \\"Noodles\\" Aaronson is born in either 1903 or 1904 into poverty in a Jewish enclave in Manhattan's Lower East Side. In 1918, when Noodles is age 14 or 15, he forms a gang with his friends Phillip \\"Cockeye\\" Stein, Patrick \\"Patsy\\" Goldberg and a young Italian boy named Dominic. Together the group \\"rolls\\" (robs) drunks in a bar run by local Irish- American mobster Bugsy, whose protection racket they help maintain. When about to roll a drunk, Noodles meets Maximilian \\"Max\\" Bercovicz. The two cross paths later, become friends, and together blackmail a policeman, forcing him to pay for their times with a local prostitute and to cover up their crimes. When they begin to operate independently of him, Bugsy has some of the gang's underlings beat them and steal their money. Needing protection from Bugsy, Noodles and Max meet with the Capuano brothers, successful bootleggers, and show them a method by which the bootleggers might salvage crates of booze when tossed into the sea when the rumrunners cargo boats were confronted by the Coast Guard. Having been paid for their services in protecting the Capuanos' shipment, they stash part of their payment. After stashing their money, the group is chased by Bugsy, who opens fire on them and kills Dominic. Enraged, Noodles stabs Bugsy repeatedly, almost disemboweling him. However, when Bugsy fires a round from his gun it alerts nearby police officers who then come to the scene. Noodles murders Bugsy and then takes on two police officers, stabbing one and then being battered unconscious by his partner. Noodles is then sent to prison. =1933= After serving 12 years for the murder, Noodles is released from prison and picked up by Max. He returns to working with his gang. Mobster Frankie Minaldi gives the gang an assignment to rob a Detroit jeweler of some jewels together with 'Joe from Detroit' and then kill him. The gang does the job, Noodles rapes the woman who gave Joe the information needed to pull off the job, and they later shoot Joe and his gang in a car, with Noodles personally gunning down one of Joe's henchmen who had escaped the car and fled into a factory. The gang becomes further involved with the Mafia, and Noodles becomes re-involved with Deborah, a girl from his old neighborhood with whom he had had a relationship. He goes with her on an extravagant date, but he is left feeling rejected after she informs him she is leaving for Hollywood. She kisses him on the car ride home, but he refuses to stop and rapes her in front of his chauffeur. Max is eager to advance the gang's position, while Noodles has misgivings about what they are doing. After the repeal of Prohibition, Noodles leaves for Florida rather than join Max in working with the teamsters union. Max yields and goes to Florida with him, but then begins planning an impossible heist of the Federal Reserve Bank. After Noodles places an anonymous call, Max, Patsy, and Cockeye are killed in a gunfight with the police. Noodles' new girlfriend is murdered by the Syndicate, and Noodles hides out in an opium den. He escapes his pursuers and goes to retrieve the loot the gang had stashed years previously. When he finds the money gone, he flees to Buffalo, where he lives for 35 years under the name 'Robert Williams'. =1968= Years later, Noodles returns to New York from hiding, having received a mysterious letter. He visits the mausoleum where his friends' bodies were moved and discovers a plaque dedicated to them by him (something he had not done) and a key to the same money locker he had found empty in 1933. In the locker he finds money and a note stating it is pre-payment for a murder-for-hire. He also receives an invitation to a party from a man called Bailey. He learns that Deborah has become a famous actress, and while meeting with Deborah after a performance, he seemingly reconciles with her. However, he also knows through his investigations regarding Bailey that Deborah knows who Bailey is and realises that Max is Bailey, when his son appears who looks like Max in his adolescent years. He also learns that Max faked his own death in the shootout with help from the Syndicate, killed his friends for that purpose, stole the money and became \\"Bailey\\", a very rich man currently under investigation for corruption. Bailey had left the money to hire Noodles to assassinate him - thus allowing Noodles to obtain his revenge, as well as to let Max, as \\"Bailey\\", die with dignity, because he knows he is finished because of this investigation. However, Noodles refuses. After leaving the party, Noodles perhaps witnesses the suicide of Max, who leaves the party after him and maybe throws himself into a garbage truck, which drives past in front of Noodles. Noodles feels happiness after this event and is at peace with his past now, being able to move on with his life from now on, without having to look back anymore. And he does. Analysis Film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote that the character of Noodles, as an underworld Hamlet, develops through the story to become one of its two heroes. The jumping backward and forward in time in Once Upon A Time In America is done through the memories of Noodles, showing how Noodles is haunted by his involvement in the deaths of his childhood companions. In Cinema and Multiculturalism, it is offered that while the story Once Upon a Time in America is ostensibly about the \\"children of immigrants scraping the bottom of the American melting pot\\" and about \\"Jewish criminal kingpin David \\"Noodles\\" Aaronson, who dreams of greatness 'once upon a time', and spends the rest of his days wondering why his salad days wilted\\", they offer that the film is more \\"about time itself, and how Noodles learns that it's more important to make sense of your life, your own history\\". =Casting of Robert De Niro= Robert De Niro was not the first choice for the role of Noodles in Once Upon a Time in America; director Sergio Leone originally considered G√©rard Depardieu, and James Cagney for the older Noodles. De Niro had to convince Leone of his ability to portray Noodles in both the character's twenties and his sixties, and of his focus on character authenticity.

Brown taken from the scoreboard of PNC Park on June 19, 2010, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. during the pre-game activities honoring the 50th anniversary of the 1960 Pittsburgh Pirates World Series team. Joe LeRoy Brown (September 1, 1918 ‚Äì August 15, 2010) was an American front office executive in Major League Baseball. Brown served as the general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates from November 1, 1955, through the end of the 1976 season. Under his administration, the Pirates recovered from four consecutive last- place finishes in the National League to world championships in 1960 and 1971. Led by the great Baseball Hall of Fame players Roberto Clemente and Willie Stargell, the Bucs became consistent contenders for much of Brown's 21-year tenure, finishing in the first division six times between 1956 and 1968, and capturing five National League East Division titles from 1969 through 1976. Early life Brown was a native of New York, but grew up in Southern California. The son of actor-comedian Joe E. Brown (Some Like It Hot), he inherited his father's passion for baseball. Brown first met Branch Rickey, his predecessor in Pittsburgh, when Brown was 16 years of age, in 1935. He entered minor league baseball after his graduation from UCLA in 1939 as a front-office official with the Lubbock Hubbers of the Class D West Texas‚ÄìNew Mexico League. He served in the United States Army Air Forces during the World War II era, then joined the administrative staff of the Hollywood Stars of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1946. Pittsburgh Pirates Brown came to the Pittsburgh organization in 1950 as business manager of their Waco Pirates farm team in the Class B Big State League, then their New Orleans Pelicans club in the Double-A Southern Association. He joined the Pittsburgh front office in 1955, reunited with Rickey, who was in his final season as general manager. When Rickey, 73, retired to become the club's board chairman at the close of the 1955 campaign, Brown was the unanimous choice of that board (which also included part-owner Bing Crosby, the entertainer) to succeed him. Brown's first order of business was to find a successor to fired skipper Fred Haney. While his first choice, Bobby Bragan, was a misfire, Brown struck gold in August 1957 when he replaced Bragan with Danny Murtaugh, a former Pirate second baseman then in his second season as a coach. Under Murtaugh, the Bucs became contenders in 1958, finishing in second place, won the 1960 and 1971 World Series, and three more NL East titles (1970; 1974‚Äì75). Although he twice was compelled to step down for health reasons, Murtaugh would serve four separate terms as Brown's field manager (1957‚Äì64; 1967; 1970‚Äì71; 1973‚Äì76), and compile a 1,115‚Äì950 (.540) record. Two months after Brown's and Murtaugh's joint retirement after the campaign, Murtaugh suffered a fatal stroke at age 59. Legacy Brown maintained and built upon the strong scouting and player development system created during Rickey's term as the Bucs' general manager. He also swung multiple shrewd trades, acquiring players such as Harvey Haddix, Smoky Burgess, Bill Virdon, Don Hoak, Hal Smith and Vinegar Bend Mizell, who would play key roles in Pittsburgh's 1960 championship. His 1971 club was almost exclusively produced from the Pirates' strong farm system, which mined talent from the Caribbean and Latin America. Brown would frequently accompany fabled scout Howie Haak on Haak's trips to Latin America. Retirement After almost a decade of semi-retirement (he remained a Southern California-based scout for the Bucs) Brown was called back into harness in 1985 to serve as acting general manager as the Pirates, rocked by a drug scandal, poor play and falling attendance, were sold by the John W. Galbreath family to a local consortium. He died on August 15, 2010, in Albuquerque, New Mexico at the age of 91.

He wrote for the Italian newspaper La Stampa, and was a well known television- personality in Italy. Zeri was born in central Rome, and graduated from Sapienza University of Rome in 1945. Not wishing to enter the academic world, he worked in the Ministry of Public Education until 1952. In 1948 he was nominated director of Galleria Spada in Rome. In 1963 Zeri was among the founding members of the Getty Villa's board of trustees. He left in 1984, after his argument that the Getty kouros was a forgery and should not be bought, was rejected. Following this episode, Zeri became notorious for denouncing forgeries and mis-attributions. In 1984, when four students in Livorno hoaxed both the city and Modigliani experts into believing that a group of sculptures they have made were authentic, he was one of the few who called on their amateurish style. Zeri also argued that some of the frescoes in the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi, were made by of Pietro Cavallini and not Giotto. Zeri's insistence that a painting can be attributed to an artist, by means of a careful examination or connoisseurship, without resort to external evidence such as documents or dates, met controversial responses. Zeri edited and researched catalogues of the collections of many institutions, including the Frederick Mason Perkins collection in the Sacro Convento in Assisi; Accademia Carrara; Museo Civico Amedeo Lia, La Spezia; Galleria Spada, Rome; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; The Walters Art Museum, Baltimore. and Narodna Galerija in Ljubljana (with Ksenija Rozman). Zeri died at the age of 77, in his villa in Mentana on October 5, 1998. He bequeathed his estate to the University of Bologna, complete with his library and papers, a collection of about 400 ancient inscriptions and a grand collection of photographs. Most photographs documented artworks from Italy and elsewhere, some done by himself and some acquired from other collections. The collections and accompanying database are managed, partly digitized, by the Federico Zeri Foundation. All through his life, Zeri maintained close connections with Bernard Berenson, Roberto Longhi, and his teacher Pietro Toesca. he taught art history professor at the University of Rome,Italian Art Critic Zeri Dies.

As of 2010, production was around 300 to 400 frames per year, with 20% being exported outside the United Kingdom; in the same period, touring bicycles accounted for around 67% of Mercian's production, with track bicycles making up another 25%. Frames are generally custom-built to a rider's required dimensions, and may use hand-cut lugs. Mercian frames were traditionally built using steel, originally Reynolds 531, though as of 2010, newer steels such as Reynolds 853 and Reynolds 953 and part-carbon construction were in use. Before steel was superseded by lighter materials, riders using Mercian won national and international competitions. From the original founders, the business passed to Ethel Crowther, ex-wife of founder Tom Crowther. It then passed to Mercian framebuilder Bill Betton. In 2002, Mercian Cycles was acquired by Grant Mosely and Jane Mosely. Mercian has recently commissioned frame colour schemes from designer Sir Paul Smith, who owns and rides several Mercian track bikes.

The extent of the basin area is estimated at between 1,270 km2 (490 mi2) and 1700 km2 (656 mi2). The basin floor comprises fields watered by a channel of the Nile, the Bahr Yussef, as it drains into a desert hollow to the west of the Nile Valley. The Bahr Yussef veers west through a narrow neck of land north of Ihnasya, between the archaeological sites of El Lahun and Gurob near Hawara; it then branches out, providing rich agricultural land in the Faiyum basin, draining into the large saltwater Lake Moeris (Birket Qarun). The lake was freshwater in prehistory but is today a saltwater lake. It is a source for tilapia and other fish for the local area. Differing from typical oases, whose fertility depends on water obtained from springs, the cultivated land in the Faiyum is formed of Nile mud brought down by the Bahr Yussef, 24 km (15 miles) in length. Between the beginning of Bahr Yussef at El Lahun to its end at the city of Faiyum, several canals branch off to irrigate the Faiyum Governorate. The drainage water flows into Lake Moeris.  History  Survey of the Moeris Basin from the late 19th century When the Mediterranean Sea was a hot dry hollow near the end of the Messinian Salinity Crisis in the late Miocene, Faiyum was a dry hollow, and the Nile flowed past it at the bottom of a canyon (which was deep or more where Cairo is today). After the Mediterranean reflooded at the end of the Miocene, the Nile canyon became an arm of the sea reaching inland further than Aswan. Over geological time that sea arm gradually filled with silt and became the Nile valley. Eventually the Nile valley bed silted up high enough to let the Nile periodically overflow into the Faiyum Hollow and make a lake in it. The lake is first recorded from about 3000 BC, around the time of Menes (Narmer). However, for the most part it would only be filled with high flood waters. The lake was bordered by neolithic settlements, and the town of Crocodilopolis grew up on the south where the higher ground created a ridge. In 2300 BC, the waterway from the Nile to the natural lake was widened and deepened to make a canal which is now known as the Bahr Yussef. This canal fed into the lake. This was meant to serve three purposes: control the flooding of the Nile, regulate the water level of the Nile during dry seasons, and serve the surrounding area with irrigation. There is evidence of ancient Egyptian pharaohs of the twelfth dynasty using the natural lake of Faiyum as a reservoir to store surpluses of water for use during the dry periods. The immense waterworks undertaken by the ancient Egyptian pharaohs of the twelfth dynasty to transform the lake into a huge water reservoir gave the impression that the lake itself was an artificial excavation, as reported by classic geographers and travellers.Catholic Encyclopedia: Egypt The lake was eventually abandoned due to the nearest branch of the Nile dwindling in size from 230 BC. A scenic view of Faiyum Oasis in 2008 Faiyum was known to the ancient Egyptians as the twenty-first nome of Upper Egypt, Atef-Pehu (\\"Northern Sycamore\\"). In ancient Egyptian times, its capital was Sh-d-y-t (usually written \\"Shedyt\\"),Hieroglyphic writing did not have vowels, so spellings vary as to use of vowels for names in Egyptian culture. Hieroglyphic pronunciation was indicated by determinatives which showed what sort of meaning the word had. called by the Greeks Crocodilopolis, and refounded by Ptolemy II as Arsinoe. This region has the earliest evidence for farming in Egypt, and was a center of royal pyramid and tomb-building in the Twelfth dynasty of the Middle Kingdom, and again during the rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty. Faiyum became one of the breadbaskets of the Roman world. For the first three centuries AD, the people of Faiyum and elsewhere in Roman Egypt not only embalmed their dead but also placed a portrait of the deceased over the face of the mummy wrappings, shroud or case. The Egyptians continued their practice of burying their dead, despite the Roman preference for cremation. Preserved by the dry desert environment, these Faiyum portraits make up the richest body of portraiture to have survived from antiquity. They provide us with a window into a remarkable society of peoples of mixed origins‚ÄîEgyptians, Greeks, Romans, Syrians, Libyans and others‚Äîthat flourished 2,000 years ago in Faiyum. The Faiyum portraits were painted on wood in a pigmented wax technique called encaustic. In the late 1st millennium AD, the arable area shrank, and settlements around the edge of the basin were abandoned. These sites include some of the best-preserved from the late Roman Empire, notably Karanis, and from the Byzantine and early Arab Periods, though recent redevelopment has greatly reduced the archaeological features. \\"Colonial-type\\" village names (villages named after towns elsewhere in Egypt and places outside Egypt) show that much land was brought into cultivation in the Faiyum in the Greek and Roman periods.For late-period Ancient Egyptian names of the Faiyum oasis and places within it, see http://fayum.arts.kuleuven.be/general/name.html According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, in 1910 over 1,000 km2 (400 mile2) of the Faiyum Oasis was cultivated, the chief crops being cereals and cotton. The completion of the Aswan Low Dam ensured a fuller supply of water, which enabled 20,000 acres (80 km2) of land, previously unirrigated and untaxed, to be brought under cultivation in the three years 1903-1905. Three crops were obtained in twenty months. The province was noted for its figs and grapes of exceptional quality. Olives were also cultivated. Rose trees were very numerous, and most of the attar of roses of Egypt was manufactured in the province. Faiyum also possessed an excellent breed of sheep. Archaeology There are, especially in the neighborhood of the lake, many ruins of ancient villages and cities. Mounds north of the city of Faiyum mark the site of Crocodilopolis/Arsinoe. There are extensive archaeological remains across the region which extend from the prehistoric period through to modern times, e.g. the Monastery of the Archangel Gabriel at Naqlun. Birket Qarun lake left Birket Qarun (Arabic for Lake of Qarun), is located in the Faiyum Oasis and has an abundant population of fish, notably bulti, of which considerable quantities are sent to Cairo. In ancient times this lake was much larger, and the ancient Greeks and Romans called it Lake Moeris. Cities and towns The largest city is Faiyum, which is also the capital of the Faiyum Governorate. Other towns include Sinnuris and Tamiya to the north of Faiyum, and Sanhur and Ibsheway on the road to the lake.

History Bliss first logo (2006‚Äì2008) It launched in March 2006 and was advertised as Total Chill-out Classics. The channel played classic pop songs and music from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, along with hours dedicated to love songs and power ballads. Every day for three hours at 9am and 7pm, there was a weekly themed slot, such as Blissful Divas, music from female artists, or Bliss at The Movies, music from films. These themed slots changed every Monday. Throughout the year the channel had days dedicated to boy bands, love songs and other types of music depending on dates such as Valentines Day. The channel also shows some newer music videos which fit in with its chill-out theme. For the channel's original on-screen look, the Bliss logo was a gold colour with a shine moving across it every few seconds. The logo was placed in the bottom left-hand corner during music videos and the song information was shown in a gold coloured bar at the start and near the end of each music video. The channel's identity was also seen before and after advert breaks when the Bliss logo slowly came out of an opening flower. During 2008, Bliss received a new look, with its logo changing to plain white lettering with 'BLISS' in capitals. The song information now appears in a cloud type graphic which forms in the middle of the screen. As of May 2010, the song information appeared at the bottom of the screen. The logo is also seen before and after advert breaks when a growing flower or flying butterfly goes across the screen, revealing the Bliss logo behind it. The channel replaced another music channel called The Amp because it failed to reach a wide enough audience. Bliss was available 24 hours a day on Sky channel 376 and was part of a bouquet of music channels owned by CSC Media. On 12 May 2008, a +1 timeshift channel called Bliss +1 was launched. It was available 24 hours a day on Sky channel 363. On 2 June 2008, Bliss +1 was closed to make way for a 24-hour stream for AnimeCentral, a channel also owned by CSC Media Group. This allowed Pop Girl, which used to time-share with AnimeCentral, to extend its hours to 24 hours a day. On 3 March 2008, the Bliss website was launched. The website included TV listings, music videos, news, competitions and an online community area. Several programmes on Bliss made use of the website, for example welovebliss.com was a programme which played the most requested songs, as voted for on the Bliss website. Throughout November and December, Bliss became \\"Blissmas\\" and was a Christmas music channel and it played mostly Christmas music 24/7. On 1 February 2011, Bliss launched on the free-to-air satellite platform Freesat on channel 517. It moved to channel 506 on 13 September 2012. It was removed along with Flava on 21 July 2014. Bliss was axed on 27 November 2015 after nine years, while in the middle of its annual run as Blissmas. In 2018, Christmas music moved to its sister music channel Chart Show Hits (called Chart Show Dance at time of closure). Bliss removals On 6 November 2007, Bliss along with sister music channels Scuzz and Flaunt, were removed from Virgin Media's ex-NTL platform as a deal with Chart Show Channels could not be made to make the channels available on the ex-Telewest platform as well.

Work of Johannes in Iceland. 10th century Eyrarland statue of Thor, the Norse god of thunder, found in Iceland. Iceland was Christianized in the year 1000 CE, when Christianity became the religion by law. In Icelandic, this event is known as the kristnitaka (literally, \\"the taking of Christianity\\"). The vast majority of the initial settlers of Iceland during the settlement of Iceland in the 9th and 10th centuries CE were pagan, worshipping the √Üsir (the Norse gods). Beginning in 980, Iceland was visited by several Christian missionaries who had little success; but when Olaf Tryggvason (who had converted around 998) ascended to the Norwegian throne, there were many more converts, and the two rival religions soon divided the country and threatened civil war. After war broke out in Denmark and Norway, the matter was submitted to arbitration at the Althing. Law speaker and pagan Thorgeir Thorkelsson proposed \\"one law and one religion\\" after which baptism and conversion to Christianity became compulsory.  Sources  According to Nj√°ls saga the Althing in 1000 declared Christianity as the official religion. Iceland's adoption of Christianity is traditionally ascribed to the year 1000 (although some historians would place it in the year 999). The major sources for the events preceding the adoption of Christianity are Ari Thorgilsson's Book of the Icelanders, the Icelandic family sagas and Church writings about the first bishops and preachers. Ari's account of the events surrounding the conversion seems to be reliable; although he was born 67 years after the conversion, he cites first-hand sources.  Missionaries  Beginning in 980, Iceland was visited by several missionaries. The first of these seems to have been an Icelander returning from abroad, one Thorvald Konradsson. Accompanying Thorvald was a Saxon bishop named Fridrek, about whom little is known, but it is said he baptized Thorvald. Thorvald's attempts to convert Icelanders met with limited success. His father Konrad was the first to convert and then his family. He and the bishop visited different districts before arriving at the Althing, but their attempts were met with ridicule and even insulting skaldic verses. Thorvald killed two of the men and clashes continued between Thorvald's followers and pagans. Thorvald left Iceland in 986 on an expedition to Eastern Europe where he is said to have died not long after.  Pressure from Kings of Norway  When Olaf Tryggvason ascended the throne of Norway, the effort to Christianize Iceland intensified. King Olaf sent an Icelander named Stefnir Thorgilsson back to his homeland to convert his fellow countrymen. Stefnir violently destroyed sanctuaries and images of the heathen gods ‚Äì this made him so unpopular that he was eventually declared an outlaw. After Stefnir's failure, Olaf sent a priest named Thangbrand. Thangbrand was an experienced missionary, having proselytized in Norway and the Faroe Islands. His mission in Iceland from c. 997‚Äì999 was only partly successful. He managed to convert several prominent Icelandic chieftains, but killed two or three men in the process.It was Ari fr√≥√∞i who used the exact phrase \\"two or three men\\" (√çslendingab√≥k ch. 7). The murders are also described in Kristni saga, Nj√°ls saga, Landn√°mab√≥k, and several other sources. Thangbrand's victims included the skalds Thorvaldr veili and Vetrlidi Sumarlidason, and probably also Vetrlidi's son. Thangbrand returned to Norway in 999 and reported his failure to King Olaf, who immediately adopted a more aggressive stance towards the Icelanders. He refused Icelandic seafarers access to Norwegian ports and took as hostages several Icelanders then dwelling in Norway. This cut off all trade between Iceland and its main trading partner. Some of the hostages taken by King Olaf were the sons of prominent Icelandic chieftains, whom he threatened to kill unless the Icelanders accepted Christianity. In the 11th century, three Armenian bishops, Petros, Abraham and Stephannos are recorded by Icelandic sources as Christian missionaries in Iceland. Their presence has been explained in terms of the service of King Harald Hardrada of Norway (c.1047‚Äì1066) as a Varangian in Constantinople, where he had met Armenians serving in the Byzantine Imperial Army.A.E. Redgate, The Armenians, Blackwell Publishers, 1998, 2000, pp. 233‚Äì234. The Icelandic Commonwealth's limited foreign policy consisted almost entirely of maintaining good relations with Norway. The Christians in Iceland used the King's pressure to step up efforts at conversion. The two rival religions soon divided the country and threatened civil war.  Adoption by arbitration  A 19th-century depiction of the Al√æingi of the Commonwealth in session at √ûingvellir The Go√∞afoss waterfall, named after the pagan idols thrown into it after the adoption of Christianity This state of affairs reached a high point the next summer during the meeting of the Althing (Al√æingi), the Commonwealth's governing assembly. Fighting between adherents of the rival religions seemed likely until mediators intervened and the matter was submitted to arbitration. The law speaker of the Althing, Thorgeir Thorkelsson, the gothi of Lj√≥savatn, was acceptable to both sides as mediator, being known as a moderate and reasonable man. Thorgeir accepted responsibility for deciding whether Iceland should become Christian, with the condition that both parties abide by his decision. When this was agreed, he spent a day and a night resting under a fur blanket, contemplating. The following day he announced that Iceland was to become Christian, with the condition that old laws concerning the exposure of infants and the eating of horseflesh would remain, and that private pagan worship be permitted. These sticking points related to long-established customs that ran contrary to the laws of the Church. Horsemeat is a taboo food in many cultures, and Pope Gregory III had banned the Germanic custom of its consumption in 732. Likewise, infanticide used to be widespread around the world, and the practice of exposing \\"surplus\\" children was an established part of old Icelandic culture. Thorgeir, who was himself a pagan priest, took his pagan idols and threw them into a large waterfall, which is now known as Waterfall of the Gods (Icelandic: Go√∞afoss). The problem of changing religions was thus solved, as people abided by Thorgeir's decision and were baptized. Civil war was averted via arbitration. Iceland's peaceful adoption is in many ways remarkable, given the decades of civil strife before Norway became fully Christian. A likely explanation is that the major gothi chieftains of Iceland preferred religious change to civil strife. Once the Church was firmly in control in Iceland, horsemeat, infanticide, and pagan rituals practiced in private were banned.Gwyn Jones, The North Atlantic Saga: Being the Norse Voyages of Discovery and Settlement to Iceland, Greenland, and North America, Oxford University Press, 1986, pp. 149‚Äì51.

It is situated in the Ruma municipality, in the Srem District, Vojvodina province. The village has the population of 1,506 (2011 census).  Location  The village is located west of its municipal seat, town of Ruma. It is stretched along the both sides of the Ruma-Sremska Mitrovica road, which southwest of the village crosses both the railway and highway Belgrade-Zagreb. It functions as an adjoining suburb of Ruma as it almost makes one continuously built-up area with it.  Geography  Voganj is a rural settlement of the semi-compact type. It is located on the loess plateau at an altitude of . It covers an area of and statistically consists of two cadastre municipalities: Voganj () and Marƒëelos (). It is a typical road settlement, stretched along the road. It consists of two parts: much larger Voganj (simply referred to as Selo, village) and smaller and separated Erem. East of the village flows the river Kudo≈°, separating Voganj and Ruma, while on the west a creek Manƒçelov Gat passes next to the settlement. Both streams stretch in the north-south direction and flow into the Sava river. = Erem = Erem is a hamlet of Voganj, to the west. It is connected to the rest of the village via the street which splits off the Ruma-Sremska Mitrovica road near the Voganj railway station. Erem developed after World War II and was settled by the colonists from the regions of Herzegovina (today in Bosnia and Herzegovina) and Lika and Kordun (today in Croatia). In 2018, Erem consisted of 33 houses centered around one, long street with some 100 inhabitants. The area was a wasteland. In the mid-18th century, the counts from the Pejaƒçeviƒá family held large herds of pigs and cattle in the area of modern Erem and also built the quarters for their servants with families. Next to the stables they built the railway station, one of the oldest in Syrmia. Modern Voganj railway station is located on the same place. There is no definite answer on the origin of the hamlet's name. Theories include the Hungarian name for joy (√∂r√∂m), Greek word erƒìmitƒìs (hermit, a man living in the wasteland), and French ermitage, a secluded place. The settlement is entirely agricultural. In 2010s the waterworks was introduced.  History  Voganj is mentioned for the first time in 1339. It has been continuously populated since the early 18th century. A church dedicated to the Translation of the Relics of Saint Nicholas from Myra to Bari was built in 1756. In 1807, the village was the center of the rebellion of the Syrmian peasants, which was known as the Tican's Rebellion. Voganj was electrified in 1913 and the second church, dedicated to Saint Petka, was built in 1938. Telephone lines were conducted in 1978 and the waterworks in 1983. The village has a lower-grades elementary school \\"Veljko Dugo≈°eviƒá\\", healthcare center, post office and a railway station, which is located outside of the village, to the southwest.  Population  According to the latest census, Voganj had 1,506 inhabitants in 2011, and has been steadily depopulating since the 1980s. The village has a Serb ethnic majority. Serbian population is mixed, being of both origins: old, local population and colonists from the planned colonization in the years after World War II. The two most spread slavas (festivity of family saint protectors) are Saint John and Saint Nicholas.  Economy  The main branches of economy are crop farming and husbandry.

This species has a left-handed or sinistral shell. It eats mostly bivalves. There has been some disagreement about the correct scientific name for this species, which has been confused with Sinistrofulgur sinistrum Hollister, 1958, and Busycon contrarium (Conrad, 1840), which is an exclusively fossil species.Sartori, A.

Accessed on 2014-06-06 Distribution This marine species is native to the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States and southeastern North America, from New Jersey south to Florida and the Gulf states. Habitat Lightning whelks can be found in the sandy or muddy substrate of shallow embayments. Life habits This whelk species feeds primarily on marine bivalves, ingesting their soft parts using its proboscis. Sinistrofulgur perversum and Busycon carica This species shares many characteristics with another species, the knobbed whelk Busycon carica, but there are some important differences: *Lightning whelks are sinistral in coiling, whereas knobbed whelks are dextral *Lightning whelks have a lower spire than the knobbed whelk *The knobs of the lightning whelk are usually less well-developed than those of the knobbed whelk *Lightning whelks are diurnal, while knobbed whelks are active both day and night *Lightning whelks prefer to stay in deeper waters than the knobbed whelks when feeding on mud flats  Human use For thousands of years Native Americans used these animals as food, and used their shells for tools, ornaments, containers and to make jewelry, i.e. shell gorgets.Starr F. 1897.

Most students live locally, although the school attracts students from outside the priority area. The school is located on Myton Road in the town of Warwick in Warwickshire, England. The history of the school in its current form dates from 1968. the school has around 1,700 students. History The school started life as Warwick School, a mixed-sex, non-selective secondary school which was opened in 1954. In 1959 Oken became Oken High School for Boys when the girls were transferred to the newly established Beauchamp High School for Girls. The two single-sex schools had each moved to the site that Myton School presently occupies and they were amalgamated in 1968. Since then the school has grown substantially as the size of each school year has increased, 11-year-olds were admitted for the first time in 1996 (when Warwickshire changed its secondary school start date to a year earlier) and as the Sixth Form has grown in size. The school became a grant maintained school in 1992, and a foundation school after grant maintained status was abolished by the incoming Labour government in 1997. Under the government's school specialisation funding scheme it has become a specialist Science College. On 1 July 2011, the school became an academy.  Traditions  Each student in year 7 to 11 belongs to one of the Houses (Beauchamp, Leycester, Greville, Montgomery and Oken) and participates in events to earn points for their particular House. Colours are awarded in subjects such as Science, Art, Eco- Club, Music, Drama and various sports in recognition of attendance, effort, commitment and achievement over the year. Controversy Myton School caused outrage in November 2015 from its decision to board up one of the most important murals of the artist Alan Sorrell. The School justified this act in a Newsletter under the Heading \\"Sorrell mural protected for future generations\\", saying \\"In the instance of our lower school reception, which acts as the main student entrance to the school, we felt that the whole area needed to be adapted to create a bright, engaging and stimulating entrance for our students.\\" The unique mural has been covered by plastic boards with slogans such as Enthusiasm and zest, Self Control and, ironically, Curiosity.http://www.mytonschool.co.uk/weekly-newsletter/sorrell-mural- protected-for-future-generations/#more-17901 The mural has now been Listed Grade II.

The species was first described by Jean Baptiste Boisduval in 1847. An adult can measure across its wingspan and from head to the tip of its elongated tail-like second pair of wings. Its forward wings have a distinctive grey-coloured \\"furry\\" leading edge, giving a very rough surface, presumably for aerodynamic reasons.

Biography =Early life= Sharlet was born and raised in Glens Falls, New York, a small town in the foothills of the Adirondacks, and later in the state capital of Albany. In 1960 he graduated from The Albany Academy, a private military academy. =Military training and assignment: Philippines= Restless during his first year of college, Sharlet withdrew and decided to fulfill his military obligation. In return for a three-year enlistment in the United States Army Security Agency (ASA), a communications intelligence outfit, he was promised a year's training in a Slavic language followed by a European posting. But at the Army Language School he was bumped into the Vietnamese language course. He and fellow students spent six hours a day in class over 11¬Ω months. In early 1963 Sharlet was sent to Clark Air Base in the Philippines where he was assigned to the 9th ASASee 9th United States Army Security Agency, ( and select \\"About 9th UASAFS\\"). at Stotsenberg Field Station as a Vietnamese translator/interpreter. With a Top Secret/Cryptographic security clearance he and fellow linguists monitored Vietnam People's Army radio communications. Vietnam duty In late August 1963 Sharlet and a small team of linguists were flown to Saigon on short notice and transferred to the Army Security Agency's 3rd Radio Research Unit, Davis Station, named after the first American GI killed in combat during the Vietnam War,ASA Specialist Four James T. Davis (see Richard B. Fitzgibbon, Jr.) was killed in a Viet Cong ambush outside Saigon on December 22, 1961. See . at Tan Son Nhut Air Base outside the capital. The transfer occurred at the time of the secret US-backed coup planning by South Vietnamese generals against the Ngo Dinh Diem regime.On the South Vietnamese military's coup planning and the Kennedy Administration's involvement resulting in the overthrow and death of President Ngo Dinh Diem on November 1, 1963, see Grant, Facing the Phoenix, pp. 198‚Äì215, based on extensive interviews with Lucien Conein, the CIA operative who served as liaison between the White House and the coup plotters; Prados, The White House Tapes: Eavesdropping on the President: A Book and CD Set, especially the audio on JFK's meetings with his secret committee on the coup planning on disks 2 & 3; and Dommen, The Indochinese Experience of the French and the Americans, pp. 520‚Äì59, based on declassified State Department cables and CIA reports between Saigon and Washington, D.C., on the progress and final execution of the coup plans. From Davis Station, Sharlet and seven others were dispatched to Ph√∫ L√¢m, a US Signals base, where they worked on a remote corner of the base apart from Army signals personnel. Each day's product was sent by heavily armed jeep down to Tan Son Nhut from where it was airlifted to Washington, D.C. for analysis at the National Security Agency. Very shortly before the November 1 coup which overthrew Diem, Sharlet and the special team were pulled out and ordered back to Clark Air Base in the Philippines. By then, as he later related to family, he was beginning to experience doubts about the U.S. mission in Vietnam. A few months later, Sharlet was shipped back to Vietnam, this time on the eve of the January 1964 South Vietnamese coup by General Nguyen Khanh against the junta on January 30. Following the quick success of the coup, Sharlet was reassigned north to Phu Bai,The Phu Bai military base was 9 miles SE of Hu·∫ø, capital of one of South Vietnam's northernmost provinces. See the map at which shows the village of Phu Bai just south of the ASA base. an Army Security Agency base just below the 1954 boundary between North and South Vietnam, the DMZ. There he was attached to Detachment J, a branch of the 3rd Radio Research Unit providing communications support for commando operations in North Vietnam.See The Pentagon Papers: As published by The New York Times, p. 238. Sharlet was also seconded to a nearby Marine intelligence unitOn the Marine 1st Composite Radio Company, see USMC, 1st Radio Battalion, Vietnam Veterans. On the composition and mission of the Marine unit, see Radio Battalion. for Long Range Reconnaissance Patrols. By the time he finished his Vietnam tour late May 1964, Sharlet had seen enough political corruption and military incompetence of the Army of the Republic of VietnamSee Brigham, ARVN: Life and Death in the South Vietnamese Army, especially ch. 5. n the disastrous Battle of Ap Bac (January, 1963) which became emblematic of the South Vietnamese Army's failures; see Halberstam's firsthand account in The Making of a Quagmire, pp. 146‚Äì62; and Sheehan's detailed discussion in \\"A Bright Shining Lie\\", pp. 212‚Äì65. (ARVN), often compounded by exaggerated, upbeat reports by U.S. military advisors, to become thoroughly disillusioned with U.S. involvement in what he considered a Vietnamese civil war. SDS days at Indiana University Sharlet returned to college fall of 1964, re-entering Indiana University (IU) in Bloomington where he majored in Political Science. In early 1965, the Vietnam War escalated with the launching of U.S. bombing raids against the North and the landing of Marine combat units in the South.On the launching of the bombing campaign, Operation Rolling Thunder, on March 2, 1965, and the landing of the first Marine combat battalions at Da Nang on March 8, 1965, see respectively Lewy, America in Vietnam, pp. 375‚Äì78 and 42-49. By April, student protest against the war had begun to spread on U.S. campuses. At IU, early organizers of a chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in 1965 included Bob and John Grove, Robin Hunter, Peter Montague, Karl North, Rick Ross, Bernella and David Satterfield, Jim Wallihan, and Sharlet.On the formation of the Indiana University chapter of Students for a Democratic Society in 1965, see Wynkoop, Dissent in the Heartland: The Sixties at Indiana University, pp. 36, 43-44, 46, and 51. In the fall of 1965 Sharlet joined SDS, and during his following two years at IU participated in, helped organize, or co-led SDS demonstrations against campus visits by several prominent pro-Vietnam War speakers, including former Vice President Richard Nixon, General Maxwell Taylor, General Lewis Blaine Hershey, and President Lyndon Baines Johnson when he spoke in nearby Indianapolis.On LBJ's appearance in Indianapolis on July 23, 1966 and the preemptive arrests of many of the IU SDS protestors, see Wynkoop, Dissent in the Heartland, pp. 44‚Äì45. On campus, he supported the protest against the arrest of two members of the leftist youth W.E.B. Du Bois Club,The first W.E.B. Du Bois Clubs, Marxist discussion groups named after a prominent African-American civil rights leader, were organized in the San Francisco Bay Area during 1963. The following year the national organization, W.E.B. Du Bois Clubs of America, was formed. See Freeman, At Berkeley in the Sixties, p. 27\\\\. By 1966 the national organization was under investigation by U.S. Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach. In September, Klein and Gurevitz were arrested on the IU campus for defying the university's ban on the Du Bois Club participating in the fall activities fair at the student union. Bruce Klein and Allen Gurevitz. During his tenure as SDS co-chairman Spring term 1967, with the help of Bob Tennyson, Sharlet took public issueSee Jeff Sharlet, \\"The Role of the New Left on the Campus: State of the Students, State of the University\\", The Spectator, March 13, 1967, pp. 3‚Äì6, for Sharlet's reply to IU President Elvis Stahr's remarks in an address to the university faculty. with IU President Elvis Jacob Stahr, Jr., a former Secretary of the Army, over his criticism of the New Left and later played a significant role in getting SDS activist Guy Loftman elected IU student body president.Sharlet, at the time SDS co-chairman, was a draftsman of the winning candidate's campaign platform. Guy Loftman, an SDS activist was declared victor in the election. See Indiana Daily Student, April 14, 1967, p. 1. Sharlet won a Woodrow Wilson Graduate FellowshipWoodrow Wilson Fellowships were awarded for graduate study through a national competition to seniors showing the greatest promise of becoming college teachers and covered graduate school tuition, room, and board. see . Recently the Woodrow Wilson Foundation honored Sharlet with a profile in its publication Fellowship (Fall 2008), pp. 7‚Äì8. which he chose to use at University of Chicago in its Political Science PhD program beginning fall 1967. Chicago and 'Vietnam GI' During his IU years Sharlet had pondered the question of how to give voice to opposition to the war which he knew existed among many Vietnam GIs. In the summer of 1967 he went to New York City where he met fellow ex-Vietnam GI Jan Barry CrumbJan Barry Crumb, who later shortened his name to Jan Barry, was founder and first president of Vietnam Veterans Against the War. See Nicosia, Home to War: A History of the Vietnam Veterans Movement, pp. 15‚Äì17. and joined his fledgling organization, Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW). Returning to Chicago Sharlet began graduate work, but by the end of the Fall term decided to withdraw to resume his anti-war work full-time. Using his Woodrow Wilson Fellowship funds, Sharlet launched the first GI-run anti-war paper addressed to GIs, calling it Vietnam GI (VGI). The first issue was dated January, 1968. His associate editor was David Komatsu, and the editorial board of ex-Vietnam GIs included Jan Barry, [Joseph Carey], William Harris, Peter Martinsen, Dink McCarter, James Pidgeon, Gary Rader, Francis Rocks, David Tuck, and James Zaleski. A civilian conscientious objector, Thomas Barton,See Barton's interview, \\"Jeff Sharlet and Vietnam GI\\", an \\"extra\\" feature on the DVD Sir! No Sir!: The Suppressed Story of the GI Movement to End the War in Vietnam, Displaced Films, New Video Group, 2006. Barton today sees himself carrying on Sharlet's work in his current role as editor of the daily online Iraq GI antiwar newsletter, GI Special, now known as Military Resistance archived at , which he conceives of as a continuation of Vietnam GI in the present context. He also assisted ex-Iraq GIs in organizing Iraq Veterans Against the War. served as VGI's East Coast distributor and was responsible for unobtrusively shipping bundles of the paper to Vietnam. right Vietnam GI quickly became a success among GIs stateside and in VietnamIn The New Winter Soldiers: GI and Veteran Dissent During the Vietnam Era, p. 104, Moser wrote that Vietnam GI \\"became one of the most successful soldier newspapers of the period.\\" While the press run for the first issue was relatively modest, Cortright in Soldiers in Revolt, p. 55 reported it was soon \\"exceeding fifteen thousand.\\" Reviewing the paper's history, Ostertag in People's Movements/People's Press, p. 126, concluded that \\"Vietnam GI set a standard of excellence unmatched in the underground GI press.\\" where soldiers like Terry DeMott, a helicopter door gunner in the Americal Division stationed near Chu Lai, and a number of sympathetic unit mail clerks helped circulate the paper surreptitiously. It was free to GIs, and requests for individual subscriptions as well as multiple copies for distribution in stateside barracks and Vietnam combat units soared, with the print run reaching 30,000 copies by fall 1968.See Franklin, Vietnam and Other American Fantasies, p. 106. Letters-to-the editor indicated that single copies passed through many hands. In August a separate \\"Stateside\\" edition of VGI was launched. Between issues, Sharlet worked wealthy liberal circles on both coasts for contributions to support production costs. Barbara Garson, author of MacBird, a widely performed anti-war play of the late 1960s, was an especially helpful West Coast contact. While traveling, Sharlet kept in touch with civilian activists running GI coffee houses outside major bases,On the organization of GI coffee houses, see Cortright, Soldiers in Revolt, pp. 53‚Äì54. For the military's reaction, see Ben A. Franklin, \\"Antiwar G.I.'s and Army Head for Clash Over Vietnam\\", The New York Times, April 28, 1969, p. 22. including Judy Olasov at Ft.

Plot  Two comrades and soldiers of the Red Army, Andrei Nekrasov (O. Yankovsky) and Ivan Karyakin (R. Bykov) were sent by their regimental commander (A. Papanov) on a reconnaissance mission to film the White Army fortifications on the way into Crimea (Perekop). After filming, the engine on their airplane stalled and they were forced to land in unfriendly territory. As the culmination of a series of misadventures, the friends were going to be executed as spies by their own side. The Colonel appears in time to stop the firing squad. The second part of the film narrates the assault on Perekop and the Red Army invasion of the Crimea. The film also features Vladimir Vysotsky as Brusentsov, a cynical and disillusioned officer in Wrangel's Army. He shot Nekrasov down at the end of the film. Karyakin hums his friend's favorite song - \\"The bullet whizzed and aha!..\\". Vysotsky's character later shot himself during the Evacuation to Constantinople. The film's focus is the friendship between two decidedly different characters. Nekrasov is intelligent and war-weary, while Karyakin is simple-minded, yet idealistic and energetic.

Seippel has a master's degree in business administration from American University. He received a bachelor's degree in science from George Mason University, where he currently serves as chairman of the advisory board for the School of Management. He received the Business School's Alumni of the Year award in 2009.

Design and development A Sunbeam Gurkha in the remains of a Short Type 184 at the Fleet Air Arm Museum. While Frederick Rutland's aeroplane survived the First World War intact, it was damaged by bombing during the Second World War. The first aero-engine from Louis Coatalen was the 110 hp, a water-cooled V-8 with side- valve cylinders of 80mm (3.15 in) bore and 150mm (5.9 in) stroke. The later versions of the engine, which had 90mm (3.5 in) bore cylinders, were known as the 150 hp until the Sunbeam naming system labelled it the Crusader in 1917. The 80mm bore versions were produced in limited numbers, mostly for civil use, but later 90mm bore engines had limited success in civil applications, with more than 226 built for military aircraft. Production examples were rated at 150 hp (112 kW) at 2,000 rpm, had a Bore of 90mm (3.5 in), stroke of 150mm (5.9 in), two valves per cylinder, and weighed 480 lb (220 kg) dry. The engine was used in a wide variety of British military aircraft during the first years of World War I, most notably the Short 827 seaplane for which six of the original versions were ordered followed by 107 of the more powerful type. Further development of the Crusader resulted in the Sunbeam Zulu and V-12 Sunbeam Mohawk and Sunbeam Gurkha. The Gurkha engine preserved at the Fleet Air Arm Museum, Yeovilton, Somerset, England, is the only surviving Sunbeam side-valve engine in the world. It is installed in the Short 184, aircraft number 8359, that played a minor role in the Battle of Jutland at the end of May 1916. The pilot on that occasion was Flight Lieutenant Frederick Rutland (who was ever after known as \\"Rutland of Jutland\\"), Variants ;110 hp :Early versions of the V-8 side-valve engine with 80mm (3.15in) bore, variations were rated at , and . ;150 hp :Introduced late in 1914, the 90mm (3.5in) bore versions were referred to as the 150hp and could be rated at or . ;160 hp :Original designation for the 100mm (3.94in) bore Sunbeam Zulu, derivative of the Crusader. ;200 hp :Initial version of the V-12 Mohawk built with 80mm (3.15in) bore, developing . The Admiralty required more powerful engines than the Crusader, so Coatalen designed the Sunbeam as a 60 degree V-12 using blocks of three cylinders instead of the twin-cylinder blocks of the Crusader. ;225 hp :Production versions built with 90mm (3.5in) bore, rated at . Short seaplanes using this engine were often called \\"225s\\". During 1917 this engine was re-named as the Sunbeam Mohawk. ;Crusader :The name Crusader was applied to the engine in 1917 after production had ceased, and officially referred only to the later '150hp' version. ;Zulu :Outwardly identical to the Crusader, the Zulu was developed during 1915, the bore was increased from 90 mm to 100 mm and the reduction gear ratio was changed to 1.86:1, allowing the engine to develop at 2000 rpm. 75 Zulus were built. ;Mohawk :The Mohawk was the Sunbeam 225hp re-named. ;Gurkha :The Gurkha was developed as a replacement for the Mohawk with a bore of 100 mm (3.94in) and the gear ratio was reduced to 1.86:1, giving at 2000 rpm.

(also known as USA) was an American company that was accused of fraud and shut down in the late 1980s. USA manufactured nutritional supplements such as \\"Master Formula\\", \\"Calorie Control Formula\\", \\"Fiber Energy Bar\\", and \\"Formula Plus\\", distributing them via multi-level marketing (a.k.a. pyramid marketing). The company experienced rapid growth in the 1980s, was heavily endorsed and marketed by various celebrities, and was marketed via over 140,000 distributors. However, an expos√© by NBC revealed fraudulent practices, and this was followed by multiple lawsuits from attorneys general in three different states. Several of the company's advisors resigned, and USA declared bankruptcy in 1987. Background The company was based in Carrollton, Texas, and chaired by Robert \\"Bobby\\" Adler (not the same person as, and not related to Robert Adler), with president Jerris Leonard, who had been a former U.S. assistant attorney general under Richard Nixon. Products were marketed with claims such as that they helped prevent cancer, AIDS, arthritis, alcoholism and heart disease. Receiving endorsements from several celebrities, including William Shatner, Chris Evert, and Gary Carter, the company experienced rapid growth in January 1986. It had a team of 140,000 distributors, with new distributors signing on at a rate of over 10,000 per month. The company was earning US$8 million, and company executives were projecting sales over $100 million in 1986 along with the astounding prediction of US$1 billion by 1989. Prospective distributors were issued a videotape narrated by Star Trek star William Shatner, with an elaborate sales pitch that both promoted the product, and implied that the modern world with its modern technology had \\"a deadly price tag\\" such as toxic chemicals and nuclear waste. The tape promoted USA chairman Robert Adler as a visionary out to change the world. Another tape was targeted towards athletes, and was narrated by Chris Evert, with other athletes such as Bill Rodgers and Gary Carter stating that USA could help distributors to achieve financial security. USA had a 16-member executive advisory board including notable scientists such as Michael DeBakey and Dr. Alexander Leaf, but these members were paid consulting fees ranging from $5,000 to $20,000, and/or received research grants from the company which could be worth $50,000 to $100,000. Fraud In October 1986, USA was the subject of an expos√© produced by the NBC network, which revealed the company's use of fraudulent scientific claims and deceptive advertising. In November, the company failed to mail some of its commissions, and by December, the company's checks to distributors were bouncing. The FDA subsequently investigated USA for pyramid-scheming, the use of false and misleading promotional materials, and for making prohibited disease treatment claims. On January 28, 1987 attorneys general in California, New York and Texas simultaneously filed lawsuits ordering USA to change its marketing plan and sales claims. Several of the board's advisory members immediately resigned, including Leaf and DeBakey. A few others said that they were \\"misquoted or improperly used in USA's sales materials.\\" Leaf told Money magazine, \\"They used my name with false statements to advertise the products.\\" In February 1987, company executives told the FDA that they were going to make labeling changes and bring everything into compliance, but in April USA filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation and ceased operation. USA's deceptive sales and marketing tactics were reviewed in several articles published in 1986-1987. See also * John A.

Although versatile and eclectic in his works, he specialised in portraiture, and his services were extensively used by the Royal Family. Career Theed was born in Trentham, Staffordshire. Initially trained by his father, Theed the younger worked for several years in the studio of EH Baily the sculptor, and on 15 January 1820 was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools. In 1826 he went to Rome. In Rome, Theed is believed to have studied under Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen and Italian Pietro Tenerani, as well as John Gibson and Richard James Wyatt. Here he worked in marble creating statues and busts, including those for the Duke of Lucca and the Prince and Princess of Capua. In 1844-5, after nearly 20 years in Rome, he received a commission from Prince Albert, then the prince consort, who had asked John Gibson (now a close friend of Theed) to send designs for statues to be placed in Osborne House. Two designs by Theed were accepted, Narcissus at the Fountain and Psyche Lamenting the Loss of Cupid both in marble. Sir Isaac Newton by William Theed, 1858, bronze; St Peter's Hill, Grantham Sir Isaac Newton by William Theed; detail. The sculptor's signature appears on the statue base at the left along with the date. Theed returned to London in 1848 and soon established a highly successful professional practice. He is known to have married, assumed to be around this time, a woman called Mary and had a son Edward, both listed in the 1881 census. In 1851 he displayed three pieces at the Great Exhibition, the most notable a marble of The Prodigal's Return, a life-size piece, elaborately carved. From London he made further pieces for the prince consort, including a series of mythological reliefs for the reception rooms of Buckingham Palace. Another notable piece for the Royal Family was a series of twelve bas-reliefs illustrating scenes from Tudor history, this time in bronze, which were made for the Prince's chamber in the Palace of Westminster. =Portrait sculpture= The major aspect of Theed's production, however, was portraiture, with which he received commissions for major commemorative statues. Most notably are: *Sir Isaac Newton, a bronze (1858) which is at St. Peter's Hill in Grantham (in front of Grantham Guildhall) *Henry Hallam, a marble (1862) in St Paul's Cathedral *Sir Herbert Benjamin Edwardes, a marble (1868) in Westminster Abbey *John Dalton, a bronze (1855) outside Manchester Metropolitan University For the Royal Family, he produced busts of: *Victoria Mary Louise, Duchess of Kent, in marble (1861) *Prince Albert in marble (1862) *Queen Victoria, bronze (1864) Having been appointed by Queen Victoria to take the death mask of the prince in 1861 he went on to produce several notable memorial statues including those at Balmoral Castle. Double portrait, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert He also executed a sculpture of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, of which a copy is in the National Portrait Gallery, London while the original is retained in the Royal Collection (Frogmore Mausoleum). The descriptive label beside the copy in the National Portrait Gallery reads: :\\"Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in Anglo-Saxon Dress. Apparently prompted by a suggestion of Victoria, the Crown Princess of Prussia\\" ( Victoria, Princess Royal ) \\"this sculpture is thought to symbolise the ties between the German and English peoples from Anglo-Saxon times to the marriage of the Royal couple.

The Queen.\\" On the plinth of Theed's original in the Royal Collection is a single line (without attribution) from the poem 'The Deserted Village' by Oliver Goldsmith (l.170): \\"...Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride, / And e'en his failings lean'd to Virtue's side; / But in his duty prompt at every call, / He watch'd and wept, he pray'd and felt, for all. / And, as a bird each fond endearment tries / To tempt its new-fledg'd offspring to the skies, / He tried each art, reprov'd each dull delay, / ALLURED TO BRIGHTER WORLDS, AND LED THE WAY.\\"(caps. added, as in the inscription) Martin Greenwood's biographical article mentions that this sculpture, which had been completed for the Queen, is also known as 'The Parting'. Death Theed had shown more than eighty works at the Royal Academy between 1824 and 1885, and from the 1840s had enjoyed the extensive patronage of the English royal family.

Expert elicitation is essentially a scientific consensus methodology. It is often used in the study of rare events. Expert elicitation allows for parametrization, an \\"educated guess\\", for the respective topic under study. Expert elicitation generally quantifies uncertainty. Expert elicitation tends to be multidisciplinary as well as interdisciplinary, with practically universal applicability, and is used in a broad range of fields. Prominent recent expert elicitation applications include climate change, modeling seismic hazard and damage, association of tornado damage to wind speed in developing the Enhanced Fujita scale, risk analysis for nuclear waste storage. In performing expert elicitation certain factors need to be taken into consideration. The topic must be one for which there are people who have predictive expertise. Furthermore, the objective should be to obtain an experts' carefully considered judgment based on a systematic consideration of all relevant evidence. For this reason one should take care to adopt strategies designed to help the expert being interviewed to avoid overlooking relevant evidence. Additionally, vocabulary used should face intense scrutiny; qualitative uncertainty words such as \\"likely\\" and \\"unlikely\\" are not sufficient and can lead to confusion. Such words can mean very different things to different people, or to the same people in different situations.

It was long regarded as a primitive species of leopard (genus Panthera). Recent work however has shown that Panthera pardoides and Panthera schaubi are actually the same species, and are probably not pantherine at all, but a member of Felinae related to the cougar, making them more properly classified as Puma pardoides. Classification Panthera schaubi or Viretailurus schaubi was historically often regarded as a basal member of the genus Panthera. However, recent work\\"Pumas of South Africa, cheetahs of France, jaguars of England\\", Tetrapod Zoology has shown that Viretailurus should actually be included in the genus Puma as a junior synonym of Puma pardoides. Fossils of this leopard-sized animal are around 2 million years old and were found in France. However, their classification was difficult, due to the similarities between leopards and pumas, until teeth found at the Upper Pliocene Transcaucasian site of Kvabebi were found to be similar to those of pumas.. Taxonomic history Puma pardoides was originally described in 1846 as Felis pardoides. A complete skull was described in 1954 as Panthera schaubi, but was assigned in 1965 to a new genus as Viretailurus schaubi due to distinct differences from other pantherin cats. In 2001, however, it was pointed out that the various puma-like fossils in Eurasia could all be attributed to a single species, Puma pardoides.

With Owens' return, the trio continued to perform and tour as Ray, Goodman & Brown. They released two albums in 2002 and 2003, one with new material, and the other featuring re-workings of soul songs by other male vocal groups. These albums reunited them with former All-Platinum producer George Kerr. In one of their public appearances, they teamed with Gerald Alston to perform The Manhattans' hit \\"Kiss And Say Goodbye\\". In 2003, Goodman, Brown, Owens and Winfrey sang backup vocals for Alicia Keys song \\"You Don't Know My Name\\", which was a #1 soul/R&B; song in 2003.

When she played Madison Square Garden with Missy Elliott and Beyonce, she had us with her. I gave her the name of 'Our Angel.' She is Ray, Goodman & Brown's angel.

In 2012, Harold \\"Eban\\" Brown rejoined remaining original member Billy Brown to re-record The Moments Greatest Hits - Volume 1. It was released in April 2014 on the Universal Music Group label - featuring the vocals of Harold \\"Eban\\" Brown and Billy Brown only. In 2014, Winfree was officially welcomed into the group as the replacement for Goodman, with Owens and Brown, bringing the group back to its regular trio status. In 2016 Brown suffered a stroke. Fortunately, after a short absence Brown fully recovered and continued to perform. In February 2019, Ray, Goodman & Brown performed on the Soul Train Cruise. As of 2020, Billy Brown continues to perform keeping the legacy of Ray, Goodman & Brown alive as the remaining surviving member. The Moments featuring Mark Greene Mark Greene was called back to join the renamed Ray, Goodman & Brown; however, he declined, claiming that no royalties were ever paid him. His website displays information about the original group: the founding members, and a photograph of the quartet before Robinson reorganized the act. He released a self-produced CD project entitled Love Is More Than Spoken on the FAJR label. There was also a CD release on FAJR entitled Unspoken Moments by the Moments featuring Mark Greene picturing Greene, Johnny Moore and Gross (aka Horsley) on the cover; Greene later acquired the trademark for the Moments name.

Ovoo, oboo, or obo (, Traditional Mongol: , \\"heap\\"; Chinese: ÊïñÂåÖ √°obƒÅo, lit. \\"magnificent bundle [i.e. shrine]\\") are sacred stone heaps used as altars or shrines in Mongolian folk religious practice and in the religion of other Mongolic peoples. They are usually made from rocks with wood. Ovoos are often found at the top of mountains and in high places, like mountain passes. In modern times, some of them have developed into large and elaborate structures, becoming more like temples than simple altars. They serve mainly as sites for the worship of Heaven and lesser gods led by shamans and kins' elders, but also for Buddhist ceremonies. In custom When traveling, it is custom to stop and circle an ovoo three times, moving clockwise, in order to have a safer journey. Usually, rocks are picked up from the ground and added to the pile. Also, one may leave offerings in the form of sweets, money, milk, or vodka. If one is in a hurry while traveling and does not have time to stop at an ovoo, honking of the horn while passing by the ovoo will suffice. In ceremony Ovoos in Gorkhi Terelj video Ovoos are the site for Heaven worship ceremonies that typically take place at the end of summer. Worshippers place a tree branch or stick in the ovoo and tie a blue khadag, a ceremonial silk scarf symbolic of the open sky and the sky spirit Tengger, or Tengri, to the branch. They then light a fire and make food offerings, followed by a ceremonial dance and prayers (worshippers sitting at the northwest side of the ovoo), and a feast with the food left over from the offering. During communism During Mongolia's communist period, ovoo worship was officially prohibited along with other forms of religion, but people still worshipped clandestinely.

Part of the Chilean Andes' volcanic segment, it is part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes, one of the four tracts of the Andean Volcanic Belt. This region of volcanism includes the world's two highest volcanoes Ojos del Salado and Llullaillaco. San Pedro, like other Andean volcanoes, was formed by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate. It has a neighbouring volcano, San Pablo, and is itself formed by two separate edifices usually known as the Old Cone and the Young Cone. These edifices are formed by rocks ranging from basaltic andesite over andesite to dacite and are emplaced on a basement formed by Miocene volcanic rocks. The Old Cone was active over one hundred thousand years ago and was eventually truncated by a giant landslide that removed its northwestern side. Within the landslide scar lava flows and pyroclastic flows constructed the Young Cone as well as the lateral centre La Poru√±a. This volcano was glaciated during the Pleistocene and a large Plinian eruption occurred at the beginning of the Holocene. Some eruptions reportedly occurred during historical time; presently the volcano is fumarolically active.  Geography and geomorphology  San Pedro is located in northern Chile, in the Ollag√ºe commune, El Loa Province, Antofagasta Region; the border to Bolivia is away. The whole region is remote and thinly populated; towns in the area include Ascot√°n, Cupo, Inacaliri and Paniri; and the San Pedro railway station lies southwest of the volcano. Tracks left by sulfur miners lead up to San Pedro's summit, and roads run around the volcano; passes around the northern, northwestern and western flanks of the volcano. San Pedro is part of the long Central Volcanic Zone, one of the two belts of volcanoes in Chile, which contains a total of about 44 active volcanoes plus silicic caldera and ignimbrite systems and monogenetic volcanoes. Many of these volcanoes are of Pliocene-Pleistocene age and approach heights of about above sea level at Llullaillaco and Ojos del Salado; such sizes of the volcanoes occur because the edifices rise from a relatively high basement. Volcanism in this region is relatively poorly studied and there is not much present-day activity; with the exception of L√°scar, most present-day manifestations are limited to fumarolic activity. San Pedro is one of the highest volcanoes in the world and is visible as far as away in Calama. Its height has been variously given as , or . It is a composite volcano, which forms a twin volcano with San Pablo farther east. Between the two lies the so-called \\"Central Crater\\" at an elevation of . San Pedro itself is formed from the easterly \\"Old Cone\\" whose most prominent expression is the eastern summit, and the westerly \\"Young Cone\\" which is only about lower. The \\"Young Cone\\" has two craters, the eastern of which is the younger one. Lava flows emerge from a breach in this crater and have filled an older wide older crater. Hydrothermally altered rocks and sulfur deposits are found on San Pedro's summit and were mined into the 1930s. A number of lava flows of volumes between make up part of the edifice. The upper part of the Younger Cone is covered with such lava flows, which have steep fronts and are up to thick. Downslope the lava flows are found mainly over the northwestern flank where they radiate away from San Pedro's crater. Scars at elevations of on the edifice have been the origin of mudflows; the largest is known as Estaci√≥n flow and covers much of the southern and western foot of San Pedro to distances of ; the debris apron reaches the Loa River and San Pedro River. These mudflows occurred between 110,000 ‚Äì 36,000 years ago and they filled the river bed of the Loa, while the impact on the San Pedro River was much more minor. Hot avalanche deposits or pyroclastic flows are also found on the volcano; the largest of which covers large parts of the edifice and has a total volume of approximately . These deposits contain prismatic jointed blocks and poorly sorted pumice, with their thickness ranging from a thick layer to scattered rocks. Their formation was probably due to the steep incline of San Pedro's slopes which tended to destabilize lava bodies high on the edifice, similar to regular landslides. At least one Plinian fall deposit is known from San Pedro; the size of the deposit indicates that it was as large as the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius in Italy. This Plinian eruption was accompanied by the formation of an ignimbrite that covers much of the southern, southwestern and western slopes of San Pedro and reaches thicknesses of . It has a volume of and is called the El Encanto ignimbrite. There is evidence of a large sector collapse on San Pedro, which removed the northwestern flank of the volcano and formed a large debris avalanche deposit. This avalanche deposit covers a surface area of and its front is high in the Pampa de la Avestruz. The debris flow formed by the sector collapse does not have many of the typical hummock-like hills of volcanic sector collapse deposits and instead features grooves and radial ridges. Such flank collapse occurred notably on Mount St. Helens during its eruption in 1980. A high scarp west of the eastern summit was left by the collapse of San Pedro; otherwise much of the evidence was buried by later volcanic activity. As with the mudflows, the steep slopes of San Pedro probably facilitated the onset of the sector collapse, which descended over an elevation difference of about . A parasitic vent named La Poru√±a lies on the western foot of San Pedro, its formation was probably influenced by a normal fault that runs in that area. It is a wide and high scoria cone on top of a field of lava flows which extend as far as west of San Pedro and from the cone. The cone's western side slumped and lava flows issued from the breach. In addition, a lava dome at an elevation of lies on the southwestern flank of San Pedro and also seems to be a parasitic vent. Andesite lava flows emanate from this area as well. They are the largest found on San Pedro, with volumes of and a surface area of ; they reach a distance of from the vent. San Pedro has been glaciated in the past. Evidence of such glaciation is found especially on the southern side of the Old Cone and it includes moraines at elevations of over as well as other glacially modified surfaces such as rock pavements and striated boulders. The chronology of glaciations in the Central Andes is poorly known but stratigraphic relations indicate that San Pedro was glaciated during the late Pleistocene. Some cirques on the southern flank contain evidence of past rock glaciers, but there are no glaciers presently on the mountain. The San Pedro River flows at the foot of San Pedro volcano, and joins the Loa River southwest of the volcano; Pleistocene lava flows from San Pedro created a lava dam on the San Pedro River, forming a lake which no longer exists. As reported in 1926, the slopes of San Pedro were used to cultivate llareta, a plant that was grown as a fuel source.  Geology  Beneath northern Chile, the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South America Plate. This subduction process is responsible for volcanic activity in the Western Cordillera, as well as elsewhere in the Andes. The volcanoes of Chile are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, which in Chile contains about 2000 volcanoes over a length of . In Chile, it is subdivided into two volcanic zones, the Central Volcanic Zone which also spans Peru, Bolivia and Argentina, and the Southern Volcanic Zone which spans Chile and Argentina. In addition, Colombia and Ecuador feature the Northern Volcanic Zone, while the subduction of the Antarctic Plate beneath the South America Plate at the southernmost tip of South America forms the Austral Volcanic Zone south of the Southern Volcanic Zone. There were two cycles of volcanic activity in Chile, the first during the Permian-Triassic and a second starting from the Tertiary. In the San Pedro region, this volcanic activity migrated east from its point of inception but recently has moved back westward. West of San Pedro lies the Pampa del Tamarugal and the Coastal Cordillera, neither of which show evidence of recent volcanic activity. = Regional = Volcanoes in this region of Chile often form lineaments perpendicular to the volcanic arc, with northwest-southeast and north-south lineaments commons. Other volcanoes with such trends are Carasilla-Polapi-Cerro Cebollar-Cerro Ascotan-Palpana and the Aucanquilcha complex; the youngest edifice is the westernmost one. The basement of the region is formed by various metamorphic and sedimentary rocks intruded by plutons ranging in their age from the Paleozoic to the Tertiary; one of these is the 65 million years old Cerro Colorado pluton. However, in the area of San Pedro this basement is entirely buried beneath volcanites of Miocene age, including ignimbrites, remnants of composite volcanoes and volcanic debris. At least three individual ignimbrites have been found; one of the ignimbrites, the San Pedro Ignimbrite, may have originated from a vent now covered by San Pedro volcano although the neighbouring Caracanal volcano is also a candidate source. The older composite volcano centres include Cerro Carcanal and Cerro Huiche south-southeast of San Pedro and Cerro del Diablo due north. This surface slopes down to the Loa River in the west. = Composition = Old Cone lavas range from andesite to olivine-containing basaltic andesite. Young Cone lavas include both andesite and hornblende-containing dacite. Volcanic rocks erupted during both stages of San Pedro belong to the potassium-rich calc- alkaline suite. San Pedro volcanic rocks are usually glassy with only tiny phenocrysts. Plagioclase and pyroxene are the dominant minerals, with amphibole and olivine being secondary components. The magma feeding the volcano probably formed from the mixing of magmas of distinct temperatures, as indicated by various clues indicating significant thermal disequilibrium between various components. The eruption of La Poru√±a appears to have been accompanied by a change in the magma system of the general volcano.  Climate  The region has an arid climate with infrequent precipitation. Moisture ultimately originates on the tropical Atlantic Ocean and much of it rains out as it crosses the Eastern Cordillera and the Altiplano, so that little reaches the western Cordillera, with precipitation in the San Pedro area less than . This dryness was interrupted during the late ice age between 17,000 and 11,000 years before present by a wetter period during which glaciers expanded.  Eruptive history  San Pedro formed in two stages, which are known as the Old Cone and the Young Cone. The Old Cone was formed by lava and scoria and later largely buried by glacial, mudflows and volcanic deposits of the Young Cone; it forms about 80% of the volume of the present-day San Pedro edifice. One date has been obtained on Old Cone lavas by argon-argon dating: 160,000 years ago. After activity of the Old Cone ceased, glacial and fluvial erosion dissected San Pedro until the large sector collapse occurred. The so-called \\"white airfall\\" with a volume of as well as pyroclastic flows on the western summit may have been erupted during the collapse but this is uncertain. Activity of the Young Cone began after the collapse within the scar left by the failure of the edifice. This activity involved the extrusion of four groups of lavas of both andesitic and dacitic composition as well as lava domes and one pumice flow. Apparently, the emission of each lava unit was preceded by explosive eruptions which formed pyroclastic flows. Argon-argon dating on one of these units has yielded an age of 100,000 ¬± 35,000 years ago. Surface exposure dating of the La Poru√±a parasitic vent has yielded an age of 103,000 ¬± 1,200 years before present; it was previously proposed that La Poru√±a formed in the late 19th century. The southwest dome is of comparable age to La Poru√±a, 107,000 ¬± 12 years ago. In general, dates obtained by argon- argon dating range from 168,000 to 68,000 years ago. A large eruption covered parts of the upper edifice with scoria about 15,000 years before present. The Plinian eruption was even more recent, occurring about 10,000 years ago (10,085 ¬± 45 radiocarbon years ago). After this event four small lava domes formed in the summit region, and partly underwent collapse forming hot avalanche deposits; it is possible that the 1901 eruption was one of these lava dome forming events. = Historical activity = Eruptions at San Pedro are reported from possibly 1885, when a newspaper from Valparaiso reported \\"strong shaking of the earth\\", the emission of large quantities of white steam, and damage to the railway, houses and water pipes. Other eruptions reported from San Pedro were in 1901 when an eruption caused damage, May‚ÄìAugust 1910, 1911, February 1938 and a minor event in December 1960. Additional eruptions are mentioned in records and dated to 1870, 1916, 1917, 1923. All these eruptions are uncertain and apparently of phreatic nature, and no geological evidence of them has been found. The timing of eruptions at San Pedro sometimes is unclear; one eruption reported from 1877 may instead have occurred in 1891 as there are two reports of an eruption before 1910 and they may either refer to one eruption with two candidate dates or two eruptions. This volcanic activity makes San Pedro one of the highest active volcanoes. Presently, fumaroles in the eastern summit crater are the only ongoing activity at San Pedro; a steam plume is barely visible. The fumarole has formed sulfur deposits. Based on measurements made in December 2013, the output of San Pedro is about . Fumaroles were also reported from the Ojos de San Pedro area south of San Pedro volcano, and a report published in 1894 mentions a smell of sulfur at La Poru√±a. In addition, seismic activity has been observed at the volcano. The history of volcanic activity at San Pedro indicates two principal hazards from future eruptions. The first is the formation of long debris avalanches or pyroclastic flows that could reach the which is just away from the volcano. The second hazard is formed by a large explosive eruption resulting in ash fall and the emplacement of ignimbrites; the whole region could be affected if the eruption column is over high. A few seismic stations monitor earthquake activity at San Pedro. The Chilean SERNAGEOMIN publishes a volcano hazard level for the volcano.  Climbing  San Pedro is climbed relatively frequently due to its proximity to the tourist town of San Pedro de Atacama. The easiest route is by the north slopes to the col then by the east slope to the summit.

Definition  According to King's American Dispensatory (1898), glycerite is: > Glycerita.‚ÄîGlycerites. By this class of preparations is generally understood > solutions of medicinal substances in glycerin, although in certain instances > the various Pharmacopoeias deviate to an extent. The term Glycerita as here > applied to fluid glycerines, or solutions of agents in glycerin, is > preferable to the ordinary names, \\"glyceroles,\\" \\"glycerates,\\" or > \\"glycemates,\\" etc., and includes all fluid preparations of the kind referred > to, whether for internal administration or local application. Glycerites may consist of either vegetable source glycerin, animal source glycerin or a combination of the two. In the case of liquid herbal products (a segment of the dietary supplements industry), the general rule is to utilize vegetable glycerin only, while nutraceuticals (another segment of the dietary supplements industry) might use a combination of both vegetable and animal source derived glycerin. Alcohol-free (as opposed to alcohol-removed) glycerite products, in which alcohol is never used or added at any time, are preferred by those desiring or requiring that no alcohol be used in making products or added thereafter. The reasons are typically for personal or religious beliefs. Muslims for instance, represent the largest population requiring an alcohol-free standard. Halal, the Islamic dietary law, lists alcohol as one of the 'explicitly forbidden substances' (called Haram) in which anything made with and/or at any time containing alcohol is forbidden. USP grade vegetable glycerin is acceptable for Halal certifying and in some instances a Halal standard may (but not always) accept Kosher certified USP Grade vegetable glycerin as meeting Halal standards (i.e. to be Halal 'compliant'). Where the issue of Halal Alcohol-Free versus Haram Alcohol- Removed glycerites is concerned, even though U.S. FDA Title 21 rules forbid referring to or labeling a product as being 'Alcohol-Free' that has at any time come into contact with alcohol, the Islamic community has taken the stance that products listed as alcohol-free often does not always mean \\"Alcohol-Free\\" as defined by Halal standards or U.S. FDA Title 21 rules, since many products listed as alcohol-free may in fact have been made using alcohol as an ingredient after which the alcohol is removed, which would still make any such products Haram by Islamic Dietary Law and in breach of U.S. FDA Title 21 labeling rules. The Islamic community is therefore encouraged to first ascertain whether a botanical glycerite is actually Halal 'Alcohol-Free' (e.g. Halal Certified or Halal compliant) or is Haram 'Alcohol-Removed' with glycerin thereafter added.

While serving on the House Agriculture Committee, a major issue of the era was a sudden and swift decline in the United States cattle market. In 1973, he was made a delegate to the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. One of Mayne's Congressional aides was future actor and congressman Fred Grandy.Fred Grandy's Washington Post biography As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, Mayne played an influential role in amendments to the Federal Rules of Evidence, especially those involving the admissibility of opinion testimony. His political downfall, however, came in his fourth term during his service on that Committee, when Mayne was one of ten Republican Committee members to vote against Articles of impeachment of President Richard Nixon arising from the Watergate scandal. At the time of his Committee votes, Mayne believed that the proof was not sufficient to necessitate a call for impeachment. In Nixon's final days in office, however, Mayne's opinion quickly changed after evidence implicating Nixon in a subsequent coverup was made public, and he vowed to vote in favor of impeachment when the articles came before the full House. The damage, however, had been done, and Mayne narrowly lost the 1974 election to his 1972 opponent, Democrat Berkley Bedell.King: Mayne Left 'Sterling Legacy' Of Service  Later life  After leaving Congress, Mayne returned to Sioux City, Iowa to resume his law practice. His wife, Betty, died in 2001, and Mayne continued to practice law until 2005. Mayne died in May 2007 after suffering a cardiopulmonary incident.

In heat exchanger analysis, if the fluid inlet and outlet temperatures are specified or can be determined by simple energy balance, the LMTD method can be used; but when these temperatures are not available The NTU or The Effectiveness method is used. The effectiveness-NTU method is very useful for all the flow arrangements (besides parallel flow and counterflow ones) because the effectiveness of all other types must be obtained by a numerical solution of the partial differential equations and there is no analytical equation for LMTD or effectiveness, but as a function of two variables the effectiveness for each type can be presented in a single diagram. To define the effectiveness of a heat exchanger we need to find the maximum possible heat transfer that can be hypothetically achieved in a counter-flow heat exchanger of infinite length. Therefore one fluid will experience the maximum possible temperature difference, which is the difference of \\\\ T_{h,i}- \\\\ T_{c,i} (The temperature difference between the inlet temperature of the hot stream and the inlet temperature of the cold stream). The method proceeds by calculating the heat capacity rates (i.e. mass flow rate multiplied by specific heat) \\\\ C_h and \\\\ C_c for the hot and cold fluids respectively, and denoting the smaller one as \\\\ C_\\\\mathrm{min}: : \\\\ C_\\\\mathrm{min}=\\\\mathrm{min}[ \\\\dot m_c c_{p,c}, \\\\dot m_h c_{p,h}] A quantity: :q_\\\\mathrm{max}\\\\ = C_\\\\mathrm{min} (T_{h,i}-T_{c,i}) is then found, where \\\\ q_\\\\mathrm{max} is the maximum heat that could be transferred between the fluids per unit time. \\\\ C_\\\\mathrm{min} must be used as it is the fluid with the lowest heat capacity rate that would, in this hypothetical infinite length exchanger, actually undergo the maximum possible temperature change. The other fluid would change temperature more slowly along the heat exchanger length. The method, at this point, is concerned only with the fluid undergoing the maximum temperature change. The effectiveness (\\\\epsilon), is the ratio between the actual heat transfer rate and the maximum possible heat transfer rate: :\\\\epsilon \\\\ = \\\\frac{q}{q_\\\\mathrm{max}} where: :q \\\\ = C_h (T_{h,i} -T_{h,o})\\\\ = C_c (T_{c,o} - T_{c,i}) Effectiveness is a dimensionless quantity between 0 and 1. If we know \\\\epsilon for a particular heat exchanger, and we know the inlet conditions of the two flow streams we can calculate the amount of heat being transferred between the fluids by: :q \\\\ = \\\\epsilon C_\\\\mathrm{min} (T_{h,i} -T_{c,i}) For any heat exchanger it can be shown that: :\\\\ \\\\epsilon = f ( NTU,\\\\frac{C_\\\\mathrm{min}} {C_\\\\mathrm{max}}) For a given geometry, \\\\epsilon can be calculated using correlations in terms of the \\"heat capacity ratio\\" :C_r \\\\ = \\\\frac{C_\\\\mathrm{min}}{C_\\\\mathrm{max}} and the number of transfer units, \\\\ NTU :NTU \\\\ = \\\\frac{U A}{C_\\\\mathrm{min}} :where \\\\ U is the overall heat transfer coefficient and \\\\ A is the heat transfer area. For example, the effectiveness of a parallel flow heat exchanger is calculated with: : \\\\epsilon \\\\ = \\\\frac {1 - \\\\exp[-NTU(1 + C_{r})]}{1 + C_{r}} Or the effectiveness of a counter-current flow heat exchanger is calculated with: : \\\\epsilon \\\\ = \\\\frac {1 - \\\\exp[-NTU(1 - C_{r})]}{1 - C_{r}\\\\exp[-NTU(1 - C_{r})]} For counter-current flow heat exchanger with C_r \\\\ = 1 : : \\\\epsilon\\\\ = \\\\frac{NTU}{1+NTU} The effectiveness-NTU relationships for crossflow heat exchangers and various types of shell and tube heat exchangers can be derived only numerically by solving a set of partial differential equations. So, there is no analytical formula for their effectiveness, but just a table of numbers or a diagram. These relationships are differentiated from one another depending (in shell and tube exchangers) on the type of the overall flow scheme (counter-current, concurrent, or cross flow, and the number of passes) and (for the crossflow type) whether any or both flow streams are mixed or unmixed perpendicular to their flow directions. Note that the C_r \\\\ = 0 is a special case in which phase change condensation or evaporation is occurring in the heat exchanger. Hence in this special case the heat exchanger behavior is independent of the flow arrangement. Therefore the effectiveness is given by: : \\\\epsilon \\\\ = 1 - \\\\exp[-NTU]  References  * F. P.

Struck with the realization that he could create his life's ideal cello, he built three prototypes by hand in his basement, the first with fiberglass and the other two with carbon fiber. After five years of experimenting, he approached carbon fiber expert Steve Clark, head of Rhode Island's Vanguard Sailboats, partnering together to form the company \\"Luis and Clark\\" in 2000. Clark eventually lead Legu√≠a to Matt Dunham of Clear Carbon and Components, who continues to manufacture all the Luis and Clark instruments.  The instruments  The instruments are all made in the United States with high- quality 92.57% carbon-epoxy matrix. Due to their carbon fiber, they are much lighter than their wooden counterparts, immune to changes in weather, and highly resistant to damage (10x stronger than steel, 5x lighter). A cello owned by Kaaren Makas, (37 years principal cello, New Orleans Philharmonic, Emeritus principal, Louisiana Philharmonic) survived the flood waters of Hurricane Katrina, needing only new strings, bridge and soundpost, after spending two weeks under water.https://luisandclark.com/2013site/wp- content/uploads/2009/09/ACMP-winter-newsletter.pdf Each one is set up carefully by hand with the highest quality bridges that are hand-carved to fit each unique instrument, and are tested thoroughly before being sent out. They are designed to be held closer to the body in order to reduce fatigue, a result of less material used in the instruments' creation. The company has stated that the instruments' sound is most important, and the durability and resistance to climate are \\"happy side-effects.\\" The instruments are 100% vegan (traditional instruments use animal glues), and do not use any endangered wood ebony in the fingerboards, nuts and saddles. Luis and Clark has sold over a thousand cellos, as well as hundreds of other carbon fiber stringed instruments, and has owners in 54 countries. = The Cello = The shape of the Luis and Clark cello makes it easier to play. It is played closer to the body so the bow arm does not have to be so high at the point of the A string, thus reducing one of the causes of the ‚Äúsore shoulder syndrome.‚Äù There is no sharp edge from the cello neck rubbing against the musician‚Äôs chest, making this cello more comfortable to play. = The Violin = Weighing less than a pound, the violin brings together the best of the violins Legu√≠a most admired in his 60 years as a professional musician. He was most influenced by Joseph Guarnerius del Ges√π, but the Luis and Clark violin also has characteristics from Amati, Montagnana, Stradivarius, J.B. Guadagnini and the rest of the Guarneri family. = The Viola = Weighing only 1 pound 4 ounces, much kinder to the body than traditional violas. It is 11/32 of an inch narrower on the A string shoulder, making it easier to play in the upper positions. The viola has an amazingly beautiful, dark, yet vibrant resonance. It sings out effortlessly and powerfully. The lower registers are rich, the upper register has luxurious warmth and there is an evenness of sound across the strings. The overall tone is one of depth, power, beauty and resonance that has to be heard to be believed. = The Bass = The bass is a ¬æ bass and weighs about 19 pounds. The string length is 41¬Ω inches. It has a swell back and is composed of a one piece back, sides and neck; the second piece is the top and the third is the fingerboard. It is a ‚Äúfree adaptation‚Äù of the bass Louie thinks is the best in the Boston Symphony, an Antonio Roca bass. It is a bit asymmetrical in the upper bout, making it easier to play. It has Rubner nickel tyrolean style tuners. The bass has a robust sound and can go from zero degrees into a hot dry room or to a hot humid country and not lose its sound, not crack nor have its neck come loose.

The system also goes by the name X-ray Nova Muscae 1991 or GU Muscae. These two orbiting X-ray telescopes discovered the system when the system produced an outburst of X-rays on January 9, 1991. Black hole system It is one of several likely black hole systems that are classified as X-ray novae. Such a nova periodically produces bright outbursts of X-rays, along with visible light and other forms of energy. In such a system, a black hole pulls gas from the surface of a companion star. The gas forms a thin disk around the black hole, known as an accretion disk. In an X-ray nova, the flow of gas is fairly thin and slow, so the accretion disk remains relatively cool, and little gas falls into the black hole. In the case of GU Muscae, the black hole is about seven times as massive as the Sun, while the companion is three-quarters as massive as the Sun. The companion is also cooler than the Sun, so its surface is redder, and the star's total luminosity is only one-third that of the Sun's. Its outer layers probably were blown away by the supernova explosion that gave birth to the black hole. The two stars orbit each other every 10.4 hours at a distance of roughly 2 million miles (3.2 million km). Spectral radiance During the January 20‚Äì21, 1991, outburst which led to its discovery, radiation was produced by positron annihilation. The SIGMA telescope aboard GRANAT detected a relatively narrow variable emission line near 500 keV in the spectrum. From January 9-August 14, 1991, the spectrum had a strong hard component extending up to ‚àº300 keV.

It lives in association with an alpheid shrimp and is found from the Red Sea through the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific Ocean. Description Steinitz' goby grows to a maximum length of . It has protuberant eyes and a long narrow body. Its colouring is white with about five broad, transverse, reddish-brown bands with some fine pale yellow lines between them. The dorsal fin has a speckling of small orange spots and has seven spines and twelve soft rays while the anal fin has a single spine and also twelve soft rays. Distribution and habitat Steinitz' goby is found in shallow parts of the Red Sea and adjoining western Indian Ocean, the Chagos Archipelago and Mauritius, the Marshall Islands, the Seychelles, southern Japan and the Great Barrier Reef. It is usually found on sandy bottoms on reef flats, outer lagoons, estuaries and bays at depths down to . Biology Steinitz' goby shares a large burrow system with alpheid shrimp such as Alpheus purpurilenticularis or Alpheus djeddensis. The goby does not take part in the burrowing and the shrimp does all the excavation in a sandy or silty area of the seabed. The burrow has one or more openings, the positions of which are altered as the shrimp engages in its burrowing activities. A new entrance may be opened after the goby pokes its head through the substrate from inside. Entrances can be moved by as much as in a day with the location of the main part of the burrow remaining unchanged. The entrance may be reinforced by shell and coral fragments particularly before nightfall but still may collapse during the night, a time during which both partners remain inside the burrow. In the morning the shrimp is often seen bringing out sediment and depositing it nearby whereas in the evening, sediment is taken into the burrow, perhaps to allow feeding to take place during the night. During the day the goby rests on the burrow floor, half out of the opening, or may make forays further afield to feed. It eats small invertebrates that it picks out of the sediment that has been disturbed by the shrimp or takes mouthfuls of sediment and extracts any edible matter. The shrimp is mainly a detritus feeder and is constantly stirring up the substrate. The shrimp cannot see well and extends its antennae behind the goby which uses a flick of its tail to alert the shrimp to approaching fish whereupon the shrimp rapidly retreats. The goby distinguishes between predators, bottom-stirring fish that may damage the burrow and harmless species and reacts appropriately. When the goby takes fright and swims into the burrow head first, the shrimp darts in immediately. Steinitz' goby is territorial. If a neighbouring goby is aggressive, the burrow entrance can be moved further away from the adjacent territory. When the breeding season arrives, the entrance can be moved closer to another burrow occupied by a fish of the opposite sex. The shrimp also forms a pair bond with a shrimp in an adjoining burrow, a bond that can remain stable for many months.

The book was compiled during the Northern Song dynasty by Zeng Gongliang (ÊõæÂÖ¨‰∫Æ), Ding Du (‰∏ÅÂ∫¶) and Yang Weide (Ê•äÊÉüÂæ∑), whose writing influenced many later Chinese military writers. The compendium was published under the auspices of Emperor Renzong of Song, who also authored the book's preface. The book covers a wide range of subjects, including everything from naval warships to different types of catapults. It contains the earliest known written chemical formulas for gunpowder, made from saltpeter, sulphur and charcoal along with many added ingredients. In addition to formulas for gunpowder, the compendium also contains details on various other gunpowder weapons such as fire arrows, incendiary bombs and projectiles, and grenades and smoke bombs. It also describes an early form of the compass (using thermoremanence), and has the oldest illustration of a Chinese Greek fire flamethrower with a double-action dual-piston cylinder-pump capable of shooting a continuous blast of flame. History Emperor Renzong The Wujing Zongyao was compiled under the sponsorship of Emperor Renzong of Song (r. 1022‚Äì1063 AD),, who was concerned that many officials were unfamiliar with the military classics, and partially as a response to the Song dynasty's war with the Tanguts of Western Xia. A team of scholars worked from 1040 to 1044 to compile the Wujing Zongyao with the intent to collect all known military knowledge and to disseminate it to a wider government audience. Its chief editor, Zeng Gongliang, was assisted by the astronomer Yang Weide and the scholar Ding Du. After five years, the book was published with a preface authored by Emperor Renzong himself. Lorge remarks that Zeng Gongliang, the chief editor, was a government official rather than a military general, implying that the Wujing Zongyao was likely written for other government officials. Parts of the Wujing Zongyao were copied from older sources; historian Ralph D. Sawyer calls it \\"essentially a cut-and-paste job\\", containing many passages from earlier classical military writings whose original authors are left unidentified, a common practice at the time. During the Song dynasty, the Wujing Zongyao was appended to two other books: the Xingjun xuzhi and the Baizhan qifa, both written by anonymous authors. The Wujing Zongyao was one of 347 military treatises listed in the biographical chapters of the History of Song (1345 AD), one of the Twenty-Four Histories. Of these 347 different military treatises from the Song period, only the Wujing Zongyao, the Huqianjing (Tiger Seal Manual) of Xu Dong in 1004 AD, and fragments of similar works found in the later Yonglo Datian, have survived. The original text of the Wujing Zongyao was kept in the Imperial Library while a number of hand-written copies were distributed elsewhere, including a copy given to Wang Shao by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1069 AD. The original copy of the Wujing Zongyao was lost during the Jin‚ÄìSong wars when the invading Jurchens sacked the Northern Song capital of Kaifeng in 1126 AD. Only a few manuscripts survived as a result of its secretive nature. Very few trustees of the government were ever allowed to read it as increased propagation would have increased the chance of it falling into enemy hands. A remaining copy of the Wujing Zongyao was remade into a newly published edition in 1231 AD in the Southern Song dynasty. During the Ming Dynasty (1368‚Äì1644 AD), another book was published in 1439 AD featuring fragments of the Wujing Zongyao of 1231 while omitting some material and combining it with two other books, including a preface by Li Jin. The entire Wujing Zongyao was reprinted in 1510 AD and this version is currently the oldest extant copy available. However, the historian Joseph Needham asserts that the 1510 AD edition is the most reliable in its faithfulness to the original version, since it was printed from blocks that were re-carved directly from tracings of the edition made in 1231 AD, rather than recombining fragments of the original with other material. After the Wujing Zongyao of 1510 was printed, other Ming copies were made. This included the Jiajing edition (1522‚Äì1566 AD), the Wanli edition (1573‚Äì1619 AD) of Quanzhou, and the Wanli edition (1573‚Äì1619) of Jinling by Tang Xiny√ºn (preserved by Cunjingge). During the Qing Dynasty (1644‚Äì1911 AD) it was also reprinted in two different editions during the 18th century, and again in 1934 with the Shanghai edition. The Xu Wujing Zongyao (Á∫åÊ≠¶Á∂ìÁ∏ΩË¶Å; literally \\"Continuation of Wujing Zongyao\\") is a \\"continuation\\" of the Wujing Zongyao written in the late Ming dynasty. The book focuses primarily on army formations and military deployments. It was written by Fan Jingwen (1587‚Äì1644), who was then the Vice President of the Board of War (ÂÖµÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏; bingbu shangshu). Fan wrote the book because he felt that reprints of the Wujing Zongyao circulating at that time were out of date and did not take into account the technological and strategic changes that had occurred since the Song dynasty. The only surviving copy of the Xu Wujing Zongyao is held by Fudan University Library. Compass and navigation Model of a Chinese compass from the Hong Kong Space Museum In the 3rd century, the Chinese engineer Ma Jun invented the south-pointing chariot. This was a wheeled vehicle that employed differential gearing in order to lock a figurine of an immortal in place on the end of a long wooden staff, the figure having its arm stretched out and always pointing to the southern cardinal direction. Although the authors of the Wujing Zongyao were mistaken in believing that the design of the south-pointing chariot was not handed down (as it was reinvented during the Song period and combined with an odometer), they described a new device which allowed one to navigate. This was the 'south pointing fish' (a thermoremanence compass), essentially a heated iron (or preferably steel) object cut in the shape of a fish and suspended in a bowl of water. The Wujing Zongyao part 1 volume 15 text stated: Later on in the Song dynasty the compass was used with maritime navigation. Several decades after the Wujing Zongyao was written, the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031‚Äì1095 AD) wrote of the first truly magnetized compass needle in his book Dream Pool Essays (1088 AD). With a more efficient compass magnetized by lodestone, the thermoremanence compass fell out of use. The later maritime author Zhu Yu wrote of the magnetic needle compass as a means to navigate at sea in his Pingzhou Table Talks of 1119 AD. Naval technology The Wujing Zongyao's illustrated descriptions of warships had a significant influence on later naval handbooks and encyclopedias such as the naval section of the Wubei Zhi from circa 1628. These works would incorporate illustrations of ships originally from the Wujing Zongyao. The use of pictures from the Wujing Zongyao would continue to appear in Japanese naval texts up until the 18th century. The illustrations were used by both Nishikawa Joken's Ka-i Ts≈´sh≈ç-k≈ç (Studies on the Intercourse and Trade with Chinese and Barbarians) in 1708 and Kanazawa Kanemitsu's Wakan Seny≈çsh≈´ (Collected Studies on the Ships used by the Chinese and Japanese) in 1766. The Wujing Zongyao divides Chinese warships into six categories: Tower ships (lou chuan), combat or war junks (dou xian or zhan xian), covered swoopers (meng chong), flying barques (zou ge), patrol boats (you ting), and sea hawk ships (hai hu). The Wujing Zongyao's typology for classifying Chinese warships would reappear in later naval texts for many centuries.

An illustration of a 'thunderclap bomb' (pi li huo qiu) as depicted in the 1044 text Wujing Zongyao. The top item is a through awl and the bottom one is a hook awl, used to ignite the projectile before it was hurled. =Gunpowder weapons= The Wujing Zongyao records detailed descriptions of gunpowder weapons such as incendiary projectiles, smoke bombs, fire arrows, and grenades. It documents incendiary projectiles containing low- nitrate gunpowder, which were launched from catapults or lowered down from city walls onto besiegers. Examples of these incendiaries include the \\"swallow-tail\\" incendiary (; yanweiju) and the flying incendiary (; feiju). The swallow-tail incendiary was made of straw tied together and dipped in fat or oil. Chinese soldiers defending a city under siege would light the incendiary and lower it onto any wooden structure of the invading army to engulf it in fire. The flying incendiary visually resembled the swallow-tail incendiary, but was lowered using an iron chain from a swape lever installed within the walls of the city. The book also describes an 'igniter ball' used in warfare and for finding the firing range. The Wujing Zongyao stated the following: Gunpowder was attached to fire arrows () and utilized as an incendiary. The Wujing Zongyao records that fire arrows were launched from bows or crossbows. The gunpowder used for fire arrows was likely a low-nitrate powder, and the quantity of gunpowder varied according to the type of bow. In the book, the force of gunpowder is said to be enough to launch an arrow, but only when the elasticity of the crossbow is sufficient. The Wujing Zongyao discusses various types of incendiary bombs and grenades. They used a low- nitrate gunpowder that, while not powerful enough to cause an explosion, was effective for incendiary weapons. The huoqiu (; literally \\"fire ball\\") was filled with gunpowder and launched using a trebuchet. Upon impact, the huoqiu would start a fire among an invading army. Chinese bombs such as the thunder clap bomb or pili pao used a greater percentage of gunpowder than that of the huoqiu. The gunpowder mixture for a bomb was placed within a rigid container that held in the expanding gas, allowing for more powerful explosions. The thunder clap bomb was constructed with a container made from bamboo. In the Wujing Zongyao and other military texts, the distinction between a bomb and a grenade is ambiguous. At the time, the Chinese usually did not categorize gunpowder weapons according to their delivery method. One of the few exceptions is the shoupao, or hand bomb, which is analogous to the hand grenade. =Formulas= Gunpowder had already been invented prior to the Wujing Zongyao by Chinese alchemists in the 9th century. Early references to gunpowder can be found in the Daoist book Zhenyuan miaodao yaolue, written circa 850, and gunpowder was utilized in Chinese warfare as early as the 10th century in fire arrows and gunpowder fuses used to light the Chinese two- piston flamethrower. However it was not until the Wujing Zongyao that the exact chemical formulas for early Chinese gunpowder was revealed. The Wujing Zongyao contains three formulas for gunpowder: one for an explosive bomb launched from a trebuchet, another for a similar bomb with hooks attached so that it could latch on to any wooden structure and set it on fire, and another formula specified for a poison-smoke bomb used for chemical warfare. The Wujing Zongyao's first recorded gunpowder formula used in these bombs held a potassium nitrate level of 55.4% to 55.5%, sulfur content of 19.4% to 26.5%, and carbonaceous content of 23% to 25.2%. The first step for making gunpowder is to powder and mix together sulphur, saltpetre, charcoal, pitch, and dried lacquer. Tung oil, dried plants, and wax are mixed next to create a paste. The paste and powder are combined and carefully stirred. Then the mixture is placed inside a paper container, wrapped up, and tied using hemp twine. Several precautions are taken to prevent the gunpowder from becoming damp. For the second formula, the inner ball alone had a nitrate percentage of 61.5% to 50.2%, a sulfur content of 30.8% to 25.1%, and if all carbonaceous matter was taken, 24.7%, if just taking the charcoal content alone, the carbon level was 7.7%. If the outer coating and inner ball are both included with the second black-powder formula, that would yield a nitrate level of 34.7% to 54.8%, a sulfur content of 17.4% to 27.4%, and if all carbonaceous material is used, 47.9% carbon, if only charcoal is used, 17.8%. If the inner ball of the third black-powder formula is only considered, it held nitrate levels of 39.6% if all carbonaceous matter was taken, 49.4% nitrate if excluding the poisons, and 60% if charcoal is specified alone. The sulfur content was 19.8% if all carbonaceous matter was considered, 24.7% if this excluded poisons, and 30% if charcoal is specified alone. The carbon content was 40.5% if all carbonaceous matter was considered, 25.9% if this excluded poisons, and 10% if charcoal alone was specified. If both the inner ball and outer coating are considered for the third formula, that would yield a nitrate level of 27% if all carbonaceous matter was taken, 31.2% if this excluded poisons, and 51.7% if charcoal alone was used. The sulfur content would be 13.5% if all carbonaceous matter was taken, 15.6% if this excluded the poisons, and 25.9% if only charcoal alone was specified. The carbon content was 59.5% if all carbonaceous matter was taken into account, 53.2% if this excluded poisons, and 22.4% if charcoal alone was specified.

Double-acting piston flamethrower A Chinese flamethrower from the Wujing Zongyao The Wujing Zongyao describes a flamethrower with a double-acting two- piston cylinder-pump capable of shooting a continuous blast of flame. The first Chinese battle to use the double-piston pump flamethrower was the Battle of Langshan Jiang in 919 AD. In the Battle of Langshan Jiang (Wolf Mountain River, ÁãºÂ±±Ê±ü), the naval fleet of the Wenmu King of Wuyue defeated the fleet of the Kingdom of Wu because he had used 'fire oil' (huo y√≥u, ÁÅ´Ê≤π) to burn his fleet; this signified the first Chinese use of gunpowder in warfare, since a slow-burning match fuse was required to ignite the flames. Greek fire is likely based on distilled petroleum and is a weapon of Byzantine origin. The Chinese author Lin Yu explained in his book of 919 AD that Greek fire was acquired from their Arab maritime trade contacts in the Indian Ocean.

Hardy was a left-handed batsman who sometimes opened the innings and a right-arm medium-pace bowler. He played for Surrey's colts team, but left to join Somerset. He made his debut in 1902 and in his second match took the slip catch that dismissed Victor Trumper for just five - Trumper was dismissed a second time for five by the same bowler, George Gill, later in the match. Hardy played as a professional in a mainly amateur team, and made fairly regular appearances for Somerset right through to 1914. In 1910, when the side lost 15 out of 18 County Championship matches and failed to secure a single point all season, he headed the Somerset batting figures with 700 runs, including his own highest score of 91 against the champions, Kent, at Taunton. His best bowling figures, six for 82, also came in that season, against Middlesex at Bath. Hardy's death is something of a mystery. He was, in the words of Wisden's 1917 edition, \\"found dead on the floor of a lavatory at King's Cross station (G.N.R.)... His throat was cut and a blood-stained knife was by his side.\\" Hardy was serving with the City of London Yeomanry at the time. The historian David Foot wrote that the knife was Hardy's own and that the death was suicide brought on by distress at being sent back to the World War I battlefield.

History The first Christian service of any type in Hawaii was a lay funeral service conducted by Captain James Cook for an English sailor at Kealakekua Bay on the Big Island of Hawaii in 1779. The first Christian liturgical service held in Hawaii was a Russian Orthodox celebration of Pascha (Œ†Œ¨œÉœáŒ±, Easter in Greek). Sometime between 1750 and 1793, while traveling from the Far East to what was then Russian America, a Russian trading ship stopped over in the Hawaiian Islands. The Russian Orthodox priest, not wanting to celebrate Pascha at sea, instructed the captain to disembark. The captain told the priest he feared the \\"natives\\" but the priest responded, \\"They will not harm us, for we are Orthodox, and we bear the Light of Christ to illumine their hearts.\\" They disembarked and blessed a temporary altar under a newly built temple made out of palms and bamboo and adorned with an Our Lady of the Sign icon of the Theotokos (Mother of God) and the Christ Child. It was rumored that as they departed the priest left the icon used in the Paschal Divine Liturgy. The ship's priest promised that, \\"We shall return and baptize these natives to the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.\\" Russian Fort Elizabeth as it was in 1815 on the Island of Kauai = First chapels = In 1815, Russians built Hawaii's first Orthodox church: the Russian Orthodox chapel at Fort Elizabeth, coordinates . On the island of Kaua ªi, three Russian forts were built: Fort Alexander, Fort Barclay, and Fort Elizabeth. Fort Alexander also housed a small Orthodox chapel, but Fort Elizabeth was the trading base for the new Russian-American Company in Hawaii. When King Kaumuali ªi of Kaua ªi ceded his kingdom to King Kamehameha I in 1816 following the Tsar Alexander I's refusal to annex Kaua ªi due to political troubles in Russia, the forts were also ceded, and the Hawaiian Islands become one unified kingdom. The chapels ultimately fell into disrepair after Calvinist missionaries from the United States landed in 1820. In November 2017, Elizabeth Fort Forum 2017 was held in Kauai to celebrate the fort's bicentennial, that included a panikhida by the priests from the Holy Theotokos of Iveron Russian Orthodox Church of Oahu and St. Juvenaly Mission of the Big Island. In 1882, the Kingdom of Hawaii sent a diplomatic delegation to St. Petersburg, Russia, to witness the coronation of Tsar Alexander III. The reports of Hawaii's special envoy to the Russian court, Colonel Curtis Pi ªehu I ªaukea, Secretary of Foreign Affairs for the Kingdom of Hawai ªi, regarding the Russian Orthodox liturgical services were widely published in Hawaiian language newspapers. Two years later, Tsar Alexander III sent King KalƒÅkaua the Imperial Order of St. Alexander Nevsky, one of the highest of Russian awards, and established a permanent Russian embassy in Hawaii, along with a very small Orthodox chapel. Subsequently, 200 Ukrainians were imported as laborers by American sugar planters. =Decline= In 1893, Queen Liliuokalani was deposed by U.S. Marines and American sugarcane plantation owners who were in large part the children of American Calvinist missionaries, and a provisional government was installed (see Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii). In 1898, Hawaii was annexed by the United States of America. In the early 20th century, the Russian ambassador was recalled, the embassy was moved to a small office, and the Russian Orthodox chapel was closed. Saint Innocent of Alaska also made a brief stop-over in Hawaii during his travels from Asia to Western America. =Rebirth= On November 27, 1910 (O.S., the Feast Day of the Znamenny-Kursk Root Icon of the Sign of the Mother of God), reader services were organized and served by Vasily Pasderin. In 1915, after the Russian Orthodox community in Hawaii (and the Episcopal Bishop Henry B. Restarick) sent an official request to the Holy Governing Synod in St. Petersburg, a priest was dispatched (with the blessing of Archbishop Evdokim (Meschersky) of the Aleutians) to pastor the large population of Orthodox Russian faithful. He established permanent liturgical services in Hawaii and on Christmas December 25 (O.S.) / January 7 (N.S.), 1916, Protopresbyter Jacob Korchinsky celebrated the Divine Liturgy at Saint Andrew's Episcopal Cathedral in Honolulu. Thus Orthodoxy was re-established in Hawaii. St. Andrew's Episcopal as it appears today in downtown Honolulu Fr. Jacob, a well-known missionary priest, established churches in Canada, the United States, Alaska, Australia and the Philippines. He was murdered in Odessa shortly after the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, but has not yet been officially recognized as a martyred saint (though, for martyrs, no official canonization is necessary in the Orthodox Church). St. Tikhon of Moscow once quoted Fr. Jacob's missionary exploits this way, \\"He did much to convert the heathen to the Christian Faith and returned many Uniates to the Orthodox Church. He set the foundation for parish life in many places, built churches and assisted the unfortunate with his acquired medical knowledge.\\"Report by Bishop Tikhon Belavin to the Holy Synod. No. 155 November 26, 1906 In subsequent years, the Russian Orthodox Church sent priests by boat or airplane to Hawaii to care for the dwindling Orthodox population, becoming part of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR). Archimandrite Innokenty Dronov of Hilo, a contemporary of St. Jonah of Hankou and St. John of Shanghai and San Francisco and Metropolitan Meletius of Harbin, served the entire Orthodox Christian flock on all the Hawaiian Islands throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Fr. Innokenty had a large following of Japanese Orthodox Christians. He frequently returned to the Diocese in San Francisco to report to Archbishops Apollinary (Koshevoy) and Tikhon (Troitsky) as well as for medical reasons. He is now purportedly buried on the Big Island of Hawaii. \\"Melting Pot\\" Until the 1960s, the Russian Orthodox Church was the only Orthodox jurisdiction in the islands. Following the 1960s, parishes from three other jurisdictions established themselves in the Islands: the Greek Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church, and the OCA. At one point there were as many as five different Orthodox jurisdictions in the Hawaiian Islands. Despite this multiplicity of jurisdictions, all Eastern Orthodox churches in Hawaii are in full communion with one another and have friendly relations. (See also: Eastern Orthodoxy in North America and Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of the United States of America). =Russian Orthodox Church= In the late 1960s, a group of Russian Orthodox Christians parted ways with the local Greek community and joined the Russian Orthodox Church under the omophorion (jurisdiction) of Archbishop Anthony of Los Angeles; they formed the St. Mark of Ephesus Russian Orthodox Mission. In the early 1980s, this mission parish was later re-consecrated under the heavenly protection of the Mother of God and is now known as the Holy Theotokos of Iveron Russian Orthodox Church. Holy Theotokos of Iveron Russian Orthodox Church In the late 1990s, the pastor of the Russian Orthodox community, Father Anatole Lyovin, was ordained to serve the Orthodox faithful in Hawaii. Currently this parish is without a permanent structure, but there are new plans to build the first Russian Orthodox church on Oahu. The Holy Theotokos of Iveron Russian Orthodox Church is served by four clergy: Priest Athanasius Kone (Rector), Archpriest Anatole Lyovin, Deacon Michael Bressem, and Deacon Nectarios Yangson. This church houses the world famous ‚ÄúHawaiian‚Äú Iveron Icon of the Mother of God. A Miracleworking image of the Virgin Mary that exudes an oily and fragrant substance called ‚Äúmyrrh‚Äù. This was officially recognized by the Russian Orthodox Church as a genuine miracle in 2008. Archbishop Kyrill on an archpastoral visit to Hilo, Kona and Honolulu in 2003 =Greek Orthodox Church= In the mid 1960s, a Greek Orthodox community established a mission under the auspices of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. This community became known as the Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church. The current pastor of the Greek Orthodox community in Hawaii is Fr. Alexander Leong, who was assigned to the parish in Honolulu in 2008. This community is well known for its annual Greek Festival held at Ala Moana Beach Park near Waikiki. This community is under the care of Bishop-Metropolitan Gerasimos of San Francisco (GOARCH). In the 1990s a Greek Orthodox mission was established on the Island of Maui. For a time, this mission was served by clergy of Ss. Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church in Honolulu. They had a resident priest for a year, but this mission has been inactive for a number of years. In early 2012, the Maui mission parish has been re- established and holds monthly services on the third Saturday of the month at St. Theresa's in Kihei with Fr. Alex serving as presbyter. =Serbian Orthodox Church= In the early 1990s, a Serbian community established a Serbian Orthodox mission dedicated to St. Lazar of Kosovo. The Serbian mission later became inactive, and its remaining members joined the local Russian and Greek churches. There has been a recent interest within the Serbian Orthodox community in Hawaii to re-establish this mission. In recent months, visiting clergy (including the Serbian Bishop Maxim of Western America) have come from the mainland to minister to them. =Antiochian Orthodox Church= In 2003, the short-lived St. Paul the Apostle Antiochian Orthodox Mission was established in Honolulu at Fort Shafter Army Base. The rector of this mission was Fr. Isaiah Gillette, a chaplain with the military. Following Fr. Isaiah's transfer to Texas, the mission was disbanded. There is currently a small community under the care of a priest from the Antiochian Orthodox Church, who visits Oahu on a regular basis. =Orthodox Church in America= In early 2004, a new Orthodox community under the jurisdiction of the Orthodox Church in America (OCA) was established in Kona, on the western side of the Big Island. Fr. Sergius Naumann served this community for a time until leaving for Alaska. They were without a priest for about 18 months. In Autumn, 2007 the community was given the name of St. Juvenaly St. Juvenaly Orthodox Mission ‚Äî the first Orthodox Church to have St. Juvenaly as their patron. The mission is under the auspices of Bp. Benjamin (Peterson) of the West (OCA). On the eastern side of the Big Island, the Holy Ascension Orthodox Church was also established recently in Honomu, Hawaii. Holy Ascension Orthodox Church =St. Marks Coptic Orthodox Church= The Coptic Orthodox Church is one of the most ancient Churches in the world, founded in the first century in Egypt by Saint Mark the Apostle and writer of the second Gospel of the New Testament. A traditional Church, it has carefully preserved the Orthodox Christian faith in its earliest form, handing it down through generations and remaining true to the Apostolic doctrines and patterns of worship. The Church's spiritual approach emphasizes holiness, Divine Mysteries and fellowship, rooted firmly in the canons of the Holy Scriptures, the apostolic and Orthodox creeds, the teachings of the Church Fathers and the first three ecumenical councils. Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Church in Honolulu was established in 1986. Pope Shenouda III assigned a number of priests to serve there and visited the parish personally in 1989. Priests from the Diocese of Southern California rotated their service there, as well. Among them was Hegumen Father Bishoy Ghobreial, Father Suriel El Anba Bishoy (now Bishop Suriel), Hegumen Father Anastasi Saint Antony, Hegumen Father Angelos Youssef, Father John Botros, Father Zosima El Muharraqi, Father Raphael El Baramosi, Father Archilids El Antony, and Father Saraphim El Souriani. The parish initially held services in rental spaces within a Catholic church, an Episcopal church, and a convent. These houses of worship opened their hearts and their doors to them until the purchase of the present property with several buildings, including a church and retreat center; consecrated in 2004 by Pope Shenouda III. *Note, the Coptic Orthodox Church is not in communion with any of the other Orthodox Churches in Hawaii, as the Coptic Church is part of the group of ‚ÄúOriental Orthodox Churches‚Äù, which are not in communion with Eastern Orthodoxy or Roman Catholicism.

Peel Island (formerly known as Montague Island or the Gridiron) is one of the three islands of Coniston Water in the English Lake District, Cumbria.

It is most famous for being one of the inspirations for Arthur Ransome's Wild Cat Island. Today, it is a popular tourist destination, and belongs to the National Trust. History Peel Island Peel Island has belonged to the National Trust since it was given to them by John Montagu-Douglas-Scott, 7th Duke of Buccleuch, along with of woodland, in 1932. Wild Cat Island Peel Island is considered to be one of the origins of the fictional Wild Cat Island in the 1930 book Swallows and Amazons and its sequels, by Arthur Ransome. Taqui Altounyan, sister of Roger Altounyan and inspiration for one of the characters in Swallows and Amazons, described Peel Island in her autobiography In Aleppo Oncep.179. as \\"like a green tuffet, sitting in the water, the trees covering the rocks\\".

Though mostly independent of the Italian-American Mafia and not an official Mafia crew, the gang was originally affiliated with and worked with the Lucchese crime family and later with the Bonanno crime family and Genovese crime family. It developed its \\"closest ties\\" with the Genovese family, and its remnants or former members are now part of the Genovese family's 116th Street Crew. Origins They allegedly named their group the 'Purple Gang' as a tribute to a Prohibition Era gang (Purple Gang) that terrorized Detroit 50 years earlier. Membership in the group was restricted to Italian Americans who grew up on Pleasant Avenue between 114th and 120th Streets, just east of 1st Avenue, also known as Italian Harlem. In the late 1970s, at the peak of its strength, the Purple Gang had about 30 members according to police reports and 80 associates, with higher numbers placing the gang's membership at over 100 (though this may include associates.) By 1977, law enforcement claimed that the Purple Gang had committed at least 17 homicides, some on behalf of 'organized crime principals', though dozens of other murders in the 1970s and 1980s have since been attributed to Purple Gang members. History The Purple Gang originated in Italian Harlem as an Italian-American youth street gang and were involved in various robberies and assaults before engaging in more organized criminal activity. Many of its founding members were related, some as brothers or cousins. When they first drifted into the narcotics business, the gang originally acted only as \\"delivery boys\\" or \\"spotters\\" (i.e. lookouts) for local established Italian mafiosi involved with the drug trade. However, the Purple Gang eventually rose to power in the Harlem drug trafficking business and subsequently graduated to committing murders following the 1973 arrests and convictions of several powerful Italian-American Mafia figures who had until then been dominating heroin and narcotics distribution in East Harlem. The 1973 arrests largely involved high-ranking mafiosi involved in the so- called \\"French Connection\\" heroin smuggling ring, such as Louis Inglese and Lucchese boss Carmine Tramunti. In the wake of these arrests, the Purple Gang filled the power vacuum created within the drug trade in East Harlem, eventually dominating the heroin trade in Harlem and the South Bronx and becoming not only major independent drug distributors but also major drug distributors for New York's \\"Five Families.\\" In addition to drug trafficking and murder, the Purple Gang's other activities included kidnapping rival drug dealers for ransom, collecting loansharking debts, extortion, and labor racketeering, sometimes carrying out these activities independently and sometimes acting on behalf of one of the Five Families. Throughout the 1970s, Italian-American and African-American organized crime groups both controlled narcotics trafficking in Harlem and much of New York City, and the two ethnic crime groups often cooperated or worked closely together in the drug trade business. The Italian-American Purple Gang was especially closely connected with African-American organized crime groups in Harlem. The Purple Gang eventually began supplying heroin to infamous Harlem drug kingpin Leroy Barnes and his organized crime network. After the arrest of Leroy Barnes, who was at the time one of the top heroin dealers in Harlem, the Purple Gang began supplying heroin to his remaining network of African-American dealers in Harlem at $75,000 per kilogram. The Purple Gang became increasingly involved with murder, sometimes acting independently and sometimes as contract killers for the Mafia, and they became renowned for their \\"enormous capacity for violence.\\" By 1977, law enforcement claimed that the Purple Gang committed at least 17 homicides, with many of these murders committed on behalf of 'organized crime principals' (i.e. Italian-American Mafia families.) Many of the murders attributed to the Purple Gang were exceedingly grisly, with some involving decapitation, dismemberment, or multiple stab wounds. The gang is also suspected to be involved in a rash of killings during the 1970s of various mobsters and people with organized crime connections, with the murders notably involving .22 caliber firearms. Dismemberment and .22 caliber killings subsequently became known in the underworld as the trademark of the Purple Gang. According to police reports, at the peak of its strength in 1977 the Purple Gang consisted of approximately 30 members and over 80 associates, with higher numbers placing the gang's membership as over 100 (though this may include associates.) Most of the gang's members were younger men in their 20s or 30s, many of whom were considered by the Mafia to be too reckless or \\"uncontrollable\\" for membership in the Mafia. Though technically an independent gang that operated largely outside the constraints and structure of the established \\"Five Families\\" of the New York Italian-American Mafia, the Purple Gang was closely tied to Italian-American Mafia and would often freelance as \\"muscle\\" or hit-men for the larger New York families. Many Purple Gang members were in fact relatives of established Italian Mafia members. However, it remains unclear what activities the gang performed independently and what activities the gang carried out for certain Mafia families. For instance, several members were notably arrested in Monroe, New York in Upstate New York for assaulting private sanitation workers, suggesting the gang may have been involved in labor corruption or extortion within the sanitation business, either independently or as enforcers for the New York Mafia. Though the gang often worked for the Five Families and frequently acted as drug distributors for the Five Families, they were also noted for their \\"lack of respect for other members of organized crime,\\" and they just as often competed with the Mafia or disregarded the Mafia's turf claims and orders, sometimes moving in on Mafia drug territory. In fact, law enforcement at one point feared that a mob war would break out between the Purple Gang and certain Mafia families, specifically Carmine Galante's Bonanno Crime Family, and the gang became so powerful and feared that it was sometimes referred to as New York City's \\"Sixth Family.\\" Law enforcement speculated that during the late 1970s, the Purple Gang began developed a relationship with Nicaraguan drug dealers, trading firearms for drugs. The firearms were apparently sent to Latin American narcoterrorists through connections in Florida in exchange for smuggled drugs. The Purple Gang was also suspected of having ties to the Cuban Mafia in Florida. The Purple Gang disintegrated during the late 1970s and early 1980s and was absorbed into the current 116th Street Crew. Some members were invited to join the Mafia and became made men, including Angelo Prisco and Daniel Leo who became the acting boss of the Genovese crime family in 2005. Bonnano alleged boss Michael Mancuso was also an associate of the Purple Gang. On November 13, 2013, Michael Meldish, a reported leader of the gang, was killed in Throggs Neck, ordered by Lucchese acting boss Matthew Madonna, and carried out by Christopher Londonio and Terrence Caldwell; the three were sentenced to life in prison for the murder on July 27, 2020. Pleasant Avenue Pleasant Avenue, a six-block stretch in East Harlem is one of the incubators of the Italian Mafia in New York City. Anthony 'Fat Tony' Salerno, ran the Genovese crime family from Pleasant Avenue. Anthony Loria, Sr., a longtime partner of Vincent Papa who masterminded the \\"Who Stole The French Connection\\" corruption scandal was born and raised on Pleasant Avenue. This scheme involved corrupt NYPD and law officials that allowed the drug lords to steal an estimated 70 million dollars of narcotics from the NYPD property room at 400 Broome Street in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Synopsis In the future, Tokyo is no longer the capital of Japan, that honour returned to the ancient city of Kyoto. Although still a principle trading centre, much of the city ‚Äì especially the once- fashionable Ginza district ‚Äì has fallen into such a great morass of crime, the regular police are overwhelmed from all the extra work. As a result, many of the well-to-do citizens of the city often contract private security firms for their own protection. These firms are also deputised by the Tokyo police to aid them whenever a major situation develops. Noriko Ibuki is employed with the Tokio Private Police, one of these private security firms, and in the opening is stationed in Ginza, which is now a crime-ridden slum. Years before, she was a high school student whose first sexual encounter went wrong; her boyfriend was very rough on her, and what resulted was close to rape. As a result, she doesn't like to indulge in sex. In the face of a normal day, Noriko's tomboy-ish looks (her short pink hair and a small bustline) often get her mistaken for a man, which irritates her greatly. One night, while Noriko is in the process of foiling the rape of a female passenger of the subway by three thugs, she is aided by Shibata, the manager of the Shinjuku office of the T.P.P., and as a result, she ends up being reassigned by Shibata to Shinjuku to be part of the new mobile strike team he set up. Somewhat over- sexed, Shibata begins to foster a purely physical interest for Noriko as well (even though he has a girlfriend). But when Noriko arrives in Shinjuku, she is alarmed to find - next to the actual budget shortage in the TPP force - that some of her teammates are real oddballs. One guy, Yasuo Kawasaki, is a total mecha fanatic who has the least interest in girls ‚Äì just mecha. Isamu Oyama, a former soldier, mistakes her for a man (as usual) and even makes the suggestion that Noriko is actually a transgender... for which he gets slapped by her. And to top it all off, her partner Kayoko Kuraishi happens to be a nymphomaniac with a somewhat enlightened idea about sex. As for her superior, Keiko Yamasami also happens to be the girlfriend/lover of Shibata and is blissfully unaware about his interest in Noriko. Even though her first day goes bad, Noriko soon finds that in order to get through a day filled with budget cuts and long days, she's going to have to find some way to relieve stress. Eventually, Kayoko helps Noriko get over her sexual hang-ups in a session of lesbian love. In the end, Noriko and Yasuo discover a common ground and begin a romantic relationship. The series is in a way a mix of mecha- fights and sexual interaction between the main characters. Characters & Cast Members ; :*Voiced by: Tomoko Kawakami & Shoko Kawachi :A young tomboyish girl with tsundere tendencies. In episode 1, she gets involved with a confrontation with a group of perverted train molesters while trying to rescue a young woman who fell victim to the incident. When she was in high school, her previous boyfriend kept hurting her during sexual foreplay and realised she was being raped; because of her traumatic past, she refuses to start a sexual relationship with anybody. Because of her short pink hair and flat chest, she is often mistaken for a boy, an example of this was when a delinquent boy was picking a fight with her; not knowing of her real gender, which resulted in Noriko giving the boy a good kick in the nuts. After having sex with her partner Kayoko, she became more confident in herself, was able to move on with her life, and started a romantic and sexual relationship with Yasuo. ; :*Voiced by: Hiroshi Yanaka & Tateo Izumi :Keiko's boyfriend and the manager of the Tokyo Private Police (T.T.P.), a special organisation that supports the overburdened Tokyo police.

His first acquaintance with Noriko runs somewhat unpleasant, because he mistakenly thought she was a guy. In the series, he has romantic feelings for Kayoko. In one scene, while in the locker room, he is seduced by Kayoko, by her direct manner, with a small courtship ritual. From then on the two have sex frequently especially during working hours (which usually is un-mistakable). ; :*Voiced by: Saki Iijima :Noriko's crime partner and best friend. She is a very calm and friendly person with long orange hair, and is very wild and outgoing when it comes to sex or anything related to the subject; she is in a relationship with Isamu who she frequently has intercourse with throughout each episode. She was the one who helped Noriko overcome her fears by actually having sex with her, to show her that sex is not as bad as it seems. ; :*Voiced by: Wataru Takagi & Koichi Mizuno :A huge mecha fanatic in the TTP, even going so far as to buying magazines about mecha. He seems to suffer from an extreme disinterest in women, leading to minor arguments with Isamu.

He played in Major League Baseball from 1890 to 1902 for the Boston Beaneaters, St. Louis Browns, Baltimore Orioles (NL), Pittsburgh Pirates, Baltimore Orioles (AL) and New York Giants. Brodie set a 19th century record by playing in 727 consecutive games. In the mid-1890s, along with Willie Keeler and Joe Kelley, he was part of one of the best outfields of his era. Early life Brodie was the son of Irish immigrant Alexander Brodie, a tailor and a Shakespearean actor. In 1887, Brodie moved to Roanoke, Virginia, where he played in the semiprofessional industrial leagues. That same year, Brodie, 18, met Carrie Henry, 15, and they got married. The couple lived in Roanoke through Brodie‚Äôs baseball playing career. Baseball career Brodie took on the nickname Steve because of the daredevil of the same name, who was said to have survived a jump off of the Brooklyn Bridge. The ballplaying Brodie broke into the major leagues with the Boston Beaneaters in 1890; NL teams sought a high volume of new players that year because they had lost players who jumped to the new Players' League. In 1891, Brodie began a 727-game streak of consecutive games played, the longest such streak in the 19th century. Brodie spent several years in the outfield with the Baltimore Orioles of the 1890s. His teammates in the outfield were two future Baseball Hall of Fame members, Willie Keeler and Joe Kelley, giving the Orioles one of the best outfields in 19th century history. Between 1894 and 1896, the three outfielders were very successful at the plate; as a group during those three years, Brodie, Keeler and Kelley batted .363 and had over 300 runs batted in. On the baseball field, Brodie was known as a jokester with an eccentric personality. Teammates and fans were sometimes taken aback when he recited Shakespearean verse during games or carried on conversations with himself in the outfield. In 1438 games over 12 seasons, Brodie posted a .303 batting average (1728-for-5703) with 886 runs, 191 doubles, 89 triples, 25 home runs, 900 RBI, 289 stolen bases, 420 bases on balls, .365 on-base percentage and .381 slugging percentage. He recorded a .958 fielding percentage primarily as an outfielder but also played several games at second and third base. Later life When the Federal League emerged as a third major league, Brodie became a scout for the Baltimore Terrapins. The YMCA sent him to France to facilitate recreation programs for U.S. soldiers in World War I. He later served as an administrator at Baltimore's Municipal Stadium. Brodie died in 1935 and was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in Baltimore County.

These types of fuel are becoming increasingly popular in areas which ban the use of coal and other fuels such as unseasoned or wet wood which produce much smoke. Open fires are still popular with many domestic consumers, especially for those living in older houses where open fireplaces have not been removed or replaced by stoves for example. All houses older than about 1970 are fitted with open fireplaces when coal was in widespread use for domestic heating. However, modern houses are rarely equipped with fireplaces and central heating with natural gas or electricity is the usual choice. As a result of many places banning smoke and pollution, some studies have shown that overall air quality has improved along with fewer annual deaths related to smoke. Many consider smokeless fuel to be the near future replacement of all other solid fuels which cause toxic smoke emissions. The term in general is used to refer to solid fuels, such as: anthracite, coke, charcoal and hexamine fuel tablets. Smoke free carbonaceous fuels are usually supplied in the form of standard pillow-shaped briquettes made from powdered coal or charcoal. Fuel tablets are used by campers and walkers for temporary cooking using a small folding metal stove.  History  Smoke rising in Lochcarron, Scotland, is stopped by an overlying layer of warmer air (2006). Coal was widely used for domestic cooking and heating during the Victorian period and up to the early 1950s in most towns in Britain. However, poor coal fuels and badly designed fireplaces created a good deal of local pollution from smoke and tars produced from partial combustion of the coal and disappeared up the chimney. As a result, the smoke and noxious gases were often trapped locally when a weather inversion occurred. Such trapped gases and smoke caused fogs and worse, smogs which discoloured clothing and was a serious health hazard. Such pea soupers were generally more prevalent in the larger towns such as Manchester, Birmingham and London. There were also toxic gases such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides present in the same noxious mixture, both of which irritated the lungs of those exposed to the smog. The former gas produced by sulphur impurities in the coal, was especially iniquitous since it oxidises further in the air to produce sulphuric acid, a highly corrosive and strong acid. = London = Nelson's Column during the Great Smog of 1952 In 1952 The Great Smog of London killed directly a great number of people varying between 4 and 12 thousand people by exacerbating existing lung diseases such as bronchitis and breathing disorders like asthma. It also killed indirectly by causing many rail, road and pedestrian accidents created by the impenetrable gloom of the smog. Clothes were stained by the soot and generally discoloured by the sulphurous gases. Because of this tragedy the Clean Air Act 1956 was passed to attempt to solve this problem. One of the results of this act was the development of smokeless fuels, which were designed specifically to aid the environment by reducing the amount of smoke produced, as well as removing some impurities such as sulphur in the coal. Such manufactured fuels also burnt at a higher temperature and so made for a better and more efficient fuel for open fires as well as stoves.  Benefits  Ogatan, charcoal briquettes made from sawdust Hexamine fuel tablets Smokeless fuels can have several benefits over other solid fuels such as bituminous coal or anthracite. They are usually more expensive than coal, and often consist of briquettes of standard size (ca 3 inches long and wide by 1 inch thick) aiding transport, handling and fire-making. Coal however, may often be supplied in a large variety of sizes from fines to large lumps. Slack such as stone and shale or even coal dust can choke a fire and usually produces a great deal of smoke. The variable size of the coal results in inconsistent burning, the smaller particles burning faster than the larger. The advantages of a standard sized briquette of smokeless coal include regular burning for longer (less refueling needed) and burning at a higher temperature, so making an open fire more efficient. They can also improve air quality by reducing smoke formation They are generally of more consistent quality since are mass made by compression moulding of powdered coal and a binder such as starch. They can be used in many different appliances such as enclosed stoves as well as open fires. Smokeless coal is more efficient than a conventional open coal fire because the high working temperature is radiated into the room as infra-red radiation, as can be judged by the bright red colouration from a mature fire. The hot gases produced are still lost up the chimney, so reducing efficiency just as in an open coal fire. The gases mainly consist of carbon dioxide and a little water vapour, which is lost to the environment while carbon dioxide is essential for plant life in photosynthesis. With no or little smoke, chimneys remain cleaner for longer and require brushing less frequently since fewer volatiles or smoke are produced, and so cannot be condensed in the cooler chimney. The main combustion reaction is C(s) + O2(g) ‚Üí CO2(g) In a restricted supply of air or oxygen, then toxic carbon monoxide can be formed: 2C(s) + O2(g) ‚Üí 2CO(g) Charcoal either in unprocessed sticks or as shaped briquettes is widely used for barbecues owing to its relatively low production of smoke and the intense heat generated needed for fast cooking of meat and fish. What little smoke is made can give the food a special flavour. Charcoal and raw wood are also commonly used for manufacture of various smoked products such as smoked salmon. Charcoal is widely used in African countries for domestic cooking purposes. Hexamine fuel tablets are entirely for the convenience of hikers and campers, and the fuel consist of white tablets made from trioxane, so it is a completely synthetic fuel and made from formaldehyde. Calorific value Smokeless fuels generally have a high calorific value, with that of anthracite being greater than dry wood for example, and many smokeless briquettes are made from this type of coal. Thus anthracite has a calorific value of 32.50 MJ/kg compared with that of dry wood of about 21 MJ/kg. Lignite or brown coal is even worse with a heat of combustion of only 15.00 MJ/kg owing to the presence of non-combustible impurities. Bituminous coal has a value lower than anthracite, but neither lignite nor bituminous coal are smokeless owing to volatile content.  Downsides  Smokeless fuels also have some downsides, typically they can be harder to ignite owing to the lack of volatiles present in anthracite for example. There are fewer flames, due to reduced volatiles but a generally higher ash content. Fines and dust can be produced by abrasion from mechanical movement but the amount is minimal compared with that produced by bituminous coal. It is sometimes supplied wet, even in sealed plastic bags, but is easily dried since the moisture is superficial. There is an increased cost to the user or consumer owing to the costs of mass manufacture although the loss of volatile chemicals such as coal tar can offset those costs to the manufacturer. Those extra costs make the fuel more expensive than coal, but the effect is small at about a 30% premium over coal at 2020 prices. Since solid fuels are bulky and heavy, they need manual transport to the fireplace and storage in a convenient spot near to the house such as a coal bunker.

The Developer Infrastructure mimics the functionality of ABAP Change and Transport System (CTS). The aim is to control deployment of components in the system landscape in a standardized manner. NWDI can be used to import Business Packages from SAP and enables development teams to modify standard applications. SAP NWDI is also known as SAP JDI (Java Development Infrastructure). The latter term is considered to be obsolete. Components NWDI consists of * Design Time Repository (DTR) * Component Build Service (CBS) * Change Management Service (CMS) Sometimes people also count the following as part of NWDI * System Landscape Directory (SLD), Directory service for SAP installations. * SAP NetWeaver Developer Studio The concept of the NWDI starts with a product and a software component (SC). The normal case is to have a one-to-one relationship between product and software component, one product is being developed and the relations between the components comprising the product are kept within a software component. A software component comprises one or more development components (DC). A development component consists of a normal project created with the Netweaver Developer Studio, i.e. a [Web Dynpro] application. The software component can also have dependencies to other SCs. All relations are defined in a SLD. Since all DCs that makes a product is kept inside a software component, the relations between the DCs are intact and versions of the different DCs are always consistent in the SC. To be able to develop a DC inside a SC, a track has to be set up in the NWDI to support that development.  Design Time Repository (DTR)  The DTR resembles a filesystem and can be accessed via WebDAV. File and folder permissions can be configured for users or groups. Each file is version controlled and it's possible to branch or merge files. The main repository folder (ws) contains folders representing tracks in the NWDI. The files checked into the NWDI are files with no local dependencies. For example, the classpath file in a project refers to local jar files and are of no use for the Component Build Service when the project is built on the server..  Component Build Service (CBS)  When a file is changed in the Netweaver Developer Studio, an activity is created together with a request. When the changes are done, the request is checked into the DTR, the activity is then activated, which triggers the CBS to build the DC on the NWDI. Usually an ear or war file is created. When the activity is released from the Netweaver Developer Studio, the ear or war file is deployed to a development system via the CMS. When the CBS finds dependencies between DCs inside the Track, all dependent DCs are rebuilt automatically. It is possible to use the CBS to rebuild a DC or even a full SC.  Change Management Service (CMS)  Change Management Service is used to maintain tracks and keep track of what version is deployed on different servers in the landscape. CMS can also transfer code between tracks. This is often used when creating tracks supporting development of general components, development of main components and finally maintaining deployment of full solutions. Transferring code between tracks in order to achieve merge and joins between deployed production versions. The CMS consists of layers on each track. *Check-In : where initial source is loaded to the track. *Development : represents the deployment to a development system. Changes are deployed on a DC level. *Consolidation : represents the deployment to a consolidation system. *Assembly : Stage to accept a change. Combines all DCs to a full SC. Version number labels are possible to set here. *Test : represents the deployment to a test system. Changes are deployed on a SC level. *Confirm : Confirmation stage before moving the change to production. *Production : represent the deployment to a production system. *System State : Gives an overview of the different versions deployed on different systems. Each layer have a history and the possibility to go back to an earlier state.

It enables business process specialists and developers to create business application components, without coding. Visual Composer produces applications in a declarative form, enabling code-free execution mode for multiple runtime environments. It provides application lifecycle support by maintaining the connection between an application and its model throughout its lifecycle. Visual Composer is designed with an open architecture, which enables developers to extend its design-time environment and modelling language, as well as to integrate external data services. The tool aims to increase productivity by reducing development effort time, and narrow the gap between application definition and implementation. Starting with a blank canvas, the Visual Composer user, typically a business process specialist, draws the application in Visual Composer Storyboard (workspace), without writing code, to prototype, design and produce applications. A typical workflow for creating, deploying and running an application using Visual Composer is: Create a model * Discover data services and add them to the model * Select necessary UI elements and add them to the model * Connect model elements to define the model logic and data flow Edit the layout * Arranging the UI elements and the controls of the application on forms and tables. Deploy the model * This step includes compilation, validation and deployment to a selected environment.

It consisted of the Parthian vassal kingdoms of Mesene and Characene and reached north along the Shatt al-Arab river and then the lower Tigris to Madhar and possibly further. Its inhabitants included Babylonians, Arabs, Iranians, and even some Indians and Malays (the Malays may have been slaves brought from the Indian sub-continent). The province was very fertile, the best place for barley according to Strabo, and contained many date palms. It was also an important trading province along the Persian Gulf.The Cambridge History of Iran, vol. 3(2): The Seleucid, Parthian, and Sasanian Periods, ed. Ehsan Yarshater (NY: Cambridge UP, 1983), 754-757. History In, the first ruler of the Sasanian dynasty, Ardashir I (r. 224‚Äì242) after having conquered his native province, Pars, invaded Meshan, killing its ruler, Bandu. Ardashir had a city named Karkh Meshan rebuilt, and had it renamed as Astarabad-Ardashir. According to a fragmentary Manichean account found in Turfan, Mihrshah, a brother of the Sasnian king Shapur I (r. 240-270), ruled as the vassal-king of Meshan. According to this Manichean account, Mihrshah was visited and converted by Mani himself - some scholars, however, doubt this source. Ardashir also built (or rebuilt) a town named Vahman-Ardashir, also known as Forat Meshan. A son of Shapur I, Shapur Mishanshah, is confirmed to have ruled Meshan from an unknown date until his death in 260, and was probably succeeded by his wife Denag. According to the inscription of king Narseh (r. 293-302), known as the Paikuli inscription, Meshan was ruled by an Iranian aristocrat named Adurfarrobay, who would later rebel against Narseh and support a claimant to the Sasanian throne, Bahram III. During the 5th century, Vahman- Ardashir had seemingly succeeded Karkh Meshan as the capital of Meshan, due to its mention as the chief city of Meshan by Syriac sources. The port of Obolla (Apologos) was located in this province. Population Like most of the other western Sasanian provinces such as Asoristan, Meshan was a province with various ethnic groups; The Assyrians, the Mesenian Arabs, and the nomadic Arabs, formed the Semitic population of the province along with Nabataean and Palmyrene merchants. Iranians had also begun to settle in the province, along with the Zutt, who had been deported from India. Other Indian groups such as the Malays may also have been deported to Meshan, either as captives or recruited sailors.

The term is normally only used in relation to a cable that has more cores than commonly encountered. Not all cables with multiple insulated conductors are called multicore cablesthe core in multicore refers to the number of usable connections made, not the number of conductors or wires. In most cases, a \\"usable connection\\" requires multiple conductors, such as the positive and negative conductors used for DC power. For example, a standard three-conductor mains cable is never referred to as multicore, but a cable comprising four coaxial cables in a single sheath would be considered multicore. Confusingly, the term multicore is occasionally used to refer to the number of individual conductors rather than the number of connections, especially in Europe. A cable with multiple conductors, but not a multicore cable, is usually called a multi-conductor or multi-wire cable.  Construction  By definition, multicore cables have an outer sheath which surrounds all of the inner conductors. This is usually in the form of an extruded PVC or cross-linked polyethylene jacket, often combined with an aluminium sheath under the surface for electromagnetic shielding. In many applications, this jacket adds significant mechanical protection, making the cable much more rugged. Sometimes each individual connection or channel also has its own jacket to aid mechanical or electromagnetic protection. Some multicore cables terminate in a multipin connector, often circular. Others split the cores into separate cables at the ends, terminating in a mass of connectors. This type of end is often called a fan or tail.  Applications  An audio multicore cable and accompanying stage box Multicore cables can be used for analog and digital signals as well as power distribution. They are often used to simplify the physical setup of a system and provide a neater connection between two pieces of equipment. For example, in sound reinforcement, a multicore cable is often used to connect all the microphones on stage to the mixing console. This is much easier than running many individual cables, which can become messy and time consuming. Some multicore cables combine different types of connections, such as a siamese cable which typically consists of power and coaxial conductors. This type of multicore is often advantageous in home wiring as it minimizes the number of cables run through the subfloor or ceiling cavity of a building. Some common applications of multicore cables are: * In audio engineering multicore cables are often called snake cables, and are used to transmit analog audio signals between equipment . * Multicore cables are used with professional video cameras. In television studios, 26-pin cables are used to connect cameras to camera control units. * In computer networking, multi- pair unshielded twisted pair cables are available, which contain more than four pairs (the number of pairs in a normal Ethernet cable). These cables are also called backbone, bundled, or feeder cables. * Coaxial cables are often joined with power cables for CCTV use, meaning that only one cable has to be run to provide a both video and power connections. * Twisted pair cables such as Ethernet cables are sometimes combined with fiber-optic cables. A common configuration is a four-pair Category 5 cable with two strands of multimode fiber optic cable. * The Xbox 360 used a \\"hybrid cable\\" to connect the console to either composite or component video inputs The \\"hybrid cable\\" used for the Xbox 360 carries both composite and component signals  See also  * Audio multicore cable * Cable harness * Electrical connector  References  Category:Cables Category:Electrical wiring Category:Signal cables Category:Television terminology ","title":"Multicore cable"},{"id":"11529073","text":"John Arthur McCarthy (March 26, 1869 ‚Äì February 1, 1948) was a professional baseball outfielder.

In 1092 games spanning over 12 seasons, McCarthy recorded a .287 batting average with 551 runs, 171 doubles, 66 triples, 8 home runs, 476 RBI and 145 stolen bases. He ended his career with a .947 fielding percentage. His last home run was hit in 1899, and from 1900 to the present no one has had more at-bats without a home run: 2,736. In 1904, McCarthy suffered an unusual injury when he tripped over the broom used by the umpire to clean home plate, and injured his ankle. Soon afterwards, a rule specified that umpires would clean home plate with a whisk broom and store it in their pocket when not in use. On April 26, 1905, McCarthy is the first fielder to throw out three base runners at home plate, achieving the feat against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He attended Holy Cross College before joining the major leagues. In 1899, he married Jessie Halpin. After his playing days, he remained in baseball for a time as a minor league manager, then took other jobs, being listed in 1930 as a clerk in a Chicago probate court.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Beaneaters (1896), Baltimore Orioles (1898), Brooklyn Superbas (1899), Washington Senators (1899), St. Louis Cardinals (1900‚Äì1901), Baltimore Orioles (1902), New York Giants (1902‚Äì1907), and Boston Doves (1908). He was also a member of the 1905 World Series champions. After beginning his professional career in minor league baseball in 1895, McGann played in MLB for the Boston Beaneaters (1896), Baltimore Orioles (1898), Brooklyn Superbas (1899), Washington Senators (1899), and St. Louis Cardinals (1900‚Äì1901) of the National League (NL) before jumping to the rival American League to play for the Baltimore Orioles in 1902. He returned to the NL, playing for the New York Giants (1902‚Äì1907) and Boston Doves (1908). In 1909‚Äì10, he played for the Milwaukee Brewers in the American Association. McGann had a troubled personal life. He suffered from depression, and several members of his family committed suicide. After the 1910 season, with rumors of McGann signing with another minor league team, McGann committed suicide with a firearm. Career =Early career (1891‚Äì1897)= McGann began his professional baseball career in minor league baseball with a team representing his hometown, Shelbyville, Kentucky, in 1891. He also played for Kentucky teams representing Harrodsburg in 1892, Lexington in 1893, and Maysville in 1894. McGann played for the Norfolk Clams/Crows of the Class-B Virginia State League in 1895 and the Lynchburg Hill Climbers of the Class-B Virginia League in 1896. He initially played all positions except for pitcher, catcher, and first baseman. In August 1896, the Boston Beaneaters of the National League (NL) purchased McGann from Lynchburg to fill in for injured second baseman Bobby Lowe. McGann batted .322 with the Beaneaters, hitting for power, but he committed 21 errors in 43 games. The Beaneaters released him following the completion of the season. McGann played the 1897 season with the Toronto Canucks of the Class-A Eastern League. He moved to first base and batted .354, leading the Eastern League with 20 triples. =Major League Baseball (1898‚Äì1908)= The Washington Senators of the NL purchased McGann, Butts Wagner, Bob McHale and Cooney Snyder from Toronto for $8,500 ($ in current dollar terms) on September 22, 1897. The Senators traded McGann with Gene DeMontreville and Doc McJames to the Baltimore Orioles of the NL for Doc Amole, Jack Doyle and Heinie Reitz that December. He played one season with the Orioles, in which he batted .301 with 106 runs batted in (RBI) in 1898, good for fifth place in the NL. When Orioles manager Ned Hanlon was hired to manage the Brooklyn Superbas during the 1899 season, receiving an ownership stake in the team to do so, he assigned several of his star players, including McGann, Joe McGinnity, Joe Kelley, Hughie Jennings and Willie Keeler to the Superbas. McGann finished second on the team in RBIs with 106, behind Kelley. McGann batted .243 for the Superbas through July 14, 1899, when they traded him with Aleck Smith to the Senators for Deacon McGuire. For the Senators, McGann batted .343 during the rest of the 1899 season. Short on money, the Senators sold McGann and Gus Weyhing to the St. Louis Cardinals for $5,000 ($ in current dollar terms) on March 9, 1900. McGann left the Cardinals before the end of 1901 season, for unknown reasons. The Cardinals replaced McGann with Bill Richardson. New York Giants before the 1905 World Series With the formation of the American League (AL) as a competitor to the NL, McGann joined many fellow NL players who jumped to the AL. Following Cardinals teammate John McGraw, who became player-manager of the Baltimore Orioles of the AL before the 1901 season, McGann signed with the Orioles. However, the Orioles struggled with debt. Joe Kelley, star player for the Orioles and son-in-law of part-owner John Mahon, reported that the team owed as much as $12,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Unable to afford that debt, Mahon purchased shares of the team from Kelley and John McGraw. With this, Mahon became the majority shareholder, owning 201 of the team's 400 shares. On July 17, 1902, Mahon sold his interest in the Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner of the Giants, and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, also of the NL. That day, Freedman released McGann, McGraw, Cy Seymour, Roger Bresnahan, Joe Kelley, Joe McGinnity, and Jack Cronin from their contracts with Orioles. Freedman signed McGann, Bresnahan, McGinnity and Cronin to the Giants, joining McGraw, who had signed with the Giants ten days earlier. Brush signed Seymour and Kelley to the Reds. With the Giants, McGraw installed McGann at first base, moving Christy Mathewson to pitcher. McGann stole 36 bases in the 1903 season. After the season, McGann and some of his Giants teammates threatened to quit the team due to the treatment of Brush, now the Giants owner, for allegedly going back on a promise to provide the Giants with a monetary bonus for having the Giants finish in the top three of the NL and a share of the gate receipts from exhibition games, in which they were paid $56.35 ($ in current dollar terms), though Brush allegedly had made over $200,000 ($ in current dollar terms). McGann and Jack Warner were rumored to join McGinnity in an outlaw league in California. McGann stole 42 bases in 1904, finishing fourth in the NL. He stole five bases on May 27, 1904, setting an NL record. McGann's record stood until Davey Lopes stole five bases in a game in 1974, and Otis Nixon stole six in a game in 1991. McGann led the team with a .286 batting average and six home runs that season. Though the Giants won the NL pennant in 1904, they refused to compete in the 1904 World Series. Brush and McGraw refused to face the AL champion Boston Americans, following their altercations with Johnson. McGann developed a reputation as a fighter in 1905. On April 21, 1905, in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, McGann punched catcher Fred Abbott after McGann was thrown out at home plate. Abbott hit McGann in the back with the ball, resulting in both players being ejected from the game. McGann batted .299 with 14 triples in 1905 as the Giants won NL pennant for the second consecutive year. Competing in the 1905 World Series, a series the Giants won over the Philadelphia Athletics in five games, McGann contributed with his bat and glove. Although McGann batted .235 in the series, he recorded four RBIs on three hits in a Game Three victory. McGann's American Tobacco Company baseball card McGann was briefly suspended by NL president Harry Pulliam for fighting on May 16, 1906. McGann finished first in the NL fielding percentage at first base from 1903 through 1906. He also served as Giants' team captain. Despite this, rumors began to circulate that the Giants were looking to trade McGann, which the team denied. Before the 1907 season, a report surfaced that the Giants would shift Mike Donlin from the outfield to first base, in order to replace McGann. Donlin denied the claim. McGann suffered a broken wrist when he was hit by a pitch thrown by Andy Coakley of the Cincinnati Reds during spring training in 1907. McGann returned to the Giants out of shape midway through the 1907 season, although he did bat .298 that season. That winter, trade rumours began to swirl that the Giants would trade him to the Reds. Instead, the Giants traded McGann to the Boston Doves with Frank Bowerman, George Browne, Bill Dahlen and Cecil Ferguson for Al Bridwell, Tom Needham and Fred Tenney on December 13, 1907. Tenney, also a first baseman, was designated as McGann's replacement at first. When a reporter asked McGraw about McGann and Tenney, pointing out that both first basemen were 36 years old, McGraw replied that Tenney had taken better care of himself. Despite discussion of appointing McGann player-manager of the Doves, the role was assigned to Kelley. Agreeing to terms with George Dovey, president of the Doves, McGann played 135 games during the 1908 season, but batted only .240. During an April 1908 game between the Doves and the Giants, McGraw insulted McGann as slow, referring to him as a \\"damned ice wagon\\", noting \\"that's how the Giants lost a lot of games last season\\". After the game, McGann went to the Giants' hotel, waited for McGraw to return from the theatre, and fought him in a billiard room. Dovey released McGann from the Doves after the 1908 season. =Later career (1909‚Äì1910)= McGann signed with the Milwaukee Brewers of the Class-A American Association for the 1909 season. He played for Milwaukee in 1909 and 1910, batting only .225 in 1910, his career low. There were reports McGann might sign with the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League or a team in Louisville, Kentucky, near his Shelbyville home in 1911. McGann's career was ended, however, by his death in December 1910. =Career statistics= In 1437 games over 12 seasons, McGann posted a .284 batting average (1482-for-5226) with 842 runs, 181 doubles, 100 triples, 42 home runs, 727 RBI, 282 stolen bases, 429 bases on balls, .364 on-base percentage and .381 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .987 fielding percentage playing 1377 games at first base and 53 games at second base. Personal life Cap McGann with the New York Giants in 1905 McGann invested in real estate and financial holdings near his Shelbyville home during his career. At the time of his death, his property was assessed to be worth approximately $40,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Family McGann suffered from severe clinical depression, a condition which ran throughout his family. One of McGann's sisters committed suicide in 1890 after their mother died. On New Year's Eve in 1907, one of McGann's brothers died as a result of an accidental shooting. In 1909, another of McGann's brothers committed suicide. Death On December 13, 1910, McGann committed suicide by shooting himself in the heart at a Louisville hotel. At the time of his death, he was 39 years old, and reportedly had been \\"in the best of health and humor\\" when last seen. McGann was survived by two sisters, who, despite the family history of suicide, believed their brother had been murdered, as a diamond ring valued at $800 ($ in current dollar terms) McGann had been seen wearing was missing.

It is based on the novel by Sam Hanna Bell. The film won a special jury award at the 1990 European Film Awards.\\"European Film Academy\\" Retrieved on 6 October 2009 Plot Sarah Gilmartin comes with her mother Martha to keep house for a widower and his two grown sons, on their farm in Ireland in 1909. After Hamilton Echlin Sr. dies in a boating accident, Sarah's mother, dismayed by his sons' and her own daughter's refusal to attend church and behave in a manner she approves of, leaves the household, but Sarah stays on as housekeeper, and eventually takes first taciturn younger brother Frank (Hinds) and then amiable elder brother Hamilton (McCann), as lovers. When she becomes pregnant and refuses to marry either man or even specify which is the father of the boy she delivers, the local minister (Patrick Malahide) is deeply unsettled by her indifference to convention. She rebuffs his attempts to make her conform and give the child \\"a name\\" by declaring that all clergy want is for people's lives, however \\"botched inside,\\" to appear \\"smooth to the eyelike lazy work.\\" The community seems only mildly censorious of the relationship between the three, but when Frank yearns for a woman all his own and makes overtures to a local girl, her male relatives beat him savagely in retaliation, crippling him. The film then moves forward in time: Sarah's children (she has since had a daughter) plead with her to marry, as her stubborn unconventionality makes it impossible for them to be completely accepted by the local community. Realizing that her daughter's happiness is at stake, Sarah relents and marries Hamilton.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1884 through 1896 for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys / Pirates, St. Louis Browns, and Louisville Colonels. In 1894, he was a player-manager for the Browns. Born in Brooklyn, Miller entered minor league baseball at the age of 18 and advanced to the major leagues the next season. Primarily a catcher, Miller shunned the protective equipment that was becoming standard for that position, and that made catching too physically demanding to do every day. As a result, on days when his team was resting him as a catcher, they used him almost anywhere else on the field. He became the first major league player to appear in 20 or more games at all eight non-pitching positions. After his last major league appearance in 1896, he was a minor league player, manager and part-owner at various points through 1903. Not much is known about the few years that Miller spent in retirement from professional baseball. He died in Brooklyn of kidney disease in 1909. Early career In 1883, an 18-year-old Miller debuted in professional baseball with the Harrisburg squad in the Interstate Association. A year later, he made the major leagues with the Pittsburgh Alleghenys of the American Association (AA). He spent ten seasons in Pittsburgh, staying with the team in 1887 when the team joined the National League (NL), ultimately becoming known as the Pirates. In the AA, players and coaches often kept up lively chatter during the games, but Miller was even more energetic than most of his peers. When Pittsburgh came to the NL, their opponents were often taken aback by the 5'6\\" catcher's steady stream of booming exclamations. His nickname, \\"Doggie\\", alluded to his hobby of dog breeding,Weeks, p. 4. but Miller was sometimes also known as \\"Calliope\\" or \\"Foghorn\\" ‚Äì references to his gruff voice and boisterous manner ‚Äì especially early in his career. He became known for some characteristic mannerisms, including what sportswriter Hugh Fullerton described as \\"a funny little ballet girl kick\\" just before he swung the bat. Miller could play almost any position on the field, but he was most comfortable as a catcher. However, overhand pitching had been introduced in professional baseball around the time that Miller's career started, and most catchers had started to wear protective equipment such as a chest protector. Miller's refusal to don the chest protector made that position more physically demanding, limiting his playing time at that position.Weeks, p. 9. While he could not catch every day, Miller's defense at any other position was often subpar. \\"[Miller] covered about as much ground as a woodshed, and threw to first like a drunkard with a cork leg,\\" writer Len Washburn once said of a game in which Miller played shortstop for Pittsburgh. Still, he became the first major league player to spend 20 or more games at each non-pitching position. Move to the National League When the upstart Players' League emerged before the 1890 season, nearly all of Pittsburgh's roster moved over to the new league or to other teams; only Miller and Billy Sunday remained on the NL team, so the roster was filled by minor league or semipro replacement players and the team finished 23‚Äì113 that year. With Pittsburgh that year, Miller played in an extremely rare tripleheader; as of 2018, it is one of three times in baseball history that three games were played by the same teams on the same day. The hapless Pittsburgh team lost all three games to the Brooklyn squad; with Pittsburgh trailing by one run in the first game, Miller hit a triple and was thrown out trying to stretch the triple into a home run. After the Players' League's lone season, players like Jake Beckley returned to the NL and Pittsburgh achieved a winning record within two seasons. In 1892, Miller's batting average was an unremarkable .254, but he was the hardest player in the league to strike out, batting 44.5 times for every time that he struck out. By 1893, he was struggling to hit well enough to stay in the major leagues. After 41 games that season, Miller had a .182 batting average when he was demoted to the minor leagues. Playing for the Harrisburg Hustlers of the Pennsylvania State League, Miller rebounded well, hitting .364 in 39 games. In 1894, looking at Miller's experience as a team captain and his improved performance once in the minor leagues the year before, St. Louis Browns owner Chris von der Ahe hired Miller as a player-manager, adding him to the carousel of men who managed the team for a season or less in the 1890s. Von der Ahe, notorious for meddling in the field management of his teams, promised Miller that he would not interfere. Miller promised von der Ahe that he would avoid drinking. \\"Neither man was true to his word,\\" researcher J. Thomas Hetrick wrote in a biography of von der Ahe.Hetrick, p. 158. During one game that year, von der Ahe sent the team's official scorer down to the field to replace a hungover Miller as manager for the day.Hetrick, p. 161. Miller did implement a stark change for the Browns shortly after taking the job. He thought that rifle shooting would help with eye‚Äìhand coordination, so he took his players to a shooting range each morning. On defense, Miller began catching much less frequently; he played more often at third base and at a few other positions. When he was not on the field, Miller performed in the Wild West show that von der Ahe had bought from Buck Taylor.Hetrick, p. 162. His team finished 56‚Äì76‚Äì1. Miller came back as a player in 1895, but von der Ahe hired Al Buckenberger to step in as manager. Later life In 1896, Miller spent the season with the Louisville Colonels, playing in 98 games that year. They released him after that season, and he signed with the Minneapolis Millers of the Western League for 1897. Early that year, newspaper reports held that Cap Anson was interested in signing him to a major league contract. However, Miller played a full season for the Millers, hitting .338 and stealing 45 bases, and he never returned to the major leagues. His career statistics are mostly unremarkable, except that as of 2018 he ranks 12th all-time in career at-bat-to-strikeout ratio (33.7). Miller finished his playing career with a two-year stint in Fort Wayne, Indiana. There, after he was ejected from a 1900 game, he accosted the umpire after the game and bloodied the umpire's face. Miller was arrested and was fined $100 by the team, and a newspaper report speculated that he might not be allowed to play professionally anymore. He was allowed to continue playing with the Fort Wayne team through the 1901 season. In 1902, Miller was co-owner and player-manager of the Saginaw White Sox (Saginaw, Michigan) of the Michigan State League during some unusual events that led to the team's relocation to another city in the middle of the season. Miller's co-owner, C. F. Baker of Fort Wayne, Indiana, failed to pay salaries, league fees and other bills. Miller was said to have been an innocent victim of Baker's attempt to pocket extra money. In July 1902, Miller had the team transferred to W. W. Todd of the drug company known as Waldron & Todd. Todd lived in Jackson, Michigan, and the team relocated there with its roster unaffected and with Miller staying on as manager. Miller managed and played for the Dayton Veterans of the new Central League in 1903. This appears to have been his last appearance in professional baseball. Relatively little is known about his life after that, though there is a reference to Miller pursuing umpiring on some level. He died of kidney disease in his Brooklyn home in 1909. He was buried at Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery in Brooklyn.

Mar Ammo, a disciple of Mani, founder of Manichaeism, led a mission to Abarshahr accompanied by the Parthian prince Ardavan and several others during the 260s. It is suggested that Ardavan, as a Manichean member of the Parthian elite, helped Mar Ammo to preach amongst the Parthian nobility and spread Manichaeism.Zsuzsanna Gul√°csi, Mani's Pictures: The Didactic Images of the Manichaeans from Sasanian Mesopotamia to Uygur Central Asia and Tang-Ming China, pp.74-75 In 629, during the Sasanian civil war of 628-632, Abarshahr was briefly ruled by the Sasanian usurper Khosrow III. In 651, the last Sasanian king Yazdegerd III was murdered by under the orders of his own general, Mahoe Suri, which marked the end of the Sasanian dynasty. However, Abarshahr continued to be under the rule of the kanarang, who was no longer under the suzerainty of the Sasanians. However, this was soon to end: in 652, Abarshahr was invaded by the Arab military general Abdullah ibn Aamir, who made a treaty with the kanarang, Kanadbak. In the treaty Kanadbak agreed to pay tribute to the Arabs while still remaining in control of his territories in Tus. However, at the same time, the Karenids of Nishapur under Burzin Shah and Sawar Karin, were threatening both Kanadbak and Abdullah, and managed to reclaim territory in Khorasan, which included cities such as Nishapur which was once under their control.Pourshariati (2008), pp. 274 Abdullah then promised Kanadbak to give him back his lost territory, in return for help against the Karenid rebels. They then started pillaging the surroundings of Nishapur, and fought heavily to capture the city. Sawar then tried to make peace with Abdullah, and told him that he would open the gates of Nishapur if the latter pardoned him.Pourshariati (2008), pp. 273 Abdullah agreed, however, when the gates were opened, he entered the gate with his army, and started to plunder the city and killing citizens, until Kanadbak said to him: \\"O amir, once you have been victorious and triumphant forgiveness is a higher [virtue] than revenge and retribution.\\" Abdullah then did as the latter said and restored the city to Kanadbak, who continued to rule as a Rashidun vassal.Pourshariati (2008), pp. 272, 275‚Äì276  References   Sources   Category:Provinces of the Sasanian Empire Category:History of Razavi Khorasan Province Category:651 disestablishments ","title":"Abarshahr"},{"id":"11529323","text":"The United Nations Interpretation Service is a part of the Meetings and Publishing Division (MPD) of the UN's Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (DGACM). Its core function is to provide interpretation from and into Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish for meetings held at United Nations Headquarters, and those at other locations which the department is responsible for servicing. Interpretation is essential to the inter-governmental bodies for the proper conduct and smooth functioning of their deliberations.Abud-Krafft, Salome and Elena Howard.

History and evolution The creation of the conference interpreting service ‚Äì and the interpreting profession itself ‚Äì at the United Nations has a direct connection with the evolution of international diplomatic relations, the League of Nations, the Nuremberg trials, the founding of the United Nations, and the birth of multilingualism within the United Nations itself.Interpreters at the United Nations: A History Baigorri-Jal√≥n, Jes√∫s. Barr, Anne (English translation from Spanish). Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca:2004, page 106. . =Early days of the interpreting profession= Most of the early interpreters of the United Nations were natural polyglots who were uprooted by wars and revolutions. For years, the only criterion used to select potential interpreters was the knowledge of two international languages the interpreters had to communicate in. Polyglots were found mainly in privileged social groups, government employees and professionals in colonial empires, in militarily and diplomatically powerful nations, in political or ideological exiles, in those who leave their countries temporarily for academic purposes, and in children of couples who speak different languages. After the 1960s, there was change in the sociological make-up of UN interpreters. The United Nations began recruiting and training potential interpreters who were monolingual from birth but had learned and specialized in languages. This generation of interpreters did not come from privileged groups or complex migratory backgrounds. In contrast with the early beginnings of the profession, there was also a progressive addition of women in the field of conference interpreting. =Modern-day conference interpreting= At the League of Nations and during the San Francisco Conference (1945) before the formal founding of the United Nations, the interpreters played a vital and visible role in meetings. In consecutive interpretation, conference interpreters spoke from the same dais as the original speakers, and the speaker stops periodically so that the interpreter can interpret what has just been said while the participants in the meeting viewed and listened to the consecutive interpreter. The conference interpreters were often exposed to selected or large audiences and the media.\\"Interpreters: Inside the Glass Booth\\", Endrst, Elsa B.

In the late 1940s and the early 1950s, United Nations officials introduced simultaneous interpretation as a preferred method for the majority of UN meetings because it saved time and improved the quality of the output. Simultaneous interpreting ‚Äì a mode that confined the interpreters in glass-encased booths aided with earpieces and microphones ‚Äì arose in the 1920s and 1930s when American businessman Edward Filene and British engineer A. Gordon-Finlay developed simultaneous interpretation equipment with IBM, and was also used in the post-World War II Nazi war crime trials held in Nuremberg, Germany.

Biography Marcos Paz was born to a prominent Tucuman family in 1813. His father was Juan Bautista Paz, a lawyer and legislator who served as deputy governor of the province several times, and his brother was General Gregorio Paz. He earned a law degree in 1834. He married the former Micaela Cascallares, daughter of a wealthy landowner, and settled with her in Buenos Aires. After the fall of Juan Manuel de Rosas in 1852 he joined Justo Jos√© de Urquiza in his fight against Bartolom√© Mitre's forces in Buenos Aires, and joined Col. Hilario Lagos as an adjutant; the siege was ultimately unsuccessful. Elected Governor of Tucum√°n in 1858, Paz took part in the San Jos√© de Flores Pact of 1859, which helped secure national unity, and was elected to the 1860 convention that produced the first amendments to the Constitution of Argentina. He then assisted Gen. Wesceslao Paunero, who was sent as an envoy by Mitre to other provincial leaders, and served briefly in his stead as Governor of C√≥rdoba, from December 1861 to March 1862. An erstwhile foe, Buenos Aires leader Bartolom√© Mitre, befriended Paz during earlier negotiations, and nominated him as running mate for the 1862 elections. Mitre had obtained significant concessions for Buenos Aires following his victory at the Battle of Pav√≥n in 1861, and the choice of Paz, who as a supporter of the Argentine Confederation would have otherwise be an opponent, was part of Mitre's bid to placate separatist sentiment outside Buenos Aires Province. The duo won unanimously in the electoral college, and Paz became Vice-President of Argentina. When Mitre was away commanding the allied forces during the Paraguayan War, Paz fulfilled the role of acting President. He died in office on January 2, 1868, in Buenos Aires, as a victim of a Cholera epidemic, and Mitre had to return to Argentina to resume his position as President. Legacy The Marcos Paz Partido, administrative division of Buenos Aires Province and its capital, the town of Marcos Paz are named after him.

Mount Moehau is the highest point of the range, at 892m above sea level. Physical geography The Moehau Range is the central feature of the Colville Ecological District. Environment Waikato's local area planting guide describes the area as \\"long ridges and steep streams radiating out to the coast, steep and broken hillslopes, floodplains, harbours and estuaries.\\" The Colville Ecological District takes in 77,201 ha, 59% of which is in indigenous vegetation, and 8% of which is virgin forest.Environment Waikato, What to Plant in Coromandel Ecological Region To the south the range is drained by Waikawau River. = Geology = Most of the range is made up of metamorphic, prehnite-pumpellyite Manaia Hill Group greywackeÀå sandstones and siltstones (Waipapa terrane) of Jurassic/Cretaceous age, formed about 150 million years ago. They have few fossils, but are interbedded with feldspar-lithic volcanic sandstone, siltstone and mudstone/argillite, with minor conglomerate and coarse sandstone. To the south west of the range the Paritu Pluton is exposed. It consists of 17 million year old mid Miocene sub-volcanic intrusions, including hornblende-pyroxene granodiorite, pyroxene-hornblende quartz diorite and biotite-pyroxene. Several dikes of andesite porphyry and quartz porphyry were intruded into the Manaia Hill rocks around 15 million years ago.  'Granite' quarries  Coromandel granite was first advertised in 1900. It has been quarried in the plutonic area, on the coast between Port Jackson and Waiaro, at Paritu quarry, The quarry was taken over by the Coromandel Granite Company in 1918, when a wharf was built about a kilometre to the south. Although called granite, it is a quartz diorite rock. It has been used for many monuments and buildings, including Parliament House, Auckland Chief Post Office, Auckland War Memorial Museum, Auckland Ferry Terminal and Auckland Railway Station. Quarrying ended in the 1960s, though in the early 1990s Moehau quarry was reopened for the refurbishment of Parliament House.  Demographics  The area is sparsely populated. In the area north of Port Charles Road, which includes the whole of the range, the 2013 population was only 129, living in 63 houses. However, it is part of Te Rerenga census area, where are 2,028 dwellings were occupied, but 3,897 unoccupied. The main settlements are Port Jackson and Port Charles. = Port Jackson = Port Jackson is a bay on the north coast, just south of Cape Colville. = Port Charles = Cook named Port Charles as he sailed by on 17 November 1769. A sawmill opened in 1865 and closed in 1890, later belonging to the Auckland Timber Co and with a tramway. The population was 67 in 1901. Northern Steamship Co. vessels used to call at Port Charles. The road from Colville opened in 1928. A volunteer fire fighting group is based locally. There were severe floods in 1950 2002 and 2016, the 1950 flood moving the school off its foundations, bringing about its closure and 2002 flooding 23 homes. The beach is also being eroded.  History  Mt Moehau is sacred to the Marut≈´ƒÅhu tribes of MƒÅori. Many important chiefs, including Tama-te-kapua of Te Arawa, are buried on its summit. The full name of the mountain is Te Moengahau-o- Tamatekapua (the windy sleeping place of Tamatekapua). Biodiversity The Moehau Range is considered one of New Zealand's six 'biodiversity hot spots'. The Moehau peak contains a selection of indigenous vegetation that is unique for a North Island forest, and is home to silver and pink pine, kaikawaka, sweet hutu (Ascarina sp.) and southern rata, and is the northern limit for many southern montane species such as mountain toatoa and mountain cedar (pahautea). The range is also noteworthy for the rare native Archey's frog (Leiopelma archeyi), whose young hatch from eggs, bypassing the tadpole stage. Moehau is also home to the Moehau stag beetle (Geodorcus sp.), the Moehau wƒìtƒÅ (Hemiandrus sp.) and a population of approximately 500 brown kiwi.Ecotours: Wildlife: Bay of Plenty: Coromandel, accessed 28 May 2007Environment Waikato, What to Plant in Coromandel Ecological Region The Moehau Environment Group works to protect and enhance the natural environment of the Northern Coromandel Peninsula.Thomas Everth, To Fence or not to Fence?: An opinion on the proposed Coromandel predator fence In 2020 the group were given $400,000 to do possum, mustelid, rat and cat control on up to .

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1883 to 1895 for the Providence Grays, Philadelphia Quakers/Phillies, Philadelphia Athletics, Washington Senators, and Brooklyn Grooms. Mulvey survived a gunshot wound to the shoulder with Providence in his first major league season, and he became best known as a third baseman for the three Philadelphia teams between 1883 and 1892. Early career Mulvey on a baseball card, 1887 Mulvey broke into the major leagues with the Providence Grays of the National League in 1883. He played in a total of four games for the Grays, but his tenure there was not without some excitement. In June 1883, Grays outfielder Cliff Carroll had antagonized one of the team's fans ‚Äì a man named Jimmy Murphy ‚Äì by spraying Murphy with a water hose as the fan was watching the Grays warm up. Enraged, Murphy went home and retrieved a gun. Mulvey was not seriously injured in the shooting, and Murphy was arrested. He returned to the park, waited until the players were leaving the field at the end of the game, and fired a shot at Carroll. His aim was off, and the bullet struck Mulvey in the shoulder. Mulvey sustained only a flesh wound, and Murphy was arrested. Mulvey was traded to the Philadelphia Quakers (later renamed the Philadelphia Phillies) shortly after the shooting, and he played in another three games that season after switching to third base. The following year, Mulvey began playing regularly for the Quakers, appearing in 100 of their 120 games. He would play regularly for Quakers/Phillies through the 1889 season. Later career In 1890, following many other stars of the National League, he jumped to the Players' League, where he joined the Philadelphia Athletics as their starting 3rd baseman. When the Players' League folded after a single season, the Athletics moved to the American Association, and Mulvey went with the team.Joe Mulvey Stats. Baseball-Reference.com. Retrieved April 8, 2019. The 1892 season saw Mulvey rejoining the Phillies, where he was now the back- up to Charlie Reilly. The following season saw him traded to the Washington Senators, where he split 3rd base duties with 3 other players: Duke Farrell, Cub Stricker, and Sam Wise. Mulvey did not play in the 1894 season, but he returned to baseball for the 1895 season, playing with the Brooklyn Grooms, as the backup to Billy Shindle. For his career, Mulvey batted .261, with 28 home runs. According to his statistics, his best year was 1890 with the Philadelphia Athletics, in which he achieved career highs for RBIs (87), walks (27), on-base percentage (.326), slugging percentage (.428) and doubles (26). He almost equaled his career bests for home runs (5) and batting average that year as well (.287). The most home runs he had in any one year was 6, with the Phillies in 1884 and 1889, and his best batting average was .289, also with the Phillies in 1889. Along with five other players, Mulvey still holds the record for most errors by a third baseman in a single game, 6, set on July 30, 1884. Death Mulvey was found dead inside the Phillies locker room at Shibe Park on the morning of August 21, 1928. He worked at the park as a watchman and had attended a boxing match there the previous night. Mulvey, who was 69, appeared to have suffered from heart problems. He is interred at Magnolia Cemetery.

It is sometimes known as the silver-eared honeyeater, but this name is also used for the silver-eared honeyeater (Lichmera alboauricularis) of New Guinea. Description The grey-eared honeyeater is 13 to 17 cm long with the males being larger than the females. The plumage is mainly dull green-brown above and grey with an olive tint below. The cheeks are silvery-grey, and the crown is dark grey. The black bill is long and slightly downcurved; the legs and feet are blue-grey. Juveniles are paler than the adults without the silvery cheeks. They are noisy birds which begin calling before dawn. They have a harsh ' call and a warbling song. Distribution and habitat It is a common bird across most of its range and occurs in the lowlands and low hills in a variety of habitats, including forest, scrub, mangroves, and gardens. There are five subspecies; the nominate subspecies L. i. incana is found on Grande Terre, the main island of New Caledonia. L. i. poliotis and L. i. mareensis are found on the Loyalty Islands to the north-east of New Caledonia. L. i. flavotincta and L. i. griseoviridis occur in Vanuatu. Behaviour =Feeding= Grey-eared honeyeaters feed from the shrub layer up to the canopy, moving from branch to branch in search of flowers from which they take nectar and pollen. They also feed on insects and spiders, searching among leaves or making short flights into the air to catch them. They will sometimes hover in front of flowers or spider webs looking for food. =Reproduction= The breeding season usually lasts from October to February. The nest is made mainly of grass and plant fibres, held together by spider webs. It is built in the fork of a branch in a tree or bush. Two eggs are laid; these are white with a few reddish spots and are incubated for 14 days. The young birds are fed on insects and spiders and leave the nest after 12 days.

He played at Michigan State University and then was drafted in the first-round of the 1986 NFL Draft by the St. Louis Cardinals as the first linebacker selected in that year's draft under new Cardinals coach Gene Stallings. While enrolled at Michigan State University in 1986, Bell was selected to receive the Chester Brewer Leadership Award which is presented to \\"a graduating senior for distinguished performance in athletics and scholarship, and for possessing a high degree of leadership qualities and skill.\\" After playing for the Arizona Cardinals, Detroit Lions, and the Los Angeles Raiders, he was released in 1992 as a free agent. He played in the 1995 season for the Ottawa Rough Riders of the CFL, and retired soon thereafter.

Nitrogen fixation is an important part of the nitrogen cycle. Plants cannot use atmospheric nitrogen (N2); they must use nitrogen compounds such as nitrates. Characteristics Bradyrhizobium species are Gram-negative bacilli (rod-shaped) with a single subpolar or polar flagellum. They are common soil- dwelling micro-organisms that can form symbiotic relationships with leguminous plant species where they fix nitrogen in exchange for carbohydrates from the plant. Like other rhizobia, many members of this genus have the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen into forms readily available for other organisms to use. Bradyrhizobia are also major components of forest soil microbial communities, where strains isolated from these soils are not typically capable of nitrogen fixation or nodulation. They are slow-growing in contrast to Rhizobium species, which are considered fast-growing rhizobia. In a liquid medium, Bradyrhizobium species take 3‚Äì5 days to create a moderate turbidity and 6‚Äì8 hours to double in population size. They tend to grow best with pentoses as carbon sources. Some strains (for example, USDA 6 and CPP) are capable of oxidizing carbon monoxide aerobically. Nodulation =Nodule formation= Nodules are growths on the roots of leguminous plants where the bacteria reside. The plant roots secrete amino acids and sugars into the rhizosphere. The rhizobia move toward the roots and attach to the root hairs. The plant then releases flavanoids, which induce the expression of nod genes within the bacteria. The expression of these genes results in the production of enzymes called nod factors that initiate root hair curling. During this process, the rhizobia are curled up with the root hair. The rhizobia penetrate the root hair cells with an infection thread that grows through the root hair into the main root. This causes the infected cells to divide and form a nodule. The rhizobia can now begin nitrogen fixation. =Nod genes= Over 55 genes are known to be associated with nodulation. NodD is essential for the expression of the other nod genes. The two different nodD genes are: nodD1 and nodD2. Only nodD1 is needed for successful nodulation. Nitrogen fixation Bradyrhizobium and other rhizobia take atmospheric nitrogen and fix it into ammonia (NH3) or ammonium (NH4+). Plants cannot use atmospheric nitrogen; they must use a combined or fixed form of the element. After photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation (or uptake) is the most important process for the growth and development of plants. The levels of ureide nitrogen in a plant correlate with the amount of fixed nitrogen the plant takes up. =Genes= Nif and fix are important genes involved in nitrogen fixation among Bradyrhizobium species. Nif genes are very similar to genes found in Klebsiella pneumoniae, a free- living diazotroph. The genes found in bradyrhizobia have similar function and structure to the genes found in K. pneumoniae. Fix genes are important for symbiotic nitrogen fixation and were first discovered in rhizobia species. The nif and fix genes are found in at least two different clusters on the chromosome. Cluster I contains most of the nitrogen fixation genes. Cluster II contains three fix genes located near nod genes. Diversity This genus of bacteria can form either specific or general symbioses; one species of Bradyrhizobium may only be able to nodulate one legume species, whereas other Bradyrhizobium species may be able to nodulate several legume species. Ribosomal RNA is highly conserved in this group of microbes, making Bradyrhizobium extremely difficult to use as an indicator of species diversity. DNA‚ÄìDNA hybridizations have been used instead and show more diversity. However, few phenotypic differences are seen, so not many species have been named. Significance Grain legumes are cultivated on about 1.5 million km2 of land per year. The amount of nitrogen fixed annually is about 44‚Äì66 million tons worldwide, providing almost half of all nitrogen used in agriculture. Bradyrhizobium has also been identified as a contaminant of DNA extraction kit reagents and ultrapure water systems, which may lead to its erroneous appearance in microbiota or metagenomic datasets. The presence of nitrogen-fixing bacteria as contaminants may be due to the use of nitrogen gas in ultrapure water production to inhibit microbial growth in storage tanks. Application Bradyrhizobia fix more nitrogen than the plant can use. The excess nitrogen is left in the soil and available for other plants or later crops. Intercropping with a legume has the potential to decrease the need for applied fertilizer. Commercial inoculants of Bradyrhizobium are available. These can be applied as a peat or liquid directly to the seed before planting. Species * Bradyrhizobium betae was isolated from tumor-like root deformations on sugar beets; they have an unknown symbiotic status. * Bradyrhizobium elkanii, Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens, and Bradyrhizobium liaoningense establish symbiosis with soybeans. * Bradyrhizobium japonicum nodulates soybeans, cowpeas, mung beans, and siratro. * Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense nodulates Lespedeza. * Bradyrhizobium canariense nodulates genistoid legumes endemic to the Canary Islands. It has also been found in lupin and serradella nodules in western Australia and southern Africa.

The Act amended the earlier section 404(b) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (FAA), which was repealed by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. The ACAA prohibits commercial airlines from discriminating against passengers with disabilities. The act was passed by the U.S. Congress in direct response to a narrow interpretation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by the U.S. Supreme Court in U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) v. Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA). In PVA, the Supreme Court held that private, commercial air carriers are not liable under Section 504 because they are not \\"direct recipients\\" of federal funding to airports. The Act was construed to contain an implied private right of action. However, in 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Alexander v. Sandoval,532 U.S. 275 (2001) which held that federal courts may not find an implied private right unless a statute gives explicit indication that Congress intended to bestow such a right. In 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit followed the lead of the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which relied on the Sandoval decision to hold that the Act can only be enforced by filing an administrative complaint with the DOT. In 2013, the DOT provided new rules requiring all domestic and foreign air carriers to have accessible websites and kiosks. By December 12, 2015 the core functionality of all Air Carrier's websites needed to be accessible, by December 12, 2016 the remaining web pages are required to be accessible. Since this act prohibits airlines from discriminating against passengers with disabilities, they must allow them to bring along their service animals. In recent years, people have been taking advantage of this act. Delta Air Lines released the statistic that they've seen an 84% increase in animal incidents. Not all of the disability animals that have came through the doors of Delta Air Lines however, have actually been service animals.

It stars Jeanne Balibar, Marianne Basler, H√©l√®ne de Fougerolles, and Catherine Rouvel. In the normal version, Va Savoir is 154 minutes. It was entered into the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. The story of the three couples in the film sometimes parallels the Pirandello playCome tu mi vuoi, a lesser known work that was adapted into the film As You Desire Me starring Greta Garbo. in which the two principals, Camille and Ugo, are performing each night and follows the structure of a Goldoni comedy, in which couples undergo misunderstandings and attraction for others until the final resolution. In the film's ending, the three couples waltz in a circle to the tune Senza fine (Endless), implying that the dance of young people in love will go on for ever. Plot After three years away, the actress Camille returns to Paris in an Italian troupe run by her husband Ugo, who is touring Europe with an Italian-language production of a Luigi Pirandello play Come Tu Mi Vuoi (As You Want Me). Camille is nervous because she still has feelings over leaving her lover Pierre, who she tracks down in a park. He seems unchanged and has still not finished writing his doctoral thesis on Martin Heidegger. Ugo meanwhile is pursuing his private search for a lost play by Goldoni and in a library meets the attractive Dominique, who tells him to try a collector. The collector sends him to the private library inherited by Dominique's mother, who warns him that books have disappeared. She is happy for him to browse and Dominique helps him. When she takes him to her bedroom, however, her jealous half-brother Arthur intervenes (it is later revealed that he is her secret lover). Dominique warns Ugo that it is Arthur who steals books to sell. Pierre asks Camille and Ugo to dinner at his flat with his lover Sonia, which proves a disaster as the nervous Camille drinks too much and the jealous Ugo mocks Pierre. When Camille goes round next day to apologise to Sonia, the two women begin to form a rapport. Now able to be friends with Sonia, Camille is still worried that she has not closed things with Pierre. When she goes to see him, he locks her in a room. Camille escapes by a skylight and barely makes the theater curtain call of the performance, which Sonia attends. Afterwards in a bar Arthur pretends to pursue Sonia while taking an impression of her very valuable diamond ring, which he later replaces with a worthless duplicate. In despair at this deceit, Sonia asks Camille for help. She goes round to Arthur's flat and offers him a simple deal: he can choose to either spend the night with her and never see her afterwards, or to have her walk out on the spot. He opts for the night and, once he is asleep, she searches until she finds the ring in the kitchen. Ugo then calls on Pierre and challenges him to a duel, place and weapons to be his choice. When Pierre accepts, he finds that the place is over the flies in the theatre and the weapons are a bottle of vodka each. As Pierre is the first to fall over, Ugo wins. In the meantime Dominique has found the Goldoni play, not in the library but in the kitchen among her mother's cookbooks. When she brings it to Ugo, roaring drunk after his duel, he says it is so valuable that she must keep it and just give him a photocopy. Camille turns up with the ring and offers it back to Sonia, who says Camille has earned it and must keep it. Reunited and now rich, Camille and Ugo look forward to the next stop on their tour.

The reopening in 2010 of the Onehunga Branch to passenger traffic may make it more feasible for the line to connect with that branch in Onehunga township. New Zealand Railways Corporation owns most of the corridor for the line, which follows Oakley Creek and part of the State Highway 20 corridor. The SH20 extension from Hillsborough to Mount Roskill made provision for the line's construction. The line would cross over the entrance to the SH20 Waterview Connection. KiwiRail has reached an agreement with the NZ Transport Agency over a land swap needed for a realignment of the highway and railway corridors. Another proposal exists to connect the Onehunga Branch at Galway Street to the Avondale‚ÄîSouthdown line by building a tunnel under Onehunga Mall to meet Hugh Watt Drive (State Highway 20) before connecting to the proposed route at Hillsborough.

Byzantine Rite Lutheranism (also known as Byzantine Lutheranism or Eastern Lutheranism) refers to Lutheran Churches, such as those of Ukraine and Slovenia, that use a form of the Byzantine Rite as their liturgy. It is unique in that it is based on the Eastern Christian rite used by the Eastern Orthodox Church, while incorporating theology from the Divine Service contained in the Formula Missae, the base texts for Lutheran liturgics in the West. The Byzantine Lutheran Rite includes the filioque in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, albeit placing it in brackets. Eastern Lutherans use the Julian calendar for the calendar and thus observe feast days and liturgical seasons, such as Great Lent, in a fashion similar to Orthodox customs. As such, many Byzantine Lutheran holy days are shared with those of the Eastern Orthodox Church; in addition, Eastern Lutheran churches are constructed in accordance with Byzantine architecture. Posture during worship, such as bowing, is identical to that in other parts of Eastern Christianity. Within Byzantine Rite Lutheranism, the calendar of saints includes persons esteemed in Eastern Christianity, such as John Chrysostom and Nestor the Chronicler, as well as those specific to the Lutheran Church, such as Lucas Cranach the Elder and Martin Luther. The Byzantine Rite was first used in the Ukrainian Lutheran Church. The first published Liturgy of the Eastern Rite was in 1933. The English text of the rite now in use is almost identical to that of the original printing. Some contemporary communities, such as St. Valentine's Fellowship, the Eastern Rite Community (Ostkirchlicher Konvent) in Germany and the Czech Republic, and the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Slovenia also utilize the Byzantine Rite. In the region of Galicia, Eastern Lutherans were persecuted by the communist r√©gime, which instituted a policy of state atheism. From 1939-1945, many Eastern Lutheran clergy were martyred for their faith. Theodor Yarchuk, a priest who was a major leader in the Ukrainian Lutheran Church of the Augsburg Confession was tortured and killed in Stanislaviv by communist authorities. Many Ukrainian Lutheran laypersons were also sent to the Gulag, where they died. During this time of the persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union, property of the Lutheran Church was expropriated. After the collapse of USSR, the Ukrainian Lutheran Church experienced a revival.

For a constant temperature, the smaller the difference, the more moisture there is, and the higher the relative humidity. In the lower troposphere, more moisture (small dew point depression) results in lower cloud bases and lifted condensation levels (LCL). LCL height is an important factor modulating severe thunderstorms. One example concerns tornadogenesis, with tornadoes most likely if the dew point depression is 20 ¬∞F (11 ¬∞C) or less, and the likelihood of large, intense tornadoes increasing as dew point depression decreases. LCL height also factors in downburst and microburst activity. Conversely, instability is increased when there is a mid-level dry layer (large dew point depression) known as a \\"dry punch\\", which is favorable for convection if the lower layer is buoyant. As it measures moisture content in the atmosphere, the dew point depression is also an important indicator in agricultural and forest meteorology, particularly in predicting wildfires.

The unit took symbolic part in the defence of Poland during the German invasion on 1 September 1939.  Background  After the Munich agreement and subsequent occupation of the Czech lands, the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was created as the quasi-autonomous territory controlled by Nazi Germany and surrounded mostly by countries well-disposed towards the Nazi regime. Those who were directly endangered by Nazis from political or racial reasons and those who wanted to fight for the recovery of Czechoslovak independence had to choose between the illegal route to emigration either via Slovak state and Hungarian kingdom (both considered as the client states of Germany) or via Poland. Poland, although taking part in the Partition of Czechoslovakia in 1938, was considered as the next target of the Nazi expansion and the most possible theater of war with Nazi Germany and was therefore the sought-after country especially for the members of military resistance who hoped in the creation of Czechoslovak armed forces similar to the Czechoslovak legions in World War I. For the Czechoslovak resistance movement abroad were the key- elements those of the ex-Czechoslovak embassies whose ambassadors and other staff did not accept the occupation of their country and refused to hand over the building to the hands of German diplomats. In the case of Poland, it was the embassy in Warsaw and the consulate in Krak√≥w where thousands of Czechoslovak civilians as well as military personnel were seeking shelter.  From the military group to the legion  Czechoslovak emigrants in Poland were roughly separated into three groups: political refugees, Jewish refugees and military personnel, the latter being the only group who wanted to stay in Poland and wait for the war to come. Lev Prchala, Czechoslovak general and former member of the autonomous government of Carpathian Ukraine, negotiated with his friends from the Polish military. However, the Polish government was reluctant to allow any military organization of Czechoslovak emigrants, so the majority, about 4,000 Czechs and Slovaks, left the Poland in six transports between 22 May and 21 August 1939 to join the French Foreign Legion. About 1,000 men stayed in Poland either by their own decision or because they arrived in Poland in late summer. The future Legion had a strength of about 700 infantry soldiers under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Ludv√≠k Svoboda and in early July it moved from Krak√≥w to an empty military camp in Bronowice Ma≈Çe. About 200 flying personnel were instead assigned to a Czechoslovak Reconnaissance Squadron. The Legion was however not fully formed by the time of German invasion of Poland (on 1 September) and it was only on 3 September 1939 when Polish president Ignacy Mo≈õcicki officially created the \\"Legion Czech√≥w i S≈Çowak√≥w\\" ‚Äî it was the first organisation of Czechoslovak resistance abroad, which was officially recognized by any allied government. General Prchala was named the commander of the Legion with Lieutenant-Colonel Svoboda as the deputy commander. With the exception of Czechoslovak airmen, the Czechoslovak soldiers were not directly involved in the fighting in Poland. The official recognition came too late and the members of the Legion got only a handful of weapons (several machineguns for counter-air defence), neither they had the uniforms. The Reconnaissance Squadron was involved in the fight in the air alongside the Polish Air Force, although primarily in the reconnaissance role, as the aircraft they received from Poland (Potez XXV, RWD-8 and PWS-26), were mostly obsolete in air combat. On 2 September, during the German bombing of the Polish airfield in Dƒôblin three airmen, 1st Lt. ≈†tƒõp√°n Kurka, Lt. Zdenƒõk Rous and Lt. Andrej ≈†andor, were killed and became the first Czechoslovak servicemen fallen in World War II. The infantry Legion was evacuated from Bronowice to the east on 12 September. The Czechoslovak transport was several times attacked by German planes. The first fallen member of Czechoslovak infantry, Sgt. V√≠tƒõzslav Gr√ºnbaum, was killed on 15 September when leading the anti-aircraft fire in the train station of H≈Çuboczek Wielki near Tarnopol. The most of the Legion under the command of Lt Col. Svoboda was eventually interned by the invading Soviets on 19 September. Others, particularly Gen. Prchala and his suite, managed to cross the Polish-Romanian border and were interned in Romania, as did also the Czechoslovak airmen who were ordered to withdraw with the remaining aircraft to Romania on 22 September.  Aftermath and significance  Although Poland did not became a theater of a successful fight for the restoration of Czechoslovakia and the official existence of the Czechoslovak Legion was only short-lived, its impact on the morale of the emerging Czechoslovak resistance in exile and its international recognition was huge. The recognition from the French government came shortly thereafter and the Czechoslovak Army in France was officially created on 2 October 1939, though the Western front saw no action for months. The core of the army in France consisted mainly of the exiled soldiers who passed the refugees centre in Krak√≥w or the camp in Bronowice. After the Czechoslovak leaders in exile reached an agreement with the Soviet government in January 1941, most of the Czechoslovak soldiers were released from Soviet internment and joined the Czechoslovak units in Middle East and Africa. Their commander Lt Col. Ludv√≠k Svoboda became member of the Czechoslovak Military Mission in USSR and after the German invasion he was commander of the 1st Czechoslovak Independent Field Battalion in USSR and later on the commander of the Czechoslovak Army Corps. On the other side, general Lev Prchala, who shortly became commander of Czechoslovak forces in Poland and successfully escaped to France via Romania, was blamed by fellow officers for abandoning his troops, got isolated, and later he became a leader of the opposition against Czechoslovak government-in-exile led by Eduard Bene≈°. Other notable members of the Legion include Richard Tesa≈ô√≠k and Otakar Jaro≈° who later received the highest Soviet decoration (Hero of the Soviet Union), or the aces of the Battle of Britain such as Josef Franti≈°ek.

When the park opened in 2007 it was the first new full-service state park in Oregon since 1972. The park includes hiking trails, mountain bike trails, horseback riding, RV and tent campsites, and cabins among other amenities. Located off Oregon Route 47 in the foothills of the Northern Oregon Coast Range, the park connects to the Banks‚ÄìVernonia State Trail. History Plans for a park in Washington County began in the late 1990s. By 2001 a master plan had been completed and the acquisition of land for the park began. Construction began in 2003 when roads were installed to the park area from Highway 47. By 2005 construction of the facilities and campgrounds had begun on the $18 million facility. The park was scheduled to open for the Memorial Day weekend in May 2007, but the opening was delayed until July 8, 2007. The working name for the park was Washington County State Park, but was later changed to Hare's Canyon State Park. In 2005, it was changed to the current name which honors the memory of lumberman and state representative Loren LaSells \\"Stub\\" Stewart, who had died in January of that year. He had served an extended time on the Oregon Parks and Recreation Commission, the co-owner of lumber company and a noted philanthropist. The park opened mountain bike-only trails in June 2012, the first in the state. Washington County Circuit Court Judge Hollie Pihl pushed for the State of Oregon to build the new state park on the plot of land it is currently on to connect it with the Banks-Vernonia State Trail he and his wife helped build. Because of his contributions, Pihl had a scenic viewpoint named in his honor called \\"Hollie's Point of View\\", a double entendra for those who knew him, as he was a very opinionated man. Features Located four miles (6 km) north of U.S. Route 26 and south of Vernonia on the east side of Oregon Route 47, Stub Stewart sits primarily on former timber land along the Banks‚ÄìVernonia State Trail. Natural features include a hill that rises from an elevation of to the level. Other natural features of Stub Stewart Park are canyons and forests. The built environment includes several vehicular bridges, a visitor center, cabins, day use areas, and horse camp. Other items include 78 camping sites that include 43 full utility hook-up sites, 23 hike in primitive campsites, 12 walk in tent sites, and 15 cabins. These cabins share a central shower and restroom building. There are two Disc Golf courses onsite. \\"Lil‚ÄôStub\\", a beginner friendly pitch and putt 9 hole course, and a full 18 hole course that has multiple pin positions. The horse camp contains 16 campsites. Fourteen horse campsites have single-RV parking and a four-stall corral. Two horse campsites have a six-stall corral and double-RV parking. There are roughly of trails at the park, many of which are for mountain bikes only. It is a prime choice for mountain bikers in the Portland metro area. It is the only full- service state park in the state's second most populous county.

In the atmosphere, assuming a constant water vapor mixing ratio, the dew point temperature (the temperature where the relative humidity is 100%) decreases with increasing height because the pressure of the atmosphere decreases with height. The CCL is determined by plotting the dew point (100%RH) verses altitude and locating the intersection with the actual measured temperature sounding. It marks where the cloud base begins when air is heated from below to the convective temperature, without mechanical lift. Once the CCL is determined, the surface temperature necessary to raise a mass of air to that height can be found by using the Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate (DALR) to determine the potential temperature. In the early morning, this temperature is typically larger than the surface temperature, in the mid-afternoon, it may be the same. Compare this to the Lifting Condensation Level (LCL) where the air is lifted and cooled without first increasing the surface temperature. The LCL is less than or equal to the CCL depending on the temperature profile. Both condensation levels indicate the altitude (or pressure) where relative humidity reaches 100%. However, since the actual condensation level depends on the availability of condensation nuclei, clouds typically do not form until the relative humidity is somewhat above 100%.

Education Drew McDermott earned B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He became a tenured full professor at Yale in 1983. He served as Chair of the Department from 1991 to 1995. He retired in 2018. Research His research has been in the area of artificial intelligence, with side excursions into philosophy. His Ph.D. dissertation was in the area of automated planning. In that work, he coined the term \\"task network\\" to refer to hierarchies of abstract and concrete actions and policies. He did seminal work in Non-monotonic logic in the early 1980s, and was an advocate for the \\"logicist\\" methodology in AI, defined as formalizing knowledge and reasoning in terms of deduction and quasideduction. In 1987 he published a paper criticizing the logicist approach. The critique was based partly on a previous paper (with Steve Hanks) pointing out a flaw with all known approaches to nonmonotonic temporal reasoning, embodied in what is now called the Yale shooting problem. Artificial intelligence Although new approaches have since been found, McDermott turned to other areas of AI, such as vision and robotics, and began working on automated planning again. His work on planning focused on the \\"classical\\" case rather than on hierarchical task network planning. In 1990 he was named a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, one of the first group of Fellows. In 1996 he (and Hector Geffner and Blai Bonet independently) discovered \\"estimated-regression planning\\", based on the idea of heuristic search with an estimator derived from a simplified domain model by reasoning backward (\\"regression\\") from the goal. The simplified version is obtained automatically from a full domain model by ignoring propositions deleted by actions. In 2000 he got interested in logic again because the development of the semantic web made it seem newly applicable. He did work on ontology translation and on semantic web services. ICAPS McDermott was a prime mover, with James Hendler and others, behind the AI Planning Systems Conference, which, after merging with the European Conference on Planning, became the annual International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS). He also helped start the International Planning Competition, which is held semiannually in conjunction with ICAPS. He led the group that molded the Planning Domain Definition Language from several predecessor notations in order to provide a standard notation for input to planning systems. A sidelight of his work has been an interest in the philosophy of mind, stemming from his realization as a child that \\"electronic brains\\" do not have a \\"part that thinks\\", and that therefore biological brains probably don't either. This interest culminated in the publication in 2001 of a book on computational models of consciousness. Personal life McDermott was married in 1975, divorced in 1997, and remarried the same year. He has two children from his first marriage. He and his second wife, Judy Nugent, have lived in New Haven, CT since 1999.

He played all or part of twelve seasons in Major League Baseball from 1881 to 1893, most often as either a shortstop or second baseman. He played for the Detroit Wolverines, Boston Red Caps (and later Beaneaters), and Washington Senators in the National League, the Baltimore Orioles in the American Association, and the Players' League Buffalo Bisons. Early life Wise was born in Akron, Ohio, to two Pennsylvania natives, Samuel Wise and the former Sarah Weary. Career Wise played semi-pro baseball in 1880 and 1881 for an Akron team organized by Charlie Morton, where his teammates included future major-league stars such as Bid McPhee and Tony Mullane. He played in a single NL game for the 1881 Detroit Wolverines. In 1882, Wise ended up signing with both the NL's Boston Red Caps and the American Association's Cincinnati Red Stockings. When the Red Stockings unsuccessfully sued the Red Caps, it marked the first American court case involving professional baseball. Playing for Boston through 1888, Wise was mostly a left-handed hitter, but he sometimes batted right-handed on a whim. He became the first 100-strikeout hitter in the major leagues in 1884, and he was often erratic on defense, especially when throwing to first base. He sustained an injury in 1886, requiring a move to first base, and he had off- and-on arm difficulties for the rest of his career. Still, he had a stellar offensive season in 1887, hitting .334. Wise spent 1889 with the Washington Nationals, but that team left the NL after the season, and most of its players went to the Buffalo Bisons of the Players' League (PL) in 1890. The PL lasted only one year and Wise was only in the major leagues until 1893. Wise concluded his playing career by spending six seasons in the minor leagues, mostly with the Eastern League's team in Buffalo; the squad was managed by Morton. After retiring as a player, Wise worked for the Diamond Tire and Rubber Company and was a businessman in Buffalo for a short time before coming home to Akron. He umpired in the Ohio‚ÄìPennsylvania League, a minor league run by Morton. Personal life In 1885 Samuel W. Wise fathered a son in Boston, MA with Irish-born Ellen McKenna. The child was named Samuel Henry Wise, but his name was revised on the birth record to John Francis Wise. John F. Wise became a Boston policeman in 1913 and participated in the 1919 Boston Police Strike. In 1887, Wise married the former Lizzie O'Neill of Utica, New York. He was known as a womanizer even after his marriage. Wise and Lizzie O'Neill had one child. Death Wise was said to have sought medical treatments for appendicitis \\"for a long time\\". In January 1910, he became so ill that physicians recommended that he come to the hospital for surgery. The procedure was described as successful, but the Akron Beacon Journal said that \\"the after effects were worse than expected.\\" Wise died at home on January 22 shortly after telling his wife that he had tried to be brave in fighting the illness.

He was a staunch ally of Imam Shamil.Daghestan - Worldstatesmen.org He promoted Sharia, spiritual purification, and facilitated a jihad against the invading Russians. He was also one of the prime supporters of \\"Muridism\\", a strict obedience to Koranic laws used by imams to increase religio-patriotic fervor in the Caucasus.Geddie 386 Early life He was a close friend of Imam Shamil during his childhood in Dagestan. They both studied the Koran and Sufism together at Yaraghal, a Murid centre, and both disliked the loose customs of the mountain people that contradicted the laws in Koran.Griffin 32 His mentor was Mullah Mohammed Yaraghi, a Naqshbandi Sufi scholar that brought the Mullah into the ulema.Akbar 151 He preached that Jihad would not occur until the Caucasians followed sharia completely rather than following a mixture of sharia and adat (customary traditions). By 1828, Mullah began proselytizing and claiming that obeying sharia, giving zakat, prayer, and hajj would not be accepted by Allah if the Russians were still present in the area. He even went on to claim that marriages would become void and children bastards if any Russians were still in the Caucasus. Qazi Mullah became one of the most prominent preachers of Islam in the Caucasus. His memorization of over four hundred ahadith allowed him to win many debates against rival preachers in the area. As his reputation grew, he was invited by many khanates and kingdoms loyal, indifferent, and hostile to the Czar.Griffin 45 As a sign of humility and austerity, he refused to ride, but would walk.  Popularity, reception, and rise  During the early to mid 19th century Russian political strategy in Dagestan included supporting local, indigenous law, known as ‚Äòadat. This was a careful and strategic investment against the growing religiosity and resistance founded on sharia law, which was championed by Ghazi Muhammad. The popularity and rise of Ghazi Muhammad has been attributed both to his charismatic personality and to an indigenous Dagestani population that had grown tired of Russian intrusion and reorganization of local land and resources. Due to conflicting local political, legal, and religious interests, the war led by Ghazi Muhammad has been characterized as a war in the name of Muslim resistance just as much as a war against Russian Imperial encroachment into the North Caucasus. While Ghazi Muhammad gained popular support for his religious policies and military tactics, he did not find widespread support among the region's other political leaders and indeed launched assaults both against local leaders who preferred to ascribe to ‚Äòadat and against the encroaching Russians. As such, support for Ghazi Muhammad was not ubiquitous in Dagestan and his rise to power resulted in unrest among local political stakeholders. Holy war (For military details see Murid War.) In 1829, he was proclaimed imam in Ghimry, where he formally made the call for a holy war. He also decreed that all wine should be destroyed publicly. In 1830, Qazi Mullah and Shamil unsuccessfully tried to capture the Avar capital of Khunzakh from the khanum Pakkou-Bekkhe. Following the setback, Shamil prevailed upon him to bide his time for a while, until all the tribes became united in following shariat law. In 1831, after a few months of quiet, he attacked Northern Dagestan, and met with success there. Muslim Resistance to the Tsar. Shamil and the Conquest of Chechnia and Daghestan - International Journal of Middle East Studies His guerilla tactics caught the Russians unprepared.

Hitchcock was the son of John Lee Hitchcock, an American Revolutionary War veteran who was lost at sea in 1811. He attended the Episcopal Academy of Cheshire, now known as Cheshire Academy, and was an apprentice to woodworker Silas Cheney. In 1818, he opened a furniture factory in Riverton, Connecticut, then called Hitchcocksville. The factory at first made chair parts. Soon Hitchcock, influenced by Connecticut clockmaker Eli Terry, began mass-producing simple, affordable chairs. Instead of painting designs on the backs, he used the relatively new and easier technique of stenciling. By the late 1820s, the Hitchcock Chair Company was producing over 15,000 chairs a year. Although an innovative manufacturer, Hitchcock was an unsuccessful businessman. His company went through receivership in 1832, with his brothers-in-law joining the business under the name Hitchcock, Alford & Co. In 1843, he sold his interest in the company and started a new company in Unionville, Connecticut, which also failed. He died in 1852 with little money to his name. In 1946, John Tarrant Kenney came upon the abandoned Hitchcock Chair factory while fishing on the Farmington River. He wrote a biography, The Hitchcock Chair, and started a new Hitchcock Chair Company in the same location. That business lasted until 2006, when it was forced to close due to competition from low-cost overseas furniture manufacturers. In the spring of 2010, Rick Swenson and his business partner, Gary Hath, purchased the Hitchcock name, plans, and artwork, and began producing chairs.

Background The trade association known as the Swiss Bankers Association was founded in 1912 in Basel, Switzerland. It is the primary industry group representing the Swiss Banks to the government of Switzerland and to the governments of other states. The unity provided by this organization allows the various Swiss Banks, from the \\"Big Two\\" (UBS and Credit Suisse) down to the smaller community and cantonal banks, to collaborate on various issues of importance to the banking community. The Swiss Bankers Association main goal is to maintain and promote the best possible framework conditions for the actors of the Swiss financial centre both at home and abroad. Firstly, it represents all banks in Switzerland (also foreign owned banks established in Switzerland) in their dealings with authorities in Switzerland and abroad. Secondly, it promotes the image of the Swiss financial centre throughout the world and fosters a dialogue with the public in Switzerland and abroad. Thirdly, the banks engage in a form of self- regulation, in conjunction with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). Under this system, the banks draw up a code of conduct in partnership with the FINMA, which is then enforced through the oversight of the FINMA. Fourthly, the banks maintain more security, both for their clients and for the world, by working together. They can more adequately protect clients identity, while they can also collaborate to aid the Swiss government in freezing the funds of criminals being investigated under the 1983 Federal Law relating to International Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. Finally, the SBA coordinates and supports the professional training of junior staff and experienced professionals in the banking industry in order to maintain the high quality of customer services. Organization The organization today has 360 institutional members (banking, securities, and auditing institutions) and approximately 16,340 individual members (high-ranking officials within the institutional members). The chief executive officer of the organization is Urs Philipp Roth, with Patrick Odier as Chairman of the Board. A questionnaire in 2014 among its members showed that 85% of the smaller and regional banks consider themselves either unrepresented or insufficiently represented by the SBV.

In 1996 he was elected as a Democrat to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. A judge of West Virginia's 30th Judicial Circuit for over 16 years, he was elected as a Democrat to a 12-year term on the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia in 1996. In 2010, Maynard switched parties and won the Republican nomination to challenge longtime Democratic U.S. Representative Nick Rahall in West Virginia's 3rd congressional district. On November 2, 2010, Maynard was defeated in his election bid in the second-closest election in Rahall's political history. Early life, education, and legal career Maynard served in the United States Air Force Reconnaissance Group from 1961 to 1966. He received his Bachelor of Science from Florida Southern College in 1967. He served as the managing director of the Tug Valley Chamber of Commerce from 1968 to 1970. Maynard attended the West Virginia University College of Law and received his J.D. in 1974. Maynard was an attorney in private practice from 1974 and 1981, and also served as the prosecuting attorney for Mingo County from 1976 to 1981.  Judicial career  Maynard was appointed a judge of the 30th Judicial Circuit in 1981. He was elected in 1981 and subsequently reelected. He served on the court until 1997. In 1996, he was elected to a 12-year term as a justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. Maynard served as an associate justice until 2000, when he became the Chief Justice for a one-year term. In 2001 Maynard returned to associate justice status. The five justices of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia rotate, with limited exceptions, the role of Chief Justice on a one-year term basis. =Massey Energy controversy= In November 2007, Maynard voted with the majority in a 3‚Äì2 decision to reverse a $76 million judgment against Massey Energy. The judgment ($55 million plus interest) had been awarded by a Boone County jury to Harman Mining, a West Virginia coal company owned by Hugh M. Caperton. After the Supreme Court reversed the judgment, Caperton's attorneys learned that Maynard had vacationed in the French Riviera with Don Blankenship, the CEO, chairman, and president of Massey Energy, and photos of the trip emerged. Bruce Stanley, a Pittsburgh lawyer representing Caperton, said \\"It is beyond the realm of human comprehension that any judge could claim any semblance of impartiality when, before casting the deciding vote in a $76 million case, he accompanies the CEO of the litigant on a luxurious trip to the French Riviera.\\" On January 19, 2008, following intense public scrutiny, Maynard disqualified himself from the Massey appeal. The acting chief justice appointed Circuit Judge Don Cookman to sit on the court for Caperton's rehearing petition. On January 23, 2008, the Court voted 5-0 to rehear Caperton's appeal. Political campaigns =2008 judicial campaign= Maynard's 12-year term expired in 2009. Maynard ran for re-election and was initially the strong favorite. However, in the May 13, 2008 primary election for two seats on the court, Maynard was defeated, coming in third behind former Supreme Court Justice Margaret Workman and Huntington trial lawyer Menis Ketchum. Maynard barely edged out a political novice and West Virginia University law professor Bob Bastress. =2010 U.S. Congressional campaign= After switching his party affiliation to Republican, Maynard officially filed candidacy papers on February 1, 2010 to run for the U.S. House in the 3rd District of West Virginia. He won the party primary with 30.1% of the vote against three other candidates. Maynard has said that his campaign \\"is about protecting the coal industry, including all the jobs associated with it.\\" Rahall defeated Maynard in the November general election.

Starring Ben Stiller, it is a remake of the 1972 film of the same name. Also starring are Michelle Monaghan, Malin √Ökerman, Jerry Stiller, Rob Corddry, Carlos Mencia, Scott Wilson and Danny McBride. The screenplay for the 2007 film was written by Leslie Dixon, Scot Armstrong, the Farrelly brothers and Kevin Barnett. Plot Eddie Cantrow (Ben Stiller), the owner of a San Francisco sports shop, is single but ambivalent about starting a relationship. While walking, he sees a thief snatching a woman's purse. He tries but fails to retrieve the purse. He and its owner Lila (Malin √Ökerman) exchange pleasantries but not numbers. Eddie finds Lila to be attractive and funny. They begin dating and shortly after, become exclusive. Suddenly a new job offer requires Lila to move to Holland. However, her company has a policy of not deploying married employees abroad. At the urging of both his father, Doc (Jerry Stiller) and best friend, Mac (Rob Corddry), Eddie marries Lila after only dating a few months. Before their wedding night, Eddie and Lila have never been sexually intimate and have not spent a lot of time getting to know each other. During the drive to their honeymoon in Cabo San Lucas, Eddie learns some new things about Lila he finds annoying, such as incessant singing. When they get to their resort room, they have sex for the first time and Eddie learns that Lila's sex drive is so wild that he suffers physical pain. Eddie's disaffection deepens when Lila divulges her history of cocaine abuse, a deviated septum, and her habit of spitting drinks out through her nose. He learns that professionally she was only a volunteer, and that the purse snatcher had been one of her former lovers that she owed money. Eddie realizes he has made a mistake in marrying Lila, and that he rushed into the marriage without really getting to know her. He is not in love with Lila and finds some of her newly discovered behavior and bad habits to be intolerable. At the Los Cabos resort run by Uncle Tito (Carlos Mencia), Lila adamantly refuses to use sunblock while sunbathing only in baby oil. She then blames Eddie for the agony of her second-degree sunburn. As the enormity of Eddie's mistake sinks in, he meets Miranda (Michelle Monaghan), a vacationer with her family from Mississippi. Eddie is immediately attracted to Miranda and finds himself spending most of his honeymoon with Miranda and her family while Lila is confined to her room due to the sunburn. Eddie meets Miranda's family and makes a favorable impression on all of them except for her cousin, Martin (Danny McBride). Martin senses that Eddie is hiding something. Eddie confides in Mac regarding his feelings about Lila and Miranda, stating that he doesn't want to be married to Lila anymore and that he has made a mistake. He tells Mac that he is falling for Miranda, whom he just met. Sometime later that same evening, there is a misunderstanding between Eddie and Miranda's family because of twin boys Eddie previously met at a wedding. The twins told Miranda's family that Eddie came to Mexico to mourn his wife who was killed by a maniac with an ice pick, something Eddie told them sarcastically. Later on, Eddie decides to divorce Lila and tries to bring it up at lunch, when Martin and his brother Buzz (Roy Jenkins) learn of his secret. When Miranda learns about Lila, she and Eddie fall into the ocean and Eddie is attacked by a jellyfish (Lila treats the stings by urinating on him). After the chaos, Lila and Miranda both abandon him (Miranda for Eddie's deception and Lila for Eddie's wish of a divorce). Angry, Lila destroys Eddie's passport. Eddie sinks into a depression and annoys a fellow Mexican named Manuel (Luis Accinelli) with his problems. Coerced by Uncle Tito, Eddie decides to go to Mississippi to make amends with Miranda. Border patrol agents repeatedly catch Eddie attempting to cross the U.S. border illegally with help from Tito. Eddie finally gets to Oxford, Mississippi. Upon meeting Miranda's family, he learns that she has married her previous boyfriend. Despite promising to leave Miranda alone, Eddie sneaks in and awakens Miranda as her husband sleeps. Her husband wakes up when Martin bursts in and attacks Eddie with a baseball bat, until Doc intervenes. Eddie agrees to leave if Miranda says she truly loves her new husband, which she does. Eddie leaves with Doc, without knowing that Miranda looks longingly from her balcony as he walks away. Eighteen months later, Eddie is divorced from Lila (while also losing his sports store to her), and he moves permanently to Mexico. Eddie runs a sporting good store in Mexico. Sometime later, Miranda arrives in Mexico and finds Eddie. She tells him that she has left her husband and wants to be with him. Eddie is thrilled, but hides that he has a new wife, Consuela (Eva Longoria). At the end of the film he finds himself in the same predicament.

Unstable areas are in yellow (slightly) and red (highly) while the stable zone is in blue. The lifted index (LI) is the temperature difference between the environment Te(p) and an air parcel lifted adiabatically Tp(p) at a given pressure height in the troposphere (lowest layer where most weather occurs) of the atmosphere, usually 500 hPa (mb). The temperature is measured in Celsius. When the value is positive, the atmosphere (at the respective height) is stable and when the value is negative, the atmosphere is unstable.  Determining LI  LI can be computed using computer algorithms but can also be determined graphically. To do this, generally, the parcel is lifted from the portion of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) that lies below the morning inversion. The air here should be about 60 to 65% RH, which is then lifted along the dry adiabat (see also adiabatic process) to the lifting condensation level (LCL), which is the intersection of that curve with the average mixing ratio in the boundary layer. Once the LCL is found, the parcel is lifted along the moist adiabat to 500 mb. It is then that one finds LI = Te(p) - Tp(p). LI is generally scaled as follows: * LI 6 or Greater, Very Stable Conditions * LI Between 1 and 6 : Stable Conditions, Thunderstorms Not Likely * LI Between 0 and -2 : Slightly Unstable, Thunderstorms Possible, With Lifting Mechanism (i.e., cold front, daytime heating, ...) * LI Between -2 and -6 : Unstable, Thunderstorms Likely, Some Severe With Lifting Mechanism * LI Less Than -6: Very Unstable, Severe Thunderstorms Likely With Lifting Mechanism  Significance to thunderstorms  The lifted index can be used in thunderstorm forecasting, however, convective available potential energy (CAPE) is considered by most as a superior measurement of instability and is preferred by many meteorologists for convection forecasting. However, LI is easier and faster to determine without using a computer, as determining CAPE requires integration from one level to another.

DGPS Reference Station A choke ring antenna is a particular form of omnidirectional antenna for use at high frequencies. It consists of a number of conductive concentric cylinders around a central antenna. Due to its delicate construction, it is often enclosed in a protective cover or radome when placed outside and exposed to the elements. Choke ring antennas are notable for their ability to reject multipath signals from a source. Since the path that a signal takes from a transmitter to receiver can be used to measure the distance between the two, this makes it highly suited for GPS and radar applications.

Ireland by contrast endured one of their worst championships of the period, losing all three games and failing to score. Scotland too underperformed, although their two losses were both hard-fought. Scotland had kicked off the competition with an easy victory over Ireland in the first match. England and Wales by contrast split the points, failing to breach a 1‚Äì1 draw at Ninian Park. England exerted their authority over the Irish in their second game with a simple win, whilst Wales performed the impressive feat of beating Scotland on their home turf with a hard-won 1‚Äì0 success. The final games were tensely contested, as Wales, hoping for an England failure at Hampden Park in their final game took the play to the Irish and ran out 3‚Äì0 winners. In Glasgow between England and Scotland, the tournament was decided by two Stan Pearson goals which gave England the victory and their half of the trophy.

If non caseating granulomas are found (4‚Äì6 weeks later), the test is positive. If the patient has been on treatment (e.g. glucocorticoids), the test may be false negative. The test is not commonly performed, and in the UK no substrate has been available since 1996. There is a concern that certain infections, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, could be transferred through a Kveim test. It is named for the Norwegian pathologist Morten Ansgar Kveim, who first reported the test in 1941 using lymph node tissue from sarcoidosis patients. It was popularised by the American physician Louis Siltzbach, who introduced a modified form using spleen tissue in 1954. Kveim's work was a refinement of earlier studies performed by Nickerson, who in 1935 first reported on skin reactions in sarcoid.

These tests use the patient's antigen- antibody immune response. This response occurs when the body detects a pathogen and forms an antibody specific to an identified antigen (a protein configuration) present on the surface of the pathogen. Agglutination tests, specific to a variety of pathogens, can be designed and manufactured for clinicians by coating microbeads of latex with pathogen-specific antigens or antibodies. In performing a test, laboratory clinicians will mix a patient's cerebrospinal fluid, serum or urine with the coated latex particles in serial dilutions with normal saline (important to avoid the prozone effect) and observe for agglutination (clumping). Agglutination of the beads in any of the dilutions is considered a positive result, confirming either that the patient's body has produced the pathogen-specific antibody (if the test supplied the antigen) or that the specimen contains the pathogen's antigen (if the test supplied the antibody). Instances of cross-reactivity (where the antibody sticks to another antigen besides the antigen of interest) can lead to confusing results. Agglutination techniques are used to detect antibodies produced in response to a variety of viruses and bacteria, as well as autoantibodies, which are produced against the self in autoimmune diseasees. For example, assays exist for rubella virus, rotavirus, and rheumatoid factor, and an excellent LA test is available for cryptococcus.Howanitz and Howanitz, Laboratory Medicine.

Early life and military career John Hamilton was born in England in 1919 and was educated at Bradfield College. Throughout World War II, he served in the British Army in India as a member of the Queen‚Äôs Royal Regiment. As a junior officer at the age of 24, he received the Military Cross for gallantry during active operations against the enemy. Following his army service, he began a business career and settled in 1961 on the island of Tresco in the Isles of Scilly, Cornwall, where he sketched and painted for relaxation. In 1972, after a bout with angina, he sold his business and began painting on a full-time basis. Career as an artist He began by selling his work to tourists, who visited the Isles of Scilly in the English Channel, specializing at first in painting the local topography, seascapes, traditional ships, and boats. Increasingly interested in the naval battles of World War II, in 1972 he began to paint a series of historical paintings on the War in the Atlantic, undertaking extensive archival research in London, Washington, and Stuttgart, and interviewing survivors. After seven years of work, he completed this 84-painting series at the end of 1978. Through the generosity of several shipping companies and the HMS Belfast Trust, his series of paintings is now in the collection of the Imperial War Museum, London, on board the museum ship . On the completion of the Atlantic series, Hamilton started work on a new series of paintings on the War in the Pacific, widening his archival researches and interviewing to Canberra and Tokyo with extensive research work at the Naval Historical Center in Washington, D.C. With the help of foundations in Texas, Hamilton completed more than 120 paintings in five years. This collection is now part of the U.S. Navy Art Collection. 176 of the total 204 paintings in the two series were published in Hamilton‚Äôs book War at Sea, 1939‚Äì1945. After completing his work on World War II, Hamilton turned to the more recent Falklands War and a study of the uses of the helicopter during that conflict. This project required three visits to the Falkland Islands and four years to produce 46 paintings. In his 70s, he developed an interest in the Antarctic and spent two winters there on board , painting the scenery and doing historical paintings of Sir Ernest Shackleton‚Äôs expedition using the evidence of surviving buildings, in addition to research, to recreate historical scenes. In this work, he became a key figure in inspiring the organisation of the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust.

Known as Bishopville Road, the state highway runs from the county-maintained portion of Bishopville Road at Bishop east to the Delaware state line near Bishopville. MD 367 connects U.S. Route 113 (US 113) with Bishopville and other small communities on the St. Martin Neck in northern Worcester County. The state highway was constructed between Bishop and Bishopville in two steps in the mid-1920s and early 1930s, respectively. The segment within Bishopville was constructed as part of an extended MD 368 in the mid-1910s. The portion from Bishopville to the Delaware state line was constructed in the mid-1930s as MD 568. All three state highways were reassigned to their present lengths in 1950. Route description View east along MD 367 at US 113 in Bishop MD 367 begins on the east side of the Snow Hill Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad in the hamlet of Bishop. Bishopville Road continues west of the railroad track as a county highway. MD 367 intersects US 113 (Worcester Highway), then continues east as a two-lane undivided road toward Bishopville. After crossing Buntings Branch of the St. Martin River, the state highway enters Bishopville and intersects MD 368 (St. Martins Neck Road) and MD 568 (Hatchery Road). MD 367 reaches its eastern terminus at the Delaware state line, where the highway continues northeast as Hudson Road in Sussex County, which leads to an intersection with Delaware Route 54 (DE 54). History The first part of MD 367 to be paved was between present day MD 368 and MD 568 in Bishopville. That segment, plus the present lengths of MD 368 and MD 568, were paved as a state-aid road between 1912 and 1915 and later designated MD 368. The next segment of modern MD 367 was between the western terminus and just west of Buntings Branch, which was completed by 1923. The connection over Buntings Branch to MD 368 was finished by 1933. The remainder of Bishopville Road to the Delaware state line was completed in 1934 and designated MD 568. MD 367 was extended east from MD 368 to the Delaware state line in 1950 when MD 368 was rolled back to its present length and MD 568 was reassigned to Hatchery Road.

The series began with the release of Arc the Lad in 1995. Arc the Lad uses a tactical role-playing battle system, which all games except Arc the Lad: End of Darkness, follow. Each of the games feature recurring characters and locations. Though the series enjoyed huge success in Japan, leading to an anime adaptation of Arc the Lad II in 1999, alongside several manga and a novelization, Western sales are low due to the obscurity of the series. The first three Arc the Lad games were not released outside of Japan until the Arc the Lad Collection was released by Working Designs in 2002, which was followed by Twilight of the Spirits in 2003 and End of Darkness in 2005. Games Arc the Lad was developed by G-Craft and published by SCEI in Japan on June 30, 1995. The game features tactical role-playing game battle elements, which would become a staple for the series. Arc the Lad introduces several characters that appear in all three games in the collection. Arc, the lead, is a boy from the small town of Touvil who is fated to fight corruption. Characters like Kukuru, Iga, Poco, Tosh, and Chongara also make future appearances. Arc the Lad II, developed by ARC Entertainment and published by SCEI, was released in Japan on November 1, 1996, and was re-released twice. This game continues to use the tactical battles, featuring much more complex statistics than its predecessor, a more interactive world map and a longer game length. A new feature are the guilds, which allow the player to take jobs as side quests. The characters of Arc the Lad reappear alongside new ones. Elc, a young hunter, joins the fight against the corrupt government. He and his fellow hunter Shu meet up with several other characters involved in the mess, including Arc and his friends, and bring Andel and his followers down. Arc the Lad: Monster Game with Casino Game, developed by ARC Entertainment and published by SCEI, was released in Japan on July 31, 1997, and was re-released twice, first as part of Arc the Lad Collection (where it was known as Arc Arena: Monster Tournament), and again when it was released on the Japanese PlayStation Store as a PSone Classic on December 12, 2007. Arc the Lad III, the final Arc game for the PlayStation, was released on October 28, 1999. It was the only game in the collection to feature two discs. Similarly to the first two, this Arc game uses tactical battles and basic RPG elements. The explorable maps of Arc II return. However, unlike the first two, the game is strictly job-driven; the story only progresses as the player takes and completes jobs from the guilds. This game introduces Alec and Lutz, two small-town boys looking to become great Hunters and who battle a new, corrupt entity known as the Academy. Characters from previous games make cameo appearances and occasionally fight alongside Alec. In the US, Working Designs published Arc the Lad I, II, III and Monster Tournament as part of a compilation of Arc games (Arc the Lad Collection) on April 18, 2002 in North America. The collection as a whole received mainly positive reception. Arc the Lad: Kijin Fukkatsu ( is a Wonderswan Color game developed by Bandai and released in 2002 in Japan. Set after the main series, this game features similar combat and gameplay to the previous installments. Elc, from Arc the Lad II, returns as the main character as he discovers a girl sent from the past to his time because of a hostile robot takeover. Finia, the girl, Elc, and several of his friends return once again to save humanity. Arc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits was the first PlayStation 2 game in the Arc series. It was developed by Cattle Call, published by SCEI and was released in Japan on March 20, 2003 and in North America on June 25 of the same year by SCEA. This was also the only Arc game to date to come out in Europe, released by SCEE the following year. Set 1,000 years after Arc the Lad 3, Twilight of the Spirits follows a pair of twins named Kharg and Darc who set out on a journey to collect five magical stones for their own ambitions, all while trying to take down a corrupt empire who longs for those very same stones and a mysterious girl. The battle system in this installment allows characters to move freely in circular ranges across fields during their turns as opposed to the grid-based fields of its predecessors. Arc the Lad: End of Darkness is the second Arc game to be released on the PS2. Developed by Cattle Call and published by SCEI, the game was released in Japan on November 3, 2004. Namco then published the game for its North American release. Taking place five years after Twilight of the Spirits, End of Darkness follows an exorcist named Edda who becomes a hunter and has to defeat a group of monsters called Malademons, who can only be destroyed with his exorcist powers. This game does not follow the tactical style of the previous games, instead using action RPG combat. is the latest Arc game, released on August 25, 2018 for iOS and Android. Developed by ForwardWorks, Arc the Lad R takes place 10 years after the events of Arc the Lad II and retcons the series past Arc 3. The game follows two protagonists named Haruto and Mizuha, who attempt to stop the Divine Beasts, monsters which threaten the world as they currently try to rebuild from the events of the Great Disaster caused during the ending of Arc the Lad II. Development When the Arc games were originally released in Japan years before a North American release, SCEA hardly considered bringing them to the U.S., thinking that the role-playing video game market was not an important one. Working Designs, then known in the U.S. for publishing RPGs, actually tried to license Arc the Lad, but Sony of America turned them down. Years later, SCEA came under new management, and with the popularity of other RPGs like Final Fantasy VII, Working Designs was able to publish all three games at once with the Japanese release of Arc the Lad III. Arc the Lad Collection was released in 2002 and boasted four separate gamesArc the Lad I, II, III and Monster Arena, a side-game that allows players to take captured monsters from Arc the Lad II and use them in combat. The collection also featured a making-of CD, DualShock controller thumb pads, a memory card holder, character standees, a hardcover instruction booklet, and a glossy box (omake box) to hold it all. Reception Each of the Arc games has received decent reception. Arc the Lad Collection has an 80.77% on GameRankings. The compilation is often praised for its ambitious packaging and game content, which could last over 150 hours. When the collection was released, the first two games' graphics seemed a bit outdated, although some critics find the graphics acceptable. Critics mostly agree that the take on tactical battles was refreshing because the battles are generally fast-paced. Although the first game in the series is much shorter than the other two, it is believed to be only a prologue to the second game. Arc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits received similar reviews. It has a 75% on GameRankings.com. Arc the Lad: End of Darkness, the second Arc game for the PS2, is generally rated much lower than the other games, receiving a 57% on GameRankings.com. Anime The Arc the Lad anime adaptation was produced by Bee Train and directed by Itsuro Kawasaki. The series ran on Japan's WOWOW satellite network for 26 episodes from April 5, 1999, to October 11, 1999 as part of the Anime Complex omnibus series. A North American release was produced by ADV Films and aired on the Anime Network. =Plot= The story follows the story of Arc the Lad II, the second game in the video game series. The world is also similar to the game, full of technology, but with magic and beasts as well. An evil corporation secretly controls this world and produces powerful monstrous (sometimes human) creations called chimera. Elc gets caught up in this mess when he rescues a young female beast tamer from the corporation. Her name is Lieza. Together with Shu and the rest of their companions, they fight to save a corrupt world. =Episode list= =Music= The opening theme for the anime series was Arc the Lad Main Theme by Masahiro Andoh. Two ending themes were sung by NiNa: Happy Tomorrow (episodes 01-12, 26) and Rest in Peace (episodes 13-26).

Driven by the objectives of the NSW Cancer Plan, the Institute works to: * reduce the incidence of cancer in the community * increase the survival rate for cancer patients * improve the quality of life of cancer patients and their carers * provide a source of expertise on cancer control for the government, health service providers, medical researchers and the general community. To achieve this, the Institute engages with the community, health professionals, researchers, governments and charity organisations to: * provide information, resources and advice about preventing cancer * promote the importance of early detection through cancer screening programs * provide grants that build research capacity, foster innovation and encourage translation of cancer research into practice * maintain quality information sources about cancer in NSW to inform future policy and health planning * establish partnerships with cancer healthcare professionals to develop and evaluate programs that improve the quality of cancer treatment and care in NSW. Cancer Plans The New South Wales (NSW) Cancer Plan sets out a coordinated and collaborative approach to cancer control. Launched July 2016, it is the fourth cancer plan for NSW and builds on the success of previous plans, with the aim of lessening the burden of cancer in NSW. The current NSW Cancer Plan is a blueprint for everyone involved in cancer control to collaborate and innovate into the future. By 2021, 53,000 people in NSW will face a diagnosis of cancer every year. A comprehensive and collaborative approach to cancer control is essential to meet the needs of those affected by the disease, and their carers. There are 3 key goals in the Plan: * Reduce cancer incidence * Improve survival * Improve the quality of life for people affected by cancer. The NSW Cancer Plan has a particular focus on Aboriginal communities and culturally and linguistically diverse communities, recognising the poorer cancer outcomes that many people in these communities experience. The plan provides an additional focus on lung, bowel and primary liver cancer, due to the considerable impact they have on the community and the potential to make substantial improvements to cancer outcomes. The impact of the NSW Cancer Plan will be measured by a cycle of annual public reporting by the Cancer Institute NSW. This information will be used to continually improve the performance of cancer services and programs in the State.

Even if the employee never assigned rights to the firm, a court of law may find that the firm has the right to make use of the invention, and thus can not be sued by the employee for patent infringement. This will allow the firm to attempt to capitalize on the value of the patent, as the firm is allowed to use the object of the patent in the routine operation of its business without royalty payments. Shop right is non- transferable. It only inures to the benefit of the employer and can not be sold by that employer to an unrelated party, except in a sale of the business as a whole. In circumstances where a written agreement is not in place between employer and employee, the employee may hold title to the intellectual property rights as an inventor. In these circumstances, a shop right may apply. The shop right is a common law doctrine founded in equitable principles that allows an employer to use the employee's invention without payment to the employee if that invention was made using the employer's time, materials, facilities, or equipment. Unfortunately for employers, shop rights being an equitable right are non-transferable, so an employer holding shop rights may not transfer those rights via license or assignment, such as, for example, if the employer were to be purchased or acquired at some later date. Accordingly, this makes having only shop rights an undesirable position for most employers. However, compare this to the Hired-to-Invent Doctrine which is a state-law specific doctrine that may provide chain of title to the employer. In instances where there is no written agreement between employer and employee as to patent rights, the \\"hired to invent\\" doctrine may save an otherwise unprepared employer. Of course, absent an assignment, employment agreement, or other written document, the employee presumptively owns any inventions, even those developed during the course of employment. This rule comes as a surprise to many business owners and even some attorneys. The \\"hired to invent\\" doctrine is embedded in contract law, so state law applies when adjudicating the \\"hired to invent\\" doctrine.

The dance was originally performed by only a few men. However, over time it has grown in scale. In today's version of the Khorumi, thirty or forty dancers can participate. The dance was inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia list in 2013. Although the number of performers changed, the content of the dance is still the same. The dance brings to life the Georgian army of the past centuries. A few men who are searching the area for a campsite and enemy camps perform the initial \\"prelude\\" to the dance. Afterwards, they call the army onto the battlefield. The exit of the army is quite breathtaking. Its strength, simple but distinctive movements and the precision of lines create a sense of awe on stage. The dance incorporates in itself the themes of search, war, and the celebration of victory as well as courage and glory of Georgian soldiers. Since Georgia has seen many wars throughout its history, Khorumi is a call from the past and reminds us that in order to have peace, we must be ready for war. Musical features Unlike the bulk of Georgian traditional dances, which are usually accompanied by choral polyphonic singing and clapping, Khorumi is traditionally accompanied by instruments, and is not accompanied by clapping.

Liu earned his PhD in civil engineering from Colorado State University with research on fluid mechanics, and then worked as a professor of civil engineering at University of Missouri (MU) in Columbia, Missouri for over 20 years. At MU, he was also director of the Capsule Pipeline Research Center, a joint state/industry initiative funded by the National Science Foundation to develop capsule pipeline technology to transport freight; an innovative application of pipelines to transfer solids instead of fluids. In 2001, after his retirement, Liu founded FPC, the company which developed a new type of Fly ash brick, a building brick made from a waste by-product of coal power plants, using an environmentally sustainable manufacturing process. Liu had spent most of his working career compressing industrial freight using hydraulic presses. In 1999, he was given some fly ash by a client, and decided to compress it \\"just to see what would come out.\\" Liu mixed the fly ash with water and applied 4,000 psi (28 MPa) of pressure. After two weeks, he found that the mixture had set into blocks with the strength of concrete. Owing to the high concentration of calcium oxide in fly ash, the bricks can be described as \\"self-cementing\\". Liu used a National Science Foundation grant of $600,000 to perfect the manufacturing technique over an eight-year period, National Science Foundation, Press Release 07-058, \\"Follow the 'Green' Brick Road?\\", May 22, 2007 discovering that by adding an air entrainment agent, which generates microscopic bubbles in the hardened brick that better accommodate the expansion of freezing water, he was able to produce a brick which could withstand over 100 freeze-thaw cycles, thereby comfortably meeting US federal safety standards. Since the manufacturing method uses a waste by-product rather than clay, and solidification takes place under pressure rather than heat, it offers has several environmental benefits. It saves energy, reduces mercury pollution, alleviates the need for landfill disposal of fly ash, and costs 20% less than traditional methods.

Isolates have been collected in North and Central America, Asia, Europe and Egypt. A. strictum is an agent of hyalohyphomycosis and has been identified as an increasingly frequent human pathogen in immunosuppressed individuals, causing localized, disseminated and invasive infections. Although extremely rare, A. strictum can infect immunocompetent individuals, as well as neonates. Due to the growing number of infections caused by A. strictum in the past few years, the need for new medical techniques in the identification of the fungus as well as for the treatment of human infections has risen considerably. A. strictum has been shown to be involved in some myoparasitic relationships, as well as a wide range of plant endophytic and parasitic relationships, and further studies are required to determine A. strictum's use as a biological control agent and role as a parasite that reduces crop yields. A. strictum exhibits metabolism of many products that imply future agricultural and pharmaceutical significance. General description The genus Acremonium is a large polyphyletic genus of approximately 150 species, many of which are derived from a closely related families in the Sordariomycetes. The genus includes many slow growing, simply structured, anamorphic filamentous fungi, typically encountered in wet, cellulose-based building materials suffering form chronic wet conditions. Characteristic morphology in this genus is septate hyphae giving rise to thin, tapered aculeate phialides that are usually unicellular, or weakly branched conidiophores. Human infections, though rare, usually occur in severely immunodeficient individuals. A. strictum is mostly known to be involved with myparasitic relationships, as well as being a plant parasite and endophyte. =Morphological identification= Colonial appearance Acremonium strictum grows readily at 30 ¬∞C on glucose peptone agar, showing mycelium of approximately 50mm in size in 7 days. Colonies are flat, with smooth, wet, velvety or floccose texture, sometimes resembling thin cottony mounds. The colour of mycelia ranges widely from light pink to orange, and sometimes yellow, white or green. A. strictum filaments are sometimes bound together into ropes several cells in diameter. Conidia grow as wet clusters or dry chains, and grains produced are white to pale-yellow, soft and variable in shape. Subcultures of the fungus can also be grow within seven days into smooth, moist, pink mycelia that resemble thin cotton. Microscopic appearance Conidia and conidiophores of the fungus Acremonium falciforme PHIL 4168 lores Under the microscope at 30 ¬∞C, A. strictum shows long slender phialides, and conidia are cylindrical or ellipsoidal, formed in slimy bundles at the tips of the phialides. Lower microscopy shows pin-head spore ball formation. Species of Acremonium are morphologically very similar, making identification difficult. Shown in the image is a microscopic image of A. falciforme, an example showing the morphological similarities to A. strictum. Cases involving different species of Acremonium are often reported as simply as an Acremonium species, which reduces the amount of accurate information on the clinical presentation of A. strictum. Isolates of phylogenetically remote species of Acremonium show considerable convergence. As a human pathogen, diagnosis is made in isolation and identification of the fungus from granules in tissue and the presence of hyphae in microscopic examination of cutaneous biopsy and discharge. Genera that are morphologically similar to Acremonium include Fusarium, Phaeoacremonium, Verticillium, Phialemonium, and Lecanicillium. =Genetic identification= Identification of A. strictum isolates has shown that this fungus is phenotypically diverse and may vary genetically. Due to phylogenetic ambiguities, an unknown proportion of the literature on A. strictum is based on studies of Acremonium sclerotigenum. The fungus can generally be successfully identified by the nuclear ITS region sequence analysis. Analysis of the genes for ribosomal large subunit (LSU) and whole small subunit (SSU) also help to elucidate phylogenetic relationships, since these genes are more conserved and less subject to evolutionary changes. The species A. strictum is separated into three genogroups. Genogroup I is represented by type strain CBS 346.70, genogroup II by UW836 and genogroup III by UWFP940. These genogroups were determined based on GenBank entries for A. strictum. Pathophysiology Human infections of Acremonium strictum are very rare, and usually develop after traumatic inoculation of the fungus. Hyalophomycosis may occur in immunodeficient individuals, presented in the infected tissue by hyaline or colourless hyphae. Peritonitis and pleuritis have resulted from A. strictum infections, but cutaneous and subcutaneous infections of A. strictum are rarely reported. * Most human infections have been reported to occur in immunocompromised patients and have been presented as localized or disseminated, fungemia, mycetoma or ocular infections, and often result in fatal cases. A. strictum may result in invasive infections such as pneumonia, arthritis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, meningitis and sepsis in immunodeficient patients. * Infections in immunocompetent individuals usually follows inoculation during penetration of the extremities and cornea, resulting in localized infections. The fungus can also cause onychomycosis, ontomycosis and burn wound infection in immunocompetent individuals. Patients with prosthetic valves who are infected with A. strictum in the region of the valve may suffer from severe inflammation, resulting in sepsis and multi-organ failure. * Infections in neonates, although rare, can occur and be fatal. Many environmental factors such as the density of fungi in soil, rainfall, temperature, humidity and types of vegetation in close contact are relevant in determining the likelihood of acquiring hyalohypjomycosis infection by A. strictum. Frequent exposure to contaminated water along with high temperature and humid environments increases the risk of infection. Clinical presentation and treatments Clinical presentation of an infection is ill-defined, but most individuals may present a skin rash and flu like symptoms, such as elevated body temperature and fatigue. In more severe infections, such as in immunodeficient individuals, peritonitis and pleuritis, and may lead to multi-organ failure. In the case of invasive infections, surgical intervention may be required to remove fungal mass from body tissues. Due to limited, ill-defined cases and the variance in clinical presentation and species identification, no optimal treatments are available. A. strictum and other Acremonium species are generally resistant to most antifungals, but antifungal susceptibility testing is recommended to select the most appropriate treatment for the strain of A. strictum that is the infection agent. Amphotericin B therapy coupled with ketoconazole is usually recommended as the best available treatment. =Biological control= It has been shown that seedlings infected with A. strictum have high mortality rates. It would be agriculturally significant to identify biological control agents for this fungus. Aerial parts of Cymbopogon schoenanthus, Hyptis spicigera, Lantana camara and Ocimum americanum were collected and air-dried for four days. After drying the plants, essential oils were extracted from the materials. A variety of seeds inoculated with fungi, some cohorts with A. strictum. The oils were applied to the infected seeds. After allowing seedlings to develop, it was found that the oils in combination inhibited A. strictum mycelial growth significantly. Fungal interactions =Helminthosporium solani= Acremonium strictum is generally known as a mycoparasite, as shown in its antagonistic relationship with Helminthosporium solani. H. solani is a potato (Solanum tuberosum) associated fungus, that has caused extreme and widespread losses in all market classes of potatoes since emerging in the United States. Commonly referred to as silver scurf, H. solani causes blemishes that decreases the quality of the crop, making it unfit for marketing. In more severe cases, H. solani causes weight loss in potatoes and creates lesions in the periderm, creating entry points for other tuber pathogens. In pure cultures of H. solani, isolates show white sectoring and rings, differential coloration and reduced sporulation in culture. Upon infection of A. strictum, cultures of H. solani were uniformly black, without white sectors or rings. A. strictum was able to significantly reduce sporulation of H. solani by 30%, spore germination by 20%, and mycelial growth 8% in culture. This evidence suggests that A. strictum may be used as a biological control agent against H. solani, which would greatly increase potato crop yields. Plant interactions =Stalk rot= Acremonium strictum is pathogenic to many monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops, causing leaf desiccation on one side of the midrib of these plants, plant wilt and abnormal, discoloured vasculature of the stalk near the soil line. Vasculature of the plant forms orange, red and brown bundles, usually resulting in death. Infection of A. strictum is systemic, and the fungus can be isolated from all tissues of the plant. Isolates have been found in plant seeds, which is probably the route of dissemination of the fungus. Crops affected by A. strictum include Acacia, Alnus, Ficus, Glycine, Gossypium, Triticum and Zea. Because of its ubiquitous presence in soils, A. strictum negatively impacts many agricultural plants, although more research is needed to investigate the parasitic interactions and develop strategies for its biological control. =Root knot nematode= Meloidogyne incognita is a polyphagous nematode that severely damages tomato crops by causing lesions in the roots by using a stylet, which allows other soil-dwelling fungal parasites to infect the host plant and cause complex disease interactions. A. strictum is reported to be a nematode egg parasite, as the eggs of M. incognita infested plants were found to be empty under A. strictum treatment. This treatment of A. strictum coupled with Trichoderma harzianum was found to be a very promising combination in the control of M. incognita in tomato plants. =Fragaria ananassa= It demonstrates a complicated relationship with strawberry host Fragaria ananassa, in which the fungus may cause lesions and small necrotic, light-brown spots in leaves and petioles which increase as the disease progresses, adversely affecting strawberry crop. Eventually the necrotic regions expand and cause the plant to wilt, but crown rot is not observed at any stage of the infection. Although it appears to have a parasitic relationship with Fragaria ananassa, it also produces an elicitor protein, AsES, which provides systemic protection against anthracnose disease in strawberry host Fragaria ananassa, which shows a symbiotic relationship between the strawberry plant and Acremonium strictum. =Atractylodes lancea= Atractylodes lancea is a medicinal herb that grows in central China. A. strictum acts as a fungal endophyte and interacts with A. lancea in drought conditions and confers tolerance in moderate drought. Under mild drought conditions, A. strictum enhanced leaf soluble sugars, proteins, proline and antioxidant enzyme activity, which decreased the degree of plasmalemma oxidation. This increased A. lancea abscisic acid level and root:shoot ratio. While A. strictum may alleviate the effects of a mild to moderate drought, benefits of this endophytic relationship are constrained by drought degree, as there were no significant effects of A. strictum on A. lancea during periods of regular watering or severe drought. =Maclura cochinchinensis= In Maclura cochinchinensis, Acremonium strictum acts as an endophytic fungi that infects primarily the leaves of the plant. In this relationship, A. strictum was found to provide and mediate a protective response against herbivorous insects. Natural metabolites =Acremostrictin= Acremostrictin can be isolated from certain strains of A. strictum and is characterized as a highly oxygenated, tricyclic lactone metabolite. This compound exhibits weak antibacterial properties against the bacterium Micrococcus luteus, Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus vulgaris. However, it had no effect on Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Acremostrictin has been shown to have concentration- dependent antioxidant activity, which conferred protection against oxidative stress induced cell death. Acremostrictin was shown to inhibit H2O2-induced death of human keratinocyte HaCaT cells. When extracted and isolated by filtration, acremostrictin presents as a colorless crystal solid. =AsES= AsES (A. strictum elicitor subtilisin; ) protein is an extracellular elicitor protein produced by A. strictum that provides complete systemic protection against anthracnose, cause by the fungal species Colletotrichum, in the natural host Fragaria ananassa as well as the non-natural host Arabidopsis thaliana. Anthracnose can affect all plant tissues, and appears as irregular and black leaf spot, flower blight, and fruit and crown rot, which results in serious losses in plant and fruit production. AsES has proteolytic activity that appears to elicit an immune response in these species that results in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and the expression of defence related genes like PR1 and Chi2-1. Because it has been shown to provide the same systemic protection in non-natural hosts, this natural metabolite of A. strictum may be considered as a possible strategy for controlling anthracnose disease in plants. =Cephalosporins= A. strictum produces some types of cephalosporins a group of antibiotics. Industrial Uses =BMOs= Biogenic Mn oxides (BMOs) are naturally occurring Mn oxides that have the ability to oxidize various redox-sensitive elements. A. strictum is a Mn(II)-oxidizing fungus that forms BMOs through the action of Mn(II) oxidase. In the presence of BMOs in buffer solutions with no additional nutrients, A. strictum is capable of sequestering high Mn(II) concentrations for at least 8 days, in which the amount of dissolved Mn(II) decreases rapidly in several hours and is converted to oxidized Mn(II). Deaeration of the buffer solution with N2 gas purging suppressed Mn(II) conversion, but this suppression is easily rescued by aeration, implying that dissolved oxygen is required for the Mn(II) sequestration and oxidation process. Adding NaN3, a toxic substance, also significantly reduces the sequestration rates of the fungal BMOs. Heat treatments revealed that temperatures below 85 ¬∞C do not alter the conformation of the Mn(II) oxidase in the BMOs. Freezing the fungal BMOs at -80 ¬∞C for 4 weeks did not affect the Mn(II) ability, and the reducible Mn was still dominated in solution. This makes fungal BMOs an effective Mn(II) sequestering material if needed. For example, it can be used for the continuous removal of Mn(II) from Mn(II) contaminated water without the need for any additives other than dissolved oxygen. The product is an oxide phase Mn(II) that would provide additional affinity for other toxic elements and thus prove as an effective method of water cleansing. Enzymatically active fungal BMOs can be harvested under specific cultivation conditions and remain active even under circumstances that would be unfavourable for fungal growth. =Ginsenoside analogs= Fermentation of ginsenoside Rb(1) with A. strictum yields three new compounds ‚Äî 12Œ≤-hydroxydammar-3-one-20 (S)-O-Œ≤-D- glucopyranoside, 12Œ≤, 25-dihydroxydammar-(E)-20(22)-ene-3-O-Œ≤-D -glucopyranosyl-(1‚Üí2)-Œ≤-D -glucopyranoside, and 12Œ≤, 20 (R), 25-trihydroxydammar-3-O-Œ≤-D -glucopyranosyl-(1‚Üí2)-Œ≤-D -glucopyranoside ‚Äî as well as five known compounds ‚Äî ginsenoside Rd, gypenoside XVII, ginsenoside Rg, ginsenoside F, and compound K. Many of these compounds are metabolites of ginsenoside Rb(1) in mammals, suggesting that fermentation of ginsenoside Rb(1) in A. strictum may be similar to mammalian metabolism and may be a useful agent for generating specific metabolites or related ginsenoside analogs, which can be later isolated for structural elucidation and use in pharmaceutical research.

Performing a series of Shakespeare classics and introducing more contemporary works, audience members take their seats on the beach overlooking the lake.  History  The Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival began in 1972 at Sugar Pine Point State Park on the west shore of Lake Tahoe. The New Shakespeare Company presented eight performances during its inaugural season. The Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival continued there for four years, until it ran into scheduling conflicts over the use of Sugar Pine Point's Ehrman Mansion. In 1976, the company and Nevada State Parks agreed to hold the performances at Sand Harbor - even though it was considered to be a less accessible location. A bare-bones stage was hastily built for just over $1,000 in materials and labor. In 1976, the first year at Sand Harbor State Park. At first, the Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival was managed by the staff of Lake Tahoe Nevada State Park. In 1982, the North Tahoe Fine Arts Council (NTFAC) began \\"Tunes in the Dunes\\" and took over the management of the Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival. The Festival prospered under the direction of NTFAC and became a cultural tradition at the park. Each year, more and more people made the trip to enjoy a picnic and a play under the stars at Sand Harbor. But in 1992, the North Tahoe Fine Arts Council folded and a new manager for the Festival was needed. The Incline Village Crystal Bay Visitors and Convention Bureau was selected to manage the Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival. In 1995, a long-term contract was signed with the Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival, a non- profit group dedicated to managing and improving the performances at Sand Harbor. As part of the agreement, the LTSF, completely through private funding, constructed a state of the art stage facility. The Warren Edward Trepp Stage, built at a cost of nearly two million dollars, was dedicated at the start of the 2000 season. In May 1999, the Parasol Foundation, a non- profit community foundation, was awarded a grant from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation through the Community Services Center Program. The Community Services Program is designed to help privately supported, non-profit organizations with 501 C (3) status, join together to house their operations in a shared facility. In 2010 the Festival hired artistic director Charles Fee to improve flagging attendance and sponsorship shortfalls due to \\"economic woes\\".2010 Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival gets $75K boost, event begins in two weeks Lake Tahoe Bonanza, 27 June 2010 Fee is now the producing artistic director for three Shakespeare festivals concurrently, including Great Lakes Theater Festival in Cleveland, Ohio and Idaho Shakespeare Festival in Boise, ID.  Educational outreach program  =The D.G. Menchetti Young Shakespeare Program= The Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival offers twelve free matinee performances throughout the Reno-Tahoe-Truckee region during the summer, specifically written and directed for a younger audience. The abbreviated performances offer an introduction to theatre for children. =InterACT workshops= Offered to schools and community groups in Nevada and California from February to September, these workshops are highly interactive and feature activities to help students understand the themes of Shakespeare's works, as well as to learn acting and performance skills.  Other performances  For the last few years the Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival has included more than Shakespeare performances to the Sand Harbor Amphitheatre to entertain residents and visitors to the Reno-Lake Tahoe region, including performances by the Reno Philharmonic Orchestra, Chautauqua, Reno Jazz Orchestra, Pacific Mambo Orchestra and the Sierra Nevada Ballet.

The book contains a self-assessed personality questionnaire, known as the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, which links human behavioral patterns to four temperament types and sixteen character types. Once the reader's personality type has been ascertained, there are detailed profiles which describe the characteristics of that type. Based upon the notion that people's values differ fundamentally from one another, Keirsey drew upon the views of several psychologists or psychiatrists: Ernst Kretschmer, Erich Adickes, Alfred Adler, Carl Jung, and Isabel Myers who are all mentioned as predecessors in the psychology of temperament or personality.Keirsey & Bates (1984), pp. 3-4 Of these methods, preference is given to the Myers‚ÄìBriggs test when determining personality type.Keirsey & Bates (1984), p. 4 Sixteen personality types Keirsey and Bates offer a personality inventory to help readers identify their type. They are taken from the Myers‚ÄìBriggs Personality Inventory. The sets of indicated preferences create sixteen types: * E or I (Extraversion vs. Introversion) * N or S (INtuition vs. Sensation) * T or F (Thinking vs. Feeling) * J or P (Judging vs. Perceiving) An appendix offers a concise profile description for each of the sixteen types.http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality- type/mbti-basics/ Four temperament types Then Keirsey simplifies these sixteen types into four groups, whose archetypes he equates with the classical four temperaments: SP (Artisan), SJ (Guardian), NT (Rational), and NF (Idealist). *SP (ISTP, ISFP, ESTP, ESFP): Called the Dionysian or Artisan temperament *SJ (ISTJ, ISFJ, ESTJ, ESFJ): Called the Epimethean or Guardian temperament *NT (INTJ, ENTP, INTP, ENTJ): Called the Promethean or Rational temperament *NF (INFJ, ENFP, INFP, ENFJ): Called the Apollonian or Idealist temperament Keirsey organizes the groups asymmetrically, asserting Thinking vs. Feeling as the most salient distinction among intuitives, but Judging vs. Perceiving as the most salient distinction among Sensers. His methodology emphasizes the four temperaments, as he defines them, to generalize about different aptitudes and needs. Please Understand Me II (1998) is a sequel, whose methodology generalizes more so according to these four categories.

Of the billions of lire that were earmarked for aid to the victims and rebuilding, the largest part disappeared from the earthquake reconstruction funds in the 1980s. Of the $40 billion spent on earthquake reconstruction, an estimated $20 billion went to create an entirely new social class of millionaires in the region, $6.4 billion went to the Camorra, whereas another $4 billion went to politicians in bribes.

These same symptoms can also be caused by Ascochyta pinodes, and the two fungi are not easily distinguishable.Pea Ascochyta Blight Symptoms Hosts and symptoms The host of Ascochyta pisi is the field pea (Pisum sativum L.). Ascochyta pisi also infects 20 genera of plants and more than 50 plant species including soybean, sweet pea, lentil, alfalfa, common bean, clover, black- eyed-pea, and broad bean. Field pea is an annual, cool season legume that is native to northwest and southwest Asia. Ascochyta blight of peas is one of the most important diseases of pea in terms of acreage affected. Yield losses of 5 to 15% are common during wet conditions. Symptoms include: * spots on stems, leaves, tendrils, and pods (can be purplish, black, or brown in color) * lesions on stems, leaves, tendrils, and pods (can be purplish, black, or brown in color) * pod lesions become sunken * black spore-producing structures form in the lesions * with high humidity spots can enlarge and coalesce, resulting in the lower leaves being completely blighted * stem girdling * pod lesions can happen in moist conditions or if pea has lodged * infected seeds can appear discolored and purplish-brown * lightly infected seeds often appear healthy Disease cycle Ascochyta blight of peas is caused by a fungus. More than one fungal species can cause this disease. Other pathogens that cause Ascochyta blight, besides Ascochyta pisi, include: Mycosphaerella pinodes, Phoma medicaginis var. pinodella, and Phoma koolunga. Mycosphaerella pinodes is the only species that develops a sexual spore stage on infected residue. This stage results in the production of wind-blown ascospores. Ascospores can be dispersed several kilometers. Ascospore release begins in the spring and can continue into the summer if there is enough moisture. Didymella pisi is the teliomorph stage of Ascochyta pisi All above ground parts of the pea plant and all growth stages are susceptible to Ascochyta pisi. The fungus overwinters in seed, soil, or infected crop residues. Infected crop residue is the primary source of infection in the main pea producing areas. The fungus survives on seeds and in the soil as resting spores, called chlamydospores. The seed to seedling transmission rate is low. Infected seeds turn purplish- brown and are often shriveled and smaller in size The pathogen survives as hyphae in the seed coat and embryo. New disease is established when spores of the fungus are carried to a new, healthy crop by wind or rain splash. These fungal spores then penetrate the leaf. In the spring, it produces conidia in pycnidia. The release of these spores begins in spring and can continue into the summer if moist conditions persist. The conidia are spread short distances by wind and rain. Disease can also be established by planting infected seed. Symptoms appear within 2‚Äì4 days after initial infection. The Ascochyta pisi spores are viable on crop debris, although they do not survive for more than a year. Other Ascochyta blight pathogens have thick walled chlamydospores, which can survive for up to a few years in the soil. Management * Crop rotation: In order to reduce the risk of infection of pea crops from infected residue and soil-borne survival structures in a field, pea crops should be grown only every three to four years in the same field. It is important to plant pea crops as far from the previous years‚Äô field as possible in order to limit the spread of infection. The spores have a short distance dispersal during the growing season. Crop rotation alone is not a recommended management tactic due to spores traveling several kilometers. * Stubble management: Practices include straw-chopping and harrowing to spread out the crop residue on the soil surface. This can be important in helping to speed up crop residue decomposition. * Variety selection: It is important to know the disease and lodging ratings of certain pea varieties in order to choose a variety that is most likely to resist disease. * Agronomics: Seed rate and planting date can have a major effect on exposure of the crop to disease and on susceptibility. Agronomic practices promoting varieties and conditions that limit lodging and avoiding fields with excess nitrogen can reduce the spread and intensity of disease. * Seed quality: It is suggested that farmers have their seed tested for germination levels and seed-borne disease levels. Seed with infection levels of 10% or more should be treated with fungicide. It is advised to plant seed with less than 10% ascochyta infection if that quality of seed can be sourced. * Seed treatments: Treatments provide protection against seed and soil-borne diseases. Apron Maxx RTA¬Æ and Vitaflo 280¬Æ are products registered for seed-borne ascochyta. * Scouting: Disease scouting is critical to catch ascochyta blight early. It is recommended to begin scouting during the vegetative stage and to continue scouting into the early flowering stage. The reason for this is to observe whether disease symptoms are moving upwards and are present on tendrils and flowers. If symptoms of ascochyta blight are present in at least 50% of the bottom third of the crop canopy and are progressing into the middle third of the canopy, fungicide control may be recommended. A few other reasons to use fungicides are if the weather has been humid, if there is a forecast for rain, and if a high yield of peas would justify the cost of spraying fungicides. * Foliar Fungicides: The registered fungicides used for field peas to control ascochyta blight are Bravo 500¬Æ, Headline EC¬Æ, Lance¬Æ, and Quadris¬Æ. Early flowering is the ideal time to apply these fungicides. They work by protecting the healthy green plant material, but will not repair plants affected by foot rot. High water volumes are necessary for full coverage of leaves and penetration of the plant canopy. Before planting, some recommended management practices include destroying infected crop residues, crop rotation, and planting the current crop far from the previously infected crops‚Äô field or residues. Disease can be managed in multiple ways during and after planting. One method to manage disease is to follow the recommended seeding dates and rates to avoid fostering an ideal environment for the pathogen. If the seed density is too high and planted too early, there is increased exposure to the plant pathogen. This seeding practice also creates an ideal environment for the pathogen because the plants often produce larger canopies and experience more lodging, which creates a close, high-humidity environment ideal for the pathogen. Long term crop rotation with non-host crops is recommended. Chemical control with fungicidal seed dressings is another effective method of control. Environment This pathogen needs cool, moist conditions, and development occurs more quickly as plant tissues age. An increase in severity of infection is often noted when the crop canopy closes due to the dense growth that prevents dry air from penetrating the canopy. This creates a cool, humid, moist environment under the canopy, and as a result, the disease symptoms are most prevalent at the base of the canopy and spread up the plant. Plant lodging also creates a dense, humid environment favorable for the pathogen. The optimal temperature for disease establishment and development is around 20 ¬∞C. Spore dispersal and the development of the disease are slowed in the absence of high levels of moisture.

It causes Ascochyta leaf spot (also known as rough leaf spot) on barley that can also be caused by the related fungi Ascochyta hordei, Ascochyta graminea and Ascochyta tritici. It is considered a minor disease of barley. Hosts and symptoms Ascochyta sorghi infects grain crops such as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense), Sudan grass (Sorghum sudanense), and barley (Hordeum vulgare).\\"Rough Leaf Spot of Sorghum (Ascochyta Sorghi).\\" Plantwise Knowledge Bank. N.p., n.d. Web. 23 Oct. 2016. . It can also infect wild sorghum species.Kucharek, Tom. \\"Foliar and Head Diseases of Sorghum in Florida.\\" EPPO Bulletin 41.3 (2011): 266-68. Web. 23 Oct. 2016. . Symptoms of rough leaf spot can appear on leaf blades, leaf sheaths, peduncles, stalks, and glumes of susceptible species. On sorghum, symptoms are usually noted on leaf blades beginning as small red lesions. Lesions expand over time, becoming broadly- elliptical up to one inch in length. Spots usually develop a tan interior bordered by a dark red to purple color, but can remain a uniform dark color. The presence of black pycnidia exposed on the surface of the lesions give the leaf a rough, sandpapery feeling, hence the name ‚Äúrough leaf spot.‚ÄùDas, I.K.H, and P.G Padmaja. Biotic Stress Resistance in Millets. Amsterdam: Academic, an Imprint of Elsevier, 2016. Print. Rough leaf spot can eventually lead to leaf senescence. Management Ascochyta sorghi is controlled through host plant resistance, cultural practices, and chemical application when necessary. Varieties of sorghum are not generally susceptible to rough leaf spot, although exceptions do exist. Cultural practices include crop rotation, deep plowing, and avoiding field operations when leaf surfaces are wet. As Ascochyta sorghi survives in plant debris and pycnidia in the soil, crop rotation and deep plowing allow for the avoidance of potential inoculum sources.Singh, D.S., and M.S. Pavgi. ‚ÄúPerpetuation of Two Foliicolous Fungi Parasitic on Sorghum, in India / Sopravvivenza Di Due Funghi Fitopatogeni Che Attaccano Le Foglie Di Sorgo, in India.‚Äù Phytopathologia Mediterranea, vol. 21, no. 1, 1982, pp. 41‚Äì42. www.jstor.org/stable/42685858. Other sanitation, such as using clean seed and removing alternate hosts, such as wild sorghum species, can reduce disease incidence. Spores are spread from water splash, and can also be transmitted through contact with field equipment, especially when leaves are wet, so delaying field operations until plants are dry can help prevent spread of the pathogen. If necessary, the application of fungicides can help limit disease severity. Importance Ascochyta sorghi is found in all sorghum growing areas. Throughout most areas of the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Europe, Ascochyta sorghi causes little crop loss and is considered to have a very low overall impact on sorghum production.Plant Health Australia Ltd (Version 1, May 2014) Generic contingency plan ‚Äì Exotic foliage affecting necrotrophic pathogens affecting the grains industry. Plant Health Australia, Canberra, ACT. Web. 23 Oct. 2016. The lack of economic importance of rough leaf spot is thought to be due to the prevalence of resistant varieties. However, there are a few areas where it may be more prevalent. Some states in India, such as Madhya Pradesh, have seen severe outbreaks of A. sorghi, where it has the potential to become epidemic.ICRISAT (International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics). 1980. Proceedings of the International Workshop on Sorghum Diseases, sponsored jointly by Texas A & M University (USA) and ICRISAT, 11‚Äì15 December 1978, Hyderabad, India. (Available from ICRISAT, Patancheru, A.P., India 502 324.) Weimer et al. (1937) reported that A. sorghi had the capacity to become damaging in Georgia. Historically, rough spot has been responsible for crop losses between 3 and 10% in French Equatorial Africa.

These glands had been recently discovered as an anatomical entity in 1880, however their importance was not understood at the time. Gley realized that the cause of tetany after thyroid operations was the inadvertent destruction of the parathyroid glands. He demonstrated this by removing the parathyroid glands from laboratory animals and witnessing their deaths from tetany. Because of his discovery, parathyroid glands have sometimes been referred to as \\"Gley's glands\\". In his studies of the thyroid, he discovered that there was much more iodine in thyroid tissue than in the parathyroid, and noticed that when the thyroid is removed, a disturbance of iodine metabolism occurs.

Skinner Uniflow Marine Engines fed by two water tube boilers and driving twin screws. A removable, vertical, steam operated reel capable of carrying fifty tons of mine control cable was located on the forecastle. Two full mine groups could be carried on deck with room in the main hold for another full group if necessary. By 1944 the threat of attack on the U.S. coast had faded and the Coast Artillery began releasing mine planters for other uses.  USS Trapper (1945-1946)  On 2 January 1945 the mine planter was acquired by the Navy and converted into a Chimo class auxiliary minelayer by the Charleston Navy Yard, Charleston, South Carolina. The ship was commissioned USS Trapper, designated ACM-9, on 5 March 1945, with Lt. Richard E. Lewis, USNR, in command. Trapper began shakedown training in the Chesapeake Bay during April and got underway the Pacific Ocean war zone for on 11 June 1945. Ths ship proceeded to Manzanillo, Cuba then through the Panama Canal to San Diego. In mid-August Japan capitulated while the ship was en route to Hawaii. Trapper arrived at Pearl Harbor on 21 August and was routed westward, via Eniwetok, Saipan, and Okinawa, to Japan. Trapper arrived at Kobe on 25 November 1945 and operated out of that port repairing minesweeping gear until 1 February 1946 when she shifted her base of operations to Wakayama for a month. On 11 March, the ship got underway for the United States. En route, she called at Saipan, Eniwetok, Kwajalein, Johnston Island, and Hawaii before arriving at San Francisco, on 2 May 1946.  USCGC Yamacraw (1946-1959)  USS Trapper was decommissioned and transferred to the United States Coast Guard in San Francisco on 20 June 1946 and struck from the Navy List on 19 July 1946. The former auxiliary minelayer served with the Coast Guard as a cable layer until early 1959 as Yamacraw (WARC-333). Up until 1946 the Coast Guard was responsible for Navy cable laying operations as well as its own. In 1922 the Coast Guard had obtained the 1909 Army Mine Planter Gen. Samuel M. Mills which it renamed Pequot, second USCG cable ship with the name,The first was USCGC Pequot (1919-1922). for service until replaced by Yamacraw in 1946. =Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Work= During 1957‚Äì1958 the ship was leased by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution making voyages in the Atlantic and Mediterranean largely for acoustic and geophysical work. During 1957 a long thermistor chain with twenty-three thermistors at intervals of and towing winch were installed on the ship. The sensor system had been designed to allow continuous collection of temperatures at depth, particularly useful in study of ocean acoustics. The ship collected data in the western Atlantic coast from Nova Scotia to Charleston, South Carolina and into the Sargasso Sea. Yamacraw was in the Mediterranean during the summer of 1958 collecting data on sound transmission. The ship was again equipped with the towed thermistor chain. Included was a study of the Strait of Gibraltar in which the ship departed Cadiz 8 August to observe the thermal structure at the sill where Mediterranean water and Atlantic waters meet.The Navy sponsored intense study of ocean acoustics for antisubmarine systems, particularly surveillance systems. The distribution lists and sponsors have considerable overlap with those responsible for the Sound Surveillance System; i.e. Bureau of Ships (SOSUS project office), Hudson Laboratories, and Bell Laboratories. =Onionhead= Before being transferred back to the U.S. Navy the Yamacraw was the buoy tender in the 1958 film Onionhead, which starred Andy Griffith and Walter Matthau.  USS Yamacraw (1959-1965)  The ship was reacquired by the U.S. Navy on 17 April 1959 and commissioned in New York on 30 April 1959 as the Cable Repair Ship USS Yamacraw (ARC-5), 30 April 1959. Yamacraw was assigned to the 3rd Naval District for the next six years. She operated from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to Bermuda and spent much of her at-sea time conducting research projects for the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and for the Bell Telephone Laboratories. The ship, operated by Bell Telephone Laboratories, was identified as one of nine military research and development oceanographic ships in a 1959 National Academy of Sciences report. One of the operations for ONR involved a test of a cable towed oceanographic instrumentation system. The test tow, conducted 13 to 17 April 1962, proved the feasibility of towing the system to a depth of at speeds up to .  Decommissioning and disposal  Yamacraw was decommissioned 2 July 1965 and transferred to the Maritime Administration for disposal the same day. The ship was purchased for $20,850 by North American Smelting for scrap on 18 October 1967 and withdrawn from the Hudson River Reserve Fleet on 2 November 1967 for scrapping. Yamacraw was scrapped in 1969.

Career Piatt played baseball at Bishop Verot High School, followed by a successful college career at Mississippi State University (MSU), helping lead the Bulldogs to multiple NCAA Tournament appearances. Piatt led the MSU team in 1996 with a .370 batting average. Piatt played mostly at third base for MSU and was named to the second team All-Southeastern Conference unit in 1997, when the Bulldogs reached the College World Series. He chose to leave school early after that, and signed a professional contract. Piatt finished his education at MSU, earning Cum Laude honors from MSU's Business School. Piatt's best year was 1999 when he won the triple crown and minor league player of the year award at third base. He became an outfielder because of the A's present third baseman, Eric Chavez, and that was the only opening on the A's. He hit .299 in 60 games in 2000 with 5 home runs and 5 triples. In 2001, he got viral meningitis, but survived. He was designated for assignment by the A's in August 2003 and was claimed off waivers by Tampa Bay. In 2004, he went to Cleveland, but retired before the season. Piatt was once featured in a commercial for K-Swiss shoes. In the Mitchell Report, Piatt admitted to having used steroids. Piatt said that former A's teammate F. P. Santangelo had told him about a man who could give Piatt human growth hormone (HGH). Piatt (who was trying to come back from viral meningitis) received HGH and testosterone from Kirk Radomski and used them in the 2002‚Äì2003 off-season. After using them, he said he \\"did not love the game when he used them\\" and that he had learned a life lesson. Piatt told all of this to Mitchell during their meeting. Former Senator George Mitchell commended Piatt for his honesty, and for being one of the few players to come forward to discuss the league's performance-enhancing drug use. Piatt now lives in Cape Coral, Florida.

Plot Eva Gregory (Thora Birch) lives in Los Angeles with her mother Amy (Mimi Rogers), her brother Jack (Adrian and Julian Johnson), and her stepfather Tom (Christopher McDonald), a police lieutenant. Tom's daughter Tessa (Alison Elliott) occasionally babysits Eva and Jack. Eva wants a dog, but her mother does not think she is responsible enough to take care of a pet, her stepfather is allergic to fur, and she cannot keep the pet at her father Peter's (Kevin Scannell) house because he is a pilot and travels a lot. A gypsy kleptomaniac Azro (Harvey Keitel), whose wife and son Mark (Adam LaVorgna) recently left him, is now a vagabond and lives off the grid with his intelligent Capuchin monkey Fingers (Finster). Azro blames Fingers for his wife and son leaving. He is also hiding from Bells Boy (similar to Claude Frollo) along with his horse named Sir Reginald. He works as a hurdy gurdy-playing busker at Venice Beach, using Fingers' cuteness as a way to lure in tourists. Azro has taught Fingers how to pickpocket the audience members. A pair of Italian mafia members named Drake (Robert Miranda) and Charlie (Victor Argo) show up to Azro's act. They deduce Azro's scheme and proposition him to bigger and better opportunities. They ask him to join their crime syndicate, with Fingers using his pickpocket skills to burglarize homes of socialites. The men want to do a test run to see how Fingers will act, and they drive to a random residence, Eva's home. Fingers successfully steal various expensive items, and Azro joins the crime group. Feeling ashamed of his actions, later that night Fingers runs away from Azro. The next day, as Eva is walking home from school, Fingers drops from a tree and latches himself onto Eva. She instantly becomes connected to him, and names him \\"Dodger\\", as he likes Eva's Dodgers hat. Eva keeps the monkey a secret and hides him in her bedroom. She becomes more responsible with her chores and helps take care of her infant brother Jack, to whom she reveals Dodger. She researches information on his breed. When Eva has to leave for school, she leaves him in the care of a woman who runs a pet shop near her home, Annie (Jo Champa). Eva fibs that the monkey is a present for her mother. Azro tries to find the monkey but the Italian mafia members pester him over this and Bells Boy gives a big chase. Eva spends some weekends with her father, and worries about how she can hide Dodger while she's away. However, Peter leaves a phone message that he's in Canada and can't have her over. She takes advantage of this circumstance to have a personal weekend alone with Dodger in her father's empty house and hides his message from her mother and stepfather. She has her best friend Katie (Remy Ryan) and her mother Missy (Deborah White) drive her to her father's house. During the trip, Eva secretly reveals Dodger to Katie. Once there, Eva realizes that she doesn't have a key to her father's house. Dodger is able to break into the home. Once inside, they realize that there isn't any food and Eva has not brought any money. She decides to busk for money with Dodger at Venice Beach boardwalk near Peter's house. While Eva is riding her bike to the boardwalk, Dodger and Azro spot each other, and without Eva being aware, Dodger jumps off her bike. Azro tries to catch Dodger, but he is caught by the mafia members who take him away from the scene. Bells Boy was losing his patience. Dodger then secretly makes his way back to Eva's bike, and they start their performance, with Dodger secretly pickpocketing everybody just as with when he was with Azro. At a grocery store that evening, with Dodger hiding in Eva's backpack, he steals and hides food without Eva knowing. The management of the store, unaware there is a monkey in her backpack, assume Eva is shoplifting and allow her to return the items without being punished. Eva is puzzled, opens her backpack in a back aisle of the store, and sees the items Dodger stole. When she returns home, she scolds him. Dodger then reveals all the items he has stolen since he met Eva. She realizes that he was taught how to pickpocket and break into buildings. She decides to teach him not to steal anymore. Azro finds out about the supermarket incident, and a store manager gives him Peter's address. Eva is now preparing to return home and calls a taxi. Azro arrives at the house, and Eva is scared of him. She and Dodger run out of the house and escape. The next day, Azro finds out Dodger is at Annie's pet shop. Azro attacks Annie and steals Dodger back. Azro is aghast when he discovers that the monkey won't steal anymore during a meeting with the mafia members. Unfortunately for Azro, Bells Boy had spotted Azro. Meanwhile, Amy and Tom, who have been dealing with reports on stolen jewelry, discover more stolen property in Eva's room. They confront her about it, and she tries to explain about her hidden monkey, but they don't believe her. Things get worse when Peter stops by and says that he had been in Canada all weekend, which reveals that Eva had lied about that time. Already heartbroken at the disappearance of her beloved pet, she is also upset that no one believes her. She runs away to look for Dodger after Katie calls and tells Eva that Dodger is at the park. She is accosted by Azro, who is furious about her teaching Dodger not to steal. Meanwhile, Jack ends up saying his first word, \\"monkey\\", revealing to Amy, Peter, and Tom that there really is a monkey in the house (Dodger escaped from Azro again, shortly after Eva ran off and sneaked back into her bedroom) and that Eva had been telling the truth. They all go out, along with Tom's fellow police officers, to look for her. Dodger saves her, and Azro is arrested Bells Boy. The mafia members escape but are soon arrested. Eva walks away happily with Dodger after she shows her mother that she is responsible and her stepfather discovers that he is no longer allergic to the fur of monkeys. Mark tries taking Dodger back but fails. Dodger ends up staying with Eva.

Lipton is Associate Dean of Research, Professor, and the Frederick G. Storey Chair in Computing in the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Career In 1968, Lipton received his undergraduate degree in mathematics from Case Western Reserve University. In 1973, he received his Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University; his dissertation, supervised by David Parnas, is entitled On Synchronization Primitive Systems. After graduating, Lipton taught at Yale 1973-1978, at Berkeley 1978-1980, and then at Princeton 1980-2000\\\\. Since 2000, Lipton has been at Georgia Tech. While at Princeton, Lipton worked in the field of DNA computing. Since 1996, Lipton has been the chief consulting scientist at Telcordia. Karp‚ÄìLipton theorem In 1980, along with Richard M. Karp, Lipton proved that if SAT can be solved by Boolean circuits with a polynomial number of logic gates, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its second level.  Parallel algorithms Showing that a program P has some property is a simple process if the actions inside the program are uninterruptible. However, when the action is interruptible, Lipton showed that through a type of reduction and analysis, it can be shown that the reduced program has that property if and only if the original program has the property.Lipton, R (1975) \\"Reduction: a method of proving properties of parallel programs\\", Communications of the ACM 18(12) If the reduction is done by treating interruptible operations as one large uninterruptible action, even with these relaxed conditions properties can be proven for a program P. Thus, correctness proofs of a parallel system can often be greatly simplified. Database security Lipton studied and created database security models on how and when to restrict the queries made by users of a database such that private or secret information will not be leaked.Lipton, R (1979) \\"Secure databases: protection against user influence\\", \\"ACM Transactions on Database Systems\\" 4(1) Even when the user is restricted to only read operations on a database, secure information could be at risk. For example, querying a database of campaign donations could allow the user to discover the individual donations to political candidates or organizations. If given access to averages of data and unrestricted query access, a user could exploit the properties of those averages to gain illicit information. These queries are considered to have large \\"overlap\\" creating the insecurity. By bounding the \\"overlap\\" and number of queries, a secure database can be achieved. Online scheduling Richard Lipton with Andrew Tomkins introduced a randomized online interval scheduling algorithm, the 2-size version being strongly competitive, and the k-size version achieving O(log\\\\vartriangle^{1+\\\\epsilon}), as well as demonstrating a theoretical lower- bound of O(log\\\\vartriangle). This algorithm uses a private-coin for randomization and a \\"virtual\\" choice to fool a medium adversary. Being presented with an event the user must decide whether or not to include the event in the schedule. The 2-size virtual algorithm is described by how it reacts to 1-interval or k-intervals being presented by the adversary: *For a 1-interval, flip a fair coin ;Heads: Take the interval ;Tails: \\"Virtually\\" take the interval, but do no work. Take no short interval for the next 1 unit of time. *For a k-interval, take whenever possible. Again, this 2-size algorithm is shown to be strongly-competitive. The generalized k-size algorithm which is similar to the 2-size algorithm is then shown to be O(log\\\\vartriangle^{1+\\\\epsilon})-competitive. Program checking Lipton showed that randomized testing can be provably useful, given the problem satisfied certain properties.Lipton, R (1991) \\"New Directions in Testing\\", \\"DIMACS Distributed Computing and Cryptography\\" Vol. 2 page: 191 Proving correctness of a program is one of the most important problems presented in computer science. Typically in randomized testing, in order to attain a 1/1000 chance of an error, 1000 tests must be run. However Lipton shows that if a problem has \\"easy\\" sub-parts, repeated black-box testing can attain cr error rate, with c a constant less than 1 and r being the number of tests. Therefore, the probability of error goes to zero exponentially fast as r grows. This technique is useful to check the correctness of many types of problems. *Signal processing: fast Fourier transform (FFT) and other highly parallelizable functions are difficult to manually check results when written in code such as FORTRAN, so a way to quickly check correctness is greatly desired. *Functions over finite fields and the permanent: Suppose that f(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) is a polynomial over a finite field of size q with . Then ∆í is randomly testable of order over the function basis that includes just addition. Perhaps the most important application from this is the ability to efficiently check the correctness of the permanent. Cosmetically similar to the determinant, the permanent is very difficult to check correctness, but even this type of problem satisfies the constraints. This result even led to the breakthroughs of interactive proof systems Karloff-Nisan and Shamir, including the result . Games with simple strategies In the area of game theory, more specifically of non-cooperative games, Lipton together with E. Markakis and A. Mehta provedRichard Lipton, Evangelos Markakis, Aranyak Mehta (2007) \\"Playing Games with Simple Strategies\\", \\"EC '03: Proceedings of the 4th ACM conference on Electronic commerce\\", \\"ACM\\" the existence of epsilon- equilibrium strategies with support logarithmic in the number of pure strategies. Furthermore, the payoff of such strategies can epsilon-approximate the payoffs of exact Nash equilibria. The limited (logarithmic) size of the support provides a natural quasi-polynomial algorithm to compute epsilon- equilibria. Query size estimation Lipton and J.

Unlike most sampling estimation algorithms‚Äîwhich statically determine the number of samples needed‚Äîtheir algorithm decides the number of samples based on the sizes of the samples, and tends to keep the running time constant (as opposed to linear in the number of samples). Formal verification of programs DeMillo, Lipton and PerlisRichard A. DeMillo, Richard J. Lipton, Alan J. Perlis (1979) ‚ÄúSocial processes and proofs of theorems and programs‚Äù, \\"Communications of the ACM , Volume 22 Issue 5\\" criticized the idea of formal verification of programs and argued that *Formal verifications in computer science will not play the same key role as proofs do in mathematics. *Absence of continuity, the inevitability of change, and the complexity of specification of real programs will make formal verification of programs difficult to justify and manage. Multi-party protocols Chandra, Furst and LiptonA. K. Chandra, M. L. Furst, and R. J. Lipton (1983) \\"Multi-Party Protocols\\", \\"In STOC, pages 94‚Äì99. ACM, 25‚Äì2\\" generalized the notion of two- party communication protocols to multi-party communication protocols. They proposed a model in which a collection of processes (P_0,P_1,\\\\ldots,P_{k-1}) have access to a set of integers (a_0, a_1,\\\\ldots,a_{k-1}) except one of them, so that P_i is denied access to a_i. These processes are allowed to communicate in order to arrive at a consensus on a predicate. They studied this model's communication complexity, defined as the number of bits broadcast among all the processes. As an example, they studied the complexity of a k-party protocol for Exactly-N (do all a_i‚Äôs sum up to N?), and obtained a lower bound using the tiling method. They further applied this model to study general branching programs and obtained a time lower bound for constant-space branching programs that compute Exactly-N. Time/space SAT tradeoff We have no way to prove that Boolean satisfiability problem (often abbreviated as SAT), which is NP-complete, requires exponential (or at least super- polynomial) time (this is the famous P versus NP problem), or linear (or at least super-logarithmic) space to solve. However, in the context of space‚Äìtime tradeoff, one can prove that SAT cannot be computed if we apply constraints to both time and space. L. Fortnow, Lipton, D. van Melkebeek, and A. ViglasL. Fortnow, R. Lipton, D. van Melkebeek, and A. Viglas (2005) \\"Time-space lower bounds for satisfiability\\", \\"J. ACM, 52:835‚Äì865, 2005.

Pescheret in Gallery Studio Leon Rene Pescheret also known as L√©on- Ren√© Pescheret (March 15, 1892 - February 23, 1971) was a British-American designer, watercolorist, etcher, and illustrator.  Early life  Pescheret was born in the London suburb of Chiswick, England to French parents. His father was a chef for Queen Victoria until she died. Pescheret began his studies at the Royal College of Engraving in Kensington under Malcolm Osborne, and the Battersea Polytechnic (now called the University of Surrey) in London. In 1910, his father moved the family to Washington D.C. and became chef for the British Ambassador to the United States. Pescheret served in the American Army during World War I. After returning from World War I Pescheret began experimenting with etching striking his first pate in 1926.Arizona Daily Star, Over Stylized Technique Hit, March 19, 1942. He was admitted to the Chicago Society of Etchers in 1928. By the 1920s he was attending the Art Institute of Chicago studying interior design under French artist/muralist Albert Francis Fleury. In 1934 Pescheret traveled back to Europe to study with Roger Hebbelinck who was the color etcher to the court of Belgium. He studied in England at the Royal College of Engraving under Malcolm Osborn and Robert Austin. He was previously married to Grace Wallar Pescheret (1884-1950) and in 1951, he married Katherine Louis Pescheret n√©e Firebaugh (1898-1985).  Career  Pescheret devoted his business to etching full-time by 1930. While exhibiting in 1933 at the Century of Progress, he became interested in color etchings. To study this craft, he returned to Europe and became the private pupil of Roger Hebbelinck, a famous color etcher, and gained practical knowledge in doing one and multiple plate work. In 1936, he purchased the Halverson Home located on 519 West Main St., Whitewater, Wisconsin and opened his art studio and gallery there. For the next 31 years he produced both color and monochrome etchings from this studio. Pescheret authored several books including \\"An Introduction to Color Etching\\" (1952) and \\"Principle and Practice of Interior Decorating\\" (1925). He also illustrated two books written by Alfred Hoyt Granger, \\"The Spirit of Vienna\\" (1935) and \\"Chicago Welcomes You,\\" (1933) as well as contributing works to American Artist and Arizona Highways magazines. Pescheret did various architectural, interior designs and decorative art projects in his career including for Drake Hotel in Chicago, the Memorial Union Building at the University of Wisconsin; the Peoria, Illinois Country Club; and the British Museum. His work was show at galleries and museums throughout the United States including a one-man show at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. His work is held in the collections of The New York Public Library, the Library of Congress, Art Institute of Chicago, the King of Belgium's private collection in Brussels, the British Museum, and private collections throughout the United States and Europe. Pescheret was a member of the Society of American Engravers. Architectural design Pescheret practiced architectural design creating the interiors of the Drake Hotel in Chicago, the Wisconsin Memorial Union at the University of Wisconsin in Madison as well and numerous institutional and private interiors. He developed the interior design of the Peoria Country Club, Pierce Hall at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. Tucson and the Southwest Pescheret began visiting Tucson and Arizona in winter of the late 1930s.The Sheboygan Press, Scenic Beauties of United States Described Graphically by Speaker at Woman's Club, October 26, 1938 The annual winter visits expanded is visual understanding of the American Southwest. Pescheret speaking at the Sheboygan Women's Club in October 1938 recognized Arizona as one of the states \\"which offer the widest range of scenery.\\" The Sheboygan Press reported that \\"From Arizona scenes he received inspiration for two unusual sketches, Spanish Yuca and the Coachwhip. The first shows the desert plant which grows to a height of 18 feet in full bloom against an azure sky, The Coachwhip or Devil's Walking Stick, is another form of giant cacti rarely seen anywhere else but in Arizona.\\" In April 1940 Pescheret visited Mexico, he would later speak publicly about the country as a \\"land of great contrasts, great wealth and extreme poverty, beautiful churches and the meanest hovels, marvelous climate and barren country.\\"Porter, Katharine, Freeport Journal Standard (Freeport, Illinois), Trip to Mexico Ably Described by L.R. Pescheret, January 12, 1942. He visited Mexico City, Taxco, the floating island gardens of Xochimilco and Toluca documenting life and iconic details of places that could become that basis for etching. These photographic images were noted by the Freeport Journal Standard as \\"emphasizing detail rather than general effect. He presented the point of view of the artist, rather than the historian or anthropologist and this variation proved of special interest.\\" This period resulted in important work that emphasized shadows and architectural texture. Significant works inspired by this trip included: \\"Do√±a Berta's, Taxco,\\" \\"Market Place, Taxco Mexico,\\" (1940) and a color images of the street and bell towers of the Taxco cathedral titled \\"Taxco Mexico.\\" (1940) and \\"Taxco Cathedral, Mexico.\\" His national reputation for one plate color etching made him an instantaneously recognized figure in Tucson's emerging artist community. He was regularly invited to speak to art classes and groups, his \\"desert work\\" for this period was included regularly in exhibits and shown through private residential receptions. In March 1942, on a visit to Tucson, Pescheret spoke to the combined art classes at the University of Arizona and the Advertisers National Federation in Phoenix on the topic of one plate color etching and this phase of his work. During these lectures Pescheret articulated his philosophy that artist should produce quantities of prints to drive down the price so that they can be acquired by the general public and avoid limiting production to elevate scarcity so only collectors and museums can buy them.Over Stylized Technique Hit, Arizona Daily Star, 19 March 1942. In discussing the single plate color etching process with the Arizona Daily Star in 1942, Pescheret explained that he only produced six plates a year each an open edition of 200 prints. These prints are produced on large copper plates, the smallest 10 by 12 inches the largest 13 by 18 inches.Exhibit of 23 Color Etching Opens Tuesday, Tucson Daily Citizen, March 2, 1946 Through the 1940s Pescheret became a fixture in the Arizona art scene. In 1944 the Phoenix Writers Club published a volume of poetry titled \\"Random Arrows,\\" Pescheret contributed a desert etching that was reproduced as the frontispiece of the book.Arizona Republic, Members of Phoenix Writers Club Publish Book of Poems, December 3, 1944 In 1946 Pescheret exhibited 24 color etching at an exhibit at the Arizona State Museum as part of a one-man show in Tucson, Arizona.Tucson Daily Citizen, Indian, Tree Ring Exhibits Draw Visitors, December 19, 1945 The etching showed the southwestern desert and images of Wisconsin, Tennessee and New England. While Pescheret's work mastered monochromatic images, he established a national reputation as a color etcher. Most of his work was produced using a single plate, all the color necessary to the development of the image rubbed into the copper plate then printed by passing the plate and through the press. Only one print is obtained from one coloring, and it must be a perfect print, as no additions or subtractions can me made after the print is struck. In 1954 Pescheret's color etching were shown at the O'Brian Galleries in PhoenixO'Brien Galleries Announcement, Arizona Republic, January 21, 1954 and in 1955 the Arizona State Museum exhibited thirty of his color etching.Arizona Daily Star, UA to Exhibit Pescheret's Etching, February 13, 1955 During the exhibit Pescheret gave a gallery talk. In 1957 his black and white and color prints were shown at the Tucson Art and Craft Market Gallery in Tucson.Arizona Daily Star, Art, Craft Market announcement, March 24, 1957 Leon Pescheret closed the Whitewater studio in 1967, relocating to Tucson, Arizona, where he died on February 23, 1971. =Desert etchings= Pescheret's desert etchings from Arizona, New Mexico and California blended his distinctive style with the stark landscapes, big skies, romantic architecture and magnificent coloring to produce some of his most indelible work.

He was born with stunted fingers so was unable to play a musical instrument himself. Later in life, when asked about his hands by children, he said he used to bite his fingernails too much.  Early life  John Hosier was born in the northwest London suburb of Kingsbury, Middlesex. His father, Harry Hosier, was the co-founder of the building firm Hosier and Dickinson alongside G.W. Dickinson, A Master Builder. His mother, Constance, was a violinist. She overcame the problem of his playing a musical instrument by teaching him to play the xylophone. He attended Fryent Primary School, Kingsbury, Preston Manor County Grammar School, now Preston Manor High School, Wembley and St John's College, Cambridge where he also served as a director of Footlights from 1950‚Äì1951.  Career  Hosier's career began in 1953 when he was appointed as a music producer for BBC Radio for schools, a position he held until 1959. Then from 1960 until 1973 he worked in BBC Television for schools. He was producer of the Schools Television programme Music Time. From 1973 until 1976, he was the inspector for Inner London Education Authority and the director of the Centre for Young Musicians. From 1978 until 1989, he was the principal of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican Arts Centre. During the trial of the musician Philip Pickett, it emerged that the parents of one of the students raped by Pickett had written to Hosier to complain. The parents were told to take their child elsewhere for lessons. The following year, the Guildhall awarded Pickett a Fellowship, one of its highest honours. In 1986, Hosier worked with Leonard Bernstein for the Barbican Centre's Leonard Bernstein Festival. He became a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1984. In 1989 he was appointed Director of the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, a position he held for 5 years until 1993. He was director of the Early Music Centre in London from 1994 until his death in 2000.Obituary: John Hosier, The Guardian, 3 April 2000 He was married to Biddy Baxter, the editor of the BBC's children's television programme Blue Peter for nearly 25 years. In 2003, Baxter established the John Hosier Music Trust which offers scholarships to students to take up post-graduate studies.

History The phrase \\"To carry Coals to Newcastle\\" is first documented in North America in 1679 in William Fitzhugh's letters (\\"But relating farther to you would be carrying Coals to new Castle\\")Bartlett Jere Whiting Early American Proverbs and Proverbial Phrases 1977 - Page 76 \\"To carry Coals to Newcastle 1679 Fitzhugh Letters 67: But relating farther to you would be carrying Coals to new Castle. 1768 Habersham Letters 68: [He] asked, if I wanted to carry Coals\\" and first appears in a printed title in Labour in vain: or Coals to Newcastle: A sermon to the people of Queen-Hith, 1709. Timothy Dexter, an American entrepreneur, succeeded in defying the idiom in the eighteenth century by actually shipping coal to Newcastle. Renowned for his eccentricity and widely regarded as a buffoon, he was persuaded to sail a shipment of coal to Newcastle by rival merchants plotting to ruin him. However, he instead got a large profit after his cargo arrived during a miners' strike which had crippled local production. More prosaically, the American National Coal Association asserted that the United States profitably sold coal to Newcastle in the early 1990s,\\"U.S. Beats The Price Of Coal In Newcastle\\", William Flannery, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, May 10, 1990 and 70,000 tonnes of low-sulphur coal was imported by Alcan from Russia in 2004 for their local aluminium smelting plant. Although the coal industry of Newcastle upon Tyne is now practically non-existent, the expression can still be used today with a degree of literal accuracy, since the harbour of Newcastle in Australia (named for Newcastle in the UK after abundant coal deposits were discovered there and exploited by early European settlers) has succeeded its UK namesake by becoming the largest exporter of coal in the modern world. Contemporary use With the increasing onset of globalization, parallels in other industries are being found, and the idiom is now frequently used by the media when reporting business ventures whose success may initially appear just as unlikely. It has been referred to in coverage of the export to India of Saudi Arabian saffron and chicken tikka masala from the United Kingdom,\\"The Next Asian Journey: Shadows of Old Araby\\", TIME, vol.158, no.7/8, August 20, 2001\\"Chicken tikka masala: Spice and easy does it\\", BBC News, April 20, 2001 the sale of Scottish pizzas to Italy,\\"Selling coals to Newcastle?

Only are currently managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Illinois River National Wildlife and Fish Refuges Complex. It is in the Central forest-grasslands transition ecoregion. Most of the wildlife refuge is made up of reclaimed agricultural land. A reclamation project within the Refuge, the Emiquon Project, is operated by the Nature Conservancy, which is a partner with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the creation of the Refuge. In February 2012, the Emiquon Complex, centering on the Emiquon NWR, was designated under the Ramsar Convention as a Wetland of International Importance. History The Emiquon National Wildlife Refuge and the Emiquon Project cover the historic beds of Flag Lake and Thompson Lake, which were shallow, alluvial lakes created by the Illinois River during the geological period that followed the last ice age. Heavy loads of sand and silt carried southwest by the river created almost random, undulating topography along the river's bed. The river responded to these deposits by repeatedly shifting its course, leaving long, narrow sections of abandoned riverbed behind it. Two of these sections became Flag Lake and Thompson Lake. Surrounding these two lakes, and strung out along the western bank of the Illinois River, was a characteristic North American riverine ecosystem characterized by dense populations of shellfish, fish, migratory birds, and mammals. The Emiquon wetland became a favorite home for many Indians of the Illinois Territory for thousands of years, leaving 149 known archeological sites behind them within the parcels of land that make up the Project. These hunter-gatherers used and lived in and around both the wetlands of Emiquon and the adjacent river bluffs. During the centuries between 1000 CE and 1300 CE, many of them buried their dead in an adjacent blufftop, now the Dickson Mounds National Historic Site.Brenda Rothert, \\"Emiquon's rebirth begins: Nature Conservancy planting 260,000 trees at preserve near Lewistown\\", Peoria Journal Star, May 6, 2007. When new Americans of European ancestry began living along the Illinois River in the late 17th century, they brought several wetland diseases with them, notably malaria. Local Indian populations declined, and the settlers tried not to live in or near wetlands, believing them to be unhealthy places to live. When Fulton County was organized in 1823, the settlers selected a blufftop location several miles away as the county seat. A population of local Illinois River settlers thinly settled the Emiquon riverbank, which was too wet for traditional European-style farming. The region continued to yield a living to fur trappers, hunters, and fishermen. However, in 1919 Joy Morton, a wealthy Chicago CEO, acquired the Emiquon area and had a levee built around it and drainage ditches dug. Emiquon became the Norris Farm, and the former wetlands and lake beds were drained and converted into cornfields. The formerly free-flowing Illinois River was dammed and confined to a narrow channel running between artificial banks. Much of Emiquon was low-lying and required periodic pumping with electric motors so that the land could remain dry and useful as farmland. Restoration project Throughout the 20th century, alterations to the Illinois riverbed caused severe damage to the ecological diversity and fish productivity of the river. Beginning in the 1960s, naturalists lobbied for restoration of parts of the riverbed and former wetlands. After extended negotiations, the Nature Conservancy acquired the property in 2000. In 2007, the Conservancy enrolled a parcel within the Project in the federally subsidized Wetlands Reserve Program. By 2008, volunteers working with the Nature Conservancy had replanted 300,000 wetland trees, including black walnuts, swamp white oaks, and pecans, and 8,000 pounds of grassland seed. The Conservancy believed that the Emiquon Project was the second largest wetlands restoration project in the United States, behind the Restoration of the Everglades.Chris Young, \\"Emiquon Preserve Revival: Floodplain project begins to reap results from efforts\\", (Springfield, Ill.) State Journal-Register, May 29, 2007, page 17. As part of the restoration efforts, drainage pumps were turned off and one of the natural lake beds within the Project, Thompson Lake, began to refill. As of 2008, Thompson Lake was a lake within the Project. This compares to the lake's original size of when it was a natural lake. The reborn lake and adjacent wetlands were attractive to waterbirds, with 17 separate species of ducks reported. As of 2009, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's long-range master plan for the Emiquon National Wildlife Refuge including acquiring the Emiquon Project's land, building out the refuge's footprint, and enrolling the new Refuge into the Illinois River National Wildlife Refuge Complex, managed from the Chautauqua National Wildlife Refuge's headquarters in Havana. Current resources The Conservancy's long-range master plan for the Emiquon Project, meanwhile, included restoration of the parcel's natural drainage patterns to the maximum extent possible, including reconstruction of a free-flowing connection between the Illinois River and Thompson Lake. As of 2008, the refilled lakes were stocked with more than 30 species of fish, including largemouth bass, bluegill, bullhead, channel catfish, crappie, and sunfish. Several dozen fish-eating black-crowned night herons had also arrived. In addition to game fish, heritage fish were also planted in Flag Lake and Thompson Lake, such as the state-endangered redspotted sunfish and the state- threatened starhead topminnow. The Conservancy also planned to construct welcome facilities to encourage birdwatchers and other visitors to enjoy the reborn wetland. The Emiquon Project's location, within 40 miles (64 km) of Peoria and adjacent to the established Dickson Mounds museum, was expected to help draw visitors. In April 2008, the University of Illinois at Springfield opened a field station at Emiquon to conduct research and monitor restoration progress.Chris Young, \\"UIS opens field station at Emiquon\\", State Journal- Register, April 26, 2008. Illinois Route 78 and Illinois Route 97 run through the Emiquon Project. The state highways run concurrently in the Project region.

Adrenal cancer is the presence of malignant adrenal tumors, and includes neuroblastoma, adrenocortical carcinoma and some adrenal pheochromocytomas. Most adrenal pheochromocytomas and all adrenocortical adenomas are benign tumors, which do not metastasize or invade nearby tissues, but may cause significant health problems by unbalancing hormones. Metastasis to the adrenals Main sites of metastases for some common cancer types. Primary cancers are denoted by \\"...cancer\\" and their main metastasis sites are denoted by \\"...metastases\\".List of included entries and references is found on main image page in Commons: :File:Metastasis sites for common cancers.svg Lung cancer metastasis to the adrenal glands are mentioned with red arrows. Metastasis to one or both adrenal glands is the most common form of malignant adrenal lesion, and the second most common adrenal tumor after benign adenomas. Last Update: January 20, 2019. Primary tumors in such cases are most commonly from lung cancer (39%), breast cancer (35%), malignant melanoma, gastrointestinal tract cancer, pancreas cancer, and renal cancer. Tumors of the adrenal cortex The adrenal cortex is composed of three distinct layers of endocrine cells which produce critical steroid hormones. These include the glucocorticoids which are critical for regulation of blood sugar and the immune system, as well as response to physiological stress, the mineralcorticoid aldosterone, which regulates blood pressure and kidney function, and certain sex hormones. Both benign and malignant tumors of the adrenal cortex may produce steroid hormones, with important clinical consequences. =Adrenocortical adenoma= Adrenocortical adenomas are benign tumors of the adrenal cortex which are extremely common (present in 1-10% of persons at autopsy). They should not be confused with adrenocortical \\"nodules\\", which are not true neoplasms. Adrenocortical adenomas are uncommon in patients younger than 30 years old, and have equal incidence in both sexes. The clinical significance of these neoplasms is twofold. First, they have been detected as incidental findings with increasing frequency in recent years, due to the increasing use of CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging in a variety of medical settings. This can result in expensive additional testing and invasive procedures to rule out the slight possibility of an early adrenocortical carcinoma. Second, a minority (about 15%) of adrenocortical adenomas are \\"functional\\", meaning that they produce glucocorticoids, mineralcorticoids, and/or sex steroids, resulting in endocrine disorders such as Cushing's syndrome, Conn's syndrome (hyperaldosteronism), virilization of females, or feminization of males. Functional adrenocortical adenomas are surgically curable. Most of the adrenocortical adenomas are less than 2 cm in greatest dimension and less than 50 gram in weight. However, size and weight of the adrenal cortical tumors are no longer considered to be a reliable sign of benignity or malignancy. Grossly, adrenocortical adenomas are encapsulated, well-circumscribed, solitary tumors with solid, homogeneous yellow-cut surface. Necrosis and hemorrhage are rare findings. =Adrenocortical carcinoma= Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare, highly aggressive cancer of adrenal cortical cells, which may occur in children or adults. ACCs may be \\"functional\\", producing steroid hormones and consequent endocrine dysfunction similar to that seen in many adrenocortical adenomas, but many are not. Due to their location deep in the retroperitoneum, most adrenocortical carcinomas are not diagnosed until they have grown quite large. They frequently invade large vessels, such as the renal vein and inferior vena cava, as well as metastasizing via the lymphatics and through the blood to the lungs and other organs. The most effective treatment is surgery, although this is not feasible for many patients, and the overall prognosis of the disease is poor. Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and hormonal therapy may also be employed in the treatment of this disease. Tumors of the Adrenal Medulla The adrenal medulla is located anatomically at the center of each adrenal gland, and is composed of neuroendocrine (chromaffin) cells which produce and release epinephrine (adrenaline) into the bloodstream in response to activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma are the two most important tumors which arise from the adrenal medulla. Both tumors may also arise from extra-adrenal sites, specifically, in the paraganglia of the sympathetic chain. =Neuroblastoma= Neuroblastoma is an aggressive cancer of immature neuroblastic cells (precursors of neurons), and is one of the most common pediatric cancers, with a median age at diagnosis of two years. Adrenal neuroblastoma typically presents with a rapidly enlarging abdominal mass. Although the tumor has often spread to distant parts of the body at the time of diagnosis, this cancer is unusual in that many cases are highly curable when the spread is limited to the liver, skin, and/or bone marrow (stage IVS). Related, but less aggressive tumors composed of more mature neural cells include ganglioneuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma. Neuroblastic tumors often produce elevated levels of catecholamine hormone metabolites, such as vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid, and may produce severe watery diarrhea through production of vasoactive intestinal peptide. Treatment of neuroblastoma includes surgery and radiation therapy for localized disease, and chemotherapy for metastatic disease.Saab ST. and MacLennan GT. \\"Adrenal Cortical Neoplasms: Perspectives in Pediatric Patients\\" in \\"Adrenal Glands: From Pathophysiology to Clinical Evidence\\" Nova Science Publishers, New York, NY - 2015 =Pheochromocytoma= Pheochromocytoma is a neoplasm composed of cells similar to the chromaffin cells of the mature adrenal medulla. Pheochromocytomas occur in patients of all ages, and may be sporadic, or associated with a hereditary cancer syndrome, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types IIA and IIB, neurofibromatosis type I, or von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Only 10% of adrenal pheochromocytomas are malignant, while the rest are benign tumors. The most clinically important feature of pheochromocytomas is their tendency to produce large amounts of the catecholamine hormones epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine. This may lead to potentially life-threatening high blood pressure, or cardiac arrythmias, and numerous symptoms such as headache, palpitations, anxiety attacks, sweating, weight loss, and tremor. Diagnosis is most easily confirmed through urinary measurement of catecholamine metabolites such as VMA and metanephrines. Most pheochromocytomas are initially treated with anti-adrenergic drugs to protect against catecholamine overload, with surgery employed to remove the tumor once the patient is medically stable. Incidentalomas An adrenal incidentaloma is an adrenal tumor found by coincidence without clinical symptoms or suspicion. It is one of the more common unexpected findings revealed by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasonography. In these cases, a dexamethasone suppression test is often used to detect cortisol excess, and metanephrines or catecholamines for excess of these hormones. Tumors under 3 cm are generally considered benign and are only treated if there are grounds for a diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome or pheochromocytoma. Radiodensity gives a clue in estimating malignancy risk, wherein a tumor with 10 Hounsfield units or less on an unenhanced CT is probably a lipid-rich adenoma. Hormonal evaluation includes: * 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test * 24-hour urinary specimen for measurement of fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines * Blood plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity, if hypertension is present On CT scan, benign adenomas typically are of low radiographic density (due to fat content) and show rapid washout of contrast medium (50% or more of the contrast medium washes out at 10 minutes). If the hormonal evaluation is negative and imaging suggests benign, followup should be considered with imaging at 6, 12, and 24 months and repeat hormonal evaluation yearly for 4 years References Further reading  *  External links  Category:Endocrine neoplasia Category:Adrenal gland disorders ","title":"Adrenal tumor"},{"id":"11532898","text":"Robert Lloyd Jackson Robinson (born April 26, 1927), nicknamed \\"Jack\\" or \\"Jackie\\", is a retired American Baptist pastor and theologian and was a college basketball player who competed in the 1948 Summer Olympics.

Awarded the Jack Dempsey outstanding athlete award in 1947, he won a gold medal as an outstanding guard on the 1948 Olympic basketball team in London. During the Olympics he was among a group of athletes who went to Buckingham Palace and were formerly presented to the King, the Queen and the then Queen Mother. Subsequently the BBC broadcast his recollections of the event which included informal meetings with the Princesses Margaret and Elizabeth and later an extended informal conversation with the King during which Robinson corrected the King's misapprehension as to the relative statures of California and Texas. A recording is still extant. Career Between 1953 and 1974, Robinson was minister of First Baptist Church of Augusta, a church of some 3,600 members, where the Southern Baptist Convention was organized in 1845.

In other countries, notable individuals or communities created resistance during the Holocaust which helped the Jews escape some concentration camps. Since 1963, a commission organized by Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority in Israel, and headed by an Israeli Supreme Court justice, has been charged with the duty of awarding people who rescued Jews from the Holocaust the honorary title Righteous Among the Nations. As of January 2007, 21,758 people have received the honor.\\"The Righteous Among the Nations\\", Yad Vashem. Diplomats and people of influence In a few cases, individual diplomats and people of influence, such as Oskar Schindler or Nicholas Winton, protected large numbers of Jews. Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, the Italian Giorgio Perlasca, Chinese consul-general to Austria Ho Feng Shan, and others saved tens of thousands of Jews with fake diplomatic passes. =Sweden= Raoul Wallenberg Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg and his colleagues saved as many as 100,000 Hungarian Jews by providing them with diplomatic passes. =Portugal= Portuguese diplomat Aristides de Sousa Mendes issued 30,000 visas to Jews and other persecuted minorities, though it cost him his career in 1941, when Portuguese dictator Salazar forced him out of his job. He died in poverty in 1954. =Brazil= Brazilian diplomat Luiz Martins de Souza Dantas illegally issued Brazilian diplomatic visas to hundreds of Jews in France during the Vichy Government, saving them from certain death. =Japan= Chiune Sugihara Chiune Sempo Sugihara, Japanese Consul-General in Kaunas, Lithuania, 1939‚Äì1940, issued thousands of visas to Jews fleeing Poland in defiance of explicit orders from the Japanese foreign ministry. The last foreign diplomat to leave Kaunas, Sugihara continued stamping visas from the open window of his departing train. After the war, Sugihara was fired from the Japanese foreign service, ostensibly due to downsizing. In 1985, Sugihara‚Äôs wife and son received the Righteous Among the Nations honor in Jerusalem, on behalf of the ailing Sugihara, who died in 1986. =Iran= Abdol Hossein Sardari, head of the Iranian consulate in Paris during the Nazi occupation, argued successfully with the German authorities that all Iranian citizens, including Persian Jews, be free from harassment and be allowed to leave Nazi territory as they wished. After realising the scale of the Germans' intentions, he also issued hundreds of Iranian passports in his consulate to non-Persian Jews, allowing them to go free. He remained a diplomat until the Iranian revolution, after which he was dismissed and died in poverty. Yad Vashem has honoured him several times. =Vatican City= Although Pope Pius XII did not publicly speak out against the murder of the Jews during the Holocaust, the Vatican did take action to save many Jews in Italy from deportation, including sheltering several hundred Jews in the catacombs of St. Peter's Basilica. In his Christmas addresses of 1941 and 1942, the pontiff was forceful on the topic but did not mention the Nazis by name. The Pope encouraged the bishops to speak out against the Nazi regime and to open the religious houses in their dioceses to hide Jews. In recent years, the Vatican has expressed its remorse for not speaking out with more authority against the genocide. Resistance movements =Germany= A group of German intellectuals calling themselves the White Rose distributed leaflets anonymously from 1942 to 1943 calling for opposition to the Holocaust and Hitler. Seven of them were executed. After the war, the German Democratic Republic attempted to take credit for its own resistance movement. Auschwitz survivor Bruno Baum published a book in East Germany, Widerstand in Auschwitz, claiming that Jewish resistance had been spearheaded by Communist intellectuals, and that he had published a newspaper called Auschwitzer Echo from within Auschwitz itself.Bruno Baum. Widerstand in Auschwitz. Bericht der internationalen antifaschischen Lagerleitung, 1. Aufl.: VVN-Verlag, Potsdam 1949 (55 Seiten; Frontispiz: Josef Cyrankiewicz) These claims are still being investigated.Karin Hartewig. Zur√ºckgekehrt: Die Geschichte der j√ºdischen Kommunisten in der DDR Weimar 2000. pp. 463-465 =Belgium= In April 1943, members of the Belgian resistance held up the twentieth convoy train to Auschwitz, and freed 231 people (115 of whom escaped the Holocaust). =Poland= In Poland in 1939, the Jewish population struggled mightily to obtain weapons. The underground non-Jewish groups at this time did not want to share their weapons with the Jews. This forced them to look elsewhere. In order to obtain weapons at this time they had to find the arms that had been buried by the Polish Army at the time of their downfall. In 1942, a different underground resistance group rose in Poland which was called the Armia Ludowa. The Armia Ludowa or translated to the People‚Äôs Army, was very weak and didn‚Äôt have many weapons at the rise. However, through the next year more and more people started to join. There weren‚Äôt to many Jewish survivors at this time but the few that did survive joined on with the group. The weapons that were used were either brought by peasants or stolen. As stated in the article Jewish Resistance by Yehuda Bauer, weapons were originally from the Soviet Union and were parachuted in. In 1942, the ghetto of Warsaw became a danger zone. The ghetto was destroyed in many places. It all began with the deportation. On July 28, a group called the Jewish Fighters‚Äô Organization was created. This group lacked weapons which was a common theme. They were able to obtain a few pistols and grenades. After a few failed attempts, their weapons were confiscated and the leaders captured. A new underground group was created in January 1943. The assembly of this group had two machine guns, 14 riffles, over 500 handguns and a large amount of homemade grenades. The leader of this underground group was Mordechai Anielwicz, a 23 year old Jewish boy and Ha‚ÄôShomer Ha‚ÄôTzair. The Warsaw ghetto rebellion lasted longer than 6 weeks and were outmanned and outgunned. The Germans were backed by tanks and heavy guns. The Nazis ended the rebellion by setting each building on fire in the ghetto and using poison gas to draw Jews out of bunkers. The group was about 750 Jews that were armed, but also it was a few thousand people who didn‚Äôt have weapons but resisted the Nazis and tried everything in their power to escape. This was the first armed uprising against the Nazis. In Poland during World War 2 there were about 5,000 Jewish fighters and 4,000 of them were killed. Throughout Poland, there were four different rebellions and about 17 places that there were armed resistance groups. There were also groups, such as the Polish ≈ªegota organization, that took drastic and dangerous steps to rescue victims. Witold Pilecki, a member of Armia Krajowa, the Polish Home Army, organized a resistance movement in Auschwitz from 1940, and Jan Karski tried to spread word of the Holocaust. The Polish government-in-exile in London tried to alert the world to the Holocaust. One eyewitness reports that there was a shortwave transmitter hidden in Block 11 of Auschwitz concentration camp which sent information directly to London. Between January 1942 and spring 1943, much of the coverage of the London Dziennik Polski was devoted to exposing the Holocaust, and in late 1943 such topics as concentration camps and medical experiments were described in details. =Italy= In Rome, some 4,000 Italian Jews and prisoners of war avoided deportation, many of them hidden in safe houses or evacuated from Italy by a resistance group organized by an Irish priest, Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty. Once a Vatican ambassador to Egypt, O'Flaherty used his political connections to help secure sanctuary for dispossessed Jews. =The Netherlands= The Dutch Resistance to the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands during World War II can be mainly characterized by its prominent non-violence, submitting in over 300,000 people in hiding in the autumn of 1944, tended to by some 60,000 to 200,000 illegal landlords and caretakers and tolerated knowingly by some 1 million people, including German occupiers and military. =Jews= Jews resisted the Holocaust in both ghettos and in concentration camps. Communities Some towns and churches also helped hide Jews and protect others from the Holocaust, such as the French town of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon which sheltered several thousand Jews. Similar individual and family acts of rescue were repeated throughout Europe, as illustrated in the famous cases of Anne Frank, often at great risk to the rescuers. =Shanghai= Between 1933 and 1941, the Chinese city of Shanghai accepted unconditionally over 30,000 Jewish refugees escaping the Holocaust in Europe, a number greater than those taken in by Shanghai into an area known as the Shanghai ghetto. Some of the Jewish refugees there aided the Chinese resistance against the Japanese. Many of the Jewish refugees in Shanghai migrated to the United States and Israel after 1948 due to the Chinese Civil War. References Category:The Holocaust ","title":"Resistance during the Holocaust"},{"id":"11532988","text":"\\"King Arthur and King Cornwall\\" is an English ballad surviving in fragmentary form in the 17th-century Percy Folio manuscript. An Arthurian story, it was collected by Francis James Child as Child Ballad 30. Unlike other Child Ballads, but like the Arthurian \\"The Boy and the Mantle\\" and \\"The Marriage of Sir Gawain\\", it is not a folk ballad but a professional minstrel's song.Child, p. 298. It is notable for containing the Green Knight, a character known from the medieval poems The Greene Knight and the more famous Sir Gawain and the Green Knight; he appears as \\"Bredbeddle\\", the character's name in The Greene Knight. Synopsis \\"King Arthur and King Cornwall\\" occurs in a damaged section of the Percy Folio; about half of each page was ripped out to start fires.Hahn, p. 420. As such, the ballad is missing about half of its content, though some of the missing material can be deduced from context. Apparently after bragging about the excellence of his famed Round Table, King Arthur is told by Guinevere that another king has an even better one. Arthur and his company leave their kingdom (here Brittany rather than Great Britain) in disguise searching for this king, and eventually come to Cornwall, where the resident monarch offends them with a series of boasts about his magical items, the child he fathered on Guinevere, and Arthur's comparative mediocrity. All go off to bed, and the Knights of the Round Table make a series of vows against Cornwall's boasts, such as Gawain's declaration that he will make off with Cornwall's daughter. Arthur's men discover Cornwall has sent a seven- headed monster, a sprite named Burlow Beanie, to spy on them. Sir Bredbeddle, the Green Knight, wages a long battle against him with a sword from Cologne, a Milanese knife, a Danish axe, and finally a sacred page from the Christian Bible gives him the upper hand. As a test of his control over the creature, he orders him to fetch a horse. Though Burlow Beanie obeys, he rebels when another knight, Marramile, tries to control him, and the Green Knight is called in to help. A missing section likely described Arthur's men taking possession of Cornwall's other magical objects and learning the secret of their use from the sprite. The remaining text describes Arthur beheading King Cornwall with his own sword; the final missing half page likely described his triumph. Analysis The story resembles Geoffrey Chaucer's \\"The Squire's Tale\\" from the Canterbury Tales, the English romance Sir LaunfalHahn, p. 419. and especially the Carolingian romance P√®lerinage de Charlemagne,Noble, p. 262. in which Charlemagne and his paladins visit the Byzantine Emperor, superior to Charlemagne in looks according to Charlemagne's wife. They make a series of boasts about their abilities, and are called out on them by the emperor's spy, but are eventually able to fulfill them with help from God. Making chivalric vows is a central theme in the medieval English tale The Avowing of Arthur, while the importance of keeping one's pledges is important to tales like Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle. \\"King Arthur and King Cornwall\\" may be a version of a lost medieval story, but it is also possible that it is a product of the 17th century, taking hints from older chivalric romance. The character of Bredbeddle makes the author's knowledge of The Greene Knight obvious; whether made in the 16th century or before, the ballad relies on the audience's knowledge of the Gawain romances popular since the 12th century. Gawain's promise to have his way with Cornwall's daughter is in accordance with his womanizing portrayal in certain Old French works. The magician-king of Cornwall does not appear in other Arthurian romance. In other stories, Cornwall is ruled by either Arthur's cousin Cador, or by King Mark, the uncle of Tristan and husband of Iseult. Equally unique is Cornwall's daughter, whom he had fathered on Guinevere behind Arthur's back. Several Arthurian staple characters do make appearances, such as Guinevere, Gawain, and Tristan.As \\"Tristeram\\". See Hahn, p. 431.

Spring Garden is a neighborhood that combines diverse residential neighborhoods and significant cultural attractions. The residential areas on the north side of the neighborhood (North of Spring Garden Street) are composed mostly of brick and brownstone three-story townhouses built during the mid-to-late 19th century. The houses include townhouses in the Italianate style, Second Empire, Queen Anne, and Venetian Gothic. Many streets (including Green Street and Spring Garden Street) include \\"terraced\\" set ups, which include a small gardened plot, often raised, in front of the house. The residential areas to the south are dominated by taller, multi-family buildings built during the 20th century. The museum area, also to the south of Spring Garden Street, includes the Rodin Museum, the Central Library of Philadelphia, and the Barnes Museum. Boundaries 19th & North, just south of Fairmount Avenue FinkelFinkel 1995:168. defines Spring Garden as \\"North of Benjamin Franklin Parkway to Fairmount Avenue, Broad Street to Schuylkill River.\\" The Philadelphia Information Locator Service listPhiladelphia Information Locator Service: Philadelphia Neighborhoods and Place Names. (augmented from the Finkel 1995 list), repeats Finkel's definition of the neighborhood's boundaries. One qualification that should be added is that this definition would have Spring Garden as extending deep into Center City, nearly all the way to City Hall. The other boundary that most would agree Finkel omitted is Vine Street. The Spring Garden Civic Association limits its purview to only the northern half of the above definition, as \\"between Spring Garden Street and Fairmount Avenue and between Broad Street and Pennsylvania Avenue/Fairmount Park.\\" The neighborhood's main arterial road is Spring Garden Street, running east to west. Demographics Spring Garden is within the 19130 ZIP code, which also includes Fairmount and Francisville. The 2000 census reported that the population within the 19130 ZIP code is 22,252. The racial composition of Spring Garden was 60% white, 30% African American, 3% Asian, and 7% Hispanic. Ten years later, the population of the 19130 ZIP code had increased by 10% to 24,870, an increase in population of 2,618, with a racial composition of 68.1% white, 21.4% black, and 5.6% Asian. Before the neighborhood was incorporated into the city of Philadelphia in 1854, the city of Spring Garden peaked at ninth on the list of the largest cities in the United States during the 1850 Census. History 1903 plan of Baldwin Locomotive Works. The neighborhood was originally part of the Northern Liberties, a township to the north of the city (which at that time was distinct from the other townships and municipalities within the County of Philadelphia). It was originally part of a manor (named Spingettsbury Farm) established by William Penn. During the late 1700s, the manor was split into two estates-\\"Bush Hill\\" (located to the east of 19th Street) and \\"The Hills\\" (located to the west of 19th Street). In the early 1800s, the estates were subdivided, and from 1850 to 1876, housing was developed in alignment with the city grid that had originally been established by William Penn. The neighborhood name is quite old, going back many decades before Philadelphia's Act of Consolidation, when the area was part of the Spring Garden District of Philadelphia County, not yet part of the city. Finkel gives 1808 as the year it first appears in the written sources that he and his contributors consulted. The Philadelphia Information Locator Service list (augmented from the Finkel 1995 list), while repeating Finkel's definition of the neighborhood's boundaries, gives 1813 as the earliest year of use. The neighborhood was once home to significant heavy industry. Many blocks of the neighborhood were once covered by the Baldwin Locomotive Works. Various Bement-related machine tool firms (William Bement & Son; Bement, Miles & Co; and then Niles-Bement-Pond) occupied the site where the Barnes Foundation museum now stands. Infrastructure and government =City government= The Spring Garden neighborhood is in the 15th Ward and the 8th Ward.

The Philadelphia and Reading right-of-way, cut down below street level, is abandoned to woods in one portion and serves as parking in another. Several bus routes and a subway route connect the neighborhood to Center City and other city neighborhoods. Broad Street subway On the east side of the neighborhood, the subway connects the neighborhood to North Philadelphia (for example, Temple University), City Hall, Walnut Street, and the Sports Complex.

Recorded after they were denied the opportunity to record another Blackwell song, \\"Don't Be Cruel\\", \\"You're the Apple of My Eye\\" was The Four Lovers' first exposure to U.S. national publicity, reaching the #62 position on the Billboard Hot 100 and earning the quartet an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. One of two Four Lovers singles that RCA Victor Records released simultaneously, it was the quartet's only foray onto the Hot 100 before the formation of The Four Seasons five years later. Background The Four Lovers (1956 personnel: Frankie Valli, Nick and Tommy DeVito, and Hank Majewski) was the eventual result of Valli joining The Variety Trio in 1954 to form The Variatones (which briefly included mutual friends on a part-time basis). The group performed at various New Jersey clubs and lounges and established a reputation for its musical versatility, incorporating country music, pop music, doo wop, Broadway standards, rhythm and blues, and an occasional foray into Italian love songs. An RCA Records executive saw a Four Lovers performance and was impressed with the presentation enough to recommend the quartet to the company's artists and repertoire department. They were signed to the RCA Victor label for a series of records to be released in 1956 and 1957. In May 1956, \\"You're the Apple of My Eye\\"/\\"The Girl of My Dreams\\" and \\"Lovey Dovey\\"/\\"Please Don't Love Me\\" were released simultaneously by RCA. The four sides were recorded in a single April session (with two other songs that were released as a single in January 1957). \\"You're the Apple of My Eye\\"/\\"The Girl of My Dreams\\" RCA Victor 47-6518. \\"You're the Apple of My Eye\\" was a last-minute substitution for another song that Frankie Valli and the group was preparing to do in the recording session, \\"Don't Be Cruel\\". Accounts differ as to the precise mechanism behind their not recording the Otis Blackwell song. Some sources indicate that The Four Lovers were told not to record the song as Elvis Presley expressed a desire to record the song himself; other sources indicate that Blackwell himself requested that the Four Lovers not record the song so he could \\"shop around\\" for a bigger act (and a better royalty deal) for the song (and succeeded when Presley's manager approached Blackwell with the idea of Presley recording \\"Don't Be Cruel\\"). Blackwell later apologized for \\"taking the song away from\\" The Four Lovers and offered a different original composition for the quartet to record. Produced by Blackwell, \\"You're the Apple of My Eye\\" was composed as a \\"traditional\\" rhythm-and-blues song, but the Four Lovers gave it more of a rock'n'roll interpretation (some music critics referred to it as so \\"over the top\\" as to be close in style to burlesque). The single was the group's first venture into national publicity, with sales and airplay sufficient for the record to enter the Hot 100 and to generate enough interest for Ed Sullivan to invite the group onto his weekly television program. \\"Apple of My Eye\\" was the only Four Lovers Single to achieve chart status as the other six successive singles sank without a trace in 1956 and 1957. After the Four Lovers became The Four Seasons in 1961, \\"You're the Apple of My Eye\\" was re-recorded (as \\"Apple of My Eye\\") for the Sherry and 11 Others album (1962). The re-recording was released as a single in October 1964 and appeared briefly on the Billboard Bubbling Under the Hot 100 record chart. The B-side of The Four Lovers single, \\"The Girl of My Dreams\\", is a cover of a song composed by Maxwell Davis, Joe Josea, Jules Taub, and Sam Ling. Jessie Belvin and Eugene Church recorded and released a recording of the song in 1956 as The Cliques. \\"Honey Love\\"/\\"Please Don't Leave Me\\" RCA Victor 47-6519. Released the same day as \\"You're the Apple of My Eye\\", The Four Lovers' second single featured covers of two rhythm-and-blues hits from the mid-1950s. The A-side, \\"Honey Love\\", was a considerable R&B; hit for The Drifters in 1956. It was composed by Drifters lead singer Clyde McPhatter and Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler. The Four Lovers' version was similar in style to the original, but didn't come close to attaining the level of success of either the original or \\"You're the Apple of Your Eye\\". The B-side of the group's second single, \\"Please Don't Leave Me\\", was composed by Antoine \\"Fats\\" Domino and was originally recorded by him in 1953. It is one of the more blues-based songs in the Fats Domino catalog  and one of the most blues-based songs ever recorded by Frankie Valli and his friends, regardless of the name or membership of the group. After \\"Apple\\" and \\"Honey\\" The management or RCA Victor and The Four Lovers were encouraged by the success of \\"You're the Apple of My Eye\\" to make arrangements for recording an album for release for Christmas sales. The result, Joyride, had a collection of rhythm-and-blues and western covers, with a few pop standards and a handful of never-before-released songs, complete with a rollicking version of \\"White Christmas\\", patterned similar to the Drifters' version from 1955. In addition, RCA was releasing Four Lovers' singles roughly every two weeks, including covers of Hank Williams' \\"Jambalaya\\", Faye Adams' \\"Shake a Hand\\", and an early vocal version of \\"Night Train\\". Joyride and the last five RCA Victor Four Lovers singles failed to chart and failed to sell. Today, they are collector's items, with the album being worth up to $400 (US) in near mint condition and some of the singles at roughly one-third that. The group's last single, \\"My Life for You Love\\"/\\"Pucker Up\\", sold so few that the relative handful of existing copies are now selling for up to $3000 each. By the end of 1957, The Four Lovers had no recording contract and returned to performing in clubs and lounges before being put \\"on hiatus\\", albeit briefly before a new artists contract with Bob Crewe's Peri Records gave the group a new purpose for its existence, that of supporting musicians with the occasional opportunity to record songs on their own (which they did  and release under a variety of names between 1958 and 1961). This began a sequence of events which, in four years, resulted in the group becoming The Four Seasons.

It first aired in the NBC Saturday morning lineup on November 24, 1973, and was written by American actress and screenwriter Joyce Perry.This story was expanded into a novelette by science-fiction author Alan Dean Foster as part of the collection, Star Trek Log Four (1975) (). In this episode, Captain Kirk must cooperate with distrusted Klingons to escape a \\"Sargasso Sea\\" of dead starships. The episode introduces the first example of a Starfleet starship other than a Constitution-class ship: the USS Bonaventure, which is said to be the \\"first ship to have warp drive installed\\" in the episode. The ship is never referenced in live-action Star Trek, although it is the name of Zephram Cochrane's ship in the non-canonical novel Federation by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens. Plot On stardate 5267.2, while exploring the Delta Triangle, where many starships have disappeared, the Federation starship Enterprise is attacked by several Klingon vessels. During the battle they are caught in an ion storm. The Enterprise and one Klingon battlecruiser are drawn into a spacetime vortex and end up in a timeless dimension in what could only be called a graveyard for space vessels. Captain Kirk and his crew are shocked to find \\"that the descendants of the crews of these various vessels are still alive\\" and have formed a government, calling themselves 'The Elysian Council.' The crew discovers that the timewarp will gradually disintegrate the Enterprises dilithium crystals. Their only means of escape is to link their ship with the Klingons' and their commander KorKor is portrayed in both the Original Series and Deep Space Nine by actor John Colicos but is voiced here by Star Trek regular James Doohan. and try to power themselves out of the vortex.  Reception  In their book TrekNavigator: The Ultimate Review Guide to the Entire Trek Saga, Mark A. Altman and Ed Gross commented that while the \\"Bermuda Triangle of space\\" theme is somewhat fanciful, \\"the resulting cooperation between the Klingons and the Enterprise is adeptly done.\\" However, they judged Nichelle Nichols and James Doohan's work in multiple roles to be unsatisfactory, and found the Klingons' betrayal predictable.Mark A. Altman & Ed Gross, TrekNavigator: The Ultimate Review Guide to the Entire Trek Saga, BackBay Books, 1998. pp.243-4 In 2017, Tor.com rated this episode 5 out 10, noting Nichelle Nichols voices three characters and appearance of Klingon characters and spacecraft.

Alicia Domon, Caty, (September 23, 1937 ‚Äì December 17 or 18, 1977) was a Roman Catholic religious sister from France who was one of two French nationals in Argentina to be \\"disappeared\\" in December 1977 by the military dictatorship of the National Reorganization Process. She was among a dozen people associated with the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a human rights group, who were kidnapped and taken to the secret detention center at ESMA. According to witnesses who saw her there, over a period of about 10 days she was interrogated and tortured, forced to write a letter claiming participation in guerrilla group opposing the government, and photographed in a staged setting in front of a Montoneros banner. That group of detainees, including Sister L√©onie Duquet, was \\"transferred\\", a euphemism for being taken out and killed. Bodies washed up on beaches south of Buenos Aires in December 1977 and were quickly buried in mass graves, but a March 1978 Agence France-Presse article reported that the bodies of the missing two French nuns and others associated with the Mothers were believed to have been among them. In 2000, a small plaza in Buenos Aires was named \\"Hermana Alice Domon y Hermana Leonie Duquet,\\" in honor of the sisters. Their lives are celebrated in an annual commemoration at the Santa Cruz church of San Cristobal, where they had worked and where the remains of Duquet and several Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo are buried. In 2011, Alfredo Astiz, who had infiltrated the Mothers of the Plaza and organized the abduction of the twelve in December 1977, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for that and other crimes against humanity. For his torturing at ESMA, he had been nicknamed \\"The Blond Angel of Death.\\" Life Alice Domon was born in Charquemont in France's Doubs region. As a girl she entered the Paris Foreign Missions Society. It invited her to Argentina in 1967, where she lived in Hurlingham and Mor√≥n, of the industrial corridor of Buenos Aires. She taught catechism to handicapped persons and worked with the poor. Domon was a member of a group directed by Father Ismael Calcagno, first cousin of Jorge Rafael Videla, the dictator in power from 1976 to 1981, at the time of both the kidnapping and the murder. Alice Domon was assigned there along with L√©onie Duquet, a French religious sister with whom she established a deep friendship.Seoane, Mar√≠a (2001), El dictador, Buenos Aires: Sudamericana Domon was dedicated to her social work with the inhabitants of shanty towns.

In December 1977, Sisters Alice and L√©onie, along with the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo and other human rights activists, prepared a request for the names of those who disappeared and for the government to divulge their whereabouts. The reply was publicized in the newspaper La Naci√≥n on December 10, 1977, the same day Alice Domon disappeared.

Alice Domon and most of the women were abducted from the Church of Santa Cruz, where the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo used to meet. It is located in the San Crist√≥bal district within the city of Buenos Aires. Sister Alice was taken directly to the secret detention center in the Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics (ESMA), under the control of the Argentina Navy. She was said to be have been put in detention wearing a hood that cut off all sight. She was held for approximately 10 days, during which she was constantly tortured and interrogated. Horacio Domingo Maggio and Lisandro Ra√∫l Cubas, survivors of detention at the ESMA, related what they knew on the subject in testimony to the national commission in 1985: > The same thing happened to the French nuns Alice Domon and Leonie Ren√©e > Duquet. I had the chance to speak with Sister Alice personally, she had > already been taken along with Sister Ren√©e to the third floor of the > Officers' Mess in the ESMA, that was where I found her captive. This > happened around December 11 or 12. I remember that was when she had been > kidnapped at the church. I was soon aware of 13 people; the Sisters were > weak and badly beaten; Alice already needed two guards to carry and maintain > her in the bathroom.

(Testimony of Lisandro Ra√∫l Cubas, File > #6794). As the two Catholic sisters, L√©onie Duquet and Alice Domon, were French nationals, their \\"disappearances\\" generated an international scandal, especially with France, which repeatedly tried to trace what had happened to them. The Argentine government was unresponsive to their inquiries. The Army Chief and Junta Member Emilio Massera tried to make it appear as if both nuns had been kidnapped by the Montoneros leftist guerrilla organization. To this end, officers forced Domon under torture to write a letter to her superior in her order, in French, saying that she had been abducted by a group opposed to the administration of General Jorge Videla. The torturers took a picture of the two nuns seated in front of a Montoneros flag and sent it to a national newspaper. In the photograph, taken in the basement of the ESMA, the two women showed obvious physical signs of torture; copies were sent to the French press. On December 15, 1977, La Naci√≥n published a notice from the EFE news agency entitled \\"Vivas y con buena salud\\" (Alive and in good health). The article reported that the Mother Superior of the Congregation in France said that the Sisters L√©onie and Alice had been detained but remained alive and in good health. She said the information came from the Papal Nuncio in Argentina.\\"Vivas y con buena salud\\", La Naci√≥n, 15 December 1977 Either on December 17 or December 18, 1977, the two Sisters and the rest of their group were trasladadas (\\"transferred\\": a euphemism used by the military when murdering dissidents) to the military airport in Buenos Aires. They were put in a Marine plane and thrown out of the plane while still alive, landing in the sea off the coast of Santa Teresita, where they died as soon as they hit the water. As an example of the humor of the marines linked with the repression during the Guerra Sucia or Dirty War, they occasionally made reference to the \\"flying nuns,\\" making an association with a contemporary United States TV series.\\"Tecnolog√≠a, tenacidad y una muestra de sangre tra√≠da de Francia en secreto\\", Clar√≠n, 30 August 2005 Later prosecution of crimes After democracy was restored, the government held a national commission to collect testimony from survivors about desaparacedos and treatment at the hands of military and security forces. In 1985, the government tried the top former officers of the military in the Trial of the Juntas. Investigations had been made of hundreds of other officers. Under threat of a military coup, the Congress passed legislation known as the \\"Pardon Laws\\" in 1986 and 1987, ending prosecution and establishing a kind of amnesty for acts on both sides during the Dirty War. During this period, in 1990, Captain Alfredo Astiz was convicted in France of kidnapping Duquet and Domon, and sentenced in absentia to life in prison by the Appellate Court in Paris. At that time, the bodies of the two women had not been found, so he could not be charged with murder.\\"Francia entreg√≥ las pruebas con las que conden√≥ a Astiz\\", Clar√≠n, 3 April 2006Agence France-Presse, \\"L√©onie Duquet, mission√°ria francesa, v√≠tima do anjo louro da morte\\" (Leonie Duquet, French missionary, victim of the 'Blond Angel of Death'\\"), Ultimo Noticias, 29 August 2005, , accessed 10 June 2013 In 2003 during the administration of President Nestor Kirchner, Congress repealed the Pardon Laws. The Argentine Supreme Court ruled they were unconstitutional, and the government re-opened cases of war crimes during the Dirty War. In 2006 Miguel Etcholatz was the first former officer convicted and sentenced to life in a new series of trials. Prosecutions continued. Astiz also went to trial. On October 27, 2011, Alfredo Astiz was convicted by an Argentinian court and sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity committed during the Dirty War., Latin America, BBC In 2012 an Argentinian prosecutor filed charges against the Dutch-Argentinian pilot Julio Poch for flying the navy plane which supposedly dumped Domon, Duquet and three other women into the Atlantic Ocean.Latin American Herald Tribune ‚Äì Argentine Denies Taking Part in Dirty War-Era ‚ÄúDeath Flights‚Äù, November 27, 2012 Evidence in later prosecutions After the restoration of democracy in 1984, the investigations of the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons and the 1985 Trial of the Juntas led to the exhuming of graves in the cemetery of General Lavalle, searching for evidence related to war crimes. Skeletal remains were found belonging to some cadavers found in 1977 and later on the beaches of San Bernardo and Lucila del Mar. The remains were used in the trial against the Juntas and then stored in sixteen bags. From that point on, Judge Horacio Cattani began to accumulate cases about desaparecidos. Passage in 1986 and 1987 of the Ley de Punto Final and the Ley de Obediencia Debida, respectively, caused an end to the investigation. By 1995, Cattani had collected an archive of 40 square meters containing potential answers to questions about the missing bodies. In July 2005, the Chief of Police of General Lavalle informed Cattani that they had identified more unmarked graves in the town cemetery. Judge Cattani ordered that new excavations be carried out by the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team, who discovered two rows of graves side-by-side. They found eight skeletons: five female, two male, and one uncertain (classified as \\"probably male\\"). As a result of forensic DNA studies in August 2005, the five female remains were found to belong to five of the women captured between December 8 and 10, 1977: Azucena Villaflor, Mar√≠a Ponce de Bianco, Esther Ballestrino de Careaga, Angela Auad, and Sister L√©onie Duquet. All of them have since been buried in the garden of the Santa Cruz church in Buenos Aires.\\"Inhumaron los restos de la monja francesa L√©onie Duquet\\", Clar√≠n, September 25, 2005 No evidence has been found for the remains of Alice Domon. United States government internal reports  Secret government documents from the United States Government declassified in 2002 show that the US Ambassador to Argentina advised the State Department in March 1978 that bodies washed up on beaches of Buenos Aires Province likely included those of missing French nationals, the nuns Alice Domon and L√©onie Duquet; as well as three founders of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo: Azucena Villaflor, Esther Ballestrino and Mar√≠a Ponce, and two other mothers. As noted in the memo, this was based on reports by Agence France-Presse, published in French and international papers on March 28, 1978, and a reliable source within the government. Apparently this information was kept secret. This is documented in formerly classified Document #1978-BUENOS-02346 written by the former U.S. Ambassador to Argentina, Ra√∫l Castro, to the Secretary of State of the United States, dated March 30, 1978, with the subject line \\"Report of nuns death\\".

It has been introduced into Madagascar where it grows in a subhumid climate at an altitude of about 500‚Äì1000 m above sea level. Genetic sequence analysis has shown its closest relative is Acacia koa of Hawaii; the estimated time of divergence is about 1.4 million years ago. A. heterophylla sequences nest within those of the more diverse A. koa, making the latter species paraphyletic. Both species are descended from an ancestral species in Australia, presumably their sister species, Acacia melanoxylon; the means of dispersal to Hawaii and then to R√©union (the latter trip a distance of 18,000 km) is thought to have been seed-carrying by birds such as petrels (the seeds of these species are not adapted for prolonged immersion in seawater).
