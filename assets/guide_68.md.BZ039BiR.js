It was designed by John Warby and built in 1816. It is also known as Warbys Barn and Warbys Stables, The Leumeah Barn, Leumeah Barn Restaurant and Campbelltown Motor Inn. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Campbelltown Permanent European settlement in the Campbelltown area had begun in 1809 as an alternative to the flood-prone Hawkesbury district. Work on a road from Sydney to Liverpool was started in 1811. It was opened in August 1814 and was soon extended further south to Appin. This road, variously known as Campbelltown Road, Appin Road or the Sydney Road, passed through Campbelltown. The section through the town was called the High Street until the last decade of the 19th century when it was renamed Queen Street.Orwell & Peter Phillips, 1995, vol.2, 1-2. The land on which the Queen Street cottages stand was part of a grant of to Joseph Phelps in 1816. He had been working the land for some years before receiving formal title to it. Phelps was one of the farmers of Airds and Appin who subscribed funds for a Sydney courthouse in July 1813. His grant was seized, possibly as soon as it was formally issued, by the Provost Marshal, William Gore in lieu of payment by Phelps of debts totalling 170 pounds. The land was auctioned in January 1817 to William Bradbury for 100 pounds plus twelve cattle and the grain produced from the crop growing on the land. Immediately north of Phelps' grant, Assistant Surveyor James Meehan had informally reserved for a village (AMCG, 1994 say \\"in 1815\\".) In 1816 most of the land in the area was granted, leaving a portion of unalienated, and surrounded by several grants.AMCG, 1994, 9. The reserved land was formally declared a town by Governor Macquarie in December 1820 and named Campbelltown in honour of his wife (Elizabeth)'s family. William Bradbury (1774-1836) a native of Birmingham, was transported to NSW aboard the \\"Guildford\\" in 1812. His wife Elizabeth remained in England but his daughter, Mary (1797-1852) followed her father to Australia in 1815. Bradbury had no other children in NSW, though he established a relationship with a woman named Alice and in April 1836 married a Campbelltown widow, Catherine Patrick, n√©e Acres (c.1801-1883). Bradbury died two months later. Governor Macquarie visited Campbelltown in January 1822. He and his party ate a \\"hearty\\" breakfast at 'Bradbury's', indicating that Bradbury had built an inn. This was probably the inn later known as the Royal Oak, on the western side of the High Street. Macquarie noted in his journal that 'Bradbury is building a very good two storey brick house on his own farm and on a very pretty eminence immediately adjoining Campbell-Town as an inn for the accommodation of the public, and having asked me to give his farm a name, I have called it Bradbury Park. In 1826 Bradbury Park House was considered by William Dumaresq, inspector of roads and bridges, as the best building in Campbelltown when he reported on buildings suitable for military use. As the main street of Campbelltown, High Street or Sydney Road and later Queen Street, was at the edge of town, one side of the street was not within the town boundary while the other was. Canny traders soon realised that either side of the main road was as good as the other and leased or bought land from the grantees bordering the town proper. By the 1840s more than a few shops and hotels occupied the western side of the High Street. The coming of the railway in 1858 also aided in securing the commercial focus of the town on Queen Street. The Queen Street terraces were identified by Helen Baker (Proudfoot) in the early 1960s as a unique group of two-storey late Georgian vernacular buildings which were considered to form the only surviving late-1840s streetscape within the County of Cumberland. The buildings were acquired by the Cumberland County Council and its successors, the State Planning Authority and Department of Planning, to ensure their preservation. Warby's Barn The barn, before its conversion into flats John Warby (1744? - 1851), a convict, explorer and later farmer was convicted at Hertford England on 3 March 1791 and sentenced to transportation for seven years. He reached Sydney in February 1792 in the ship, \\"Pitt\\". On 12 September 1796 he married another convict, Sarah Bentley (1780-1869) who had arrived in the Indispensable in April 1796 at Parramatta. They had nine sons and five daughters. One of the sons, John Warby was the first settler in the North Gundagai area. Warby settled on at Prospect after his sentence expired. In 1803 he was appointed stockman of the wild cattle at large in the Cowpastures. Warby became well known as an explorer and guide in the Camden area and Burragorang Valley, leading Governor Macquarie and his party from Prospect Hill through the Cowpastures in November 1810 and again in October 1815 on an expedition along the Nattai River. In June 1816 and at the age of 49, he was rewarded for his public services with a grant of at Campbelltown. In the same year Warby built the first three rooms of Leumeah House, the stables and the barn. Further work to the main house using sandstock bricks was subsequently done in 1826. At one time there were no less than 40 servants housed in the stables to service the needs of the Warby establishment, At age 84 John Warby died on 12 June 1851. Sarah Warby lived on at Campbelltown and died there on 19 October 1869.Australian Dictionary of Biography. Leumeah House was demolished in 1963, but the barn and stables associated with the farmstead survived. In 1962 Mr John Feeney purchased The Leumeah Barn (Warby's Barn) and Warbys Stables which were now in a derelict condition. Feeney restored and renovated the building converting it into a residence. In completing the work care was taken not to alter the exterior of the building and to retain many of the original features such as the fireplace, half log roof beams, the carriage arch and the window and door openings.Feeney, 2012. In 1979 Feeney sold the property and the barn was converted into a block of flats and the stables into a restaurant called Sids Leumeah Barn Restaurant. During 1985 the Heritage Council received community strong representation expressing concern for the future of Warby's Barn and Warby's Stable. On 24 March 1985 the Heritage Council recommended the placing of an Interim Heritage Order over Warby's Barn and Warby's Stable. An Interim Heritage Order was placed on 31 May 1985. The order was placed to provide time for further inquiry and investigation to determine whether it was necessary to warrant the making of a Permanent Conservation Order. On 26 June 1985 the Heritage Council approved, subject to conditions, the conversion of Warby's Barn to a Motor Inn. On 25 November 1986 the Heritage Council recommended placing a Permanent Conservation order over Warby's Barn and Warby's Stable. Public notice was given of the proposal to place a Permanent Conservation Order. The Heritage Council received an objection to the extent of the listing. To ensure continued protection a second Interim Conservation Order was placed 22 May 1987. Following discussion with the owner of Warby's Barn and Warby's Stable an adjustment to the proposed boundary of the Permanent Conservation Order was made. The objection to the Permanent Conservation Order was subsequently withdrawn. The Permanent Conservation order was placed on 22 January 1988. Warby's Barn and Warby's Stable was listed on the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. By 2011 after being empty for a number of years Warbys Barn was converted into a health centre.  Description  Both buildings are simple sandstone structures rectangular in shape with gable roofs. The barn had large central arched openings in front and rear and symmetrically placed patterned ventilation gaps in the stonework. These have been removed through the insertion of windows and doorways. The stables are less altered. Porches have been added to both buildings.Branch Managers Report to the Heritage Council, 24 April 1985.  Condition  As at 14 March 2001, archaeological potential is high.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 22 October 2012, the Leumeah Barn (Warby's Barn) and Warby's Stable are significant remains of one of the earliest farms of the Campbelltown district. Their strong historical associations with the district's evolution and settlement pattern are reinforced by their location within a suburb names after Leumeah House. Warbys Barn & Stables was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

In 2008, the company submitted several patents related to matching caller data with computer models, which were granted in 2014. In late 2016, the company confidentially filed for a potential future initial public offering (IPO). Around that time, Afiniti also introduced software to run phone numbers \\"through a variety of databases prior to when a call center agent picks up the phone.\\" The system referred to around 100 databases to gather information on callers, including from public profiles such as Twitter. According to Fortune, the system operated on \\"the idea that it's possible, using thousands of call records, to determine which agents perform best with certain type of customers.\\" 2017‚Äì2018 According to The Wall Street Journal, by January 2017, the company had installed its artificial intelligence software in around 150 call centers for several dozen companies, among them Caesars Entertainment Corporation and Sprint. By April 2017, the company had been valued at $1.6 billion and had board members such as John W. Snow and Jos√© Maria Aznar. That month, the company closed a fourth round of venture funding, bringing in $80 million from investors such as GAM, McKinsey & Co, Elisabeth Murdoch, and John Browne. The round brought the company's total funding raised since its inception to $100 million. Afiniti signed a deal with Huawei in September 2017 and Avaya in April 2018.

It housed the shop of William Bursill, auctioneer. 298 Coaching House has a sturdy verandah, supported by cast iron Ionic columns. The central opening on the ground floor closed by wooden gates indicates an entrance to the stables that were at its rear (Carroll, 1983, 35-36). Old Railway Hotel (288-290 Queen Street) The land was originally under the subdivision for Bradbury Park Estate owned by Mary and George Cannon, it was the southern half of Lot 22. In October 1844, Mary and George Cannon sold the land to John Hilt a coachman from Sydney for ¬£30. In August 1845 John Hilt sold his land to John Doyle, blacksmith and wheelwright of Campbelltown and at this time there was no evidence of buildings. Doyle and his family owned the land until 1908. Between the years of 1844 and 1856 the Doyle family built a two-storey building, and in 1856 it was first licensed by the licensee Sylvester Byrne who has transferred the license from The Sportsman's Arms in Campbelltown. It was documented that Byrne rented from Doyle. He however became bankrupt so could no longer rent the building. At this stage the building contained a bar, two parlours, a dining room, three bedrooms, smaller room with bed and a well equipped kitchen. Doyle took over the license of Byrne, and the hotel was later run by Thomas James who during his management converted the wooden coach house into a music and dance hall. After Doyle died he passed the estate on to his children, and in 1896 it was still known as Doyles Railway Hotel. In 1896 and extensive collection of out buildings were constructed. A coach builder operated from the premises. They may have also been used by the Doyle brothers who operated businesses of both blacksmiths and undertakers during the 1890s. Nicholas Doyle (John Doyle's son) died in 1907 and his sister Annie Doyle sold the property and others to Edwin and William Fieldhouse, storekeepers in 1908. They had various mortgages over Doyle's property since 1904, and had not been repaid. Between 1908 and 1921 the hotel is possibly let to various occupants. In 1921 it was sold to Cecilia and Henry Meredith. In 1943 sold to Mr. J. L. Froggatt who renamed the building \\"Bonito\\", the building then became \\"Bonito Flats\\" and divided for residential accommodation.Higginbotham, 1995, pg. 9-11 Lagacy House (292-294 Queen Street) The land was originally lot 23 of the Bradbury Park Estate. In October 1844, Mary and George Cannon and their mortgage holder, John Smith sold this block of land consisting of 1 rood 24 perches and for the purchase price of ¬£45 to William Bursill an auctioneer from Campbelltown.Orwell & Peter Phillips, 1995, vol.2, 9-11 The shop at 292-4 evolved from a small stone two storey structure to a large stone building.Carroll, 1983, 35-6 William Bursill in the 1840s was able to afford to construct a substantial building considering that during this time the depression was affecting the majority of Australia. From this building Bursill ran a tannery in conjunction with a boot shop. Bursill sold his portion of the land to the Campbelltown postmaster William Fowler in October 1850. The selling price increased from ¬£45 to ¬£375 in the space of six years. This demonstrates how substantial the buildings on the land were. It is also suggested that Fowler rented the buildings for a period between 1846 and when he purchased it, using it for the Post Office. In 1879 the post office was taken over by Fowlers sons and at this time Fowler also offered to sell the building which consisted of thick stone walls, the ground floor was the shop and had four rooms with another six rooms upstairs. There was a separate kitchen and pantry and storeroom in brick and stone, and out side there was a stable and coach house. The selling price in 1879 was ¬£1,450. In 1881 the store was sold for a price of ¬£1,050 with a mortgage of ¬£550 to Joseph Atkinson, an innkeeper. Atkinson was one of the first aldermen elected to Campbelltown Council (established 1882). A ten-room shop and residence was occupied by S. Fisher and had a value of ¬£50 per annum on the premises and a smaller three room shop valued at ¬£50 per annum was occupied by W. Price. By October 1886, Joseph Atkinson had become a publican at Windsor, and the premises were sold to James Wilson a butcher for ¬£675, there had been no changes to the block. James Wilson (Scottish) was partners in business with Daniel Fowler (son in law of Bursill). Wilson owned other land in Campbelltown. The 1891 Census showed the householder as Thomas Gamble, it also indicated the building was the store and home of Gamble. Thomas Gamble was also the Mayor of Campbelltown in 1895. James Wilson died in 1912 and the estate was left to his widow Helen. The premises were given in 1912 by Helen Wilson to George Chinnocks, storekeeper for ten shillings. Chinnocks had been a butcher in Campbelltown in the 1890s end expanded to a general store keeper by 1912. The building at the time was called Stanwell House and known also as Chinnocks Newsagency. Chinnocks died in 1938. The building was inherited by Georgina Highfield n√©e Campbell and her son Norman and electrician. The ownership title was confirmed in 1946. The estate was sold to the State Planning Authority in 1964 for ¬£12,000. In 1969 architect John Fisher (member of the Institute of Architects, the Cumberland County Council Historic Buildings Committee and on the first Council of the National Trust of Australia (NSW) after its reformation in 1960) was commissioned by the State Planning Authority to restore the first five houses in Campbelltown, which had been resumed under the Cumberland County Planning Scheme. They included Glenalvon House.Lucas & McGinness, 2012.

Cast iron Ionic columns support the sturdy verandah. Architect Morton Herman restored the building in 1964.CCC, undated 7  Heritage listing  The Queen Street Buildings are among the earliest buildings surviving in Campbelltown, which was one of the first centres of population to be established outside of Sydney. The buildings were owned and used by many families who played a leading role in the foundations and development of Campbelltown during the 19th Century.Phillips, 1995, Section 5.2 The buildings retain a good deal of evidence about the way of life at the time they were constructed, the buildings were one of the first instances of the State Government buying privately owned property for the purpose of conservation. The Cumberland County Council purchased them in 1963, and was seen as a landmark movement in the history of the conservation movement in NSW. The Buildings were also among the first to be given an A classification by the National Trust.Phillips, 1995, Section 5.3 Of the remaining Georgian design building left in Australia, even fewer are of the standard which is seen in the Queen Street terraces, they are examples of commercial and domestic buildings from the 19th Century.Phillips, 1995, Section 5.4 Queen Street Buildings was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Queen Street terraces 288-294 are significant because together they constitute one of the very few relatively intact Georgian Style townscapes in NSW. The buildings were occupied by several families who were intimately connected with the development of Campbelltown during the 19th Century. They occupy a section of Queen Street which became the focus of commercial town life following the subdivision of the Bradbury Estate in the 1840s. These buildings are believed to be among the first to be acquired and restored by the NSW Government for the purpose of conserving the states environmental heritage, and therefore represent an impact landmark in the history of conservation.Phillips, 1995, pg 7 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The buildings retain much of the fabric of the major phases of development since their construction in the mid 19th Century including several outbuildings and archaeological relics. The buildings and site are physical reminders of the history of the town of Campbelltown. The Queen Street historic precinct makes an important contribution to the quality of the streetscape of Campbelltown. The site is a valuable archaeological resource with potential to add to existing knowledge about early life in Campbelltown.Phillips, 1995, pg. 7  See also   References   Bibliography    *  Attribution  External links New South Wales State Heritage Register Campbelltown, New South Wales Retail buildings in New South Wales Hotels in New South Wales Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register ","title":"Queen Street Buildings"},{"id":"58721465","title":"List of parodies in Gintama"},{"id":"58721470","title":"Colour of Your Jumper"},{"id":"58721472","text":"Kankal () was a Bengali horror drama film directed by Naresh Mitra and produced by Shishir Mallik.

It is also known as Bull's Cave and The Bull Cave. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 August 2017.  History  Aboriginal Australians belonging to the Tharawal, Dharug, and Gandangara peoples are the traditional custodians of the area. Although Bull Cave has been popularly considered to be part of Dharawal country it is situated along the natural boundary between the Hawkesbury sandstone of the Woronora Plateau and the Wianamatta shale of the Cumberland Plain along the Georges River (13). Limited archaeological investigation of the site has revealed influences from coastal, hinterland and mountainous regions, suggesting that it is located at the intersection of three tribal and linguistic boundaries; Dharawal, Dharug and Gundungurra.Miller 1983, p. 13. Dharawal people moved throughout their territories and to a lesser extent those of their neighbours including the Gundangurra and Darug, subject to season and purpose. They travelled widely caring for country in ceremony and practice and harvesting only what was immediately required. People from other language groups travelled from inland to the coast to exchange foods, raw materials and artefacts.Department Environment and Conservation NSW, 2005 Bull Cave had a role as one of a network of sites along the Georges River and its tributaries. The style of art, pigments and artefacts at the cave suggest possible domestic, educational and spiritual uses into the nineteenth century. Several layers of stencils and drawings in Bull Cave were created by the Aboriginal community over time, the largest and most prominent of which, the figures of two large cattle, were created soon after the arrival of the First Fleet. One interpretation argues that the three colours of pigment indicate multilayered applications of use of the cave and its art in cultural terms; whereby red pigment is associated with bloodlines; charcoal with education; and white with spiritual connections. The Appin Massacre of 1816 is considered to have been the most detrimental and tragic historic event for the Aboriginal people of Campbelltown and Camden. It occurred in the early hours of the morning of 17 April 1816, the outcome of a military reprisal raid against Aboriginal people ordered by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. At least 14 Aboriginal men, women and children were killed when soldiers under the command of Captain James Wallis shot at and drove a group of Aboriginal people over the gorge of the Cataract River.Dictionary of Sydney, 2008. Although largely depleted, local Aboriginal people maintained a connection with the Cowpastures region. From the late 1820s magistrates provided lists of local Aboriginal people who might be eligible for the annual distribution of blankets. Comparison of the lists of neighbouring police districts for the 1830s suggests that the surviving Dharawal and Gandangara moved between Campbelltown, the Cowpastures and Picton, rarely venturing to more populated Liverpool. Tribal life continued in a limited way. Corroborees were held nearby at Camden Park and north of the Nepean at Denham Court until at least the 1850s, usually celebrated when other Aboriginal groups were passing through the district.Liston 1988, p.55  The Wild Cattle  In 1787 the First Fleet, bound for Botany Bay, stopped at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, to collect livestock for the new colony. Among these were 11 Cape Cattle, of which 7 live cattle arrived at their destination; one bull, five cows and a bull calf.Collins 1793, p.296 Despite being kept under the watch of a convict herdsman in what is now known as the Domain, in June 1788 these cattle escaped their bounds. After several unsuccessful attempts at recovery Governor Philip abandoned the matter and they were thought lost to the colony.Lyon, Urry 1979, p.42 In October 1795, in line with reports from the Aboriginal community, two convicts came across a herd of wild cattle while on a hunting expedition across the Nepean River. On hearing the news Governor John Hunter arranged for a party to verify the sighting, and later set out himself with a group from Prospect Hill on 8 November 1795. After travelling for two days south and having crossed the Nepean they found a fine herd of over 40 cattle grazing in \\"country remarkably pleasant to the eye, and the finest yet discovered in New South Wales, the soil good and eligible for cultivation, everywhere thick luxuriant grass\\".'First Fleet Cattle' The Sydney Morning Herald, 13 August 1932, p. 9. With the assumption that these were the descendants of those cattle which had escaped 7 years earlier, the cattle became known as \\"the wild cattle\\" and the Campbelltown-Camden area they inhabited became known as the Cowpastures.Mitchell 1939, p.129. The area and cattle were declared property of the Crown and, under its protection, their numbers increased further. In 1795 the herd was estimated to be approximately 60 head; in 1801 Governor King estimated there to be 500-600 head; and by 1806 there were thought to be 3000 head.Lyon, Urry 1979, p. 42. Although some land had been granted to figures such as Macarthur, the region was not settled until 1822, and the wild cattle remained largely undisturbed until 1826 when they were gradually dispersed into other government herds.Lyon, Urry 1979, p.43.  European development  Whilst the greater Campbelltown-Camden area began to be settled by Europeans in the 1810s and 1820s, Kentlyn mostly remained bushland, with only a handful of land grants given out. In 1879 the Kentlyn area was proclaimed the \\"Campbelltown Common\\". It comprised south of Peter Meadows Creek, east of Smiths Creek and west of the Georges River and provided firewood and temporary grazing for local property owners.Dictionary of Sydney, 2008 In 1894, during an economic depression a number of small farms were established on newly opened land and three earlier land grants in the area were privately subdivided by a Sydney developer. The estate was promoted as the \\"Kent Farms\\".CA Liston, 1988 During the Great Depression in the 1930s the Kentlyn area became inhabited by unemployed persons who built makeshift homes in the bush, attracted by Campbelltown Council's offer of two days' work per week building roads in the area.\\"Campbelltown's Streets and Suburbs - How and why they got their names\\" written by Jeff McGill, Verlie Fowler and Keith Richardson, 1995, published by Campbelltown and Airds Historical Society With the population explosion of the 1970s Kentlyn was declared a \\"scenic protection\\" zone with a minimum lot size of . This converted some of the bushland area into sprawling estates.Jeff McGill, Verlie Fowler and Keith Richardson, 1995 This pocket of bushland along Peter Meadows Creek has been maintained to the present as an open space corridor.Office of Strategic Lands, 2016  Recent History  Bull Cave was first recorded in June 1971.When the site was significantly vandalised in 1982, National Parks and Wildlife Service installed a wire fence around the mouth of the cave to prevent further incursions.AHIMS site card. There have since been numerous incidents where the wire fence has been compromised and vandalism has continued. Despite much graffiti, the bull images remain visible. Although investigations in previous decades concluded that graffiti removal would be impossible, recently developed techniques may allow for restoration in future. Aboriginal people value the cave highly in the present and describe its importance within the broader cultural landscape.  Description  The site is located in Kentlyn, northeast of Campbelltown, within a pocket of remnant bushland bordered by a suburban landscape. It consists of a rock shelter along a sandstone ridge, 15 metres from a creek. It is one of a network of rock art sites along the small creek valley system which constitute a complex cultural resource. The shelter faces west and is wide and deep. The walls display pigment art which has been identified as being of Aboriginal origin. There are dozens of stencils within the shelter including a number of white hand stencils along with stencils of arms, fists, a boomerang and several stencils which may be those of sheep or calves feet in white and red. There are also numerous paintings. The largest paintings in the shelter are two large representations of quadrupeds. Both figures are outlined in black charcoal. One shows signs of earlier red outline and infill. The first figure is almost three metres long and one metre high. The general shape of the animal, the appearance of what appears to be mature sexual organs, the tail and the cloven feet, suggest that the painting is of a bull. It bears no resemblance to any native marsupial. The second figure stands to the left of and behind the first figure. The body is thick, the tail is visible and filled in with black but is not as long as in the first figure, and is broader. The cloven front feet suggest that this may be a representation of either a cow or a bull. The position of the two drawings on the wall of the rock may also be of significance. It has been suggested that one animal could be interpreted as attempting to mount the other in an act of copulation. The cave has been considerably vandalised. To protect against further graffiti, it has been enclosed by a wire fence installed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service in 1982.  Heritage listing  As at 13 March 2017, Bull Cave is of state significance as it offers a rare Aboriginal perspective on the early contact period. Whilst it is representative of a suite of Aboriginal rock art sites which depict European subject matter in the early contact period, it presents a unique window into one specific and notable historical event: the escape and subsequent flourishing of the First Fleet cattle in the area which came to be known as the Cowpastures. The style and method of the painting is broadly representative of the traditional Aboriginal art of the sandstone landscape in the Sydney Basin. It is also of state significance for its history and associations with the Dharawal, Gundugurra and Dharug Aboriginal peoples who are understood to each have traditional connections with the riverside landscape which is located close to the intersection of the boundaries of the three groups. Bull Cave was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 August 2017 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Bull Cave has historical significance at a state level as it provides a unique insight into the earliest period of contact between Aboriginal people and European settlers. It tells the story of the transportation of cattle on the First Fleet, their escape upon arrival and the subsequent development of the Cowpastures from an Aboriginal perspective. The site has a special place in the post contact history of the region, having been one of the last places in the area where Aboriginal people were able to live a traditional, independent life. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The site and art are significant for their special association with the Dharawal, Gundugurra and Dharug Aboriginal people, being located at the intersection of three tribal boundaries. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The rock art is of state heritage significance for its aesthetic values as evidence of a painting style identified with sandstone landscapes of the Sydney Basin. Distinctive characteristics of the art include symbolic motifs of which stencils are common. While the bull theme is highly unusual, the painting technique is characteristic of Aboriginal art in the Sydney Basin. It is significant that on both figures the feet are clearly shown to be cloven and drawn in profile. Aboriginal artists commonly drew representations of the tracks of the animals they encountered. Feet are important for identification of Australian rock-art fauna, and are usually drawn so as to include enough information about the feet to infer what the animal/being's tracks looked like. The clear representation of the feet on these paintings may have been one way in which the animals and their tracks were thought of as distinctive by the painters. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Bull Cave is of state heritage significance to the community of NSW, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, as a unique documentation of the early contact period as viewed by the traditional owners of the land. It is also significant in a traditional and historical sense to the local Aboriginal community. In addition to being valued as part of a relatively intact and complex group of sites along the creek system, the community also express a connection to the site as an important teaching place which is symbolic of the challenges faced by Aboriginal communities in trying to balance their desire to recognize and celebrate their heritage, with the need to protect it. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Bull Cave is of state significance for its archaeological research potential. To date, only a small portion of the entrance to Bull Cave has been subject to archaeological excavation. Further research into the art could provide additional information for interpretation of early-post contact art, allow revelations about on-going use of rock-art sites after European settlement, and help to reveal further undocumented Aboriginal reactions to European settlement. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Whilst there are several examples of Aboriginal rock art with European subjects, animals and pieces of material culture which date to the early post- contact period, Bull Cave is unique for its connection to a particularly specific and significant story. It is the only painting of cattle executed very soon after European settlement, linking the Aboriginal community with a dramatic event in the first years of colonisation of Australia-the loss and rediscovery of the first cattle landed on the continent. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The pigment, method and style of the paintings are a good representation of Aboriginal rock art of the Sydney Basin.

The story follows a father and daughter living in post-apocalyptic wasteland as they fight against corporate control of the electromagnetic spectrum. The film mixes found footage with live-action scenes. Plot In the year 2007, a telepathic woman Boo Boo and her father Yogi live in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The New Electromagnetic Order rules the world, opposed by the TV Tesla resistance movement. Boo Boo, able to withstand the radioactive atmosphere, must go back in time 50 years and trace TV broadcasts of Science in Action to find an encoded secret from her grandmother. Meanwhile, Yogi scans the history of the electromagnetic conflict. After decoding the secret message, Boo Boo flies into the Sun to unleash a chain reaction that weaponizes the Sun's energy. Cast * Sean Kilcoyne as Yogi * Caroline Koebel as Boo Boo * Beth Lisick as Boo Boo (voice) Production Director Craig Baldwin with his collection of films in 2015 Baldwin worked on Spectres of the Spectrum over three years. The film primarily draws from archival material that Baldwin kept in the basement of his studio space in San Francisco. His collection included hundreds of educational Science in Action episodes, discarded by the Exploratorium. Baldwin was motivated to use these because the show regularly had military figures as guest stars, which he thought perfectly captured \\"the reality of science being coopted by the military\\". Additional live-action scenes were shot on 16 mm film. Caroline Koebel's scenes did not have sync sound, and voiceover was added instead. Release Spectres of the Spectrum premiered October 5, 1999 at the Vancouver International Film Festival. It was selected to screen at the 1999 New York Film Festival, the 2000 Whitney Biennial, and the 2000 London Film Festival. When the Church of Scientology found out about a mention of L.

Norton Chair of Agricultural Marketing and professor in the department of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  Career  Irwin earned a bachelor's degree in agricultural business from Iowa State University in 1980 and both an MS and PhD in agricultural economics from Purdue University in 1983 and 1986, respectively. He currently teaches courses on commodity price analysis and futures and options market research. Irwin's specific research interests include price analysis and forecasting, forecast evaluation, performance of market advisory services, agricultural risk management, commodity market efficiency, and the behavior and role of speculators in commodity markets.  Main contributions  Irwin is a national and international leader in the field of agricultural economics. His research on agricultural markets is widely cited by other academic researchers and is in high demand among market participants, policymakers, and the media. One of his papers was selected as the \\"Top 25 Paper Published in the First 25 Years of the Journal of Economic Surveys\\". Irwin is best known for his work on the impact of speculation in commodity markets. He has been an active participant in the world-wide debate about the market impact of financial index investment in commodity markets, popularly known as financialization. Irwin has published numerous academic articles on the subject and has been called upon to provide testimony before the US Congress, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as well as publishing op-ed articles in the New York Times and Washington Times. He has been invited to make presentations to numerous international organizations such as the World Trade Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization, World Bank, International Energy Agency, and International Institute of Finance.  Other contributions  Irwin has developed agricultural extension programs that have helped farmers throughout the world make informed production, marketing, and financial decisions. * His leadership and vision have been the driving force behind the farmdoc project at the University of Illinois since its inception in 1999. * He led the development of farmdoc daily, which has the goal of publishing one original research-based article each day.  Controversy  Scott H. Irwin was blamed, along with Craig Pirrong, by journalist David Kocieniewski for not disclosing ties with the financial industry. He has been paid for consulting services and research by private funding from financial companies. David Kocieniewski adds \\"Mr. Irwin declined to provide a list of his clients, and the university said its disclosure requirements did not compel him to do so\\".

In 1910, she became the first woman in Denmark to work as a factory engineer, inspecting the premises of bakeries in Copenhagen until she retired in 1939. She was an active member of the Danish Women's Society, serving as president from 1918 to 1921. She was also prominent at the international level, speaking at conferences and serving on the central committee of the International Alliance of Women (1923‚Äì1929). Biography Born on 10 December 1873 in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen, Julie Johanne Rosengreen was the daughter of Harald Christian Rosengreen (1836‚Äì1907), a civil servant, and Rasmine Rasmussen (1840‚Äì1914). On receiving the necessary qualification, she worked as a schoolteacher before entering the Polytechnic Teaching Institute in 1896, qualifying as Denmark's first female factory engineer in 1901. In 1903, she married the medical doctor and Olympic tennis player J√∏rgen Arenholt (1876‚Äì1953). She worked first at the Teaching Institute, then at Detlefsen and Meyer's laboratory. In 1910, she succeeded in obtaining the newly created post of factory inspector at the Directorate for Labour and Manufacturing Control ( Direktoratet for Arbejds- og Fabriktilsynet), where she was responsible for checking our bakeries and pastry shops in the Copenhagen area. On the political front, her lifelong interest in economic and social conditions began in 1907 when she was one of the founders of the women's suffrage association Landsforbundet for Kvinders Valgret, editing their journal Kvindevalgret (Women's Right to Vote) from 1908 to 1912. When women received the right to vote in municipal elections, in 1909 she was elected to the Citizens Representation for the Social Liberal Party. She proved to be a talented speaker, winning more votes than normal when she gained more votes than normal for the Social Liberal Party in Gentofte in 1918 when women were first permitted to stand for the Folketing. In 1915, she joined the Danish Women's Society, serving as president from 1918 to 1921. She gained a reputation both in Denmark and abroad for her strong leadership skills. She played an active part at the congresses of the International Women's Movement, serving on the central committee of the International Alliance of Women from 1923 to 1929. In particular, she fought for women's participation in business. Julie Arenholt died in Copenhagen on 21 July 1952 and was buried in Bispebjerg Cemetery.

Formerly named Victoria, an Italian ocean liner built in 1953, the ship was purchased at scrap value of US $1 million in 1978. The ship was renovated and equipped as a fully functioning hospital ship to serve as the flagship of the Mercy Ships fleet for 29 years until being succeeded by in 2007.  Service history   Early years and operational design  After purchase of Victoria in Italy, the ship was towed to Eleusis, Greece where Mercy Ships spent four years renovating the cruise liner into a self-contained hospital ship, with three operating rooms, a 40-bed hospital ward, a dental clinic, and hospital support services including x-ray equipment and a laboratory. The ship was renamed Anastasis, the Greek word for resurrection, and sailed out of Greece on July 7, 1982 to her port of registry in Valletta, Malta. Anastasis subsequently crossed the Atlantic Ocean and the Panama Canal to dock in Los Angeles for her first supply and fundraising trip. Her first relief effort was conducted in the port of Champerico, Guatemala, where Mercy Ships delivered food, seeds, clothing, and building materials. Anastasis was staffed by a crew of volunteers from around the world, including surgeons, nurses, anesthesia providers, mariners, and other ancillary service providers such as cooks and housekeeping staff. Mercy Ships maintain this volunteer-based staffing model to date, as well as employing local day-workers to serve as translators and patient aides in each nation they visit.  Field service  Anastasis visited 275 ports over her lifespan, conducting 66 field assignments in 23 nations. When she was not conducting field services in developing nations, Anastasis visited ports worldwide for purposes of fundraising, publicity, maintenance, and resupply. From 1982 to 1988 the ship conducted primarily supply and relief operations, as well as being held up for 18 months to conduct further renovations to meet SOLAS standards as a passenger ship. In 1988, Anastasis performed her first field service as a fully functioning hospital ship in Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico, where ophthalmic, maxillofacial, and plastic reconstructive surgeries were performed on board the ship by volunteer medical crew. After conducting a tour of Europe to raise funds and awareness about Mercy Ships, Anastasis set sail in 1990 for her first visit to Africa, where Mercy Ships' focus would remain henceforth. Anastasis was originally headed to Ghana after several years of planning, but Mercy Ships' governmental invitation was frozen three weeks before departure. The ship instead went to Togo for her first African field service, visiting Ghana next in 1991. In 1992, Anastasis visited Sierra Leone which, like Togo, Mercy Ships would return to repeatedly; both nations have hosted a Mercy Ship five times to date. Anastasis made her final West African visit in 2007 to Liberia, where Mercy Ships' new flagship, MV Africa Mercy, met with the ship to take over. Anastasis was retired in 2007 and sailed to the ship breaking yard in Alang, India for disassembly.

Its main base is the southernmost municipality on S√£o Tom√©, Cau√©. At the 2018 parliamentary elections it got 1,659 votes and won two seats in the Cau√© constituency. The party only received 608 votes outside of Cau√©.  Background  In May 2018 Ant√≥nio and Domingos Monteiro and their cousin Beatriz Azevedo, who was the party's lead candidate in the Cau√© constituency, left the MLSTP parliamentary group and formed an independent group in the National Assembly. They had previously been suspended for attending a plenary session of the National Assembly, which the party boycotted, where they voted to dismiss three Supreme Court judges. The three had along with fellow MPs Jorge Amado and Vasco Guiva constituted an internal opposition to the party leadership following the suspension of the previous party president Aur√©lio Martins. The background for the conflict was a fight over the ownership of the Rosema brewery in Neves, which is run by Domingos Monteiro. The Supreme Court ruled to hand over the plant to the Angolan businessman Melo Xavier, which \\"plunged Sao Tome and Principe into a political-institutional crisis.\\" Antonio Monteiros had previously \\"conquered the national food trade market with a special emphasis on rice\\", and in 2009 gotten control over the Rosema brewery where he installed his brother Domingos as managing director. Antonio Monteiros was until he defected the main donor of MLSTP and his patronage network in Cau√© was the reason they held that municipality in the 2014 local elections, as the only one. The ruling Independent Democratic Action (ADI) decided to intervene on behalf of brothers and had a parliamentary resolution adopted that removed the judges who decided to hand over the brewery to Melo Xavier from the court, which \\"reinforced the political-commercial relations between the boss of Rosema Domingos Monteiro and the leader of the country, Prime Minister Patrice Trovoada\\". Party president Aur√©lio Martins was in favour of the MLSTP supporting the brothers. But since MLSTP has close relations to the other ex-liberation movements in Lusophone Africa a political intervention against an Angolan businessman with MPLA patronage was unacceptable to a majority of the party and he got removed from the leadership.

It was designed by John Joseph Therry and built from 1824 to 1841. It is also known as St. Johns Roman Catholic Church and Cemetery (former), Saint Johns Roman Catholic Church and St John the Evangelist Church. The property is owned by Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The foundation stone of St John's Roman Catholic Church was laid 12 December 1824. The Sydney Gazette dated 16 June 1825 announced that Father Therry acknowledged the gift of of land at Campbelltown from James Bourke for a chapel, schoolhouse and burial ground. Father John Joseph Therry arrived in Sydney with Father Philip Connolly 5 May 1820 on board the ship Janus. After his ordination to the priesthood in 1815 Father Therry worked in Dublin and it was there that he was prompted to volunteer for the penal colony of New South Wales after experiencing the trials and tribulations of Irish convicts bound for Sydney. In September 1819 Bishop Slater commissioned father Therry and Father Connolly to work throughout the whole of new Holland and Van Dieman's Land. The civil authorities authorised Governor Macquarie to pay both me an allowance of A‚Ç§100 per annum. The two priests quickly settled areas of influence in the new colony and Father Connolly set sail for Hobart. Father Therry found himself frequently in Parramatta, Liverpool and the district known as Airds. For the next ten years Campbelltown Catholics struggled to raise funds for the completion of St. John's Church. Early records are dotted with references of meeting to finance the project. The Catholic Community gathered at local public houses such as Cullen's Inn and the Forbes Hotel to mound fundraising campaigns. That part of the Bourke gift devoted to the cemetery was consecrated 27 December 1826. It was at this time that Father Therry fell foul of the government authorities and Governor Darling withdrew his allowance from 24 June 1826. Funds seemed to be short throughout the Catholic community and little happened in the completion of St. John's Church until early in 1833 when Roger Therry advised Father Therry that some Government financial assistance would be available for the Church completion. Governor Darling had assured Roger Therry that the Home Government was agreeable to advance funds equal to those subscribed by the local community. It seems that at this time work had progressed on the walls to a height of a single storey. In July 1833 William McNally agreed to complete the stonework on the walls and in December of that year William Broker tendered and was engaged for the shingling and completion of the Church roof. David Lee and Patrick Bleaney agreed to complete the floor, doors, sashes and to glaze the windows for 388 pounds. In a despatch to Lord Stanley, 30 September 1833, Governor Bourke wrote: Father Therry offered the first Mass in St John's Church, Campbelltown on 27 July 1834. In 1886 the church was converted into a school by way of a new floor being inserted and various changes made to openings. After the opening of the new St John's Roman Catholic Church at the corner of Lindesay Street and Cordeaux Street, it was converted to St Patrick's Convent for the Good Samaritan Sisters and operated as a boarding school (both boarding and day) until 1970. In 1980 the Campbelltown Parish requested that consideration be given for St John's Church and Cemetery to be protected under the Heritage Act 1977 and seeking possible funding. On 4 March 1983 a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the site. During 1984 and with financial assistance from the Heritage Conservation Fund the Church returned the building largely to its original 1830s form. On 2 April 1999 it was transferred to the State Heritage Register.  Description  Church building A stuccoed brick church of simple Victorian Georgian design. The arched window openings and pilasters are marked by projecting render work and quoins represent ashlar work. The main roof and that over the porch are of simple pitched form. Cemetery Adjoining the church is the cemetery which contains the graves of many famous pioneers including James Ruse and Matthew Healey. The earliest grave is dated 1827. James Ruse (1760-1837) arrived in Australia on the First Fleet and was fortunate to receive one of the first land grants in the colony, which was located in Parramatta. He is associated with Experiment Farm at Parramatta which in December 1789 had its first successful harvest. James Ruse is often referred to as Australia's first farmer and also known as the Father of Australia's wheat industry. Matthew Healey played an important role in the early history of the Goulburn district for the inn which he built there called Riversdale and is the only surviving example of the old township as sited by Macquarie.  Heritage listing  As at 5 December 2007, St John's Roman Catholic Church and Cemetery is of State significance for its associations with the Catholic Parish of Campbelltown, the second oldest parish in Australia. It is associated with the pioneers of the early Australian Catholic church, especially Father John Therry who designed the building. Construction of the masonry building was commenced in 1825 but it was not completed until 1841. It is thought to be the oldest masonry Catholic Church building in Australia. It is associated with James Ruse and Matthew Healy whose graves are located in the cemetery.Heritage Office files St John's Roman Catholic Church and Cemetery was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Precup is associate dean of research at the faculty of science at McGill University, Canada research chair in machine learning and a senior fellow at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. She also heads the Montreal office of Deepmind. Education Precup said she was drawn to the field of artificial intelligence at a young age by her interest in science fiction, where robots are often portrayed as useful and benevolent. Her mother was a university professor of computer science in Romania. She obtained a bachelor of science degree in computer science and engineering (magna cum laude) at Technical University of Cluj-Napoca in 1994, followed by a master of science in 1995. She left Romania in 1995 on a Fulbright scholarship to pursue graduate studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where she earned a master's degree in 1997 and a PhD in 2000. Several women in Precup's family have had successful careers in science and the science program in her high school in Romania was well attended by girls. She only became aware of the gender imbalance in sciences and technology when she moved to North America. She decided to get involved in correcting this situation and does so as the co-founder and advisor of the AI4Good Lab, an organization that aims at getting more women to study and work in artificial intelligence. Career in artificial intelligence Precup was recruited as an assistant professor by McGill University's School of Computer Science in 2000 and has since been living in the Montreal area. In 2017, Precup was appointed to lead the Montreal office of the artificial intelligence firm Deepmind, which is owned by Google. She teaches at McGill while conducting fundamental research on reinforcement learning at Deepmind, working in particular on AI applications in areas that have a social impact, such as health care (medical imaging for example). She's interested in machine decision-making in situations where uncertainty is high. She is a senior fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence and a member of the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms. With four other AI researchers (Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, Rich Sutton and Ian Kerr), she sent a letter to the Canadian Prime Minister in 2017 asking him to start addressing the risks posed by the development of AI-controlled weapons.

Alb√°n served as a councilman of the Libertador Municipality of Caracas from 2012 until his death in office in 2018. He died while he was detained in the headquarters of the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN) in Plaza Venezuela, Caracas. Although government officials reported his death as a suicide, his friends, family, opposition political parties and Luis Almagro, Secretary General of the Organization of American States, argue that the councilor's death was murder. Personal life and early career Alb√°n was born in Colombia, and relocated to Venezuela at the age of four. At the time of his death, he held citizenship in both countries. He was a devout Catholic, and had worked with the Archdiocese of Caracas on many charity projects. Alb√°n, a lawyer who specialized in labor law, received his law degree from Central University of Venezuela. He served as the national secretary of the Justice First trade union association. He was elected to the Capital District's Libertador Bolivarian Municipality council in the 2012 regional elections, winning the election with 6,170 votes and representing Circuit 3 on the council. Alb√°n with his wife, Meudy, and their two children, Fernando and Mar√≠a, maintained a residence in New York at the time of his death.  Arrest Alb√°n traveled to New York City for the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, as part of a Justice First opposition delegation led by Julio Borges. Alb√°n, Borges, and other members of the delegation had meetings with foreign dignitaries and other groups attending the assembly. Alb√°n was detained by Venezuelan authorities at Sim√≥n Bol√≠var International Airport on Friday, 5 October 2018, upon his return to the country. No reason for his arrest was given, and no details were provided of where he was being held, until after his death. The BBC reported that people close to him did not believe the official reason for arrest, instead saying that Alb√°n was arrested for presenting information about human rights violations in Venezuela during the assembly. While detained, Alb√°n was pressured by the Maduro government to testify against Borges about the Caracas drone attack; he refused, and told this to his family and lawyers when they spoke to him. Tarek William Saab, prosecutor general for the Maduro administration, later stated that Alb√°n was arrested because of \\"evidence of 2,000 chats with conspiratorial themes\\". The number has also been reported as 200, and the chats were defined as conversations found on Alb√°n's personal mobile phone. Death Alb√°n's hearse and funeral procession Alb√°n was taken into SEBIN custody after his arrest, and was said after his death to be a suspect for the Caracas drone attack that had occurred two months earlier. He was seen by lawyer Joel Garc√≠a on Sunday after his arrest on Friday, but was reported dead on Monday, 8 October. The government states that he took his own life by jumping from a tenth floor window either whilst he was waiting to be transferred (Interior Minister N√©stor Reverol's account) or whilst going to the bathroom (Saab's account) at around midday. According to anonymous sources that Julio Borges says are official, Alb√°n was dead before he was thrown out of a window. According to William Jim√©nez, former coordinator of national investigations of the Caracas morgue, the autopsy revealed that water was found in Alb√°n's lungs and N√©stor Reverol ordered the report to be edited. This narrative is widely disputed. Efecto Cocuyo noted the differences in official stories, and quoted former SEBIN prisoners explaining that detainees are always escorted to the bathroom, opening further doubts, as the bathroom version was the first explanation given. Lawyers who knew the building confirmed that there are no windows in the bathroom and that all of the windows are locked, so Alb√°n could not have opened one himself. His death, called murder by many, prompted riots across Venezuela and received worldwide media attention. A memorial was held at the National Assembly building the day after his death; his body was immediately released but contained within a flag-draped coffin. He was buried on Wednesday, 10 October. His family watched his funeral on video from their residence in New York. His devout Catholic faith is cited by friends, colleagues, and the conference of Catholic bishops of Venezuela as a reason to not believe the official story regarding his death, because he had too much respect for God to consider taking his own life. Investigations The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called for an investigation into Alb√°n's death, and planned to include it in a wider investigation into human rights abuses in the country. The European Union also asked for an independent investigation. Tarek William Saab, Venezuelan prosecutor general, said that he would investigate the death, but classified it as a suicide. Garc√≠a pointed out in response that a death can not be classified as suicide without an autopsy and investigation, and requested to be present at the autopsy. Garc√≠a was not present at the secret autopsy supposedly performed shortly before burial; Saab announced that the autopsy found that Alb√°n died of blunt force trauma. It was later reported that there were two different death certificates, the first issued by a community doctor without the credentials to do so, and the other by a supposed doctor using a stolen identity. The opposition government in Venezuela asked that Colombia perform the investigation, so that it would be unbiased. Garcia suggested that since Alb√°n retained his Colombian citizenship after moving to Venezuela, Colombia could have more legal rights to pursue an investigation; the international ramifications of the event were heightened when Alb√°n's place of birth and heritage (his parents and ancestors are all Colombian) were made public knowledge.  Response  With his body concealed, the public became concerned that Alb√°n had been tortured, which was supported by allegations from the Venezuelan opposition government, including Borges directly. A demonstration was held outside the city mortuary for the release of his body, with fears he would be cremated before anyone could examine it. The United Nations suggested that the Venezuelan government and intelligence service can be held responsible regardless of how Alb√°n died, as officials are \\"obligated to ensure Alb√°n‚Äôs safety while in their custody\\". Article 44 of the Constitution of Venezuela says that the State is responsible for protecting the lives of its prisoners. Venezuelan opposition deputy Juan Miguel Matheus gave a speech describing the torture of Alb√°n, saying that he would have been electrocuted and asphyxiated. Luisa Ortega D√≠az ‚Äì the exiled Venezuelan Chief Justice ‚Äì announced her understanding that Alb√°n died of suffocation while being tortured by a bag over his head during interrogation. The United States has also said it believes Alb√°n was tortured then killed. France called for an investigation into the \\"suspicious\\" death and summoned the Venezuelan ambassador to the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs on Thursday, 11 October. Spain took similar actions, questioning the Venezuelan ambassador in Madrid. Multiple foreign countries suggested that the Maduro government tortured Alb√°n. Saab denied all claims of torture, calling them a \\"rotten lie\\". Candlelight protests, public memorials and vigils were held in Caracas, particularly outside the SEBIN buildings, to denounce the murder. Supporters marched in Alb√°n's funeral procession, with some holding signs with the slogan Yo me niego a rendirme (I refuse to give up), recalling the last speech of Juan Requesens before his detention. The United States Department of State issued a statement in April 2019 highlighting Alb√°n's death as an example of the Maduro administration human rights abuses, stating: > In October 2018, Caracas Councilman Fernando Alban traveled to New York to > denounce the Maduro regime's brutality on the sidelines of the United > Nations General Assembly. Upon his return to Venezuela on October 5, > Maduro's secret police arrested him at the airport. He died in custody a few > days later when he mysteriously fell from a 10th floor window of a maximum- > security prison in Caracas.

History Fleet's original church, along with much of the village, suffered considerable damage and destruction during the Great Storm of 1824. After waves broke through Chesil Beach, many of the village's residents were forced to retreat to nearby Chickerell. Once the storm had subsided, it was discovered that five dwellings had been destroyed, along with the nave of the parish church. In the aftermath, the Rector of Fleet, Rev. George Gould, decided to have a new church built at his expense and plans were drawn up by William Strickland. The chosen site of the new church was 540 yards inland from its predecessor. The foundation stone of the new church was laid by Rev. Gould on 25 April 1827. It was completed in 1829 and consecrated by the Bishop of Bristol, the Right Rev. Robert Gray, on 25 August 1829.The Morning Post - Consecration of Fleet Church - 1 September 1829 Today the church holds one service each month and is also used for weddings, funerals and other events.

Summary The history of association football in the country dates from the 1890s, when the game was introduced to some port cities by British sailors and dock workers, and to other locations by locals who had been to Britain for education or work and had been exposed to the developing sport there. The earliest national competition was the 1902 Copa de la Coronaci√≥n, followed by the introduction of the Copa del Rey a year later. In those formative decades, the dominant clubs were Athletic Bilbao, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, a pattern which continued into the early editions of La Liga, the national league which was established in 1929. The frequent important meetings in the cup and regular league fixtures, as well as each club becoming adopted as a symbol of their respective home regions, caused rivalries to develop between them, with the feud between Barcelona from Catalonia and Real Madrid from Castile, known as El Cl√°sico, now being one of the most watched football matches around the world due to the sustained success of the two teams, who attract global fanbases, possess some of the top playing talent and have stadia which are among the largest in Europe. In the early 21st century, a significant rivalry developed between the two most prominent forwards in each team, Portuguese Cristiano Ronaldo and Argentinian Lionel Messi, who consistently vied to break goalscoring records and win global individual awards in addition to helping their clubs to several major finals, with their mutual levels of performance seldom seen in the past ‚Äì this added a new element to the matches between them and generated even more attention from media and supporters. The third team in the original triad of success, Athletic Bilbao from the Basque Country, have fallen far behind in terms of their profile and trophies won due to being based in a smaller city and having a self-imposed restriction limiting themselves to a small pool of players with a connection to their home territory. However, their meetings with their old foes still maintain a level of interest due to the sporting history and political aspects of their relationships. Those are the only three teams to have played every league season, so have the highest total of matches contested. Atl√©tico Madrid, Valencia and Sevilla form a group of clubs who have caught up with Athletic Bilbao in terms of performance and cup wins and have similar levels of support, with attendances of 40,000 or better on average but are still far behind Barcelona and Real Madrid in both respects. Their proud histories feature complicated relationships with the 'big two' and with one another, as well as being involved in other local rivalries including the Seville derby and the Valencia derby. After the biggest clubs, there are several significant derbies or rivalries which usually fall into one of three categories: a local rivalry within the same city (most of these involve one of the six clubs above, such as the Derbi barcelon√≠ and the Madrid Derby); a regional rivalry involving two or more teams in the same autonomous community, (often with each representing a province within that region, as in the Basque derby and the Galician derby); or an inter-regional rivalry between clubs from neighbouring autonomous communities, for example Osasuna of Navarre and Real Zaragoza of Aragon. Teams with significant support each have ultras groups with diverse connections and policial affiliations, which have often led to violence between them. The term morbo (roughly translating to morbid fascination and antagonism) has sometimes been used to describe the attitudes relating to the complex network of identities and relationships between Spanish clubs.

It was designed by George Allen Mansfield and built in 1887 by George Lusted. It is also known as St. Helen's Park and Egypt Farm. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Campbelltown The original inhabitants of the area were mostly people of the Tharawal (sometimes referred to as Dharawal) people, who ranged from the coast to the east, the Georges River in the west, north to Botany Bay and south to Nowra. However Campbelltown was a meeting point with the Dharug language group (whose area extended across the Blue Mountains) and early history of the area includes references to both peoples.Liston, 1988; www.abc.net.au/indigenous With establishment of the convict colony in Sydney in 1788 the displacement of Aboriginal people began. A smallpox epidemic decimated many of the coastal clans, but was less destructive amongst the inland peoples. Escaped cattle from the convict settlement moved south and bred in the Campbelltown/Camden area and after their (re-) discovery in 1795, the area became known as the \\"Cow Pastures\\" (or Cowpasture). In 1805 Jon Macarthur obtained a grant of (later expanded to ) in the area, some of the best grazing land then known in the colony. By 1809, 34 settlers had received grants in the newly named Minto district (named after Gilbert Elliot-Murray- Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto, the Governor-General of India) in the northern portion of Campbelltown. Many of these were Irish, including surveyor James Meehan, who allocated himself a generous portion (now Macquarie Fields). Prominent settlers included Charles Throsby, who was allocated (now Glenfield), William Redfern (Campbellfield), John Townson (Varroville (homestead)) and Richard Brooks (Denham Court). Though peaceful, the Tharawal people bore the brunt of a punitive expedition led by Captain James Wallis in 1816. At least 14 Tharawal people were massacred at the Appin Massacre, to the distress of sympathetic settlers such as Throsby of Glenfield. Corroborees and other ceremonies continued under the protection of the Macarthurs of Camden Park, though numbers steadily declined. As the district became more densely settled a town was needed further south than Liverpool. Campbelltown was formally established in 1820 and named in honour of Elizabeth Macquarie's maiden name, Campbell. In 1826 the town plan was formalised.

On 6 May 1886 Westgarth also acquired a further parcel of land from George Henry Graham which included part of the original grant to Samuel Larkin. St Helen's Park was built in 1887 to the design of architect George Allen Mansfield, it was given to Sydney soliticitor, George Westgarth as a wedding present, after he married Mansfield's daughter, Lucy. The contractor was George Lusted. George Westgarth was the founder of a Sydney-based law firm. Then at an auction of Crown lands on 30 October 1895 George Charles Westgarth purchase the described as Portion 296, on which he later built a dam across Spring Creek to ensure the homestead's water supply. Various uses for the property, apart from its original and present role as a country house, have been as a school, a guesthouse and an experimental farm.Illawarra Mercury, 12 March 1985, 11. Subsequent uses include Campbelltown Grammar School and Commercial College, a Friesian cattle stud and an exclusive guesthouse.Campbelltown City Council As a result of its impending sale an Interim Conservation Order was placed over the property on 15 March 1985. A Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the property on 16 May 1986. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  Garden House St Helen's Park is an elaborate two storey neo Gothic mansion, with \\"Jerkinhead\\" gables, massive chimneys and decorative fretwork bargeboards. The foundations are said to have been cut from sandstone quarried on the property and the blocks to have come from Menangle. It is symmetrical in plan and facade, with an extensive verandah to three sides being supported on cast iron columns.The gabled roof is covered in slate, the roof line being given interest by many dormer window gables, massive chimneys and fretwork barge boards. Onto the flagged verandah open either French doors or large double hung windows, all screened by varnished louvered shutters. The four panelled front door is glazed with matching sidelights, above which is the Westgarth coat of arms and motto \\"Mens Concia Recti\\" displayed in leadlight above the lintel, in the transome light, and repeated on the first floor landing. Internal joinery is of cedar being unpainted except to skirtings and architraves with fine built-in cupboards to bedrooms. There are seven large marble chimney pieces each of a different colour and many other original fittings and glasswork. A small stone dairy and timber stables of late Victorian design are some distance from the house.Heritage Council, Branch Managers Report, 30 May 1985 Single storey service wing at rear contains original kitchen. Outbuildings include original stone cool room, carriage shed and barn.  Condition  As at 4 July 2008, the physical condition is good and highly intact.  Further information  A sandstone dam, historically linked with St. Helens Park is situated across Spring Creek.  Heritage listing  As at 3 August 2016, St Helen's Park is an elaborate two storey neo Gothic mansion built in 1887 for the wealthy Sydney Westgarth family and designed by architect George Allen Mansfield. It is well detailed and generally intact. Its distinctive massing and architectural character and its position, make it a prominent feature in the landscape viewed from the Appin Road demonstrating the past rural estate character of the outskirts of Campbelltown.

It was designed and built from 1825. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 August 1999.  History  Airds Airds was the name used to describe the entire Campbelltown area. Governor Macquarie, on his first visit in 1810, wrote: 'I intend forming this tract of country into a new and separate district for the accommodation of small settlers, and to name it Airds in honour of my dear good Elizabeth's family estate (in Scotland)'. Airds was widely used at first but as individual local villages came into being, the broad name fell out of use and it wasn't reborn until 1975 when the NSW Housing Commission converted bush farms at \\"South Kentlyn\\" into a new housing estate - Airds.Macarthur Advertiser Kearns and Epping Forest The land was part of the district of Minto and was formally granted by Governor Macquarie in 1810 to Matthew and John Kearns in two adjoining parcels. The conditions of these grants required at least of each parcel to be cultivated and allowed for the logging of timber on the land owned by the Crown. The location of the land within the grant that was cultivated and any areas which were officially logged is unknown. Matthew Kearn's grant was known as River Hill and was part of a prosperous and established neighbourhood around the new settlement of Campbelltown. By the early 1820s the land had passed into the hands of William Kearns who was recorded as having lived there in 1823. The house on the site was built shortly after (1825) and the property has been improved to include orchards, grain crops and general dairy farming. Some of the outbuildings and sheds would have been built as early as the 1820s although most of them were clearly built during later phases of the farming use of the farming use of the property. The property remained in the hands of the family until 1960. During this period it passed through the hands of a number of family members but was in constant use as a farming property. After 1912 the property included an Ayreshire cattle stud and a private race horse stud along with the already established dairy farming interests. Mixed herd dairying was included in the 1960s.p. 20 & 21.  Description  Epping Forest is of the Old Colonial Georgian architectural style. It is constructed of sandstock brick. It has a symmetrical facade and a medium pitched roof and closed eaves. The verandah is under the main roof and has a decorative timber valance and slender turned wooden columns that were cut down when brick balustrading added. The sash windows have very small panes (six to upper sash and four to the lower. Above the six paneled front door is a curved fanlight with very fine glazing bars. It has stone windowsills, door threshold and verandah flagging. To the rear of the house there is a timber and fibro extension. The interior has plaster walls and marble fireplaces. There is a high proportion of surviving fabric, with original detailing and extant joinery. There are a range of sheds on the site. There are two steel framed cgi clad structures, one large rough sawn timber framed cgi clad structure and a number of small rough sawn timber framed annexures. Cladding on the annexures includes cgi and timber slabs.FORM architects 1999  Condition  As at 28 June 1999, the physical condition is fair. Archaeological potential for the site is high. The degree of extant fabric is high, however the structure is not in good condition.  Modifications and dates  *1810 - land granted to each of the Kearns brothers * - site consolidated by William Kearnes * - house constructed  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 28 June 1999, Epping Forest is significant as a surviving example of an early colonial farm complex on the Cumberland Plain that retains the layout and fabric of a main house and associated outbuildings sited upon a small hill dating from the 1820s. The integrity of the place has been maintained by the survival of the Old Colonial Georgian style brick house, the slab and log outbuildings, and the survival of a sufficient curtilage of open country around the complex to enable its strategic siting and historical rural uses to still be appreciated and understood. The main house and outbuildings demonstrate in their layers of additional fabric and changing technology the ongoing functioning of the place as both a farm and residence. The overall layout of the complex, including its curtilage, allow for the continuance of a colonial built form within an increasingly late 20th century urbanised location.Heritage Office 1999 Epping Forest was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 August 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The house was built in the Old Colonial Georgian architectural style, . The site contains a high level of occupational evidence, such as the gardens, fences, outhouses and sheds, which demonstrate how the inhabitants used the building. The site demonstrates its role as a residential dwelling and farm for one hundred and forty years. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The inclusion of the verandah under the hipped roof, makes Epping Forest, one of the more unusual Colonial houses, when compared to the more usual practice of the verandah being expressed separately. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Until recently it was in the continuous occupation by descendants of the original pioneers who built it. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The dairy structures date from 1820 and provide a record of early dairy practice. The 1920s' additions to the dairy sheds demonstrate the changes to dairy and building technology during the previous century.

It was designed and built from 1835. It is also known as Mt Huon. The property is owned by the New South Wales Department of Planning and Infrastructure. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Aboriginal landscape, pre 1788 The original inhabitants of the Campbelltown area were mostly people of the Tharawal (sometimes referred to as Dharawal) language group, who ranged from the coast to the east, the Georges River in the west, north to Botany Bay and south to Nowra. However Campbelltown was a meeting point with the Dharug language group (whose area extended across the Blue Mountains) and early history of the area includes references to both peoples.Liston, 1988; www.abc.net.au/indigenous With establishment of the convict colony in Sydney in 1788 the displacement of Aboriginal people began. A smallpox epidemic decimated many of the coastal clans, but was less destructive amongst the inland peoples. Escaped cattle from the convict settlement moved south and bred in the Campbelltown/Camden area and after their (re-) discovery in 1795, the area became known as the \\"Cow Pastures\\" (or Cowpasture). In 1805 John Macarthur obtained a grant of (later expanded to ) in the area, some of the best grazing land then known in the colony.  1788-1802 early European exploration  ;Displacement of Aboriginal population Though peaceful, the Tharawal people bore the brunt of a punitive expedition led by Captain James Wallis in 1816. At least 14 Tharawal people were massacred at Appin, to the distress of sympathetic settlers such as Throsby of Glenfield. Corroborees and other ceremonies continued under the protection of the Macarthurs of Camden Park, though numbers steadily declined. ;1804-9 early European land grants By 1809 34 settlers had received grants in the newly named Minto district (named after Lord Minto, the Governor-General of India) in the northern portion of Campbelltown. Many of these were Irish, including surveyor James Meehan, who allocated himself a generous portion (now Macquarie Fields). Prominent settlers included Charles Throsby, who was allocated (now Glenfield), Dr. William Redfern (Campbellfield), Dr. John Townson (Varroville (homestead)) and Richard Brooks (Denham Court). As the district became more densely settled a town was needed further south than Liverpool. Campbelltown was formally established in 1820 and named in honour of Mrs Elizabeth Macquarie's maiden name, Campbell. In 1826 the town plan was formalised. Sugarloaf Farm What later became \\"Sugarloaf Farm\\" comprises a number of colonial, smaller land holdings, later consolidated under one title. Of the original farm only the holdings of James Mumford and John Smith form part of the present property. Crown grants in the southern portion of the district had not yet consolidated and were still operating as separate holdings. The alignment of Menangle Road has since been altered, re-defining the boundaries of these properties.Davies, 1999 Relevant grants for Sugarloaf Farm include James Mumford (40 acres, north-east corner); John Masterson (50 acres, adjoining to south); John Smith (50 acres, adjoining to south) - all of these only just overlapping SLFarm's eastern boundary.  Introduction of grazing and cropping  ;Formation of Beehive Farm, 1831 Brothers James and William Bean, granted 80 acres each along old alignment of Menangle Road. In 1835 Paul Huon and George Taber also received grants to the south (covering between the four grants, approximately half of the present SLFarm curtilage). At this time, the property boundaries of many individual holdings particularly on the southern side of Menangle Road, were defined by quince (Cydonia oblonga) and boxthorn (Lycium ferocissimum) hedges, a defining feature of the area during this time.  Further exploration, 1833-4  ;Beehive Farm to Sugarloaf Farm, 1837 Paul Huon to his widow Jane (1856), to William Chapman (renaming the property Mountain View)(1859), to Jon Vardy (Springdale Cottage and Farm (1871).  Introduction of Dairying (1870s+)  Construction of the Sydney Water Canal, 1888 resumption of a corridor through the present Sugarloaf Farm in 1901. By 1916 all the land to the north and east of the present boundary had been sold under separate titles. The curtilage of the remaining portion remained unchanged until the 1970s. In 1903 a significant portion was resumed through the centre of the property to construct the Sydney Water Canal (now called the Upper Canal). This construction redefined the cultural landscape of the property and remains a prominent feature of the site. ;Change in ownership, 1929 Sold to James Carroll, prominent dairy farmer. ;Subsequent ownership, 1970-2001 Macarthur Regional Development Board acquired the property off the Carroll family in the 1970s as part of urban expansion programme. The portion containing Sugarloaf Farm was passed to the Department of Environment and Planning for conservation and long term management. All dairying ceased at this time and the property was used to agist cattle. Since the 1940s the farm has been leased for grazing and recreation. By 1986 the DEP had leased it to Phil Macleod for grazing and recreational purposes. In 1999 the southeastern tip was subdivided off. The subject property currently accommodates Sugarloaf Riding School, which is managed by Brian Maynard.Graham Brooks and Associates, 2001, quoting Paul Davies P/L, 1999 The homestead's current tenants have been based there for more than 20 years and run an equestrian school that is open to the public for horse riding and horse agistment.Graham Brooks & Associates, 2001  Description  Farm The present day Sugarloaf Farm is what remains of a once-extensive property located in the Menangle district.Graham Brooks & Associates, 2001, 2 The remainder of the farm (apart from what follows below) is fenced in a series of paddocks, which are used for horse grazing and agistment. The landscape is one of gently undulating hills rising from the floodplain of the Nepean River basin with Mount Sugarloaf being the main topographical feature. The land was extensively cleared for various pastoral uses in the 19th century and little native vegetation has survived, although some regeneration of the indigenous grey box (Eucalyptus moluccana)/Ironbark (E.crebra) Woodland is occurring on the more inaccessible areas of the site. Introduced African olives (Olea europaea var.cuspidata) are rampant on the steeper gradients, particularly on Mount Sugarloaf. Fencing is generally of late 20th century construction, although a few post-and-rail fences from the late 19th century have survived. The Sydney Water Supply (Upper) Canal is a prominent feature in the landscape, dividing the property with its serpentine form that follows a contour line around the hillside. This is a dominant feature of the north-west views from Mount Sugarloaf and is a well- consrtucted, and significant example of early 20th century engineering.Graham Brooks & Associates, 2001, 3 Garden and inner paddock A small remnant garden surrounds the house and the large paddock in front of the house provides a buffer between it and the recently realigned Menangle Road. Farm Complex The former dairy, stables and associated slip rails are located to the south-west of the homestead, on the main drive leading from Menangle Road. These structures are of mixed provenance, ranging from mid-19th century through to late 20th century. Farm Homestead The homestead is set well back from Menangle Road, on a slight rise, with the main elevation facing the road. It is a stone walled cottage with weatherboard additions to east (a room the entire width of the four-roomed stone cotttage) and north (three rooms and an outdoor toilet). A timber verandah protects its western \\"front\\" elevation. The stone cottage section includes an attic storey in the roof.Davies, 2007, 1 External walls enclosing spaces 01-05 are c.18\\" (460mm) solid sandstone, built from large blocks in rough but even courses of c.13\\" (330mm). Sills, lintels and stones around openings and at corners are more neatly-dressed. On the south wall the bottom of W.15 has been modified, indicating this was originally a door, the lintel is original. The window W.11 has been cut into the wall and the reveals been rendered. The sill shows evidence of modification to the course around it. There is no lintel. The bulk of the north wall has been covered by the weatherboard additions.Davies, 2007, 3 The homestead has a steeply-pitched gabled roof with a small stone skillion to the rear, a further rear addition (in asbestos cement cladding with a cement floor) from the 1950s and an 1880s verandah addition (recently rebuilt) to the front. It has been extended by a gabled weatherboard addition to the side of the house and a smaller attached timber skillion addition, both dating to the 1880s period.Davies, 2007, 2 additions to the north of the cottage are timber stud-framed with nominally 1\\" x 6\\" (25 x 150mm) lapped timber weatherboards with a chamfered edge. This is ranked as of high heritage significance. The western verandah enclosure to the south-west is in a similar type of board to the northern addition, and was contemporary with it () until the verandah was reconstructed in the 1980s. s additions to the east of the cottage is framed with studs and lined externally with a scalloped timber board approximately 150 x 19mm. The roof is a simple gabled structure clad with short sheet corrugated iron. Under the iron are timber shingles.Davies, 2007, 4  Condition  As at 29 November 2016, to be completed - CP underway  Modifications and dates  *To be completed - CP underway. *1950s: verandahs were reconstructed, but retain some 1880s fabric (of considerable significance).Davies, 2015  Heritage listing  As at 4 March 1999, Sugarloaf Farm is a largely intact farm complex dating from the 1840s through to the 1940s and demonstrating a range of uses throughout its life. The main homestead represents the first phase of use of the site for cereal cropping and the associated outbuildings represent various changes of use to dairying (1890s), horse and cattle studding (1940s) and riding school (1980s). The site has retained much of its original setting allowing a high degree of interpretation of the historic landscape. Sugarloaf Farm is of State Significance for its association with the early settlement and development of Menangle as a farming district. The farm has high historical, visual, aesthetic and research value as a remnant of an earlier cultural landscape. The surviving rural landscape setting has cultural significance due to its ability to demonstrate important aspects of the early European occupation such as early plantings, paddocks, fences, early grant areas and some archaeological features and sites. The farm is of state significance as it exhibits characteristics typical to Cumberland Plain colonial landscapes and setting, which are becoming increasingly rare in the Sydney region due to the pressure of modern urban development. The farm buildings themselves are amongst a declining number of rural groups surviving in the area, now part of the urban development edge of Campbelltown. The farmstead complex has high visual and aesthetic value, located in a prominent position and retaining elements of their original setting and a relationship to Menangle Road and the rural setting to the west and south. The farmhouse is of State significance as a good example of Colonial farmhouse in the Georgian style retaining much of its original form and fabric. The 1880s-1900 additions to the buildings allow interpretation and the changing needs of its occupants. The late nineteenth century farm buildings, particularly the remnant dairy, allow interpretation of a prosperous rural holding and demonstrate the changing farming practices and land usage of the district over a period of 160 years.Conservation Management Plan - Graham Brooks and Associates Sugarloaf Farm was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Sugarloaf Farm is significant for its role in the early settlement and development of Menangle as a farming district. The farm has a continuity of pastoral use over 160 years representing a pattern of use that is becoming rare in the area due to urban expansion. The stone farmhouse is a good example of a mid-Colonial rural dwelling, sited to take advantage of aspect and views. The dairy and associated structures are good examples of late nineteenth century to early twentieth century farm buildings associated with the once successful dairying interests of the property. The farm is associated with several prominent families such as the Bean, Taber and Huon families who were instrumental in the development of the district and the establishment of the farming activities, which characterised the area for over a century. The farm has retained extensive views of adjoining properties, particularly from Mount Sugarloaf, including \\"Glenlee\\" to the west, allowing interpretation of an earlier cultural landscape. A number of cultural plantings have survived, providing a connection to the early development of the farm and the Camden area generally. These include the Pepper trees and African Boxthorn hedges. The farm contains a section of the Sydney Water Supply Canal in its historic curtilage. The canal forms a significant part of the site and represents the political vision and planning of the time to overcome acute water supply problems faced by the city. Being part of the extensive dam building and irrigation works associated with the Nepean River Scheme, it represents an immense engineering achievement of the time, which eventually redefined the cultural landscape of the property. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The farm has high significance for the pioneering role of the Bean, Taber and Huon families in the area, particularly in the area of agriculture and for its association with James Bean, a colonial carpenter who worked on the second Judges Advocate's house. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The house has high aesthetic value for its form, its sitting, its well detailed and executed stonework and the competence and general integrity of the detailing. The surviving early interior joinery, believed to be the work of James Bean, is of high value. The house has high aesthetic value as a simple rustic rural dwelling, representative of modest Colonial Georgian architecture. The sitting of the house and outbuildings, originally surrounded by a network of similar holdings, provides a striking setting at the foot of Mount Sugarloaf. The farm has retained extensive views, particularly to the west, allowing a high degree of interpretation of an earlier cultural landscape, specifically by demonstrating the relationship between Sugarloaf Farm and the other large holdings in the area dating from the mid-Colonial period. The farm lands have high aesthetic value through their demonstration of varying land uses over a long period of time. The contrast between areas of naturally regenerating woodland and open paddocks has been compromised by later land uses but is still evident and reflects some of the early character of the farm. Although the introduction of Olives in the early twentieth century as hedging plant has devastated most of what remained of the native vegetation and obliterated evidence of earlier cultural plantings, some significant cultural plantings relating to the early settlement of grants in the area have survived. These include specifically, the pepper trees which are important cultural markers and the remnants of African Boxthorn which was used as a hedging plant to mark grant and paddock boundaries in the mid-Colonial and early-Victorian periods. These add to the aesthetic quality of the landscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The site has strong associations with the local community as an early rural farm. The farm has always occupied a significant position in the district, clearly identifiable by Mount Sugarloaf and originally formed part of a network of similar holdings established during the same period. The property is associated with several prominent families in the district, most particularly the Taber, Bean and Huon families. All three families were instrumental in the settlement and development of the district in its early years and James Bean has a wider association with the development of the colony through his work as a carpenter. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The 1830s fabric demonstrates Colonial construction techniques and use of materials. The 1880s fabric demonstrates construction techniques and material usage of the Victorian period. The holding demonstrates changing farm practices and land uses over a long period of time and their effects on both the cultural and native landscape. The various changes to the house demonstrate the evolution of a small but successful farm and the changing needs of its occupants. The surviving cultural plantings demonstrate the early uses of introduced species and particularly their uses as cultural and boundary markers. The farm has scientific potential in terms of the few archaeological sites, which may relate to earlier farm sites on some of the early grants. The farm house and the remnant dairies are also potentially important in terms of their historical archaeology. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Sugarloaf exhibits characteristics atypical to Cumberland Plain colonial landscapes, which are becoming increasingly rare in the Sydney region due to the pressure of modern urban development. Few of the major holdings in the area, from the same period of settlement, have survived. The notable exceptions are \\"Glenlee\\" and \\"Mt Gilead in the immediate area, and the \\"Camden Park Estate\\". None of the smaller holdings, which originally formed the Sugarloaf Farm consolidation appear to have survived and very few traces of the existence of these smaller holdings can be discerned in the present landscape. The farm generally and the house, in particular, exhibit a degree of intactness allowing interpretation of the site's history and former occupation. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The house, dairy and associated structures are representative of farm buildings of their respective periods. The farmhouse building is a typical Colonial rural dwelling and is well designed and executed. The farmhouse and outbuildings are representative of the first period of settlement in the district. They are key focal elements of the early pastoral landscape and indicate the early development of the district.

He was born on a farm in Pearsall, Texas and was educated at Pearsall High School. He entered the University of San Antonio (now Trinity University) in 1939, transferring to the University of Texas at Austin in 1941, where he was awarded a BSME in June 1943. In the same year, he had married Grace Elizabeth Zirkel, with whom he had 4 children. Following graduation he worked during World War II for Westinghouse Electric Corporation in Pennsylvania, conducting fatigue tests on gas turbine blades and designing bearings and lubrication systems for aircraft gas turbines. In 1947 Rylander was appointed assistant professor at UT Austin, where he taught heat and power engineering, machine design, and tribology. He was awarded an MS degree in 1952. He was granted leave of absence to work for a Ph.D. degree on the behavior of multiphase lubricants at Georgia Institute of Technology, which was awarded in 1965. In 1968 UT Austin promoted him professor. In 1970, he began a research project on the design of homopolar generators, which store large amounts of energy and discharge high-powered short duration pulses of electricity. This work led to the founding of the Center for Electromechanics (CEM) in 1977, which Rylander himself directed until 1985, during which period CEM grew into a world-class research unit concentrating on the development of pulsed electric power and inertial energy storage machines.

It was built in 1837 by John Farley. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The original inhabitants of the area were mostly people of the Tharawal (sometimes referred to as Dharawal) people, who ranged from the coast to the east, the Georges River in the west, north to Botany Bay and south to Nowra. However Campbelltown was a meeting point with the Dharug language group (whose area extended across the Blue Mountains) and early history of the area includes references to both peoples.Liston, 1988; www.abc.net.au/indigenous With establishment of the convict colony in Sydney in 1788 the displacement of Aboriginal people began. A smallpox epidemic decimated many of the coastal clans, but was less destructive amongst the inland peoples. Escaped cattle from the convict settlement moved south and bred in the Campbelltown/Camden area and after their (re-) discovery in 1795, the area became known as the \\"Cow Pastures\\" (or Cowpasture). In 1805 Jon Macarthur obtained a grant of (later expanded to ) in the area, some of the best grazing land then known in the colony. By 1809 34 settlers had received grants in the newly named Minto district (named after Lord Minto, the Governor-General of India) in the northern portion of Campbelltown. Many of these were Irish, including surveyor James Meehan, who allocated himself a generous portion (now Macquarie Fields). Prominent settlers included Charles Throsby, who was allocated (now Glenfield), Dr. William Redfern (Campbellfield), Dr. John Townson (Varroville (homestead)) and Richard Brooks (Denham Court). Though peaceful, the Tharawal people bore the brunt of a punitive expedition led by Captain James Wallis in 1816. At least 14 Tharawal people were massacred at the Appin Massacre, to the distress of sympathetic settlers such as Throsby of Glenfield. Corroborees and other ceremonies continued under the protection of the Macarthurs of Camden Park, though numbers steadily declined. As the district became more densely settled a town was needed further south than Liverpool. Campbelltown was formally established in 1820 and named in honour of Mrs Elizabeth Macquarie's maiden name, Campbell. In 1826 the town plan was formalised. Denfield The original house and a roofed but open sided link to the original kitchen block behind it, was completed between 1835-7 by a John Farley. Farley arrived from England in 1812 and became what was described at the time as a \\"sober, hard working and prosperous farmer\\" on approximately . His claim to fame was that he was the first man to see 'Fisher's Ghost',('sitting on a rail of a bridge over a creek. He claimed the ghost pointed to a paddock down the creek then faded away. The body of Fred Fisher was later discovered in the same paddock where this ghost had supposedly pointed' Mr Tim Doyle, acting principal of Ray White Macarthur Group said': Ray White Macarthur Group P/L, 2014), the centre of a local legend involving murder and intrigue. Campbelltown farms produced wheat for the colony. This crop was short-lived as the disease \\"wheat rust\\" infected the area.Mann-Made Planning, 2013, 3 Farley sold the property to John Bray in 1840. Bray owned other properties to the south and used Denfield as a cattle fattening holding farm, closer to the Sydney markets for stock from his other more distant holdings. Bray married three times, each of his first two wives dying at Denfield. The third wife outlived him and was still in residence in the early 1900s. It is thought that for some time the building became an inn. Following the death of the third Mrs Bray the property was rented over a number of years, substantial parcels of land were hived off and sold and Denfield's homestead fell into disrepair. The property was purchased in the 1960s by architect Sydney Palmer and renovated (cf restored) in 1964. A December 1965 article in \\"Building Ideas\\" showcased the \\"sensitive restoration and renovation, installation of electrical service and plumbing which have made Denfield a house for modern living while still preserving its early colonial character.\\" It noted that the original detached kitchen had become a bedroom, with bathroom and laundry added. Where possible original materials were reused, e.g.: sandstock brocks for rebuilding the southern wall and the 6\\" wide blackbutt boards for flooring drawing room, study and dining rooms. New verandah columns were designed in the spirit of the original period to replace the then existing mid-or late-Victorian columns. The graceful valance board was cut from a template of the original valance, still in position, by decayed beyond use. All walls were stripped and re-plastered, ceilings replaced with Gyprock sheets and plaster cornices. In 1970 Palmer sold the property to the Sefton family who operated it as a lavender farm for ten years. In the 1970s the urbanisation of Campbelltown started with significant urban expansion in the district. While the start of subdivision of St. Helens Park did not start until the 1990s and the subdivision stage around Denfield until the mid-1990s, the smaller lot and housing future of the locality/suburb was sealed with the demise of farming and planned urban development.Mann-Made Planning, 2013, 3-4 In 1985 it was sold to Mr and Mrs Robinson who spent on maintenance and improvements, including eradicating termites in the house, outbuildings and fencing, and planting over 1400 trees and shrubs. In 1987 the property was about , zoned Special Uses, surrounded by land zoned 2(c) residential. The Heritage Council of NSW approved a four-lot subdivision of the property on 7 March 1991, subject to moving the then-proposed eastern boundary of Lot 1 (containing Denfield homestead and slab hut and an original fence) further east by .Heritage Council minutes, 7/3/1991 On 24/7/1991 the Minister for Planning signed an exemption thus not requiring Heritage Council approval for subdivision and residential use of Lot 4 which is to the east of Lot 1. This order was gazetted on 2 August 1991 in the NSW Government Gazette no. 112. Approximately was sold to Landcom, approx. retained by Mrs Robinson and the remaining was sold to the previous owners, the Laws, in 1992. The Laws lived in Denfield for over 23 years, undertaking restoration to the house and garden areas, with the assistance of Federal Government and Campbelltown City Council grants.Pearson-Smith, 2008, 13 They built the two modern outbuildings in 1997 (to the house's north-west, near the pool) and (a southern pavilion, connected to the house).GBA Heritage, 2016 1994 and 1997 proposals to rezone land nearby to the north on Appin Road for a service station would have further eroded Denfield's remaining semi-rural setting into suburbia. The Heritage Office provided advice recommending against such actions.Heritage Office report, 2008/4/18 Denfield's previous owners the Laws in 1999 bought an additional acreLot 122 directly to its south, to increase the curtilage around the main house on the south, where the house was very close to the then southern boundary. The property now comprises . Lot 122 was acquired by the Laws so they could control when it would be subdivided, with appropriate development, rather than what was occurring locally at that time by others.Mann-Made Planning, abridged, 2013, 4 The Laws lodged a subdivision proposal in a 2013 application involving Lot 101 (Denfield House, etc.), to undertake a boundary adjustment between Lot 101 and Lot 122 and then subdivide the latter into four allotments. Following discussions with the Heritage Council, this subdivision application was withdrawn. The 2013 subdivision and four-lot proposal was likely to have resulted in unacceptable impact on Denfield by inadequate setbacks from the western frontage available for a future dwelling. Following this withdrawal, the Laws sold Denfield house lot (101) to the present owners, the Duffys.GBA Heritage, 2016, 4  Description  Site More than of land across two separate titles with three street frontages.Ray White P/L, 2014 Denfield is located on a prominent knoll on the Appin Road. It is now surrounded to the north, east and south by suburban development with a local service station impinging on views to it from the Appin Road.Morris & Britton, 2000, 124 Denfield comprises two lots (101 and 122) on the top of a hill with access from Appin Road to its west. Lot 101 is effectively the remaining house and garden-site at the core of its original farm.Mann-made Planning, 2013, 3 With increasing width and traffic on Appin Road the RTA has provided separate access. The site is well landscaped, including major trees and shrubs, with what remains of its original \\"home\\" garden. It classically occupies a prominent position on level ground on the top of a raised section of land, where Appin Road and surrounding land drops away on each side to the north, west and south.Pearson Smith & Associates, 2005 There is a dam/in-ground swimming pool and a small orchard adjoining the house. The boundary of the proposed 5000m2 curtilage is now defined, as is the whole property, by trees and shrubs. The land beyond is some .Rathgeber, 1990 Prettily sited and surrounded by trees (AHC). Buildings ;Homestead A Georgian colonial cottage set back from Appin Road. Cottage is of symmetrical plan built by John Farley. Construction is of sandstone brick on stone foundations with timber verandah under continuous hipped roof, having slight bull cast at verandah junction. Sandstock brick walls and chimneys, predominantly timber floor framing and timber floor boarding, original lath and plaster ceilings, some new fibrous plaster ceilings and cornices, some original timber (blacbutt: Ray White Macarthur Group, 2014) boarded ceilings and cornices, original cedar joinery including superbly hand crafted cedar mantlepiece and fireplace cupboard in the drawing room, original galvanized corrugated iron roof and water tank sheeting, ogee gutters and round downpipes in parts and intrusive gutters with square downpipes elsewhere, painted timber linings, joinery and decorative timberwork, stone flagging and timber tank stands. The main building is of masonry rendered and marked as stone with a gabled, corrugated iron clad roof and verandah to three sides supported on stop chamfered timber posts. It has three rendered brickwork chimneys with terracotta pots.LEP, 1991 Windows are twelve pane type with louvred shutters and doors six panel type. Simple semi-circular Georgian fanlight to the panelled (fielded) front door. Sandstone used for architraves to main openings and paving to verandah.National Trust, 1973 Verandah is open full length on the western (Appin Road) side, return verandah across the northern end has been filled in with sympathetic painted timber and glazed panels and doors. Four bedrooms and three bathrooms plus study.Ray White Macarthur Group P/L, 2014 Fireplaces have Georgian chimney pieces. Windows are twelve pane type with louvred shutters and doors six panel type. Verandah is decorated with a fine scalloped timber valance (AHC). Air conditioning and a wine cellar. ;Outbuildings: There is an existing roofed but open sided walkway running off the rear door of the house linking with an existing single storey original external kitchen structure. Quite separate from the house and kitchen is an in ground swimming pool, wood shed, workshop and carport. There is also a slab hut used as a museum for old implements. There is also a dam/swimming pool and a timber structure used as a garage, workshop and toolshed. A number of other buildings and structures also exist including slab shed, timber structure, workshop, carport, cricket pitch and water tanks that hold of water.  Condition  As at 24 July 2014, some new fibrous plaster ceilings and cornices, some original timber boarded ceilings and cornices, original cedar joinery, original galvanized corrugated iron roof and water tank sheeting, ogee gutters and round downpipes in parts and intrusive gutters with square downpipes elsewhere, painted timber linings, joinery and decorative timberwork, stone flagging and timber tank stands.  Modifications and dates  1964 renovation: A December 1965 article in \\"Building Ideas\\" showcased the \\"sensitive restoration and renovation, installation of electrical service and plumbing which have made Denfield a house for modern living while still preserving its early colonial character.\\" It noted that the original detached kitchen had become a bedroom, with bathroom and laundry added.

The graceful valance board was cut from a template of the original valance, still in position, by decayed beyond use. All walls were stripped and re-plastered, ceilings replaced with Gyprock sheets and plaster cornices. 1991 subdivision was to excise some 2/3 of land of prpoerty, to allow for future residential development. The proposed subdivision was not considered to adversely affect the significance of the house and an outbuilding. It was not advertised.  Heritage listing  As at 27 February 2007, Denfield's homestead is assessed as having state and regional heritage significance primarily in regard to its architectural quality, social and historic associations particularly at a regional level and in its setting, garden and collective of buildings. The complex is one of the earliest surviving and intact collective of buildings of their kind in the Campbelltown and Appin areas. Denfield is associated with early farming identities John Farley, who was also infamous in that he was the first person to encounter Fisher's Ghost in Campbelltown and John Bray who along with his family owner and farmed it form 1840 until will into the 1900s. It played an important part in the early settlement of Campbelltown/Appin through increasing importance and popularity of the district. The early buildings form part of a highly significant group of surviving colonial farmhouse buildings in the Campbelltown/ Appin areas with the visually intact garden and bush setting. The early buildings are a very fine and rare example of the colonial farmhouse style of architecture, even though altered a number of times, and is of very high aesthetic value not only here but also in the broader context of NSW. The surviving early fabric demonstrates the basic principles of colonial design, detailing and finishes. The buildings are significant for the use of early colonial materials and methods of construction and building forms and their adaptation over their life with a variety of materials. The buildings demonstrate colonial design principles in best practice. Denfield has been at the focus of farming in the Campbelltown/Appin areas since the 1830s. It has a strong connection with the development and history of the area through social interactions and contributions by its owners and residents to the private, public and farming life of Campbelltown and Appin. The early buildings are a very fine and rare example of the colonial farmhouse style of architecture which is very intact. The homestead is representative of the time of use and development from this period and typical of the early colonial farmhouse complex in a large garden and bush setting.Pearson Smith & Associates, 2003 Denfield is reputed to have been built in 1837 by John Farley, the man who claimed to have seen Fisher's Ghost. It is a good example of the smaller farmhouse of its time. With a central doorway, two windows with shutters on each side and one door at each end of the stone flagged walk. The walls are rendered and marked as stone and the roof is corrugated iron. It is a well proportioned colonial farmhouse built in the traditional style. Denfield was carefully restored in the 1960s by architect S.C Palmer.Kingston, 1990 An excellent example of a typical farmhouse of the 1830s that remains in good condition (AHC). A colonial farmhouse and remnant of a colonial farm.

Life Bielik was an editor of Svedectvo (\\"Testimony\\"), a journal published by the Political Prisoners' Association of Anti-Communist Resistance (PV ZPKO), and an official representative of the PV ZPKO. The journal, which has been criticized by Slovakia's Jewish community, is noted for undercurrents of antisemitism and frequently publishing apologetic, mythologizing articles about convicted Slovak nationalist war criminals. Following the death of J√°n Lango≈°, the director of the National Memory Institute, in 2006, the rightwing Slovak National Party (SNS) proposed Bielik as a candidate for his replacement. In an article the previous year, Bielik had criticized the documentary Miluj bl√≠≈æneho svojho (\\"Love thy neighbor\\"), about the Topoƒæƒçany pogrom, because he felt it was anti-Catholic. Instead, Bielik cited contemporary reports stating that \\"the Jews behaved very arrogantly and imperiously, trying to systematically occupy important positions in the economic, public, and political spheres\\". In his article, Bielik made no mention of the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of the majority of Slovak Jews, and was perpetrated by the collaborationist Slovak State in concert with Nazi Germany. Bielik presents Slovaks who stole from Jews during the war as victims of the Jews' efforts to regain their property, and the Jews as ungrateful to the majority of Slovaks to whom they supposedly owed their lives. His perspective was criticized by the contemporary Slovak media, which identified him as a supporter of the Slovak State. The Slovak Jewish newspaper Delet criticized Bielik for blaming Jews for the Topoƒæƒçany pogrom and accused him of minimizing the Holocaust. American historian Nadya Nedelsky compared Bielik's portrayal of the Jews with that of President Jozef Tiso, a noted Holocaust perpetrator in Slovakia: to Tiso, Slovak people were victims saving themselves by deporting Jews, while to Bielik, the Slovaks are \\"victims and saviors of these [Jewish] perpetrators\\". As a result of the controversy, he withdrew his candidacy for the directorship. However, he still ran for the Board of Directors, whose nominees have to be approved by the Slovak Parliament; he was unsuccessful. In 2008, Bielik published a book titled Masoneria ‚Äì nieszczƒô≈õcie naszych czas√≥w (\\"Freemasonry ‚Äî the plague of our time\\"), in which he blamed Freemasons for a host of social problems, including \\"revolts, upheavals, revolutions, murders... heresy, secularization, atheism, spiritualism, reincarnation, radical feminism, pornography, artificial contraception, sterilization, divorce, abortion and euthanasia\\" according to the Polish magazine Focus.

It was designed by Henry Kitchen and built from 1824 to 1859 by Robert Gooch and Nathaniel Payton. It is also known as Glenlee, outbuildings, garden & gatelodge. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Dharawal Aboriginal people were the occupants of the area until the Europeans arrived and they recorded, in a sandstone shelter nearby, the cattle which had escaped from the first British settlement at Sydney Cove in 1788 and established themselves on the good grazing ground in the Menangle-Camden district (which came to be called \\"the Cow Pastures\\"). When the first squatters arrived in the district after 1800 there was no initial conflict, but the acceleration of the process of land grants produced increasing tension between the settlers and the Aboriginal people, culminating in the Appin massacre in 1816. Gradually after that the number of Aborigines diminished through disease and alienation of their traditional hunting grounds. Following the lead of the wild cattle, the earliest use of the Mount Annan district by farmers was for cattle grazing. By 1810 John Macarthur held at Camden Park on the west side of the Nepean River and in 1818 Governor Macquarie granted on the eastern side of the river to William Howe, a Scottish free settler who had arrived in 1816. Howe's estate was called Glenlee after his birthplace in Scotland. Howe who was an agricultural entrepreneur, Magistrate and later a Superintendent of Police. By 1820 he had expanded his property to over and was shipping wool to London.Britton & Morris, 2000 Between 1821 and 1823 Glenlee produced wheat and meat for the government stores. He was also produced dairy products for the Sydney market in the 1820s.Kemp, 2001 The homestead was designed in 1823 by Henry Kitchen, the first non-convict architect and built for William and Mary Howe in 1823-4, partly on land Howe had purchased in 1816 from Michael Hayes. Convict labour was used to establish the farm and build the outbuildings, with Howe declaring that he had 9 acres of garden or orchard in the 1822 muster (in a total of which he held through grant, lease or purchase) . Robert Gooch and Nathaniel Payton were contracted to build the homestead in April 1823 to a plan by Henry Kitchen. By 1824 Howe had occupied Glenlee House which he had built to a design by architect Henry Kitchen. By the 1828 census Howe's land transactions had stabilised to a holding of - cleared and cultivated. In 1832 the \\"New South Wales Calendar and General Post Office Directory\\" described the gardens as \\"extensive, the vinery being in a forward state\\". Howe was the first magistrate of the county of Airds. In 1833 Mrs Felton Mathew described the farm \\"a nearer spot is \\"Glenlee\\", the proprietor of which is also an old settler is distinguished by his attention to the cultivation of English grasses: the best, if not the only hay in the country, is grown here: and Mr Howe has, it is said, laid out his grounds with true good taste in the best English style, dividing the meadows with hedges instead of the rough wooden fences everywhere use: many other large tracts of cleared land we could distinguish from our elevated situation\\". Mrs Mathew also continued, noting that the principal crop in the district was wheat, and \\"peas are grown in fields about here, the only part of the country in which I have seen them so cultivated\\". By 1834 the property was regarded as the one of the finest in the colony with meadows divided by hedges of quince and lemon trees and an established vinery. Glenlee's famous butter, Sun and Thistle, was the first ever exported to England from New South Wales. In 1837 the Reverend John Dunmore Lang visited Glenlee and described it: \\"About three miles beyond Campbelltown to the right is the dairy farm or estate of Glenlee - there is a large extent of cleared land on the Glenlee estate, the greater part of which has been laid down with English grasses, the paddocks being separated from each other by hedges of quince or lemon tree - the usual but seldom used Colonial substitutes for the hawthorn. The country is of an undulating character, and the scenery from Glenlee House - a handsome two-storey house built partly of brick and partly of a drab-coloured sandstone - is rich and most agreeably diversified\\".Prescott, 2003 Glenlee estate as one of the best dairy farms in the colony was unusual and half a century before dairying was generally practised in the district it was adopted here (i.e.: in the 1820s).Liston, 1988. During the 1830s, '40s and '50s Glenlee, famous for its \\"Sun and Thistle\\" butter, was largely farmed by tenants. Some dairy products were exported to England. Speculation and the 1840s depression led to Glenlee being mortgaged but the family remained lessees. Howe died in 1855 and his wife sold the property to James Fitzpatrick and it remained in his family (with various subdivisions to members of the family) until 1968 when it was purchased by the State Planning Authority, which gazetted it as a place of historic interest in 1973. Fitzpatrick had come to Australia as a convict in 1822 and worked as a servant of Hamilton Hume, the explorer and farmer. Fitzpatrick's crime was described as \\"insurrection\\" but it is not clear just what was the cause or details...When Captain William Hovell (who had been granted of adjoining land to the north at \\"Naralling Grange\\" in 1816) and his colleague Hamilton Hume organised their famous 1824 expedition to find the land route to the southern coast of Victoria, they chose Fitzpatrick to be in the party as an assigned convict. Hovell, in his diary in 1825, described James Fitzpatrick as 'a gentleman who in an unfortunate moment committed an offence for which he is enduring a punishment far too severe\\". After the expedition and through various opportunities, Fitzpatrick became prosperous in the colony as a farmer and land owner. He bought the large \\"Glenlee\\" estate in the late 1850s and extended his property all the way through (north) to Narellan, including the land first owned by Hovell. When Fitzpatrick died, three children inherited the land and his daughter Elizabeth married Edward Sedgwick and built the present \\"Narellan Grange\\" house in 1894. The name of Sedgwick was then associated with the property (Narellan Grange) until well into the 20th century. Edward Sedgwick was mayor of Campbelltown in 1899. His son Frederick Joseph \\"Mate\\" Sedgwick, was a prominent dairy industry leader and the producers' representative director on the NSW Milk Board for many years.Wrigley, c.2003 The route for the new Southern Railway line was surveyed in 1857. When constructed in 1866, the line was sited in a cutting in close proximity to Glenlee house, maintaining views from the house over the property. James Fitzpatrick by the 1860s owned most of the farms west from Campbelltown toward Narellan and many south toward Menangle. In the 1850s the dairy operation appears to have dwindled and sheep production increased. In the 1870s a large part of the estate was leased to small tenant farmers who produced fruit and vegetables. These included a Chinese migrant, \\"Old Shoo\\" who maintained a flourishing market garden adjacent to the railway tracks. The estate at this time was probably dotted with as many as two dozen cottages within walking distance of the main homestead. In 1883 the colonnade was rebuilt on the main facade. In the 1890s the house underwent considerable remodelling. It was rendered in stucco, resashed, the front door replaced, the chair boards and other original joinery details removed inside. C.1900 the roof, originally shingled, was replaced by corrugated iron. The interior walls were wallpapered (and remained so until the 1970s)(Kemp,2001). Before Appin was so well catered for by the shop keepers, horses and carts would pay weekly visits almost from the turn of the (20th) century, coming from Campbelltown, Menangle and other places, loaded with groceries, fruit and vegetables, drapery, etc. The earliest I recall would be a Chinaman's vegetable cart which would travel over from Glenlee, where there was a big garden on the bank of the Nepean River.Percival, 1992, 53 In 1905 Glenlee (3500 acres) remained the largest farm in the district, and was leased to Conroy and Doyle, who planned converting it into a sheep farm (this was overturned by a public meeting at the time). Three dairies were still active on the estate, and were given over to market gardens, employing 32. In 1910 John Glenlee Fitzpatrick took up residence at Glenlee, neighbouring Smeaton Grange was occupied by James Fitzpatrick's daughter Elizabeth Sedgwick and the other daughter lived at nearby Kilbride overlooking Mount Gilead. The family operated their own dairy at Glenlee and employed herdsmen. In 1911 a NSW Minister of Health decided on Glenlee as a possible location for a mental institution. When the Fitzpatricks refused to sell, he threatened to take 500 acres of the property over. As a delaying tactic, part of the land at issue was sold to a miner, Mr Clinton, as a place to store his coal. With a change of government these plans were dropped. Clinton later began dumping coal at Glenlee again in 1959. Shortly before World War I began in 1914, local architect Alfred Rose Payten suggested to James Glenlee Fitzpatrick that the property would be a good location for a race track and in 1914 Menangle Park Racecourse was built nearby. In the 1930s the original chimney pieces were replaced and new bathrooms installed Higginbotham's examination of a 1947 aerial photograph concluded that \\"land on the alluvial flats to the east of the main hose at Glenlee formed the centre for historical land cultivation. Remaining land on Glenlee does not appear to have been extensively cultivated and was more likely used for pasture.\\" Adequate pasture was an essential part of dairying. When the NSW Government's proposal to resume Glenlee for a new mental hospital was debated from 1946‚Äì50, the local member Jeff Bate argued vigorously against the move as Glenlee was still a working dairy farm and market garden (likely the area of intensive cultivation) with 32 employees and of historical importance. In 1949 the property had three working dairies and part of a fourth on it, and supplied 1,200,000 pints of milk to the city through the Campbelltown Depot of Dairy Farmers Cooperative Company Ltd. The Fitzpatricks at that time were pure (stock) breeders. The Campbelltown-Camden-Picton area at that time was the centre for the breeding of Ayrshire cattle for the Commonwealth and the Fitzpatricks had stud stock on the property which had won prizes against such famous breeders of Ayrshires as the McIntosh brothers (of Denbigh) and Camden Park Estate Ltd, at the Camden, Campbelltown and Royal Sydney Shows. Objections to the proposed mental hospital came from the Cumberland County Council, Milk Board, Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board and Campbelltown Municipal Council.Campbelltown News, 1949 Glenlee was acquired by the State Planning Authority/ Macarthur Development Board in 1968/9. In 1969 architect John Fisher (member of the Institute of Architects, the Cumberland County Council Historic Buildings Committee and on the first Council of the National Trust of Australia (NSW) after its reformation in 1960) was commissioned by the State Planning Authority to restore the first five houses in Campbelltown, which had been resumed under the Cumberland County Planning Scheme. They included Glenalvon House.Lucas & McGinness 2012. In 1978 the house was listed on the Register of the National Estate and in 1977/8 received National Estate Funding of $33,000 which funded waterproofing works. 1977/8 it received National Estate Funding of $33,000 funding restoration of houseClive Lucas of Fisher Lucas, for SPA focussing on waterproofing works. A new kitchen was added. Interiors were restored substantially to their 1820s appearance, except for the drawing room which was maintained in its 1890s style. Many original features e.g.: painting scheme, were uncovered with removal of wallpapers. In 1982 the house and part of its estate (bounded by the Main Southern Railway on the west) was made subject of a Permanent Conservation Order under the NSW Heritage Act 1977. Meanwhile, the larger estate was designated a Scenic Protection zone in 1975 and part of it set aside for development of a botanic garden in 1984. In 1988 Mount Annan Botanic Garden was opened, administered by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, as Australia's largest botanic garden devoted entirely to native flora. Glenlee house and its surrounding land have since been sold back into private ownership on . In 1983 damaged sections of stair wall were restored by William Whitlam and much Georgian cedar joinery was renewed. In 1984 old cobblestones were gradually uncovered, a bathroom altered from its 1930s style to a simple, modern style, landscaping under Michael Lehany and James Broadbent was undertaken to restore its earlier geometry and reinstate the main western front as the main focus and screen the coal wash to the west. Restoration of the slab building stables (predating 1842) also occurred. An olive grove (7000 trees) has been established by the current owners (growing olives and making extra virgin olive oil) on higher land to the southeast and north-eastern sides of the homestead in the .Everett, 2002 Until the 1950s the Glenlee and Camden Park estates comprised an uninterrupted rural landscape spanning the Nepean River. However increasing production of coal from the Burragorang/ Nattai River mines to the southwest, and the need to transport it to the export loading plant at Balmain in Sydney, led to construction by the Joint Coal Board of a washery and transhipment facility at Glenlee, between Mount Annan and the river, in the 1950s. Coal mining had become an increasingly important industry from the 1930s. A two kilometre rail spur to this facility, named Clinton's siding, was constructed from the Main Southern Railway in December 1958. The line was electrified as part of the extension of metropolitan railway electrification to Campbelltown in 1968. The use of the coal facility peaked in the 1960s and 1970s but was scaled down from the late 1980s due to its potential environmental impact on the Nepean River, though the facility remains in use and is a significant element in the local landscape. In 1993 the Glenlee Composting Facility commenced operation on the site, producing soil mixes, mulches and topdressing material for rehabilitation of the coal facility and for the horticultural and landscaping industries.  Description  Farm Significant colonial rural cultural landscape, with deliberately sited curving entrance road to give dramatic view of homestead group and river and mountains beyond, past a gate lodge, a square stuccoed brick building with a hipped, originally timber shingled roof, later corrugated iron-clad. Wider landscape is of grazed paddocks, with stands of remnant older indigenous trees, particularly on higher ground. An olive grove has been established southeast and northeast of the house in the c.1990s. Homestead Group A careful composition of homestead and outbuildings and gardens, on a raised platform for wide views to the south, west and north. A fine composition of farm/ estate outbuildings lie to the south/south-east of the homestead, uphill. Historic vineyards were also on this southern/south-eastern side of the homestead. Remnant core estate including formal drive access way of a rare colonial farm estate, with important individual elements including: * the 1820s homestead; * outbuildings to the homestead's south and south-east, forming a courtyard; * farm buildings further to the south-east; * a gatehouse (now a ruin) and nearby relatively-recently built Olive processing building on the approach drive; * and various lawns and garden plantings. Garden Plantings include a signature Bunya Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) south- east of the house, a huge forest red gum (Eucalyptus tereticornis) and silky oak (Grevillea robusta) north-west of the house. Impressive garden around homestead with many older remnant plantings, including pines and angophoras. Other mature trees north-west of the house include Mediterranean cypress (Cupressus sempervirens), European olive (Olea africana var.europeana cv.). Other mature plantings include a huge old kurrajong (Brachychiton populneus) near the stables block east of the house, a Brazilian pepper(corn) tree (Schinus molle var.areira) east of the house, a privet hedge (Ligustrum spp.) north-east of the house. Younger contributory plantings include brush box trees (Lophostemon confertus) and jacaranda (J.mimosifolia) south-west of the house.Stuart Read pers.comm., 7 November 2016. ;Views and framing plantings: The homestead enjoys a broad panoramic view (southwest to northwest) across the Great Southern Railway line to and an important visual connection between the Great Dividing Range, Nepean River and Camden Park estate ridgeline. Low Cape honeysuckle (Tecomaria capensis) hedges underline the panoramic views out to Mount Annan in the north-west, and frame views west and south-west towards Camden Park, the Razorback and the Great Dividing Ranges. Lower again hedges of sweet box (Murraya paniculata) and Cape leadwort (Plumbago capensis) define inner areas of garden such as a rear \\"courtyard\\" east of the house. Beds of hardy perennials and ground covers such as Nile / African lilies (Agapanthus praecox), bird-of-paradise flower (Strelitzia reginae). There is a dramatic and impressive view of Glenlee homestead and its broad landscape opening up suddenly near the crest of the access road (Glenlee Road) from off Menangle Road. Homestead Regency Colonial homestead, two storeys, of brick and sandstone. Very formal Palladian composition inspired more by Palladio's work and writing rather than by English Whig country architecture's usual interpretation of it. Single range building, with a substantial central stair hall projecting into the rear verandahs, one room to either side and box rooms at the corners in enclosed bays. Unusual recessed verandah on main facade. By recessing the ground floor verandah into the body of the house in the form of a portico or loggia (southwest face) the main rooms on the upper floor became disproportionally larger - by half as much again, than those on the ground floor. Also unusual is the cantilevered stone staircase at the rear (east) of the house, reputedly the oldest such staircase in Australia. Continuous sill or string course to the first floor windows. Projecting externally expressed stairwell in square form. Gabled or pedimented detached single storey offices on south side, was kitchen and offices and housing for domestic staff, while the convicts were locked up in the cellar below. The dairy operation was inside the servants' quarters, or rather, these grew up around it. The work resembles that of Francis Greenway, Colonial Architect, based on Kitchen's death in 1822 and similarities in design with Greenway's Liverpool hospital and other works.Broadbent & Hughes, 1997 ;Outbuildings: * outbuildings to the homestead's south and south-east, forming a courtyard ;Farm Buildings: *Farm buildings further to the south-east; including a slab stables (rebuilt after damage by a fire); and further outbuildings now functioning as an outdoor entertaining area for events. ;Gate House and Olive-Processing Shed: * A gatehouse (now a ruin) and nearby relatively-recently built Olive processing building on the approach drive  Condition  Much of the land with the exception of close to the homestead group, has been ploughed to plant olive trees.

Heritage listing  As at 22 February 2012, the Glenlee estate is a rural cultural landscape of exceptional significance including elements of Aboriginal heritage significance, association with early influential European settlers and the exceptional composition of the architecture and landscape setting of the homestead group. It is the core remnant including the accessway of the Glenlee estate, an important and rare surviving early 19th century pastoral holding in the Mount Annan/Menangle district of the Cow Pastures once considered as one of the best and earliest dairy farms in the colony. The estate was one of the first farms in Sydney's west to make the change from cereal cropping to dairying in the 19th century and the property continued to prosper throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The landscape of the area of the estate is of exceptional aesthetic value as a rare reminder of the former pastoral industry which once characterised the area. It is still possible to appreciate the siting of the homestead in view of, and with frontage to, the Nepean River as part of the original land grant. The mid-19th century Southern Railway, though sited close to the homestead group, was constructed to maintain this visual relationship. The siting of the homestead group in a context of undulating landform, is an outstanding example of colonial landscape planning to form a picturesque composition with direct sightlines to the neighbouring Camden Park estate and the Great Dividing Range. The Glenlee homestead group is a rare and significant complex of buildings and plantings, approached by a formal drive and sited with commanding views over the countryside to the west and south-west. It includes the remnant core of a rare early colonial farm estate focussed on the fine and sophistocated Regency design of the main house with its rare recessed portico. In addition it includes its original servants' wing, outbuildings, farm buildings, a gatehouse and early plantings including a landmark bunya pine near the house. The homestead dates from 1823 and is one of only a handful of early surviving colonial houses in the Sydney region, remarkable for its level of integrity and its original setting on the estate amongst 19th century farm buildings and plantings. It demonstrates exceptional architectural sophistocation for the period of construction (c.1823) and a rare example of Old Colonial Regency style, of which both Henry Kitchen and Francis Greenway (both of whom the house's design has been attributed to) were key practitioners. Glenlee is significant for its association with free settler William Howe and family. Howe established the estate, was instrumental in establishing the Bank of NSW in Camden, and an important early free colonist who did much to promote pastoral interests in Sydney's west, and was one of the first farmers in the district to successfully make the change from cereal cropping to dairying. Glenlee is also significant for its association with emancipated convict James Fitzpatrick and his family, who were responsible for the continued expansion of the estate and for its operation as a successful dairy farm. The family were prominent local citizens and remained in residence at Glenlee for over a century, demonstrating a remarkable pattern of continued usage of the property. Howe and Fitzpatrick families held Glenlee from to 1859 and 1859 to 1968/9 respectively, and the history of these families on the estate is a microcosm of the development of colonial Australia in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Glenlee is also significant for its association with Colonial architect Henry Kitchen, and also with Colonial Architect Francis Greenway, who may have played a role in its redesign. The area close to the house has high archaeological potential associated with its occupation and use by the Dharawal Aboriginal people prior to and immediately after European settlement, and for its association with the former pastoral uses of the estate, its outbuildings and former outbuildings. The area presents some opportunities to study and interpret the lifestyle and culture of the Dharawal people, through interpretation of the landscape and the discovery of associated artefacts. It also presents opportunities to study and interpret the former pastoral and continuting agricultural uses of the estate and area. Glenlee was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Majors Lewin Friedrich von Ambotten, her father, was in the service of the archbishops of M√ºnster. He came, originally, from the Kurland region in what has subsequently become part of Latvia. In 1777 she married Captain Klemens August von Aachen (1756-1808), a career soldier in the Prussian Army and, like herself, a writer. It is known that the marriage resulted in the births of (at least) four children From the time she married, Maria Johanna wrote poetry. However, she did not see herself as a career poet, and most of her published poems appeared pseudonymously, publication having been arranged by other people. Maria Johanna died three months short of what would have been her ninetieth birthday, and was comfortably predeceased not just, in 1808, by her husband, but also by both her sons and by one of her two recorded daughters. It is therefore unsurprising that her work is characterised by a certain spirit of melancholy. She became a strong backer of the newpaper producer and anthologist Friedrich Ra√ümann, and a member of the literary circle around Elisa von Ahlefeldt and Elise R√ºdiger. She features frequently in the published correspondence of Annette von Droste-H√ºlshoff, in whose one-act comedy \\"Perdu!\\" the character of Mrs von Austen is a supposed by some to be caricature of Maria Johanna von Aachen.

Airds was widely used at first but as individual local villages came into being, the broad name fell out of use and it wasn't reborn until 1975 when the NSW Housing Commission converted bush farms at \\"South Kentlyn\\" into a new housing estate called Airds (Macarthur Advertiser).  Plough Inn  The Plough Inn was constructed on of land purchased by William Ray (1772-1835), a convict transported for burglary. He arrived in Sydney on 13 October 1791 on the Albermarle, married Sarah M Harrigan (1793-) and had three children between 1809 and 1822.CoAssociates, 2015, 17 There are references in the Campbelltown & Airds Historical Society Journal volume 1 no. 3 to William Ray conducting the Plough Inn as early as 1821. Descendants of Ray have claimed that his daughter Maria was born in a sandstone cottage on the site in 1822.Sheedy, 1980 Ray built the inn between 1816‚Äì21 and sold it in February 1826 to Nathaniel Boon (1791-1839), a convict transported for burglary (arrived 29 September 1811 in Sydney), who was recorded in the November 1828 Census as living in Airds. William Ray died on 18 October 1835 aged 63 and was buried in St. Peter's Cemetery, Campbelltown.  Holly Lea  Boon arranged an 1829 mortgage of A¬£252 on the property which is believed to have been used to build the present two storey brick residence. Boon married Sarah Wade on 27 July 1831 and c.1830 had triplet sons. Boon built \\"Holly Lea\\" and that same time he was licensee of \\"The Three Brothers\\". Boon licensed the property in July 1832 as \\"The Three Brothers\\" and this license was renewed until at least 1835. Nathaniel Boon died on 15 February 1839. On 25 December 1845Sheedy, 1980 says 1846 William Ray Jr. (one of William & Sarah's two sons) leased the Plough Inn and Holly Lea from Boon's widow, Sarah. In 1857 William Ray Jr. was named in the Publicans' Index for \\"The Travellers\\" Home' (also leasing the inn off Sarah Harrigan (Boon). By 1869 he was declared insolvent. That year John Jenkins bought the site due to Hay's insolvency. Jenkins had married Sarah's daughter Maria Ray and acquired the property from William Ray Jr in 1869. By 1884 the site was called \\"Borobine House\\" and had a new owner, The Hon. John Davies CMG. Davies renamed it \\"Holly Lea\\" and continued to live there until he died in 1896. Sarah Boon died on 5 July 1887, aged 93. By the site was operating as a private boarding school. By it was again a private residence. In 1922 Arthur Payten was its owner and used the site as a farm and his widow continued to live there almost until 1957 when it was bought by Mervyn Whitten The buildings were derelict by then. After 1957 M. & K. Whitten, his wife and family made a great deal of repairs to renovate the property and make it habitable, painting, laying a concrete floor, installing hessian ceilings and rebuilding the chimneys. They continued to run the property as a dairy farm until the late 1960s when most of the land was resumed for industrial purposes by Campbelltown City Council. Since then Mr & Mrs Whitten have used the buildings and a small area of land about them as a private home. In recent years the buildings were listed by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) and the Heritage Council of NSW. The property was placed on the market for sale in .Sheedy, The immediately-previous owner Alwyn Hutchinson used the property for nominal storage purposes.CoAssociates, 2015, 3 That owner indicated that prior to purchasing the property in , it had been used for \\"casual retail\\" functions.CoAssociates, 2015, 6  Description  There are presently () six buildings on the site, of which three only have been considered by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) as being of some historic significance. The other three are a timber framed garage, a detached fernery and a corrugated iron farm shed, all built by Mr Whitten and not of apparent historic significance. The remaining three buildings are composed of: ;Plough Inn, The single storey inn of three rooms was built (Sheedy () says ) of sandstone walls nominally thick to the exterior in uncoursed rubble and coursed dressed material and one interior wall apparently built as the main accommodation building for the inn. Another interior wall is of sandstock bricks nominally thick.CoAssociates P/L, 2015, 3 Floors are cement-paved.Sheedy, , 2 It has two fireplaces and chimneys to the northern face. All wall faces are painted. The pitched roof is covered with corrugated iron sheets and matching roof covers. The roof is constructed of trimmed tree poles, covered in she-oak (Casuarina sp.) shingles, now sheeted in corrugated iron.Sheedy, c.1980 Gutters and downpipes are modern. Roof timber members appear to be original including wide and close centre battens, round section rafters and collar ties and some ceiling joists. The ceiling is of canvas on a timber frame and both this and the walls have been lime-washed. When purchased by Mr Whitten the north-west corner had partly collapsed as had one of the chimneys and these were rebuilt. The building is used as a store room, workshop and family entertaining areas. It is in excellent condition () although there is some evidence of sandstone fretting to the south wall probably caused by rising damp. The ground outside this area appears to have been built up and paved with pre-cast concrete pavers.Sheedy, , 3 ;Holly Lea, Two storey sandstock brick residenceCoAssociates P/L, 2015 apparently built as the main accommodation building for the inn. Verandah and balcony face the main road with a skillion roofed area at the rear. Two storey part is of four rooms with central hall and staircase while rear skillion-roofed part comprises five rooms containing kitchen, dining room, bathroom, sun room and toilet. This arrangement was made by Mr Whitten after enclosing a verandah and incorporating it into a dwelling space. The first floor is used for bedrooms. A 1914 phogograph shows the building basically as it is with cast iron balcony posts, valancing and balustradeds and stuccoed walls. It is assumed that during the ownership of John Davies this building was given its late Victorian appearance. There is a hip roof of she-oak shingles under corrugated iron. The floors are timber, presently covered with body carpet and concrete floors at the rear are tiled. Because of its derelict state when purchased, Mr Whitten rebuilt the ground floors, replaced the lath-and plaster ceilings with fibrous plaster, remade the ground floor doors and part of the staircase to the original pattern and rebuilt the verandah and balcony. While the cast iron columns are original the decorative ironwork has been replaced by cast aluminium of similar pattern. The verandah is now cement-paved and external walls have been given a rough- cast rendered finish.Sheedy, , 3-4 Internally the plaster walls show some evidence of dampness but otherwise the condition of the building appears to be very good. The front door is six-panelled with a rectangular fanlight over, internal doors are four-panelled, windows are two panes of double hung sash pattern and there are paired French windows opening onto the balcony. The building has been used as a self-contained dwelling for approximately 26 years.Sheedy, , 4 ;Farm Shed (pre-1880) This small, sandstock brick building has a she-oak (shingle) hip roof sheeted with corrugated iron and a single, vertically-boarded timber door. IT has a floor partly of brick and is without a ceiling and appears to be only in fair condition. Its date is uncertain but taking into consideration its materials, it would appear to have been built prior to 1880. Records and photographs have indicated that a ball room was built between the inn and the main road and there were a number of timber outbuildings at the rear but these have all now disappeared.  Modifications and dates  *: major changes of a concrete floor infill to each room, installation of plywood and painted hessian ceilings was made. The roof of the inn was corrugated iron by this time. *A photograph shows unpainted external walls (there may be remains of paint on joints between stones or lime mortar repointing.CoAssociates P/L, 2015, 19 * - painting of exterior walls occurred as part of the site's development . At that time the area immediately around the inn had major landscaping changes. The current arrangement of each building being treated as a separate \\"unit\\" under the strata title for the overall property started c.1980.

After 1730 he also worked as a municipal architect. Biography  Family provenance and early years  Joseph Abeille was born in Vannes, a coastal town protected by its position at the head of the Gulf of Morbihan on the southern side of Brittany. For at least two thousand years the proximity of the Atlantic Ocean had closely impacted economic and political developments in the town. Blaise Abeille (or Abeill√©), his father was a businessman from Marseille, where he entered into his first marriage which produced at least one child. Joseph Abeille was the second son from Blaise Abeille's second marriage which took place in Paris in 1762. At the time of her marriage to Blaise Abeille, Joseph's mother, born Ren√©e Jameron, was already a (young) widow, whose first husband, Jacques Pavin, had been a minor aristocrat and a tax collector. The family's move to Brittany may was probably in connection with Blaise Abeille having obtained a government job, since at the time of his sons' births he was employed as a \\"receveur g√©n√©ral des imp√¥ts et Billots\\" (tax collector) in the Bishopric of Vannes. Joseph's older brother was Olivier Abeille, born on 11 June 1672 and baptised less than a week later.  Military engineer  Joseph Abeille came to the attention of the Paris-based scientific establishment in 1699 when he applied successfully to the Acad√©mie royale des sciences to patent his radical design for flat vaulted roofing. He began his career as a French king's engineer. The position was a military one, in which he was employed from 1703 During this period France was engaged in an ambitious war which involved attempting to invade the Netherlands, much of which lay at or below sea-level. When the situation became desperate the Dutch military commander could - and on at least one occasion did - cut the dykes protecting a contested section of drained land, thereby displacing or drowning any French military personnel on it. An understanding of hydraulic engineering acquired a military importance un matched before or since in French history. It was between 1703 and 1706 that Abeille acquired his reputation as an hydraulic engineer. In 1706 appreciation dawned on the French king that even the military might of France could not prevail on all fronts at once: attempts to invade the Netherlands were abandoned. Around one hundred military engineers were \\"retired\\" from the army in 1706. One of them was Joseph Abeille. Meanwhile in 1704 Abeille had also distinguished himself and enhanced his reputation at the naval Battle of Malaga, serving in the fleet under the command of the Count of Toulouse.  Geneva  Abeille undertook two lengthy stays in Switzerland, during which he worked in Geneva, Bern,Morges and Solothurn. His first significant Swiss project involved producing plans for what became Thunstetten Castle, which would become a prestigious new home of the Bernese Schulthei√ü, Hieronymus von Erlach. The plans are dated 1707 and the impressive castle - in reality a manor house complex in the then fashionable style (according to some who presumably had never been there) of the new Palace at Versailles, just outside Paris - was constructed between 1711 and 1713. Another early commission was the Maison de Saussure, a palatial town house constructed in Geneva between 1707 and 1712 for a businessman called Jean-Antoine Lullin. Between 1708 and 1711 he also worked for the city authorities in Geneva on the hydrological challenges presented by the city's location at the point on the lake at which its waters discharge (at variable rates according, approximately, to the time of year) into the River Rh√¥ne. Between 1708 and 1711 he designed and supervised the construction of what contemporaries called a \\"lifting machine\\" (\\"machine √©l√©vatoire\\"), which used the pressure from the flow of the water to force water up to the prosperous residences in the higher parts of the city, thereby creating piped water supplies at several different levels significantly more elevated than the lake-shore. The \\"Obelisk Fountain\\" in what is today known as the Place du Molard is a surviving element of the scheme. In 1715 he produced a proposal for major redevelopments at the Island Hospital (\\"Inselspital\\") in Bern but his plans, at this stage, were not implemented.  Bazacle Milling Company  By 1714 he was back in France, implementing technical solutions to reactivate a water mill of the Bazacle Company in Toulouse. The dam which was a component of the water mill had been broken by winter ice during 1709, and despite several years of attempting to repair it and the expenditure of an hundred thousand pounds, five years later the mill was still out of action; and it had become impossible to find anyone in the Toulouse area prepared to invest further in it. Abeille arrived from Geneva and agreed to finance the work in return for a 50% shareholding in the company along with the chairmanship of the company for as long as he should retain at least 30 of the company's 128 shares. These financial arrangements, unusual at the time, can be seen as a significant indication of the progression towards \\"modern\\" capitalism that was under way in France at the time. The broken dam defied even the ingenuity of Joseph Abeille, and in the end he built a larger completely new dam a short distance downstream. The work was not without difficulties, but in 1720 the mill was able to resume operation after slightly more than 12 years of inactivity. By that time Abeille had sold half his shares \\"to Geneva investors\\", and had found himself facing a legal challenge from co-investors who believed he had failed to honour all his early commitments. He nevertheless retained more than 30 shares at this point. However, during 1732 he disposed of all his remaining shares, over a three months period, to a number of different investors, ending his association with the Bazacle Milling Company, which thereby returned to its former, more conventional, governance structure. Three hundred years after its completion the dam that Joseph Abeille constructed across the Garonne continues to serve Toulouse, but in 1888 the mill wheel was replaced by a small electricity generating facility: this was taken over by EDF in 1946, and in 2020 remains in production.  Montpellier  In 1717 Abeille was working in Montpellier where he was involved with planning and supervising the Place du Peyrou, a prestigious urban redevelopment programme which featured a city water supply with an aqueduct, along with an equestrian statue celebrating the (by this time recently deceased) king. He also spent some time working on the port installations at S√®te.  Burgundy: plans for a canal  1924 found him in Dijon, where he teamed up with Jacques Gabriel to draw up plans for the construction of a stone bridge over the Sa√¥ne, the \\"Pont de Seurre\\" (which unfortunately collapsed in 1731). At around the same time, Abeille was approached by the Estates of Burgundy who asked him to advise on the best route for a canal connecting the Sa√¥ne and the Seine. In June 1924 he went to Pouilly-en-Auxois which would be the starting point for the Canal de Bourgogne (although it would be another half century before construction work would actually start, long after Abeille's death). In November 1924 the Estates of Burgundy commissioned him to organise the levelling necessary for the construction of the canal and produce a cost estimate for the work. Although it remains uncertain how far the project progressed at this stage, the report which Abeille prepared jointly with Jacques Gabriel, and which they presented to the Estates in 1727, was retained and has survived. In 1729, permission having been obtained to progress the project based on Abeille's plans, construction seemed likely to go ahead. However, the man given the necessary letters patent was Pierre-Fran√ßois Merchand d'Espinassy, who had actually favoured an alternative plan. There was a general falling out soon after which Pierre-Fran√ßois Merchand d'Espinassy. The authorities had been appalled by the cost estimate, and the project progressed no further at this stage. In 1763 the project was relaunched by a new generation of politicians, however, who prepared to construct the Canal de Bourgogne, using the existing plans which were now more than thirty years old. Joseph Abeille was by now dead, and his son-on-law, the soldier-intellectual Louis-F√©lix Guinement de K√©ralio, found it necessary to launch a court case in order to ensure that Abeille's \\"paternity role\\" in respect of the canal was acknowledged. A decree issued by the king's Council of State dated 20 July 1764 confirms that the plaintiff received satisfaction on all counts, on behalf of his wife's late father. This amounted to a confirmation that the king required that Abeille's plans were the ones to be implemented in preference to any others that might be put forward.  Britanny  In 1730 Joseph Abeille was back in Britanny where he researched the construction of a canal from the regional capital, Rennes, to the northern coast at Dinan and Saint-Malo. The route proposed involved making extensive use of the River Ille, much of which would need to be channelled in order to make it navigable. It was presumably primarily for financial reasons that this turned out to be no more than one in a series of abandoned projects. When the canal was built during the first part of the nineteenth century it did indeed follow the route proposed in Abeille's 1730 study (though the topography of the region makes it hard to see how any other route could reasonably have been contemplated). On 23 May 1730 his former partner, Jacques Gabriel, appointed Joseph Abeille to fill a vacancy that had just arisen (following a disagreement involving Pierre Le Mousseux, the previous incumbent) for a chief architect to implement the reconstruction programme which was under way in Rennes following the fire which had destroyed the city centre between 23 December and 29 December in 1720. (Gabriel, who was well networked at court. had been appointed to take charge of the reconstruction by the king some years earlier.)  Bern  In 1732 Abeille accepted an invitation which involved returning to Switzerland. This time the invitation came from Bern where he was contracted to produce plans for a new Public Hospital (\\"Burgerspital\\" / H√¥pital des bourgeois). This time his plans were implemented, the large hospital being constructed between 1734 and 1742: nearly three hundred years later in full splendour, notwithstanding a recent renovation and conversion exercise. On this occasion he spent a further three years in Switzerland, undertaking commissions not just in Bern, but also in Morges, where he implemented major improvements to the port, and Solothurn, where his plans for a new bridge over the Aare, failed to progress, but hospital and church buildings that he designed were constructed almost immediately, and had been largely completed by the time he went back to the west of France in 1735.  Nantes  In 1738 Abeille, at this time chief engineer for the south of Brttany, produced a study on ways to improve the navigability of the Loire in Nantes. On 29 September of that year he submitted a project on the Fish Market Bridge (\\"Pont de la Poissonni√®re\\") in Nantes. In 1740 he was engaged on a programme of extensive repairs to the still new Nantes stock exchange building, which was evidently much too heavy for the soft ground on which it had been positioned. Although the reconstruction of Rennes would continue for many more years, by 1742 Joseph Abeille was no longer the chief architect overseeing it. Instead he served between 1742 and 1751 as city architect for Nantes. Here the developments for which he took charge included the reconstruction in 1743 of the Brancas river dock. In 1744 he contributred his export opinion cpncerning the Pirmil Bridge over the souuthern branch of the Loire, possibly hoping to be given the job of reconstructing it, but that seems not to have happened. The city authorities were evodently becoming increasingly reliuctant to spend money on infrastructure development. Nevertheless, in 1749 he accepted a job that involved re constructing some of the wharfs of the Brancas river dock and redesigning the foundations and structure for the adjacent market hall propsed by the city architect. In 1751 Abeille was expressing dissatisfaction that he was required to work for a series of job specific fees rather than receiving a fixed salary for his work. He also complained at the small number of building workers assigned to the project by the contractors selected by the city authorities. Relations became progressively more strained, and later during 1751 Joseph Abeille withdrew from the Brancas project. The city authorities passed the job his son, Jean Saturnin Abeille-Fontaine, who was given a fixed annual salary and completed the work, based on the plans his father had submitted in 1750. Relations between Joseph Abeille and the city fathers now improved a little, but he was now nearly eighty years old, and there were no more significant projects. By the time Joseph Abeille died, in 1756, he had evidently moved back to Rennes.  Personal  Joseph Abeille's first marriage, possibly to Magdeleine Le Roy, was followed by the births of two children. His second marriage was formalised on 6 April 1717 in Toulouse. His bride, more than twenty years younger than he, was Madeleine de Labat: the marriage produced at least four and possibly as many as seven children between 1719 and 1727, including Fran√ßoise Abeille de Keralio.

The most important event was the Battle of Ochomogo (5 April 1823) which was fought on Ochomogo Hill, from which it takes it name, to the west of Cartago, Costa Rica. Republican militia from San Jos√© and Alajuela led by Gregorio Jos√© Ram√≠rez defeated conservative forces from Cartago, the colonial capital, who supported making Costa Rica part of the new Mexican Empire. The Republicans won the battle and San Jos√© became capital of the country, which remained independent within the Federal Republic of Central America. Background Cartago was the first Spanish settlement in Costa Rica, founded in 1563 by Juan V√°zquez de Coronado. It was the original capital of the country. In 1784 the Spanish government gave San Jos√© a tobacco factory and a monopoly over tobacco products. After this, San Jos√© became the commercial center of Costa Rica while Cartago retained the political power. By 1801 Costa Rica had a population of about 50,000, most of whom lived in the Central Valley. Costa Rica was isolated from the outside world, and it took a month for news to arrive of the Act of Independence of Central America proclaimed on the 15 September 1821 in Guatemala. In May 1822 Agust√≠n de Iturbide proclaimed himself Emperor of Mexico, with plans to extend his rule to all of Central America. The agrarian and aristocratic landowners of Cartago and Heredia wanted to maintain the privileges they had held under the former Spanish empire. They thought these would be protected under the new Mexican Empire. The liberal merchants of San Jos√© and Alajuela wanted to introduce a republican government. They preferred to remain independent of the empire. The leaders of the four towns of the Central Valley met and agreed to remain neutral until the situation became clearer. Gregorio Jos√© Ram√≠rez, who had represented the province of Alajuela in the council that decided on the independence of Costa Rica, was hostile to joining the empire. He began to make military preparations. By March 1823 the Superior Governing Council of Costa Rica had still not declared allegiance to the emperor, and the conservatives decided to stage a coup. Preamble Gregorio Jos√© Ram√≠rez, the republican leader Rafael Francisco Osejo, who had always favored the independence of Costa Rica, was made president of the triumvirate government formed in Cartago in March. This was overthrown by the imperialists after eight days. On 29 March 1823 a group of Cartago residents led by Joaqu√≠n de Oreamuno y Mu√±oz de la Trinidad occupied the army barracks and proclaimed that Costa Rica would join the Mexican Empire. Oreamuno said the formal ceremony of allegiance to the empire would take effect on 6 April. The leaders of San Jos√© and Alajuela declared war on the imperialists and appointed Ram√≠rez to lead their army The Republican forces included regular troops and irregulars from San Jos√© and Alajuela. The Imperialists had regular troops from Cartago, irregulars from Cartago and Heredia, and Nicaraguans loyal to the emperor. They had artillery they had inherited from Spain, and some cavalry. Battle of Ochomogo Ram√≠rez sent an ultimatum to the Imperialists on 4 April 1823. The two armies met in the morning of the 5 April at Ochomogo. The Ochomogo Pass is a valley near Cartago that leads through the mountains between San Jos√© and Cartago, connecting the Pacific and Atlantic watersheds of the Central Valley. The militia of Cartago under Sergeant Major Salvador Oreamuno took a stand in the plain. Joaqu√≠n de Oreamuno y Mu√±oz de la Trinidad remained at home in Cartago for the first few hours. The Republicans were under overall command of Ram√≠rez, and the future head of state Ant√≥nio Pinto Soares commanded their artillery. There was an attempt to negotiate, but that quickly broke down and both sides began firing their muskets from the cover of the large volcanic rocks that litter the area. The combat was prolonged, and the Cartago forces made several musket and infantry charges, but the artillery of Pinto Soares checked them and some of the Cartago officers began to defect, including their commander Salvador Oreamuno. Sergeant F√©lix Oreamuno y Jim√©nez took command and asked for a ceasefire, but Ram√≠rez y Castro insisted on unconditional surrender and continued to fight until the forces of Cartago were completely defeated. He then entered Cartago and disarmed the inhabitants. About twenty people died in the one-day battle. Aftermath While the Ochomogo battle was in progress there was a separate struggle in which the militia of Heredia forced Alajuela to capitulate. Ram√≠rez led his forces from Ochomogo to liberate Alajuela and restore order in the Central Valley. For ten days Ram√≠rez was de facto ruler of the country while he restored order. He published only two decrees, one to make San Jos√© the capital and the other to convene a democratically elected governing council. After several weeks news arrived that the First Mexican Empire had ceased to exist on 19 March 1823, so the Battle of Ochomogo had been pointless. In 1825 Juan Mora Fern√°ndez was elected the first Costa Rican head of state. Rivalry between the four towns continued, and an 1834 law said the capital was to rotate among them. A year later after the Guerra de la Liga the position of San Jose was confirmed, and this was made official in 1837 by head of state Braulio Carrillo Colina.

It was originally known as the White Lion, before being renamed as the Grand Hotel in 1874. It was constructed of limestone ashlar, in a rectangular Italianate Renaissance style. An attic storey was added during the 20th century. The interior was also extensively altered during this time. In World War II, the hotel was used as a residence for various agents, politicians and royalty and served as a link between London and Bristol Airport. It was Grade II listed in 1966. The hotel was renovated in 2017 in a ¬£5 million refurbishment program, and is now known as the Mercure Bristol Grand Hotel. It has 155 rooms, and is extensively decorated with art by local Bristol artists. In 2013, the Russian emigre Nikolai Glushkov became ill there, in a suspected poisoning incident. Cultural references Several celebrities have stayed at the hotel, including The Beatles, Cary Grant and Leslie Howard. In 1964, the Rolling Stones were refused entry into the hotel's bar, because they were not wearing jackets. The hotel was featured in the BBC production of The Trial of Christine Keeler in 2019. During filming, it was briefly closed.

His family owned the Ambassador Hotel in Rio de Janeiro, where Juca's Bar, a meeting place for intellectuals and politicians in the 1960s, operated. Marcito, as he was known, began his career in journalism at the age of seventeen as a reporter for the newspaper Correio da Manh√£ and was awarded the Esso Journalism Award for his work on the political crisis in Alagoas in 1957. Between 1958 and 1963, he attended the Law School of the University of the State of Guanabara (current UERJ). He was an advisor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs between 1961 and 1962, San Tiago Dantas.https://cpdoc.fgv.br/producao/dossies/Jango/biografias/marcio_moreira_alves  Political activism  A member of the opposition to the government of President Jo√£o Goulart, Marcito first supported the 1964 military coup d'√©tat. However, he began to oppose the military regime enforced by the coup after the publication of the Institutional Act Number One (AI-1) and began to lead a strong campaign denouncing the practice of torture against political prisoners in Brazil.Jos√© Maria Mayrink, Morda√ßa no Estad√£o, O Estado de S. Paulo, 2008, p√°g. 24 In 1965 Marcito participated in a demonstration promoted by intellectuals and students in Rio de Janeiro in front of Hotel Gl√≥ria, where the Council of the Organization of American States met; Marshal Humberto Castelo Branco, Brazilian military dictator, was at the meeting. There was a demonstration and the DOPS, the political repression unit, arrested several personalities. M√°rcio Moreira Alves had not been arrested, but soon ran after the police car and demanded to follow with his fellow protestors. In October 1967, he participated in the parliamentary commission that visited political prisoners in Juiz de Fora and found eleven victims of torture carried out by military personnel operating inside Brazilian Army barracks. It was the third year of Moreira Alves' fight against torture, denouncing General Ernesto Geisel as \\"in league with a bunch of sadists\\" Marcito was remembered as the motivator of the Institutional Act Number 5 (AI-5),Jos√© Maria Mayrink, Morda√ßa no Estad√£o, O Estado de S. Paulo, 2008, p√°g. 36 when he, as a deputy, delivered a speech at the National Congress in early September 1968 calling for a boycott of the celebrations of Brazil's Independence Day and asked Brazilian girls not to date Army officers.Maria Fernanda Lopes Almeida, Veja sob Censura, Jaboticaba, S√£o Paulo, 2008, p√°g. 86 Due to the perceived radical tone of his speech, the Minister of Justice, at the time, sent to the Chamber of Deputies a request for authorization for Mr. M√°rcio Moreira Alves to be sued. This was too much even for the pro-military National Renewal Alliance (ARENA), which dominated the legislature; it refused to grant the authorization. The government's reprisal was strong and on December 13, 1968, Institutional Act Number Five was issued, considered the hardest institutional act edited during the Brazilian military dictatorship It gave the president the power to close Congress, rule by decree and suspend citizens' rights. M√°rcio was immediately expelled from Congress under provisions of the AI-5 and left the country clandestinely in December 1968, exiling in Chile, where he stayed until 1971. In 1971, he went to Paris, where he obtained a doctorate from the National Foundation for Political Sciences. In 1974, he moved to Lisbon, where he stayed until 1979. With the arrival of the Amnesty Law, which pardoned all political crimes and allowed the return of political exiles, in 1979 M√°rcio returned to Brazil and began to collaborate until 1986 with the newspaper Tribuna da Imprensa.  After the exile  With the end of the bipartisan system and subsequent party reformulations, he joined the PMDB, successor to the former MDB, and ran for a seat of federal deputy for Rio de Janeiro in November 1982, leaving as a substitute. Between 1982 and 1986, he advised Lu√≠s Carlos Bresser Pereira during the period in which Bresser was president of the State Bank of S√£o Paulo and secretary of the government of S√£o Paulo. In 1987, he was undersecretary of international relations for the state of Rio de Janeiro, under the government of Wellington Moreira Franco. He left public life in 1990 when he left the PMDB and started to focus on journalism. He was a commentator for TV Manchete and columnist for the newspaper O Globo until 2008, when he retired from health care after suffering a stroke in October 2008.  Death  M√°rcio Moreira Alves died on April 3, 2009, at the age of 72, after five months in which he was hospitalized at Hospital Samaritano in Rio de Janeiro, victim of multiple organ failure and renal and respiratory failure.

She went on to complete her B.A. degree summa cum laude in Biology at Radcliffe College in 1975. She joined the Scripps Institution of Oceanography for her graduate studies, earning a PhD in Oceanography from the University of California, San Diego in 1982. Her PhD advisor was Paul K. Dayton. Her dissertation was on tidal flat ecology and deep-sea sediments. Her postdoctoral advisors were Rudolph Scheltema and Hal Caswell at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  Research  She joined North Carolina State University as an assistant professor in 1983. Levin then moved to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1992 as an associate professor. In the mid-1990s she became interested in deep-sea environments, including methane seeps and oxygen minimum zones. These are the regions of ocean that were deprived of oxygen ‚Äì between 200 and 1,000 metres deep with less than 90% of the surface oxygen. Her work also considers the structure of vulnerable ecosystems, wetland biotic interactions and larval ecology of coastal marine populations. She has worked extensively in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans using a range of deep-sea equipment including submersibles, remotely operated underwater vehicles. She has participated in over 40 oceanographic expeditions. She monitored cold seep sediments, checking the interaction of fauna with flow and reporting the first review of the different size groups of organisms. Together with her students, Levin has worked with a broad range of taxa, from microbes and microalgae to invertebrates, fishes and whales. Her recent research has emphasized 3 major themes: * the structure, function and vulnerability of continental margin ecosystems, particularly those subject to oxygen and sulphide stress, ocean acidification and ocean deoxygenation * wetland biotic interactions as they mediate marsh function, invasion and restoration * larval ecology of coastal marine populations with emphasis on connectivity. She served on the San Diego Wetlands Advisory Board. She was an editor of the journal Marine Ecology and founding editorial board member of the Annual Review of Marine Science.

It was designed by John Verge and built from 1820 to 1829. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Glenda Chalker (a Cubbitch Barta clan traditional owner) records corroborees, including local Aboriginal Australian and visiting groups, occurring at the Denham Court estate into the 1850s.Godden Mackay Logan, 2012, 20 When the first fleet arrived in Sydney Cove in 1788 they found the soil unsuitable for farming and soon looked towards the heavy clay and loam soils of the Cumberland Plain (to the west) to sustain the colony. Early agricultural settlements were located on the rich alluvial soils of the Nepean, Hawkesbury and Georges River areas, as well as South Creek near St.Marys and at the head of the Parramatta River where the settlement of Rose Hill (later Parramatta) was established about six months after the fleet landed. A settlement at the Hawkesbury was established in 1794. By 1804 much of the Cumberland Plain had been settled and Governor King began to look for other regions in the colony for favourable arable land. The only suitable land within the Cumberland Plain was the area known as the Cowpastures, located in the southwestern corner. This area was named after the discovery in 1795 of cows from the first fleet which had wandered off into the bush. The Cowpastures had remained unoccupied due to the official decree that reserved the land for the wild cattle (to encourage their increase). In December 1803 Governor King and Mrs King visited the Cowpastures for themselves and the Sydney Gazette reported that Mrs King was the first \\"white lady\\" to have crossed the Nepean River. The track to the Cowpastures led from Prospect and on 17 September 1805 James Meehan, under instructions from Governor King, commenced a survey of the track from Prospect to the Nepean Crossing and a rough road followed the marked line. This became known as Cowpasture Road, later the Hume Highway, most of which is today part of the Camden Valley Way. Several visits to the area by the colonial gentry took place at this time, which resulted in their desire to acquire some of this rich land for themselves. They saw the area as containing very good grazing land. Captain Henry Waterhouse described the area in a letter to John Macarthur in 1804 as follows: \\" I am at a loss to describe the face of the country other than as a beautiful park, totally divested of underwood, interspersed with plains, with rich luxuriant grass\\". Earlier Europeans had described \\"large ponds covered with ducks and the black swan, the margins of which were fringed with shrubs of the most delightful tints\\". The Europeans thought the flats were perfect for cattle and the hills would carry sheep. They admired the absence of underbush - probably achieved through Aboriginal burning off - and felt comfortable with a landscape that reminded them of an English gentleman's park. John Macarthur received the first land grant in the Cowpastures region in 1805 for his role in the early wool industry in the colony. Lord Camden rewarded him with and Macarthur chose the highly coveted Cowpastures for his grant, though Governor King tried to prevent him taking it. Macarthur also organised a grant for his friend Walter Davidson, who allowed Macarthur to use his land freely after Davidson returned to England. In this manner Macarthur controlled of riverbank on the site where the wild cattle had first discovered the best pasture near Sydney. Later purchases and exchanges increased the Macarthur land there to over , an endowment that Governor Macquarie greatly resented. Other early grants were in the Parishes of Minto and in adjoining Evan, Bringelly, Narellan and Cook. These all lay west of Parramatta.Godden Mackay Logan, 2012, 20-21 Governor Macquarie drew up plans in 1820 for establishment of a town in the area, to be named Campbelltown after his wife Elizabeth's maiden name. With their forced return to England in 1822 these plans never came to fruition and it was not until the arrival of Governor Darling in 1827 that plans were again reinstated and the first settlers were allowed to take possession of their town land in 1831. In the early 1850s the railway line from Sydney to Goulburn was completed, with a station opening at Campbelltown in 1858. When Leppington House was offered for lease in 1865, one of its selling points was that it was near a railway. Campbelltown now provided easy access to Sydney and its markets and grew as the centre of the district. Although Camden was established in 1836, with no railway line it remained a small town. The large estates that flanked Cowpasture Road (later Camden Valley Way) and the Northern Road were run largely as sheep and cattle farms, with wheat and other grain crops being grown as well until the 1850s. The houses were often built on surrounding ridges or hills, providing sweeping views of the countryside and ensuring that any passing traveller could appreciate the owner's status by viewing their impressive country mansions from the road. This land use pattern of large farm estates and small towns, established in the nineteenth century, remained largely the pattern of development of the area up until the late 1990s. Aerial photographs of the area in 1947 show a rural landscape with some limited urban development on either side of (then) Camden Valley Way.Godden Mackay Logan, 2012, 22-23 Denham Court Denham Court is situated on a grant of originally made by Governor Macquarie to Judge-Advocate Richard Atkins, a participant in the Bligh Rebellion. Richard (Bowyer) Atkins (1745-1820), Deputy Judge Advocate, was born on 22 March 1745, the fifth son of Sir William Bowyer, baronet, and his wife Anne, n√©e Stonhouse. He assumed the surname Atkins in recognition of a legacy from Sir Richard Atkins, of Clapham, Surrey, England. On 3 February 1773 he married Elizabeth, n√©e Brady, of Dublin. He procured a military commission and by the 1780s became adjutant to the Isle of Man Corps. Addicted to liquor, immorality and insolvency he led a thoroughly dissolute life. Principally to evade creditors he resigned his commission and sailed for Sydney in the \\"Pitt\\", arriving in 1791. He made much of the fame of his brothers, Sir William Bowyer, Lieutenant-General Henry Bowyer and Admiral Sir George Bowyer and of being a close friend of Samuel Thornton, judge-advocate of London, and the governors were impressed. Atkins was Judge Advocate from 1796-1796 and 1800-.NSW State Records, Colonial Secretary Index Phillip made him a magistrate at Parramatta and in March 1792 appointed him registrar of the Vice-Admiralty Court; this enabled him to enhance the aura of influential prestige behind which he sheltered from existing creditors while engaging fresh credit locally on the security of his family name. It was soon commonplace knowledge that his bills were not met: Rev. Samuel Marsden considered them so doubtful that they might never be honoured. Atkins served as registrar of exports and imports, assistant inspector of public works at Parramatta and temporary superintendent of police, all to the governor's \\"most perfect satisfaction\\", and when Macarthur resigned as inspector of public works in 1796 Atkins took his place. In 1798 Richard Dore arrived to take up a commission as judge-advocate but, when he died in 1800, Atkins was reappointed. Governor King recommended he take the office permanently despite his inebriate habits, for no other person in the colony was \\"at all equal to that office\\" and the salary, then about (Pounds)350 with the benefit of several assigned servants and land grants, was insufficient inducement. Atkins remained the colony's principal legal officer for years. Of commanding stature and fine presence, when sober he was impressive enough to delude creditors and governors alike; but he was ignorant and merciless, an inveterate debauchee. Lieutenant-Governor William Paterson remarked on \\"his character for low debauchery and every degrading vice as well as a total want of every gentlemanly principle\\". Governor William Bligh deemed him \\"a disgrace to human jurisprudence\\", who 'has been the ridicule of the community. Bligh found it necessary to take legal advice from George Crossley an ex-convict attorney, whom Atkins himself employed as counsellor for many years. Records of cases before Atkins while judge-advocate reinforce contemporary criticisms of his irresolution and unfamiliarity with law...The most prominent of his adventures on the bench was the trial of John Macarthur in 1808, an incident having an immediate part in the deposition of Bligh. Bligh precipitated the end of his government in adopting Atkins's recommendation that members be charged with treasonable practices. Major Johnston forthwith hastened to Sydney where, urged on by a petition which Macarthur sponsored, he arrested Bligh and took command. Atkins was immediately suspended, but soon made his peace with the rebels, though it was \\"from necessity alone\\" that in December 1808 Lieutenant- Governor Joseph Foveaux reinstated him. This travesty was not long lasting. Atkins's relatives besought the secretary of state to find some permanent position in the colony which would disburden them of their black sheep, but he could be tolerated in public office no longer. Castlereagh ordered his recall, censuring his \\"want of professional education and practice\\" which had caused \\"great inconveniences\\". This was a mild appraisal of the decrepit old man whom Macquarie thought unlikely to survive his passage. However, he reached England safely and went into retirement. For a time he could not be found to give evidence at Johnston's court martial but he ultimately gave his testimony in a fawning fashion demonstrating his wavering loyalties and feeble character. His attorney in 1817 offered a composition to his creditors in New South Wales, but Atkins remained insolvent until his death in London in 1820.Bennett, J.M., Australian Dictionary of Biography online entry for Atkins, Richard, accessed 23/1/9 Atkins was recalled in 1810 and in 1812 the property was bought by Captain Richard Brooks. Brooks acquired adjoining grants of 50 acres and three grants of 200 acres and settled on the land in the mid 1820s although Liston states that there was a small cottage at Denham Court by 1821.Morris & Britton, 2000, 124 The original house at Denham Court was single storied but in 1832-33 Captain Brooks enlarged it by adding a two-storey (central) wing and two flanking low-fronted one storey wings. This house was designed by architect John Verge as a single-storey small replica of \\"Denham Court\\" in Middlesex, England which was erected in 1670.Robinsons, 1962 Richard Brooks (1765?-1833), mariner, merchant and settler, was born at Topsham, Devon, England, son of an impoverished clergyman. He entered the East India Co.'s service at an early age and rose to command his own ship. During the first French revolutionary war he traded to Oporto, the Mediterranean and the Baltic, but later returned to the East India service. He began his association with New South Wales in 1802 when he captained the convict transport \\"Atlas\\". After this voyage he earned the censure of Governor Philip Gidley King for the high death rate among the convicts in his charge, largely due to negligence and to overcrowding on board caused by his large personal cargo. The surgeon, Thomas Jamison, brought a civil action for assault against Brooks and the transport commissioners threatened him with prosecution, but he escaped punishment. In 1806 he was captain of another transport, the 'Alexander'; thereafter he made a number of trading trips to the colony, in the \\"Rose\\" in 1808, the \\"Simon Cock\\" in 1810 and the \\"Argo\\" in 1811, and built up large interests in the colony. As a partner of Robert Campbell, who was part-owner of the \\"Rose\\", he was opposed to the rebel government after the deposition of Governor Bligh and refused to give a passage to Captain Symons R.N., the bearer of Joseph Foveaux's dispatches to England. Foveaux then ordered the \\"Rose\\" be seized for trading in violation of the East India Co.'s monopoly, but this was a subterfuge and he allowed her to proceed when Brooks agreed to take Symons on board. He entered into a bond for ¬£4000 to account for any irregularity in their trading, but as Brooks was easily able to show that he had been duly licensed by the company, it is perhaps not surprising that he was heard using \\"some highly disrespectful expressions towards the present government of the colony\\". Brooks also carried letters on behalf of Bligh and, after the Rose sailed, he had Symons confined as a deserter, and the rebel supporter, John Blaxland, who was also on board, arrested at the Cape of Good Hope. In February 1813 Brooks was on his way to England in the \\"Isabella\\" when she was wrecked near the Falkland Islands, and he sailed to Buenos Aires in a long-boat for help. In July he asked for permission to go to New South Wales as a free settler; he said he had already established a large herd of cattle there, and could increase it if he were granted land. Allowed to go, he arrived in March 1814 with his wife Christiana, n√©e Passmore, daughter of another East India Co. captain, and children in the \\"Spring\\". He exchanged his brig for a house at the corner of Pitt and Hunter Streets, and set up business with her cargo. Governor Macquarie granted him land at Cockle Bay (Darling Harbour) in compensation for a grant promised at Farm Cove which had been incorporated in the government Domain, and he began a profitable business supplying meat and provisions to ships, to the public and to the government store. He was also an agent for Lloyd's of London and for shipping which called at Port Jackson. He suffered during the depression which followed, but this was only a temporary setback. Although in 1816 Governor Macquarie upheld Commissary David Allan in his charge that Brooks was among the most prominent of those settlers who withheld stock during the drought and thus profited by the rise in prices, in January 1817 he granted him in the Illawarra district, and in August appointed him a justice of the peace. Meanwhile, he had strongly supported the establishment of the Bank of New South Wales and in January 1819 he was on the committee of landowners and merchants who petitioned the British government for the repeal of commercial restrictions. In 1823 he moved from Sydney to Denham Court near Liverpool, which he had acquired from Richard Atkins more than ten years before in settlement of debts.Parsons, Vivienne, ADB online entry for Brooks, Richard, accessed 23/1/9 At first they lived in Sydney, but by 1825 they had moved to Denham Court. The hillside estate was one of Sydney's most vibrant social centres of the 1820s and 1830s. Brooks and Christiana had six beautiful daughters and worked to make Denham Court a name to be noticed. WIthin years the famed colonial architect John Verge had added elaborate wings and a new central section to the house. The dances, laughter and social functions that dominated life at this grand homestead can only be imagined. Ruth Banfield says Captain Brooks' \\"grand vision\\" of being the English squire was such that he ordered a private chapel to be built on the estate. Church Road now leads to this St.Mary the Virgin church, supposedly based on a similar structure at Denham in England.McGill, Fowler & Richardson, 1995, per CCC After planning the main front of Denham Court, architect John Verge also designed the small Chapel of St Mary the Virgin built in 1833 slightly to the west of the house on the other side of the highway (now on Church Road). For the rest of his life he lived there, a prominent settler, a member of the NSW Agricultural Society, a vice-president of the Benevolent Society, member of the committee of the Bible Society, and a strong supporter of religious charities of all denominations. He owned properties in Sydney at Cockle Bay and Surry Hills and had extensive holdings in the Illawarra, Williams River and Lake George districts. He died on 16 October 1833, after being gored by a bull; with his wife, who died on 12 April 1835, he was buried in a vault at Denham Court and the church of St Mary the Virgin was built to enclose their remains. Of their seven children, sons Richard and Henry became prominent settlers in the Monaro; daughter Christiana married Thomas Valentine Blomfield; another daughter, Honoria, married William Edward Riley of Raby, Catherine Field. The Reverend Francis Vidal was the Anglican clergyman at St. Mary Magdalene, South Creek (St. Marys) and St. Mary the Virgin, Denham Court, Liverpool during the 1840s, and his brother the Reverend George Vidal was variously the clergyman at St. Peter's Campbelltown, St. Mary the Virgin, Denham Court and St. Thomas, Mulgoa between 1846 and 1865.Liston, 2010, 8 By the late 1830s, the property was becoming the nucleus of a small village, with a mill, church and hotel. Christiana and Thomas both died in the 1850s. After some years as a ladies' boarding college run by Miss Sarah Eliza Lester, it became the home of the Blomfields' son Richard. Margaret Browne (n√©e Riley) grew up at Denham Court, Ingleburn, which had a prominent colonial garden. Browne was the first woman to write a book on gardening in Australia, under the name Mrs Rolf Boldrewood. She wrote letters to the much older Ellen Foreman (n√©e Moore), who lived with her parents at Raby, Catherine Field and later established Ellensville, Mt.Hunter. These letters survive and have been published as a book by Pacita Alexander, showing the ties between the colonial properties of the Cumberland Plain and hints of the influence of those places on the shared joys of gardening.Morris, 2014, 27 From the 1860s most of the land was subdivided and sold. In turn Richard Blomfield's son, Andrew took charge and oversaw a huge subdivision of the Denham Court property (then 1368 acres) in 1884, creating 444 blocks and leaving the old house standing on only 26 acres (10.4ha). Yet few of these blocks were sold. The 1884 auction brochure included an extensive pictorial record of the estate. There were 66 acres reserved around the house but the house did not sell until 1890 when it was purchased with by Mr J. C. Mayne. In 1901 the widower Mayne married local lass Maud McDonald. It was their niece, Miss Gowan Flora MacDOnald, who inherited the historic holding and sparked a debate with Campbelltown City Council over naming the suburb \\"Denham Court\\" in 1970. She fought tooth and nail to prevent Denham Court being used as the suburb name, making special representations to Liverpool Council asking that the name be applied to the historic Denham Court house and farm, which she owned. Any use of the name for surrounding areas was unauthorised, she argued. She suggested the \\"Edmondston\\" name be used istead, honouring locally bred John Edmondson who won the first Australian Victoria Cross for bravery in World War II. Liverpool Council, regarding it as a fine tribute to the local war hero, offered no objection. But the suburb straddled the council (local government area) boundary. And the support of Campbelltown Council was needed prior to any name change - support that was hard to find. Hostile aldermen claimed the \\"Parish of Denham Court\\" was a historic name applying to the whole area and not just the house and farm. Council objected. In November 1970 the NSW Georgaphical Names Board attempted a compromise. It decided to name part of the area within Liverpool boundary as \\"Edmonson Park\\", while the remainder would simply be \\"Denham\\". This drew unanimous criticism from Campbelltown Council and the war of words continued until 1976, when the full title was finally approved. Members of the Mayne family lived there until 1957. Since the 1970s the suburb area has been dotted with impressive mansions on large subdivided blocks. Denham Court Road notes of course the old property. It has wound across the hills since last century, but was only sealed and widened for modern traffic in 1965. Remnants of the old 1884 estate still exist in the form of Brooks Road (after the squire himself), Blomfield Road (in honour of his in-laws) and Dickson Road, after David Dickson, brother-in-law of Richard Blomfield, who helped prepare the subdivision. Woodd Road notes the Rev.G.N.Woodd, an early rector of St.Mary the Virgin church, while GIbson Road possibly recalled another local Anglican Minister, Rev.J.Gibson. Zouch Road pays tribute to Captain Henry Zouch, a police superintendent who had helped pioneer the southern districts of NSW. He had married Brooks' sixth daughter, Maria. Gowan Place honours Gowan Flora MacDonald. The surrounding area has since been developed with 1 hectare lot (minimum) subdivision which has compromised the (once extensive) views from Denham Court (around and off (east of) what are locally known as 'The Scenic Hills').Notes from Stuart Read, 23 January 2009 The 78ha property has been in the Oakey family's ownership for 35 years since c.1975 (Chancellor, 2010, 2H - Blok (2012) says the Oakeys bought it in 1974). Dr Keith Okey restored the house which he shared with his wife, Patricia and four sons, furnishing it with a magnificent collection of pre-1830s period furniture (predominantly red cedar) pieces and artwork. In 2010 the antique collection - considered one of Australia's finest individual groupings of rare and colonial Australian furniture - was sold by Sotheby's, realising over $2m.Blok, 2012 The family put the estate on the real estate market in 2010.

Jason Culina retired a year ago, about six months after buying Denham Court. The Culinas put the property on the real estate market in March 2014 to move closer to their new interior design business in the city. The property was auctioned on 13 April 2014Sydney Morning Herald, 22‚Äì23 March 2014 and was sold.  Description  Site Now comprising . In 2010 it comprised six manicured acres with tennis court.http://www.historicproperties.com.au/property/denham- court-32Ballard, 2014 The site is much reduced (it was in 2000) from its original in 1810 and an additional 250 acres acquired by Brooks during the 1820s. The estate comprising was subdivided for sale in 1884 and were reserved around the house but this lot did not sell until 1890 when it was purchased with by the Mayne family, members of whom lived there until 1957. The immediate curtilage is protected and the surrounding area has been developed with 1 hectare lot (minimum) subdivision, compromising views from Denham Court, once extensive. Denham Court faces east overlooking the valley of the Georges River. On the grassy slopes below the house lines of early ploughing can be seen where wheat and grapes once grew. The property has manicured gardens with a tennis court and a sandstone coach house. An informal avenue planting of trees runs east of the symmetrical facade of the house, downhill to its east. This comprises kurrajongs (Brachychiton populneus) and other species. One nationally rare feature of the site's landscaping is a palo blanco tree (Picconia excelsa), a relative of the olive, from the Canary Islands - a large tree which grows to the north of the house. This species is rarely found in NSW (specimens are in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, Camden Park and Cooma Cottage, Yass), and only 22 specimens are known around Australia (e.g. Botanic Gardens in Sydney, Melbourne and Geelong; Marybank in the Adelaide Hills; Yasmar, Haberfield and Cooma Cottage, near Yass). This tree is endangered in its natural habitat, the \\"laurisilva\\" cloud (rain)forests of the Canary Islands.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 6/2006, updated 10/10/2012. House The house consists of a two-storey central wing in the Grecian style flanked by single storey bow fronted pavilions with curved sash windows. Cool stone and white stucco are combined within the central two- storey section with its Roman Doric portico over the entrance doorway. The entrance hall extends the whole width of the central part of the house and is paved with diagonally laid stone. On the wall opposite the front door the stone cantileverd stair rises to the rooms above. Symmetrically placed panelled doors are set in shallow panelled recesses in the side walls, the curves of the recesses being echoed in the arched tops of the corner niches holding candle lamps in the form of classical draped figures. Two glazed doors flank the central front door beneath its stone portico.Cumberland County Council 1968 The house contains five bedrooms with two bathrooms, living areas including ball room, large formal dining room, large formal living room and library, large rumpus overlooking the in-ground swimming pool.

Heritage listing  As at 23 January 2009, Denham Court is one of the most interesting and historically significant early country houses in NSW. The site was granted to Judge-Advocate Richard Atkins and was later acquired by Captain Richard Brooks, a trader operating in the Indicant and Pacific Oceans. He applied to become a free settler and arrived in NSW with his family in 1814. The family came to Denham Court in 1820. The rear buildings at Denham Court are thought to have been built before 1820. The main part of the house, the two-storey front section was designed by John Verge in 1832. The garden contains some remnant colonial and Victorian era plantings, including an informal avenue planting east of the house and a palo alto (Picconia excelsa) tree, which is a rare species nationally. Denham Court was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

It was unveiled in 1998 and is situated outside York Minster, to commemorate the accession of Constantine as Roman Emperor in AD 306 on this site, after the death in York of his father Constantius Chlorus. Description The statue depicts a seated Constantine wearing military dress. His right arm is outstretched behind him and his left holds the pommel of a sword, the tip of which is shown to be broken. A legend inscribed on the base reads \\"Constantine by this sign conquer\\". This phrase is a translation of the latin in hoc signo vinces; a reference to a passage from the historian Eusebius of Caesaria, who recounts how Constantine was marching with his army and looked up to the sun and saw a cross of light above it, and with it the Greek words \\"(·ºêŒΩ) œÑŒøœçœÑ·ø≥ ŒΩŒØŒ∫Œ±\\" (\\"In this, conquer\\").

He appeared on the television program University Challenge in 2017, and in 2018 on Monkman & Seagull‚Äôs Genius Guide to Britain. His first book, The Life-Changing Magic of Numbers, was published in 2019. Early life and education Seagull, the second of his parents' four sons, grew up in the London Borough of Newham. His parents immigrated to East Ham from Kerala in India. Asked by an interviewer in 2017 about his \\"pretty unusual\\" name, Bobby Seagull explained, \\"My dad was very taken by the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\". He attended St Michael's Primary School followed by St Bonaventure's in Upton Park. When he was growing up, his father would take his boys regularly to East Ham Library, where Seagull was encouraged to find books that interested him. His headteacher was Michael Wilshaw. He saw an advertisement for sixth form scholarships at Eton College, and was successful in his application. Seagull started studying mathematics at the University of Oxford, but left his degree and graduated from Royal Holloway, University of London. Career After graduating from Royal Holloway, University of London, Seagull joined Lehman Brothers as a trader. He was there during the financial crisis, and has spoken about the days before it filed for bankruptcy. He left banking and worked as an accountant for Pricewaterhouse Coopers. During this time, Seagull was involved with voluntary work and training new graduates. Seagull completed a master's degree in education at the University of Cambridge whilst completing his newly qualified teacher (NQT) year. He has taught at Chesterton Community College,https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/case-studies/bobby-seagull Cambridge and East London Science School. Seagull is a part-time Maths teacher at a secondary school in London. He has created mathematics raps for his school classes. He is also leading a course on money management at the Open University. Since the start of 2018, Seagull has been pursuing a doctorate at the University of Cambridge concerning \\"mathematical anxiety and phobia\\". He has been a columnist for the Financial Times since January 2018. Seagull has since become a national campaigner to improve maths literacy. He is concerned that in the United Kingdom it is acceptable to celebrate being bad at maths as if it is a badge of honour. He is also an advocate for maths teachers, supporting them in the creation of new materials and campaigning for better pay. He has said he wants to be the \\"Jamie Oliver of maths..Jamie Oliver helped to introduce healthy food in schools. I would love to be the equivalent for mathematics where I can help change how people nationally think about it\\". He has created maths puzzles for BBC Bitesize, as well as working with Rachel Riley. Seagull releases regular maths challenges on BBC Radio 4. In 2018 he taught mathematics to three BBC News presenters, Naga Munchetty, Jayne McCubbin and Tim Muffett, before they retook their General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) mathematics paper. He presents the podcast Maths Appeal with Susan Okereke. He briefly worked at Chesterton Community College as a maths teacher for around two years. University Challenge Whilst working at East London Science School, Seagull was made captain of the Emmanuel College University Challenge team. During the competition he was praised for his enthusiasm, and his name started to trend on Twitter. He met Eric Monkman in the semi-final, where Monkman's team (Wolfson College) won. Whilst the pair started as rivals, they went on to form a friendship and began broadcasting together. Broadcasting Seagull and Monkman were given their own radio show, Monkman and Seagull's Polymathematical Adventure, in 2017.

Early life  Kane was born at the family home on August 28, 1844 in Newport, Rhode Island. She was the second youngest of eight children born to Oliver DeLancey Kane (1816‚Äì1874) and Louisa Dorothea (n√©e Langdon) Kane (1821‚Äì1894). Her brothers were Walter Langdon Kane, John Innes Kane, DeLancey Astor Kane, S. Nicholson Kane, and Woodbury Kane. Her sisters were the artist Louisa Langdon Kane, and Emily Astor Kane (who married Augustus Jay and was the mother of Peter Augustus Jay). She was the granddaughter of Walter Langdon and Dorothea (n√©e Astor) Langdon and the great-granddaughter of John Jacob Astor. She was also a cousin of Lt. Col. John Jacob Astor IV. Her paternal lineage descended from John O'Kane who emigrated to the country in 1752 from County Londonderry and Antrim, Ireland. During the American Revolutionary War, O'Kane (who dropped the \\"'O\\" once in America) was living at Sharyvogne, his estate in Dutchess County, which was confiscated after the War due to his Loyalist times. His eldest son, John Jr., stayed and became one of the most prominent merchants in New York. In New York, the family lived at 23 West 47th Street. In Newport, the family lived at \\"Beach Cliffe\\", designed by Detlef Lienau, which was one of the earliest Newport cottages \\"to attain a sort of Beaux-Arts purity.\\" Society life In 1892, Kane, as the youngest unmarried daughter of her parents, and two of her brothers (Nicholas, DeLancey, and his wife Eleanora Iselin) were included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times.

She worked first at the \\"Scuola Media Statale Alcide De Gasperi\\" (state school) and later at the \\"A. Damiani Technical Institute of Agriculture\\" in Marsala. Politics In 1993 Adamo became an Education Assessor (\\"Assessore alla Pubblica Istruzione\\"), working for the centre-left regional government in Marsala, under the direction of the mayor (\\"sindaco\\" - and ex-football referee) Salvatore Lombardo. In 1998 and again in 2003 Adamo was elected president of the Province of Trapani in western Sicily. She achieved a wide coalition of support on the Provincial Council despite (or because of) not herself being a member of any political party at this stage. Two years later, however, in 2005, she joined the recently launched centre-right Forza Italia. Her Provincial Council mandate was due to expire in 2008, but in December 2005 she resigned early in order to be able to compete as a Forza Italia list candidate in the forthcoming elections for the Sicilian Regional Assembly. In the regional elections of May 2006 she secured election with a convincing vote level. She became president of the assembly commission for Environment and Land. In 2008 Adamo was re-elected, again with a solid vote level, this time representing the newly emerging \\"Il Popolo della Libert√†\\" (PDL / \\"The People of Freedom\\") party. However, in a development which generated a certain amount of derision on the part of commentators, and following an apparently last minute strategic change of heart by her political colleague and successor as provincial president in Trapani, Antonio D'Al√¨, she failed to win nomination from her own regional council and was therefore suspended from the party (which was itself dissolved a few years later). Adamo now approached Gianfranco Miccich√®, a Sicilian politician with a ministerial record in Italian national governments. They discussed creating a political alliance with the express objective of protecting the interests of Sicily in the face of the political lines pursued by the PDL and Lega Nord parties with their roots in the Italian centre and north. Adamo became president of the \\"PDL Sicilia\\" group within the Regional Assembly, which comprised followers of the leading national politician Gianfranco Fini and other former members of Forza Italia close to Miccich√®. However, following the dissolution of this \\"PDL Sicilia\\" group in September 2010 Adamo declined to follow Miccich√® and his supporters into the new (and short-lived) Great South (\\"Grande Sud\\" party), following differences over support for the regional government chaired by Raffaele Lombardo. On 14 October 2010 she joined the recently configured Union of the Centre (UdC), becoming president of the party's group in the Assembly and co-coordinator for the party, with Gianni Pompeo, the mayor of Castelvetrano, in Trapani. In 2011 she became regional party president. On 21 May 2012 Giulia Adamo was elected Sindaco (Mayor) of Marsala. Her rival candidate was Salvatore Ombra. From the first round of the election she narrowly failed to win more than 50% of the votes, but in the second round, in which only the top two candidates from the first round were eligible to stand, she obtained nearly 66% of the votes. On 22 August 2012 she resigned her seat in the Sicilian Regional Assembly in order to be able to devote herself fully to her role as mayor. The Marsala council which she led was supported by the UdC, the Democratic Party (DP), the so-called \\"Crocetta List\\" and various other local group. On 18 December 2013 Adamo resigned her membership of the UdC, explaining that when she had joined it three years earlier she had been excited and exhilarated by the party's renewal project for Sicily, but that in the absence of any follow-through she felt that her membership of it was simply serving to constrain her freedom to act as she thought best in respect of her political responsibilities to the voters of Marsala. In 2014 Adamo lost her appeal in respect of her criminal conviction. A criminal investigation had been launched nearly a decade earlier, but the prosecutor's hand had been greatly strengthened by the so-called Severino Laws of 2012. Adamo was now debarred from holding public office for a term of eighteen months, which meant suspension from her mayoral duties on 19 July 2014. She reacted by resigning the office permanently on 23 July 2014. Judicial matters Giulia Adamo was indicted for extortion on 30 June 2006. The indictment alleged that she had exerted pressure on the directors of a boarding school (\\"Convitto per audiofonolesi\\") in Marsala, in order to have the rector replaced with a different individual, named by her. After the usual hearings, appeals and delays she secured an acquittal from the Court of Appeal in Palermo. However, on 26 January 2012 the Supreme Court of Cassation in Rome annulled the Palermo decision and sent the matter back for retrial. In 2010 Adamo was condemned by the Rome-based Court of Audit which required her to pay back a total amount of at least 385,000 Euros to four different institutions with which, as president of the Trapani, she had had dealings since 2000. The payments in question had been identified as consultancy fees, but the definition was one that the court rejected. Reports reflect an opinion on the part of the court and commentators that even by the standards of the time and place the amounts involved were large. Some of the stronger descriptions applied in connection with the court judgment included \\"inescusabile leggerezza e negligenza\\" (loosely, \\"inexcusable casual negligence\\") and \\"il vero e proprio dolo\\" (loosely, \\"the real unadulterated fraudulence\\"). On 14 January 2014 reports emerged of an investigation launched by the public prosecutor in Palermo into suspicions involving 500,000 Euros of public money allegedly diverted for private use. The investigation was reportedly launched in 2012 and concerned the so-called \\"ARS coalition\\" group of deputies among whom Adamo was a leading figure in the Sicilian Regional Assembly during the political upheavals of 2010. Adamo's first response when asked about a jewel which she had purchased (it was said) while on holiday in Brazil during 2011 was a question: \\"Ma quando mai?\\" (\\"But when?\\"). On receiving a persuasive answer on that point, she agreed that she had purchased the item, but explained she had purchased the jewel to have it set in a cup to be gifted to the son of Nino Strano, another important and respected Sicilian politician. In short the jewel was purchased in order to be part of a wedding present. The prosecutor's office naturally asked both Nino Strano and his son for confirmation of this explanation. It turned out that neither man could remember having received the gift, even though there had not been so many (wedding presents): \\"... E regali non ne abbiamo ricevuto tanti\\". On 16 July 2014 the \\"Prima Sezione\\" of the Palermo Appeal Court sentenced Giulia Adamo to a prison term of two years and ten months on the charge of attempted extortion. There was also a five year ban on holding public office. A couple of days later, in an application of the recently enacted Severino Laws, Adamo was suspended from her mayoral duties for eighteen months. She resigned the office permanently a week or so later. On 6 May 2015 the Court of Cassation \\"definitively acquitted\\" Adamo, which meant cancellation of the prison sentence which had been imposed for attempted extortion on 16 July 2014. The ban on holding public office seems also to have been implicitly rescinded. On 16 November 2015 Adamo was acquitted on charges involving disrespecting a public official (\\"oltraggio a pubblico ufficiale\\") - a relatively recent addition to the Italian schedule of indictable crimes. The court also acquitted her co-accused, Gregorio Saladino. The case arose out of a complaint from a traffic policemen who testified that had asked the two of them to move a scooter which they had parked in the Via Garibaldi in front of the old market building. Their reaction was to recommend that he might wish to perform his duties in another part of the town. The traffic policeman alleged that Giulia Adamo, in concert with her companion, a municipal councillor called Gregorio Saladino, had reacted towards him in a verbally threatening manner. Luigi Cassata, Adamo's defence lawyer, was able to reassure the court that his client had not offended anyone. Whatever she might have said to the good officer was intended simply to restore the excellent performance and efficiency of administrative duties in respect of traffic policing. The defence lawyer representing Gregorio Saladina was a man called Sebastiano Genna, whose arguments were not dissimilar in character. He also pointed out that there had been plenty of other scooters parked in the same place at the same time. Judge Sara Quittino, sitting alone, was evidently persuaded. On 12 July 2016 an indictment was issued against eleven deputies or former deputies, including Giulia Adamo, by Riccardo Ricciardi, a Palermo plenary court judge (\\"Giudice dell'udienza preliminare\\"). The indictment concerned embezzlement allegations involving expenses claims submitted by members of the Regional Assembly. In June 2017 it was reported that the Court of Cassation had rejected some of the embezzlement allegations included in the indictment. That meant that five of those named had been acquitted of all the embezzlement charges alleged. For six others, although some of the charges against them had been investigated and found insufficiently persuasive, there were other embezzlement charges that were still listed on what survived of Judge Ricciardi's original indictment. Giuilia Adamo was one of the six Regional Assembly deputies or former deputies for whom charges remained on the indictment.

It was designed by James Meehan (first house, barn), James Hume (attrib: second and current house) and built from 1810 to 1843 by James Meehan (first house); Mr Burns (woodwork in second, current house). It is also known as Macquarie Field House and the Meehan remains; Macquariefield, Macquarie Fields and Macquarie Field. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  An initial 1809 grant of to James Meehan had expanded to ( of which were cleared) by 1820, in 1826, in 1877, approximately were in NSW Government ownership by 1944, the remaining area of open space today is not stated nor analysed. The current SHR curtilage area, plus land proposed in the application to be community open space, totals approximately .Devine, 2011 Meehan (1774-1826) was a middle-class Catholic Irishman whose flirtation with the Society of United Irishmen in 1796-8 led to his conviction as a member of a proscribed organisation, although he did not take part in the actual uprising (the 'Irish Rebellion') of 1798. As a result, the 25-year-old school teacher and surveyor arrived in Sydney in February 1800 on the convict ship \\"Friendship\\" to serve a life sentence. Because of his valuable experience as a surveyor in Ireland, Meehan was soon assigned to the Surveyor-General of the colony, at first Augustus Alt, but after 1801, Charles Grimes. Meehan was the only one of four assistant surveyors with qualifications, so from the start his competence and diligence earned him uncommon freedoms and by 1803 he had done survey work not only on Sydney's Cumberland Plain but as far afield as the Hunter, Port Phillip and Van Diemen's Land. In 1805 he received a conditional pardon and was acting as chief surveyor of NSW in Grimes' absence. Meehan had, while still a convict, received a land grant of 100 acres in the Field of Mars in 1803.Jack, 2015, 1 By 1802 he had been on two major expeditions and, by 1806, had been conditionally pardoned. He continued to work on departmental duties, and, from difficult beginnings, had a remarkable rise to be an important colonial surveyor, explorer and settler, surveying and mapping large areas of the country. The early towns of Sydney, Parramatta, Bathurst, Port Macquarie and Hobart were all explored, laid out and measured by Meehan. A statue of him was commissioned by the Land & Property Management Authority to commemorate Meehan's close collaboration with NSW Public Works Heritage Services and the Government Architect's Office. This new statue of Meehan was placed on the south-east corner of the former Lands Department Building in November 2010 to commemorate Meehan's achievements. In 1806 Meehan began living with English convict, Ruth Goodaire, in a leased town house. Their son Thomas was born in 1808 and daughter Mary in 1810. While senior surveyor, Meehan received in Bankstown in 1808 and in June and August 1809 two grants in Minto totalling straddling Bunbury Curran Creek. He gave up his FIeld of Mars grant, but when Governor Macquarie arrived in 1810 and regularised most of the grants made in the difficult preceding years, Meehan's Minto holdings were increased by the addition of several adjacent farms, surrendered by their previous grantees, making an integrated estate of in 1810. It was a provision of Macquarie's grant and regrant of 1810 that Meehan must cultivate at Minto by 1815 and, although there are few details, there is no doubt that Meehan developed the estate while continuing as a busy government surveyor until 1822. He acquired more adjacent land and in October 1816 Macquarie issued a further consolidating grant for a \\"Macquariefield\\" which now embraced .Jack, 2015, 2 It is not known how soon (after 1809) Meehan began to erect substantial buildings. Huts would, however, have been required for stockmen from the beginning and certainly by 1814 when he was supplying the government with of meat, the same as his neighbours Charles Throsby and William Redfern. In the first years much of the acreage remained uncleared and uncultivated. There was certainly some kind of accommodation on the estate by 1811, when the Governor directed people with promises of land in Airds to 'attend at Mr Meehan's Farm on the Bunbury Curran Creek' to meet the surveyor. The brick barn is plausibly dated to between 1814-1816. The question is open whether the main house was built before or after the barn and whether the house was built in stages. At all events, it was complete when Rev. Thomas Reddell converted it into a school in 1821.Jack, 2015, 5 There was more consistent direct oversight in 1818 and 1819 when Meehan was spending more time there than at his Sydney house. But Macquarie then insisted that his senior surveyor be resident in Sydney. Meehan complied and at the end of 1820 agreed to lease the house and garden to the governor for use by the Rev. Thomas Reddall as a private school for 18 months. During this time Governor Macquarie's son Lachlan attended this school.Jack, 2015, 5 When Meehan returned to Macquariefield in 1822 land cleared for crops amounted to only , most of which was used for wheat, the remaining for maize. Grazing land supported 16 horses, 450 cattle, 1200 sheep and 25 pigs. He immediately sought the help of convict clearing gangs and between June 1822 and June 1823 were cleared. Meehan used Macquariefield primarily for stock and only secondarily for cropping.Jack, 2015, 3 The first house built on this site, 'Meehan's Castle', built but possibly not completed until 1818,Jack, 2015 was a two- storey structure of even greater prominence on the then bare hill than the later (and remaining) house which was built in the 1840s. Meehan chose its site because it was the only strategic outcrop in the region, effectively being a naturally fortified rampart with panoramic views. This was important for both security and observation, in Sydney's first expansion to the southwest in a time of Aboriginal attacks and general unrest. The siting shows Meehan's skill in planning the settlement of New South Wales.Devine, 2011 Meehan built a second complex, including an 11-room farmhouse, dairy and an eight-stall stable, at some distance to the north of his own house, more accessible to Bunbury Curran Creek. This ancillary farmhouse is probably the two-storey building shown by artist Frederick Terry (1850s-60s watercolour panorama) on the extreme right of his painting.Jack, 2015, 4 Although the barn on the main site has been claimed as a convict barracks, the labourers on Meehan's estate are much more likely to have been accommodated in the 11-room farmhouse. The buildings of this second group do not seem to have survived and their archaeological potential is unknown.Jack, 2015, 4 In 1822 Meehan retired from his position as Deputy Surveyor-General and for the first time became a full-time farmer. He was in some financial stress, partly because the government had paid only the first installment of rent for Reddall's use of Macquariefield as a school and there were arrears in salary payments for his last months in office. Accordingly, in 1823 he mortgaged the property to Samuel Terry for over ¬£1300. Terry was the classic instance of a successful convict. By hard work, shrewdness and ruthless determination he had become a merchant and land dealer of heroic proportions. He is known as \\"the Botany Bay Rothschild\\".Jack, 2015, 6 Meehan died in April 1826.Jack, 2015, 3 On his death, all his real estate passed to his only son, Thomas. In 1829, two years after probate had been granted, Terry complained that no payment had yet been made to him and that Thomas was \\"dispensing and otherwise making away with the personal property of his late Father... to the great injury of the Creditors\\". Terry was successful in obtaining letters of administration and appointed William Charles Wentworth as proctor to protect his interests. Terry then sued Thomas Meehan for ¬£5,000 and on 25 January 1831 Thomas transferred the of Macquariefield to the mortgagee. The normal spelling (of its name) then changed to \\"Macquarie Field\\". Terry himself never lived at Macquarie Field: it was only one of a string of major pastoral properties he acquired. His preferred residence was Box Hill House on the Windsor Road. When Samuel died in 1838, his huge estate was divided among his children and step- children.Jack, 2015, 6 The five or six buildings on the estate advertised for sale in April 1829 were substantial. Only one (the barn) now survives above ground, but the precise location of the principal residence can be fixed because of historic images and material remains, while the general location of others is known from an abortive subdivision in July 1829.Jack, 2015, 3 Under Samuel Terry's will, his youngest child, Martha Foxlowe Hosking, born in 1811, received Macquarie Field, town houses in Pitt Street and 10,000 pounds. She also inherited a share in the residual estate; and when her brother Edward died childless in 1838, she inherited much of his wealth also. Her father was very careful to ensure that Martha held Macquarie Field in her own right and that the profist from the estate remained for \\"her sole and separate use\\". She had married John Hosking in 1829, son of a prominent school teacher. After six years in Britain, Hosking returned to Sydney in 1825 as an ambitious businessman. In partnership with John Terry Hughes, Martha's cousin, he had a flamboyant career as a merchant, land dealer and pastoralist. He was elected Sydney's first Lord Mayor in 1842 and considered standing for the Legislative Council.Jack, 2015, 6 The firm of Hughes and Hosking however, over-reached itself and went insolvent in 1843-45. The 1845 Insolvency Court proceedings reveal much about the building of the second Macquarie Field house. 'A cottage was commenced about 2 years before my sequestration (1841) - and I think it was not finally completed until after my sequestration (1843). In consideration of my receiving 10,000 pounds in cash from Mr Terry's will - a legacy to Mrs Hosking, and other moneys which came to my hands in consequence of the death of her brother, I agreed with Mrs Hosking that I should build the cottage, which has cost, with other improvements, about 2000 ponds - it may be more'. Hosking goes out of his way (in giving evidence) to declare that 'No portion of the sum due to Mr Hume (is) for building or for any work at \\"Macquarie Field\\".' This is a reference to documents elsewhere in the legal exhibits. James Hume had designed and built three houes in Cumberland Street in The Rocks for Hosking in 1843 and two years later was still owed 250 pounds for those services. Hosking's disclaimer in 1845 shows that Hume had also designed Macquarie FIeld House (the second homestead) in 1841 and had supervised its construction over the next two years. Hume had come to Sydney from Scotland in 1835 at the invitation of Alexander Macleay to assist John Verge construct(ing) Elizabeth Bay House, while simultaneously supervising works at St. Andrew's Cathedral. He first apepars as an independent architect in 1839 designing the Gothic Presbyterian church in Wollongong. More significant commissions in the early 1840s included Sir Thomas Mitchell's Carthona (Darling Point) and Parkhall (St. Mary's Towers, at Douglas Park), the new Jewish Synagogue and Presbyterian Church in Pitt Street, while Hume was also supervising construction of Burdekin House in Macquarie Street.Jack, 2015, 6-7 James Hume has not previously appeared as a possible architect for the Hoskings' new house. The only candidate who has hitherto been proposed is Francis Clarke, supported, with caution, by Rachel Roxburgh. Clarke had come to the colony with good English credentials in 1832 and is best known for his Anglican churches at Richmond and at St. Marys, both built between 1837 and 1841. The only surviving private home tentatively attributed to him, on slender evidence, is Lindesay at Darling Point. Clarke was a friend of the Hoskings, chosen by them in 1842 to be one of two trustees to protect Martha's interests in the Macquarie Field estate. He had by 1836 built a suite of houses in Pitt Street for Samuel Terry that was inherited by Martha in 1838. But evidence in support of Clarke (as architect of Macquarie Field House) is entirely inferential, whereas the words of John Hosking himself, retrieved from a stack of court papers after 170 years, now make it almost certain that the architect of this house was Hume.Jack, 2015, 8 The present Macquarie Field House was built some to the south-east (of Meehan's Castle) in the early 1840s, but the houses co-existed for over a century. Meehan's farmhoue was not demolished until 1958.Jack, 2015, 5 Although Hosking kept horses and carriages at Macquarie Field and furnished the cottage, for which he received ¬£3,000 from his wife, the couple did not live there in the 1840s. The brand new house was occupied by an overseer, who was a ticket-of-leave man called WIlliam Potter, and there were 12 salaried workmen, probably housed in one or both of Meehan's farmhouses. There was a characteristic range of trades covering the needs of a colonial mixed farm: ploughman, groom, bullock-driver, carter, wheelwright, cook, dairman and gardener. There was a casual burner of stumps on newly-cleared land as well as a casual trencher.Jack, 2015, 9 The Hoskings were using Macquarie Field as part of their own estates from at least 1834. Young Nimrod, a stallion bred by Samuel Terry, was serving mares at Macquarie Field in 1839 and 1840 under Hosking's superintendent there, James Marshall. After 1843 there was a turnover of superintendents living in the new house: William Potter (1844), G. Peacock (1845). The farm was used as a staging post for supplies to more distant stations which engaged the interest of John and Martha Hosking, at Molonglo near Canberra and on the Macintyre River up on the Queensland border. The dairy produced butter for the Sydney market. Horse- breeding with stallions such as Young Nimrod and Vagabond continued, producing walers for the Indian market in the 1850s. In 1854 Hosking was able to sell off 100 surplus horses as well as a thoroughbred Durham bull. At this time in 1854 the Hoskings were living in Vaucluse House, while the Wentworths were away. But in 1855 the Hoskings moved for the first and only time to Macquarie Field and made it their principal residence until 1858. Three significant changes were made to the house in those three years: the addition of the front portico, construction of a garden alcove and installation of a grand driveway close to the Liverpool Road.Jack, 2015, 10 From 1858 until early 1869, the barn and Meehan's former residence were renovated and adapted to accommodate a boys' boarding school, run by Rev. George Macarthur. The residence became dormitories, with accommodation for the matron as well as some store rooms.Jack, 2015, 6 Macarthur took over administration of and teaching of boys for (from) The Kings School in this location when it fell into troubled times at its base in Parramatta. After Macarthur's school moved to The Kings School in Parramatta in 1869, Meehan's house gradually deteriorated, and became more store than residence, as a 1924 E.G.Shaw photograph.Jack, 2015, 6 Macquarie Field House estate was closely associated with the alignment chosen for the Great Southern Railway Line. The then owner of Macquarie Fields House, John Hoskings Jr, (first Mayor of Sydney) was a member of the Liverpool Committee making recommendations on the route for the new southern railway line in the 1850s. The line to Campbelltown was opened in 1858 and Macquarie Fields formed a significant part of the attractive scenery along the route, described as including elegant cottages and substantial homesteads. In 1862 the line was extended to Menangle, and in 1869 a railway platform (later Ingleburn station) was opened on the Macquarie Fields estate. As a stimulant to regional development, carrier of pupils to the school on site from 1858 to 1869, and commuters since 1858, the views from the railway line are of key importance to the understanding and presentation of this property, and its importance in association with the property, and in determining an appropriate curtilage and defining key views, can not be overlooked. Macquarie Field House and its associated farmlands have attracted public interest over a long period of time, as is reflected by their inclusion in the original County of Cumberland Planning Scheme of 1951. The National Trust of Australia (NSW) nominated the house in 1964 and classified it on their register in 1974. The Australian Heritage Commission received a nomination in 1977 and listed the house on the Register of the National Estate in 1978. The Commission separately received a nomination in 1981 for the garden, noting its deliberate siting and visual prominence, which led to a further listing in 1991. In response to concerns in the late 1970s at the prospect of Government disposal, possible subdivision of the land and the house's demise, the then Minister for Planning & Environment placed a permanent conservation order over the house in 1981. This was made over Lot 1, comprising the house and a small area of land comprising the top of the hilltop on which it sits, most of its plantings and a small area of slope to the east. This lot and PCO boundary were created for sale to Mr David Jamieson, who had leased the house since 1962 and restored it. This also alienated the house protecting it from the activities of the Veterinary Research Station, but maintained all other structures, archaeological sites and land (including the remains of Meehan's Castle demolished by the Army for the Department of Agriculture in 1943) in government ownership. These were left outside Lot 1 and the 1981 PCO, because the land outside Lot 1 was managed by the Department of Agriculture for agricultural purposes (an appropriate setting), and was not considered to be under threat. When the Department of Agriculture in 1982 notified its intention to move its operations to Camden, and proposals forwarded to redevelop the site (from rural to residential), it was found necessary to extend the PCO boundary to include Meehan's Castle and other relics, in the second, expanded PCO of 1985. This boundary included the land east of the house down to Bunbury Curran Creek, and more of the Hilltop slopes to the northeast and north of the house, including part of the original entrance drive along Quarter Sessions Road, thought to provide a more appropriate rural curtilage. In response to the Department of Agriculture's decision in 1982 to relocate their operations to Camden and possibly redevelop the site (for residential rather than rural use) the then Department of Environment & Planning adopted a recommendation to retain the land as a non-urban backdrop to the northern urban areas of Campbelltown and to cater for special use services which may require a site in future. In 1985 the area of the permanent conservation order was extended to include outbuildings, key tree plantings, archaeological remains of the earlier house, \\"Meehan's Castle\\", the hilltop on which the homestead group is sited and the \\"visual curtilage\\" of this rural site. Campbelltown City Council approved a Local Environmental Plan and a Development Control Plan over the adjoining rural land in 1991, to ensure appropriate rural type uses in any future development, which would respect the heritage significance of the property and its regional role as providing both a landmark and a rural backdrop to adjoining suburbs Glenfield, Macquarie Fields and Ingleburn to the east. The current SHR curtilage boundary thus reflects concerns in the early 1980s that the Department of Agriculture would relocate, and the land would be subdivided and redeveloped, which in turn could cause damage to plantings, structures, outbuildings, important known archaeological relics, such as the remains of Meehan's Castle and to the rural setting of Macquarie Fields House. The north and south boundaries followed existing fencing lines. Campbelltown City Council's DCP 63 of 1991 and the Masterplan adopted in line with DCP 63 have further defined areas of visual sensitivity on this land, including two corridors of visual significance through the adjoining valleys and significant landscape features in views from the southwestern freeway, being the highest ridgeline, off which Macquarie Fields House's hilltop branches as a spur. The Monarch development, Macquarie Links, in construction to the south of Macquarie Fields House's hilltop has compromised the open, rural setting of the place and is considered intrusive. This development has introduced two storey dwellings located both high on the ridge (a DCP 63 identified significant landscape feature) requiring visual screening from the southwestern freeway by earth mounding (further reducing the views available from the ridgeline to the east), close to the Macquarie Fields House hilltop and outbuildings, and on the upper valley slopes, also items of high visual significance as viewed from the railway line, Glenfield, Macquarie Fields and Ingleburn to the east. Despite Macquarie Fields House's dense screen planting close to the homestead reducing the views to this development from the house, this development will continue to erode the visual significance of the setting of Macquarie Fields House as a remnant farm estate, and its associated plantings could also in time further obscure the open views to and from the property. A Visual Character Study by Cloustons was commissioned by the Department of Urban Affairs & Planning in late 1998 in response to public concern about the adverse impacts of the Macquarie Links development immediately south of Macquarie Fields House, which is highly visible from the southwestern freeway and from the railway line and suburbs to the east. The study noted that part of the proposed housing (in the southeast corner) was within the DCP 63 significant view corridor. While this study was valuable in documenting views and visual impacts from the freeway and in ranking landscape character elements, the Heritage Office had strong concerns about its inadequacy in giving equal weight to addressing the visual impacts of the development from the railway line to the east, in line with the intent of LEP 112 and DCP 63 to retain rural landscape character. The Heritage Office voiced concern that new housing on open valley slopes, a landscape character element ranked in this study as having high visual significance, would have adverse visual impacts on the retention of open rural landscape. The Heritage Office also commented that this open landscape character is of high cultural value as part of the heritage curtilage or setting of Macquarie Fields House. The Heritage Council decided at its meeting of 19 August 1999 not to grant approval for a community title subdivision comprising 171 residential lots, one heritage protection lot and one community association lot including 9 private accessways, on land known as Macquarie Fields, considering that the development would materially effect the heritage significance of Macquarie Fields House, in part because it required the subdivision of the existing SHR curtilage. The Heritage Council informed Campbelltown City Council that it considered there should be no further subdivision of the SHR curtilage, that it noted the absence of a conservation management plan for the property, and, at that time, the absence of a heritage impact statement addressing the integrity of Macquarie Fields House as a remnant rural estate including open farmland. The Heritage Council invited the applicant to prepare a conservation management plan for the whole estate including the house and open lands outside the SHR curtilage, and to submit a heritage impact statement for any future proposal, based on the recommendations of this conservation management plan. The Heritage Council also commented in relation to impacts of the application outside the SHR curtilage that it considered the land use, scale, density and form of the development proposed did not respect the cultural heritage significance of Macquarie Fields House and its setting. The Heritage Council recommended that Campbelltown City Council and the applicant undertake further work to review DCP 63 and the adopted masterplan for the land to take into account recent approvals and development (since 1991), the recommendations of a Heritage Council study Colonial Landscapes of the Cumberland Plain and Camden concerning Macquarie Fields House estate, recommendations of the applicant's 1998 Curtilage Study and appropriate design detail on treatments, colours and materials of any buildings or structures, minimum lot sizes, setbacks required from key elements and greater detail on how the open, rural character of the land can be conserved and enhanced. At its meeting on 20 January 2000 the Heritage Council resolved to defer final resolution on the amended application by Winten Property Group DA G3000 12/98 for a community title subdivision of 168 community title dwellings and community facilities on Lot 4 DP 854870, Lots 1, 3 & 7 DP 828871 and Lot 1 DP 612265 Campbelltown Road and Quarter Sessions Road, Glenfield.Read, Stuart, 2000  Description  Setting Macquarie Field House is the core of a remnant colonial farm and an important and rare surviving example of a substantial mid-19th century colonial farm estate on the Cumberland Plain in open, cleared land. It comprises a homestead group, garden and outbuildings set on top of an eastern facing ridge, flanked by two small vallies to north and south. The Southern valley contains a recent golf course residential estate, Macquarie Links Estate. The northern valley contains home paddocks once part of the farm, with some scattered African olive trees along fence lines. Additional paddocks form part of different land ownerships, including to the north and north-east, the former Glenfield Agricultural Research Station and Hurlstone Agricultural High School. The ridge is elevated giving the homestead (once) expansive views to the north, east and south-east and (once) also to the west. The Hume Highway passes close by to the west, now screened by sound walls. Macquarie Fields House's hilltop site has panoramic views available for an arc of about 270 degrees, from the northwest to southwest. The house's hilltop twin hoop pine tree plantings are (and formerly the house also was) a prominent landmark in the district, due to their siting on a prominent spur close to the highest ridgeline, as viewed from the Great Southern Railway line, and higher parts of Glenfield, Macquarie Fields and Ingleburn. Garden and Outbuildings The homestead sits on the eastern tip of the elevated ridge - almost a peninsula in landform. To its west are a number of farm outbuildings, some 19th century and some 20th century. A large ruin of a colonial brick structure, possibly an agricultural store building or barn, lies to the house's south-west. The garden is neglected for much of the late 20th century but is in essence a mid 19th century hill-top garden. Its detail has been almost totally destroyed however, its planting of 2 very large hoop pines (Araucaria cunninghamii), African olives (Olea europaea var. Africana) and two species of pepper trees, Brazilian (Schinus molle var. areira) and Chilean (S.terebinthifolia) survives forming a prominent landmark of dense closely textured plantation on a dominant hill-top site. Two impressive sets of entrance gates and piers (one set a re-construction) open onto the drive, now brick paved, which leads to the house sited on a level hill-top plateau overlooking the village of Macquarie Fields to the east. The drive, originally encircling the house, now terminates in a paved car park, the rest being grassed over. The plateau and original drive are ringed with African olives and pepper trees. More olives, the remnants of hedges and also self-sown, clothe the sides of the hill. Built into the hillside, directly below the front of the house (i.e. east) is an elliptical, apsidal, restored brick alcove or belvedere for a garden seat, now in ruins. A roof has been recently built to protect this structure. House The house is essentially two storied, being raised above extensive cellars, accessed by a staircase internally on its west. The front door faces east, the rear door west, with a central corridor and rooms arrayed to north and south. A bay window on the house's northern side allows clear views into the northern valley with its home paddocks.

The house is a fine sandstone Regency dwelling built c.1838-40 by Samuel Terry and represents the final flowering of the Australian colonial country house style, symmetrical in plan, bold in mass and outline, possessing qualities of simplicity, unity and repose, tempered with a refinement of detail and a careful control in the disposition of the various elements in the design. The property has considerable historical, architectural and archaeological significance as the site of the estate of three well known colonial figures* and for its associations with an early period of colonial history. (*James Meehan, ex-convict who became Deputy Surveyor General and surveyed much of the land south of Sydney between 1810-1820, and then of Samuel Terry, ex-convict, \\"Botany Bay millionaire\\" for his daughter and her husband John Hosking, the first elected Mayor of Sydney). The complex has regional aesthetic significance as its siting closely relates to the surrounding landscape, being a landmark on a prominent hilltop amidst along undulating ridge of high land, surrounded by mature trees, and commanding expensive views to the south and west. This siting demonstrates the Australian nineteenth century fashion for picturesque country estate development which followed the eighteenth century English landscape tradition, and its corresponding attention to lands ape siting and moulding and the cultivation of a \\"prospect\\". It also demonstrates the distinctive lifestyle of the early nineteenth century County of Cumberland settler, including their deliberate moulding of the landscape's appearance. While the detail of the early arcadian style garden has been eroded, the remainder of Meehan's original 1810 land grant, plantings of mature Araucarias, pepper trees, African olives and oleanders and the open rural cultural landscape surrounding the estate are relatively intact today, adding to the significance of the property. Specific remains identified on site to date include Meehan's Farm House or 'Castle'(1806‚Äì10), the Barn which was reputedly built or supervised by Government Architect Francis Greenway, of significance for its interesting architectural form and possible early use as a fortified barn and associated relics such as a wall along the southern side of the house, an early rubbish dump, two early wells, a possible early school house, possible remains of the flour mill and water race erected on the Bunbury Curran Creek. (Draft Statement of Significance, Jan 1999, Heritage Office) The garden has largely been re-formed and has lost its detail but its importance is its wider landscape quality, the overall effect of its impressive dense, rich planting on its dominant hill-top site. It is an important link in the chain of \\"Cowpasture\\" gardens - the gardens of the large mid 19th century homesteads of the county of Cumberland distinctively planted with olives, oleanders, araucarias etc. which still punctuate the landscape of the outer south-western Sydney region. The garden alcove, although in ruins, is a rare example in the colony of substantial garden architectureJames Broadbent for National Trust of Australia, 1981 Macquarie Fields House is of exceptional value as a substantial mid-19th century homestead, prominently sited, with important remnant plantings, layout and archaeological features including a rare example of an exedran garden alcove (below the house on the eastern slope capitalising on the wide views, built s and on the site of an even earlier structure). The Group has considerable value in the local area as a major visual and historical reference point. A contributing factor to this prominence is the juxtaposition of the homestead and landmark vegetation to the open rural landscape surrounding them. The Group has value for its archaeological research potential and strong associations with various individuals prominent in the 19th century.Britton, G. & Morris, C., 2000 Macquarie Field House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Her research interests include development economics, health economics, and labor economics.  Biography  Seema Jayachandran earned a BS in Electrical Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1993. As a Marshall Scholar, she studied Physics and Philosophy at the University of Oxford. In 1997, she began graduate studies in Physics at Harvard University, but completed a PhD in Economics in 2004. After her graduation and a term as post-doctoral fellow as RWJ Scholar in Health Policy at The University of California at Berkeley, she became an assistant professor of economics at Stanford University (2006‚Äì11). In 2011, Jayachandran moved to Northwestern University as Associate Professor of Economics before becoming a full professor in 2018. In parallel, she has held visiting appointments at Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She also maintains affiliations as a Research associate with the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), as a fellow of the Bureau for Research in Economic Analysis of Development (BREAD) as well as with the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL). Moreover, she performs editorial duties for the academic journals American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, Quarterly Journal of Economics, Journal of Economic Perspectives, and Science. Finally, she has worked as a consultant for United Nations Development Program and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.Curriculum vitae of Seema Jayachandran from her personal webpage. Retrieved October 11th, 2018. In addition to her research, she has written for The New York Times, appeared on Science Friday, and done a \\"Science Ask Me Anything\\" on Reddit.  Research  Seema Jayachandran's research focuses on health, development economics, and environmental economics. Her research has been acknowledged through several awards, including a Sloan Research Fellowship in 2011, an NSF CAREER Award in 2011, and the Sustainability Science Award from the Ecological Society of America in 2018. Much of Jayachandran's work is in development economics, including maternal and child health in Africa and South Asia. A substantial body of her research concerns gender differences. In India, she finds that there is a tension between the desire for smaller families and the desire to have at least one son, making son preference stronger as family sizes shrink.Jayachandran, Seema. (2017). Fertility Decline and Missing Women. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 9(1), pp. 118-139. She estimates that fertility decline can explain one-third to one-half of the increase in the number of \\"missing women\\" in India. In work with Erica Field and R Pande, she also finds evidence that patriarchic gender norms in India constrain female entrepreneurship, with Muslim women (the sociocultural group with the most restrictions) being unable to benefit from business training.Field, E., Jayachandran, S., Pande, R. (2010). Do traditional institutions constrain female entrepreneurship? A field experiment on business training in India. American Economic Review, 100(2), pp. 125‚Äì129. Another important focus of Jayachandran's research revolves around deforestation in Indonesia and Uganda. In a 2008 publication, she showed that massive forest fires in Indonesia caused air pollution that had adverse impacts on pregnant women and babies in poor communities, leading to more than 15,000 fetal and infant deaths. In 2017, she published research showing that landowners in Uganda would preserve forests if they were paid to preserve forest cover. However, her most cited article is about the impact that the departure of US Senator Jim Jeffords from the Republican to the Democratic Parties in 2001 had on the valuation of companies that had previously donated large sums of money to Republican Senators. This was the first economics paper she wrote.

It was designed by Weaver and Kemp and built from 1810 to 1859. It is also known as Varro Ville and Varra Ville. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Cowpastures When the first fleet arrived in Sydney Cove in 1788 they found the soil unsuitable for farming and soon looked towards the heavy clay and loam soils of the Cumberland Plain (to the west) to sustain the colony. Early agricultural settlements were located on the rich alluvial soils of the Nepean, Hawkesbury and Georges River areas, as well as South Creek near St.Marys and at the head of the Parramatta River where the settlement of Rose Hill (later Parramatta) was established about six months after the fleet landed. A settlement at the Hawkesbury was established in 1794. By 1804 much of the Cumberland Plain had been settled and Governor King began to look for other regions in the colony for favourable arable land. The only suitable land within the Cumberland Plain was the area known as the Cowpastures, located in the southwestern corner. This area was named after the discovery in 1795 of cows from the first fleet which had wandered off into the bush. The Cowpastures had remained unoccupied due to the official decree that reserved the land for the wild cattle (to encourage their increase). In December 1803 Governor and Mrs King visited the Cowpastures for themselves and the Sydney Gazette reported that Mrs King was the first \\"white lady\\" to have crossed the Nepean River. The track to the Cowpastures led from Prospect and on 17 September 1805 James Meehan, under instructions from Governor King, commenced a survey of the track from Prospect to the Nepean Crossing and a rough road followed the marked line. This became known as Cowpasture Road, later the Hume Highway, most of which is today part of the Camden Valley Way. Several visits to the area by the colonial gentry took place at this time, which resulted in their desire to acquire some of this rich land for themselves. They saw the area as containing very good grazing land. Captain Henry Waterhouse described the area in a letter to John Macarthur in 1804 as follows: \\"I am at a loss to describe the face of the country other than as a beautiful park, totally divested of underwood, interspersed with plains, with rich luxuriant grass\\". Earlier Europeans had described \\"large ponds covered with ducks and the black swan, the margins of which were fringed with shrubs of the most delightful tints\\". The Europeans thought the flats were perfect for cattle and the hills would carry sheep. They admired the absence of underbush - probably achieved through Aboriginal burning off - and felt comfortable with a landscape that reminded them of an English gentleman's park. John Macarthur received the first land grant in the Cowpastures region in 1805 for his role in the early wool industry in the colony. Lord Camden rewarded him with and Macarthur chose the highly coveted Cowpastures for his grant, though Governor King tried to prevent him taking it. Macarthur also organised a grant for his friend Walter Davidson, who allowed Macarthur to use his land freely after Davidson returned to England. In this manner Macarthur controlled of riverbank on the site where the wild cattle had first discovered the best pasture near Sydney. Later purchases and exchanges increased the Macarthur land there to over , an endowment that Governor Macquarie greatly resented. Other early grants were in the Parishes of Minto and in adjoining Evan, Bringelly, Narellan and Cook. These all lay west of Parramatta.Godden Mackay Logan, 2012, 20-21 Governor Macquarie drew up plans in 1820 for establishment of a town in the area, to be named Campbelltown after his wife Elizabeth's maiden name. With their forced return to England in 1822 these plans never came to fruition and it was not until the arrival of Governor Darling in 1827 that plans were again reinstated and the first settlers were allowed to take possession of their town land in 1831. In the early 1850s the railway line from Sydney to Goulburn was completed, with a station opening at Campbelltown in 1858. When Leppington House was offered for lease in 1865, one of its selling points was that it was near a railway. Campbelltown now provided easy access to Sydney and its markets and grew as the centre of the district. Although Camden was established in 1836, with no railway line it remained a small town. The large estates that flanked Cowpasture Road (later Camden Valley Way) and the Northern Road were run largely as sheep and cattle farms, with wheat and other grain crops being grown as well until the 1850s. The houses were often built on surrounding ridges or hills, providing sweeping views of the countryside and ensuring that any passing traveller could appreciate the owner's status by viewing their impressive country mansions from the road. This land use pattern of large farm estates and small towns, established in the nineteenth century, remained largely the pattern of development of the area up until the late 1990s. Aerial photographs of the area in 1947 show a rural landscape with some limited urban development on either side of the Camden Valley Way (then the Hume Highway).Godden Mackay Logan, 2012, 22-23 Townson of Varroville Robert Townson was born in Shropshire, developing interests in mineralogy and natural sciences young. Elected a non-resident member or Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1791, Physical class. He graduated M.D. at Gottingen University in 1795. Over 8‚Äì9 years he travelled extensively in Europe, from Trondheim in the north to Sicily, studying mineralogy, chemistry, botany, rural economy, technology, politics and ethics in the Universities of Gottingen, Vienna, Paris and Edinburgh. His \\"Travels in Hungary\\" was published in 1797, his 1798 \\"The Philosophy of Mineralogy\\" and a paper on the \\"perceptivity of Plants\\" was read in 1792 and included in the \\"Transactions\\" of the Linnaean Society.Havard, 2005 In July 1807 Townson (d.1827), doctor of law and gentleman scientist arrived in Sydney. He had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and visited the universities of Copenhagen, Uppsala and Gottingen. In 1792 he contributed a paper to the Linnaean Society of London on the \\"Perceptivity of Plants\\". \\"He was often at the home of Sir Joseph Banks and had there met William Paterson of the New South Wales Corps. His brother, Captain John Townson had served as a military officer in NSW before migrating to the colony as a settler in 1806, so he had ample opportunities to learn about the new settlement. Robert approached the British government for permission to settle in NSW. He was warmly received, informed that he was the type most urgently needed in the colony, promised land and indulgences, and allowed ¬£100 to buy books and a laboratory for the colony. Dr Townson arrived in Sydney in the Young William on 7 July 1807. Proficient in all branches of natural science and also in Latin, Greek, German, French, he was the most eminent scholar in the young colony.\\"ADB Townson arrived as a settler intending to establish himself as a pastoralist and trader in 1807.Everett, 2004 He arrived with the instructions of the British Secretary of State to Governor Bligh to grant him . Bligh refused to \\"locate the grant\\", but allowed him occupancy while awaiting instructions from England, which arrived in a letter of 31 December 1807. He established himself on a small estate of on the banks of the Georges River, living there for about five years, building a residence, stock yard, making and enclosing paddocks and making roads. He called this grant Towweery (Tom Uglys). In January 1808 Townson, affronted at Bligh's delay over the granting of land, became 'an opponent of Bligh, and when rebellion took place some months later he was judged one of the principal six \\"who previously concerted together with Major Johnston the arrest and imprisonment of the Governor\\". He was present at the dinner at the officers' mess on the eve of the trial of John Macarthur which precipitated the revolt [and] he signed the requisition to Johnston to depose Bligh on 26 January 1808' He \\"soon fell out with the rebel administration. Johnston refused to give him the land he wanted at Emu Island, near Penrith; though he was given at Botany Bay near the present Blakehurst and twenty-eight government cattle, he claimed that only half the grant was of any use, and his long complaints against Bligh written in 1807 and 1808 were followed by another, equally querulous, in 1809 against his supplanters.\\" Overlooked in the grants made by Johnston in 1808, he received two grants from Foveaux in November 1808, both in the Botany Bay district, one of , the other of around the present Oatley station, Mortdale, Penshurst and Hurstville.'SHR He had six assigned convicts. In 1809, finding this [Botany Bay] land unsuitable he applied to William Paterson (who took over the government) for some adjacent land, of . Since his land had poor pasture, he was obliged to send his flock away to other ground, and a few months before Macquarie's arrival he asked Paterson to allow him to exchange of his grant for some more open land \\"in a distant part of the colony\\". Paterson allowed him to take up for the , giving him a total of . This he chose was in the Minto district, and was the origin of Varro Ville. James Meehan surveyed Varro Ville in August 1809, mentioning the hill of Bunbury Curran, a range, flats and hollows, hills and dales, ponds and ironbark trees, and the creek. A road was to be reserved on the south-east side. The grant was ready for delivery in November 1809'. 'Townson later confirmed that he had immediately occupied the land, \\"employed a great deal of labour, and expended a great deal of money\\" in building a horse yard, cultivating a large garden, clearing and fencing paddock and making roads.Fowler p. 68 Macquarie on his arrival annulled by public proclamation the trials which had taken place during the usurpation (of Bligh). Grants of land and of stock and leases during the same period were revoked, as well as pardons and emancipations until he could tour all the districts and reconsider the grants. Townson was required to hand in his grants, which he did in 1810. Macquarie re-granted Townson at Bunbury Curran ( at Minto ( at \\"Bunbury Curran\\" as it was called) and Botany Bay were given in May 1811, despite Townson's objections about the amount of land required to be cultivated)), which Townson named Varro Ville after the Roman writer on agriculture, Marcus Terentius Varro (116-27 BC). The stated reason was that Varro wrote extensively on agriculture and Townson was intent on making Varroville an exemplar of agricultural pursuit, which, according to his obituaries and official biography, he achieved. In November 1810 Governor Macquarie toured the area (after having chosen the site of a town on George's River to which he gave the name Liverpool, after the Earl of that title following the foundation of Liverpool, and writes in his journal of 8 November 1810: Macquarie also commented in his journal that the farms of Townson and Andrew Thompson (St. Andrews farm, opposite Varroville) were \\"by far the finest soil and best pasturage I have yet seen in the colony; the grounds are beautiful and bounded by a large creek of brackish water called Bunbury Curran\\". This difference of opinion on siting reflects the different characters of Macquarie and Townson - the former masterful and dashing, would have chosen a prominent site with an extensive view, the latter a scholar, preferring seclusion and proximity to oversight his crops and orchard. Varro was a famous man of letters. Authors like Quintilian considered him \\"the most learned of the Romans\\". He wrote 74 works on 620 papyrus rolls on several subjects, but practically none have survived. His lost \\"On Libraries\\", in which he describes the organisation of a library and gives reasons for defining books as cultural artefacts, is one of the earliest discussions of the subject.Baez, 2008 Since these grants were made on the customary condition that the land be cultivated and not sold for five years, Townson again felt aggrieved. He had been living on his capital for nearly four years and was afraid of penury. He sought permission to sell his land and return to England. In the end he remained but developed a psychopathic personality. He subordinated everything to the development of his farms, shut himself off from society and apparently did no scientific work in New South Wales. He became \\"singular\\" and eccentric and his rigid economy became a byword. He also nursed undue hostility towards all who had contributed to his critical situation; Macquarie described him as \\"discontented\\" and one of his leading opponents, though there is no evidence that Townson took part in intrigues against him'. March 1812 'In March 1812 it would appear that Townson had not yet built his house. \\"This state of uncertainty (over the route of a public road St Andrews road, linking the Liverpool-Campbelltown road with the Cowpasture Road has prevented me from going on with my plans and I am still living, when at Bunbury Curran, in a very uncomfortable manner, as on this road depends where I shall place my house and make my inclosures.Fowler p. 70 After five years at his small grant of at Towweery (Tom Ugly's) on George's River, Townson had relocated to Minto by 1813 and had made the \\"necessary establishment\\" there. He had managed to keep his six convicts for five years on the Government stores (when new settlers were normally allowed men on the stores for only 18 months), gaining extensions from Macquarie in 1810 and 1811. Townson was associated with the development of the Australian wine industry, having been once known as 'the finest orchard in the Colony and a vineyard second only to Gregory Blaxland's' at Brush Farm, Ryde. He made very good use of his grant of at Minto. \\"Black Muscardelle\\" grapes were cultivated and liberally distributed by merchant and viticulturist Robert Campbell. Robert Townson made a \\"passable sweet wine\\" from this grape at Bunbury Curran near 'Campbell-Town'and possibly also grew \\"Black Portugal\\" or 'Oporto'(i.e. Varroville).McIntyre, 2012, Appendix 1, 224-5. In 1815 Townson supplied meat to the Sydney, Liverpool and Parramatta stores. In the 1818 Muster of stock for 1818 \\"Townson had 214 head of horned cattle and 1961 sheep He had twenty-two acres in wheat, eight in maize, four in barley, two in potatoes and two in garden and orchard.\\" Following drought (and the caterpillar plague of 1819) Townson obtained a permit to pasture cattle across the mountains. In May 1821 he sent them south to a run that became Tiranna, Goulburn.JRAHS vol 91 pt 2 p. 188 In October 1820 Townson offered property for sale \\" at Bunbury Curran, with a good house and offices and one of the best gardens in the colony. A great part is fenced in and divided into paddocks\\".See JRAHS vol 91 pt 2 p. 190 for list of stock After Macquarie departed the colony, Townson began to take his rightful place in the community. In 1822 he became a foundation vice-president of the Agricultural Society and a member of its Horticultural and Stock Fund Committees. Varroville became a show place for its beauty, abundance and variety in orchard and garden; his vineyard was second only to that of Gregory Blaxland; his fine-wooled sheep and their clip were in great demand; his cattle were numerous and in the opinion of his contemporaries no single man had accomplished more in the rearing of stock'. Timeline *1823'When the members of the Agricultural Society [of New South Wales] dined after the general Quarterly Meeting in Nash's Inn, Parramatta, at the beginning of 1823 the dessert was contributed from the gardens of Dr Townson and Captain Piper. \\"It consisted of no fewer than 18 kinds of fresh fruit, and 4 of dried; among which were the banana, the Orlean plum, the green gage, the real peach, the cat-head apple, and a peculiarly fine sort of musk melon. \\" 'Next to Gregory Blaxland, Townson was regarded as having 'most successfully and most extensively given his attention to the vine.'JRAHS vol 91 pt 2 p. 198 *1825A notice regarding the theft of grain from Townson's farm mentions a granary.Fowler, 72 *1827Townson died at Varroville on 27 June 1827 and was buried at St John's Cemetery, Parramatta. A bachelor, he left his fortune to his brother, Captain John Townson of Van Diemen's Land, to two nieces residing in England and to his nephew, Captain John Witts, R.N. A portrait, attributed to Augustus Earle is in the Mitchell Library. By the time of his death, Varro Ville had become a show place for its beauty, abundance and variety in orchard and garden: his vineyard was second only to that of Gregory Blaxland (at Brush Farm, Ryde); his fine-wooled sheep and their clip were in great demand; his cattle were numerous and in the opinion of his contemporaries \\"no single man had accomplished more in the rearing of stock\\".ADB, vol.2, 1967 *1829Varroville was acquired by Thomas Spencer Wills (1800-1836), the first Australian born Justice of the Peace and a founder of the Bank of NSW. One of his sisters married Dr William Redfern (1774 - 1833) of nearby Campbellfield, a major landowner in the area, while another married Henry Colden Antill (1779 - 1852) of Jarvisfield, Picton. *1832The New South Wales Calendar and General Post Office Directory 1832 refers to \\"the residence of the late Dr Townson, now the property of Thomas Wills, Esq. This place is celebrated for a Garden and Vinery.\\".Fowler, 75 *Early 1837Varroville was acquired by explorer, Captain Charles Sturt (1795-1869), who \\"described himself as \\"an enthusiastic horticulturalist\\". Writing to his brother William in Calcutta in 1835 when he was planning the purchase of a property, Sturt begged for fruits, plants, bulbs or seeds, \\"the rarer the better\\".\\"Fowler p. 77 Sturt established dams and modified watercourses, maintained the thriving kitchen garden, orchard and vineyard and took a keen interest in the birdlife at Varroville. He later cited Varroville as a model of water conservation during his term as Assistant Commissioner of Lands in South Australia.Mrs Napier George Sturt, Life of Charles Sturt, Elder & Co., London, 1899, 125 *In 1838'On another occasion, in Sturt's second home in Varroville, the powers of native trackers were again called into play. Here in 1838 he was visited by the bird-artist, John Gould, who greatly admired Sturt's large original collection of Australian Psittacidae [parrots] in water-colour, for which he offered on the spot a large sum. But these paintings had been the delight of Sturt's leisure; he was devoted to ornithology and had collected rare specimens at great trouble and risk, and at no price would he part with his folio. It is supposed that Gould's remarks must have drawn the attention of some dishonest workman to the value of the drawings, for soon afterward the military chest in which they were kept disappeared and was never again seen. Natives put upon the scent found military accoutrements and other articles thrown out of the same chest, so that drawings were clearly the object of the theft'Mrs Napier Sturt, 1899, 122 *Sturt in a speech at a dinner in honour of Governor Gawler, 10 January 1840 urged South Australians to store water. 'On my farm at Varroville, until labour and skill were exerted, one only of many channels held water, and that was brackish. When I passed that farm, every paddock had its proper water- hole. In a severe drought I not only fed 180 head of stock on (of which 350 was under cultivation), but I permitted 19 families to supply themselves from my tanks'Mrs Napier Sturt, 1899, p.193 Turner, male convict servant as cook rescued the elder Sturt son from drowning in a pond or dam.Mrs Napier Sturt, 1899, 174 *'But no forethought could avert the widespread ruin from such a drought that prevailed between 1836 and 1839. Not even Sturt's waterholes could satisfy all demands or supplement the failing pasture. His hay-crop in 1838 was better than that of his neighbours. But stock were quite at a discount. Nor could wool be sent to Sydney for want of water by the way. The lines of road were unwholesome from the number of cattle and horses that dropped dead upon them. Just when the farmers of New South Wales were reduced to their lowest ebb their hopes were revived by the new settlement in South Australia.'Mrs Napier Sturt, 1899, 125 *In 1839Sturt's sale notice for the property appeared in the Australian, \\"The cottage is convenient and an excellent kitchen and wash house have been added to it. The outhouses consist of stables, coach house, verandah, dairy, store, barn etc. and there is a well-stocked garden and vineyard\\". 'Sturt apparently sold his uncleared grant [at Ginningdera, [sic] Canberra] at its auction value with the proceeds bought a small but ready- fenced property at Varroville, which on his sudden departure for South Australia in 1839 [to take up the post of Surveyor- General], he was forced to sell at so great a loss that the final outcome of the grant dwindled to less than ¬£450.'Mrs Napier Sturt, 1899, 109 *November 1839Varroville acquired by James Raymond, the first Postmaster General of the Colony of New South Wales. Raymond introduced the world's first pre-paid postage in November 1838, anticipating the British penny postage in 1840. Raymond entertained extensively at Varroville. \\"He was also a keen follower of horse-racing and owned several horses himself.\\" An oil on canvas horse portrait by Edward Winstanley (1820-1849) \\"Nazeer Farrib\\", A High Caste Arab, the property of James Raymond Esq of Varroville is in the State Library of NSW collection (ML282). *Raymond died at Darlinghurst on 29 May 1851 aged 65 and his daughter Aphra (Aphrasia Kemmis) and her family lived rent-free at Varroville according to the terms of his will.Fowler, 85 Raymond featured as the fictional postmaster \\"Raymond Plenty\\" in architect and writer William Hardy Wilson's romance \\"The Cowpasture Road\\", Sydney.Art in Australia, 1920, 38-40 *1858'In 1858 Raymond's sons sold the property to the late George Taylor Rowe, who mortgaged it to H. H. Browne. Browne defaulted on his mortgage during 1859 and Rowe claimed possession of the house.' *27 April 1858Architects, Weaver & Kemp of 160 Pitt Street, Sydney advertise for tenders from masons \\"for laying the Foundations of a House at Varroville, near Campbelltown. Plan and specification, and further particulars may be ascertained on application to the undersigned\\".The Sydney Morning Herald 27 April 1858 William Weaver (1828-) was a former Colonial Architect (1854- April 1856), formerly Edmund Blacket's clerk of works (while Blacket was Colonial Architect) and had trained under Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the Franco-British civil engineer (1806-1859). Weaver & Kemp also designed Jarvisfield, Picton and Burrundulla, Mudgee. The new house was built on the site of the previous house, retaining an early stone chimneypiece (with evidence of a former kitchen crane) and hearthstone from the previous house. The bread oven chimney has been capped before the shingling of the roof above it. *Following Rowe's death Varroville sold to Justice Alfred Cheeke for ¬£4,500. Cheeke (1810-1876) bred and trained race horses at Varroville (including \\"Clove\\" which won the first Australian Jockey Club Derby in 1865), established and maintained a private racecourse on the flat below the house. He was elevated to the Supreme Court of NSW in 1865. An oval form close to today's F5 freeway has been identified in aerial photographs as possibly Cheeke's racetrack. *1876Varroville, the estate of the late Justice Cheeke was advertised for sale by Richardson & Wrench and purchased by grazier M. Suttor. 'Varroville House is a commodious family residence, recently erected by the late proprietor. It is built of brick and stone, is nearly surrounded by verandahs and contains the following accommodation:- hall, 8 feet wide: drawing and dining rooms each 20 x 16: 6 bedrooms, two of which are 20 x 16: dressing room with well- arranged superior bath: patent closet: stove, kitchen with oven, servants hall, wine cellar, laundry with copper, larder, pantry, china closet & c. There is an additional residence of six apartments a few yards from the above. Both are surrounded by tastefully laid out gardens and shrubbery, are erected on a beautiful elevation, and approached by a fine carriage drive from the main road. *An abundant supply of water is obtained from an immense underground reservoir, which receives the roof water. A pump forces the water on to the premises, supplying the bathroom &c.; The outbuildings are very numerous and comprise gardener's house, barn, cow-houses, calf-pens, dairy, piggery with coppers, stock and drafting yards, complete ranges of stabling, including a number of well-finished spacious loose boxes for blood stock.'.Sydney Morning Herald, 15 April 1876 *This house is the third built on the estate.William Weaver-designed, built in partnership with William Kemp, -9 *1885Suttor sold Varroville to Sydney solicitor, Thomas Salter. Salter leased it to H. Pockley for dairying. *1906Salter sold Varroville to Reginald Thomas.Fowler, 87 *1912Thomas sold Varroville to W. H. Staniforth, dairyman of St Andrews. *1923Staniforth leased Varroville to Percy, Austin and Arthur Smith (Smith Bros), dairymen of Concord. They operated dairies at Robin Hood Farm (Ingleburn, also NSW State Heritage Register-listed) and Varroville until 1958, running their own dairy herd and purchasing milk from local farmers'.Liston, 107. *1929George Smith purchased Varroville. Varroville was subsequently owned by Robert Stanley Thompson. *In 1950Thompson sold the property to grazier, William Forest Ross who sold it to former engineer and owner of Gatwick Airport in England, and former RAF 601 Squadron (Auxiliary) member, Alfred L M (Morris) and wife Cherry Jackaman (1911-2011). Changes made by the Jackamans include enlarging the drawing room (to the former footprint of the northern veranda and extending the terrace on this side), relocating the access to the cellar, building the colonnade at the western end of the courtyard (on the site of a picket fence), installing the fountain against the northern range wall, building the swimming pool, change rooms, gazebo and \\"crazy paving\\" the surrounds of these. The old back drive from St Andrew's Road became the principal entry. *In 1960Cherry Jackaman joined Dame Helen Blaxland on the Women's Committee of the National Trust (NSW). Jackaman chaired this committee from 1964‚Äì67 and by 1968 had raised more than $100,000, which was directed to Experiment Farm Cottage, Lindesay and the St. Matthews Anglican Church at Windsor Appeal. She also presided over the initiation of house inspections designed to recognise important heritage properties within NSW and pioneered discounting of building supplies for restoring listed properties.McGuiness, 23‚Äì24 September 2011. *1964the Jackamans opened Varroville as part of house inspections by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) Women's Committee (another opening was held in 1968). The tour brochures indicated the Jackamans considered the house to predate the 1850s, with the verandas and marble chimneypieces described as later additions. Mrs Jackaman's guests included her friend, the British actress Vivienne Leigh, Sir Laurence Olivier and Princess Michael of Kent. *Cherry Jackaman resumed the chair of the Women's Committee of the National Trust (NSW) in 1970 for three years and was elected unopposed as the first female president of the National Trust of Australia (NSW) in 1977, a position she held until 1981. In the early 1970s the house lot was subdivided from its context onto . The date of subdivision of the land occupied by Sweeney's Riding Ranch from land owned by the Jackaman family is unknown. *In 1973the Campbelltown Local Environmental Plan's zoning of this section (Central Hills) of what has become known as its \\"Scenic Hills\\" was zoned, predominantly in the case of Varroville's setting, 7d1 - Environment Protection - Scenic, some zoned 6c - Open Space (Regional). *In the 1980sland was resumed from the estate for the M5 freeway. *In 1990Mrs Jackaman presented Varroville homestead and (i.e. without its outbuildings) to the National Trust of Australia (NSW). *In 1991the property was sold to fund National Trust of Australia (NSW) debt. *In 1992The National Trust (NSW) commissioned a conservation plan for Varroville from architects, Orwell and Peter Phillips and sold Varroville to architects, Keith and Virginia Pearson- Smith.Carlin, 2007 *2002Varroville was acquired by John Moutsopoulos and Vanessa Seary. *2006Varroville was acquired by Peter Gibbs and Jacqui Kirkby. *May 2007The Cornish Group acquired approximately adjoining and surrounding Varroville from Mrs Jackaman's daughters. Prior to this the Cornish Group were reported to have taken out an option to buy the adjoining Sweeney's Scenic Riding Ranch (not owned by the Jackaman family), giving them approximately of the original of Robert Townson's 1810 estate. *In 2009Cherry Jackaman was awarded the OAM. Morris died in 1980, Cherry moving to Double Bay.  Description  Estate and setting The approach to the siting of Varroville which avoided the house being silhouetted against the sky was endorsed by the horticulturalist and landscape designer, Thomas Shepherd (1776-1836, probably citing the British landscape architect Humphry Repton) when describing the siting of Elizabeth Bay House, Sydney, and later discussed by British writer on estate planning, John Claudius Loudon (1773-1843) whose writings were influential in colonial New South Wales. Varroville is oriented east-west, taking advantage of vistas to other Cumberland Plain homesteads, Denham Court and Macquarie Field House. The locally named Scenic Hills describe the picturesque rolling country selected as the location of the Varroville grant. Garden In the immediate surrounds of the house, the gravelled carriage drive, lawn tennis court site, remains of a glasshouse and plantings are elements of a substantially intact mid-19th century garden plan. The carriage loop (with concrete edgings remaining from the Jackaman period: (1950-1990)) appears to relate to the 1858 house. It does not connect with the drive that passes in front of it to the east, but this \\"disconnection\\" may relate to Jackaman period changes. Perimeter fence lines and gates have been relocated during the Jackaman period. Hardy Wilson described \\"Varraville\\" [sic] as \\"an Early-Victorian homestead encompassed by many oleanders\\". The garden contains staples of Cumberland Plain gardening - Moreton Bay figs (Ficus macrophylla), hoop pines (Araucaria cunninghamii) funeral cypresses (Chamaecyparis funebris) (particularly along the back drive), white cedars (Melia azederach var. australasica), pepper trees (Schinus molle var. areira), coral trees (Erythrina sp., probably E.indica or E.x sykesii),Read, S., pers.comm. a Norfolk Island hibiscus /white oak (Lagunaria patersonae), orchid tree (Bauhinia variegata), century plants/agaves (A.americana) (the stretch of original drive in front of the house is a forest of these), Spanish bayonets/Adam's needles (Yucca sp.), aloes (A.sp.) and hedges of Cape honeysuckle/tecoma (Tecomaria capensis) and common African olive (Olea europaea var. africana). The kitchen garden laid out in 1809 and described in Sturt's 1839 sale advertisement may have occupied sloping ground to the north - west of the house.Carlin, 2007 with botanic names added by Stuart Read, 22 December 2008 The oldest colonial plantings appear to be located in the tennis court area east of the house, which is supports the current owners' view that this is the most likely site of the second house on the property (built by Townson and lived in by Sturt and Raymond). Landscape architect Geoffrey Britton advises that Varroville's Indian shot/ Canna lily is the species plant (C.indica) and that was located en masse on the far slope of what is now a herbaceous border on the southern bank above the tennis court. Geoffrey also considers that the Cypress located on the entrance there is very old. Aside from the figs and hoop pines and re-seeded white cedars, the rest of the garden is largely of the Jackaman era planted out in the 1950s and early 1960s. C.japonica on site is likely also to be remnant progeny of an early colonial planting as there are many in the tennis court area, along with cotoneasters. Cotoneasters could have been put there by the Jackamans, as Cherry Jackaman apparently had cotoneasters espaliered down the northern side of the house (removed by later owners).Kirkby, J., pers.comm., 22 December 2008 edited by Stuart Read There are two arbors in the garden - an old arbour with an enormous Banksia rose (Rosa banksia 'Lutea') which was replaced by the previous owners and a second arbour (with an old jasmine (Jasminium sp.) and wisteria (W.sinensis) is now propped up with iron bars.Kirkby, J., edited by Stuart Read, 14 January 2009 Outbuildings The outbuildings may date from (Macquarie's visit); 1813 (Townson's move to the property); or later. These include a coach house. The buildings may lie outside SHR boundary to the east. House Varroville, occupying the site of a previous s house has important relationships with features associated with the Townson, Wills and Sturt periods of ownership and occupancy of the estate (1810-1839) - the original driveway from Campbelltown Road, outbuildings grouped in relation to the entrance drive on the ridge to the southern side of the house, the remnant vineyard terracing that wraps around the hillside in view of the house, a track to Bunbury Curran Hill, post and rail fences and dams and modified watercourses believed to have been made by the explorer, Charles Sturt. The house occupies a narrow ridge (or saddle) on the south side of Bunbury Curran Hill, a landmark that led Townson to refer to Varroville as his property at \\"Bunbury Curran\\". Bunbury Curran Hill was climbed by Governor and Mrs Macquarie in November 1810 to take advantage of views across the Cumberland Plain to Sydney. The hill, clad in bush, has evidently played a significant role in the landscape design of Varroville, providing a dramatic backdrop to the house when approached from the south. The landscape design of Varroville was discussed between Townson and the Macquaries in 1810. Varroville House is a substantial single-storey symmetrical rendered brick house in a \\"U\\" shape with two rear wings on a stone foundation by the architects, Weaver and Kemp and dating from 1858-9. Its room uses are known from an 1876 sale advertisement. The fabric of the house is intact with surviving blackbutt floors, cedar joinery, plaster ceiling roses and imported marble chimneypieces. The roof, originally shingled, is now covered with corrugated iron. The house appears to occupy the site of a previous (1810s) house and the kitchen of the northern wing incorporates the sandstone chimneypiece of a previous service wing (one of the uprights of the chimneypiece has a void for the hinging of an iron kitchen crane). A large underground water tank extends westwards from the ends of the wings of the house.Carlin, 2007, amended Read, Stuart, 22/ December 2008  Condition  As at 8 August 2007, the fabric of the house is intact with surviving blackbutt floors, cedar joinery, plaster ceiling roses and imported marble chimneypieces. The roof, originally shingled, is now covered with corrugated iron.  Modifications and dates  The house appears to occupy the site of a previous (1810s) house and the kitchen of the northern wing incorporates the sandstone chimneypiece of a previous service wing (one of the uprights of the chimneypiece has a void for the hinging of an iron kitchen crane). The oldest colonial plantings appear to be located in the tennis court area east of the house, which is supports the current owners' view that this is the most likely site of the second house on the property (built by Townson and lived in by Sturt and Raymond). Aside from the figs and hoop pines and re-seeded white cedars, the rest of the garden is largely of the Jackaman era planted out in the 1950s and early 1960s. C.japonica on site is likely also to be remnant progeny of an early colonial planting as there are many in the tennis court area. *1950-90The Jackamans made many changes, including enlarging the drawing room (to the former footprint of the northern veranda and extending the terrace on this side), relocating the access to the cellar, building the colonnade at the western end of the courtyard (on the site of a picket fence), installing the fountain against the northern range wall, building the swimming pool, change rooms, gazebo and \\"crazy paving\\" the surrounds of these. The old back drive from St Andrew's Road became the principal entry. The verandah surface was paved in concrete. Perimeter fence lines and gates were relocated. The carriage loop (with concrete edgings remaining from the Jackaman period (1950-1990)) appears to relate to the 1858 house. It does not connect with the drive that passes in front of it to the east, but this \\"disconnection\\" may relate to Jackaman period changes. Perimeter fence lines and gates were relocated. The majority of the garden is largely of this era, planted out in the 1950s and early 1960s. In the tennis court area are many cotoneasters - which could have been planted by the Jackamans, as Cherry Jackaman had cotoneasters espaliered down the northern side of the house (removed by later owners). *Date unknown: roof, originally shingled, is now covered with corrugated iron *-Pearson-Smith ownership period. Various conservation, reinstatement/repair works done. *The older of the two arbors in the garden was replaced by the then owners, the Pearson-Smiths. It has an enormous Banksia rose (Rosa banksiae 'Lutea') and in late 2008 fell down under the weight of the bush. *2002-05SHR-listed land was fenced off from the surrounding land (rural fencing); security system installed and new brass locks to windows and doors; floors of main rooms sanded and polished; wall-to-wall carpets removed from all bedrooms revealing poor state of floors in wings; sandstone removed from Jackaman era walled garden - possibly used in new sandstone steps along rear of courtyard; front verandah re-laid (not in original form); new modern sandstone verandah installed on north-western side of house outside drawing room extension; extensive removal of overgrowth in garden; removal of old garden plantings adjacent to house and pool - possibly to allow cleaning and relaying of stonework and pool works; Jackaman era pond to front of house and the courtyard's \\"crazy paving\\" partially removed (incomplete resolution). *2006-07Minor garden changes, removing a lot of overgrown lantana (L.camara) to reveal former layout and form. New perennial and shrub plantings around house, former tennis court and western garden. Removal of Jackaman-era trees against house that were dying, including large Chinese elm from courtyard, the roots of which had penetrated the cellar.

The couourtyard has yet to be restored.  Further information  The land falls under Campbelltown Local Environmental Plan (LEP) District 8 - (Central Hills Lands) - the majority is zoned 7(d1) (Environmental Protection - Scenic); the remainder zoned 6c (Open Space - Regional).  Heritage listing  As at 21 May 2007, 'Varroville is a 'celebrated early farm estate dating from 1810 with early structures, the 1850s homestead, layout, agricultural (vineyard) terracing and evidence of early access road.'Morris and Britton, 2000, 98 'Varroville is rare as one of the few larger estate landscapes remaining in the Campbelltown area where the form of the original grant and the former agricultural use of the estate and its rural landscape character may be appreciated.' Varroville was a significant to the horticultural development of New South Wales through the laying out of a productive kitchen garden in 1809 noted for its extensive fruit varieties by the early 1820s and the establishment of a vineyard, said to be second only to that of Gregory Blaxland of Brush Farm, Eastwood. The vineyard terraces are extant and together with the early drive suggest that the present 1858 house occupies the site of the earlier 1810s house. Accounts relating to Charles Sturt's ownership (1837‚Äì39) indicate the property's continued role in the acclimatisation of plants sourced from as far afield as Calcutta. Varroville was significant to agriculture and food production in early New South Wales. The grants of land at Minto were made by Colonel Paterson in response to the Hawkesbury floods of 1806 and later, aiming to safeguard the colony's food supplies. A significant portion of Varroville was used for growing crops in the c. 1810s-1830s period. Townson supplied meat to the Sydney, Liverpool and Parramatta commissariat stores. Macquarie commented that the farms of Townson and Andrew Thompson (St. Andrews, opposite Varroville) were \\"by far the best pasturage I have yet seen in the colony\\". The gently rolling hills of the two properties appealed to English Picturesque sensibilities and today is reflected in the locality name, Scenic Hills, defined under the Campbelltown Local Environment Plan - District 8 (Central Hills Lands). This plan aims 'to ensure that the Central Hills Lands District of the City of Campbelltown retains the rural character that was envisaged for it during the planning that preceded the urbanisation of that City.' 'The still appreciable direct viewline from the 1850s Varroville homestead to the landmark Araucarias of both nearby Denham Court and Macquarie Fields House appears to be a deliberate siting intention.'. Varroville house is sited as \\"a house in landscape\\" according to estate planning principles put forward by British landscape designers Humphrey Repton in the 1790s-1810s (echoed by the Sydney-based horticulturalist and landscape designer, Thomas Shepherd in the 1830s) and John Claudius Loudon in the 1820s-40s. The house is sited to take advantage of sweeping, wrap-around views of the scenic hills from Raby Road in the west to Bunbury Curran Hill in the north and to an extending ridgeline of the range to the east. The important western view dominates the entry through the front door and across the rear courtyard. Varroville, through the Sturt dams and modified watercourses, accounts from the Sturt period and the large underground water tank c. 1858 that extends westwards from the ends of the wings of the house illustrates early recognition of the importance of water conservation to colonists in New South Wales and South Australia. Sturt's accounts relate to the great drought of the 1830s that led to the depression of the early 1840s that was devastating to early NSW society. Varroville is significant for the relationship between the house and its group of farm buildings, sited in relation to each other on the ridge. The location of the outbuildings along the entrance drive reflect Augustus Earle's c. 1829 watercolour view of Lieut William Lawson's Veteran Hall, Prospect (National Library of Australia) and Mrs Charles Meredith's description of Homebush in the 1840s with barns, stables and estate worker's cottages and other \\"ornamental edifices\\" being visible en route to the house (although not through the front door as Mrs Meredith complained of Homebush). Both Veteran Hall and Homebush have since been demolished. The house dating from 1858-9 is a significant example of the work of William Weaver, former Government Architect 1854-56. The firm, Weaver and Kemp, also designed Jarvisfield, Picton and Burundulla, Mudgee. The fabric of the house is intact with surviving blackbutt floors, cedar joinery, plaster ceiling roses and imported marble chimneypieces. The roof, originally shingled, is now covered with corrugated iron. The house appears to occupy the site of a previous (1810s) house and the kitchen of the northern wing incorporates the sandstone chimneypiece of a previous service wing. With the exception of generously scaled rooms and plate glass windows (allowing maximum light and taking in of the views), the symmetrical Italianate villa is architecturally conservative (and comparable with houses such as Yasmar, Haberfield, designed by John Bibb in c. 1852). This, and the large underground watertank at the end of the wings may reflect Weaver's engineering (rather than architectural) training. The garden immediately surrounding the house is a substantially intact mid-19th century plan with a gravelled carriage drive (with post-1950 concrete edgings), lawn tennis court site c. 1870?, remains of a glasshouse and a trellis. Perimeter fence lines and gates have been relocated post 1950 but the original locations are well documented in photographs of c. 1935. Hardy Wilson described \\"Varraville\\" [sic] as \\"an Early-Victorian homestead encompassed by many oleanders\\". The pink oleander at the north-east corner of the house was extant in 1950 (information from Mrs Jackaman) and may have been one of the oleanders described by Hardy Wilson. The garden contains staples of Cumberland Plain gardening: Moreton Bay figs, hoop pines, funeral cypresses, white cedars, pepper trees, a Norfolk Island hibiscus, Bauhinia, agaves (bordering the original drive), yuccas, aloes and hedges of cape honeysuckle (Tecomaria capensis) and common olive. The Queensland rain forest tree, Barclaya syringifolia, may survive from the c. 1890s - 1910 period. Varroville received important early 20th century literary and artistic recognition as a major homestead of the Cumberland Plain through its inclusion on the parchment map that provides the key to W. Hardy Wilson's romance, \\"The Cowpasture Road\\" (1920). The fictional postmaster, Raymond Plenty in The Cowpasture Road (pp 38‚Äì40) is no doubt inspired by James Raymond, owner of Varroville 1839-1851, and the reference to the squires having chased Governor Bligh under his bed (p. 8) may be a reference to Townson. Varroville is 'historically important for its association with prominent owners Dr Robert Townson, Charles Sturt, James Raymond and Alfred Cheeke and for its relationship with Bunbury Curran Hill - a viewing point used by both Governor and Mrs Macquarie.'Morris and Britton, 2000 p. 19 Varroville during the Raymond, Cheeke and Jackaman periods was a prestigious country estate for owners whose wealth came from other sources. Between c. 1876 and 1950 the property was operated as a dairy, and was representative of rural industry in the Campbelltown area. The property presently retains its rural character. Varroville was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Varroville has historic significance for its association with Robert Townson, the colony's most highly regarded academic when he arrived as a settler intending to establish himself as a pastoralist and trader in 1807, and with the development of the Australian wine industry, having been once known as 'the finest orchard in the Colony and a vineyard second only to Gregory Blaxland's' (at Brush Farm, Ryde). Townson was granted 1000 acres at Minto and made very good use of it. Governor Macquarie was very impressed when he visited Varroville on his first inspection of the interior in 1810.

Background Most of the Jews in Topoƒæƒçany, Slovakia were killed in the Holocaust, which was perpetrated jointly by the collaborationist Slovak State and Nazi Germany. A few hundred survived and returned to the town after the war. Their efforts to regain property that had been \\"aryanized\\" increased the hostility and antisemitism of the non-Jewish Slovaks, who began to mount a campaign of intimidation to encourage the Jews to renounce their claims and leave the country. More than 40 Jews were injured in a September 1945 riot, referred to as the Topoƒæƒçany pogrom, which became the best known instance of postwar anti-Jewish violence in Slovakia. In the years following the riot, many Jews emigrated. There is no longer a Jewish community in Topoƒæƒçany. Censored statement During the filming of the documentary, an elderly resident of Topoƒæƒçany said, \\"Jews and Gypsies are the worst scum under the sun. While they are in the world, there will be no order\\". , the director- general of STV, which had commissioned the documentary, asked Hudec to remove the statement because of concern that it violated the Broadcasting and Retransmission Act on protection of human dignity and humanity. Hudec disagreed and strongly objected, telling reporters that without the line, the film would be a study of past racism in Slovakia, but that the inclusion of the statement brought the historical issues into the present. Despite the general agreement of several lawyers that the statement did not violate the law, the station insisted on its removal. The Central Federation of Jewish Religious Congregations condemned the removal of the statement, stating that the censorship was a \\"warning signal about the present direction of the Slovak public TV\\". It raised concerns about Rybn√≠ƒçek's connections with far-right groups. In response, a manager of STV stated that \\"We would not like this problem to be politicised in any way.\\" Documentary The documentary was aired on Slovak television on 24 May 2004. Its release had been delayed 24 hours due to the controversy over the removed statement and the director's request for time to consider the removal request. Reception Slovak historian Ivan Kamenec praised the documentary for bringing the postwar Jewish history to the attention of a wider audience. The Slovak newspaper said that the documentary was probably the best Slovak documentary to premiere in 2004. Some commentators accused the documentary of anti-Catholicism, pointing out that the church in Topoƒæƒçany is the main visual focus, and the documentary did not mention that some Catholic Church officials opposed the Holocaust. The Slovak writer Peter Bielik criticized the film, citing contemporary reports claiming that \\"the Jews behaved very arrogantly and imperiously, trying to systematically occupy important positions in the economic, public, and political spheres\\". Because of the controversy over these remarks, he withdrew from consideration for director of the National Memory Institute.

It travels along the northern edge of town before having an intersection with SR 211 (Old US 51), just northeast of downtown, before leaving Newbern and continuing east through farmland and rural areas to cross into Gibson County. Gibson County SR 77 passes through Yorkville, where it has an intersection with SR 188 before passing through the community of Hopewell to enter Dyer. SR 77 then has an interchange with US 45W (SR 5), which it becomes concurrent with, while the road continues east into downtown as SR 185. They go southeast as a 4-lane divided highway to leave Dyer and enter Trenton, where they have an intersection with SR 367 (Old US 45W). The highway then narrows to 2-lanes as it bypasses Trenton on its eastern side, where SR 54 joins the concurrency. They then cross a bridge over the North Fork of the Forked Deer River and come to an intersection with SR 104, where SR 77 leaves US 45W/SR 5/SR 54 to have an unsigned concurrency with SR 104, with SR 77 being the one that is signed.

It was built from 1835 to 1846 by Cornelius O'Brien, Duncan Cameron, John Kennedy Hume, Ellen Hume; Mansfield Brothers (1884 works). It is also known as Summer Hill; Summer Hill Estate. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Early land grants and occupation (1811-1835) The modern community of Appin celebrated the bicentenary of European settlement in May 2011, taking its foundation date as 1811 from the first land grants given to European settlers: given to Acting Commissary William Broughton (Lachlan Vale) and to Broughton's brother-in-law John Kennedy (Teston), both grants dated 22 May 1811. Four further grants were made on 25 August 1812: to Alexander Riley (Elladale); to Reuben Uther (Mount Gilead); to Andrew Hamilton Hume; and to George Best. Riley, Uther and Hume were all free settlers and Hume was connected by marriage to both Broughton and Kennedy. George Best was a former convict.State Records of NSW: Registers of Land Grants and Leases 1792-1867 By 1813 there was an established farming community at Appin. When a subscription was taken up at Liverpool in July of that year to support the building of a courthouse at Sydney, 14 of the 81 subscribers were listed as residents of Appin. These residents were a mixture of free arrivals, former soldiers and former convicts.Anne-Maree Whitaker, Appin: the story of a Macquarie town, Kingsclear Books, 2005 Several small grants to former convicts were issued in the next few years. Large landholders like William Broughton and Alexander Riley received additional large grants in 1816-1817 and both John Kennedy and Andrew Hamilton Hume received smaller additional grants in 1816. Hume's eldest son, Hamilton Hume, also received land in that year. The four original Crown grants which today comprise the historic property known as Beulah were promised between 1814 and 1820. These four grants became parish portions 71, 77, 78 and 79, with the farmhouse now called Beulah built on portion 78 (Parish of Menangle (formerly Manangle). Portion 78, , was granted to an Irish convict named Connor, or Cornelius, Bryan [Brien] from Clonmel, County Tipperary, transported for life on the Atlas 2 in 1802, aged 34. By 1806 he was assigned to Lieutenant William Minchin of the NSW Corps. [Minchin was also from Tipperary]. In June 1809 Bryan received a Conditional Pardon from Lieutenant-Governor William Paterson, acting governor of NSW in the wake of the arrest of Governor William Bligh in 1808. Bryan was obliged to surrender his Conditional Pardon in February 1810 following the arrival of the new governor, Lachlan Macquarie. In February 1810 he petitioned for its confirmation, declaring that he had spent most of his sentence in New South Wales as a servant of the government, and describing himself as an aged man who had left a wife and six children in Ireland to bewail his absence. He eventually received an Absolute Pardon in February 1812. By 1814 Bryan was living at Liverpool where, from May that year, he had the services of assigned servant, Connor Boland, another Irish convict, newly arrived in New South Wales. Bryan's name was on a list of persons permitted by Governor Macquarie to become free settlers and to receive a grant of land in 1814. He was recommended for , the standard grant for a single man with no dependants.SRNSW: Musters and other papers re convict ships reel 2417; Musters of NSW and Norfolk Island 1806Colonial Secretary's correspondence 4/ 1846; 4/4486; 9/2652General Muster of NSW 1814 Portion 79, , was promised to Patrick Pendergast [Pendergrass/Prendergast] in January 1816. Pendergast was also Irish, from County Sligo, transported for life on the Britannia in 1797. He was allocated in acknowledgement of his status as a married man.Barbara Hall Death or liberty : the convicts of the Britannia : Ireland to Botany Bay 1797, B. Hall, Coogee, 2006SRNSW: Colonial Secretary's correspondence (CSC) 9/2652). Portion 71, , was promised to a Second Fleet convict named Henry Sears [Sayers/Seers] in September 1818.Michael Flynn The Second Fleet : Britain's grim convict armada of 1790, Library of Australian History, Sydney, 2001SRNSW: CSC 9/2652 Portion 77, , was granted to 18 year old colonial-born Francis Rawdon Hume, youngest son of Andrew Hume of Hume Mount, Appin. Hume jnr petitioned for land in May 1820, his petition supported by the local magistrates who declared him to be 'an honest, sober and most industrious young man.SRNSW: CSC 4/1824A As shown on the original crown grant, Hume called his property Humewood. Although none of these grants were formalised by an actual delivery of deeds until 1823, Bryan and Pendergast were almost certainly in occupation of their land by sometime in 1816 when both men supplied quantities of fresh meat to government stores.Sydney Gazette 25 May 1816; Governor Macquarie signed an order for Hume's grant on 31 March 1821 [SRNSW: CSC re land 2/7886]. Deputy Surveyor James Meehan's formal survey of the grants also seems to post-date occupation. Meehan's survey notebook has an entry for 6 February 1817 recording the marking out of for \\"Pat Pendergast\\" and an unspecified number of acres for \\"Cornelius Bryan\\".SRNSW: Reel 2623 SZ 906 no.88. The original entry is in pencil and has been overwritten in ink, at a later date, as 6 February 1819. The pencil may read 1817 When the grants were issued on 30 June 1823 Bryan's grant was recorded as . In September 1831 both Bryan's and Pendergast's grants were re-gazetted, during a period in which Surveyor-General Mitchell had decided to tidy up paperwork around lands, presumably on the assumption that these grants had never been issued. It was in this second issue of the grant that Bryan's name was transmuted to Cornelius Ryan, an error that has led earlier historians of Beulah to misidentify the original grantee of this parcel of land and lose the thread of the history of the land ownership.Sydney Gazette 17 September 1831; NSW L&PI; :Serial 30 p.21 The Irish story By 1831 Connor Bryan had long since left the colony, the first to return home in what became a rite of passage for a series of Irishmen associated with Beulah. This aspect of Beulah's history is a challenge to the orthodoxy around Irish convicts in Australia: the assumption that they were literally transported for life. In April 1817 'Cornelius O'Bryan' announced in the Sydney Gazette that he was \\"leaving by an early opportunity\\" and requested all claims to be presented forthwith. On 26 November 1817, on the eve of his departure, he had a Letter of Attorney drawn up, giving authority to his assigned servant Connor Boland and to a man named Thomas Connell to cultivate his farm during his absence. In this document Bryan refers to his \\"thirty acres\\", declaring that it had been marked out for him by Mr James Meehan and that he had already cleared 16 acres. Boland was to collect the deeds from the Colonial Secretary's Office when they were ready and he and Connell were to look after Bryan's interests in any way they thought proper and deliver up the farm to him on his return to the colony. He sailed for London on the Harriet in December 1817.Sydney Gazette 5 April 1817.Sydney Gazette 8 November 1817.NSW LPI: Old Systems Book 7 no. 217 & original deed held in Caroline Simpson Library & Research Collection.SRNSW: Ships Musters Reel 561 4/4771 no.43 Thomas Connell was one of Connor Bryan's shipmates on the Atlas 2 and also from Clonmel in County Tipperary. He was younger than Bryan, aged 19 when he was convicted and transported for life. In 1817 he petitioned for a mitigation of sentence and was granted a Conditional Pardon.SRNSW: Musters and other papers re convict ships reel 2417.SRNSW: CSC 4/1850. Boland's name is variously spelled: Bowlan, Bolan, Bowling, Boylan. Connor, or Cornelius, Boland was assigned to Connor Bryan soon after his arrival in New South Wales. He had been tried in County Galway in March 1813, sentenced to life for uttering forged notes, along with a man named Denis O'Brien. They were both labourers from County Clare, Boland aged 28 and his mate aged 26. They were transported on the Three Bees, arriving in Sydney in May 1814 and sent straight to Liverpool for distribution: Denis O'Brien assigned to a man called William Day and Boland assigned to Connor Bryan.SRNSW: Convict indents 4/4404.CSC 4/3493. O'Brien's surname is variously spelled Bryan, Brian and O'Brien. Assignment to Bryan was a lucky break for Boland. The accumulated evidence of many small references - in colonial newspapers, census returns and in the NSW CSC - suggest that Boland was a man of energy and ambition. Not ambition for political or public office but an ambition to prosper. For Boland, Bryan's power of attorney was a catalyst for an entrepreneurial colonial career. Within weeks of Bryan's departure Boland petitioned for a Ticket of Leave and in July 1820 he and Denis O'Brien both received conditional pardons on the recommendation of Captain Francis Allman of the 48th Regiment. Allman, it seems, knew them both in Ireland, O'Brien from his childhood. Boland had been an Allman family servant in Ireland.SRNSW: CSC 4/1862; 4/4430 In August 1820 Boland made his first land purchase, buying the grant adjoining Connor Bryan's grant to the north, the land originally granted to Henry Sears (portion 71). Sears had sold his grant to one Thomas Colligan in February 1819 and Boland purchased the property from Colligan (Original deeds, unregistered, in collection of Caroline Simpson Library & Research Collection). In November 1822 both Boland and O'Brien petitioned for \\"a grant of land and a few cattle\\", each \\"having a few of his own\\", and in August 1823, again in concert, they sought land to depasture their cattle. Their petitions were endorsed by Francis Allman and they were both given permission to select on Tickets of Occupation. By January 1824 Boland had selected an unoccupied spot of forest called Ferrah [Fairy] Meadow in the Illawarra. O'Brien had chosen a tract of land at Illawarra called \\"Bullseye\\" lying under a mountain. Boland's cattle were branded on the off hip with the letters CB and were to be placed under the charge of an Irish convict named Patrick Teefy [Teafy] who had arrived per the ship Brampton in 1823. O'Brien's cattle were marked DB.CB on the off hip - and also under the charge of Patrick Teefy.SRNSW: CSC 4/1834A.4/3509.4/3510.4/1836A. Around this time Denis O'Brien bought Patrick Pendergast's grant, adjoining Connor Bryan's grant on the west (portion 79). Pendergast had sold his grant to Sydney merchant Daniel Cooper in July 1822.NSW LPI: Old Systems Book 8 no.536.Book L no.208 Between them Boland and O'Brien had at Appin and in June 1824 they again petitioned for a grant of land, again in identical terms, again endorsed by Allman. They each declared that they had been able to purchase a few acres of land, which they had been busy cultivating and had secured through their industry and perseverance some cattle and horses, but the small amount of land now occupied by each was \\"much too limited\\" to allow them to maintain themselves by cultivation and to support the stock in their possession. They were each promised . But Boland clearly had hoped for a larger grant and a few months later he submitted another memorial declaring that his purchased farm at Appin was too small and that he had the means to cultivate a large farm. He had 4 assigned convicts, Patrick Teefy being one of them, as well as a man named John Teefy. Boland was allowed an additional .SRNSW: CSC 4/1836A.4/1836B; 4/3511.General Muster List of NSW 1823, 1824,1825 But far from sitting quietly at home in Appin, cultivating his small farm, Boland was moving around the colony, dealing in cattle and horses. He was, for example, at Port Macquarie in September 1823. Captain Francis Allman was Commandant at Port Macquarie at that time and Boland was almost certainly exploiting his connection to Allman, a man with a reputation for sympathy for his fellow humanity, \\"always anxious to encourage the enterprising, and reward the industrious\\".Sydney Gazette, 25 February 1826.The Monitor, 24 December 1827. In December 1824 Allman was appointed commandant at Newcastle, becoming magistrate there in 1826. He was also a substantial landowner in the Hunter by 1825 and in early 1827 resigned his civil appointment to become a full-time settler on a property called Rathluba at Wallis Plains (Maitland), while maintaining other property interests at Muswellbrook, including a property called Overton. Boland turned up there too. Years later Allman declared that he had kept Boland's cattle and horses on his estate on the Hunter and that he had subsidized Boland's stockbreeding, paying for the services of entire horses for the many mares kept by Boland on Allman's farm.SRNSW: CSC 2/7986.4/2660.3.Entry for Francis Allman in ADB online. It seems likely that Boland had delegated his interests at Appin and Illawarra to his assigned servants and his shipmate Denis O'Brien while he was building up his holdings of cattle and horses in the Hunter. Thomas Connell might also have been working for Boland at Appin at this time. Boland travelled between Appin and the Hunter in the late 1820s. He wrote from Appin to the Colonial Secretary in September 1826, applying for an additional grant of land but he was probably back in the Hunter in 1827 when a \\"Return of Government servants left by themselves without any overseer or other person to superintend them in the District of Illawarra\\" lists Boland's name in relation to two men, John Moran and Patrick Teefy. Teefy, it seems, had been \\"a considerable time without any overseer, now about at some other place with cattle but is to return\\".SRSW: CSC 2/7805.4/1922 The November 1828 census shows both Boland and Patrick Teefy together with Allman at the Hunter, Boland listed as an overseer for Allman, possibly at Overton, while Patrick Teefy was listed as a stockman at Rathluba. Denis O'Brien is shown in the November 1828 census at Appin with four assigned servants including John Teefy. It seems reasonable to assume that he was also looking after both his and Boland's interests in the Illawarra. Thomas Connell had left Appin by 1828 and gone down to the Goulburn Plains, like many of the free settlers from Appin. There is evidence of a strong network of patronage and obligation operating between Boland, the Irish convicts associated with him, and Captain Francis Allman. In January 1830 Boland's former assigned servant Patrick Teefy, sentence expired, wrote to the Colonial Secretary asking for land. He made the interesting claim that he has spent the entire period of his deportation working for Francis Allman. Allman endorsed his petition saying that Teefy has been in charge of his cattle for several years. Teefy has also managed to get together ¬£150 in cash which he had deposited in the hands of Allman. Although Teefy waxed lyrical (or maudlin) in his petition ? claiming that he had \\"arrived at the middle standard of life with an increasing desire to honestly and industriously exert himself to enable his heavy charge of a wife and 7 children to join and give effect to his labours in the Colony for the good of his neglected offspring; enabling them to cooperate with him in adopting this country as their future abode in the path of honesty and as dutiful and faithful citizens\\" ? his plea fell on deaf ears. Twelve months later both Patrick Teefy and John Teefy left the colony in a ship called the Nancy.SRSW: CSC 2/7986.Sydney Gazette, 15 February 1831. Two more Irishmen with associations to Beulah who had managed to find the means to return home. Boland, still at Maitland in 1831, asked for a town grant, declaring that he was engaged in farming and agricultural pursuits, and wished to build a house for occasional residence. He had the means, ¬£1,000 in cash, as well as land and stock. His request was unsuccessful and he left the Hunter around 1832, as did Francis Allman who sold up much of his property there and re-entered the public service as Police Magistrate for the Illawarra in September 1832.SRNSW: CSC 2/7807.2/8008 In July 1834 Boland and O'Brien were granted absolute pardons. Royal Approval was given in December 1834 and the pardons were gazetted in Sydney in July 1835. By December 1835 they had sold their Illawarra farms. They had named these after localities in County Clare: Ballyvally was Boland's choice, Killestry was O'Brien's, both localities near Killaloe.SRNSW: CSC 4/2229.4/4488.2/8008.NSW Govt Gazette 15 July 1835 In September 1836 Boland put his Appin property on the market, including the that Denis O'Brien had bought that had once been Pendergast's. It was advertised as: He was also selling the crop, consisting of of wheat and of oats, either with the farm or separate. \\"The furniture is modern and good, and may be taken at a valuation, as the Proprietor is leaving the Colony.\\".Sydney Herald, 1 September 1836 Further particulars could be got from Boland on the premises and from Francis Allman who had become Police Magistrate at Campbelltown in 1836. In March 1837 Boland sold his stock, 250 head of \\"very superior mixed cattle\\", at auction in Campbelltown and in April the property - called Summerhill at that time - was sold, with Francis Allman witness to the conveyance. Boland went home to Ireland where he died in March 1839, at the home of his widowed sister Mary Sullivan in Limerick. In his will he left significant sums of money to his sisters and various nephews and nieces including a niece named Margaret Crowe. He also declared that Captain Francis Allman owed him ¬£800 (plus interest) and he empowered his niece Margaret Crowe to call in that debt, precipitating a chain of events that bankrupted Allman and forced his resignation from the magistracy.Sydney Monitor, 29 March 1837.SRNSW: Probate packet Series 1 no.1502.CSC 4/2660.3 In tendering his resignation to Governor Gipps in April 1844 Allman provided an account of his relationship to Boland. He explained that: About six years back he found himself possessed of about ¬£5,000, and having at that time obtained an absolute pardon he went home taking the sum before mentioned with him with the exception of ¬£600 which he insisted on leaving at my disposal with the perfect understanding that it was to be my property should he not return to the colony. I reluctantly accepted of this sum, on his own condition, and also gave him an order on my agents in London for a sum of ¬£220 which sum he promised to remit to my family in goods from London. Bolan died of drunkenness shortly after landing among his friends but not before, as it appears, leaving all his property to the person who has since sued me here.SRNSW: CSC 44/3476 Allman's account is naturally partisan. There can be no doubt that his sponsorship played a pivotal role in the success of Boland's colonial career but Boland's first break was provided by Connor Bryan's power of attorney and Boland himself was also an agent in his own success. Horse-breeding was one of the keys to his prosperity, almost certainly generating more income for Boland than farming. Allman's reference to paying for \\"the services of Entire horses for the many mares\\" Boland kept on Allman's estate on the Hunter is one indication of this. Another is the advertisement for a lost horse which appeared in the colonial press in June 1839, after Boland's death in Ireland. The ad describes the horse as 'bred by Connor Baldwin and Dennis O'Brien of Appin'.Sydney Monitor, 10 June 1839.Sydney Gazette, 11 June 1839 The establishment of Summer Hill (later Beulah), -46 Decorative bargeboards When Boland advertised his farm for sale in September 1836 the house was described as \\"a well-finished stone house\\" that had \\"lately been erected\\". We know from Allman's testimony to Gipps, and from Boland's 1831 application for a town grant in Maitland on which to build a house, that he had by that time accumulated a significant amount of capital. The quick succession of sales of property and stock following his receipt of an Absolute Pardon in 1834 suggest that, having made up his mind to go home to Ireland, he set about the construction of the house as a means to maximise the value of his assets. A farmhouse had existed on Connor Bryan's grant for many years prior to the construction of the new stone house. In September 1824 the Appin constables certified that the farm, then in the occupation of Boland's assigned convict servant Patrick Teefy, had ';a good House, and logg'd Barn, with outhouses'. Henry Sears' grant also had 'good logg'd house', occupied by John Noonan, a convict assigned to Denis O'Brien.State Records NSW: Colonial Secretary's Correspondence 4/1780 The improvements on Connor Bryan's grant were clearly more substantial than those on Sears' and it seems probable that this house became the main residence on the consolidated Boland property, possibly occupying the same site as the later house but no information has been uncovered about the actual construction of the later house. Sometime in the early 1830s the consolidated property acquired the name Summer Hill. It was listed under that name in the New South Wales Calendar and General Post Office Directory for 1834 as the address of Denis O'Brien. The listing was repeated in the 1835, 1836 and 1837 editions of the directory (which ceased publication with the 1837 edition). Summer Hill was sold to a gentleman from Parramatta named Duncan Cameron in April 1837 in two simultaneous transactions: Connor Bryan's 40 acres and Henry Sears' 30 acres were sold by Boland as one parcel for ¬£500. Patrick Pendergast's 50 acres was sold by Denis O'Brien for ¬£275.NSW Land & Property Information: Old Systems Book L nos. 207 and 208 Cameron did not hold the property long, putting it back on the market in March 1839, but the description of the place in Cameron's advertisement was couched in slightly different terms to that given in Boland's advertisement of April 1837. Boland was selling a farm while Cameron was pitching a \\"handsome homestead\\". Cameron placed emphasis on the genteel nature of the property, stating that the house had been built within the last four years and being in full repair was \\"fit for the immediate reception of a respectable family\\". The house was described as \\"a stone and lime edifice\\". Boland's \\"eight good rooms\\" had become Cameron's \\"eight apartments, consisting of a parlour, a dining room, a drawing room and four bed rooms\\". More significantly, Cameron's advertisement declared that there was \\"a substantially stone built kitchen, newly erected behind the house, with a commodious fire place and servants\\" bed room' and also stated that the house was \\"approached by a noble avenue from the public road leading to Illawarra'. This latter reference may provide a clue to the troublesome question of the date of the construction of the stone bridge over Woodhouse Creek. Leases and occupations/uses One other interesting detail of Cameron's 1839 advertisement for Summer Hill is reference to the fact that no grain had been sown on the farm since 1837. Neither's Boland's sale in April 1837, nor Cameron's in August 1839 brought a new owner occupier. It seems that the property was not actively farmed for some years after Boland's departure. Instead there were a series of tenants, only a handful of whom have been identified. For a short time in 1838/1839 it was leased to young Scottish immigrant, graduate of the University of Glasgow and journalist James McEachern. He announced in The Colonist in September 1838 that he had opened a private boys' boarding school '...in the District of Appin, on the Farm of Summerhill, which, from its beautiful and sequestered situation, its commodious house, excellent garden, and other advantages, is particularly suited for the purpose to which it is now applied '. As Mr McE's mother superintends his domestic affairs the general arrangements of the Establishment will be rendered as nearly as possible similar to those of a family; and Parents may therefore rest assured, that no reasonable trouble or expense shall be spared to promote the comfort and improvement of those who may become pupils at Summerhill'. The school probably operated for only two terms. In January 1839 The Colonist ran an editorial announcing the school would re-open on 10 January when McEachern, through some unspecified \\"recent arrangements\\" that he had made, would be able to accommodate a larger number of boarders than hitherto: Under the domestic management of Mrs. McE, together with the substantial comforts derivable from the farm, with its dairy and excellent garden, we should think that the Summerhill Academy ought to be one of the most eligible establishments for the education of youth in the southern districts of the colony.The Colonist 8 September 1838.2 January 1839.The Sydney Herald, 21 November 1838 Two months later the property was again on the market. In August 1839 it sold to Lachlan Macalister for ¬£800. Macalister was a former Captain in the 48th Regiment (like Francis Allman) who had served for some years as a Lieutenant of the NSW Mounted Police. He had substantial pastoral interests in the southern districts of NSW as well as an estate called Clifton at Picton.NSW LPI Old Systems Book D no. 363 In January 1840 Macalister let Summer Hill for six months to a newly arrived Scottish settler named Archibald Cuninghame. Cuninghame was a young man aged 29, heir to an estate in Ayrshire. He had come to the Australian colonies with his elder sisters Christina and Sarah and his younger brother John on a colonial adventure, looking to invest in a grazing property. He rented Summer Hill as a place to domicile his entourage, which included four servants, while he scouted the \\"different quarters of the colony' for a suitable property. Cuninghame did not farm at Summer Hill but bought sufficient sheep to provide mutton for the household, as well as a couple of milch cows. He also bought three brood mares and a saddle-mare, having learnt soon after his arrival that \\"horse trading pays excellently here\\". His sister Sarah established a kitchen garden and kept chickens. Both Archibald and Sarah left detailed descriptions of the house. Archibald's account was contained in a letter to his mother in Scotland, written from Sydney on 21 January 1840:Mitchell Library, State Library of NSW: ML MSS 3178, Rintoul, Heard and Robert were Cuninghame servants. Archibald's description of the sleeping arrangements at Summer Hill suggest that he and his brother John and the servant Rintoul each had one of the four verandah rooms, the fourth of which must have been the \\"spare room\\" that he was reserving for prospective additional employees. The other male servants shared the loft but Archibald made no reference to the fourth servant, a maid-of-all-work named Charlotte who also had with her a young daughter called Nancy. Sarah Cuninghame makes frequent reference to Charlotte and Nancy in the daily diary that she kept during January‚ÄìFebruary 1840. She describes the house and its setting and the neighbourhood as if she were writing a series of letters to her mothers and sisters in Scotland and begins her description on the morning after their arrival at Summer Hill: As the household faced up to the challenge of their first Australian summer Sarah observed that: The Cuninghame sisters had been to visit the Macarthurs at Camden Park - Archibald had a letter of introduction to James Macarthur ?- and Sarah had seen the potential value of climbing plants:Mitchell Library, SL NSW: ML MSS 3179. It is clear from the words \\"I suppose they are all planted here\\" that Sarah Cuninghame knew that the aloe was not native to New South Wales but her description points to the fact that they were a notable feature of the colonial landscape. In July 1840 the Cuninghames left Summer Hill for Melbourne and the district of Port Phillip. The next known tenant of Summer Hill was a man named George Bonnor who took up a six month lease of the farm at the beginning of July 1842 but was declared insolvent in mid-January 1843, owing Macalister the full rent of ¬£42/10s. Bonnor was never a likely farmer. He had been a commission agent in England before becoming bankrupt in 1839 and he had left England in 1840 under an assumed name (Brown) to escape his creditors.SRNSW: Insolvency files 2/8721 no.621 Bonnor's schedule of assets on his farm at Appin was extremely modest: various farming implements; about of potatoes; a horse, cart and harness; one hen and chickens; a kitchen table; a mattress; a quantity of casks; and wearing apparel for himself, his wife and his child. Not much for a man who styled himself \\"farmer\\". But he was hardly a reliable witness and was certainly hiding assets. Indeed, three years later his neighbour Francis Rawdon Hume revealed in a notice published in The Sydney Morning Herald that Bonnor had left cattle on Hume's farm Rockwood at the beginning of 1843 - on the eve of the sequestration of his estate.The Sydney Morning Herald, 21 February 1845. Bonnor might have been Macalister's last tenant at Summer Hill. In May 1843 Macalister sold the property to Henry Harvey and Benjamin Lee from Parramatta, recouping his outlay of ¬£800.NSW LPI: Old Systems Book 3 no. 848. Two years later, in March 1845, Harvey and Lee conveyed the property to Helenus Scott of Glendon in the Hunter River district, as part of a complicated settlement of debts. In 1842 Harvey and Lee had got themselves into financial difficulties with Robert Scott, brother of Helenus when they entered into a bond with Scott which guaranteed the repayment of certain monies Scott had lent to Duncan Cameron. Cameron defaulted on repayment of this money - ¬£6,600 - in January 1844. After Robert Scott's death in July 1844 proceedings were taken against Harvey and Lee by Helenus Scott as executor and sole beneficiary of his brother's estate. The proceedings were abandoned by mutual agreement on the conveyance of the Appin property. It was a very small offset against the bad debt but the colony was then still feeling the consequences of the severe economic depression which had affected all the Australian colonies in the early 1840s.NSW LPI Old Systems Book 8 no. 481. Scott put the property up for auction in Sydney in June 1845. The auction notice declared that \\"Summer Hill Farm\\" was entirely \\"stumped and free for the plough from one end to the other\\". In addition to a cottage (no longer a 'handsome homestead'!) with dining and drawing rooms, four verandah rooms, detached kitchen and laundry, the improvements included a 'moderate sized barn, men's huts, stables' and \\"a large tank\\".The Sydney Morning Herald, 2 June 1845 The reference to a large tank in this context is a reference to a dam, probably intended to hold water for livestock (The 1833 edition of the New South Wales Calendar and General Post Office Directory notes that Thomas Rose who then owned Mount Gilead, the property to the north of Summer Hill, had been 'the first to construct a tank sufficiently capacious to secure him from the want of water in dry seasons'). Summer Hill was offered as a property that was \\"desirable as either a country residence for any party desirous of living away from the city, yet within a comfortable drive of it, or, as a dairy or agricultural farm\\". Interestingly, although offered as , it was described as actually being - the discrepancy explained by the creek \\"having been roughly surveyed as a straight line\\". In August 1846 the three original grants of , (collectively known as the Summer Hill Estate), were conveyed to \\"John Kennedy Hume of Appin, Gentleman\\" for ¬£300. John Kennedy Hume was the six-year old son of Francis Rawdon Hume and his wife Emma Mitchell. He was born at Rockwood, the Hume family estate at Appin, on 24 April 1840.NSW Land & Property Information: Old Systems Book 11 no. 405.Sydney Herald, 29 April 1840. The Hume story (1846-1936) The first Appin propertyHume Mount / Humewood / Rockwood Andrew Hume's original 1812 grant of was called Hume Mount. His additional grant of received in 1816 adjoined this land and over the next twenty years both Andrew Hume and his son Francis Rawdon Hume extended the estate by buying adjoining grants so that by 1827 Hume Mount totalled more than (NSW Land & Property Information: RPA 12539). Other Hume land at Appin included Francis Rawdon Hume's own 1823 grant of , which adjoined his father's land on the north-east, and Hamilton Hume's in the same area. Hamilton's property was called Brookdale and included that he had been granted as a reward for his services in exploring new country beyond the Yass Plains.Entry for Hamilton Hume in ADB online. John Kennedy Hume, Andrew Hume's second son, had an grant, which he called Hillsborough Farm, less than a mile to the north of his brother Rawdon's grant. Hamilton Hume received additional large grants of in reward for further exploration, choosing to establish properties on the Yass Plains. By the late 1820s many colonists were confident that the financial rewards promised by pastoralism were much greater than those provided by agriculture. All of the Hume brothers were looking for pastoral land in the new southern districts, the districts that had been partially opened up by the explorations of Hamilton Hume. For his part, John Kennedy Hume may have had an additional motivation for moving south. In 1825 he had married Elizabeth O'Neill, step-daughter of Patrick Pendergast of Appin, a marriage contracted in secret, in opposition to the wishes of his family. He established a property near Gunning.Stuart Hamilton Hume Beyond the borders: an anecdotal history of the Hume and related pioneering families, privately published, 1991 In October 1826 Francis Rawdon Hume had applied for an additional \\"grant of land without purchase\\", declaring that he had built \\"a substantial dwelling house of four rooms, with a verandah &c;\\" as well as a servants' house and a stable on his existing grant of . He also declared that of the grant was in a state of cultivation and that he had 75 head of horned cattle, two horses and other stock. He had erected a three-railed fence around nearly all of his land and had employed and maintained three convict servants off the government stores for the previous year.SRNSW: CSC 2/7886 Rawdon Hume's application was supported by two referees, one of whom was Thomas Rose, a Sydney innkeeper who was at that time owner of the adjoining property Mt Gilead. Rose attested that he knew that Hume had built a dwelling house and had brought a great portion of his land into cultivation. The other referee, Sydney flour-miller Thomas Barker, was careful to say that he had not seen Hume's farm for two years but felt confident that it would be in good order since Francis Rawdon Hume was \\"an industrious, good farmer\\" who brought \\"superior quality, well-cleaned\\" wheat for sale to Sydney. Hume's referees were not particularly concerned about the details of Francis Rawdon Hume's improvements on his grant. They had been asked to testify as to his means, to confirm that he had sufficient surplus capital to invest in additional property should he be granted such land. Although there is no indication that Francis Rawdon Hume received an additional grant in response to his 1826 application, there is some evidence that he was already running cattle on a property in the County of Argyle by late 1826.SRNSW: CSC 2/7886.2/7850 In February 1827 Francis Rawdon Hume advertised Hume Mount and Humewood farms \\"to be let for a term of five years.\\"Sydney Monitor, 17 February 1827. The advertisement confirms that F. R. Hume's original grant was named Humewood but, in the event, the farms were not let. Instead there was some re- arrangement of land occupation between F. R. Hume and his father. Andrew Hume went to live with his daughter Isabella Barber at Glenrock near Marulan but remained listed in the NSW Calendar and General Post Office Directory from 1832-7 as owning property at Appin called Humewood. Francis Rawdon (F. R.) Hume settled in at Hume Mount which by 1828 he had renamed Rockwood. He married Emma Mitchell in 1830 and in June 1831 applied for additional land for his wife Emma as a marriage portion. The first of 14 children, a son Andrew Hamilton Hume, was born at Rockwood in May 1832.Aldine Centennial History of New South Wales: entry for Andrew Hamilton Hume at Campbelltown. Although he had another go at letting Rockwood in December 1833, advertising it as suitable for \\"emigrants with families\\" and \\"well-adapted for agriculture with a run for a small dairy herd\\", F. R. Hume remained at Rockwood with his family until August 1846 when he sold up his furniture, implements, pigs, poultry, horses.Sydney Monitor, 14 December 1833.The Sydney Morning Herald, 24 August 1846. A correspondent called \\"Felix\\" wrote a letter ...regretting Hume's departure from \\"his fine estate of Rockwood for his establishment in the interior\\", declaring that Appin would feel the loss of \\"as good-hearted a man as ever breathed\\".Bell's Life in Sydney and Sporting Reviewer, 8 August 1846. Francis Rawdon Hume bought Summer Hill in his son's name in the midst of packing up to leave Rockwood. Rockwood was let to a Mr Bayne but nothing is known of the arrangements at Summer Hill. Two years later, in September 1848 both Rockwood and Summer Hill were advertised as farms to let, \\"for such term of years as may be agreed upon\\". Rockwood was described as containing about , divided into twelve paddocks, with 'a commodious stone-built dwelling-house, containing a spacious hall, two large parlours, four bed-rooms, two large attics, cellar; with a snug four-room cottage attached, stone-built kitchen and store; large garden and orchard, stables, men's dwelling and other out- offices'. Summer Hill was described as adjoining Rockwood and containing \\"upwards of \\", divided into five paddocks with \\"a substantial stone-built cottage, containing a hall, eight rooms, with attic, and having a detached stone-built kitchen. A shrubbery, enclosed by palisades, in front; large garden and orchard in the rear, and a large enclosed reservoir quite convenient to the dwelling\\". Leases and occupations / uses Few details are known of Francis Rawdon Hume's tenants at Summer Hill during the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s beyond some names listed in directories or electoral rolls. The Official Post Office Directory of New South Wales for 1867, for example, lists two farmers at Summer Hill, Appin: James Burke and James McGrath. Burke (or Bourke) is also listed as Francis Rawdon's tenant at Summer Hill in the electoral rolls for the district of Appin from 1869-1876. At Rockwood the social status of the tenants was such that notices of marriages, or deaths, or the births of their children, might be published in the newspapers. Through such notices and family papers, we know the Clayton family took up residence at Rockwood .Hume papers, Yass & District Historical Society: letters to Emma Clayton (later Hume) and her diaries. The head of the household was Frances (Fanny) Matilda Clayton, widow of Dr Benjamin Clayton, late of Baltinglass, near Gunning. Fanny was a Broughton, daughter of Acting Commissary William Broughton, one of the original grantees of land at Appin. She was a cousin of F. R. Hume and his siblings.William Broughton's second wife, Elizabeth Charlotte Kennedy, was first cousin of the children of Andrew Hamilton Hume and Elizabeth More Kennedy. The Claytons lived at Rockwood for nearly twenty years, apparently on a succession of five-year leases. A surviving memorandum of agreement' relating to the tenancy, dated 1 February 1860, suggests that by that time management of Hume affairs at Rockwood had passed to Rawdon Hume's eldest son Andrew Hamilton Hume.Map accompanying agreement reproduced in Peter Freeman & Partners Report to Public Inquiry proposed PCO Beulah, Appin, for NSW DEP, 1987.Originals in private collection. Under the terms of this agreement Frances Matilda Clayton agreed to rent \\"the farm known as Rockwood consisting of about 400 acres\\" for five years at the rate of ¬£40 per annum, agreeing also to spend ¬£100 on shingling and repairing the house and ¬£100 on erecting fences and clearing out waterholes. The memorandum includes reference to James McGrath, tenant at Summer Hill, which suggests that there had been some permeability between the boundaries of Rockwood and Summer Hill. The document includes the following terms: \\"It is agreed between Mrs Clayton and James McGrath that those portions of the two farms taken from each other under the old leases shall remain so, for the first year of this lease\\". The map which accompanies the memorandum indicates roughly the existing land use at Summer Hill at that time, showing the Pendergast grant as divided into a bush paddock and a cultivation paddock. The maps show two houses, one on Rockwood and one on Summer Hill. Confusingly, it also shows Rawdon Hume's 1823 grant as belonging to \\"J. K. Hume of Collingwood left him by his grandfather\\". When Andrew Hamilton Hume senior made his will in January 1844 he devised 'to John Hume the infant son of my lamented late son John Hume who was barbarously murdered all that tract of land in Appin ... bounded on the north by Rose's land, on the east by the Appin Road, on the west by a creek running north, and on the south by an avenue leading to Rawdon Hume's house'.Mitchell Library, SL NSW: ML MSS A 3341, Francis Rawdon Hume Papers. John Kennedy Hume, second son of Andrew Hamilton Hume, was murdered by a bushranger Thomas Whitton in Gunning in 1840. His son, also John Kennedy Hume, was born in 1840 and died in 1869). This description clearly matches the land granted to Rawdon Hume in 1823, but Andrew Hume's assumption that it is his own property and that he has the right to devise it to his grandson seems to confirm that this is the place called Humewood, listed as Andrew Hume's Appin address in the NSW Calendar and Post Office Directory of the 1830s when Francis Rawdon Hume was listed at Rockwood. Andrew Hume died in 1849 but his will was never probated. The puzzle is complicated by an annotation on the original crown grant for Humewood. In an unknown hand, it reads: 'Mr Charles Hume, one of F. R. Hume's sons, told me told me that this land was devised to J. K. Hume by F. R. Hume.'Original in Caroline Simpson Library & Research Collection. Fanny Clayton had eight children, the eldest aged 19, the youngest just two years old (four sons and four daughters) when she took up Rockwood following her husband's death in September 1854.The Sydney Morning Herald, 16 September 1854. The family enjoyed a close friendship with near neighbours at Mt Gilead, Edmund Hume Woodhouse and his wife Gertrude. A scrap album kept by Gertrude includes a sketch of Rockwood and associated buildings drawn in October 1863.NSW Land & Property Information: RPA 12539 - Declaration of Gertrude Clara Woodhouse.Mitchell Library, SL NSW: ML MSS A2428. Fanny Clayton's second daughter Emma Johnson Clayton was born at Gunning on 25 April 1843.The Sydney Morning Herald, 24 May 1843. Throughout her adult life she kept a diary. Her entry for January 1872 has reference to her future husband John Kennedy Hume: \\"All had a walk together to the aloes after tea. Had a little music this evening and played whist and bridge. Ben and J. K. H. at Mt. G.\\" ('Ben' is a reference to Emma's brother Benjamin Clayton. \\"Mt. G\\" is Mt Gilead). Emma married John Kennedy Hume at St Peter's Campbelltown on 19 February 1873. Edmund Hume Woodhouse was one of the trustees of her marriage settlement.The Sydney Morning Herald, 28 February 1873.NSW Land & Property Information: Old Systems Book 304 no.498. Following their marriage they lived first at Forest Lodge, Goulburn, then Cooma Cottage near Yass. John Kennedy Hume inherited Cooma Cottage on his uncle's death in April 1873, as well as a property called Marchmont near Yass. John and Emma's first child, Ellen Clayton Hume, was born at Forest Lodge on 25 February 1874. A son named Hamilton was born at Yass in 1875 but died aged 14 months. A third child, another daughter, born in August 1882, lived barely a year.The Sydney Morning Herald, 2 March 1874.The Sydney Morning Herald, 24 December 1875.The Sydney Morning Herald, 20 January 1877.The Sydney Morning Herald, 26 August 1882.Death certificate for Maud Emma Hume 1883/9979. Following the death of this child John and Emma decided to return to Appin. After the Claytons left Rockwood in the mid-1870s the property had tenants, including Mrs Gertrude Woodhouse who had decamped to Rockwood after her husband's death in 1875 when her eldest son had taken charge at Mt Gilead. At Rockwood she bred stud horses, prize-winning sheep and pigs, winning three silver medals at the Sydney International Exhibition of 1879, one for an Exmoor horse called Sir Thomas, one for a coarse-woolled Southdown ram and one for a coarse-woolled Southdown ewe. At the Agricultural Society's 1881 exhibition she won prizes for an old English Berkshire sow while another exhibitor won a prize for a Dartford Park sow bred by Mrs Woodhouse.Official record of the Sydney International Exhibition 1879, Sydney, 1881, pp.938, 960.Australian Town and Country Journal, 9 August 1879.The Sydney Morning Herald, 27 April 1881 Mrs Woodhouse had a five-year lease on Rockwood but by the time John and Emma Hume returned to Appin John's eldest brother Andrew Hamilton Hume and his family were in residence.Hume, Stuart Hamilton, Beyond the borders, op cit. Beulah (1884-1936) John Kennedy Hume used Rockwood as a base during the first half of 1884 while he arranged to take over the occupation of Summer Hill. His tenants, a family called Murray, needed time to find alternative accommodation and he needed to make some repairs. It is clear from letters to his wife that they had decided to change the name to Beulah.Yass & District Historical Society: RW 1582/1 (Hume Papers). Beulah was a Hebrew word used in the Book of Isaiah as a prophesied attribute of the land of Israel and used in literature as the name of a mystical place, somewhere between Earth and Heaven. It was used in this way on John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. John Kennedy Hume was an adherent of a group called the British Israelites whose doctrine was based on the hypothesis that people of British descent were direct lineal descendants of the ten lost tribes of Israel. Some sense of what might have been the promise of Beulah for John and Emma is conveyed in a letter written by John from Rockwood to Emma in March 1884: John engaged prominent Sydney architects Mansfield Brothers to carry our repairs and renovations to the cottage. Tenders were called In March. Hume may have chosen Mansfield as architect because he had a social acquaintance with him. George Allen Mansfield had a country house called Glen Lorne near Mt Gilead, just along the Appin Road. There are no details of what repairs the architects were to carry out except reference to the old kitchen being cleared away and a foundation being laid for the new one. It seems probable the summer house was erected at this time, as a belvedere with sightlines to both Hume homes, Rockwood and Beulah. John was doing other work around the property: trenching, fencing - putting up a four-railed fence to keep things away from the house planting the garden. The house was \\"beginning to look something like new\\" by that time but the work was still not finished at the beginning of August when the radishes and cress had emerged. John took up residence in late August and began furnishing the place, sending Emma a list of shopping for Sydney: a kitchen table, kerosene oil, crockery, kitchen lamp etc' Emma and Ellen joined him at Beulah before the end of the year and in December 1884 an alteration was made to the terms of Emma's marriage settlement whereby the trustees of the settlement were instructed to sell certain property in Yass and to invest the proceeds in the purchase of Beulah, \\"consisting of or thereabouts\\". By this arrangement she became owner of the Bryan, Sears and Pendergast grants, the property bought for John Kennedy Hume when he was six. John's father, Francis Rawdon Hume, was alive in 1884, living in retirement at Castlesteads near Boorowa. He died in 1888 leaving a will by which in a codicil made September 1882 he confirmed John Kennedy Hume's title to Summer Hill. From Emma's diaries and correspondence of J. K. Hume, it seems they lived a quiet life at Beulah. Emma records the small daily routines: afternoon walks to the gate; in the creek in quest of ferns; to and reading in the summer house; walks in the Rockwood creek; sending an employee to cut chaff at Brookdale; getting the piano tuned; planting seeds of aster and pansy; the heifer calving; social visits to Brookdale and Glen Lorne; collecting eggs; John going to Campbelltown in the sulky; to Yass; selling a horse; getting a horse shod; catching 23 fish in the river; getting bamboo roots from Glen Lorne and planting them in the garden; killing a black snake in the bush above the bridge; the death of a cat; giving lemons to a neighbour; making apricot jam; gardening in the cool of the day. John's letters talk about buying hay for the cows and pumping water for cattle in drought. In the late 1880s he put in a new, deeper, dam some distance from the house, \\"over the hill\\". John Hume died at Beulah in November 1905. An inventory of household effects itemised the furniture including dining room, four bedrooms, study, hall, man's room, bathroom, kitchen, office, verandah and bush house. His real estate comprised his Marchmont near Yass and , parish portion 77, at Appin. He sold Cooma Cottage in 1904. The Appin land was described: Emma was John's sole beneficiary. Her diaries provide little detail of how she managed. She died at Beulah on 30 November 1919. A trained nurse, Jessie Clayton of Minto, witnessed the death. Jessie was Emma's niece. Emma's (portion 77) \\"well timbered natural forest\\" and the remaining , Beulah noting residence, outbuildings of wood and/or iron, store room, bathroom, stable, feed room, coach-house, laundry, summer-house, labourer's cottage of two rooms, milking bails. Ellen Hume was sole beneficiary of her mother's estate. Few details are known of her life at Beulah in the years after her mother's death or of the management of her inheritance. Ellen was certainly in attendance at another Royal Australian Historical Society visit to the monument in March 1929. She was known to be interested in Hume family history. A partial visual record of the house and its surrounds around the time of Emma's death is provided by a series of soft-focus, hand-coloured photographs taken by a studio photographer. Ellen Hume and Beulah were featured in The Australian Home Beautiful in 1934 in an article by Nora Cooper, photographs by Harold Cazneaux and descriptions of Hume family furniture. The forest which Miss Hume treated as a private sanctuary - The Hume Sanctuary - received special attention. It was Ellen's wish that her trees be left to the nation. A photograph from 1934 indicates that the character of the spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) forest has remained constant. The garden close to the house was described as conforming to no special pattern: A photograph of the garden shows a shade house on the south-east corner of the front garden, roses, a small palm (the extant Phoenix dactylifera/date palm?) and the encircling wooden fence with the forest beyond. Ellen Clayton Hume died in 1936, leaving Beulah to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, NSW Branch (RSPCA). She left ¬£1,000, ¬£3 a week allowance and a life interest in the property to her \\"maid and companion\\", Sarah Papworth. Sarah, known as \\"Dolly\\", was thirteen years younger than Ellen, had known Beulah since childhood. Her father Eddie Tobin had worked full-time for John and Emma Hume, while her mother Harriet had worked for the family. When Harriet died in 1939 she was living with her daughter at Beulah. Sarah's husband David received ¬£1,000 as did Ellen's resident nurse, Sister Helen Timmins. Sarah died in 1960 after which David was entitled to live there under the same terms. He died in 1967, triggering a flurry of activity around the remaining furniture and books, with two female Hume cousins disputing with the RSPCA Trustees over entitlements. Both died before Papworth. Stuart Hume, great-grandson of F. R. Hume, was given authority to take Hume books after Papworth's death. Furniture and other items, silver and china, disappeared. Some were looted, others given away by the RSCPA. A large collection of Hume and Clayton diaries and letters was given to Mrs Shirley Ball who ran the private Colonial House Museum, in Millers Point. Beulah was formally conveyed to the RSPCA on 3 December 1969. In February 1970 the RSPCA signed an agreement with Northbridge Estates P/L to buy it. By the time Beulah was actually conveyed on 26 February 1971 Northbridge Estates had become Beulah Investments P/L. Beulah was bought as an investment (anticipating Government resumption) following the 1968 new plan to expand metropolitan Sydney, directing growth along three transport corridors. The State Planning Authority began buying land locally in the late 1960s for future industrial and education uses and Housing Commission development. The Macarthur Development Board was established in 1974 to manage the growth centre with authority to acquire and develop land and manage an environmental and heritage conservation program. Federal funding ceased in 1975. The State Government got increasingly unwilling to bear long-term investment costs from land acquisition. In June 1977 the English principals of Beulah Investments P/L were confident it would be resumed. They let it on short leases for grazing and agistment to cover rates. In December 1979 the NSW Planning & Environment Commission advised them that the extent of land had been revised and Beulah released from designation under the Growth Centre Act. Meanwhile a detailed regional survey of 19th century buildings and sites was done for the State Planning Authority. Its November 1973 report identified Beulah and the trees known as Humewood as significant and proposed preservation. An edited version was published in March 1977. The National Trust (NSW) did extra research on Beulah's history, classifying it in April 1980. Through the 1980s Beulah Investments P/L continued to let Beulah to tenants (cattle, horses), turning down a series of prospective buyers. In February 1983 Campbelltown Council proposed an interim conservation order. The PCO was made on 8 April 1983 to the whole of Portion 78. In January 1985 Beulah Investments P/L were given notice of a permanent conservation order, objected, leading to a Commission of Inquiry. The hearing in January and February 1987 decided to proceed with a PCO over - part of Portion 78. The bridge was not thought at risk, so excluded, as was the summer house and 20th century cottage. The National Trust (NSW) classified the bridge in May 1987. Interest was growing in the remnant forest on Portion 77. Campbelltown Council prepared a Development Control Plan to allow part of Beulah to be listed as a local heritage item - to which Beulah Investments P/L objected. Beulah was kept on short-leases for agistment. In 1993 Campbelltown Council proposed rezoning for a wildlife corridor including Beulah's spotted gum forest. Beulah Investments P/L and neighbouring Mt. Gilead opposed this. George Betts died in 2000, having represented Beulah Investments P/L's interests for 30 years. In April 2000 the Heritage Councli wrote to Beulah Investments P/L pointing out that minimum standards of maintenance and repair were not being adhered to, i.e. it was demolition by neglect. In February 2004 Clive Lucas, Stapleton & Partners were contracted for a schedule of essential maintenance to walls, roof, verandah posts. From September 2010 Beulah was acquired ($2 million; $600,000 through OEH's Biodiversity Offset program and a biobanking agreement to preserve the of significant bushland on site), repaired, adaptively reused and readied for sale by the Historic Houses Trust of NSW through its endangered houses fund. It is being prepared for sale.Martin, 2013  Description  Farm Farm The property is broadly rectangular running away from Appin Road on its eastern side towards the Upper Canal water supply for Sydney to its west. A driveway winds from Appin Road over Woodhouse Creek through an area of forest, past a former dam and bore and an area of remnant formal planning layout to the homestead group with remnant plants, outbuildings and fence lines. To the north of the homestead group is a dairy. To its south-west is an octagonal summer house ruin. This was deliberately sited in an area giving both the best views and summer breezes. It has a clear relationship to the homestead group and to adjoining Meadowvale homestead group to its south- west - on axis. On both sides of the driveway which continues west of the homestead group were cultivated paddocks - visible in a 1947 aerial photograph - patterns indicating possible former orchards or pasture improvement in this area. Dams and another area of cultivation patterns in the farm's south-west. Beulah adjoins Meadowvale to its south, another colonial farm estate and this boundary is marked by remaining post and rail fencing.Morris & Britton, 2000, figure 4.19 site plan. The house and outbuildings are set within a level basin enclosed in the southern and western sides by the ridgeline and to the north and east by the conservation forest. Only the gazebo (or summer house) is set on the ridgeline overlooking the adjacent (to the south-west) former Hume homestead known as Meadowvale.Urbis, 2014, 14 The land is largely cleared and shows evidence of continued pastoral use, with the exception of the conservation forest. Forest Forest Approximately of the total site area of approximately (65%) of the farm is covered with conservation forest. This forest includes both remnant Cumberland Plain Woodland (), Sydney Shale Sandstone Transition Forest (). This forested area coveres 65.65% of the property, including the whole of Lot 21 DP1132464 and portions of the remaining three lots of the site.Urbis, 2014, 5 Both types of vegetation noted above are listed as endangered ecological communities under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. This forest has significance as a rare remnant natural forest with important values in terms of biodiversity for both flora and faujna and as part of the Georges / Nepean River corridors.Urbis, 2014, 35 The conservation forest should be managed as per the recommendations and requirements of the Biobanking Agreement ID no. 058, under Part 7A Division 2 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. This includes preventing stock from grazing in any area of the biobanking site, regular and ongoing effective control of environmental weeds, management of exotic forbs, grasses and vines, monitoring and review of the weed management plan, management of fire for conservation, management of human disturbance, management of regrowth and remnant vegetation, supplementary planting, retention of dead timber, rocks, erosion control, pest management and nutrient control etc.Urbis, 2014, 37 Bridge over Woodhouse Creek (+) The timber beam bridge over Woodhouse Creek on \\"Beulah\\" is believed to be the only example of its type in private ownership and the only one known to retain a full set of stringer girders intact. It is a rare remnant of Australia's oldest surviving form of bridge construction. It is approximately from the homestead, negotiating a steep rocky creek. It is believed to be contemporary with the house (1830-1840). Its style of construction is not unlike that employed in some earlier bridges in the Great North Road, north of Wisemans Ferry. It consists of stone masonry abutments approximately apart with hardwood stringer girders spanning that distance for a width of approximately . The original decking no longer exists. The remains of some hand railing exists lying in the grass adjacent to the causeway. The invert of the creek bed is stone faced for the width of the bridge and upstream and downstream. Downstream, it discharges into a natural rock pool formation. There is some scouring of the creek bed upstream of the paving. The abutment walls are coursed rubble stone masonry lime mortar jointed using sandstone blocks. This construction returns along the wing walls which form the sides of both approach causeways. At a distance along the causeway the mortar jointed masonry gives way to dry walling roughly coursed. At the top of the abutment walls and for a distance along the causeway walls a course of stone is recessed forming a shelf to carry a 225 square broad axed (or adzed) timber plate. At the abutments this is used to land the timber bridge stringers and along the causeway it is used to support the handrail posts. The stringers extend beyond the abutment headstock approximately along the causeway. Seven stringers 225 x 225 at 900 centres form the width of the bridge. These were originally decked with 150 x 60 hardwood planks all of which have been removed between abutments and have been replaced with a modern carriageway consisting of timber decking over railway lines as stringers occupying the centre width of the bridge. The remains of a handrail lies in the grass on the south side of the wrought iron strap securing the rail to the top of the post clearly visible. The wrought iron fish plate connecting the butted ends of the side plates is also lying on the site. The remains of bolts between stringers, side plates and headstock are also in place in corroded form as are a number of wrought iron spikes and nails. Building material: stone masonry abutments, hardwood stringer girders ;Significant landscape elements including the garden Significant landscape features include the: * conservation forest; * original access road; * remnants of 19th century plantings (including a date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), peppercorn trees (Schinus molle var. areira) and a clump of an old rose R. bracteata); as well as remnants of the: * round yard (former carriageway (loop) east of the house; * fencing; and * two 19th century dams. There are several areas of remnant early post and rail fences around the site. Remains of (later) extensive picket fence and carriage loop.National Trust (NSW). A kurrajong (Brachychiton populneum), date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) and peppercorn tree (Schinus molle var. areira) are to the front/east of the house.

The majority of these buildings on this site were built between 1835-38. They were described in contemporary descriptions in 1839 and 1840. Outbuildings are in various stages of disrepair and are derelict. ;Cottage 1 Timber, located southwest of the house. ;Former stables Timber, located south of Cottage 1. ;Cottage 2 Remnant chimney remains nearby to former stables. ;Dairy To the north of the homestead group is an attached dairy with stone slab floor. ;Gazebo / Summer House (s) To the south-west of house, Cottage 1 and former Stables, located on the ridgeline. Collapsed, timber hexagonal structure with corrugated iron roof.  Condition  As at 3 February 2015, the house is derelict and vandalized. On a derelict and poor condition overall and large sections of the ceilings and floors have collapsed. The condition of the masonry structures is generally fair to good, although some cracking and bowing of masonry walls is evident. The northwest corner has been reconstructed and various sections of the sandstone to the southern and western facades have been repointed with cementitious mortars.Urbis, 2014, 15 Much of the corrugated iron on the house's roof is recent, with older sections remaining at the north-eastern corner and upper north-western corner. For the bridge over Woodhouse Creek, the western headstock has been damaged by termite infestation and has collapsed. The eastern headstock has probably been damaged as is evident by inspection of the ends but collapse has not occurred. The \\"second\\" headstocks are buried and could not be inspected beyond the ends which show some evidence of termite damage. Further exploration would be required to confirm this. The top surface of the stringers shows moderate to extensive weathering forming vertical fissures typical of water damage at the interface between decking and girders.

The property is currently on the real estate market.  Further information  The Appin area has been subject to frequent archaeological study over the last 20 years.Aboriginal. Previous works have revealed that sandstone rock shelters and overhangs containing art are the most commonly occurring site type. Four rock shelter sites have been recorded by the Sydney Prehistory Group to the north of Woodhouse Creek. The closest of these was found from the northern curtilage (boundary) of Beulah. The subject site was characterised by areas of high, moderate and low archaeological sensitivity. Areas of high archaeological sensitivity were identified in association with Woodhouse Creek and its tributaries. Areas of moderate archaeological sensitivity were identified across large portions of the western portion of the study area, including the two ridge crest landforms and the associated gently sloping landform associated with the Beulah homestead. The 2013 artefact report categoriesd the property into areas of low, moderate and high archaeological potential. Much was assessed to be of low potential as a large proportion of the land are unlikely to have been suitable for construction of buildings due to the topography of the land and distance from the house. The report identified three areas of moderate potential which include a large area surrounding the house and including all extant structures, the site of the gazebo, which has some potential to contain artefacts and an area including a post and rail fence line and dam which has some potential to include evidence related to water irrigation and farming in the area. The artefact report reveals there are two areas of high archaeological potential. One is the site of the house and its immediate surroundings, known to include the remains of former structures and underfloor artefact deposits and garden features such as garden bed edging. The second is the driveway and bridge, which are known to include evidence for sandstone and brick road surfacing, and methods of construction used for the bridge and road approaches.Urbis, 2014, 12-13  Heritage listing  added heritage boundary map As at 20 March 2009, the Beulah estate is important as an entire cultural landscape containing early colonial structures - homestead group and stone bridge - remnant 19th century farm and garden layout, an octagonal pavilion or summer house as a major focal element and a remnant spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) forest as a result of early conservation planning.Morris & Britton, 2000, 72 Beulah was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

The residential and commercial building is a historically protected architectural building (file number D-1-62-000-7788 in the list of historical buildings for Munich at the Bavarian State Office for Monument Protection).  History and design  The building, in the style of the Neo-Renaissance, was designed by the architect Hans Hartl, who was also the client. The house, with double gable and sculpted Steinerker (stone oriel), has a mural painted on the northern side of the fa√ßade, referring to the former Restaurant zum Postgarten which was located on the ground floor. This small piece of art stretches from the second floor to the third floor between the two by two rows of windows. The drawing was done by Gottfried Gottlieb Klemm. The artwork is signed with G.G.K., with the year of completion of the building and with the year of restoration of the drawing. A rider on a horse, representing a mailman dressed in the costume of the time riding high on horseback between an espalier in the direction of the road can be seen. The drawing was made in 1903. The tavern found a new home in the new building and remained there until the year 1971. Another historical facade decoration is located between the first and second floor on the left wall side of the house. It is that of a cannonball that protrudes half its diameter out of the wall plaster. Below the ball is a commemorative plaque which describes in compact text of their history; the inscription on the board reads as follows: Nach der Beschiessung des roten Tores durch Marschall Conde am 8 Sept. D.J. 1796 hier gefunden (After the Red Gate shots by Marschall Conde at 8 Sept. D.J. 1796 found here). The cannonball found on the grounds of the Postgarten in 1796 was already embedded in the fa√ßade of the predecessor building of the old Postgarten. The architect of the building, as a complete figure in a sitting pose, is incorporated above the right-hand window on the ground floor in a natural stone slab as a half-relief. The house has survived the Second World War with almost no damage. As early as 1933, the original tops of the two gables, which were richer in design, were replaced by simpler ones. In 1984/85, the building was converted into a condominium.

He was the founding president of the Minnesota Amateur Hockey Association, and managed the United States men's national ice hockey team at the 1952 and 1956 Olympics. He was a director in the Knight Ridder media company which controlled several television and radio stations, and newspapers in Minnesota. His wealth allowed him to be a founding owner of the Minnesota North Stars and helped him provide funding for the construction of Ridder Arena at the University of Minnesota. For his work in hockey in the United States, he received the Lester Patrick Trophy, and was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame and the IIHF Hall of Fame. Early life Robert Blair Ridder was born on July 21, 1919, in New York City. He was the fifth of seven children to parents Victor F. Ridder and Marie Thompson, and the grandson of Herman Ridder. As a youth he became interested in hockey attending New York Rangers games at the Old Madison Square Garden. He graduated from Harvard University, and served in the United States Coast Guard during World War II. He married Kathleen Culman and moved to Duluth, Minnesota in 1943. Hockey career Ridder began his ice hockey career in 1943 with the Duluth Heralds, an amateur senior ice hockey team in the Duluth Industrial Hockey League. He felt that Minnesota needed a state-level organization to oversee hockey and help grow the sport. Ridder called a meeting in Saint Paul in October 1947, and founded what became the Minnesota Amateur Hockey Association (MAHA). He served as the first president of the MAHA from 1947 to 1949, and began the process of affiliating with a national body. In December 1947, the MAHA was formally accepted as a member of the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States (AHAUS), becoming the first state association to do so. The MAHA grew quickly and trailed behind only the Ontario Hockey Association, and the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association, in the number of registered players in North America. Ridder successfully lobbied the International Ice Hockey Federation to recognize AHAUS as the group responsible to represent the United States in ice hockey at the Olympic Games, and was also able to organize and finance the United States men's national ice hockey team. He was the manager of the American team in Oslo at the 1952 Winter Olympics, which resulted in a silver medal and a second place finish behind Canada. He returned to manage the American team in Cortina d'Ampezzo at the 1956 Winter Olympics, which resulted in another silver medal and a second-place behind the Soviet Union. Ridder was one of the eight original co-owners of the Minnesota North Stars. His group paid the $2 million expansion fees in the 1967 NHL expansion to bring a National Hockey League team to the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul area. Media business Ridder worked in the family business Ridder Publications, which merged into the Knight Ridder media company. His media career began by reporting news for WEBC, and several newspapers in the Minnesota area including the Duluth News Tribune, Grand Forks Herald, Saint Paul Dispatch, and the St. Paul Pioneer Press. He purchased WDSM radio in 1948, and became its president. Ridder was the first in his family to buy into television, becoming president of WCCO-TV in 1949, and WCCO Radio in 1952. He also served as the assistant secretary and director of Ridder Publications, he was vice president and director of Northwest Publications, Dispatch Realty, Aberdeen News and the Grand Forks Herald, and was a director of Mid-Continent Radio Television and Midwest Radio Television. Charitable work Ridder volunteered with the American Red Cross, the Saint Paul Urban League, and the Saint Paul United Fund. He served on the USA Hockey Foundation, and was a director for its Hall of Fame. He was a co-chair of the task force to build a women's-only hockey arena at the University of Minnesota. Ridder and his wife contributed $500,000 towards the construction of Ridder Arena, dedicated to the Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey team, but he died before its completion. Later life and honors Ridder died on June 24, 2000, at his home in Mendota Heights, Minnesota. He had been married for 56 years and had four children. Ridder received the AHAUS citation award in 1967, for of contributions towards American amateur hockey He was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1976. He received the Lester Patrick Trophy during the 1993‚Äì94 NHL season, in recognition of his contribution to ice hockey in the United States. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 1998, in the builder category. He was posthumously inducted in the inaugural class of the Minnesota Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 2001.

She graduated from University of Minnesota Duluth as a teacher, advocated for women's athletic programs at the University of Minnesota, and was a benefactor of Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey. She was active in Republican politics, supported the Equal Rights Amendment, and later turned to writing and philanthropy to help her causes. She was married to Robert Ridder, and is a namesake of the Ridder Arena. Early life Ridder was born Kathleen Marie Culman on October 2, 1922, in New York City. Her father was a stockbroker who went broke during the Great Depression, and her mother worked in a dress shop to support the household. Ridder was active in sports in her youth, attended the all-girls Brearley School, and later went to Smith College. After college she married Robert Ridder, who was part of the family which founded Knight Ridder media company, and moved with him to Minnesota in 1943. She resided in Duluth with her husband while she completed a teacher's degree at the University of Minnesota Duluth, then relocated to Saint Paul. Activism Ridder dedicated her life to fighting for women's access to opportunities in education and athletics, that she did not have as a young lady who grew up before Title IX came into effect. Ridder felt that supporting women's athletics was a means to help women succeed in life, and in the business world. She volunteered on the boards of non-profit organizations, and multiple committees at the University of Minnesota while being an advocate for women. Ridder supported the Republican Party, embraced civil and political rights, was opposed to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, supported legalized abortion in the United States, LGBT rights in the United States, and the proposed Equal Rights Amendment at the 1980 Republican National Convention. Ridder befriended Rosalie E. Wahl as the first female on the Minnesota Supreme Court, funded a book about Wahl and a Twin Cities Public Television documentary about Wahl. Ridder collaborated with Marlene Johnson in 1982 to set up the Minnesota Women's Campaign Fund, in an effort to encourage more women in political office. Ridder's other involvement included serving on the Metropolitan Council, the Minnesota State Board of Human Rights, the Saint Paul Urban League, and the Minnesota Foundation Board of Trustees. She also sat on the board of trustees for the William Mitchell College of Law. Philanthropy In 1983, Ridder established the first endowment awarded to a female student- athlete at the University of Minnesota, known as the Kathleen C. Ridder scholarship for studies in math, medicine, or science. The University of Minnesota also awards the \\"Kathleen C. and Robert B. Ridder Scholarship\\" annually to a student athlete on the Golden Gophers women's ice hockey team. Ridder and her husband helped build the first women's-only college ice hockey facility, and which became the Ridder Arena, home to the Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey. The Ridders gifted $500,000 towards the project which opened in 2002, and remained the sole facility dedicated to college women's ice hockey until the Wisconsin Badgers opened LaBahn Arena in 2010. Robert Ridder died in 2000 before the arena's completion, but Kathleen Ridder attended the opening night and dropped the ceremonial first puck.

Tazemetostat is a cancer drug that acts as a potent selective EZH2 inhibitor. Tazemetostat blocks activity of the EZH2 methyltransferase, which may help keep the cancer cells from growing. Most cases of epithelioid sarcoma begin in the soft tissue under the skin of an extremity, though it can start in other areas of the body. Surgical removal is considered the main treatment when the cancer is localized to one area of the body. Chemotherapy or radiation may also be given. However, there is a high likelihood for local and regional spread of the disease even with treatment and approximately 50% of patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Metastatic disease is considered life-threatening to the patient. The most common side effects are pain, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting and constipation. People taking tazemetostat are at increased risk of developing secondary malignancies including: T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (a type of blood cancer that affects the lymphatic system usually found in the lymph nodes), myelodysplastic syndrome (a disorder resulting from poorly formed or dysfunctional blood cells) and acute myeloid leukemia (a cancer of the blood and bone marrow). According to the NCI Drug Dictionary, \\"tazemetostat is an orally available, small molecule selective and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) competitive inhibitor of histone methyl transferase EZH2, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, tazemetostat selectively inhibits the activity of both wild-type and mutated forms of EZH2. Inhibition of EZH2 specifically prevents the methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27). This decrease in histone methylation alters gene expression patterns associated with cancer pathways and results in decreased tumor cell proliferation in EZH2 mutated cancer cells. EZH2, which belongs to the class of histone methyltransferases (HMTs), is overexpressed or mutated in a variety of cancer cells and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation.\\" History The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tazemetostat in January 2020, based on the results of a clinical trial (NCT02601950) enrolling 62 subjects with metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma. During the clinical trial, subjects received 800 milligrams (mg) of tazemetostat twice a day until the disease progressed or the subject reached an unacceptable level of toxicity. Tumor response assessments were performed every eight weeks during the clinical trial.

The overall response rate was 15%, with 1.6% of subjects having a complete response and 13% having a partial response.

Sources give the arrival date as either 1824 or 1825. George had worked as a gardener, in Scotland, and continued working as a gardener in Upper Canada, for the Province's richer residents, including Bishop John Strachan, Chief Justice William Campbell. He would later found a plant nursery east of the boundaries of Toronto, on land originally granted to John Small. In 1834 Leslie was one of the founders of the Toronto Horticultural Society. He married in 1836, and opened a store in Toronto, the first to be lit by gas, a novelty that attracted sightseers. His Toronto store had a small nursery, but the nursery that Leslie started in 1845, near the street now named after him, grew to and was considered the largest in Canada at the time. Leslieville, the community that grew up around his nursery, acquired a post office, and a railway station. In 1853 Leslie was appointed a magistrate.

History  The paper is the product of the merger of the Review and the Express. The Watkins Express traced its roots to the Watkins Republican, founded in June 1854. Founded by J. K. Averill, he managed it only for a single year before selling it. After passing through a series of owners it fell to Levi Gano, who made the paper a strict Republican vehicle and changed the name to the Express. The Watkins Herald, predecessor to the Review, was founded by Samuel Harvey Ferenbaugh. Born in 1846, Ferenbaugh had apprenticed at the Corning Journal, subsequently founding the Painted Post Times and the Havana Democrat.. When the Havana Democrat was moved to Watkins, the name was changed to the Watkins Herald. Despite a leasing agreement in 1893, Ferenbaugh appears to have maintained ownership of the Herald until 1896, at which point the paper was sold to John Corbett, and the name changed to the Review. In 1988, the two papers were merged, becoming the Review & Express. In 1998, the paper was purchased by the owners of the nearby Observer; the two papers maintain a shared web presence but are otherwise distinct.

Her pieces often reflect the natural world along the Columbia River, mixing traditional motifs such as condors and sturgeon with contemporary figures like airplanes. Gold has also become an environmental and cultural educator, helping to spread knowledge of her ancestral heritage and basketry skills. Gold's art is on show in museums around the world, including the High Desert Museum, Royal British Columbia Museum, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University and Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. She is recognized internationally for her work, including receiving a Community Spirit Award in 2003 and Cultural Capital Fellowship in 2004 from the First People's Fund, as well as being a 2007 NEA National Heritage Fellow. She was featured in an episode of PBS Craft in America in 2009.  Personal life  Gold grew up on the Warm Springs Reservation in central Oregon. Her mother was an accomplished beadworker, and they would visit local art museums where their ancestors' baskets were on display. As a child, Gold did not see anyone around her using traditional weaving techniques and had no idea that would one day become her career. She worked as a mathematician for nearly 17 years before she decided to change course and focus on reviving the culture and art of her people. In 1991, through the Oregon Traditional Arts Apprenticeship Program, Gold began to study the making of \\"sally bags,\\" flexible cylindrical baskets created by Wasco-Wishram people for gathering roots and medicines, as well as nuts, seeds and mushrooms. Gold diagrammed historical basket designs and learned about the stories they told, encompassing the symbolism of fishing nets, petroglyphs and other ancestral scenes. She learned the full turn twining technique used to weave the bags and has since become one of the foremost experts and teachers keeping this style alive today.

He was influential in promoting the music of Bach, and also championed French organ music contemporary to his day. He became acquainted with the most important American and European organists of his day, and upon his early death several major works were dedicated in to his memory. He was known for his superb technical ability and knowledge of organ registration, but he avoided performances intended to \\"show off\\" the organist, preferring the attention to be drawn to the music. Biography Walter Lynnwood Farnam was born on January 13, 1885 in Sutton, Quebec, Canada into a family of farmers and inventors. He was named Walter after his great-great-grandfather, who gained a fortune for a plow he had invented. However, to his friends and family he was always called \\"Lynnwood\\" or Lynn. His father was Arlington I. Farnam, a farmer and inventor who also was an amateur musician of no particular talent. His mother, Bertha Curtis n√©e Wood, was a highly skilled musician with a noted ability for memorization. He was raised on a farm in Dunham, Quebec, where both his parents had deep family ties, with the obligatory farm chores. His first musical instructor was his mother, and then from two teachers at Dunham Ladies College. Farnam gave credit to one of these teachers, George W. Cornish, as giving him the foundation for technical ability for which he became famous. The first verifiable public performance took place at the age of ten. He began giving piano lessons of his own by the age of eleven. In 1900 he was awarded the Montreal Scholarship, enabling him to attend the Royal College of Music for three years studying under James Higgs, W. S. Hoyte, F. A. Sewell, Herbert Sharpe and Franklin Taylor. He had spent three months in intense preparation for the scholarship exam, but the day of the examination and performance left him nervous. His father relieved his nerves with encouragement and by massaging Lynnwood's fingers, for which Lynnwood expressed gratitude. Because he excelled in his studies he earned an addition year of tuition at the Royal College. His first professional position as organist was at St. James Methodist Church in Montreal, which he held from 1904 to 1905. He then moved as organist to St. James the Apostle, also in Montreal, from 1905 to 1908. He was the organist of Christ Church Cathedral in Montreal from October 1908 until August 1913, and there he gave a series of annual Lenten concerts, and also directed choir performances. His final year in Montreal also saw him begin teaching organ at McGill Conservatory. While located in Montreal he made trips to Boston, playing many organs there and befriending fellow organists. He was then appointed organist and choirmaster at Emmanuel Church in Boston after an audition from which he demonstrated an ability to play from memory more than 200 pieces in his repertoire, from Bach fugues to current works. At this post he became famous in the United States, and began to acquire an international reputation as a great organist. An organ was built to his specifications which at the time of completion (1918) was the third-largest organ on the North American continent. He was personally at his happiest in Boston, where his talents were greatly appreciated, the organ he played on was built to his specifications, and where he made close personal friendships and acquired financial benefactors that lasted the rest of his life. Despite his satisfaction with Boston, Farnam felt that New York City was the cultural hub that allowed him further artistic development. That he was offered a position with thrice his current salary probably factored into his decision to leave his appointment in Boston and accept a position at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York City. Before he could fill the post he immediately resigned in order to serve in the Canadian Army. He had applied to join the Canadian army much earlier at the outset of Canadian participation in the First World War, but he had been rejected because of eye impediments. However, by 1918 the Canadian Army was enlisting men who had previously been deferred. In the Canadian Infantry he went to Wales, but ill health prevented him from going to the continent to participate in the fighting. While there he continued his organ performances. After leaving the army the position at First Presbyterian was re-extended to him and he accepted and then held residence for a year, continuing to give full concerts and weekly half-hour recitals preceding Sunday afternoon services. His tenure at this location was unpleasant for him, he was unappreciated by the congregation and had an acrimonious relationship with the music committee. In 1920 he then became organist at the Church of the Holy Communion in Manhattan's Flatiron District, which he held until the time of his death. This position suited him well. It was a small congregation but had a surplus of monetary support. The church allowed Farnam go embark on extensive worldwide tours, feeling the world in general would be the beneficiary. In June 1923 Farnam made his first performing tour of Europe, in England and France. While in France he spent time with Louis Vierne at Notre-Dame de Paris. October 1923 saw Farnam making his first radio broadcast. He commenced a second European tour May 1924, and stayed in the home of Marcel Dupr√© for a time. On February 7, 1927 he commenced a sequence of weekly all-Bach recitals at the Church of the Holy Communion in New York. In the late 1920s he toured the United States extensively, ranging from the Deep South to the Midwest to the Northwest. He gained an excellent reputation for teaching, and so became head of the organ department of the Curtis Institute of Music in 1927, where he taught weekly until the time of his death. He made organ rolls for the Aeolian company in February 1930, of particular importance in that Farnam made no phonograph recordings. The Cincinnati Conservatory of Music awarded Farnam an honorary Doctor of Music June 20, 1930. His last European tour took place the next month, July 1930. It was on this tour that Farnam began to recognize the symptoms of what would prove to be a fatal disease, losing all appetite, feeling highly lethargic, and experiencing chest pains. He sought medical treatment in August, having arrived back in the United States. By October 6 he was suffering severely. Farnam's last recital took place on October 12, 1930 at the Church of the Holy Communion. He was in pain during the concert, and was directly thereafter brought to a hospital where he was diagnosed with liver cancer. He died in New York on November 23, 1930 of the liver cancer shortly after receiving surgery for gallstones. Style Farnam was the first North American organist to play the entire repertoire of Johann Sebastian Bach's organ works, a feat not repeated until E. Power Biggs completed the cycle in September 1937. Farnam considered Bach to be the greatest writer of organ music, but had a particular fondness of French organ music from his own time, especially that of Louis Vierne. Farnam also performed programs consisting of the entire organ works of Brahms and Franck. He rarely played music that had been transcribed for organ, but performed music originally composed for it. Edward Moore of the Chicago Tribune remarked upon Farnam's rhythm, comparing the dance-ability of his performance of Handel's organ concertos to Paul Whiteman. He viewed his concerts and recitals as an extension of the church's work, and disdained \\"theatrical\\" playing in a sacred setting. Farnam learned new pieces first by playing slowly on the piano, working out precise fingering. Then he transferred the piece to a small organ at his residence, to gain the feel for the organ keyboard. Once he felt he had mastered the piece technically, he then moved to the full organ at his disposal, where he worked out the registration per the specifications of the instrument upon which he was performing. His command of registration and tone was considered unparalleled. Farnam would not improvise in public, but concentrated on bringing attention to the pieces he was performing through technical perfection without emphasizing his own virtuoso capabilities. He composed a singular piece, Toccata on 'O filii et filiae', which he used to test the sonic capabilities of the organs he was to play. Farnam was proud of his Canadian heritage, and ensured that \\"Canadian Organist\\" was placed on programs under his name. Legacy In promotional material, Farnam was described as \\"The Premiere Organist of the North American Continent\\", a claim which was never challenged in his lifetime and a reputation he held decades later. He deserves consideration in conversations regarding the greatest North American organists. Marcel Dupr√©, who considered Farnam the world's greatest organist, dedicated the first movement of 7 Pi√®ces, Op. 27, to Farnam's memory. Vierne dedicated his Organ Symphony No. 6 in B minor to Farnam. Farnam had helped popularize Vierne's Carillon de Westminster. After his death a memorial was erected at the Third Avenue Church in Saskatoon and bronze bust of Farnam by Alfred Lalibert√© was placed at Christ Church Cathedral in Montreal upon the first anniversary. Personal life Farnam never married. During his studies in London he wrote that he wished he had \\"a girl\\", but he never pursued a serious courtship. He was very close to both his parents and to his sister who was two years younger. He was also close to his Aunt Alice. Pupils of Lynnwood Farnam Farnam's several pupils included: *Arthur L.

Biography Pant Maharaj was born in a Deshastha Brahmin family to Ramachandra Pant and Sitabai (n√©e Godakka) on the 3 September 1855 in Daddi on the auspicious Hindu holiday of Krishna Janmashtami. He spent much of his infancy and early years in his father‚Äôs ancestral village of Balekundri and after his upanayana at the age of eight, moved to his mother‚Äôs ancestral village of Daddi for primary school, living with his maternal uncle. Pant Maharaj's life was marked by poverty and struggles to provide for his family members. He lived through the Great Famine of 1876‚Äì1878 and was employed as a teacher for 23 years at the London Mission School in Belgavi. He is considered to be great Hindu saint who founded a philosophy in which the nine gurus of the Avadhut sampradaya are attributed to Dattatreya.Joshi, Dr. P. N. (2000) Shri Dattatreya Dnyankosh. Pune: Shri Dattatreya Dnyankosh Prakashan. He is considered by some devotees to be an incarnation of Dattatreya. On 27 October 1892, Pant Maharaj met with his contemporary, Swami Vivekananda, during the latter's 13 day visit to Belgavi, where they conversed for several hours. Legacy The main ashram and temple dedicated to Pant Maharaj is located in the village of Balekundri on the outskirts of Belgavi. The village was informally renamed as Pant Balekundri in his honor. The temple houses the wooden shoes, or padukas, worn by him. Behind the temple is an Indian fig tree marking the spot where he was cremated and an eternal flame that has been kept burning from his funeral pyre. Annually thousands devotees of Pant Maharaj from Karnataka, Maharashtra and Goa participate in a three day event commemorating his death anniversary in the month of October. On the first day, devotees carry out a procession holding a holy flag, traversing approximately 15 kilometers from the city of Belgavi to the temple in Balekundri. On the second day, a palanquin symbolically carrying Pant Maharaj is paraded in a procession from Pant Maharaj's ancestral home to the temple. On the third day, prasƒÅda is distributed to all devotees who consume it together irrespective of caste, social standing, or wealth in accordance with Pant Maharaj's teachings. Literary works Datta Prem Lahari, meaning waves of love from Pant Maharaj, is considered to be his most seminal work. The book consists of 2,730 verses in Marathi and 27 verses in Kannada that were spontaneously composed by Pant Maharaj. The topics of these poems generally relate to praise of his guru Balmukund, expoundation of his guru‚Äôs teachings, philosophy of the Avadhut sampradaya, self-realization, the omnipresence of God, advice on day-to-day living and overcoming challenges, the importance of chanting God‚Äôs name, devotion to Dattatreya, yogic experiences, and the maya of the universe. The book was published posthumously in 1971. Written by Pant Maharaj as a guide for two other disciples, the essay Premtarang, meaning wave of love, discusses existential questions about our life, God, and reincarnation, while the parallel essay, Bodhanand Gutika describes the eight limbs of yoga. A few years after Balmukund departed for Srisailam for his mahasamadhi in 1877, Pant Maharaj authored a long essay entitled Bhaktalap. The essay narrates how he received blessings from Balmukund, how he gained the satsang of the saint Kallappa, and how he overcame challenges and grew his following of disciples. In 1885 and 1886, Pant Maharaj wrote a series of essays narrating his experiences of self-realization. In the essay Atmajyoti, Pant Maharaj describes the euphoria experienced when he attained self-realization under the guidance of Balmukund. He compares his experience to that of Arjuna in the Mahabharata and Uddhava in the Bhagavatam seeing the Vishvarupa of God. In the second essay Anubhavvalli, Pant Maharaj narrates his anubhavas or experiences in a self-realized state in a question-and-answer form. In the third essay entitled Bramhopadesh, Pant Maharaj explains the concepts of Brahman and Atman in accordance with the Vedas and Upanishads. In 1901, Pant Maharaj authored a story referred to as Prembhet or Bhaktodgar where a devotee approaches Balmukund with the desire to attain moksha through self-realization. Balmukund then proceeds to worship, bless, and enlighten the disciple, ultimately becoming spiritually one with him. In Balbodhamrutsar, Pant Maharaj authored an entire guidebook based on Balmukund‚Äôs simple advice that devotees should be of few words and behave as self-realized persons in society.

Its logo, a blue triangle on white and orange ground, comes from the international distinctive sign of civil defence,Defined in article 66 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts; June 8, 1977 which is a protective sign under the protection of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949. This voluntary association is not to be confused with the French S√©curit√© Civile, which is a government agency.  History   From Civil Defense to Civil Protection  At the end of World War I, the high number of civilian casualties highlighted the need to upgrade the protection of people during conflicts. In 1933, the first voluntary organization to protect civilians during war time was founded with the support of Gaston Doumergue. In 1938, at the dawn of World War II, the French government developed civil defense (d√©fense passive) policies. Their goal was to build blast shelters and warning networks to keep people safe from airstrikes. After the war, the d√©fense passive missions became more and more related to non military threats like natural disasters. In 1951, a national service for civil protection in the ministry of the Interior was established. This government agency then became the French S√©curit√© Civile in 1975. However, this nationalization did not hamper volunteering which developed through local civil protection societies from 1958.  Local societies and the national federation  In 1965, there were local civil protection societies in 26 departments. Following a call from Prime minister Georges Pompidou, the national federation of civil protection (F√©d√©ration nationale de protection civile) was constituted on December 14, 1965 in Paris, in order to manage these local societies and to raise popular awareness on civil defense. The first federal president was L√©on Robine. In 1968, there were local societies in 54 departments and 31,701 volunteers. One year later, a decree entitled the French Civil Protection as an association acting in the public interest. During the 1980s, the Civil Protection became the society which delivered the second highest number of first aid trainings in France. Its volunteers also led awareness campaigns on several topics such as first aid, domestic accidents, HIV or road safety. In the early 1990s, the national federation of civil protection was unifying 94 local civil protection associations, but also other societies like the French White Cross, the RATP first aid society or the national civil defense amateur radio society. Since 1993, the French Civil Protection is entitled to deliver official first aid training and certifications.  Missions broadening  From 1991 to 2009, Louis Lareng, the founder of the French emergency medical service, was elected president of the national federation of civil protection. Under his impulse, the scope of civil defense societies widened from their traditional first aid stations missions to disaster response and emergency response. Since then, the French civil protection has developed civil defense partnerships with national and local authorities.

In 2018, there were 32,000 volunteers acting in more than 500 local societies spread into 97 departments. The federation is led by a board of directors with 24 members and by Fran√ßois Richez who has been the federal president since 2019.  National level  The national federation is the organization in charge of managing the 97 societies spread in metropolitan and overseas departments. Headquarters are located in Asni√®res-sur-Seine.  Departmental and local levels  In each department, there can only be one association labeled by the national federation as a \\"departmental association of civil protection\\" (association d√©partementale de protection civile, or ADPC). Each departmental association is in charge of one or several local societies (antennes) which are the operational units of the organization. For historical reasons, there is only one departmental association for the departments of Paris, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne. In overseas territories, departmental associations can have different names, like the Polynesian federation of civil protection (f√©d√©ration polyn√©sienne de protection civile) from French Polynesia. However, their organization is the same as in Metropolitan France. The French Civil Protection has no local association in some departments like Ardennes, Corse- du-Sud, Haute-Corse, Haute-Loire, Eure, Loz√®re or French Guyana.  Protection Civile Paris Seine  The Protection Civile Paris Seine (PCPS) is the departmental association for Paris, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne. Its history and status are specific. Until 1998, the Paris Police Prefecture was hiring temporary and volunteer rescuers in the interdepartmental civil protection service (service interd√©partemental de protection civile). Their missions included emergency response for the Paris Fire Brigade. Then the service was disbanded and replaced by the Civil Protection of Paris, a local society managed by the National Federation of Civil Protection. It was then renamed Protection Civile Paris Seine. There are 840 volunteers in 18 local societies (Centre, 5e, 6e, 10e, 11e, 12e, 13e, 14e, 15e, 16e, 17e, 18e, 19e, 20e, Pantin, Montreuil, Vincennes and Gentilly), operating a fleet of 19 ambulances, 17 boats, 16 light vehicles, 3 logistic vehicles and 1 mobile headquarters vehicle.  Missions  The French Civil protection has a government certification to carry 4 types of missions: *first aid stations management; *first aid training; * humanitarian and social support; *emergency and disaster response.  First aid stations  Provisional first aid stations (dispositifs pr√©visionnels de secours) are established during cultural, political or sportive events to provide medical first response to the participants. In 2016, the French Civil Protection carried 18,200 first aid stations. There are different configurations to adapt to the scale of the event: # warning and first aid station: 2 certified first responders; # small scale provisional first aid station: 4 to 12 certified first responders; # medium scale provisional first aid station: 13 to 36 certified first responders; # large scale provisional first aid station: at least 37 certified first responders.  Notable first aid stations  The list below gives examples of notable first aid stations carried by the French Civil Protection: * The Bayonne Festival; * The Paris International Marathon; * The Vieilles Charrues Festival; * The 2018 FIFA World Cup Final Fan Fest in Paris.  First aid training  The French Civil Protection delivers public basic first aid training (pr√©vention et secours civiques de niveau 1, or PSC1). The association is also entitled to train its own members to become Certified First Responder at PSE1 and PSE2 levels. Specialized trainings as nautical first aid are also delivered. In 2016, 2,600 certified trainers from the French Civil Protection trained 110,000 people to first aids.  Humanitarian and social support  The French Civil Protection is entitled to carry a broad scope of humanitarian and support missions including assistance to the homeless and post-disaster response. In 1999, the Federation contributed to an international humanitarian operation to support refugees from the Kosovo war by managing the Stenkovec refugee camp in Macedonia.  Emergency response  The √éle-de-France, Bas-Rhin and Nord local societies are entitled to take part in emergency and disaster response missions for the prefectures, the French emergency medical service and the fire services.  Notable missions  French Civil Protection teams participated in the emergency response after the 1999 MV Erika sinking, the 2001 Toulouse chemical factory explosion and the 2015 Germanwings Flight 9525 crash. During the November 2015 Paris attacks, 130 first responders contributed to manage the crisis, to evacuate the victims to local hospitals, and to provide first aid to the witnesses. After the 2016 Nice truck attack, 162 volunteers provided emergency response and psychological first aid to the victims, their relatives and witnesses.  Equipment   Vehicles  In 2016, the Federation owned a fleet of 1,230 vehicles, including 400 ambulances, light vehicles, boats, mobile headquarters vehicles, off-road vehicles and bicycles. The vehicles are white, with a large orange line on which the Federation logo is displayed and the words \\"PROTECTION CIVILE\\" are written in blue. Thin blue lines surround the orange line, except in Paris. As the French Civil Protection is certified for emergency response missions, its vehicles can be entitled to have blue emergency vehicle lighting and a two-tone siren.

One of the founders of the school medical service, she became the medical officer for the government school and is credited with eradicating scabies in the education system. Early life Irene Condachi was born in Malta on 7 June 1899. Her family were recent migrants to the island from Greece and her father, Constanino Condachi was a merchant. She was raised in the Greek Orthodox tradition, which had a more tolerant attitude to women working outside the home. In 1916, she began her medical studies at the University of Malta, but left after one year. A decade later, she graduated as a medical doctor from the University of Naples. Continuing her studies, Condachi received a specialist's degree in paediatrics in 1928 from the University of Pavia. Career Returning to Malta after completing her studies, Condachi became an assistant to Joseph Ellul, the professor in charge of Midwifery and Gynaecology at the University of Malta in Valletta. In 1938, she was hired as the medical officer of the government school, and made her home on Luzio Street in Sliema. At the onset of war, with many men joining up to fight, women became more involved in the defense services for the island. Along with an ophthalmologist and a dentist, Condachi began the school medical service. Lacking transportation, she walked or hitched rides to visit the various schools of the island to inoculate and perform medical examinations on over 20,000 school children between 1941 and 1942. She was responsible for eradicating scabies in the government schools using a petroleum-based ointment. The conditions of her work were dangerous, as in 1941, government schools were converted into hospitals and refugee centers. While overseeing the hospital in the government school at Qormi, the facility was bombed and Condachi, her staff, refugees and students narrowly escaped to an underground shelter beneath the girls' school. One of only two women doctors known to have practiced in Malta during the war, Condachi continued as the Ministry of Education's medical officer until 1959. She was the highest-paid woman in government service in her era. Death and legacy Condachi died in 1970 and is remembered for her long career in providing medical service to Malta. In 2014, Simon Cusens completed his master's degree, \\"the first academic work\\" on the topic of Maltese women's history during World War II. During his research, he discovered Condachi's story which was to be included in a 2016 book.

Education  Margaret Spencer was born on October 4, 1857, in St. Catharines, Ontario, the daughter of Margaret and Abraham Spencer. Spencer began her schooling at St. George's and later St. Catherine's Collegiate Institute, before she studied for a teaching degree at Lincoln County Model School beginning in 1877. Her first position as a teacher after gaining her certification was at School Section Number One, Port Severn, in 1878. Spencer enrolled in the Toronto Normal School in January 1879 to gain further credentials, gaining a second-class teaching certificate in June 1879. She gained another teaching position after the family relocated to Port Colborne in 1880.  Photographic career  Shorty Dunn ‚Äì photograph by Mary Spencer During her time in Port Colborne, Spencer developed her skills in oil painting and had also taken up photography. She and her mother Margaret and sister Isobel relocated to Kamloops, British Columbia, in 1898, and she quickly established a photography studio. Spencer opened her photography studio in KamloopsInland Sentinel, 1899 June 22 on June 25, 1899, also offering oil painting classes.Inland Sentinel, 1899 August 22 In 1903, she bought property at 218 Victoria Street and hired an architect to construct a new studio with living quarters above. Her portraits became popular amongst Kamloops notables and many of her scenic images of the Kamloops area were made into postcards and souvenir books. In May 1906, Spencer was hired by the Vancouver Daily Province to cover the capture and trial of train bandit Bill Miner and his gang, increasing her reputation as a photojournalist. She managed to obtain a series of images of the capture of the gang, even being allowed to photograph the gang during initial questioning and in the courtroom.Eight Women Photographers of British Columbia 1860-1978, by Myrna Cobb and Sher Morgan Her mug shots of Bill Miner, William \\"Shorty\\" Dunn, and Louis Colquhuon were published in the local newspaper, the Kamloops Standard.

WalkerInland Sentinel, 1909 September 24 and moved to Summerland to run the orchard with her sister. It is unclear whether Spencer re-established a full photography studio in Summerland, as photographs from that era evidence more family oriented topics, but she continued her artistic endeavors by painting china, was active in the Baptist Church community, and assisted Isobel with cultivating their orchard.

It includes historical fire equipment and other artifacts from the former Hindmarsh Fire Brigade, dating back to the 1880s. The building was a fire station from 1890 to 1925. According to the South Australia heritage register or whatever, \\"The congregation of the former Christian Chapel traced its roots to a small band of Christians, for a time presided over by Pastor Thomas Playford, patriarch of the Playford family, who erected a non-denominational Christian Chapel fronting Lindsay Circus (site of the soccer stadium) c.1845. The chapel was altered, possibly in the 1850s, but may incorporate parts of the original building. It was superseded by a new church across the street in 1876. While the building has been substantially altered it has important historical ties to the founding years of Hindmarsh village. The building was subsequently used as a school and meeting hall and by the Hindmarsh Volunteer Fire Brigade from 1890 to 1925, when they moved into a new building in front of it. The Metropolitan Fire Brigade used the buildings 1942-1957. The Hindmarsh Historical Society has occupied the site since 1969. The chapel is of most significance for its religious links with a relatively rare type of congregation and for dating from the earliest years of the Colony's first (1838) secondary town. Its siting on Lindsay Circus, intended to be the focus of the early village, is also significant. As at 1997, this building and its successor across the road are the only non- denominational chapels that are State Heritage Places. The 1925 Fire Brigade building is notable for its association with the State's longest serving volunteer fire brigade.\\" It has also been known as Hindmarsh Historical Society Museum.

Plot Homer Simpson picks up \\"chicken\\" nuggets at Krusty Burger's drive-through and eats them while singing a parody of Jim Croce's \\"Operator (That's Not the Way It Feels)\\" about the meal. His distracted driving and eating, continue to the Springfield nuclear plant. At the entrance the car jerks as it hits a speed-bump sending the nuggets airborne from the dashboard, with one lodging in his throat. Still driving, he tries dislodging the food by thrusting himself against the steering wheel, and somehow the car itself becomes airborne, and upside down. The car crashes into Mr. Burns' office while Burns is showing Waylon Smithers the only Faberg√© chicken, based on the eggs of the same name, Burns fires Homer. At home Marge Simpson scolds Homer as time lapses and his beard grows, she insists he has to find a new job. Just as Homer shares his new passion, watching Korean soap operas, a television news item for a startup company, CarGo, airs including a press event where Mayor Quimby touts the jobs that will benefit the city. At CarGo, Homer interviews to be a \\"highly passive human\\" road tester of their self-driving autonomous vehicle. The company founders see his bad driving record as an asset, and he gets the job after passing their final test, sitting for hours doing nothing. He is hired and in a montage his work amounts to enjoying various activities ‚Äîincluding a second parody of \\"Operator (That's Not the Way It Feels)\\"‚Äîwhile the self-driving cars road test themselves. One day after work, Marge arrives at CarGo to drive him home, and they stop by the company's cafeteria for some b√°nh m√¨ to take with him. When told all the food is free, Homer binges (while the music \\"Pure Imagination\\" from the 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory plays). Marge is impressed with the high- tech campus, and Homer gives her a tour of the high-tech campus, they note recreational employee perks like a rock-climbing wall, and game room go unused because the coders never stop working. Marge says \\"we should help them enjoy themselves\\". They call the nerds to join them instigating a foosball tournament, which the founders see as a \\"paradigm-blasting\\", team-building exercise which invigorates creativity. The founders want CarGo to be the leader in employee satisfaction, so promote Homer, and make him and Marge a team to help the other employees have fun, forgetting they want or have families. At CarGo, Marge and Homer talk employees into trying out the company's regulation ice hockey rink, but none of them can skate. Marge solves the problem by having them use office chairs which is a hit. Homer videophones the activity to Lenny and Carl, who become the start of a mass exodus of employees who quit the nuclear plant to work for a fun employer. In response, Burns and Smithers work undercover at CarGo, where Burns commends the success of making the workplace pleasant so no one wants to leave, without raising their salaries. Meanwhile, Marge and Homer head home in a CarGo vehicle, but realize it listens to them and takes them to buy things they randomly talk about. They report the problem to the founders, but are told it is a part of CarGo's Sponsored Rides program selling users' data to corporations, and that this insider information is covered by the non-disclosure agreement. Horrified, Homer quits and vows to sue the company. Back at home, Homer is conflicted about the unethical manipulation, but Marge loves their fun jobs. He goes to Moe's Tavern, and is surprised Burns is there, delivered to the bar because Burns said one of the phrases from Moe's keyword optimization list with CarGo. Homer, Burns, and Smithers team up to stop the cars to end the company. With their CarGo credentials, they breach the main computer server room where Smithers works to reconfigure the deep neural network and disable the cars' fuel cells, but Marge confronts them. After pleading with Homer not to destroy the fun she is having, she goes to report the situation to the founders but notices CarGo's next phase, Sponsored Lives, an effort to use the cars' keychain fob to eavesdrop everywhere the keys go, even the bathroom. Marge decides the company really should be shut down, and helps Smithers do so back in the server room. After the cars shut down, Springfielders are relieved and CarGo is bankrupted. Homer asks Burns to consider hiring him and Marge to work together at the plant, but Burns refuses and angrily begins to remember why Homer was fired until Marge shoots him in the head with a toy Nerf bazooka dart, causing him to forget. In the epilogue, the founders cite CarGo as a \\"bump in the road\\", and announce to their employees a new way to reach consumers: multi-lingual talking tattoos. During the closing credits, a scene from earlier in the episode shows Homer and Marge putting their CarGo car in \\"snuggle mode\\". They begin to make love in the car until it stops at the church, much to Reverend Lovejoy's frustration. Reception \\"Baby You Can't Drive My Car\\" scored a 1.9 rating with a 7share and was watched by 5.08 million people, making \\"The Simpsons\\" Fox's highest rated show of the night. Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode a4 out of5 points ranking, stating the episode is \\"maybe the closest to a classic 'The Simpsons' have offered in a long time. It is purely episodic. The subtle tweaks at the ruling class are timely, and the struggles at the center of it are universal. It's all about jobs. It's the economy, stupid. 'Baby You Can't Drive My Car' works specifically because the workplace is what we all have in common. Left, right and center, we all line up to earn a paycheck. We all want the perfect job. Many people have to drive to work, so we want the perfect car. Whether we like smoothies or not, we could all agree it would be fun to be able to make them while driving. In a driverless car society, the only thing to worry about is real drivers. This reviewer would like to know what the DWI laws will be, because a lot of cars ride on ethanol and, having drunk ethanol on the advice of Moe the bartender, it can be quite impairing.\\" Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, stating that \\"Homer is the one who gets up in arms about the data-mining, while Marge, swept up in all the good their joint venture is having on their marriage, at first decides that a company secretly stealing every scrap of Spiringfielders' personal information is an insignificant price to pay. 'I can't be the ethical one!' protests Homer at one point, and, well, he's got a point. It's sweet to see Marge and Homer dancing a graceful waltz in a virtual reality ballroom, and Marge's anguished excuse that 'we were having so much fun!' is pretty heartbreaking when you think about it. But the conflict just doesn't land, and when Marge (horrified that CarGo plans to extend the listening-in to the cars' key fob‚Äîeven in the powder room) finally decides to help Smithers, Burns, and Homer's sabotage, it's too thin a motivation.\\" Screen Rant called it the best episode of the 30th season.

It is based on the book The Best of Enemies: Race and Redemption in the New South by Osha Gray Davidson, which focuses on the rivalry between civil rights activist Ann Atwater and Ku Klux Klan leader C. P. Ellis. The film stars Taraji P. Henson, Sam Rockwell, Babou Ceesay, Anne Heche, Wes Bentley, Bruce McGill, John Gallagher Jr., and Nick Searcy. It was released in the United States on April 5, 2019, by STX Entertainment.  Plot  1971: at Durham, in North Carolina, Ann Atwater tries to get better housing conditions for poor black people, and is ignored by the all white judge panel. C.P. is the president of the KKK, and has a family with children. It's shown that he loves and cares for his family. Ann's daughter's school catches on fire (whether by accident or arson is unclear), and C.P. is afraid that the black children will come to the white schools. Bill Riddick sets up a meeting with the both of them, to arrange charrettes to discuss segregation and other issues. At first, both of them refuse since they hate each other, but then they are convinced. C.P. is a proud racist and refuses to even sit with Bill and Ann, since they are black and he is white. They agree to pick some people randomly from the group to vote on the issues at the end of the meeting sessions. C.P tries to talk to these selected to vote, but is mostly rebuffed. A black reverend asks Bill if he can play gospel music at the end of each session. C.P. hotly refuses, saying that if the blacks want to sing gospel music at the charrette, he should be allowed to put out his KKK items to display. Ann refuses, but Bill agrees. At one meeting, a group of black teenagers try to destroy the KKK items, but Ann stops them and tells them to instead understand what the KKK is. All this is observed by C.P. from afar. Then Bill makes the blacks and whites in their group sit next to each other in the cafeteria and eat. He makes C.P and Ann sit together alone. They eat in tense silence, then Ann asks C.P. if he has a boy in Murdock. C.P. hotly says that he won't talk about his boy. Murdock is a facility that takes care of disabled boys, and his son has Down Syndrome. C.P. is called to Murdock, and he rushes over. His disabled son, Larry, has been put in the same room with another disabled boy. The other boy is screaming, upsetting Larry. C.P. demands that his son be placed in a room of his own, but the nurses there tell him that he can't afford it. Later, Ann visits Larry and asks a favor from Bernadette, who works there to put Larry in his own room. Bill takes Ann, C.P., and the rest of their group to visit the black school that was burned. C.P. is shocked by how dark and smelly it is, thanks to the damage. Ann's daughter says hi to Ann, but looks at C.P like he's evil when she finds out who he is. C.P.'s wife, Mary, is overjoyed with Ann's help, and goes to visit her to thank her. Ann asks her if C.P. has always been racist, and Mary says yes. The night before the final vote, C.P.'s KKK troublemaking friends go and threaten the selected voters to vote for segregation. C.P. finds out about this and is dismayed. Ann also finds about it and screams at C.P., calling him a coward. During the voting, all the issues pass, coming down to the final issue of desegregation. One by one, the voters vote. Ann votes for it, and C.P., surprising everyone, does the same, realizing the KKK is hateful. Also, he makes a speech and rips up his KKK membership card, much to the fury of his watching KKK friends. They threaten him and try to set the gas station that he owns on fire but C.P. puts it out. Now that the white community won't buy his gas anymore, his station is going out of business. Ann and Bill visit him with smiles and they bring in the black community to buy from him instead. It is revealed that the real life Ann and C.P. went around to different cities together, to talk about their experiences and remained friends to the end of C.P.'s life, with Ann giving the eulogy at his funeral.

It stars Jamie Foxx, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Dominique Fishback, alongside Colson Baker, Rodrigo Santoro, Amy Landecker and Allen Maldonado, and follows a drug dealer, a police officer, and a former soldier who team up to stop the distribution of a pill that gives the user superpowers for five minutes. The film was released on August 14, 2020, by Netflix. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances of the cast, action sequences and visuals but criticized the screenplay for not taking full advantage of its premise.  Plot  In near-future New Orleans, a mysterious distributor offers a free supply of ‚ÄúPower‚Äù‚Äìa pill that grants various superpowers for five minutes‚Äìto a group of drug dealers, including one named Newt. Six weeks later, Newt's teenage cousin Robin, a dealer herself, is nearly robbed by customers seeking Power. She is rescued by NOPD Officer Frank Shaver, one of her regular buyers. Art, a man hunting for the distributor ‚ÄúBiggie‚Äù, tracks down Newt, who dies after a struggle when he overdoses on Power. Frank foils a bank robbery by a Power-enhanced thief, but is suspended for using Power himself. His captain reveals that government personnel are pressuring him to terminate any investigation into Power, and gives Frank a picture of the man they suspect to be the source of the drug: Art. Using Newt‚Äôs phone to find and abduct Robin, Art forces her to take him to the drug cartel's safehouse. He is shot while eliminating several of the cartel's men, and discovers that Power users throughout New Orleans are being monitored as test subjects for the drug. Art bonds with Robin as they treat his wounds, and reveals that after leaving the military, he was recruited by Teleios, a private defense contractor who experimented on him to create superpowers. His daughter Tracy, born after the experiments, exhibited powers without ever taking the drug, and was abducted by Wallace, a Teleios operative. Art and Robin find Biggie hosting a private demonstration of Project Power for a potential buyer near the Superdome, where large groups of Saints fans are arriving for a home game. Biggie claims that Power represents ‚Äúthe next evolution of the human species‚Äù, with the pill‚Äôs powers derived from the abilities of animals, such as the chameleon or the wolverine frog. Art interrogates Biggie at gunpoint and learns of a ship, the Genesis, but Frank intervenes, having tracked other users to the demonstration. Biggie takes a dose of Power, forcing Art, Robin, and Frank to flee as Art kills Biggie in an explosion. Frank arrests Art and informs his captain, but Art explains that the Power epidemic in New Orleans is mass testing to stabilize the drug, and that Tracy is the source of the drug‚Äôs powers. Having convinced Frank that his captain is actually taking orders from Teleios, Art purposely has himself captured by Teleios and taken aboard the Genesis. Frank and Robin infiltrate the ship, and Art persuades a guard to free him. Frank and Art kill Wallace, while Robin finds Tracy and reunites her with her father. As the four attempt to flee, Robin is captured by Dr. Gardner, the head of Project Power, who demands Tracy in exchange for Robin‚Äôs life. Art confronts Gardner, revealing that Power gives him the abilities of a pistol shrimp, which he uses to kill Gardner and her men and rescue Robin. Using his power costs Art his life, but Tracy resurrects him with her own powers, and they all escape the ship. Frank intends to expose Project Power to the press, while Art decides to move on. He gives Robin his truck and a bag full of money to cover her mother's medical needs, telling her to use the greatness inside of her. Art and Tracy depart, finally free. Meanwhile, Robin begins a new career as a rapper. Cast * Jamie Foxx as Art; a Major in Delta Force and one of Power's original test subjects, he possesses the ability inherited from a pistol shrimp, thus being able to launch powerful heatwaves from his body. However, he goes into a coma- like state as his powers take a toll on him. * Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Frank Shaver; a New Orleans Police Department cop. He receive Power that hardens his skin, effectively making him bulletproof. This ability is probably inherited from an armadillo and does not give invulnerability, but just lowers the amount of damage received to the point Frank does not receive any serious injuries. His ability also gives him a strength boost. * Dominique Fishback as Robin Reilly; a street-smart Power dealer who aspires to be a rap artist. * Colson Baker as Newt; Robin's cousin and fellow Power dealer, who possesses the ability of thermal regulation that allows him to generate fire from his body. However, this ability only offers him limited fire resistance, leaving him with serious burns on his body from overuse. He dies after overdosing on the drug, causing him to self-detonate. * Rodrigo Santoro as Biggie; one of Power's creators, who possesses the ability to rapidly increase in size and strength. *Amy Landecker as Gardner. *Allen Maldonado as Landry. *Kyanna Simone Simpson as Tracy; Art's daughter who possess the ability to heal organic matter, her powers were inherited from her father and come naturally. *Andrene Ward-Hammond as Irene. *Courtney B.

Downside is that he receives damage as usual since he does not have an ability to protect his body from taking damage. He died after receiving two shotgun shots in the chest from Art. *Yoshi Sudarso as Knifebones; a henchman of Gardner's who possesses the ability of turning his bones into weapons, power inherited from a hairy frog. *Jane Chika Oranika as Akeela; Robin's classmate. *Jazzy De Lisser as Candy; Moto's girlfriend who was given a pill to test it out. She inherited an ability of thermal regulation, but instead of Newt's immolation, she can lower the temperature of her own body and her surroundings to extremely low temperatures. However, like Newt, she only received limited cold resistance and eventually freezes to death after the experiment chamber was damaged. *Cory Demeyers as Griff; a Power user and bank robber, that Frank pursues. He inherited the ability of skin camouflage from an octopus. *Azhar Khan as Guello; one of the drug dealers standing higher in the chain after Robin. Art asks Robin to go to him to find information of the one who kidnapped his daughter. He inherited an ability of spontaneous regeneration, allowing him to heal with increased speed from a lizard.

Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney said that \\"what makes Project Power entertaining is its canny combination of familiar ingredients in a textured real-world milieu that gives it fresh flavor.\\" Kate Erbland of IndieWire gave the film a \\"C+\\" and said that \\"Project Power wrestles with a litany of thorny moral issues (and not only those of the 'great power, great responsibility' vibe) but never fully engages with them.

Hatch‚ÄìBob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act, or Music Modernization Act or MMA (, ) is United States legislation signed into law on October 11, 2018 aimed to modernize copyright-related issues for music and audio recordings due to new forms of technology such as digital streaming. It is a consolidation of three separate bills introduced during the 115th United States Congress.  Enjoined bills  The MMA is a combination of three bills previously introduced in Congress. The three bills became the three titles of the final act.  Title I: Music Modernization Act  This is the Act first introduced into the House by Rep. Bob Goodlatte on December 17, 2017 (), and later to the Senate by Sen. Orrin Hatch on January 24, 2018. Both versions of the bill looked to improve how music licensing and royalties would be paid in consideration of streaming media services. The bill established three major provisions: # It would set up a non-profit governing agency that would create a database related to the owners of the mechanical license of musical works - the copyright that covers the composition and lyrics of a song; the actual performance and recording of the song is typically held under a different license. This musical works database would be completed with help of the major music publishers. The new agency would establish blanket royalty rates that would be used to pay the composers and songwriters when used by streaming services using this database, eliminating the difficulty previously faced by streaming services to properly identify the mechanical license holder. These royalties would be paid to the non-profit agency as a compulsory license, not requiring the mechanical license holder's permission; the agency would then be responsible for distributing the royalties. Streaming services would still be able to negotiate other royalty rates directly with the mechanical license owner if they so chose. # It assures that songwriters are paid a portion of mechanical license royalties for either physical or digital reproduction of a song with their lyrics, at a rate set by contract. # It revamps the rate court process when disagreements over royalty rates arise. Previously, a single judge in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York was assigned to handle all cases; the bill would assign a random judge in this Court to oversee these cases. In addition, elements of the \\"Fair Play Fair Pay Act\\", , introduced on March 30, 2017 by Rep. Jerrold Nadler, were added to this Title. The Fair Play Fair Pay Act had been designed to harmonize how royalties were paid by terrestrial radio broadcasters and Internet streaming services. Under previous law, songwriters and composers would receive mechanical license royalties for radio play, but the performing artists would not be paid as the use of songs on the radio was considered \\"promotional\\". The Fair Play Fair Pay Act had included language that would allow recording artists to receive performance royalties. However, these parts of the Fair Play Fair Pay Act were not included in the combined Music Modernization Act.  Title II: CLASSICS Act  The Compensating Legacy Artists for their Songs, Service, and Important Contributions to Society (CLASSICS) Act was originally introduced in the House as in July 2017. In US Copyright Law, sound recordings made prior to February 15, 1972 were not covered under federal copyright law, leaving them up to the individual states to pass laws for recording protection. This had created a complex series of laws that made it difficult for copyright enforcement and royalty payments. The CLASSICS Act established that sound recording before 1972 are covered by copyright until February 15, 2067, with additional language to grandfather older songs into the public domain at an earlier time. Recordings prior to 1923 will enter the public domain three years from passage (January 1, 2022, as all U.S. copyright terms end on December 31), with recordings between 1923 and 1956 being phased into the public domain over the next few decades.  Title III: Allocation for Music Producers Act  The Allocation for Music Producers (AMP) Act bill was introduced by Rep. Joseph Crowley on February 6, 2017 as . The bill designates that SoundExchange, the non-profit organization established by Congress to distribute royalties on sound recordings, will also distribute part of those royalties to \\"a producer, mixer, or sound engineer who was part of the creative process that created [the] sound recording\\". Lobbying from the recording industry On April 1, 2014, Neil Portnow, the President and CEO of The Recording Academy, began calling for the music industry to combine lobbying efforts with the goal of passing new legislation and regulatory reform. The following day he gave a speech to lawmakers at Grammys on the Hill calling for unity legislation. On June 10, 2014, Portnow testified before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet. On January 8, 2018, representatives from numerous sections of the music industry united to join The Recording Academy's push for comprehensive music reform, including RIAA, NMPA, NSAI, and ASCAP. Passage Trump signs the act on October 11, 2018 The three bills were consolidated in the House by Goodlatte on April 10, 2018 as , which passed the bill on April 25, 2018. Hatch introduced the combined bill in the Senate as on May 10, 2018. During the Senate's review, the body voted to move the bill to an existing, unrelated bill, , which the House agreed to. The Senate voted in favor of the bill on September 19, 2018, and was subsequently signed into law by President Donald Trump on October 11, 2018. Among those in attendance at the signing were musicians Kid Rock, Mike Love, Sam Moore, John Rich, Craig Morgan and Jeff Baxter, and the Christian band MercyMe. While Kanye West had been reported to be attending the signing, he was not present though had a luncheon with President Trump later that day. Reactions The bills in both House and Senate had bipartisan support, as well as strong support from numerous music industry groups representing musicians, producers, and publishers, as well as from digital streaming media services and related industry groups. Digital streaming platforms Apple Music and Spotify had both come under prior separate legal actions for unpaid royalties for streaming music in part due to a lack of a central database with which to track down songwriters and composers, and had even set aside part of their working capital to deal with legal issues in order to offer full music catalogs, in contrast to Amazon.com's music selection. There was a last-minute conflict in the Senate, brought up by SESAC and SiriusXM, relating to royalties for pre-1972 sound recordings, but a deal was made between SiriusXM, the National Music Publishers Association and the Recording Industry Association of America which allowed the bill to be passed by the Senate by a unanimous vote, allowing the bill to quickly pass through Congress via \\"hotlining\\" before the end of the session. When the House MMA bill was introduced in December 2017, it included a provision that liabilities for streaming companies would be limited to infractions after January 1, 2018, a clause that remained through the final passed bill. On December 31, 2017, Wixen Music Publishing, representing artists like Tom Petty and Neil Young, filed a lawsuit against Spotify to seek unpaid royalties for their artists' songs, asking for in damages. The suit was filed to be able to recover damages for infractions that occurred before the MMA's January 1, 2018 date. This suit was ultimately settled out of court by December 2018 for an undisclosed sum. Legal challenges One of the first high-profile legal challenges to the MMA was raised in a lawsuit from Eminem's publisher Eight Mile Style against Spotify, asserting that Spotify has allowed Eminem's music to be streamed without paying the proper royalties, as the service lists some of these works under \\"Copyright control\\" with no known owner. While the suit's primary complaint is with Spotify, the suit further argued that part of the law, limiting liabilities to those after January 1, 2018, was unconstitutional since it provides no proper compensation for the work that was taken from the publisher, against the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

Students are those who are identified as leaders from groups typically underrepresented in STEM fields. In 2018, Kimber was one of six recipients of the prestigious Clare Booth Luce Scholarship to attend the HERS (Higher Education Resource Services) Institute. Quilting Kimber began quilting in 2005, soon after completing her application for tenure at Lafayette, and her interest in quilting was renewed in 2007 by the death of her father. In 2008 she began creating highly politicized quilts and blogging about them, beginning with a series of quilts inspired by George Carlin's seven dirty words and by racist and sexist graffiti on her college campus. Her work has been associated with the \\"modern Quilting\\" movement, based on its geometric design and provocative content. Her work includes varied subject matter that raise social issues including the killing of African Americans and sexual assault. Kimber's quilts are frequently included at quilting shows and museum exhibits of quilting. The Paul Mellon Arts Center put up a show of her works in 2018. One of her quilts inspired by the death of Eric Garner won first place at QuiltCon West in 2016, and was included with other pieces by Kimber in a show on \\"Quilts and Human Rights\\" at the Pick Museum of Anthropology at Northern Illinois University. As well as quilting, Kimber has also exhibited quilting-inspired works of mathematical origami.

It was found in Stonegate, York, before 1823, and is now in the Yorkshire Museum. Discovery The statue was presented to the museum of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society (latterly the Yorkshire Museum) in 1823 by James Atkinson, who had acquired the artefact following the excavation of ‚Äòa drain in Stonegate‚Äô. Stonegate is a medieval street in York which overlays the via praetoria of the Roman legionary fortress of Eboracum and it is possible that the complete statue originally stood within this area. Description The head is a fragment of a larger, twice life sized, statue of the Emperor Constantine the Great. It stands to a height of 42 cm, and is 27 cm wide and 30 cm deep. It measures 17.5 cm in diameter at the base of the neck as it now survives. The face is clean shaven and he wears a corona civica.The axis of the neck suggests that the face had originally been turned slightly to the left and down towards an audience below. Although the material was originally identified as Magnesian Limestone it has been subsequently re-identified as a coarse crystalline marble, of possible Italian origin. Significance A 2018 paper argues that the bust was remodelled from a statue of an earlier, deified emperor, probably Hadrian. It argues, through a re-analysis of the image, especially the use of the corona civica, granted to Constantine only after the civil war in Italy against Maxentius had come to an end, that this recarving occurred after AD 312 and not, as widely believed, at the moment of Constantine's proclamation as emperor in York in AD 306. Public display The head of Constantine on display in the Yorkshire Museum in 2012 The statue has formed part of the displays of the Yorkshire Museum since its opening in 1830. The 2006 exhibition Constantine the Great: York's Roman Emperor, which featured the head as its central piece, was described as \\"the most important archaeological-historical loan exhibition to have been held in a provincial British museum\\". The curator Elizabeth Hartley was \\"the driving force\\" behind the exhibition, which attracted over 58,000 visitors. In 2010 the Yorkshire Museum reopened after a twelve-month closure for redevelopment. The new exhibition, \\"Roman York - Meet the People of the Empire\\" features the head as a central piece of the display. In 2013 the head was loaned to exhibitions in Milan and the Colosseum to mark the 1700th anniversary of the Edict of Milan, returning to York in September of that year. From July to October 2016, the bust was featured in an exhibition about Constantine's father Constantius I titled \\"Constantius: York's Forgotten Emperor\\", which centred on the Wold Newton Hoard.

Ralph is a visible and infrared imager and spectrometer to provide maps of relevant astronomical targets based on data from that hardware. Ralph has two major subinstruments, LEISA and MVIC.OVERVIEW OF THE NEW HORIZONS SCIENCE PAYLOAD MVIC stands for Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera and is a color imaging device, while LEISA originally stood for Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array and is an infrared imaging spectrometer for spaceflight.Weaver, et al - Overview of the New Horizons Science Payload LEISA observes 250 discrete wavelengths of infrared light from 1.25 to 2.5 micrometers.FEATURED IMAGE: A Look From LEISA MVIC is a pushbroom scanner type of design with seven channels, including red, blue, near-infrared (NIR), and methane. Overview Ralph is one of seven major instruments aboard New Horizons which was launched in 2006 and flew-by the dwarf planet Pluto in 2015. At Pluto, Ralph enables the observation of many aspects including: *geology of Pluto *form *structure *surface composition *surface temperature Ralph and Alice were used to characterize the atmosphere of Pluto in 2015. Ralph was previously used to observe the planet Jupiter and its moons in 2006 and in 2007 when it flew-by en route out of the Solar System and past Pluto. Observations of Jupiter were taken with Ralph in February 2007, when New Horizons was about 6 million kilometers (nearly 4 million miles) from the giant. Ralph was used to take color images of Arrokoth during the New Horizons flyby on January 1, 2019.New Horizons explores the Kuiper Belt Ralph, in conjunction with the LORRI telescope, will be used to make a digital elevation map of the body. A version of Ralph is planned for the developmental Lucy spacecraft, which is targeting several Jupiter trojans and an asteroid and for visitation in the 2020s. The developers of that spacecraft noted in particular Ralph's ability to observe visible and infrared light by splitting the light stream, and thus analyze two spectrums of light at the same time. Naming Ralph Ralph is named after a character in The Honeymooners (1950s television show), along with another New Horizons instrument, Alice. LEISA's acronym was retitled from Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array to Lisa Hardaway Infrared Mapping Spectrometer by NASA in June 2017, after Ralph's program manager. Lisa Hardaway was an aerospace engineer and New Horizon's Ralph instrument program manager who died in January 2017 at the age of 50. Hardaway was honored with Engineer of the Year for 2015-2016 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (Rocky Mountain Section) and Women In Aerospace organization awarded her a leadership award in 2015. In the summer of 2017, NASA renamed the LEISA channel in her honor. Methane observations An example of Ralph's abilities is shown by this detection of methane on the surface of Pluto(left), overlaid on an image from the reconnaissance camera instrument on the right: LORRI image of dwarf planet Pluto (right) LEISA channel data, showing its lower definition infrared image of Pluto but with recorded infrared spectra of the dwarf planet in false color. Two infrared spectra are shown, from the outlined regions in the global map to the left. 1 Micron is 1000 nm, and visible light is below 1 Micron. In 2018 it was announced, based on New Horizons high resolution data, that some of the plains of Pluto have dunes made of methane ice granules. The dunes are thought to have been formed by the blowing winds of Pluto, which are not as dense as those of Earth, and were compared to Dunes elsewhere in the Solar System such as on Saturn's moon Titan.

These channels have a resolution of 5024x32 pixels, with the larger direction providing the swath of the image. There are seven channels, with 6 used for time delay integration imaging and the seventh with an array of 5024x128 for navigation framing. MVIC has a field of view that is 5.8 degrees wide The framing channel with 5024x128 pixel size, is panchromatic and a field of view of 5.7 degrees x 0.15 degrees. Unlike the other six channels, it can stare at one target and take an image. The purpose of this channel is to support optical navigation. The Navigation channel is a Frame array that operates as a single frame, rather than the other channels which generate an image by time delay integration. MVIC Bands: There are six channels that use Time Delay Integration and another that takes a frame and is for navigation. *2 panchromatic channels (observing light wavelengths from 400 to 975 nm) *Blue (400-550 nm) *Red (540-700 nm) *Near infrared (from 780 up to 975 nm light wavelengths) *methane band (860-910 nm) *Navigation channel / framing array LESIA achieved its highest resolution data of Pluto of about 3 km/pixel at New Horizons closest approach to Pluto on July 14, 2015, when it was 47,000 km distant.HIGHEST SPATIAL RESOLUTION NEW HORIZONS LEISA SPECTRAL-IMAGING SCAN OF PLUTO Images During the flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015, Ralph was able to collect data on Pluto and its moons yielding various image products.

The greatest popularity in the art world Remnev has gained for the paintings with visual motifs of Russian provincial life. Biography and works He was born into a family of doctors. In 1983 he graduated from the Moscow Art School in memory of 1905. He completed the Surikov's Moscow State Art Institute, where he was one of the first to write a thesis on a religion-related theme. In 1996 he began an eight-year study of iconography under the guidance of the icon painter Fr. Vyacheslav (Savinykh) in Andronikov Monastery. He kept working on religious themes in 2000-2010: he painted the plafond of the chapel next to this monastery, as well as the large icon for the Diveyevo Convent. In his own words the artist's technique is based on the combination of methods employed in the old Russian icon painting, Russian artworks of the XVIII century, composition methods of the \\"Art world\\" and Russian constructivism. The art historian Eugene Steiner characterizes Remnev as one of the extraordinary contemporary artists who can paint carnation. Remnev uses medieval painting techniques and makes natural paints on the basis of egg yolk. In the mid-2010s, Remnev‚Äôs art took a new direction ‚Äî he became interested in sketches from the life of contemporary Russian ballet dancers (carrying on the traditions of the ‚ÄúSilver age‚Äù artists). A large series of sketches was made in 2017 in Perm during Stravinsky's ballet performance as a part of the Diaghilev festival. Some of the works were publishes in the booklet released by the theater for the ballet premieres. During this period at the invitation of a principal dancer Artem Ovcharenko and ballerina Olga Smirnova, Remnev started painting in the classroom and behind the stage of the Bolshoi Ballet. The series of works was created about the staging of John Neumeier‚Äôs \\"La Dame aux Cam√©lias\\". He also made sketches from the rehearsals of the orchestra MusicAeterna, graphic portraits of Teodor Currentzis, Natalia Osipova, Olga Smirnova, Artem Ovcharenko, B. B. Akimov, Oksana Kardash and David Motta Soares. A separate easel series was devoted to the Diaghilev seasons. Remnev puts a significant amount of time into the work as a portraitist for private customers. One of his portraits from a private collection took part in a representative exhibition of The Russian Museum \\"Portrait of the family\\" (2014) as an example of the latter-day genre ‚Äî modern Russian custom portrait. Personal exhibitions of the artist were held in Moscow, Ryazan, Sergiev Posad, Dmitrov, The Hague, Trenton, other cities. He is the artistic director of the plein air and the jury member of the international youth festival \\"Russian Spring\\" (Bavaria 2012, Barcelona 2013, Paris 2014). He is a professor at Surikov's Moscow State Art Institute and an honorary member of the International Academy of Culture and Art. The works of Remnev based on Russian motifs, inspired foreign designers. The fall-winter 2015 collection of the Spanish designer \\"Delposo\\" was created under the impression of Remnev's works, and the spring-summer 2018 collection of the Italian fashion label \\"Vivetta\\" was created in a collaboration with the artist.

History  Founded by Alex Stolting in 1875 as The Erie County Independent, it was initially published in Buffalo and Hamburg, New York. Stolting also founded the volunteer fire brigade in Hamburg. The paper was sold to J. W. Constantine five years later, then to Charles G. Miller in 1882. Charles was succeeded by his brother, Joseph B. Miller as proprietor of the paper. In 1945, former employee Dick Allen purchased the Independent for $500 and changed the name to Hamburg Sun. Allen, a native of Hamburg, had been employed in newspaper and public relations in Chicago before enlisting to fight in World War II. On returning from the war he decided to settle down in his hometown, starting his own Hamburg Sun publication before purchasing the Independent and merging the two papers. The Hamburg Sun ceased publication briefly in 2016 after its then owner Community Papers of Western New York was forced to claim bankruptcy. The bankruptcy was just two years after the conglomerate took ownership from Metro News in 2014. The paper was put up for auction after the collapse.

The song was written by Tisdale, Whitney Lauren Phillips and John Feldmann, while the latter produced the track. It was released as the album's lead single on November 8, 2018, through label Big Noise. Background and release Tisdale released her second studio album Guilty Pleasure (2009) via Warner Bros. Records. Described by Tisdale as a \\"rocker and edgier\\" album, it generated mixed reviews, with a 54% rating on Metacritic. It debuted at number 12 on the Billboard 200, selling 25,000 copies in the first week; this was significantly lower than the first-week sales for her previous album Headstrong (2007). Promotion for the album ended in the end of that year, following the release of the album's second single \\"Crank It Up\\", and, in order to start focusing on her career as an actress and producer, Tisdale decided to end her record deal with Warner Bros. Records. While promoting the film Scary Movie 5 (2013), in which she starred, Tisdale said in an interview to MTV that she was inspired to create music again and confirmed that since 2012 she has been recording for her third studio album. She hopes to \\"surprise people a little bit, [with] something different from what [she has] done before\\". Tisdale became engaged to musician Christopher French in August 2013 and they began working together on music for her third studio album. On December 9, 2013, Tisdale announced the release of a song titled \\"You're Always Here\\", her first release on music since 2009. However, the song was not promoted to radio and Tisdale eventually paused working on the album because she \\"wasn't excited about anything [she] was doing\\" and began adventuring into other ventures such as makeup and clothing lines. In 2016, Tisdale relaunched her YouTube channel and began posting acoustic cover versions of hit songs, collaborating with other artists such as Vanessa Hudgens, Lea Michele, Echosmith's Sydney Sierota and her husband Chris French The success of the Paramore's \\"Still into You\\" cover featuring Chris French led Tisdale to released it as a promotional single in 2016. Early in 2018, Tisdale released an extended play titled Music Sessions, Vol. 1 containing a few of the covers she originally recorded for her YouTube channel. Later in 2018, Tisdale signed with newly-launched label Big Noise and resumed work on her third studio album, which was announced to be titled Symptoms. On October 18, 2018, Tisdale announced on her Instagram page that she would be releasing the track \\"Voices in My Head\\" as the lead single off her third studio album on November 8, 2018, and also posted online the official cover art for the single. Composition and lyrical content \\"Voices in My Head\\" is an indie pop song written by Tisdale, Whitney Lauren Phillips and John Feldmann. On the track, Tisdale discusses her insecurities and vulnerabilities, related to the anxiety and depression she suffers from, and also describes how her lover provides the support she needs in order to keep her grounded. Tisdale had been silently fighting anxiety and depression for years, so working on the track and the rest of the album was therapeutic for her. When asked by Paper Magazine in November 9, 2018, what had inspired her to write the song and the rest of the album, Tisdale claimed: With \\"Voices in My Head\\" specifically the singer aims to capture all the negativity she had struggled with. The track's melody revolves into \\"over a simple, catchy guitar lick that morphs into a spare electro-infused beat\\". Tisdale soothingly harmonises over the groovy guitar riff and alternative pop beat that drives the chorus. Lyrically, the track explores the deep thoughts of anxiety and mental health. Live performances Tisdale first performed the song live at the Macy‚Äôs Thanksgiving Day Parade on November 16, 2018. It was also performed on Holton‚Äôs Heroes Benefit Concert on November 22, 2018. On May 2, 2019, Tisdale performed the song on The Late Late Show with James Corden to promote the album.

Swackhamer's thesis research focused on better understanding how PCBs were transported in bodies of water, using Lake Michigan as a model for her work. Following her doctorate, Swackhamer became a postdoctoral research associate at Indiana University in Chemistry and Public & Environmental Affairs, working in Ronald A. Hites's group from 1985 to 1987. There, she worked to develop a method for quantitating the insecticide toxaphene in environmental samples using mass spectrometry. The pesticide was most commonly used on cotton and in livestock and poultry until its use was cancelled in 1990, as it is a known carcinogen. She also characterized how organochlorine, another pesticide, accumulated and were transported through lake trout and whitefish in Siskiwit Lake, a remote lake on Isle Royale in Lake Superior.  Research  In 1987, Swackhamer joined the University of Minnesota faculty where she continued her research of studying the process that affect the behavior and fate of organic contaminants that are resistant to degradation and remain in the environment for a long time, known as \\"persistent organic compounds.\\" Her research has more specifically centered on PCBs, dioxins, and pesticides in the Great Lakes region. For instance, her group found that the high water concentrations of the pesticide toxaphene in Lake Superior are the result of colder temperatures and lower sedimentation rates. Toxaphene was absorbed by the Great Lakes as a gas, and while its use was discontinued in 1990, it persists in varying concentrations across the Lakes. Her group has also modeled annual and seasonal fluxes of toxaphene from water to air and sediment, finding that toxaphene contamination will persist far into the future in the Great Lake region. Swackhamer has also studied the impact of these environmental contaminants on animals in lake populations. She has been part of research efforts that have uncovered reproductive complications in male fathead minnows exposed to wastewater treatment byproducts. Her group has worked to develop methods to measure and assess the effects of suspended solids and chemical stressors in lakes on plankton populations and Daphnia, aquatic crustaceans also known as \\"water fleas\\". Swackhamer's team has also worked to model the effects of microbes in spreading contamination across the food web. These microbes take up organic contaminants and transfer them to the protozoan grazers, and so the contaminants travel up the food chain. Her research has been supported by agencies like the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation.  Public service and leadership  Swackhamer has lent her expertise to serving on a number of environmental advisory boards. Starting in 2000 to 2013, she joined the Science Advisory Board of the International Joint Commission of the United States and Canada, which provides scientific advice to the Commission and the Water Quality Board under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. During her tenure, she co-authored a report on emerging issues of the Great Lakes to identify issues of importance for the next 25 years, as well as opportunities for sustaining progress under the Great Lakes Quality Agreement. The challenges identified included climate change, chemical contaminants, and changes to the biological community surrounding the Great Lakes. In 2003, Swackhamer became the director of the University of Minnesota's Water Resources Center. She served as the director of University of Minnesota's Water Resources Center. From 2006 to 2012, she was a member of the board of directors, National Institutes of Water Resources (NIWR), serving as its president from 2010 to 2011. In 2015, Swackhamer was appointed to the National Academy of Sciences Board of Environmental Science and Toxicology. From 2003 to 2012, Swackhamer was a member of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Advisory Board, and served as its Chair from 2008 to 2012. She later served as Chair of the EPA's Board of Scientific Counselors (BOSC), an independent an external panel of experts that advises the agency's office of science. Her three-year term began in the spring of 2015, however, she was prematurely dismissed from her position following her testimony to the United States House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology in June 2017. The Committee's minority leadership invited Swackhamer to testify on state involvement in EPA regulation setting. In her testimony, she stressed the need for the role of bipartisan support for environmental protections, the capacity to produce robust scientific research at the state level, and the importance of environmental regulations for public health. During her testimony, which ran counter to the Trump-era EPA's overall position of decreasing environmental regulations, she emphasized that she was delivering her opinions as a private citizen and scientific expert‚Äînot in her capacity as the head of an EPA advisory. Nevertheless, EPA leadership tried to interfere with her testimony in advance of the hearing, which raised concerns among the House Democrats, who alleged that such interference was \\"inappropriate and may have violated federal regulations.\\" Despite the pressure, Swackhamer did not change her testimony and was subsequently dismissed. Following her dismissal, she told The New York Times: \\"The Board of Scientific Counselors had 68 members two months ago [in April 2018]. It will have 11 come Sept. 1. They‚Äôve essentially suspended scientific activities by ending these terms.‚Äù  Awards and honors  * Fellow, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2007 *Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) Founders Award, 2009 *Ada Comstock Scholar Award, University of Minnesota, 2010 *Lifetime Achievement in Water Resources Research and Education, Universities Council on Water Resources, 2017  References  Year of birth missing (living people) Living people University of Wisconsin-Madison alumni University of Minnesota faculty 20th-century American chemists 20th-century American women scientists American women chemists Environmental scientists ","title":"Deborah Swackhamer"},{"id":"58725874","text":"The coat of arms of Marseille has witnessed its existence since the 14th century. The current version was adopted in the 1883. The blazon proper of Marseille consists of a silver field (white) with a cross of azure (blue). It has its origin in the colors of the city's flag. Behind the shield itself are placed a trident and a silver caduceus placed in saltire (on blade). The trident is associated with the seas and fishing. The caduceus is usually presented as a symbol of commerce. The heraldic supports, the figures that flank the shield, are the figure of a bull and a lion, both of silver. The bull, located in the right hand of the shield (left of the spectator), is rampant and guard (erect and watching the spectator). The lion is rampant. In the crest, a French mural crown of silver is shown. The mural crown, of Roman origin, is often used by municipal corporations as an emblem of their power and authority. On the bottom, written in letters of saber (black color), is the motto of the city \\"Actibus immensis urbs fulget Massiliensis\\", which in Latin means \\"The city of Marseille shines through his great achievements\\". History The flag of the city of Marseille, a white flag with a blue cross, has the peculiarity of being older than the coat of arms. The cross was adopted as a symbol of the Crusades, since at that time, (11th - 13th centuries) in the ports of embarkation to go to the Holy Land, flags loaded with crosses were hoisted as a characteristic sign of the safe ports. The first documented reference to the emblem of Marseille is dated in 1254, it's about statutes of the city that prescribed its use: ¬´of vexillo cum cross communis Massilie carrying in navibus et de alio vexillo¬ª. In 1257, in the agreement that the city signed with Charles of Anjou, Count of Provence, it was stated that \\"on land and sea, in their ships, galleys and other facilities, they will continue to show the flag of their municipality in the usual manner and only the banner of Mr. Count will be hoisted in the most honorable place\\". In that same year, the motto of the city appeared in Medieval Proven√ßal: \\"De grands fachs resplend la cioutat de Marseilles\\" written in spelling of the era. The oldest graphic representation of the coat of arms dates back to the 14th century, it belongs to the Red Book of the city in an illumination in which an oath made in a viguerie, an administrative court of medieval France, is represented. In this scene can be seen four crosses of azure on a silver background. With the passage of time, representations of the arms of the city (drawn, painted, printed or sculpted) carved on the facades of public buildings or decorating objects multiplied. Until 1699, the coat of arms was not officially registered in a General Armorial as a result of an edict established by Colbert that regulated the coats of arms. On May 17, 1809, during the First Empire, it was allowed by decree that the municipalities recover their old blazons, suppressed in 1790 by the National Constituent Assembly. Marseille could enjoy this right in 1810. 6 New weapons were designed according to the guidelines of the Napoleonic heraldry: ¬´in a cut field; in the first, silver, a cross of azure; in the second, of the same, a trireme of gold on a sea of sinople; the chief of gules loaded with three golden bees¬ª. However, Napoleonic weapons would never be used. During the Bourbon Restoration, Louis XVIII confirmed by royal patent, that the coat of arms of the city be adorned with a bull armed with a trident and a lion holding a caduceus, similar to those shown in the Armorial of 1699. In 1826, a new version was approved in which a mural crown was introduced and the supports were replaced by a cornucopia and a trident accompanied by the inscription \\"Massilia civitas\\" (in Latin, City of Marseille). This composition is still used in an official seal of the municipality. The large shield, intended for official documents, dates from 1883 and was designed by Joseph Laugier, a curator of the Cabinet of Coins and Medals. In it, the mural crown was kept and the bull, the lion and the motto of the city were recovered.

January 8, 2014 The term, non-Jewish African refugees, primarily refers to the Sudanese and Eritrean refugee population migrating to Israel through the Sinai Desert. Israeli policy concerning these refugees has evolved from a policy of neutrality to a policy of deterrence. These refugees began arriving in Israel in the 21st century, led by Bedouin smugglers. The current non-Jewish African refugee population in Israel is approximately 36,000. Most non-Jewish African refugees have been granted \\"conditional release\\" visas, which are not valid work permits in Israel. Lack of a valid work permit severely limits their economic opportunities. Economic limitations and other factors have led to discrimination and racism. There have been cases of violent riots targeting African refugees in Tel Aviv, although the Israeli government has arrested and subsequently punished the perpetrators. Israeli citizens living in neighborhoods with large refugee populations have mixed attitudes towards them. Some have claimed refugees are \\"rapists\\" and \\"criminals\\", while others living in the same neighborhood described them as \\"peaceful\\" and \\"kind.\\" With tensions rising and shifting Israeli policy, both deterrence and support for the refugees has increased. Israeli policy toward African refugees have been heavily influenced by the advocacy and legal work of several nonprofits, including the Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, Kav LaOved, Association for Civil Rights in Israel, and others.  2000‚Äì2006  Prior to 2000, the Israeli government had not created any specific policies for handling incoming refugees. The determination of refugee status was outsourced to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Until 2006, there were no challenges to this system due to the low number of refugees. Later, a new law was established in which the UNHCR would process asylum applications and send a recommendation to the Israeli National Status Granting Body, which was tasked with deciding refugee status. Approved refugees received temporary residency and temporary work permits in Israel. However, the Israeli government granted only 170 permits of this kind between 2002-2005. Moreover, individuals identified as \\"citizens of enemy states\\" were not allowed to seek asylum. This was the status of all Sudanese refugees in Israel since both countries have no diplomatic relations. The rapid increase in the number of Eritrean and Sudanese immigrants beginning in 2006 changed the Israeli policy towards refugees from these two countries. From then on, the Israeli government began to work towards creating an environment that would be undesirable to refugees. However, in 2007, the Israeli government was still issuing three-month renewable \\"conditional release\\" visas, which allowed Eritrean and Sudanese refugees to work. Beginning 2010, all visas upon renewal were issued with a stamp indicating that \\"this visa is not a working permit.\\" This policy ensured that refugees were protected from deportation to their countries of origin, but they could not legally work in Israel. Due to the precarious legal work status of refugees, they are often discriminated against for job opportunities and have to rely on infrequent jobs to make ends meet.  2006‚Äì2008  Prior to 2006 and throughout 2007, Israeli policy was to detain all refugees from \\"enemy states\\" for months at a time. This policy was later discontinued. In addition, there existed a policy to return refugees to the Sinai desert if they had crossed the border into Israel, but this policy was also ended later by the decision of the Israeli Supreme Court.  2009‚Äì2014  In 2009, the Israeli government formed a Refugee Status Determination (RSD) Unit that works closely with the United Nations. The Israeli Immigration and Border Authority processes all asylum requests and authorizes temporary group protection. Most of the Sudanese and Eritrean refugees fell into the latter category, a categorization that significantly delays registration as refugees. In 2012, Israel built a fence along their border with Egypt to deter the illegal migration of African refugees. The fence has significantly decreased the influx of Sudanese and Eritrean refugees into Israel. Later that same year, an emergency plan was set in motion to deport refugees to their home countries. Voluntary deportees would be given an opportunity for self-removal and receive 1,000 Euro to assist in repatriation to their homelands.  2015‚Äì2018  By 2015, the Israeli government began giving Sudanese and Eritrean refugees a choice to either return to their home countries, move to another state, or be imprisoned. Many migrants lived in facilities such as Saharonim Prison and similar ones, where they are free to leave during the day, but must return at night or face imprisonment. During the spring of 2018, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reached a deal with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to relocate many refugees into western nations over a period of five years. Israel agreed to grant temporary residency to those who remained. The deal soon fell apart due to pressure from within Netanyahu's own government.

In 1997 he became the first paid Australian skeptic when he took on the role of Executive Officer of the Australian Skeptics. He was involved in many investigations of paranormal claims and the editor of The Skeptic magazine for 18 years. Williams was often called on by Australian media outlets for comments relating to paranormal claims. Life and career Williams joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and served in various places, including Butterworth and Williamtown. After leaving the RAAF, Williams worked for the US Department of Commerce in Sydney in sales and as an exhibition manager. Williams served as Vice President of the North Sydney federal electorate conference for the Liberal Party. In 1979 he was part of an investigation of Dr. Paul Solomon, a candidate who had been pre-selected for the federal seat of North Sydney, who had made false claims in his pre-selection dossier. In 1995 Williams became the first Executive Officer of the Australian Skeptics. After several heart operations, Williams died on 20 January 2018, at the age of 79. Skeptical activism Williams first realised that he was a skeptic when he read Chariots of the Gods?; he thought it was fascinating, until he read to the section about the pyramids. He is quoted as saying about the section \\"This is tripe\\". He later heard Dick Smith say in an interview that things like UFOs needed to be challenged; he wrote to Smith and said that if he got anything off the ground he was interested. Until then Williams thought that he was the only person who believed that such things did not exist. In 1980, Williams formed the New South Wales branch of the Australian Skeptics. In 1986, the head office of the Australian Skeptics moved to Sydney and Williams served as their president until 1996. In 1990, Williams took up the role of editor of The Skeptic magazine, and remained in that role for 18 years. In 1995, the Australian Skeptics received a bequest which enabled them to create the position of executive officer. Williams relinquished his position of president and took up the full time position of executive officer in 1997, becoming the first paid employee of the Australian Skeptics. During his time as president and executive officer of the Australian Skeptics, Williams appeared in various media outlets and became the face of Skepticism in Australia. He was often called on for comment about psychics, UFOs, ghosts, new age beliefs, creationism, and the \\"energy polariser\\" of racing driver Peter Brock. In 1993 Williams successfully \\"predicted\\" the winner of the Australian Federal election. He said that \\"the winner would have a campaign manager whose name had four letters, the second letter being \\"o\\" and the last two letters being identical.\\" The Labor Party won the election under campaign manager Bob Hogg. Williams claimed a \\"double whammy\\" when, in 1996 the Liberal Party won the election under campaign manager Andrew Robb. While editor of The Skeptic, Williams contributed to every edition of the magazine not only in an editorial role, but also a writer and investigator. His investigation \\"UFO was IPO\\" was cited in Martin Bridgstock's book Beyond Belief: Skepticism, Science and the Paranormal and described as a \\"rather elegant example\\" of using \\"scientific knowledge to explain paranormal phenomena\\". Williams was a cricket fanatic and he wrote a piece on the \\"Devil's number, 87\\" in Australian cricket which was first published in the Australian Skeptic in 1993 and re-printed the Skeptic in March 2012. The piece was published in The Best Ever Australian Sports Writing: a 200 year collection. In August 2018 the Australian Skeptics announced they would be presenting The Barry Williams Award for Skeptical Journalism in Williams' honour. The award recognises \\"the best piece of journalism (in any medium) that takes a critical and skeptical approach to a topic\\" within the scope of the Australian Skeptics, and has been nicknamed the Wallaby, after the nom-de-plume \\"Sir Jim R Wallaby\\" used by Williams in some of his more whimsical writing.

Note that some authors define a related operation (under one of the other names) which is not an inverse per se; particularly, one common definition instead has (\\\\operatorname{inv}_k)^2 (A) = -A. The transform is often presented as a pivot around a single non-zero element a_{kk}, in which case one has : \\\\left[ \\\\operatorname{inv}_k (A) \\\\right]_{ij} = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{1}{a_{kk}} & i = j = k \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\frac{a_{kj}}{a_{kk}} & i = k, j eq k \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{a_{jk}}{a_{kk}} & i eq k, j = k \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{ij} - \\\\frac{a_{ik} a_{kj}}{a_{kk}} & i eq k, j eq k \\\\end{cases} Partial inverses obey a number of nice properties:Exceedingly Simple Principal Pivot Transforms * inversions around different blocks commute, so larger pivots may be built up from sequences of smaller ones * partial inversion preserves the space of symmetric matrices Use of the partial inverse in numerical analysis is due to the fact that there is some flexibility in the choices of pivots, allowing for non-invertible elements to be avoided, and because the operation of rotation (of the graph of the pivoted matrix) has better numerical stability than the shearing operation which is implicitly performed by Gaussian elimination. Use in statistics is due to the fact that the resulting matrix nicely decomposes into blocks which have useful meanings in the context of linear regression.

It is based on both the 2013 South Korean‚ÄìCzech film of the same name, directed by Bong Joon-ho, and the 1982 French graphic novel Le Transperceneige, from which the film was adapted, by Jacques Lob, Benjamin Legrand, and Jean-Marc Rochette. The series, a reboot of the film's continuity, follows the passengers of the Snowpiercer, a gigantic, perpetually moving train that circles the globe carrying the remnants of humanity seven years after the world becomes a frozen wasteland. The series questions class warfare, social injustice, and the politics of survival. Daveed Diggs and Jennifer Connelly star alongside Mickey Sumner, Annalise Basso, Sasha Frolova, Alison Wright, Benjamin Haigh, Roberto Urbina, Katie McGuinness, Susan Park, Lena Hall, Sheila Vand, Sam Otto, Iddo Goldberg, and Jaylin Fletcher. Rowan Blanchard, Steven Ogg, and Sean Bean will also join the main cast in the second season. While in development at TNT for over three years, the series faced numerous production issues and delays arising from creative differences between the series' producers and the network. The series remained in development hell until May 2019, when it was announced that the series would instead air on TNT's sister network TBS for a release in the second quarter of 2020 and that it had already been renewed for a second season. However, in September 2019, the decision to change networks was reversed. Prior to studio shutdowns that occurred due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the second season's production was completed. The second season is set to premiere on January 25, 2021.  Premise  Snowpiercer is set in 2021, seven years after the world becomes a frozen wasteland, and follows the remnants of humanity, who inhabit a perpetually moving train consisting of 1001 carriages that circles the globe 2.7 revolutions per year (133 days to complete a revolution). Built by billionaire Wilford, the train is rigidly separated by class, with passengers caught up in a revolutionary struggle against the strictly imposed social hierarchy and unbalanced allocation of limited resources. The show questions class warfare, social injustice, and the politics of survival. Cast and characters Main * Jennifer Connelly as Melanie Cavill: she is the powerful head of Hospitality (the department responsible for smooth relations) and the Voice of the Train (responsible for making the PA system's daily announcements) aboard Snowpiercer. Though many of her peers are dismissive of the lower-class passengers, Melanie is curiously fascinated by them as she came from humble beginnings, explaining much of her sympathies. To the majority of the train, Melanie is believed to be Mr. Wilford's representative in relaying orders to the passengers and crew. It is later revealed Melanie has assumed his identity and position as Great Engineer of Snowpiercer, and was the original designer of the train. Melanie has been facing the crushing burden of directing Snowpiercer on its global journey, managing mounting resource and class issues, having her authority and decisions challenged and maintaining Wilford's iron order throughout the train to preserve the last of humanity. With few aware of her true identity, she is also desperate to maintain the myth of Wilford and keep her identity secret. * Daveed Diggs as Andre Layton: A former detective, is a quiet thinker who spends his days tending to his cage of rats in the Tail, and a dangerous rebel who helps coordinate and lead a revolution against the oppressive First Class to improve the harsh living conditions in the tail end of the train. As he is the world's only surviving homicide detective, he is reluctantly deputized by Melanie to help solve a series of murders; involving him and those he cares about in a struggle that could upend life on the train. Layton uses his new position as train detective to investigate the killings, while gathering intelligence and support for the revolution. * Mickey Sumner as Bess Francis Till: A thoughtful, empathetic, and savvy Brakeman who is part of the train's security force, she is a former Detroit PD first-year rookie officer who witnessed the department's self- destruction during the Freeze. She finds herself at the center of a series of murders that rocks the train's uneasy status quo. She is in a serious romantic relationship with Jinju, and later upgrades to Second Class to be with her. * Alison Wright as Ruth Wardell: Melanie's deputy in Hospitality who helps look after First Class passengers, and oversees removal requests from the Tail, or delivering demands to them, activities she seems to feel are beneath her. Before the Freeze, she ran a bed and breakfast in Kendal, and was personally recruited for Snowpiercer by Mr. Wilford when he was a guest. * Lena Hall as Miss Audrey: The lead madam of the Nightcar, a Third Class den of (mostly) platonic prostitution and spiritual healing. She represents Third Class before the rest of the train and is very vocal about the cruelty of the social differences aboard Snowpiercer, and pursues opportunities to demand more social conscience in the train, including supporting Layton's revolution. * Iddo Goldberg as Bennett Knox: An engineer in Snowpiercer's engine room, and one of the few inside the knowledge of Melanie's identity as Mr. Wilford, he is one of the original engineers who helped design the train, making him one of the few passengers who knows the deepest secrets of the train. He is later revealed to be Melanie's love interest. * Susan Park as Jinju Seong: The agricultural officer aboard Snowpiercer who lives in Second Class, she is also the finest chef at the train's finest restaurant, and a member of the train's elite. She is in a serious romantic relationship with Bess and is one of the few inside the knowledge of Melanie's identity as Mr. Wilford. * Katie McGuinness as Josie Wellstead (season 1): A strong, no-nonsense Tailie, she cares for Miles and other children in the tail, and uses training from her time as a veterinarian before the Freeze to treat the sick or injured. She is Andre's love interest after Zarah's departure from the tail. She has been part of uprisings in the tail, and takes great risks on the behalf of her community. She later freezes to death, after trying to kill Cavill who tortured her. * Sam Otto as John \\"Oz\\" Osweiller: A young Brakeman and Bess' partner as a police-type figure of the train, he is more harsh and direct than Bess in dealing with passengers, but his behaviour could be from emotional trauma (he referenced to be in pain from \\"everything\\"), which he takes the street-drug Kronole to cope with. * Sheila Vand as Zarah Ferami: Andre's ex- wife who, unable to adjust to the rigors of surviving in poverty on the train, left the Tail to become a bartender in the Nightcar, to the fury of other Tailies and Andre's heartbreak. With Andre's recruitment as train detective, she is now forced to confront her past. She is later revealed to be pregnant with Layton's child. * Roberto Urbina as Javier \\"Javi\\" de La Torre: An engineer in Snowpiercer's engine room, and one of the few inside the knowledge of Melanie's identity as Mr. Wilford, he often helps with the driving of the train. He uses advanced algorithms to predict the environment surrounding Snowpiercer at all times. * Mike O'Malley as Roche: The lead Brakeman in Snowpiercer's security force, he is a former police officer. Before boarding the Snowpiercer, he had the privilege of shaking hands with the real Wilford. He and his wife survived the Freeze due to his employment under Wilford Industries, however two of his three children did not survive. He ultimately decides to support Layton's rebellion. * Annalise Basso as Lilah \\"LJ\\" Folger Jr.: The isolated teenage daughter of Lilah and Robert, she lives uptrain with her parents in First Class, surrounded by luxury. Appearing to be quiet and diligent, she is later revealed as a murderous psychopath and sadist, and the mastermind behind the serial murders on Snowpiercer committed by her bodyguard and boyfriend Erik Sotto. Following the death of her parents in the revolution, she is evicted from First Class by Pike. * Jaylin Fletcher as Miles: A Tailie who is one of the few children in the tail, whose parents and sister were left behind to die in the Freeze when their refugee group invaded the train, leaving him to be raised primarily by Andre and Josie - the rest of the tail refer to him as \\"Miles and Miles\\" (implying no one is aware of his surname). Whip smart and talented, his intelligence wins him a coveted apprenticeship that allows him to move up the train to Second Class. He is later fast-track appointed an Engine Apprentice by Melanie. Gabriel Jacob- Cross plays Young Miles. * Rowan Blanchard as Alexandra Cavill (season 2; guest season 1): The daughter of Melanie Cavill. She was thought to have died seven years ago during the Freeze but was revealed to be alive on Wilford's train in the Season 1 finale. *Steven Ogg as Pike (season 2; recurring season 1): A hardened and battle-scarred leader in the Tail and a warrior of his people. He was a career convict, serving time in Cook County Jail for armed robbery at the time of the Freeze, but escaped. *Sean Bean as Mr. Wilford (season 2; uncredited season 1: A reclusive billionaire and genius inventor who used his company, Wilford Industries, to build Snowpiercer and its global railway to save a small population of humanity from the Freeze. He is believed to be the mysterious and near-mythical Great Engineer of the train and is worshipped by many as the visionary who protected the last remnants of humanity. It is later revealed Melanie has assumed his identity and position in charge of Snowpiercer. He was believed dead after Melanie abandoned him to die at boarding but in fact survived aboard the Big Alice supply train. His (uncredited) voice is heard in a doctored recording in \\"Access Is Power\\" Recurring * Timothy V. Murphy as Nolan Grey (season 1): The commander of Snowpiercer's security force, he is a brilliant tactician, hardened leader, and former Special Forces, British SAS who commanded men before the Freeze. He relishes keeping things in order and getting his hands dirty in combat. He dies in the penultimate episode of Season 1 when Layton, Melanie, Bennett and Miles cut seven cars loose. * Happy Anderson as Henry Klimpt: A research scientist-turned-doctor living in Second Class. He oversees those unfortunate enough to be sentenced to the coffin-like Drawers. He later supports Layton's revolution. * Jonathan Lloyd Walker as Big John (season 1): A Tailie who works in Sanitation along with others from the tail; work that is harsh slave-like labor. He is killed in the revolution. * Aleks Paunovic as Bojan \\"Boki\\" Boscovic (season 1): A large and fearsome-looking Breachworker, one of the most dangerous jobs on the train, with frostbite scars and stumped ears who is used to the cold and jokes about the hazards of the job. * Shaun Toub as Terence: The head janitor aboard Snowpiercer who lives in Third Class, he is a charming, conniving, and ultimately dangerous janitor-turned-gangster who rules the Black Market with an enigmatic power, inspiring fierce loyalty in his army of minions. * Kerry O'Malley as Lilah Folger, Sr. (season 1): A former corporate lawyer from old money who is fiercely protective of her own, particularly her daughter LJ and the rest of first class with whom she shares a vested interest in maintaining their security and privilege. She, along with her husband, both die in the penultimate episode of Season 1 when Layton, Melanie, Bennett and Miles cut seven cars loose. * Aaron Glenane as the Last Australian: A scrappy Tailie charmer from Perth with an intense desire to survive and have children because, as far as he knows, he is the last Australian. Its revealed that his real name is Murray though no one calls him that. * Fiona Vroom as Mary-Elizabeth Gillies: A primary teacher aboard Snowpiercer who lives in Second Class, she is an encouraging and well-rounded school teacher who is responsible for educating Snowpiercer's next generation.

Episodes   Production   Development  In November 2015, Marty Adelstein's Tomorrow Studios optioned the rights to develop a television series based on the 2013 film Snowpiercer, which was adapted from the 1982 French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob, Benjamin Legrand, and Jean-Marc Rochette. The film's director Bong Joon-ho was attached as an executive producer alongside Adelstein and Josh Friedman, with the latter also set to write. A year later in November 2016, the project was ordered to pilot along with backup scripts by TNT with Friedman to serve as showrunner. In May 2017, it was announced that Scott Derrickson would direct the pilot written by Friedman. The pilot was picked up to series in January 2018. Later that month, Friedman was removed from the project by TNT due to \\"creative differences\\" with the network. Graeme Manson was appointed to replace Friedman as showrunner the following month. That June, Derrickson refused to return for reshoots on the pilot due to creative disputes with Manson, explaining via Twitter: Less than two weeks later, James Hawes joined the series in July as a co-executive producer and a director to oversee the reshoots for the pilot. According to Manson, nearly nothing of the original pilot's footage was used outside of one special-effect scene, and this reshooting was the primary cause for the year-long delay in the show's premiere. Later that month, Netflix picked up the international distribution rights to stream the series outside of the United States and China. In May 2019, it was announced that the series would air on TBS instead of TNT for a spring 2020 release, and that a second season had already been ordered by the network. That month, it was also announced that Huanxi Media Group had signed on to broadcast the first two seasons exclusively in China. Manson will return as showrunner for the second season. In September 2019, the decision to change networks was reversed, with the series once again set to air on TNT.  Writing  The series is designed to be a reboot of the original 2013 film's continuity. The story takes place seven years after a climate catastrophe rendered the outside world uninhabitable, forcing the remnants of humanity to live confined inside of a massive train that constantly circles the globe. The series investigates class struggle, as the passengers of the train are segregated by wealth. The series star Daveed Diggs said that the show would \\"broaden exponentially\\" the world established by the film and the 1982 graphic novel. \\"That's one of the advantages of TV, you have time\\" Diggs said, \\"so the politics that are hinted at in the film are explored in much more depth and the mechanism of the train [is explored further] ‚Äî just the little things that create a world, world specificity\\". At the 2017 Television Critics Association press tour, TNT and TBS president Kevin Reilly revealed that the Snowpiercer series would be akin to a \\"space ship show\\" due to its contained setting and that it would feature a mystery during the first season.  Casting  In May 2017, Daveed Diggs was cast as Layton Well. The following month, Jennifer Connelly and Mickey Sumner landed the other lead roles of Melanie Cavill and Bess Till, respectively. Casting continued throughout the month of June with Annalise Basso as LJ Folger, Sasha Frolova as Pixi Aariak, Alison Wright as Ruth Wardell, Benjamin Haigh as Fergus McConnell, Roberto Urbina as Avi, and Katie McGuinness as Josie McConnell. That August, it was announced that Susan Park had joined the main cast as Jinju. In September, Lena Hall was cast as Sayori. The series order in January 2018 also revealed that Sheila Vand and Sam Otto had been cast in then-undisclosed roles as series regulars. Vand was reported to be playing Zarah, while Otto will play John \\"Oz\\" Osweiler. In August, Iddo Goldberg and Jaylin Fletcher were added as series regulars in the roles of Bennett and Miles, respectively. Casting for a number of recurring roles were also announced during the month of August, including Steven Ogg as Pike, Timothy V. Murphy as Commander Grey, Happy Anderson as Klimpt, Jonathan Lloyd Walker as Big John, and Aleks Paunovic as Bojan Boscovic. The following month in September, Shaun Toub and Kerry O'Malley were added to the recurring cast as Terence and Lilah Folger, respectively. In October, Aaron Glenane was cast as The Last Australian alongside Fiona Vroom as Miss Gillies, both in recurring capacities. In March 2019, Rowan Blanchard was cast as Alexandra for a guest role with the option of becoming a series regular should the series be renewed for a second season. Blanchard's promotion to the main cast for the second season was confirmed with the series' renewal that May. In June, Ogg was also promoted to series regular status for the second season. In October, Chelsea Harris was announced in the recurring role of Sykes. Later that month, it was also announced that Sean Bean would be a series regular for the second season. In November, Tom Lipinski was added to the second season's recurring cast as Kevin. In December, Sakina Jaffrey and Damian Young joined the second season's recurring cast as Mrs. and Mr. Headwood, respectively.  Filming  In January 2017, it was reported that filming for the series was scheduled to begin in mid-March of that year. By September 25, pilot director Scott Derrickson indicated that production for the series had officially commenced. Reshoots for the pilot, overseen by new director James Hawes, began on August 20, 2018 in Vancouver, British Columbia and concluded on January 24, 2019. Principal photography for the second season began on October 21, 2019 in Langley, British Columbia and was originally expected to end on March 20, 2020. In March 2020, production was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lena Hall, who portrays Miss Audrey, confirmed in July 2020 that the last block of episodes for season 2‚Äîepisodes 9 and 10‚Äîwere being filmed..  Release   Broadcast  The series debuted on TNT in the United States in the spring of 2020, while Netflix began to air the series globally outside of the United States and China. Huanxi Media Group is set to broadcast the first two seasons exclusively in China. The series had originally been planned to premiere on May 31, 2020, but was moved up to May 17, 2020 in early April. Brett Weitz, general manager for TNT, said that the earlier premiere was related to the COVID-19 pandemic as to bring the series to viewers earlier. On October 8, 2020, at New York Comic Con, TNT announced that the second season is set to premiere on January 25, 2021.  Marketing  Cast members Connelly, Diggs, Wright, Sumner, Hall, and Ogg attended the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con International along with executive producers Manson, Adelstein, and Clements to promote the series and debut its first official trailer. As part of the promotion for the upcoming series, insect protein bars mimicking those from the film were made available at the event.

He was one of the best two-year-olds in Europe in 2018 when he was unbeaten in three races including the Round Tower Stakes and the Middle Park Stakes. He was beaten when favourite for the 2000 Guineas on his reappearance in 2019 but subsequently returned to sprint distances and won the July Cup. Background Ten Sovereigns is a bay colt bred in Ireland by Camas Park, Lynch Bages & Summerhill. In October 2017 the yearling was offered for sale at Tattersalls and was bought for 200,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Charlie Gordon- Watson of behalf of John Magnier's Coolmore Stud organisation. The colt was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses, the official details of his ownership changed from race to race: he has sometimes been listed as being the property of Susan Magnier, while on other occasions he was described as being owned by a partnership of Derrick Smith, Michael Tabor and Susan Magnier. He is from the first crop of foals sired by No Nay Never, an American horse who had his greatest success in Europe where he won the Norfolk Stakes and the Prix Morny as a juvenile in 2013. His other foals from his first season at stud included the Richmond Stakes winner Land Force. Ten Sovereigns' name appears to derive from the lyric \\"I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright\\" from the song The Wild Rover: the chorus of the song begins with the words \\"No, nay, never...\\" the name of his sire. Ten Sovereigns' dam Seeking Solace showed some racing ability in France, winning one minor race and finishing fourth in the Prix Penelope. She was descended from the CCA Oaks winner Marshua. Racing career 2018: two-year-old season Ten Sovereigns was ridden in all three of his races by his trainer's son Donnacha O'Brien. On his racecourse debut on 25 August the colt started at odds of 5/1 in a twenty-five runner maiden race over six furlongs at the Curragh. After tracking the leaders he went to the front a furlong out and drew right away in the closing stages to win \\"easily\\" by seven lengths from Carbon Fibre. A week later over the same course and distance the colt was stepped up in class to contest the Group 3 Round Tower Stakes and was made the 1/3 favourite against seven opponents headed by the Fillies' Sprint Stakes winner Servalan. He recorded another easy win as he settled in second behind his stablemate Fantasy before taking the lead approaching the final furlong and pulling clear to win by almost four lengths. After the race Aidan O'Brien said \\"He's definitely fast, but he's relaxed and he's very clean-winded. He seemed to do everything right and he has a good, big, open stride. He has a lovely mind, even into the stalls, and everything is very easy\\". On 29 September Ten Sovereigns was sent to England for the Group 1 Middle Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. His six rivals included his stablemate Sergei Prokofiev (Rochestown Stakes), Jash (unbeaten in two starts), Emaraaty Ana (Gimcrack Stakes) and Rumble Inthejungle (Molecomb Stakes). After tracking the leaders he went to the front in the last quarter mile and held off the sustained challenge of Jash to win by half a length, with the pair coming home well clear of the rest. Donnacha O'Brien commented \\"He learned a lot today and he had to fight today,‚Äù his jockey said. ‚ÄúIt was a big learning curve and when the other horse came to him, he did fight. He put his head down and battled hard. He‚Äôs a fast horse and a natural sprinter\\". Aidan O'Brien considered running the colt in the Dewhurst Stakes two weeks later but gave up on the idea, saying \\"he had three runs in a relatively short space of time and, in fairness to the horse, we've decided to leave him alone until next season\\". 2019: three-year-old season On his first appearance of 2019 Ten Sovereigns was ridden by Ryan Moore when he started the 9/4 favourite in a nineteen-runner field for the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket. The race appeared to be strongly affected by the draw as the three horses drawn on the stands side dominated the race for most of the way and finished first, second and sixth. Ten Sovereigns raced up the centre of the track and came home fifth, almost five lengths behind his stablemate Magna Grecia, but only a neck behind Skardu, who finished first in the centre group. The colt was then dropped back to sprint distances to contest the Commonwealth Cup at Royal Ascot on 21 June. Ridden by Moore he started favourite again, but despite making steady progress in the closing stages he never looked likely to win and finished fourth behind Advertise. On 13 July at Newmarket Ten Sovereigns was matched against older horses in the July Cup and started at odds of 9/2 in a twelve-runner field. Advertise started favourite, while the other contenders included Pretty Pollyanna, Fairyland, Limato and Cape Byron (Wokingham Stakes). Racing down the centre of the track, Ten Sovereigns disputed the lead from the start and drew away from his opponents in the closing stages to win by two and three quarter lengths. After the race Aidan O'Brien commented \\"We knew he was very good from last year but we trained him for a Guineas and he hadn‚Äôt really clicked into sprinting at Ascot. We knew his last few works before coming here that he was right there again. He's like all those good athletes, he goes a very high pace very easily, and when you ask him, he quickens\\". At York Racecourse on 23 August Ten Sovereigns was dropped back to five furlongs and started 13/8 favourite for the Nunthorpe Stakes but after tracking the leaders he faded in the closing stages and finished sixth of the eleven runners behind Battaash. The colt was then sent to Australia to contest The Everest, a valuable sprint race over 1200 metres at Randwick Racecourse on 19 October. He was never in serious contention and finished last.

Early years and working life She was born into a Jewish family in Amsterdam. Her father was Moritz Meyer (1865‚Äì1906); her mother, Sophie Meyer- Philips (1868‚Äì1955), was a cousin and a niece of the founders of the Philips lightbulb factory, later the Philips Company in Eindhoven. She started work at the age of 18 and for the first ten years was a shorthand typist. In 1923 she and Annette Monasch took over the Holland Typing Office (HTO), a company that provided typing and copy services, as well as being one of the first employment agencies in the Netherlands, providing shorthand typists, and later selling typewriters. Social involvement In 1923 Meyer became a member of the Pacifist Women's League; the Dutch section of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, of which she became secretary. President at the time was Cornelia Ramondt-Hirschmann. In the 1930s, Meyer served on various committees, among which were ones for the assistance and relief of young German refugees and for victims of the Spanish Civil War. She participated in the Wuppertal Committee and helped support the resistance in Germany. From 1930 to 1936 she was a member of the SDAP. She was one of the founders of the National Peace Centre (NVC) on 13 August 1936 and in January 1937 with CPN chairman Ko Beuzemaker and railway unionist Nathan Nathans, she attended an International Conference for Aid to Republican Spain, which was held in Paris. In 1937 she met Hans Ebeling, with whom she was to become a close friend. Selma Meyer and the HTO played an important part in the publication of Kameradschaft, a magazine by Ebeling and Theo Hespers, and helped both to create a safe haven. She also financially supported Kameradschaft and other publications by Ebeling and Hespers. In addition, she was in charge of the Holland Typing Office, which she also enlisted for her activism and which only employed women. The magazine Kameradschaft was printed at the HTO in Amsterdam. By the end of 1939 Selma Meyer was a key-person at the 'Sonderfahndungsliste' by the 'Abwehr Wilhelmshaven'. The people on the list were to be traced and questioned directly after the German invasion of the Netherlands. In April 1940 Meyer became ill. By the time the German troops invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940, she had travelled to Zeeland to recover. From there she fled to France. Because of concerns for her mother and her employees at the HTO, she returned to Amsterdam and joined the Dutch resistance. On 26 October 1940 she was arrested. After interrogation in Amsterdam and The Hague, Meyer was transferred to Berlin in mid-November to be interrogated by the Gestapo in the prison of Berlin-Moabit. In January 1941 Meyer got peritonitis and was taken to the J√ºdisches Krankenhaus der Gemeinde zu Berlin. There she died, aged 50, of complications that occurred after surgery. Shebwas buried in an unmarked grave at the Jewish cemetery in Wei√üensee.

During the Second World War he was the chief scientist at the Royal Navy's Anti-Submarine Experimental Establishment in Fairlie, Scotland, where he oversaw the development of improved techniques for detecting submarines. Biography John Keith Roberts was born in the Melbourne suburb of Kew on 16 April 1897, the eldest of the two children of Henry Charles Roberts, a stockbroker, and his wife Winifred Mary French. He had a sister, Winifred. He was educated at Camberwell Grammar School, from which he graduated in 1913. Although he had passed the entrance examinations to university, he was, at age 16, too young to matriculate. He therefore spent a year with a firm in Melbourne, where he learned bookkeeping and business methods. Roberts entered the University of Melbourne, where he enrolled in science. He initially intended to study chemistry, but became fascinated with physics. He received in BSc in 1918, and then his MSc in 1920. He was awarded the Dixson scholarship in natural philosophy, and a government research scholarship. He became a demonstrator in physics, and assisted Professor Thomas Laby in his work on the mechanical equivalent of heat. Roberts published two papers (one with Laby) on the subject in 1922. Roberts was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship to study in England. On Laby's advice he studied under Sir Ernest Rutherford at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory as a member of Trinity College, Cambridge. Roberts was briefly involved in the Rutherford's unsuccessful initial search for the neutron, but his main focus was on conservation of energy in hydrogen discharge. In 1922, Rutherford recommended Roberts to Sir Joseph Petavel at the National Physical Laboratory. That October, Roberts took up a position there as a junior assistant in the Heat Section of the Physics Department, which was then headed by G. W. C. Kaye, where he studied the thermal properties of metallic crystals, publishing two papers on the thermal conductivity and expansion of bismuth. The following year, Roberts was promoted to Scientific Officer, and received his PhD from Cambridge. On 5 June 1924 Roberts married Margaret Sylvia Whyte, a divorcee and the daughter of the wallpaper magnate Harold Sanderson of Arthur Sanderson & Sons, in a Kensington, London, registry office. They had two daughters. In 1924 he developed a pain in his hip which was initially diagnosed as arthritis, but turned out to be tuberculosis, and he was hospitalised in a sanatorium in Switzerland for the next four years. While there he wrote a book, Heat and Thermodynamics (1928). His position at the National Physical Laboratory could not be held for this long, but on his return to England in 1928 he became a Moseley Research Student of the Royal Society at the Cavendish Laboratory. He became interested in functioning of the Pirani gauge, with which he investigated the thermal conductivities of gases, and of the heat conveyed to a gas by a hot wire. In 1933 he joined the Colloid Science Laboratory at Cambridge as its assistant director of research. He, he conducted ground- breaking research into the energy exchanges between hot metal surfaces and gases in contact with them, particularly hydrogen, and later oxygen. It was for this work that Cambridge awarded him a ScD and he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1942. Soon after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Roberts became a scientific advisor to the Royal Navy, working at the Naval Research Establishment on the River Clyde in Scotland and then at the Naval Research Establishment on the River Forth, where he developed techniques for degaussing ships to avoid magnetic mines, and for minesweeping. In 1942 he was appointed the chief scientist at the Anti-Submarine Experimental Establishment in Fairlie, Scotland. In 1943 he travelled to the United States to promote greater cooperation between scientists working for the two nations' navies. He was elected a Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge and harboured an ambition to one day direct the Mond Cryogenic Laboratory, but in March 1944 he developed a glandular infection, and then pneumonia, from which he did not recover. He died in Marylebone, London, on 26 April 1944, and his remains were cremated. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.

Biography  Vidal was born in Cartagena de Indias in 1739 to Pedro Luis Vidal and Josefina Marcelina Madrigal y Vald√©s. He was educated at the Colegio de San Bartolom√©, Santa F√© in Bogot√°, Colombia and earned degrees in civil and canon law in 1763. He worked for 20 years as an attorney in Colombia for both the Spanish government and private clients, including serving as an interim governor in Popay√°n and Quito. He also worked as a law professor at the Colegio Seminario de San Bartolom√©. In 1790, he was posted to Louisiana as a governmental legal adviser (auditor de guerra), arriving in New Orleans on March 17, 1791. Vidal's relationship with The Cabildo was contentious with disputes over larger issues like smallpox vaccination, fire hazards, and slavery, as well as minutia around protocol. Following the death of Louisiana Governor Manuel Gayoso de Lemos of yellow fever on July 18, 1799, Vidal was named civil governor of Spanish Louisiana alongside Col. Francisco Bouligny, who was named military governor of the territory, under the authority of the new Acting Governor General Sebasti√°n Calvo de la Puerta, 1st Marquess of Casa Calvo. After Bouligny's death, Vidal continued to serve as lieutenant-governor under Casa Calvo until the last Spanish governor, Juan Manuel de Salcedo, arrived to oversee implementation of the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso and the return of Louisiana to France. After the transfer of Louisiana to the United States was complete, Vidal removed to Pensacola, capital of Spanish West Florida, where he served as auditor de guerra until his death in 1806. Personal life Vidal was described as a \\"shameless rou√© with a face like a monkey,\\" and in his official acts he was very sensitive to the importance of his position. He complained to Spanish officials on several occasions about public slights and offences. Starting in 1800, Vidal acquired through purchase and a royal grant several properties along Bayou St. John in New Orleans to establish a plantation. He sold the property in 1804, following the sale of Louisiana. Vidal acknowledged at least three children ‚Äî Maria Josefa, Mercedes, and Carolina ‚Äî born through pla√ßage relationships with free women of color. Maria Josefa was left with her mother, Rosa Noriega, in Colombia when Vidal moved to Louisiana. In Louisiana, he entered into a relationship with Eufrosina Hisnard, who at the time was about 15 years old. Hisnard and Vidal had Mercedes and Carolina, along with a son who died in infancy. Hisnard and Vidal's daughters were accepted as part of Vidal's social circle without scandal. Following Vidal's death, Mercedes and her mother sought help from U.S. authorities in the newly acquired Florida Territory in settling Vidal's estate, which led to a conflict between Andrew Jackson, the newly appointed military commissioner and governor, and the last Spanish governor of Florida, Jos√© Mar√≠a Callava.

It began with the April 25, 1855 issue. The paper is currently published weekly. The paper claims to be the \\"First Republican paper printed in the USA.\\"  History  The paper was founded by Martin C. Rice in 1855, shortly after the formation of the Republican Party in New York, and about a year after the Republican Party's beginnings in Wisconsin. Rice, who was born in 1827 in St. Lawrence County, had moved to Chautauqua with his family in 1832. The first issue went out on April 25, 1855. In 1861, the paper famously covered the meeting of Abraham Lincoln and Westfield resident Grace Bedell. Bedell, a young girl, had written Lincoln and suggested growing a beard would improve his appearance. Lincoln returned a letter seeming to gently dismiss the idea, but on a train tour through New York he stopped at Westfield and during a speech asked if Bedell was in the crowd, stating that it had been her suggestion that had prompted the growing of his beard during that campaign. The February 20, 1861 edition of the paper recounts the story in a small item on the final page: > \\"He stated that soon after his nomination he received a letter from a little > girl in this place, making some comments on his personal appearance, and > suggesting that his looks would be improved by whiskers, and that having no > little girl to answer the letter, he answered it himself, and as the crowd > crowd see, had acted upon her suggestion; and desired if the little girl was > in the crowd, that she would come forward. The little Miss alluded to is a > daughter of Mr. Bedell, a resident of this place, and is some twelve years > of age. She was soon brought forward, and Lincoln stepped from the car, > shook hands with her, kissed her, and asked how she liked the improvements > go advised him to make. Every one was feeling so well a! this time, and > there I were so many good-natured remarks that our reporter's pencil did not > catch the reply.\\" Rice continued to run it until 1873, after which it passed to F. A. Hall, and later Alfred E. Rose. From 1889 through 1939, H. W. Thompson was publisher, and it remained in the Thompson family until 1963, at which point it was sold to Ogden Newspapers.

His father went to medical school in Italy, where Dr. Levy learned to speak Italian, in addition to English in school and Hebrew at home. At the age of seven, he immigrated to the United States. After his father's residency training in obstetrics and gynecology in New York City, his family settled in rural northern upstate New York close to Montreal, where his dad joined a solo Obstetrics and gynecology practice. Growing up, Levy spent his summers with his father's family in Israel. Dr. Levy went onto attend local schools before his last two years of High School, which he spent at Choate Rosemary Hall, a private boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut. Athletic career During his time at Choate Rosemary Hall he became interested in rowing, which eventually became his passion and earned him a roster spot on the Division I rowing team at Darthmouth College where he was an oarsman between the years 1989‚Äì1993. During this time he also won 2 gold medals at the Maccabiah Games in 1990 and joined the U.S. Junior National Rowing team in 1991. He was also awarded the Woodhead award for grit. Dr. Levy also frequently takes part in marathons and half iron man competitions across the country. Higher education and training Levy went to Dartmouth College to study molecular biology and biochemistry. He began medical school in 1993 at The George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., where he became interested in Orthopedic Surgery. However, when he did not secure the summer orthopedic internship after his freshman year, he chose to do a summer research project with Dr. Laligam Sekhar, the Chairman of Neurosurgery at George Washington University at the time, since then neurosurgery became his focus. Following graduation in 1997, Levy began his surgical internships and training in neurosurgery at the University of Pittsburgh, one of the highest volume programs in the country. As a young intern, he quickly learned the importance of innovation and the obligation to push the field forward for better care of neurosurgical patients. Following in the footsteps of Dr. Peter Jannetta, the ‚Äúfather of microvascular decompression,‚Äù and Dr. Dade Lunsford, who introduced Gamma-knife radiosurgery to the University of Pittsburgh, Levy pursued minimally invasive endovascular neurosurgery by spending 2 years of his residency in Buffalo, as a fellow under Dr. L. Nelson Hopkins, the ‚Äúfather of neurointerventional surgery\\". He completed his fellowship training in 2003 and returned to Pittsburgh to finish his residency training in 2004. In later years, Levy also completed his Master of Business Administration at Northeastern University and graduated magna cum laude in 2013. Academic and professional career Levy started his academic and professional career as an Associate Professor of Neurosurgery and Radiology at the State University of New York (SUNy) at Buffalo in 2004. The following year in 2005, he became the Director for Stroke Research, and Co- Director of Cerebrovascular Surgery at the Department of Neurosurgery, SUNY at Buffalo. He was also appointed as Co-Director of Kaleida Health Stroke Center and the Director of Endovascular Stroke Treatment and Research in 2006. He also served as the Endovascular Fellowship Program Director for the Department of Neurosurgery, SUNY at Buffalo from 2006 to 2013. In 2010, Levy was promoted to the title of Professor of Neurosurgery and Radiology becoming one of the youngest tenured professors in the SUNY system. Subsequently, in 2013 when Dr. L. Nelson Hopkins retired as the Chair of Neurosurgery, Levy rapidly emerged as the top candidate among several candidates across the nation, demonstrating the administrative, scientific, clinical, leadership and visionary skills necessary for the growth of the department. Since becoming the Chairman at University at Buffalo, Neurosurgery, Levy has recruited some of the best trained young neurosurgeons and more than doubled the size of the faculty. Leading by example, he promoted the academic productivity of the department, which secured a top 5 ranking for endovascular neurosurgery. Levy served as an invited Guest Examiner for Oral Examinations for the American Board of Neurosurgeons in 2014, 2016, 2017, and in 2018 became Director.

It was established in Altamura in 1747 by Charles III of Bourbon, following the idea of the archpriest of Altamura Cathedral Marcello Papiniano Cusani.raucci-2003, pag. 349 It was officially closed in 1812, mainly due to the lack of funds, even though some documents kept inside library Archivio capitolare in Altamura show that professors continued to teach until 1821.raucci-2003, pag. 360 Based on the statements of notable scholars, such as Bernardo Tanucci and Vitangelo Bisceglia, it can be concluded that the university had an excellent reputation at that time. Because of the university, Tanucci described Altamura as Appula Atene (\\"Apulia's Athens\\"). The subjects taught underwent considerable change over the history of the university. In total, the following subjects were taught: Law, ecclesiastical law, Latin, Ancient Greek, Hebrew, mathematics, geometry, physics, chemistry, botany, agronomy, mineralogy, medicine and theology.raucci-2003 The main sources about the history of the university are the documents stored in Altamura's libraries, mainly Archivio capitolare and Archivio Biblioteca Museo Civico (A.B.M.C.). The University of Altamura undoubtedly helped to spread scientific knowledge inside Altamura and the Kingdom of Naples. Prior to the founding of the university, there was very little or no interest at all in science.  History  The University of Altamura was established in 1747 by the king Charles III of Spain. The idea was from the archpriest of Altamura Cathedral, Marcello Papiniano Cusani, who, a few months earlier, suggested using the money saved inside a fund called Monte a Moltiplicoin order to establish a university. The funds had already started to be collected as early as the XVII century but for a different purpose, i.e. converting Altamura Cathedral in a bishopric. It can be stated that, without Marcello Papiniano Cusani, there wouldn't have been any university in Altamura. Moreover, Charles III liked the idea, since it was compatible with his reform policy, aimed at providing a secular education, by opening royal schools and universities.https://1799altamura.wordpress.com/il- settecento/universita-degli-studi/ Anyway, the funds of Monte a Moltiplico were insufficient to maintain a university, and, since the beginning, the rectors had to solve financial difficulties, which compromised the variety of the courses provided by the university. Cusani, determined, managed to finance the university with the offers from four religious institutions of the city (). The idea of a university in Altamura was well received by Altamurans, but most people thought that it would be a Jesuit seminary. Jesuits weren't in a good relationship with many ministers of the Kingdom of Naples; therefore, the initial idea of a Jesuit seminary was abandoned.raucci-2003, pag. 350 bolognese-zecher, pag. 12  The Rectorship of Msgr. Gioacchino de Gemmis  In 1782, Gioacchino de Gemmis became archpriest and rector, and he managed to renovate the University of Altamura.raucci-2003, pag. 354 De Gemmis wanted to reform the University of Altamura, by providing more scientific and technical courses. Gioacchino de Gemmis was the author of a university reform program and he started courses of experimental physics, botany, mineralogy and it made it forbidden to write notes during the lessons. Previously, the students had to take notes during the lessons; in order to avoid distracting the students from the lessons because of the notes, it was decided that the teaching material should be printed instead. A library was also established which, over time, grew bigger thanks to the donations of de Gemmis himself and of private citizens.raucci-2003, pag. 355 He also asked Vitangelo Bisceglia to come to teach botany to Altamura and to become his vicar.uominiill-1822-vol9 Gioacchino de Gemmis promoted among teachers the habit of meeting in the evening in his living room to discuss teaching. Later on, those evening meetings were extended also to lawyers, doctors, nobles and traders of the city, and in his living room discussions also embraced economics, politics, philosophy and social themes.raucci-2003, pag. 355-356  Year 1799  In 1799, the overthrow of the Bournons dynasty, the birth of the Parthenopean Republic, the so-called Altamuran Revolution and the return of the Bourbons after a few months halted the courses as well as any other activity of the university. Inside the city of Altamura, there was widespread fear. The harassment occurred on a daily basis, citizens \\"every day were stopped and spoiled\\". Many former professors of the university, such as Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi were accused of having joined the riots and they had to flee. Gioacchino de Gemmis also had to leave the city and he was replaced by rector Maffione di Bisceglie.raucci-2003, pagg. 359-360  Closure  In 1806, with the new king Joseph Bonaparte, determined to end feudalism, Gioacchino de Gemmis was appointed again as rector of the University of Altamura, but the lack of funds still was a big issue. In the period 1809-1812, the number of students fell from 100 to 70 and in 1812 courses were officially closed, even though some documents stored in library Archivio capitolare of Altamura show that professors continued to teach until 1821.  After the closure  After the university was closed, somebody considered reopening it but, after the European Restoration and the return of the Bourbon dynasty, things became more complicated. In the 1840s, Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi and Gioacchiono Grimaldi talked to the mayor of Altamura and proposed using the funds of- Monte a Moltiplico in order to open a science experiment room (). After their project was approved, both of them collected the instruments needed and in a short time they managed to create an experiment room for physics and mineralogy \\"gabinetto fisico mineralogico\\". The collection of instruments and devices comprised over 115 instruments. Even the experiment room risked being closed and, in 1865, it was given to a high school lyceum of Altamura, (Istituto Tecnico Ginnasiale) and since then it was used by the school as teaching materials. Today the collection belongs to the same high school, located in piazza Zanardelli, called liceo classico \\"Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi\\". Over the years, the collection grew bigger, while some old and worn out tools disappeared; nevertheless, the collection of ancient instruments is still big, various and rich.raucci-2003, pagg. 360-361 In 2013, the classical lyceum of Altamura started an auction in order to sell 989 scientific instruments \\"broken, obsolete or unusable\\". A few local politicians expressed fears and contacted the principal of the high school. The principal explained that the scientific instruments being auctioned were modern and they had no historical value; he also added that the ancient instruments of the collection are and will always be \\"absolutely untouchable\\".  The environment  The university started with courses focused on history and ancient languages, but soon it changed its inherent structure. Rector Gioacchino de Gemmis was the main promoter of the reformation of the university, and he wanted it to also incorporate scientific and technical subjects. Students educated in those disciplines could modernize agriculture and production systems of the region. In the 1780s, a scientific circle of students and professors devoted to math and science () developed. Those took care of obtaining scientific books and keeping up-to-date. At that time, scientific subjects weren't much appreciated in the city and in the whole kingdom. In one of his writings, Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi recounted how hard it was for his Altamuran friend - Paolo Ruggeri - to study math, which was his favorite subject. Ruggeri's father was an Altamuran doctor who wanted his father to study theology. When Ruggeri came back to his hometown Altamura, he brought some math books with him, that his father confiscated, ordering him to devote himself to theology. But Ruggeri, breaking his father's orders, often went to the house of Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi and his brother in order to study, borrowed math books from them and went to the nearby countryside of Altamura in order to study. It also occurred that Ruggeri lost some books or that his father had them confiscated, asking a servant to give the books back to Cagnazzi and to not borrow them anymore. Rector Gioacchino de Gemmis esteemed him very much and asked him to become a math professor at the University of Altamura. He successfully taught for a few years, before becoming ill with pulmonary tuberculosis and dying very young.raucci-2003, pag. 354, note 20Taken from a manuscript by Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi, stored in library Archivio Biblioteca Museo Civico (A.B.M.C.), Altamura, Fondo Museo Civico, F. 344, c. 30-32.  Professors  Many professors taught in the University of Altamura, and one of those was the founder of the university himself, Marcello Papiniano Cusani, who taught law and canon law (at that time those were called i due diritti, \\"the two legal frameworks\\").  Giuseppe Carlucci  One of the first and most notable professors of the university was Giuseppe Carlucci. In 1749, he was given the teaching of philosophy and geometry. He was Altamuran and he was described as a professor of \\"supreme justice, probity and humanity\\". Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi, in his autobiography, remembers him as an open-minded person, who \\"hated the superstition that was promoted by silly priests\\". He also studied mathematics and philosophy, and he was largely self-taught since at that time there was \\"little love for these sciences\\"raucci-2003, pag. 352lamiavita-1944, pag. 13 In order to show his scientific skills, he wrote a treatise in which he demonstrated the certainty of the Earth's motion, dismissing the beliefs and oppositions of that period. The work earned him the admiration of many scholars of that period. In particular, Msgr. Celestino Galiani greatly appreciated his treatise in a letter dated 30 November 1748.  Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi  upright Another notable teacher was Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi, who was an ex-student of the same university selected to be the assistant of Professor Giuseppe Carlucci for the chair of philosophy and geometry. Following Carlucci's death, he took up his position.raucci-2003, pag. 357 The work of Cagnazzi was devoted to promoting scientific knowledge, which, at that time, was still at an early stage in the Kingdom of Naples. In particular, he provided the university library of scientific books and provided the students with scientific tools for experiments.  Vitangelo Bisceglia  upright In 1783, Vitangelo Bisceglia was invited to Altamura by rector Gioacchino de Gemmis, in order for him to teach and become his vicar. Inside the university, Bisceglia could teach, among other things, his favorite subject, i.e. botany, and he also managed the university. In that period, Bisceglia showed that he was also skilled in the field of history and law; he wrote a popular treatise entitled Difesa dei dritti e prerogative della real chiesa di Altamura contro le pretensioni del Vescovo di Gravina (written in Altamura on 7 maggio 1795), in which he proved that the privileges and tax exemptions enjoyed by Altamura Cathedral were legal, ending a long-lasting dispute with the bishop of nearby city Gravina in Puglia. This work granted him a great deal of popularity. He also established a small botanic garden inside the university.raucci-2003, pag. 356 note 26  Other professors  Other noteworthy professors were Leopoldo Laudati, professor of Ancient Greek and Hebrew grammar, as well as Manfredi, Angelastri and Ruggiero.bolognese- zecher, pag. 8  Rectors  *Marcello Papiniano Cusani (1748-1752) * Giuseppe Mastrilli (1753-) * Bruno Andrisani * Celestino Guidotti * Gioacchino de Gemmis (1782-) * Maffione di Bisceglie * Gioacchino de Gemmis (1806-1812) See also * List of Italian universities * Altamura * Gioacchino de Gemmis * Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi * Vitangelo Bisceglia References Bibliography   Altamura Buildings and structures in the Province of Bari Education in Apulia ","title":"University of Altamura"},{"id":"58726614","text":"Twin Otter refueling operation at Midpoint Charlie Mid Point is a skiway located in the East Antarctic Ice Sheet at midway between Zucchelli Station and the inland Concordia Station.

It is located at 4835 Flat Bridge Road inside the Panola Mountain State Park. It is one and a half stories, constructed in the Plantation Plain style.  History  The Parker house is of the Plantation Plain style and one-and-a-half stories tall. It is three bays wide and one room deep, with an extra travelers room adjacent to the front porch. There are two chimneys, one on each end wall. Aaron Parker Jr. was born November 12, 1788 in North Carolina to Aaron and Charity Shuffield Parker, Sr. The family moved to Clarke County, Georgia the following year, and Parker was raised there. In 1806 he married Margaret Browning (born June 30, 1789), also originally from North Carolina. The couple would eventually have 14 children over 55 years of marriage. Parker purchased land and moved his family from Clarke County in the spring of 1822. Parker purchased additional plots of land in the area and built the house here around 1830. At the time the land was part of Henry County (but would be split off to form Rockdale County in 1870). Parker was active in the community, serving as county justice of the peace and postmaster general, but his primary occupation was farming. By 1850 he owned almost of land, as well as 15 slaves. (That increased to 24 slaves by 1860, though his land holdings had decreased to ). Parker died on January 5, 1881. His wife had died 10 years earlier. Both are buried in a cemetery in Rockdale County. His children inherited his property including of remaining land. The house and land were sold several times during the 20th century. At times the house was rented to tenants. In 1991 the property was being developed into the Southerness Golf Club, and the house was to be demolished. Community efforts prevented that, and instead the golf course incorporated the house, using the first floor as an office. A paved turn-around connected to the parking lot was built surrounding the house and the rest of the golf club's buildings were built nearby. The rear (north) facade of the house is directly adjacent to pavement but the other sides of the house are buffered by a small yard with a low rock wall. While it was included in the golf club, several changes were made including: new wood siding, reconstruction of the rear porch, brick veneer on the chimneys, and new doors and windows. The golf course eventually closed and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources bought the property for $790,000 in 2004. Since then the state has demolished the former golf club buildings and made other changes to create a more rural landscape. The Rockdale County Historical Society partnered with the state to perform a structural assessment and restore the house, which was in a \\"deplorable\\" condition. Although it is not open to visitors generally, the park sometimes holds living history demonstrations at the house.

As one of 44 countries, India prepared the agenda for the Bretton Woods Conference in June 1944. The Indian delegation was led by Jeremy Raisman, who was a finance member of the Indian government and proposed the name ‚ÄúInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development‚Äù. India received its first bank loan of US$34million from the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development in November 1948 for railway rehabilitation. Since then, India has become the country with the largest country program and its lending portfolio of the World Bank group inheres of 104 operations with a total volume of $27.1 billion.  Economy of India  India is one of the fastest growing countries in the world. According to the annual report of the IMF, India shows a GDP growth rate of 7.3% for 2018. India is the third largest country in purchasing power parity and is expected to keep their annual growth rate. India was able to lift 133 million people out of poverty between 1994 and 2012. Still, with a population of 1.3 billion people, India shows 5% of its population living in extreme poverty. In June 2018, India experienced a current account deficit of US$15.8 billion that represents the highest deficit within the last five years. India exported US$261billion in 2016, which makes it the 17th largest export country in the world. However, India's export structure is still not really diversified and is primarily focused on commodity and primary goods. Diamonds and jewelry and packaged medications accounted for around 20% of the export sector.was this helpful  Projects and Alliances   Country Partnership Framework for India  The World Bank lends around US$27.1 million to India, which makes it the largest country of IBRD support. In September 2018, the World Bank Group began a new partnership with India. The partnership emphasizes an efficient and sustainable growth path and fosters competitiveness to create new job opportunities and investments in human capital. It is embedded in the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations and focuses on strengthening of public-sector institutions in order to create strong governance. The country partnership framework between the World Bank and India is the largest country partnership framework in the World Bank Group and it supports India's transition to a middle-income country.  Education  School boys learning computers in Goa, India  Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA)  The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan is a government program which was first issued in 2001. The program aimed to provide elementary education for around 200 million children across the country. The program is supported by the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Kingdom DFID, but is governmental led. During the first phase in 2001 - 2003, the World Bank contributed US$500 million, before the World Bank increased its contribution in a second phase by additional US$600 million. In 2009, India passed its Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act that mandated elementary education as a fundamental right. The number of out-of-school children declined in India by 29.1 million from 2001 to 2013 and the number of children in elementary education increased steadily to 200 million. In 2012, 95 percent of the children had access to primary education. The Indian government and the World Bank agreed on a new credit agreement with a total volume of US$1006 million to support and finance SSA III. The program focuses on improving quality and developing learning indicators by the National Council for Education Research and Training in order to evaluate children's progress in acquiring educational knowledge.  Infrastructure   The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana Project  The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana aims to connect unconnected habitations with all-weather roads. Key to the program is an all-weather access to the respective roads. The program was first set into place in December 2000 and has connected more than 80% of communities in the country. The program was launched by then minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and is under the control of the ministry of rural development. To guarantee proper execution of the program, three management mechanisms have been put in place. Therefore, the program emphasizes in house quality control, a structured independent quality monitoring and independent national quality monitors which are arranged by the National Rural Roads Development Agency to inspect the progress and provide guidance to the local authorities. The World Bank initially started to finance the program in 2004. The World Bank Group agreed on an additional US$500million loan to finance the PMGSY in May 2018 and now has invested US$1.8billion into the program. The program has converted around 35,000 km of rural roads to all-weather roads to the benefit of 8 million people.  Healthcare   Uttarakhand Health Systems Development Project  The Uttarakhand Health Systems Development Project (UKHSDP) is a project intended to be implemented over a period of six years, beginning with its approval by the World Bank in 2017 and ending with an expected completion date of September 2023. The UKHSDP was issued through the International Development Association (IDA) in conjunction with the Department of Medical Health and Family Welfare of the government of Uttarakhand. The goal of the project is to \\"support Uttarakhand in improving the access to and quality of health services, and providing health financial risk protection\\" and the project has a total project cost of USD$125 million, USD$100 million of which was awarded by the World Bank. The remaining USD$25 million was funded by the local government. The need for the project stems from unequal access to quality health care, which is impeded by the size and distribution of settlements paired with the region's topography. The Uttarakhand region is a very hilly, mountainous region that sees a population spread out between major cities with a density of more than 500 people per square kilometer to rural areas with less than 50 people per square kilometer. The UKHSDP notes that there is a deep employment asymmetry among its most rural areas with 48% vacancies in its listings for medical officers and 75% vacancies for medical specialists. The project has two component areas: innovations in the private sector and stewardship and system improvement. The first component focuses on a logistical fix to the current healthcare system and builds off a previously completed IDA project from 2008. The goal is to hire outside contractors in multiple areas to help with contract management and other system-wide logistical support positions. The system as a whole would improve the supply chain, multi-sectoral communication, data management, and information systems implementation. The second component address the direct action part of their original issue of getting health professionals to rural areas and has three subcategories: mobile specialty units, integration of Public-Private partnership (PPP) centers, and expanding the RSBY health coverage to adolescent primary care and care for the poor affected with Noncommunicable diseases (NCD's). As of October 1, 2019 the project's Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Overall Implementation Progress (IP) has been moderately satisfactory, an improvement from its prior rating of moderately unsatisfactory.  Tamil Nadu Health System Reform Program  The Tamil Nadu Health System Reform Program is a relatively new project having been approved in March 2019. If all goes as planned the expected closing date for the reform project would be May 2024. A large scale project in size, the cost estimated for the total project is USD 5.515 billion. The contribution by the World bank to the project is USD 287 million. Currently as the project stands, it seeks to expand on a project the Tamil Nadu government just completed with the World bank in 2015. This previous project, known as the \\"Tamil Nadu Health Additional Financing project\\" sought to extend financing for a project started in 2004 called the Tamil Nadu Health Systems project. This project established the goals to fix many of the system wide issues the region was facing. The original goal was to improve healthcare sector effectiveness and efficiency in providing aid to many of the poor and underrepresented groups. The current project looks to pick up where Tamil Nadu Health systems project left off by addressing a complex agenda for health care service delivery. While the previous project sought to establish networks and better system wide execution of healthcare and its surveillance ability, the current project takes a results based approach in the hopes of directly influencing three areas of growth; 1)Quality of care 2)non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injury and 3)equity of healthcare access. These three categories highlight needs in the greater Tamil Nadu providence for healthcare reform to help bring the state to a more modern healthcare environment. Implementation of these categorical objectives are hoped to be realized through facility accreditation and procedures to ensure healthcare quality consistency, better quality of care towards trauma, mental health, and NCDs, and improved access for geographically disadvantaged and well as financially disadvantaged. The program notes deficiencies in current healthcare equity by showing large ranges in percentage by cities that have access to contraceptives as well as vaccinations. The program sites NCDs as a rapidly prevailing issue in the state due to the changing of the demographic within it. As the population continues to shift towards an aging population the prevalence of NCDs like hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cancer become evermore concerning, especially in regards to access to healthcare treatment for these diseases across the state as a whole. Currently as it stands, only USD 720,000 has been disbursed on the project and much of the initial reporting is waiting on board to be generated by the government to oversee reporting numbers.

Hays has lived on Great Gull Island for six months of each year since 1969 in her capacity as chair of the Great Gull Island committee at the American Museum of Natural History. As of 2014, this work saw the island's tern population increase tenfold compared to the level of 1969. Early life Helen Hays grew up in Johnstown, New York. She attended Wellesley College, graduating with a bachelor's degree in biology in 1953. She next conducted graduate work in Manitoba at Cornell University‚Äôs Delta Waterfowl field station, but both Cornell and Wellesley refused to credit her with a master's degree for her work, studying ruddy duck breeding biology; Wellesley said her study was \\"not relevant\\". Nevertheless, her research into ruddy ducks was eventually published in the leading peer-reviewed ornithological journal in North America, The Auk, as well as the Handbook of North American Birds. Career Without an advanced degree, Hays began her career in 1956 in low-level positions cataloguing specimens and performing secretarial work. In 1969 Hays made her first trip to Great Gull Island, which the American Museum of Natural History had recently purchased. At that time hunting had greatly reduced the numbers of breeding pairs of common terns and roseate terns in North America. In 1969 Hays began spending six months of the year on the island working to restore the local population. Hays lives in Manhattan in the other portion of the year. During her stays on the island, she lives in former barracks and is assisted by other volunteer conservationists in her work. The researchers weigh the terns and help to monitor hatchlings and improve nesting conditions for them. As of 2014, over 26,000 terns lived on the island, more than 10 times the number when Hays started her work. Awards Hays has received the Conservation Service Award from the United States Department of the Interior, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the New York chapter of the National Audubon Society, and an Alumnae Achievement Award from Wellesley.

Known for his paint pigment drawings and abstract sculptures, Phipps experiments with various forms and materials, including steel, bronze, wood, composites, plaster, glass, and marble. He was also a racecar driver and is a member of the Phipps family. Phipps‚Äô work has been exhibited at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center at Colorado College, the Ann Norton Sculpture Garden in West Palm Beach, the New York Studio School, the Center for Creative Education in West Palm Beach, the Fritz Gallery, MM Fine Arts Gallery in Southampton, New York, Coral Springs Museum of Art, Coral Springs, Florida, and Gallery 1608 in West Palm. His work has also been accepted into the permanent collections of the Coral Springs Museum of Art, the Harn Museum of Art in Gainesville, Florida, and the Tufts University Art Gallery.  Life  Born in Virginia to Lady Phoebe Pleydell-Bouverie and Hubert Beaumont Phipps, Phipps started drawing at an early age. He developed skills as an illustrator, initially transcribing political cartoons. His father owned and operated local newspaper publications and was well-known in the cattle-breeding and horse racing circles. After his father died, Phipps then went to live with guardians in Palm Beach, Florida. He attended Deerfield Academy. At Deerfield, Phipps discovered a passion for flying, something that he would continue throughout life. Since then, he has logged more than 3,500 hours as a pilot-in-command in both rotorcraft and fixed wing. He is the cousin of sculptor Susan Phipps Cochran. In 1974, Phipps studied at The Art Student's League in Manhattan. Later, in 1978, Phipps attended the San Francisco Art Institute before pursuing a career as a professional race car driver. Phipps and his TIGA FA 82From 1979 to 1985, Phipps turned in solid performances, including winning the SCCA Formula Atlantic National championship, driving a Ralt RT4 powered by Ford. Despite incurring serious injuries during testing at the Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma, California in 1983, Phipps recovered and went on to achieve wins in the Formula Atlantic Professional series at Willow Springs, California in 1984, and again in 1985. His professional teammates included Danny Sullivan at Garvin Brown Racing in 1982 and Michael Andretti at Ralt America in 1983. After retiring as a professional driver, Phipps turned his focus to art again. In 2001, he enrolled in IFAC in Miami to study computer animation, with additional training at Escape Studios in London. Phipps‚Äô interest in animation was specifically to learn how to model forms in the computer as reference for sculpting objects, using traditional media. In 2002, Phipps participated in Graham Nixon's drawing marathon at the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting, and Sculpture. It opened his ability to work in large-scale. Phipps was able to draw on his racing and aviation experiences, to develop a distinctive style. Phipps has studios in Virginia and New York City.  Work  Quantum Universe 46\\" x 61\\" Charcoal on paper  Drawings and paintings  Phipps has many approaches to drawing, including reference photos that he makes on long, cross-country flights and automatic drawing. He lets his subconscious guide the pen or brush until the work takes on a life of its own. Voyager (2015), Stainless steel, 25\\" x 8.5\\" x 7.5\\"  Sculptures  Phipps follows many of the traditional approaches of making sculpture, but also uses modern technologies, including 3D computer modeling, 3D scanning, 3D printing, and virtual reality. The sculpture continually changes until the final product reaches the foundry, the fabrication shop, or the CNC milling shop. A significant influence on Phipps‚Äô work comes from the view he gets while flying. It is not unusual for him to fly cross-country trips, including coast to coast. He amasses photographic images on these trips that are used as reference for sculpture, paintings, and drawings.

This novel is his fourth publication, and was shortlisted for the Ondaatje Prize in 2014. Its storyline is written from the perspective of a Pakistani family and details the events that ensued from the United States invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001.  Historical context  The event leading up to America's invasion of Afghanistan was the terrorist attacks that took place in the United States on September 11th. (also known as 9/11) This assault was categorized by a string of four coordinated strikes carried out by Al Qaeda operatives, members of a militant group of non-state actors whose origin can be traced to Afghanistan. These individuals hijacked four commercial airplanes and used them as guided missiles, by crashing them into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field in Southern Pennsylvania. This assault resulted in nearly 3,000 casualties that caused lasting devastation to permeate throughout the nation. The night of the attacks President Bush vowed to \\"win the war against terrorism,\\" and in a subsequent address to the Joint session of the 107th Congress he demand that the Taliban \\"deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of al Qaeda who hide in your land...Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.\\" This speech previewed the establishment of a new cabinet: the Department of Homeland Security, and marked the beginning of the United States' campaign against terrorism known as the Global War on Terror. On September 18, 2001, just a week after the attacks, President Bush signed a joint resolution that sanctioned military action against the perpetrators of the calculated strike on American soil. On October 7, 2001 the United States invaded Afghanistan and commenced Operation Enduring Freedom, which initially comprised air-strikes on Taliban and Al Qaeda forces, and a small group of special operations forces.  Synopsis  This novel details the events subsequent to the United States' invasion of Afghanistan and is set in post-9/11 Pakistan and Afghanistan. The narrative opens as Rohan and his son Jeo prepare for their journey to one of Pakistan's provincial capitals, Peshawar, to provide aid to the wounded that are being brought out of Afghanistan. Jeo, however, has other intentions and diverts from the plan. He ventures into Afghanistan with his (adopted) brother Mikal to assist the civilians who are caught in the conflict between the American soldiers and the Taliban. Unbeknownst to them, an ex-military officer seeking revenge against their father enacts a plot that will ensure their demise. Once they arrive in Afghanistan, the brothers are abandoned by their convoy and are forced to join the Taliban. Aslam's novel is a wrenching tale that illustrates lives upended by war, and the consequences of neo-orientalism from the standpoint of Eastern nations.  Characters   Main  *Jeo: Rohan's son and Naheed's husband who was forced into the Taliban along with his foster brother. Jeo dies at the hand of a vengeful Afghan woman during the attack on the Taliban headquarters, which is led by American soldiers and spiteful Afghan citizens from nearby villages. Jeo's death is the first concrete sign that the War on terror has severe consequences; his death also allows estranged lovers Mikal and Naheed to be together. *Mikal: Jeo's adopted brother and the love interest of Naheed. Mikal's parents died when he was a child and Rohan found him on a search for his late wife's painting. Mikal endures the most in this novel. After barely surfing the attack on Taliban headquarters he is taken by the Northern Alliance and held captive by a warlord who sells him to the Americans for upward of US$5,000. His experience with the American's highlights the nature of their misguided justice. *Rohan: Jeo's father, and the co-founder of the school Ardent Spirit, which he later relinquished to Ahmed the Moth after his wife's death. He was a very pious man who struggled with the death of his wife because she died an apostate. Rohan eventually became blind due to his proximity to an explosion, and is the man whom the novel is named after. *Naheed: Jeo's widow, who was in a relationship with Mikal prior to their union, never stopped loving Mikal and after Jeo's death they had a child together. Her longing for Mikal's return maintains the underlying love story that is presented by this novel. *Major Kyra: Ahmed the Moth's brother, an extremist, and former military officer who left the armed services following Pakistan's alignment with the West. He became the de facto owner of Ardent Spirit following his brother's death. Major Kyra viewed Rohan as an infidel and orchestrated Jeo and Mikal's forced induction into the Taliban, as a form of retaliation against him.  Supporting  *Sofia: The dead wife of Rohan and mother of Jeo. During her lifetime she was an artist and co-founder of Ardent Spirit. She is the reason for Rohan's guilt and why he is at peace with becoming blind, which he views as recompense for the way he treated his late wife. *Tara: Naheed's mother. She was instrumental in preventing the relationship between Mikal and Naheed from blossoming. *Basie: Mikal's older brother and Jeo's adopted brother. He married Jeo's sister and taught at St. Joseph's, a local Christian school that was seized by the jihadis of Ardent Spirit. Basie is the last connection that Mikal has to his birth family. *Yasmine: Jeo's sister, and the widow of Basie. She was a teacher at St. Joseph's, and bore Basie's child after his death. *Ahmed the Moth: Kyra's brother and the former student of Rohan who was killed by a mob of civilians in Afghanistan. He inherited Ardent Spirit from Rohan and under his leadership the school developed ties to ISI which selected certain students to become members of government run jihadi camps. *Ahmed: A pupil of Major Kyra's who modeled himself after Ahmed the Moth, and developed the plans for the siege of St. Joseph's. *Father Mede: An Englishmen who was the headmaster and founder of St. Josephs. The jihadis of Ardent Spirit wanted to martyr him in order to draw attention from the Western media and get them to cease their invasion of Afghanistan. They thought this would be successful being that he was a white man, and these type of people always secure the attention of the West.

Cohen (January 18, 1910? ‚Äì July 16, 1989?) was an American professor of chemistry, dismissed in 1941 from the City College of New York (CCNY) following investigations by the Rapp-Coudert Committee and alleged of Soviet espionage during 1953 hearings of the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS). Background CCNY, early 1900s, where Morris U. Cohen studied and taught In 1930, Morris U. Cohen received a BS from City College of New York. In 1932, he earned an MA and in 1935 a doctorate from Columbia University. Career In 1930, Cohen began teaching at City College of New York through 1941. He also taught at the New York Workers School and its successor the Jefferson School of Social Science. He later said, \\"Only a boy named Cohen could know what it meant to me to be offered a chance to teach at City College.\\" On May 23, 1939, Cohen was re-elected to the executive board of the New York College Teachers Union under new president Alonzo Myers of New York University (NYU), new board member Nellie R. Lederman, and incumbents Morris U. Schappes, George S. Counts, Robert Challman Henrietta Apfel, Samuel L. Hamilton, and Clinton W. Keyes. 1941 Rapp-Coudert New York State Senator Frederic Ren√© Coudert Jr.led the trial against Morris U. Cohen et. al On May 12, 1941, as the Board of Higher Education dismissed the first of fourteen teachers, David Goldway, from his position and vacated it, three of the remaining teachers had accusations of Communist affiliation made at them: Morris U. Cohen, Louis Balamuth, and Jack D. Foner. On July 17, 1941, the Board of Higher Education announced trial dates for suspended teachers: Morris U. Cohen's was set for August 7. On August 6, 1941, Willam martin Canning, English teacher at CCNY, testified that Morris U. Cohen frequently attended meetings of the \\"college unit\\" of the Communist Party USA. Canning said that the Party's college unit had organized at CCNY in 1936 and peaked at fifty members. On August 7, 1941, New York State Senator Frederic Ren√© Coudert Jr. of the Rapp-Coudert Committee warned William G. Mulligan, counsel for the New York City Teachers Union and of the New York College Teachers Union, that his clients would receive only five minutes to speak. When Mulligan objected, Coudert threatened to remove him from the court. The issue was whether four CCNY teachers taught \\"Communist dogma\\" in their classes. Teacher Edwin B. Burgum admitted that he had been editor of Science and Society, a \\"Marxian quarterly,\\" but denied being a Marxist. The other three teachers ‚Äì David Cohen, Morris U. Cohen, and Sidney Eisenberger ‚Äì waived immunity and testified that they were not Communist Party members. Morris U. Cohen added that he was a member of the Teachers Union. The same day, the committee \\"virtually forced the Board of Higher Education to adjourn the trial of Morris U. Cohen, suspended chemistry teacher yesterday because Dr. Cohen was prepared to produce documentary evidence of the graft and corruption at City College.\\" Samuel A. Neuberger, Cohen's attorney, who produced the information for his client, complained that the Coudert committee was planning to portray itself as \\"first disclosers of financial irregularities at the institution which his client has devote much of his time to eliminating.\\" Witnesses appearing before the committee included: Edwin Berry Burgum, David Cohen, Morris U. Cohen, Sidney Eisenberger, Sylvia Elfbein, Moses I. Finkelstein (Moses Finley), and Jack D. Foner. As part of graft and corruption allegations, Cohen charged that \\"certain members of the chemistry department (of City College) have persistently favored purchase of chemicals and supplies and equipment from Nazi-controlled firms.\\" Cohen, then under suspension for communist activity, found his trial brought to \\"an abrupt adjournment\\" just as he was about to introduce evidence regarding sale of Kemkit chemistry kits to students. On August 12, 1941, the Brooklyn Eagle ran a top headline that read \\"$200,000 College Monopoly Laid to Boro Teacher and 2.\\" Nathan H. Hecht, attorney and partner in the Kemkit Chemical Corporation made the charges. During the same hearing, Morris U. Cohen announced that he \\"had planned to disclose the kit racket in his own defense.\\" On August 13, 1941, the Rapp-Coudert Committee finally listened to the charges of graft and corruption in the CCNY chemistry department submitted in the Spring by Cohen. Chemical kits sold to students at CCNY, Brooklyn College, and Queens College came from Kemkit Chemical Corporation, whose chairman was David Hart (chair of chemistry at Brooklyn College); Frederick Weber, Charles Marlies, and W.G.C. Hubner (also in the chemistry department), and outsider Nathaniel Hecht. \\"Progressive teachers active in ferretting out this state of affairs in the chemistry department were subsequently suspended by the Board of Higher Education on the charge of 'Communism'.\\" The Board of Higher Education announced it would take immediate action against three college professors who owned shares in the Kemkit Scientific Chemical Corporation of Brooklyn, whose products they were making students buy. At a Teachers Union meeting later that day, Cohen praised colleague Morris U. Schappes for helping the fight against Hitler and native- born fascists like Coudert: \\"When that is done, Morris Schappes will be back in the halls of learning using science and knowledge to build a better world.\\" The next day, August 14, the committee heard testimony from Charles A. Marlies, who testified that Cohen had worked for Kemkit in 1927: \\"I guess maybe Morris U. Cohen told them,\\" meaning the Coudert committee about Kemkit. On August 18, 1941, the New York District of the American Student Union congratulated the TU's Committee for the Defense of Higher Education and Morris U. Cohen for exposing graft and corruption in the chemistry department of CCNY. On April 23, 1941, Bella Dodd, then chair of the Committee for the Defense of Higher Education of the New York City Teachers Union, announced that the Board of Higher Education had suspended eleven (11) more CCNY teachers and administrators in addition to the first three teachers (Morris U. Schappes, John K. Ackley, and Arthur R. Braumlich): Jetta Alpert, Lewis Balamuth, Saul Bernstein, David Cohen, Morris U. Cohen, Sidney Eisenberger, Jack D. Foner, Louis Lerman, Samuel Margolis, Jesse Mintus, and Walter Scott Neff. On August 25, 1941, witness William M. Canning reversed his testimony in favor Professor Schappes, which threw into doubt Canning's previous testimony on Kenneth Ackley, Walter Scott Neff, Arthur Braunlich, Seymour Copstein, Philip S. Foner, and Morris U. Cohen. Resignation ILD lawyer Samuel A. Neuberger represented Morris U. Cohen in 1941 and 1953 On September 18, 1941, CCNY student newspaper The Campus followed up with lives of the three teachers on suspension: * Sidney Eisenberger (Chemistry) could not afford to support his family and consequently was forced to send his wife and four-year- old twins to live with relatives in Ohio... * Morris U. Cohen (Chemistry), responsible for the recent reduction in chem lab fees and... important x-ray work was another who was obliged to give up his home. His family, including his five-year-old son, was able to stay together‚Äìbut only in the home of relatives. * Morris U. Schappes... not only lost his job, but after admitting former membership in the Communist Party, he was arrested and put in jail. On October 6, 1941, Cohen's lawyer, Samuel A. Neuberger, abruptly walked out on his client and left the courtroom when the court would not let him subpoena full records related to Cohen's charges of graft and corruption at CCNY. On January 19, 1942, Cohen, Louis Balamuth, and Arnold Shikatoff resigned from their teaching positions at CCNY, while the Board of Higher Education dismissed three clerks: Jesse Mintus, Morris Foner, and Jetta Alpert. Cohen worked at the Technical Research Laboratories after CCNY, which had contracts with the US Army. He was also a stockholder in Balco Corp. with Lewis Balamuth and Joseph Steigman. He also worked for the Gussack Machine Products Company of Long Island City \\"under contract for Armed Forces.\\" 1953 SISS US Senator William E. Jenner chaired the SISS when it subpoenaed Morris U. Cohen. On May 19, 1953, Morris U. Cohen appeared before the US Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS). Accompanying was attorney Samuel A. Neuberger (who had represented Cohen during the Rapp-Coudert Committee hearings in the early 1940s). Lewis Balamuth and Martin Canning testified earlier the same day that Cohen had been a member of the Communist Party. The committee acknowledged Cohen's request to keep his address frm the public: \\"that request was denied.\\" On May 20, 1953, Morris U. Cohen's photo appeared on the front page of the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper under the headline \\"Red Prober Flays Ex- CCNY Teacher.\\" Under his photo, the caption read \\"Mum About Espionage.\\" The article calls him a chemist residing at 2028 Mermaid Avenue, Brooklyn, and repeats Senator Eastland's branding as \\"one of the worst men as a security risk\\" ever to appear before SISS. SISS tried to imply guilt by his plea of the Fifth, to which Cohen retorted that the Fifth \\"was set up to protect innocents, and in all fairness I think you ought to draw that inference.\\" In a June 22, 1953 article for LIFE magazine, Whittaker Chambers wrote of Cohen's testimony: > The last of them but one to reach the stand is Mr. Morris U. Cohen... They > say: \\"Let me ask you this question: Are you now a spy for the Soviet Union?\\" > Mr.Cohen: \\"I must certainly decline to answer that.\\" > That \\"certainly\\" is too much for one of the senators. He says: \\"You must > certainly decline to answer that question, and the reason is that, if you > were, you would be guilty of treason. That is the reason for your putting > the emphasis there, that you must 'certainly' decline to answer that > question?\\" Unlike the senator, the rest of us are expressly denied the > right, by the whole tradition of American law and justice, to draw any > conclusions as to the guilt or innocence of Mr. Morris U. Cohen or any other > witness who seeks refuge behind the Fifth Amendment. But one conclusion we > are permitted to draw: In the face of such testimony, any government which > did not pursue such investigations by every means in its power, including > congressional committees, would have abdicated one of the duties for which > government exists. On November 30, 1953, the Associated Press published a story critical of the government by noting that only Alger Hiss and Judith Coplon trials had led to results (of which only the Hiss trial resulted in a conviction that stuck). In the same piece, Cohen's name appeared among a dozen OSS and U.S. military employees. These dozen in \\"important\\" posts fit a \\"pattern of such infiltration by those who have invoked their privilege against incrimination when asked about the subcommittee's evidence of their Communist Party membership.\\" The remaining names were: Leo M. Drozdoff, Irving Fajans, Jack Sargeant Harris, Paul V. Martineau, Leonard E. Mims, Milton Wolff, Geoge S. Wuchinich, Herman Landau, Sidney J. Socolar, Ralph Spitzer, and Joseph Steigman. Personal life and death Cohen married and had one son. Cohen made a \\"non-alumni\\" contribution in 1959-1960 to Haverford College, where his son studied Cohen appears to have died in 1989, when the Anshe Emeth Memorial Temple of New Brunswick, New Jersey, published a memorial mention of his name. Legacy When Cohen exposed graft and corruption at CCNY, the Daily Worker published not just editorials of support but the following paean on August 16, 1941: > When Cohen raked them fore and aft > With charges of corruption > The profs who made the dough from graft > Had quite a big eruption. > \\"Take not away our ten percent,\\" > They piteously said. > And Coudert knew just what they meant: > He canned him as a \\"red.\\" Works * Method of reducing reflection of a transparent body, applied 1942, granted 1947 See also * Rapp-Coudert Committee * Morris Schappes * Jack D.

According to Sotheby's, it is \\"the first artwork in history to have been created live during an auction.\\" The painting has been on permanent loan to the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart since March 2019. Original work The painting is an adaptation of Banksy's 2002 mural Girl with Balloon, rare as a unique work rather than a print. It was given by him to a friend shortly after the \\"Barely Legal\\" exhibition in 2006. Banksy has said he prepared the self-destruct mechanism at this time in case the work was ever put up for auction. Auction and self-destruction Sotheby's London sold the painting at auction on 5 October 2018, at an artist-record price of ¬£1,042,000 (then equivalent to US$1,366,672 or ‚Ç¨1,184,360). Within seconds of the gavel drop, the canvas began sliding out of the bottom of the frame and shredding itself to the audible sound of a siren and the surprise exclamations of attendees. The shredder stopped when the canvas was about half-way through; Banksy has said this stop was unplanned and that he intended to shred the entire thing. The work was housed in a deep frame and was plugged in to facilitate built-in electrical lights, which powered the hidden paper shredder as well. Sotheby's said they had no foreknowledge of the mechanism. After the shredding, there was a negotiation with the buyer to confirm the sale, and on 11 October it was agreed that the sale would go through at the original price. The work was renamed by Banksy's representatives from Girl with Balloon to Love is in the Bin. Market watchers speculated that the self-destruction would increase the artwork's value. Sotheby's released a statement that called it \\"the first artwork in history to have been created live during an auction\\". It was reported that the artist uploaded a video of the event onto Instagram, showing the construction of the shredding mechanism and frame, but deleted the post. Banksy has released another video indicating that the painting was intended to be shredded completely, showing the painting being shredded with the words: \\"In rehearsals it worked every time\\".  Speculations  It has been speculated that a man seen filming the shredding was Banksy or someone connected to him. Shortly after the auction, Josh Gilbert, an artist and blacksmith, noted what he thought were a number of inconsistencies with the work shredding itself.

It is based on earlier protocols (also known as MDB in the US) dating back to at least the early 1990s. Mechanism The multidrop bus used by vending machine controllers to communicate with the vending machine's components, such as a currency detector, is also called MDB (for Multi-Drop Bus). In use since the 1980s, it is now an open standard of the National Automatic Merchandising Association, or NAMA. The devices communicate in a single-master, multiple- slave configuration using the MDB protocol, which is based on a Motorola 9-bit UART implemented as an 8-bit data value with an additional mode bit. The mode bit differentiates between ADDRESS and DATA bytes. The master sends messages containing one address byte and a variable number of data bytes. The bus \\"slave devices\\" listen for an address, and if it matches their address that slave device will process the message and respond to the master. Though 9-bit compliant UARTs are not popular in PCs, they can be found in many microcontrollers. The physical connection is realized as a serial bus with a fixed data rate of . There are just 2 communications signals plus the essential common-ground reference signal. The TX signal goes from the MASTER to every SLAVE device. The RX signal goes from every SLAVE device to the MASTER device. Both signals have pull-ups. The bus is driven at every transmitter by an open collector transistor driver, and isolated at each receiver with an opto-isolator - though cable harnesses carrying the communication signals may also carry 24-volt power and ground signals to devices, meaning the devices may not be isolated from each other as they share the same power bus. Some devices, however, may have alternate power supplies, especially devices with motors and high current needs such as vintage bill acceptors or currency detector devices. History MDB originated as a proprietary bus used by CoinCo for their coin-acceptors in the late 1980s and was deployed in high volume in vending machines for Coca-Cola. Coke forced CoinCo to open-source it in 1992 to increase competition, and NAMA released the first version of the standard in 1995, allowing other vendors to compete for the coin-acceptor portion of the vending machines (CoinCo and Mars were the 2 major suppliers in North America at the time) and also enabled alternative payment schemes (e.g. Smartcard based) to be connected to existing vending machines. Bus addressing is based on the device type only, which allows for a very simple protocol stack, as no initial enumeration needs to be performed.

The appearance of many of the old French r√©gime's principal buildings are known only from Short's sketches. He is also known for his sketches of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and notable naval engagements of the times.

Born in Southborough, in Kent, Hunter became interested in socialism in his youth, and joined the Social Democratic Federation in 1901. He later switched to the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and was also an organiser of The Clarion's van movement. In 1913, he worked as a full-time election agent for the Labour Party in Bishop Auckland, and from 1914 to 1916, he was the political agent for the Northumberland Miners' Association. In 1918, Hunter became the secretary of the No-Conscription Fellowship, but with the end of World War I, this was wound up. From 1921, he served on the National Administrative Council of the ILP, and chaired its London and Southern Counties division. He wrote a number of publications for the party, such as the ABC of Socialism and Socialism at Work, and became the secretary of the ILP's Information Committee. He was close to Ramsay MacDonald, even after MacDonald left the party, and also to John Beckett, with whom he shared membership of the 1917 Club. However, Fenner Brockway disliked Hunter, describing him as \\"a master of manipulation\\". The ILP was affiliated to the Labour Party, for which Hunter stood unsuccessfully in Hackney Central at the 1923 and 1924 United Kingdom general elections. He was the editor of the ILP's newspaper, the New Leader, for a short period in 1929 and 1930. The following year, he opposed the split of the ILP from the Labour Party, deciding to leave the ILP. He found work with the Daily Herald, soon becoming its political editor. He also devoted time to the National Union of Journalists, and served as its president in 1940/41.

She worked with the resistance in Greece to hinder the Axis occupation of the country for three years before being captured, tortured, and executed aged seventeen in September 1944.  Biography  Konstantopoulou was born into a wealthy Greek family in 1927. She was 13 when the Axis Powers invaded and occupied Greece during the Second World War. Iro joined the United Panhellenic Organization of Youth, a Greek resistance movement, in which she worked to steal messages and monitor troop movements. She was caught performing these activities, but was able to avoid punishment due to her father bribing local authorities. In early 1944 Iro was involved in a successful resistance operation to blow up a train carrying ammunition; soon after, a double agent working within the Greek resistance revealed her identity to the German occupational forces. Iro was arrested on her way home from high school on 31 July 1944; according to one source, she had finished her final high school exams that morning. She was subjected to several days of torture, but refused to divulge the names of her fellow resistance members. As a German speaker, Iro was noted as having been able to insult her captors in their own language. Following her interrogation, she was transported to the Haidari concentration camp just outside of Athens where she was held with many other members of the resistance including resistance leader Lela Karagianni. Iro and 49 other members of the resistance were executed at the camp by firing squad on 5 September 1944, just 37 days before Athens was liberated by Allied forces. It is said that on the morning of her execution, as she was being taken by camp guards, Lela Karagianni (who would be executed 3 days later) told her proudly, \\"Well done, my Iro. This is how a Greek woman dies.\\" ('). Many sources also report that Iro's body was shot 17 times, one bullet for each year of her life, as a warning to other members of the resistance.  Legacy  Konstantopoulou's actions during the war were commemorated by a statue of a young girl in Terpsithea Square in Piraeus. In 1981, Iro's life was depicted in the Greek film 17 Bullets for an Angel: The True Story of Hero Konstantopoulou.

Formerly the site of a Chevrolet factory widely known as \\"Chevy in the Hole\\", it has been redeveloped and revitalized since 2015 as event space and recreational areas with restored grasslands, meadows, wetlands, and woodlands. It also features green spaces, low- maintenance native plants, and walking trails. It is being constructed in five phases, the first three of which were completed and open to the public by July 2018. The fourth phase is expected to be complete by October 2018, while the fifth and final phase should be finished by July 2019. In total, the creation of Chevy Commons is expected to cost approximately $17.3 million, and it is part of a broader, $36.8-million project to change the landscape of the Flint River in Downtown Flint.  History  Between downtown and Kettering University along the Flint River in Flint, Michigan, what is now Chevy Commons was the site of a sawmill and a paper mill before becoming the home of Flint Wagon Works in the 1880s. It is better known as the site of a former Chevrolet factory called Chevrolet Flint Manufacturing but widely known as \\"Chevy in the Hole\\". Automotive manufacturing at the factory began in 1904, and it employed 14,000 workers at its zenith. It was also the location of the Flint sit-down strike. The last buildings on the site were demolished in 2004 by automotive parts supplier Delphi, leaving it as a brownfield. For numerous years before the idea of Chevy Commons took form in 2014, blight elimination at Chevy in the Hole was considered.  Redevelopment  Senator Debbie Stabenow speaking at the Chevy Commons groundbreaking on April 17, 2015 In 2014, Mayor Dayne Walling announced two separate grants (of $1.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively) from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop city- owned Chevy in the Hole into a park. Genesee County Historical Society president Dave White noted this represents the first time in almost 200 years that the site is not being used for manufacturing or commercial purposes. According to Walling, Chevy Commons was conceived to provide event space and recreational areas as well as recognize the site's automotive and Native American history. He conceived it as \\"an interesting, natural space right in the heart of the city\\". Christina Kelly, of the Genesee County Land Bank, noted that the project was dependent on federal funds, and that redevelopment of the site planned to focus on capping the ground and building up soil on top of it instead of concentrating primarily on decontamination. Prior to the first EPA grant, however, thousands of trees had been planted on the site to help decontaminate it naturally. The city and Land Bank conceive of Chevy Commons as a \\"destination park\\". On April 10, 2014, approximately 70 people expressed strong support for the project at a public meeting. While the plans for Chevy Commons are outlined in the city's master plan, they also interface with Kettering's master plan, as well as its redevelopment of Atwood Stadium. Chevy Commons in 2018 In March 2015, the site began a redevelopment and revitalization process that ultimately transformed it into a park, starting with the removal of wire fencing and work on sewer lines. On April 17, the city officially celebrated the start of work on Chevy Commons with a groundbreaking ceremony. The former brownfield was redeveloped into restored grasslands, meadows, and woodlands while walking trails were created on the site. Its design features green spaces, low-maintenance native plants, and wetlands that are intended to control the cost of stormwater management. The site is being redeveloped in phases, starting with the first phase: planting shrubs, building walking paths, and creating car parking on the southwestern end of the site. The second phase concentrated on connecting the site to county and regional trails, enhancing views of the Flint River, and improving access for fishing. By 2015, millions of dollars had been spent on cleaning up industrial waste on the site, and the next phase of the project commenced: covering the concrete slabs of the site with to of topsoil, a total of . Folliowing this, grass and trees were planted, and walking trails created. By June 2015, the first phase of construction of Chevy Commons was well underway. By \\"fortunate coincidence\\", it also became the trailhead for the Genesee Valley Trail that was constructed to connect it with Flint Township. Also that month, Chevy Commons entered phase two of its construction, as work on building the green cap continued. On September 24, 2016, Chevy Commons hosted its first event as a finished park: a children's biking event called Cycling Circles. In May 2017, a pedestrian bridge linking Chevy Commons with Carriage Town and connecting two already-existing segments of the statewide Iron Belle Trail was planned. By that point, both the first and second phases of the project had been completed, with additional third and fourth phases planned as part of the broader Riverfront Restoration Project, which endeavors to naturalize the Flint River and make it more accessible, safer, and easier to use for recreation. The third phase concerns of land along Kearsley Street (between Swartz Creek and Stevenson Street) and was expected to be completed by the end of 2017; the fourth phase deals with greening the area along the river on both sides of Stevenson Street in 2018. In total, the creation of Chevy Commons is expected to cost approximately $17.3 million. By July 2018, the third phase was complete, and the first three phases were open to the public. At that time, the fourth phase was expected to be complete by October 2018, at which point leftover funds and a $315,000 grant from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality will be used to start work on the fifth and final phase. The fifth phase will feature additional walking trails, a parking lot, and possibly also a sledding hill. It is expected to be complete by July 2019.  Related developments  Chevy Commons is one major part of a broader, $36.8-million project to change the landscape of the Flint River in Downtown Flint that also includes removing the Hamilton Dam, greening Riverbank Park, and naturalizing the river by softening it with native plants and rocks. Led by Genesee County Parks and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the project began in summer 2017 and is tentatively expected to be complete by 2019. An additional brownfield that was previously part of Chevy in the Hole is being redeveloped into automotive proving grounds, including for autonomous vehicles, by Kettering University and General Motors.

Natural environment parks protect outstanding landscapes, ecosystems and other elements of the province's wilderness to provide high quality recreational and educational experiences for visitors. History The park was created in 2014 from two properties: the Cameron Ranch and the Windmill Ranch. They are irregularly shaped but adjoining properties that are southeast of the town of Dalrymple and west of Wylie Rd. Both properties were acquired with assistance of The Couchiching Conservancy and the Nature Conservancy of Canada, with the Couchiching Conservancy acting as steward of the properties since their acquisition. Windmill Ranch was a family farm last operated by John Arthur Hawtin and Noreen Hawtin. Visitor activities As a natural environment park, Carden Alvar Provincial Park contains no campgrounds, restrooms or recreational facilities. Two common uses for the park area are birdwatching and hiking. Access to the eastern portion of the park (the Windmill Ranch property) is limited to guided tours arranged through the Couchiching Conservancy. However, given the approximately frontage along Wylie Rd, many birders observe from the road. Wylie Rd. is also an important observation area for the region's butterflies.

Kento Yamazaki, who starred in a 3-minute short of the same name released in 2016, reprises his role as the film's protagonist with a supporting cast that includes Ryo Yoshizawa, Kanna Hashimoto, Masami Nagasawa, Kanata Hong≈ç and Takao Osawa. The film portrays the life of Li Xin, a general of Qin, from his childhood as an orphan through his military career during the Warring States period of ancient China. The film was released nationwide on April 19, 2019. It was screened in North America by Funimation in Q3 2019.  Plot  Orphaned by war, Xin is sold as a slave to a small village, where he befriends Piao, another slave. Growing up, Xin and Piao train together, dreaming of escaping their low statuses and eventually becoming great generals. One day, Chang Wen Jun visits their village in search of soldiers to aid the king Ying Zheng, but he will only accept Piao. A few days later, a mortally wounded Piao appears at Xin's house, warning him that Ying Zheng's brother, Cheng Jiao, has started a power struggle and urging him to go to a meet-up point marked on a map he gives him. Xin is forced to flee as his village is set on fire and the villagers are murdered by Cheng Jiao's army. At the meet-up point, Xin finds Ying Zheng, but they are ambushed by an assassin. Xin realizes that Piao was accepted into the army to serve as Ying Zheng's body double due bearing a resemblance to him. After the assassin is killed, the two escape through a mountain path with help from Heliao Diao, a Mountain Tribe child who had accompanied the bandits who had previously ambushed Xin. As the three reach the bamboo forest, they are attacked by another assassin. Despite blaming Ying Zheng for Piao's death, Xin defeats the assassin, but he is poisoned by one of his darts. The three take refuge at an ancient summer resort to help Xin recuperate, while Xin learns Piao had voluntarily sacrificed himself to serve Ying Zheng and about Ying Zheng's bitter rivalry with Cheng Jiao. Ying Zheng's remaining army finally arrive at the summer resort, including Chang Wen Jun, who was previously assumed to have been killed by Wang Qi. The army is outnumbered by Cheng Jiao's army of 80,000 soldiers, while Ying Zheng admits that L√º Buwei, the only person who can outmatch him, is also after the throne. Ying Zheng's army resorts to seeking help from the Mountain Tribe, a former ally of the Qin royal family that had been betrayed centuries ago. On the way, they are captured by the Mountain Tribe and brought forth to the chieftain, Yang Duan He. Yang Duan He orders Xin to be beheaded to test Ying Zheng's loyalty, but Xin's dedication to Ying Zheng's goal and mannerisms impress her, after which she announces that the Mountain Tribe will be affiliated with the Qin royalty again. Ying Zheng's army arrives at the royal palace disguised as part of the Mountain Tribe, under the pretense of helping Cheng Jiao fight against L√º Buwei. Jie Shi, Cheng Jiao's advisor, allows only 50 people inside, and 10 of them to meet with Cheng Jiao. Inside, Ying Zheng initiates an attack, while Xin, Diao, and Bi use the underground passageway to reach the throne room and assassinate Cheng Jiao. Xin's group is intercepted by Zuo Ci, Ying Zheng's former general, who sends Lang Kai the Executioner after them. Xin kills Lang Kai with the help of the Mountain Tribe, and when they reach Cheng Jiao's room, Zuo Ci defeats Xin's group. Xin's memory of Piao and belief in his own dreams pushes him to continue and he kills Zuo Ci. Cheng Jiao's council flees, but Diao gouges out Jie Shi's eye with a dart and is stabbed by him before he dies. While Diao is safe thanks to wearing armor, Cheng Jiao uses their distraction to escape. In the courtyard, Cheng Jiao confronts Ying Zheng, but is quickly defeated. Ying Zheng spares him, but he beats him down to punish him for the suffering he caused. In the midst of this, Wang Qi and his army appear in the courtyard, where he inquires Ying Zheng what he will do as king, under the condition that he will behead him if he does not provide a satisfactory answer. Ying Zheng vows that he plans to unite China under the Warring States period, even using force as means to ensure that there would be peace in the future.

They are also the most-subscribed children's channel in the world and the third most-subscribed channel in the world, behind T-Series and PewDiePie. Content Cocomelon's videos include children, adults, and animals who interact with each other in daily life. The lyrics appear at the bottom of the screen in the same way on all displays. In 2020, Treasure Studio added Cocomelon content to Netflix, Roku, and Hulu.https://www.hulu.com/series/cocomelon-2e66939e-3ef1-4975-8df3-d0f3e338062c The company also delivers music through popular streaming services.  History  On September 1, 2006, Cocomelon was created on YouTube to provide viewers with free education. Then known as ThatsMEonTV, the channel uploaded the first two videos, two versions of the alphabet song, to YouTube on their first day. The channel uploaded their third video 9 months later, titled \\"Learning ABC Alphabet ‚Äì Letter \\"K\\" -- Kangaroo Game\\". Most videos on the channel taught a single alphabet with a typical length of between one and two minutes. In 2013, the ABCkidTV era introduced a new intro and logo. The logo showed a TV with a ladybug on the upper left corner. The channel began remastering older videos followed by a transition from alphabet videos to nursery rhymes and longer video lengths. Within a few years the channel introduced 3D animation, with their first 3D character being used in Twinkle Twinkle Little Star on April 8, 2016. The video featured a 3D flying star guiding 2D characters through the sky. Towards the end of 2016, 3D animation video uploads became more frequent and longer, with some videos using motion capture technology. Animation and music production continued to modernize, and a recurring cast of characters began to form, with J. J., TomTom, YoYo and many others. In 2018, the company rebranded again to Cocomelon. In April 2019, The Wall Street Journal estimated Cocomelon's yearly ad revenue at $120 million. In February 2020, the company's chief executive announced plans to introduce toys based on these characters, and has mentioned the possibility of a feature-length movie. The toys are expected to include plush dolls and toy vehicles, with an anticipated rollout date in the fall of 2020. Shipment of some toys was later announced for August.  Rise in popularity  After nine years on YouTube, Cocomelon reached 1 million subscribers on May 16, 2016. Half a month later, the channel reached one billion views. The following two years continued to see growth with nearly 400,000 subscribers per month to ten million subscribers and gaining seven billion views. On August 18, 2018, the company was re-branded again. Cocomelon had the second largest YouTube channel subscriptions gain in 2019 with an increase of over 36 million, ending the year on 67.4 million in channel subscriptions. In 2018, YouTube's algorithm recommended Cocomelon's video \\"Bath Song + More Nursery Rhymes & Kids Songs\\" 650 times \\"among the 696,468 suggestions that Pew Research Center tracked\\" making it most recommended video on YouTube. As of August 2020, that video has received over 2.8 billion views on YouTube, making it the 19th-most viewed video on the site. In addition, their second most popular video, \\"Yes Yes Vegetables Song\\", has received over 2.3 billion views, making it the 36th-most viewed video on the site. In May and June 2019, Cocomelon received 2.5 billion video views, averaging 83 million daily viewers. Comparatively, the \\"major four TV broadcast networks averaged just 13 million viewers daily during the TV season\\". In July 2019, YouTube changed its algorithm after the Federal Trade Commission raised concerns over child safety. Multiple children's channels were affected, including Cocomelon, which \\"dropped from 575 million views the week before the change, to 436 million the week of, to 307 million the week after, and 282 million the week after that\\". Cocomelon's videos also achieved popularity outside YouTube; in September 2020 Netflix ranked Cocomelon as its third most popular show.https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2020/09/19/cocomelon-most- popular-childrens-show-netflix/  Identity  Cocomelon's website describes the company as having 20 employees. When The Wall Street Journal attempted to find out who creates Cocomelon videos, they were unable to contact Treasure Studio, which owns the channel. Wired magazine located a couple in Irvine who seemed to have some ties with Treasure Studio but was unable to confirm that they owned the channel. In February 2020, Bloomberg Businessweek identified a couple from Orange County, California as the owners of Treasure Studio and Cocomelon.

Before opening his own restaurants, Trabocchi ran kitchens in London, Virginia, and New York, winning a James Beard Foundation Award in 2006. Early years (1974-1997) Trabocchi was born in 1974 in Osimo, in the Marche region of Italy. He studied at the Istituto Alberghiero Panzine in Senigallia, working as a pastry chef in the summers. He then earned an apprenticeship with Gualtiero Marchesi at his eponymous restaurant in Milan. Trabocchi then worked in Moscow and in the United States at BiCE Ristorante in New York and in Washington, D.C. He moved to Spain to open a BiCE restaurant in Marbella and then to London. Floriana, Maestro, and Fiamma (1998-2010) Trabocchi won a Carlton London Restaurant Award as Best Young Chef of 1999 while working at Floriana in Knightsbridge, London. He was recruited back to the United States in 2001 by the Ritz-Carlton in Tysons Corner, Virginia, to open a new restaurant called Maestro. Maestro's menu featured two takes on Italian cuisine: La Tradizione, Trabocchi's version of traditional regional Italian dishes updated with high-quality products; and L'Evoluzione, Trabocchi's very modern interpretation of Italian cooking. In 2002, Trabocchi was recognized as one of America's best new chefs by Food & Wine magazine. In 2005, Trabocchi was named chef of the year by the Restaurant Association Metropolitan Washington. He was nominated for several James Beard Awards, finally winning Best Chef, Mid-Atlantic, in 2006. In 2006, he published a cookbook, Cucina of Le Marche. In 2007, Trabocchi moved to New York City to replace Michael White at Fiamma. While he was the chef, Fiamma earned three stars from the New York Timess food critic Frank Bruni, and a Michelin star in the 2009 Michelin Guide. After a sharp downturn in business following the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, Fiamma abruptly closed. Trabocchi was named the executive chef of The Four Seasons Restaurant in 2010, but left after a few months. Trabocchi competed on Iron Chef America in 2009. Fiola and restaurant group (2011-present) Trabocchi returned to Washington, D.C., with the opening of Fiola in 2011, in the same space in Penn Quarter where he had been a chef at BiCE. Fiola opened to mixed reviews, but soon earned its place among the city's best restaurants. It won Best New Restaurant at the 2012 Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington (RAMMY) Awards. Bon App√©tit magazine named it one of the 50 best new restaurants in America. In 2014, Fiola won the RAMMY Award for Best Formal Dining Restaurant. In the inaugural Michelin Guide for Washington, D.C., Fiola received one Michelin star. The Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington again honored Trabocchi as the Chef of the Year in 2013. That year, he opened Casa Luca, a more casual restaurant named for his son. In 2014, Trabocchi opened Fiola Mare, a restaurant focused on Italian seafood, at Washington Harbour on the Georgetown waterfront. It soon became a popular destination for Washington's elite. President Barack Obama and his family dined there in August 2014. In 2015, Fiola Mare won the RAMMY Award for Best New Restaurant. Washingtonian Magazine named Fabio its 2015 Restaurateur of the Year. In 2016, Trabocchi opened Sfoglina, a casual pasta house in the Van Ness neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Another Sfoglina opened in October 2019 in Rosslyn, Virginia. In 2018, Casa Luca was renovated and re-branded as a branch of Sfoglina. In 2017, Trabocchi opened Del Mar, a fine-dining restaurant focused on Spanish coastal cuisine, at The Wharf, a new development on Washington's Southwest Waterfront. The 240-seat restaurant features a bi-level nautical-themed space with an open kitchen, towering ceilings, large windows overlooking the water and hand-painted forest green tiled walls. Early reviews have been positive, with the Washington Post's Tom Sietsema placing Del Mar #1 on his list of top ten restaurants for 2018. Trabocchi opened Fiola Miami in November 2018 to strong reviews. In April 2019, Trabocchi opened Fiola at Dopolavoro Venezia in the JW Marriott Hotel in Venice, Italy.

The \\"Kapsan faction\\" was a group of veterans of the anti-Japanese struggle of the 1930s and 1940s that was initially close to Kim Il-sung. In the wake of the 2nd Conference of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) in 1966, the faction sought to introduce economic reforms, challenge Kim Il-sung's cult of personality, and appoint its ringleader Pak Kum-chol as his successor. Kim Il-sung cracked down on the faction in a series of speeches made at party meetings. He called for a \\"monolithic ideological system\\" that centered on his personality and rallied party members against the Kapsan faction. By April 1967, the factionalists had disappeared from the public. They were expelled from the party and sent to the countryside or prison. Pak Kum-chol either committed suicide or was executed and other key members of the faction lost their lives as well. Kim Il-sung had his brother and heir apparent at that time, Kim Yong-ju, pen the Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System. This new set of policies made Kim Il-sung's rule unchallengeable and expanded his cult of personality to cover other members of the Kim family. His son, Kim Jong-il, took part in the purges and took over the party's Propaganda and Agitation Department (PAD) in what was the first political task delegated to him by his father, paving the way to his increasingly influential role in the politics of the country. Background The Kapsan Faction Incident takes its name from the region of Kapsan in the old South Hamgyong Province (present day Ryanggang Province), home to an underground liberation organization during the anti- Japanese struggle called the Kapsan Operation Committee. Members of this group provided logistical support for Kim Il-sung's fight against the Japanese. Following the liberation of Korea, they were counted among the ranks of Kim's Guerrilla faction of the Workers' Party of North Korea. The origins of the group are so tied up with Kim Il-sung's activities that sometimes the entire Guerrilla faction is called the \\"Kapsan\\" faction. Gradually, the faction became seen as distinct from the rest of the Guerrilla faction due to political differences. Kim had ousted other factions of the party in a series of purges in the 1950s, most notably the August Faction Incident in 1956, but the Kapsan faction remained. In the aftermath of the 2nd Conference of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) in 1966, the Kapsan faction started setting forth its grievances. The faction put forward economic policies that disagreed with Kim Il-sung's economic model. They were particularly opposed to Kim's Byungjin (dual-track) line of simultaneously developing the economy and the army, favoring the national economy over the needs of the military. In particular, they favored light over heavy industry in order to funnel funds away from the military and improve people's standard of living. They wanted the ruling WPK to relegate its role in economic planning to experts in economics, science, and engineering. They also favored an economic theory of value and advocated the adoption of a semi-currency to give material incentives to workers. The main issue, however, was the question of who could succeed Kim Il-sung as the leader of North Korea. Kim had promoted his younger brother Kim Yong-ju as a likely successor, but the man lacked credentials. In particular, he had not taken part in the fight against the Japanese like the guerrilla and Kapsan faction members had. He was criticized for this by the leader of the Kapsan faction, Pak Kum-chol,; . who had risen in rank to become the vice premier of the state and the fourth-highest-ranking member of the party.; Pak was annoyed by the ballooning cult of personality of Kim Il-sung and how it neglected the experiences of people like him who had sacrificed a lot to the country during the liberation. Pak gathered many influential supporters, including , Kim To-man, , , Ko Hyok, Ha Ang-chon, and . The Kapsan faction sought to name Pak the successor of Kim Il-sung. As an initial move, they helped Kim Il-sung purge Kim Chang-nam, a prominent political theorist, but only to make room for Pak. The faction members started exalting Pak's words as \\"teachings\\" equal to those of Kim Il-sung.; Memoirs of members of the original Kapsan faction had been published since the early 1960s, starting with in 1963 and followed by Yi Je-sun, brother of Yi Hyo-sun, in 1964. An album from 1964 had Pak Tal and Pak Kum-chol's photos printed next to that of Kim Il-sung. When Pak Kum-chol's wife Choe Chae-ryon died, Kim To-man, who was the Director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department (PAD) of the party, produced a work called An Act of Sincerity ‚Äì described variously as either a film or a stage play ‚Äì that portrayed her devotion to her husband. Kim Il-sung disapproved of it and implied that it exhibited misplaced loyalty. Kim To-man also had Pak's birthplace rebuilt. An unauthorized biography on Pak was apparently made while dissemination of propaganda materials on Kim Il-sung was neglected. These actions were perceived of as ultimate acts of disloyalty toward Kim Il-sung. Pak was soon condemned by Choe Yong-gon, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA), of proliferating \\"feudal, Confucian ideas\\". Pak was accused of not supporting the party's military line; he openly ridiculed Kim Il-sung's slogan \\"one against a hundred\\" by concluding that a literal interpretation of it could not be true. Production plans that were his responsibility, it was said, were not met. Pak was accused of promoting the old Kapsan Operation Committee members into important posts. The faction, it was claimed, was familialist and regionalist. Pak's ally Yi Hyo-sun, director of the General Bureau of South Korean Affairs, was blamed for failures of covert operations in South Korea. Furthermore, his subordinate Rim Chun-chu was said to have neglected South Korean operations in order to concentrate on publishing a novel. The factionalists were also said to be \\"revisionists\\" and having forced people to read \\"feudalist\\" literature from the time of the Joseon dynasty. These actions, without the approval of Kim Il-sung, were seen as serious acts of undermining his cult of personality and authority. On top of that, the faction was seen as pro-Chinese contrary to the pro-Moscow line of Kim. Incident Kim Il-sung perceived the Kapsan faction's ideas and actions as existential threats to his rule and the state. In March 1967, Kim warned the Kapsan faction members in a speech entitled \\"On Improving Party Work and Implementing the Decisions of the Party Conference\\" and accused them of practicing \\"individual heroism\\". Kim's solution to the problem was a \\"monolithic ideological system\\" that rallied the party around him. Kim warned other party officials not to side with the factionalists. The faction members ignored his warnings and held their course. Kim acquired permission from his loyal party members in a secret meeting to remove the Kapsan faction. A wide purge of both real and presumed members ensued. At the fifteenth plenum of the fourth Central Committee of the WPK, on 4‚Äì8 April, Kim had more than 100 faction members formally expelled from the party. Pak Kum- chol was sent to work in a factory in the countryside. He was either executed or committed suicide in May 1967.; ; . Others were charged with crimes and disappeared from public or were sent to prison camps. Yi Hyo-sun, Kim To-man, Pak Yong-guk, and Ho Sok-son were sentenced to death. On 25 May, Kim held a speech to party ideological apparatchiks entitled \\"On the Immediate Tasks in the Direction of the Party's Propaganda Work\\". The speech, possibly the most important one he ever gave, became known as the \\"May 25 Teaching\\" and would become a political tool for Kim's supporters to expose factional elements in the party.; . So profound was its impact that Song Hye-rang, Kim Jong-il's sister-in-law, characterized 25 May as \\"the day everything changed\\" in North Korea. Researcher Fyodor Tertitskiy compares it to the importance of 18 December 1865 (abolition of slavery) to American, 24 March 1933 (the Enabling Act) to German, or 20 February 1956 (Nikita Khrushchev's \\"Secret Speech\\") to Soviet history. Despite the importance of the speech, it has never been made public, access being limited to WPK members. A laconic mention of the speech is given in the 1968 ': \\"1967, May 25‚ÄìRespected Comrade Kim Il-sung gave a speech to a group of the Party ideological workers named 'On the Immediate Tasks in the Directions of the Party's Propaganda Work. Thereafter, for decades ‚Äì until the Kim Jong-il era ‚Äì the speech was neither mentioned by name or quoted.; It is sometimes confused with another speech that has the same date and is widely available called \\"On the Problem of Transition from Capitalism to Socialism and of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat\\". As for the unavailable May 25 Teaching speech, its contents can be accurately inferred from the following extract of a 2008 official biography of Kim, according to Tertitskiy: Tertitskiy dates the selection of Kim Jong-il as the successor on the date of the speech. Indeed, Kim Jong-il took part in investigating the faction. The task was delegated to him by Kim Il-sung. Kim Jong-il was only 26 at the time and it was the first official duty given to him by his father. When Kim Jong-il gave a speech at the plenum, it was his first as a figure of authority. He possibly gave another one on 25 May ‚Äì entitled \\"Let Us Firmly Establish the Monolithic Ideological System of the Party among the Officials Dealing with Foreign Affairs\\" ‚Äì that closely echoed his father's 25 May Teaching. Kim Jong-il's name was mentioned in public documents, possibly for the first time, indicating that he was already on his way to being the heir-apparent to Kim Il-sung. Six months after the purge, at an unscheduled meeting of the party, Kim Il-sung called for loyalty in the film industry that had betrayed him with An Act of Sincerity. Kim Jong-il himself announced that he was up to the task and thus begun his influential career in film-making. Kim left the party's Organization and Guidance Department to take over PAD which had been tarnished in the incident. He gave his support for establishing a monolithic ideology centered around his father alone. Kim called a month-long conference of filmmakers to re-orient the country's film industry by cleansing it from the \\"poison\\" of the Kapsan faction. By 1969, the purges were over. Aftermath and legacy A modern Kim Il-sung badge The Kapsan Faction Incident was, in the words of scholar Lim Jae-cheon, \\"a watershed in North Korean politics\\". It marked the last credible challenge to Kim Il-sung's position. Once the faction had been removed, Kim's grip on power hardened and his cult of personality intensified. What followed was an upsurge in propaganda similar to that in China during the Cultural Revolution. Kim Il-sung badges were introduced and it became mandatory to quote Kim in public meetings. All hitherto published books were inspected for correctness and many volumes were burnt. Soon after the incident, Kim Yong-ju, Kim Il-sung's brother, codified his rule in the influential Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System. Kim Il-sung announced the principles to the public in a speech held at the SPA on 16 December 1967 entitled \\"Let Us Embody the Revolutionary Spirit of Independence, Self- Sustenance, and Self-Defense More Thoroughly in all Branches of State Activity\\". After the incident, the Korean word for leader, suryong, which had been used for the leader of any group, or for Lenin or Stalin, became to exclusively mean Kim Il-sung. Kim's 25 May speech had the effect of establishing his own theoretical position distinct from that of China or the Soviet Union, granting him political independence from the two socialist great powers. His political ideology of Juche began to gradually gain momentum.; . His Byungjin economic line took hold, although in reality it meant privileging the army over the economy. Following personnel replacements, North Korea's policy toward South Korea became more hard-line, too. With the downfall of the Kapsan faction, Kim Il-sung became the singular focus of North Korean historiography. His role during the liberation was exaggerated to mythical proportions. Experiences of other guerrilla fighters, on the other hand, were no longer publicly remembered. For instance, Kim Jong-il had the conspirators' war memoirs removed from a popular collection called Reminiscences of the Anti-Japanese Guerillas. Kim Jong-il himself was thrust into the center of political life alongside his father. The cult of personality began to focus on other members of the Kim family as well. The first figure the cult was extended to was his mother, Kang Pan-sok. In July 1967, a song entitled \\"Mother of Korea\\" praising her was published. In July and September Rodong Sinmun published articles praising Kang. September also saw a campaign to emulate Kang in the Korean Democratic Women's Union. By 1968, the North Korean cult of personality was complete. As another family matter, Kim Il-sung was reluctant to allow his daughter Kim Kyong-hui to marry Jang Song-thaek, the son of a family with revolutionary traditions, whose credentials were now no longer seen as an advantage. The two married in 1972, but Jang's past could not be discussed publicly. It was through Jang that the legacy of the Kapsan Faction Incident carried over to the Kim Jong-un era. In 2013, he had Jang purged and executed. Kim, like his grandfather Kim Il-sung, called his military-economic policy Byungjin, and the Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System were updated to refer to Kim Jong-un. Stephan Haggard concludes that while \\"Kim Jong Un's byungjin line is not exactly Kim Il Sung's and Jang Song Thaek is not the Kapsan faction ... the underlying dynamics do look somewhat similar: challenges to the leaderist system are met not only with purges but with important ideological justifications for unity and obedience.\\" See also * 1967 in North Korea * Cultural Revolution * History of the Workers' Party of Korea * Kim Il-sung bibliography * Workers' Party of North Korea#Factionalism References Works cited           Further reading  External links * Original documents at the North Korea International Documentation Project 1967 in North Korea Purges in North Korea Political and cultural purges History of the Workers' Party of Korea Kim Il-sung Attempted coups d'√©tat ","title":"Kapsan Faction Incident"},{"id":"58728903","text":"Fujian Nanping Nanfu Battery, Co., Ltd., also known as Nanfu Battery, is a leading alkaline battery manufacturer and supplier.

Her research interests include economic history, labour economics, and urban economics.  Biography  Leah Platt Boustan earned a BA in Economics from Princeton University in 2000, and her PhD in 2006 from Harvard University. Her dissertation, \\"The Effect of Black Migration on Northern Cities and Labor Markets, 1940-1970,‚Äù won the Economic History Association‚Äôs Alan Nevins Prize for the best dissertation in US economic history that year. She was a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles from 2006 through 2016, when she returned to Princeton as a full professor of Economics. She is also a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), where she co-directs the Development of the American Economy Program. She is an editor of the Journal of Urban Economics and on the editorial board of the American Economic Review.  Research  Professor Boustan has studied the Great Black Migration from the rural south during and after World War II and the mass migration from Europe to the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Her book, Competition in the Promised Land: Black Migrants in Northern Cities and Labor Markets, was published by Princeton University Press in 2016. This book, building on Boustan's published papers, examines the impact of the Great Migration on employment, wages, and urban spaces in northern U.S. cities. The book shows that those who migrated earned on average much more in the North. These migrants competed for jobs with other black workers in the North, slowing wage growth for those workers. Many white households reacted to black migration with \\"white flight\\", moving to the suburbs apparently to avoid sharing public services with poorer black households. This book was awarded the Alice Hansen Jones Prize by the Economic History Association in 2018. Her research was also awarded the 2019 IZA Young Economist Award. Boustan is among the leaders in using advanced analytical techniques to answer major questions of economic history by linking individuals and families across large datasets, such as newly digitized Census records, from the 19th and 20th centuries. For example, in work with Philipp Ager and Katherine Eriksson, she linked data on the sons of slaveholders to show that these men were better off economically in the 1880 Census Records than the sons of nearby families with similar levels of wealth but fewer slaves in the 1860 Census.

She completed her MA on the chemistry of fermentation in 1929 at the University of Toronto. She obtained a PhD in biochemistry from the University of Toronto in 1933, which was rare for women at the time.  Research  Farrell studied yeasts found in honey at the National Research Council of Canada and worked at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine following her PhD. She was recruited to Toronto's Connaught Research Laboratories in 1934. At Connaught, she worked on a team focused on developing toxoid vaccines for staphylococcus. Upon turning her attention to the pertussis vaccine, she developed a method of rocking bacterial cultures to stimulate growth of the bacteria and increase yield. She began studying dysentery toxin in 1941 for use as a vaccine due to the wartime rise in infections. In 1943, Connaught undertook a research program to increase penicillin production for the war effort and Farrell identified a strain of penicillium that allowed increased yield of antibiotic. Following the war, she continued her efforts to improve penicillin production. In 1953, she and her team undertook the challenging task of producing live virus for the polio vaccine in bulk quantities. After months of experimentation, she adapted her rocking method (now termed the Toronto Method) to greatly increase the yield of live virus. The live polio virus was then shipped to the United States to be killed for use in Jonas Salk's field trials, as the Toronto team was the only one that could produce the virus in large enough quantities.

Following conversion it joined the rest of 39th Army (in Kalinin Front) in attempting to destroy the German forces in and around Olenino, with scant success. A further effort was planned for late May or early June, but this was not implemented, in part due to supply issues; 39th Army, in particular, was in a deep salient west of Sychevka and east of Belyi.

As of October 1, the 21st Guards was still in 3rd Shock Army, in Kalinin Front. When the Nevel Offensive Operation began on October 6 the division was in the second echelon. The 54 tanks of the 78th Tank Brigade, plus the 59th Guards Rifle Regiment mounted on all available motorized transport, was prepared as a shock group. The attack began with a reconnaissance in force at 0500 hrs, followed by a ninety-minute artillery preparation, and then by bombing strikes from Soviet aircraft. When the 28th Rifle Division stepped off at 1000 hrs the German 2nd Luftwaffe Field Division, on the north flank of Army Group Center, was utterly routed, and the right flank of the German 263rd Infantry Division of Army Group North was also crushed by 1200 hrs. The shock group, joined by the 163rd Antitank and 827th Howitzer Artillery Regiments, exploited into the gap, and by day's end had liberated Nevel after an advance of 25km, destroying several enemy garrisons en route, and capturing many warehouses, vehicles, and other equipment. This breakthrough also paved the way for similar advances by elements of 4th Shock Army to the south, while other forces of 3rd Shock, such as the 357th Rifle Division, were fed into the gap.David M. Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 26, 38-41 In recognition of this victory the 21st Guards was awarded a battle honor: At the beginning of November the division was still in 3rd Shock, which was now part of 2nd Baltic Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 273 On November 2 it led, alongside the 46th Guards Rifle Division, a new offensive from the northern sector of the Nevel salient in the direction of the town of Pustoshka. The assault force rapidly smashed through the 16th Army's Group von Below before turning the right flank of the I Army Corps' 58th Infantry Division and pivoting to the north. By November 7 the Army's lead elements had penetrated more than 30km deep on a front of 40km, although the German forces lining the corridor to the east refused to withdraw even when deeply outflanked.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 55, 146-47 In early December the 21st Guards was subordinated to the 93rd Rifle Corps. On December 16 this Corps attacked in the Ust-Dolyssa region against the flank of the German corridor north of Nevel. The attack dented the defenses of the German 290th Infantry Division but failed to penetrate, and was soon called off.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 238-40 Before the end of the year the division joined the 100th Rifle Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 10 Advance In January, 1944, the 21st Guards was briefly assigned to the 7th Guards Rifle Corps in 10th Guards Army, before moving back to 100th Corps, which was now in the 22nd Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 38, 67 In late May, 1944, General Mikhailov finally left command of the division to take over command of this Corps. He was replaced by Col. Ivan Ivanovich Artamonov, who was promoted to major general on July 29. The 21st Guards took part in the Baltic Offensive under these commands. General Artamonov left his command on October 24, and was succeeded by four more commanding officers through the duration of the war: * Maj. Gen. Lazar Yefimovich Fishman (October 25 ‚Äì November 17, 1944) * Maj. Gen. Vasily Petrovich Fyodorov (November 18, 1944 ‚Äì January 13, 1945) * Col. Aleksandr Varfolomeevich Shunkov (January 14 ‚Äì April 4, 1945) * Col. Tikhon Savilevich Shumsky (April 5 ‚Äì after May 9, 1945) It remained in 100th Corps until February, 1945, when the Corps was withdrawn into reserve. The 21st Guards was then transferred to the 1st Shock Army, and it spent the rest of the war containing the German forces trapped in the Courland Pocket.Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", p. 51 It then had the official title of 21st Guards Rifle, Nevel Division (Russian: 21-—è –≥–≤–∞—Ä–¥–µ–π—Å–∫–∞—è —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∫–æ–≤–∞—è –ù–µ–≤–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–∞—è –¥–∏–≤–∏–∑–∏—è).

Johnson's early career included engineering and management roles in magnetic recording at IBM (1964‚Äì70) and Memorex (1971‚Äì73). He then joined in the development of SuperDisk, a high-end, rotary actuator HDD funded by StorageTek. In 1980, he left StorageTek to found a startup, Miniscribe, a manufacturer of 5.25 inch HDDs. In 1985, he started another new company, CoData, that subsequently merged with Conner Peripherals in 1986. CoData's 3.5-inch drive became Conner's first product. In 1985, Johnson co-founded PrairieTek, the first maker of 2.5 inch drives.

Johnson earned a Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Utah in 1961 and a Master's degree from the UC Berkeley in 1963. After graduating from UC Berkeley, he joined IBM in San Jose, California. Seven years later, he left IBM to work at Memorex.

Over the next five years, he advanced to Director of Engineering at StorageTek. In 1980, Johnson left StorageTek and in May of that year, he attended the National Computer Conference (NCC) at Anaheim with Roy Applequist. Finis ConnerConner CP340 family of HDDs, Computer History Museum had rented suites at a hotel at NCC to showcase the newly-developed Shugart Technology's ST506Seagate ST506 HDD, Computer History Museum drive. During their discussion, Shugart encouraged Johnson to start his own company building a competitive product.  MiniScribe  The new venture, MiniScribe, did not get off to a good start but the decision by John SquiresOral History of John Squires, Computer History Museum, July 13 & 15, 2009 to join formed a functioning technical team. To complement Squires, Johnson drew on Roy Applequist's expertise for the mechanical configuration of the drive; Applequist had remained in San Jose when Disk Systems relocated to Colorado. The company had difficulties in persuading vendors to supply components until Johnson encouraged some New York-based Venture Capitalists to fund Miniscribe. A sales call at Tandy marked a turning point for MiniScribe. The executive who met with John Squires specified a disk drive that bore little resemblance to the MiniScribe prototype. When Squires returned to Colorado, Johnson gave him free rein to design exactly what Tandy wanted. The Miniscribe 2 or 2012Brochure for MiniScribe 2012 10 TByte HDD was shipped with the IBM PC XT. IBM needed a second source to Seagate and Johnson's struggling private company was the only option. The IBM contract underpinned the IPO (Initial Product Offering) that raised sufficient capital to invest in building manufacturing capacity. Less than a year later, however, IBM cut back its orders and Miniscribe was suspended from trading. When trading resumed, the company's value had halved and Johnson decided to leave.Top Officer Quits at MiniScribe, New York Times, Dec 11, 1984 Miniscribe continued to grow after Johnson left until it dissolved in the biggest scandal of the storage industry.Miniscribe fraud, SEC report, August 11, 1999  CoData (Conner Peripherals)  A few months later in 1985, John Squires also left Miniscribe and the pair decided to form CoData and build a 3.5\\" disk drive.

The rehabilitation process was part of the general efforts made by Romania to distance itself from its Communist past, as those convicted were sentenced after the country fell under Soviet influence in the wake of World War II. However, as a former Axis country during the Second World War, these rehabilitation initiatives put Romania at odds with the West (the United States in particular), as the former was seeking to join NATO and EU. Thus, the number of acquittals was relatively small, and rehabilitation initiatives ceased altogether in 2004, after Romania joined NATO. Chronology Commemorative plaque for Stelian Popescu In 1995, the Romanian Supreme Court rehabilitated 10 out of the 14 writers convicted during the \\"Journalists' Trial\\" of 1945. The fourteen were convicted of war crimes because they disseminated antisemitic and Fascist propaganda, supporting Nazism and Fascism. The Court reasoned that - while their writings did express harmful ideas and would be considered wrong by modern day standards - such propaganda was common before and during the war, expressing ideas that were dominant in the era. Their writings were thus protected as free speech. Among the eleven who were acquitted, the most prominent was Nichifor Crainic (Stelian Popescu was also notable among them), and among the three who were not acquitted, the most prominent was Radu Gyr.Alexandru Florian, Indiana University Press, 2018, Holocaust Public Memory in Postcommunist Romania, pp. 73, 80-81 and 90-94 Nichifor Crainic served as Minister of Propaganda in the Government of Marshal Ion Antonescu.Harold B. Segel University of Pittsburgh Press, 2012, The Walls Behind the Curtain: East European Prison Literature, 1945-1990, p. 267 Two Romanian Army colonels, Radu Dinulescu and Gheorghe Petrescu, were acquitted by the Romanian Supreme Court in 1998 and 1999, respectively. The two were convicted in 1953 of war crimes and crimes against humanity because they participated in the preparations for the Ia»ôi pogrom, they organized the deportations to Transnistria, and they mistreated prisoners of war and civilians. Dinulescu has been referred to as \\"the Eichmann of Romania\\". The two colonels were acquitted through a procedure called \\"extraordinary appeal\\", which was irreversible.Alexandru Florian, Indiana University Press, 2018, Holocaust Public Memory in Postcommunist Romania, pp. 73, 77 and 102Roni Stauber, Routledge, 2010, Collaboration with the Nazis: Public Discourse after the Holocaust, p. 260 Between 1998 and 2000, three convicted wartime Government officials were rehabilitated. Following the Nuremberg Trials model, these were sentenced for \\"crimes against peace\\". On 26 October 1998, the Court rehabilitated Toma Ghi»õulescu. His acquittal was made possible by the briefness of his term as Undersecretary of State in the National Economy Minister (5 April to 26 May 1941) as well as the fact that he resigned before 30 June 1941, the date of the Ia»ôi pogrom. The case of Ghi»õulescu is however not unique, as the Romanian Supreme Court also rehabilitated Gheron Netta on 17 January 2000. Netta served as Finance Minister between 1 April and 23 August 1944, in the Third Antonescu cabinet.Henry F.

Pressures made by two US officials, Senator Alfonse D'Amato and Representative Christopher Smith, precluded the acquittal of the remaining seven. Romania was threatened with the reassessment of Western support for its integration within EU and NATO should the eight be acquitted. It was only Toma Ghi»õulescu, whose brief tenure in the Antonescu Government and the date of his resignation, allowed for his rehabilitation to be carried out.Henry F.

Definition  According to the New Zealand Ministry of Justice: > Mana and tapu are concepts which have both been attributed single-worded > definitions by contemporary writers. As concepts, especially Maori concepts > they can not easily be translated into a single English definition. Both > mana and tapu take on a whole range of related meanings depending on their > association and the context in which they are being used. NgƒÅti Kahungunu legal scholar Carwyn Jones asserts that ‚Äòmana is the central concept that underlies MƒÅori leadership and accountability‚Äô. Mana is further described by Maori Marsden as ‚Äòspiritual power and authority as opposed to the purely psychic and natural force‚Äîihi‚Äô,58 and by Mutu as ‚Äòpower, authority, ownership, status, influence, dignity, respect derived from the gods.‚Äô Hemopereki Simon asserts that, \\"There are many types of mana.\\" If mana in this case is deemed authority and power, then the term ‚Äòmotuhake‚Äô is understood as ‚Äòseparated, special, distinct, independent, unattached.‚Äô It is therefore understood to be: > Autonomous or independent power that is factual and held by either hapu or > iwi, similar to sovereignty but grounded in the whakapapa connection of mana > whenua to their ancestor Papat≈´ƒÅnuku and their legal system of tikanga. It > is an obligation and responsibility of every generation to protect, > safeguard and ensure it continues intact.  Mana motuhake and Treaty of Waitangi   Treaty of Waitangi  The Treaty of Waitangi was first signed on 6 February 1840 by representatives of the British Crown and MƒÅori chiefs (rangatira) from the North Island of New Zealand. It is a document of central importance to the history and political constitution of the state of New Zealand, and has been highly significant in framing the political relations between New Zealand's government and the MƒÅori population. The differences between the two version of the text have made it difficult to interpret the Treaty and continue to undermine its effect. The most critical difference between the texts revolves around the interpretation of three MƒÅori words: kƒÅwanatanga (governorship), which is ceded to the Queen in the first article; rangatiratanga (chieftainship) not mana (leadership) (which was stated in the Declaration of Independence just five years before the Treaty was signed), which is retained by the chiefs in the second; and taonga (property or valued possessions), which the chiefs are guaranteed ownership and control of, also in the second article. Few MƒÅori involved with The Treaty negotiations understood the concepts of sovereignty or \\"governorship\\", as they were used by 19th-century Europeans, and lawyer Moana Jackson has stated that \\"ceding mana or sovereignty in a treaty was legally and culturally incomprehensible in MƒÅori terms\\". Furthermore, kƒÅwanatanga is a loan translation from 'governorship' and was not part of the MƒÅori language. The term had been used by Henry Williams in his translation of the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand which was signed by 35 northern MƒÅori chiefs at Waitangi on 28 October 1835. The Declaration of Independence of New Zealand had stated \\"Ko te Kƒ´ngitanga ko te mana i te w[h]enua\\" to describe \\"all sovereign power and authority in the land\\". There is considerable debate about what would have been a more appropriate term. Some scholars, notably Ruth Ross, argue that mana (prestige, authority) would have more accurately conveyed the transfer of sovereignty. However, it has more recently been argued by others, including Judith Binney, that mana would not have been appropriate. This is because mana is not the same thing as sovereignty, and also because no-one can give up their mana. This academic debate centres around mana in the form of mana motuhake. According to Taiarahia Black, Te Kooti Arikirangi understood mana motuhake as the third mana. This use of the term 'mana motuhake' in its political sense is the first time it is used to its understanding as the equivalent of sovereignty. The most recent work on mana motuhake Hemopereki Simon comes to a similar understanding as Ruth Ross based on a Maori philosophy point of view and the assertions of Ngati Tuwharetoa.  Waitangi Tribunal's Te Paparahi o te Raki inquiry  The Waitangi Tribunal, in Te Paparahi o te Raki inquiry (Wai 1040) is in the process of considering the MƒÅori and Crown understandings of He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga / The Declaration of Independence 1835 and Te Tiriti o Waitangi / the Treaty of Waitangi 1840. This aspect of the inquiry raises issues as to the nature of sovereignty and whether the MƒÅori signatories to the Treaty of Waitangi intended to transfer sovereignty. The first stage of the report was released in November 2014, and found that MƒÅori chiefs in Northland never agreed to give up their sovereignty when they signed the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. Although the Crown intended to negotiate the transfer of sovereignty through the Treaty, the chiefs' understanding of the agreement was they were only ceding the power for the Crown to control PƒÅkehƒÅ and protect MƒÅori. Tribunal manager Julie Tangaere said at the report's release to the Ngapuhi claimants: > Your tupuna [ancestors] did not give away their mana at Waitangi, at > Waimate, at Mangungu. They did not cede their sovereignty. This is the truth > you have been waiting a long time to hear. In terms of mana motuhake He Whakaputanga, creating a MƒÅori state and government in 1835 and/or Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and those who did not sign anything, thus maintaining mana motuhake. In relation to the former, a summary report (entitled ‚ÄòNgƒÅpuhi Speaks‚Äô) of evidence presented to the Waitangi Tribunal conclusively demonstrates that: # NgƒÅpuhi did not cede their sovereignty. # The Crown had recognised He Whakaputanga as a proclamation by the rangatira of their sovereignty over this country. # The treaty entered into by the rangatira and the Crown ‚Äî Te Tiriti o Waitangi ‚Äî followed on from He Whakaputanga, establishing the role of the British Crown with respect to PƒÅkehƒÅ. # The treaty delegated to Queen Victoria‚Äôs governor the authority to exercise control over hitherto lawless PƒÅkehƒÅ people in areas of hap≈´ land allocated to the Queen. # The Crown‚Äôs English language document, referred to as the Treaty of Waitangi, was neither seen nor agreed to by NgƒÅpuhi and instead reflects the hidden wishes of British imperial power. Non-signatory iwi and hapu NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa academic Hemopereki Simon outlined a case in 2017, using NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa as a case study, for how hapu and iwi that did not sign the Treaty still maintain mana motuhake and how the sovereignty of the Crown could be considered questionable. This work was builds on the Te Paparahi o te Raki inquiry (Wai 1040) decision by the Waitangi Tribunal.

Origins The Maliri are thought to have settled in what are now Jie country and large parts of Dodoth country in Uganda. Their arrival in the districts is estimated at 600 to 800 years ago (i.e c.1200 to 1400 AD)Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observation On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 130 Society Occupation The Maliri followed a pastoral way of life. It is unclear whether they practiced any form of cultivation.Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observation On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 130 Language The Maliri spoke a Kalenjin language Decline Lwoo Incursions Oral traditions indicate that the expansion of Lwoo speakers into Acholi caused the breakaway of a group who were initially known as Jie. The Jie came from the vicinity of Gulu though there was a section of the group who came from a hill known as Got Turkan. The Jie who are said to have been Luo speaking though governed by elders and not chiefs (indicating that their culture was not fully Lwoo-ised), advanced eastward and entered the present Karamoja boundary at Adilang. The territory they entered was then occupied by the Maliri who were pushed to the vicinity of Koten mountains. The Jie from Got Turkan, now calling themselves Turkana, broke away from the main Jie populace at Kotido and advanced eastward bringing extreme pressure to bear on the Maliri at Koten causing that group to split into two. One section came to be known as Merille while the other referred to themselves as Pokotozek.Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observation On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 130-131 Fragmentation Merille The Merille who as late as 1970 were still known to the Karimojong as Maliri moved further eastward from their rest point at Koten, settling somewhere east of the Turkana escarpment. Here they again had encounters with the Turkana causing them to move further northward and eastward towards present day Lake Turkana where they settled at Lokitaung. Here again the Turkana harried them and pushed them into their present homeland and what may have been their original cradle-land in the Omo Valley in southern Ethiopia.Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observation On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 131 Pokotozek The Pokotozek moved south, arriving at Nakiloro which lies on the lip of the Turkana escarpment just north of Moroto mountain, where they stayed for a short while before moving further south, proceeding down the eastern side of the Chemorongit and Cherangani mountains before finally branching off in the direction of Lake Baringo. This Pokot incursion disturbed Oropom who were settled around Baringo, causing a break-up of that group which led to migrations in various directions; Turkwell, some Oropom moved towards the Turkwell, both below and above Turkwell gorge. Uasin Gishu; other moved into Uasin Gishu Maasai held territory Oropom; some moved to the Chemorongit mountains which were still part of Oropom territory, as well as the area west of there and south of Moroto mountain The Pokotozek finding that they were no longer facing a formidable tribal grouping to the north and west of Baringo, themselves expanded in that direction, expelling other Oropom from the Cherangani mountains and further west right up to the slopes of Mt Elgon hence limiting Turkana southern movement.Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observation On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 131-132 Sebei At Mt Elgon, a section of the Pokotozek formed into the people today known as the Sebei. On arriving at Mt Elgon, the Sebei- Pokotozek found Tepes people who were originally from Kadam mountain in Karamoja residing at a place later known as Entepes (today Endebess). These Tepes had already come under pressure from Oropom who were fleeing Pokotozek/Turkana incursions in such numbers that some Tepes were forced to return to Kadam. It is notable that the emerging Sebei referred to the Mt Elgon Oropom as Sirikwa. The Sirikwa population at Mt Elgon, as evidenced by Sirkwa holes, was fairly dense and it is likely that their identity was still largely intact. It would take the Karimojong dispersion of the Oropom at Kapcheliba in the early 18th century to finally submerge the Oropom-Sirikwa identity.Wilson, J.G., Preliminary Observation On The Oropom People Of Karamoja, Their Ethnic Status, Culture And Postulated Relation To The Peoples Of The Late Stone Age, The Journal Of The Uganda Society, p. 132 Becoming Pokot The Pokotozek defeated the Loikop at Baringo, following which a settlement was established at En-ginyang (about 48 kilometers north of Lake Baringo).Beech M.W.H, The Suk - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1911, p.xiiHorrobin, D., A Guide to Kenya and Northern Tanzania, Springer Science & Business Media, p. 33 online This event signified the establishment of the pastoral Chok, i.e Pokot, community.Beech M.W.H, The Suk - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1911, p.4 Pokot traditions recall that the victory came when \\"... there arose a wizard among the Suk who prepared a charm in the form of a stick, which he placed in the Loikop cattle kraals, with the result that they all died.\\" Once the Pokotozek breached the Loikop boundary thus gaining access to the Kerio valley, a desire arose many Chok to adopt pastoralist culture. The aim and ambition of every agricultural Chok became to amass enough cattle to move into the Kerio Valley and join their pastoral kin.Beech M.W.H, The Suk - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1911, p.4 They achieved this through attaining cattle as the bride-price of their female relations or through adoption, in the latter case, poor Chok youth would be adopted by members of the emerging Pokot community primarily as herds-boys.Barton, J., Notes on the Suk Tribe of Kenia Colony, The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland Vol. 51 (Jan. - Jun., 1921), pp. 82-99 online By the early 20th century, the Pokot community was expanding as many of the Chok joined their rank and by that time, many Pokot who were termed Suk by the colonial administrators did not recognize this name for their tribe.Beech M.W.H, The Suk - Their Language and Folklore.

Working with Russell and Tim Birks, he designed, fabricated and demonstrated a number of novel forms of optical fibre waveguide with previously unobtainable characteristics. This work has led to a range of outcomes including the commercialisation, of a new form of light source (supercontinuum), high power short pulse laser delivery through fibre, and applications in quantum and atomic physics. Belardi and Knight proposed the hollow-core \\"nested-ring\\" design for photonic fibres, at the beginning of 2014.

His longest spells were at Falkirk and Kilmarnock;[A Record of pre-war Scottish League Players], John Litster / Scottish Football Historian magazine, October 2012 he won the Scottish Cup with both clubs, being one of few players to win that trophy with two different clubs not including Rangers or Celtic. Career Born in Glasgow, McNaught began his career in the Junior grade. He represented Scotland at that level in 1911 while playing for Cambuslang Rangers, where he won the Glasgow Junior League and his teammates included future Liverpool goalkeeper Kenny Campbell. In summer 1910 he signed for Falkirk as a replacement for Jock Simpson who had moved to Blackburn Rovers; at the time, the Brockville Park outfit were one of the top clubs in Scotland having finished runners-up in the Scottish Football League in 1909‚Äì10 and third in 1910‚Äì11. With the Bairns, McNaught lifted the Scottish Cup after a 2‚Äì0 win over Raith Rovers in the 1913 final at Celtic Park. It was the club's first major honour. Falkirk also won several minor regional trophies during the period but never finished higher than fifth until McNaught made his last appearance at the end of the 1915‚Äì16 season, with World War I well underway (the Cup was cancelled during the conflict, however the League continued). In 1919, while still registered with Falkirk, he spent short spells with Vale of Leven and St Mirren (playing no part in the Paisley club's run to the 1919 Victory Cup). With the war at an end, McNaught signed for Kilmarnock, finding success in his first season with the Ayrshire side as they won the 1919‚Äì20 Scottish Cup, defeating Albion Rovers 3‚Äì2 at Hampden Park. Like Falkirk, it was Killie's maiden victory in the competition, at the 42nd attempt. However, their performances in the league were mediocre during his three campaigns at Rugby Park (8th, 11th and 17th). Now in his 30s, in 1922 he moved to second tier Johnstone, spending two years there before one-year spells at the same level with Clyde and East Stirlingshire. Other player There was another Scottish player in the period named John McNaught who had the same position on the field, and had a spell at Queens Park Rangers between 1908 and 1911, playing in the 1908 FA Charity Shield replay; this is not the same man as described above.

It was designed by Ernest de Burgh and built by John Ahearn and Son. It is also known as Norton Bridge. The property is owned by Roads and Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000.  History  Timber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction. Timber truss bridges were preferred by the NSW Public Works Department from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at Newcastle in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England. Ernest DeBurgh, the designer of DeBurgh truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer with the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW. The MacDonald River bridge at St Albans was built between 1901 and 1903 to replace an earlier bridge which had become unsafe. It was built by contractors John Ahearn and Sons of Burwood at a cost of A¬£7290 6s 11d, under the supervision of the Commissioner for Roads, W. J. Hanna. The bridge opened for traffic in February 1903. It was described upon its opening as \\"the largest composite truss span without overhead bracing yet erected in the state\\". It was named \\"Norton Bridge\\" at its opening by state Minister for Works Edward William O'Sullivan in honour of MP John Norton, who had been a forceful advocate for the bridge's construction. However, this name is less commonly used in the present day.  Description  The St Albans bridge is a De Burgh type timber truss road bridge. It has two timber truss spans, each of . There are three approach spans at one end and one at the other. The overall length of the bridge is . The main spans are supported by twin tapered cylindrical iron piers with metal cross bracing. The bridge provides a single lane carriage way with a minimum width of . An Armco guard rail extends the over the majority of the bridge with some of the approach spans having a timber post and rail guard rail.RTA Heritage Inventory, 2000  Heritage listing  Completed in 1902, St Albans Bridge is an early example of a DeBurgh timber truss road bridge. In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Ernest DeBurgh, the designer of this type of truss. DeBurgh trusses were fourth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. Designed by Public Works engineer Ernest M. DeBurgh, the DeBurgh truss is an adaptation of the American Pratt truss design. The DeBurgh truss is the first to use significant amounts of steel and iron, and did so in spite of its high cost and the government's historical preference for timber. The St Albans bridge is a representative example of DeBurgh timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being Nationally significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance. St Albans Bridge over MacDonald River was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Through the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Ernest DeBurgh, it has historical significance. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. It is also visually attractive in its setting, and with ornate iron piers, the bridge has substantial aesthetic significance. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. St Albans bridge is highly valued by the local community. Situated near a popular pub and regular stop off area for tourists from nearby Sydney, the bridge is also valued by the many visitors to the area. Timber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \\"timber truss bridge state\\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The bridge has technical significance because it is a DeBurgh truss, is representative of a range of major technical developments that were made in timber truss design by the Public Works Department. The St Albans bridge has the largest DeBurgh truss spans constructed, giving it further technical significance. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The bridge is rare in the Sydney region, and has rare technical features. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The bridge is highly representative of De Burgh trusses.

The Untold Story (original Italian title: Caligola... la storia mai raccontata; \\"Caligula... the story never told\\") is a 1982 historical exploitation film starring David Brandon and Laura Gemser. Written by George Eastman and Joe D'Amato,Palmerini, Luca M.; Mistretta, Gaetano (1996). \\"Spaghetti Nightmares\\". Fantasma Books. p. 111.. and produced, directed and shot by Joe D'Amato, it was created to cash-in on the success of Tinto Brass's Caligula without being a sequel or remake. The plot deals with the last days of the deviant and murderous Roman emperor Caligula, his sumptuous feasts, orgies, and the various assassination attempts on his life. At its core, the film develops an ill-fated romance between the emperor and an Egyptian slave seeking revenge for her friend's death. Caligula... The Untold Story was released in Italy and in other European countries in both theaters and on home video in several different softcore and hardcore versions. Plot Roman Emperor Gaius Caesar Caligula, alone in his bed, is plagued by nightmares in which a man, his head covered in a helmet, tries to shoot him with an arrow. The poet Domitius approaches and tries to assassinate him with a dagger, but the attempt is thwarted by Ulmar, Caligula's bodyguard. Domitius ends up losing his tongue and having his tendons cut at Caligula's behest. Riding along the beach with Messala, Caligula encounters a group of Christians, among whom he spots Livia. He rapes the woman in the woods in front of her young lover Aetius, a consul's son. While being raped, Livia commits suicide with Caligula's dagger. The emperor orders Messala to kill Aetius on the spot. He spreads word that they were killed by fanatical Christians, and persecutes them. The senators, however, do not believe that the peaceful Christians were responsible and continue to plot against Caligula, discussing their options. In his nightmares, Caligula is visited by the shades of Aetius and Livia. At Livia's funeral, held on a beach, Miriam Celsia, close friend and an Egyptian priestess of the god Anubis, speaks against a Christian burial - the idea being that Livia's God failed to defend her - and in favor of cremation according to Anubis, who speaks of vengeance. The Christians comply. Lucretius presents sumptuous construction plans to Caligula and a group of senators. To finance the project, Caligula announces he will auction off all his belongings at a banquet with beautiful women and costly admission. He then feigns wine poisoning. One of the senators offers to give his life for his well-being, and Caligula stabs him with his sword. Again in his private rooms, the emperor makes fun of crippled Domitius using his sex slaves. In a temple, Miriam sacrifices her virginity to Anubis in exchange for vengeance on Livia's murder. She is then approached by senator Cornelius who wants to aid her. Caligula's cavalry capture novice Vestal Virgins as the chief attraction of the banquet. In a swimming pool, they are deflowered by slaves approaching underwater with phalli. Other women, among them Miriam, apply for the orgy and are selected by a eunuch, who then trains them in the art of love. During the banquet (which involves jugglers, a bloody gladiatorial combat and the masturbation of a horse), Caligula falls in love with Miriam and his bodyguard Ulmar leads her to the imperial chambers where Miriam and Caligula have sex with each other. When Cornelius attempts to kill Caligula, Miriam unexpectedly saves the emperor's life, killing Cornelius. Caligula takes deadly revenge on the senators involved in the plot in a number of gruesome ways. In the meantime, Miriam has become passionately tied to Caligula, who announces he will marry her despite her slave status. She discovers Livia's amulet and becomes torn between vengeance and love. When Ulmar offers to help her escape, she refuses. She can no longer kill Caligula but has to know the truth about Livia's death and therefore administers him a hallucinogenic potion. In his ensuing vision, Caligula is approached and plagued in the beyond by the shades of the people he murdered. One is Miriam. As she approaches, he stabs her with a sword he found on the floor, shouting \\"You're just a dream. But I'm still alive!\\" When he realizes he is no longer dreaming and has actually stabbed her, he cries. Riding again on the beach with Messala, Caligula is approached by senators, praetorian guards and his uncle Claudius. Caligula announces the cancellation of his project for a new Rome and asks that they tell the gods he has woken from his dream. Ulmar, wearing the helmet from Caligula's initial dream, shoots arrows through Messala's neck and Caligula's heart. Dying, Caligula says, \\"I'm still alive!

The Untold Story was shot in autumn 1981 under the working title Follia del potere ().  Release   Censorship  The film was presented to the Italian board of censors on March 6, 1982 under the title Caligola... l'altra storia ( \\"Caligula... the other story\\"), by whom it was rejected the first and second time (March 20 and May 21): It contained too many scenes merging sexual and physical violence with reiterated display of mutilations, the remainder of the runtime being for a large part taken up by orgies so that even cuts could not remove the \\"negative characteristics\\" in the eyes of the censors. On October 19, 1982 the production company \\"Cinema 80\\" asked for a revision for a re-edited version under the title Caligola... la storia mai raccontata, passed on December 1, 1982. This version had cut 22 minutes, from the first version, but was lengthened by additional scenes so that it ended up being only about 15 minutes shorter. Nonetheless, a version of the first and longer Italian cut was released in Italy on home video, still bearing the title Caligola... l'altra storia. In 1993, the film lost its Italian rating \\"vietato ai minori\\" ( \\"forbidden to minors\\") after the removal of about 2 and a half more minutes, from the second, shorter version.  Theatrical releases  In Italy, the film was first shown in theaters on December 15, 1982. It premiered in Rome on December 24, 1982 and was shown at the Ambasciatori, the Blue Moon and the Moderno. In Milan, it premiered on March 26, 1983 at the Impero and in Turin on June 24, 1983 at the Ambrosio. The film had an 85 minute running time for its theatrical run in Italy. In France, the film was released theatrically as Caligula \\"la v√©ritable histoire\\" in June 1983. In Spain, a soft-core version was theatrically released as Caligula 3, la historia jam√°s contada, with 231,236 spectators and a box-office gross of 264,977 euros. Home media Caligula... The Untold Story was released on Italian home video, on VHS, in its soft-core versions by Golfo Azzurro, Videogroup, and Shendene & Moizzi. Elsewhere, the film was released in a hardcore version never submitted to the Italian board. It includes the following additional scenes: * A Vestal (Nadine Roussial) performs fellatio on a Greek slave. * A short scene of apparently un-simulated zoophily in which a woman masturbates a horse. * The orgy at the imperial palace, about 9 minutes of footage, some of it hardcore. The hardcore cut was first distributed on home video by \\"Movie Time\\" in the Netherlands on VHS in an abbreviated form, dubbed in English with Dutch subtitles. The onscreen title reads Caligula... The Untold Story, while the title on the cover is Caligula II - The Forbidden Story. Both a long softcore and the hardcore cuts were released in Germany in a joint edition as Caligula 2 - The Untold Story (Caligula 2 - Die wahre Geschichte) by the label X-rated in its \\"Joe D'Amato Collection\\". A DVD edition with similar content was later released in Italy by Stormovie. The running times vary on home video, with an 80 minute running time for the softcore version and a 102 minute running time for the hardcore version.  Reception   Contemporary reviews  Contemporary reviews were negative. In June 1983, A. Valdata observed in La Stampa that despite its title, the film's story was like that of a common comic book, that the protagonist aped Malcolm McDowell in Caligula and that the film was better suited for a red light cinema., cited at Grattarola & Napoli 2014, pp. 279-280. In September, an anonymous reviewer at the Segno- cinema noted that the small national production profited from the censorship imposed on Brass' Caligula by devising a costumed soft-core screenplay replete with absurdities and approximations, and that the untold story had better been left untold. cited in Grattarola & Napoli 2014, p.280. In France, P. M√©rigeau thought that apart from some habitually horrific scenes (such as tongues cut off, a prostitute coupling with a horse, a newborn child thrown against a wall), there was an absolute void. He called the screenplay nonexistent, the characters for the most part incomprehensible, and wrote that he would rather not talk about the actors' performances. cited in Grattarola & Napoli 2014, p.280, in Italian translation.  Retrospective reviews  Recent reviews have been comparatively favorable. In his 2003 book on splatter films, Scott Aaron Stine observes that Caligula... The Untold Story \\"is not as slick as Gore Vidal's Caligula\\" and says that \\"the lack of gloss actually benefits the film, putting the subject matter in a very suitable light\\" and giving more of an impression of a \\"gritty documentation\\" compared with the \\"pretentious and almost glorifying\\" way in which the earlier film presented its subject matter. Stine also mentions the \\"gratuitous gore\\" - in particular the \\"tongue-sawing sequence\\" and \\"the poor chap who gets impaled with a spear in a manner that makes suppositories look positively quaint\\". In his D'Amato monograph published in 2004, Gordiano Lupi calls the film \\"crazy and perverse\\" as well as \\"visionary in the right place\\". He wrote that he preferred it to Brass' Caligula because it is \\"less chaotic and muddled and, above all, also does not have intellectual pretensions\\". Furthermore, he praises the film's historical reconstruction and its set design, pointing out the yellow tinge of the cinematography evoking the decadent atmosphere of the late [sic] Roman Empire. In his book on D'Amato published in 2014, Antonio Tentori characterises the film as fragmentary due to censorship, but that it is still apparent that it is dedicated to a bizarre and perverse type of eroticism. Both Lupi and Tentori praise David Brandon's performance as Caligula as \\"perfect\\". Generally viewing the acting in a favorable light, Lupi further asserts that Laura Gemser too here delivered one of the most inspired performances of her career. Clive Davies sees her as \\"the real star\\". In 2015, Gary Allen Smith notes that the \\"film lacks a well-known cast but the performances are nevertheless competent. David Cain Haughton, in particular, is quite acceptable as the mad emperor.\\"  References   Bibliography    *  External links  * Films directed by Joe D'Amato Italian films Italian-language films 1980s erotic drama films 1980s exploitation films 1980s pornographic films Italian pornographic films Biographical films about Roman emperors Depictions of Caligula on film Cultural depictions of Claudius Cultural depictions of Messalina Cultural depictions of Agrippina the Younger Drama films based on actual events Epic films based on actual events English-language films Films set in ancient Rome Films set in Rome Films set in the Roman Empire Films set in the 1st century Films shot in Rome Incest in film Italian erotic drama films Italian independent films Italian biographical drama films Italian epic films Italian historical drama films Italian LGBT-related films Obscenity controversies in film Historical epic films Zoophilia in culture Sword and sandal Peplum films Sword and sandal films 1982 drama films ","title":"Caligula...

On 13 October 1908, she became the first woman to speak in the House of Commons when she broke away from her escort into the debating chamber and made an exclamation to the assembly. Life She was born on 18 August 1879 in Paddington. Her father was an architect. She had a short marriage to a man from New Zealand and became known as Margaret Travers Symons. She became the secretary to the aging Labour politician Kier Hardie. Her employer, Hardie, was a friend and lover of Sylvia Pankhurst and of the campaign to grant votes to women. They were founding members of the East London Federation of Suffragettes which was a breakaway group of the WSPU. Travers Symons was a suffragette and had briefly been the treasurer of the WSPU branch in London. Symons knew a member of parliament and she was aware that women were allowed to be escorted as visitors around the parliament buildings. She arranged that she would be taken around the parliament buildings where there was a peep hole where women could see into the main chamber. On 13 October 1908 she escaped from her escort and burst into the House of Commons where a debate was in progress about bill regarding various issues related to children. Reports vary about the exact words she shouted, but they include: * \\"Drop your talk about the children's bill and give us votes for women!\\" * \\"Attend to the women's question!\\" * \\"Address the women's issue!\\" * \\"Leave off discussing the children's question and give votes to the women first!\\" Regardless, she was escorted from the building. This was an evening when the suffragettes were campaigning outside parliament. Emmeline Pankhurst was arrested later for organising the demonstration and she was sentenced to three months in prison. The stunt was reported in major newspapers as she had made history by being the first woman to speak in the House of Commons. She was also unusually one of the few able to divorce her husband in 1911 for his adultery. It was almost a decade later when the first woman was to take her seat after being elected to the British parliament, Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor, who was elected in 1919 following the relaxation that allowed some women in British elections. Travers Symons went to work in Egypt during and after the First World War. She was living in London after the Second World War.
