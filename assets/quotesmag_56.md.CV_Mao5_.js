He began his career as a trainee with Newcastle United, and also played non-league football for clubs including Barrow and Whitley Bay. Life and career Aldred was born in Ferryhill, County Durham, and represented his county schools at under-15 and under-19 level. He began his football career with Newcastle United, but never broke through to the first team, and moved on to Darlington of the Fourth Division in September 1984. He made his debut in the Football League in a goalless draw away to Blackpool on 15 September 1984, and went on to appear in 28 league matches, two-thirds of which were in the starting eleven, as Darlington finished third and were promoted to the Third Division. He also played in the 1984‚Äì85 FA Cup run during which Darlington eliminated near neighbours Middlesbrough in what was voted the greatest match seen at their Feethams ground. Aldred began the 1985‚Äì86 season in the team, but lost his place when Chris Evans arrived in October. He finished the season with 44 league appearances in total, 57 in all competitions. Aldred left Darlington at the end of the season, and began 1986‚Äì87 with Northern Premier League club Barrow. By December he was playing in the Northern League for Whitley Bay. In February 1987, the 20-year-old Aldred was a passenger in a friend's car when it went out of control. He was thrown from the car, and died of his injuries two days later in Newcastle General Hospital.

With 951-rooms, it is the largest hotel in North Florida. At , the hotel is the 23rd tallest building in Downtown Jacksonville. Sitting adjacent to the St. Johns River, visitors have access to amenity such as the Northbank Riverwalk, Jacksonville Landing and Florida Theatre, as well as a rooftop pool. Completed in 2001 under the Adam's Mark banner, Chartres Lodging Group purchased the hotel in 2005 and rebranded it under the Hyatt Regency flag. The hotel changed hands again in 2017 with Ramsfield Hospitality Finance's purchase of the property. History Opening February 1, 2001, the Adam's Mark Jacksonville (now Hyatt Regency Jacksonville) was the centerpiece of an aggressive plan to attract more conventions to Jacksonville, revitalize the riverfront and to secure a bid for Super Bowl XXXIX. The $126 million hotel consisted of 951 guest rooms, 30 meeting rooms and a total of 110,000 square feet of function space. Prior to being incorporated into the hotel complex, what is now the Terrace Building once served as offices for the State of Florida. Designed in 1975 by local architect William Morgan as the Daniel State Office Building, the Brutalist styled building combines Pre-Columbian elements creating a modern step-pyramid design. The six terraces now serve as event space overlooking the river. Chartres Lodging Group purchased the 966-room Adam's Mark in 2005, which it converted to a Hyatt Regency after a multimillion-dollar renovation. In 2017, Ramsfield Hospitality Finance's purchased of the property in a $24,700,000 transaction. In 2017, Hurricane Irma forced hundreds out of the hotel after a mandatory evacuation order was placed on all buildings in Flood Zone B. The first floor of the hotel was severely damaged by flooding, closing it for several months. Finally, on February 14, 2018 the first floor lobby and main entrance were reopened to the public after six months of closure.

He describes discoveries made by his group and others, based on analysis and comparison of ancient and modern DNA from human populations around the world. Central to these is the finding that almost all human populations are mixtures resulting from multiple population migrations and gene flow. Scientists and critics have praised the book for clearly describing pioneering work in a cutting-edge field of study. It has been criticized by some commentators for its handling of race, though other reviewers observe that nothing it says should give racists any comfort. Context David Reich is a geneticist who has studied ancient human genomes, comparing their patterns of mutations to discover which populations migrated and mixed throughout prehistory. He was mentored by the population geneticist Luca Cavalli-Sforza, who from 1960 pioneered the attempt to match the study of human prehistory by archaeology and linguistics, using the limited genetic data available at that time. Book Kurgan model of Indo-European migrations from c. 4000 to 1000 BC. Magenta: origin; red: up to 2500 BC; orange: by 1000 BC Yamnaya culture spread westwards around 3300‚Äì2600 BC, documented by archaeology and genomics, bringing Indo-European languages with it. Yamnaya Corded ware culture, including this pot, corresponds to a stage in the westward migration. =Publication= Who We Are and How We Got Here was published by Oxford University Press in 2018, . It is credited to David Reich alone, but he explains in the acknowledgements that the book grew from a detailed collaboration with his wife, Eugenie Reich. The book is illustrated with monochrome maps, diagrams, and timelines. There are no photographs. =Summary= Since 2010, population geneticists have been able to sequence ancient human DNA, recovering complete genomes, in contrast to earlier approaches which relied on the far more abundant (and hence more easily recovered) mitochondrial DNA, which is present in many copies in each cell, and transmitted only via the maternal line. That early work gave what Reich calls the \\"exciting\\" result that all modern humans are related to \\"Mitochondrial Eve\\", a woman who lived in Africa only about 160,000 years ago. The whole genome recovery technique, using the especially hard bone from the inner ear of ancient skeletons ‚Äî- along with the genomes of modern people from different parts of the world, including especially some isolated populations ‚Äî has made it possible to reconstruct prehistoric migrations and mixing of populations in the past 5,000 years, and to make reliable inferences about mixtures from much further back in time. The new knowledge from genomics has overthrown many old assumptions about human origins. Much of the work has focused on Western Eurasia, where in 1786 Sir William Jones discovered that Sanskrit and ancient Greek were related languages. Linguists came to recognise the Indo-European family of languages, spanning Germanic, Celtic, Italic, Iranian and northern Indian languages, but without explaining how these came to be. Reich showed that modern populations in Europe and north India derive from mixing of native populations with Yamnaya people from the steppes north of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea some 5,000 years ago, in separate migrations to the west and the east. Corded ware culture described by archaeology corresponds to a stage in the westward migration. Reich observes that similar migrations and population mixtures characterise human prehistory on all continents. Reich shows that people in Japan and Korea share some 80% of their DNA, implying migration; Polynesians migrated relatively recently, in just the past few thousand years, from the region of Taiwan. The evidence can upset long-held beliefs: Native American skeletons from 10,000 years ago do not appear to be related to the tribes living in those regions today who have been asking for the ancient bones to be returned to them for burial. The Neanderthals are extinct, but part of their genome survives: Reich notes that all present-day non-Africans have at least 2% of Neanderthal ancestry. Reich explains that somewhere between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, modern humans mated with Neanderthals, and their descendants carried those genes all over the world. An ancient skeleton from Romania had up to 9% Neanderthal DNA, so natural selection has been removing Neanderthal genes since those matings. Reception Reich notes in the book that some castes in India have effectively been reproductively isolated for many centuries by their practice of endogamy. Author and intellectual Jared Diamond, in the New York Times, notes that geneticists can now go far beyond studying the personal ancestries of participants in National Geographic's Genographic Project, which looked at small sections of their parents' DNA, namely their mother's mitochondrial DNA and their father's Y chromosome. By looking at DNA from ancient bones, Reich can recover whole genomes. Diamond warns readers not to expect an oversimplified story: Peter Forbes, in The Guardian, calls the book \\"thrilling in its clarity and its scope.\\" In Forbes's view, Reich handles racist abuses of human origin stories, such as Nazi ideology, \\"commendably\\". Forbes writes that Reich explains how ancient DNA teaches a single general lesson, that the human population of any particular place has repeatedly changed since the last ice age; any supposed \\"mystical, longstanding\\" link between some people and a place, based on some kind of racial purity, is in Reich's words \\"flying in the face of hard science\\". Clive Cookson, in the Financial Times, writes that one of the first and most surprising impacts of genomics is in human prehistory, and Reich is the first leading practitioner to write a popular book about this. Cookson calls the book Cookson notes that Reich dismisses worries that DNA evidence of differences between populations is \\"racism in genetic clothing\\", and that on the contrary, the \\"unsuspected degree of mixing\\" in every part of human history makes old ideas of racial purity \\"absurd\\". Beaker pots, found in Western Europe c. 2900‚Äì1800 BC The archaeologist and geneticist Turi King, in Nature, writes that Reich's laboratory \\"has developed some of the most sophisticated statistical and bioinformatics techniques available. Using computers, they painstakingly reconstruct genomic information from fragments of DNA from ancient individuals. They then drill down in search of a new understanding of human history.\\" King notes that Reich's group helped to show that \\"Neanderthals interbred with the ancestors of all modern humans descended from Europeans, Asians and other non-Africans.\\" Their work is showing the \\"tremendous degree to which populations globally are blended, repeatedly, over generations.\\" King notes, too, that Reich reflects on the dangers of misinterpretation by racists, who \\"pick and choose results\\", or others who opt to \\"sweep [genetic] differences under the carpet\\". But, King argues, echoing Reich, we do need \\"a non-loaded way to talk about genetic diversity and similarities in populations\\", and Reich has begun to do that. The economist Tyler Cowen calls the book \\"truly excellent, readable and informative\\". Cowen insists it is \\"a science book, not a 'race book'\\", stating that although it has engendered \\"some public controversy\\", he is confident that no attentive reader could feel \\"affirmed in racist beliefs\\". The educator Darcy Moore of the University of Wollongong calls the book \\"highly recommended\\" but finds some of Reich's conclusions \\"puzzling and in need of much more research and explanation.\\" A case in point is Reich's statement that the population of Britain was 90% replaced by the incoming Indo-Europeans at the start of the Beaker period. Moore comments that he and the archaeologist Barry Cunliffe (who along with the archaeologist Colin Renfrew praises the book on its back cover) agreed in an email discussion that such a radical change was difficult to understand. An open letter \\"by a group of 67 scientists and researchers\\" including anthropologists, sociologists, historians, and others takes Reich to task for his book, under the heading \\"How Not To Talk About Race And Genetics\\". The group welcomes Reich's challenge to the \\"misrepresentations about race and genetics\\" made by the science writer Nicholas Wade and the molecular biologist James Watson, but warns that his skill with genomics \\"should not be confused with a mastery of the cultural, political, and biological meanings of human groups.\\" The group argues that Reich's understanding of \\"race\\" [their quotation marks] \\"is seriously flawed\\", and that \\"biological traits\\" like sickle cell anaemia have \\"nothing to do with\\" race, but are simply found in parts of the world, in this case where malaria is common. The same goes, the group argues, for other distinctions that Reich makes in the book. Pygmies and their Bantu neighbours The paleogenomics researcher Maria C. Avila Arcos reviewed the book in Science magazine, arguing that \\"troubling traces of biocolonialism undermine an otherwise eloquent synthesis of ancient genome research.\\" She calls Reich's account graceful, combining his personal opinions with \\"hard science\\" (Reich's phrase). She accepts that the book is \\"scientifically solid and comprehensive\\", but argues that it \\"raises some concerns\\", since in her view Reich overlooks the conflict of interest between the needs of researchers to gather ancient human DNA specimens and the rights of the often marginalised populations that descend from those ancestors. A review by Razib Khan, who is cited in the book, recommends the book to a wide audience as it \\"catches [one] up to the state-of-the-art knowledge that we have in terms of human history, deep and prehistoric.\\" He includes experts in that audience: \\"I‚Äôve talked to plenty of people who work in evolutionary genomics who are not totally up-to- speed on the ancient DNA revolution. They too would benefit from reading Who We Are and How We Got Here front to back. I know people who work in the field of cultural evolution, who would also benefit from reading Who We Are and How We Got Here. I know behavior geneticists who would benefit from reading Who We Are and How We Got Here. And so forth.\\" Khan concedes that the book \\"is not rich with the same stylistic flourish and engagement as one might find in a popularization by Steven Pinker or Richard Dawkins\\" but that it is a \\"serious book that is earnest in focusing on the substance of the science first.\\" The anthropologist John Hawks, writing in the Wall Street Journal, observes that Reich was surprised that the \\"concordance of near-mythological history with genetic fact\\" in the migrations in India was \\"a potential political bombshell\\"; he notes that Reich avoided it by not talking about \\"Indo-European invaders at all\\", writing only that \\"No group in India can claim genetic purity\\". In Hawks's view, Reich \\"seems a contradiction: Rising to the pinnacle of human genetics, he nonetheless exhibits incredible naivet√©\\" in affairs such as when German scientists withdrew from a paper that seemed to them \\"uncomfortably close to pre-Nazi racial theories\\", or when Native American specimen donors wished to limit the use of their DNA. Hawks argues that science needs to help people to see the humanity of the dead ancestors, and finds Reich's approach potentially dehumanizing.

The cartel existed at least from 1986 and was uncovered in 2006, when one of the member companies provided information to authorities. The cartel operated by price fixing, bid rigging and market allocation. In 2009, the European Union imposed total fines of 131 million Euros on the member companies; one of these fines was later reduced by 19 million Euros by the courts. By 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice had also levied fines of $12.3 million against four of the companies. Several individuals involved in the cartel received prison sentences in the UK and the US.  Cartel members * Bridgestone Corporation * Yokohama Rubber Company * Dunlop Oil & Marine Ltd, belonging to Continental AG * Trelleborg Industries SAS, belonging to Trelleborg AB * Parker ITR Srl, belonging to Parker Hannifin * Manuli Rubber Industries SpA  Operation  The cartel operated with a cartel coordinator. Cartel members reported customer inquiries to the coordinator, who would then allocate the customer to one particular cartel member, unbeknownst to the customer. The members would then agree on fake price quotes, so that the intended member would win the bid.  Investigation and prosecutions  In December 2006, the Yokohama Rubber Company provided information about the cartel to EU authorities. In return the company did not have to pay any fines, in agreement with the 2006 Commission Notice on Immunity from fines and reduction of fines in cartel cases. The EU then launched surprise inspections at the member companies and interviewed individuals. A May 2007 meeting of the cartel in Houston was secretly taped by the FBI. Eight employees were arrested, seven of which pleaded guilty and served prison terms of up to two years; one employee was acquitted. In 2008, the UK's Office of Fair Trading obtained convictions of three Dunlop executives involved in the cartel, resulting in prison sentences between 30 and 36 months. The sentences were reduced on appeal to 20-30 months. = Romano Pisciotti = Romano Pisciotti, an Italian citizen, had participated in the cartel as an employee of Parker. The U.S. obtained a sealed indictment against him in 2010. Italy does not extradite its citizens to the U.S., but when Pisciotti changed planes in Frankfurt, Germany in 2013, he was arrested and extradition proceedings were initiated. His appeal to the German Federal Constitutional Court was unsuccessful, and he was extradited to the U.S. in 2014. He thus became the first European citizen to be extradited to the U.S. on antitrust charges. As part of a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty and received a 24-month prison sentence and a $50,000 fine. Pisciotti then sued the German government for damages, claiming that the EU prohibition on discrimination had been violated in his case, as Germany will not extradite German citizens to the U.S. The European Court of Justice rejected this argument in April 2018, holding that discrimination is justified in cases like this.

Critics have called 'El Hijo De' one of Uruguay's best albums of the decadeRaspa, pega y enciende, Guilherme De Alencar Pinto, Brecha https://brecha.com.uy/raspa-pega-enciende/  breaking ground for a new evolution of candombe. He has been awarded a Uruguayan National Music Award twice in the jazz fusion category. As a composer he does not cling to any particular style, although there's a clear tendency to experimentation and the fusion of elements of Uruguayan roots music (candombe, tango, folklore), as well as the influence of his time in the studio as a producer and his academic studies in music and technology.  Early life  A self-taught guitarist he started playing rock, pop and Uruguayan folklore as a teenager. His early influences included The Beatles and Nirvana, Uruguayan stars of candombe Jaime Roos and Totem and the flamenco guitarist, Paco de Luc√≠a. He formed his first rock fusion band in 2000 and at the same time he decided to drop out of college where he was studying engineering to dedicate himself full-time to music. He began a degree in composition at the University School of Music in Montevideo and in parallel studying sound, acoustics and recording studio design.  Musical career  Since 2008 as a producer he has recorded and produced more than thirty albums in Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina.http://www.diegojanssen.com/discografia/ Complete discography of albums produced by Diego Janssen He's hands-on, participating or leading production, recording, mixing and / or mastering, and at times as a session musician. In 2016 he was nominated for Best Producer in the Premios Graffiti for his work on the album 'Nidal' by dark rock band Buenos Muchachos. During this period he participated as guitarist in a number of bands including Trelew, Dami√°n Gularte, Ojos del Cielo and Sebasti√°n Jantos. And at the same time he deepened his exploration of roots music from Uruguay, and elsewhere in Latin America and North America. In 2010 as part of the duo Afrosambas with percussionist Jos√© 'Pepe' Mart√≠nez, he recorded a set of instrumental versions of compositions by Baden Powell, Astor Piazzolla, Pink Floyd and Eduardo Mateo. His debut solo album 'El Hijo de'https://diegojanssen.bandcamp.com/ 'El Hijo De' online won critical acclaim as well as a nomination for the Premios Graffiti in 2016 in the category Candombe Fusion. The album is an instrumental journey of experimentation and changing sound climates, where elements coming from across the world collide. Blues rock and jazz meet contemporary candombe and milonga, going through both psychedelic and other more manic moments, generating a tribal feeling from a modern optic. El Hijo de received support from FONAM, the Uruguayan fund for music.

The roots of the problem lay in the ethnically mixed population of the Corpus Separatum in a time of growing nationalism, Italian irredentism and Yugoslavism, which led ultimately to the creation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. The question was a major barrier to agreement at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference but was partially resolved by the Treaty of Rapallo between Italy and Yugoslavia on 12 November 1920. Background Fiume (or Rijeka in Croatian) was for centuries home to a Slavonic speaking working class and an Italian commercial class. The settlement had very humble dimensions until it was declared a free port (together with the Port of Trieste) in 1719 by Austrian emperor Charles VI, and subsequently annexed to the Kingdom of Hungary by Austrian empress Maria Theresa in 1779 as a Corpus Separatum and Hungary's only international port. This brought a rapid economic and industrial growth, in particular in the time encompassing the second half of the 19th century and up to World War I. In this period Fiume also saw a shift in the ethnic composition of the city. The Kingdom of Hungary, which administered the city during that period, favoured the Hungarian element in the city and encouraged immigration from all lands of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The city became a melting pot encompassing most of the main ethnicities and cultures in empire, being also a main departure port for emigration to the New World. The mixed ethnic composition would open the doors to the Fiume Question in the years following World War I and the demise of the Habsburg Empire. At the last Austro-Hungarian census in 1911, the Corpus Separatum had a population of 49,608 people and was composed of the following linguistic communities:A.J.P. Taylor: The Habsburg Monarchy, 1809‚Äì1918, University of Chicago Press, Paperback edition, 1976, , page 269 Total population: 49,608: * Italian: 23,283 (46,9%) * Croatian: 15,731 (31,7%) * Slovenian: 3,937 (7,9%) * Hungarian: 3,619 (7,3%) * German: 2,476 (5,0%) * English: 202 (0,4%) * Czech: 183 (0,3%) * Serbian: 70 (0,14%) * French: 40 (0,08%) * Polish: 36 (0,07%) * Romanian: 29 (0,06%) The Peace conference in Paris and the Italo-Yugoslav dispute Habsburg-ruled Austria-Hungary's disintegration (October 1918) in the closing weeks of World War I led to the establishment of rival Croato-Serbian and Italian administrations in the city; both Italy and the founders of the new Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) claimed sovereignty based on their \\"irredentist\\" (\\"unredeemed\\") ethnic populations. After a brief military occupation by the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes, followed by the unilateral annexation of the former Corpus Separatum by Zagreb and Belgrade, an international force of British, Italian, French and American troops entered the city (November 1918). Its future came under discussion at the Paris Peace Conference during the course of 1919. Italy based its claim on the fact that Italians comprised the largest single nationality within the city (65% of the total population at the time of the peace conference, according to local Italian sources). Croats made up a good part of the remainder and were also a majority in the surrounding area, including the neighbouring town of Su≈°ak.Anonymous, 1919.

Andrea Ossoinack, who had been the last delegate from Fiume to the Hungarian Parliament, was admitted to the conference as a representative of Fiume, and essentially supported the Italian claims. Nevertheless, the city had a strong and very active Autonomist Party advocating an independent state, which also had its delegates at the Paris conference and was represented by Ruggero Gotthardi.

Barnstable County comprises all of Cape Cod, MA. Barnstable's Olde Colonial Courthouse The courthouse was a wood-frame structure in the Georgian style typical of small government buildings of the era, roughly 30' by 40', facing the roadway, with a brick and stone foundation, round-top windows, copula belfry and a small, enclosed entry porch. The building housed only the courtroom. Juries deliberated in a nearby tavern. Court records were kept in a separate wood-frame building to the east, the County House, which burned to the ground in 1827, with the loss of nearly all accumulated court records. The History of the Barnstable Superior Court, 2009, Charles Sabatt, Barnstable Superior Court Col. James Otis was presiding judge here from 1764 until 1776. Otis was the father of James Otis Jr., an early opponent of British policy. John Adams argued at least one case in this courthouse, on May 16, 1767. John Adams Diary 14, July 1766, 4 April - 18 May 1767, Adams Family Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society The courthouse was the site of a mass protest on Sept. 27, 1774, after Britain abrogated Massachusetts Bay's 1691 charter ‚Äî one of a series of Coercive Acts intended to punish the colonists for the Boston Tea Party the previous year. As a result of the protest, all Barnstable county officials agreed to ignore Parliament's new rules, effectively freeing Cape Cod of British control.History of Cape Cod, Annals of Barnstable County, Vol. 1, 1858, Frederick Freeman, Private printing The protest was similar to actions mounted at county courthouses across Massachusetts the summer and autumn of 1774. By the end of that year, all of Massachusetts was free of British control except for Boston, where British forces were stationed. The Royal Governor, Gen. Thomas Gage, was unable to retake control of the colony for lack of an adequate military presence. His major effort the next spring to secure military stores in Concord, MA, resulted in the Battle of Lexington and Concord, the first engagement in what became the Revolutionary War. The First American Revolution: Before Lexington and Concord, 2002, Ray Raphael, The New Press The Barnstable building is one of only two remaining Massachusetts colonial-era courthouses where those 1774 protests were mounted. The county dedicated a new courthouse in 1834, consolidating all court functions in a large, granite structure closer to the present center of Barnstable Village. The History of the Barnstable Superior Court, 2009, Charles Sabatt, Barnstable Superior Court The old courthouse was remodeled in 1842 to serve as a home for the newly formed Third Barnstable Baptist Church. After the church was disbanded in 1972, the building was purchased by Tales of Cape Cod, a nonprofit volunteer group committed to preserving the Cape's history. The building is a contributing property of both the federal and Barnstable town Old King's Highway Historic District.

Mindell is an American evolutionary biologist and author. He is currently a visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. Mindell's work is focused on the systematics, conservation and molecular evolution of birds, especially birds of prey. He is known for his 2006 book, The Evolving World in which he explained, for the general public, how evolution applies to everyday life. From 1994 to 2008 Mindell was Professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and Curator of birds at the University of Michigan. He served as Dean of Science and Harry & Diana Hind Chair at the California Academy of Sciences between 2008 and 2011, and was Program Director in the Division of Environmental Biology at the US National Science Foundation during 2012 to 2016.  Biography  Mindell was born in Buffalo, New York, where he attended Nichols School. He received a B.S. degree from Prescott College in 1975, and a Ph.D. degree from Brigham Young University in 1986. He was a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University between 1987 and 1989, after which he joined the University of Cincinnati as an assistant professor. In 1994, Mindell joined the University of Michigan where he taught evolutionary biology and served as professor and curator of birds. In 1998, he was appointed as the director of Genomic Diversity Laboratory at the Museum of Zoology, and in 2003, he was appointed the director of Museum of Zoology. In 2006, he was awarded the Radcliffe Fellowship at Harvard University, where he conducted research on variable rates of evolutionary change across genes and organisms. He was elected to serve as the president of Society of Systematic Biology in 2011.  Research  Mindell‚Äôs research focuses on evolutionary biology, and specifically the evolution and molecular systematics of birds. He has conducted comprehensive analyses of the systematics of diurnal birds of prey (hawks, eagles, falcons, vultures) in the orders Accipitriformes, Falconiformes and Cathartiformes. His work, funded by both U.S. National Science Foundation and The Peregrine Fund, includes assessment of the genetic distinctiveness and diversity of many poorly known groups of diurnal raptors, and resolution of taxonomic uncertainties.

It was the 16th final to be held under the direct control of the Football Association (FA). The final was contested between Arsenal and Sunderland at the Pride Park Stadium on 4 May 2009. Arsenal won the game 2‚Äì1 to secure their fourth successive FA Cup triumph and their tenth in total. The match was attended by a crowd of 23,291. Match =Summary= Arsenal, managed by Vic Akers, reached their fourth FA Women's Cup final in succession after a 3‚Äì1 victory against Everton in the semi-finals, while Premier League Northern Division side Sunderland, managed by Mick Mulhern, reached their first ever final in the competition after beating Chelsea 3‚Äì0 at the Stadium of Light, becoming the first team from outside the top flight to do so since Fulham in 2002. Arsenal, who came into the game as favourites, dominated the vast majority of the match, with Gemma Davison and Kim Little creating several chances in the opening minutes. Sunderland created their first half chance as Sophie Williams chased a long ball down the left and crossed, but Niamh Fahey's challenge was enough to prevent Jordan Nobbs getting in a clean shot on goal. Arsenal hit back with Little striking over from distance and Davison drawing a save from Sunderland goalkeeper Helen Alderson after cutting in from the left. An angled shot from Suzanne Grant slid underneath Alderson, but Lucy Bronze managed to prevent Rachel Yankey from scoring with a last-ditch clearance. Arsenal took the lead just after the half hour, when Alderson failed to hold Davison's shot and Katie Chapman followed up to score from the rebound. The Gunners had a chance to double their lead two minutes ahead of the break, when Little slotted a good ball through to Grant, but her shot went wide of the far post. Arsenal had most of the possession in the second half, but their second goal came in injury time, when Chapman chipped the ball into the path of Little, who got round Alderson before tucking the ball into the empty net. Kelly McDougall pulled one back for Sunderland in the seventh minute of stoppage time, whose length was dictated by Sophie Williams having to receive more than five minutes of treatment after suffering a seizure. =Details= References 2009 Category:2008‚Äì09 in English women's football FA Women's Cup Final, 2009 FA Women's Cup Final ","title":"2009 FA Women's Cup Final"},{"id":"57339955","title":"2018 Geneva Open"},{"id":"57339956","text":"Conotrachelus compositus is a species of true weevil in the beetle family Curculionidae.

Pardosa milvina are smaller spiders with thin, long legs. This species captures prey such as arthropods with their legs and then kills them with their venom. Their predators are larger wolf spiders and beetles. Pardosa milvina are able to detect these predators from chemotactile and vibratory cues. These spiders lose limbs when escaping from predators and they can change their preferred location in order to avoid predators. These shore spiders also use chemical cues in order to mate. During their mating ritual, the male raises his legs and shakes his body. Both males and females can use silk, a chemotactile cue, for sexual communication. Additionally, female shore spiders heavily invest in their offspring, keeping them in egg sacs and carrying them for a few weeks after they are born. Description The shore spider‚Äôs eyes are arranged in a characteristic pattern with the top row having four eyes and the subsequent rows having only two eyes each. They have thin, long legs as well as long spines. Pardosa milvina cannot climb smooth surfaces due to their lack of scopulae, the tufts of hair at the end of spider legs. These wolf spiders have smaller chelicerae and more wavy dorsal stripes than other spiders in this family. They have yellow spots on their abdomen and males have white hairs on their patella or kneecap. Shore spiders are a smaller spider, as the largest female is approximately 6.2 mm in length and the largest male is approximately 4.7 mm. Additionally, female spiders carry large egg sacs. Habitat and Distribution Pardosa milvina are located in high densities near rivers and agricultural areas of eastern North America. There are large variances in their abundance throughout the year. They can also be found in dry, open woods near water, such as by rivers, ponds, and streams of New England, Georgia, and west of the Rockies. Additionally, shore spiders are abundant in disturbed habitats and are commonly found on soil surfaces or in patches of mulch. Diet Pardosa milvina are active cursorial predators and active foragers. They feed on ground-dwelling arthropods like crickets. These spiders consume Diptera, Collembola, Homoptera, Thysanoptera, small Orthoptera, and small Araneae. Although they are smaller spiders, they can overwhelm their prey with thier chelicerae and legs. This species grabs prey with their legs and chelicerae, biting the prey until it is killed by the spider's venom. They sometimes roll onto their backs when they are fighting with the prey. They can also eat juvenile Hogna helluo. Enemies =Predators= Larger wolf spiders like Tigrosa helluo and Hogna helluo are predators of Pardosa milvina. Additionally, ground beetles (Scarites quadriceps) are also predators of the shore spider. The adult Hogna helluo is 20 times larger than Pardosa. The egg sacs of female Pardosa milvina contribute to predation and foraging costs. Females that don't have egg sacs are able to avoid predation as they are able to move more easily. =Parasites= One acrocerid that parasitizes Pardosa milvina is Ogcodes eugonatus. Another parasite of shore spiders are mermithid nematode endoparasites. These can emerge from the ventral abdomen of shore spiders. Protective Behaviors =Detecting Predators= Predators can announce their presence through signals or predator cues. Pardosa milvina use chemotactile predator cues like silk, faeces, and other excreta in order to determine when a predator is nearby. They are then able to respond to the amount of predation risk based on these cues. When visual or chemotactile predator cues are not present, Pardosa milvina can use vibratory cues in order to assess the risk from the predator. When they detect these predators through these cues, Pardosa milvina decrease their activity. They only decrease activity when the predator is alerted to their presence. However, if the predator did not detect the spider was nearby, this spider would continue its activity. Pardosa milvina are more responsive to isolated chemotactile cues as they are usually more reliable than vibratory cues alone. Chemotactile cues from predators can give Pardosa more specific information like the sex, size, diet, and hunger levels of the predator. Usually, these spiders only respond to the most threatening predator's vibratory cues. Pardosa miliva will use vibratory cues mainly when they are the only information available to them. =Site Selection= Pardosa milvina changes their site preference in order to avoid predators. When there is presumably no danger present, Pardosa milvina prefer more complex grass habitats over bare dirt. However, when there are predator cues, this preference is gone. Pardosa milvina can capture more prey in dirt but they are more likely to be attacked by predators, specifically Hogna helluo. There is a tradeoff between the quality of habitat and the increased risk of predation. The negative effect of predation risk is worse than having slightly less food. Pardosa milvina spiders are active foragers who can go to new habitats when threatened and remain successful in prey capture. =Leg Autonomy= The loss of legs in Pardosa milvina is quite common. These spiders can sacrifice their legs in order to avoid predation. If a male Pardosa were to lose its first pair of legs, it would decrease his overall fitness. This is because the frontal legs and their symmetry are an important characteristic when courting females. Even with a loss of limbs, there is little difference in the prey capture technique for Pardosa. The only difference is that those with no loss to the frontal legs are able to eat larger prey. This could lower the fitness of females by reducing the size of their egg sacs and number of eggs. When attempting to escape from a predator, Pardosa milvina with leg loss were able to escape as they normally would. However, they might end up losing more limbs from this predator interaction. Spiders with all their legs might be better off because they have more limbs to give up to the predator and therefore escape. Pardosa milvina could be able to survive with less legs since they are born with more legs than they actually require. They are able to give up some limbs in order to escape the predator. Mating =Male Courtship= Males use substrate-borne chemical cues to gain information on the mating status of females. When males detect silk and pheromones from a virgin female, their courtship response is more energized. Males court the females by raising their legs and shaking their bodies. The rate at which the males lift their legs is an accurate representation of their assets sincex females who mate with males that raise their legs rapidly during courtship produce more surviving offspring. Pardosa milvina can identify chemotactile cues like silk or feces from a predator. The courtship activity of males makes them more susceptible to attacks from Tigrosa helluo. The risk of attacks from predators affects the intensity of the male's courtship ritual. The symmetry of the front legs of a male Pardosa milvina is related to the rate of his leg raises. Males with symmetrical front legs have a lower intensity courtship when there are predator cues present as they have a high potential for future mating and reproduction. However, males with asymmetrical front legs court with high intensity when predator cues are present because they are desperate to mate and reproduce as they might not have many opportunities. =Sexual Communication= Female silk evokes male courtship behavior. Spiders use silk to chemically communicate with each other. Females use silk to release their sex pheromones indicating their mating status and willingness to mate with males. Pardosa milvina produces three types of silk: dragline silk, attachment disks, and cord silk. Dragline silk are thin, white strands made from ampullate glands and are most likely used to get male attention. Attachment disks are made from piriform silk glands and can be used to keep dragline silk on to the substrate. However, these can still be made without other silk types. For example, male Pardosa milvina use attachment disks to find the correct direction to follow females. Cord silk are thick, tan strands and are usually short. Females are able to tell the difference between silk from courting males and from non-courting males. When females are in the presence of courting males, they deposit more attachment disks and dragline silk. Cord silk deposition does not differ with the presence of courting or non-courting males. Females might be enhancing directional signals in order for the males to use attachment disks to follow females This shows how silk is used for sexual communication. Parental Care =Egg Sacs= Females invest in brooding their offspring by making an egg sac by wrapping the eggs with fibrous sheets of silk. They attach this egg sac to their Spinneret and carry the sac for 12 to 30 days. The egg sac is off-white, tan, or blue in color. After this carrying period, the egg sac is torn and spiderlings emerge. These spiderlings are still carried by their mother for 3 to 24 days. The size and weight of these egg sacs make it harder for the female to attack prey and avoid predators. Occasionally, female shore spiders drop their egg sacs which could result in the death of the spiderlings.

Partisan activities  In November 1941 Ubiyvovk founded a Komsomol underground resistance cell that came to be nicknamed \\"The Undefeated Poltav Women\\". Initially the group consisted of only nine members plus herself, but eventually they managed to recruit more people until the group's membership reached twenty people, plus Ubiyvovk and a correspondent for the Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper, Captain Sergey Sapigo. Initially the group began providing food and civilian clothes to Soviet prisoners-of-war held near a hospital where one of them worked, but after receiving two radios from a partisan detachment hiding in the Dikan forest they also began providing information transcribed from the podcasts. In the group's six months of existence they spread 2,000 anti-Axis leaflets, helped 18 Soviet prisoners-of-war escape, stole weapons from German depots, burned down an office holding records and lists of people scheduled to be exiled into forced labor, and helped other cities establish resistance movements. On one occasion the partisans sabotaged equipment at a tank repair facility, causing the tanks repaired there to break down as soon as they were put back into service; they also destroyed a powerplant. Eventually the unit began making plants to enter communication with the Red Army and go on reconnaissance missions, but an operative traveling to send a report to the Red Army detailing their activities and the information they would be able to provide if they could engage in regular communication was captured. The operative was tortured and eventually betrayed the group members, identifying Ubiyvovk and Sapigo as individuals of interest. Soon all members of the resistance were arrested and interrogated over a period of three weeks before they were all shot on 26 May 1942. Ubiyvovk had been tortured and interrogated twenty-six times before her execution and had sent letters requesting poison so she could kill herself if needed.

It is found in Central America and desert regions of southwestern North America. Description This species is known as the light western drywood termite because the winged reproductives (the only forms seen in the open) are a much paler colour than those of Incisitermes minor, the dark western drywood termite. The alates are about long and a yellowish color with pale wings. The soldiers are recognisable by the elongated, club-shaped third segment of their antennae. Distribution and habitat This termite is native to Central America, Mexico, California and southern and central Arizona. It is normally found below , and in Arizona is replaced by I. minor in the higher parts of the state. It is more tolerant of extreme aridity than I. minor and prefers drier conditions. Its natural hosts are trees such as cottonwoods in canyons and near riverbeds, and it will colonise the remains of dead saguaro cacti. With increased urbanization of its habitat, it is colonizing human built structures, with timber-framed homes being particularly at risk. Ecology Marginitermes hubbardi is a drywood termite; this means that after the nuptial flight, a male and female will form their new colony directly in sound dry timber without a terrestrial or dampwood phase. Individual termites will search for a nest site in a hole or crevice in suitable dry wood. The alate sheds its wings either before entering the hole, or inside it. The termite has tergal glands on its abdomen which may release a pheromone, and another alate may join the first one in the hole. Plugging of the entrance hole with a faecal plug is a sign that the colony has been founded. The pair mate and the female lays a small batch of eggs which develop into nymphs. As the colony expands and the nymphs create galleries, they extract all the water that they need from the wood they eat, and they make small holes to the exterior through which they push their faecal pellets. In the Sonoran Desert in Arizona, the aridity is so high as to discourage the existence of wood-rotting fungi. Under these conditions, dead woody objects would persist for a very long time, but termites are important to the desert ecosystem, chewing their way through the cellulose litter and creating space for other organisms to grow. M. hubbardi mainly feeds on saguaro skeletons while Pterotermes occidentis, another drywood termite, does the same for Parkinsonia florida, the blue palo verde.

Post-war, she then became involved with the High Altitude Observatory in Denver. Intensely interested in astronomy and solar research, she was respected as one of the organization's most articulate and effective advocates, recruiting members of the Coors family and other patrons who provided significant amounts of funding for operations and research. She also helped to plan the HAO annual scientific lectures known as \\"Captain Mary Dinners.\\"Bates, Sally. Captain Mary, National Center for Atmospheric Research. In 1957, she relocated to the Camarillo, California ranch of her son Elisha, but still remained active as a fundraiser and advocate for the observatory.Bates, Sally.

Proponents of feminist urbanism advance a perspective that is critical of partriachal political and social structures that they believe have negatively impacted women's lives and have limited female engagement in urban planning. Some feminist urbanism theorists view the urban built environment as fundamentally inhospitable to women.Andrews, Margaret. \\"Introduction.\\" Journal of Romance Studies, vol. 7, no. 1, 2007, p. 1+. Consequently, the feminist urbanism movement supports strategies for empowering women to plan and develop the future urban environment according to the specific needs of women.  Theory  As a reflection of the diversity of the field of urbanism, theories of feminist urbanism variously studies the impact of female exclusion from urban scholarship, in civic decision making processes, and in the design of urban spaces. Theorists have researched and identified the historical exclusion of women from the fields of architecture, urban planning, and civil engineering.Kuhlmann, D. (2014). Gender studies in architecture: space, power and difference. Routledge. p. 5, 15. In relation, historians have identified the lack of power and participatory inclusion of women in traditional western societies as being the root cause of these same inhospitable conditions.Morton, Patricia. \\"The Social and the Poetic: Feminist Practices in Architecture 1970-2000.\\" The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader. Jones, Amelia, ed. Psychology Press, 2003. Theorists have long studies intersections of behavior and environment and many notable theorists including Michel Foucault and Henre Lefebvre have argued that architecture both reflects and reinforces social norms and patterns of behavior. Lefebvre has gone so far as to argue that \\"everything is ontological\\" spatial and that physical spaces and their design play a role in constructing identity and ideas of self-hood. The theory of feminist urbanism is focused on the ideals of feminism, a diverse field with multiple viewpoints. Feminist urban scholars have suggests that other related movements around improving conditions after racial segregation and more liberal radical planning do not necessarily account for all of the needs of women. Conversely, some feminist scholars have criticized feminist urbanism as reinforcing gender stereotypes with respect to the urban environment particularly when planning for reconstructing urban spaces. These controversies are supported by the layout of communities due to the growth of urbanism. With the increase in individual homes, women's tasks were moved from communal villages, to personal home life. Researchers discovered that the structure of suburbs continued to benefit the role of men as dominant providers and further encumber women from branching out from their traditional roles. Because housing was spaced further apart, women suffered from isolation of their community and therefore had no further way to participate within the family than their roles as caretaker. Along with this, there was a development of the domestic economy. When this concept was emerged, it placed importance on the \\"professional home management\\" and its efficiency, ultimately pressuring women to continue their traditional gender roles. Theorists *Dolores Hayden is an academic and urban historian who has examined the way urban space is impacted by gender, and has posited that concepts of the domestic and domesticity must be considered when studying architecture and urbanism.Ganim, John M.\\"Cities of Words: Recent Studies on Urbanism and Literature.\\" MLQ: Modern Language Quarterly, vol. 63 no. 3, 2002, pp. 365-382.

In graph theory, an odd cycle transversal of an undirected graph is a set of vertices of the graph that has a nonempty intersection with every odd cycle in the graph. Removing the vertices of an odd cycle transversal from a graph leaves a bipartite graph as the remaining induced subgraph. Relation to vertex cover A given n-vertex graph G has an odd cycle transversal of size k, if and only if the Cartesian product of graphs G\\\\square K_2 (a graph consisting of two copies of G, with corresponding vertices of each copy connected by the edges of a perfect matching) has a vertex cover of size n+k. The odd cycle transversal can be transformed into a vertex cover by including both copies of each vertex from the transversal and one copy of each remaining vertex, selected from the two copies according to which side of the bipartition contains it. In the other direction, a vertex cover of G\\\\square K_2 can be transformed into an odd cycle transversal by keeping only the vertices for which both copies are in the cover. The vertices outside of the resulting transversal can be bipartitioned according to which copy of the vertex was used in the cover. Algorithms and complexity The problem of finding the smallest odd cycle transversal, or equivalently the largest bipartite induced subgraph, is also called odd cycle transversal, and abbreviated as OCT. It is NP-hard, as a special case of the problem of finding the largest induced subgraph with a hereditary property (as the property of being bipartite is hereditary). All such problems for nontrivial properties are NP-hard. The equivalence between the odd cycle transversal and vertex cover problems has been used to develop fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for odd cycle transversal, meaning that there is an algorithm whose running time can be bounded by a polynomial function of the size of the graph multiplied by a larger function of k. The development of these algorithms led to the method of iterative compression, a more general tool for many other parameterized algorithms. The parameterized algorithms known for these problems take nearly-linear time for any fixed value of k. Alternatively, with polynomial dependence on the graph size, the dependence on k can be made as small as 2.3146^k. In contrast, the analogous problem for directed graphs does not admit a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm under standard complexity- theoretic assumptions.

The Ministry was first created in 2000 through a merger of the Ministry of Agriculture (Landwirtschaftsministerium) and the Ministry of Environment (Umweltministerium); it gained responsibility for the energy sector, mining, and tourism under the first Kurz cabinet in 2018. The current Minister of Agriculture, Regions and Tourism is Elisabeth K√∂stinger.  History  The Ministry's earliest precursor was the Cisleithanian Ministry of Agriculture (Ackerbauministerium), created in 1867. In additional to agriculture, the Ministry was responsible for regulating hunting, fishing, and hydraulic engineering, excluding hydraulic engineering of military importance. The organization was renamed to Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Ministerium f√ºr Land- und Forstwirtschaft) in 1918 and was briefly called a department (Staatsamt) rather than a ministry during the two periods of constitutional transition following the two World Wars. Except for the name, however, the Ministry survived mostly in its original form until 2000. In 1972, Austria established the Ministry of Health and the Environment (Ministerium f√ºr Gesundheit und Umweltschutz, usually called Gesundheitsministerium or Umweltministerium for short). In 1987, family affairs were added to its portfolio, turning it into the Ministry of Environment, Youth and Family Affairs (Ministerium f√ºr Umwelt, Jugend und Familie) In 2000, the two ministries were combined to form the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management (Ministerium f√ºr Land- und Forstwirtschaft, Umwelt und Wasserwirtschaft, although often called Lebensministerium). Responsibility for family affairs was moved to the Ministry of Social Affairs (Sozialministerium) at the time. When the first Kurz cabinet took office in December 2017, the ministry was put in charge of the energy sector, mining, and tourism in addition to its existing powers and duties; it also gained its current designation. The additional responsibilities created an institution with exceptionally broad authority; the new ministry has been described as a \\"super ministry\\" (Superministerium) and a \\"behemoth\\" (Riese); the cabinet had difficulties finding a new name that would adequately reflect its extensive purview, the present minister has noted. The move was not completely uncontroversial. After the Second Kurz government took office in January 2020, the ministry was renamed Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Regions and Tourism.  Responsibilities  As of January 2020, the Ministry is charged with regulating, supervising, or managing, respectively: * agricultural policy and law; * alternative service to military service: Zivildienst also called Regionaldienst (German for \\"regional service\\") * the food sector with the exception of food safety; * forestry policy and law; * domestic markets for agricultural, food and forestry products, including seeds and seed stock, animal food, fertilizer, plant protection products, including their regulatory approval, with the exception of price regulation, surveillance, and control; * imports and exports; * wine law and viticultural supervision; * land reform; agricultural authorities; agricultural and forestry real estate transactions; * measures aimed at reducing the agriculture and forestry sector's exposure to debt; * water law and water management with the exception of the engineering aspects of waterway, water supply, and sewerage construction; * plant protection; * agricultural and forestry schools, including human resources management, to the extent not handles by the Chancellery; * agricultural and forestry commodity exchanges; * professional representation of agricultural and forestry entrepreneurs and freelancers; * management of public real estate used for agriculture and forestry; * hunting and fishing; * protecting Austria's border waters and safeguarding Austria's water rights and water management interests; engineering aspects of water construction in border waters, with the exception of the Danube, the March, and the Thaya downstream from Bernhardsthal; * mining; * postal and telecommunications services; * voluntary service; * tourism.  Structure  Since January 2020, the ministry consists of the Minister and her personal staff (Kabinett), the office of the general secretary, a special coordination department, and five numbered regular departments (Sektionen): # Water management and hydraulic engineering (Wasserwirtschaft) # Agriculture and rural development (Landwirtschaft und l√§ndliche Entwicklung) # Forestry and Sustainability (Forstwirtschaft und Nachhaltigkeit) # Telecommunications and postal service and mining (Telekommunikation, Post und Bergbau) # Tourism and regional policy (Tourismus und Regionalpolitik) The Minister and her staff are political appointees; the general secretary and the section heads are career civil servants.

As a young woman she was indulged by her parents and she led a life subsidised by occasional prostitution.

When she was eighteen she persuaded her parents to take poison explaining that it was medicine that has been given to them by the doctor to fix the family's syphilis. Noziere then went out for the evening and when she returned to the flat she found her parents inert bodies. She turned on the gas and when the smell was overpowering she went to a nearby flat where she said that she thought that her parents had tried to commit suicide.

He contends that over half of societal work is pointless, which becomes psychologically destructive when paired with a work ethic that associates work with self- worth. Graeber describes five types of meaningless jobs, in which workers pretend their role is not as pointless or harmful as they know it to be: flunkies, goons, duct tapers, box tickers, and taskmasters. He argues that the association of labor with virtuous suffering is recent in human history, and proposes universal basic income as a potential solution. The book is an extension of a popular essay Graeber published in 2013, which was later translated into 12 languages and whose underlying premise became the subject of a YouGov poll. Graeber subsequently solicited hundreds of testimonials from people with meaningless jobs and revised his case into a book that was published by Simon & Schuster in May 2018. Summary The author interviewed on the premises of the book, June 2018 In Bullshit Jobs, American anthropologist David Graeber posits that the productivity benefits of automation have not led to a 15-hour workweek, as predicted by economist John Maynard Keynes in 1930, but instead to \\"bullshit jobs\\": \\"a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.\\" The author contends that more than half of societal work is pointless, both large parts of some jobs and, as he describes, five types of entirely pointless jobs: # flunkies, who serve to make their superiors feel important, e.g., receptionists, administrative assistants, door attendants # goons, who oppose other goons hired by other companies, e.g., lobbyists, corporate lawyers, telemarketers, public relations specialists # duct tapers, who temporarily fix problems that could be fixed permanently, e.g., programmers repairing shoddy code, airline desk staff who calm passengers whose bags do not arrive # box tickers, who create the appearance that something useful is being done when it is not, e.g., survey administrators, in-house magazine journalists, corporate compliance officers # taskmasters, who manage‚Äîor create extra work for‚Äîthose who do not need it, e.g., middle management, leadership professionals Graeber argues that these jobs are largely in the private sector despite the idea that market competition would root out such inefficiencies. In companies, he concludes that the rise of service sector jobs owes less to economic need than to \\"managerial feudalism\\", in which employers need underlings in order to feel important and maintain competitive status and power. In society, he credits the Puritan-capitalist work ethic for making the labor of capitalism into religious duty: that workers did not reap advances in productivity as a reduced workday because, as a societal norm, they believe that work determines their self-worth, even as they find that work pointless. Graeber describes this cycle as \\"profound psychological violence\\" and \\"a scar across our collective soul\\". Graeber suggests that one of the challenges to confronting our feelings about bullshit jobs is a lack of a behavioral script in much the same way that people are unsure of how to feel if they are the object of unrequited love. In turn, rather than correcting this system, Graeber writes, individuals attack those whose jobs are innately fulfilling. Graeber holds that work as a source of virtue is a recent idea, that work was disdained by the aristocracy in classical times, but inverted as virtuous through then-radical philosophers like John Locke. The Puritan idea of virtue through suffering justified the toil of the working classes as noble. And so, Graeber continues, bullshit jobs justify contemporary patterns of living: that the pains of dull work are suitable justification for the ability to fulfill consumer desires, and that fulfilling those desires is indeed the reward for suffering through pointless work. Accordingly, over time, the prosperity extracted from technological advances has been reinvested into industry and consumer growth for its own sake rather than the purchase of additional leisure time from work. Bullshit jobs also serve political ends, in which political parties are more concerned about having jobs than whether the jobs are fulfilling. In addition, he contends, populations occupied with busywork have less time to revolt. As a potential solution, Graeber suggests universal basic income, a livable benefit paid to all, without qualification, which would let people work at their leisure. The author credits a natural human work cycle of cramming and slacking as the most productive way to work, as farmers, fishers, warriors, and novelists vary in the rigor of work based on need for productivity, not the standard working hours, which can appear arbitrary when compared to cycles of productivity. Graeber contends that time not spent pursuing pointless work could instead be spent pursuing creative activities.  Publication  The author, in 2015 In 2013, Graeber published an essay in the magazine Strike, \\"On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs\\", which argued the pointlessness of many contemporary jobs, particularly those in fields of finance, law, human resources, public relations, and consultancy. Its popularity, with over one million hits, crashed the website of its publisher, the radical magazine Strike! The essay was subsequently translated into 12 languages. YouGov undertook a related poll, in which 37% of some surveyed Britons thought that their jobs did not contribute 'meaningfully' to the world. Graeber subsequently solicited hundreds of testimonials of bullshit jobs and revised his case into a book, Bullshit Jobs: A Theory. By the end of 2018, the book was translated into French, German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, and Chinese.  Reception  A review in The Times praises the book's academic rigor and humor, especially in some job examples, but altogether felt that Graeber's argument was \\"enjoyably overstated\\". The reviewer found Graeber's historical work ethic argument convincing, but offered counterarguments on other points: That the average British workweek has decreased in the last century, that Graeber's argument for the overall proportion of pointless work is overreliant on the YouGov survey, and that the same survey does not hold that \\"most people hate their jobs\\". The reviewer maintains that while \\"managerial feudalism\\" can explain the existence of flunkies, Graeber's other types of bullshit jobs owe their existence to competition, government regulation, long supply chains, and the withering of inefficient companies‚Äîthe same ingredients responsible for luxuries of advanced capitalism such as smartphones and year-round produce.

He has held the IBF Inter-Continental and WBO International titles since 2017. Professional career Isa Chaniev made his professional debut in 2015 at the age of 22. He won the IBF Youth super featherweight title in 2016, and amassed a record of 10 wins with half of them by stoppage. On 25 May 2017, Chaniev faced Fedor Papazov for the latter's IBO and vacant IBF Inter-Continental lightweight titles in Riga, Latvia. The competitive fight resulted in a \\"razor-thin\\" unanimous decision win for Papazov. The scorecards were 115-114, 115-113 and 116-113. Chaniev's team protested the decision in addition to, what manager Khusein Buzurtanov described as, \\"the attempt to falsify the results of doping-control by the team of Papazov.\\" On 9 July, it was reported the IBF had withdrawn its recognition of the title fight due to irregularities by Papazov's team during the post-fight drug testing. Chaniev next faced Belgian veteran Jean-Pierre Bauwens for the vacant IBF Inter-Continental title on 26 August in Vilnius, Lithuania. He dominated Bauwens throughout the fight and won the bout by unanimous decision. On 9 December, Chaniev defeated Filipino lightweight Juan Martin Elorde, grandson of Gabriel \\"Flash\\" Elorde, to claim the vacant WBO International title in Nazran, Ingushetia.

Personal life Rendorp was the son of Amsterdam brewer and burgemeester Pieter Rendorp and Margaretha Calkoen. He was a scion of an originally German, Lutheran family of wealthy brewers, that despite the discrimination against non-members of the Dutch Reformed Church had been admitted to the Amsterdam Regenten class in the 1640s. In 1744 he got a sinecure at the Amsterdam Lutheran congregation as a member of its board of regency. Two years later he received a commission in the Amsterdam schutterij. He got his law degree in 1750. He married Wilhelmina Hildegonda Schuijt, a burgemeester's daughter in 1756. They had five children of whom only one son survived into adulthood.Koppius, Rendorp, pp. 799-800 Career Though his brewery was an important income source, Rendorp was mainly a rentier who had a lot of time on his hands, which he spent on government and the arts. He gathered a number of sinecures, like\\"Meesterknaap (forester) of Holland. He was Director of the Dutch colony Suriname;This colony was the property of the Society of Suriname, a company separate of the Dutch West India Company. Commissioner of the Audit Court of the province of Holland; member of the board of the Admiralty of Amsterdam; and (through his position in the Amsterdam vroedschap) a member of the Gecommitteerde Raden (Executive) of the States of Holland. As a member of the Amsterdam vroedschap Rendorp soon played a role in the city's government. As most Amsterdam regenten he was a member of the Dutch States Party, the natural opponents of the Orangists in the years since the majority of the stadtholder William V, Prince of Orange in 1766 (though through his writings one could discern some ideological affinity with the latter). The Amsterdam merchants were very interested in the possibility that the American Revolution after 1775 would reopen the American Colonies to free trade, in contravention of the British Navigation Acts. With the connivance of the Amsterdam pensionary Engelbert Fran√ßois van Berckel secret negotiations were opened in 1778 between the Amsterdam banker Jean de Neufville and the American diplomat William Lee in Aachen, which resulted in a draft treaty of amity and commerce. These negotiations were unofficial, and did not have the approval of the Dutch government, or (officially) the Amsterdam city government. When they came to light through the interception of the intended American envoy to the Dutch Republic, Henry Laurens by the British in 1780, Rendorp was one of the officials who went after van Berckel to appease the British ambassador Sir Joseph Yorke. To no avail, however, as the British declared war anyway, and the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War broke out in December 1780. Rendorp was elected an Amsterdam burgemeester for the first time (of many) in 1781 (after already having been a schepen since 1756, and a commissaris voor kleine zaken (petty magistrate) since 1757). As many other States Party regents he was an opponent of the mentor of the stadtholder, Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-L√ºneburg who thanks to the Acte van Consulentschap had a nefarious grip on the stadtholder. Rendorp went in April 1781 with a delegation of the Amsterdam city government to the stadtholder to plead for dismissal of the Duke from the Dutch government. This caused an eruption of rage by the stadtholder, and Rendorp's lack of moral courage in the face of this conflict lost him much popular support. In the same year, the new Austrian emperor (and sovereign of the Austrian Netherlands) Joseph II visited Amsterdam incognito, and was received by Rendorp. with whom he discussed a number of political issues of the time, like the closure of the Scheldt to shipping (an important issue for Amsterdam at the time) and the Barrier Treaty, which would soon bring the emperor into conflict with the Republic. Joseph emphasized the need for an early peace with Great Britain, for which he advised to use the services of the Sardinian consul Triquetti as an intermediary. As the emperor made the same proposal to the French envoy, de la Vauguyon, who soon put a stop to the peace feelers, this attempt at private diplomacy came to nothing. Rendorp later tried informal peace negotiations with the English secret agent Paul Wentworth and the ex-envoy Yorke, but these also failed. An anonymous cartoon published in 1785 about the libel case burgomasters Rendorp and Dedel of Amsterdam brought against the Patriot newspaper De Politieke Kruyer and its publisher. Rendorp was no clear partisan of either party during the Patriottentijd. He was opposed to the stadtholder, but also to the \\"democratic\\" wing of the Patriots. When he was again elected burgemeester in 1786 he tried to keep that faction at bay, as he thought that the Patriot Revolt had gone far enough, and the aims of the States Party had already been realized by the decline in the stadtholder's powers. Because of this \\"moderate\\" stance he was often the object of attacks in the Patriot press, like the Post van den Neder-Rhijn. As a magistrate of Amsterdam he could directly react: in 1785 he himself sentenced several journalists and publishers to severe fines and even prison time for press offenses against himself.Though the Dutch Republic was known for its tolerant attitude to the press, especially where it concerned foreign publications in foreign languages, there was no official freedom of the press, and the authorities regularly suppressed publications they did not like. In the 1787 election for burgemeester Rendorp was defeated by the Patriot candidate Hendrik Dani√´lsz Hooft. He therefore had to follow the upheavals, led by Colonel Isaac van Goudoever, that led to the overthrow of the Amsterdam city government in April 1787, from the sidelines. When at the end of May 1787 the Bijltjesoproer broke out, his house was one of the homes of Orangists that was looted by the Patriots. After the Prussian invasion of Holland and the fall of Amsterdam on 10 October 1787 Rendorp was readmitted to the \\"restored\\" city government. He was again elected in 1789, 1790, and 1792, the year of his death.

Soumya Sekhar Sahu, a 26 year old software engineer, and his great aunt, Jemamani Sahu, were killed by a parcel bomb delivered to Soumya's house few days after his wedding. Soumya's wife, Reema was seriously injured. After months of investigation, Police arrested a colleague of Soumya's mother whom she had replaced at the college where she taught. Incident On 23 February 2018, five days after the wedding of Soumya Sekhar Sahu and Reema Sahu, an explosion occurred at their home in Patnagarh, Odisha, India as Soumya opened a just- delivered parcel. The parcel had a return address of a person unknown to either of them, S. K. Sharma of Raipur, away. Soumya reportedly remarked, \\"This looks like a wedding gift. The only thing that I don't know is the sender. I don't know anyone in Raipur\\". The resulting explosion tore the plaster off the ceiling, cracked the walls, and hurled the kitchen window into a nearby field. Soumya and his great aunt Jemamani, who was visiting the couple at the time, suffered 90% TBSA burns and died en route to hospital. Reema was taken to hospital with serious injuries. Investigation Neither of the couple had known enemies. Soumya Sekhar's parents were college lecturers. Soumya worked for a Japanese electronics firm in Bangalore. Police still did not have a suspect a month after the fatal bombing. Pressured by media coverage, including a video of Soumya's wife wailing upon learning of her husband's death, the police turned the case over to an elite police branch in the state capital. One suspect was cleared after police traced a threatening call to a former boyfriend of Soumya's wife who believed he was dumped for a richer man; after he underwent a voluntary polygraph test, he was dismissed as a suspect. Police investigators traced the package to a courier company, but it had no office video surveillance of the package's customer. Arrest In April 2018, Balangir police received an anonymous letter which blamed the parcel bombing on Soumya's \\"betrayal\\" and a loss of money, possibly as a result of a property dispute. The letter clarified that the sender was an S. K. Sinha, not R. K. Sharma, and also mentioned the involvement of \\"three men\\". Police investigators spent more than a month pursuing leads in four different cities. Finally, Soumya's mother studied the letter and recalled that her colleague often used the phrase \\"completing the project\\", which was similar to the phrase in the letter of \\"undertaking the project\\". Punji Lal Meher, an English teacher and formerly the principal of the Jyoti Vikas College in Balangir district who was replaced by Soumya's mother, was arrested after having been questioned earlier and dismissed as a suspect. Upon being questioned again after the receipt of the letter by the police, Meher said that he had been approached and threatened if he didn't mail a letter. The police investigator did not believe the explanation, remarking, \\"It was the most incredible story that we've heard from a suspect\\". Police sent computer hardware belonging to the suspect to an Israeli company for analysis and recovery of deleted data. Meher was accused of traveling to Raipur without his mobile phone or buying a train ticket and posting the parcel, returning the same day. The suspect is thought to have had a desire \\"to be noticed\\" as an explanation of the bombing. He was taken to Raipur to be confronted by witnesses. Significance and aftermath The parcel bombing was widely reported in India and other countries. The BBC characterized it as having \\"riveted India\\". A film, titled Bullet Raja, is planned starring Odia actor Hara Rath and directed by Sridhar Martha. Patnagarh Movie Actor Manoj Mishra, Atul Kulkarni, Chinmay Mishra, Anu Choudhury, director Rajesh Touchriver Producer Sridhar Martha are making a film based on the event.

She also participated in the 2014 \\"Bending the Borders\\" multimedia exhibition in Belgrade, Serbia. Her 2016 show at Belgrade Fashion Week paid homage to Oskar Schlemmer, a German artist who created costumes for the theater. Using natural fibers like wool and silk, the clothing was characterized by abstract designs and tailored shapes. That same year, a second collection was inspired by the Mediterranean, in its use of oceanic blues and the traditional black clothing worn there. Lalic also created an all red collection for the Hemofarm Foundation, as part of a special project sponsored by Belgrade Fashion Week.

The term Khok Wua means \\"cattle stable\\" due to the function of this area in the reign of King Nangklao (Rama III), when it was a pasture and grove wood with Hindus cow stables in order to send cow's milk to the nearby Grand Palace. Later in the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), the stables were demolished and the area became the residences of Muslims who emigrated from southern Thailand.

The Myola, could unfurl sails on her two tall masts and gain a knot or so of additional speed when the wind suited. The Myola left Newcastle, New South Wales, on 1 April 1919 bound for Sydney. The load was 675 tons of coal. Captain Higgins replaced his usual crew, quarantined in Sydney after an epidemic of influenza. A thirty mile per hour south-easterly wind created heavy seas. When off Long Reef near Sydney, Myola was struck by a heavy wave. Water entered the engine room. At about 12:15 a.m., the ship suddenly lurched to starboard and it then came over to port and came to rest on its beam ends, with water over the well deck. Subsequently the ship floundered, sinking rapidly. Four miles behind, the steamer South Bulli observed distress flares and assisted picking up survivors. Four lives were lost. A subsequent Court of Marine Inquiry found that the foundering was caused by the coal cargo \\"shifting\\" and from an accumulation of water in the bilges. It was also critical of the second engineer for not starting the pumps earlier or informing superior officers of the situation. The Myola was one of three coastal steam colliers (or 'sixty-milers') to be lost, in the six-months from Dec 1918 to May 1919. The other two were the Undola and the Tuggerah. As a result, a Royal Commission was set up to inquire into the coastal coal carrying trade and the loss of the three ships. The Royal Commission's finding on the loss of the Myola, differed from that of the earlier inquiry. It rejected 'shifting coal' as the cause of the loss and found that the amount of water in the bilges was not significant. Relying upon the calculations of a naval architect and evidence that the Myola was up to 75-tons over its theoretical deadweight tonnage upon leaving Newcastle, the finding on the cause of the loss of the Myola was: \\"the Myola having had an amount of loose water in her [ballast] tanks on leaving Newcastle which reduced the righting levers considerably and rendered her unstable and eventually caused the loss. This theory meets the facts more consistently than any others which has been advanced.\\" The reason for there being free water in the ballast tanks was not known - the crew believed that the tanks were empty - but the Royal Commission was, in its own words, \\"forced to consider the possible neglect to keep filling valves screwed down when not in use as a possible cause of the disaster\\". Contemporary reports stated the Myola sunk off Sydney Heads. However, the wreck of the Myola was found in 1994, in 48 metres of water off Long Reef, lying on its port side. Damage to the propeller indicates that the engine was still running as the ship foundered, which is consistent with accounts given by the crew.

It is owned by the state of South Dakota and operated by Dakota Southern Railway. History The bridge was constructed in 1953 by the Chicago, Milwakuee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad to replace an earlier 1923 rail bridge that would have been submerged by the construction of dams on the Missouri River and subsequent creation of Lake Francis Case. The bridge uses sections from the older bridge, which are easily visible today. The bridge measures 4,890 feet (0.9 mi) long, which made it the longest bridge in the Chicago, Milwakuee, St. Paul and Pacfic Railroad. In 1980, the Milwakuee Road abandoned this line along with many others due to unprofitably and the looming corporate bankruptcy. The state of South Dakota bought the line, which included the bridge, from the Milwakuee Road. Until 1987, the line sat dormant. In 1987, the Dakota Southern Railway, headquartered in Chamberlain, took over operations of the line, and it has been operated by them ever since, In the 1990s and early 2000s, due to lack of customers and grain not being profitable, no trains passed on this bridge westbound.

The demonstration was in response to the March for Our Lives protest held on March 24, 2018. Background Will Riley, an 18-year-old high school senior from Carlsbad High School in Carlsbad, New Mexico, organized the event with the help of the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund. Riley stated in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, \\"I'm watching the news and I see they're saying, 'We have to do something about this. We have to enact some sort of gun control legislation because this is what the kids are asking for.' And I'm thinking, 'I'm not asking for that. I look at my friends and I think 'They're not asking for that.'\\" Riley wrote an op-ed for the Carlsbad Current-Argus on April 11, 2018, where he wrote about the walkout to garner interest. Protests The event's website stated \\"We have not ignored the huge movement of our peers against these fundamental human rights and liberties, but the American people must know not all of our generation shares in the shortsighted destruction of our Constitution.\\" The protests started at 10:00AM and lasted for 16 minutes, one minute less than the March for our Lives protest. The official website listed over 500 schools in 40 states across the U.S. participating in the event, but the Los Angeles Times wrote those numbers could not be independently verified. The Washington Times reported no celebrities endorsed or attended the event and it received much less media attention. Reactions Kyle Kashuv, a survivor of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, tweeted \\"I will not be walking out today. I don't believe it is the correct thing to do. Disrupting 1000s of classrooms around the country isn't the answer. There's a time and place for civil disobedience, I just don't believe that time is now. Instead, let's all #WalkUp!#FIXIT\\" Riley was commended for the protest by the Eddy County Sheriff Mark Cage on April 25, 2018. Riley was sworn in as an honorary sheriff's deputy for his efforts. It was the first time Cage had presented the honor.

He authorized the municipal police to perform almost constant surveillance of taverns, brothels, and gambling houses, keeping an eye out \\"for this sort of elements\\".

He is remembered for his interest in improving public education, having order numerous textbooks for the students in Ponce public schools. He was also able to repay old debts the municipal government was carrying over from previous administrations. His focus, though, was public education, to the point that maintenance of municipal streets and the development of public works suffered significantly. As a result, he was severely criticized by the press. He reacted by requesting a 4-month sick leave which was approved and he traveled to Spain for treatment. Teniente de alcalde (a sort of deputy mayor) Ermelindo Salazar, per the legal protocol in place at the time, filled in while Elices Montes was gone. Some time afterwards Elices Montes presented his resignation to the post of mayor from overseas.

Containing five silicon atoms arranged in a ring, it is the silicon analog of cyclopentane. Cyclopentasilane is a liquid oligosilane. It is of research interest because of its potential use as a liquid silicon ink for printing silicon structures on integrated circuits or solar cells. Production Cyclopentasilane can be made from diphenyldichlorosilane (C6H5)2SiCl2 reacting with lithium. This forms decaphenylcyclopentasilane. This reacts with aluminium chloride in benzene catalysed with hydrogen chloride to yield decachlorocyclopentasilane. Decachlorocyclopentasilane then has its chlorine replaced by hydrogen using lithium aluminium hydride. Properties Cyclopentasilane is pyrophoric. It has a œÉ-delocalization property. Cyclopentasilane is a liquid at standard conditions, but can be frozen to crystals at 173K. The monoclinic crystals are not isomorphic to cyclopentane. The silicon to silicon bond lengths in the solid vary from 2.3353 and 2.3377 √Ö, which is shorter than in the substituted cyclopentasilanes or linear silanes. In gas form, those bond lengths, as measured by electron diffraction, increased to 2.342 √Ö. Cyclopentasilane is sensitive, and starts decomposing when heated over 84¬∞C, when it loses hydrogen and polymerizes. As it is heated more silane is produced, and at 178¬∞C it yields disilane. When heated to over 250¬∞C it decomposes to a silicon hydrogen polymer. =Molecule shape= A five member ring can adopt a number of shapes: planar with all the atoms arranged in a pentagon with symmetry D5h; envelope symmetry Cs, with four atoms in a rectangular plane and one popped up like the flap, and twist with symmetry C2.

She was active as a political Polish agent in the court of Empress Maria Theresa in Vienna, where she was sent to influence the empress in favour of Poland. Biography She was the daughter of Heinrich von Br√ºhl, and married Jerzy August Mniszech, the owner of the Dukla estate. Carefully educated at great expense under the tutelage of Maria Josepha of Austria, she spoke six languages. From an early age, she participated in court intrigues in Warsaw at the court of Augustus III of Poland, as well as at the royal courts in Dresden and Paris, before eagerly being sent by her father to the court of Maria Theresa in Vienna. As a lady-in-waiting to Maria Teresa, she often tried to interest the empress in Polish affairs, and on 14 September 1750 she was awarded the Order of the Starry Cross. After the death of August III (1763), she left Saxony and divided her time between Dukla and Warsaw. In June 1764, while in Dukla the Mniszechs funded the construction of the Bernardine church. In 1769, during the Bar Confederation, Maria Amalia funded the construction of a stone chapel in the village of Trzciana at the site of the Hermitage of St. John of Dukla. On 13 February 1771, Maria Amalia Mniszech was accused of organizing, together with the Potocki family, the assassination of Gertruda Komorowska, the first wife of the then 18-year-old Stanis≈Çaw Szczƒôsny Potocki. Potocki had eloped with Komorowska, despite being betrothed to Maria Amalia's only daughter, J√≥zefina Amalia Mniszech. Maria Amalia died of tuberculosis at the age of 35 according to the family's official account. Suspicions abounded, however, that she had poisoned herself for fear of being sued by the Czartoryski family for the murder of Gertruda Komorowska. Two years after her death, her daughter J√≥zefina Amalia Mniszech married Stanis≈Çaw Szczƒôsny Potocki, finally fulfilling her wishes. She is buried in the Rococo St. Mary Magdalene Church in Dukla. In 1773, Jerzy Mniszech erected a Rococo tomb by Jan Obrocki of Lw√≥w in the chapel of the Dukla parish church of St. Mary Magdalene. The chapel is designed as a Rococo boudoir, her sarcophagus is carved from black and white marble and depicts the deceased in court dress, her head resting on one hand and a book in the other, as if she were dozing. Her epitaph was written by Rafa≈Ç Modlibowski. In Warsaw, in the church of St. Antoni Padewski on Senatorska Street also has the epitaph for the two wives of court marshal Jerzy Mniszech, including \\"Maria Amalia n√©e von Br√ºhl\\".[2] There's also a plaque commemorating Maria Amalia Mniszech in the Franciscan church in Sanok, as well as the Franciscan church in Biecz, St. John the Baptist Church in Kobylanka, and the St. Catherine of Alexandria Church in Ja≈õliska.

African Americans in San Antonio were poorly represented by the predominantly white state legislature and city council, and were politically disenfranchised during the Jim Crow era; whites had used a variety of tactics, including militias and legislation, to re-establish political and social supremacy throughout the South. Racial segregation ended in the mid-1960s. On March 16, 1960, San Antonio became the first southern city to begin integration of its small restaurants.

It is endemic to New Zealand. This species has been classified as Nationally Vulnerable by the Department of Conservation.  Taxonomy  This species was first described in 2010 by Brian Patrick and Robert J.B. Hoare. The type specimen was collected by Patrick at Fortrose Spit in Southland on 24 January 1990. The type specimen is held at the New Zealand Arthropod Collection. The species is named after Giacomo Casanova.  Description  N. casanova larvae start off life yellow-green in colour. As they mature they have an orange head and turn a pinkish colour. Adult moths of N. casanova are very similar in appearance to its close relation N. elegans. However N. casanova can be distinguished as it is normally smaller, has complete subterminal black band on the underside of its forewing, as well as a complete black line on its hindwing.  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand. Populations of N. casanova have been found at Fortrose Spit, Tiwai Peninsula and Three Sisters Sand Dune, all in Southland. A likely site also exists at Sandhill Point in Fiordland.  Life cycle and behaviour  The female lays her yellow eggs in groups on the flowers of the host plants or alternatively singly on leaves. Eggs hatch after 14 days and the larvae originally appear green-yellow. They spend approximately 87 days as larvae and then 12 days preparing to pupate. They pupate in a loose cocoon on the ground under their host. The species spends approximately 151 days in their cocoon before emerging as an adult. N. casanova are day flying moths. They are low but fast flyers and constantly vibrate their wings to enable them to take off rapidly. Habitat This species prefers either areas of coastal sand and pebbles or sand dunes.  Host species  The host plants for the larvae of N. casanova are the endemic plants Pimelea lyallii and Pimelea prostrata. Conservation status This moth is classified under the New Zealand Threat Classification system as being Nationally Vulnerable.

It was opened to the public on 8 March 2019. The station is integrated with the Khapri railway station, and is linked with Wardha Road via a subway that passes under the main railway line. The Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Limited (now the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited) awarded the contract to construct the station to Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (ILFS) in July 2016. Construction of the outer structure of the station was completed by November 2017, and interior work began in the same month. The station was awarded a platinum rating by the Indian Green Building Council, the highest rating the Council presents for sustainable construction practices that reduce environmental impact. Construction of the station was completed by January 2019. The station was originally proposed to be the southern terminus of the North-South Line. However, on 22 November 2017, Mahametro announced a 3 km southern extension to the line which added two new stations - Ecopark and Metro City - the latter becoming the southern terminus. Design The station's design was modeled on the Bandra suburban railway station in Mumbai, built in the Victorian style. Like Bandra station, Khapri station has a red roof covered by terracotta tiles, white-coloured steel trusses and a clock tower. Solar panels fitted on the station's roof supply around 65% of the total electricity required by the station. The station's interiors are adorned by paintings, sculptures and other art depicting the culture of Nagpur, Vidarbha, Maharashtra and India.

In \\"Sacramento\\" and \\"Easy To Solo Over\\", Bruford experiments with tuned percussion, similar to \\"Yoli Yoli\\", which appears on Fragmented. \\"An Entry of the Crims\\" is named after the band's entrance routine while touring in 1984, where each member would come out one by one and add contributions to an improvised piece. One such recording appears on Absent Lovers: Live in Montreal, although the studio version sounds similar to \\"Industrial Zone C\\", a bonus track on the 40th Anniversary Edition of Three of a Perfect Pair. On (and off) The Road includes a disc titled Are You Recording Gary? which is a recording of the band working in the studio edited down to 15 minutes. In it, the band records different takes of the combined arrangement of \\"Sleepless\\" and \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part III\\" from before they were split into two different songs during the sessions at Bearsville Studios, where Three of a Perfect Pair was completed.

Background In 1994, the National Basketball Association employed 54 referees. Each made between $72,000 and $177,000 a year, working about 70 to 75 games a year. The travel expenses for referees were to be reimbursed by the NBA once a travel report was submitted. The NBA paid for a first class airline ticket for flights lasting longer than two hours and a full fare coach seat on flights shorter than two hours. In turn, the referees were permitted to downgrade their first class tickets and pocket the cost difference. This was considered a fringe benefit of the position and a way to supplement their income. The NBA did not withhold taxes on this income or report it to the IRS and the referees did not declare this income on their tax returns considering it a fringe benefit provided by their employer. In 1989, the IRS introduced new regulations that required an arrangement like the fringe benefits supported by the NBA to be reported as income. However, during the introduction of these new regulations, the NBA and the referees association were locked in a bargaining period over a new contract. During the negotiations the NBA changed the rules frequently which resulted in an unclear process on how to report the income causing many referees to continue the fringe benefits as they had in the past. Investigation In 1993 the IRS received a tip that the referees were not declaring the airline ticket money as income resulting in the IRS launching \\"Operation Slam Dunk.\\" On September 12, 1994, the IRS announced its investigation and notified more than 50 referees that they were part of a criminal tax investigation. The estimates of cash received ranged from $8,000 to $100,000. Over the next four years, the cases grew and dragged on resulting in 25 referees being turned over to the IRS civil division to be audited. Although the amount of lost tax revenue did not reach the IRS guidelines for criminal prosecution, the United States Department of Justice still decided to indict 12 referees. Aftermath 11 of the 12 indicted referees in 1998 plead guilty with only Steve Javie taking the case to trial and successfully being acquitted. More referees would become involved with a total of 43 choosing to plea bargain. The only additional referee to take his case to trial would be Ken Mauer, later found guilty. All of the referees involved were forced to resign from the NBA but were subsequently rehired after their guilty pleas. =Notable consequences= Jesse Ray Kersey pled guilty in 1997 and was sentenced to three years probation, ordered to pay a $20,000 fine, and file accurate amended tax returns and pay all taxes, interest, and penalties owed. George T. Tolliver plead guilty to one count of filing a false tax return and was confined to six months of home detention, placed on probation for two years, ordered to completed 100 hours of community service and pay a $10,000 fine. Steve Javie was the only one to take his case to trial out of the original 12 indicted referees and was subsequently acquitted more than four years after the investigation began. Javie argued that he didn't owe taxes on more than $84,000 in income over three years because the money was value-earned from frequent flyer miles, which are non-taxable. The IRS case was cross examined and put under much scrutiny when asked why only part of the referees involved were indicted and questioning inconsistencies in arithmetic submitted as evidence by the IRS. Ken Mauer was the only referee to be found guilty when he refused to accept a plea bargain, Mauer was convicted of a felony, three counts of tax evasion and one count of obstruction of justice. He was confined to house arrest for five months, three years of supervised release, and 800 hours of community service. After the sentence Mauer remarked, \\"I'm not saying a mistake wasn't made. I'm not saying I've never made a mistake. But I never intended to commit a criminal act. I stood up for what I believe in. That is the only way I know how to live my life.\\" After the punishment was served, Mauer was reinstated as an NBA referee.

She was posthumously declared a Hero of the Soviet Union on 8 May 1965, over twenty years after death in the war.  Civilian life  Volkova was born on 24 June 1920 in Kharkiv to a white-collar family; her father was Russian and her mother Jewish. In 1936 her family moved to Konotop in Sumy, where she graduated from secondary school. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 Nadezhda was evacuated to Insary village in the Mordovian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. There she enrolled in nursing courses and began working in a nearby hospital until March 1942.  Partisan activities  Volkova left her job at the hospital in March to attend training at the Central School of Partisan Organizers in Moscow. After graduating from the school in the fall she was assigned to the Volchansk Forest Partisan Detachment, based in the Kharkov Oblast of Ukraine. She was appointed to work as the liaison officer for Aleksandr Shcherbak, the secretary of the detachment and regional Komsomol Committee. When the group parachuted into the forest of Starosaltovskiy, Shcherbak landed in a tree and broke his legs when he jumped out of the tree. He was given crutches but struggled to walk for the rest of his life. A Gestapo unit was headquartered in the district, resulting in a large police presence that made carrying out operations very difficult for the partisans. As the liaison officer Volkova was tasked with going on reconnaissance missions to gather information about enemy activities and transfer information across partisan units. She was also effective in recruiting new members to join the resistance, having spread leaflets across several villages and spoken to young people interested in joining the unit. While the Komsomol committee was intended primarily to develop resistance efforts and organize partisan detachments, committee members participated in sabotage and espionage against the Axis with the rest of the partisans; Volkova herself participated in many joint missions. When German authorities learned of the location of the underground partisan organization they surrounded a group of seventeen partisans with over one hundred Axis troops. Volkova refused to leave Shcherbak behind, and as he could not run on crutches they hid in a dugout while Volkova fired on the enemy with a submachine gun, buying time for most of the partisans to escape. When she was running low in ammunition she turned the gun on herself to avoid capture; Shcherbak also died in that battle and they were both buried in Vovchansk. On 8 May 1965 both she and Shcherbak were declared Hero of the Soviet Unions by decree of the Supreme Soviet.

In extreme cases, calotropin poisoning can cause respiratory and cardiac failure. Accidental poisoning is common in livestock who have ingested milkweed. Calotropin is commonly stored as a defense mechanism by insects that eat milkweeds as their main food source.  Chemistry  Calotropin is a toxic compound and is classified as a cardenolide-type cardiac glycoside. These molecules are related to steroids, and have a similar carbon backbone. Calotropin, like calactin, calotoxin, and uscharin, is based on calotropagenin, the precursor to these molecules. They have similar activity and are often found together in plants of the genus Calotropis. Biosynthesis of digitoxigenin = Biosynthesis = It is thought that the biosynthesis of calotropin is similar to that of digitoxin, another cardenolide. Digitoxin is more established as a medicine for cardiac insufficiency, and therefore the biosynthesis has been further studied. However, it is believed that many cardenolides are synthesized in plants by a similar process, but this process is not yet well understood. The sterol precursor for this process is similar to precursors for steroidal alkaloids. Two suggested pathways, the pregnane pathway and norcholanic acid pathway are possible for the conversion of the sterol precursor to digitoxigenin, the precursor to digitoxin. Both the pregnane and norcholanic acid pathways use progesterone 5Œ≤-reductases, the P5Œ≤R and P5Œ≤R2 respectively. In the pregnane pathway, a plant analog of the mitochondrial cytochrome P450 (CYP11A in humans), is thought to catalyze the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone. Progesterone is further processed by P5Œ≤R to 5Œ≤-Pregnane-3,20-dione, and then to digitoxigenin. Less is known about the norcholanic acid pathway. At this point the similarities between digitoxin and calotropin end. Calotropogenin may be produced by the same process as digitoxigenin, however the mechanism for production of calotropin and digitoxin from these genins diverges. It is not well studied how calotropin is produced from its calotropogenin precursor.  Toxicity  Sodium-potassium pump = Mechanism of action = Cardenolides such as calotropin inhibit the sodium-potassium pump, Na+/K+-ATPase. This enzyme is responsible for active transport of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane. This process also helps to regulate the resting potential and cell volume. Inhibition of this enzyme in cardiac tissue is proposed as the receptor for calotropin and cardiac glycosides in general, and this is responsible for the toxic effects. Inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase causes an increase of sodium inside the cell, and by the action of the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) also raises the calcium concentration. Calotropin has a more noticeable effect on the myocardium than it does on skeletal muscles, as these cells have more active NCX proteins. This can allow for higher cardiac output by the cardiac muscles, but can also lead to arrhythmia, which is aggravated by the charge buildup that develops when Na+/K+-ATPase is inhibited. = Symptoms and bioactivity = Poisoning can cause a variety of unpleasant symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhoea, muscle tremors, seizures, and death. Death can be caused by hemorrhages in the lungs, respiratory failure, or cardiac failure. Symptoms can begin as early as two hours after ingestion, and may persist for hours or days. Ingestion is not always lethal, and plants in the genus Calotropis have long been used as a folk remedy in India.Upadhyay RK. Ethnomedicinal, pharmaceutical and pesticidal uses of Calotropis procera (Aiton) (Family: Asclepiadaceae). Int J Green Pharm 2014;8:135-46.  Natural sources  milkweed leaves = Plants = Calotropin is primarily generated by plants in the Asclepiadoideae family, and can be obtained or isolated from plant extracts of Calotropis gigantea and Calotropis procera. Asclepiadoideae plants are commonly regarded as poisonous, and are common around the world. Calotropin is found in the latex, leaves, and root bark. Ingestion of these plants is toxic to mammals, and can be life- threatening. = Insects = Monarch butterflies are one of many insects that feed on milkweed plants. These butterflies feed on the North American milkweed (Asclepias) plants. These milkweeds are related to the Indian and North African milkweeds (Calotropis), which are consumed by the North African grasshopper Poekilocerus bufonis. These insects have adapted to the toxicity of the milkweed, are capable of safely sequestering cardenolides from the milkweed in glands or tissues during their early stages of development. The insects primarily retain calotropin and calactin (a configurational isomer), even though other cardenolides exist in the plant latex and leaves. These poisons, while not harmful to the insect, make it unpalatable to birds and mammals, and therefore serve as a defense mechanism. Monarch butterflies also store several volatile pyrazines, which give off an odor, which is a warning signal to predators to avoid the insect. P. bufonis is capable of utilizing calotropin in its defensive spray.

In the fall of 2017, David and his work as a whistle-blower and China expert were the focus of the documentary film The China Hustle, which depicts how fraudulent Chinese companies stole billions of dollars from U.S. investors and retirees.  Education and early career  David Attended Northern Michigan University and the Aresty Institute of Executive Education at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Before founding Wolfpack Research and other investment firms, David worked as a senior executive in the retail industry, including senior level positions at Finlay Enterprises, Midwest Famous Barr and Lord and Taylor.  Investment career and activism  David, who works in Skippack, PA and an office in Manhattan, has been credited with uncovering fraud in US-listed Chinese companies. David later lobbied Congress to change federal laws regarding the listing of China-based firms on U.S. stock exchanges. He frequently appears in the business news media including on CNBC, Yahoo! Finance and Fox Business Network. On forming Wolfpack Research, David is quoted as saying: ‚ÄúWith markets hovering at all-time highs, there's a desperate need for more skeptical research and critical voices to balance our financial ecosystem. Our team digs deep and asks the tough questions, and when we find wrongdoing at companies, we will howl as loudly as we can from the tallest mountain.‚Äù  2018 Congressional campaign  In January 2018, David announced he would be entering the Republican primary to represent Pennsylvania‚Äôs newly formed 4th Congressional District, which includes Montgomery and Berks Counties.

The Parish is on the Darling River upstream of Wilcannia, New South Wales and is located at 30¬∞55‚Ä≤11‚Ä≥S 144¬∞33‚Ä≤51‚Ä≥E. The only town of the parish is Tilpa, New South Wales. Geography New bridge over the Darling River at tilpa, low river, with the old hand-operated ferry on the river bank, on right. The topography of Wallandra Parish is flat with a K√∂ppen climate classification of BsK (Hot semi arid). (direct: Final Revised Paper) Tilpa is a 120 km downstream from Louth, New South Wales and 250km upstream of Wilcannia. The parish has a number of billabongs. Economy The economy in the parish is mainly an agricultural area, with sheep grazing the primary activity, and some pockets of irrigated land along the river. Tourism, including farmstay programs on local stations, is the other major local industry. Fishing and camping are popular along the river. The prolonged drought in 2007 saw Tilpa run out of potable water. A Sydney-based company has offered to trial a portable water filtration plant to improve the quality of both the river and bore water. History The traditional owners of the area are the Barkindji people.Norman Tindale's Catalogue of Australian Aboriginal TribesAboriginal Australia Map, David Horton (ed.), 1994 published in The Encyclopedia of Aboriginal Australia by AIATSIS. In 1835, explorer Major Thomas Mitchell was the first European to the region, in which he traced the Darling River to what is now Menindee. In its heyday, the town of Tilpa was an important river port with paddle steamers delivering supplies to nearby sheep stations and returning down river laden with bales of wool. At Tilpa a punt, allowing sheep, horses and people to cross the Darling River safely, for a fee. was replaced by a bridge in 1963.

It was introduced in 2018 with deliveries expected to start at the end of that year. A planned production of only 70 cars is intended, in honour of the company's 70 year heritage in racing.  Specifications  300px The BT62 is powered by a mid-mounted 5.4-litre naturally-aspirated V8 engine that is based on the Ford V8 modular engine architecture of American manufacturer Ford Motor Company. https://www.whichcar.com.au/news/brabham-bt62-what-we-know-about-its-v8-engine https://drivetribe.com/p/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-fOrXSDSFTnuDn- hsQti8sg?iid=PznToAhgRAu7IslWmMp3zg The engine has been extensively modified and has a power output of at 7,400 rpm and of torque at 6,200 rpm, giving the car a power-to-weight ratio of 653 hp per ton. Power goes to the rear wheels through a six-speed Holinger sequential-shift racing transmission controlled by steering wheel mounted paddle shifters, and stopping is handled by carbon- to-carbon disc brakes, with carbon pads actuated by six pistons acting on carbon rotors. The chassis of the BT62 uses what Brabham calls a ‚Äòtubular metallic architecture‚Äô and the body features lightweight carbon fibre body panels, as well as carbon-kevlar wheel housings, to give the car a dry weight of . The car has a full fixed aero package as an option that includes a front splitter, rear diffuser and large rear wing, that are all made from carbon fibre and together are capable of producing of downforce. The suspension uses a double wishbone setup in the front and rear and features pushrod actuated four-way adjustable √ñhlins dampers and adjustable anti-roll bars. The wheels are 18 inch centre locking units and are wrapped in Michelin racing slicks. The interior is relatively sparse as the BT62 is built for track day driving and features FIA-spec carbon fibre seat shells, a six-point harness, Alcantara trim, leather door pulls, an adjustable pedal box, a carbon fibre dashboard, a 12-inch digital gauge cluster, a removable carbon fibre steering wheel and a fire extinguisher.  Production  Brabham intends to produce 70 cars to celebrate the 70 years since the company founder Sir Jack Brabham launched his racing career in Australia in 1948. The first 35 cars will be finished in the corresponding liveries of Brabham's 35 Grand Prix winning cars, while the rest will be finished to the owner's specifications. The BT62 has a retail price of around US$1.4 million (around GB¬£1 million at current exchange rates). The price includes admission into the Brabham driver development programme, which offers personalised driver coaching sessions to help the owners make the most of their cars on the track.  Road-legal conversion  Although the BT62 in its standard form is not road-legal, Brabham offers a road legal conversion to its customers with the conversion and registration process being carried out in the U.K. after going through an IVA (Independent Vehicle Assessment). International buyers will supposedly still be able to carry out the procedure and be able to drive the car in other countries by having the car shipped back to the U.K. once every 12 months to Brabham for an annual service in order to comply with the registration laws. The shipping costs of the car would reportedly be borne by the company for every visit.  Motorsport  Will Powell driving the Brabham BT62 at Brands Hatch. The BT62 made its racing debut in the infamous 'Into the Night' race at Brands Hatch, competing in the 2019 Britcar Endurance Championship on the 9th and 10 November. On the 21st of October, it was announced that David Brabham and Will Powell will pilot the car in the races. The car started from pole position in the first race and eventually won its first ever race outing. In the next race, on Sunday, Will Powell lead the field away before a safety car came out. The BT62 pitted with an alternator problem, he rejoined the race initially but the car eventually retired, only completing 17 laps. The new BT62 Competition will run in the 2020 Britcar Endurance Championship driven by reigning champion Paul Bailey, alongside British GT4 and Britcar champion Ross Wylie, who is also Brabham Automotive's development driver. This will be the first customer-purchased BT62 to race in motorsport. BrabhamBT62ingarage1.jpgThe front of the BT62 in the garage. BrabhamBT62ingarage2.jpgThe rear of the BT62 in the garage.

The group made mostly atmospheric, psychdelic-noise songs and was regarded for its distinctive style in the Tokyo psychedelic music scene. The band produced four albums in its eighteen years of existence, and generally remained undocumented and unknown. Shizuka started out as a solo musical project by Shizuka Miura (vocals and guitar), but soon she formed a duo with Maki Miura (lead guitar). Afterward, the band Shizuka was formed with the joining of Jun Kosugi (drums) and Tomoya Hirata (bass), who was later replaced with Tetsuya \\"Seven\\" Mugishima (bass). Throughout its history, the band had many lineup changes but Shizuka and Maki remained together until Shizuka died in early 2010. Shizuka's musical style was characterized by variations of psychedelic music, acid rock, folk music, free improvisation, and noise rock, some of which were influences from the underground rock scene in Japan. Maki Miura, who was once a member of Les Rallizes D√©nud√©s and Fushitsusha, played a major role in the band's sound as the lead guitarist. Shizuka Miura was the sole singer; her vocals are often ethereal, reverberated, slow and tremulous, characteristics that connoted sadness and a \\"haunting, gothic atmosphere\\". Of Shizuka's four albums, (1994) was their debut and only studio album. The other three were live albums: Live Shizuka (1995); Tokyo Underground 20, Jul '95 (2000); and (2008). They also had some video albums released such as in 2009, and in 2010. The latter is a visual tribute to Shizuka Miura, which contains one of the last live performances by her group recorded at the live venue ShowBoat in Tokyo on 30 December 2008.  History  = 1992‚Äì1994: Early years = In an interview from 2001, Shizuka Miura claimed that, before forming the band, she \\"used to write poetry\\" and had accumulated a number of lyrics, but she \\"didn't know how to compose music at the time\\". In the same interview, Maki Miura, a former guitarist of Les Rallizes D√©nud√©s and Fushitsusha, said that Shizuka saw him writing songs and that she gradually learned how to compose music. \\"In about 1992\\", Shizuka started creating music and composed three songs: , , and . Later on, she staged three live performances, which included \\"renting venues, singing, playing, etc\\"; all this was \\"done by Shizuka alone\\". The third time she performed, Maki was invited to attend the concert and had positive impressions of her presentation. Afterward, Shizuka and Maki formed a musical duo together. Around 1993, Fushitsusha drummer Jun Kosugi joined them. In circa September 1993, the trio appeared in the Tokyo Flashback 3, a various artists compilation album released by PSF Records, with the song . Also in about that year, bassist Tomoya Hirata joined the group. The earliest known appearance of him with Shizuka, Maki, and Jun was at live venue Manda-La2 in Tokyo on 8 November 1993. On 12 August 1994, they played at Japan's Studio AMS. These two Shizuka live performances were recorded on the Hi8 videocassette format, which was remastered by music producer Tetsuya Tanaka and reissued on the DVD-Video format by the label Fra, Inc. in Japan in December 2009, titled Hikyoku no Seiseki: Live at Manda-La2 1993 & Studio Ams 1994. = 1994: Heavenly Persona = On 22 November 1994, Shizuka's debut and only studio album, , was released in Japan by PSF Records. It has seven tracks, with a total length of 46 minutes. The album opens with a harsh-noise psychedelic jam led by Maki Miura's distorted guitar, but soon after the album introduces the atmospheric, traditional folk style of the band guided by Shizuka's chant-inspired, plaintive vocals, and Maki's \\"gently plucked guitar\\". Heavenly Persona features piano by Ichirou Nagahara and cello by Takeharu Hayakawa that enhance the overall sound produced by the \\"simplistic arrangements of guitar and voice\\". This release also presents Shizuka's characteristic music contrast on the initially serene, melancholic melodies that develop to a crescendo led by Maki's psychedelic solos. Mason Jones, reviewing the Heavenly Persona, notes that Shizuka's vocals can be perceived as \\"not quite perfect\\", but that \\"its imperfections perhaps add an emotional edge which an overly-polished voice would eliminate\\". Describing the album, Steven Lowenthal and Peter Kolovos wrote on NPR that Heavenly Persona \\"features some of the most straightforward‚Äîyet equally magical‚Äîmusic within the PSF catalog\\". Heavenly Persona's concept was made by Shizuka Miura and dedicated to Japanese dollmaker . = 1995: Live Shizuka and miscellaneous appearance = In 1995, Live Shizuka, Shizuka's first live album, was released in the United States by New Yorker record label Persona Non Grata. On this album's booklet, Shizuka Miura was credited for the vocals and electric guitar, Maki Miura for the electric guitar and for his musical assistance, Jun Kosugi for the drums, Tomoya Hirata for the bass guitar, and Amano Onkyo Giken for the recording engineering. Also in 1995, the band Shizuka appeared in the compilation album of various artists Tokyo Flashback 4, released by PSF Records. It was the album's sixth track, . In the music production of this song, \\"the arrangement was completed in the first take\\", contrasting the band's usual creative process, which was to \\"listen to Shizuka and sing the songs\\", and then \\"spend some time thinking how to arrange the song\\". For this piece, Shizuka Miura said she used some texts from the Japanese epic poem Hotsuma Tsutae as lyrics to \\"complete the song\\". = 1995‚Äì1997: Lineup changes, American tour, and hiatus = Maki Miura said Shizuka's first bass player \\"couldn't keep up with\\" the band members' pace, having Maki himself to write the songs bass lines. He also told it became a major problem for the band, since its members were \\"used to completing the arrangement in the [recording] studio\\". Sometime after the release of Heavenly Persona in November 1994, singer Shizuka, Maki and Jun met Japanese musician Tetsuya Mugishima, also known by his pseudonyms \\"Seven\\" and \\"SevenZ\\". Tetsuya \\"Seven\\" Mugishima, as a musician, originally was a guitarist, but, according to Maki, \\"when he was a bass player, he was very competent and able to write a very beautiful bass line\\". Shizuka's members invited Seven to join the band as its bassist. In 1995, the music group Shizuka was \\"formally established\\", with singer and guitarist Shizuka Miura, lead guitarist Maki Miura, drummer Jun Kosugi and bassist Seven. In 1995, with Seven, the band did three live performances in Japan. One was at live venue ShowBoat in Tokyo's K≈çenjikita district on 20 July 1995. Another was at live venue Namba Bears in City of Osaka on 10 September 1995. Both performances were recorded and later released on the CD format, in 2000 and 2008, respectively. After these three live shows, Seven left Shizuka. Afterward, Jun Kosugi also left the band. Maki Miura said both left the group for \\"personal reasons\\". After that, a number of lineup changes followed. Sometime between 1995 and 1997, American software engineer and musician Mason Jones organized a tour in the United States for the band. There were shows in San Francisco and Los Angeles. They went twice to a local radio station, one of which was a live performance. Shizuka Miura said that \\"there were many [Shizuka] fans in San Francisco\\". Known members who participated in this tour were Shizuka Miura and Maki Miura, both of them told having positive experiences with the audience in the . On 15 July 1996, Shizuka had its song , which was taken from Shizuka's album Heavenly Persona, released in the United Kingdom in the compilation album Tokyo Invasion! Volume 1: Cosmic Kurushi Monsters by Virgin Records. On 22 April 1997, Shizuka's song was released in the compilation album Land of the Rising Noise, 2 in the United States by independent record label Charnel Music, owned by Mason Jones. The cover art of this various artists album features a doll made by Shizuka Miura. In about 1997, with \\"a tendency to slow down\\" after Seven and Jun Kosugi left the band, the group disbanded or had a hiatus. Maki Miura said that although they \\"changed the membership several times, [I/we] always felt that the original members were the best, so [I/we was/were] waiting for them to come back\\". = 2000‚Äì2002: Reunition, Tokyo Underground '95, and the Le Weekend festival = In 2000, the group reunited with the same previous members: Shizuka, Maki, Jun, and Seven. In that year, they released a Shizuka live album which was recorded in 1995 during a 40-minute performance in a Tokyo nightclub, titled Tokyo Underground 20, Jul '95, which was published in the United States by the American label Last Visible Dog. As Shizuka's previous albums, Tokyo Underground '95 maintains the band's melancholic and contrasting music style, with Shizuka's chant vocals, and Maki's psychedelic guitar solos. Nevertheless, this album has some different characteristics in relation to other Shizuka releases: it starts with a 1-minute recording of a previous live PA; and, as described by Eclipse Records, the \\"disc gives off a slightly different 'in a nightclub' aura to Shizuka's zoned-out balladry\\". In circa October or November 2001, the band was invited by The Wire magazine to play at the Le Weekend festival, in Stirling, Scotland. In this way, Shizuka was scheduled to play at 19:30 on 25 April 2002 at the Tolbooth, a music venue that had just restarted its activities following a ¬£6m refurbishment. As the date approached, Shizuka Miura, Maki Miura, Jun Kosugi, and Kazuhide Yamaji flew their way to the United Kingdom. When they arrived at the London airport, Maki had stomach related health issues and was hospitalized in an emergency department at the airport. Shizuka members also faced challenges immigration wise to get into Scotland as they were suspected to be other than musicians who would perform at the Le Weekend. Nevertheless, the band made it to the Tolbooth \\"with a last-minute appearance\\", and become the first artist to perform in the 2002 edition of that festival. Gavin Laird, bassist and vocalist of Telstar Ponies, documented the experience on the band‚Äôs website and wrote about Shizuka challenges and performance. The Tolbooth, a venue of art and music in Stirling, Scotland. = 2008: Traditional Aesthetics = On 25 April 2008, a Shizuka live performance recording from September 1995 at Namba Bears was released in Japan by PSF Records: the live album . As characteristics of Shizuka's musical style, the songs in Traditional Aesthetics are simple, going from a slow rhythm guided by Shizuka's plaintive and chant-styled, and out of tune, vocals to crescendos featuring Maki's psychedelic guitar solos. Some themes of this album are elegies, negative emotions or subjects like loneliness and hell, and nature elements. Members in this recording are Shizuka (vocals and guitar), Maki (lead guitar), Jun (drums), and Seven (bass). = 2008‚Äì2010: Shizuka Miura's death‚Äîthe end of Shizuka = On circa 30 January 2010, Shizuka Miura died, marking the end of her group. As a tribute to Shizuka, a concert of the band performing at ShowBoat in December 2008 was released on the DVD-video format by PSF Records on 25 April 2010: . Describing the album, the PSF website published: Members in Owari no Nai Yume are Shizuka (vocals, guitar), Maki (lead guitar), Kazuhide Yamaji (bass), and Katsumi Honjo (drums). = Posthumous releases = On 24 May 2017, a live recording from March 2009 at Kameido Hardcore of the song was included on a various artists compilation, Tokyo Flashback: P.S.F. ‚Äî Psychedelic Speed Freaks, by Super Fuji Discs; the compilation was also later reissued by Black Editions records in 2019. In early 2018, it was announced that the American label Black Editions will reissue a remastered version of Heavenly Persona. On the Bandcamp Daily, it was said that the audio engineer Kris Lapke was \\"enlisted to remaster\\" the reissue. Since 2019, a new Shizuka live album, titled , has been announced to be released by the French label An‚Äôarchives. This pre-announced album, to be released on the double-sided vinyl format, has a total of 8 tracks taken from a previously unreleased live recording in 2001.  Musical Style  Shizuka's musical style features simple arrangements, going from serene and melancholic traditional folk to the Japanese psychedelic harsh noise‚Äîa characteristic music contrast present in their recordings which commonly is developed trough crescendos. It is led primarily by Shizuka's vocals and Maki's guitar: Shizuka's vocals are chant-styled, slow and plaintive‚Äîoften connoting sadness; Maki's guitar is characterized both by a simple, \\"gently plucked guitar\\" and by emotive psychedelic-noise solos, as influences from acts like Fushitsuha and Les Rallizes D√©nud√©s. Shizuka's music style has notably been described as distinctive, from both the overall \\"spacey ambiance\\" and Shizuka's haunting, madrigal-resembling vocals, suggesting a \\"gothic atmosphere\\". Mason Jones noted that Shizuka's vocals can be perceived as \\"not quite perfect\\", and Bill Meyer described it as \\"tunelessness\\"; however, Jones also wrote that \\"its imperfections perhaps add an emotional edge which an overly-polished voice would eliminate\\", and Meyer also correlates writing that Shizuka's vocals are \\"possessed of the same monomaniacal insistence on her own emotional dislocation as Nico\\".
