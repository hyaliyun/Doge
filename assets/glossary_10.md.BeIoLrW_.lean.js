Life Burwell was born on October 22, 1839, in Hillsborough, North Carolina. His parents were Rev. Robert Burwell, the Presbyterian pastor there and Margaret Anna (Robertson) Burwell. His parents moved to Charlotte in 1857 and founded the Charlotte Female Institute that year, which is now Queens University of Charlotte. After graduating from Davidson College in 1859 he taught school. Teaching in Princeton, Arkansas at the start of the Civil War, he served as adjutant in Company A of the 3rd Arkansas Cavalry, reached the rank of Captain. His unit saw action in Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Georgia where he was severely wounded on July 28, 1864, while his unit was defending Atlanta. He became the assistant adjutant general to Brigadier General F.C. Armstrong. At war's end, Burwell returned to North Carolina and resumed teaching school in Charlotte. He also studied law and became licensed to practice in 1869. He entered law partnerships with Calvin E. Grier and then Zebulon Baird Vance, a former Confederate officer and North Carolina governor during the Confederacy, and future United States senator, in a firm named Vance & Burwell. In 1877, he was appointed as a director of the state-owned North Carolina Railroad. From 1880 to 1900, Burwell was in a law partnership with Platt D. Walker, who also became an Associate Justice (1903‚Äì1923) but served after Burwell left the court. This firm was initially Burwell & Walker, then Burwell, Walker & Cansler. Later in 1880, Burwell was elected from the 29th Senate District to represent Mecklenburg County in the North Carolina Senate of the 84th General Assembly that met in 1881. He also served as city attorney and county attorney, and dean of the Charlotte bar association. Two days after the November 14, 1892, death of North Carolina Supreme Court Chief Justice Augustus Merrimon, the court elected James E. Shepherd to be the new Chief Justice and Governor Thomas Holt appointed Burwell to fill Shepard's associate justice seat for the remaining three years of an eight-year term. In the General Election of 1894, Burwell failed to win reelection and left the court on January 1, 1895, returning to his private law practice in Charlotte. Since 1868, the state constitution called for the election of justices by the people. Personal Burwell married Ella Maude Jenkins in 1869; they had six known children, three dying in infancy. The others were daughters Ella Maude, Frances Armistead, and son Armistead Burwell, Jr. His wife predeceased him in 1907. He died May 13, 1913, and was buried in the Elmwood Cemetery in Charlotte.

Background Well known militant and socialist as well as suspected dynamitist, Thomas Mooney, was tried and convicted in 1916 for the Preparedness Day Bombing in San Francisco, which led to the death of ten and injury of forty more. His trial, it seemed, was nothing more than a show with coached witnesses and the air of a lynch mob. While the American Socialist Party was at first ready to expel him, his local branch stood by him and he began to gain the support of an increasingly agitated domestic and international left wing community, which only further radicalized with the introduction of the draft. So much so that Woodrow Wilson felt compelled to start a letter writing campaign to the Governor of California William Stephens to commute Mooney's death sentence. Stephens seemed to have missed his chance when in November 1917, the San Francisco Call ran an expos√© suggesting Mooney was framed by prosecutors, basing its findings on a federal investigation conducted under Wilson's orders. (The allegations later gained even more veracity: the prosecution‚Äôs case was riddled with perjury, corruption, suppression of evidence, conflict of interest, and other irregularities ignored by prosecutors.) In the meantime, efforts to recall local District Attorney Charles Fickert, who spearheaded the effort to prosecute Mooney, grew more and more promising with each passing day. Bombing At 11:55 p.m. on December 17, 1917, the Governor and his wife Flora awoke to what they described as a \\"nervous shock\\". While no one was injured, including all of the servants, windows were shattered as far as two to three blocks away. When the police arrived, they found Governor Stephens, with little care, wading through the wet, muddy basement in search of a clue as to how the bomb had been placed. While neither he nor his guard had seen the perpetrator nor the act first hand, they both expressed the belief that the bomb had been thrown from an alley running about 40 feet from the rear of the house. As for the motive, Stephens was convinced of it \\"probably having been done with a view to terrorism, the chief weapon of the alien enemy,\\" a justifiable claim at the time given his recent series of addresses in Southern California urging support for the war. Accounts of one to two men seen fleeing the scene as crowds began to gather were recorded, but none were found despite an extensive search of downtown. Aftermath Men outside IWW Local No. 71 Almost immediately, the Sacramento Chief of Police and most newspapers blamed the Industrial Workers of the World. On Christmas Eve, two members of the IWW were arrested after police claimed they'd picked up dynamite at the union's headquarters in Sacramento. Three days later, the Governor received a letter giving him an ultimatum: $50,000 or nine bombs will be set off across the city. While nothing came of the letter, police raided locals across Northern California and a further 51 union workers were arrested and thrown in jail in January 1918, where 5 died (four to the influenza epidemic and one to tuberculosis) A further 46 were charged with conspiracy to violate the Espionage Act in spite of protests from a local Department of Justice agent. His concerns regarding the prosecution's motives fell on deaf ears in large part because Governor Stephens, Assistant Attorney General Raymond General, the President of the Sacramento Chamber of Commerce and the publisher of the Sacramento Bee all pushed hard for charges and a conviction. Their efforts succeeded and in January 1919, a jury took one hour to convict all 46. All but three were sentenced from 1 to 10 years. The exceptions included two who had access to attorneys and received 2 month sentences as well as the one woman who received a fine. In total, 2,000 Wobblies (IWW members) were arrested between 1917 and 1918 for \\"anarchism\\" or \\"anti-war efforts\\". Weeks after the trial of the 46 IWW members, the California Criminal Syndicalism Act was signed into law, making it a felony, punishable by 1 to 14 years in prison, to advocate \\"violence or sabotage\\" as a means of bringing about \\"a change in industrial ownership or control, or affecting any political change.\\" The statute was used to broadly intimidate political opponents from speaking out and was ruled unconstitutional almost 50 years later. This harsh crackdown on labor and the months long anti-union campaigning by the Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Association led many progressives to voice their suspicion. The District Attorney's election had taken place the day after the bombing after all, and the heavy press coverage surely would have helped him. What's more: the bomber didn't seem intent to injure. With all this in mind, a San Francisco reporter on the beat learned that the mansion's guard may have worked with a prominent detective to set up the whole thing. That detective, Martin Swanson, had in fact attempted to set up Mooney in a similar fashion years earlier.Walton, 2015. p. 109-110 References 1917 in California Labor disputes in California Labor disputes in the United States History of the Industrial Workers of the World Political violence in the United States History of the United States (1865‚Äì1918) December 1917 events ","title":"1917 Sacramento Governor's Mansion bombing"},{"id":"53398442","text":"Melloina is a genus of baldlegged spiders that was first described by Paolo Marcello Brignoli in 1985. it contains only three species, found only in Panama and Venezuela: M. gracilis, M. rickwesti, and M. santuario.

Design According to the diary of British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, who toured the facility in 1959, Orange One can house a staff of 200 persons in two separate wings and is a \\"fortress ... hewn out of the rock\\". Bill Gulley has said Orange One can be reached by an elevator from Aspen Lodge, the president's quarters at Camp David, and that part of Orange One extends underneath the Aspen Lodge swimming pool. Gulley noted that, as of the mid 1970s, Orange One was no longer considered a primary command and control facility as its communications systems had not, at that time, been improved and it had not been updated to withstand attack by certain categories of weapons. History Orange One was first visited by a sitting president in the 1950s when Dwight D. Eisenhower inspected the facility while leading the exercise Operation Alert. In April 1961, then-former president Eisenhower returned to Camp David for consultations with John F. Kennedy on the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. According to former Associated Press reporter Dale Nelson, Kennedy inspected Orange One following Eisenhower's departure before helicoptering to his private estate, Glen Ora, in Middleburg, Virginia. The existence of Orange One came to public light in the 1970s, during the Watergate scandal, after it was revealed that Richard Nixon's choice of location for an outdoor swimming pool at Aspen Lodge sat over a portion of the subterranean Orange One.

The egg seller Huybrecht Beuckeleer likely studied initially with his father. He is presumed to have trained also in the workshop of his uncle Pieter Aertsen. By the early 1560s, Aertsen had left for Amsterdam. Huybrecht 's brother Joachim operated at that time a successful workshop in which he produced kitchen and market scenes. There is uncertainty about the role of Huybrecht in his brother's workshop. However it is clear that the brothers' early works were heavily influenced by Aertsen in style as well as subject matter.Huybrecht Beuckelaer, The first Passover feast at Sotheby's It is known that the artist collaborated with Antonis Mor for day wages just like his brother. There is evidence of extensive travel in the period 1567‚Äì68. Huybrecht was mentioned in Antwerp in January 1567. Not long thereafter he was said to be 'travelling in various foreign countries in order to see the land and learn the language, and to practise his trade as a painter and thus earn his living'. It has been suggested on stylistic grounds that he may have trained in Bronzino's workshop in Florence as early as the mid-1550s. There is no documentary evidence to support this hypothesis. In September 1568 Huybrecht Beuckeleer had returned to Antwerp where he married a woman with whom he had a son. His wife was recorded as deceased in April 1569. He inherited a rent on a house from her. In 1574 there is a record of him sending from Bordeaux a letter to the mother of his first wife telling her that he is faring better there than in Antwerp. He was back in Antwerp in October 1577 when he sold the rent he had inherited from his first wife. He married a second time in 1577. His second wife was Susanna Key; the daughter of the painter Willem Key who had already died by that time. He became an independent master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke only in 1579. The artist was last mentioned in Antwerp in 1585. It is believed that around this time, which coincides with the Fall of Antwerp, he moved to England. Here he was likely active as a portrait artist. He probably worked for The Earl of Leicester. He was mentioned in a list of names of people from the Low Countries, probably from 1586. In the list he is referred to as \\"Hubert B√ºcheler (or Hubert Bucheler) in Greenwich\\". The Earl of Leicester who was possibly his last patron died in 1605. A picture maker by the name of Daniel Buckler mentioned in a list of foreign artists as having died in London in 1625 is believed to have been his son.Early Modern British Painters, c.1500-1640 Work =Rediscovery= The first Passover feast The art historian Johannes Sievers had identified a small group of works with certain stylistic idiosyncrasies and classified them under the notname the Monogrammist HB in 1911 (J. Sievers, Joachim Bueckeleer, in: Jahrbuch der preu√üischen Kunstsammlungen, 32, 1911, pp. 210‚Äì212).Huybrecht Bueckeleer, The Holy Family with Saint Anne at Dorotheum The work and artistic personality of the artist given this notname were first defined in 1976 by the art historian Detlev Kreidl in his analysis of the Prodigal Son Feasting with harlots (the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels) and The kitchen maid and her helpers (in the same museum). The two works had been attributed over the years to both Joachim Beuckelaer and Aertsen.Detlev Kreidl, Joachim Beuckelaer und der Monogrammist HB, in: Oud Holland, Vol. 90, No. 3 (1976), published by Brill, pp. 162-183 The two paintings were found to bear the monogram HB and in 1997 infra-red reflectography conducted on The kitchen maid and her helpers revealed the signature 'Beuckler' and a date of 1570 or 1676 next to the already familiar monogram HB. Based on this discovery Kreidl was able to identify the 'Monogrammist HB' as Huybrecht Beuckeleer. The first Passover feast (Sotheby's New York sale, 26 January 2012, lot 105) is another painting previously attributed to Joachim that was reattributed to Huybrecht. Only about half a dozen paintings have been attributed to Huybrecht Beuckeleer. His small output is likely attributable to the fact that he worked for others or in the workshop of other artists. Only a few of his works are clearly dated:The first Passover feast (Sotheby's New York sale, 26 January 2012, lot 105) and The Holy Family with Saint Anne (sale Dorotheum, Vienna, 19 April 2016, lot 34) are both dated 1563. The kitchen maid and her helpers has a date of either 1570 or 1576. The subject matter of Huybrecht is similar to that of his brother Joachim and Aertsen and includes kitchen and market scenes as well as some religious compositions and portraits. A still life has also been attributed to the artist. =Style characteristics= Sievers had in 1911 already identified the main differences between the works of Huybrecht (whom he knew as the Monogrammist HB) and his brother Joachim. The distinctive traits identified by Sievers point to a greater realism and naturalness in Huybrecht's work when compared to that of his brother. Sievers found Huybrecht's treatment of the human body to display a higher degree of three- dimensionality and detail and his figures to be more individualized in the treatment of the head. Huybrecht further adopted a freer treatment of certain details such as the hair and beards. His figures are placed in a more relaxed arrangement and their gestures and movements appear to be more fluent and naturalistic. Detlev Kreindl expanded on Sievers' earlier conclusions in 1976. Kreidl highlighted that Huybrecht's figures are more statuesque and sculptural in handling. Kreidl also posited a similarity between Huybrecht's works and portraits from the circle of the Florentine painter Bronzino. It is precisely the sculptural treatment of his figures and the crisp modelling of the faces, which are regarded as evidence of the influence of the Florentine master. Kreidl suggests that possibly he trained in Bronzino's workshop as early as the mid-1550s. On the basis of these characteristics Kreidl reattributed two portraits (art market) previously given to Santi di Tito to Huybrecht. The kitchen maid and her helpers In their energetic and bold drawing of the main outlines of their compositions the brothers also show their common artistic background. Huybrecht's handling of various textures and patterns also suggests the influence of Anthonis Mor, with whom he is believed to have collaborated in the early 1560s in Antwerp. A Portrait of a man in the Mauritshuis in The Hague is signed and dated 'Mor 1561'. It is generally believed that only the head was painted by Mor while the rest was finished by an assistant in his workshop. It has been suggested that that assistant could be Huybrecht Beuckelaer because of his particular skill in rendering fabrics. The first Passover feast (Sotheby's New York sale, 26 January 2012, lot 105) illustrates Huybrecht's technique. In this work he employed a formula already used by Aertsen in the early 1550s. It is characterised by the high viewpoint, which allows every aspect of the scene, in this case, the Passover Feast, to be explained in detail. The scale of the composition is relatively large and the figures are almost lifelike positioned in the immediate foreground. These traits clearly show his indebtedness to the colorful naturalism of Aertsen's later works of this type. The scene is dominated by the large figures who are distributed on all levels of the pictorial space and connected by eye contact and individual gestures. Huybrechts demonstrates in this picture that he could give a more elegant and idealized treatment of figures than Aertsen's or his brother Joachim. =Market and kitchen scenes= The market and kitchen scenes showing the lavish produce available in Antwerp at the time have often been interpreted as showcasing the prosperity of Antwerp, the then most important trading port in the Netherlands.Joachim Beuckelaer: het markt- en keukenstuk in de Nederlanden, 1550-1650, Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Gent, Gemeentekrediet, 1986 Others see the compositions as satirical and bearing a moralistic intention.Margaret A. Sullivan, Aertsen's Kitchen and Market Scenes: Audience and Innovation in Northern Art, The Art Bulletin, Vol. 81, No. 2 (Jun., 1999), pp. 236‚Äì266, at JSTOR Some commentators have pointed to the erotic tension between the various actors in the scenes. For instance, the composition The kitchen maid and her helpers shows a cook standing in front of a fireplace, while she holds a big cabbage under her left arm and her right hand points to a chicken on a spit. A kitchen boy sitting at her feet on a bench with a dog on his lap is turning the spit. With his right hand he points to a young kitchen helper behind the kitchen maid. This young helper is placing a pot on a kitchen counter and is returning the boy's gaze. The kitchen interior is unmistakably dominated by erotic tension between the kitchen boy and the older kitchen maid. The big dog in the lap of the kitchen boy refers to his sexual desire while various comical and farcical foods, such as the rotisserie chicken, the cauldron of porridge, the cucumbers and the large cabbage under the arm of the kitchen maid indicate that she is available. In The egg seller another popular theme of Flemish genre art is depicted: that of the unequal love between an older man and a younger woman.Kwak, Z. S. M. (2014). ‚ÄòProeft de kost en kauwtse met uw‚Äô oogen‚Äô. Beeldtraditie, betekenis en functie van het Noord-Nederlandse keukentafereel (ca. 1590-1650) His Prodigal son feasting with harlots is not only a kitchen style scene but also falls in the category of the 'loose company' or 'merry company' painting genre developed earlier in the century by Jan Sanders van Hemessen. Beuckeleer depicts the subject in the form of a rendezvous between an elegantly dressed young couple sitting at a table. On the table a lavish still life is displayed, adding to the impression of upscale taste. The elegant man has clearly started his wooing earlier by playing the lute at his side. However, the actions of the servants makes clear that the true nature of the setting is that of a brothel rather than that of an upscale dwelling. Like Jan Sanders van Hemessen did in his earlier treatment of this subject, Beuckeleer included in his picture another scene from the biblical story of the prodigal son: in the background on the left the prodigal son is seen eating pig swill after he has squandered his inheritance and fallen on hard times. =Still life= Still life A still life referred to as Blackberries, cherries, pears, melons and other fruits, parsnips, bread, cheese and a waffle, roemer, tazza and salt cellar on a draped table (At Christie's on 16 October 2013 in Paris lot 69) has been attributed to Huybrecht Beuckeleer on the basis of the similarities with the still life included in the Prodigal son feasting with harlots of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts in Brussels. This still life makes clear that Huybrecht Beuckeleer played a role in the development of the genre of still life painting in the 16th century. In its skilfully organized and balanced composition this still life shows him to be independent from Aertsen's models. This still life prefigures the later works of Floris van Dyck (circa 1575-1651) and Nicolaes Gillis (1595-around 1632).

Governor Grey, realising the propensity of this regulation to create monopolies, rescinded the regulation but was unable to cancel the 40-odd \\"Special Selections\\" which had already been approved. John Reid and partners, on the advice of William Light, recently turned land agent, selected a property at a junction of NorthPara and South Para rivers. They engaged surveyor William Jacob to lay out the township now known as Gawler and divided the rest among themselves. Reid's portion of , which he named \\"Clonlea\\", was on the north side of the North Para. Among Reid's partners were fellow passengers Henry Dundas Murray and Stephen King, father of Stephen King Jr., and Henry Johnson, a proxy for London banker Edmund Jerningham. Streets in Gawler were named for these pioneers. :John Reid failed as an agriculturist: labour costs brought about by the gold rush to Victoria and the copper mines in Burra and elsewhere, coupled with poor prices, stretched his finances to breaking point, and he sold the mortgage on the property to William Paxton (Australian businessman) the chemist of Hindley Street. Eventually Paxton resumed the property, leaving the homestead and for the Reids' use. The children were brought up at \\"Clonlea\\", Gawler. Three of the brothers went in for pastoral property management: William took over Tolarno station on the Darling River, which he managed from the mid 1850s to the 1890s. Ross Reid and R.J.B. Reid initially had a share in the business; R.J.B. Reid left the partnership in 1868. Ross Reid was managing Mount Murchison station until at least 1866, then it was taken over by Dean & Laughton, and Ross joined William at Tolarno. Original owner Ross T.

They owned Tarcoon Station, on the Bogan River, from 1870 to 1872, when it was sold to F. H. Randell. Tolarno station was one of the largest and most successful sheep stations on the Darling, shearing up to 250,000 sheep a year. While Tolarno was in the hands of the Reid brothers the only practical freight communication was by steamboat on the Murray-Darling system to ports such as Echuca, Mannum and Goolwa. In 1875, the Reid brothers and Hugh King purchased the Jane Eliza from captains Davies and Dorward, and also had an interest in steamers Gem, Jupiter, Menindie and Shannon. Thousands of tonnes of wool were shipped and the Reid brothers made a fortune. Tolarno was in the 1880s badly infested with rabbits, and was used as a test bed for Dr. Butcher's experiments with \\"Tintinallogy disease\\", which proved to be a false hope. In 1887 he put \\"Rostrevor\\" on the market; it was purchased by Melbourne businessman J. S. Reid (no relation). A prolonged drought hit the country in the 1890s, with a considerable loss of stock.

He was also an early American entomologist and a regional specialist in the study of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Biography Morris was born on November 14, 1803 in York, Pennsylvania. He was the youngest of nine children born to John Samuel Gottlieb Morris and Barbara Myers Morris. His father had emigrated from Germany in 1776 to fight in the American Revolution. His mother was from Baltimore County, Maryland. After the war, the senior Morris settled in York, married Barbara Myers and became a successful physician. Both parents were devout members of the Lutheran Church. Morris was baptized on January 8, 1804 in York's Christ Lutheran Church.Kurtz (1994)Kurtz (1996) When Morris was five, his father died, leaving a substantial fortune to his wife and children. Morris' oldest brother, Charles, stepped in and became the boy's guardian. Morris studied first at York Academy, attended Princeton and then graduated from Dickinson College in 1823. He demonstrated a strong aptitude for language and became fluent in German, Greek, Latin, French, and Hebrew. After graduation at the age of twenty, Morris decided to become a Lutheran minister. For two years he studied with Samuel Simon Schmucker, an influential but controversial Lutheran religious leader. He then studied at the Presbyterian Princeton Theological Seminary before finishing his training in 1826 at the new Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg. In October 1827, Morris was ordained in the Lutheran ministry and began serving as pastor of the First English Lutheran Church in Baltimore. Shortly after settling in Baltimore, Morris married Eliza Hay, member of a prominent New York family. They went on to have ten children, of whom four daughters survived to adulthood.Guide to the Morris, J.G. & Morris-Hay Family Diaries, Gettysburg College When Morris joined the clergy, Lutheranism faced an internal struggle between liberals who sought to align with mainstream American Protestantism and conservative German immigrants who wished to maintain their traditions and language. As pastor of First English for more than thirty years, Morris was a leading proponent of progressive, English-speaking Lutheranism in Baltimore. He also participated in inter-denominational efforts and became president of the Baltimore Ministerial Association. When he left his parish in 1860, he continued to serve on a part-time basis at St. Mark's and Third English, both in Baltimore. Morris was also active on state and national levels, serving seven times as president of the Maryland Synod and twice as president of the General Synod. By 1860 Morris had served as pastor for 33 years and felt the need for a career change. He resigned his position and was appointed trustee for the new Peabody Institute. Later that same year he became the institution's first librarian, charged with building a collection that covered \\"every department of knowledge\\". Morris quickly put together a catalog of 50,000 volumes he wanted to obtain for the new library. By the time he left the library in 1867, he had acquired 20,000 titles. Even after his departure, the catalog continued to provide guidance for book acquisitions until 1916.Kurtz (1997) In addition to his religious work, Morris had a keen interest in science, education, and history. He was one of the earliest American entomologists to specialize in the study of butterflies. In 1842 he became a founding member of the Entomological Society of Pennsylvania, the first society in America devoted to entomology. In 1846 he toured Europe, meeting with European entomologists and viewing the insect collections at some of the major museums.Sorensen (1995) In 1860 Morris published his Catalogue of the Described Lepidoptera of North America and followed with the Synopsis of the Described Lepidoptera of North America in 1862. These were the first catalogs of American butterflies written by an American.Leach (2013) Morris also wrote and lectured extensively on the relationship between science and religion. Unlike many of his colleagues in American entomology, he never accepted Darwinism and instead remained a supporter of Georges Cuvier's catastrophism. For many years Morris maintained a close relationship with the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg and its sister institution, Pennsylvania College (now Gettysburg College). He was appointed director of the seminary in 1828 and eventually served ten terms for a total of 48 years. He participated in the establishment of the college in 1832 and served on the board of trustees for 54 years. He taught zoology and natural history at the college and lectured for many years at the seminary. In 1844 Morris organized the Linnaean Association, one of the first college natural history societies in the country. Morris also established the Lutherville Female Seminary (and the town of Lutherville) in 1853. In 1851 Morris was elected to membership in the Maryland Historical Society, an organization that suited his scholarly interest in history. Over the next four decades he served the society in a number of different roles and was elected president in 1895. One of his chief contributions to the Society was the effort he led to expand and improve both the library and the natural history collections. By 1885 the library held over 25,000 volumes and the museum held a substantial collection representing the flora, fauna, and geology of Maryland. In 1886 Morris used his influence to encourage the creation of the Society for the History of the Germans in Maryland. Morris was elected president of the new society, a position he held until his death. Morris died on October 10, 1895. Works Morris was a prolific writer who published hundreds of books, pamphlets and articles on a number of subjects, including Martin Luther, the Reformation, German history, Maryland history, and the relation between science and religion. A few of his publications include: *1838 Geology and Revelation *1844 Necessities and Blessings of the Reformation *1846 Natural History as Applied to Farming and Gardening *1855 Martin Behaim, the German Astronomer *1860 Catalogue of the Described Lepidoptera of North America *1862 Synopsis of the Described Lepidoptera of North America *1874 The Lords of Baltimore *1882 Luther at Wartburg: A Reformation Story of 1521 *1896 Life Reminiscences of an Old Lutheran Minister Notes References   1803 births 1895 deaths American entomologists American Lutheran clergy Peabody Institute faculty Dickinson College alumni Gettysburg College faculty American librarians ","title":"John Gottlieb Morris"},{"id":"53398750","text":"Christian Garros (February 17, 1920, Paris ‚Äì August 23, 1988, Rouen) was a French jazz drummer and bandleader.

His illusions, which often involve videos of three-dimensional objects shown from carefully chosen perspectives, won first place at the Best Illusion of the Year Contest in 2010, 2013, and 2018, and second place in 2015 and 2016. Education and career Sugihara earned bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in mathematical engineering from the University of Tokyo in 1971, 1973, and 1980 respectively. From 1973 to 1981 he worked as a researcher at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. He then became an associate professor in the Department of Information and Computer Engineering at Nagoya University in 1981, and moved back to the Department of Mathematical Engineering and Information Physics at the University of Tokyo in 1986. Since 2009 he has been a professor at Meiji University.Kokichi Sugihara's Personal Data , retrieved 2017-03-05. Illusions Five of Sugihara's illusions have won awards at the annual Best Illusion of the Year Contest: *In 2010, his illusion \\"Impossible Motion: Magnet Slopes\\" won first place in the contest. This illusion uses forced perspective to show marbles seemingly rolling up ramps. *In 2013 he won first place again (with Jun Ono and Akiyasu Tomoeda) for \\"Rotation Generated by Translation\\", an illusion that uses Moir√© patterns to create the appearance of rotation from objects moving only by translation.. *In 2015 his \\"Ambiguous Garage Roof\\" won second place. The illusion appears to show a convex roof surface that is reflected in a mirror to a corrugated zig-zag shape. Neither of these appearances accurately describes the true shape of the roof.. *In 2016 he won second place again for \\"Ambiguous Cylinder Illusion\\", which shows a stack of cylinders that from one point of view appear to have a circular cross-section, and from another point of view appear rectangular. *In 2018 he won his first place for his \\"Triply Ambiguous Object\\", which shows a rectangular object with three different interpretations when seen from three special viewpoints.. His interest in illusions stems from his research in the 1980s on automating the analysis of perspective drawings,. which he published in the 1986 MIT Press book Machine Interpretation of Line Drawings. When he asked his computer system to interpret impossible objects such as the ones in the art of M. C. Escher, he discovered that they could be interpreted as drawings of real objects with unexpected shapes. Other research Sugihara's research also includes the study of Voronoi diagrams.

Ambrosie played Canadian football professionally as an offensive guard for the CFL's Calgary Stampeders, Toronto Argonauts, and Edmonton Eskimos. He was selected with the second overall pick in the 1985 CFL Draft by the Stampeders. Over the course of a nine-season career, he played in 142 professional games and became a Grey Cup champion. Ambrosie played college football at the University of Manitoba.  Early career  Ambrosie played college football for the Manitoba Bisons as an offensive lineman. In 1984, he was named an All-Canadian. He was also a Canada West All-Star in 1983 and 1984. In a February 1985 article in The Globe and Mail, it was stated that a recent poll of CFL teams listed Ambrosie as one of the top nine players available for the 1985 CFL Draft. Ambrosie received a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the school.  Professional career  = Calgary Stampeders = Ambrosie was selected in the first round of the 1985 CFL Draft by the Calgary Stampeders with the second overall pick. The Stampeders used Ambrosie in their lineup immediately. Despite a late season injury due to torn ligaments in his ankle, Ambrosie played in 13 regular season games in his rookie season and was named the Stampeders' nominee for rookie of the year. Ambrosie remained in the lineup in 1986, playing in 17 regular season games. = Toronto Argonauts = After playing four games for the Stampeders in 1987, Ambrosie was traded to the Toronto Argonauts for a second-round draft pick. He quickly earned a place on the Argonauts' roster, playing against the Stampeders in his first week after changing between the two teams. The Argonauts eventually promoted Ambrosie to start as a right guard. Ambrosie finished the season with 13 games played for the Argonauts. He played in the 75th Grey Cup, making a key block to allow running back Gill Fenerty to score a touchdown late in the first half. The Argonauts went on to lose the game 36‚Äì38. The offensive line of the Argonauts dealt with injuries for much of the 1988 season. Ambrosie injured his knee during training camp, while other Argonaut offensive linemen suffered from a variety of ankle, groin, knee, and back injuries. By late July, Ambrosie had recovered, but he was the only healthy starting member of the offensive line that year. Despite the medical setbacks, both the press and the Argonauts coaching staff praised the offensive line, with the Toronto Star crediting the unit for \\"establish[ing] Toronto as one of the best running teams in the Canadian Football League\\". In September, Ambrosie missed three games due to a back injury and he played through an ankle injury in October. The continued injury issues did not affect the offensive line's success on the field, as they finished with the second fewest sacks allowed in the CFL. Ambrosie finished the regular season with 15 games played. The Argonauts went on to lose in the East Final to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. = Edmonton Eskimos = In June 1989, Ambrosie was traded to the Edmonton Eskimos to obtain defensive lineman Branko Vincic. The Argonauts had not originally planned to trade Ambrosie, but he requested to be traded to a team closer to where his wife worked. Ambrosie played in all 18 regular season games for the Eskimos in 1989 as the Eskimos established a 16‚Äì2 record. By adding to the Argonauts 14 wins the previous season, Ambrosie set a new CFL record as the player with the most wins in two consecutive seasons. Despite being described as \\"one of the strongest teams in CFL history\\", the Eskimos lost to the Saskatchewan Roughriders 32‚Äì21 in the West Final to end their season. Ambrosie played in 13 games for the Eskimos in 1990, missing time due to a knee injury. He played in all 18 regular season games the following year. In 1991, the Eskimos finished first in the West Division but lost the West Final to the Stampeders. In 1992, Ambrosie played in all regular season games as the Eskimos went 13‚Äì5 before losing in the West Finals to the Stampeders for the second consecutive season. The Eskimos considered there to be \\"no safe jobs\\" on the roster following several years of playoff losses, but Ambrosie earned a starting role on the team to start the 1993 season. A knee injury kept Ambrosie out of the lineup for most of September, and he finished with 13 games played in 1993. The Eskimos met the Stampeders in the West Final for the fourth consecutive season and won 29‚Äì15 to break their playoff losing streak. Ambrosie helped the Eskimos win the 81st Grey Cup over the Winnipeg Blue Bombers 33‚Äì23 to earn his only championship ring. = Retirement = Following his Grey Cup win, the future of Ambrosie's football career was uncertain. His persistent knee injuries had required multiple surgeries over the years. Ambrosie put off another serious surgery on his left knee during the 1993 season to remain with the team through their Grey Cup victory. After he underwent his fourth knee surgery during the offseason, Ambrosie retired from professional football.  Administrative roles  By 1992, Ambrosie took over as the secretary of the Canadian Football League Players' Association (CFLPA). He played a role in monitoring the 1992 NHL strike as the CFLPA and the CFL renegotiated their collective bargaining agreement that year. Ambrosie was also part of the CFLPA board that oversaw the CFL's expansion into the United States. During the expansion, Ambrosie took a strong stance against lowering the import ratio which requires each team to carry a certain number of Canadian players. He also took issue with a proposed expansion or dispersal draft intended to be held in early 1993 to provide players for the San Antonio Texans and Sacramento Gold Miners. The CFLPA and Ambrosie threatened legal action over the import ratio issue, but no legal action came to pass. On June 28, 2017, the Winnipeg Free Press reported that Ambrosie would soon be named the 14th CFL commissioner, succeeding Jeffrey Orridge. The move was officially announced seven days later. He is the first Canadian-born CFL commissioner since Tom Wright left in 2006, and the first to have played in the league since Larry Smith left the position in 1997.  Business career  After retiring from football, Ambrosie became the North American head of sales at HSBC Securities. In May 2004, Ambrosie joined AGF Management Ltd. as their head of sales and marketing. The president of the company reportedly hired him to \\"shake things up\\". Ambrosie's leadership brought several changes to AGF Management Ltd., including new fund managers and the launch of new products. In June 2006, Ambrosie was appointed president of AGF Funds Inc. Due to another managerial change in 2008, Ambrosie left the firm. Ambrosie served as CEO of Accretive 360 Inc. from 2010 to 2012, before joining investment firm MacDougall, MacDougall & MacTier as president and CEO.

The building used to be one of Campania‚Äôs Bourbon royal residences and since 1927 this residence has hosted the museum. History In 1815, Ferdinand IV of Bourbon bought for his wife Lucia Migliaccio, duchess of Floridia, the mansion of the Prince Giuseppe Caracciolo di Torella on the hill of Vomero. In her honour the villa was called after her Flordiana. Over time, the King bought more land around the original mansion and the architect Antonio Niccolini was given the privilege of restoring the old structure. Between 1817 and 1819 the villa got its neoclassical style, while the gardens were remodelled by the director of the Botanical Gardens of Naples, Mr Friedrich Dehnardt. The park was embellished with 150 plant species, among which you can find pine trees, plane trees and a rich collection of camellias. By the end of the restoration project, the Villa Floridiana comprised two buildings, Villa Lucia and villa Flor√¨dia, a small open theatre, a little Ionic semi-circular temple, fake ruins and greenhouses in neoclassical style. When the sovereigns died, the Villa Floridiana passed on to the heirs of the Duchess‚Äô first marriage. Later, Villa Lucia and part of the gardens were sold to Count Pasquale Stanislao Mancini, thus becoming his residence in Naples. In 1919, the Floridiana was bought by the state and was transformed into a museum. The first exhibition was the ceramics collection received from Maria Spinelli di Scalea, niece of Placido Sangro, Duke of Martina. So, the Museum was named after him. Placido di Sangro, comes from the Neapolitan noble family ‚ÄúDi sanguine‚Äù, resident in ‚Äúsedile di Nilo‚Äù, but having land also in Aquila, Benevento, Lucera e Troia. Placido di Sangro lived during the 16th century and worked as an ambassador for Charles V. He was a scholar and got appointed ‚ÄúPrince‚Äù of the Academy of Sireni or Sereni attended by distinguished aristocrats of the time. Placido di Sangro was received by Emperor Charles V, as Ambassador of Neapolitans. After the interview, the emperor, fearing to lose the Kingdom of Naples for the multiplication of riots that caused quite a few losses in the Spanish Army, proclaimed a pardon for rebels and decided that in Naples there would be no Inquisition. The Kingdom of Naples became a happy and safe place for the people persecuted by the Inquisition of the Church. As a consequence, the family of Eleonora de Fonseca Pimentel, who had escaped from Portugal and Rome, moved to Naples to be free from religious persecution. The rich collection of items, collected during the second half of the 19th century by Placido de Sangro, duke of Martina and given to the city of Naples in 1911 by his grandson, the earl of Marsi Placido de Sangro, well reflects the climate of enthusiasm and of renewed interest in the so-called minor arts, which spread over Europe at that time. The duke of Martina, estimator and connoisseur of every type of artefacts, bought items from the main European cities gathering, starting from the second half of the 19th century, an impressive collection of chinaware, majolica and minor artistic artefacts made of glass, leather, coral and ivory. Itinerary The visit of the museum starts from the vestibule, where the visitors can see the paintings of Ferdinand IV of Bourbon and of the Duchess Floridia, and leads them to the other floors through the large side staircase. The collections of the museum have been expanded in 1978, when an heir of the duke of Martina, Riccardo de Sangro, posthumously donated a collection of 580 items, including porcelain, majolica and furniture belonging to the original collection of Placido de Sangro. More recently, another donation from De Felice enriched the museum with tortoiseshell artefacts. Today, the National Museum of ceramics Duca di Martina, with its 6,000 oriental and occidental items on display, hosts one of the biggest collections in Italy of decorative art from the 12th to the 19th century. The museum is on three levels: ground floor, basement and first floor. =Ground Floor= Entering the villa, on the ground floor, visitors can appreciate some porcelain and sketches made by Neapolitan artists of the 2nd and 18th centuries.

She was married first to Howard Head and then to Dr. Stanley Morse Jr. and lived in South Carolina. She was also a mentor to Pat Conroy. Instead of graduating college, she became a freelance writer at age 28. She died at age 52 of a cerebral aneurysm on May 7, 1968.Lauderdale, David (24 October 2015). Meet Pat Conroy's 'first novelist', The Island Packet Even though Mr. and Mrs. Bo Jo Jones was marketed for young adults, Ann Head did not consider herself a young adult writer, and wrote the book for an adult audience. However, because the novel sold better to young adults, it is now considered part of the genre of Young Adult Literature. In 1971 the novel was adapted to a made-for-TV movie by the same name starring Desi Arnaz Jr. and Christopher Norris. Synopsis July Greher Jones tells the story of the first year of her marriage to her high school boyfriend, the football hero Boswell Johnson \\"Bo Jo\\" Jones. When the story begins, 16-year-old July and 17-year-old Bo Jo are high school seniors preparing for college. The upper-middle-class Grehers plan for July to attend an elite college; Bo Jo's working-class family hopes that he will get a football scholarship and be the first in his family to attend college. July's parents do not approve of her spending so much time with Bo Jo, and try to get her to date other boys. Although July is not certain of her feelings for Bo Jo, she likes him more than other boys she has dated, and the couple continues to see each other exclusively. One night, after consuming alcohol at a party where Bo Jo's former girlfriend Alicia is present and makes July feel jealous, Bo Jo and July end up having sex. July learns she is pregnant just as Bo Jo receives his letter of acceptance and football scholarship from Georgia Tech. The couple hide the pregnancy from their parents, secretly drive across the state line, and get married. Eventually they inform their parents, causing Bo Jo's parents to throw him out of the house and July's parents to threaten a forced annulment and an illegal abortion. Both sets of parents reluctantly accept the marriage. The couple are forced to leave school, and live for a disastrous short time with Bo Jo's parents, who blame July for ruining Bo Jo's college opportunity. July's parents then arrange an apartment for the couple and a job for Bo Jo at July's father's bank. The only truly supportive adult is July's grandmother. July and Bo Jo soon find themselves missing their old life of school, football, and social events, and begin to bicker with each other and spend time apart. Lonely and bored, July begins writing to a Princeton student named Horace, who, unlike Bo Jo, is from her social class and shares July's interests in music and literature. Horace lives out of town and is unaware that July is now married with a baby on the way, and July avoids telling him, even when his letters begin to show a romantic interest. July also meets and bonds with another young teenage bride, Lou, who is an aspiring singer and actress recently married to an older man. July and Lou's friendship comes to an end when Lou becomes unexpectedly pregnant and, unlike July, decides to have an illegal abortion without telling her husband. Lou's husband finds out and angrily hits Lou, who leaves him and moves to New York, where she becomes a nightclub singer and the mistress of a wealthy man. July realizes that unlike Lou, she does want her baby, which is beginning to move in her womb. Bo Jo meanwhile has sought solace by spending more time out drinking with his old friends Charlie and Alicia, whom July does not like, especially since Alicia still seems to be romantically pursuing Bo Jo. After Bo Jo and July argue, he leaves the house and later comes home with a lipstick smudge on his neck, causing July to suspect him of cheating on her with Alicia. Two months before July is due, she confronts Alicia and afterwards goes into early labor. The premature baby dies a few days after birth. Bo Jo and July's parents now suggest that the couple should split up and resume the lives they had before, with July attending a boarding school near Princeton and Bo Jo getting his football scholarship back. But Bo Jo and July realize that their shared grief over the lost baby has brought them closer together, and now they are truly in love and do not want to break up. Three years later, Bo Jo is attending college, living in the married students' housing with his wife July, who works in the bursar's office to help pay their expenses.  Characters *July Greher- July is the sixteen-year-old protagonist of the novel, which is told from her first person point of view. She is a senior in high school and really enjoys the subjects of English literature and Biology. She planned to attend a girls‚Äô college in New England after graduation, but the unplanned pregnancy and marriage interrupt those plans. She had never ‚Äúgone steady‚Äù with anyone before, and neither she nor Bo Jo were considered ‚Äúoffbeat‚Äù or had anything ‚Äúway out‚Äù about them. They never intended to have premarital sex, and even feel ashamed for weeks afterward (before finding out about the pregnancy). She believes that marriage is a serious commitment despite her rushing into it, and also believes that marriage is worth preserving and implies certain promises. She also is strongly opposed to abortion and giving up the baby for adoption. She feels isolated from her family and friends after her marriage to Bo Jo because they (1) don‚Äôt have the shared experience and (2) don‚Äôt believe the marriage will/should last. *Bo Jo Jones- Boswell Johnson Jones is July's long-term boyfriend and eventual husband, as well as father of the child. He is seventeen and his best quality is his persistence no matter the activity. He is a private person who mostly keeps his thoughts to himself, but works really hard in school in order to get the grades necessary for acceptance to a university. They don‚Äôt have a lot of money and Bo Jo will be the first of his family to attend college. He is the school's star halfback whose family is banking his receiving an athletic scholarship to a university. Before their unplanned, intimate night on the beach, neither had considered their relationship serious. However, after they slip up, July tries to break up with Bo Jo and he tells her that he doesn‚Äôt want to date anyone else and she says likewise. He promises not to ‚Äúfall off the deep end‚Äù ever again, and they try to continue dating. After July informs Bo Jo that she is pregnant, he asserts that they should get married. Bo Jo struggles in his interactions with July and learning to be married, as well as his lost educational opportunities, but does his best to provide for July and their expected baby. *Mary Ann Simmons- Mary Anne is July's best friend that is described as naive and pure despite a ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù upbringing. She has a long term boyfriend, Alan, who she eventually marries at the end of the novel. Her and Alan's relationship is set up as a foil against July and Bo Jo's marriage. Not only do Mary Anne and Alan love each other, but they follow a proper timeline in their relationship and engage in age-appropriate activities. Mary Anne's family is complicated because her mother supposedly has a new husband and family in Peru who Mary Anne never sees, and Mary Anne helps to raise the dozen ‚Äúorphan‚Äù siblings her father has collected from multiple marriages and divorces with women who leave all their children behind (whether fathered by Mr. Simmons or not). Mary Anne is the same social class as July and refers to each successive stepmother as ‚ÄúMother _,‚Äù which to those unaware of the situation would make it seem like she was referring to a nun. *Horace - Horace is a nephew of one of Mr. and Mrs. Greher's friends whose family comes to visit with July's family right before July and Bo Jo are able to tell her parents about their marriage. July's mother tries to get July to take Horace out on the town to give him something to do, while Bo Jo is right there. He is a sophomore at the university and plans to attend Princeton. They enjoy sophisticated conversation together and Horace eventually writes to July. Hurt by Bo Jo's emotional distance and their constant fighting, and lonely because of her isolation from friends and family, July writes Horace as a pen pal. She deliberately writes about anything besides her marriage, signs the letters with her maiden name, and has them delivered to her parents‚Äô home. After a while, July and Bo Jo reach a level of solidarity in their marriage but July still struggles to write Horace off. Eventually Horace basically confesses his love to July in a letter that is intercepted by Mrs. Greher, who is upset because Horace's aunt called, wondering about the correspondence. July writes back that she never intended to lead Horace on in that way and that she enjoyed the friendship. Horace responds after the baby is born and dead, and the couple is facing forced separation. He says that he is still interested in pursuing July should she ever find herself ‚Äúunattached.‚Äù Horace represents ‚Äòwhat could have been‚Äô had July not gotten pregnant and married. He is of her same social and economic standing and much more intellectual and sophisticated than Bo Jo. July decidedly rejects this option with her and Bo Jo's decision to stay together. Horace is in many ways representative of all July's parents wanted for her, and opportunities she could not have because of getting pregnant as a teenager. *Charlie Sanders- Bo Jo's Best friend who is considered to be wild but \\"quiet\\" about it. He is portrayed to believe that the world is his oyster. He throws parties out of town and July's parents are not found of him. July doesn't like Charlie very much either but would never say anything to Bo Jo as they are very good friends and she pretended to like Charlie in order to ease Bo Jo's mind when they first started dating. *Tommy Ryan and Julius Spence- Boys that July has dated before but views more like brothers then significant others. *Alicia Helms- Alicia is Bo Jo's ex- girlfriend who moved out of town but attends the same social events. Alicia's presence within the group at prom (along with some champagne slipped into the punch) motivated July and Bo Jo to go to the beach alone after the party rather than stay with the group. At first Bo Jo seems uninterested in Alicia, but Alicia aggressively pursues Bo Jo after he and July marry. After July and Bo Jo verbally fight, Bo Jo feels hurt and sometimes spends time with Charlie and Alicia in the aftermath of his fights with July. One night Bo Jo comes home after a fight and has a lipstick smudge on his neck, which July is sure came from Alicia. Two months before July is due she has an upsetting encounter with Alicia and afterwards goes into labor. *Rodney Blue- is the nice guy who only the desperate teens date. *Lou Consuela- Lou is set up as another foil against July. She is seventeen years old and married to a twenty-seven-year- old horse trainer. She and July become friends one day at the supermarket and bond over being both young and married. July feels that her old friends her age can no longer relate to her, and Lou doesn‚Äôt really get along with the wives of her husband, Nick's, older friends. Lou dreams of becoming a singer and actress and requires Nick to promise her that opportunity upon agreeing to marry him. However, Lou gets pregnant and blames it on Nick because he wanted to have unplanned (unprotected) sex on a day vacation. Lou thinks that having a child would ruin any chance of her becoming a star and has an illegal abortion in secret that she has to take out a loan in order to cover the cost. Nick wants children, finds out about the abortion, and is furious with Lou in response. Lou packs up and moves to New York. She writes to July to explain what happened and how she is doing. While July sometimes regrets her lost opportunities, she would never follow Lou's choices. July may not have wanted the baby at first and only acted how seemed necessary, but decides that she does want the baby when she can feel the life inside of her and compares her own experience with Lou's. *Mr. and Mrs Greher- Mr. and Mrs. Greher are July's parents. Mr. Greher works in a bank where they are firmly upper-middle class and have a good reputation in the community. Mrs. Greher was brought up in high society and cares very much about propriety. They live in the established side of town and can afford what they consider the very best. Before July and Bo Jo marry, Mr. and Mrs. Greher do not like Bo Jo very much and encourage July to spend less time with him and more time with varied groups of friends. Finding out about the marriage and the baby shocks Mr. and Mrs. Greher, and they feel that they have not only failed July as parents but that July is deliberately trying to hurt them. They would prefer to have July give up the baby for adoption and have the marriage annulled, not only because they disapprove of Bo Jo (being from a different class) but because the marriage limits July's own social and educational opportunities. Mr. Greher does offer Bo Jo a job at the bank (which he accepts) in order to cover the newlyweds‚Äô costs of living and pregnancy expenses. They also secure a private apartment above an acquaintance's garage for the newlyweds, which allows them some autonomy and privacy. *Mr. and Mrs. Jones- Mr. Jones is a contract engineer and the family is comparatively ‚Äúnew‚Äù to both middle class and the community at large. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Jones, nor their other two children, attended a university and they have high hopes for Bo Jo to gain an education so that he can secure a better, easier life for himself. Because they are newly established as lower-middle class, they cannot afford their children's college expenses. Previous to July and Bo Jo's wedding, Mr. and Mrs. Jones hadn‚Äôt even been keeping track of who their son was dating. When they find out about the marriage and pregnancy they are absolutely livid because it means that even after all of Bo Jo's hard work to get good grades and secure an athletic scholarship, he won‚Äôt be able to utilize it. They kick him out of the house when informed of the marriage, but allow the couple to stay with them after a couple days past. This proves to be disastrous as they are constantly, verbally reminding July that she ruined Bo Jo's life and hovering over their every action. Mrs. Jones tries to teach July some domestic skills but July often fails at these. They also won‚Äôt allow the newlyweds to sleep in the same room while staying in their home. Mr. and Mrs. Jones also do not like Mr. and Mrs. Greher and act very antagonistically toward them upon any forced interaction. *Grandma Louisa Conduit Greher - July's Grandmother is very proper but only snobbish about the ‚Äúright things,‚Äù according to July. She cares about people being ‚Äúopen minded.‚Äù She likes to drive her car like a skilled racecar drivier and lives in the nice home her husband left behind after he died, but took down all of the pictures of his high-class ancestors because she didn‚Äôt know them. When July's parents force July and Bo Jo to undergo a second marriage ceremony for propriety's sake, Grandmother Greher attends the ceremony at the church and afterwards gifts July four slim gold bracelets linked together by a gold chain with ‚Äúfaith,‚Äù ‚Äúforgiveness,‚Äù ‚Äúhumor,‚Äù and ‚Äúeternal vigilance‚Äù engraved on each one. She encourages July to strive for these qualities in her own marriage because July and Bo Jo don‚Äôt have love to rely on. Grandmother Greher is the only one to accept July and Bo Jo's marriage, as well as Bo Jo himself, and becomes a mentor figure that helps them through their struggles and hard decisions. She does this not through telling the teenagers what to do, but rather getting them to talk through their problems and figure out their own values and beliefs. Reception Kirkus Reviews reviewed the book, stating that \\"Ann Head deals all this out with a determinedly light hand, but her teenagers for all their troubles are all-American, and appealingand some young marrieds may empathize, some older ones (women) sympathize.\\" Movie adaptation The novel was adapted for a made-for-TV movie of the same name in 1971.(14 November 1971).

He is Australia's only recorded male pirate.Georgatas, G., \\"An 18,000-year old history uncovered on WA island\\", National Indigenous Times, 20 June 2012, p. 14. Arrival in Australia Anderson arrived in the fledgling King George Sound colony (modern day Albany) aboard the American whaling vessel Vigilant in 1826. While the crew were drinking ashore, a fight broke out and a man was killed. Accused of murder, Anderson and several crewmates fled in a small vessel and hid out in the Recherche Archipelago, approximately 400 kilometres to the east. Piracy Anderson and his fellows established an encampment on Middle Island in Western Australia, as it was one of the few islands with a source of fresh water. The archipelago was heavily populated by Australian sea lions and New Zealand fur seals, and Anderson's band soon enriched themselves by trading furs to settlements along the coast; they are noted as visiting Kangaroo Island and the Althorpe Islands in South Australia. They supplemented their sealing income by robbing vessels travelling between Western Australia and the east coast colonies. They are also said to have murdered Indigenous Kaurna men and abducted women to take as sex slaves. The Recherche Archipelago was treacherous and uncharted, making it an ideal hideout for the pirates. In September 1834 Anderson and another black man, John Bathurst, arrived at Kangaroo Island from Long Island and clashed with whalers and Aboriginals. According to an 1842 report complaining about the lawlessness of sealers: > One of the most daring of these people was a man of color of the name of > Anderson, and lawless as these men were, they looked up to him with a sort > of dread. Anderson usually carried a brace of pistols about him, knowing > that he held his life by a very precarious tenure. By persevering exertions > he had amassed a considerable sum of money, and usually kept one or two > black women to attend on him and minister to his wants, when not engaged in > sealing. =Death= Anderson was eventually murdered by his fellow pirates, and is thought to be buried somewhere on Middle Island. According to a contemporary report: > They got quite disgusted with Anderson's harshness, and determined to remove > him, but were puzzled how to accomplish it, as he was a stout, powerful man, > and being armed was always on his guard. At last, one day when he was asleep > in the tent, one of them entered and, taking deliberate aim, blew his brains > out. The corpse was thrown into a hole, and covered over with earth, they > then shared the booty, and killed the native wowan [he was with] in case she > should afterwards tell the tale.

These data sets are often used by hedge fund managers and other institutional investment professionals within an investment company. Alternative data sets are information about a particular company that is published by sources outside of the company, which can provide unique and timely insights into investment opportunities. Alternative data sets are often categorized as big data, which means that they may be very large and complex and often cannot be handled by software traditionally used for storing or handling data, such as Microsoft Excel. An alternative data set can be compiled from various sources such as financial transactions, sensors, mobile devices, satellites, public records, and the internet. Alternative data can be compared with data that is traditionally used by investment companies such as investor presentations, SEC filings, and press releases. These examples of ‚Äútraditional data‚Äù are produced directly by the company itself. Since alternative data sets originate as a product of a company's operations, these data sets are often less readily accessible and less structured than traditional sources of data. Alternative data is also known as ‚Äúexhaust data.‚Äù The company that produces alternative data generally overlooks the value of the data to institutional investors. During the last decade, many data brokers, aggregators, and other intermediaries began specializing in providing alternative data to investors and analysts.  Types  Examples of alternative data include: * Geolocation (foot traffic) * Credit card transactions * Email receipts * Point-of-sale transactions * Web site usage * Mobile App or App Store analytics * Obscure city hall records * Satellite images * Social media posts * Online browsing activity * Shipping container receipts * Product reviews * Price trackers * Shipping trackers * Internet activity and quality data Example of sentiment analysis against stock price (S&P; 500)  Uses  Alternative data is being used by fundamental and quantitative institutional investors to create innovative sources of alpha. The field is still in the early phases of development, yet depending on the resources and risk tolerance of a fund, multiple approaches abound to participate in this new paradigm. The process to extract benefits from alternative data can be extremely challenging. The analytics, systems, and technologies for processing such data are relatively new and most institutional investors do not have capabilities to integrate alternative data into their investment decision process. However, with the right tools and strategy, a fund can mitigate costs while creating an enduring competitive advantage. Most alternative data research projects are lengthy and resource intensive; therefore, due-diligence is required before working with a data set. The due-diligence should include an approval from the compliance team, validation of processes that create and deliver this data set, and identification of investment insights that can be additive the investment process.  Methodology  Alternative data can be accessed via: * Web scraping (or web Harvesting, performed by computer programmers that design an algorithm that searches websites for specific data on a desired topic) * Acquisition of Raw data * Third-party Licensing  Analysis  In finance, Alternative data is often analysed in the following ways: * Scarcity: the data Information overload within financial markets * Granularity: the level of detail and aggregation of data (including time) * History: the trajectory of data * Structure: the form of the data (csv, json etc.) * Coverage: the stocks or geographical locations that data can be linked with  Best practices  While compliance and internal regulation are widely practiced in the alternative data field, there exists a need for an industry-wide best practices standard. Such a standard should address personally identifiable information (PII) obfuscation and access scheme requirements among other issues. Compliance professionals and decision makers can benefit from proactively creating internal guidelines for data operations. Publications such as NIST 800-122 provide guidelines for protecting PII and are useful when developing internal best practices. Investment Data Standards Organization (IDSO) was established to develop, maintain, and promote industry-wide standards and best practices for the Alternative Data industry.  Web Scraping  Legal aspects surrounding web scraping of alternative data have yet to be defined. Current best practices address the following issues when determining legal compliance of web crawling operations: * Review of the terms and conditions associated with the websites crawled * Control over the potential interference with crawled websites Web scraped data refers to data harvested from public websites. With 4 billion webpages and 1.2 million terabytes of data on the internet there is a mountain of information that can be valuable to investors when analyzing companies performance. The companies that specialize in this type of data collection write programs that access targeted websites and collect and store the scraped information on a periodic basis. In some cases web scraping requires use of public APIs as a way to access the data within those pages directly without visiting the actual website. Types of web scraped data include: * Job listings: A company that is increasing hiring and headcount is likely experiencing growth. * Company ratings: Sites like Glassdoor allows employees to rate their company; increasing ratings, especially (in conjunction with increasing job listings) can be another growth indicator. * Online retail data: High product rankings on online retailers suggest strong sales for those product manufacturers. On the flip side, heavy discounting of products suggest weak sales.Johnson, Richard.Data in Action: Web-Scraping.\\" 14 January 2019 Standards Board for Alternative Investment (SBAI) is the global standard-setting agency for the alternative investment industry and guardian of the Alternative Investment Standards.

At the time of passing the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017 in March 2017, the terms of Britain's disengagement were unknown. The outlook was uncertain for the future funding of British scientific research and for the UK's future relationship, as a third country, with the EU for patent protection of innovation, trade in medium- and high-tech goods and industrial contracts issued by European scientific institutions. Opinions differed on whether scientific research and development would be affected by a loss of mobility and international collaboration, or whether Britain's withdrawal from the EU should be seen as an opportunity to expand scientific collaboration. The UK was initially due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019 but the EU agreed to extend the departure date first to 31 October 2019 then to 31 January 2020, at the UK's request.

The white paper mentioned in more general terms: controlling the number of EU nationals coming to the UK; securing the status of EU citizens who are already living in the UK, and that of UK nationals in other member states; protecting and enhancing existing workers‚Äô rights; forging a new partnership with the EU, including a wide reaching free trade agreement, and seeking a mutually beneficial new customs agreement with the EU; and forging free trade relationships across the world. From the outset, policy requirements influencing or determining the withdrawal negotiation were expressed in the Preamble and Articles of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Article 3 mentions the promotion of \\"scientific and technological advance\\" in a context governed by the Union's aims for an internal market, and a highly competitive social market economy. A policy requirement mentioned in the Preamble is promoting economic and social progress for the peoples of the EU member states, taking into account the principle of sustainable development and within the context of the accomplishment of the internal market and of reinforced cohesion and environmental protection. =Human resources in science and engineering = 330x330px In 2013, there were more than 259,000 researchers in the UK (in full-time equivalents). This corresponds to 4,108 researchers per million inhabitants, almost four times the global average of 1,083 per million. About 32,000 non-British EU academics occupy 17% of UK university teaching and research posts. There are over 42,000 international staff (non-UK EU and non- EU nationals) working at the Russell Group universities, a group of 24 research-intensive British universities that include Oxford and Cambridge Universities. International staff make up 25% of the overall workforce, 39% of academics and 48% of staff on research-only contracts at Russell Group universities. Over the period 2008‚Äì2014, the UK produced 15% of the world's most highly cited articles for a share of just 4% of the global research pool. Between 2008 and 2014, 56% of scientific articles published in the UK in internationally catalogued journals had at least one co-author who was based outside the country, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). The majority of these articles were co-authored by Americans (100,537), followed by German, French, Italian and Dutch scientists. These four European countries accounted for a total of 159,619 articles. =Funding of research in science and engineering= Britain's overall research intensity, measured as a percentage of gross domestic product, is comparatively low: 1.63% of GDP in 2013, compared to the EU average of 2.02%. The UK's business enterprise sector performs two-thirds of the total. In 2015, Britain's scientific establishment expressed concern that 'UK investment in research was failing to keep pace with other leading nations and risks eroding the capacity to attract and retain the very best researchers from the UK and overseas'. Gross domestic expenditure on research and development performed by business enterprises in the UK as a share of GDP, 2005‚Äì2013. Other countries are given for comparison. Source of graphic: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 1.2, data from OECD As an EU member state, the UK participates in the European Research Area and it is considered likely that the UK would wish to remain an associated member of the European Research Area, like Norway and Iceland, in order to continue participating in the EU framework programmes.\\"It is likely that the UK would wish to remain an associated member of the European Research Area, like Norway and Iceland, in order to continue participating in the EU framework programmes.\\" All EU members contribute to the budget for each seven-year framework programme for research and innovation, the most recent of these being Horizon 2020, adopted in 2014. British researchers receive EU funding through programmes like Horizon 2020. Access to this money will now be renegotiated with the EU with the UK government committing to make up any shortfall to UK institutions. Once it is no longer a member state, the UK will not be entitled to EU structural funds, which are increasingly being used to finance research-related infrastructure. Over the period of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development (2007‚Äì2013), the UK received ‚Ç¨8.8 billion from the EU, according to a report by the Royal Society citing European Commission data, and Britain contributed ‚Ç¨5.4 billion to this programme. In terms of funding awarded on a competitive basis, the UK was the second-largest recipient of the Seventh Framework Programme after Germany, securing ‚Ç¨6.9 billion out of a total of ‚Ç¨55.4 billion between 2007 and 2013. 330x330px British universities receive a disproportionate share of EU-awarded research grants. For instance, in 2013, the UK received more competitive research grants (close to 1000) from the European Research Council (ERC) than any other EU country; 44% of these grants went to non-nationals based in the UK, the largest number of any EU country. Germany obtained just over 600 ERC grants. This has raised questions about how such funding would be affected by a Brexit. On average, British universities relied on the EU for around 11% of their research income in 2014‚Äì2015. Two-thirds (66%) came from government sources, 4% from British businesses, 13% from British charities and 5% from sources beyond the EU. The EU share can be much higher for the top research universities. For instance, in 2013, the University of Manchester successfully applied for ¬£23 million from the European Regional Development Fund to create a National Graphene Institute. The UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Unit provided a further ¬£38 million. The University of Manchester is participating in the two flagship projects selected for ‚Ç¨1 billion in funding under Horizon 2020's Future and Emerging Technologies programme, namely the graphene project and the human brain project. The chancellor of the University of Oxford, Chris Patten, said in July 2016 that the university received about 40% of its research income from government and that its 'research income will of course fall significantly after we have left the EU unless a Brexit government guarantees to cover the shortfall'. On 13 August 2016, Chancellor Philip Hammond promised that British businesses and universities would have certainty over future funding and advised them to continue bidding for competitive EU funds while the UK remained a member of the EU. He said that all structural and investment fund projects, including agri-environment schemes, signed before the Autumn Statement would be fully funded and that the UK would underwrite the payments for research project funding awarded by the EU to universities participating in Horizon 2020, even when specific projects continued beyond the UK‚Äôs departure from the EU. On 21 November 2016, Prime Minister Theresa May announced an increase in government investment in research and development worth ¬£2 billion a year by 2020 and a new Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund to back priority technologies. On 23 February 2017, the Business Secretary announced a ¬£229 million investment in research and development within the government's new industrial strategy, which is being developed in consultation with stakeholder groups. Of this investment, ¬£126 million is to go towards the creation of 'the world-class' National Graphene Institute at the University of Manchester, graphene having been first isolated at this university in 2004, and ¬£103 million to create a new centre of excellence for life and physical sciences at the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford, which will foster ties between academia and industry. On 20 November 2017, the Prime Minister‚Äôs office and the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy issued a statement announcing an extra ¬£2.3 billion of public money for research and development in 2021/2022, which would raise government expenditure that year to ¬£12.5 billion. The government is planning to work with industry to increase private investment, with the aim of seeing total research spending increase by as much as ¬£80 billion by 2027, to the equivalent of 2.4% of GDP. By 2017, the UK had raised its research effort to 1.67% of GDP, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. =National Health Service= The Brexit Health Alliance was established in June 2017 with Sir Hugh Taylor as chair ‚Äòto safeguard‚Äô the interests of the health service. The 14 participating organisations cover the whole of the UK. The National Health Service is 'facing the worst nursing crisis for the last 20 years', with official figures published in June 2017 showing a 96% drop in less than in a year in the number of nurses from the European Union registering to practice in the UK: 46 European nurses arrived to work in Britain in April 2017, compared with 1,304 in the month after the Brexit referendum. As of February 2018, 62,000 National Health Service (NHS) staff in England were non- British EU nationals, equivalent to 5.6% of all NHS staff. This compares with 12.5% for non-British NHS staff overall, including staff from Asia and Africa. Non-British EU nationals made up almost 10% of doctors in England's hospital and community health services, just over 7% of all nurses and 5% of scientific, therapeutic and technical staff. More than one in three (36%) hospital doctors earned their main medical qualification beyond the UK: 20% in Asia and 9% in the EU. Some 4% of general practitioners qualified in the EU and 13% in Asia. Through the UK's status as an EU member state, British pensioners who have retired to the EU are entitled to have their medical treatment reimbursed in full or in part by the NHS under a reciprocal arrangement. In January 2019, Jeremy Morgan, health spokesman for British in Europe, said that 'if there is no deal, British in Europe calls upon Theresa May and [health secretary] Matt Hancock to guarantee to pay unilaterally for pensioners‚Äô medical treatment under the S1 scheme until it is replaced by bilateral agreements [with EU member states].' = Digital Single Market = In May 2015, the European Commission launched its Digital Single Market strategy. The EU is currently the UK's largest export market for digital services. Post-Brexit, there is a risk that UK service providers, such as broadcasters, platforms providing on-demand content, internet sales and online financial services may lose their passports to EU markets, as service providers need to be headquartered in an EU country to access these markets. =British participation in European institutions= According to a 2017 study by European law firm Fieldfisher, the UK contributes ¬£620 million annually to 67 European institutions. The study observed that 'following Brexit, it is likely that much of the budget will need to be redirected to support functions inside the UK.' The biggest savings will come from the UK no longer having to contribute ¬£470 million towards the running costs of 21 bodies that include the European Parliament, the EU's diplomatic service (the European External Action Service), the European Council, the European Court of Justice and the European Anti-fraud Office. Fieldfisher's Regulatory Group estimates that the British government 'will need to contribute around ¬£35 million annually to part-fund several EU agencies with which the UK will need to maintain a strategic partnership' post-Brexit, The remainder (¬£114 million annually) will need to be invested in the UK counterparts or in new purpose-built UK government agencies, to maintain essential functions formerly carried out on the UK's behalf by the EU agencies. Different EU countries host specialized European agencies. These agencies may be responsible for enforcing particular regulatory regimes, or for pooling knowledge and sharing information. Examples are the European Medicines Agency based in the UK, the European Chemicals Agency based in Finland, the European Aviation Safety Agency based in Germany, the European Space Agency based in France and the European Food Safety Authority based in Italy. There are also three European Supervisory Authorities which are responsible for oversight in the field of financial services. One of the three is based in London, the European Banking Authority. In the white paper published by the Department for Exiting the EU in 2017, the British government stated that, 'as part of exit negotiations, the government will discuss with the EU and Member States our future status and arrangements with regard to these agencies'. According to this white paper, which is cited by the Fieldfisher study, the UK will need to maintain a strategic partnership with some EU agencies. This includes those agencies 'which regulate aviation safety, maintain electricity transfer arrangements and deal with energy regulation, data protection, defence policy, policing and approaches to security and environmental policy'. A third country (that is, a non-EU member state) may participate in certain EU agencies by concluding an international agreement with the EU. These agreements cover issues such as the third country's budgetary contribution and staffing arrangements. In a blog post in July 2016, Merijn Chamon of the Ghent European Law Institute wrote that 'this option would allow the UK to pick and choose but the procedure is very cumbersome, which is also why today very few such agreements with third states have been concluded. For the UK, these agreements could, in theory, be incorporated in the Article 50 agreement, but it is doubtful whether that agreement is the appropriate instrument for such detailed arrangements'. In her Mansion House speech on 2 March 2018, the Prime Minister stated that we will also want to explore with the EU the terms on which the UK could remain part of EU agencies such as those that are critical for the chemicals, medicines and aerospace industries: the European Medicines Agency, the European Chemicals Agency, and the European Aviation Safety Agency'. She went on to say that 'we would, of course, accept that this would mean abiding by the rules of those agencies and making an appropriate financial contribution. I want to explain what I believe the benefits of this approach could be, both for us and the EU. First, associate membership of these agencies is the only way to meet our objective of ensuring that these products only need to undergo one series of approvals, in one country. Second, these agencies have a critical role in setting and enforcing relevant rules. And if we were able to negotiate associate membership, we would be able to ensure that we could continue to provide our technical expertise. Third, associate membership could permit UK firms to resolve certain challenges related to the agencies through UK courts rather than the European Court of Justice'. If the UK leaves the EU Single Market and Customs Union, which was its stated intention as of December 2019, it may not be possible for the UK to obtain associate membership of the EU. In its draft negotiating guidelines published on 7 March 2018, the Council of the European Union stated that 'the Union will preserve its autonomy as regards its decision-making, which excludes participation of the United Kingdom as a third-country to (sic) EU Institutions, agencies or bodies'.  European Court of Justice  The government has said it plans to leave the European Court of Justice. Prime Minister Theresa May stated unequivocally at the Conservative Party Conference in October 2016 that 'we are not leaving [the EU] only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That‚Äôs not going to happen'. The Prime Minister also pledged to curb free movement and indicated that she would seek Single Market access. These goals are, however, incompatible with EU statements that both free movement and ECJ adjudication are non-negotiable prerequisites for Single Market access. Unified Patent Court EU companies currently need to file for patent protection in all 28 member states. The unitary patent package adopted by 25 EU members in 2013 (by all but Croatia, Italy and Spain) is expected to slash procedural fees and translation costs by 85%. The unitary patent package will only apply, however, once the Agreement on a Unified Patent Court enters into force. For that to happen, 13 countries must ratify it, including France, Germany and the UK. By June 2018, 16 countries had ratified the agreement, including France on 14 March 2014 and the UK on 26 April 2018 - but not Germany, meaning that the court has not yet entered into force. In announcing ratification of the Unified Patent Court, the British Minister of Intellectual Property, Sam Gyimah, stated that 'the unique nature of the proposed court means that the UK‚Äôs future relationship with the Unified Patent Court will be subject to negotiation with European partners as we leave the EU'. Some British ministers have expressed concern at the potential loss of innovation and business interest in the UK, if Britain isn't part of the Unified Patent Court after it leaves the EU. Normally, members of the new patent court must be both EU members and members of the European Court of Justice. Even if the European Commission could be persuaded to ignore the requirement for EU membership, the UK would have to remain a member of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). This is not because the patent court would be a conduit for EU law into Britain but because the patent court would occasionally have to refer to the ECJ on matters of European law when assessing patent cases, in order to know which definition to adopt. British judges were heavily involved in developing the procedures for the Unified Patent Court. When it was decided that the Unified Patent Court would be split into three locations, Prime Minister David Cameron 'succeeded in making sure that one of them ‚Äì which will rule on pharmaceuticals and life sciences ‚Äì was in London'. The UK has developed a reputation as a key hub in this area, an argument which helped it to win the bid to host the European Medicines Agency.  European Medicines Agency  The European Medicines Agency, which licenses new drugs, is based in London. The Secretary of Health, Jeremy Hunt, has stated that the UK will leave this agency because it is subject to the European Court of Justice. Nineteen EU countries have offered to host the Agency. On 20 November 2017, the city of Amsterdam in the Netherlands was chosen after several rounds of voting. The agency must move to Amsterdam and take up its operations there by 30 March 2019 at the latest. In September 2018, the European Medicines Agency decided to exclude the UK from all current and future contracts for the assessment of new drugs. This authorisation process is compulsory for all drugs sold in Europe. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency accounted for an estimated 20-30% of all drug assessments in the EU in 2018, earning the MHRA about ¬£14 million a year.  European Chemicals Agency  The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) is based in Helsinki, Finland. It owns and maintains the world‚Äôs most comprehensive database on chemicals. The EU's Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation requires industry to register information on the safety of substances they use in ECHA's central database. By 2018, 13 620 European companies had registered nearly 90 000 chemicals with ECHA that had been manufactured in, or imported into, the EU and European Economic Area. When several companies produce the same chemical, the registration with ECHA is shared between them Were the UK to leave the agency, it would be difficult to determine who owns the data that British companies have submitted to ECHA up to now. In her Mansion House speech in March 2018, the Prime Minister suggested that the UK could retain associate membership of ECHA once it becomes a third country but, as of mid-2018, it was not clear whether such a proposal would be acceptable to the EU. Even if the UK remains in the agency, British producers of chemicals will only be able to access the EU market post- Brexit if they comply with REACH. Since the EU is constantly updating its lists of banned and restricted chemicals, the British and EU regimes will diverge unless the UK regularly copies ECHA‚Äôs decisions on individual chemicals. Regulatory divergence would oblige UK producers wishing to export chemicals to the EU to comply with two sets of rules, adding red tape and pushing up costs.  European Aviation Safety Agency  The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is based in Cologne, Germany. In 2017, the government was reportedly exploring the possibility of becoming an associate member of EASA to ensure that international flights out of the UK are not adversely affected by Brexit. Article 66 of EASA regulations establishes a legal route for a third country to participate in this agency. Were the UK to become an associate member of EASA, it would continue to make a financial contribution to the body but would lose its voting rights. In the case of a domestic dispute over the application of safety regulations, UK courts would have jurisdiction but, according to Article 50 of the same EASA rules, the European Court of Justice would be the ultimate arbitre of EASA rulings.  European Defence Agency  All EU members (except Denmark) are part of the European Defence Agency, which is based in Brussels. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted in November 2017 that 'the UK will no longer be a member of the European Defence Agency or Europol. The UK will no longer be involved in decision-making, nor in planning our defence and security instruments'. In December 2017, the UK was one of 25 EU countries which signed up to the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), the EU's new defence pact. In June 2018, the UK was one of nine EU countries which launched an autonomous European Intervention Initiative, along with Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. The force will be able to deploy troops near Europe's borders in the event of a crisis. EU defence ministers also agreed in June 2018 to fix conditions for third country participation in PESCO projects that would also apply to the UK once it leaves the bloc. In June 2017, the European Commission announced that it was developing a collaborative research programme in innovative defence products and technologies at EU level that would become operational on 1 January 2021 when the EU's next seven-year framework programme for research gets under way. In June 2018, the European Commission proposed endowing the European Defence Fund with ‚Ç¨13 billion over the period 2021-2027 to enable cross-border investments in the latest interoperable technology and equipment in areas such as encrypted software and drone technology. Of this, ‚Ç¨4.1 billion will finance competitive and collaborative research projects, mainly through grants, involving at least three participants from three EU member states. Beyond the research component, ‚Ç¨8.9 billion will be available to co-finance with member states the cost of prototype development and the ensuing certification and testing requirements. In June 2018, the French press agency AFP cited an EU official as saying that 'currently, 80% of research and development in the European Union is done on a national basis. The result is 173 weapons systems that are not interoperable. We cannot let things go on like this.‚Äô Another EU official was cited as saying that 'countries that are not members of the EU and the European Economic Area will not be associated to the European Defence Fund unless a specific agreement is concluded to that aim. The programme is designed to apply as of 1 January 2021 and therefore for a Union of 27 Member States.'  Euratom  The government stated in its white paper of February 2017 that invoking Article 50 to leave the EU would involve leaving the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) as well. Although Euratom is an independent body, it is governed by EU bodies such as the European Commission, the European Council of Ministers and European Court of Justice. In the white paper, the government confirmed that ' the nuclear industry remains of key strategic importance to the UK and leaving Euratom does not affect our clear aim of seeking to maintain close and effective arrangements for civil nuclear cooperation, safeguards, safety and trade with Europe and our international partners. Furthermore, the UK is a world leader in nuclear research and development and there is no intention to reduce our ambition in this important area'. In the government's letter of 29 March 2017 notifying the European Council of the UK‚Äôs intention to withdraw from the EU, Prime Minister Theresa May announced ‚Äòthe UK‚Äôs intention to withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community‚Äô. Euratom‚Äôs flagship project is the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The ITER project involves a consortium made up of China, the EU, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the United States. The project is building an experimental reactor in France that will be powered by nuclear fusion, a technology which produces few pollutants. The EU is financing its 45% share of the ITER construction costs (‚Ç¨2.7 billion over the 2014‚Äì2020 period ) through the EU budget's Multiannual Financial Framework. 'During the forthcoming negotiations, the European Commission is expected to claim the UK‚Äôs share of this amount as a liability towards the EU'. Between 2014 and 2018, Euratom has a total research budget of ‚Ç¨1.6 billion under the Horizon 2020 budget, of which about ‚Ç¨728 million has been set aside for research on nuclear fusion. Of this, ‚Ç¨424 million has been earmarked for EUROfusion, a consortium of universities and national laboratories, primarily for ITER-related research. A further ‚Ç¨283 million will go to the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, the UK's national laboratory for fusion research. The Culham Centre hosts the world's largest magnetic fusion experiment, Joint European Torus (JET), on behalf of its European partners. The JET facilities are used by about 350 European fusion scientists each year. JET has an annual budget of about ‚Ç¨69 million. Of this, 87.5% is provided by the European Commission and the remainder by the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council within the Euratom Treaty. Research is not the only focus of Euratom. As stated in the government's Brexit white paper, 'the Euratom Treaty provides the legal framework for civil nuclear power generation and radioactive waste management for members of the Euratom Community, all of whom are EU Member States. This includes arrangements for nuclear safeguards, safety and the movement and trade of nuclear materials both between Euratom Members such as France and the UK, as well as between Euratom Members and third countries such as the USA'. In 2016, about 21% of the UK's electricity came from nuclear power. The UK ranks second in the EU after France for the number of operational nuclear reactors (15). In its Cooperation on Science and Innovation paper from 2017 on the UK's future partnership with the EU, the Department for Exiting the EU states that 'the UK hopes to find a way to continue working with the EU on nuclear R&D;, including the Joint European Torus (JET) and International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (TER) programmes'.  European Space Agency  The European Space Agency (ESA) has 22 member states and is independent of the EU, even if programmes tend to benefit from EU funding. The Copernicus Earth Observation Programme, for instance, is 70% EU funded. This has raised concerns in the UK space sector as to whether British companies will be entitled to submit tenders for lucrative ESA contracts post-Brexit. The UK is aiming for its space sector to raise its global market share from 6.6% to 10% by 2030. Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage built Sentinel 5P, an air pollution monitoring satellite that was launched in the UK in October 2017 as part of the Copernicus programme. Sentinel 5P is part of a 45.5 million euro contract signed with ESA in 2011. The UK government stated in its future partnership paper on Collaboration on Science and Innovation that it wishes to remain fully involved in Copernicus, Galileo and the Space Surveillance and Tracking programme post-Brexit. Third countries may participate in ESA programmes but current arrangements tend to cover data access and usage, rather than eligibility to apply for large industrial contracts. In June 2018, a majority of EU member states sided with the European Commission in rejecting British demands to remain a full partner in the development of the Galileo satellite once the UK becomes a third country. This means that British companies will be unable to bid for the new round of contracts being issued by the EU. The British Minister of Universities and Science, Sam Gyimah, reacted to the decision by saying that Britain was willing to 'walk away' from the project and develop a rival satellite. The UK is demanding that the EU return the ¬£1 billion invested thus far by the UK in Galileo.  Galileo Security Monitoring Centre  In January 2018, the European Commission announced that the back-up security monitoring centre for Galileo, Europe's version of the Global Positioning System, would be relocated from Britain to Spain as part of the Brexit process. The centre was originally awarded to London in 2010 following a competitive bidding process.  CERN  The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) is an independent intergovernmental organisation, subject to its own treaty. The UK‚Äôs membership of CERN is therefore unaffected by Brexit. Several of CERN‚Äôs member and associate member states are not EU members, and the organisation is headquartered outside the EU, in Switzerland. British citizens will retain the right to be employed by CERN, and British businesses will remain eligible to bid for CERN contracts. CERN‚Äôs core research programme is funded by its member states, but CERN also receives EU grants through the bloc's multi-year framework programmes, including Horizon 2020. CERN member states that neither belong to the EU, nor have special arrangements with the bloc, can participate in CERN-EU research projects but are not entitled to EU funding. British nationals will be entitled to apply for the EU‚Äôs Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellowships as long as CERN receives funding from this scheme. Public comment up to March 2019 =Concerns over future mobility and international scientific collaboration= Scientists in favour of staying in the EU have noted that membership allows researchers to move freely between member states and to work with no restrictions. Immediately after the UK general election 2015, pro-remain scientists founded the grassroots campaign Scientists for EU. A group of leading British scientists wrote a letter to the Times on 22 May 2015 stating that ‚Äòit is not sufficiently known to the public that the EU is a boon to UK science and innovation. Freedom of movement for talent and ambitious EU science funding programmes, which support vital, complex international collaborations, put the UK in a world-leading position'. A Nature poll in March 2016 found that 83% of UK scientists were in favour of remaining in the EU. After the 2016 referendum, hundreds of scientists contacted Scientists for EU voicing concerns about the future of scientific research in the UK after Brexit, many saying they planned to leave the UK. Commenting in 2016, Kurt Deketelaere, secretary-general of the League of European Research Universities in Leuven, Belgium, whose purpose is to influence policy in Europe and to develop best practice through mutual exchange of experience, said that the potential loss of mobility and collaboration was worrying for scientists across Europe, as scientists wished 'to work with the best in their field'. However, for Angus Dalgleish, a cancer and HIV researcher at St George‚Äôs, University of London, who once stood for election as a member of the pro-Brexit UK Independence Party, universities already maintained successful collaborations with non-EU members, so opting out would have 'no negative impact on scientific collaboration whatsoever'. On 18 November 2016, the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee published a report in which it recommended that the Department for Exiting the European Union appoint a departmental Chief Scientific Adviser to 'help ensure that the impact on science and research of various models for Brexit, and the opportunities these provide, is understood and prioritised within the Department'. The Committee also recommended raising the UK's commitment to research to 3% of GDP, the target fixed by the European Union in the Lisbon Strategy in 2000 and reiterated in Europe 2020, 'to demonstrate a determination not only to negotiating [sic] a post-Brexit relationship with the EU that is good for science but also to secure opportunities for science collaboration with markets beyond Europe'. In a press release of 18 November 2016, Scientists for the EU welcomed the report's recommendations but regretted that it portrayed research collaborations beyond the EU as an opportunity of Brexit. 'EU membership has never restricted UK science collaborations outside the EU', the press release stated. 'Rather, EU membership has enhanced UK global outreach via its world-leading programme'. Commenting on the press release, Martin Yuille, Co-Director of the Centre for Integrated Genomic Medical Research in Manchester, said that 'Brexit will not enhance opportunities for collaboration beyond the EU because, as an EU Member State, we already benefit from the global collaboration framework developed over the decades by the EU. The EU has Science and Technology Agreements with 20 countries (including the major economies) and is preparing similar agreements with further countries and regional groupings (e.g. the whole of Africa and the Pacific Rim). The EU is developing a permanent structure of scientific and technological collaboration with 180 countries. All that will need to be replaced by a UK outside the EU'. In its March 2018 report on Brexit, Science and Innovation, the House of Commons' Select Committee on Science and Technology recommended that the Government ask the Migration Advisory Committee to integrate its conclusions regarding the immigration arrangements needed to support science and innovation into a broader agreement with the EU on science and innovation 'by October 2018 ... if a pact is not agreed in late 2018, this will increase risks to retaining and attracting the essential talent that our science and innovation sectors need. =Concerns over future funding of research= A July 2016 investigation by The Guardian suggested that some UK researchers were being discriminated against in funding and research projects after the referendum result. The newspaper reported that European partners were reluctant to employ British researchers due to uncertainties over funding. It cited a confidential survey of the UK's Russell Group universities, a group of 24 institutions renowned for research and academic excellence; in one case, 'an EU project officer recommended that a lead investigator drop all UK partners from a consortium because Britain's share of funding could not be guaranteed'. The uncertainty over future funding for projects stands to harm research in other ways, the same survey suggests. A number of institutions that responded said some researchers were reluctant to carry on with bids for EU funds because of the financial unknowns, while others did not want to be the weak link in a consortium. One university said it had serious concerns about its ability to recruit research fellows for current projects. In February 2017, the ComUE (Consortium of universities and establishments) of the University of Paris Seine issued an invitation to British universities to apply for space on site post-Brexit. The idea for a Paris Seine International Campus on the outskirts of Paris dates back to 2013 but, in light of the UK's impending departure from the EU, ComUE decided to reserve facilities and services for British universities to enable them to develop high-level research and teaching activities on site. Jean-Michel Blanquer, dean and president of ESSEC Business School, a member of ComUE, told the Times Higher Education Supplement that 'it would be a ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù situation for UK universities concerned about losing European funding opportunities and international students'. In a notice posted on the research section of the European Commission on 6 October 2017, UK researchers were informed that, in the event of no bilateral agreement being in place covering arrangements for scientific cooperation after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, UK researchers would no longer be entitled to receive EU funding and would have to leave existing projects. The statement regarding Horizon 2020 funding read as follows, \\"If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU during the grant period without concluding an agreement with the EU ensuring in particular that British applicants continue to be eligible, you will cease to be eligible to receive EU funding (while continuing, where possible, to participate) or be required to leave the project on the basis of Article 50 of the grant agreement.\\" In its March 2018 report on Brexit, Science and Innovation, the House of Commons' Select Committee on Science and Technology recalled that the UK needed to commit by October 2018 to contributing to the EU's next Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2021-2027), or risk compromising its role as a 'science superpower'. The report stated that 'we are concerned that the Government‚Äôs default position does not appear to be that the UK will participate in Framework Programme 9. While the details of the Programme have not yet been agreed, the Government should state clearly that it intends to participate ... Specifically, the Government should state clearly in its response to this report that it intends to secure Associated Country status for Framework Programme 9'. On 21 July 2018, the newly appointed Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, suggested that the UK might not honour the withdrawal agreement that guarantees continued funding of EU programmes until the end of Horizon 2020 in December 2020 through a transitional arrangement. According to a technical note published by the government in August outlining the likely consequences of a no-deal Brexit for the UK's participation in Horizon 2020, UK institutions would no longer be eligible for three Horizon 2020 funding lines after 29 March 2019: European Research Council (ERC) grants, Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie actions (MSCA), and SME instrument (SMEi) grants for small innovative businesses under a no-deal Brexit scenario. Mike Galsworthy, co- founder and director of Scientists for EU, described this document as 'a huge blow'. He commented that 'these three lines represent 45% of the UK‚Äôs receipts to date from Horizon 2020. If the UK is currently winning ‚Ç¨1.283 billion each year from Horizon 2020, then a no-deal Brexit will cost UK research ‚Ç¨577.35 million (¬£520.7 million) a year in lost opportunity to access these high-value grants. By far the most critical of those funding lines is the ERC. The UK has won ‚Ç¨4.73 billon to date from Horizon 2020 overall, with ‚Ç¨1.29bn of that in the form of ERC grants, ‚Ç¨0.7 billion in the form of MSCA grants and ‚Ç¨0.14 billion in SME Instrument grants. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, UK Research and Innovation would take over the funding of projects that currently receive payments from the European Commission. However, Dr Galsworthy observes that this would not allow UK research project coordinators to pay their partners in EU countries, forcing the UK partner to step aside from any coordinating role. The UK has coordinated more Horizon 2020 research projects than any other EU country. Tim Hardman, managing director of Niche Science & Technology, said in January 2019 that his business was planning to set up an office inside the EU post-Brexit. His firm has 18 employees, many of whom are scientists with PhDs. The company runs clinical trials and research into medical drugs from its base in London. He said that the firm had grown over the last 20 years thanks to EU grant funding, 'which the firm is reconciled to losing'. =Concerns over future market access= After the British referendum in June 2016, Carlos Ghosn, Chief Executive Officer of Japanese vehicle manufacturer Nissan, expressed doubts about the company's future in the UK if the country left the Single Market. After receiving written assurances from the government, Ghosn confirmed in October 2016 that its Qashqai and X-Trail SUV ranges would be built at its Sunderland plant but added that the firm would want to 're-evaluate the situation' once the final Brexit deal was concluded. The Business Secretary told the House of Commons on 31 October 2016 that the government had assured Nissan that it would continue its longstanding programme of support for the competitiveness of the automotive sector, work with the automotive sector to ensure that more of the supply chain could locate to the UK and maintain a strong commitment to research and development into ultra-low emission vehicles. He also said that, in its negotiations to leave the EU, the government would ensure that trade between the UK and EU member states was 'free and unencumbered'. As a large net contributor to the EU budget, Britain hosts one of the Airbus plants in Broughton. There is concern that the UK may lose this leverage post-Brexit. Airbus pays UK suppliers about ¬£4 billion per year and employs 15,000 people directly in the UK. About 4,000 of these employees design the wings for Airbus planes at Filton in Bristol. Another 6,000 workers build more than 1,000 wings each year at Broughton in Flintshire for commercial Airbus aircraft. In September 2017, Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS, the trade organisation for companies in the UK aerospace, defence, security and space sectors, expressed concern that, post-Brexit, 'there could be a long-term erosion of Britain‚Äôs competitiveness and that big projects will not be allocated to the UK'. Unless the UK strikes bilateral agreements with third countries before leaving the EU to replace those agreements established by the EU with these countries, or this area is covered by the Brexit agreement, British airline carriers will not be entitled to fly to third countries after 29 March 2019. AstraZeneca, one of the UK's largest pharmaceutical companies, has decided to prioritise new batch release site in Europe, and consequently puts a hold on further investments at its UK‚Äôs Macclesfield site. GlaxoSmithKline, another large medical market player, has made a similar public announcement, that they will construct batch release sites in Europe, due to it being a requirement under EU law. The implementation of GSK's European laboratories will take at least 18 months,Polymermedics - Plastic Injection Moulder - How Brexit Will Affect the Medical Industry https://polymermedics.com/blog/guide/how-brexit-will-affect- the-medical-industry/ says Phil Thomson, GSK‚Äôs senior vice president of global communications, and adds that the latest estimates for GSK‚Äôs additional costs, in case of hard-Brexit, lie between ¬£60- and ¬£70 million. Senior executive at the EU arm of Eisai, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, David Jefferys, states that they are ‚Äúnot making any new investments in the UK until there is clarity‚Äù. Quote reported by the Guardian. In January 2019, Dyson, the British designer and manufacturer of hair dryers and vacuum cleaners, announced it was moving the company headquarters to Singapore, months after Singapore concluded a free trade agreement with the EU. Dyson has 12,000 employees worldwide, including 4,500 in the UK where the company has a research and development unit. The company denied it was moving its headquarters to Singapore for tax reasons or in relation to Brexit. The founder and CEO, Sir James Dyson, has been a vocal advocate of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. By the end of 2018, a number of large tech firms had relocated their headquarters from the UK to the continent, including Sony and Panasonic. A January 2019 survey of 1,200 British firms by the Institute of Directors found that 16% of firms had either activated relocation plans or were planning to do so and that a further 13% of firms were considering the move, in order to guarantee continued access to EU markets post-Brexit. Among exporting firms, the proportion rose to two- thirds.  Potential effect of tariff barriers on high-tech trade  In order to ensure continued unfettered access to the EU's internal market, the UK could choose to remain in the European Economic Area (like Iceland and Norway) or to conclude a number of bilateral treaties with the EU covering the provisions of the Single Market (Swiss model) but this would oblige the UK to adhere to the European Union's four fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of movement within the EU. If the UK leaves the current Customs Union when it exits the bloc, it will no longer benefit from the EU‚Äôs preferential trade agreements with more than 60 third countries, including Canada, Israel, Japan, Mexico (agreement revised in 2018), the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Switzerland and Turkey. Under this scenario, the UK would need to negotiate its own free trade deals with all of these countries over a number of years. On 22 May 2018, the European Commission opened negotiations for bilateral free trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand. The EU trades with an additional 24 countries on the basis of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, including the United States of America, Brazil and China. If no deal is concluded with the EU, the UK will have to fall back on WTO rules on tariffs post-Brexit for its trade with the EU and with countries benefiting from free trade deals with the EU. However, there are no default terms that would permit the UK to trade on WTO rules immediately after leaving the EU, according to Anneli Howard, a specialist in EU and competition law at Monckton Chambers in the UK. Other WTO members have blocked the UK from falling back on existing tariffs and tariff-free quotas under the EU's schedule, so that is not an option. Under a no-deal scenario, the UK would, thus, need to produce its own schedule for both services and each of the more than 5,000 product lines covered in the WTO agreement before getting all163 WTO member states to agree to it; as of 27 January 2019, 23 WTO states had raised objections to the UK‚Äôs draft schedule.  Potential effect of non-tariff barriers on high-tech trade  A March 2017 report by the House of Lords' European Union Committee concluded that non-tariff barriers post-Brexit could pose as much of a barrier to trade in goods as tariffs. It stated that both applying rules of origin and operating to two separate regulatory standards‚Äîfor the domestic and EU markets‚Äîwould be costly for UK businesses. The report analysed several high- tech sectors. 30x30px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0. ¬© Crown copyright. Tom Williams, chief operating officer of Airbus‚Äôs commercial planes unit, cautioned in 2016 against erecting barriers to the free movement of people and parts across its European sites (in Broughton, Toulouse and Hamburg), as the British plant is part of an EU value chain. 'We need a situation that is no less favourable than now', he said. 'When I build a set of wings in Broughton and send them to (the Airbus plant in) Toulouse , I don‚Äôt need a thousand pages of documents and tariffs'. = Rules of origin = Goods imported into a territory that is not part of a customs union must follow ‚Äòrules of origin‚Äô, a procedure which determines where a product and its components were made, in order to levy the correct customs duty. The House of Lords' European Union Committee observed in March 2017 that rules of origin would apply to trade post-Brexit, whether the UK concluded a free trade agreement with the EU or traded with the EU under the rules of the World Trade Organization. ‚ÄòApplying rules of origin will generate significant additional administration, and therefore costs and delays, to UK businesses‚Äô, the committee's report stated. = Standards and regulations = In his submission to the House of Lords' European Union Committee, Steve Elliott, Chief Executive Officer of the Chemical Industries Association, highlighted the importance of the EU‚Äôs Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) Regulations for the chemicals industry and expressed the view that the level of UK-EU trade was such that ‚Äòwe would need to continue‚Äô to comply with the EU‚Äôs Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation. Chris Hunt, Director General and Company Secretary of the UK Petroleum Industry Association said that, as the European Committee for Standardisation was open to non-EU members, Brexit ‚Äòshould make no difference‚Äô to the UK‚Äôs membership and influence. Concerning the downstream petroleum sector, Mr Hunt stated that he would be ‚Äòvery keen to ensure that we stick with the COMAH Regulations‚Äô. Michael Tholen, Director of Upstream Policy, Oil and Gas UK, stated that the EU had ‚Äòno direct remit over the precise activities of oil and gas extraction offshore‚Äô but that the EU did influence the upstream industry through environmental standards and energy market standards. Through the Whole Vehicle Type Approval system, the EU sets standards for road vehicles which permit cars to travel or be sold across the EU without further inspections. The British Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders told the House of Lords' Committee that ‚Äòthe validity of existing type approvals issued by the Vehicle Certification Agency once the UK has left the EU‚Äô required ‚Äòurgent legal clarification‚Äô. Mr Paul Everitt, Chief Executive Officer of the Aerospace and Defence Sector Group, told the committee that it is through the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) ‚Äòthat we gain access to all of our major markets, whether it is the US, China, Japan or elsewhere‚Äô. For this reason, continued membership of EASA was ‚Äòour number one ask of the UK Government‚Äô. In the food and beverages sector, Agra Europe observed that, in areas such as food labelling and pesticide residues, ‚Äòany significant divergence from EU standards in these areas could make UK goods illegal on the EU market‚Äô. The House of Lords' European Union Committee heard in March 2017 that, in the pharmaceutical industry, UK standards would need to be recognised as equivalent by the EU as a pre-requisite for ongoing EU trade. Moreover, regulatory harmonisation and conformity to common labelling requirements would increase the production costs for British pharmaceuticals. Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, chair of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the UK body that would take over from the European Medicines Agency, told the House of Lords in January 2017 that 'one of the biggest worries' he had about setting up a stand-alone regulator in post-Brexit Britain was that the UK would be 'at the back of the queue' for new drugs. Professor Paul Workman, president of the UK Institute of Cancer Research, expressed similar concerns. Since pharmaceutical companies sought regulatory approval for new drugs in the biggest markets first, he said, these companies would only approach the UK after the European Union, United States of America and Japan. He estimated that this could mean a delay of two years in new drug breakthroughs becoming available to British patients. Tim Hardman, managing director of Niche Science & Technology, which runs clinical trials and research into medical drugs from its base in London, commented in January 2019 that 'Britain has been at the forefront of developing the EU‚Äôs regulations. Now we are going to be a backwater with no influence at all'.

Life Born in London, he was the eldest child of Joseph Kirkup, a jeweller and diamond merchant there. He was admitted a student of the Royal Academy in 1809, and obtained a medal in 1811 for a drawing in its antique school. He became at this period acquainted with William Blake and Benjamin Haydon. Grave of Seymour Stocker in Livorno About 1816 Kirkup began to suffer from pulmonary weakness, and; after his father's death, visited Italy. He eventually settled there, living some time at Rome, where his friend Charles Eastlake was studying. There he knew John Keats (but missed his funeral on 26 February 1821, ill in bed) and in 1822 attended the funeral of Percy Bysshe Shelley. At Florence he lived for many years in a house on the River Arno, adjoining the Ponte Vecchio. Kirkup became a leader of a literary circle in Florence. He collected a library, of which a catalogue was printed in 1871, and maintained a copious correspondence. Walter Savage Landor, Robert and Elizabeth Browning, Giovanni Aubrey Bezzi, Edward John Trelawny, Joseph Severn were his friends. As a keen student of Dante, he was a disciple of Gabriele Rossetti. On Italian unification, Kirkup was created cavaliere of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus; he subsequently affected the title \\"barone\\". He was short, and good-looking as a young man; in later life, eccentric in his dress and habits, and deaf. He was a believer in spiritualism, and a follower of the medium Daniel Dunglas Home. Kirkup died at 4 Via Scali del Ponte Nuovo, Livorno, where he had lived since 1872, on 3 January 1880, and was buried on 5 January in the British cemetery there. Works Dante Alighieri, 1859 lithograph, after Seymour Kirkup, after a fresco attributed to Giotto Kirkup was a capable artist, but practised painting as a dilettante, He sent to the Royal Academy in 1833 a picture \\"Cassio\\", and in 1836 a lady's portrait. He also published etchings. He drew many portraits of his friends, including Trelawny and the journalist John Scott, and in 1844 made a self-portrait. In 1840 Kirkup, Bezzi, and the American Henry Wilde, had permission to search for the portrait of Dante, painted according to tradition by Giotto, in the chapel of the Palazzo del Podest√† in Florence. On 21 July 1840 they found it, and Kirkup made a drawing and tracing, before restoration work in 1841. The Arundel Society issued a reproduction from Kirkup's sketch, which was also engraved by P. Lasinio. Kirkup gave the tracing to Rossetti, who handed it on to his son Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and it was sold after the latter's death. Kirkup made some of the designs for Lord Vernon's edition of Dante's works. Family Kirkup had a daughter, Imogene, by Regina Ronti of Florence, who died 30 October 1856, aged 19; she married Teodoro Cioni of Livorno and died in 1878, leaving two children. On 16 February 1875, at age 87, Kirkup married Paolina Carboni, aged 22, daughter of Pasquale Carboni, English vice-consul at Rome. After he died she married Signor Morandi of Bologna.

Biography Cook was the son of Alfred Bramwell Cook and Dorothy Frances Cook (n√©e Money). He was born in Gujarat, India, where his father was a Salvation Army missionary and doctor, and spent most of his first 16 years there. He was educated at Breeks Memorial School in Tamil Nadu from 1942 to 1951, apart from a year at St Andrew's College in Christchurch in 1947‚Äì48, before completing his secondary education at Christchurch Boys' High School in 1952 and 1953. After a year at Canterbury University College, he went on to the University of Otago, graduating MB ChB in 1959. Cook married Shirley Ann Hay in 1958, and the couple went on to have three children. Cook spent his working life from 1960 to 2002 at hospitals in Christchurch, apart from five years in London, England, and Michigan, USA, between 1964 and 1969. He was a clinical lecturer at the Christchurch School of Medicine from 1973 to 2003. Specialising in gastroenterology, Cook's main area of expertise was in the diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease, and in a study between 1970 and 1999 he and his co-workers showed that the prevalence of the disease in New Zealand was up to seven times greater than had previously been diagnosed. Cook served on the executive of the New Zealand Society of Gastroenterology between 1970 and 1978, and was its president from 1974 to 1976. He was patron of the Coeliac Society of New Zealand, and held advisory roles with various bodies including the Department of Health, the New Zealand Medical Association, and the Nutrition Society of New Zealand. Active in the Salvation Army, Cook did voluntary work for that organisation from 1974. In later years he served as archivist for the New Zealand Society of Gastroenterology, and wrote a number of books and papers on New Zealand medical history and the history of the Salvation Army in New Zealand. Cook died in Christchurch on 3 March 2017. Honours and awards Cook became a Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians in 1973.

Sanchez was born in Spain and immigrated to Cuba at a young age. There, he worked as a dishwasher and laborer before moving to the United States. He was employed by Richard Nixon from 1962 to about 1980. The famously reserved Nixon developed a close relationship with Sanchez and once described him as a member of his family. Early life Sanchez was born in A Coru√±a, Spain. In 1946 he immigrated to Cuba where he worked as a dishwasher and laborer. In 1950 he emigrated, again, to Florida in the United States. Career =Early years with the Nixons= Sanchez began working for Richard and Pat Nixon in 1962 after being referred to the couple by Nixon family friend Bebe Rebozo. Sanchez and his wife Fina moved into the Nixons' 12-room apartment at 810 Fifth Avenue in New York City. Nixon would later describe the Sanchezes as \\"members of our family in a very special way\\". Twelve years later, when asked by a reporter if he would continue working for Nixon after he left office, Sanchez responded \\"the boss will not need to ask me. Wherever he goes in three years from now, he knows I will go with him\\". Manolo Sanchez, third from left, presents Richard Nixon with a cake at his 61st birthday party in 1974 at the San Diego home of Walter Annenberg. On January 15, 1967, Nixon held a dinner at his home during which he decided to run for president of the United States in 1968. In attendance were Pat Nixon, the Nixon's children, Nixon's longtime secretary Rose Mary Woods, and Manolo and Fina Sanchez. All attendees, except Pat Nixon, encouraged him to seek the Republican nomination. =White House years= Sanchez moved to Washington with the Nixons during the presidency of Richard Nixon, and lived with Fina in a suite on the third floor of the Executive Residence of the White House. Sanchez, along with the president's physician Major-General Walter Tkach and four United States Secret Service agents, accompanied Nixon during his unannounced 4:40 a.m. visit to the Lincoln Memorial on May 8, 1970, during which he met students protesting the Vietnam War. Nixon reportedly woke Sanchez at 4:22 in the morning and inquired if he'd \\"ever seen the Lincoln Memorial at night? Get your clothes on, we'll go!\\" At the memorial, Nixon toured Sanchez inside the sanctum and described the inscriptions; the pair were eventually approached by a group of about 30 protesters and spent the next two hours speaking with them. After White House personnel became aware Nixon had left the building unannounced, Ron Ziegler mounted a mission to retrieve him. After recovering the president, and during the return trip to the White House, Nixon insisted on stopping at the United States Capitol, where he took his former seat in the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives and instructed Sanchez to make a speech. Sanchez spoke of his pride in being a citizen of the United States and Nixon and some female cleaners who were present applauded. One of the women present, Carrie Moore, asked Nixon to sign her bible, which he did, and holding her hand told her that his mother \\"was a saint\\" and \\"you be a saint too\\". White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman would later describe the incident in his diary as \\"the weirdest day yet\\". During his last years in the White House, Nixon became increasingly dependent on Sanchez, and the two developed a constructed language \\"sometimes using words that only the two of them understood\\". A jury summons Sanchez received in 1972 prompted a personal letter to the jury commissioner from John Ehrlichman for Sanchez to be excused from service \\"in order that he can be available to the president\\". Despite his loyalty to Nixon, Sanchez was known to have disagreed with the president on several occasions. During one incident, in 1973, Nixon expressed frustration to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Russell E. Train about overly cumbersome environmental regulations, citing the instance of mangrove trees at his property in Key Biscayne, Florida, which he couldn't cut down, before turning to Sanchez and asking \\"isn't that right\\"? Sanchez reportedly replied: =Post-presidency= He continued working for Richard and Pat Nixon at their post-presidency home in San Clemente, California. Sanchez was alone with Nixon when the latter suffered a near-fatal relapse after emerging from surgery for phlebitis in 1974. Before slipping into unconsciousness, Nixon told Sanchez \\"Manolo, I don't think I'm going to get out of here alive\\". After Nixon received a pardon from Gerald Ford, the Associated Press intercepted Sanchez while he was grocery shopping for Nixon in Palm Springs to get Nixon's reaction. Sanchez replied that, By 1980, after nearly two decades serving the Nixons, Manolo Sanchez retired with his wife, Fina, and returned to Spain. Personal life Sanchez was naturalized a U.S. citizen in 1968; Nixon sponsored his application, attended the ceremony, and took the oath of allegiance with him. Sanchez married his wife, Fina, in Spain. In popular culture In the 1995 film Nixon, Sanchez is portrayed by Tony Plana. During one scene in the film, Nixon asks Sanchez what he thinks of John F. Kennedy, to which Sanchez replies \\"he made me see the stars\\". In a subsequent interview, Oliver Stone explained that the quote was actually attributed to Robert McNamara and that he assigned it to Sanchez in the film as a joke; Sanchez was known to have intensely disliked Kennedy. In the 2008 film Frost/Nixon, Sanchez was portrayed by Eloy Casados.

In 2016, CfS agreed to a joint membership scheme with Momentum, a UK-wide grassroots movement supportive of Jeremy Corbyn and his leadership of the Labour Party.  History  CfS was originally established in 1994 to campaign against the removal of Clause IV from the Labour Party's constitution. By 2012, it was one of the only remaining ideological-based groupings in the party but Gerry Hassan and Eric Shaw, writing that year, claimed that CfS \\"has few members, little organisational presence and has had a negligible influence on the direction of the party\\". CfS played a key role in organising Neil Findlay and Katy Clark's leadership bid in the 2014 Scottish Labour Party leadership election. Though unsuccessful, CfS claims the campaign \\"built the foundations for Jeremy [Corbyn]'s campaign just a few months later\\" by \\"giving many new, young volunteers experience and a network of contacts across the country that would help quickly mobilise an effective campaign\\". In 2016, Scottish Labour Young Socialists founded in 2015 became CfS's official youth wing. In 2017, five CfS members won seats on the Scottish Labour Party's national executive. They called for the then Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, to pursue a socialist agenda and work more closely with Jeremy Corbyn's team. CfS endorsed Richard Leonard to be the next leader of Scottish Labour following the resignation of Kezia Dugdale in August, 2017. Leonard went on to win the leadership with 56.7% of the vote.

He entered politics in later life, elected to the senate where between 1901 and 1912 he represented Finist√®re.  Life  Jules Marie Armand de Cuverville was born at Allineuc, a small village a short distance inland from Saint-Brieuc in Brittany. His father was Louis-Paul de Cuverville who represented the locality on the monarchist benches in the National Assembly between 1849 and 1853. Louis- Paul's family was descended from the lords of the manor at Maucomble in Normandy, some of whom had been Squires to French kings. Other kinsmen included sailors and naval officers, such as his grandfather, the Rear Admiral Louis-Hyacinthe Cavelier de Cuverville. Jules Marie attended school at Saint Sauveur de Redon and the lyc√©e in Rennes before entering naval college in 1850. He emerged in 1852 and participated at the Siege of Sevastopol (1854‚Äì55), where he was badly wounded. There were further missions in Africa and in the Crimea. He served in Algeria as deputy to Vice-admiral de Gueydon between 1871 and 1873. He was briefly given command of the avisos \\"Kleber\\" and \\"Cuvier\\" before being seconded to the diplomatic service, serving as naval attache at the French embassy in London during the middle 1870s. He then returned to France, serving aboard the Infernet as a commander with the South Atlantic Naval Division between 1875 and 1879, and promoted to the rank of ship's captain in 1878, taking command of a succession of training ships. He was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in 1888 and appointed a member of the Admiralty Council. Between 1890 and 1892 he served as head of the North Atlantic Naval division and was involved in the Pacification of Dahomey. He became a vice-admiral in 1893, and then Maritime Prefect for Cherbourg, a member of the Upper Admiralty Council, commender of the Reserve Mediterranean Squadron in 1897 and inspector-general of the marine in 1898. He was Chief of Staff of the French Navy between 1898 and 1899. Jules de Cuverville was elected to the senate on 31 March 1901 in a bye-election caused by the death of the previous incumbent, General Ars√®ne Lambert, who had died. He was re- elected in the general election of 4 January 1903. He lost his seat to Maurice Fenoux by a narrow margin on 7 January 1912, however. Brittany, then as subsequently, was relatively conservative in religious terms, and during the summer of 1902 Jules de Cuverville was among those at Le Folgo√´t, vigorously opposing the closure of the school of the Daughters of the Holy Spirit, and the concomitant expulsion of the nuns there. The sisters had fallen foul of the anti-congragationist legislation which was part of the Paris-based government's determined pursuit of La√Øcit√© (separation of secular and religious institutions). A friend and political ally of Jacques Piou, he joined the Popular Liberal Action (political party), becoming one of its most passionate supporters. He was appointed a party vice-president in 1907. Deeply Catholic and steadfast in his commitment to the Third Republic, Admiral Count de Cuverville had two principal political priorities: defence of the church and support for the navy. Several months after losing his seat in the senate, Jules de Cuverville was crushed by a truck while crossing the street in Paris. He survived long enough to be taken to his home at 15, rue Dugay-Trouin, but died a few hours later.

In August 2016, SPLM-IO officials detained a charted Kenyan chartered plane when it landed in Yuai. In February 2017, Yuai, which had been peaceful throughout the South Sudanese Civil War, began experiencing clashes. The SPLA took Yuai without heavy fighting on February 15, 2017, but the SPLA-IO launched unsuccessful an attack to retake the town the next morning. The SPLA-IO attacked Yuai on March 12, 2017 but was repulsed. The SPLA-IO claimed to have killed 93 and destroyed a tank and two other military vehicles while losing 5 killed and 9 wounded in the attack, while the SPLA claimed they killed 23 and injured 50 without any losses.

Plot 1991, Saint Petersburg, last days of the USSR. Director of a greengrocery Sergei Nenashev earns money not only with trade, but also with fraud. However, he acts as a kind of Robin Hood: the victims of his scams are government officials, and other, often much more dangerous crooks. Some time ago, Nenashev worked at a secret research institution where he authored a number of technical innovations to which application was not found in the conditions of the Soviet economy. However now Nenashev with his associates expertly use these \\"gadgets\\" in fraud. As a result of a \\"transaction\\", a batch of \\"Parabolic antenna's\\", fake, of course, were sold to Azerbaijanis who trade flowers on the market. A little later, having received incriminating videos of the intimate kind featuring businessman Baev (orgy with prostitutes) and theater director Arkhipov (homosexual act with a young waiter), Nenashev starts to blackmail both of them. Attempts by the police to arrest Nenashev while he is getting the money are thwarted: each time Sergei finds an ingenious way to outwit the police. Nenashev has a teenage daughter from his first marriage, but after the divorce, he is alone. Suddenly, at the hairdresser Sergei meets Nastya, a very beautiful girl from a simple working family. Parents of Nastya perceive \\"speculator\\" Nenashev's flirting in a very negative way, Nastya herself also believes that she is just another \\"plaything\\" for the cynical rich man. However, a longer acquaintance with Nenashev assures Nastya that Sergei sincerely loves her, and then reciprocal feelings awaken in the girl. Trouble comes from an unexpected side. Exiled for petty theft Kostya, Nenashev's assistant, finds the Azerbaijanis with fake antennas and their benefactor - powerful mafioso \\"Prince\\" Gilya. \\"Prince\\", wanting to punish Nenashev who deceived him, orders him to pay a huge sum of money, taking as hostage Sergei's daughter. Having sold all the property and taking money in debt, Nenashev collects the necessary amount, but \\"Prince\\" requires a new redemption, this time in a foreign currency. So without letting go of Nenashev's daughter, mafia takes Nastya as hostage too. Realizing that he alone can not do anything, Nenashev refers to the police, which has been on the hunt of the \\"Prince\\" for a long time. Employees of the department for combating organized crime agree to help Nenashev, but in return he must write a written statement describing all the occurrences of his fraud. Sergei personally writes it, receives the dollars from the police and goes to meet the \\"Prince\\". During the transfer of money a special police unit storms the suburban cottage of the mafioso. The \\"Prince\\" is arrested, and his chief henchman \\"Mormon\\" dies in the crossfire and Kostya who betrayed Nenashev. Nastya and Nenashev's daughter are released, and Sergei wants to take them home. However, Major Kuzmin has Nenashev's confession and is ready to arrest him but... in response he receives the latest \\"trick\\" of the genius swindler. Sergei wrote the text with invisible ink, the evidence has disappeared, and now the stunned Major only possesses an empty sheet of paper.

In 1886 Andak received the Order of the Crown of Johor (DPMJ) (Second Class) and the honorific title of Dato‚Äô Sri Amar DiRaja.

For twenty years he was advisor to Sultan Abu Bakar (Sultan of Johor 1862-1895) and Sultan Ibrahim (Sultan of Johor 1895-1959). Andak's influence over Sultan Abu Bakar lead to the Sultan becoming increasingly reluctant to accept British advice. Andak drafted the Johor Constitution, the first to be written by any of the Malay States, and which became law in 1894. Andak was the founder of the Pakatan Belajar Mengajar Pengetahuan Bahasa (\\"Language Knowledge Teaching Pact), a literary society which increased the usage of the Malay language and made it the official language of the government; the body was also responsible for introducing neologisms expressing new ideas of governance brought with British influence.

Cecil Clementi Smith wrote of him \\"as a clever little fellow but an absolute nobody among the Malay aristocrats\\". Other descriptions include \\"corrupt\\" and \\"a mischievous little dog\\". Frank Swettenham denigrated him as ‚Äúa bad adviser for anyone, quite unscrupulous... and dangerous because he speaks English and has to do with Europeans all his life.\\" Eventually he was dismissed by Sultan Ibrahim and sent into forced exile in London in April 1909 with an annual pension of ¬£1,000. In England Andak oversaw the education of Sultan Ibrahim's sons Ismail (who succeeded his father as Sultan), Abu Bakar and Ahmad while they were attending schools in London. =Personal life= Andak married twice, firstly to Che' Lembek, who died in 1885 and with whom he had a daughter, Rahmah.

The first rector of the college was the Polish Jesuit priest Jakub Wujek.

The institution experienced a special momentum in the 18th century, when a large boarding school, called Convictus Nobilium, was built next to the church and university, where students were received regardless of their ethnic origin. Since 1698 until 1786 the Academy evolved into Universitas Claudiopolitana (see the see the cover of the book from 1742 by Andreas Matis entitled Peregrinus Catholicus de peregrina unitaria religione), and later even having the four classical faculties: Philosophy (since 1581), as a prerequisite for Theology (since 1581, re-organized in 1712/1767), Law (1774), and Medicine (since 1775/1776)\\"History of UBB\\" .

In 1753 Universitas Claudiopolitana was re-organized as an imperial university, more and more under the influence of the state, rather than the Jesuits. Following 1773, after the suppression of the Society of Jesus, Empress Maria-Theresa further developed Universitas Claudiopolitana (with teaching both in Latin and German). Indeed, during its maximum development, Universitas Claudiopolitana had the four classical faculties: Philosophy (since 1581), as a prerequisities for Theology (since 1581, re-organized in 1712/1767), Law (1774), and Medicine (since 1775/1776). Due to the reforms in the empire, the Universitas Claudiopolitana was transformed in 1786 into a semiuniversity institution (e.g., institution, which made the connection between secondary studies and university studies, for example, having the right to confer superior titles of baccalaureus, even magister, but not doctor). Thus, the Universitas Claudiopolitana was followed after 1786 by two institutions with a semiuniversity statute: (a) the Surgical-Medical Institute and (b) the Academy of Law (1786-1850 and re-founded in 1863). Then, starting with 1872, the Hungarian Royal University of Kolozsv√°r was founded, with teaching in Hungarian, which included the two semiuniversity institutions already existing in the city.

It was a collegiate church from the 12th century until 1840. The present building is largely 13th-century and is designated as Grade I listed.  History  A church was mentioned at Hestrebe in the Domesday Book of 1086. The church was given to Salisbury Cathedral by Henry I in about 1115, together with the church of Godalming, Surrey, and lands lying beside the two churches, to form a prebend. Shortly after this the church became collegiate, with the head of the college the canon who held the prebend at the Cathedral. A charter granted by bishop Josceline (or Jocelin) between 1150 and 1160 established four canons at Heytesbury. Their income included tithes from Tytherington, where there was a chapel, and from Horningsham; the churches of Hill Deverill and Swallowcliffe; and land at Wilton. From about 1220 the prebend of Heytesbury was annexed to the deanery of Salisbury, thus the Dean of Salisbury was also Dean of Heytesbury. Most collegiate churches were abolished in 1547 as part of the Reformation but Heytesbury continued until it was suppressed, along with the other remaining non-residential deaneries, by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1840.  Architecture and interior  The large cruciform church dates from the 13th century, although a fragment of earlier work survives: one pier of the north aisle, with a scalloped capital, is partly from the late 12th century. The low tower over the crossing was completed in the 14th century and the clerestory was added in the mid-15th. The south chapel, founded c. 1316, is dedicated to St Catherine. In the north transept, Walter Hungerford founded a chapel in 1421; the 16th-century stone screen survives. The tower has six bells: the tenor is from c. 1460, alongside two from the 17th century and two from the 18th. The vestry and the gabled south porch are from the 19th century. Restoration in 1864-7 was by William Butterfield and included rebuilding of the north and south aisles; interior work included the addition of a coloured marble font in the south aisle, new pews, a polychrome tiled floor, and stained glass by Alexander Gibbs. Pevsner criticised the restoration, describing the buildings as \\"A large and impressive church, but an over-restored one [...] which makes it externally more rewarding from a distance than from near by and internally disappointing in spite of its undeniable grandeur\\". However, he added that \\"Most of the glass of Butterfield's restoration is good and characteristic. Pale colours, good leading.\\" The organ was installed in 1854 by J.W. Walker, having been moved from St Mary's, Bermondsey, London. It was taken down during Butterfield's restoration and reconstructed in 1867 in a new position, with new casefronts in deal. The building was designated as Grade I listed in 1968.  Parish  Dependant churches and chapels of Heytesbury were those nearby at Tytherington, Knook, Hill Deverill, Horningsham, and the more distant church at Swallowcliffe, some to the south. In 1885 the benefice of Heytesbury-with- Tytherington was united with Knook, and this union was reaffirmed in 1970. In 1976 the parishes of Sutton Veny and Norton Bavant were added. Since 2000 the church has been served by the Upper Wylye Valley team. Parish registers survive from 1653 and are held by the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre at Chippenham.

Edible mushrooms have variety of benefits when consumed. Some healthy factors that edible mushrooms can be related to humans are that they have essential nutrients we need for a healthy life, including protein, vitamins B, C and D, and selenium (which helps prevent cancer). They are a good source of iron, copper, riboflavin, niacin and contain dietary fiber. One portobello mushroom can contain more potassium than a banana. In many cultures, mushroom picking is an important tradition and can be a substantial source of income. In the Pacific Northwest of the United States, it is estimated that the value of the yearly mushroom harvest in a forest can equal the value of lumber produced from that same forest in some situations. According to the ‚ÄúMenus of Change‚Äù initiative of The Culinary Institute of America and the Harvard School of Public Health Department of Nutrition, pairing the evidence for health- and sustainability-linked food choices with flavor, other culinary, and demographic trends and plausible business scenarios allows flavor-rich, largely plant-based food and menu choices to emerge (presented by G. Drescher, The Culinary Institute of America, at the Mushrooms and Health Summit on 9 September 2013). Mushrooms, with their unique sensory and culinary functional properties, may help Americans move toward healthier, plant-based choices. Of particular interest are the high amounts of both glutamates (not as monosodium glutamate) and ribonucleotides in A. bisporus. Glutamate and certain 5‚Ä≤-ribonucleotides are taste-active chemicals responsible for umami, considered by some to be the fifth flavor of food. Calcium diglutamate, in particular, was shown to improve the flavor of low-sodium products.

Life Born at the farm of Cwrt, Llanfwrog, Denbighshire, he was the son of Peter Foulkes and his wife Frances. At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to Isaac Clarke, a printer in Ruthin. In 1854 he went to Liverpool, before completing his apprenticeship. He spent some years as a compositor in the Liverpool printing office of the Welsh language newspaper Yr Amserau, and later worked in the printing works of David Marples. In 1862 he set up his own printing business in Liverpool, which he ran for the rest of his life. In May 1890 Foulkes began to issue Y Cymro (The Welshman), a weekly newspaper in Welsh intended primarily for Liverpool Welsh readers, but soon read widely in Wales as well; he was both editor and publisher, and made the journal a literary forum. Foulkes died at Rhewl, near Ruthin, on 2 November 1904, and was buried in Llanbedr churchyard.

A legal regime guaranteeing transparency of media ownership makes possible for the public as well as for media authorities to find out who effectively owns, controls and influences the media as well as media influence on political parties or state bodies. The disclosure of media ownership can be prescribed by generic regulation (commercial law) or by media-specific provision. Such measures may mandate the disclosure of information on media ownership structures to specific authorities or to the general public. Turkey has both generic company laws and media-specific regulations on transparency of the print, broadcasting and online media outlets. Despite the existence of such laws, according to some experts the existing regulatory framework does not guarantee the disclosure of crucial information and to know who actually owns and influences the media in Turkey.  Overview  With regard to the disclosure of media ownership information, Turkey has both generic company laws and specific regulations concerning the printed, broadcast and online sectors. These regulations provide both for the disclosure to public bodies such as the Chief Prosecutor's Office and the ‚ÄúRadio and Television Supreme Council‚Äù (RTUK), and for the disclosure to citizens through the publication of ownership information on the media companies‚Äô websites. However, a research by Access Info Europe shows that the existing laws misses to prescribe the disclosure of crucial information therefore failing to actually disclose who owns and influences the media in Turkey. In fact, neither print media (under the Press Law) nor broadcast (under the Law on the Establishment of Radio and Television Institutions and Their Broadcasts) or online media (under the Law on the Establishment of Radio and Television Institutions and Their Broadcasts and the Law on the Regulation of Online Broadcasts and the Struggle of Crimes Committed Online) are required to report the essential information needed to identify ownership. Also, as Access Info notes, the law applying to broadcasting and on demand services does not require to disclose if shares are held on behalf of another nor the existence of beneficial owners. Uncertainty in the realm of transparency of media ownership in Turkey increased after 2001, when the ban on media conglomerates' bidding in public tenders was removed. In the last 15 years, the biggest Turkish media owners are corporations also operating in sectors such as construction, energy, mining and tourism. In this regard, strong ties with the government are lamented by Turkish civil society and the international community. The situation of uncertain transparency of media ownership increased throughout 2015 and 2016, when government's trustees were appointed to allegedly Gulenist-affiliated media outlets and companies. A takeover took place in October 26, 2016 for the Koza-Ipek Media Group, which owned, among others, Bugun and Millet dailies and Cihan News Agency. Similarly, trustees were appointed on March 5, 2016, for Feza Holding, the media holding publishing, among others, the most read newspaper in Turkey, Zaman, and the English-language daily Today's Zaman. The assets of these companies are currently under the jurisdiction of the government's Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (TMSF), and it is not clear if the companies will be either dissolved or sold off. Under emergency decree No. 687 of February 9, 2017, Turkey's Saving Deposit Insurance Fund (TMSF) will be authorized to sell companies seized by the state through the appointment of trustees.  Legal framework  Disclosure of ownership information of broadcast media (radio and television) is required by Law No. 6112 on the Establishment of Radio and Television Institutions and Their Broadcasts (2011) and by the Regulation on the Administrative and Financial Terms to Be Obeyed By Media Service Provider Institutions and the Platform and Infrastructure Service Operators (2011). With regard to print media, disclosure is required by the Press Law No. 5187 (2004). Finally, with regard to online media, disclosure is required by Law No. 5651 on the Regulation of Online Broadcasts and the Struggle of Crimes Committed Online and the Regulation on the Procedures and Principles of Internet Broadcasts (2007). Law No. 6112 on broadcasters requires ‚Äúmedia service providers‚Äù to report ownership information. They are defined as legal entities which choose the content of the radio, television and on-demand broadcasting services. Instead, according to the Press Law, ownership information have to be disclosed for media organizations publishing ‚Äúprinted materials‚Äù. Finally, the legislation on online media includes within its scope content providers, hosting service providers and access providers (under Article No. 3 of Law No. 5651). They should publish their up to date information in the homepage of their website. According to the relevant regulations for radios and televisions, ownership information have to be notified when a licence application is made, in cases of transfer of shares, acquisition and merger, changes to the disclosed information and annually, following the annual general meeting of shareholders. Instead, under the Press Law, information have to be disclosed before publishing a newspaper or other periodicals. Except for online media, if the information has the nature of commercial secret, it can be withheld. For instance, this was the case when the Media Ownership Monitor ‚Äì a project conducted by a team of members of Bianet, an independent Turkish press agency, and Reporters Without Borders ‚Äì requested information regarding the Turkish public broadcaster's (TRT) finances. Sanctions for non-disclosure are foreseen in the Press Law and in the Internet Law, covering only printed and online publications. Also foreign media organizations are covered by the above listed requirements. = Information to be disclosed = According to the laws, the information that have to be disclosed by the information providers are: * Name and contact details of media organisation; * Name and contact details of owner; * Country of domicile of company with an interest; * Citizenship/residence status of individual with an interest; * Except for the online media, the size of shareholding, namely the current shareholding structure, the voting shares, the capital-shares, the managers * Management details: names of the members of board of directors, names and citizenship details of general managers and managers in charge and the duties of managers); * Only for broadcasting media, if spouses, blood relatives and relatives in law up to the third degree are shareholders in the company, it will be indicated within the shareholdership structure considering these shares as owned by the same person; * Only for print media, disclosure is required also for political, religious or other affiliations of shareholder, interests by owners in other media organisations and in non-media businesses. Experts consider that existing obligations are not sufficient to establish who the legal or natural persons who effectively own and ultimately control the media organisations are. = Disclosure to public authorities = According to the Press Law, disclosure of ownership information has to be made to the Office of the local Chief Prosecutor. According to Law No. 6112 on media service providers (broadcaster), their ownership information have to be reported to the ‚ÄúRadio and Television Supreme Council‚Äù (RT√úK) . However, experts consider that regulators have no transparent, credible, and accessible annual records on media ownership. = Disclosure to the citizens = The information notified to the RT√úK have also to be published by the media organizations concerned on their websites. Under the Press Law, the records of the Public Prosecutor's office shall be public and anyone can see the relevant files containing published information and documents by making an application. Information on media ownership can be obtained by the public by making a Freedom of Information request, under Law No. 4982, on the Right to Obtain Information which entitles individuals to request information and documents from public and publicly owned bodies. Usually, requests for information related to media ownership are raised by professionals and media institutions, while it is not common among ordinary citizens. Media service providers (radio and TV broadcasters) can only be set up as joint stock companies. Only joint- stock companies have to disclose information to the trade registry, under the Turkish Commercial Code No. 6102. Media companies entering in the category of public joint-stock companies also have to respect the Capital Market Law No. 2499 (1981) and the Communiqu√© on Financial Reporting of the Capital Markets Board. These public enterprises should regularly draw financial statements to the Capital Markets Board, and annual reports should be disclosed to the public. An example of public joint-stock company in the field of media is the state-run Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT- T√ºrkiye Radyo ve Televizyon Kurumu). The results of a survey clearly showed that the sole enforcement of commercial law provides insufficient information regarding who effectively owns and ultimately controls media organizations.  Beneficial ownership  None of the laws regulating print, broadcast and online media requires disclosure of beneficial owners, i.e. holders owning shares on behalf of another person, or those with indirect control or a significant interest to a media authority or to the public. If the media company is established as a joint stock company, shareholding information can easily be accessed through the company's website and through the database of the trade registry. However, if shares are owned by one and actually used by another one as per an internal agreement, this information is not required to be disclosed by private or publicly-listed companies meaning ultimate ownership cannot therefore be identified. For this reason, experts consider that a reasonable, non-technical individual would not be able to ascertain who effectively owns and ultimately controls the media organisation, from the information available.  Influence of advertising financing  As advertising is an important income for media providers and the allocation of advertisements may influence editorial policies or weaken certain media rather than others, media service providers (broadcasters) shall report their monthly commercial advertisement income to the RT√úK, by the 20th day of the following month. The distribution of public funds on advertising is existentially an important source of income for smaller papers but the relative data remain hidden. For instance, the request of information on this topic by the Media Ownership Monitor was refused by the Turkish Right to Information Assessment Council, citing ‚Äútrade secrets‚Äù as a reason. Following the coup attempt, on October 5, 2016, regulations regarding the Press Advertising Institution (Basƒ±n ƒ∞lan Kurumu- Bƒ∞K)- the authority managing public announcements and advertising- were changed. According to this contested regulation,Regulation No. 29848, October 5, 2010, Art. No. 110. any news outlet that employs a journalist who is being tried on terrorism related charges will not be given state advertising, unless the employee is fired from the media organization in five days.  Civil society initiatives  Referring to the actions to be taken at a domestic level, some experts underlined the importance of encouraging public debate on media ownership, and to enhance media literacy on this topic. In 2016, Reporters Without Borders, together with the Turkish independent press agency Bianet, launched the project Media Ownership Monitor Turkey to promote transparency in media ownership and to map who owns and controls the media in Turkey, by creating a public available and updated database listing the owners of the main media outlets (both individual owners and media companies) and detailing also the interests and the affiliations of owners into companies or political parties. Another civil society initiative is the Network Data Compiling, a collective data compiling and mapping project dedicated to pursue the relations between capital and power in Turkey, released on July 14, 2014.

Jahrhundert. Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlag, 1993, p. 476.  Life  Gertrud Leutenegger was born and grew up in Schwyz, Switzerland, where her father was a book editor. She later lived in both the Italian-speaking and French-speaking parts of Switzerland. After completing her secondary education she initially undertook teacher training and became a Kindergarten teacher. She also worked in a psychiatric clinic for a time and was as a custodian at the Nietzsche House in Sils Maria. Leutenegger's interest in theatre led to drama studies at the Z√ºrich University of the Arts from 1976 to 1979 where she studied director's theatre (Regietheater). She worked as assistant producer to J√ºrgen Flimm, a noted exponent of Regietheater, at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus, Hamburg, in 1978. In the same year, she was awarded the prestigious Jury Prize of the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize for her early literary work. Many other prizes and distinctions followed. After short spells in Florence and Berlin, Leutenegger lived for a long time in Japan. She now lives in Z√ºrich. In 2010 she was elected to the German Academy for Language and Literature in Darmstadt.  Work  Leutenegger first came to prominence as a poet, later bringing her poetic vision to her novels, the first of which, Vorabend, was published in 1975. Her work is noted for its subjective vision, use of myth and fairy tale, dreams and poetry. There is also a strong element of political engagement, for example in the 1985 novel Kontinent which deals with issues of environmental damage. Leutenegger's most recently published work was the novel Panischer Fr√ºhling. This tells the story of a woman stranded in London when the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallaj√∂kull in 2010 brought all air-traffic to a sudden halt. This was shortlisted for both the Swiss Book Prize and the German Book Prize in 2014 and was awarded the Roswitha Prize in the same year.

Short of stature he was affectionately known as Wee Mon by his students. Life He was born on 24 July 1891 in Port of Spain in Trinidad the only son of Sophia Agnes Theresa Stollmeyer and her husband, Lt Col George Lambie, commanding officer of the Trinidad Light Infantry Volunteers. As a child he was a gifted musician and gave piano concerts at the age of 8. He was sent to boarding school in Scotland and was educated at Ayr Academy and Stanley House School in Stirlingshire. He went on to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with an MB ChB in 1914. He was President of the Royal Medical Society in 1914-15, one of its youngest presidents.

This happens when the disc is spun fast enough and seen through the four radial slits of a counter- rotating black disc. It was invented in 1829 by Joseph Plateau before further studies on the same principle led to his invention of animation through the ph√©nakisticope in 1832. Anorthoscopes with a black background have a translucent picture and need a luminous slit revolving behind the image disc. To make them translucent, the discs were impregnated with oil on the back and varnished on both sides. History The anamorphic disc image (A) and the perceived image when spun (B) as illustrated in Correspondance Math√©matique et Physique - Tome VI (1830) As a university student, Plateau noticed in some early experiments that when looking from a small distance at two concentric cogwheels, which turned fast in opposite directions, an optical illusion of a motionless wheel appeared. He later read Peter Mark Roget's 1824 article Explanation of an optical deception in the appearance of the spokes of a wheel when seen through vertical apertures that addressed a similar illusion. Plateau decided to investigate the phenomenon further and later published his findings in Correspondance Math√©matique et Physique in 1828 On 9 June 1829, Plateau presented his yet nameless anorthoscope as \\"une esp√®ce toute nouvelle d'anamorphoses\\" (a totally new sort of anamorphoses) in his doctoral thesis Sur quelques propri√©t√©s des impressions produites par la lumi√®re sur l'organe de la vue, at the University of Li√®ge. It was later translated and published in the German scientific magazine Annalen der Physik und Chemie. A letter to Correspondance Math√©matique et Physique dated 5 December 1829 included pictures of a disc and the resulting image as an illustration of these \\"new species of anamorphoses\\". Plateau revisited this concept several times in the Correspondance Math√©matique et Physique and by January 1836 he finally decided to have the device itself published. He sent a box with the instrument to Michael Faraday on 8 January 1836 since they both studied these kind of phenomena. Faraday had previously inspired Plateau to use a mirror with revolving discs, which helped Plateau to develop his Fantascope a.k.a. Ph√©nakisticope. Faraday thought the anorthoscope was a beautiful machine with an exceedingly curious and good effect, and mentioned: \\"It has wonderfully surprised many to whom I have showed it and they all refuse to believe their own eyes and cannot admit that the forms seen are the things looked at\\". The device was marketed starting in 1836 by publishers like Newton & Co in London, Susse in Paris (12 different discs) and J. Duboscq in Paris (at least 18 different discs). Plateau apparently first used the name \\"anorthoscope\\" in a letter to his mentor / publisher / friend Quetelet. He decided to send an example of the device to Miss Quetelet as a gift. Soon after, he presented it to the Royal Academy in Brussels in 1836. Joseph Plateau created a combination of his Fantascope (or ph√©nakisticope) and the Anorthoscope sometime between 1844 and 1849 resulting in a back-lit transparent disc with a sequence of figures that are animated when it is rotated behind a counter-rotating black disc with four illuminated slits, spinning four times as fast. Unlike the ph√©nakisticope, several people could view the animation at the same time. This system has not been commercialized; the only known two handmade discs are in the Joseph Plateau Collection of the Ghent University. Belgian painter Jean Baptiste Madou created the first images on these discs and Plateau painted the successive parts. 21st century A scientific paper on the effects of the anorthoscope was published in 2007. A rare completed 1836 anorthoscope set by Susse with twelve discs was auctioned for in 2013. The other two known extant sets of this edition are in the Werner Nekes collection and in the Joseph Plateau Collection in the Science Museum of the Ghent University.http://users.telenet.be/thomasweynants/anorthoscope.html References External links * Optical illusions Optical toys Precursors of film 1820s toys Audiovisual introductions in 1829 ","title":"Anorthoscope"},{"id":"53400698","text":"Rajgriha Express is a daily Mail/Express express train of Indian Railways, running between Rajgir, near Nalanda, Bihar, and Danapur, near Patna, Bihar via Nalanda,Bihar Sharif and Bakhtiyarpur Junction.

Overbeek was born in Groningen. Overbeek's family moved to Rotterdam in 1913 and to Breda in 1925. Overbeek went to study chemistry (from 1928-1933) at the Utrecht University. He spent a year in military service and then worked for two years in Belgium. First year he worked with Jacques Errera at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles, after that a year with Arend Joan Rutgers at Ghent University. He received his doctorate on May 19, 1941 with a thesis Theory of Electrophoresis, the Relaxation Effect (Theorie der electrophorese: het relaxatie-effect). All the characteristic features of the later work of Overbeek were present already in his thesis: formation of a simple model with the available data, set up the corresponding equations and then rigorous mathematical elaboration. Overbeek's dissertation explored the role of the deformation of the electrical double layer surrounding a charged colloidal particle which was set in motion by an external electric field. After graduation Overbeek joined Philips, where Evert Verwey, was his immediate boss. In addition to work on luminescent screens they worked together on the interaction between colloidal particles. Attraction, based on the summation of the London - van der Waals interactions between the atoms was established in 1937 by HamakerH. C. Hamaker, Physica, 4(10), 1058-1072 (1937) who also worked at Philips. However, the details on the repulsion produced by the electric double layer around colloidal particles were not so clear. By using thermodynamic considerations, the relevant free energies were calculated and interaction potential were derived. This research resulted in a seminal work Theory of the Stability of Lyophobic Colloids. The work had a great influence, and is still used by considerations about the stability of colloids, but also in various other fields where charged surfaces interact with each other. The whole of that theory is now known as DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, Overbeek) theory. In 1946, Overbeek became a professor of physical chemistry at the Utrecht University. He picked up a wide range of problems which, despite their different forms, always had the same distinctive approach. For Overbeek method was simple, theoretical model, selected experiments, rigorous calculations and testing the model with experimental sets. Overbeek also remained active after his retirement in 1981. His passion at that time was the understanding of the phenomenon of micro-emulsions, which were more stable in comparison to the conventional macro-emulsions. For his pioneering work Overbeek received several prestigious awards. He received honorary degrees from Clarkson University and University of Bristol. In 1989 he received the Wolfgang Ostwald Prize. He received honorary memberships of the Royal Netherlands Chemical Society. He was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1953. Every year European Colloid and Interface Society awards Overbeek Gold Medal, which is a prize named after Theodoor Overbeek. \\"The Overbeek Gold Medal honours leadership and scientific excellence in the field of colloid and interface science over an entire career.\\" The first prize in 2005 was handed over to Overbeek himself.

Her practice also included animated film, woodcut, monotypes and drawing which often expressed surrealist themes. Edell believed an artist‚Äôs work should be an expression of their own personal experience. Her work was rooted in feminism and drew inspiration from her dreams, religion and politics. Her work is recognized for its dream like qualities, art historical references, sensuality, unabashed sexuality, narrative and subversive wit.  Life and education  Nancy Edell was born in Omaha, Nebraska on November 12, 1942. Edell obtained her Bachelor of Fine Arts in printmaking and contemporary dance from the University of Omaha in 1964. By the time Edell was in her 20s, she had lived in Los Angeles, California, Victoria, British Columbia, and then Bristol, England where she continued her cinematic works and studies. From 1968-1969, Edell studied film and animation at the University of Bristol. After Edell's brief time in England, she moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba where she worked in animation and lithography until 1980. In 1980, Edell moved from Manitoba to the small village of Bayswater, Nova Scotia, and discovered the traditional domestic craft of rug-hooking which changed her art practice dramatically. Edell became a Canadian citizen in 1981. In 1982, Edell began teaching part-time at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, and continued working there until 2002. She was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin‚Äôs Lymphoma in the fall of 1999 and died on June 9, 2005. Edell was married to Peter Walker, and she also has a son, Gabriel Edell, a daughter-in-law, Sarah Maley Edell, and two grandchildren, Hyacinth Edell and Levon Edell.  Works  = Film = In the early 1970s Nancy Edell was acclaimed as one of Canada's foremost animators, though she preferred to be considered an artist. Edell says that most of her early film work was a form of self-therapy, a response to growing up in the 1950s in Nebraska, the ‚Äúrigid sex-roles‚Äù that defined her life and the violence she associated with sex. ‚ÄúDirty jokes were my basic childhood reference to sex. Sex is dirty, that kind of stuff. Men grabbing at women and leering. I was just working this out.‚Äù Edell‚Äôs animation works were screened in numerous places throughout the world including Edinburgh, Oberhausen, Chicago, Amsterdam, Toronto, and Montreal. Edell has won awards for her film work from festivals in Paris, France (1972), and Edinburgh, Scotland (1969) as well as the First Festival of Women's Films, New York City (1972), and the Canada Council. Edell had amination commissions from the BBC, CBC, and also Sesame Street. Her first two film aminations, Black Pudding and Charley Company, were created using cut-out drawings and lithographic prints. The characters in these films were made from detailed drawings with moving parts that were filmed moving to create the animation. Edell moved away from work in film animation after the 1980s. However, residues of her animations can be seen in her still work through the ‚Äúsequencing and fractured narrative structure‚Äù and the way she reused and repeated background images, as one would in cell animation.  Black Pudding (1969)  Black Pudding (1969) was Edells‚Äô first film which she directed, wrote, and animated. The video is 7 minutes long in colour film. It was created during her studies at Bristol University, in England. During this time, many adult-orientated animations were being produced in Europe which spoke to questions of sexuality and social norms. Black Pudding features \\"a giant vagina belch[ing] out strange, surrealistic, creatures in an endless stream.‚Äù It is described as an ‚Äúexperimental...dark surrealist fantasy, full of bizarre often erotic imagery and feminist themes.‚Äù Edell herself explains the creating of Black Pudding as a ‚Äúreally gut things and I just spewed out everything I wanted to say‚Äù. The name ‚ÄúBlack Pudding‚Äù became overtime, a reference to a woman‚Äôs insides and sexual organs. When Edell looked back on Black Pudding in an interview with Brian Clancey for Cinema Canada in 1976, she said she finds the film embarrassing. ‚ÄúNow, when I look at it, it's embarrassing, because it's so crude. It's really raw stuff.‚Äù  Charley Company (1972)  Charley Company was Edell‚Äôs second film and was created in 1972. It is a 9 min, colour animation. It was inspired by anti-war sentiment. The film featured a civilian army of sexual-sadistic civilian soldiers ‚Äúwalking up Uncle Sam‚Äôs ass‚Äù. Jana Vosikovska, in the program for the film series Canadian Women Filmmakers, describes these characters as ‚Äú[a] procession of fantastic creatures from the worlds of H. Bosch, R. Crumb and T. Dine.‚Äù The film also features hermaphrodite like characters, which Edell attributes to her interest in ‚Äúdual aspects‚Äù and siamese twins: when two things are joined together in impossible ways.  Lunch (1973)  Edell‚Äôs third film Lunch, made in 1973, is a 4-minute colour animation. She received a grant from the BBC. Lunch is a film about a waiter, a chef, and the customers. The idea for the film was initially submitted by a BBC producer, and was about the contrast between the atmosphere of the dining hall and kitchen in a restaurant. = Rug Hooking = When Edell arrived in Nova Scotia in 1980, rug hooking was a deep part of Nova Scotian folk-culture since the 1850s, but it had not yet found a place within fine art. Her move to Nova Scotia signaled a pivotal turn in her work; she started to incorporate the medium of rug hooking into her work, creating a unique visual style. Edell‚Äôs work with this medium mixes the traditional practices of rug hooking with controversial themes such as feminism, sexuality, and death. She used the narrative possibilities of this medium to express a dream like quality with art historical references, sensuality, journeys and wit. ‚ÄúUsing found wool rag (used clothing) and a traditional method of shrinking, she began to construct images that spoke of enclosed interior (indoor) spaces as related to the gender issue. She explores a socially-constructed gender that is developed through the use of myth (often Assyrian) and stereotype‚Äù. Rug hooking and other domestic and often textile-based crafts, like quilting, knitting, sewing, and embroidery are often associated with the ‚Äòfeminine arts‚Äô. Because of this association with femininity and the domestic, they were devalued within the male-dominated hierarchy of art. Edell, along with artists like Joyce Wieland, Kate Walker, Eva Hesse,Jackie Winsor, Miriam Schapiro pushed the boundaries between craft and art in the 1960-80s. They argued the distinction between craft and art was a gendered one. \\"Mat hooking aligned Edell with feminist artists of the time who were incorporating folk and craft elements into their fine art practices. It was a choice that established a gender position from which she developed the feminist utopia depicted in her Art Nuns rug-hooking series. With its scenes of a community of celibate women artists devoted to the creation and exploration of art, Art Nuns illustrates Edell‚Äôs shift to a woman-centered vision. In the 1990s her hooked-rug works grew beyond the familiar format of the enclosed border which was typical of her earlier work. Edell‚Äôs final body of work has been described as cataclysmic and urgent, depicting pathological processes, micro-organisms and systems of medicine and biology ‚Äî a response to the terminal cancer that would eventually take her life.\\"  Exhibitions + Awards  = Solo = 1989, Nancy Edell, Galerie d‚ÄôArt, Universit√© de Moncton, Moncton, New Brunswick. 1989, Fragile Structures, Anna Leonowens Gallery, Halifax, Nova Scotia. 1988, Nancy Edell, Omaha Art Gallery, Omaha, Nebraska. 1986, Home Entertainment, Plug In Gallery, Winnipeg, Manitoba. 1885, Nancy Edell, Southern Alberta Art Gallery, Lethbridge, Alberta. 1984, Boudoir / Home Entertainment, Great George Street Gallery, Charlottetown, PEI. 1981, Nancy Edell, Art Gallery, Mount Saint Vincent University, Halifax, Nova Scotia. = Group = 1990, 4th International Biennial Print Exhibition, Taipei, Taiwan. 1990, Pictoral Space: New Images in Textiles, The Museum for Textiles, Toronto, Ontario. 1989, No Place Like Home, SAW Gallery, Ottawa, Ontario. 1988, Eighty / Twenty: 100 Years of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Halifax, Nova Scotia. 1987, Nancy Edell / Vivienne Pearson, Articulate Gallery, Montreal, Quebec, and Latitude 53, Edmonton, Alberta. 1986, 8th International Exhibition of Graphic Art, Frechen, West Germany. 1985, innovascotia, Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Halifax, Nova Scotia. 1983, Atlantic Print Exhibition, Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Halifax, Nova Scotia. 1982, Mirrorings, Art Gallery, Mount Saint Vincent University, Halifax, Nova Scotia. = Collections = Acadia University Art Gallery, Wolfville, Nova Scotia Art Gallery of Brant, Brantford, Ontario Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Halifax, Nova Scotia Canada Council Art Bank, Ottawa, Ontario Dalhousie Art Gallery, Halifax, Nova Scotia Art Gallery, Mount Saint Vincent University, Halifax, Nova Scotia Memorial University Art University.

Plot synopsis Steve is an immature professional snowboarder that has just been stranded in the mountains with his girlfriend/manager Branka and Joschi, a fellow snowboarder, as a result of a prank he played during a publicity video for their sponsor. The trio manages to take shelter in a mountaintop hotel, only for things to grow increasingly more dire after they discover that the resort owner's experiment to make snow in warmer temperatures has turned the local wildlife and humans into bloodthirsty zombies.

The Guardian rated the movie at two out of five stars, writing that \\"The acting is wooden and the special effects aren‚Äôt all that special, but it‚Äôs a spirited effort and doesn‚Äôt drag during its 78 minutes.\\" Empire magazine was slightly more positive, stating \\"Rising to the challenge of doing something new(ish) with an overworked subgenre, this may not be particularly scary or funny. But it belies its modest budget to splatter to knowing effect.\\" SciFiNow espoused a similar view, commenting that it \\"at least tries to do something a bit different with a subgenre that long became saturated past the point of no return.

Approximately 45,000 people attend one of the conferences each year. It was founded in 1991 as a small cryptography conference. RSA conferences take place in the United States, Europe, Asia, and the United Arab Emirates each year. The conference also hosts educational, professional networking, and awards programs. History =Early history= The name RSA refers to the public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security, Inc., which was founded in 1982. The abbreviation stands for Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, the inventors of the technique. The idea for the first RSA conference was conceived in 1991 in a phone call between then RSA Security CEO Jim Bidzos and the Executive Director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. The first conference had just one panel, called \\"DES and DSS: Standards of Choice.\\" It focused on why attendees should not adopt DSS, a standard that was expected to challenge RSA Security's status as the de facto standard for digital signatures. A poster from the 1998 RSA condemning Clipper The event steadily grew and in 1993 it attracted more than 200 attendees. Known for many years as the RSA Data Security Conference, it eventually became just the RSA Conference. Over time the conference grew more business-oriented with an older demographic and more vendors, which led to competitive issues for a time in the 1990s; European competitors to RSA Security sometimes could not get a booth, so they hired people to pass out flyers at the RSA conference encouraging attendees to visit them at hotels nearby. In 1995 the conference criticized the Clipper Chip. If implemented, the chip would have given the U.S. government direct access to evidence on telecommunications devices with the chip installed. The conference put up posters with \\"Sink Clipper\\" in big letters. By 1997 the conference had grown to 2,500 attendees. The first European RSA Conference took place in 2000 and started with just 5 tracks. According to Network World the conference's focus expanded from cryptography into a broader IT security conference with larger attendance in 2005, when Microsoft CEO Bill Gates did the keynote presentation. According to Bidzos, the purpose of the conference became \\"for all kinds of things: drive standards, organize some opposition to government policies, promote the RSA name, [and] give all of our customers an opportunity\\". By 2008 the conference had 17,000 attendees and 375 participating IT security vendors. It had 18 tracks and 230 sessions. =Recent history= At the 2010 RSA conference, the Obama administration publicly revealed the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI), which was created in 2008 and formerly kept a secret. In 2011, a California-based IT security company, HBGary, withdrew from speaking and exhibiting at the RSA conference, citing safety concerns. The company announced plans to reveal the identities of some members of the hacktivist group Anonymous and received retaliatory threats and hacks. In 2014, 8 speakers boycotted the RSA conference after its sponsor, RSA Security, was accused of adding a backdoor to its products, so the National Security Agency could monitor users of RSA Security technology. The boycott began with then F-Secure Chief Technology Officer Mikko Hypp√∂nen. He wanted RSA Security to apologize, whereas the company's statement was that the allegations were not true. Some noted that the RSA conference and RSA Security company are only loosely connected. Discussion at that year's conference was focused heavily on leaks by Edward Snowden and NSA involvement with American technology companies. The first RSA Conference in the Asia-Pacific was introduced in 2013. This was followed by the inaugural United Arab Emirates conference two years later. In 2015 the conference added a clause to exhibitor contracts effectively prohibiting \\"booth babes\\" by requiring professional attire on the exhibitor floor. The policy was implemented in response to feedback that booth babes made the conference feel unprofessional. Fortune Magazine called the widespread practice of having booth babes at professional conferences \\"outdated\\" and unwelcoming to female attendees. The following year, the RSA conference was focused on the FBI‚ÄìApple encryption dispute, regarding attempts by the government to gain access to iPhones containing evidence in criminal investigations. As of 2017, the conference has an estimated 40,000‚Äì43,000 attendees in the United States. Content The RSA Conference is an international conference series on IT security that takes place in the United States, Europe, Asia/Japan, and the United Arab Emirates. It also provides internet safety education for consumers and children, a security scholar program for IT security students, and operates award programs typically bestowed at conferences. For example, one award is the Innovation Sandbox contest, which involves ten startups that present their technology to a panel of judges. The 2017 conference in the U.S. had 15 keynotes, 700 speakers, 500 sessions, and 550 exhibitors. An analysis of session keywords at the conference suggest that early conferences were focused on cryptography and commerce, but the topical focus of conferences transitioned to cloud and cybersecurity in the early 2000s. Each conference has a theme, a practice that began in 1995. Additionally, there are typically one or two IT security topics that the conference organizers pick to focus on each year. Speaking positions at the RSA conference are highly competitive, with thousands of submissions for a few hundred speaking positions.  RSA Conference Awards The RSA conference provides annual awards to recognize outstanding people and organizations in the following areas by the following awards:https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us18/about/awards * RSA Award for Excellence in Mathematics (officially called The RSA Conference Award for Excellence in Mathematics) * Information Security * Public Policy * Humanitarian Service Winners are announced at the opening keynote sessions of the conference in April each year.

It has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1998. The site covers an area of about 30 hectares. Overview During the early to middle J≈çmon period (approximately 3500 to 2000 BC), sea levels were five to six meters higher than at present, and the ambient temperature was also 2 deg C higher. During this period, the T≈çhoku region was inhabited by the J≈çmon people, many of whom lived in coastal settlements. The middens associated with such settlements contain bone, botanical material, mollusc shells, sherds, lithics, and other artifacts and ecofacts associated with the now-vanished inhabitants, and these features, provide a useful source into the diets and habits of J≈çmon society. The Futatsumori Site is one of the largest found in the T≈çhoku region, and is located on a 30 meter high plateau on the west bank of Lake Ogawara, which was a salt-water inlet of the Pacific Ocean at that time. It consists of several shell middens divided into two areas on the northern and southern slopes of the plateau. The western section consists of seven smaller shell middens forming a rough shell ring. The eastern area consists of five much larger shell middens, also forming a rough shell ring, and enclosing the remains of the settlement. The 27 varieties of shells excavated indicate that the nearby Ogasawa inlet was salt water in the early J≈çmon period, but had become brackish by the middle J≈çmon period. In addition to shells (with a high percentage of ‚Äô'Yamato shijimi and hamaguri, the middens also contained many fish bones, bones from swans, ducks, deer, boars and other animals, indicating the varied diet of the local inhabitants. Shards of various types of J≈çmon pottery were also discovered, as were artifacts made of jade and obsidian, which were not produced in the area, and which thus indicates trade with other areas. Canine remains were also discovered, indicating that the J≈çmon period inhabitants kept dogs. The numerous foundations of pit dwellings and storage pits indicates that this was a large settlement. Four of the artifacts discovered at the site (intricately carved ornaments from bone) have been designated as Aomori Prefectural Important Cultural Properties. The site has been submitted for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List as one of the J≈çmon Archaeological Sites in Hokkaid≈ç, Northern T≈çhoku, and other regions The site has two restored pit dwellings and an explanatory plaque. Some of the recovered artifacts are on display at the Shichinohe Town Cultural Center. The site is approximately 20 minutes by car from Kamikitach≈ç Station on the Aoimori Railway.

It is mostly second growth temperate deciduous forest, interspersed with wetlands and beaver ponds, as well as sedge-dominated rock-ridges. A central ridge has more than twenty hectares of hemlock forest. There are also old fields that remain from pastures created in the previous century. Parts of this property, as well as adjoining lands, are designated as the Scotch Corners Provincially Significant Wetland. The property is one of several protected by the Mississippi Madawaska Land Trust. This seepage valley has a deciduous forest canopy, with an understory of ostrich fern, and supports several with calcium- demanding plants including Clinton‚Äôs fern and narrow-leaved spleenwort. This valley is a headwater for a stream that eventually feeds into Mississippi Lake. Geology The bed rock is gneiss, and rounded gneiss ridges alternate with valleys filled with glacial till.Geological Survey of Canada. 1973. Map 1362A Geology, Carleton Place, 1: 50,000. Although the soils are therefore acidic, and shallow, the presence of certain plants that require calcium, such as yellow lady slipper and bulblet bladder fern, indicate that some of the glacial till may contain marble from landscapes further north in the county. The east side of the property lay beneath the Champlain Sea, and so has clay deposits rather than till; some of these clay plains are covered in thick organic deposits. This produces a flat, poorly drained landscape. The shoreline of the Champlain sea can still be recognized as it meanders from north east to south west across the property. Forests The original forests were predominantly sugar maple, beech, white pine and hemlock, which is typical for land on the Canadian shield in eastern Ontario.Keddy, Cathy J. 1994. Forest History of Eastern Ontario. Eastern Ontario Model Forest, Information Report Number 1, 41 p + appendices. Eastern Ontario Model Forest, Kemptville, Ontario. These forests were heavily logged in the 1800s and then often cleared for pastures and fields. White pine was removed for ship building, hemlock was removed for tanning leather, and most other species of trees were burned to produce potash which was exported to Europe. Thus, the current forests have altered species composition, with smaller trees, and reduced soil fertility.

Wood frogs are rapid breeders in small temporary ponds, also known as vernal ponds; mating and egg laying are completed in just a few days. Gray Tree frogs, on the other hand, have a much longer calling period. They call from the trees before moving to water, they call from the water while mating, and then they call while leaving the pond for the forest. Bullfrogs are the last to call, usually during the hot evenings of July and August. Other amphibians include spotted, blue spotted and red-backed salamanders. There are also populations of snapping turtles and painted turtles, with recorded sightings of Blanding‚Äôs turtles; several south-facing slopes are actively used by nesting turtles. As noted above, there are frequent sightings of wetland mammals including otters, muskrat, beavers and ermine. There is a rich wetland flora typical of ponds on the Canadian shield, such as yellow water lilies and water shield. There are also less-common species including green arrow arum Toner, Maureen, Nicholas Stow and Cathy J. Keddy. 1995.

There is one known species of a carnivorous plant, horned bladderwort. There are also large clones of semi-aquatic sedges that support populations of two rare butterflies, the broad winged skipper and the Appalachian brown. Terrestrial animals The dominant herbivores at KNS are deer, beavers and porcupines. The forests have clearly been shaped, and continue to be shaped, by all three.Mississippi Madawaska Land Trust Conservancy. 2014. Baseline Documentation Report. 14 p. Deer browse and graze heavily, and have depleted native populations of understory species such as yew, as well as preventing regeneration of preferred foods such as hemlock and yellow birch. Beavers have removed hardwood trees in the vicinity of most ponds, allowing dense conifer stands to form. One of the most common trees is now ironwood, a species which is not commonly eaten by deer or beavers. Many rock ridges are dominated by ironwood with a sedge understorey. Porcupines feed mostly on sugar maple and red oak trees, but seasonally feed in hemlock trees. It is likely that all three of these species are at higher than normal populations owing to the comparative absence of natural predators. Wolves and bobcats have been extirpated. Coyotes do hunt in the forest, however, and remove some deer, while fishers have been observed, and presumably take some porcupines. The birds reflect the landscape. Many birds use the deciduous forest to nest in the spring. These include rose-breasted grosbeaks, black- throated green warblers, ovenbirds, and great crested flycatchers. The wetlands provide migratory resting areas for large numbers of ducks, particularly wood ducks, hooded mergansers and ring-necked ducks. Wood ducks and hooded mergansers often nest. There are recorded nests of both heron and osprey, and for about a decade in the 1970s there was a heronry of more than thirty nests. There are also records of nesting turkey vultures.Brunton, Daniel F. 2004. Turkey vulture nest sites in southeastern Ontario. Ontario Birds 22 (1): 36-38. Owing in part to the quality of the forest, there are at least four species of woodpeckers: downy, hairy, yellow-bellied sapsucker, and pileated. Barred owls are regularly heard and seen.

Language Dhanggati or Djangadi belongs to the Yuin‚ÄìKuric language family and is usually grouped with the Anƒìwan language. The Ngabu Bingayi Aboriginal Corporation promotes the revival study of their language learning as an ongoing activity in the Macleay Valley. Linguist Amanda Lissarrague has been active in assisting their efforts. The language is currently being taught at Kempsey TAFE. Part of the language was recorded and analysed by Nils Holmer and his wife. Country Norman Tindale estimated Djangadi traditional lands to have encompassed some . They took in the area from Point Lookout southwards as far as the headwaters of the Macleay River and the vicinity of the Mount Royal Range. To the east, their territory ran as far as the crests of the coastal ranges, while their inland extension to the west ran up to the Great Dividing Range and Walcha. The people to their north were the Gumbaynggirr. On their western flank were the Anƒìwan. The southern linguistic border is with Biripi. People The tribes in the Macleay/Manning area before white contact were estimated to number some 4,000. Their coastal neighbours viewed them with diffidence, calling them jang (bad folk). By some accounts they comprised between 6 and 8 different dialect groups, among which two dwelt in the upper catchment of the Macleay River system. These two were * Nulla Nulla * Conderang. Praying Mantis Totems, according to some elderly informants, could be social or personal. The praying mantis (gurginj gurginj) is listed among the former as a river totem and described as covering the river stretch from Bellbrook downwards as far as the area around Georges Creek. Animals such as the echidna were personal totems, with which particular persons were identified. The term for the localized patrilineal horde was dawun. Sacred sites The Djangadi creation myth contains a legend about the Rainbow Serpent, who was believed to have created the gorge at Apsley Falls in the Dreamtime. Once underground, it was said to have reemerged at the mill hole near Walcha on the Apsley River, =Burrel Bulai= Burrel Bulai (Mount Anderson) is considered to be one of the most powerful sacred sites in Thunghutti/Dunghutti Country and was registered was recorded as a place of significance by Ray Kelly, an Aboriginal Research Officer with the NSW Sites of Significance Survey team. =Long Gully= Two high ridges overlook the site, which was used, as late as 1932, for the fin al stages of initiation. =Carrai waterholes= Young Djangadi men went through initiation rites at Carrai Waterholes. History An Aboriginal presence in the Djangadi lands has been attested archaeologically to go back at least 4,000 years, according to the analysis of the materials excavated at the Clybucca midden, a site which the modern-day descendants of the Djangadi and Gumbaynggirr claim territory. In the Clybucca area are ancient camp sites with shell beds in the form of mounds which are up to high. Middens are attested in the Macleay Valley, together with remnants of a fish trap in the Limeburners Creek Nature Reserve and, just slightly north of Crescent Head, at Richardsons Crossing, there is a bora ring. White intrusion on the Djangadi lands first took off as mostly ex-convict cedar cutters, based at a camp at Euroka Creek established by Captain A. C. Innes in 1827, began exploring the rich resources of the area in the late 1820s. The first European settler in the Kempsey district was named Enoch William Rudder, in 1835, who had purchased a land grant of from its first owner, Samuel Onions. Within a decade the timber cutters had virtually harvested every stand of this highly prized red gold timber in clearances that made the land increasingly attractive to pastoralists, who by 1847, after the Crown Lands Occupation Act of 1836 permitted squatting, had established 31 stations along the Macleay river from Kempsey inland to Kunderang Brook. This coincided with one of the most violent and sustained examples of warfare in the Macleay gorges, during which it is estimated that around 15 massacres took place in the region targeting Aboriginal people of the area. The Djangadi and other tribes affected adopted guerilla tactics to fight the usurpation of their land, by attacking shepherds, hit-and-run raids on homesteads and duffing sheep and cattle livestock before retreating into the gorges where pursuit was difficult. Some 2 to 3 dozen people were killed for rustling sheep at a massacre which took place at Kunderang Brook in 1840. The war ended with the establishment of a force of native police at Nulla Nulla in 1851. However, by that time, attrition had devastated tribal numbers. Of the 4,000 Aboriginal people in the area before the settlements, one third are thought to have been killed in a little over two decades. A description of the Djangadi and other Aboriginal groups in the Macleay area was given by Captain John Macdonald Henderson in 1851. Some Djangadi settled the Shark, Pelican Island and the two Fattorini Islands in the Macleay River, gazette as Aboriginal reserves in 1885, and grew corn there. In 1924 the Fattorini island residents were relocated to Pelican Island, and its status as a reservation was cancelled. Eventually the Djangadi moved to Kinchela Creek Station though an unofficial camp remained at Green Hills, resisting attempts to have them relocated, until they were placed under the administration of a white manager at Burnt Bridge Reserve. Discrimination barriers were finally broken in part when the first Aboriginal children were permitted in 1947 to attend Green Hill Public School, though the white community reacted by shifting their children to West Kempsey. Native title The first successful mainland claim for native title was made by the Djangadi, whose rights were recognized by the New South Wales Government in the Crescent Head Agreement. They were awarded in the same year $738,000 in compensation, with an attached agreement to be paid another sum a decade later. A sum of $6.1 million was paid as a compensation payout which the state government has made 14 years later, based on recognition that 12.4 hectares at Crescent Head, which had been given residential development approval, lay under their native title rights. Djangadi culture The Wigay Aboriginal Cultural Park near Kempsey contains over 150 different native Indigenous plants to the Macleay Valley. The site is diversified by plantations of species according to rainforest, dry forest, tropical forest, heathland and wetland niches.

Description and history The town of Salisbury, located in Connecticut's northwest corner, was incorporated in 1741, and thrived economically on the exploitation of iron ore which had been found in its hills. This resource was overtaken by technological advances by the American Civil War, and the town experienced no significant further economic growth. The town center developed in the mid-1740s, with the Bushnell Tavern established in 1746, and the cemetery in 1750. A portion of the original tavern survives in altered form at 6 Factory Street. and The historic district is bounded on the north by the triangular town green, formed by the junction of Main Street and Under Mountain Road, and the White Hart Tavern, a rambling building dating to about 1800. The southern end of the district is anchored by the civic buildings of the town hall and the Scoville Library, both set on large landscaped lots. The town hall is a modern construction from 1988, but retains traditional features such as clapboard siding and pilasters, while the library is an 1894 Romanesque stone building donated by a local benefactor.

She is remembered for her poetry collection Soupirs po√©tiques (1833) and for her Histoire de l'abbaye de Saint-Denis (History of Saint-Denis Abbey, 1861). Biography Born in 1801 in Paris, d'Ayzac was a gifted and hard-working child. When she was 16, she joined the Legion of Honour School in Saint-Denis, soon becoming a dame professeur (lady teacher). She remained there for 35 years, first taking an interest in literature and poetry and later turning to the history of art, especially archaeology. After receiving recognition for her poetry in 1823 and 1824, her Soupirs received an award from the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1843. Her work on art and architecture was particularly impressive. In 1849 her description of statues in Chartres Cathedral (Statues de l'un des porches de la cath√©drale de Chartres) was welcomed by the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. In 1861, the same institution awarded her a prize for her Histoire de l'abbaye de Saint-Denis. These early works contributed to her reputation as one of the first female art historians in France. Other contributions on architecture include Histoire et embl√®mes bibliques sculpt√©s au pourtour ext√©rieur du choeur de Notre-Dame de Paris published in Revue arch√©ologique in 1845, and Symbolique des pierres pr√©cieuses ou tropologie des gemmes in 1846, both published in Revue arch√©ologique.

Web. Accessed Feb 15 2017. Retrieved from http://dana.njit.edu/items/show/419 It housed a co-ed college/vocational preparatory school which provided students with \\"a happier and more healthful environment than their own homes\\". The building was constructed under the supervision of the Newark School Board's Head of Construction Department, Ernest F. Gilbert. It housed Central High School until its purchase in 2010 by NJIT. Built in the Collegiate Gothic style, the facility, which was renovated under a New Jersey state grant, re-opened as a university building and STEM counseling center on April 13, 2017. History Plans for construction of the proposed Central Commercial and Manual Training School House were publicly announced on March 14, 1909. A competition of architects had been conducted by the board of the Newark Public Schools three years preceding the announcement in order to determine the most elegant design. However, the plans drawn up by the winner, a Mr. Myers, had called for the costly excavation into a ledge of rock, estimated to cost $40,000. Although the Board had already set aside a total budget of approximately $650,000 for the construction of the school building, the board was not in favor of the expenditure. Luckily, the School Board's supervising Architect, Ernest F. Gilbert, worked out a solution to the problem which rendered the excavation unnecessary and continued to maintain the level of elegance desired by the School Board. Throughout construction Gilbert remained in charge of planning and supervising, assisted by George W. Knight, the school engineer in charge of heating, lighting, ventilating and other engineering details. An additional floor was called for the week following the announcement in 1909, and Gilbert was able to accommodate the change without damaging the architectural structure. Although the school was founded in 1911, the building itself was not dedicated until January 31, 1912, upon which the city of Newark was congratulated, and by 1913 evening classes had begun. Mr. Gilbert's solution had included the design of a dramatic staircase which sat at the front of the school and took advantage of the slope upon which the school was built. However, around the year 1970 Ernest F. Gilbert's staircase was demolished in favor of the construction of an indoor swimming pool in its place. After the 1967 Newark riots, the school's area fell into decline. This promoted the expansion of the four bordering universities which include the Rutgers University‚ÄìNewark campus, NJIT, Essex County College, the University of Medicine And Dentistry of New Jersey (now the New Jersey Medical School of Rutgers). Having been engulfed by its campus, NJIT officially purchased it in 2010. After this purchase NJIT began using the building for adult courses, although some high school classes continued on certain floors until the complete migration of the high school's student populace to their new school building. Structure The Central King Building was originally built in a Jacobean style, although the towers on each corner are Tudor Gothic. Its initial shape was a large square-like building consisting of a combination of terracotta and brick, three stories high, with each corner tower an extra story higher. This building's initial accommodation was 1,200 students. The Central King Building was initially created with the goal to accommodate all STEM students. The first floor contained a machine shop, reference library, administrative offices, pattern shop, a metalworking shop, three classrooms, and spaces for wood-turning, masonry, and wood- finishing. The second floor contained five standard classrooms, three for business and typewriting, two for chemical labs, separated by a lecture room, two sewing rooms, two millinery rooms, and a room for dressmaking and a large study hall. The third floor contains EIGHT standard classrooms, a music room, a biological lab, a laundry room, two kitchens, a great-machine drawing room, a free-hand drawing room, two physics labs and a lecture room. The fourth room was left unfinished, leaving room to accommodate more students. The basement includes spaces for lockers, foundry and forge rooms, stock rooms and space for heating and ventilation. Outside of the building, there is a portion of land that contains a boiler and engine rooms, as well as a mechanical testing plant.Ernst F.

History In 1862, a committee was set up to provide a large church for the Clifton area of Bristol. It would be in the Anglo-Catholic tradition, and would be a free church with no rented pews. The original church was built between 1868 and 1872 by George Edmund Street. The chancel was consecrated on 8 June 1868. A narthex was added in 1909 by George Frederick Bodley, and a sacristy was added in 1928 by Frederick Charles Eden. On 2 December 1940, an incendiary bomb set fire to the building, destroying the chancel and nave of the church. Only the tower, narthex, and sacristy remained standing. W. H. Randoll Blacking was the architect chosen to reconstruct the church, but, after much delay, he died before work could begin. In the 1960s, it was once more decided that the rebuilding of the church should go ahead and Robert Potter was selected as the architect. He reorientated the church so that the altar now faces East. The altar itself is free standing and is set under a ciborium, a four-columned indoor roof. Behind the font is a series of stained glass windows made from fibre glass and designed by John Piper. The new nave and altar were consecrated on 1 July 1967. On 8 January 1959, the church was designated a grade II listed building. =Present day= In 1978, the parish of All Saints Clifton was joined with that of St John's Clifton to form the Parish of All Saints with St. John Clifton. St John's Church was declared redundant in 1980. In March 2013, the parochial church council voted to rescind Resolutions A and B, and to rescind the petition for alternative episcopal oversight. With these actions, the parish signalled that it accepts the ordination of women. It remains within the Anglo-Catholic tradition of the Church of England. Archives Parish records for the Church of All Saints, Clifton are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. P.St ASC) (online catalogue) including baptism and marriage registers and plans of the remodelling from 1963. The archive also includes records of the incumbent, churchwardens, parochial church council, charities and choir school.

Founded in 2016, ICOM is located at the Meridian campus of Idaho State University (ISU). At ICOM, students can earn a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree. ICOM's mission is to train osteopathic physicians in Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming and more. ICOM matriculated its second class of students in August 2019. This Class of 2023 is composed of graduates from 104 U.S. colleges and universities. These students originate from 38 states with approximately one-third coming from Idaho and the ICOM target five-state region, including Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. History Before ICOM was established, Idaho was the most populous state without a medical school of its own. ICOM was formed to help address the current and growing shortage of physicians in its five- state region outlined in its mission, with an emphasis on rural, underserved areas. Although Idaho is among the most rapidly growing areas of the country, the state ranks 49th in physicians per capita. In December 2017 COCA granted ICOM pre-accreditation status and authorized the recruitment of 162 students. Campus Located in Meridian, Idaho, the three-story, 94,000-square-foot facility cost $34 million, and took Engineered Structures, Inc. (ESI) just thirteen months to build. Dekker/Perich/Sabatini, a New Mexico-based architecture firm, did the design. ICOM's campus includes more than 12,000 feet of classroom space, including: two lecture halls, each with 250 seats; a clinical simulation center; a 3,5000-square-foot medical library; and a 3,479-square-foot osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) Lab. Additionally, 12 Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) rooms are located on the second floor. ICOM has a 40-year agreement with Idaho State University- Meridian for use of its Treasure Valley Anatomy and Physiology Laboratory (TVAPL). There, ICOM's first-year medical students perform whole-body dissections on donated bodies, also known as cadavers. Academics As a free-standing medical school, ICOM only offers graduate-level training. ICOM awards the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree (DO). This is a four-year degree with years 1 and 2 consisting of on-campus didactic lectures, small group assignments laboratory and clinical experiences. Years 3 and 4 are completed at selected clinical sites.

Early life and education Born in Canada in 1972, Robson grew up in Hawaii and now resides in New York. Robson attended Columbia University where she graduated with a B.A. in visual arts and art history. Work Robson's primary focus is creating works made with plastic collected by intercepting the waste stream, repurposing plastic into art before it is sent to recycling. While her initial work was with common household plastics like water bottles and caps, she is currently focused on large scale sculptures made with industrial plastic. She also paints and creates 3-dimensional collages made with junk mail and excess packaging. In 2008, Robson founded Project Vortex, a not-for-profit organization consisting of artists, designers and architects from around the world that also work with plastic. The organization strives to bring awareness to plastic pollution and encourage cleanups of waterways. In 2013, she gave a Ted talk at TedxPeachtree entitled \\"Trash+Love\\" introducing \\"Sculpture+Intercepting the Waste Stream,\\" an open source course she designed to foster creative stewardship at academic institutions. The course was first taught by Robson at Mary Baldwin University in 2012. Her goal for the course is to inspire others to look at junk differently and rather than discard it, to create art.

This subject matter is quite common, with images appearing as early as the 14th century. Viewers are often exposed to a private, personal moments through these works. Reading Woman (c.1660) by Pieter Janssans Elinga portrays reading as an intimate and introspective activity. Beyond the exchange of ideas between author and reader, scholar James Conlon, describes reading as an intimate and erotic subject, through the captivating book that touches and holds the reader's attention, and offers tactile pleasure in weight. As a result, the image of a woman reading becomes one of sexual subversion, and a source of fear for the male viewer or artist. In Western, patriarchal societies, Conlon argues, the act of reading takes a woman out of subservient role and into a context where personal pleasure, knowledge, and enjoyment is literally in her hands.  Depictions of woman readers  Antoine Wiertz, The Reader of Novels, c. 1853 During the 19th century, amidst a golden age for reading, concerns emerged about women's reading as jeopardizing marital and familial structures. Drawings and illustrations of the time reflected this fear that women would be seduced by books and neglect their domestic duties. Other images implied the danger in tempting women with books as explicitly linked to their sexuality, like in Antoine Wiert'sThe Reader of Novels (c.1853), where the figure of the devil literally supplies the female subject with pleasurable reading material. Claude Monet, Springtime, c. 1872 In Dutch Golden Age painting, female readers were depicted as part of the genre of the everyday, usually engaged with letters. Johannes Vermeer, for example, created numerous works around this subject, including A Woman in Blue Reading a Letter and Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window. Despite this apparent acceptance of woman readers, scholars have determined that the letters including in Dutch painting were almost exclusively love letters. As Conlon argues, the self- relective act of reading becomes conflated in these depictions with distraction and longing for someone - presumably a male lover - ultimately undermining the subjectivity of the woman reader. Male artists have also depicted women readers within pastoral settings, like in Claude Monet's Springtime, perhaps in an attempt to tame or domesticate the otherwise wild act of reading. Woman in Blue Reading a Letter, ca. 1662-1663, Johannes Vermeer  Female artists and the subject of reading  Female artists have also been drawn to the subject of women readers. These artists depictions of reading greatly differ from their male counterparts, demonstrating the complexity of the topic. Mary Cassatt's Family Group Reading is a powerful representation of women readers who demonstrate subjectivity and serious literary engagement. All three are fixated on the text, and Cassat may be emphasizing that reading comes just as naturally to women as motherhood, by painting the young girl encircled by the woman's arms and drawn literally into the book.

After the brothers reconciled in 1799, Manuchar was appanaged with Salipartiano, which he lost to his nephew Levan, a new Prince of Mingrelia, in the wake of Grigol's death in 1804.  Power struggle  Manuchar was a son of Katsia II Dadiani by his third wife Anna Tsulukidze. In 1791, King Solomon II of Imereti, who sought to unite all of western Georgia under his authority, deposed Grigol and replaced him by a more amenable Manuchar. In 1792, Grigol's attempt at comeback were dashed as his newfound ally David II, claimant to the Imeretian crown, was defeated by Solomon and Manuchar near Kutaisi and Grigol's Abkhaz reinforcements deserted. Grigol later found support in the district of Lechkhumi and successfully resisted Solomon and Manuchar in his stronghold at Nogi. Manuchar was eventually ousted from Mingrelia and fled to Abkhazia in 1794, but Grigol was able to buy the Abkhaz ruler Kelesh Bey's loyalty by granting him the fort of Anaklia. There was another claimant in Mingrelia during these years: Tariel, younger brother of Grigol and Manuchar.  Lord of Salipartiano  The Dadiani brothers reconciled in 1799. Grigol was recognized as Prince of Mingrelia, while Manuchar received the fief of Salipartiano. In a renewed conflict between Imereti and Mingrelia in 1802, Solomon again attempted to enlist Manuchar, but the latter eventually stood by his brother's side. Grigol died in October 1804, a few months after he placed his principality under Russian suzerainty. His young son and successor Levan was placed under regency of the princess dowager Nino. Manuchar saw this as an opportunity to advance his claims to the Mingrelian throne and petitioned the Russian authorities to confirm him as the next ruler of Mingrelia or, at least, to leave Salipartiano in his possession. The Russians turned down Manuchar's request as well as his mother's intercession; in 1805, Salipartiano became a Mingrelian crown land and Manuchar was relegated to his reduced estates. Princess-regent Nino failed to fulfill her promise to compensate her brother-in-law for his losses and an attempt by the Russian governor-general Alexander Tormasov to help defuse tensions among the Dadiani failed. Manuchar and his brother Tariel rose in open rebellion against the Mingrelian regency in January 1810. Manuchar fled to the Imeretian king Solomon, who, at that time, was on the verge of war with the Russians. After Solomon's defeat by the Russian army, Manuchar stayed in Mingrelia and did not overtly join the king in a renewed uprising against the Russian encroachment in June 1810, but he was suspected of harboring anti- Russian sentiments. After Nino was sidelined from the government of Mingrelia in 1811, Manuchar played no active role in politics.  Family  Manuchar was married to Darejan, daughter of the Abkhaz nobleman Zurab Shervashidze. He had seven children, whose descendants are still extant: * Katsia (born 1795), * Zurab, * Levan (born 1807), * Ekaterine (born 1814), * Giorgi (died c. 1864), * Aleksandre (died 1856), * Dutu (born 1820).

Marks disobeyed standing orders not to land in open ocean and rescued survivors by lashing them to the wing. His actions rendered the aircraft unflyable. He was awarded the Air Medal by Chester W. Nimitz. After the rescue, the plane was sunk by U.S. forces as it was not able to be recovered.  Early life  Adrian Marks was born in Ladoga, Indiana on February 18, 1917. He was a graduate of Northwestern University and earned a law degree from Indiana University. His father was also a lawyer. He joined the Navy prior to the United States' entry into World War II.  World War II  Marks was stationed in Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked the base on December 7, 1941. After the attack and the U.S. entry into the war, he attended flight school and became a Naval Aviator. = Rescue of USS Indianapolis survivors = After delivering components for the atomic bombs that were eventually used against Japan, to the island of Tinian the heavy cruiser USS Indianapolis was steaming, unescorted, to Leyte for training of new crew members in advance of the planned attack on the Japanese home islands, when it was hit by two torpedoes shortly after midnight on 30 July, 1945. The ship listed, took on water and capsized within twelve minutes, with a third of the crew going down with the ship. As a result of error, no distress signal had been broadcast, and the ship was not noticed as missing for days after the sinking. Some 900 survivors, many in only life jackets and without other flotation, faced fatigue, dehydration under the daylight sun and hypothermia at night, salt-water poisoning, and shark attacks. Of the approximately 900 who abandoned ship, a total of 316 survived, with 56 of them being saved by Marks. On Aug 2, A land-based patrol plane spotted the heads of survivors bobbing on the water but was unable to identify them. Marks and his flight crew were dispatched to the scene to investigate in his amphibious PBY-5A Catalina patrol plane. He spotted the survivors and dropped life rafts. One life raft was destroyed by the drop while others were too far away from the exhausted crew. Against standing orders not to land in open ocean, Marks took a vote of his crew and decided to land the aircraft in twelve-foot swells. He was able to maneuver his craft to pick up survivors. Space in the craft was limited so Marks had survivors lashed to the wing with parachute cord. It damaged the wings, rendering the aircraft unflyable. Marks rescued 56 men. After nightfall, the destroyer escort (DE 368), the first of seven rescue ships, used its search light as a beacon and instilled hope in those still in the water. The Doyle and others picked up the remaining survivors and after everyone was off Marks' PBY, the Doyle sank her. Marks was awarded the Air Medal for his actions, and it was pinned on him by Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, CINCPAC.  Later life  Following the war, Marks returned to Frankfort, Indiana and practiced real-estate law. He died on March 7, 1998 at 81 years of age and was survived by his wife, five children and ten grandchildren.

During the onslaught of the AIDS epidemic in the late 1980s, she used her salary as a real estate agent to care for AIDS patients whose families and communities had abandoned them. Because of the prejudices, fears, and stigma surrounding the disease at the time, she was often the patients' only caregiver until they eventually died. She is recognized for burying them in her own family cemetery in Hot Springs, Arkansas. She currently lives in Rogers, Arkansas.  Early life  Named Frances Ruth Coker Burks after her grandmother, Burks was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas, and was friends with Bill Clinton growing up. During her childhood, her mother was hospitalized with tuberculosis for a prolonged period, during which Burks' father was her primary caretaker until his death when she was 5, after which her mother struggled with being Burks' parent. She cites these experiences as formative for her notable empathy. Burks's family members have been buried in Files Cemetery since the late 19th century. When Burks was a young girl, her mother got into a row with Burks's uncle. To ensure he and his branch of Burks would be never buried in the same place as the rest of the family, her mother bought every grave space in the cemetery. Those were 262 plots of land in Files Cemetery in Hot Springs. Later Burks' mother left that land to her. As an adult, Burks worked as a real estate broker.  AIDS advocacy  Burks' first interaction with an AIDS patient occurred in 1984, when she was visiting a friend in the hospital. Burks' friend had cancer, so Burks spent a lot of time in the hospital. During one visit, she noticed that nurses were afraid to go into one room covered by a red bag and found out that the patient had what was then known as Gay-Related Immune Deficiency (GRID). Burks' cousin was gay, and she had an interest in learning about the disease and was curious about the patient behind the door. She met the patient, a young man who wanted to see his mother before he died. To force his mother to hear his wishes, Burks had to threaten the mother with the publication of the man's obituary in their hometown newspaper; even then, the mother called him a \\"sinner\\" and said that she would not see him or claim the body when he died. Burks then took over his palliative care and comforted him until his death 13 hours later. After finding a funeral home that would take his body for cremation, she buried his ashes in her family cemetery. After that first encounter, Burks began to receive phone calls from others who needed her help, caring for over 1,000 people over the 30 or so years she worked with them. With assistance from her daughter, Burks has buried more than 40 people in her family cemetery in Hot Springs. While her charges were still alive, she helped take them to appointments, obtain medications, apply for assistance, and more. She also kept supplies of AIDS medications on hand, as some pharmacies would not carry these medications. Because of her work with people with AIDS, as she told KLRT-TV, she and her daughter were \\"outcasts\\" and crosses were burned in her yard twice. Burks received financial assistance from gay bars in Arkansas, including the Discovery Club in Little Rock: \\"They would twirl up a drag show on Saturday night and here'd come the money. [...] That's how we'd buy medicine, that's how we'd pay rent. If it hadn't been for the drag queens, I don't know what we would have done.\\" In 1988, Norman Jones, owner of the Discovery Club, created Helping People with AIDS, where Burks worked for several years. During Bill Clinton's presidency, Burks was a White House consultant for AIDS education. Burks' patients lived longer past the national average life expectancy, catching the interest of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health which sent researchers to investigate.  Post-AIDS crisis  After medical care and social attitudes towards AIDS improved, she lived and worked in Florida as a fishing guide and funeral director. In 2012, Burks suffered a stroke and had to relearn many skills, including how to talk, read, feed herself and write; she attributes the stress of caring for victims of the AIDS crisis as a plausible influencing factor. The stroke also led to memory loss. That year, she moved back to Rogers, Arkansas, both in order to be closer to her family and because health insurance would no longer cover her after her stroke. In 2013, Burks advocated for three foster children who were removed from school due to rumors that one might be HIV-positive. After she appeared on TV as an HIV advocate for the children, the community blackballed her, the funeral home she had previously worked at rescinded her standing job offer, and other businesses refused to hire her, with the local Walmart allegedly removing a chair she sat in after finding out she did work with HIV advocacy.  Appreciation and public speaking  In August 2016, she was honored at New York City's Pride Week by not-for-profit group Broadway Sings for Pride. Burks and others are working to create a memorial for victims of AIDS in Hot Springs, which would turn the Files Cemetery into a garden that fits its current status as a sort of pilgrimage site for those affected by the crisis. She has spoken at Washington State University and Gonzaga University on her experiences,. In 2017, Rose McGowan wrote and directed an unauthorized short film, Ruth, inspired by Burks' work.  Film and book projects  Burks is currently writing a memoir based on her life story. It is called \\"All the Young Men,\\" co-authored with Kevin Carr O'Leary; expected publication date is December 1, 2020, by Grove Press. Burks is also working with producers Christina Won and Jessica Sittig on a film project based on her life and book.

He served in both houses of the Vermont legislature and commanded the 14th Vermont Infantry during the American Civil War. After the war, he became a founder of the Illinois village of Maywood, now a suburb of Chicago. Biography William T. Nichols was born in Clarendon, Vermont, the son of James Tilson Nichols and Minerva D. (Briggs) Nichols. Trained as a lawyer, he served as an assistant clerk in Vermont‚Äôs House of Representatives and then as the state's attorney in 1858‚Äì59. In 1855, he traveled to Kansas Territory and became involved in the dispute over whether the territory would enter the United States as a slave-owning or free state. At one point, he volunteered for the risky task of delivering dispatches from the journalist William A. Phillips to Charles L. Robinson, a Free-Stater who was acting as territorial governor and who would later become the first governor of the state of Kansas. For this service, Nichols was appointed to Robinson's staff with the rank of colonel. He returned to Vermont the following year. Nichols served in two volunteer Vermont regiments during the Civil War. In 1861, he enlisted as a private in the short-lived 1st Vermont Infantry, remaining until the unit was mustered out of service three months later. In 1862, he was commissioned colonel to command the 14th Vermont Infantry. He led his regiment in repulsing Pickett's Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg. Shortly after Gettysburg, the 14th Vermont Infantry was mustered out of service. Nichols's service in the state legislature overlapped the war years. In September 1861, just after the 1st Vermont Infantry was disbanded, he was elected to the Vermont House of Representatives. In 1863, after the disbanding of the 14th Vermont Infantry, he was elected to the Vermont Senate, becoming the youngest man (at age 34) ever to serve as a Vermont state senator. Colonel William Thomas Nichols' signature from the Franklin House Hotel Guest Register, Sept. 1854 - April 1855. From the private collection of H. Blair Howell. After the war, having lost money in various investments, Nichols determined to go south to invest in real estate. In October 1865, Nichols took passage on the SS Republic steamship, bound for New Orleans. It ran into a hurricane off the coast of Georgia and sank. Nichols‚Äîwho afterwards wrote a detailed account of the sinking to his wife in a letter that has survived‚Äîmanaged to get into lifeboat number 2, which two days later was rescued by the sailing ship Horace Beals. Once arrived in the south, Nichols bought two cotton plantations and invested in a tannery. Nichols did not stay in the south, however, and eventually ended up in the area of Chicago, Illinois. On April 6, 1869, with six other men, he founded the Maywood Company, a consortium that led to the incorporation of the village of Maywood, Illinois, in 1881. Maywood, now a suburb of Chicago, was named in honor of Nichols's daughter May. Nichols served as the president of the company until his death. Nichols was also the president and treasurer of a subsidiary venture that manufactured farm tools, the Chicago Scraper and Ditcher Company. In 1878, he patented a new version of the screw harrow for soil cultivation. Nichols died of pneumonia in Maywood in 1882 and is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Rutland, Vermont. Personal life Nichols married Thyrza Stevens Crampton (b. 1832), and they had two daughters, May (b. 1857) and Lucy (b. 1860). Thyrza and May both died of typhoid fever in 1865. May died before Nichols left on his ill-fated voyage on the SS Republic, and Thyrza died shortly after she learned that Nichols had survived the shipwreck. Nichols remarried, with his second wife being Thyrza's sister Helen. Nichols's great-great-granddaughter is the writer Thyrza Nichols Goodeve. She accompanied a 2004 expedition to the site of the SS Republic wreck, which had been located the year before.

Emilio was a popular, conservative radio host in the Miami area. On his show, \\"El Pueblo Habla,\\" Emilio often spoke out against the violence in Miami during the anti-Castro movement. One day in April 1976, Emilio left the radio station where he hosted his show. When he turned the ignition of his car, a bomb that had been planted under the engine exploded. He lost both legs in the attack but did not lose his life. This attack had a great impact on young Alberto Milian. Though he says he is not \\"a teary-eyed, worshipful son,\\" Milian credits his father and those of his generation with waging a principled, non-violent battle against Fidel Castro. After Emilio's death in 2001, Milian began his own investigation into the attack, though no one was ever brought to trial for the crime. Milian said he became a lawyer partly because of his father's tragedy. Where Emilio used the airwaves to get his message out, Alberto uses the law and politics. = Reputation for professional aggressiveness = Milian was referred to as a \\"pitbull\\" in a piece by the St. Petersburg Times because of his courtroom outbursts and behavior. In 1999, after prosecuting a domestic violence case for the Broward County State Attorney's Office, Milian made controversial comments in public regarding not only the defense counsel in the case, but also the jurors. He called defense attorneys \\"maggots\\" and jurors \\"lobotomized zombies.\\" Milian later said that he made those comments because the victim in the case was \\"maligned\\" by the defense during the trial. Milian left the Broward County State Attorney's Office the following year (2000) and entered solo practice. On another occasion, Milian punched a defense attorney in the lobby of a courthouse. Milian says he was provoked by the other attorney and that he acted in self-defense. This altercation led to Milian being suspended from the practice of law for a short period of time.

Ary Scheffer, 1854. In religion, ethics, philosophy, and psychology \\"good and evil\\" is a very common dichotomy. In cultures with Manichaean and Abrahamic religious influence, evil is usually perceived as the dualistic antagonistic opposite of good, in which good should prevail and evil should be defeated.Paul O. Ingram, Frederick John Streng. Buddhist-Christian Dialogue: Mutual Renewal and Transformation. University of Hawaii Press, 1986. pp. 148‚Äì149. In cultures with Buddhist spiritual influence, both good and evil are perceived as part of an antagonistic duality that itself must be overcome through achieving ≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ meaning emptiness in the sense of recognition of good and evil being two opposing principles but not a reality, emptying the duality of them, and achieving a oneness. A monism of goodness would guarantee prosperity since only good can exist, whereas a monism of evil would lead to our extinction. Evil, in a general context, is the absence or opposite of that which is described as being good. It is driven by fear and manifests through violence and division. The Judeo-Christian belief does not give a human form to Satan as they do God, to reinforce the belief that it shouldn‚Äôt manifest itself in humans. Those faithful to God in the Judeo-Christian belief reconcile with the existence of evil by acknowledging that God gave us free will, and since Satan exists, some will be tempted by the Snake with the apple from Adam & Eve. The snake represents a moral code driven by evil, where greatness and prosperity are guaranteed but not the motive, and their actions are a means to some other end that is self-interested. Often, evil is used to denote profound immorality. In certain religious contexts, evil has been described as a supernatural force. Definitions of evil vary, as does the analysis of its motives.Ervin Staub. Overcoming evil: genocide, violent conflict, and terrorism. New York: Oxford University Press, p. 32. However, elements that are commonly associated with evil involve unbalanced behavior involving expediency, selfishness, ignorance, or neglect.Caitlin Matthews, John Matthews. Walkers Between the Worlds: The Western Mysteries from Shaman to Magus. Inner Traditions / Bear & Co, 2004. p. 173. The modern philosophical questions regarding good and evil are subsumed into three major areas of study: meta-ethics concerning the nature of good and evil, normative ethics concerning how we ought to behave, and applied ethics concerning particular moral issues.Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy \\"Ethics\\" One of the five paintings of Extermination of Evil portrays Sendan Kendatsuba, one of the eight guardians of Buddhist law, banishing evil. History and etymology Every language has a word expressing good in the sense of \\"having the right or desirable quality\\" (·ºÄœÅŒµœÑŒÆ) and bad in the sense \\"undesirable\\". A sense of moral judgment and a distinction \\"right and wrong, good and bad\\" are cultural universals.Donald Brown (1991) Human Universals. Philadelphia, Temple University Press (online summary ). =Ancient world= In the eastern part of ancient Persia almost three thousand years ago a religious philosopher called Zoroaster simplified the pantheon of early Iranian gods. into two opposing forces: Ahura Mazda (Illuminating Wisdom) and Angra Mainyu (Destructive Spirit) which were in conflict. This idea developed into a religion which spawned many sects, some of which embraced an extreme dualistic belief that the material world should be shunned and the spiritual world should be embraced. Gnostic ideas influenced many ancient religions which teach that gnosis (variously interpreted as enlightenment, salvation, emancipation or 'oneness with God') may be reached by practising philanthropy to the point of personal poverty, sexual abstinence (as far as possible for hearers, total for initiates) and diligently searching for wisdom by helping others. Similarly, in ancient Egypt, there were the concepts of Ma'at, the principle of justice, order, and cohesion, and Isfet, the principle of chaos, disorder, and decay, with the former being the power and principles which society sought to embody where the latter was such that undermined society. This correspondence can also be seen reflected in ancient Mesopotamian religion as well in the conflict between Marduk and Tiamat. =Classical world= In Western civilisation, the basic meanings of Œ∫Œ±Œ∫œåœÇ and ·ºÄŒ≥Œ±Œ∏œåœÇ are \\"bad, cowardly\\" and \\"good, brave, capable\\", and their absolute sense emerges only around 400 BC, with pre-Socratic philosophy, in particular Democritus.Charles H. Kahn, Democritus and the Origins of Moral Psychology, The American Journal of Philology (1985) Morality in this absolute sense solidifies in the dialogues of Plato, together with the emergence of monotheistic thought (notably in Euthyphro, which ponders the concept of piety (œÑ·Ω∏ ·ΩÖœÉŒπŒøŒΩ) as a moral absolute). The idea is further developed in Late Antiquity by Neoplatonists, Gnostics, and Church Fathers. This development from the relative or habitual to the absolute is also evident in the terms ethics and morality both being derived from terms for \\"regional custom\\", Greek ŒÆŒ∏ŒøœÇ and Latin mores, respectively (see also si√∞r). =Medieval period= Medieval theology was largely shaped by St. Augustine of Hippo and St. Thomas Aquinas. According to the classical definition of St. Augustine of Hippo, sin is \\"a word, deed, or desire in opposition to the eternal law of God.\\" Many medieval Christian theologians both broadened and narrowed the basic concept of Good and evil until it came to have several, sometimes complex definitions such as: * a personal preference or subjective judgment regarding any issue which might be earn praise or punishment from the religious authorities * religious obligation arising from Divine law leading to sainthood or damnation * a generally accepted cultural standard of behaviour which might enhance group survival or wealth * natural law or behaviour which induces strong emotional reaction * statute law imposing a legal duty =Modern ideas= Today the basic dichotomy often breaks down along these lines: * Good is a broad concept often associated with life, charity, continuity, happiness, love, or justice. * Evil is often associated with conscious and deliberate wrongdoing, discrimination designed to harm others, humiliation of people designed to diminish their psychological needs and dignity, destructiveness, and acts of unnecessary or indiscriminate violence. The modern English word evil (Old English ) and its cognates such as the German and Dutch are widely considered to come from a Proto-Germanic reconstructed form of *ubilaz, comparable to the Hittite huwapp- ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European form and suffixed zero-grade form . Other later Germanic forms include Middle English , , , Old Frisian (adjective and noun), Old Saxon , Old High German , and Gothic . The nature of being good has been given many treatments; one is that the good is based on the natural love, bonding, and affection that begins at the earliest stages of personal development; another is that goodness is a product of knowing truth. Differing views also exist as to why evil might arise. Many religious and philosophical traditions claim that evil behavior is an aberration that results from the imperfect human condition (e.g. \\"The Fall of Man\\"). Sometimes, evil is attributed to the existence of free will and human agency. Some argue that evil itself is ultimately based in an ignorance of truth (i.e., human value, sanctity, divinity). A variety of Enlightenment thinkers have alleged the opposite, by suggesting that evil is learned as a consequence of tyrannical social structures. Theories of moral goodness =Chinese moral philosophy= In Confucianism and Taoism, there is no direct analogue to the way good and evil are opposed, although references to demonic influence is common in Chinese folk religion. Confucianism's primary concern is with correct social relationships and the behavior appropriate to the learned or superior man. Evil would thus correspond to wrong behavior. Still less does it map into Taoism, in spite of the centrality of dualism in that system, but the opposite of the basic virtues of Taoism (compassion, moderation, and humility) can be inferred to be the analogue of evil in it.Good and Evil in Chinese Philosophy C.W.

Uses strikingly similar language to that in the etymology section of this article, in the context of Chinese Idealism. =Western philosophy= Pyrrhonism Pyrrhonism holds that good and evil do not exist by nature, meaning that good and evil do not exist within the things themselves. All judgments of good and evil are relative to the one doing the judging. Spinoza Benedict de Spinoza states: Spinoza assumes a quasi-mathematical style and states these further propositions which he purports to prove or demonstrate from the above definitions in part IV of his Ethics : * Proposition 8 \\"Knowledge of good or evil is nothing but affect of joy or sorrow in so far as we are conscious of it.\\" * Proposition 30 \\"Nothing can be evil through that which it possesses in common with our nature, but in so far as a thing is evil to us it is contrary to us.\\" * Proposition 64 \\"The knowledge of evil is inadequate knowledge.\\"  Corollary \\"Hence it follows that if the human mind had none but adequate ideas, it would form no notion of evil.\\" * Proposition 65 \\"According to the guidance of reason, of two things which are good, we shall follow the greater good, and of two evils, follow the less.\\" * Proposition 68 \\"If men were born free, they would form no conception of good and evil so long as they were free.\\" Nietzsche Friedrich Nietzsche, in a rejection of the Judeo-Christian morality, addresses this in two works, Beyond Good and Evil and On the Genealogy of Morals, where he essentially says that the natural functional non-good has been socially transformed into the religious concept of evil by the slave mentality of the weak and oppressed masses who resent their masters (the strong). He also makes a critique of morality by saying that many who consider themselves to be moral are simply acting from cowardice (wanting to do evil but scared of the repercussions). = Psychology = Carl Jung Carl Jung, in his book Answer to Job and elsewhere, depicted evil as the dark side of the Devil. People tend to believe evil is something external to them, because they project their shadow onto others. Jung interpreted the story of Jesus as an account of God facing his own shadow.Stephen Palmquist, Dreams of Wholeness : A course of introductory lectures on religion, psychology and personal growth (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 1997/2008), see especially Chapter XI.  Philip Zimbardo  In 2007, Philip Zimbardo suggested that people may act in evil ways as a result of a collective identity. This hypothesis, based on his previous experience from the Stanford prison experiment, was published in the book The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil.Book website = Religion = Abrahamic religions =Bah√°'√≠ Faith= The Bah√°'√≠ Faith asserts that evil is non-existent and that it is a concept for the lacking of good, just as cold is the state of no heat, darkness is the state of no light, forgetfulness the lacking of memory, ignorance the lacking of knowledge. All of these are states of lacking and have no real existence. Thus, evil does not exist, and is relative to man. \`Abdu'l-Bah√°, son of the founder of the religion, in Some Answered Questions states: \\"Nevertheless a doubt occurs to the mind‚Äîthat is, scorpions and serpents are poisonous. Are they good or evil, for they are existing beings? Yes, a scorpion is evil in relation to man; a serpent is evil in relation to man; but in relation to themselves they are not evil, for their poison is their weapon, and by their sting they defend themselves.\\" Thus, evil is more of an intellectual concept than a true reality. Since God is good, and upon creating creation he confirmed it by saying it is Good (Genesis 1:31) evil cannot have a true reality. =Christianity= Evil according to a Christian worldview is any action, thought or attitude that is contrary to the character or will of God. This is shown through the law given in both the Old and New Testament. Therefore, evil in a Christian world view is contrasted by and in conflict with God's character or God's will. This evil shows itself through deviation from the character or will of God. Similarly, good according to a Christian worldview is any action, thought or attitude that is consistent with the character or the will of God, for God is good, the ultimate goodness. Christian theology draws its concept of evil from the Old and New Testaments. The Christian Bible exercises ‚Äúthe dominant influence upon ideas about God and evil in the Western world.‚ÄùDavid Ray Griffin, God, Power, and Evil: a Process Theodicy (Westminster, 1976/2004), 31. In the Old Testament, evil is understood to be an opposition to God as well as something unsuitable or inferior such as the leader of the fallen angels SatanHans Schwarz, Evil: A Historical and Theological Perspective (Lima, Ohio: Academic Renewal Press, 2001): 42‚Äì43. In the New Testament the Greek word poneros is used to indicate unsuitability, while kakos is used to refer to opposition to God in the human realm.Schwarz, Evil, 75. Officially, the Catholic Church extracts its understanding of evil from its canonical antiquity and the Dominican theologian, Thomas Aquinas, who in Summa Theologica defines evil as the absence or privation of good.Thomas Aquinas, SUMMA THEOLOGICA, translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province (New York: Benziger Brothers, 1947) Volume 3, q. 72, a. 1, p. 902. French-American theologian Henri Blocher describes evil, when viewed as a theological concept, as an \\"unjustifiable reality. In common parlance, evil is 'something' that occurs in experience that ought not to be.\\"Henri Blocher, Evil and the Cross (Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 1994): 10. In Mormonism, mortal life is viewed as a test of faith, where one's choices are central to the Plan of Salvation. See Agency (LDS Church). Evil is that which keeps one from discovering the nature of God. It is believed that one must choose not to be evil to return to God. Christian Science believes that evil arises from a misunderstanding of the goodness of nature, which is understood as being inherently perfect if viewed from the correct (spiritual) perspective. Misunderstanding God's reality leads to incorrect choices, which are termed evil. This has led to the rejection of any separate power being the source of evil, or of God as being the source of evil; instead, the appearance of evil is the result of a mistaken concept of good. Christian Scientists argue that even the most evil person does not pursue evil for its own sake, but from the mistaken viewpoint that he or she will achieve some kind of good thereby. =Islam= There is no concept of absolute evil in Islam, as a fundamental universal principle that is independent from and equal with good in a dualistic sense. Within Islam, it is considered essential to believe that all comes from Allah, whether it is perceived as good or bad by individuals; and things that are perceived as evil or bad are either natural events (natural disasters or illnesses) or caused by humanity's free will to disobey Allah's orders. According to the Ahmadiyya understanding of Islam, evil does not have a positive existence in itself and is merely the lack of good, just as darkness is the result of lack of light. =Judaism= In Judaism, no individual can be defined as categorically, absolutely \\"good\\" or \\"evil.\\" Judaism recognizes human beings' psychological complexity. God gave the Children of Israel the Torah as a guide to overcome evil. A common theme of medieval Jewish philosophy is that people who do good deeds will be rewarded in olam haba.\\"Good & Evil.\\" Jewish Virtual Library. 2008. 19 October 2016. Judaism has two conflicting attitudes toward the existence of evil. In one interpretation, evil is not real, it is per se not part of God's creation, but comes into existence through man's bad actions. In the other interpretation, evil was created by God since God created everything and to suggest otherwise would be to engage in dualism, and is therefore antithetical to the core Jewish belief in monotheism. Indian religions =Buddhism= Extermination of Evil. Late Heian period (12th century Japan) The primal duality in Buddhism is between suffering and enlightenment, so the good vs. evil splitting has no direct analogue in it. One may infer however from the general teachings of the Buddha that the catalogued causes of suffering are what correspond in this belief system to 'evil'.Philosophy of Religion Charles Taliaferro, Paul J. Griffiths, eds. Ch. 35, Buddhism and Evil Martin Southwold p 424Lay Outreach and the Meaning of 'Evil Person' Taitetsu Unno Practically this can refer to 1) the three selfish emotions‚Äîdesire, hate and delusion; and 2) to their expression in physical and verbal actions. Specifically, evil means whatever harms or obstructs the causes for happiness in this life, a better rebirth, liberation from samsara, and the true and complete enlightenment of a Buddha (samyaksambodhi). =Hinduism= In Hinduism the concept of dharma or righteousness clearly divides the world into good and evil, and clearly explains that wars have to be waged sometimes to establish and protect dharma, this war is called Dharmayuddha. This division of good and evil is of major importance in both the Hindu epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata. However, the main emphasis in Hinduism is on bad action, rather than bad people. The Hindu holy text, the Bhagavad Gita, speaks of the balance of good and evil. When this balance goes off, divine incarnations come to help to restore this balance.Bhagavad Gita 4.07‚Äì08 =Sikhism= In adherence to the core principle of spiritual evolution, the Sikh idea of evil changes depending on one's position on the path to liberation. At the beginning stages of spiritual growth, good and evil may seem neatly separated. However, once one's spirit evolves to the point where it sees most clearly, the idea of evil vanishes and the truth is revealed. In his writings Guru Arjan explains that, because God is the source of all things, what we believe to be evil must too come from God. And because God is ultimately a source of absolute good, nothing truly evil can originate from God. Nevertheless, Sikhism, like many other religions, does incorporate a list of \\"vices\\" from which suffering, corruption, and abject negativity arise. These are known as the Five Thieves, called such due to their propensity to cloud the mind and lead one astray from the prosecution of righteous action. These are: * Moh, or Attachment * Lobh, or Greed * Karodh, or Wrath * Kaam, or Lust * Ahankar, or Egotism One who gives in to the temptations of the Five Thieves is known as \\"Manmukh\\", or someone who lives selfishly and without virtue. Inversely, the \\"Gurmukh, who thrive in their reverence toward divine knowledge, rise above vice via the practice of the high virtues of Sikhism. These are: * Sewa, or selfless service to others. * Nam Simran, or meditation upon the divine name. Zoroastrianism In the originally Persian religion of Zoroastrianism, the world is a battle ground between the god Ahura Mazda (also called Ormazd) and the malignant spirit Angra Mainyu (also called Ahriman). The final resolution of the struggle between good and evil was supposed to occur on a day of Judgement, in which all beings that have lived will be led across a bridge of fire, and those who are evil will be cast down forever. In Afghan belief, angels and saints are beings sent to help us achieve the path towards goodness. Descriptive, meta- ethical, and normative fields It is possible to treat the essential theories of value by the use of a philosophical and academic approach. In properly analyzing theories of value, everyday beliefs are not only carefully catalogued and described, but also rigorously analyzed and judged. There are at least two basic ways of presenting a theory of value, based on two different kinds of questions: * What do people find good, and what do they despise? * What really is good, and what really is bad? The two questions are subtly different. One may answer the first question by researching the world by use of social science, and examining the preferences that people assert. However, one may answer the second question by use of reasoning, introspection, prescription, and generalization. The former kind of method of analysis is called \\"descriptive\\", because it attempts to describe what people actually view as good or evil; while the latter is called \\"normative\\", because it tries to actively prohibit evils and cherish goods. These descriptive and normative approaches can be complementary. For example, tracking the decline of the popularity of slavery across cultures is the work of descriptive ethics, while advising that slavery be avoided is normative. Meta-ethics is the study of the fundamental questions concerning the nature and origins of the good and the evil, including inquiry into the nature of good and evil, as well as the meaning of evaluative language. In this respect, meta-ethics is not necessarily tied to investigations into how others see the good, or of asserting what is good. Theories of the intrinsically good A satisfying formulation of goodness is valuable because it might allow one to construct a good life or society by reliable processes of deduction, elaboration, or prioritization. One could answer the ancient question, \\"How should we then live?\\" among many other important related questions. It has long been thought that this question can best be answered by examining what it is that necessarily makes a thing valuable, or in what the source of value consists. =Platonic idealism= One attempt to define goodness describes it as a property of the world with Platonic idealism. According to this claim, to talk about the good is to talk about something real that exists in the object itself, independent of the perception of it. Plato advocated this view, in his expression that there is such a thing as an eternal realm of forms or ideas, and that the greatest of the ideas and the essence of being was goodness, or The good. The good was defined by many ancient Greeks and other ancient philosophers as a perfect and eternal idea, or blueprint. The good is the right relation between all that exists, and this exists in the mind of the Divine, or some heavenly realm. The good is the harmony of a just political community, love, friendship, the ordered human soul of virtues, and the right relation to the Divine and to Nature. The characters in Plato's dialogues mention the many virtues of a philosopher, or a lover of wisdom. A theist is a person who believes that the Supreme Being exists or gods exist (monotheism or polytheism). A theist may, therefore, claim that the universe has a purpose and value according to the will of such creator(s) that lies partially beyond human understanding. For instance, Thomas Aquinas‚Äîa proponent of this view‚Äîbelieved he had proven the existence of God, and the right relations that humans ought to have to the divine first cause. Monotheists might also hope for infinite universal love. Such hope is often translated as \\"faith\\", and wisdom itself is largely defined within some religious doctrines as a knowledge and understanding of innate goodness. The concepts of innocence, spiritual purity, and salvation are likewise related to a concept of being in, or returning to, a state of goodness‚Äîone that, according to various teachings of \\"enlightenment\\", approaches a state of holiness (or Godliness). =Perfectionism= Aristotle believed that virtues consisted of realization of potentials unique to humanity, such as the use of reason. This type of view, called perfectionism, has been recently defended in modern form by Thomas Hurka. An entirely different form of perfectionism has arisen in response to rapid technological change. Some techno-optimists, especially transhumanists, avow a form of perfectionism in which the capacity to determine good and trade off fundamental values, is expressed not by humans but by software, genetic engineering of humans, artificial intelligence. Skeptics assert that rather than perfect goodness, it would be only the appearance of perfect goodness, reinforced by persuasion technology and probably brute force of violent technological escalation, which would cause people to accept such rulers or rules authored by them. =Welfarist theories= Welfarist theories of value say things that are good are such because of their positive effects on human well-being. Subjective theories of well-being It is difficult to figure out where an immaterial trait such as \\"goodness\\" could reside in the world. A counterproposal is to locate values inside people. Some philosophers go so far as to say that if some state of affairs does not tend to arouse a desirable subjective state in self-aware beings, then it cannot be good. Most philosophers that think goods have to create desirable mental states also say that goods are experiences of self- aware beings. These philosophers often distinguish the experience, which they call an intrinsic good, from the things that seem to cause the experience, which they call \\"inherent\\" goods. Some theories describe no higher collective value than that of maximizing pleasure for individual(s). Some even define goodness and intrinsic value as the experience of pleasure, and bad as the experience of pain. This view is called hedonism, a monistic theory of value. It has two main varieties: simple, and Epicurean. Simple hedonism is the view that physical pleasure is the ultimate good. However, the ancient philosopher Epicurus used the word 'pleasure' in a more general sense that encompassed a range of states from bliss to contentment to relief. Contrary to popular caricature, he valued pleasures of the mind to bodily pleasures, and advocated moderation as the surest path to happiness. Jeremy Bentham's book The Principles of Morals and Legislation prioritized goods by considering pleasure, pain and consequences. This theory had a wide effect on public affairs, up to and including the present day. A similar system was later named Utilitarianism by John Stuart Mill. More broadly, utilitarian theories are examples of Consequentialism. All utilitarian theories are based upon the maxim of utility, which states that good is whatever provides the greatest happiness for the greatest number. It follows from this principle that what brings happiness to the greatest number of people, is good. A benefit of tracing good to pleasure and pain is that both are easily understandable, both in oneself and to an extent in others. For the hedonist, the explanation for helping behaviour may come in the form of empathy‚Äîthe ability of a being to \\"feel\\" another's pain. People tend to value the lives of gorillas more than those of mosquitoes because the gorilla lives and feels, making it easier to empathize with them. This idea is carried forward in the ethical relationship view and has given rise to the animal rights movement and parts of the peace movement. The impact of sympathy on human behaviour is compatible with Enlightenment views, including David Hume's stances that the idea of a self with unique identity is illusory, and that morality ultimately comes down to sympathy and fellow feeling for others, or the exercise of approval underlying moral judgments. A view adopted by James Griffin attempts to find a subjective alternative to hedonism as an intrinsic value. He argues that the satisfaction of one's informed desires constitutes well-being, whether or not these desires actually bring the agent happiness. Moreover, these preferences must be life- relevant, that is, contribute to the success of a person's life overall. Desire satisfaction may occur without the agent's awareness of the satisfaction of the desire. For example, if a man wishes for his legal will to be enacted after his death, and it is, then his desire has been satisfied even though he will never experience or know of it. Meher Baba proposed that it is not the satisfaction of desires that motivates the agent but rather \\"a desire to be free from the limitation of all desires. Those experiences and actions which increase the fetters of desire are bad, and those experiences and actions which tend to emancipate the mind from limiting desires are good.\\"Baba, Meher. Discourses. 1. 1967. Sufism Reoriented. p. 93. . It is through good actions, then, that the agent becomes free from selfish desires and achieves a state of well-being: \\"The good is the main link between selfishness thriving and dying. Selfishness, which in the beginning is the father of evil tendencies, becomes through good deeds the hero of its own defeat. When the evil tendencies are completely replaced by good tendencies, selfishness is transformed into selflessness, i.e., individual selfishness loses itself in universal interest.\\"Baba, Meher. Discourses. 1. 1967. Sufism Reoriented. p. 31. . Objective theories of well-being The idea that the ultimate good exists and is not orderable but is globally measurable is reflected in various ways in economic (classical economics, green economics, welfare economics, gross national happiness) and scientific (positive psychology, the science of morality) well-being measuring theories, all of which focus on various ways of assessing progress towards that goal, a so- called genuine progress indicator. Modern economics thus reflects very ancient philosophy, but a calculation or quantitative or other process based on cardinality and statistics replaces the simple ordering of values. For example, in both economics and in folk wisdom, the value of something seems to rise so long as it is relatively scarce. However, if it becomes too scarce, it leads often to a conflict, and can reduce collective value. In the classical political economy of Adam Smith and David Ricardo, and in its critique by Karl Marx, human labour is seen as the ultimate source of all new economic value. This is an objective theory of value (see value theory), which attributes value to real production-costs, and ultimately expenditures of human labour- time (see also law of value). It contrasts with marginal utility theory, which argues that the value of labour depends on subjective preferences by consumers, which may however also be objectively studied. The economic value of labour may be assessed technically in terms of its use-value or utility or commercially in terms of its exchange-value, price or production cost (see also labour power. But its value may also be socially assessed in terms of its contribution to the wealth and well-being of a society. In non-market societies, labour may be valued primarily in terms of skill, time, and output, as well as moral or social criteria and legal obligations. In market societies, labour is valued economically primarily through the labour market. The price of labour may then be set by supply and demand, by strike action or legislation, or by legal or professional entry-requirements into occupations. Mid-range theories Conceptual metaphor theories argue against both subjective and objective conceptions of value and meaning, and focus on the relationships between body and other essential elements of human life. In effect, conceptual metaphor theories treat ethics as an ontology problem and the issue of how to work-out values as a negotiation of these metaphors, not the application of some abstraction or a strict standoff between parties who have no way to understand each other's views. Philosophical questions = Universality = Adolf Hitler is sometimes used as a modern definition of evil. Hitler's policies and orders resulted in the deaths of about 50 million people.Del Testa, David W; Lemoine, Florence; Strickland, John (2003). Government Leaders, Military Rulers, and Political Activists. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 83. . A fundamental question is whether there is a universal, transcendent definition of evil, or whether evil is determined by one's social or cultural background. C. S. Lewis, in The Abolition of Man, maintained that there are certain acts that are universally considered evil, such as rape and murder. However, the numerous instances in which rape or murder is morally affected by social context call this into question. Up until the mid-19th century, many countries practiced forms of slavery. As is often the case, those transgressing moral boundaries stood to profit from that exercise. Arguably, slavery has always been the same and objectively evil, but individuals with a motivation to transgress will justify that action. The Nazis, during World War II, considered genocide to be acceptable,Gaymon Bennett, Ted Peters, Martinez J. Hewlett, Robert John Russell (2008). The evolution of evil. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht. p. 318. as did the Hutu Interahamwe in the Rwandan genocide. One might point out, though, that the actual perpetrators of those atrocities probably avoided calling their actions genocide, since the objective meaning of any act accurately described by that word is to wrongfully kill a selected group of people, which is an action that at least their victims will understand to be evil. Universalists consider evil independent of culture, and wholly related to acts or intents. Views on the nature of evil tend to fall into one of four opposed camps: * Moral absolutism holds that good and evil are fixed concepts established by a deity or deities, nature, morality, common sense, or some other source. * Amoralism claims that good and evil are meaningless, that there is no moral ingredient in nature. * Moral relativism holds that standards of good and evil are only products of local culture, custom, or prejudice. * Moral universalism is the attempt to find a compromise between the absolutist sense of morality, and the relativist view; universalism claims that morality is only flexible to a degree, and that what is truly good or evil can be determined by examining what is commonly considered to be evil amongst all humans. Plato wrote that there are relatively few ways to do good, but there are countless ways to do evil, which can therefore have a much greater impact on our lives, and the lives of other beings capable of suffering. =Usefulness as a term= Psychologist Albert Ellis, in his school of psychology called Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, says the root of anger and the desire to harm someone is almost always related to variations of implicit or explicit philosophical beliefs about other human beings. He further claims that without holding variants of those covert or overt belief and assumptions, the tendency to resort to violence in most cases is less likely. American psychiatrist M. Scott Peck on the other hand, describes evil as militant ignorance.Peck, M. Scott. (1983; 1988). People of the Lie: The hope for healing human evil. Century Hutchinson. The original Judeo-Christian concept of sin is as a process that leads one to miss the mark and not achieve perfection. Peck argues that while most people are conscious of this at least on some level, those that are evil actively and militantly refuse this consciousness. Peck describes evil as a malignant type of self- righteousness which results in a projection of evil onto selected specific innocent victims (often children or other people in relatively powerless positions). Peck considers those he calls evil to be attempting to escape and hide from their own conscience (through self-deception) and views this as being quite distinct from the apparent absence of conscience evident in sociopaths. According to Peck, an evil person:Peck, M. Scott. (1978;1992), The Road Less Travelled. Arrow. * Is consistently self-deceiving, with the intent of avoiding guilt and maintaining a self-image of perfection * Deceives others as a consequence of their own self-deception * Psychologically projects his or her evils and sins onto very specific targets, scapegoating those targets while treating everyone else normally (\\"their insensitivity toward him was selective\\")Peck, 1983/1988, p105 * Commonly hates with the pretense of love, for the purposes of self-deception as much as the deception of others * Abuses political or emotional power (\\"the imposition of one's will upon others by overt or covert coercion\\")Peck, 1978/1992, p298 * Maintains a high level of respectability and lies incessantly in order to do so * Is consistent in his or her sins. Evil people are defined not so much by the magnitude of their sins, but by their consistency (of destructiveness) * Is unable to think from the viewpoint of their victim * Has a covert intolerance to criticism and other forms of narcissistic injury He also considers certain institutions may be evil, as his discussion of the My Lai Massacre and its attempted coverup illustrate. By this definition, acts of criminal and state terrorism would also be considered evil. =Necessary evil= Martin Luther believed that occasional minor evil could have a positive effect Martin Luther argued that there are cases where a little evil is a positive good. He wrote, \\"Seek out the society of your boon companions, drink, play, talk bawdy, and amuse yourself. One must sometimes commit a sin out of hate and contempt for the Devil, so as not to give him the chance to make one scrupulous over mere nothings... .\\"Martin Luther, Werke, XX, p58 The necessary evil approach to politics was put forth by Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, a 16th-century Florentine writer who advised tyrants that \\"it is far safer to be feared than loved.\\"Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince, Dante University of America Press, 2003, Treachery, deceit, eliminating political rivals, and the usage of fear are offered as methods of stabilizing the prince's security and power.Strauss, Leo, Thoughts on Machiavelli The international relations theories of realism and neorealism, sometimes called realpolitik advise politicians to explicitly ban absolute moral and ethical considerations from international politics, and to focus on self-interest, political survival, and power politics, which they hold to be more accurate in explaining a world they view as explicitly amoral and dangerous. Political realists usually justify their perspectives by laying claim to a higher moral duty specific to political leaders, under which the greatest evil is seen to be the failure of the state to protect itself and its citizens. Machiavelli wrote: \\"...there will be traits considered good that, if followed, will lead to ruin, while other traits, considered vices which if practiced achieve security and well being for the Prince.\\" Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan, was a materialist and claimed that evil is actually good. He was responding to the common practice of describing sexuality or disbelief as evil, and his claim was that when the word evil is used to describe the natural pleasures and instincts of men and women, or the skepticism of an inquiring mind, the things called evil are really good.Anton LaVey, The Satanic Bible, Avon, 1969, Goodness and agency =Goodwill= John Rawls' book A Theory of Justice prioritized social arrangements and goods based on their contribution to justice. Rawls defined justice as fairness, especially in distributing social goods, defined fairness in terms of procedures, and attempted to prove that just institutions and lives are good, if rational individuals' goods are considered fairly. Rawls's crucial invention was the original position, a procedure in which one tries to make objective moral decisions by refusing to let personal facts about oneself enter one's moral calculations. Immanuel Kant, a great influence for Rawls, similarly applies a lot of procedural practice within the practical application of The Categorical Imperative, however, this is indeed not based solely on 'fairness'. =Society, life and ecology= Many views value unity as a good: to go beyond eudaimonia by saying that an individual person's flourishing is valuable only as a means to the flourishing of society as a whole. In other words, a single person's life is, ultimately, not important or worthwhile in itself, but is good only as a means to the success of society as a whole. Some elements of Confucianism are an example of this, encouraging the view that people ought to conform as individuals to demands of a peaceful and ordered society. According to the naturalistic view, the flourishing of society is not, or not the only, intrinsically good thing. Defenses of this notion are often formulated by reference to biology, and observations that living things compete more with their own kind than with other kinds. Rather, what is of intrinsic good is the flourishing of all sentient life, extending to those animals that have some level of similar sentience, such as Great Ape personhood. Others go farther, declaring that life itself is of intrinsic value. By another approach, one achieves peace and agreement by focusing, not on one's peers (who may be rivals or competitors), but on the common environment. The reasoning: As living beings it is clearly and objectively good that we are surrounded by an ecosystem that supports life. Indeed, if we weren't, we could neither discuss that good nor even recognize it. The anthropic principle in cosmology recognizes this view. Under materialism or even embodiment values, or in any system that recognizes the validity of ecology as a scientific study of limits and potentials, an ecosystem is a fundamental good. To all who investigate, it seems that goodness, or value, exists within an ecosystem, Earth. Creatures within that ecosystem and wholly dependent on it, evaluate good relative to what else could be achieved there. In other words, good is situated in a particular place and one does not dismiss everything that is not available there (such as very low gravity or absolutely abundant sugar candy) as \\"not good enough\\", one works within its constraints. Transcending them and learning to be satisfied with them, is thus another sort of value, perhaps called satisfaction. Values and the people that hold them seem necessarily subordinate to the ecosystem. If this is so, then what kind of being could validly apply the word \\"good\\" to an ecosystem as a whole? Who would have the power to assess and judge an ecosystem as good or bad? By what criteria? And by what criteria would ecosystems be modified, especially larger ones such as the atmosphere (climate change) or oceans (extinction) or forests (deforestation)?For discussion, see debates on monoculture and permaculture. \\"Remaining on Earth\\" as the most basic value. While green ethicists have been most forthright about it, and have developed theories of Gaia philosophy, biophilia, bioregionalism that reflect it, the questions are now universally recognized as central in determining value, e.g. the economic \\"value of Earth\\" to humans as a whole, or the \\"value of life\\" that is neither whole-Earth nor human. Many have come to the conclusion that without assuming ecosystem continuation as a universal good, with attendant virtues like biodiversity and ecological wisdom it is impossible to justify such operational requirements as sustainability of human activity on Earth. One response is that humans are not necessarily confined to Earth, and could use it and move on. A counter-argument is that only a tiny fraction of humans could do this‚Äîand they would be self-selected by ability to do technological escalation on others (for instance, the ability to create large spacecraft to flee the planet in, and simultaneously fend off others who seek to prevent them). Another counter-argument is that extraterrestrial life would encounter the fleeing humans and destroy them as a locust species. A third is that if there are no other worlds fit to support life (and no extraterrestrials who compete with humans to occupy them) it is both futile to flee, and foolish to imagine that it would take less energy and skill to protect the Earth as a habitat than it would take to construct some new habitat. Accordingly, remaining on Earth, as a living being surrounded by a working ecosystem, is a fair statement of the most basic values and goodness to any being we are able to communicate with. A moral system without this axiom seems simply not actionable. However, most religious systems acknowledge an afterlife and improving this is seen as an even more basic good. In many other moral systems, also, remaining on Earth in a state that lacks honor or power over self is less desirable‚Äîconsider seppuku in bushido, kamikazes or the role of suicide attacks in Jihadi rhetoric. In all these systems, remaining on Earth is perhaps no higher than a third-place value. Radical values environmentalism can be seen as either a very old or a very new view: that the only intrinsically good thing is a flourishing ecosystem; individuals and societies are merely instrumentally valuable, good only as means to having a flourishing ecosystem. The Gaia philosophy is the most detailed expression of this overall thought but it strongly influenced deep ecology and the modern Green Parties. It is often claimed that aboriginal peoples never lost this sort of view. Anthropological linguistics studies links between their languages and the ecosystems they lived in, which gave rise to their knowledge distinctions. Very often, environmental cognition and moral cognition were not distinguished in these languages. Offenses to nature were like those to other people, and Animism reinforced this by giving nature \\"personality\\" via myth. Anthropological theories of value explore these questions. Most people in the world reject older situated ethics and localized religious views. However small-community-based and ecology-centric views have gained some popularity in recent years. In part, this has been attributed to the desire for ethical certainties. Such a deeply rooted definition of goodness would be valuable because it might allow one to construct a good life or society by reliable processes of deduction, elaboration or prioritisation. Ones that relied only on local referents one could verify for oneself, creating more certainty and therefore less investment in protection, hedging and insuring against consequences of loss of the value. =History and novelty= An event is often seen as being of value simply because of its novelty in fashion and art. By contrast, cultural history and other antiques are sometimes seen as of value in and of themselves due to their age. Philosopher-historians Will and Ariel Durant spoke as much with the quote, \\"As the sanity of the individual lies in the continuity of his memories, so the sanity of the group lies in the continuity of its traditions; in either case a break in the chain invites a neurotic reaction\\" (The Lessons of History, 72). Assessment of the value of old or historical artifacts takes into consideration, especially but not exclusively: the value placed on having a detailed knowledge of the past, the desire to have tangible ties to ancestral history, or the increased market value scarce items traditionally hold. Creativity and innovation and invention are sometimes upheld as fundamentally good especially in Western industrial society‚Äîall imply newness, and even opportunity to profit from novelty. Bertrand Russell was notably pessimistic about creativity and thought that knowledge expanding faster than wisdom necessarily was fatal. Goodness and morality in biology The issue of good and evil in the human visuality, often associated with morality, is regarded by some biologists (notably Edward O. Wilson, Jeremy Griffith, David Sloan Wilson and Frans de Waal) as an important question to be addressed by the field of biology.

He combined these skills to create new and different ways to conduct surveys, use and build aircraft, and teach those skills when aviation was in its infancy.  Early life  John William Miller, nicknamed 'Will', was born February 22, 1880, on a farm in Dawson, Illinois, third of four children. At age two the family moved, by covered wagon, near Adrian, Missouri and established a farm under a Civil War land grant. In 1888 when crops were destroyed by a hail storm, Miller, age 8, was allowed to work as a water boy on a Kansas City Southern Railway grading gang, peaking his interest in rail travel. The family moved again in 1891 to homestead in Friend, Nebraska. On the farm Miller learned the mechanics of farm machinery leading to a job at age 15 solving mechanical problems for McCormick Harvesting Machine Company. Miller, in 1895 at age 15, was following the efforts of aviation pioneers at the time through books and magazines available in the small town. One such person was Samuel Pierpont Langley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, who was experimenting with the development of an aircraft which he called an aerodrome. It was a steam powered unmanned glider launched with a catapult. In 1903 he made two unsuccessful attempts at manned flight. Miller was aware of Langley‚Äôs efforts and wrote him to ask for instructions on building a glider. Langley responded with a full set of plans. He realized that Langley‚Äôs plans were too complicated and costly to build. He was also studying the book, ‚ÄúProgress in Flying Machines‚Äù, by Octave Chanute. Using only the pictures in this book he proceeded to build and fly two gliders, making more than 200 flights before he was 19 years old. Miller graduated from high school in 1900 and went on to the University of Nebraska Engineering College majoring in civil engineering, graduating in 1905. Career = Railroad surveyor = After graduation, Miller immediately went to work for Burlington railroad. Following the Civil War the railroads began a period of rapid expansion, especially westward. Burlington, controlled by Charles Elliott Perkins, is an acquisition target of both Great Northern, controlled by James Hill and Union Pacific Railroad, controlled by E. H. Harriman. Crucial to the expansion is finding a route suitable to a train at a reasonable cost to build, especially through the Rocky mountains. Miller lead a survey team to scout such a route west. The work of the survey teams was to identify and map a right of way along the route, then file a right of way claim. It was not unusual for the competing survey crews to spy on each other and claim the right of way surveyed ahead of the other team. Miller learned that a route his team was working on had been so claimed. = First powered flight = Miller decided he had to find a better way to conduct the right-of-way surveys. He had an old three wheeled biplane he had been using for glider experiments on which he rigged with a 20 hp engine. After a few trial flights, he was satisfied it would fly and he could control it. He strapped a camera to the framework and successfully make aerial photographs of the rail route. He claimed this to be the first powered flight west of the Mississippi and first use of powered fixed-wing aerial photography. =University of Washington= On September 1, 1909, Miller married Florence Lovetinsky in Rapid City South Dakota. His application to teach Civil Engineering at the University of Washington was accepted for the Fall of 1909, and he and Florence moved to Seattle. In 1913, 1915, 1917 his first three children were born: Mercedes, Vivian and Charles. A fourth daughter, Josephine, was born in 1923. About the same time William Boeing had a keen interest in aviation and started a company together with George Conrad Westervelt to produce his own airplanes. Their first design was the B&W; (Boeing & Westervelt). Boeing realized that for his airplane company to be successful, he would need a source of trained aeronautical engineers. He approached the University of Washington engineering department with an offer. He would build a wind tunnel for the university if they would start a school of aeronautical engineering. At this time Miller was instructing civil engineering and was involved in several civil engineering projects around Seattle, including building the ship canal connecting Lake Washington to Puget Sound through the Ship Canal and Ballard locks, and surveying the Camp Lewis cantonment site. When the wind tunnel project proposed by Boeing began, Miller was responsible for design and construction. For their participation in the program the University offered an airplane structures class, taught by Miller, for the spring of 1917. Miller's involvement in working with Boeing on the wind tunnel lead to Boeing offering him the position of chief engineer at the newly renamed Boeing Airplane Company. Consequently, the airplane structures class was canceled, until a new instructor could be found. Thus Frank McKone was hired for the 1917-1918 academic year, Frank taught the class for just one year by which time WW1 had ended, Boeing was out of work and so Miller left to return to the University to teach the aeronautics class. Miller would initially be an Assistant Professor with the expectation he would be promoted to Associate Professor. This promise was never fulfilled and Miller left in October 1919 after only two quarters, to accept a position as Chief Engineer for the American Aircraft Corporation. Next he became President and General Manager of Western Automotive Co., later changed the name to J.W. Miller Aircraft Corp which he moved to Green Lake. In 1929 the University began discussions with Harry Guggenheim and the Guggenhiem fund for the advancement of aeronautics. This led to a grant of $290,000 to build a new building to house the new school of aeronautics. Miller, who had been serving as secretary of the Guggenheim Fund Board of Trustees, had returned to the University. For the first time the aeronautics faculty consisted of more than one instructor. = Boeing = When Boeing Airplane Company was formed in 1917, the chief engineer position was filled by Boeing's partner, George Conrad Westervelt. He was replaced by James Foley, who was with the company two years, Foley was replaced by Wong Tsu, who left after a little over a year to return to China. A plaque at the museum of flight recognizes Wong Tsu as the first Boeing chief engineer (This article preceded the recognition of Wong Tsu as Boeing's first chief engineer.) On the departure of Tsu, Miller was offered the position of chief engineer by William Boeing, because \\"he came with more practical aviation experience than all his predecessors combined\\". He accepted and was instrumental in organizing the engineering, inspection and production departments. Under his supervision the plant built five Boeing Model C aircraft per week for a Navy rush order. At the end of the war, a memo was issued announcing that the position of Chief Engineer was abolished, this was later rescinded. In the first 30 months of business Boeing had had four chief engineers. Miller returned to the University of Washington. = Civic promoter of aviation = Realizing that airplanes would need airports, In a speech before the Transportation Club in 1918 Miller advocated a search for an appropriate site. Out of that meeting, the committee would purchase the Sand Point, Seattle site. Miller served as a member of the Mayor‚Äôs Air Board in charge of the work. = Private enterprise = Miller returned to the University in January 1919 but resigned in October that year to accept a position as chief engineer for the American Aircraft Corporation of Port Angeles (no information of this company has been found). The following year he became president and general manager of the Western Automotive Services Company at 2330 Third Ave., Seattle. The company‚Äôs name later was changed to the J. W. Miller Corporation and the operations were moved to the Green Lake area. During the five years from 1920 to 1925 Miller and his associates built or rebuilt fifty-two planes. In addition, they designed and built gliders, propellers, pontoons, and other aircraft parts and conducted a ground school for flying students. Another ‚Äúfirst‚Äù in his career came during this period when, in 1920, he designed and built the first commercial enclosed cabin plane, equipped with brakes. \\"Flyers thought it was a crazy idea,\\" Miller said, \\"to put brakes on the wheels. You weren‚Äôt going to catch them nosing a plane over by slamming on the brakes. But the idea proved sound, as everyone knows today.\\" In the same year he also built a practical monoplane with folding wings and with power applied to the wheels so it could maneuver on the ground as an automobile. Miller drove it on roads for more than 100 miles at speeds from 5 to 25 miles an hour. = World War II = In 1942, Miller applied for and was offered a position with Vega Aircraft Corporation, a part of Lockheed, in Burbank California. This engagement lasted through the end of the war.

Premiering on February 23, 2020, Forensic Files II's first season consisted of 16 episodes and was broadcast on HLN, with voiceover narration by Bill Camp. The original Forensic Files broadcast over 400 episodes during its original run. On May 12, 2020, the series was renewed for a second and third season. The second season will premiere in 2021. Development and overview The last episode of the original Forensic Files series (\\"Expert Witness\\") originally aired on June 17, 2011. After the 2016 death of Forensic Files narrator Peter Thomas, the show's executive producer Paul Dowling ruled out the possibility of reviving the series, as he considered Thomas to be \\"irreplaceable\\". In October 2019, it was announced that the show would be revived with new episodes to air first-run on HLN in early 2020, with Bill Camp later announced as the new narrator. The revival was clarified as being the first season of a new show, rather than the 15th season of Forensic Files, explained by series producer Nancy Duffy as having been done to \\"differentiate the new episodes from those that came before\\". Duffy explained: \\"When we talked about bringing back Forensic Files, a lot of people thought we just meant that we were gonna be [airing] old shows that we didn't previously air on HLN and there seemed to be a confusion about that, so [we changed the title so] there could be no confusion.\\" Series creator Paul Dowling confirmed on Twitter that Forensic Files II was a new, separate show from the original Forensic Files. =Event reenactments= Unlike in the original Forensic Files program, actors were not hired to participate in reenactments of the cases dramatized in Forensic Files II. Instead, various employees of CNN and HLN were utilized to portray victims, suspects, and other individuals for dramatic recreations of real-life events. Series producer Nancy Duffy explained that the reenactments are filmed in a more \\"impressionistic\\" way than in the original series, so that the individuals used in the recreations \\"don't have to look identical\\" to the people they are portraying. As a result, faces are not shown in the recreations, only bodies from the neck down. Duffy elaborated that employees would approach her and ask to participate in the reenactments, saying that many were \\"excited\\" at the prospect of portraying individuals involved in killing, hiding, kidnapping, or the use of physical restraint. Episodes =Season 1 (2020)= The series premiere began with two back-to-back new episodes on February 23, beginning at 10:00 p.m. Eastern time. Two new episodes aired back-to-back each Sunday, with the final episode of the first season airing on April 12, Easter Sunday. {  style=\\"margin:auto;width:100%;\\" -  style=\\"background- color:#189FDD;\\"  No. in series  style=\\"background-color:#189FDD;\\"  No. in season  style=\\"background-color:#189FDD;\\"  Title  style=\\"background-color:#189FDD;\\"  Original air date } =Future seasons= In May 2020, the show was renewed for an additional two seasons of 16 episodes each, set to begin airing in 2021.

The renewed playground was built to engage a wider age range of children and to bring historical significance to the on-site Hastings Mill Museum which showcases Vancouver's logging history.300x300px  History  The historic site of Hasting Mills Museum, is what draws significance to the park. The land where the museum resides was originally owned by the Provincial Government. The building that hosts the museum was originally the Hastings Mill Store, the first general store erected in Vancouver in 1865 by British Captain Edward Stamp‚Äôs British Columbia and Vancouver Island Spar, Lumber and Sawmill Company. This building was one of the few buildings to survive the Great Fire of 1886 and was moved from the burrard inlet by barge to its current location at the foot of Alma Street by the Native Daughters of British Columbia. The museum was officially dedicated as a museum of B.C. historical relics in memory of the pioneers in 1932 and currently shows a wide range of First Nations artifacts as well as photographs from the Vancouver Pioneer Association. The Museum is open Tuesday-Sunday 1-4 pm and is closed during the months of December and January.  Construction  The Vancouver Park board collaborated with the architects at PWL Partnership in order to build a new playground which would be more child friendly and suitable for a wider range of ages. A public open house was conducted in the summer of 2015 in order to gain feedback from the community into the new design. The renovated playground opened in the fall of 2016 and now consists of two tall swings, two toddler swings, two standard swings, adventure log playground and a new playhouse with a sand area. The new playground is made entirely out of wood logs and timber to recall the history of the city's logging pioneer community.  Surrounding facilities  The Royal Vancouver Yacht Club, Jericho Tennis Club, Jericho Park and Beach are all located within walking distance from the park. Located at Jericho Park and Beach are public bathrooms, pay parking, a concession stand, and various sports fields such as a basketball court and soccer fields. A bike path connects to the Hastings Mill park. This path connects to most of Vancouver's bike paths and can take you towards Pacific Spirit Regional Park or into Downtown Vancouver and is comfortable for all ages and abilities.

It is the continuation of the Ophidian Universe, created by Ophidian Games in 2003. Ophidian 2360 is produced by Hack and Slash Games. It uses a play structure called Momentum rather than the normal turn-based system typically used in competitive card games.  Ophidian lore  Ophidian 2360 takes place in the year 2360, where a strange reptilian race known as Ophidians run gladitorial arenas for humans, aliens and demons alike. Combat consists of one Gladiator team pitted against others, for the entertainment of the masses. The true motives of the Ophidians is unknown, but many suspect a nefarious ulterior motive.  Gameplay  Each player's team is made up of up to four gladiators, made up of any VP (Victory Point) combination that adds up to exactly 10. A player can win either by defeating an opponent's Gladiators, by defeating Gladiators worth a greater number of victory points after four Waves (rounds) or by amassing 15 points worth of Cheer from the audience. Each side of the table is divided up into an Action Field, where powerful Gladiators can Attack and protect others from Attacks, and a Support Field, where less powerful Gladiators and supporting Minions usually reside. Between Waves, cards can move between the two Fields as needed. Some of the game mechanics are recognizable from previous games such as Magic: The Gathering - cards are \\"Set\\" when activated, being rotated ninety degrees to show that they have been used, which is identical to \\"tapping\\" in Magic. However, the turns of previous CCGs are not present in Ophidian, instead replaced by Momentum.

It was manufactured by Kinkisharyo and is used on all of Metro's light rail lines. The trains feature automatic train control, air conditioning, emergency intercoms, wheelchair spaces and emergency braking. History of the contract AnsaldoBreda delivered 50 P2550 LRVs to Metro between 2006 and 2011 for use on the newly expanded Gold Line. Delivery of the vehicles was approximately three years behind schedule, and Metro claimed they were overweight; thus, the agency chose not to exercise their option to purchase more beyond this initially contracted order. However, with multiple light rail lines under construction or in planning and the P865s approaching their end of life, Metro anticipated a substantial need for LRVs and thus requested bids for a new contract, for vehicles which were dubbed the P3010 series. The base P3010 contract order was for 78 cars: 63 cars for the Expo and Blue lines, and 15 cars for the Gold Line Foothill Extension. (Phase 1 of the Expo Line used P865 cars from the existing fleet.) Metro completed a contract on April 30, 2012, with delivery of the first LRV projected for 30 months later, in 2014. The contract included options for an additional 157 cars. Metro awarded the contract for the first 78 cars to Kinki Sharyo for $299 million. The remaining cars are split into four options with 28, 39, 21 and 69, respectively. If all the options are exercised, the number of LRVs would total 235, valued at a total $890 million. On July 25, 2013, Metro exercised two options (69 + 28) totaling 97 additional cars for $396.7 million. This brought the total of ordered cars to 175. As part of the option, Kinkisharyo, the El Segundo-based U.S. arm of Kinki Sharyo Co. Ltd. of Osaka, announced in December 2014 that they would retrofit an existing space in Palmdale to build the vehicles.Nelson, Laura J.

The cars began entering service in early 2016, though many were still in the testing stage when the Expo Line and Gold Line extensions opened that year, resulting in longer-than-expected headways and some crush loads. By October 2016, four LRVs were being delivered per month. In June 2017, P3010s began to be rolled out on the Blue Line, allowing Metro to begin phasing out the P865s. At the end of 2017, some of the P3010s from the Blue Line were routed for Green Line service using the Willowbrook spur and pocket track to transfer between the two lines.

He was also employed at various times as a sharecropper and as a deacon and was a civil rights activist. McMullan's first major recorded work was released in February 2017, over 30 years after his death, and was drawn from recordings he made in 1967 and 1968 in Tallahatchie County, Mississippi. Biography McMullan was born in either New Hope or Murphreesboro, Tallahatchie County, Mississippi. His musical talents were unearthed following a chance encounter in 1967 between McMullan and the American roots scholar, music collector and documentarian Gayle Dean Wardlow. Wardlow, striking up a conversation with him, discovered that McMullan had known Wardlow's idol, Charley Patton, and had played alongside him in the 1920s. This was at a time when McMullan had drifted from his Mississippi Delta homeland to perform the blues in juke joints across the Deep South. Wardlow also learned that McMullan had stopped playing the blues when he joined a church in the 1930s. Explaining why he had given up the opportunity to record with Patton, McMullan stated, \\"They only offered me $5 a song, and you know they could make thousands off just one song.\\" Wardlow's unlikely friendship with McMullan led him to visit McMullan's sharecropper shack in Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, on a number of occasions in the late 1960s, and he recorded McMullan both on tape recorder and in writing. Wardlow wrote at the time that \\"Hayes was playing like no one I had ever heard.\\" McMullan died in May 1986, aged 84. Wardlow subsequently wrote, \\"The few old snapshots I took, the handful of tunes we recorded, and his brilliant performance of 'Hurry Sundown' captured on film are all that's left of the musical legacy of Hayes McMullan, sharecropper, deacon, and‚Äîunbeknownst to so many for so long‚Äîreluctant bluesman.\\" Wardlow also transcribed the songs and wrote the sleeve notes for the 2017 release of McMullan's album Everyday Seem Like Murder Here. Another song on the album, \\"Smoke Like Lightning\\", later became \\"Smokestack Lightnin'\\" as recorded by Howlin' Wolf.

In 2000, she was honored by the Council of Canadians with Disabilities and in 2014, she drove a successful initiative to gain support for the victims of thalidomide. Her efforts resulted in life-time compensation for Canadian \\"thalidomiders\\", as well as a special fund for specific medical treatments or modifications to homes and vehicles to accommodate their disabilities. Early life Merc√©des Benegbi was born in 1962 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to her Qu√©b√©coise mother, Colette, and Moroccan father Marcos Benegbi. Her mother had been prescribed the drug thalidomide during her pregnancy, resulting in Benegbi being born with phocomelia. Her parents strongly advocated for her acceptance among other children and enrolled her in √âcole Ernest Crepeau. She was also enrolled in the Montreal Rehabilitation Institute‚Äôs 20-year plan to assist victims and their families in meeting the everyday challenges their children would face. Her father invented a visor for Benegbi to use as a child to prevent her harming her face when she fell, as she had no arms to break her fall. As she was their only child, Benegbi's parents were supportive and at the same time, challenged her to excel and be as independent as she was able to be. Career Benegbi has worked as a disability advocate for over twenty years, serving on the board of the Confederation of Organizations of Persons with Disabilities of Quebec (), for which she was honored in 2000 by the Council of Canadians with Disabilities. Since 2002, she has been the executive director of the Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada and has become one of the leading advocates for Canadian thalidomide victims. In 2014, Benegbi led a successful initiative to gain compensation from the Canadian government for the children whose lives were impacted by the approval of thalidomide for use in the country, after years of the government refusing to take responsibility for their failure to protect the victims. On-going health issues and lack of ability to work, caused by their permanent disabilities drove Benegbi to press for a compensation package similar to those victims of the drug in Europe had received. In 2015, the compensation plan was announced, which provides a tax- free, life-time pension for the \\"thalidomiters\\". It also provided a one-time lump sum payment as well as a special medical fund to enable victims to obtain surgeries specific to their conditions or adapting a home or vehicle for special needs. Benegbi has spoken throughout the world on the devastating effects to fetal development caused by thalidomide. In 2016, she was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of Windsor.

The free factor complex was originally introduced in a 1998 paper of Hatcher and Vogtmann. Like the curve complex, the free factor complex is known to be Gromov-hyperbolic. The free factor complex plays a significant role in the study of large-scale geometry of operatorname{Out}(F_n). Formal definition For a free group G a proper free factor of G is a subgroup Ale G such that A e {1}, A e G and that there exists a subgroup Ble G such that G=Aast B. Let nge 3 be an integer and let F_n be the free group of rank n. The free factor complex mathcal F_n for F_n is a simplicial complex where: (1) The 0-cells are the conjugacy classes in F_n of proper free factors of F_n, that is :mathcal F_n^{(0)}={[A]  Ale F_n text{ is a proper free factor of } F_n }. (2) For kge 1, a k-simplex in mathcal F_n is a collection of k+1 distinct 0-cells {v_0, v_1, dots, v_k}subset mathcal F_n^{(0)} such that there exist free factors A_0,A_1,dots, A_k of F_n such that v_i=A_i for i=0,1,dots, k, and that A_0le A_1le dots le A_k. [The assumption that these 0-cells are distinct implies that A_i e A_{i+1} for i=0,1,dots, k-1]. In particular, a 1-cell is a collection {[A], [B]} of two distinct 0-cells where A,Ble F_n are proper free factors of F_n such that Alneq B. For n=2 the above definition produces a complex with no k-cells of dimension kge 1. Therefore, mathcal F_2 is defined slightly differently. One still defines mathcal F_2^{(0)} to be the set of conjugacy classes of proper free factors of F_2; (such free factors are necessarily infinite cyclic). Two distinct 0-simplices {v_0,v_1}subset mathcal F_2^{(0)} determine a 1-simplex in mathcal F_2 if and only if there exists a free basis a,b of F_2 such that v_0=[langle arangle], v_1=[langle brangle]. The complex mathcal F_2 has no k-cells of dimension kge 2. For nge 2 the 1-skeleton mathcal F_n^{(1)} is called the free factor graph for F_n. Main properties * For every integer nge 3 the complex mathcal F_n is connected, locally infinite, and has dimension n-2. The complex mathcal F_2 is connected, locally infinite, and has dimension 1. * For n=2, the graph mathcal F_2 is isomorphic to the Farey graph. * There is a natural action of operatorname{Out}(F_n) on mathcal F_n by simplicial automorphisms. For a k-simplex Delta={[A_0],dots, [A_k]} and varphiin operatorname{Out}(F_n) one has varphi Delta:={[varphi(A_0)],dots, [varphi(A_k)]}. *For nge 3 the complex mathcal F_n has the homotopy type of a wedge of spheres of dimension n-2.Allen Hatcher, and Karen Vogtmann, The complex of free factors of a free group.

It was released on May 5, 2017, by The Orchard.  Plot  Entrepreneur Ray Moody runs a business in which clients pay him for the experience of a simulated kidnapping. An interview for a loan goes poorly when Ray attempts to explain his business model to an incredulous banker. Although Ray has a strained relationship with his sister Natalie, he turns to her husband Tom for the money. Stuart, an overeater, has contracted Ray to stage an aggressive intervention over eight hours. Ray tells Stuart he cheats on his diet, and then forces Stuart to consume a dozen of his favourite hamburgers. After the eight-hour session ends, Stuart thanks Ray and asserts that he has lost his appetite for hamburgers. Ray is elated when a new client, Anna, contacts him, seeking an extended session that will last the entire weekend. His joy turns to scepticism when Anna requests that he hit her. Although he initially refuses the job, Ray calls her back and accepts. After conducting their business over the phone, Ray performs surveillance on her, and she leaves him a message telling him to be more discreet. Ray simulates a carjacking and takes her hostage that weekend, never breaking character. Impressed with her own ability to stay in character, Ray is forced to take a break to reassure himself that he has the confidence and skill to pull off the scenario. Ray aggressively interrogates Anna about a made-up client, demanding access to non-existent files. Although initially scared and obedient, Anna soon adopts a more mocking tone with him, accusing him of being a pervert who has abducted her under flimsy premises. Enraged, he almost strikes her, and she again mocks him for his reluctance. After hitting her, Ray leaves to pay Tom back. Natalie discovers the envelope filled with money and surmises its purpose, angry that her husband would finance Ray's bizarre business. Natalie confronts Ray and realizes that he is using their parents' house for his scenarios; Ray becomes frustrated when she interrupts his session. After she leaves, Ray hears on the news the police are investigating Anna's disappearance. Rattled, Ray attempts to talk to Anna, who stabs him in the back with an improvised weapon. The police show up at Ray's house. Panicking, he binds Anna in the basement as he deflects the police officers' questions. After bandaging himself, he attempts to clear up the situation with Anna, who claims to have no knowledge of his business. Ray shows her the contract she digitally signed and plays back her earlier phone message, both of which she dismisses as fabrications. Confused and fearing he has kidnapped an unwilling person, Ray agrees to let her go. However, at the last moment, he swallows her car keys, saying that he can not let her go until they figure out an alibi that allows him ‚Äì and Natalie ‚Äì to escape jail time. After Anna shoots him several times with his pellet gun, Ray attempts to regurgitate the keys, only for Anna to slip and fall unconscious. When Anna wakes, Ray has taken her to a vacation home. There, they discuss their pasts, both revealing that they are divorced. Ray says his ex-wife, who co-founded the business, accused him of criminal wrongdoing. She agrees not to go to the police, but asks him to explain more details about what she accused him of doing. Anna suggests he gets off on violence and power, and he chokes her in response. She knocks him unconscious with a fire poker. Armed with Tom's rifle, Anna takes Ray hostage, threatening to shoot him unless he submits to riding in her car's trunk, a punishment he had subjected her to several times. At the end of the ride back to the city, Anna happily thanks him for the experience and offers to invest in his business, revealing to the audience and Ray that she was indeed a willing participant the whole time. Stunned, Ray can only mumble a response before he stumbles back home to see Stuart in a restaurant. As Stuart waves at him, Ray cries, then laughs when he sees Stuart is eating a salad.

It was probably built by the powerful Vaz family to expand the territory controlled by nearby Alt-S√ºns Castle. Traditionally it was believed that the alternative name Canova was the original name and referred to a local noble family. However the first mention of the turri de Canofa (Canova is Romansh for new house) appears in 1390. When the Vaz family died out in 1338, their estates in the area were inherited by the Counts of Werdenberg-Sargans. In 1392 Anna von Rh√§z√ºns received the castle from her husband Count Johann von Werdenberg-Sargans. In 1437 the two castles were specifically mentioned in a treaty between Heinrich von Werdenberg- Sargans and the Cantons of Schwyz and Glarus. The southern wall of the tower was intentionally collapsed by the victorious attackers in 1451 during a war between the residents of the Schams valley against Werdenberg-Sargans. As part of the peace treaty, the Counts could rebuild the castle if the League of God's House gave their approval. As they were never able to secure permission, the castle was allowed to fall into ruin. During the 16th century, the ruins were mentioned as a landmark as was the nearby farm. In 1574 Andreas von Salis zu Reitberg inherited the farm and the ruined castle. Today the property is owned by the Planta family. Castle site The castle had an uncommon round donjon that was five stories tall. The southern side of the tower was destroyed during the 1451 war, but the northern side remains intact and still reaches its original height. The tower walls are up to thick. Fireplaces, two garderobes and sitting places by the windows show that the third and fourth stories were permanently inhabited. The top of the tower was crowned with crenellations and a sloping wooden roof that was protected by the stone battlements. The tower was surrounded by a stone ring wall that was about larger than the tower. The rectangular outer bailey was to the south-west of the round tower. It was defended by steep slopes and a ditch. Very little of the ring wall or outer bailey still remain.

It was originally described in 1840 by the English zoologist and philatelist John Edward Gray. Description Aquilonastra burtoni is a small species of sea star with up to 8 rays, frequently 7, they frequently demonstrate an asymmetrical form after fissiparous division while the form of larger specimens is often symmetrical with 5 equal rays; there is an inconspicuous madreporite in most interradii. The rays narrow basally, tapering to a narrow rounded distal part which is finger-like. Each of the plates on the oral surface has a grouping of 3 crowded mobile tapering spines in their centres, while those of the dorsal surface have a dense group of short tubercles. It is a greenish gray colour on the dorsal sid with a large, irregular, purplish brown blotch in the centre which is surrounded by red spots at the bases of the arms. The arms are normally a darker greenish near their distal portions where there is also a pale median line. Distribution The native range of Aquilonastra burtoni is the north western Indian Ocean including the Gulf of Suez, Gulf of Aqaba, the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, Sea of Oman and the coasts of eastern Africa south to Zanzibar. It has been reported from a wider range east to Hawaii and south to Madagascar but these records appear to refer to other similar Aquilonastra species. It was first recorded within the Suez Canal in 1926 and then in the eastern Mediterranean in 1966, and by 2010 it had been recorded from Cyprus. Biology Aquilonastra burtoni is a benthic species which occurs in shallow waters between 0 and 10m in depth where is common in the lower the lower shore below the low tide line under rock slabs and boulders. It is uncommon in the gravel tails and gravelly hydraulic banks, its preferred food is seems to be the rich shade-loving animals that live underneath blacks and slabs, including sponges such as Spirastrella spp and Timea spp. or Ascidiacea, for example Trididemnum or Eudistoma. In sexual reproduction the eggs and sperm are broadcast and the larvae are planktonic lecithotrophs, i.e. they rely on a yolk for their initial nutrition. In the fissiparous population off the Mediterranean coast of Israel histological examination showed spermatogenesis in all the mature individuals and the peak of sperm production was coincident with the peak of fissiparous reproduction. This has been taken to indicate that the origin of the Mediterranean colonisers was from a fissiparous population in the Red Sea. Taxonomy Aquilonastra burtoni was originally named Asterina burtoni by John Edward Gray from specimens collected by a Mr John Burton in the Red Sea. A second species was named Asterina wega and this name was used to describe a separate multi armed form which reproduced by fissipary while A. burtoni was used for the five armed sexually reproducing form. Further studies have suggested that this is a complex of species with the three fissiparous Mediterranean populations named as Aquilonastra yairi sp. nov. and the specimens taken in the Gulf of Aqaba as A. burtonii sensu stricto while the non-fissiparous specimens from Eilat were described as Aquilonastra marshae sp. nov., with the caveat tha populations elsewhere still have to be properly studied to determine their status.

He took various odd jobs but his father specifically forbid him from becoming a musician. Nevertheless, Al was drawn toward music and taught himself the piano in secret. Eventually he became good enough to join the Musicians' Union. Samuel learned of his son's vocation when one day the Union sent teenaged Sherman to play piano in Sherman's orchestra. Al would continue in the music business, against Samuel's direct orders eventually becoming a successful Tin Pan Alley songwriter from the 1920s-1950s.

It is designed to be a practical approach that addresses the tactical issues that prevent finance departments from being more strategic. Continuous accounting embraces three main principles:http://blog.ventanaresearch.com/2015/10/30/continuous-accounting- enables-a-strategic-finance-department *The first is the need to automate mechanical, repetitive accounting processes in a continuous, end-to-end fashion. Managing processes in a controlled, end-to-end fashion improves efficiency and it ensures data integrity. Ensuring data integrity is crucial because the absence of data integrity is the root cause of a lot of time- consuming work that departments perform that adds little value to the rest of the company. *The second is optimizing the accounting calendar by distributing workloads continuously and evenly over the accounting period (the month, quarter or year) to eliminate bottlenecks and optimize when and in which order accounting tasks are performed. *The third is establishing a culture of continuous improvement in managing the accounting cycle. A continuous improvement culture sets increasingly rigorous objectives, reviews performance to those objectives frequently and makes addressing performance shortcomings a departmental priority. Continuous accounting requires the effective use of information (data) and technology (software) to automate accounting and finance processes in an end-to-end fashion. This does not mean that every step is entirely hands-off, but processes are designed to automate the execution of as many steps as is practical. It also involves automating all the hand-offs that take place between people in performing the process as well as any managing all administrative and approval steps that must take place. End-to- end automation has two objectives. One is to cut down on the time employees spend doing work that computers can do faster and more consistently. The second is to improve the quality of the data in a company's financial records to ensure greater accuracy, consistency and control of financial data. In this respect, continuous accounting supports the COSO Framework. Automation improves data quality because eliminating human intervention in the handling of data substantially reduces the potential for errors in a well-controlled IT environment. Consequently, by design, end-to-end financial process automation strengthens financial controls and facilitates auditing. Spreadsheets and manual calculations create the need for time-consuming reconciliations and checks to spot errors and identify their source. An important design objective for end-to-end automation is to ensure that there is a single authoritative source for the data that is used in accounting processes. Technology exists to ensures that even with multiple accounting and financial management systems and data stores, there is no duplication of data that requires checks and reconciliations. To second component of continuous accounting focuses on optimizing workloads. Increasingly, financial software gives companies greater flexibility. The classic accounting calendar with its monthly, quarterly and annual cycles developed over centuries as a practical approach to dealing with the limitations of the paper based systems and manual calculations. Their frequency represents a trade-off aimed at balancing efficiency and control: waiting until there are enough entries to justify performing the work, but not waiting too long to identify fraud, procedural issues and accounting errors. The monthly accounting close developed for many accounting tasks because a weekly cadence proved to be too short a period to be efficient while quarterly was too long to wait. Other accounting processes are typically handled on a quarterly or semi-annual basis because this longer frequency reflects a more appropriate trade-off of efficiency and control. Even when computers were first used to automate bookkeeping and accounting, the old accounting calendars persisted. The limitations of early business computing technology forced system designers to use batch processing. From an accounting process standpoint, batch systems do not offer much of an improvement over paper-based ones in changing the timing of finance and accounting processes. They impose the same need to balance efficiency and control in taking computing systems off-line to handle computations and summarizations in a way that does not interfere with transactions processing. Only within the past decade has information technology reached a performance threshold that eliminates the need for such batch processing. Corporations that use batch-less accounting systems have greater freedom to schedule their accounting cycle. The third principle of continuous accounting is continuous (or continual) improvement. Decades ago, continuous improvement revolutionized manufacturing worldwide and culture of manufacturing departments. Continuous improvement can be used as a management approach to overcome organizational inertia. This is particularly difficult in accounting departments because accounting is a discipline that requires consistency, which is necessary for the faithful presentation of a company's financial performance and health. But performing accounting processes the same way may not be the best way. Continuous improvement requires ongoing assessments to identify issues and how to address them, as well as a mindset that accepts that these sorts of changes will be made.
