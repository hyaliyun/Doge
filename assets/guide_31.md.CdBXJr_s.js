He was also a talented and prolific amateur artist who published many books featuring engravings and lithographs featuring Indian subject matter. Life and career Charles D'Oyly was born in Murshidabad, India on 17 September 1781. He was the son of Sir John-Hadley D'Oyly, 6th Baronet and Diana Rochfort.The Peerage Online,http://www.thepeerage.com/p37206.htm His father, was the resident of the East India Company at the Court of Nawab Babar Ali of Murshidabad. As a boy, D'Oyly went to England with the family in 1785 and received his first formal education there. In 1798 he returned to India as Assistant to the Registrar in the Court of Appeal in Calcutta. In 1803 he was appointed as 'Keeper of the Records' in the office of the Governor General.http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4147631 After the death of his father in 1818, D'Oyly inherited the baronetage and received a knighthood.

In the following years, he held posts as Collector of Dhaka from 1808 to 1817; City Collector of Customs in Calcutta (1818); d the Opium Agent of Bihar and the Commercial Resident of Patna (1821-1831) and lastly the Senior Member of the Board of Customs, Salt, Opium and of the Marine (1833). Between 1832 and 1833, D'Oyly took leave at the Cape of Good Hope, returning to Calcutta to fill the post of Senior Member of Customs, before retiring in 1838. He married firstly Marian Greer, daughter of William Greer; and secondly Elizabeth Jane Ross, daughter of Major Thomas Ross. After serving with the company for forty years, his failing health compelled D'Oyly to leave India in 1838. The greater part of the rest of his life was spent in Italy. D'Oyly died in Italy on 21 September 1845 without issue.Debrett, J., The Baronetage of England, Volume 1, 1824, p. 325; 'The Peerage Online,http://www.thepeerage.com/p37206.htm During his time in Dacca, he painted a wide variety of pictures, especially the Mughal ruins which he published in a folio-size book with fifteen engravings entitled Antiquties of Dacca (now Dhaka in Bangladesh) in London 1814 and in various reprints from 1823 onwards. A short historical account of Dhaka was also appended to each book. James Atkinson wrote these accounts, with engravings by Edwin Landseer. The Antiquities of Dacca became an important social document of the period. Whilst in Dacca, D'oyly met the celebrated artist, George Chinnery,Sotheby's, Catalog Note, Online: http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2012/modern-and-contemporary- south-asian-art-including-indian-miniature-paintings/lot.17.html who spent a great deal of time staying with D‚ÄôOyly during his early career. The pair became close friends and went on several expeditions together. Chinney had a considerable influence on the development of D'Oyly's artistic style. D'Oyly collaborated with Christopher Webb Smith in producing a number of books. Two of these were Feathered Game of Hindostan (1828) and Oriental Ornithology (1829), Webb Smith depicting the birds and the foliage, and D'Oyly doing the backgrounds. One of D'Oyly's most productive periods was while he was Patna (1821-1831), where he sts of producing numerous paintings and sketches. In 1848 Dickinson & Co., 114 New Bond Street, London, published D'Oyly's Calcutta drawings in a large folio-size book titled Views of Calcutta and its Environs in 1848. The original drawings for this work were probably made between 1833 and 1838 while D'Oyly was Senior Member of the Board of Customs, Salt, and Opium and Marine Board in Calcutta, but some must have been completed between 1839 and 1845 when he retired. The complete work was published after D'Oyly's death in Italy in 1845.

Sket Dance won the 55th annual Shogakukan Manga Award in 2009 for best sh≈çnen manga. An anime adaptation, produced by Tatsunoko Production, premiered on April 7, 2011 on TV Tokyo. On March 30, 2011, Crunchyroll announced that it would simulcast the Sket Dance anime series. Plot The manga focuses on the (mis)adventures of Kaimei High School's campus support club, the Sket Dance (Katakana: \\"„Çπ„Ç±„ÉÉ„Éà„Éª„ÉÄ„É≥\\"; Kanji: \\"Âä©‰∫∫Âõ£\\"; Transliteration: \\"Suketto Dan\\"; Translation: \\"Helper's Club\\"; included English acronym: \\"SKET (Support, Kindness, Encouragement, and Troubleshoot)\\"). Dedicated to the general improvement of campus life, the Sket Dance is devoted to solving any and all problems submitted by the staff or student body. However, due to its general lack of meaningful assignments and the unglamorous reputation of being just a 'group of handymen', the Sket Dance is treated with widespread contempt and it is composed of only three members. The story is told through a series of short, self-contained stories focusing on cases undertaken by the Sket Dan and is usually told in the space of one or two chapters. Cases to date focus on a variety of issues from more humorous cases (like chasing monkeys around the school or helping a wanna-be samurai find out why he cannot win kendo tournaments) to more serious cases (like those hinting at Himeko's violent past or those concerning near-terminal illness). Media Manga Sket Dance is written and illustrated by Kenta Shinohara. The series debuted in January 2006 as a oneshot in Akamaru Jump, with another oneshot appearing seven months later in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump, the latter more closely resembling the serialized version. The serialized series was first published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump on July 14, 2007. The series finished on July 8, 2013. The 288 individual chapters have been published into thirty-two tank≈çbon volumes published by Shueisha with the first being released on November 2, 2007. The last volume was released on August 2, 2013. Outside Japan, the series is licensed by Tong Li Publishing in Taiwan. Drama CDs Shueisha released one drama CD Sket Dance „Éâ„É©„ÉûCD () on October 30, 2009, and a second Sket Dance 2 „Éâ„É©„ÉûCD () was released on April 28, 2010.

He was a descendant of the wealthy and influential Sturdza family of Romanian landowners, politicians and boyars,Further reading Alexandru Sturdza and Roxandra Sturdza and played a brief role in Romanian interwar politics. Mihail Sturdza, originally a conservative and nationalist, was a member of the Iron Guard. As a supporter of the leader of the Iron Guard Horia Sima, he was a brief period (September 14, 1940 - January 26, 1941) Minister of Foreign Affairs of Romania during the so-called National Legionary State after the abdication of King Carol II. After several diplomatic posts (e.g. in Vienna, Budapest and in Washington as charg√© d'affaires) Sturdza was in 1929 appointed as minister plenipotentiary for Latvia, Estonia and Finland, in Riga. In that capacity he acted in 1932 as Romania's representative in the negotiations with Soviet Russia about a non-aggression agreement. The negotiations failed, due to the Soviet demand to discuss and annex the disputed territory of Bessarabia, which was a part of the Kingdom of Romania. Sturdza was from 1938 Romanian ambassador in Denmark. As Foreign Minister Sturdza attended with the German minister of Foreign Affairs Joachim von Ribbentrop the signature on November 23, 1940 of the Tripartite Pact with Nazi Germany between Adolf Hitler and the Romanian head of government General Ion Antonescu. In December 1940 Sturdza obtained the replacement of the German ambassador Wilhelm Fabricius with Manfred Freiherr von Killinger, perceived as more sympathetic to the Iron Guard.Deletant, pp. 63, 301 After the clash between the Iron Guard and General Ion Antonescu in January 1941 (see Legionary Rebellion), which was won by the latter, Sturdza had to resign. Antonescu took over leadership of the ministry, with the compliant diplomat Constantin Greceanu as his right hand. After the defeat of the Iron Guard in January 1940, Sturdza followed party leader Horia Sima into exile; first in Sofia, Bulgaria and afterward in Germany and Denmark. Sturdza became again Minister of Foreign Affairs in a Romanian government in Vienna from 10 December 1944 until the end of World War II. After World War II, Sturdza fled first to Denmark, where he stayed until 1947. Afterwards, he found refuge in Spain and later in the USA, where he kept strong ties with other members of the Iron Guard in exile. He wrote several publications about the history of his native country and international affairs. In later years he was involved in right wing organisations. In 1968, he published his memoirs, which took approval in right wing circles for the cold war- and anti-communist points of view.

It also is in the Palearctic realm. Geography The Dinaric Mountains mixed forests compose the montane forest region of the Dinaric Alps. This mountain range stretches along the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea and occupy 58,200 km¬≤ (22,500 mi¬≤) in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, northern Albania, and northeastern Italy. With high precipitation ranges and an abundance of limestones, karst relief is prominent. Climate The climate of the ecoregion is wet and extremely humid. Precipitation ranges are generally above 1500 mm and ranges between 2000 and 3500 mm are common. Maximums measured in the hinterland of the Bay of Kotor surpass annual averages beyond 4500 mm (Crkvice), the highest precipitation ranges in Europe and one of the highest of the Northern Hemisphere. It is part of K√∂ppen's temperate type with humid summers (Cfs) and mountain snow climates (Dfs). Due to snow abundance and avalanching, alpine biotopes are common for all high mountains. Several small glaciers still persist in the Durmitor and Prokletije ranges, the Dinaric Alps' highest massifs. Flora The wide altitudinal range of this ecoregion hosts a range of plant communities. The highest elevations (above 1,500 m) are covered with conifer forests, with a mixed broadleaf vegetation and occurring at lower elevations. The conifer zone is dominated by the Norway spruce, silver fir, and European black pine with an admixture of European beech. Dinaric calcareous block fir forest grows on limestone outcrops. The dominant species of the lower zones include various deciduous oaks (Quercus frainetto, Q. pubescens, and Q. cerris) and the oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis). The South European flowering ash (Fraxinus ornus) marks the submediterranean zone at region below 600‚Äì1000 m (from N to S). Phytogeographically, the ecoregion is shared between the Adriatic and East Mediterranean provinces of the Mediterranean Region, within the Holarctic Kingdom (according to Armen Takhtajan's delineation). Protected areas 35,989 km¬≤, or 5%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Another 1% of the ecoregion's area has relatively intact but unprotected forests.Eric Dinerstein, David Olson, et al. (2017). An Ecoregion-Based Approach to Protecting Half the Terrestrial Realm, BioScience, Volume 67, Issue 6, June 2017, Pages 534‚Äì545; Supplemental material 2 table S1b. Protected areas in the ecoregion include Triglav National Park in Slovenia, Plitvice Lakes National Park in Croatia, Biogradska Gora, Durmitor, and Prokletije national parks in Montenegro, and Valbon√´ Valley National Park in Albania.

From a standpoint of environmental scepticism, Booker seeks to combine an analysis of the science of global warming with the consequences of political decisions to reduce emissions and claims that, as governments prepare to make radical changes in energy policies, the scientific evidence for global warming is becoming increasingly challenged. He asserts that global warming is not supported by a significant number of climate scientists, and criticises how the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) presents evidence and data, in particular citing its reliance on potentially inaccurate global climate models to make temperature projections. Booker concludes, \\"it begins to look very possible that the nightmare vision of our planet being doomed\\" may be imaginary, and that, if so, \\"it will turn out to be one of the most expensive, destructive, and foolish mistakes the human race has ever made\\". The book's claims were strongly criticised by science writer Philip Ball, but the book was praised by several columnists. The book opens with an erroneous quotation, which Booker subsequently acknowledged and promised to correct in future editions. The book was Amazon UK's fourth bestselling environment book of the decade 2000‚Äì10.  Synopsis  The book consists of three parts and an epilogue. Booker sums up the book's contents in a long epilogue, which quotes Theseus in A Midsummer Night's Dream: > In the night, imagining some fear, How easy is a bush supposed a bear Booker contends that in this quote Shakespeare is identifying that \\"when we are not presented with enough information for our minds to resolve something into certainty, they may be teased into exaggerating it into something quite different from what it really is\\". The first chapter of the book is the introduction, where Booker warns us of the risk posed by 'those measures being proposed by the world's politicians in the hope that they can avert' climate change. It talks about the ineffectiveness of wind turbines, and how they produce the same amount of energy per year as one coal-fired power station (3.9 gigawatts). In the prologue, Booker claims that many people, including the former U.S President Barack Obama, were 'seriously misinformed' about the evidence surrounding Global Warming and the effects it might have on the world. Part I of the book tells how Climate Change has risen to 'the top of the World's political agenda' so quickly, and the methods he thinks the Inter- Governmental Panel on Climate Change used to convince politicains that the issue was genuine, including James Hansen's famous hearing before the American Senate, where he allegedly turned the room temperature up in order the strengthen his point. Part II of the book is entitled 'Gore and the EU unite to Save the Planet'. It depicts how, panic-stricken, the world's politicians took action to encourage more renewable forms of energy, and the closure of the world's non-renewable power stations. Finally, Part III speaks of how the Global Warming 'consensus begins (began) to crumble.' It claims that the evidence behind Climate Change and its causes is coming under increased scrutiny, and that by no means is the science \\"settled\\".  Reception  The book received a positive reception from non-scientists in the media: In The Spectator, Rodney Leach said it was one of the best of its type, remarking that Booker \\"narrates this story with the journalist's pace and eye for telling detail and the historian's forensic thoroughness which have made him a formidable opponent of humbug\\". Columnist James Delingpole, himself the author of a denialist book, described the book as \\"another of those classics which any even vaguely intelligent person who wants to know what's really going on needs to read\\". Writing in The Herald, Brian Morton was largely sympathetic to the position taken by Booker in the book, attributing global warming to natural causes. A positive review by Henry Kelly in The Irish Times, referring to the book as \\"meticulously researched, provocative and challenging\\", was criticised by Irish environmental campaigner and climatechange.ie website founder John Gibbons, who said that the decision by The Irish Times to allow Kelly to review The Real Global Warming Disaster was part of a recent trend of \\"the media giving too much coverage to 'anti-science' climate change deniers and failing to convey the gravity of the threat, making readers and viewers apathetic\\". In The Scotsman, writer and environmentalist Sir John Lister-Kaye chose The Real Global Warming Disaster as one of his books of the year, writing that \\"though barely credible in places\\" this was an \\"important, brave book making and explaining many valid points\\". Scientist Philip Ball, on the other hand, wrote in his review in The Observer that the book was \\"the definitive climate sceptics‚Äô manual\\" in that it makes an uncritical presentation of \\"just about every criticism ever made of the majority scientific view\\" on global warming. Though expressing \\"a queer kind of admiration for the skill and energy with which Booker has assembled his polemic\\", Ball called the claims made by the author \\"bunk\\". Ball also criticised Booker's tactic of introducing global warming deniers \\"with a little eulogy to their credentials, while their opponents receive only a perfunctory, if not disparaging, preamble\\". Houghton misquotation The book opens with an incorrect quotation which wrongly attributes to John T. Houghton the words \\"Unless we announce disasters, no one will listen\\". The publishers apologised for this misquotation, confirmed that it would not be repeated, and agreed to place a corrigendum in any further copies of the book. In an article which appeared in The Sunday Telegraph on 20 February 2010, Booker wrote \\"we shall all in due course take steps to correct the record, as I shall do in the next edition of my book\\". Houghton felt that Booker continued to misstate his position regarding the role of disasters in policy making, and he referred the matter to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC Reference 101959), following whose involvement The Sunday Telegraph published on 15 August a letter of correction by Houghton stating his actual position, that adverse events shock people and thereby bring about change. An article supportive of Houghton appeared in the New Scientist magazine.

It was based in Huntersville, North Carolina. Sprint Cup Series Car No. 46 History Erik Darnell in the No. 46 at Pocono Raceway in 2011 Dusty Whitney, owner of Whitney Motorsports, was involved with K-Automotive Motorsports until 2009, when he left the team and formed his own NASCAR Sprint Cup team. Whitney Motorsports began in 2010 with Rookie of the Year contender Terry Cook in the No. 46 Dodge, who was to run full-time. Cook only managed to qualify for 3 out of the first 10 races, at Bristol and at Phoenix, and left the team following Richmond. He had a best finish of 34th at Phoenix. He was replaced with J.J. Yeley, who would go on to qualify for 9 races in 14 attempts in the No. 46 entry, with a best finish of 19th at Daytona. He also ran 2 races in a second entry for Whitney Motorsports, the No. 81 Dodge. Yeley was replaced by Michael McDowell in the No. 46 entry at Atlanta, and the team would run both Chevrolets and Dodges for the remainder of the season. McDowell would qualify for 7 races in 12 attempts, with a best finish of 35th at Talladega. Sponsors that appeared during the 2010 season included Cash America, Red Line Oil, International Trucking, and Whitney Collision Center, among others. Overall, the No. 46 team made 19 races and finished five. For 2011, Whitney Motorsports remains a full-time team. It has been announced that Yeley would drive the No. 46 on a full-time basis. After the team failed to make the 2010 Daytona 500, Yeley raced his way into the 2011 event. The team didn't get far, as they blew an engine just 11 laps in and finished 43rd in the race. Yeley qualified for 15 events in the No. 46 car before moving over to Front Row Motorsports, with Bill Elliott driving at Talladega and Andy Pilgrim at Sonoma. Before New Hampshire, the team announced that they would switch manufacturers to Ford with previous Roush Fenway Racing driver Erik Darnell as the driver. Starting at Bristol Scott Speed took over the driving role replacing Erik Darnell and announced they had received sponsorship for Atlanta and Kansas. Speed finished the year with Whitney but left for Max Q Motorsports at year's end. Car No. 81 History Whitney Motorsports first ran the No. 81 at 3 events in 2010 as a Dodge. J.J. Yeley drove the car at Dover and at Martinsville, starting and parking at both events. Terry Labonte drove the car at Phoenix, also starting and parking. In 2011, the No. 81 qualified for its first race at Kansas. They ran the team for the remainder of the 2011 season in limited races, mainly as support for the 46 team. The No. 81 team ended operations while focused on getting the No. 46 in races. For 2012, Whitney merged with Phil Parsons Racing to field the No. 98 Ford for Michael McDowell.

Members of Agents for Change participate in policy development and provide lawmakers with expert advice as they move forward to modernize insurance regulation. An optional federal charter could revolutionize the way insurance agents and brokers across America conduct business. In the 111th Congress a bipartisan bill was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives to create an optional federal charter. Titled, the National Insurance Consumer Protection Act (H.R. 1880), the bill's sponsors are Representatives Melissa Bean (D-IL) and Ed Royce (R-CA). There are distinct advantages for agents and brokers within the framework of an optional federal charter. These include: (1) a single national license for agents that offer their services in more than one state; (2) speed to market of products would be greatly enhanced; (3) consumers would have additional products at more competitive rates from which to choose; and (4) the ability to better serve customers no matter where they may live (or move). Insurers would be able to bring their products to market more quickly because they would only have to obtain approval from a single regulatory body, rather than in multiple states as they do now under the patchwork quilt of state regulation. And consumers, who often move from state to state in today's economy, would benefit from more stable insurance premiums and consistent administration and regulation of their insurance policies. Consumer protection will be strengthened under a national insurance charter: No longer would consumers be subject to inconsistent regulatory oversight because of where they live. A national regulator would be focused on the issues of greatest importance to consumers including oversight of insurers' financial strength and their sales and claims handling practices. A new Division of Consumer Affairs would be established within the proposed Office of National Insurance (to be housed within the United States Department of the Treasury). The current patchwork of inconsistent state laws and regulations confuses consumers and results in insurance products that vary greatly among the states. These differences hinder consumers and add to the cost of insurance products. A national insurance charter will eliminate this regulatory inefficiency allowing insurers to offer additional products with enhanced customer service quite possibly at more competitive prices. History The McCarran‚ÄìFerguson Act, 15 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1011-1015, is a United States federal law that exempts the business of insurance from most federal regulation, including federal anti-trust laws to a limited extent. The McCarran‚ÄìFerguson Act was passed by Congress in 1945 after the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association that the federal government could regulate insurance companies under the authority of the Commerce Clause in the U.S. Constitution.

He was born at Wotton House, Buckinghamshire in 1715 into the influential Grenville political family and was one of five brothers who went into politics. He was the third son of Richard Grenville, a prominent Buckinghamshire politician and his brothers included Richard Grenville-Temple, 2nd Earl Temple, George Grenville, later the Prime Minister, and Thomas Grenville. He was educated at Eton College (1728-32) and studied law at the Inner Temple, where he was called to the bar in 1738. In 1738 he inherited Butleigh Court, Somerset from his aunt Catherine Riggs n√©e Symcox. He was first elected as a Member of Parliament in 1741 on the slate of Lord Cobham and served as one of Cobham's Cubs during his early years in parliament. In 1746 he was given a position at the Board of Trade.Lawson p.43-44 From 1756 to 1761, under Pitt, he was a junior Lord of the Treasury. Other positions included Lord of the Treasury (Nov. 1756-Apr. 1757 and July 1757-Mar. 1761), Cofferer of the Household (Mar.-Oct. 1761), Privy Counsellor, 1761 and Joint Vice-Treasurer of Ireland (Aug. 1766-Jan. 1770). In October 1761 following his brother-in-law William Pitt's resignation, James Grenville resigned along with him and went into opposition. He later oversaw the reconciliation between George Grenville, who had caused a rift with his family by not resigning, and their eldest brother Richard Grenville-Temple, 2nd Earl Temple a close ally of Pitt.Lawson p.216-217 He married Mary, the daughter and heiress of James Smyth of South Elkington, Lincolnshire and with her had 2 twin sons. He was succeeded in 1783 by his son James, who received most of his estate and was later created Baron Glastonbury, although some property also passed to the younger twin General Richard Grenville. Both sons served together as the MPs for Buckingham from 1774 to 1780. References Bibliography * Lawson, Philip. George Grenville: A Political Life. University of Manchester Press, 1984.

It is best known from a single individual, Publius Canidius Crassus, consul suffectus in 40 BC, and the chief general of Marcus Antonius during the Perusine War. Other Canidii are known from inscriptions. The name Canidia was also used by Horace as a sobriquet for the perfumer, Gratidia. Origin The nomen Canidius belongs to a common class of gentilicia formed from cognomina ending in '. It is derived from the cognomen Canidus, \\"whitish\\" or \\"greyish\\", itself derived from the Latin adjective canus or kanus, \\"white, grey\\", typically referring to the color of a person's hair, also sometimes used as a cognomen.Chase, pp. 121, 122. This was certainly the association that Horace intended; the name Gratidia suggests pleasant, winsome attributes, while the nickname Canidia suggests an elderly crone.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 594 (\\"Canidia\\"). Members * Publius Canidius, father of the consul Crassus. * Publius Canidius P. f.

Horace's Canidia The \\"Canidia\\" mentioned by Horace in his fifth and seventeenth epodes, and in the eighth satire in his first book of satires, and perhaps alluded to in the sixteenth ode of his first volume of Palinodia, was actually named \\"Gratidia\\"; the scholiasts describe her as a Neapolitan hetaira who had deserted the poet. Horace bestowed the ironic nickname upon her, and portrayed her as a sorceress, who used magic perfumes to enchant her lover, Varus.Ager, \\"Magic Perfumes and Deadly Herbs\\". Maxwell Paule cautions against reading Horace's description literally; his portrayal was that of the anti-muse, who torments rather than inspires the artist.Paule, Canidia, Rome's First Witch; review by Canevaro.

The Summanen crater  The 12th impact crater identified in Finland is located at the center of the lake. The crater is 2.6 kilometers wide, ~200 meters deep, and mostly buried under later sediments. The age of the crater is not known. It formed before the Quaternary glaciation, but on the other hand after the host rock which formed in the Svecofennian orogeny 1910 million years ago. (Plado et al. assume the impact was Phanerozoic, but give no evidence to support this.) The otherwise shallow lake (depth <10 m) has a 41 m central deep or trench at the crater site. The location is also occupied by a significant, circular electromagnetic anomaly (with more conductive materials at the site). The anomaly is supposedly the result of a 100 to 200 m thick subsurface lens, presumably formed of fractured rock with saline liquids. The impact origin was inferred from the anomaly and the deep, and proven by identifying shatter cones and planar deformation features in glacial erratics adjacent to the crater.

Christopher Crellius was the middle generation of three Socinian theologians: he was son of Johannes Crellius, and father of Samuel Crellius-Spinowski. Krzysztof Crell-Spinowski was educated first where he was born, at the Racovian Academy, then following the forced closure of the Racovian Academy in 1639, at the University of Leiden. After his return to Poland, from 1650 he was a preacher in Krzel√≥w, then 1654-1659 minister in RƒÖbkowa, then at Kluczbork in Silesia where his sons Christopher Jr. (1658) and Samuel (1660) were born, and his wife died (1666), and where from his second marriage a third son Pawe≈Ç (1677) was born. In 1669, Krzysztof Sr. moved as minister and teacher to Kosinowo. He completed the editing and printing of works of his father in Amsterdam. During his trips abroad to the Netherlands and England he sought material assistance for exiled Arians. He died on the way home from Kosinowo to Kluczbork. While his second and third sons followed their father's work as ministers in Lithuania, the firstborn, Christopher Crell Jr, accompanied his widowed father to England in 1668 at the age of 10 with his sister, and was left in the care of a spinster, Miss Alice Stuckey. Christoph Jr. later studied, like his father, at Leiden, where he graduated in medicine 6 July 1682, with a thesis on bladder stones.

High winds also affected central and northern New England. The nor'easter is estimated to have caused 42 fatalities. In Maine, over 1,000 travelers became stranded on roadways.Kocin and Uccellini, p. 660 Two ships cracked in two offshore New England during the storm. Development The development of this extratropical cyclone was associated with a pronounced weakening of the usual zonal, or west-to-east, flow which dominates the Mid-Latitudes during the winter, with the jet stream dipping from the latitude of Boston to the latitude of Charleston, South Carolina. The initial low-pressure area originated in the Gulf of Mexico, with a downstream redevelopment offshore Cape Hatteras on February 16. The cyclone deepened rapidly, 25 millibars in 24 hours between February 17 and February 18, while moving just offshore Long Island and southern New England, and dropped heavy precipitation across the central and northern Mid-Atlantic states. The snowfall associated with the storm across eastern New York and southern New England produced the heaviest snows of the winter. Impact Bow of the Pendleton There was significant disruption to shipping due to this storm. On February 18, 1952, while en route from New Orleans to Boston, the T2 tanker SS Pendleton' broke in two in a nor'easter south of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. A United States Coast Guard Consolidated PBY Catalina aircraft was diverted from searching for another T2 tanker to search for Pendleton, and located both sections. At this point, the Coast Guard realized that they were dealing with two ships that had broken in two. The Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat CG 36500 was dispatched from Chatham, Massachusetts. She had four crew on board as the rest of her crew had made themselves scarce on hearing that the CG-36500 was to be sent out to Pendletons aid. Nine of Pendletons 41 crew were lost, eight were on the bow section and the ship's cook from the stern section, who had selflessly assisted the rest of the crew off the vessel before him. He was lost when, as the ship started to slide off a sand bar (that she landed on) by the strong gale-force winds, he jumped from the Jacob's ladder, fell into the ocean, and was struck by the lifeboat as it was hit by a wave, killing him instantly. With the survivors on board, a row developed over how they should be dealt with. Bernard C. Webber, of the CG-36500 decided not to transfer them to and headed for the beach. The survivors were safely landed at Chatham. The rescue of the survivors of the shipwrecked Pendleton is considered one of the most daring rescues of the United States Coast Guard. All four crew of CG-36500 were awarded the Coast Guard's Gold Lifesaving Medal. At the time of her loss, Pendleton was insured for $1,690,000. The stern ultimately grounded off Monomoy Island, south of Chatham, and her forepart grounded on Pollock Rip Shoal, at coordinates , The bow section was sold in 1953 to North American Smelting Co. for recycling at Bordentown, New Jersey. However, it was stranded on June 4, 1953 in the Delaware River and dismantled there c.1978 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. In film The movie The Finest Hours (2016 film) was based on a shipping mishap that occurred during this cyclone.

History In 1890 Don Francisco Piria, founder of the resort of Piri√°polis, had bought a big stretch of land including the Cerro Pan de Az√∫car and stretching all the way to the beach. The hill was rich in granite and by his decision one of its slopes became a quarry which provided solid granite rocks for the construction of the seaside resort, and which gave work to more than 500 workers. In 1933 the famous sculptor Juan Zorrilla de San Mart√≠n together with father Engels Walters constructed a 35-metre cross on its top.

On 3 September, he co-signed a Committee circularsee, No√´l Parfait, \\"Notice biographique\\" in A.-F. Sergent, graveur en taille-douce, 1848, pp. 76-77. to justify the September massacres and considered a call to imitate the example of the \\"common good of Paris.\\" Later, he protested his innocence, saying that his name had replaced another.Philippe Buchez et Roux, Histoire parlementaire de la R√©volution fran√ßaise, volume XVII, pp. 432-433. On 30 Thermidor Year III (17 August 1795), he published a pamphlet entitled: \\"Deforgues to citizens (to defend themselves for having participated in massacres of September)\\", in which he claimed to have been attached to the administration of police on 14 September.See the text in Alexandre Sorel, Le Couvent des Carmes et le s√©minaire de Saint-Sulpice pendant la Terreur, Paris, Didier & Cie, 1864, pp. 364-370 However, according to Maurice Barthelemy, it was reported that at the worst moment, he imprisoned in the Abbaye citizen Claude Sujet who perished on the spot.Barth√©l√©my Maurice, Histoire des prisons, 1840. see Fr√©d√©ric Masson, Le D√©partement des affaires √©trang√®res pendant la r√©volution, 1787-1804, E. Plon et cie, 1877, 570 pages, p. 287. He was the first Secretary General of the Committee of Public Safety of The Mountain, dominated by Danton and Bar√®re then, at the request of Jean-Nicolas Pache, was appointed Deputy Minister of War Bouchotte, 5th Division, on 9 May 1793. Miot de Melito, who knew him, said he was \\"a firm and decided, with the spirit of the enlightenment. His aristocratic origin had approached Bar√®re.\\"Miot de M√©lito, M√©moires, 1858, volume I. \\" After 2 June he was appointed by the Convention at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Executive Council, replacing Lebrun-Tondu on 21 June 1793, on motion of Marie- Jean H√©rault de S√©chelles who introduced him as: \\"a true Republican, a well spoken sans-culotte\\", and explained: \\"Deforgues has a well-organized mind, he loves the book and has done a lot.\\" In fact, he thought only a little about the conduct of diplomatic business. In fact Bar√®re, who had the upper hand on the diplomacy of the Year II, tightly controlled the machinery. Thus, at the request of Bar√®re, he recruited agents of British counter intelligence, such as Richard Ferris, with missions to England and Ireland. His name appears not only in the English ministerial papers - particularly those of Lord Grenville - but also in the letter from the Foreign Office to Perr√©gaux asking 'Chemin- Deforgues' - (spelling adopted during the Revolution) - to promote disorder and \\"push the Jacobins in paroxysms of fury\\". With the endorsement of Bar√®re, he was paid by the British government, among others, to counter the business of United Irishmen and disrupted services by untimely hiring, as he employed Jean Baptiste No√´l Bouchotte at the Department of War. On 4 March 1794 Jacques H√©bert denounced him to the Cordeliers as follows: \\"A Deforgues who takes the place of Foreign Minister and well known that I call the Minister for Foreign Affairs!\\". On 13 Germinal Year II (2 April 1794) he was deposed and replaced by Martial Joseph Armand Herman. Arrested, he was imprisoned in Luxembourg for four months. On 14 Germinal, the warrant for his arrest was signed by du Barran, √âlie Lacoste, Vadier, Moyse Bayle, Robespierre, Prieur de la C√¥te-d'Or, Bar√®re - (his friend) - Saint-Just, Amar, Carnot and Collot d'Herbois; he wrote to the \\"Incorruptible\\", attributing his imprisonment as a result of his intimacy with Danton.Moncure Daniel Conway, Thomas Paine (1737-1809) et la r√©volution dans les deux mondes, Plon, 1900, p. 345.

His detention attributed to \\"Robespierre\\" exempted him from accounting for his deplorable administration. He \\"matures\\" somehow, and having to be diplomatic for his own interests, he was appointed in October 1799, at the Anglo-Russian invasion, Minister Plenipotentiary to the Batavian Republic, where he attended and succeeded Florent Guiot. He was recalled after 18 Brumaire, and replaced by Semonville. He lived in retirement when, in 1804, after the Louisiana Purchase in the United States, he was sent to New Orleans as trade commissioner. He spent five years in the country, where he married. On his return journey he was captured at sea by the English, but almost immediately released. Exiled to twenty leagues from Paris by Napoleon, he retired in August 1815 to Maincy, where he died.

It is one of the five grandes √©coles of the University of Burgundy and is located in Dijon, France. The professors (mostly researchers) have been involved in efforts to develop data processing, embedded systems, medicals, telecommunications networks, algorithms and optics. The engineering programs offered at ESIREM have also expanded beyond the physical sciences to include courses such as business management and project management. The school was previously known as FIRST and changed its name to ESIREM in 1998. Degrees offered ESIREM delivers dipl√¥mes d'ing√©nieurs (equivalent to Masters of Engineering or MEng in Anglophone countries) in two distinguished fields, Informatique/√âlectronique (computer science and electronics) and Mat√©riaux (material science). Each department has about 50-100 students and produces about 100 graduates a year. Its building is located between the sports faculty and the sciences faculty at the University of Burgundy. Both engineering degree programs are accredited by the Commission des titres d'ing√©nieur (CTI) and Minist√®re de l'enseignement sup√©rieur et de la recherche (Ministry of higher education and research). ESIREM is a member of the Conference de Grandes Ecoles de Bourgogne. Admission ESIREM has the standard admission process for Grandes √©coles, where students have to have completed the following series of preparatory coursework: Admission to first year (out of three years) * Cycle preparatoire (2 years) * the core course curriculum of the Groupe Archim√®de engineering schools (2 years) :These are Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, Engineering Science, and Modern Technologies * IUT scientifique (2 years) * Licence scientifique (2 years) Admission to second year (out of three years) * Masters M1, IUP, MST (3 years) Admissions are highly selective and based on exam results and personal interviews. Students also can sit for a national exam for Grandes √©coles. Tuition costs The average tuition is ‚Ç¨700 a year, with scholarships available. The fee includes lectures, lab studies, insurance and registration. See Education in France for further details. Academics Most lectures are conducted in French. Students are also required to pass the TOEIC English test with a minimum mark of 750/990. While most students are French, there are significant numbers of foreign students starting a program each year. Students are encouraged to intern in foreign countries. Mat√©riaux Mat√©riaux or material sciences was the main degree program at ESIREM when it was founded. It covers all aspects of material science, research and material engineering. Informatique/√âlectronique Informatique/√âlectronique (Computer engineering, telecommunication and electronic engineering) was founded in 2003 in response to the increasing demand for engineers in the industry worldwide. First-year students in this program are required to complete an extensive two- semester core curriculum that covers physics, mathematics and computer science. During the second year, students can choose to pursue their studies in embedded electronics architecture (Architectures Electroniques Embarqu√©es (A.E.E)) or network security, quality and architecture (S√©curit√© et Qualit√© des Architectures des R√©seaux (S.Q.A.R)). Students are trained to overcome stress and solve problems professionally during the second and third years, becoming skilled engineers in a number of areas. Contrat professionnalisation (for final year students only) Students who wish to work in the engineering industry can work under ESIREM's supervision at the company of their choice. Students must complete project-based activities during this period, rather than odd jobs. The contrat professionnalisation (or Contrat Pro) begins in October and lasts until the end of the school year. Internship Students are required to complete an internship each year. In the first year, the internship must last at least a month. In the second year, it is at least 10 weeks, and in the third year, at least five months. Many students intern abroad in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. Research and collaboration ESIREM has numerous collaborative partnerships with labs, foreign universities and companies. These collaborations have been gradually increasing. Activities BDE ESIREM is an active student council that manages various activities from the annual GALA to sports events.

The Erd√∂l-Erdgas-Museum Twist in Twist, Germany is a museum for crude oil and natural gas and shows technical equipment for mineral exploration of these natural energy resources and gives information about their geological origin.  History  In 1938 a gas rig found natural gas around the city of Bentheim. In early 1942 the rig LINGEN 2 found crude oil around the village of Dalum. These wells were the beginning of a long drilling history in the region. Later on the counties Emsland, Graftschaft Bentheim and the nearby Dutch province of Drenthe became one of the most important oil production areas for crude oil and natural gas in the whole of Europe. Because of this long historical connection between the region and the oil production the idea came up off founding a technical museum that shows how the oil production worked and still works. In 1999 the museum was established and is a part of the registered association Heimathaus Twist. In the beginning, the museum was located in the basement of the Heimathaus Twist building. The basement of the Heimathaus Twist was built as a bunker, therefore there was no way to get daylight into the museum and the illumination was not adequate for a public museum. In 2009, the museum moved into a new building directly beside the Heimathaus.  Exhibition space  The exhibition space is about 450 m2 spread over two floors and in addition the museum also has an open-air exhibition ground for showing bigger exhibits related to crude oil and natural gas industry. The museum has a small library as well as a presentation room for lectures and showing movies and presentations. The whole museum is disabled accessible. All information boards provide information in two languages, German and Dutch. Beside these information boards an audio tour is also available. A short one for about 40 minutes and a detailed one for about 2 hours. Also private guided tours are also available, but need to be booked in advanced. The museum is certified with the seal of approval as a family- friendly museum. It allows the kids to check out the toys while the parents explore the exhibition. In November 2011 the special exhibition \\"Aufgetaucht ‚Äì Erdgas aus Russland\\" (Emerged - Natural Gas from Russia) presented the original pipes of the Nord-Stream-Pipeline. After the end of this special exhibition these pipes became part of the permanent exhibition. The pipes were provided by Nord Stream, the operating company of this pipeline. The Nord- Stream-Pipeline was a 7.4 bn ‚Ç¨ pipeline project finished in 2011. This double line pipeline transports natural gas from Russian Vyborg via the Baltic Sea to the German Lubmin. These pipes are presented in the outside section of the museum directly on a lakeside. Two pipes are on the south shore of this lake and two further pipes are on the north shore. The lake symbolizes the Baltic Sea with the Russian part on the one side and the German part on the other side. This pipe weighs one metric ton per meter, in addition undersea pipelines are encased in an additional one metric ton of concrete per meter to be fixed/placed on the sea bed.

Plot Set in the fictional Montreaux School for Girls in Switzerland, the main focus of the film is Dr. Stephen Dominick, the school's popular director who is secretly admired by teacher Professor Anna Mathe and the 19-year-old French student Marie Claudel. At a state fair, the girls draw lots to see who gets to ask Dr. Dominick for a dance. Marie wins and nervously asks Dr. Dominick. Because he thinks it is inappropriate to dance with a student, he refuses, causing Marie to burst out in tears and run away. Thereby, she is late for the bus, returning to the boarding school. A week later, Professor Augusta Wimmer, a strict, unlikable woman, goes through the personal belongings of her students and finds a discarded love letter. Dr. Dominick and Professor Mathe are assigned to find out who wrote the letter, and conclude Marie is responsible due to the handwriting. Upon confronting her, she denies having written the letter, fearing Dr. Dominick will find out about her crush on him. Some of the uptight, old-fashioned teachers, including Professor Wimmer, suspect that while she was gone at the fair, she visited the supposed boyfriend the letter was addressed to. Because the strict rules at the school include not being allowed to date, Marie risks being suspended two days before graduation. In tears, Marie admits to Professor Mathe that she wrote the letter to Dr. Dominick. Anna doesn't tell Dr. Dominick this, but lets him know the girl is innocent. They both sympathise with her and try to prevent further punishment. But the other teachers persist with their persecution and insist that her mother is summoned. Desperate, Marie decides to run away, into a storm. Dr Dominick pursues her, and manages to catch up with her at some remote mountain hut. There, he fetches blankets for her and as he sits by her, she confesses her feelings for him. He admits to returning them. The next day, back at school, he proposes marriage and she accepts. Shortly afterwards Marie overhears a conversation in which Professor Mathe admits to being in love with Dr. Dominick and that she will leave the school because she is heartbroken. Trying to prevent this, Marie lies to Dr. Dominick by saying that she lied to him about being in love with him, claiming that she only told him she loved him so she would be able to graduate. Soon after graduation, Marie is about to be driven back home by her cousin Vallais from a nightclub where they were having a small celebration party, when she is suddenly visited by Dr. Dominick. He tells her he could never fall in love with Anna, after which they kiss.

The press praised her performance, with The Hollywood Reporter noting that \\"Hers is a performance unprecedented in Hollywood productions.

Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a mild mixed review, describing it as \\"dewy\\" and \\"undoubtedly sexy\\", and ultimately concluding that \\"its concentrated atmosphere of young innocence defeats its own purpose\\".

General equation  The Warburg diffusion element (ZW) is a constant phase element (CPE), with a constant phase of 45¬∞ (phase independent of frequency) and with a magnitude inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency by: :{Z_W} = \\\\frac{A_W}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\omega}}+\\\\frac{A_W}{j\\\\sqrt{\\\\omega}} :{|Z_W|} = \\\\sqrt{2}\\\\frac{A_W}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\omega}} where AW is the Warburg coefficient (or Warburg constant), j is the imaginary unit and œâ is the angular frequency. This equation assumes semi-infinite linear diffusion,http://www.consultrsr.net/resources/eis/diffusion.htm that is, unrestricted diffusion to a large planar electrode.  Finite-length Warburg element  If the thickness of the diffusion layer is known, the finite-length Warburg elementhttp://www.ecochemie.nl/download/Applicationnotes/Autolab_Application_Note_EIS03.pdf is defined as: :{Z_O} = \\\\frac{1}{Y_0} \\\\tanh(B \\\\sqrt{j\\\\omega}) where B=\\\\frac{\\\\delta}{\\\\sqrt{D}}, where \\\\delta is the thickness of the diffusion layer and D is the diffusion coefficient. There are two special conditions of finite-length Warburg elements: the Warburg Short (WS) for a transmissive boundary, and the Warburg Open (WO) for a reflective boundary.  Warburg Short (WS)  This element describes the impedance of a finite-length diffusion with transmissive boundary.http://www.abc.chemistry.bsu.by/vi/analyser/parameters.html It is described by the following equation: : Z_{W_S} = \\\\frac{A_W}{\\\\sqrt{j\\\\omega}} \\\\tanh (B \\\\sqrt{j\\\\omega})  Warburg Open (WO)  This element describes the impedance of a finite-length diffusion with reflective boundary.http://www.abc.chemistry.bsu.by/vi/analyser/parameters.html It is described by the following equation: : Z_{W_O} = \\\\frac{A_W}{\\\\sqrt{j\\\\omega}} \\\\coth (B \\\\sqrt{j\\\\omega}) References Category:Electrochemistry ","title":"Warburg element"},{"id":"26065921","text":"Foum Jamaa is a town in Azilal Province, B√©ni Mellal-Kh√©nifra, Morocco.

Snagov Palace (Romanian: Palatul Snagov) is a former royal palace on the shore of Lake Snagov, about 40 km north-east of Bucharest, in Ilfov County, Romania. The palace is situated in the commune of Snagov and near the Snagov monastery. Snagov Palace was built in the early 1930s by Henrieta Delavrancea-Gibory for prince Nicholas of Romania, brother of king Carol II.http://www.palatulsnagov.ro/ It was built on the grounds of the royal hunting lodge Scrovi»ôte, which dated from the 19th century. The new palace was constructed in the Romanian Br√¢ncovenesc style and completed in 1932. The palace has a formal garden with fountains, which was landscaped by the Austrian landscape architect Rebhun. In the garden there is a former guesthouse in Romanian Arts and Crafts-style, built in the beginning of the 20th century.http://royalromania.wordpress.com/2010/01/31/romanian-arts-and- crafts-house-within-royal-palace-grounds-scroviste/ Prince Nicholas hardly used the palace due to a conflict with the king about his morganatic marriage and his expulsion from Romania in 1937. After his departure the palace was meant to be used by politicians, artists and writers, but was hardly used. After 1940 it was occasionally used by the Romanian dictator Ion Antonescu as a summer residence. During the communist era (1945‚Äì1989), Snagov Palace was occasionally used as a residence by the General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. His successor Nicolae Ceau≈üescu rebuilt the palace in the 1980s after plans of professor Nicholas Vladescu, which took seven years, as a residence for himself and his wife Elena and for government meetings and state visits. During the early days of the Romanian Revolution of 1989 Ceau≈üescu and his wife and a small group fled on December 22 from the headquarters of the Communist Party (CC building) by helicopter to Snagov Palace, where they stayed for a brief moment. From his presidential suite Ceau≈üescu discussed by phone with several civilian and military authorities the confused situation in the country. Afterwards he departed from the palace by helicopter in the direction of Pite≈üti, where he and his wife eventually were captured and brought to T√¢rgovi≈üte.George Galloway and Bob Wylie, Downfall: The Ceau≈üescus and the Romanian Revolution, p. 168-169. Futura Publications, 1991 It is suspected that Ceau≈üescu took some valuables from the palace when he left for the last time. After the revolution the palace was not claimed by the royal family. Nowadays the palace is rented for various events, such as conferences, official banquets and wedding-parties.

At the time, separate approvals were required from several agencies before filming could begin. In 1966, permitting authority was consolidated within the New York City Department of Commerce. The city saw an immediate 100% increase in production over the previous year, bringing in an estimated additional $20 million in spending in the city.

It was taken over by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in the 1930s and passed to Courtaulds in 1964. Production finished in 1966. It was extended again in 1969 and used for other purposes. It has now been demolished, the street has been renamed and houses replace it. Location Royton is a town within the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, in Greater Manchester, England. It lies by the source of the River Irk, on undulating land at the foothills of the Pennines, north-northwest of Oldham, south-southeast of Rochdale and northeast of the city of Manchester. Royton is not situated on any canal, but the Manchester, Oldham, and Royton railway(which left the Oldham Loop Line at Royton Junction railway station) and a goods yard was constructed in the 1860s, allowing improved transportation of textile goods and raw materials to and from the township. History Historically a part of Lancashire, Royton during the Middle Ages, formed a small township centred on Royton Hall. A settlement expanded outwards from the hall which, by as late as 1780, \\"contained only a few straggling and mean-built cottages\\". Farming was the main industry of this rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system. Royton has the distinction of being the first town in Lancashire where a water powered cotton mill was built. Thorp Mill, Royton was built by Ralph Taylor at Thorp Clough in 1764. . The construction of more mills followed, which initiated a process of urbanisation and socioeconomic transformation in the region; the population moved away from farming, adopting employment in the factory system.. The introduction of which led to a tenfold increase of Royton's population in less than a century; from 260 in 1714 to 2,719 in 1810. Thus, the introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution facilitated a process of unplanned urbanisation in the area, and by the mid-19th century Royton had emerged as a mill town. Royton's damp climate provided the ideal conditions for cotton spinning to be carried out without the cotton drying and breaking. By 1832, there were 12 steam powered mills in Royton, of which its former hamlets had begun to agglomerate as a town around the cotton factories, a number of small coalpits and new turnpike road from Oldham to Rochdale, which passed through the town centre.. The Manchester, Oldham, and Royton railway and a goods yard was constructed in the 1860s, allowing improved transportation of textile goods and raw materials to and from the township. Neighbouring Oldham (which by the 1870s had emerged of the largest and most productive mill town in the world). had begun to encroach upon Royton's southern boundary, forming a continuous urban cotton- spinning district. The demand for cheap cotton goods from this area prompted the flotation of cotton spinning companies; the investment was followed by the construction of 22 new cotton mills in Royton.. Together with Oldham, at its peak the area was responsible for 13% of the world's cotton production. The industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914‚Äì18 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Royton Ring Mill, Royton was one of 104 mills bought by the LCC, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950. As imports of cheaper foreign yarns increased during the mid-20th century, Royton's textile sector declined gradually to a halt; cotton spinning reduced in the 1960s and 1970s, and by the early 1980s only four mills were operational. In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton was spun in the town in 1998. Today, fewer than a dozen mills are still standing in Royton, the majority of which are used for light engineering or as distribution centres.. Despite an economic depression brought about by the demise of cotton spinning, Royton's population has continued to grow as a result of intensive housing redevelopment which has modernised its former Edwardian districts. Architecture This was a P.S.Stott mill constructed in 1908. Power Driven by a 1700 hp cross compound engine by Urmson & Thompson, 1908 similar to the one in Mars Mill, Castleton. It was steamed at 160psi. The cylinders, 29\\"HP, 59\\"LP, had a 5-foot stroke. There were Corliss valves on both cylinders. The air pump was driven from LP tail rod with support guides on LP only.

It involved a combined total of 15,000 Afghan, American, British, Canadian, Danish, and Estonian troops, constituting the largest joint operation of the War in Afghanistan up to that point. The purpose of the operation was to remove the Taliban from Marja, thus eliminating the last Taliban stronghold in central Helmand Province. The main target of the offensive was the town of Marjah, which had been controlled for years by the Taliban as well as drug traffickers. Although Moshtarak was described as the largest operation in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban, it was originally supposed to be the prelude to a much larger offensive in Kandahar that would follow Moshtarak by several months. ISAF chose to heavily publicize the operation before it was launched, comparing its scope and size to the 2004 Second Battle of Fallujah, in the hopes that Taliban fighters in the town would flee. The operation was also designed to showcase improvements in both the Afghan government and Afghan security forces. ISAF claimed that the operation was \\"Afghan-led\\" and would use five Afghan brigades. General Stanley A. McChrystal, the commander of ISAF, also promised that following the offensive ISAF would install a \\"government in a box\\" in Marja. While initially successful, ISAF and the Afghans failed to set up a working government in the town, leading to a successful resurgence by the Taliban; 90 days into the offensive General McChrystal famously referred to it as a \\"bleeding ulcer\\". In October the town was still described as \\"troubling\\", but by early December the fighting there was declared \\"essentially over\\". Strategic meaning The operation was called \\"a key test\\" of the coalition strategy against the Taliban insurgency. Brigadier James Cowan, the commander of British forces in Helmand, believed it would mark \\"the start of the end of this insurgency\\". At the very least it would become a test of whether the Afghan forces would be able to make their country peaceful and safe. The announcement of the operation was also a part of this strategy: \\"shaping the information battlefield strategic communications\\", and to ensure it would not repeat the destruction of Fallujah in Iraq in 2004. Hours before the offensive began, Afghan and coalition forces dropped leaflets with the message, \\"Do not allow the Taliban to enter your home\\".Tim Reid (2010-02-13). \\"Troops start 'make or break' assault on the Taleban\\". The Times.\\"Central Helmand Residents Encouraged to Remain in Homes\\" After this operation in Helmand province, the neighbouring province and the city of Kandahar became a target of American operations. In March 2010, U.S. and NATO commanders released details of plans for the biggest offensive of the war against the Taliban insurgency. New war model When launched, the operation was called a \\"new war model\\". Afghan and NATO officials had assembled a large team of Afghan administrators and an Afghan governor that would move into Marja after the fighting, with more than 1,900 police standing by. \\"We've got a government in a box, ready to roll in\\", said American commander Stanley McChrystal. The capture of Marja was intended to serve as a prototype for a new type of military operation.\\"Afghan operation is new war model\\" The Afghan government had pledged to hold any territory seized in the Taliban heartland during the assault. Utilities engineers were on hand to ensure power and water supplies were maintained. Timeline of battle Background As early as September 2009, Canadian soldiers from 3 Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry began training about 400 Afghan National Army recruits for the operation. Since January 2010, coalition forces had launched smaller \\"shaping operations\\" to prepare for the main assault on February 13. One of these operations was a series of \\"find, fix, strike\\" raids by four-man SAS teams and U.S. Army Special Forces team ODA 1231. These resulted in the deaths of 50 Taliban leaders in the area according to NATO, but didn't seem to have any real adverse effect on the Taliban's operations. In another operation, the Scots Guards and Grenadier Guards captured a bomb factory and defused 20 IEDs. The Afghan public was warned of the upcoming operation, in line with new rules of engagement for British forces, called \\"courageous restraint.\\" The tactic, conceived by U.S. General Stanley McChrystal and British Major General Nick Carter, required soldiers to \\"use brain-power rather than fire-power\\" and hoped to reduce damage to the Afghan population (in terms of collateral and life cost) by using fewer munitions and support measures. 11 Light Brigade, the main British formation in Helmand for use in the counter-insurgency role tested the doctrine in some of the more heavily populated areas in Helmand. The publicity and the new tactics intended to prevent the loss of civilians, and to persuade insurgents to lay down their arms. The operation was the first in Helmand since the surge of 30,000 U.S. troops and additional British reinforcements in late 2009/early 2010. The main force was the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade (Task Force Leatherneck) as well as British Soldiers from 1 Coldstream Guards Battle Group, 1 Grenadier Guards Battle Group, 1 Royal Welsh Battle Group all supported by Close Support Combat Engineers from 28 Engineer Regiment; elements of the United States Army; and Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police forces. British Forces focused on the Lashkar Gah district and Nad Ali district, and U.S. forces on the town of Marja. U.S. assault forces included the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines and 1st Battalion, 6th Marines, 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines, 3rd Battalion, 10th Marines, 2nd Combat Engineer Battalion, and elements of 2nd Assault Amphibian Battalion and 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion The operation also intended to cut the opium trade. Its main aim was to ensure that captured ground can be held by British and American troops, enabling the Afghan government and civilian aid agencies and military contractors to work more effectively in the province. A majority of the US forces were inserted by CH-53 and MV-22 helicopters, while the rest conducted a ground assault. The Canadian Forces focused on the air assault with seven helicopters, including three CH-147 Chinook escorted by four CH-146 Griffon. The Joint Task Force Afghanistan (JTF-Afg) ferried about 1,100 coalition troops to Nad Ali District in the largest air assault ever conducted with Canadian helicopters. 33 other coalition helicopters, supported by fighter jets and uncrewed aerial vehicles, also participated in the operation with a total of 11 waves of troop drops. Ahead of the military operation, hundreds of civilian families fled Marja and its surroundings and were displaced from their homes due to the offensive by NATO and their Afghan partners.(02.08.10) \\"Afghanistan: Fleeing on foot at night\\". IRIN The town was suspected to be \\"one of the biggest, most dangerous minefields NATO forces have ever faced,\\" and hundreds of the beleaguered insurgents could insist to fight until death.\\"Marines Wait in the Cold for Afghan Offensive\\" Late December and Early January By early January the surge forces which President Obama had announced on December 1, 2009, had arrived in country. The bulk of the Marine forces included the 1st and 3rd Battalion of the 6th Marine Regiment. They quickly setup command at Camp Dwyer, south of Marjah. They were joined with Afghan Army units and began training and preparing for their mission in Marjah. At the same time a small task force, A SQN The Household Cavalry Regiment would begin to secure the main road from Lashkargah around local police compounds at the main t-junction, which divides the main road North to Nad-e-Ali and South to Marjah. With 3 Troop tasked to move on a dirt track in a 12 man team in Scimitar's and 2 pick up's with a Tiger Team SF team, to prove a potential cross country route towards Marjah and probe the Taliban in the Bolan Desert in the weeks leading up to the Moshtarak. Late January and Early February As the assault drew near, US and coalition forces began to encircle the city in order to screen those entering and exiting, gather intelligence, and deceive the enemy as to the avenue of approach for the well publicized assault. 1st Battalion, 6th Marines moved command to Fire Base Fiddlers Green, home of 3rd Battalion, 10th Marines just southeast of Marjah, the 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines built temporary Camp Belleau Wood just northwest of the city, and Bravo Company, 2nd Assault Amphibian Battalion and Alpha Company, 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion filled the desert to the west. At the same time a small task force, A SQN The Household Cavalry Regiment (HCR) would begin to secure the main road from Lashkargah around local police compounds at the main t-junction, which divides the main road North to Nad-e-Ali and South to Marjah. With 3 Troop tasked to move in a 12 man team in 4 Scimitar's and 2 pick up's with a Tiger Team SF team, to prove a potential off road route towards Marjah from the East and probe the Taliban in the Bolan Desert in the weeks leading up to the Moshtarak. In these weeks 3 Troop would encounter resistance each day and found dozens of IED's along the route. Sleeping next to the vehicles at night left allowed them to stay mobile but the Taliban were determined to no avail. At the same time 2 TP HCR (12 man team) would encounter a force of 35 Taliban moving South to Marjah, stopping them with help from Apache support. February 9, 2010 (D-4) In preparation for the major offensive, 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines seized the \\"Five Points\\" junction east of Marja on the road to Lashkar Gah. Elements of Charlie Company were inserted by air under cover of darkness, while elements of Bravo Company, along with 1/3's Combat Engineer Platoon, traveled 9 kilometers on foot from their bases in the Nawa district, sweeping the road for explosive devices. While repelling Taliban assaults, the Marines built a combat outpost, completed on February 14, that they named COP Reilly. The 1/3 Marines held COP Reilly and the northeastern outer sector of Marjah until February 25, when Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines arrived to take control of the position. February 11, 2010 (D-2) On February 11, forces staged all around the city and at the major airbases ready for the next day's assault. Hours before midnight the Afghan President Hamid Karzai had given his personal approval for the operation, that had been delayed for 24 hours as Afghan officials entered last minute negotiations with insurgents. February 12, 2010 (D-1) February 12 was the original D-day, but after a 24-hour delay to for negotiations, forces were on a standout and had one extra day for preparation. February 13, 2010 (D-Day) February 12, 2010, distribution of leaflets over Helmand Province by the U.S. military 1st Battalion, 6th Marines board CH-53E Super Stallion on February 13. Hours before dawn, US and Afghan special operations forces inserted into two key target sites in the southwest corner of Marjah. They would be isolated until Marines, Soldiers, and Afghani troops from Task Force 3/4/205 could link up. Just prior to dawn, the landing waves of helicopters across central Helmand marked the start of the major offensive. Third Battalion, 6th Marines were inserted into the northern part of the city and 1st Battalion, 6th Marines in the center of the city. In the southern edge, Task force 3/4/205 conducted a ground breach and companies of 1st Battalion, 6th Marines also conducted a ground breach from the southeast.Gal Perl Finkel, Back to the ground?, Israel Hayom, November 8, 2015. On February 13, two hours before dawn at 4 am local time the first of 90 Chinook and Cobra helicopters disgorged a force of British, Afghan and French troops. The US Special Forces ODA's 1231 and ODA 3121 had been on the ground for hours prior to the main push seizing control of their objectives. The Special Forces then advanced north into the city meeting heavy resistance and capturing further objectives. The advance into Marja was slowed during the morning through poppy fields lined with home-made explosives and other land mines.\\"Nato launches major Afghan assault\\" The first kills were reported to be made by uncrewed Predator aircraft and AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, targeting insurgents seen laying roadside bombs and setting up anti-aircraft guns. At 2 am local time the troops from the U.S. Marine Corps seized a series of canal crossings south of Nad-e-Ali. Within minutes, the U.S., British and Afghan special forces seized and secured dozens of helicopter landing sites. Most notably U.S. Army Special Forces ODA 1231 along with Afghan Commandos from 3rd Commando Kandak took control of the southern tip of the city, being the first boots on the ground. At 2:25 am Chinooks approached, flown by pilots with night vision equipment and guided by infra-red flares, dropped from U.S. Marine KC-130's. At about 4 am, RAF Chinooks full of soldiers from the 1st battalion the Royal Welsh left Camp Bastion, the main British base in Helmand, for the Pegasus landing zone in the Taliban stronghold of Showal in the Chah- e-Anjir area. At the same time the British Manoeuvre Support Group consisting of the Viking Gp, Close Support Armoured Engineers (including the first deployment of Trojan Armoured vehicles) and Route opening capabilities departed for the Op Moshtarak AO. While the British force began to secure their area, a 1,000-strong combined force of members of the U.S. Marine Corps and the Afghan National Army landed in Marja. During the following 90 minutes, more Marines arrived in waves of CH-53 Super Stallion transport helicopters. By daybreak, hundreds more soldiers began to enter the area by land, using mobile bridges and Assault Breacher Vehicles. Major General Nick Carter, commander of NATO Regional Command South in southern Afghanistan, said Afghan and coalition troops made a \\"successful insertion\\" without incurring any casualties. While the U.S. Marines and Afghan soldiers stormed the town of Marja, British, American and Canadian forces struck in the Nad Ali district. General Sher Mohammad Zazai, commander of the Afghan troops in the south, said Afghan and NATO forces had established positions in 11 of 13 targeted areas in and around Marja and were slowly pushing forward. When invading Marja, the invading troops confiscated caches of weapons and ammunition. The greatest obstacle was the extensive network of mines and booby traps. The assault troops were reported to run into \\"a huge number\\" of improvised explosive devices when crossing a canal into the town's northern entrance. Marines and Army used portable aluminium bridges to span the irrigation channels. Mobile bridges enabled the safe crossing of the main canal into Marja, since the existing bridge was expected to be rigged with explosives. Marine engineers moved forward in special mine-clearing Assault Breacher Vehicles. These 72-ton, 40-foot (12-meter)-long vehicles, fitted with a 15-foot (4.5-meter)-wide plow supported by metallic skis that glide on the dirt, and nearly 7,000 pounds (3,175 kilograms) of explosives, ploughed a path through fields and dug a safety lane through the numerous minefields laid by the Taliban. To clear minefields and ignite roadside bombs, the Marines also launched rockets which deploy cables of plastic explosives, called M58 MICLIC. On the first day of the operation, Qari Yousef Ahmadi, a spokesman of the Taliban, said that insurgents were still resisting in Marja in hit-and-run tactics against ISAF forces. Mullah Mohammed had told ABC News that the Taliban were retreating to reduce civilian casualties. By nightfall, it was claimed by ISAF sources that Marines \\"appeared to be in control\\" of the centre of Marja. British forces moving into the Nadi Ali and western Babaji regions encountered small 'stay-behind' pockets of resistance, although most Taliban fighters had already retreated to other areas in Helmand. Number One Company of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards advanced several kilometers into the region on foot from Patrol Base 4 in Babaji. The guardsmen manpacked FGM-148 Javelin missiles which were used decisively to defeat the Taliban resistance left in the area. Gulab Mangal, the governor of Helmand, said it was \\"the most successful operation we have ever carried out\\", but warned that the complete military operation could take a month. However, General McChrystal later called the offensive in Marja a \\"bleeding ulcer\\" after 90 days into the offensive. February 14, 2010 (D+1) Marines and Afghan National Army soldiers take cover in Marja on February 13. On the morning of February 14, 2010, a report of the Australian newspaper Herald Sun under the headline \\"Opium city captured\\" claimed the seizure of Marjah, \\"source of most of the world's opium\\", by the Afghan and ISAF forces. However, Reuters reported that a small flag-raising ceremony at one of the Afghan and ISAF compounds on the morning of February 14 drew gunfire, suggesting that the insurgents remained defiant. After American, Afghan and British troops seized crucial positions, having first overwhelmed most immediate resistance, they encountered \\"intense but sporadic\\" fighting as they began house-to-house searches. The pattern suggested that the hardest fighting was still to come. According to American commanders the troops had achieved every first-day objective, including advancing into the city itself and seizing strategic points like intersections, government buildings and one of the city's bazaars in the center. The following searching door to door for weapons and insurgents is expected to last at least five days, with possibly hundreds of bombs and booby-traps in houses and on roads and footpaths as the biggest concern. On this second day of the operation British troops pushed through Showal, the town that for the last two years was under the control of insurgents who used it as a staging post to build bombs and to train their fighters to plant them. In factory raids explosives for numerous improvised explosive devices were seized. Not only bomb-making equipment, but also drugs and heroin-processing chemicals were found in surrounding field belonging to Opium farmers. Among the drugs seized were 17 tons of black tar opium, 74 tons of opium poppy seeds, 400 pounds of hashish and 443 pounds of heroin. Twelve civilians, 10 of whom were from the same family, were killed when civilian houses in Marja were struck by two rockets fired by a NATO High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). All use of the rocket system was stopped by NATO commanders, the American general McChrystal telephoned Afghan President Hamid Karzai to apologize for what he called the \\"unfortunate incident\\" and the latter called for an investigation.\\"The mistaken killing of 12 Afghan civilians prompts U.S. apology\\" Major General Nick Carter stated however that the rockets were on target and the house was used by the Taliban for staging attacks. February 15, 2010 (D+2) On the morning of the third day of the operation, the American general Stanley McChrystal visited the former \\"insurgent capital\\" of Showal, where after two years the white flag of the Taliban was replaced with the red, green and black national flag. While the British sector of northern Nad-e-Ali had fallen easily, the American troops were still pushing through Marja a few miles away where the insurgents are putting up a \\"final stand\\".Cpl Ducote and Lcpl Cooper 3rd Bn 6th Mar India Company According to American and Afghan commanders, the number of insurgents in the area had dropped by about half. About a quarter of the 400 Taliban fighters estimated to be in Marja at the beginning of the operation had been killed. Another quarter appeared to have retreated to other areas or have fled the area, including some of the commanders. In Marja itself fighting continued in two areas, at the northern end of the district and at the center. February 16, 2010 (D+3) After the town of Showal was captured following the launch of Operation Moshtarak, a threat was perceived by the ISAF forces of suicide or other bombing attacks by insurgents, attempting to reassert their presence in defiance of the media focus on the town's recapture. February 18, 2010 (D+5) On February 18, 2010, Afghan soldiers raised the Afghan national flag over the badly damaged bazaar in Marja which had been the target of ISAF and Afghan army attacks, after driving back Taliban snipers on their third attempt, witnessed by the top Afghan general in Helmand and the provincial governor. The same day, there were reports about a meeting of Afghan government officials with Taliban representatives in the Maldives that had taken place at the end of January.\\"Afghan troops raise flag in key town but Marjah battle not over yet ‚Äì Reports of talks between Karzai officials and Taliban militants in the Maldives\\" U.S. Marines with Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment return fire on enemy forces in Marja. In the south of the city near the Balakino Bazaar, where soldiers and Marines from Task Force 3/4/205 had been clearing since D-day, a major fight broke out as they struggled to clear the last major intersection. Members of Army Special Forces ODA 3121 along with Marine engineers and partnered Afghan commandos began to fight their way west from the Balakino Bazaar (Objective Thunderdome, what would be called COP McQueary and later COP Azadi) to the last major Taliban Intersection (Objective Olympia). At the same time, Marines from 3rd Platoon, Bravo Company, 2nd AABn (aka MRAP Company) pushed north towards Olympia from COP Radford at the southern entrance of the city. Encountering heavy rocket- propelled grenade, small arms, and indirect fire the forces moved into the intersection which consisted of a small bazaar and International Red Cross clinic, surrounded by several canals and guarded by fighting bunkers. Once the intersection was secured, the engineers began clearing the areas of IEDs. When clearing the bazaar, opening a booby-trapped door triggered an explosion, killing Lance Corporal Larry Johnson and Sergeant Jeremy McQueary, both of 2nd Combat Engineer Battalion, and wounded five other Marines. MRAP Company occupied the intersection and eventually developed COP Olympia. For his actions leading the assault to COP Olympia, Army Staff Sergeant Corey Calkins was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Cross (Navy Cross equivalent), which is the second-highest medal awarded in Marjah. Following the explosion of the booby-trapped door the Marines and other nearby US forces inspected nearby homes, and apprehended an individual from a home they thought contained material that could be used to construct a bomb. A cooperative local elder identified the prisoner as a member of the Taliban. In 2015 Mathew Golsteyn was discharged from the Army, and had a letter of reprimand left in his personnel file, over the death of this prisoner. During a 2016 interview, on FOX News Golsteyn provided a description of the prisoner's death that led to murder charges, in December 2018. February 25, 2010 (D+12) A Marine with Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment return fire on enemy forces in Marjah using an M72 LAW. After 12 days, on the morning of February 25, 2010, there was another flag rising ceremony. The Australian newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald reported that an AFP photographer mentioned the rising of the Afghan flag on a building at the Marja bazaar by Mohammad Gulab Mangal, governor of Helmand province, watched by Brigadier General Larry Nicholson, the commander of the US Marines in southern Afghanistan. This ceremony was attended by a crowd of several hundred inhabitants of the 125,000 inhabitants of the town and was guarded by US Marine snipers positioned on the roofs of buildings. Nicholson and Mangal, accompanied by Major General Nick Carter, the British commander of NATO forces in southern Afghanistan, arrived in Marja early that day by helicopter from Camp Bastion. March 16, 2010 On March March 16, 2010, an assessment by the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) claimed that the conflict in Marja had left 35 civilians dead, 37 injured, and 55 houses destroyed ‚Äì without specifying which side killed how many civilians. Except for some \\"small pockets of resistance\\", Taliban fighters had been driven out of the town, but many inhabitants were struggling to return to some kind of normality. Before and during the military operation they were promised rapid aid, but some three weeks after the end of the offensive local people said that they had yet to receive any meaningful assistance.IRIN Press release \\"Afghanistan: Marjah residents take stock after offensive\\" March 20, 2010 Marines from Bravo Company, 2nd Assault Amphibian Battalion return fire on the Taliban during Operation Moshtarak. According to reports, sniper fire and bomb explosions in Marja three or four times daily were a sign that the insurgents had not given up despite losing control of the town. New bombs were planted every night, even though Marines said they could dismantle most of them. Lt. Col. Calvert Worth, commander of the 1st Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment, said that his troops found or hit more than 120 homemade bombs in their first 30 days in Marja. Marine Officers Lieutenant Brian Irizarry and Captain Stalnaker at Camp Dwyer, Helmand at the conclusion of Operation Moshtarak June 2010 Four months after the start of the operation, a lack of security for local population cooperating with ISAF troops and the eruption of gun battles \\"almost daily\\" have been reported. Four months after the offensive the former Taliban stronghold, that was intended to become a showpiece of what Western military might and ramped-up Afghan government services could accomplish, became something of a cautionary tale. Insurgents undermined a return to normal life, intimidating bakers who supplied American troops. December 7, 2010 Operation Moshtarak was declared officially over and the city secured, however Coalition troops would continue to fight in Marjah until 2013. Coalition and Taliban casualties As of February 18, Coalition forces have not released, or given any more statements about estimates of Taliban casualties during this operation. In the first five days of fighting an anonymous US intelligence source estimated at least 120 Taliban fighters were killed engaging Coalition and Afghan forces in Marja during the operation. By early December, 61 US, UK and Afghan soldiers were reported killed in the district as part of the operation. However, the Afghan national army almost never gave out their fatality figures so the number of Coalition dead could be higher. The numbers of Coalition and Taliban wounded in action have not been released or publicly estimated thus far. Poppy dilemma poppy fields in Marja. After the ousting of the Taliban, the American and NATO commanders were confronted with the dilemma of on the one hand the need for \\"winning the hearts and minds\\" of the local population as well as on the other hand the necessity of the eradication of poppies and the destruction of the opium economy, that allegedly financed the Taliban insurgency.Gretchen Peters \\"Seeds of Terror: How Heroin is Bankrolling the Taliban and Al Qaeda\\", publ. Thomas Dunne Books (2009) Since opium is the main source of existence of 60 to 70 percent of the farmers in Marja, American Marines were ordered to preliminarily ignore the crops to avoid trampling their livelihood.

This system of computations is widely popular in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. According to legends, Haridatta promulgated the Parahita system on the occasion of the Mamankam held in the year 683 CE.K. V. Sarma (1997), \\"Haridatta\\", Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures, edited by Helaine Selin, Springer, . Mamankam was a 12-yearly festival held in Thirunnavaya on the banks of the Bharathapuzha river. The distinctive contribution of Harfidatta, apart from his resolving the Aryabhatiya calculations and using the Katapayadi system of numerals is the corrections he introduced to the values of the mean and true positions, the velocity, etc., of the moon and other planets as obtained from Aryabhata's constants. This correction is called the Sakabda-samskara since it applied from the date of Aryabhata in the Saka era 444, at which date his constants gave accurate results. Parahita system The Parahita system of computations introduced by Haridatta was a simplification of the system propounded in Aryabhatiya by Aryabhata. Haridatta introduced the following simplifications. The system was called Parahita meaning suitable for the common man because it simplified astronomical computations and made it accessible for practice even for ordinary persons. *Haridatta dispensed with the numerical symbolism used by Aryabhata and replaced it with the more flexible Katapayadi system. In this system, letters are used to represent digits and these letters are then used to invent meaningful words and sentences to denote specific numbers. These words and sentences could be remembered with much less effort. *Computations in Indian astronomy involved long numbers representing various parameters associated with the several celestial objects which are applicable for a Mahayuga, a period of 4,320,000 years. To avoid computations with these large numbers, Haridatta introduced a smaller Yuga, called a Dhijagannupura-yuga, of 576 years or 210,389 days (which 1/7500 th part of a Mahyuga) and accurately determined the zero corrections for this sub-Yuga for the mean motion of the several planets. These corrections were then used to compute the mean planets for any given date. Works of Haridatta Scholars have been able to identify only two works as authored by Haridatta. One of them, titled Grahacaranibandhana, is the basic manual of computations of the Parahita system of astronomy. This was unearthed by K.V. Sarma and was published in 1954. The other work titled Mahamarganibandhana is no longer extant.

The Clan encompass families in the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth, Upper Hungary (now Slovakia), Hungary, Transylvania, Belarus, Ukraine, and Prussia. The Clan crest is the Ostoja coat of arms,Prof. J√≥zef Szyma≈Ñski, Herbarz rycerstwa polskiego z XVI wieku, Warszawa 2001, Klejnoty by D≈Çugosz, Armorial Gelre, Armorial Lyncenich, Codex Bergshammar, Armorial de Bellenville, Chronicle of Council of Constance, Toison d‚ÄôOr and the battle cry is Ostoja (\\"Mainstay\\") or Hostoja (\\"Prevail\\"). The Clan adopted the Royal-Sarmatian tamga draco (dragon) emblem. During the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Clan adopted several Lithuanian and Belarusian families, generally of Ruthenian princely origin, and transformed into a Clan of landlords, senators and nobility.Franciszek Ksawery Piekosinski, Heraldyka polska wiek√≥w ≈õrednich (Polish Heraldry of the Middle Ages), Krak√≥w, 1899 Members of the Clan worked together closely, often living close to each other. They held high positions, and held a great amount of land and properties in both Commonwealth and in Upper Hungary (today mostly present-day Slovakia) in medieval times, including many great gothic style castles.Kaspar Niesiecki, Herbarz Polski, print Jan Bobrowicz, Leipzig 1839-1846 Members of the Clan of Ostoja ruled several feudal lordships in Upper Hungary between 1390 and 1434 and Transylvania in 1395-1401 and again in 1410‚Äì1414, during the time of Duke Stibor of Stiboricz.L√°szl√≥: A magyar √°llam f≈ëm√©lt√≥s√°gai Szent Istv√°nt√≥l napjainkig - √âletrajzi Lexikon (The High Officers of the Hungarian State from Saint Stephen to the Present Days - A Biographical Encyclopedia); Magyar K√∂nyvklub, 2000, Budapest; Bran Castle Museum official site, section about Dracula[1]Dvo≈ô√°kov√°, Daniela, Rytier a jeho kr√°ƒæ.

Stibor of Stiboricz and his son, Stibor of Beckov were both members of the Order of the Dragon.Magyar Arisztokracia- http://ferenczygen.tripod.com/ At the same time in Poland between 1390 and 1460, several members of the Clan of Ostoja ruled Voivodeships and cities as castellans, voivods and senators on behalf of the King and the Clan was therefore in control of Pomerania, Kuyavia, and partly Greater Poland, which were a considerable part of the Kingdom of Poland at that time. The Clan was involved in every war Poland participated in, and during the partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth they can be seen in every movement and uprising, fighting against foreign forces. The clan put high value on education and were, in general, good administrators of their properties as well as the properties of the King (starostwo). They were also inventors, poets, scientists, and great diplomats.  Background   Polish clans and surnames  Polish clans, while having members related by male-line genealogy, also had many genealogically unrelated families, either because of families' formal adoption into various clans, or because of misattributions petrified in heraldic literature. The genealogically unrelated families were brought together in the Polish heraldic tradition through use of the same coat of arms and the same clan (coat-of-arms) appellation (name). In contrast to other European countries, medieval Polish clans were unusually powerful compared to the Polish monarch. Though each clan was found in a certain territory, each clan also had family members in many other areas of Poland as they moved during medieval times also to settle down on the property(pl:posag) of their wife's or because they were assigned to settle down and serve the Crown, holding office and in some cases, were granted land in the area. Clan members supported each other in court sessions and in the battles, sharing same battle cry and later sharing same coat of arms. The powerful member was usually also the head of the clan, helping and caring for other clan members, calling for them when need for battle.K. Tymieniecki, Procesy tw√≥rcze formowania siƒô spo≈Çecze≈Ñstwa polskiego w wiekach ≈õrednich (The Evolution of Polish Society in the Middle Ages), Warszawa, 1921. Polish family names were appended with ‚Äìcki or ‚Äìski in reference to the name of their properties; for example, if a person named Chelmski acquired the town of Poniec, he would change his surname to Poniecki.http://www.poniec.pl ‚Äì ‚ÄúJak Chelmscy stali sie Ponieckimi‚Äù Furthermore, Jerzykowski (de Jerzykowo) that owned property of Baranowo changed his surname to Baranowski (de Baranowo) and Baranowski that owned property of Chrzastowo change the surname to Chrzastowski (de Chrzastowo). The medieval Ostoja Clan seems to have been situated in more than 163 original nests and divergent locations, reflected in various surnames.IH PANhttp://www.slownik.ihpan.edu.pl/search.php?id=3775 A clan became partly a name for the family members with different surnames. Clan members could help both military and in the court, supporting each other in many different way.Ignacy Krasicki - Satyry (Dziela, r.1802-1804), Ksiazka i Wiedza, Warszawa 1988  Chronology   Legendary origin  According to one legend,Piotr Nalecz-Malachowski, Zbior nazwisk szlachty, Lublin 1805, reprint Biblioteka narodowa w Warszawie 1985, (nr. sygn.

However, there may be another, older origin: Ostoja family members often used the name of Stibor (Scibor, Czcibor), on the basis of a family origin from Czcibor, victorious in the Battle of Cedynia brother of Mieszko I of PolandK.

It has two \\"moons\\" and a cross, and the crest of the Piast dynasty was very similar, lacking the \\"moon\\" on top. Another legend tells however that the Ostoja coat of arms origin from another brave Knight, Jan z Jani of Ostoja, first Polish voivode/duke of Pomerania and Gda≈Ñsk. Chased by a group Teutonic Knights, he had succeeded in crossing a river on horse despite being clad in full armor, and then raised his voice so the Lord would hear him and said \\"Ostalem\\" which means \\"I still stay\\" from which comes the name of Ostoja.Legend about Jan z Jani - http://www.gniew.pl/index.php?strona=98&breakup;=14 However, this legend is undermined by the term \\"Ostoja\\" being known far before the time of Jan z Jani. Origin Draconarius The Ostoja coat of arms evolved from Sarmatian tamga emblems.Helmut Nickel, Tamga and Runes, Magic Numbers and Magic Symbols, The Metropolitan Art Museum 1973 The dragon in the Ostoja coat of arms relates to the Sarmatian dragon that had been used by Royal Sarmatians who, according to Strabo and Ptolemy, had lived in the area between Bessarabia and the lower Danube Valley and were descendants of the Royal Scythians.Richard Brzezinski and Mariusz Mielczarek, The Sarmatians 600 BC-AD 450 (Men-At-Arms nr. 373), Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 2002. This dragon was adopted by Roman legions and was used by Sarmatian cataphracts (armored heavy cavalry). The term draconarius was applied to the soldier who carried the draco standard.Helmut Nickel, The Dawn of Chivalry, Metropolitan Museum of ArtHelmut Nickel, Tamga and Runes, Magic Numbers and Magic Symbols, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1973.  Early history  Seal of Dobies≈Çaw z Koszyc of Ostoja, 1381 The earliest historical records that mention the Clan use the name Stibor, which derives from Czcibor (Scibor, Czcibor, Cibor, Czesbor, Cidebur)Karol Olejnik: Cedynia, Niemcza, G≈Çog√≥w, Krzyszk√≥w. Krak√≥w: Krajowa Agencja Wydawnicza, 1988. . which comes from czcic (to honor) and borzyc (battle), thus denoting a person who ‚ÄúBattles for Honor‚Äù or who is the ‚ÄúDefender of Honor‚Äù. An early Clan location is a village Sciborzyce, located in Lesser Poland that before 1252 was a property of Mikolaj of Ostoja. There are also notes about villages of Sciborowice and Stiborio (or Sthibor) around the same area in 1176 and 1178. Mikolaj of Ostoja ended building of the Roman church in Wysocice; on the walls of the church he cut an early sign of the Stibor family before it became a coat of arms that is called Ostoja. This sign is identical with the first known seal of Ostoja dated to 1381. Mikolaj's sons, Strachota and Stibor Sciborzyce to the church of Wysocice in 1252 and moved from Lesser Poland. Strachota moved to Mazovia and Stibor to Kujawy where in 1311 a note was found about a village called Sciborze, which become the nest of the kujawian line of Stibors that later become famous in Slovakia and Hungary.http://www.artteka.pl/www/terra/pl/wysocice/wysocice.html the Roman church in Wysocice By 1025, when Mieszko II Lambert was crowned, the Kingdom of Poland had borders that resemble modern-day Poland. Many landlords (comes, comites) were against centralized power in the kingdom. Rivalry arose between the Lords of Greater Poland, whose capital was Pozna≈Ñ, and those of Lesser Poland, whose main city was Krak√≥w.Norman Davies, Bo≈ºe igrzysko, t. I, Wydawnictwo ZNAK, Krak√≥w 1987, , p. 128Zygmunt Boras, KsiƒÖ≈ºƒôta piastowscy Wielkopolski, Wydawnictwo Pozna≈Ñskie, Pozna≈Ñ 1983, The Stibors are thought to have been a mainstay of the Piast dynasty, Poland's first ruling dynasty. The Piasts were able to expand Poland during the 10th and the beginning of the 11th century. Clan members were appointed commanding officers of the army units that protected and administered these new counties. The expansion of Poland and of Clan properties seem to have gone hand in hand; for example, when Kuyavia and Greater Poland (Wielkopolska) were incorporated, the Clan expanded into the same area. Records refer to Stibor as Comes of Poniec in 1099, and also refer to another Stibor as Comes of Jebleczna.Bartosz Parpocki, Herby Rycerstwa Polskiego, Krakow 1584, Kazimierz Jozef Turowski edition, Krakow 1858, Nakladem Wydawnictwa Bibliteki Polskiej However, Poniec property belonged to the Crown in 11-12th century and information about Stibor of Poniec year 1099 seems not correct.

OCLC 7730959 the Clan consisted of people related by blood and descending from a common ancestor in early medieval time. Before the time of Mieszko I of Poland that united different tribes, the tribes were ruled by the Clan. During the time of Boles≈Çaw I Chrobry (967 ‚Äì 17 June 1025) and Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth clans included free mercenaries from different part of Europe but especially from Normandy to defend their properties and country. The original nests of the Ostoja family were situated in Lesser Poland and the Clan expanded north to Kujawy and Pomerania during the formation of the Polish state. It is possible that part of the families in the Clan of Ostoja also originated from free mercenaries, but most, Ostoja families originated from Royal Sarmatians, the Draconarius. Before 1226 the Ostoja Battle Cry transformed to a coat of arms when the concept of heraldry came into prominent use in Poland. Knights began to have their shields and other equipment decorated with marks of identification. These marks and colors evolved into a way to identify the bearer as a member of a certain family or Clan. The dragon in Ostoja has been used and identified by the majority of Ostoja families since the 2nd century.

Tymieniecki, Procesy tworcze formowania sie spoleczenstwa polskiego w wiekach srednich, Warszawa 1921 The last King of Poland from the Piast dynasty was the son of Wladyslaw I, Casimir III the Great, who died in 1370. The Clan of Ostoja continued, during that time, to expand their land and was granted several high offices. Krak√≥w replaced Pozna≈Ñ, the capital of Greater Poland, as the capital of Poland in 1039. The Clan expanded their land possessions mostly in the voivodeship of Krak√≥w, Czƒôstochowa and Sandomierz in the Lesser Poland region of Poland. Documents Kaspar Niesiecki, Herbarz Polski, print Jan Bobrowicz, Leipzig 1839-1846 tells about: * Mikolaj of Ostoja - owner of village Sciborzyce, ended building of Roman church in Wysocice in 1232. His sign cut into the walls of the church is the oldest known sign of the family of Stibors of Ostoja that also became the Coat of Arms of the Clan of Ostoja. * Piotr of Ostoja was Lord of the regality (starosta) of Sandomierz in 1259, and Miroslaw of Ostoja was Castellan of Sandomierz in 1270. * Jan from Bobin was Treasurer and Chamberlain of Krakow in 1270 and Mikolaj of Ostoja was Chamberlain of Krakow in 1286. * Comes Marcin of Ostoja in 1304 and in the family property of Chelm and Wola just outside Krakow city, furthermore there are notes about Comes Dobieslaw, Comes Sanzimir and Comes Imram, who were all great Lords belonging to the Ostoja family. * Mikolaj of Ostoja hold high office as Standard-bearer of Inowroc≈Çaw 1311 and of Wyszogr√≥d 1315, Jƒôdrzej of Ostoja was Castellan of Pozna≈Ñ 1343. * Moscic Stiboricz of Ostoja was Duke of Gniewkowo in 1353 and Lord of regality Starosta of Brzesko County 1368. He was from the line of Ostoja family that later became famous in Slovakia and Hungary, owner of family nest ≈öciborze in Kujawy and also father to future great Lord Stibor of Stiboricz. * In 1257 the Clan of Ostoja founded the Roman church of St. Martin in Krakow together with the Gryf Clan family (see Gryf coat of arms). Mongol and Tatar states in Europe were common at that time. In 1259, Poland faced a second Tatar raid that was supported by Russian and Lithuanian forces. The defense of the town and castle of Sandomierz was in the command by Lord castellan Piotr of Krepy from Ostoja. As the defense did not receive help from outside, the situation was hopeless for the defending side and finally Piotr and his brother Zbigniew were killed. The legend says that their blood then run down to the Vistula river and turned it red. A legend of the third Tatar raid tells how Lady Halina of Krepy, daughter of Lord Piotr of Sandomierz CastleMinakowski (Boniecki), used a secret tunnel from the castle and duped the Tatars by telling them that she could lead them back through the secret tunnel right to the heart of the Castle.Andrzej Sarwa, Opowie≈õƒá o Halinie, c√≥rce Piotra z Krƒôpy, Armoryka edition The Tatar side verified that she had come through the secret tunnel, but she guided them deep inside the tunnel which was an extensive maze, and then released a white pigeon that she had with her to use as a prearranged signal.

Jagiello As Poland was under pressure from the west from the rising power of the Teutonic Knights, Poland turned east to ally with Lithuania. In 1386 Ladislaus II Jogaila (Wladyslaw II Jagiello) was crowned as King of Poland and his brother Vytautas (Witold) become Grand Duke of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1410 Poland and Lithuania broke Teutonic domination in Prussia at the Battle of Grunwald and Tannenberg. The Union of Horodlo of 1413 declared the intent that the two nations cooperate. 47 Lithuanian families were adopted into 47 Polish clans, sharing the same coat of arms. This expansion eventually led to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which was for a time the biggest confederated country in Europe. The Clan of Ostoja did not participate in the Union of Horodlo.Norman Davies. God's Playground. A History of Poland.

Some families were adopted into the clan in 1450.W. Semkowicz, O litewskich rodach bojarskich zbratanych ze szlachta polska w Horodle w 1413r., Miesiecznik Heraldyczny t.

In this work, he described Ostojas as brave and talkative.Jan D≈Çugosz, Annales seu cronici incliti regni Poloniae, Annals of Jan D≈Çugosz (English translation of key sections of the work, ) Between 1400 and 1450, many Ostojas attended the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, where Clan solidarity was very important.J.

This together with high education and loyalty towards the Clan members made it possible to raise in power.  Poland  The list of offices that members of the Ostoja family held in the late medieval era shows the power the Ostojas held, ruling a considerable part of Poland on the behalf of the King. From the original nests and properties, members of the Clan of Ostoja created names of different branches of the Clan. All those properties and nests can be found within borders of Poland of today. The expansion of the Clan went both east, south and north, in the beginning of the 15th century Ostoja families also owned land in Pomerania, Prussia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Moravia, Croatia, Transylvania, Upper Hungary and Germany. However, the biggest land area that the Clan owned was to be found in Upper Hungary (today mostly present-day Slovakia).Sroka, Stanislaw A. : Scibor ze Sciborzyc. Rys biograficzny.

As Jan z Jani lead Prussian confederation together with Miko≈Çaj Szarlejski followed by excellent diplomatic work of Stibor de Poniec, the Clan was ruling in Pomerania, Kujavia and partly Greater Poland. Adding the power entrusted by the King to Piotr Chelmski, Jan Chelmski, Piotr of Gaj or Miko≈Çaj B≈Çociszewski, the Clan of Ostoja was among those that hold prime position in Poland at the time.Jan Dlugosz, Annales seu cronici incliti regni Poloniae, Annals of Jan Dlugosz (English translation of key sections of the work, )Antoni Eckstein \\"Dzieje Ponieca do po≈Çowy XVI wieku‚Äù.

From that time royal families of both countries were family related through several marriages between ruling houses. It was therefore easy to find Hungarian nobles in Poland and Polish nobles in Hungary and Slovakia. Abel Biel was the first of the Ostojas to serve on the Hungarian Court, and was also the first to receive land in Upper Hungary.Polska Akademia Nauk, \\"Polski Slownik Biograficzny\\" (Polish Biographical Dictionary), Krakow from 1935 - Abel Biel Most of the Ostoja families supported the House of Anjou on Polish throne and when Luis I the Great entered the Polish throne in 1370 after Casimir III the Great, it made it possible for the Clan of Ostoja to expand south.Polska Akademia Nauk, \\"Polski Slownik Biograficzny\\" (Polish Biographical Dictionary), Krakow from 1935 - Moscic, Wojewoda Gniewkowski Hungary at that time was a modern and expansive kingdom, after Italy it was the first European country where the renaissance appeared. When Luis the Great died without a male heir some anarchy broke out in both the Kingdom of Poland and the Hungarian Empire. The Ostoja families continued to support the House of Anjou on both the Polish and Hungarian thrones. This did however not happen since Poland chose to ally with Lithuania and elected Ladislaus Jogaila to the Polish throne.  Stibor of Stiboricz and Sigismund von Luxemburg  Drawing of the seal of Stibor of Stiboricz Stibor of Stiboricz (1347‚Äì1414) of the Clan of Ostoja, son of Moscic Stiboricz (Duke of Gniewkowo), held the position of Lord of regality (Starosta) of Brzesc as he also served Louis I of Hungary but when the King died, he lost the position as Starost of Brzesk because of his support the House of Anjou and left Poland for Hungary.A. Prochaska, Scibor ze Sciborzyc, Roczniki Tow. Nauk. w Tor., R19: 1912 Although Stibor received office of Lord of the regality (Starost) of Kuyavia in 1383, he turned to help his friend Sigismund von Luxemburg (later Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor) on Hungarian throne 1386 and become his most loyal ally.Mark√≥, L√°szl√≥: A magyar √°llam f≈ëm√©lt√≥s√°gai Szent Istv√°nt√≥l napjainkig - √âletrajzi Lexikon (The High Officers of the Hungarian State from Saint Stephen to the Present Days - A Biographical Encyclopedia); Magyar K√∂nyvklub, 2000, Budapest; Houses of Habsburg and Luxenburg in the Holy Roman Empire, 1273-1378 Sigismund was the Prince of Brandenburg before rising to the Hungarian throne. He later became Holy Roman Emperor, King of Germany, Bohemia, Hungary (including present-day Slovakia, Balkan states, Romanian and Bulgarian lands), Italian republics and Prince of Luxembourg. At the age of 13, he was sent to Krakow in order to study Polish language and customs. He married Mary, daughter of Louis the Great and became one of the most powerful Emperors in Europe.M√°lyusz, Elem√©r: Zsigmond kir√°ly uralma Magyarorsz√°gon (King Sigismund's reign in Hungary); Gondolat, 1984; In Poland, as Stibor of Stiboricz recognized the competitors of Jogaila on Polish throne, he immediately entered Poland with an army of 12,000 men, commanded by Sigismund von Luxemburg, to assure that younger sister of Mary, Queen of Hungary, would mary Ladislaus Jogaila and end the battle for Polish Crown. 1384 Jadwiga was Crowned as Queen of Poland and in 1386 Jogaila married her and became King of Poland. Sigismund recognized Stibor of Stiboricz as his most loyal friend and adviser. In 1387 he granted Stibor the position as Master of Hungarian Court and also the Governor of Galicia (Eastern Europe). The King gave also Stibor the exclusive right to receive high offices in the Empire. In 1395, Stibor became Duke of Transylvania, a nomination that made him lord of almost half of Romania of today.History of Transylvania by Akad√©miai Kiad√≥ http://mek.niif.hu/03400/03407/html/118.html In 1396 Sigismund led the combined armies of Christendom against the Ottoman Empire. The Christians were defeated at the Battle of Nicopolis. Stibor of Stiboricz, one of the generals and commanders of the army, rescued Sigismund, who was in great danger while retreating from the battlefield. In May 1410, King Sigismund entrusted Stibor and the Palatine Nicholas II Garay to mediate between the Teutonic Knights and King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II of Poland, but when negotiations failed, war broke out. The Battle of Grunwald took place, with almost all of the Ostojas leaving Hungary to join Polish forces. At the end of 1411, Stibor, his brothers and other members of the Clan of Ostoja was in charge of leading troops to fight against the Venetian Republic in Friuli. In 1412 Stibor was meeting with Zawisza Czarny (The Black Knight) in his Castle of Star√° ƒΩubov≈àa in Slovakia, preparing the negotiation between Sigismund and Polish King Vladislav Jogaila, which ended with the Treaty of Lubowla.Dvo≈ô√°kov√°, Daniela: Rytier a jeho kr√°ƒæ.

In 1397 Sigismund chose Stibor as his representative in negotiations with the Polish King Jogaila, who appointed Mikolaj Bydgoski to represent Polish Crown. Thus the two brothers, Stibor and Mikolaj, met as leaders of their respective diplomatic delegations. Later on, around 1409, King Jogaila appointed his most trusted diplomat Miko≈Çaj B≈Çociszewski of the Clan of Ostoja to lead the negotiations. In the end, it was the Clan of Ostoja that was the leading force in breaking down Teutonic side, they did it not only by using fine art of sword but also with outstanding diplomatic skills.Antoni Prochaska http://kpbc.umk.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=12158&from;=publication&. = Land and nominations = In 1388 King Sigismund granted Stibor the Beckov and Uhrovec castles in Upper Hungary. In 1389 Stibor also became the Isp√°n of the Pozsony County, including the Bratislava Castle, where he appointed a castellan to administer the property. He also was granted the town Nov√© Mesto nad V√°hom.Dvo≈ô√°kov√°, Daniela : Rytier a jeho kr√°ƒæ. Stibor zo Stibor√≠c a ≈Ωigmund Lucembursk√Ω. Budmerice, Vydavatel'stvo Rak 2003, . In 1392 Stibor became the Isp√°n of the Trencs√©n and Nyitra counties, where he appointed clan members as castellans of the county. Furthermore, Stibor was granted the possession of Csejte and Holics (ƒåachtice and Hol√≠ƒç in present-day Slovakia).

In 1395 he became the Voivode of Transylvania and in 1403 he was entrusted to govern the possessions of the Archdiocese of Esztergom and the Diocese of Eger. Stibor was one of the founding members of the very exclusive Order of the Dragon in 1408, which consisted of European royals and powerful princes as well as some of most distinguished Hungarian Lords. In 1409, Stibor was reappointed Voivode of Transylvania, and was recognized as Duke of Transylvania.John V.A.

Because of that, Stibor stiled himself ‚ÄúLord of whole Vah‚Äù. He was governor of Archdiocese of Esztergom, Diocese of Eger, Master of Hungarian Court, closest friend and adviser to the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund. Adding the land, Castles and nominations that was granted to the Clan, close family of Stibor and the fact that Stibor of Stiboricz gave all important offices in his power almost only to family and Clan members, the Clan of Ostoja was in a strong position at the time.

They were all built to give good defense against an enemy. Inside the strongholds, the clan had own army unites, their upkeep was paid from the income Ostojas gained from their land that they owned or controlled. They could also afford to hire mercenaries when necessary and they were in close cooperation with each other, often visiting and helping to maintain the power they have been given. All of them were in possession of land that was much bigger than any of the clan members had in Poland. Although Sigismund's most loyal Stibors were not to help him anymore, the presence of the Clan in Upper Hungary was still significant. The testament told that the fortune of the Stibors was to be passed to the closest family which included children and grandchildren of Stibor of Stiboricz's brothers, all except the Beckov Castle with belongings that were supposed to be given to Katarina, daughter to Stibor Stiboric of Beckov.Polski Slownik Biograficzny, Polska Akademia Nauk, Krakow 1935, s. Moscic This testament was approved by the emperor Sigismund and his wife, the queen. The testament of his son, Stibor of Beckov, was in line with his father's, but with one important difference. It was written 4 August 1431 and the difference in the testament from his father's wish told that in case Stibor of Beckov did not have a son, all the properties that he personally owned would pass to his daughter Katarina. This however was under the condition that she would marry Przemyslaus II, Duke of Cieszyn of the Piast dynasty. In case of his death, Katarina was to marry his brother. If the marriage of Kararina and Duke Przemyslaus II did not result in any heir, all the properties would go back to the close family of Scibor of Beckov, as in the testament of his father. By this marriage, the Stibors of Ostoja would have dynastic claims in case of extinction of the Piast Dynasty in the future.Antoni Prochaska, Scibor ze Sciborzyc, p. 202 (p. 66 - http://kpbc.umk.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=12158&dirids;=1) Fighting many wars with Ottoman Empire could not stop the Turkish side to grow and take more land in east, west and south. Sigismund found himself in a difficult position. He already took a loan from Polish king when signing the Treaty of Lubovla but the royal coffers were empty since he used every penny in the war against rebellious Venice. Since he could not pay back the loan given by Polish king, he lost 16 towns in Spi≈° area to Polish side.Julia Radziszewska, Studia spiskie. Katowice 1985 Emperor Sigismund saw his enemies expanding in almost every direction. The Ottoman Empire in the east, Italian republics in south, the Hussite threat in north. However, the pact with Albert II of Germany that was supposed to marry Elisabeth of Bohemia, the daughter and heiress of Emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg, and the pact with the Clan of Ostoja was protecting north side of the Kingdom. And through marriage between Katarina of Beckov and the Duke Przemyslaw of the Piast dynasty, the Kingdom could count on more support in the battle against Hussite side. It was all set to form powerful coalition. As Albert II would be the successor on the Hungarian throne and the Clan of Ostoja would hold the position in Upper Hungary and south of Poland together with the Piast dynasty, the focus could then be to stop Ottoman Empire to expand more in west direction.A. Prochaska, Scibor ze Sciborzyc, Roczniki Tow. Nauk. w Tor., R19: 1912, s.146‚Äì205  Stibor of Beckov  Stibor of Beckov the younger's grave monument, Budapest History Museum His son Stibor of Beckov (also known as Stibor II), continued his father's work and succeeded in extending land holdings further. He was also appointed Lord of √Årva County including Orava (castle) and was also a member of the Order of the Dragon. The son of Stibor's brother Andrzej, also known as Stibor, was the Bishop of Eger in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Eger. When Sigismund took the nomination from him, he moved back to Poland but never accepted Sigismund's decision, ultimately calling himself Bishop of Eger to the end of his life. Although he was granted several nominations in Poland and held several properties, they could never match the properties that he was in charge of in Hungary. In 1407 Stefan of the Wawrzyniec line of Ostoja moved to Upper Hungary where Stibor gave him the position of Castellan of Ko≈°ecy. In 1415 he was in charge of the whole Trencs√©n on the behalf of Stibor. He expanded his properties with Ladce, Horn√© and Doln√© Koƒçkovce, Nosice and Milochov which he left to his six sons. Stibor of Stiboricz died in 1414 and was supposedly laid to rest in his own chapel inside St. Katarina's Church in Krakow. This was also supposedly the resting place for his son. It was also written that both father and son were buried in the chapel until 1903 when a grave of red marble stone was found in Buda. This was of Stibor Stiboric of Beckov, dated to 1431. In recent times, a grave was found in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r which had been broken into pieces as a result of Turkish destruction. However, it has now been established that this was the grave of Stibor of Stiboricz. It was made of the same stone, red marmor and when the piece of coat of arms was finally found and there was no doubt. Stibor was granted a place beside other members of the Hungarian royalty.Informator o kaplicy ≈õw. Moniki przy ko≈õciele ≈õw. Katarzyny w Krakowie ‚Äì Archiwum Si√≥str Augustianek, ul.

Aleksandra J√≥zefa Trojan Since Stibor of Beckov (died 1434) did not have any heirs who could inherit existing properties, the testament told that it would be passed onto the closest family, including Beckov Castle that was made as power center of the clan in Upper Hungary. This Castle was made to be one of the most significant residences of that time, including great paintings, sculptures and chapel that was formed by artist from many different countries.Igor ƒéuriƒç, N√°rodn√° Obroda. 2004-06-08.http://www.obroda.sk/clanok/9270/Hrady-Slovenska--Beckov/ . Retrieved January 19, 2008. Several testaments have been approved by the Emperor Sigismund and also his wife. The main issue in those was that all the properties of the Stibors in the kingdom of Hungary would be divided by closest family in case of lack of hair in the line. In that way, the land would stay in family hands.Antoni Prochaska, based on Wenzel http://kpbc.umk.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=12158&from;=publication& Unfortunately, Stibor de Beckov died suddenly in battle against Hussite forces soon after the agreement between Emperor Sigismund, Albert II of Germany and the Piast dynasty had been made. Just a few weeks later, a peace agreement with the Hussites was signed. It was now up to Katarina to marry Duke Przemyslaw II in accordance with her father's wish. However, this was not to happen as Katarina later married Lord P√°l B√°nffy of Alsolindva. Soon after, Stibor the Bishop of Eger lost his office and the Wawrzyniec lost all their offices and properties including the Castle of Ko≈°ecy (which had previously been granted by Stibor of Stiboricz). All this was a result of their support for the Hussites. According to the testament, all lands possessed by the Ostoja clan in Upper Hungary was to be passed to the closest family of Stibor. Mikolaj Szarlejski When all hereditary lines mentioned with the testament became extinct, Mikolaj Szarlejski inherited all the land holdings and properties. He was the son of Mikolaj Bydgoski, Lord castellan of Bydgoszcz and brother of Stibor of Stiboricz. Szarlejski was, at the time of the death of Stibor of Beckov, the Commander of the Polish forces in Prussia as well as Voivode of Brzesc-Kujawy. Besides this, he was also lord of several regalities and ultimately one of the most powerful and influential lords within Poland. However, Szarlejski supported the Hussites and was undertaking several hostile raids on Hungarian properties and strongholds which was not in accordance with the policy of the family. Since the land of Ostoja in Slovakia was the primary defense against the Hussites, it would now be in hands of the enemy. In this situation and because Katarina did not marry her Prince of Piast, Emperor Sigismund gave orders to the Hungarian Court to cancel the testament of Stibor of Beckov. The testament was cancelled on 28 March 1435.Antoni Prochaska, Scibor ze Sciborzyc, p.204 (p.68 - http://kpbc.umk.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=12158&dirids;=1) Mindfull of Stibor's past loyalty and friendship, Sigismund did not leave Katarina of Beckov without financial support. She received one-fourth of the value of all properties in cash. Also on the day of his death, Sigismund gave Beckov Castle and belongings to P√°l B√°nffy. This was under the condition that he marry Katarina which was also fulfilled. Although Katarina received only 25% of the total property value, this some was considered significant but did not stay in the Ostoja family.Meier, J√∂rg; Piirainen, Ilpo Tapani; Wegera, Klaus-Peter, Deutschsprachige Handschriften in slowakischen Archiven, Berlin 2009, In 1440 W≈Çadys≈Çaw III of the Jagiellon dynasty assumed the Hungarian throne and for 4 years he was king of both Poland and Hungary. However, he died in the Battle of Varna and his brother Casimir IV Jagiellon became King of Poland in 1447. Casimir married Elisabeth of Austria (1436‚Äì1505), daughter of the late King of Hungary Albert II of Germany and Elisabeth of Bohemia (daughter of Sigismund, the Emperor and King of Hungary). The Jagiellon House challenged the House of Habsburg in Bohemia and Slovakia. 1466 Following the death of Albert II of Germany in 1439 when defending Hungary against Turks, Mikolaj Szarlejski recognized opportunity to regain the land of his family and the Clan in Slovakia. Szarlejski tried to convince Hungarian Royal Council that family properties have been taken in violation of the law. However, Hungarian Lords and Royal Council in Hungary had no intention to give back all of the north defence to their enemy. Then in 1439 Szarlejski decided to raise army against Hungary. With help of the Hussite side, he succeeded to siege several strongholds in the Vah area. Supported by Jan de Jani of Ostoja, the Voivode of Pomerania and Gda≈Ñsk and several other powerful Lords from the Clan of Ostoja and with support of many friends, the war against Hungarian Empire and Germany was in the beginning successful. Unfortunately, Szarlejski although being in charge of Polish forces in Prussia, did not have any significant commanding talentMarian Biskup, Wojna trzynastoletnia, Gda≈Ñsk 1965 and ironically, both Stibor of Stiboricz and his son Stibor Stiboric of Beckov made great improvements in the fortification of their Castles which made siege of many of them almost impossible. Beckov Castle would later hold siege from Turkish side about 100 years later. As result of that and because the enemy was too strong, military action failed.Antoni Prochaska, Scibor ze Sciborzyc, p.205-206 (p.69-70 - http://kpbc.umk.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=12158&dirids;=1) The line of Stibor of Stiboricz was extinct, other lines of Stibor's family that derived from Stibor of Stiboricz brothers and that was called Stiborici in Hungaria (the Barons of Hungarian Kingdom)Magyar Arisztokr√°cia - http://ferenczygen.tripod.com/ was also extinct. Szarlejski had no heir of his own and his large properties in Poland was past to the Ko≈õcielecki family of Ogo≈Ñczyk Clan as the daughter of Stibor Jedrzny married Jan Ko≈õcielecki, close friend and ally of Szarlejski. Economic power of Jan de Jani was broken because of all wars with Teutonic knights that he had to pay for himself and all the lines of the Moscic of Stiboricz (Stibor of Stiboricz's father) was extinct. However, other lines of the Clan that still was considered as close family to the Stibors was in position to be the successors of the land in Slovakia in case of death of Szarlejski.  Stibor of Poniec  Malbork (Marienburg), Teutonic Knight stronghold captured by Stibor de Poniec of Ostoja The great diplomatic work achieved by Stibor and Mikolaj was to be continued by Stibor of Poniec some 50 years later. He raised funds in Gda≈Ñsk (Danzig) for a campaign against the Teutonic Knights who held Malbork (Marieburg). The Teutonic Knights had financial difficulties at this time and were in great debt to the bulk of their main defensive force which consisted of Czech/Moravian mercenaries. Using the money from Gda≈Ñsk, Stibor de Poniec was able to persuade the mercenaries to leave the stronghold and he took control of Malbork without battle; King Casimir IV Jagiellon entered the castle in 1457.http://www.poniec.pl - \\"Historia rodu Ponieckich - ≈öcibor \\" This led to the Second Treaty of Thorn, sealed in 1466 by Sibor of Poniec. Furthermore, he negotiated on behalf of the Polish king with Denmark which had supported the Teutonic Knights, and succeeded in ending a Danish blockade on Polish commerce in the Baltic Sea.Antoni Eckstein \\"Dzieje Ponieca do po≈Çowy XVI wieku‚Äù. Roczniki Historyczne nr 2 1926 r. Other members of the Clan of Ostoja were also recognized as formidable knights in the conflict against the Teutonic Order. Stefan of Lieskov√° (Leski) of Wawrzyniec line of Ostoja Stefan of Lieskov√° (Leski) of the Wawrzyniec line of the Clan had six sons. All their properties in Hungary were confiscated in 1462 by Matthias Corvinus of Hungary because of their support for the Hussites. Ko≈°eca together with all other properties were given instead to the Mad‚Äôar (Magyar) family that were fighting against the Hussites at the time. In 1467, Wawrzyniec and his Hussite allies successfully repossessed Ko≈°eca Castle but shortly after lost control again to the Hungarians. The Mad‚Äôar family became extinct in 1491 and Ko≈°eca Castle with other properties were given to the Z√°polya family in 1496. At that time the Jagiellon dynasty were kings of both Poland-Lithuania and Hungary. The Wawrzyniec line protested against the Z√°polya family being in possession of their properties, however, the Z√°polya family were too powerful and also hereditary-linked with the Jagiellons since Barbara Zapolya became Queen of Poland in 1512 and Jan Zapolya (J√°nos Szapolyai) became King of Hungary in 1526.Urbasie - http://www.urbasie.org/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=34&Itemid;=19/ Also in Poland, the Wawrzyniec line of Ostoja together with other members of the Clan, claimed the property of Szarlejski that passed to Ko≈õcielecki as well as Janski (de Jani) family claimed compensation from the King but also here the resistance was great big and finally they gave up plans to reclaim these properties.  Aftermath  Ostoja landholdings were extensive and were a source of power. The Stibors in Slovakia were one of the most powerful families in Europe. Comparing with the Habsburg dynasty, the Clan had good chance to challenge if they would stay united and with the Stibors as leading force in Upper Hungary. However, it was necessary for the Stibors to be related with ruling dynasties or those that have been ruling to be able to claim power in the future. Marriage with prime families of central Europe was not enough. The family needed to be connected with royal blood. Instead of challenging Habsburgs, Stibor of Beckov and the Clan of Ostoja made agreement of cooperation which would benefit both sides. Both sides had equal forces and before Albert II of Germany become king of Hungary, Stibor of Stiboricz successfully challenge Austria, burning down the country to the ground except for Vienna that he left alone. Lack of heirs that could continue politics of the Clan successfully was also part of the reason of economical problems. While in most countries properties was past to younger lines in the family, in Poland women have same rights to inherit the properties as males. Since all main lines of the Clan suddenly faced lack of males at same time, it were the daughters that inherited the properties and brought them into other families through marriage. As did Katarina when she married Pal Banffy. The Banffy family inherited all the founds given to Katarina by the Emperor Sigismund when giving her 1/4 of all property value in cash. The Beckov castle was in the hands of the Banffy until also this family became extinct and Beckov returned to the Hungarian Crown. Finally, it was coordinated politics of the Clan of Ostoja that made it powerful. It was also Szarlejski's own politics that in the end ruined family power in Slovakia. Although the Clan supported Poland against Teutonic Knights, they did not support the Jagiellon dynasty in the beginning as the kings of Poland. Clan members staying and living in Poland was however granted power by Jagiellon kings in return for their support. In many cases, the Clan was forced to raise funds from their own treasury in order to defend Polish borders.Poniec www.poniec.pl ‚Äì ‚ÄúJak Chelmscy stali sie Ponieckimi In the end, it was during the reign of the Jagiellon dynasty, the Clan of Ostoja lost its power and all doubts that the Clan had against those kings from the beginning, become very true. Also in Hungarian history, Jagiellon dynasty have been described as weak and incompetent, which was the result of the politics of the Lords of Lesser Poland as they were responsible of electing kings who would sign documents in favor of their financial ambitions rather than choosing strong kings with benefit for the kingdom. As the main properties in both Slovakia and Poland were finally lost, the economic power was broken and the Clan of Ostoja was outside the politics of Poland for next 100 years,Kaspar Niesiecki, Herbarz Polski, print Jan Bobrowicz, Leipzig 1839-1846 list of important offices in Poland and Commonwealth concentrating mostly in increasing their land properties, holding offices on local level.  Commonwealth era  Commonwealth in Europe In the late medieval period, the Clan set out rebuilding the power base that had been weakened through attrition of its senior lines. In 1450, the Clan adopted families of powerful knights, leading provincial nobility, and several princes. The Union of Horod≈Ço of 1413 initiated a significant drive toward unification of Polish and Lithuanian / Belarus nobility and clergy. 47 prominent Catholic Lithuanian / Belarus and Ruthuanian families were symbolically adopted into 47 Polish clans. Subsequently, several other families from the east joined the Clan structure in the next adoption wave in 1450. These Lithuanian, Belarus and Russian nobility were granted the same rights as their Polish equivalents. Piekosinski provides a list of adopted families as well as families that received nobility.Franciszek Piekosinski - \\"O dynastycznem szlachty polskiej pochodzenia\\", Krakow 1888 It appears that no more than 20 families in total joined the Clan of Ostoja in 1450.Adam Boniecki \\"Herbarz Polski\\" Warszawa 1899-1913, Severyn Uruski \\"Rodzina. Herbarz Szlachty Polskiej\\", Warszawa 1904-1917, Kojalowicz, Kasper Niesiecki, \\"Herbarz Polski\\" Leipzig, 1839-1846 At the end of 15th and beginning of the 16th century the Commonwealth was the biggest and one of the most powerful countries in Europe. In 1569, the Union of Lublin created a real union of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, replacing the personal union of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It encompassed territories from Poland, Lithuania, Prussia, Latvia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldavia, Podolia, part of Spisz and part of Russia including Smolensk. Union of Lublin The Union of Lublin marked the end of a 150 years period of Commonwealth expansion and consolidation. The skills needed to expand and secure national borders were different from what was required when the expansion was completed. The new nation needed new kind of administration, and as new goals become paramount the age of brave knights passed. Clan organization lost importance, and interfamilial cooperation lessened. Trakai Castle, residence of Sluszka and Unichowski families Throughout the Commonwealth, the administrative structure was generally similar, albeit with some important differences. In Poland, the use of titles by the nobility was formally discontinued by the constitution of 1638, the nobility being equal according to the law, which was confirmed in 1641 and 1673.Tomasz Lenczewski, Genealogie rod√≥w utytu≈Çowanych, Part I, p.10, pulblished 1995-1996, ref. http://www.genealog.home.pl/gd/szablony/pojecia.php?lang=pl&file;=khtwp However, in actual practice families with close descent from the major dynastic origins such as the Ostoja families of Stibor line or some to the Clan adopted families, who had held important positions in Poland during medieval times and thus held titles such as comes or dux (duke, voivode, count palatine) never accepted the equality system and they continued to utilize their titles, particularly when traveling abroad or on diplomatic missions. The titles were in the 13th century used during the lifetime but it was common to pas it to next generation although according to the law, all nobility had equal rights and hold equal rank. Looking for influential families in Poland, one must look for the senatorial position and not the titles that have been given to Poles during the partition time of the Commonwealth. Those families were never equal to simple noblemen or knights but more equal to English peers, with the difference that the title was inherited by all members of the family, not only the oldest son like it is in England. All of those old and powerful medieval families that played central role in building Polish Empire was part of hereditary High Nobility.Bogucki A., Komes w polskich ≈∫r√≥d≈Çach ≈õredniowiecznych, Warszawa-Pozna≈Ñ 1972 Knights that became part of the Clan of Ostoja in medieval times were never equal to the mighty Lords of Ostoja but were in the 14th and 15th century given rights equal to medieval German Baron that origin from knights and in time also become in function more like German Freiherr.Grodecki R., Polska piastowska, Warszawa 1969 The Union of Lublin made an exception for the Lithuanian Prince families and therefore the Commonwealth could see several Lithuanian, Russian or Belarus families with titles. Some of those families was very powerful and wealthy. In time of the Commonwealth they expanded their properties to be of such size that there were few families in Europe to match them. They were the magnates of the Commonwealth.Etymological Dictionary of the Polish Language, first edition, Krakow 1927 (9th edition, Warsaw, Wiedza Powszechna, 2000) Magnates of the Commonwealth are often called the aristocracy of the Commonwealth but the definition of what constitutes aristocracy differs from the rest of Europe in that the Magnate families were much more powerful, often comparable to Princes. A good example is the extinct family of PacJerzy Jan Lerski, Piotr Wr√≥bel, Richard J. Kozicki (1996). Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966-1945. Greenwood Publishing. p. 415. https://books.google.com/books?id=FPxhOu_n1VYC&pg;=PA415&dq;=pac+lithuanian&client;=firefox-a that ruled the Duchy of Lithuania in the 17th century. The Pac family had not descended from a Prince, and therefore did not use any title at all. During the partition of the Commonwealth the Pac family received the title of Count. However, when looking at the size of the Pac properties and their position in the Commonwealth, a simple Count title seems not adequate to their power and property size that was far beyond imagination of most of the European Lords.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Czapli≈Ñski, J. D≈Çugosz, ≈ªycie codzienne magnaterii polskiej w XVII wieku, Warszawa 1976 Properties of some Magnates in the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth Polish Magnates 1576-1586 Partly in Poland but certainly in Grand Dutchy of Lithuania and Ukraine, almost all important positions was in the hands of the Magnates and it was passed through generations. The only question was which of those about 20 great Magnate families would rule most Voivodeship, Counties and Provinces. The list of those Magnates during the days of the Commonwealth include following families:# Antoni MƒÖczak, Magnateria, w: Encyklopedia historii Polski do 1945 roku, t. I, Warszawa 1981 Princely Houses: Radziwill, Sapieha, Wisniowiecki, Lubomirski, Czartoryski, Ostrogski, Sanguszko. Other Magnat families: Chodkiewicz, Pac, Tyszkiewicz, Zamoyski, Hlebowicz (without any hereditary title), Mniszech, Potocki. Those families had most significant impact on the politics of the Commonwealth. They chose the candidate for the King and they made sure that the candidate was chosen to serve their interest. The nobility voted for the candidate that Magnates and other aristocracy told them to vote on. The Magnates became the true power in the Commonwealth and the King was, with some few exceptions, only a Marionette of the Magnates in their political game. Furthermore, there were then some 50-60 influential and very wealthy families and with great family history, sometimes with Prince titles. However, those families did not have same impact on the politics of the Commonwealth, still being considered as Magnats of the Commonwealth. Among them there are most magnificent families like Lanckoronski, Tarnowski, Tƒôczy≈Ñski, Prince Holszanski, Rzewuski, Gonzaga- Myszkowski or Prince Czertwertynski. The next 300-400 families (of in total tens of thousands of noble familiesornatowski.com) counting in power and land possession in the Commonwetlh could more likely be equal to the European aristocracy when referring to counts and barons. Those families should also be included as aristocrats but most publicationsSzymon Konarski's Armorial de la Noblesse Polonaise Titree (Paris, 1958), Genealogie Rodow Utytulowanych w Polsce (vol. 1) by Tomasz Lenczewski (1995-1996) refer only to titled nobility as the aristocracy which is not in accordance with Polish rank system during the time of the Commonwealth. There were many wealthy and influential families that hold several offices in the family like Voivode, Castellan, Bishop or Hetman which gave them a place in the Senat of the Commonwealth. This group hold many great families like Sieniawski, Arciszewski, Ossolinski, Koniecpolski, Prince Giedrojc and finally also many families included in the Clan of Ostoja.Adam Boniecki \\"Herbarz Polski\\" Warszawa 1899-1913, Severyn Uruski \\"Rodzina. Herbarz Szlachty Polskiej\\", Warszawa 1904-1917 According to the Etymological Dictionary of the Polish Language, \\"a proper magnate should be able to trace noble ancestors back for many generations and own at least 20 villages or estates. He should also hold a major office in the Commonwealth\\". By this definition, the number of magnates in the Clan of Ostoja is considerably high. Lords like Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, Wi≈õniowiecki or Stibor of Stiboricz who was among the richest and most influential dukes in Europe were much more than local magnates. They ruled a nation, either Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine or Slovakia. Aristocratic titles given to noble families in the time of partition of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by Russian, Prussian and Austrian emperors as well as by the Holy Vatican City State cannot be compared with the titles from medieval times. Those are, except single cases, foreign titles. The constitution of 1921 (¬ß96) in March, removed all the titles in Poland including the nobility itself. However, the constitution of 1935, did not confirm paragraph 96 in the constitution of 1921. Therefore, families that received or bought titles from foreign Emperors could still legally use them. As the titles were not legally forbidden, the peerage of old families in Poland was also taken into consideration. However, usually when referring to titles in Poland, this is understood to mean the titles given during the partition.Leszek Jan Jastrzƒôbiec-Czajkowski on Ornatowski.com http://www.ornatowski.com/lib/zhistoriiszlachty.htm In this way, families included in the Clan of Ostoja and having origin from medieval time, are all considered as High Nobility.  16th century  Bobolice Castle, property of the Kreza family of Ostoja Micha≈Ç Sƒôdziw√≥j from Sƒôdzimir of Ostoja family Polish Ostoja families almost totally disappeared from political life in the 16th century. Nevertheless, the late 16th century features some notable Clan members. Kacper Karli≈Ñski, Lord castellan of Olsztyn, is known for his legendary defence of the town in 1587. Maciej Kawƒôczy≈Ñski reformed the printing system in Lithuania. Miko≈Çaj Kreza was Rittmeister of the Crown.

First half of the century was the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. In Lithuania families were fighting for supremacy in the Grand Duchy which led to many confrontations. The leading families were those of Prince Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, Prince Sapieha and Pac. In Volyn, Podole and Ukraine the Wisniowiecki family reached the supremacy of the area. The estimated number of people working for Wisniowiecki on his estates was almost 300,000Ilona Czamanska, \\"Wisniowieccy; Monografia Rodu\\", at that time. In Lithuania, the Sluszka and Unichowski families of the Clan of Ostoja raised in great power. Krzysztof S≈Çuszka became Voivode of Livonia and Aleksander S≈Çuszka Castellan of Samogitia and later Voivide of Minsk, then Voivode of Novogrod and ended as Voivode of Trakai in 1647. Samuel Unichowski of Ostoja followed up 40 years later and also became the Voivode of Trakai. Lady El≈ºbieta S≈Çuszka (1619‚Äì1671) was the richest and most powerful Lady of the Commonwealth.Jerzy Lileyko (1984). ≈ªycie codzienne w Warszawie za Waz√≥w (Everyday Life in Warsaw under the Vasas). Warsaw. pp. 201‚Äì202. She was the Crown Court Marshall and after the death of her first husband inherited the Kazanowski Palace in Warsaw. Josef Bogus≈Çaw Sluszka (1652‚Äì1701) was Hetman and Castellan of Trakai and Vilnius. Dominik Micha≈Ç S≈Çuszka (1655‚Äì1713) was the Voivode of Polotsk and finally Aleksander Jozef Unichowski became the Castellan of Samogitia. Other families in Lithuania that were part of the Clan of Ostoja became very wealthy. Prince Boratynski's family joined the ClanAdam Boniecki \\"Herbarz Polski\\" Warszawa 1899-1913 already in 1450 and was often holding high military rank. Prince Palecki's family also joined at the same time. The Danielewicz family was included in the Pac family by adoption of Micha≈Ç Danielewicz, son of Katarzyna Pac (daughter of Voivode of Trakai) and inherited part of their great land possessions including Bohdanow and the town of Kretinga.Roman Aftanazy Dzieje dawnych rezydencji na dawnych kresach Rzaczpospolitej, Wojewodztwo Wilenskie, v.4, p.37 and 120 In Poland, the Szyszkowski family of Ostoja became very powerful. Piotr Szyszkowski was the Catellan of Wojno 1643, Marcin Szyszkowski was the Bishop of Krak√≥w and Prince of Siewierz and Miko≈Çaj Szyszkowski became the Prince-bishop of Warmia in 1633. Both Prince Miko≈Çaj and Prince Marcin had great impact on the politics of the Commonwealth. Following information is mainly taken from Polish Wikipedia. Salomon Rysi≈Ñski (1565‚Äì1625) was famous writer at the time, Krzysztof Boguszewski was one of the most famous painters and artists of Greater Poland and Stanis≈Çaw Bzowski (1567‚Äì1637) was member of Dominican Order, friend of reforms, appointed by Vatikan City to write down its history. Wojciech Gajewski was the Castellan of Rogozin 1631‚Äì1641, ≈Åukasz Gajewski became Castellan of Santok in 1661, Micha≈Ç Scibor-Rylski the Castellan of Gostyn in 1685, Miko≈Çaj Scibor Marchocki, the Castellan of Malogoski (≈ªarn√≤w) 1697 and Jan Stachurski was leading the army against the Cossack uprising as Major General in 1664. The most famous Clan members in that century were Kazimierz Siemienowicz, General of artillery, military engineer, artillery specialist and the pioneer of rocketry, whose publication was for 200 years used as the main artillery manual in Europe,Tadeusz Nowak \\"Kazimierz Siemienowicz, ca.1600-ca.1651\\", MON Press, Warsaw 1969 and Micha≈Ç Sƒôdziw√≥j (Michael Sendivogius, Sƒôdzimir) (1566‚Äì1636), from the Sƒôdzimir branch of the Clan, was a famous European alchemist, philosopher and medical doctor. A pioneer of chemistry, he developed ways of purification and creation of various acids, metals and other chemical compounds. He discovered that air is not a single substance and contains a life-giving substance-later called oxygen-170 years before Scheele and Priestley. He correctly identified this 'food of life' with the gas (also oxygen) given off by heating nitre (saltpetre). This substance, the 'central nitre', had a central position in Sƒôdziw√≥j's schema of the universe.Michael Sendivogius, The Alchemical Letters of Michael Sendivogius to the Rosicrucian Society, Holmes Pub Group Llc, Sƒôdziw√≥j was famous in Europe, and was widely sought after as he declared that he could make gold from quicksilver, which would have been a useful talent. During a demonstration on how to make the gold, in presence of the Emperor Rudolph II, Sƒôdziw√≥j was captured and robbed by a German alchemist named Muhlenfels who had conspired with the German prince, Brodowski, to steal Sƒôdziw√≥j's secret.  18th century  Otrokov Castle of Scibor-Marchocki family Palace in Wzdow, property of Ostaszewski family Partitions of Poland Adam Ostaszewski, \\"Leonardo from Wzdow\\" The 18th century Commonwealth suffered from a series of incompetent kings of foreign origin whose main interest was fighting personal wars against other countries. Persistent wars and general turmoil bankrupted the national finances, and many power-hungry Magnates cooperated with foreign forces. The last king, Poniatowski, was paid by Catherine II of Russia and was obliged to report to Russian ambassador Otto Magnus von Stackelberg. He was furthermore richly paid to facilitate the constitution of May 3, 1791 but because of his character or rather lack of it, he did not fulfill his promise.Tadeusz Korzon, \\"Wewnetrzne dzieje Polski za Slanislawa Augusta\\", Krakow 1897 On the other hand, Poniatowski did care about cultural life in Poland, supported necessary education of young patriots and also did not go against members of the Bar confederation. Most families that signed Poniatowski's election, including many Ostoja families, were signing for the Czartoryski family who wanted to make necessary changes in the Commonwealth.Jerzy Jan Lerski, Piotr Wr√≥bel, Richard J. Kozicki (1996). Historical dictionary of Poland, 966-1945. Greenwood Publishing. p. 94. However, to support those changes Czartoryski asked for help from Russia, an offer that Russia could not resist. At the beginning of the period, the Ostoja families in Lithuania and Poland avoided engagement in this political chaos. The king was appointing those that supported his own ambitions, which was the beginning of some new great fortunes. This political disaster ended in Partitions of Poland, 1772 when Prussia, Austria and Russia decided to divide defenseless Commonwealth between them. Poniatowski's reign until 1795 became the darkest chapter in Polish history. The Constitution of May 3, 1791 came far too late. This was the first time that the Commonwealth included Ruthenians and not just Poland and Lithuania. New Commonwealth was to be formed of three nations. Also this intention came far too late. However, the Constitution of May 3 united families that wanted to make necessary changes and that would serve the nation. In this movement we suddenly see lot of activity from the Ostoja families.Minakowski, \\"Potomkowie Sejmu Wielkiego\\", Almost all of them supported the movement and in many cases all members of the family joined, women and men. In the first half of the century, the Ostoja families hold many offices and was still prospecting. In the second half of the century, they clearly turned into military commanders and supporters of the resistance, leading Confederations and armies against foreign forces and specially against Russia. Ignacy ≈öcibor Marchocki of Ostoja (1755‚Äì1827) created famous \\"Kingdom of Mi≈Ñkowce\\".Boryslav Gryschiuk - Ignacy Scibor-Marchocki, http://www.castles.com.ua/marchocki.html Marchocki proclaimed his estates an independent state and installed on its borders pillars with the name plates, identifying that this is \\"The border of Minkowce state\\". The \\"Kingdom\\" hold one town, 18 villages and 4 Castles (one for each season) with some 4200 souls living in the \\"Kingdom\\". Marchocki liberated peasants from serfdom, granted them self-government, established jury (court with jury and court of appeal), built school, pharmacy, orphanage, churches and monuments, cloth and carriage factories, factory of anis apple oil production, with brickyard, varnish and paint plants, with mulberry trees gardens. Its own paper was manufactured there and lime ‚Äì calcined. He opened his own printing house, where different decrees (like \\"agreement between the Lord and the peasants\\"), directions, resolutions and even sermons, later delivered by him in Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches. The government of the Kingdom that included Jews, serfs, town citizens, peasants and foreigners. He also employed two doctors within the property. The central body of the State was the County Court as well as Court of Appeal. The main thing in the State was to give all citizens equal legal rights. All of this was of course reported to Russian Administration that in the beginning was stunned, thinking that it was an act of madness. However, the \\"Kingdom\\" was working excellent and the Lord of the Kingdom was getting richer and more famous, buying even more properties and land to expand the \\"Kingdom\\" including 40.000 ha land around Odessa. Life inside his estate was considered as heaven comparing to normal life peasants outside the border pillars which would more correctly be referred as hell. Peasants was at that time normally property of the estate that could be sold any time. In the \\"Kingdom\\" people was living in wealth and prosperity and Marchocki himself was the most successful administrator of his goods in Russian Empire.Sylwester Groza, ‚ÄûHrabia ≈öcibor na Ostrowcu‚Äù, tom I‚ÄìII, Warszawa 1848 This eccentric man was summertime wearing a Roman Toga during official meetings on the property that looked like picture taken from paradise. In the end, this started to worry Russian administration that gave order to burn down all the printing so this madness would not spread to other provinces. This could cause a revolution because suddenly it was clear that making democracy inside a property was making owners rich and people happy. Soon, every citizen of not noble origin in the area wanted to live in the \\"Kingdom of Mi≈Ñkowce\\". It was a plague that started to spread all over the countryside and infect entire system. To stop this revolution, the Tsar ordered Marchocki captured and imprisoned. Following information and source is taken from Polish Wikipedia.

The local nobility rallied to fight this occupation and actively participated in the Napoleonic Wars.

However, some Ostoja families, who participated these nationalistic uprisings and other military actions, were punished by having their properties confiscated. For example, according to Norman Davis, the consequences of the January Uprising in 1863 in the Russian part of the former Commonwealth included deportation of 80,000 people to Siberia and other working camps. Confiscated Ostoja properties were given over to those who were loyal to Russia, Austria or Prussia. In such way, several families gained in power during the partition, receiving high offices, nominations and lot of land. They were also given noble titles of Baron or Count or even Prince for their support and service. But Ostojas were not only good at fighting the enemy. Families kept part of their properties, manor houses and palaces outside the conflict and war to be able to support refugees, wounded and those in need.

Krichell's talent evaluations and signings played a key role in building up the Yankees' run of success from the Murderers' Row teams of the 1920s to the 1950s teams led by Casey Stengel.James (1995), p. 217 Krichell began his professional career in the minor leagues, playing as the reserve catcher for the St. Louis Browns before a serious injury threatened his career. He continued to play in the minor leagues and began to move into coaching before Yankees manager Ed Barrow signed him as a scout in 1920. Considered one of the greatest scouts in baseball history, Krichell signed over 200 players who later played professional baseball, including future Baseball Hall of Famers Lou Gehrig, Hank Greenberg, Phil Rizzuto, Whitey Ford, and Tony Lazzeri. His recommendation of Stengel as the Yankees manager was instrumental in Stengel's appointment in 1948. Barrow called Krichell \\"the best judge of baseball players he ever saw\\".Gallagher, p. 343 Early life Krichell was born in Paris, France, the son of a German cabinetmaker and youngest of nine children. He grew up in The Bronx, near the site of the future Yankee Stadium. Krichell made his professional baseball debut in 1903 as a catcher with the Ossining, New York club in the Hudson River League's inaugural season. He moved to the Hartford Senators of the Connecticut League in 1906 and spent most of the following three years with the Newark Indians of the Eastern League. For the latter part of the 1909 season and the whole of 1910, Krichell played for the Montreal Royals at third base. In 1910, he played 102 games for the team, achieving a batting average of .249 and hitting 14 doubles.Levitt, p. 75 Krichell began his long association with manager Ed Barrow that year when the latter took charge of the Royals. Playing and managing career Ty Cobb of the Detroit Tigers crashing into Krichell in 1912 to make him drop the ball.In 1911, Krichell joined the St. Louis Browns as a reserve catcher, playing 28 games with a .232 batting average, 19 hits and 8 runs batted in during 82 at bats. The following year, he managed 59 games while sharing catching duties with Jim Stephens. In 161 at bats, Krichell achieved 35 hits and a .217 batting average. His fielding percentage was .959 that season. Ty Cobb of the Detroit Tigers stole second, third, and home plate in the same inning of a game while Krichell was catching.Eig, p. 38-40 In a later game, a famous photograph captures Cobb appearing to Intentionally be flying foot-first into Krichell‚Äôs crotch while the catcher squints in pained anticipation. There is a 1950s interview with Krichell, and by his own testimony, Cobb was aiming his foot at the ball in Krichell‚Äôs glove, and succeeded in knocking it to the backstop. ‚ÄúThe ball hit the grandstand on the fly. I was mad and stunned. Cobb was mad and shaken. In a way it was really my fault. I was standing in front of the plate, instead of on the side, where I could tag Ty as he slid in. But out of that mix-up I learned one thing: never stand directly in front of the plate when Cobb was roaring for home.‚Äù After the 1912 season, the Browns released Krichell, but after recovering from his injury, he played six seasons in the minor leagues. He was the starting catcher for the Buffalo Bisons in 1914 when Babe Ruth made his professional debut with the Baltimore Orioles, hitting a double and a single against his pitching. From 1917 to 1918, Krichell served as manager for Bridgeport of the Eastern League, making several playing appearances over the two seasons.Levitt, p. 188 He resigned on June 27, 1918, after two wins were forfeited when he used a player not under contract. He worked in the shipyards during the First World War. During the offseason, Krichell became the owner of a saloon popular with players in the Bronx, before Prohibition forced Krichell to close and return to baseball. For the 1919 season, he coached the New York University baseball team, and after the season ended, he signed with Ed Barrow to become a coach and scout for the Boston Red Sox in the following season. Scouting career Krichell's most significant signing for the Yankees was Lou Gehrig, when he was a player at alt=A photo of a man in his baseball uniform. smiling. Prior to the 1921 season, Barrow was appointed general manager of the New York Yankees and requested that Krichell join him as a full-time scout. At the time, the Yankees had a two-man scouting rotation, and Barrow believed the appointment of Krichell would improve the scouting staff. The first player signed by Krichell was Hinkey Haines, an outfielder from Penn State University. He signed catcher Benny Bengough from Buffalo of the International League, and Charlie Caldwell, a Princeton University graduate. Caldwell was used mainly as a batting practice pitcher, appearing in just three games in his major league career. During one practice, Caldwell fractured Wally Pipp's skull with a high fastball,Eig, p. 66 allowing Lou Gehrig to assume Pipp's place in the starting lineup.Eig, p. 67 Discovery of Gehrig Early in the 1923 season, while traveling to New Brunswick, New Jersey for a baseball game between Columbia University and Rutgers University,Eig, p. 38 Krichell shared a train with the manager of the Columbia squad, Andy Coakley.Eig, p. 39 They discussed Lou Gehrig, a left-handed pitcher on his squad who could also hit, and later that day, Gehrig hit two home runs in three at-bats. Following the game, Krichell spoke with Barrow, saying he had found the \\"next Babe Ruth\\".Frommer, p. 44 Skeptical, Barrow sent Krichell to watch Columbia's next game against New York University, where Gehrig hit a home run that reportedly went out of the stadium.Eig, p. 40 After the game, Krichell persuaded Gehrig to sign for the Yankees for $2,000 ($ in 2010) for the remainder of 1923, with a $1,500 bonus ($ in 2010). Krichell also asked Gehrig to give up pitching to focus on being a hitter. After joining up with the team for batting practice in June 1923, Gehrig was sent by Yankees manager Miller Huggins to the Hartford Senators. After a good start, Gehrig went through a long slump and suffered depression which led him to consider quitting baseball.Eig, pp. 41, 44, 48 Upon hearing this, Krichell was sent to Hartford to speak with the star player. He discovered that Gehrig was drinking, boosted his confidence and gave him batting advice, including one of Ty Cobb's batting tricks.Eig, p. 49 Gehrig started hitting again, and eventually joined the Yankees. Later signings 1920s alt=A black-and-white photo of a man posting in front of the camera. He is wearing his uniform, holding a baseball bat. He is posing for the camera but looking away slightly from it. An autograph of the subject is also seen in the middle of the picture. Before the 1925 New York Yankees season, Babe Ruth collapsed at a train station in Asheville, North Carolina. Krichell's actions may have saved Ruth's life. On the instructions of Huggins, Krichell drove Ruth to hospital, before traveling with Ruth by train to New York, where Ruth had emergency surgery for an \\"intestinal abscess\\" that left him hospitalized for six weeks. The same year, Krichell went to Hartford, Connecticut to sign shortstop Leo Durocher for a $7,500 bonus ($ in 2010). When the deal was concluded, Barrow sent Krichell to Salt Lake City to watch young second baseman Tony Lazzeri, who played for the Salt Lake Bees of the Pacific Coast League and hit 60 home runs and achieved over 200 RBIs the previous season.Frommer, p. 49 The Bees were asking for $50,000 ($ in 2010), but several scouts placed his value ten times lower. The Chicago Cubs were given the option to sign him for a discounted rate, but declined because he had epilepsy. Krichell saw promise in the player and convinced Barrow to buy him. Around the same time, he helped acquire shortstop Mark Koenig from the Minneapolis Millers.Gallagher, p. 123 These Krichell signings formed part of the 1927 New York Yankees team, considered by many to be the greatest team ever assembled.Gallagher, p. 5 Four of the starters in this squad were signed by Krichell, including three-quarters of its infield and Mike Gazella, its main backup, who signed for $500 in 1923 ($ in 2010).Frommer, p. 56 The Yankees took just four games to defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates and win the 1927 World Series. To assist at practice for the 1927 season, Krichell signed Billy Werber from Duke University. He left the team after a month, but re-signed after graduating in 1930. During that time, Krichell was involved in what is considered one of the worst deals from the era. Barrow asked him to travel to Durham, North Carolina to negotiate with the Durham Bulls for an outfielder named Dusty Cooke. Neither Krichell nor Barrow had seen Cooke; he was believed to be a great hitter, even though he had hardly played for the Bulls. The Yankees signed him for $15,000 ($ in 2010), beating the Cleveland Indians' offer of $12,500 ($ in 2010) and an unnamed player in exchange. Cooke turned out to be an injury-prone backup outfielder, and the Yankees gave up on both Cooke and Werber. After the 1933 season, the two were traded to the Boston Red Sox for cash considerations. In the summer of 1929, Krichell discovered Hank Greenberg while on a scouting trip in Massachusetts. Krichell believed Greenberg would be the next Lou Gehrig.Eig, p. 133 Krichell offered Greenberg a $10,000 contract ($ in 2010) on the spot based on his potential and knowing the Yankees were looking for Jewish players to increase their Jewish fanbase. Greenberg discussed the deal with his father but declined it because he knew his opportunities would be limited by the presence of Gehrig as first baseman.Eig, p. 134 Subsequently, he signed with the Detroit Tigers. 1930s In the early 1930s, Krichell focused on Ivy League pitchers, saying he preferred signing pitchers who could think. From Harvard University, he signed Charlie Devens later saying he could have been great had he continued to play baseball, and from Yale University, he scouted pitcher Johnny Broaca who seemed to be heading for stardom after winning 12 games in his first three seasons with the Yankees, but suddenly retired to become a professional boxer.Gallagher, p. 38 In 1935, a local scout who worked with Krichell placed Long Island University pitcher Marius Russo in a semi- professional team.Madden, p. 27 When Krichell deemed Russo ready, he signed with the Yankees for $750, twice becoming a 14-game winner and being an All- Star in 1941 before injuring his arm. Other Krichell signings from this period included Johnny Murphy, Hank Borowy and Johnny Allen. Murphy, a relief pitcher and four time saves leader, was signed while still in high school in the Bronx and at Krichell's behest, the Yankees followed Murphy's education at Fordham University, where he gained baseball experience. Krichell signed Borowy from Fordham University for $8,500 and the player later became the ace for the Yankees during the wartime era. Krichell supposedly discovered Allen by a chance encounter when Allen worked as a desk clerk at a Sanford hotel. The story said he recognized Krichell as a scout, told him that he was a pitcher, and that he wanted to try out. Krichell agreed, and impressed by Allen's ability, signed him to a minor league contract. However, in an interview with J. G. Taylor Spink of The Sporting News, Krichell said while he signed Allen, he did not discover him. Aside from his Ivy League pitcher focus, Krichell also unearthed several position players. He signed Charlie Keller, a highly touted prospect playing for the University of Maryland. To encourage Keller to sign, Krichell met and had dinner with his family. In 1937, Krichell signed shortstop Phil Rizzuto, who had tried out with the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, but was dismissed by them on the grounds that he was too small.Gallagher, p. 342 Even so, Krichell decided to look at the infielder and was impressed by the way Rizzuto accomplished double plays; his technique reminded Krichell of Leo Durocher, one of his favorite players. He signed Rizzuto for $75 a month and sent him to the Yankees' farm club in Bassett, Virginia.Madden, p. 4 1940s‚Äì1950s Krichell's next target was second baseman Snuffy Stirnweiss from the University of North Carolina. He initially tried to convince him to bypass football for baseball, but the player refused until his father's death soon after his college graduation altered his priorities, leaving him as the sole supporter of his mother and younger brother. Krichell signed him to a contract soon afterwards. In a mass tryout for the Yankees team, Krichell scouted first baseman Whitey Ford. Krichell realised Ford had a strong arm, and recommended he tried pitching. Developing an effective fast curveball, Ford helped his team win the New York City sandlot ball championship, and was signed by Krichell for $7,000 in 1947 ($ in 2010). Ford later became a Hall of Famer and an ace of the Yankees for most of the 1950s and 1960s. Krichell played a factor in signing future All-Star Tommy Byrne.Staples, p. 45 He was referred by one of his scouts, Gene McCann, to see Byrne pitch for Wake Forest University. Impressed with what he saw, Krichell signed him for $10,000 ($ in 2010).Staples, p. 46 He also signed Red Rolfe and Vic Raschi. Krichell oversaw the expansion of the New York Yankees scouting staff from two men to more than twenty part-time scouts by 1957. Among the scouts he hired for the Yankees were former players Babe Herman, Atley Donald, Jake Flowers and Johnny Neun. As he hired more scouts, Krichell reduced his own role, becoming the chief scout and regional scout for the New England area. Paul Krichell in 1957. In 1948, Krichell was involved in a minor scandal. Harry Nicolas was a high school baseball star in Long Island. The Yankees sent Krichell to scout him and offered him a contract with a blank check, being willing pay up to $20,000 for his services. As Nicolas was still in high school, the Yankees were fined $500 by Happy Chandler, the Commissioner of Baseball. Nicolas never reached the Majors. However, Krichell's recommendation of Casey Stengel for manager of the Yankees in 1948 was instrumental in their front office hiring him. Final days In 1954, Krichell was honored by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) with the William J. Slocum Memorial Award. Named after the former head sportswriter of the New York Journal American and president of the BBWAA, the award honored his longevity in baseball. The final players Krichell signed were two bonus babies: infielder Tom Carroll from Notre Dame University and Frank Leja, an 18-year-old first baseman. Krichell advised the Yankees staff to sign Carroll for $30,000 ($ in 2010) and he thought Leja could be the next Gehrig, but both flopped.Gallagher, p. 250 By the time he retired, he was the most experienced employee still working for the Yankees. Krichell died on June 4, 1957 at his home in the Bronx after a lengthy illness. He had surgery for Crohn's disease in 1955 after losing 60 pounds in 60 days. His wife of 50 years, Mary, died earlier in the year. He had one daughter, Caroline, and four grandchildren at the time of his death. Scouting style When he first started his scouting career, Krichell followed the example of early baseball scouts. He traveled with the Yankees for spring training to view his signees playing baseball. When the Yankees traveled north to begin their season, Krichell usually followed. He also scouted the local newspapers to look for games in which potential prospects were playing. Later, his style of scouting was used as a blueprint by scouts to evaluate players. He usually ignored the obvious tools such as ability to hit, size, speed, and human power, saying that \\"any dope\\" could see it. When he scouted a prospect, his top priority was checking that the subject could handle the pressure of playing Major League Baseball.Voigt, p. 177 When he got word of a promising player, he went to see him play. If Krichell liked what he saw, he discussed the player's goals and motivation with him and his family. He decided whether the player was ready for the Yankees or one of their farm teams to use. He tended to take a risk with players passed by other teams.Berger, p. 99 He discounted some of a player's weaknesses if their remaining skills were up to par, for example with Tony Lazzeri, who was a poor fielder. Krichell also was one of the first to notice that intelligence mattered in a game filled with uneducated people. Most of his signings were college graduates who Krichell believed could take advantage of their ability to think.Graham, p. 141 At other times, Krichell collected some of the best prospects in an area, normally 300 or more, and put them through a four-day workout. It normally consisted of practice in the morning and a full game in the afternoon.Madden, p. 5 There, Krichell and his staff sorted through players they believed could become useful in the organization, and dropped those they thought lacked motivation. The few players who survived the workout were assigned by Krichell to the Yankees Minor League hierarchy. Legacy Krichell is considered one of the greatest scouts in baseball history.Tranchtenburg, p. 175 Birdie Tebbetts, a member of the Veterans Committee in the 1980s, led a campaign to have Krichell, along with fellow scouts Charlie Barrett and Hugh Alexander, inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Under Hall of Fame rules, scouts are not eligible for induction. Tibbets appealed to the Hall of Fame Board of Directors every year from 1981 to 1986 to make the three scouts members of the Hall of Fame, but with no success. In The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, James awards the sarcastically-named \\"Paul Krichell Talent Scout Award\\" to an example of a team that has a good chance of signing a player who later becomes a star, who they end up passing on as the result of poor scouting.James (2003), p. 256 Notes Bibliography     * External links Category:1882 births Category:1957 deaths Category:Baseball players from New York (state) Category:French emigrants to the United States Category:Major League Baseball scouts Category:Boston Red Sox scouts Category:New York Yankees scouts Category:St. Louis Browns players Category:Major League Baseball catchers Category:Hartford Senators players Category:Newark Sailors players Category:Newark Indians players Category:Montreal Royals players Category:Kansas City Blues (baseball) players Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players Category:Toronto Maple Leafs (International League) players Category:Richmond Climbers players Category:Bridgeport Americans players ","title":"Paul Krichell"},{"id":"26066418","text":"Fquih Ben Salah or Fkih Ben Saleh (Berber: Fqih Ben ·π¢ale·∏•, ‚¥º‚µá‚µâ‚µÄ ‚¥±‚¥ª‚µè ‚µö‚¥∞‚µç‚¥ª‚µÉ) is a medium city in Morocco, located in the region of B√©ni Mellal-Kh√©nifra, in the historical region of Tadla.

Being Khan's only directorial venture without Shah Rukh Khan, the film stars Akshay Kumar, Katrina Kaif and Akshaye Khanna in the lead roles. Salman Khan and Anil Kapoor make special appearances in the film. The film was released on 24 September 2010, and is today primarily remembered for Kaif's dance number, Sheila Ki Jawani. The theatrical trailer and title song of the film were released on UTV Motion Pictures' YouTube channel on 4 August 2010 for promotional purposes. The trailer was premiered in theatres with Vipul Amrutlal Shah's romantic comedy Action Replayy, also starring Kumar, and Rohit Shetty's action comedy Golmaal 3 on 5 November 2010. The film, written by Kunder and his brother Ashmith, is an official remake of Vittorio De Sica's 1966 Italian film After the Fox .  Derivation of the word  During the olden days, the title of Tees Maar Khan actually refers to the 6th Nizam - Mir Mahbub Ali Khan, who during his time had killed 33 Tigers and was popularly referred to as \\"Tees Maar Khan\\". Tees Maar Khan revolves around the titular character, the conman Tees Maar Khan a.k.a. TMK, who is an international criminal and has been a thief ever since birth. Plot Commissioner Khadak Singh (Sachin Khedekar) is addressing an assembly of police officers, among whom is his junior accomplice, Inspector Jagtap (Vijay Patkar), over an occasion to celebrate the recovery of antique artifacts. Singh has his suspicion set on the Johri brothers, two Siamese twins, who have been in the eyes of the Interpol. However, as he explains, while Singh has the responsibility of transporting these artifacts to Delhi without any interruptions, he is clear that the Johri brothers will desperately find a way out, but each of the possible talented con artists and thieves they might choose has been ruled out through Singh's efforts, and at that moment, he receives and spreads word that the third and final con artist, wanted criminal Tabrez Mirza Khan a.k.a. Tees Maar Khan a.k.a. TMK (Akshay Kumar), has been arrested at an airport in Paris, and is being brought to India. While in the process of being deported back to India for him to be produced before the police and ultimately be sent to prison, Tabrez, completely handcuffed, is picked up by CBI officers Chatterjee (Aman Verma) and Mukherjee (Murli Sharma), who warn him that he won't be able to escape from prison a 26th time around, but he laughs it off, claiming that he will go home and not to prison. Aboard the flight is aviation minister Pankaj Shukla's daughter Malavika (Mia Uyeda), who gets into an argument with one of the flight attendants over the issue of her pet, Penny. The chief pilot tries to intervene but fails to settle the friction between the two. Tabrez uses this to his advantage by first jacking the cockpit on the pretext of using the washroom and later pushing an asleep Chatterjee's leg out of seat, which results in the attendant unwittingly losing control and spilling a drink over Penny, causing Malavika to burst into anger, while the pilots come out to resolve the dispute, and discover, to the horror of both themselves and unwittingly the passengers as well, that the flight has been left in autopilot mode, and since the door is jammed, the flight could possibly crash land. The ensuing commotion results in a middle-aged woman aboard the flight seeking out Chatterjee and Mukherjee for help, but in the officers' audacity to refuse, Chatterjee ends up unwittingly exclaiming loudly that Tabrez can open the lock. However, when Tabrez initially rebuffs the requests of the passengers, they, in all ire, free Tabrez from the two officers, and he, in turn, manages to open the cockpit for the pilots, thereby becoming a hero in the eyes of the passengers and is able to trick the police by poising, all dressed up, as a rich man. Shortly after he relays this entire episode to his sidekicks Burger (Ali Asgar), Dollar (Dharampal) and Soda (Vijay Maurya), who have come to pick him up at the airport, Tabrez drives away and expresses his desire to go home and meet his mother and his girlfriend Anya Khan, but Burger reveals that Anya isn't at home and has been shooting for a film titled \\"Sheila Ki Jawani\\". Tabrez, visibly irked, decides to hijack the film's shooting, and in the process, smashes the director on his head and drags her home. Anya protests, nearly exposing Tabrez in front of his mother, who is under the impression that he is a renowned film director himself. Chatterjee and Mukherjee appear at his house, but are thrown out by his mother and Anya. Tabrez next makes a deal with the Johri brothers to hijack the train with the help of a few unwitting villagers, who he is supposed to trick into doing so and smuggling the goods into a truck for the brothers, by posing as an international film director. During one of the two meetings in which this is finalized, well known superstar Aatish Kapoor (Akshaye Khanna) arrives as a guest of honour at the local dandiya event where Tabrez and the Johri brothers are randomly chosen for the prize, but they are spotted by Chatterjee and Mukherjee and instead decide to flee by creating commotion, causing Aatish to storm out in anger. Tabrez finds that Aatish enjoys police protection and relays this information to the Johri brothers, who decide that they will be the producers. Tabrez, Dollar, Burger and Soda manage to steal equipment from a film set where actor Chunky Pandey is shooting, and land up in a village called Dhulia, where the chief, Nana Ghanpule (Anjan Srivastav) and his blind associate, Subedaar (Avtar Gill) welcome him. Realizing that the train passes through the only track in Dhulia, Tabrez settles on the idea of directing his film there, and, posing as international director Manoj \\"Day\\" Ramalin (Akshay Kumar) the fair complexioned brother of award-winning director Manoj \\"Night\\" Ramalin, approaches Aatish, who agrees to the \\"Oscar-winning\\" project, despite the suspicions of his manager Bunty Baweja (Sudhir Pandey). Tabrez comes up with the idea of a film centred in the pre-independence era, where Aatish would play a revolutionary, and Anya would play \\"Razia Sultana\\", and both of them would protest against Britishers. Midway through, the negatives run out, and one of Nana's associates (Shashi Kiran) overhears this, deciding to raise a few 5-6 lakhs of rupees for Tabrez and team. At night, since they have the keys to the local bank, Tabrez, Burger, Dollar and Soda decide to rob the bank, but even as the villagers \\"mistakenly\\" assume them to be robbers, their escape and attempts to dodge a ghost-figure leads both the gang of thieves and the villagers to a hideout deep in the forest where several children who went missing from the village are recovered from a gang of militants, after which the entirety of villagers bows in front of Tabrez, who realizes that he made a grave mistake trying to deceive the villagers. Humbled by their gesture of 5-6 lakh rupees as a means of arranging film equipment, he decides that he will leave behind part of the looted treasure for the villagers, even as he trains the villagers in acting, among whom is the local cop, Inspector Dhurinder (Arya Babbar), as the train has been delayed by a week. With everything set in motion on the day of the hijack, trouble seems to brew with the arrival of Singh, Jagtap, Chatterjee and Mukherjee, even as Tabrez finds his mother joining in after finding out through the unwitting Anya. However, while he succeeds in tying up the four officers and escaping after successfully executing the entire caper, Singh recovers and slaps Dhurinder, informing the stunned villagers that the director who they met is a wanted criminal. Along with his gang, Tabrez meets up with the Johri brothers and declares that he will leave behind a portion of the loot for the villagers, but the rather irked twins fool them and escape. Meanwhile, Dhurinder holds Tabrez at gunpoint until Singh arrives, and the entire village alter assembles with Tabrez against the officers in attendance, with the Judge (Viju Khote) deciding that only the guilt-ridden Tabrez be jailed, but while he misinterprets his sentence as that of 7 years, he is shocked to find that it is instead 60 years. Outside the courtroom, Tabrez instructs Burger, Dollar and Soda to complete the film, titled Bharat Ka Khazana, and release it. At the premiere, he arrives handcuffed, but is found missing and thus escaped after Chatterjee and Mukherjee find Bunty in shackles instead. Singh realizes he has failed and is shocked. Meanwhile, the Johri brothers are stunned to find Tabrez aboard their plane, with Burger, Dollar and Soda revealed to have hijacked it. Finding the twins adamant against his will, Tabrez throws them out with a parachute at their back.

Release Tees Maar Khan premiered in the UK, Fiji and Canada on 22 December 2010. Reception Critical response Anupama Chopra of NDTV wrote, \\"Tees Maar Khan, adapted from After the Fox, by writers Shrish and Ashmit Kunder, is disappointingly limp and insistently low on IQ. The film has little of the effervescence and flair of a typical Farah Khan film\\" giving it 2/5 stars. Aseem Chhabra of Rediff.com, who rated the film 1.5/5, stated, \\"Even at two hours, the film feels like one long and tedious exercise in bad humour. Some people laughed during the screening I attended in New York City. However, most sat with glum faces, in a sense of disbelief ..... How could a talented(..?) person like Khan make such an unfunny film?\\" Behindwoods review board gave the film a two out of five-star rating and quoted \\"So is Tees Maar Khan watchable? Good Question. Very good question. The answer is 'Yes' if you are in the mood to celebrate. But watch it in theatres as the fun is only when there is a crowd laughing along with you. The second half can have you in splits.\\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave a modest rating of 3/5 in his review and said, \\"Farah Khan's brand new outing Tees Maar Khan will make the most absurd, bizarre and wacky cinema of yore pale in comparison. Not just your cell phone, even your brain needs to be put on 'switched off' mode at the commencement of this film.\\" Nikhat Kazmi of the Times of India awarded 2.5/5 stars while commenting, \\"Sadly, Tees Maar Khan begins as a spoof and remains a spoof, till the very end. All the characters end up as mere caricatures and completely fail to build up an emotional quotient in the film.\\" Yahoo! Movies gave the film 1.5/5 stars. Komal Nahta of Koimoi.com gave it a rating of 2/5 and stated, \\"Too much of farcical comedy; lack of emotions; over-the-top characters; unbelievable script ..... Tees Maar Khan is definitely a disappointment, but it will bring back the invested money and a bit more.\\" Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis gave the film 2 stars and remarked, \\"Even Sheila can‚Äôt make Tees Maar Khan watchable ... Though the story is interesting (Neil Simon of After The Fox should ideally get the credit), the writing is so pedestrian and Farah Khan‚Äôs presentation so lacklustre that you wonder how the film was greenlighted at all.\\" Gaurav Malani of The Economic Times gave 2 stars saying, \\"To sum up in Tees Maar Khans trademark style of dialogue delivery, Akshay Kumar se zara hatke comedy expect karna aur Akshaye Khanna se kuch bhi expect karna bekaar hain. Tees Maar Khan doesn‚Äôt even guarantee thirty good laughs in its three-hour runtime.\\" Kaveree Bamzai of India Today rated it 2¬Ω/5 saying, \\"It's an oddly half-hearted film from a woman [Farah Khan] who is never known to do anything in half measure.\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN rated the movie 2/5 suggesting, \\"If you‚Äôre outraged by such low-brow humour, 'Tees Maar Khan' is going to be a long, hard slog for you.\\" Box office India Tees Maar Khan took a 100% opening at most multiplexes across India.

Some key figures of Italian history were largely ignored, including every figure from Ancient Rome.

Life He was son of Dr. John Francis, rector of St. Mary's, Dublin (from which living he was for a time ejected for political reasons), and dean of Lismore, and was born in 1708. He was sent to Trinity College, Dublin, taking the degree of B.A. in 1728, and was ordained, according to his father's wish, in the Church of Ireland. He held for some time the curacy of St. Peter's parish, Dublin, and while resident in that city published his translation of Horace, besides writing in the interests of ‚Äòthe Castle.‚Äô Soon after the death of his wife, Elizabeth Rowe, whom he married in 1739, he crossed to England, and in 1744 obtained the rectory of Skeyton in Norfolk. He shortly was residing for the sake of literature and society in London. In January 1752, when Edward Gibbon became an inmate of his house, Francis was keeping or supposed to be keeping a school at Esher; but the boys' friends quickly found that the nominal instructor preferred the pleasures of London to the instruction of his pupils and in a month or two Gibbon was removed. To maintain himself in the social life of London, Francis tried many expedients, but most of them were failures. Two plays of his were produced on the stage, each time without success. He tried translation, but, except in his rendering of the works of Horace, he was sidelined by other writers. His fortune was made when he secured, through the kindness of Miss Bellamy, who recommended him, the post of private chaplain to Lady Caroline Fox, and lived in her family, where he taught Lady Sarah Lennox to declaim and Charles James Fox to read. At the end of 1757 Fox was sent to Eton, and Francis accompanied him to assist the boy in his studies. The father, Henry Fox found Francis a useful ally. It has sometimes been said that he was the chief writer in the paper called ‚ÄòThe Con-test,‚Äô which lived from November 1756 to August 1757, but the accuracy of this statement is doubted. He is also said to have contributed to the ‚ÄòGazette‚Äô daily newspaper on behalf of the court interest. When William Pitt the Elder resigned, in 1761, Francis wrote a libel against him under the title of ‚ÄòMr. Pitt's Letter Versified,‚Äô the notes to which, according to Horace Walpole, were supplied by Henry Fox (now Lord Holland), and he followed this with ‚ÄòA Letter from the Anonymous Author of ‚ÄúMr. Pitt's Letter Versified,‚Äù‚Äô in which he reflected on Pitt's indifference to the truculent language of Colonel Isaac Barr√©. In 1764 he attacked Pitt and John Wilkes with great bitterness in the ‚ÄòPolitical Theatre.‚Äô On 22 June 1761 he was inducted to the vicarage of Chilham in Kent, but resigned in the summer of 1762, and through Lord Holland's influence he held from May 1764 to 1768 the chaplaincy at Chelsea Hospital, and the rectory of Barrow, Suffolk, to which he was instituted on 26 February 1762, and which he retained until his death. He was also recommended in January 1764 by George Grenville for a crown pension. Francis was still unsatisfied. He quarrelled with Lord Holland because he had not been made an Irish bishop, and threatened to expose his patron's villainy. In June 1771 he was seized by a paralytic stroke, and after lingering for some years died at Bath 5 March 1773. He was fond of his son Sir Philip Francis, and numerous letters to and from him are in the son's memoir; he resented his son's marriage, but they were later reconciled. Works Of his rendering of Horace, Samuel Johnson said: ‚ÄòThe lyrical part of Horace never can be perfectly translated. Francis has done it the best. I'll take his five out of six against them all.‚Äô The first part, consisting of the ‚ÄòOdes, Epodes, and Carmen Seculare of Horace in Latin and English,‚Äô in which he was assisted by William Dunkin, was issued at Dublin in two volumes in 1742. It was republished in London in the next year, and in 1746 two more volumes, containing the ‚ÄòSatires, Epistles, and Art of Poetry,‚Äô appeared with a dedication in prose to Robert Jocelyn, lord chancellor of Ireland. The whole version was reissued in 1747, and it ran into many subsequent editions, that edited by Edward Dubois being the best. It was also included in the set of poets edited by Alexander Chalmers, the ‚ÄòBritish Poets,‚Äô vols. xcvii‚Äìviii., and in Charles Whittingham's ‚ÄòGreek and Roman Poets,‚Äô vol. xii. Francis worked in 1751 on his play of ‚ÄòEugenia,‚Äô an adaptation of the French tragedy of ‚ÄòCenie,‚Äô and it was acted at Drury Lane Theatre on 17 February 1752, but was unsuccessful; Lord Chesterfield attributed its failure to the fact that pit and gallery did not like a tragedy without bloodshed. A similar failure attended his play of ‚ÄòConstantine,‚Äô which was produced at Covent Garden on 23 February 1754, and expired on the fourth night. Genest styles it ‚Äòa cold and uninteresting play, the plot avowedly taken in part from a French piece.‚Äô Both pieces were printed, the former being dedicated to the Countess of Lincoln, and the latter to Lord Chesterfield. For eight years he was employed in studying the ‚ÄòOrations‚Äô of Demosthenes, and his translation appeared in two volumes in 1757‚Äì8, but it was thought inferior to that by Thomas Leland. An anonymous volume by John Taylor was printed in 1813 with the title of A Discovery of the Author of the ‚ÄúLetters of Junius,‚Äù founded on Evidence and Illustrations. It attributed the authorship of the Letters of Junius to Francis and his son, Sir Philip Francis, and claimed that all the peculiarities of language in the writings of the elder Francis are discernible in some parts of Junius. Contemporary scholarly consensus is that the son was the author.

They released two albums, Characters in Time (1988) and Diablero (1992), while active and an archives release, iDefi, dedicated to the memory of Chavez and vocalist David Taylor, in 2017. History Drive formed in Houston, Texas, in the mid-1980s when its members were barely out of high school but the band soon moved to Los Angeles, CA, which had become the center of the hard rock scene. After winning a KNAC radio contest with their song ‚ÄúI Need The Nights‚Äù, Drive landed on the 1987 10 Best From the West compilation released by Rampage Records, the hard rock division of Rhino Records. Rampage signed the band and in July 1988 Drive released their debut album, Characters in Time. The album received good reviews from the industry's hard rock press, including the coveted 5 ‚ÄúK‚Äù rating from Kerrang! Magazine. The album also received airplay from hard rock stations around the country, including KNAC in Los Angeles. Drive would record their sophomore effort, Diablero, for Rampage and advance tapes were circulating at the time but the album's release was put on hold. At the turn of the decade the band left Rampage and signed with Zoo Entertainment, a new BMG label that would later become famous for the band Tool. In 1992, the band released a re-worked version of Diablero to rave reviews from the metal underground. A shake-up at the label along with the dawn of the metal-killing Grunge scene left the album without much of a push and the band's recording career was put on hold as members moved back to Texas where Chavez and Taylor assembled one last Drive line-up featuring bassist Mike Ribiero and drummer Carlos Cervantes before putting things on hold. The break became permanent and Drive would not perform as a band again. On June 25, 2009, while driving along a San Antonio, TX interstate, lead singer David Taylor lost control of his vehicle due to a tire malfunction and crashed. He was airlifted to an area hospital where he died of his injuries five days later. He was 44. Eventually, founding member Rick Chavez was approached by German-American re-issue label 20th Century Music about releasing an album of unreleased material. The release, titled iDefi, surfaced in late 2017 and included \\"Inherit the Wind\\" and \\"Insanity\\" from the unreleased Rampage version of Diablero, alternate Spanish language versions of \\"Once Again\\" (\\"Otra Vez\\") and \\"Pandilla\\", also originally from Diablero, and various demos.

In 1934, he performed at the first National Folk Festival in St. Louis, Missouri. He was musically discovered by folklorist Zora Neale Hurston. She enlisted Alan Lomax, who recorded Brown for the Library of Congress in June 1935. Like Ralph Willis, Alec Seward and Brownie McGhee, Brown then relocated from the South to New York City. Hurston gave Brown a part in her light opera Polk County. In 1935 Brown started a four-year tenure with the Federal Arts Theatre, initially under the direction of Orson Welles. By the late 1930s, Brown performed as a singer on Cincinnati radio and took part in the show St. Louis Woman. He found employment with the civil service, working for the Army Signal Corps in Asbury Park, New Jersey. His first full recording session was in 1943, produced by Joe Davis, and the twosome worked together until Brown's final sessions in 1952. In 1945 Brown sang, \\"I can't have no luck at all, the jinx is on me.\\" Several of Brown's recordings were not released during his lifetime, and some of those that were issued were not promoted tastefully or accurately.

Biography Groenewold was born on 29 June 1910 in Muntendam in the province of Groningen. He graduated from the University of Groningen, with a major in physics and minors in mathematics and mechanics in 1934. After a visit to Cambridge to interact with John von Neumann (1934-5) on the links between classical and quantum mechanics, and a checkered career working with Frits Zernike in Groningen, then Leiden, the Hague, De Bilt, and several addresses in the North of the Netherlands during World War II, he earned his Ph.D. degree in 1946, under the tutelage of L√©on Rosenfeld at Utrecht University. In 1951, he obtained a position in Groningen in theoretical physics, first as a lecturer, then as a senior lecturer, and finally as a professor in 1955. He was the initiator and organizer of the Vosbergen Conference in the Netherlands for over two decades. His 1946 thesis paper H.J. Groenewold (1946), \\"On the Principles of elementary quantum mechanics\\", Physica 12, pp. 405-460. laid the foundations of quantum mechanics in phase space, in unwitting parallel with J. E. Moyal. This treatise was the first to achieve full understanding of the Wigner‚ÄìWeyl transform as an invertible transform, rather than as an unsatisfactory quantization rule. Significantly, this work further formulated and first appreciated the all-important star-product, the cornerstone of this formulation of the theory, ironically often also associated with Moyal's name, even though it is not featured in Moyal's papers and was not fully understood by Moyal. Moreover, Groenewold first understood and demonstrated that the Moyal bracket is isomorphic to the quantum commutator, and thus that the latter cannot be made to faithfully correspond to the Poisson bracket, as had been envisioned by Paul Dirac. This observation and his counterexamples contrasting Poisson brackets to commutators have been generalized and codified to what is now known as the Groenewold ‚Äì Van Hove theorem.See Theorem 13.13 for one version of this result See Groenewold's theorem for one version.

In horse show competition, a wide variety of classes are labeled pleasure classes with judging standards based on the concept that horses or ponies exhibited should be well-mannered and thus a ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù to ride. Pleasure riding is called hacking in British English, and in parts of the eastern United States and Canada. In the United States, particularly the American west, the term trail riding is used to describe recreational pleasure riding, particularly on public lands. Pleasure riding Many horses are suitable for pleasure riding, including grade horses and other animals of ordinary quality and good disposition. Such horses are sometimes called \\"hacks,\\" particularly in areas where pleasure riding is known as hacking. Statistics provided by the American Horse Council (AHC) in a 2005 study indicated that out of 9.2 million horses in the United States, the largest number, 3.9 million, were used for recreation, and this activity directly contributed $11.8 billion, or roughly one-third of the GDP effect of the horse industry. \\"National Economic Impact of the U.S. Horse Industry\\" American Horse Council Later studies reinforce these numbers. A 2008 survey found that pleasure/trail riding was the primary pursuit for 78% of Wisconsin horses and 80% of horse owners.p.4 Tretcher, David, et al. \\"Wisconsin State Horse Council General Population Survey and Horse Owners' Survey Report\\" Similarly, a 2006 study in Virginia found that 48.4% of the horses in that state were used for pleasure riding.Equine Boarding Operations in Northern Virginia, 2008 Survey Results The prevalence of pleasure riding and its economic impact also dispels the misperception that horse ownership is only for the wealthy. The 2005 AHC study also found that approximately 34% of horse owners have an annual household income of less than $50,000, 46% have an income of between $25,000 to $75,000, and 28% have an income of over $100,000. Horse showing ranks second in the AHC study of horse activities, with 2.7 million horses involved. Even in competition, the term \\"pleasure\\" or \\"hack\\" is also applied to a number of horse show classes where the performance of the animals are judged on their manners, performance and way of going, originally to determine a horse's suitability to be a pleasure riding mount.

These surveys had vertical rows of six mile square townships called Ranges. These ranges were numbered from Ellicott‚Äôs Line, the boundary between Ohio and Pennsylvania, also known as the Eastern Ohio Meridian. The townships within each range were surveyed north and south from the baseline called the ‚ÄúGeographer‚Äôs Line‚Äù at 40 degrees 38 minutes north, which runs west from the north bank of the Ohio River where it exits Pennsylvania, at a place now called the Beginning Point of the U.S. Public Land Survey. The townships were not numbered from the baseline, but from south to north beginning with the first partial township in each range formed next to the Ohio River. Thus, townships in adjacent ranges rarely had the same number. This system extended the original numbering plan from the Seven Ranges. There being no east ranges or south townships, plats are designated ‚ÄúTownship X of Range Y of Ohio River Survey‚Äù with no need for north or west designations. Surveys on the Ohio River Base also consist of the Ohio Company and the Seven Ranges. The Seven Ranges were sold in the same manner, and could be considered Congress Lands, but get a special category to itself. Congress Lands West of Miami River The Congress Lands West of Miami River consists of lands between the Great Miami River and Indiana, and south of the Greenville Treaty Line. Ranges are designated as east of the First Principal Meridian which is at the Ohio-Indiana border. Townships are numbered from south to north, with irregularities caused by the course of the Great Miami River. Northwest Ohio Congress Lands in northwest Ohio consist of North and East of the First Principal Meridian and South and East of the First Principal Meridian.

Pinamonte Bonacolsi was appointed one of two rectors of the commune on 12 July 1272, at first for a period of two months, internal strife among the extended kinship groups of the commune having reached excessive violence and murder. Within a few months Pinamonte was able to accuse and exile his co- rector Federico da Marcaria and the podest√†, and gather power into his own hands. A communal reform in 1274 gave him a new position, capitano del popolo, which Pinamonte soon assumed for life.Christopher Kleinhenz, ed. Medieval Italy: an encyclopedia, s.v. \\"Mantua\\". Pinamonte pacified the city by exiling the most troublesome of the families, confiscating their goods, made peace among his neighbors, declared allegiance to the distant Emperor as a Ghibelline city; Mantua entered on a prosperous period. On 29 September 1291, Pinamonte's son, Bardellone, unseated his father in a coup; putatively, Bardellone was co-governor with his father, but nothing further is heard about the father, who died officially unnoticed, 7 October 1293. Bardellone's brother Tagino was exiled to Ferrara, where he formed lasting ties with the Este. Bardellone replaced the commune's consiglio maggiore with a consiglio del signore, 2 July 1294.Kleinhentz Tagino's pardon and return from Ferrara in 1298 began a shift in Mantuan alliance from Verona to the Este in Ferrara, cemented by accords signed in Ferrara, 24 June 1299. Alberto I della Scala, lord of Verona, who favoured Bardellone's nephew Guido Bonacolsi, took immediate action and entered Mantua at the head of troops. Della Scala deposed and exiled Bardellone and Tagino, and installing as ruler of Mantua, Guido Bonalcolsi, who then married Alberto's recently widowed daughter Costanza at the beginning of September. Statute of 1303 made Guido Bonacolsi captain- general of the city and comune of Mantua and gave him unlimited powers, combining the executive, legislative, fiscal and judiciary, to \\"impose bans, absolve and convict... make war, enter truces, concords and peace, acquire friends, contract alliances, receive and rehabilitate exiles,appoint, install, dismiss, acquit and convict the podest√†, rectors, judges, assessors, and all other officials and administrators, grant or remove their salaries,, convene councils and assemblies such that no councils, assemblies or meetings may be held without his special license...\\"Quoted in David Abulafia, Rosamond McKitterick eds. The New Cambridge Medieval History, c. 1198 ‚Äî c. 1300 1999:477. Guido died 24 January 1309, and was succeeded by his brother Rinaldo \\"Passerino\\", who had been an ally of Cangrande I della Scala. The Gonzaga had initially been allies in the Bonalcosi takeover of Mantua, but now allied with the Scaliger family of Verona, rebelled. On 16 August 1328, Rinaldo, the last Bonacolsi, was overthrown in a revolt backed by Ludovico I of the House of Gonzaga. Palazzo Bonacolsi (now Palazzo Castiglioni) that stands in piazza Sordello was commenced by Guido Bonacolsi as the Palazzo del Capitano. It was continued as the Palazzo Ducale by the Gonzaga. A lesser member of the clan, the sculptor Pier Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi (c. 1460‚Äì1528), was nicknamed \\"L'Antico\\" by his contemporaries for his refined interpretation of the Antique.

He is known for his service as the military governor (doux) of Antioch in 996‚Äì998. He fought the Fatimids with some success, until he was killed at the Battle of Apamea on 19 July 998. Biography Damian is the first attested member of the distinguished Dalassenos clan. His early life is unknown, but for genealogical reasons he is estimated to have been born in ca. 940. Nothing is known of him before 995/6, when Emperor Basil II appointed him governor of Antioch in succession to Michael Bourtzes following the latter's defeat in the Battle of the Orontes in September 994. This post was one of the most important military positions in the Byzantine Empire, as its holder commanded the forces arrayed against the Fatimid Caliphate and the semi-autonomous Muslim rulers of Syria. In this capacity, he held the high title of either patrikios (according to John Skylitzes) or magistros (according to Stephen of Taron). Dalassenos maintained an aggressive stance. In 996 his forces raided the environs of Tripoli and Arqa, while Manjutakin, again without success, laid siege to Aleppo and Antartus, which the Byzantines had occupied and refortified the previous year, but was forced to withdraw when Dalassenos with his army came to relieve the fortress. The Fatimid defeat was compounded by the sinking of a Fatimid fleet, that was intended to support Manjutakin's operations, before Antartus. Dalassenos repeated his raids against Tripoli in 997, taking many captives. He also attacked the towns of Rafaniya, Awgh, and al-Lakma, capturing the latter and carrying off its inhabitants into captivity. In June/July 998, he marched his troops to Apamea to seize the city after a catastrophic fire had burned down its provisions. The Aleppines tried to seize the city first, but withdrew at the approach of Dalassenos, who could not permit a vassal to grow too strong. The local Fatimid governor, al-Mala'iti, called for aid, but the relief army under Jaysh ibn Samsama was delayed by having to deal first with suppressing the Byzantine-sponsored rebellion of Tyre. After Tyre had been subdued, Jaysh moved his army to Damascus, whence he proceeded to confront Dalassenos. Ibn al-Qalanisi reports that by this time, Apamea was near surrender due to famine. In the resulting battle, fought on 19 July 998, the Byzantines were initially victorious, but a Kurdish officer managed to kill Dalassenos, whereupon the Byzantine army collapsed and fled. Two of his sons, who accompanied Dalassenos, were taken captive to Cairo, where they remained for ten years, while Stephen of Taron somewhat dubiously reports that one of his sons was killed. Damian Dalassenos was succeeded as doux of Antioch by Nikephoros Ouranos. Family Damian Dalassenos had at least three sons: * Constantine Dalassenos, doux of Antioch in 1025 and a favourite of Emperor Constantine VIII (r. 1025‚Äì1028). * Theophylact Dalassenos, also a doux of Antioch. * Romanos Dalassenos, katepano of Iberia. Theophylact was most likely the father of Adrianos, the maternal grandfather of Anna Dalassene, the mother of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, founder of the Komnenian dynasty.

Crompton was brought up as a hand loom cotton weaver and, at an early age, learned the trade of a machinist. While superintendent of a cotton mill in Ramsbottom he made many experiments on cotton looms. He went to Taunton, Massachusetts, in 1836 and devised a loom for the manufacture of fancy cotton goods, receiving a patent on 23 November 1837 (U.S. Patent 491). In this loom one part of the warp was depressed while the other was lifted, instead of allowing one part to remain stationary, thus securing more room for the passage of the shuttle. Another feature of it was an endless loop pattern chain, which, with its peculiar apparatus, operated the warp. This allowed many more pattern sequences and made them much easier to change. Crompton went back to England in 1838 and, after patenting his loom there, returned with his family to America in 1839. In 1840, he adapted his loom to the weaving of fancy woolens for Middlesex Mills in Lowell, Massachusetts, where he worked for two years. Late in his career, he divided his time between manufacturing cotton and woolen goods in Millbury, Massachusetts, and touring New England teaching operators how to use his looms. Crompton retired from active business in 1849, on account of failing health. His son, George Crompton, continued improving the loom. In 1900, at least three fourths of all the woolen goods made in the United States were woven on the Crompton loom, or on looms embodying its principles.

She is the creation of author Cara Black. She is a Paris-based, modern, female, private investigator. The bestselling mystery series is called Aim√©e Leduc Investigations. Aim√©e Leduc is French, born to an American mother and a French police investigator. Her mother disappeared when she was eight years old. She was raised by her father, who removed all reminders of her mother's existence. She lives in Paris during the 1990s. She attended the famous Sorbonne as a pre-med student, but decided that medicine is not her forte and chose to take over the Leduc Investigation firm after her father's death during a stakeout. She specializes in computer investigation with her partner Rene, her friend from her Sorbonne days. Her adventures take her to areas of Paris unknown to most readers. Each of her stories is grounded in historical reality. She has been described by Booklist as, \\"...a delightfully unbuttoned Audrey Hepburn for the twenty-first century‚Ä¶.‚Äù, but with a punk-rock attitude and in far more dangerous settings. Leduc is a sharp, fashionable, hip, and quite headstrong young woman who has assumed the investigative mantle left to her by her father. During the course of her investigations she often finds a need for disguise or for hacking into computer systems. Aim√©e often puts herself in danger and at times gets injured. In one dramatic scene in Murder in Bastille she was blinded, though later her vision was restored. Wearing Chanel outfits that she has acquired at second-hand shops, Leduc's unconventional attitude can be compared with Sherlock Holmes' \\"Bohemian\\" lifestyle. As do many detectives, she has a satellite-system of oddball side characters. Ren√© Friant, a dwarf and computer expert, is her partner. Commissaire Morbier is her god-father and sometimes helps her on cases or with official leverage. Inspector Melac is her implacable, hardnosed rival on the police force, a kind of Inspector Kramer to Nero Wolfe. The Leduc series often explores in realistic detail her fictional Parisienne community, ambience, and landscape. It is also notable for interweaving complex familial intrigue and emotions into the standard mystery plots. She is always in search of her father's murderer, her vanished mother, and, in the later books, involved with sibling- related subplots. The Aim√©e Leduc Investigation series has been translated into five languages.  Awards  Aim√©e Leduc is included in the Great Women Mystery Writers, by Elizabeth Lindsay.

Built on the site of a house belonging to Richard Russell, a local doctor whose advocacy of sea-bathing and seawater drinking helped to make Brighton fashionable in the 18th century, it has been extended several times, although it experienced a period of rundown and closure in the early 20th century. A fire in 1998 caused serious damage, but the hotel was restored. The Classical- style building is in three parts of different sizes and dates but similar appearances. Large pilasters and columns of various orders feature prominently. Amon Henry Wilds, an important and prolific local architect, took the original commission on behalf of promoter John Colbatch. Another local entrepreneur, Harry Preston, restored the hotel to its former high status after buying it in poor condition. The building took on its present three-wing form in 1963. The original part of the building was listed at Grade II* by English Heritage for its architectural and historical importance, and its western extension is listed separately at the lower Grade II. History Beginnings The site itself is connected with the life and career of Richard Russell, a doctor who advocated sea water as a cure of ailments. After Russell's death in 1759, Old Steine developed as the centre of fashionable life in Brighton. Russell House, as it became known, was used as lodgings for visitors such as the Duke of Cumberland, and later became an entertainment venue with activities such as a puppet theatre, a camera obscura and resident jugglers. In the 1820s, it passed to entrepreneur John Colbatch, who demolished it in 1823. The local authorities tried to arrange for the land to be kept as open space, but negotiations collapsed and Colbatch began planning the construction of a hotel. Construction, success, disrepair The eastern section of 1826 (left) and its adjoining extension of the 1840s (right) Colbatch commissioned young architect Amon Henry Wilds, who began planning the hotel in 1822. Wilds, the son of Amon Wilds and an associate of Charles Busby, had been responsible for many building schemes in Brighton from about 1815, when he and his father moved their architectural practice to Brighton. Schemes already completed by 1822 included King's Road and Brighton Unitarian Church. The hotel was built on a corner site at the point where Old Steine met King's Road, and like Russell House the main fa√ßade faced away from the sea, towards Old Steine. The four-storey structure opened on 5 August 1826. The venture was immediately successful, and a stylistically similar five-storey extension was added to the west in about 1847. At the same time, the name was changed from the Albion Hotel. Six years earlier, one of Brighton's most important cultural establishments was established in a ground- floor room: the Albion Rooms Literary and Scientific Institution combined the functions of library, lecture theatre and museum. The venture eventually became unsustainable, and the institution's members presented the accumulated books, artefacts and pictures to Brighton Corporation, the local authority. This led to the establishment of the Brighton Museum and Art Gallery and Brighton Library in the grounds of the Royal Pavilion. The hotel fell into disrepair in the late 19th century, and was closed in 1900. Harry Preston, owner of the nearby Royal York Hotel, bought it in 1913 for ¬£13,500 (¬£ in ), and quickly restored its fashionable reputation. The building was completely refurbished, additions were made, and well-known literary figures, artists and entertainers regularly stayed. The extensions carried out around this time, in the Edwardian style typical of the period, included a sea-facing lounge at the rear of the hotel, and were carried out by Brighton architectural firm Clayton & Black. Started in the 1870s by Charles Clayton and Ernest Black and continued by their sons, this firm was one of Brighton's most prolific designers of public buildings and churches over the next 60 years. In 1856, another hotel had been built west of the Royal Albion on land previously occupied by Williams's Royal Hot and Cold Baths, an indoor bath-house. The Lion Mansion Hotel was architecturally similar to the Royal Albion, and rose to four storeys. It was later known as the Adelphi Hotel. In 1963, it was taken over by the Royal Albion, and became physically linked to it as a west wing. Fire On the morning of 24 November 1998, the hotel was devastated by a fire which started in the kitchen. A chef was frying eggs and sausages in a pan; hot fat spilt and caught light, and flames were immediately sucked up a vent to the top floor. The fire spread quickly, assisted by strong winds, and all 160 people in the building were evacuated. The Public and Commercial Services Union had to cancel their annual conference, due to be held that day, because of the disruption caused to its delegates, most of whom were staying at the hotel. About 160 firefighters from all parts of East and West Sussex attended the fire from about 8.20am until late in the evening, in what was later described as Brighton's \\"biggest firefighting operation for nearly 30 years\\". All parts of the hotel were affected by smoke, water and structural damage, but the original corner building was particularly badly affected. Architecture The three parts of the hotel, looking south. From left to right: Amon Henry Wilds's 1826 building; the 1840s extension; and the former Lion Mansions Hotel (partly obscured). In its present form, the Royal Albion Hotel is in three linked sections, all stylistically similar. The original (eastern) wing is four storeys tall and has five extremely large Corinthian and Composite columns on the north face. These are flanked on both sides by large pilasters, which also run all round the east face. The top floor is an attic storey displaying Wilds's characteristic motif: shell designs set in blank rounded tympana. Above this is a mansard roof, now mostly obscured. The centre section, dating from about 1847, has three full storeys and two attic floors above, and is therefore taller. The fa√ßade has three bays. The theme of large pilasters and columns continues, but different styles are used: the left and right bays project slightly and have paired Tuscan pilasters, and a pair of tapering Ionic columns in the centre bay form a distyle in antis composition. The centre section also has a mansard roof‚Äîapparently a later addition. The western wing (the former Lion Mansions) has a Tuscan-columned porch on the south (seafront) side and a Doric-style equivalent facing north to Old Steine, four Composite pilasters extending for three of the four storeys, small cast-iron balconies and some aedicula-style window surrounds. Present day The Royal Albion Hotel was listed at Grade II* on 13 October 1952. Such buildings are defined as being \\"particularly important ... [and] of more than special interest\\". In February 2001, it was one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. The west wing (the former Lion Mansions) was listed at Grade II on 5 August 1999. In February 2001, it was one of 1,124 buildings listed at that grade in Brighton and Hove; the status indicates that the building is considered \\"nationally important and of special interest\\". The hotel is operated by Britannia Hotels. There are 208 guest rooms, one restaurant, two bars and five rooms for conferences and meetings. Bedrooms are classified in four grades, from standard to deluxe. It has a 3-star rating. Historical sketches and hotel guests The Albion was subject of a sketch by painter J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851) in 1834 during one of his coastal expeditions. By 1847 due to its frequent patronage by a number of distinguished visitors, it had changed its name to the Royal Albion and the Royal coat of arms was duly placed over the entrance. The renowned philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts (1814‚Äì1906), was widely known as ‚Äòthe richest heiress in England‚Äô a friend of Charles Dickens and the Duke of Wellington would regularly spend part of the year in the Royal Albion Hotel with her long-term companion, Hannah Brown. https://clancoutts.ning.com/page/angela-burdett-coutts-1 In 1888 a mysterious death occurred in one of the hotel's bedrooms, which featured in the book ‚ÄòThe Strange Case of Edmund Gurney‚Äô. Gurney had been a frequent visitor to Brighton and arrived at the hotel in June, and that evening dined alone and retired early. By two o‚Äôclock the following day he had not responded to repeated knocking. The books explores the speculation, was it an overdose or was he murdered? In February 1894 Oscar Wilde (1854-1900) stayed in a room overlooking the sea whilst working on his Poems in Prose (Wilde collection) the collective title of six prose poems published in July that year in The Fortnightly Review. In 1906, Harry Preston (1860-1936)http://www.thepostmagazine.co.uk/brightonhistory/brightons-most- famous-ambassador-sportsman-and-philanthropist-sir-harry-preston a fifty-year- old charismatic local figure in Brighton, a friend of the Prince of Wales, had bought the hotel and four years later he carried out large scale alterations creating a roof garden which overlooked the Palace Pier. In the new refurbished hotel Arnold Bennett (1867-1931) began writing part of his Clayhanger trilogy The Clayhanger Family while staying there in 1910. The same year Frenchman Andre Beaumont Jean Louis Conneau (1880-1937) in his Bl√©riot monoplane flew around the skies of Brighton, taking Preston as a passenger. Afterwards he hosted a banquet at the Royal Albion Hotel to celebrate the event. Harry a former publican, had entered the hotel business around the turn of the century. Preston had a wonderful feel for publicity, and he wined and dined the editors of the London newspapers, encouraging them to promote the town and his new hotel to visitors, especially motorists. It started to be referred to as London-by-sea. Harry‚Äôs wife Ellen died in 1913 and a year later he married Edith Collings, the Royal Albion‚Äôs manageress. Maud Coleno‚Äôs Daughter the Life of Dorothy Hartman 1898-1957, John Dann, Matador, 2017 , p81-82 Harry was knighted for his services to charitable causes in 1933, and his wife, Edith, was presented at Court the following year. In the spring of 1919, the hotel entertained three aristocratic guests - two of whom signed the hotel‚Äôs register as Sir David (1879-1932) and 'Lady Dorothy' Dalrymple of Newhailes House. Away from the prying eyes of friends in London, the party loving pair were enjoying an affair, but unknown to them both, followed by an enquiry agent employed by Margaret, the ‚Äòreal‚Äô Lady Dalrymple, resulting in a divorce.

She was the daughter of Gilbert Sackville, 8th Earl De La Warr, who had earned the nickname ‚ÄòNaughty Gilbert‚Äô after running away with a French ‚ÄòCan-Can‚Äô dancer. She inherited her father‚Äôs hedonistic spirit and would scandalise a generation. Over the coming decades she would marry five times and became immortalised as ‚ÄòThe Bolter‚Äô by novelist Nancy Mitford.

It features a young man saving the Earth from an interstellar fast food chain through a time loop. The game was developed using M4, Sanctuary Woods' title for the MicroProse Adventure Development System. It was the company's second and final title not made for children, after The Riddle of Master Lu. Plot and gameplay Orion Burger is vexed. Environmentalist pressure is threatening the company's pretense that it only uses unintelligent raw materials, forcing it to abduct pet shop assistant Wilbur Wafflemeier and test him for sentience before scouring his planet clean. The company is still brazen enough to rig the tests. Wilbur fails miserably. He is supposed to be returned to the moment he left and remember nothing, but the teleporter fails even worse. Wilbur arrives intact to a time one hour before his abduction, and can now cheat back. Gameplay consists of wandering around Wilbur's hometown of Boonsville, solving puzzles to gather gear and information for the aliens' five tests. Wilbur is abducted at regular intervals, tested, and returned to Boonsville through the failing teleporter for another iteration of the loop. Going back in time resets the town and empties Wilbur's inventory, but after Wilbur passes a test, he'll automatically (and instantly) prepare for it on all subsequent iterations. Some tests are puzzles themselves, others merely cutscenes. Events happen at specific times, allowing Wilbur to take advantage of his foreknowledge. The player can also opt to skip straight to the abduction or give up on a test. Due to the time-loop gameplay mechanic, the game cannot be lost or rendered unwinnable. Design Orion Burger has a mouse-driven interface with the commands \\"take,\\" \\"use,\\" and \\"talk.\\" It features full voice-acting, which its Pelit review complimented, but which MikroBitti insulted. It also uses a variety of ambient background noises, but very little music. Reception The Finnish gaming magazine Pelit gave the game a full-length review; reviewer Tapio Salminen awarded it a score of 92%. Salminen praised its audiovisual design, its humor, a cheerful, laid-back atmosphere that makes it pleasant to play (the threat of planetary genocide notwithstanding), and in particular its puzzles. He noted that \\"certain parties\\" (jotkut tahot) considered the game ruined by the periodic abductions, but that he found the time limits to be plentiful. The Finnish general computing magazine MikroBitti savaged the game, awarding it 67%. According to the review, Orion Burger did have \\"all the usual features of an adventure game, well executed\\" (Kaikki seikkailupelin tavanomaiset piirteet l√∂ytyv√§t hyvin toteutettuina), and its graphics, animation, and smooth interface were particularly pleasant. The review went on to describe the time limit as a fiendish device which caused all three test players to lose interest by the time they passed the first test, and which forces the player to endure unbearable amounts of blather without the chance to meaningfully affect the game.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on February 4, 2010. In the episode, the Parks and Recreation Department hosts a public forum to discuss a sponsorship agreement with local candy manufacturer, Sweetums. Leslie and Ann warn the public of the dangers of supposedly nutritious snack bars called \\"Nutriyums\\", which are filled with simple sugars, notably high fructose corn syrup. The episode was written by Alan Yang and directed by Dean Holland. \\"Sweetums\\" addressed several issues including the politics of corporate sponsorship, the use of propaganda and free gifts to manipulate public opinion, and the dangers of corn syrup-related products, which are regularly available in vending machines at public places, such as schools, parks or municipal buildings. The episode featured a guest performance by Justin Theroux as Leslie's boyfriend, Justin Anderson. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Sweetums\\" was seen by 4.87 million households, and drew the season's highest rating among viewers aged between 18 and 49. The episode received positive reviews from critics. Plot The Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department considers a potential sponsorship deal with Sweetums, a local candy manufacturer hoping to market \\"nutritious\\" snack bars to park visitors. Ron (Nick Offerman) supports the deal as he advocates governmental privatization and emphasizes consumer choice over public safety. Leslie (Amy Poehler) initially supports the deal as well, until Ann (Rashida Jones) informs her they are filled with unhealthy corn syrup. Leslie arranges a public forum for Pawnee park visitors so they can make an informed choice about Sweetums products. Ron is unhappy with the arrangement, and gets angry with Leslie worrying about how much he is drinking during a recent outing, feeling she is stifling his personal freedoms. During the forum, Sweetums representatives screen propaganda films, highlighting consumer satisfaction, while Leslie responds by screening a 30-year-old Sweetums film which discusses how corn syrup and other snack bar ingredients make cattle unhealthy. At the end of Leslie's screening, Sweetums brings in its commercial's primary actor, the company's CEO Nick Newport Jr. (Gary Weeks) and his son and daughter, Denver and Dakota. Denver instructs the forum audience members to look under their seats for candy. The forum audience exclaims with excitement and ultimately votes in favor of the sponsorship deal. Ron taunts Leslie by eating two unhealthful servings of steak (\\"turf and turf\\"), but she remains genuinely concerned for his health. Ron later apologizes to Leslie for having \\"been a horse's ass\\". For the B-plot, Tom (Aziz Ansari) attempts to move out of his home after his divorce from Wendy (Jama Williamson). Tom again hesitates to reveal his feelings for his ex-wife, whom he married to protect from deportation. Mark (Paul Schneider) reluctantly helps Tom through the moving process as he is a truck owner and could not think of a \\"valid excuse\\". Donna (Retta), April (Aubrey Plaza), Jerry (Jim O'Heir) and Andy (Chris Pratt) join to assist Tom move his many boxes to his new home, while Tom himself works very little. At the end of the episode, Tom learns that his new home has a gas leak and that he is unable to move into his new home until Monday. Tom asks the department members to take the boxes into their own homes, but they ultimately bring his possessions and leave them in the Parks and Recreation Department office. Throughout the move, April continues to develop romantic feelings for Andy, who remains oblivious to her affections. When April's boyfriend Derek (Blake Lee) and his gay boyfriend Ben (Josh Duvendeck) arrive at Wendy's house, they mock Andy, which prompts April to refer to their behavior as \\"really gay for a gay couple.\\" In their final appearance in the episode, Andy asks April to watch him roller-blade after work, but April declines his offer, implying that the comments of her boyfriend and his boyfriend may have confounded her feelings towards Andy. Production \\"Sweetums\\" was written by Alan Yang and directed by Dean Holland. The episode addresses the supposed dangers of corn syrup-related products, which are regularly available in vending machines at public places, such as schools, parks or municipal buildings. The issue has been the subject of several town meetings like those featured in the episode, and companies use propaganda videos similar to that used by Sweetums in the episode. \\"Sweetums\\" featured one of a string of slated guest appearances by Justin Theroux as Justin Anderson, a love interest for Leslie, although Theroux only appeared in the cold open scene of \\"Sweetums\\". In one scene, Ron builds a wooden harp to prove to Leslie what he is capable of doing while drinking alcohol. This element of Ron's character was inspired by actor Nick Offerman, who in addition to comedy runs an independent carpentry business called Offerman Woodshop. Michael Schur, co-creator of Parks and Recreation, said he planned to incorporate it into Ron's character soon after learning about Offerman's carpentry skills. A Sweetums stand is visible during a scene in the future Parks and Recreation episode \\"Park Safety\\", a reference to the outcome of the \\"Sweetums\\" episode. Cultural references During one scene, Leslie visits the library and is treated in a hostile manner by the librarian. This is a reference to the previous second season episode, \\"Ron and Tammy\\", which established a long- standing feud between the Pawnee parks and recreation department and the town's library system. Ron commented that all government should be privatized and parks should be run by Chuck E. Cheese's, a chain of family entertainment centers. This is a reference to the Parks and Recreation pilot episode, in which Ron said all government should be privatized and follow the Chuck E. Cheese business model. Tom creates what he describes as a moving robot that plays music called \\"DJ Roomba\\" by attaching an iPod music player to a Roomba, an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner. After Jerry accidentally steps on DJ Roomba, Tom and April arrange for the \\"ghost\\" of DJ Roomba to follow Jerry around the Pawnee town hall playing an infinite loop of music by the hip hop band The Black Eyed Peas. After expressing excitement that he got DJ Roomba to play music by Dave Matthews Band, Andy sings the line, \\"Little baby\\" from the band's song, \\"So Much to Say\\". During one scene, Andy is impressed with Tom's Canadian DVD version of the 1999 thriller, Deep Blue Sea. Tom says the disc includes 22 extra minutes and a commentary track in which actor LL Cool J, who appears in the film, raps all his dialogue. Leslie tells Ron she had already written a eulogy for him and it starts, \\"Oh captain, my captain! Ron Swanson: a swan song\\", a reference to the Walt Whitman poem \\"O Captain! My Captain!\\". While Tom is trying on various articles of party clothes, Leslie comments that he looks like Encyclopedia Brown, a young detective from a series of Donald J. Sobol children's novels. Reception In its original American NBC broadcast on February 4, 2010, \\"Sweetums\\" was seen by 4.87 million households, according to Nielsen Media Research. It marked a 15 percent increase over the previous week's episode, \\"Leslie's House\\". \\"Sweetums\\" drew a 2.3 rating/6 share among viewers between 18 and 49, which was the highest rating of its kind for a second season episode at the time, although the season premiere episode \\"Pawnee Zoo\\" drew a slightly larger viewership of about 5 million households. During its original broadcast, \\"Sweetums\\" ranked third in its 8:30 p.m., behind Bones on Fox, which drew 12.64 million household viewers, and Survivor on CBS, which drew 8.39 million households. \\"Sweetums\\" received generally positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN called it a \\"fantastic episode\\", and called the world of Parks and Recreation rich, lively and \\"a beautiful mosaic\\". Fowler praised individual comedic moments, like the DJ Roomba jokes and portrayal of the easily fooled Pawnee citizens, as well as the development of storylines like that of Tom and Wendy, and Andy and April. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club praised the episode for revealing more about the mythology of the town of Pawnee, such as the strong influence Sweetums holds over the residents, and the ongoing feud between the parks department and the library. He also praised the character development of characters like Tom and April, adding, \\"It's amazing to me how in such a short time, Parks & Rec has taken the most one-note characters and made them truly three-dimensional.\\" The Star- Ledger television columnist Alan Sepinwall declared \\"Sweetums\\" one of the episodes he would suggest to newcomers seeking to become familiar with Parks and Recreation. Sepinwall enjoyed the main story with Leslie and Ron, which he said \\"returned to a goldmine for the series: the civil servants having to deal with the insane questions and complaints from their constituents\\". He also felt Tom's subplot was impressive because it made him feel sympathy for Tom due to his problems with Wendy, despite the fact that Tom was being so inconsiderate to his friends. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly particularly praised Aziz Ansari and Ron Swanson, as well as the moving subplot, which she said spotlighted the show's impressive supporting cast. Gonzalez felt the main plot \\"fell a little flat\\", but was helped by the conflict between Leslie and Ron. Steve Kandell of New York magazine praised the episode, and said the script keeps the characters grounded without making them into caricatures. DVD release \\"Sweetums\\", along with the other 23 second-season episodes of Parks and Recreation, was released on a four-disc DVD set in the United States on November 30, 2010. The DVD included deleted scenes for each episode.

He was Consul General of France to the United States before the French Revolution. During the First French Empire he was Ambassador in Madrid. He was briefly Minister of Foreign Affairs during the transitional government after the fall of Napoleon in 1814, and in 1815, after second abdication of Napoleon, a plenipotentiary to the Seventh Coalition powers. Early years Antoine Ren√© Charles Mathurin was born in Aire-sur-la- Lys, Pas-de-Calais, on 8 August 1756. In 1772 he was a sub-lieutenant in the Hainault regiment. He soon abandoned his military career to enter the diplomatic service. He joined the department of Foreign Affairs as a junior officer on 14 December 1774. In 1779 he was named secretary to the French legation in the United States, then vice-consul at Savannah, Philadelphia and New York. He was made Consul-General of France in the United States in 1788. As a consul Lafor√™t authored reports analyzing the U.S. Constitution and the likelihood of its ratification. During this time, Mathurin acquired large tracts of land in Virginia, which he converted into a plantation. He also befriended political exile and fellow French nobleman Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord, collaborating with him in various business ventures. Talleyrand later played a significant role in Laforest's career advancement. Mathurin returned to France in September 1793 and became assistant to Jean Antoine Joseph Fauchet, Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States. They were dismissed on 5 November year III, but the next year on 17 July 1797 Talleyrand, head of the department of External Relations, put Laforest in charge of finance and accounting. Consulate and Empire During the Consulate Mathurin was Director of Posts. Laforest accompanied Joseph Bonaparte to the Congress of Lun√©ville as first secretary of the legation, then was sent to Munich, and then to the Diet of Ratisbon as charg√© d'affaires extraordinaire. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor on 19 Vend√©miaire year XII. On 1 May 1805 Mathurin was named Minister Plenipotentiary in Berlin, and undertook his duties with honor during the Austerlitz campaign and the start of the war with Prussia. He was leaving for Russia when he received the order to proceed to Madrid as ambassador in 1808. He was created a Count of the Empire on 28 January 1809, as Comte Mathurin de Lafor√™t. He returned to France in 1813 and was given the mission of negotiating with Ferdinand VII of Spain, at Valen√ßay, the treaty that returned that prince to Spain. Soon after he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of la R√©union. Later career On the first Bourbon Restoration Mathurin de Lafor√™t was appointed interim Minister of Foreign Affairs in the provisional government from 3 April to 12 May 1814. He was charged with preparing the Treaty of Paris. As reward for his services he received the Grand Cordon on the Legion of Honor. After the return of Napoleon from Elba during the Hundred Days, on 11 May 1815 he was elected to the Chamber of Representatives for the department of Loir-et-Cher. On the second Bourbon Restoration he was named Minister Plenipotentiary to the Seventh Coalition powers. He was made a Peer of France on 5 March 1819. In 1825 he became a Minister of State and member of the Privy Council. Mathurin lost his position and titles with the July Revolution of 1830. He died at his Ch√¢teau de Freschines, near Villefranc≈ìur, Loir-et-Cher, on 2 August 1846.

The Marksville culture was an archaeological culture in the lower Lower Mississippi valley, Yazoo valley, and Tensas valley areas of present-day Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, and extended eastward along the Gulf Coast to the Mobile Bay area, from 100 BCE to 400 CE. This culture takes its name from the Marksville Prehistoric Indian Site in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana. Marksville Culture was contemporaneous with the Hopewell cultures within present-day Ohio and Illinois. It evolved from the earlier Tchefuncte culture and into the Baytown and Troyville cultures, and later the Coles Creek and Plum Bayou cultures. It is considered ancestral to the historic Natchez and Taensa peoples. Description Hopewell platform stone pipe from Ohio The Hopewell tradition was a widely dispersed set of related populations, which were connected by a common network of trade routes, known as the Hopewell Exchange System. The Marksville culture was a southern manifestation of this network. Settlements were large and usually located on terraces of major streams. Evidence from excavations of burial mounds from this period suggest they were constructed for persons of high social status, and contained refined grave goods of imported exotic materials, such as copper panpipes, earspools, bracelets and beads, rare minerals, stone platform pipes, mica figurines, marine shells, freshwater pearls, and greenstone celts. The pipes had flat bases with a hole for a stem, and a bowl in the center. Animal figurines on the platform are not unusual, with the bowl being located in the animal's back. The high-status leaders organized community life, and officiated at burial ceremonies, an important part of the Marksville Culture. The mounds were constructed in stages over many years, with the first stage being a flat, low platform. The ceremonies may have been held years apart, and those who died between ceremonies were temporarily stored in other locations. Their remains were later gathered up and buried together. The foraging and subsistence practices of the Marksville culture followed the same pattern of the Archaic and Tchefuncte periods. Pottery Although made from local clay, Marksville pottery was similar in design and decoration (particularly the surface design) to pottery found in Illinois and Ohio, which suggests larger interaction networks than had been presupposed. A typical vessel was three to five inches tall and three to seven inches in diameter, and often decorated with geometric and effigy designs, usually stylized birds. The well-formed pottery is also decorated with a shallow incision. This decorated pottery was made primarily for ceremonial uses, with other, plainer utilitarian ware for daily use. Marksville pottery influenced Santa Rosa pottery, a defining characteristic of the contemporary Santa Rosa-Swift Creek culture, located to the east of the Marksville culture area along the Gulf coast. Aside from pottery, the Marksville culture also made jewelries and other artifacts that were usually created as part of the burial ceremony. Chronology The Marksville culture was preceded by the Tchefuncte culture, and was eventually succeeded by the Troyville culture in southeastern and eastern Louisiana and western Mississippi, and the Baytown culture in northeastern Louisiana, northwestern Mississippi, and southeastern Arkansas.

The town falls under the Hantam Local Municipality which forms part of the Namakwa District Municipality. The Calvinia district is part of the Great Karoo region of South Africa. The town is just south of the Hantam mountains on the banks of the Oorlogskloof (meaning \\"War Ravine\\") River. Calvinia enjoys 80% starlight and is renowned for its kaleidoscope of spring wildflowers coinciding with the Namaqualand wildflower spectacle. An asteroid (1245 Calvinia) is named after the town. History The earliest known people living in the area were Khoisan people. The first Europeans in the area were farmers who took their livestock to the area in the 1750s. Farmers grabbed tracts of land in 1813 . On 19 January 1847, at a meeting on the farm Tygerhoek, a new Dutch Reformed Church congregation was founded for the Hantam region. In 1848 the congregation bought 1,200 hectares of the farm Hoogekraal (Ramskop) from Abraham van Wyk. The name Hantam is derived from the Khoisan word !Han=ami, which refers to a plant with edible roots (Pelargonium bifolium, in Afrikaans \\"uintjies\\"). !Han=ami means \\"where the red bulbs grow\\". The first reverend, N.J. Hofmeyr, proposed that the church be named after John Calvin. On 30 October 1851 the town was officially named Calvinia. It became a municipality in 1904. Geography and Climate Calvinia is located at (-31.47500, 19.77278). The town is 301 kilometers (470 kilometers by tar road) north of Cape Town and lies at an altitude of 970 meters. The average summer temperature is 22¬∞C, with peaks above 40¬∞C. The average winter temperature is 10¬∞C but can fall to -8¬∞C. On the surrounding mountains, snow falls regularly. This was where Abraham Esau garnered the support of the \\"Coloured\\" community to fight for the British against the Boers during the Boer War. Culture Afrikaans is the main language spoken in Calvinia. The principal religion of the population is Christianity. Attractions The Calvinia Museum is housed in the former art deco styled Jewish synagogue built in 1920. The museum portrays the lives of the early European settlers. It displays a cedarwood horsemill and mounted Cape fat-tailed, Merino and Dorper sheep. Unusual specimens such as a 4-legged ostrich and genetically anomalous sheep can also be viewed. The Akkerendam Nature Reserve is located three kilometers north of Calvinia. The reserve offers unique flowers and two hiking trails cross the Hantam mountains. The indigenous and rare sterboom (literally translated \\"star tree\\")(Cliffortia arboreais) can be seen here. The Hantam Meat Festival, an agricultural show and great barbecue (Afrikaans \\"braai\\"), takes place every year in late August. The Boekhuis (translated \\"Book House\\") was built in 1860 by Jacobus Nel van der Merwe in Cape Dutch style with a concave-convex gable. This historical T-shaped house in Water Street is made available for the exclusive use of writers. Education The town has four public schools: * Hantam Secondary School * Calvinia High School * Hantam Primary School * Calvinia Primary School All four public schools also have boarding houses for both boys and girls.

Current group members are singer and songwriter founder/member Taloch Jameson, guitarist/vocalist/lyricist Josh Elliott, bassist and vocalist Kayleigh Marchant, drummer Chris Jones; flautist Anja Novotny, and fiddle/violin player Sebastiaan Hidding. Essential non-musician members of the band are lyric contributor and collaborator, Mark Vine; sound engineer Kirsty Kelly, and Marloes Visser, general manager. The majority of the band's songs and music are composed and produced by multi-instrumentalist Jameson. Guitarist Josh Elliott and bassist Kayleigh Marchant have collaborated with Jameson on the most recent albums, contributing lyrics, musical composition and production assistance. History The Dolmen began rather informally in or about 1990, with their first public appearance at The Duke of Albany pub in Weymouth, Dorset, where they debuted as a mainly folk music oriented group. Since that time, they have become well known on the local and surrounding areas music scene, appearing over the years for repeat performances at many major UK music venues and festivals; among them the Glastonbury Festival in 1995 and 1997, the Farnham Jazz and Guilford Festivals, The Children of Artemis Witchfest, and The Pagan Federation festivals. They have also appeared frequently at Stonehenge in support of The Dolmen Grove, a United Paths Pagan organization based in the South of England. In 2007, members of The Dolmen were invited special guests at the first New Seven Wonders of the World ceremonies in Lisbon, Portugal, Jameson's original composition having been chosen as the official anthem of that year's \\"Wonders\\" contest. The Dolmen at the Elf Fantasy Fair in Haarzuilens, Netherlands (2011) In 2011, the band debuted the continental European leg of their \\"Storm Tour\\" with performances at the Elf Fantasy Fair in Haarzuilens, Netherlands. The Dolmen also appeared over the summer of 2011 at the Keltisch Midzomer Festival, Fantastyval Wouwse Plantage, the Sneek Festival; and in September 2011, at the finale of the Highland Games, in Hank, Netherlands. Summer 2012 tours for the band included several festival appearances from June through September at the \\"Mittelalterlich Phantasie Spectaculum\\" in Germany and also in the Netherlands. 2013 saw the inauguration of the band's \\"Nuada God of the Sun\\" tour. In August 2014 the band performed at Castlefest in Lisse, Netherlands. In October 2014 they performed at the Gothic & Fantasy Fair in Rijswijk, Netherlands and in December 2014 they performed at the Midwinter Fair in the Archeon in Alphen aan den Rijn, Netherlands. In 2019, The Dolmen were named \\"Best International Live Band\\", at the Bastaard Fantasy Awards, where they also won \\"Best Album Of The Year\\" for their 2018 album, \\"Wytches and Cunningfolk\\". In addition, The Dolmen were named \\"Best Pagan Band UK\\" in the 2018 \\"Pagan Events UK\\" competition. Music The Dolmen are an independent, self-published group. Their musical style covers a wide range from traditional Celtic folk music to electric rock, including modern interpretations of historical material and events. In 2008, the band released \\"Winter Solstice\\", a collection of original carols and songs inspired by the ancient pre-Christian themes of the season, drawing heavily upon the pagan traditions and mythology of the British Isles associated with the celebration of Yule. The Dolmen's early 2010 album, The Crabchurch Conspiracy is a departure in many ways from their general offerings in that it is a musical re-telling of the events of a little-known but decisive battle of the English Civil War taking place in February 1645 at the strategic Dorset seaport of Weymouth. Based on the book of the same name by author/historian and Dolmen collaborator Mark Vine, the album utilizes both song and spoken word to recount the daring exploits of the Sydenham brothers, William and Francis, who thwarted the Royalist conspirators in their bid to seize the town, culminating in The Battle of Weymouth. Professor Ronald Hutton of the University of Bristol, a leading expert on 17th century Britain, speaks a stirring introduction to the album. In August 2010, the band released their first double album, \\"Spirits of the Sea\\", a collection of original songs, sea chanteys, and atmospheric musical arrangements interspersed with tales and narrations of the historical exploits of several well-known pirates, buccaneers and 'gentlemen of the marque'. Among the album's Poole, Devon, Dorset and Bristol UK privateers are Blackbeard, Calico Jack, William Lewis, Cap'n Ned Lowe, Henry Strangways, and the sinister husband-and-wife team of Eric Cobham and Maria Lindsey. The album also celebrates in song and story the infamous Harry Paye of Poole, whose life and adventures are spoken of on the album by a linear descendant, Mr. Bob Paye. Mr. Paye, a retired educator, lives still within the area from which his famous ancestor sailed forth. \\"Paye Day\\", now a charitable event, is celebrated each Summer in Poole in honor of their famous pirate son. With the advent of \\"Spirits of the Sea\\" and furthered by the energy of their 2012 double album, \\"Storm\\", The Dolmen created \\"The Pirates Keep\\", a musically oriented gathering that, with the support of several historically influenced re-enactment groups, meet at various venues within the UK to re-create as authentically as possible pirate gatherings of old, during which the band's music is enhanced by audience participation in which true, and sometimes fanciful but thrilling tales of daring seafaring events are related. Encouraged by audience response, The Dolmen are in the process of filming several of these gatherings and are developing ideas for a film based on the exploits of many of the characters that have emerged as the concept of the Pirates Keep continues to grow. Aside from the band's collective efforts, Taloch has released several solo albums over the years. Among the most notable is Crow Dance, a largely shamanistic themed journey that explores his ancestral Native American heritage, incorporating also ancient spiritual elements of his Welsh roots. Album art Since the release of Taloch Jameson's solo album, Crow Dance, all subsequent album art and overall CD design have been created by Weymouth, Dorset artist and illustrator, Semirani Wolf Vine. Notable for her fluid imagery and utilization of vivid, primary colours, she also collaborates with the band in the production of concert posters and a variety of material for media release.

The film stars David Fox, Lea Moreno, Jeremy Roberts, and introducing Asif Mohammed Seth as Krishna. Plot This movie is narrated by Professor John Gellar as he starts off by stating that during a celebration of the jungle spirit Deva in what is supposedly India (even though the area is still ruled by a king) with the celebration held by Rajah Singh, a boy named Suresh disappears into the forest. His mother Prema wants to search for him, but is told it is too dangerous. Suresh is rescued from Sabre the leopard by the elephant Bono and the monkey Mantoo, and he is given the ability to communicate with the animals. Bono informs the animals present that Sabre has hunted on the Night of Deva and for Sabre to be brought to him. When Sabre appears and Bono scolds him for violating the no hunting rule that occurs on the Night of Deva, Sabre states that he will come for the boy when he is old enough to defend himself. Suresh is named \\"Manling\\" and raised by the forest creatures where Bono ends up training the Manling to defend himself when it comes to the day when he has to fight Sabre. As an adult, Manling, who is now called Krishna must battle Sabre. At the same time, Professor John Gellar has picked up his niece Anna from the airport at the time when he was looking for a valuable statue associated with the NƒÅga, which enables anyone pure of heart to understand all the world's languages, and the scroll that goes with it. Rajah Singh is also seeking to obtain the statue where he claims that the treasure belongs to his family and hires treasure hunter Joshua Hook to find it. Hook will use any means necessary, even killing, to make sure he gets not only the treasure, but also his share of the money from finding it. Rajah Singh has his servant Sanjay work with Joshua Hook who is instructed to act as Rajah Singh's game warden. Joshua Hook has an encounter with Professor Gellar when he tries to pursue Krishna as Professor Gellar points to the opposite direction. Later that evening, Professor Gellar tells Anna about the jungle boy stating that he was a kid who wandered into the jungle and was raised by animals. Professor Gellar also tells Anna that the mother of the boy died of a broken heart. Krishna arrives at the Valley of Death where he must fight Sabre. But when he defeats Sabre in a manner that violates the rules involving defeating him near a village by using fire against him, he is told by Bono to go out on his own much to the objection of Mantoo. Under advice from Deva the next day, Krishna is told that he must return to the humans. Geller and Anna find him and take him in, teaching him English and how to be human. He learns fast because he knew human ways at one time. Professor Geller also mentioned in the narration that Sabre left the jungle and wasn't heard from again. Anna and Krishna become romantically involved. After Mantoo visits Krishna, Bono is shown to have some regrets of sending Krishna away. Geller's servant Ravi tells Joshua Hook and his cousin Sanjay about Gellar also looking for the statue. The next day, Geller finds his map missing as Joshua Hook and his men arrives with the map as Joshua Hook captures Anna and hands her over to Rajah Singh. Geller is now forced to work with Joshua Hook to obtain the statue from the sacred jungle. Disappointed that Mr. Hook had tricked him, Ravi tells Krishna what happened and Krishna starts to rescue Anna from Rajah Singh's palace After Krishna frees Anna from Rajah Singh, they go after Joshua Hook as Deva tells Krishna that he must enlist Bono's help and tell him that it's his orders to help Krisha. Krishna finds Bono and Mantoo where Krishna tells Bono what Deva wanted Krishna to tell Bono. Arriving near the spot where the statue is located, Krishna, Anna, Bono, and Mantoo await nearby as Deva tries to prevent Joshua Hook from obtaining the statue. This doesn't work as Deva teleports away when Joshua Hook tries to shoot him which ends up breaking open the rock the contains the statue. After wounding Professor Gellar as Anna runs to his side, Joshua Hook orders Sanjay to reach into the rock and grab the statue and scroll. Sanjay does so and Joshua Hook makes off with the statue, the scroll, and Anna. Deva tells Krishna to go after Mr. Hook while he heals Professor Gellar. Moments later at Rajah Singh's palace, Joshua Hook and Rajah Singh make their way to the Alter Room with Anna as their prisoner. Krishna and Mantoo enter the palace and make their way to the Alter Room. After Sanjay leaves upon tying Anna to a column, Joshua Hook has Rajah Singh recite the prayer that would summon NƒÅga to them. When the giant cobra NƒÅga arrives upon Krisha and Mantoo's arrival, it deems Joshua Hook unworthy to receive the special gift. Joshua Hook fires his gun at NƒÅga which doesn't faze NƒÅga who then devours Joshua Hook. When Rajah Singh states to NƒÅga that he is NƒÅga's disciple, NƒÅga tells Rajah Singh that he doesn't deserve the title and turns him into a pig. Upon NƒÅga turning his attention towards Krishna and Anna, Krishna tells NƒÅga not to harm Anna. NƒÅga agrees with Krishna's demands declaring them worthy of the special gift. Before regressing back into statue form, NƒÅga tells Krishna to hide his statue and scroll someplace where nobody will ever find it. After Naga leaves, Krishna frees Anna who can now understand Mantoo. With Professor Gellar recovered and Ravi is the servant of Professor Gellar again, Krishna prepares to leave as he considers Anna part of his family and tells her to come visit him someday. Krishna leaves and reunites with Bono and Mantoo. A voice-over by Professor Gellar states that Krishna has returned to the jungle and placed NƒÅga's statue and scroll someplace where nobody will ever find it. Professor Gellar also mentions about the day when Mantoo stumbled upon a lost temple in the jungle, but that will be for another story.

Malfi is also a musician, having fronted the Baltimore-based alternative rock band Nellie Blide as well as his current project, Veer. He currently lives in Maryland.  Life and career  Ronald Malfi was born on April 28, 1977 in Brooklyn, New York. His father was a Secret Service agent and his mother was a stay-at-home mom, who eventually raised four children, of which Ronald was the eldest.

Malfi went on to study at Anne Arundel Community College and ultimately received a degree in English from Towson University in 1999. Malfi began writing stories at an early age. His earliest short stories and small press novels saw Malfi using his full name, Ronald Damien Malfi, but he later dropped his middle name for his mass market releases. As for his daily writing routine, Malfi has said he typically tries to write about 15 pages a day. He is considered one of the new wave of literary, or \\"art house,\\" horror novelists. In 2009, his novel Shamrock Alley, based on the true exploits of his own father, a retired Secret Service agent who went undercover and infiltrated the violent Irish gang in Manhattan known as The Westies, was released and optioned for television. The novel also won a Silver Independent Publisher Book Awards medal (IPPY) in the thriller/suspense/mystery novel category in 2010. In 2010, his novel Snow was released in paperback to much acclaim, as reviewers touted the novel's near- flawless pacing and descriptive writing. Malfi claims the novel was \\"feverishly hammered out in about two weeks.\\"MK Horror's review of \\"Snow\\" The plot of the novel follows a group of strangers in to a town in Iowa which has been overrun by snow phantoms that can turn people into flesh-hungry zombies.

Although more of a political moderate, in 1774, Gray was forced to choose between patriotism and loyalism over the Massachusetts Government Act (which suspended the Provincial Charter). Gray chose to recognize the right of the King and Parliament to suspend, at will, the rights and liberties of Massachusetts Bay.

Ultimately, Gray's property was confiscated and he was forced to flee Boston in 1776 where he spent the rest of his life in London, England. He was named in the Massachusetts Banishment Act of 1778. Harrison's daughter, Elizabeth Gray Otis, stayed behind with her husband Samuel Allyne Otis [1740‚Äì1814], brother of pamphleteer James Otis, Jr. and author Mercy Otis Warren.

The sponsor of the nature park, founded in 1974, is Hanover Region.  Location  The Steinhuder Meer Nature Park lies south of Nienburg/Weser, west of Neustadt am R√ºbenberge, northwest of Wunstorf, north of Hagenburg and Sachsenhagen and east of Rehburg-Loccum, parts of these parishes lying within the nature park itself. In the centre of the nature park is northwest Germany's biggest inland waterbody, Lake Steinhude (Steinhuder Meer). In the north of the nature park is the hillocky forest of Grinderwald, in the east is the bog of Totes Moor, its southwestern fringes are bordered by the Rehburg Hills and, in the northwest is the Schneerener Moor.  Description  Over 10% of the nature park is under nature protection and over 65% under landscape protection. The Steinhuder Meer (\\"Lake Steinhude\\"), which is just under in area and only 1.5 m deep, is a wetland of international importance and is a breeding and overwintering area and migration stop for many waders and water fowl. The wet meadows in the vicinity of the lake also play an important part here. In the bogs, some still intact and other recultivated, a large number of rare animal and plant species thrive. The nature park sees up to 50,000 day visitors at weekends during the summer as a result of the variety of leisure pursuits available in this picturesque landscape. These pursuits include cycling, walking, swimming, sailing and surfing. The villages of Steinhude and Mardorf benefit significantly more from this than Rehburg, Winzlar, Hagenburg or Gro√üenheidorn. Villages bordering the lake have restrictions placed upon them for nature conservation reasons. The height of the water level, the desilting and removal of vegetation from the lake, building near the shores and the management of the stream of tourists have a significant potential for conflict. Just as conflicting are the restrictions on surfing, sailing and walking in order to support a bird reserve of international standing. The nature park has been commended several times for its providing a model solution to these conflicts of interest between nature conservation and tourism.

She was born in New York City (1944), graduated from the High School of Music & Art (1961), and has a BFA from Carnegie Mellon University (1965). She married the composer Martin Boykan in 1983 and currently lives and works in New York City. Background Schwalb was born in New York City (1944), graduated from the High School of Music & Art (1961), and holds a BFA from Carnegie Mellon University (1965). In 1983 she married composer Martin Boykan and works from her Manhattan studio. Her work blends the mediums of drawing and painting. She is a leader in the use of silverpoint in contemporary art. Style Susan Schwalb is one of the foremost figures in the revival of the ancient technique of silverpoint drawing in America. Most of the contemporary artists who draw with a metal stylus continue the tradition of Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht D√ºrer by using the soft, delicate line for figurative imagery . By contrast, Schwalb's work is abstract, and her handling of the technique is innovative . In some works, paper is torn and burned to provide loose uncontrolled contrast to the precise linearity of silverpoint. In others, silverpoint is combined with flat expanses of acrylic paint or gold leaf. Subtle shifts of tone and color are evident from the juxtaposition of a different types of metal. In more recent works, Schwalb has abandoned the silverpoint stylus in favor of wide metal bands that achieve a shimmering atmosphere reminiscent of watercolor paintings. Memories of light have been a recurrent source for her work. Travels to Arizona and New Mexico suggest some of the colors and shapes in the painting series called \\"Mesa\\", and other works are influenced by light on the Hudson River as viewed from her studio on the West Side of Manhattan. Visits to artist colonies such as the MacDowell Colony, Yaddo and the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts have also provided a backdrop to influence her work. Schwalb's oeuvre ranges from drawings on paper to artist books and paintings on canvas or wood panels. Many of these panels are carefully beveled so that the imagery seems to float off the wall. Her work is represented in major public collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C., the British Museum, London, the Brooklyn Museum, New York, the Fogg Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, Kupferstichkabinett - Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Germany, the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, England, the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, England, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas, the Achenbach Foundation of Graphic Arts, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Library of Congress, Washington, DC, the Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts, the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut, the Rhode Island School of Design Museum of Art, Providence, Rhode Island, and the Arkansas Arts Center, Little Rock, Arkansas. Artist books Schwalb's artist's books, often done in collaboration with the composer Martin Boykan, are in the collections of the Library of Congress, MOMA, the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Athenaeum Music and Arts Library, La Jolla, California, National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, D.C., and the Houghton Library at Harvard University.

Italy has been influential at a coinage point of view: the florin, one of the most used coinage types in European history, was struck in Florence in the 13th century. Since Italy has been for centuries divided into many city- states, they all had different coinage systems, but when the country became unified in 1861, the Italian lira came into place, and was used until 2002. Today, Italy uses the Euro. History Ancient Rome and Ancient Greece Despite the fact that the first Italian coinage systems were used in the Magna Graecia and Etruscan civilization, the Romans introduced a widespread currency throughout Italy. Unlike most modern coins, Roman coins had intrinsic value. While they contained precious metals, the value of a coin was higher than its precious metal content, so they were not bullion. Estimates of their value range from 1.6 to 2.85 times their metal content, thought to equal the purchasing power of 10 modern British Pound Sterling (US$15) at the beginning of the Roman Empire to around 18 Pound Sterling (US$29) by its end (comparing bread, wine and meat prices) and, over the same period, around one to three days' pay for a Legionnaire.Buying Power of Roman Coins Middle Ages and Renaissance Florin The florin was struck from 1252 to 1523 with no significant change in its design or metal content standard. It had 54 grains of gold (3.5g). The \\"fiorino d'oro\\" of the Republic of Florence was the first European gold coin struck in sufficient quantities to play a significant commercial role since the seventh century. As many Florentine banks were international supercompanies with branches across Europe, the florin quickly became the dominant trade coin of Western Europe for large scale transactions, replacing silver bars in multiples of the mark (a weight unit equal to eight troy ounces). In the fourteenth century, one hundred and fifty European states and local coin issuing authorities made their own copies of the florin. The most important of these was the Hungarian forint because the Kingdom of Hungary was a major source of gold mined in Europe (until the New World began to contribute to the supply in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, most of the gold used in Europe came from Africa). Early modern history The early modern Italian coins were very similar in style to French francs, especially in decimals, since it was ruled by the country in the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. They corresponded to a value of 0.29 of gold or 4.5 grams of silver. Papal States scudo A Papal States scudo with Pope Pius VII. The Papal States scudo was the coinage system used in the Papal States until 1866. Between 1798 and 1799, the revolutionary French forces established the Roman Republic, which issued coins denominated in baiocco and scudo. In addition, the states of Ancona, Civitavecchia, Clitunno, Foligno, Gubbio, Pergola and Perugia changed their coinage system to that of the Roman Republic. In 1808, the Papal States were annexed by France, and French francs circulated as the official coins. When the Pope's authority was restored in 1814, the scudo was restored as the currency. However, the coinage of the individual states was not resumed. In 1849, another Roman Republic was established which issued coins centrally and in Ancona. In 1866, the scudo was replaced by the lira, equivalent to the Italian lira. The exchange rate used was 5.375 lire = 1 scudo. Parman lira Half Parman lira The Parman lira was Parma's official currency before 1802, and later revived from 1815 to 1859. The Duchy of Parma had its own coinage system until it was made a part of France in 1802. This lira was subdivided into 20 soldi (singular: soldo), each of 12 denari (singular: denaro), with the sesino worth 6 denari and the ducato was worth 7 lire. The currency was replaced by the French franc. After the re-establishment of Parman independence, the Parman currency system was introduced in 1815. Also called the lira, it was subdivided into 20 soldi or 100 centesimi. However, this lira was equal to the French franc and the Sardinian lira, and it circulated alongside the latter. It weighed 5 grams, and had a purity of 9/10 of silver. Since 1861, Parma has used the equivalent Italian lira. Neapolitan piastra Neapolitan 120 grana (1 piastra) coin The Neapolitan piastra was the most common silver coin of the Kingdom of Naples. In order to distinguish it from the piastra issued on the island of Sicily, it is referred to as the \\"Neapolitan piastra\\" as opposed to the \\"Sicilian piastra\\". These two piastra were equal but were subdivided differently. The Neapolitan piastra was divided into 120 grana (singular: grano), each of 2 tornesi (singular: tornese) or 12 cavalli (singular: cavallo). There were also the carlino worth 10 grana and the ducato worth 100 grana. Two Sicilies piastra The Two Sicilies piastra was the coinage system or currency of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies between 1815 and 1860. It was subdivided into 120 grana (singular: grano), each of 2 tornesi (singular: tornese). Accounts were kept in ducato, worth 100 grana.Handbook for Travellers in Southern Italy (1868) Sardinian lira Sardinian 1 lira (1828) The Sardinian lira was the currency of the Kingdom of Sardinia between 1816 and 1861. It was subdivided into 100 centesimi (singular centesimo ) and was equal in value to the French franc, which had replaced the Piedmontese and Sardinian scudos by 1799. It was replaced at par by the Italian lira. Tuscan fiorino Fiorino: Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany. The Tuscan fiorino was the currency of Tuscany between 1826 and 1859. It was subdivided into 100 quattrini (singular: quattrino), with an additional denomination called the paolo, worth 40 quattrini, in circulation. Lombardy-Venetia florin The Lombardy-Venetia florins were the coins of Lombardy-Venetia (reduced to the sole Venetia three years before) between 1862 and 1866. It replaced the pound at a rate of 1 florin = 3 pounds. The florin was equivalent to the Austro-Hungarian gulden (also called the florin). Although it was subdivided into 100 soldi rather than 100 Kreuzer, Austrian coins circulated in Venetia. The only coins issued specifically for Venetia were copper ¬Ω and 1 soldo pieces. Modern period (Kingdom and Republic of Italy) The lira was made the official currency of Italy in 1861 after the Italian unification, however stopped being used in 2002. The euro coinage system entered circulation in Italy in 2002 and is currently the official currency. Lira An 1865 Italian lira coin. Upon the creation of the Kingdom of Italy under Vittorio Emanuele II (1861), a unified lira was established, at 4.5 grams of silver or 290.322 milligrams of gold. This was a direct continuation of the Sardinian lira. Other currencies replaced by the Italian lira included the Lombardy-Venetia pound, the Two Sicilies piastra, the Tuscan fiorino, the Papal States scudo and the Parman lira. In 1865, Italy formed part of the Latin Monetary Union in which the lira was set as equal to, among others, the French, Belgian and Swiss francs: in fact, until the introduction of the euro in 2002, people speaking the Gallo-Italic dialects in north-western Italy usually called \\"franc\\" the lira. World War I broke the Latin Monetary Union and resulted in prices rising severalfold in Italy. Inflation was curbed somewhat by Mussolini, who, on 18 August 1926, declared that the exchange rate between lira and pound would be ¬£1 = 90 lire‚Äîthe so- called Quota 90, although the free exchange rate had been closer to 140‚Äì150 lire per pound. In 1927, the lira was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 1 dollar = 19 lire. This rate lasted until 1934, with a separate \\"tourist\\" rate of US$1 = 24.89 lire being established in 1936. In 1939, the \\"official\\" rate was 19.8 lire. After the Allied invasion of Italy, an exchange rate was set at US$1 = 120 lire (1 British pound = 480 lire) in June 1943, reduced to 100 lire the following month. In German occupied areas, the exchange rate was set at 1 Reichsmark = 10 lire. After the war, the Roman mint first issued the first 1, 2, 5 and 10 lira coins (6 September 1946). They were officially set up on 21 December of the same year and were used up to 1953‚Äì4. The value of the lira fluctuated, before Italy set a peg of US$1 = 575 lire within the Bretton Woods System in November 1947. Following the devaluation of the pound, Italy devalued to US$1 = 625 lire on 21 September 1949. This rate was maintained until the end of the Bretton Woods System in the early 1970s. Several episodes of high inflation followed until the lira was replaced by the euro. The lira was the official unit of currency in Italy until 1 January 1999, when it was replaced by the euro (euro coins and notes were not introduced until 2002). Old lira denominated currency ceased to be legal tender on 28 February 2002. The conversion rate is 1,936.27 lire to the euro. All lira banknotes in use immediately before the introduction of the euro, as all post WW2 coins, are still exchangeable for euros in all branches of the Bank of Italy until 29 February 2012. Euro The euro officially began circulating in Italy on 1 January 2002 (even though the creation of Italian lira coins was suspended in 1999). Italian euro coins have a design unique to each denomination, though there are many themes of works by one of the most renowned and famous Italian artists and painters. Each coin is designed by a different designer, from the 1 cent to the 2 euro coin they are: Eugenio Driutti, Luciana De Simoni, Ettore Lorenzo Frapiccini, Claudia Momoni, Maria Angela Cassol, Roberto Mauri, Laura Cretara and Maria Carmela Colaneri. All designs feature the 12 stars of the EU, the year of imprint, the overlapping letters \\"RI\\" for Repubblica Italiana (Italian Republic) and the letter R for Rome. There are no Italian euro coins dated earlier than 2002, even though they were certainly minted earlier, as they were first distributed to the public in December 2001.

The hamlet is about above sea level in the Chiltern Hills. The toponym is derived from the Old English personal name Ecgi and ''''', meaning \\"valley\\".Lobel, 1962, pages 93‚Äì112 was originally an ancient British upland farm complex owned by Ecgi and set in the valley today occupied by Exlade Street. Exlade is also recorded variously as Hekeslad (1241) Egesflade (1278) Eggeslade (1285) Egeslade (1360) Egslade (1366) and Egguslhade (1406),Margaret Gelling, The Place-Names of Oxfordshire, Part 1 (EPNS 23), Cambridge 1953 By the later medieval period, 'street' was often used to describe straggling villages in areas of late woodland clearance.

Shaws, in the Oxfordshire Chilterns, were strips of woodland left as field boundaries after the clearance of woodland In 1597, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, it was recorded that the vicar of South Stoke held services at St. Leonard's Woodcote only on Christmas Day, Easter Day and a few other days each year.[4] Some worshippers travelled 3 miles (4.8 km) each way to South Stoke to go to church, but most preferred to travel less than 1 mile (1.6 km) to SS Peter and Paul in the adjacent parish of Checkendon.[4] The law obliged everyone to worship in their own parishes, so since 1595 the Rector of Checkendon had prosecuted people from Exlade Street in the local archdeacon's court for coming to his church.[4] In response the faithful of Exlade Street and Woodcote petitioned John Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury for permission to worship at Checkendon.[4] Whitgift granted the request, so long as they continued to attend their parish church in South Stoke four times a year Lobel, 1962, pages 93-112 World War Two Leslie Marcham - Private 4th Battalion, Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry - Died 30 May 1944 is recorded on the Woodcote War Memorial.

A Headquarters Site and 3 separate sites, one to three miles apart and not unduly conspicuous from the air and therefore difficult to attack, needed to be built. The attraction of the local area was the ancient beech woodlands on the edge of the village, most of which was owned by Christ Church, Oxford. The woodland provided a natural camouflage from the air. A total of over 176 acres of mixed woodland and open pasture bordered by some 7 miles of winding country lanes was requisitioned on compulsory leases from a number local landowners on a total compensation rental of ¬£100 pa. Site 3 covered acres on the edges of the road to Exlade Street. The site to the west of the road and also bordering Deadmans Lane was owned by Christ Church, Oxford University, whilst the site to the east was owned by Lawrence Hignett of Hook End Farm. The initial establishment was 8 RAF Officers and 476 civilians and during the next few months the civilian establishment was increased to 755. the role of this Unit was to hold a range of stores for the use of the RAF.

Buildings Exlade Street currently has 12 private houses and an excellent Pub. Many of the houses are grade II listed and started life as Farms and Farm/Woodland workers cottages. Carter's Cottage, the oldest building surviving in Exlade Street is a cruck cottage that dates from before 1550.Emery, 1974, page 115 Exlade Street has a public house, The Highwayman Inn, (formally called The Greyhound) whose building also dates from the 16th century.The Highwayman Inn The Hamlet used to be larger but it is known that two houses burnt down in the early part of last century. The Exlade Street blacksmiths forge previously stood in the car park of the Highwayman pub and several large barns existed for the storing and working of wood from the local area. It is estimated by the South Oxfordshire Archaeological Group (SOAG) that up to 30 extra buildings existed. In the 1980s SOAG's founder, Cynthia Graham Kerr, researched the buildings and landscape of Exlade Street. SOAG and The Oxfordshire Woodland Group are now leading a new multipart project, which includes: searching for lost buildings; understanding how local timber buildings were constructed and studying how the local woodlands were exploited for these purposes, in particular how extant sawpits were used to convert timbers.South Oxfordshire Archaeological Group References Sources  Category:Hamlets in Oxfordshire ","title":"Exlade Street"},{"id":"26067975","text":"Pierre-Yves Plat (born 1980 in Paris) is a French pianist who reinterprets classical masterpieces into jazz, ragtime, boogie, salsa and disco.  Biography  Pierre-Yves Plat started learning classical piano at the age of five with Marie-Claude Legrand. His personality and his innate sense of rhythm led him towards boogie-woogie, ragtime and stride, and then onto improvisation. He learnt with artists as diverse as √âdouard Ferlet (Berklee Jazz Performance Award - 1992) and Fabrice Eulry, 'the Chopin of boogie'. It was at the instigation of Eulry that he recorded his first disk of ragtime and began to perform in concert. He has since played in many venues in Paris (L'Archipel, salle Cortot, etc.), Versailles (Bagheera Piano Bar, the Montansier theatre) and throughout France, regularly participating in Jazz and Blues festivals (the 'Petit Journal' of St. Michel and Montparnasse, Jazz Club, etc.). He was also involved in the musical animation of the famous Hotel George V, Paris. He now performs internationally, invited to play across Europe, from London to Albania. His style is between classical and jazz, fusing the two with his reimaginings of the classics of Bach, Chopin and Mozart. His experimentations with the two forms came together in his first album, Pourquoi pas? ('Why not?'), in 2005. This album showcased the young musician's virtuosity, allying classical structures with rhythmic breakaways towards other musical styles. His talent for reinventing the classical form appealed to a wide audience, proving accessible to music lovers of all tastes as he merged different eras of music.Jean-Pierre Thiollet, 88 notes pour piano solo, Neva Editions, 2015, p.162. His second album, R√©cr√©ations (2007), was a continuation of his unique style. With it came further success and recognition with appearances on M6 (TV channel), France's national television channel ('1945' and '100% Mag', February 2010).

She was the last person fluent in the Aka-Bo language. Boa Sr is not to be confused with another Great Andamanese tribal member, Boa Jr; the two women were not directly related. Boa Jr's late mother, Boro (who was also the last speaker of her language, Aka-Kora) was Boa Sr's best friend and named her daughter in her honor. Biography Boa was born around 1925. Her mother, To, belonged to the Bo people and her father, Renge, belonged to the Jeru people. Boa's early life was spent in Mayabunder, a town on Middle Andaman Island. She was married at a young age to Nao, another member of her father's people, although both he and their children predeceased her. She regarded the Jeru language as her mother tongue. Boa Sr. lived through the epidemic brought by the British to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which devastated the Great Andamanese population, and also through the Japanese occupation of the Andaman Islands during World War II. In the 1970s, she and other Great Andamanese was forcibly relocated by the government of India to Strait Island, a small tribal reserve east of Baratang Island. Boa Sr. worked with Anvita Abbi, a professor of linguistics at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, since 2005. Abbi studied and recorded Boa's language and songs. Other members of the Great Andamanese speech community had difficulty understanding the songs and narratives which she knew in Bo. She also spoke the Andamanese dialect of Hindi, as well as Great Andamanese creole, a mix of the ten indigenous languages of Andamans. Boa Sr. survived the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake by climbing a tree. She later explained her escape from the tsunami saying, \\"We were all there when the earthquake came. The eldest told us the Earth would part, don't run away or move.\\" Her husband, Nao Jer, died several years before she did and the couple had no children. She suffered from some vision loss during her later life, but was considered to be in good health until shortly before her death in 2010. Boa Sr. died at a hospital in Port Blair on 26 January 2010. Boa Sr., who was approximately 85 years old, was the oldest living member of the Great Andamanese tribes at the time. Boa Sr.'s death left just 52 surviving Great Andamanese people in the world, none of whom remember any Bo. Their population is greatly reduced from the estimated 5,000 Great Andamanese living in the Andaman Islands at the time of the arrival of the British in 1858. Legacy Stephen Corry, director of the British-based NGO Survival International, issued a statement saying, \\"With the death of Boa Sr. and the extinction of the Bo language, a unique part of human society is now just a memory. Boa's loss is a bleak reminder that we must not allow this to happen to the other tribes of the Andaman Islands.\\" Linguist Narayan Choudhary also explained what the loss of Boa Sr. meant in both academic and personal terms, \\"Her loss is not just the loss of the Great Andamanese community, it is a loss of several disciplines of studies put together, including anthropology, linguistics, history, psychology, and biology. To me, Boa Sr. epitomised a totality of humanity in all its hues and with a richness that is not to be found anywhere else.\\"  References  Category:1920s births Category:2010 deaths Category:Last known speakers of a language Category:People from North and Middle Andaman district Category:Andamanese languages ","title":"Boa Sr"},{"id":"26068190","text":"Marc O‚ÄôPolo is a Swedish-German fashion label founded in 1967 by Rolf Lind, G√∂te Huss and Jerry O'Sheets.Marc O‚ÄôPolo: The History of Marc O‚ÄôPolo The company generates annual sales (as of 2019) of more than ‚Ç¨472 million.

It is the duty of the Approved mental health professional to determine who is the nearest relative of the patient and consult them in the process of assessment, treatment or guardianship. The 'nearest relative' role can be very beneficial to people who have been admitted to hospital against their wishes, however the recruitment process has a number of issues which can be problematic for both the person themselves and the relative who takes on the role. Definition In Section 26 of the Act, there is a specific hierarchy of kinship relations with the patient or in the context of the type and length of joint residency, as well as caring relationships which is used to determine the nearest relative. The hierarchy is the first person over 18, although a spouse may be younger, in the following list: husband or wife or civil partner (or those living together as husband or wife or civil partner for not less than 6 months); son or daughter; father or mother; brother or sister; grandparent; grandchild; uncle or aunt; nephew or niece; anyone else living with the person for not less than 5 years. The eldest is given precedence in any instance. Relatives of half blood are treated the same as those of whole blood and an illegitimate child as the legitimate child of his mother, or his father, provided he has defined parental responsibility. Under Section 26(6), partners who have been living together for over 6 months, as husband or wife, or civil partner, are considered the 'nearest relative'. Section 26(7) says that someone who has 'ordinarily' resided with the patient for over 5 years can be designated as the 'nearest relative'. S26(4) states that, if someone resides with one or more relatives who cares for them, then that relative is given preference over others, being designated 'nearest relative', presiding over the above hierarchy. Under Section 26(5), a person who is ordinarily residing outside the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man cannot be considered the 'nearest relative' of a person ordinarily resident within the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. Instead, in that case \\"the nearest relative of the patient shall be ascertained as if that person were dead\\",Mental Health Act 1983, Section 26 implying that this can hinder British nationals living abroad from having any say on the care of parents living in Britain, for example. Duty to consult In assessing under Section 2 of the Act, Section 11(3) specifies a duty for the Approved Mental Health Professional to 'take such steps as are practicable' to inform the nearest relative and inform them of their power to request discharge under S23(2)(a) of the Act. In assessing under Section 3 or Section 7 of the Act, the rules are different. Section 11(4) of the Act states the 'nearest relative' must be consulted and if they object to detention of the patient, then they cannot be detained, even if the professionals involved in the assessment make the decision to do so. They must also be informed of their right to request discharge in writing, under S23(2)(a) of the Act. Section 11(4) of the Act concedes that the 'nearest relative' sometimes may not be consulted as it is 'not practicable' or would cause 'unreasonable delay'. Definition of the word 'practicable' is not always clear and to some extent has been defined by case law. Right to request discharge The 'nearest relative' has the right to request discharge of patients detained under Section 2 (assessment), Section 3 (treatment), Section 7 (guardianship) or Section 17a (community treatment order) of the Act, by giving no more than 72 hours' notice in writing to the 'responsible clinician. This right, given in Section 23 of the Act, is circumscribed by Section 25 which states the request may be rejected if the 'responsible clinician' believes the patient 'would be likely to act in a manner dangerous to other persons or to himself'. Displacement  Section 29 of the Act defines five circumstances in which the nearest relative may be displaced by the County Court, with a 'nearest relative' appointed, and who may apply for a displacement order. Application for displacement and appointment of a new 'nearest relative' can be made by the patient, their relative, anyone with whom they are residing or an Approved Mental Health Professional. Grounds for making an application to displace, according to Section 29(3), include the patient having no discernible 'nearest relative' or the 'nearest relative' being 'incapable' due to mental disorder or other illness, 'unreasonably' objecting to detention, exercising their power to discharge without due regard for the patient's 'welfare' or being 'otherwise unsuitable' for the role. The 'nearest relative' can relinquish their role by putting it in writing that they wish to delegate to another person, with their agreement, who has not been disqualified from acting as such.

Volo was sailing by dead reckoning, and on 5 March 1896 Captain Olsen judged the ship to be 200 miles from the coast.

The crew climbed into the rigging, and after some hours all 12 were able to reach the shore using lines secured with the help of local people who came to offer assistance.

She possessed a voice with a dark timbre that she used with great expression. Born in Fano in the Province of Pesaro and Urbino, Capuana was the older sister of conductor Franco Capuana. She was trained in the art of singing and piano performance at the Conservatory of San Pietro a Majella in Naples where she was a pupil of Beniamino Carelli. She made her stage debut in 1916 at the opera house in Reggio Emilia as Amneris in Giuseppe Verdi's Aida; a role which she would repeat at many major opera houses internationally later in her career and notably record for the opera's first commercial recording in 1928. Capuana soon began appearing in leading roles at major opera houses in both Italy and France and by 1920 she had already made appearances at La Scala in Milan, the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, the Teatro Regio in Turin, and the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris among others. She enjoyed several major successes with the role of Brang√§ne in Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde in her early career, and the part helped establish herself as one of Italy's leading Wagnerian singers. Other Wagner roles in her repertoire, included Ortrud in Lohengrin, Venus in Tannh√§user, and Erda, Fricka, Gutrune, and the Second Norn in The Ring Cycle. In 1921 Capuana portrayed Zoraide in the world premiere of Carlo Adolfo Cant√π's Ettore Fieramosca at the Teatro Regio in Turin. In 1923 she had a major triumph at La Scala as Herodias in Richard Strauss's Salome. She continued to return with some frequency to that house through 1928 in such roles as Amneris, Fricka, Ortrud, and Rubria in Arrigo Boito's Nerone. She was seen at the Teatro Carlo Felice periodically between 1924‚Äì1936 where she sang a number of Wagner roles. She also made a number of appearances between 1927‚Äì1930 at the Teatro di San Carlo, including the role of Rufina in Riccardo Zandonai's Conchita. She notably created the title role in the world premiere of Emilio Pizzi's Ivania at the Teatro Donizetti in Bergamo in 1926. During the 1930s she made several appearances at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo. In 1931 she toured Italy as a member of the Carro di Tespi. Outside of Italy, Capuana performed in operas in Barcelona, Lisbon, Cairo, Argentina, Chile, France, and South Africa during the 1920s and 1930s. She was a much loved Amneris at the Teatro Col√≥n in 1925. In 1935 she toured France as a recitalist. Capuana's performance career ceased around the outbreak of World War II. Other roles she performed on stage included Adalgisa in Norma, Azucena in Il trovatore, Cerinto in Nerone, Charlotte in Werther, Laura in La Gioconda, Leonora in La favorite, Maffio Orsini in Lucrezia Borgia, Marguerite in La damnation de Faust, Princess Eboli in Don Carlos, and the Old Woman in L'amore dei tre re. She died in Cagliari at the age of 63.

Among these are: * Prohibition against removing pages \\\\- The removal of a page would obscure the data that were present, so this is not permissible. * Page numbering \\\\- the addition of page numbers, particularly in \\"Page x of y\\" format, allows a reviewer to ensure that there are no missing pages. * Stamped signatures in Asia - the culture of certain Asian countries, and the controls they employ, are such that their use of a stamp in lieu of handwritten signatures has been accepted. * Date and time formats \\\\- dates may be written in a variety of formats that can be confusing if read by personnel with a different cultural background. In the context where different cultures interact, a date such as \\"07-05-10\\" can have numerous different meanings and therefore, by GDocP standards above, violates the requirement for being clear. * Transcription \\\\- A transcription of data, where the original document is not retained, effectively obscures the original data and would be prohibited. Transcription may be helpful where the original is of poor quality writing or is physically damaged, but it should be clearly marked as a transcription and the original retained nevertheless. * Scrap paper, Post-it notes - Intentionally recording raw data on non-official records is a set-up for transcription and is therefore prohibited. * Avoiding asterisks as part of the notation of a hand-change - Where insufficient white space permits a fully notated hand change, a common practice is to use an asterisk (or other mark) near the correction, and elsewhere record the same mark and the notation. The risk is that additional changes are made by another person who uses the same mark, and now the notation can be interpreted to apply to all changes with the mark. Some will therefore advise against the use of the asterisk. Others will accept it, if the notation clearly includes the number of changes that it applies to, such as, \\"* Three entries changed above due to entry errors. KAM 13-Jan-2011\\". There are no known instances of an agency rejecting such a notation.

The plot concerns Joe Quellen, a 25th-century bureaucrat charged with investigating \\"hoppers\\", travelers from the future whose presence in the past has been documented for hundreds of years, and his brother-in-law, Norman Pomrath, an unemployed blue collar worker who ends up being presented with an opportunity to travel back in time. Plot Summary Joe Quellen is a Class Seven bureaucrat in a highly stratified, overpopulated 25th century Earth with a one world government. Those who are in lower classes, such as his sister and brother-in-law in Classes Fourteen and Fifteen, only have the privilege of a one room apartment with even the shower out for full display. Oxygen is rationed. Quellen has managed to find a house for himself in Africa, but if this is discovered he would be severely punished as living space in the world is at a premium. The level of technology is highly advanced; teleportation is a reality, as is time travel. When the novel opens, Quellen's superiors have discovered that missing segments of the population have time traveled back into the past in order to experience a better quality of life; they don't know whether to be happy that they'd shed thousands of people, or upset that the time travelers may be changing history.

Hisamitsu has specialised in transdermal drug delivery system technology (TDDS) since the introduction of its original line of patches in 1903. Its Salonpas brand of products are exported to over fifty countries. Hisamitsu also manufactures the Mohrus and Mohrus-Tape line of external pain relief prescription products for the Japanese drug market. The company also manufactures internal medicines, eye drops for general application and the Lifecella Face Mask, a skin-care product. Hisamitsu has developed the only over-the-counter transdermal patches approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA). History Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical was founded in 1847 under the name of Komatsuya. It was established in present-day Tosu, Saga, which borders the prefectures of Saga and Fukuoka on the island of Kyushu. This region is well known in Japan for a tradition of herbal medicines. The prototype of its Salonpas patch line was created through the application of asahi mankinko, a poultice consisting of rubbing ointment pasted on Japanese paper, in 1903. The Salonpas product line, which was developed from this more traditional remedy, was introduced in 1934 and first exported to overseas markets in 1937. A subsidiary branch was opened in Republic of China (Taiwan) in 1960. In 1975 a joint company was established in Indonesia. More subsidiaries followed in Brazil (Hisamitsu Farmaceutica do Brasil Ltda.) in 1986 and in the US (Hisamitsu America, Ltd.) in 1987. Hisamitsu Vietnam Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. was established in Vietnam in 1994. In 1998 Hisamitsu U.K. opened in London and research laboratory was established in United States of America (California). In 1965 the company changed its name to Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and in 1972 was listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The company began manufacturing and marketing prescription drugs during the 1970s. In 1988, it launched Mohrus, and in 1995, Mohrus-Tape, both prescription external anti-inflammatory drugs. Salonpas Pain Relief Patch and Salonpas Arthritis Pain were approved for over the counter sales in the US in 2008. In 2009, Hisamitsu acquired Noven Pharmaceuticals, a specialty prescription drug transdermal pharmaceutical company based in Florida.

He attended schools in Lausanne, Switzerland, and St. George's School, Newport in Newport, Rhode Island. After graduating from Harvard in 1928, he studied with the artist Andre Lhote in Paris. During World War II, Etting served in the psychological warfare division of the Office of War Information. He was present at the liberation of Paris and he collaborated with Orson Welles to record the event. Family Emlen Pope Etting Jr. was born to Florence Lucas Etting and Emlen Pope Etting Sr., a failed stockbroker, in 1905. Both Emlen's mother and aunt were proud members of Philadelphia's Main Line society. An earlier son was born to the Ettings on August 15, 1903, and given the name Emlen Pope Etting Jr. The child died just three days prior to his first birthday, on August 18, 1904. The following August 24, 1905, Florence gave birth to her second son and, once again, gave him the name of Emlen Pope Etting Jr. Young Emlen's father died of a heart attack when he was only two months old, on October 23, 1905. Florence Etting died on April 13, 1951. Both his parents and the first Emlen Jr. are buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Emlen was reared in a European fashion as much as he was American. Emlen lived with his mother in Europe for much of his childhood. They returned to America in 1917 to avoid World War I. Emlen's Aunt Harriet wanted to ensure Emlen grew to be the Philadelphia gentleman he was meant to be and enrolled him in St. George's School from 1920 to 1924. St. George's, an Episcopal boarding school, was considered at that time to be one of only two suitable options for a young man from Philadelphia's upper crust. Paris Emlen studied French at Harvard University. After graduating, he traveled to Europe to study art. It was a lifestyle underwritten by his aunt, Harriet Etting Brown. He traveled to Munich but was drawn to life in Paris and into the tutelage of the artist Andre Lhote. Lhote taught his students to reduce their subjects into lines and shapes. Emlen remained influenced by Lhote, his teacher and mentor, for the rest of his life. Paris at that time was a student's world. It was filled with myriad forms of art, philosophy, and all the passionate discussions that could accompany it. He frequented the most exclusive art shows and enjoyed the avant-garde films screened in Paris Studio 28. It was in this artistic crucible that Emlen mingled with the most influential artists of the day. In an interview with Marina Pacini from 1988, Emlen describes his experience studying under Lhote in Paris: ‚ÄúNo, it was fluid. People came and went in the classes. You know, sometimes people came and somebody would be very annoyed at something he destroyed, something they‚Äôd done on a canvas, and they were horrified and would never come back. It was in America, I was fascinated when I came back. It was done more like, to please the student; you‚Äôd say something was good and never touch it. But Lhote would barge right in and the students, the whole class, would follow round behind, and he would take one easel, one painting at a time, and whatever he was emphasizing that day, he would rub it in, and how! Much to the, sometimes, students‚Äô annoyance. The reason I'm telling you this is to explain why it was so fluid. There was no point in having a method of teaching composition one day, and one day color was that you got different people and you didn't follow through with it. And with his method you eventually got all the different facets if you stayed long enough.‚Äù Film Etting made several short films. His personal favorite was Poem 8 (1932). As the name suggests the film attempts to use the cadence and narrative of the poem. From his interview with Marina Pacini: ‚ÄúDali was doing one, two in fact, and Cocteau did Blood of a Poet. And I thought, how interesting it would be if we used the film in a different method. So far it had been used like a novel to tell a story, or else as a documentary and there was nothing else in between, and I wanted to use the film as a poetic medium, to do a poem like T. S. Eliot‚Äôs poems, and do it entirely visually and that‚Äôs how I came about to do my film I called Poem 8 and as far as I know it was the first film that experimented in that as a poetic medium.‚Äù Etting uses very literal images of women, modes of travel, and his own body parts. In Poem 8, Etting shows the filmmaker as a present protagonist. According to Kenneth C. Kaletta, PhD, author of a biography on Etting titled With the Rich and Mighty, both Poem 8 and Etting's other early experimental film, Oramunde, are ‚Äútechnologically unsophisticated, sometimes overly arty and labored,‚Äù but illustrate ‚ÄúEtting‚Äôs visionary insight into the promise of artistic expression as well as the potential of communication in cinema beyond filming linear plots.‚Äù Etting made his mark in early film but as times changed, and he stopped working with the medium. From Ettings interview with Pacini: ‚ÄúWell, the films became so much more exciting that my little experiments were pitiful compared to the films of now, it‚Äôs all out. It isn‚Äôt that they do poems yet, but they do the experimentation that has brought the most fantastic results. I go to the movies now and am absolutely bowled [over] with amazement with the marvels that they do in films. I think it is the great art of today.‚Äù During the War During World War II, Etting served in the psychological warfare division of the Office of War Information. He was present at the liberation of Paris and made many sketches of the event that were featured in periodicals of the time. His duty was to disseminate the news of the progress of the D-Day invasion and, more importantly, to reassure the devastated villagers he encountered that they could rely on the assistance of US forces in rebuilding their war-torn lives. He wrote, presented, and recorded a series of daily news programs for the American Broadcasting Station in Europe in the towns he visited to accomplish this. Etting's responsibilities included recording the experiences of the newly liberated French townspeople he met in the wake of the military sweep of their occupied country for the US Army and reporting on what he observed in the field. Etting pieced together and recorded this oral history. Upon his return home, he published Prodigal Flyer, a \\"true\\" story, about his experiences. He felt it was his duty to make a record of the moment, separating the fact from the fiction of war. However, he wanted, nor needed, any war souvenirs of the misery he saw: he never forget what he saw. He felt ashamed that there was such an outpouring of gratitude for him and his party when the appreciation, in his opinion, should be offered instead to the men who fought and died there. Etting was subsequently attached to the Second French Armored Division. Etting documented these historical events in The Liberation of Paris, a recording collaboration with the legendary Orson Welles. The 12-inch, 78 rpm, Asch 3 record English and French language set recorded the live speeches of Generals Dwight D. Eisenhower and Charles de Gaulle on August 25, 1944, accompanied by the commentary of Welles and the translation and commentary of Etting. In addition to recording this experience professionally for broadcast and publication, on the day of the liberation of Paris, Etting also made a personal journey into the past, and perhaps, into his aesthetic and artistic process. The painter wrote in his journal that once the Allies had secured the city and he had fulfilled his military obligations, including requisitioning a jeep to confirm the welfare of Pablo Picasso, Etting made his way to Lhote's studio on the Rue l‚ÄôOdessa. Etting was aware that as a Jew, Lhote had had to move from place to place, sleeping where and when he could in fear of the Gestapo, and Etting wondered whether his old teacher had survived the Nazis' four-year occupation of the city. When Etting arrived again at the Rue l‚ÄôOdessa, Lhote was there and seemed unchanged. Lhote was agitated of course, all of Paris was frenzied, but an excruciating suspicion also plagued Lhote. He begged Etting to assist him. Lhote had to know whether the Luftwaffe had damaged the priceless Delacroix murals in the Palais du Luxembourg, which the Nazis had seized and occupied during the war, and evacuated in the preceding days. After the war After returning from World War II Etting immediately worked as an illustrator, but continued to paint and sculpt. He created a large catalogue of paintings and drawings and worked most every day, believing that an artist should work whether they felt the call of the muse or not. Etting taught at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Philadelphia College of Art, Temple University's Tyler School of Art, and Florida Southern College. Etting married Gloria Braggiotti in 1938. Gloria was a fixture of Main Line society in her own right. She was a great cook and hostess who can be credited to elevating the modern salon to its highest expression. (see Gloria Braggiotti Etting). Etting's sculpture Phoenix Rising was installed in the plaza next to Philadelphia's City Hall in 1982. The sculpture symbolized Philadelphia's rise from urban decay. Emlen Etting died of Parkinson's disease on July 20, 1993, at his home in Philadelphia at the age of 88. References *Kenneth C.

Development As a child, Zegers was fascinated by the rhythmic phases of church-bells, which never ring in time. When he began to compose, he noticed that even pieces of music with minimal rhythmical differences are sometimes subject to these phases. It is this 'weakness' (which often appears just by playing) that is the strongest element of pianophasing, making rhythmical variations possible despite the piece being fully composed and notated. 50 pianists and 25 pianos come together in this large-scale performance. Pianophasing II is a development on his earlier version. It is more complex in structure and more developed in harmonies. Pianophasing II is played in the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival in England. Before this concert pianophasing was played in the Novembermusic festival in the Netherlands. March 2010 Pianophasing is shortlisted for the Royal Philharmonic Society Music Awards.

The galaxy is located at the distance of about 180 kpc from the Sun and moves away from the Sun with the velocity of about 173 km/s. It is classified as a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) meaning that it has an approximately spherical shape with the half-light radius of about 130 pc. Leo V is one of the smallest and faintest satellites of the Milky Way‚Äîits integrated luminosity is about 10,000 times that of the Sun (absolute visible magnitude of about ), which is much lower than the luminosity of a typical globular cluster. However, its mass is about 330 thousand solar masses, which means that Leo's V mass to light ratio is around 75. A relatively high mass to light ratio implies that Leo V is dominated by dark matter. The stellar population of Leo V consists mainly of old stars formed more than 12 billion years ago. The metallicity of these stars is also very low at , which means that they contain 100 times less heavy elements than the Sun. The galaxy is located only 3 degrees away from another Milky Way satellite, Leo IV. The latter is also closer to the Sun by 20 kpc. These two galaxies may be physically associated with each other.

Machine- made, molded glass products are also manufactured in a style that mimics the artisanal technique. History According to studio glass craftsman Jos√© Cruz Guill√©n, the tradition first began in the Netherlands in the 15th century. It was then brought to Germany and Spain, and then to Mexico in 1524 when Rodrigo de Espinoza opened Mexico's first glass factory, in Puebla.

It was developed by T. Keith Blackwell and Harold M. Weintraub in 1990.  Method  SAAB experimental procedure consists of several steps, depending upon the knowledge available about the binding site. A typical SAAB consists of the following steps: # Synthesis of template with random sequence in binding site: three situations are possible: (i) when both the binding site and the protein are known and available; (ii) when only a consensus binding site is available and the binding protein is not; and (iii) when the protein is available, but the binding site is unknown. When the binding site is not known, the number of random nucleotide positions in the template must be large. # Incubate labeled double stranded template with protein: usually the protein has to be synthesized in a host cell with fusion techniques. Longer incubation time and large quantity are provided in case of an unspecific binding site. # Isolate the DNA bound protein by EMSA: the DNA bound protein, migrated in acrylamide gel, is isolated by autoradiography as per an Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) protocol. # Amplify the bound template by PCR. For positive control, amplify the starting template also; The bound DNA is isolated via gel excision, purified, and amplified using PCR. # Label amplified binding site and reselect for binding by EMSA. Precede the binding step at least for 5 times with the amplified labeled DNA sample and fusion protein. # Sequence the DNA: After final step of selection and electrophoresis, clone the DNA into a cloning vector and sequence it. Originally Blackwell used Pyro sequencing, which can be replaced by modern techniques.  Applications   Quox homeodomain  Quox1 is a homeobox gene involved in the regulation of patterns of development (morphogenesis) in animals, fungi and plants and was originally isolated from cDNA library of five week quail embryo. It is the only gene in the hox family that has been found to express in both prosencephalon and mesencephalon involved in the differentiation of the central and peripheral nerve cells. The optimal DNA binding site for Quox1 or its mammalian homologs was identified by SAAB in 2004.not sourced [6] The amplified Quox1 DNA fragment obtained from PCR amplification from a human embryo cDNA librarywas digested with EcoRV and XhoI and cloned into the SmaI and XhoI restriction site of the expression vector pGEMEXxBal. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into competent Escherichia coli strain BL21 and Quox1 fusion proteins were isolated by chromatographic techniques. The radio labeled probe was incubated with 25 pmol of purified Quox1 homeodomain fusion protein in binding buffer for EMSA. The protein bound DNA was detected by autoradiography, and the bands representing protein‚ÄìDNA complexes were excised from the gel and the eluted DNA were amplified by PCR using primers complementary to the 20 bp nonrandom flanking sequences. After 5 set of the same procedure, the purified DNA was cloned into pMD 18T and sequenced. Finally the sequence was identified as the consensus binding sequence for Quox1 homeodomain.  Screening  By combining the power of random-sequence selection with pooled sequencing, the SAAB imprint assay makes possible simultaneous screening of a large number of binding site mutants.not sourced [7] SAAB also allows the identification of sites with high relative binding affinity since the competition is inherent in the protocol. It can also identify site positions that are neutral or specific bases that can interfere with binding, such as a T at - 4 in the E47 half-site.not sourced [8] We can apply the technique to less affinity binding sequence also, provided to keep high concentration of binding protein at each step of binding. It is also possible to identify the binding site even if both the protein and sequence is not known.

It served as the terminus station for the commuter rail trains of Euskotren Trena lines to Durango, Bermeo, Eibar and Donostia for over one hundred years. Currently, one side of the station serves as the southern terminus of Bilbao's Tramway operated by Euskotren Tranbia. The station is located in the neighbourhood of Atxuri, part of the Ibaiondo district, in Bilbao. The main building of the former station serves as headquarters for the Basque Railways. It opened in 1912.  History  The station of Bilbao- Atxuri, originally known simply as Achuri station, was designed by Basque- Irish architect Manuel Mar√≠a Smith. The station opened in 1912 and was built to replace a smaller former station that stood originally in the same place. The original station had been designed by Basque architect Sabino Goicoechea as the head of line of the Bilbao-Durango railway, operated by the Compa√±√≠a del Ferrocarril Central de Vizcaya (Central Railway of Biscay Company). In 1906 the company was acquired by the Ferrocarriles Vascongados (Basque Country Railways), which meant the station would also become the start of line for services running to Elgoibar, San Sebasti√°n, Zumarraga and other cities and towns across Gipuzkoa. This expansion required a bigger station, which Ferrocarriles Vascongados commissioned and was opened in 1912. The new building would not only hold the terminus station of the railway services, but also the headquarters of the Ferrocarriles Vascongados, as well as a bell tower, something unusual at the time. Under Ferrocarriles Vascongados, Achuri station served as the terminus station of services to Bermeo and San Sebasti√°n, with connections towards Elorrio, Zumarraga and Vitoria-Gasteiz along the line. In 1977 the entire Ferrocarriles Vascongados network would become part of FEVE, the state-owned company for narrow-gauge railways, which was soon thereafter transferred to the Basque Government to form the Basque Railways in 1982. The station was then renamed Bilbao-Atxuri, following the modern conventions of Basque orthography. In 1983 the station suffered extensive damage on its lower floor due to a flooding of the Bilbao estuary, which also destroyed the train depots. The station remained unchanged until the year 2002, when due to the opening of Bilbao's Tramway new depots fit for tramways were constructed, as well as a tram stop in one of the sides. After the opening of the Line 3 of Metro Bilbao in 2017, it was announced that all services operated by Euskotren Trena would be diverted towards the more centric station of Zazpikaleak, putting an end to the railway activity of the station. The transfer of railway line was progressive until September 2019, when the last line was transferred. Since then the station holds no railway activity and serves only as the headquarters of the Basque Railways. Nevertheless, one side of the station is used as the southern terminus of Bilbao's Tramway. In the future, works are expected to take place inside the station's building, as the tramway line is expected to be extended all the way to Kukullaga. The renewal works are expected to begin in late 2019.  Station layout  Platforms. The station is an at-grade station with a large entrance facing Atxuri street. The main hall of the station is spacious and includes ticketing machines a waiting area as well as a small store. During the times as part of Ferrocarriles Vascongados it also included a restaurant. The station also serves the southern terminus for Bilbao's Tramway, including an at-grade platform and single track on one side of the building. The main hall also includes access to the headquarters of the Basque Railways (located on the upper floors) and to the main train platforms. Since the closure of the station in September 2019, the main building is not accessible by the public.  Access  * 20px 20px 6 Atxuri St.  Services   Former rail services  When the station first opened in 1912 it served as the terminus for the Bilbao-Durango railway, and new services to other Basque cities were included after the merging of several railway companies to create the Ferrocarriles Vascongados. After the creation of the Basque Railways, Bilbao- Atxuri served as the terminus station for all commuter and regional rail services offered by EuskoTren, including the former lines 1, 1D and 3, connecting to the cities of San Sebasti√°n, Gernika, Eibar and others.Old Euskotren Schedules (Official Website) After the opening of Metro Bilbao's Line 3, operated by Euskotren Trena, the trains coming from all destinations except from the Urdaibai line were rerouted through the new underground route that connects directly with Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo station in central Bilbao from Kukullaga, bypassing Bolueta and Atxuri stations completely.  Tram services  Tram stop. Bilbao-Atxuri is the southern terminus of Bilbao's Tramway, a light rail tram connecting the district of Ibaiondo, mainly the old town, with Abando, the Guggenheim museum and the San Mam√©s area. The tramway line was opened in December, 2002.  Bus  The station is served by the following local Bilbobus services. A 'G' in the line name denotes a Gautxori night line service. *40 Santutxu - Biribila Plaza *77 Pe√±ascal - Mina del Morro *G7 Mina del Morro - Biribila Plaza The station is also served by the following regional Bizkaibus services, running to other municipalities within the Bilbao metropolitan area or elsewhere in Biscay. *A3613 Bilbao - Ugao- Miraballes - Orozko *A3622 Bilbao - Basauri - Zaratamo *A3918 Bilbao - Orozko  Future  After the opening of the Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo station for Euskotren Trena, most commuter trains coming from inner Biscay and Gipuzkoa were diverted toward the newer, more centric station, in consequence leaving Bilbao-Atxuri station with little commuter rail traffic. While the original operational plan for Euskotren Trena involved the diversion of all E4 trains coming from Gernika and Bermeo to the new station in early 2018, the changes were delayed at least until 2019 to avoid leaving the commuter rail section of the station without any services, which in turn would also affect Bolueta station. The Basque Government and the administration of the rail network, Euskal Trenbide Sarea (ETS), announced in 2003 the intention of transforming the rail road section between Bilbao-Atxuri, Bolueta and Etxebarri into a tramway line, thus continuing the existing Bilbao tramway service which currently has its terminus at Bilbao-Atxuri, however not many actions have been taken towards this objective. In early 2017 the plan was brought back by the administration and some studies were conducted The renewal works were commissioned in November 2019.

It is located where the northern fringe of the Sahara meets the southern edge of the Saharan Atlas Mountains, on the route linking Algiers with central Africa. The oasis (625 acres [253 hectares]) was probably settled in the 11th century after the Ban≈´ HilƒÅl invaders, supported by the FƒÅ·π≠imids of Egypt, crossed the area. Laghouat subsequently passed through Moroccan and Turkish hands and was divided by two warring groups representing the Ouled Serrine and Hallaf peoples. The oasis, taken and united by the French in 1852, reverted to Algeria in 1962. It is one of four major population centres in the region; the others are the seminomads‚Äô market town of Aflou and the M æzab and el-Golea oases groups. Laghouat lies on the Wadi Mzi (Wadi Djedi in its lower course), built on two hills that are northward extensions of Mount Tizigarine. The modern quarter, on the southern hill, contains the administrative and military installations. The old section, on the northern hill, retains its Saharan-style architecture and is the location of the cathedral of the bishop of the Sahara. Three dams on the Wadi Mzi irrigate date palms, fruit trees, vegetables, and cereals. Laghouat is known for its woven wall hangings and knotted woolen carpets. Pop.

Beginning with bible and literacy classes in December 1865, it was the second university established for African Americans following the end of the civil war, and the second oldest historically black college and university (HBCU) in the Southern United States, as well as one of the oldest co-educational universities in the country. When the institute moved into a new building in 1871, it was renamed as Shaw Collegiate Institute in honor of a major donor. Tupper served as the University's first president from its founding until his death in 1893. Early life and military career Henry Martin Tupper was born on April 11, 1831 to Earl and Permellia Norris Tupper and raised on a farm in Monson, Massachusetts. He was the eldest of nine children. His grandfather, Ezra Tupper, and great-grandfather, William Tupper, had both fought for the colonies in the American Revolutionary War. His paternal ancestry has been linked to a family of prominent Lutheran dissenters who left Germany and settled in England during the reign of Henry VIII. He was a distant relative of Martin Farquhar Tupper, an English poet of the 19th century. Clergyman Thomas Tupper, an ancestor of Henry Martin Tupper, emigrated from England to Barbados in the early 17th century. He later helped found the town of Sandwich, Massachusetts. Neither of his parents were practicing Christians nor did Martin attend church as a child. He received little formal education until he turned eighteen, when he enrolled in Monson Academy. He converted to Christianity while at the Academy. In order to fund his continuing education, he took a job as a school teacher in New Jersey, where he was baptised in a nearby Baptist church. Later he joined a congregation in Wales, Massachusetts, near his hometown of Monson. Tupper attended Amherst College and graduated in 1859. He received his divinity degree from Newton Theological Institute in 1862. While at school, he organized bible studies for African-American youth. He also worked as a missionary among recent immigrants in Boston as part of his training. He had planned to serve as a missionary to Africa, however the Civil War intervened. Shortly after being ordained as a minister, he enlisted in the Union Army. Though his education would have qualified him for a military commission, there were no openings in the officer corps, so he enlisted as a soldier. Tupper was assigned to the Army of the Potomac, Ninth Corps, under the command of Ambrose Burnside. He participated in the Battle of Fredericksburg. He was transferred to General Sherman's Fifteenth Corps in time for the Vicksburg Campaign. He was injured at the Battle of Jackson. Though Tupper was not an officer, he frequently served as a chaplain, ministering to sick and injured soldiers, and organizing prayer meetings and bible studies among soldiers. While in the army, he became acquainted with the plight of African-American slaves. This inspired his later work. Marriage and family On January 25, 1864 he married Sarah Baker Leonard of Stafford, Connecticut. She later joined him in his work, helping teach freedwomen as he taught the men. They had two children, Elizabeth Caroline and Edward Leonard Tupper. Sarah's older brother Judson Wade Leonard, a successful businessman in woolen textiles, helped support Shaw University financially. The medical school was named for him. Founder and president of Shaw University After the Civil War, Tupper was commissioned by the Home Mission Society to act as a missionary to freed slaves in the American South. Discharged from the Union Army on July 14, 1865, he and his wife Sarah departed for Raleigh, North Carolina on October 1 to begin his work. Traveling via train through Portsmouth, Virginia, they had delays due to extensive damage to the rail network caused by the Civil War; they arrived in Raleigh on October 10. The Tuppers began working among the freedmen. He procured food and clothing from the Freedman's Bureau to help support the many homeless black men in Raleigh. On December 1, 1865, Tupper began teaching bible study classes to freedmen in the Guion Hotel (located where the North Carolina Museum of History is now located). This first bible class marks the traditional foundation date of Shaw University. He used the class as an opportunity to teach the freedmen to read and write, encouraging them to become Baptist ministers, and start their own congregations. In March 1866, Sarah Tupper began teaching freedwomen in similar classes. Shaw University medical students, 1889 Having outgrown his temporary location at the Guion Hotel, Tupper purchased a plot of land, using $500 saved from his military service. On the plot, located at the corner of Blount and Cabarrus streets in Raleigh, he constructed a two-story timber building to serve as both a school and church. He named this the Raleigh Institute; it was the first permanent home what would develop as Shaw University. The Home Mission Society and the Freedman's Bureau jointly provided funding for the Institute. As the school grew, Tupper searched for more space. Nearby to the south was the estate of Paul Barringer, the patriarch of a prominent North Carolina political dynasty. When the land came up for sale, Martin Tupper raised $13,000 for its purchase, mostly from private donors solicited personally by Tupper. The largest single donor was Elijah Shaw, a resident of Wales, Massachusetts, who donated $5,000. In his honor, the first building on the new campus was named Shaw Hall, and the school was renamed the Shaw Collegiate Institute. Tupper and his students and faculty moved into their new location in 1871. Expansion proceeded quickly, as the first men's dormitory opened in 1872, and the first women's dormitory, Estey Hall (named for another Northern benefactor, Jacob Estey of Brattleboro, Vermont), opened in 1874. Under Tupper's leadership, the school became chartered by the state as a university in 1875. It added a medical and pharmacy program (Leonard Medical School) in 1881, and a law program in 1888. Each of these programs were the first of their kind for African-American students. Note: Howard University, a historically black university, dates its law school to 1869, when a law department was established by John Mercer Langston.\\"Howard University School of Law\\" , Quote: \\"Howard University School of Law started as Howard University Law Department on January 6, 1869 under the leadership of Professor John Mercer Langston.\\" Along with two students, Nicholas Franklin Roberts and Edward Hart Lipscomb, Tupper was an editor of the quarterly journal, African Expositor, founded in 1878A New Quarterly, The Observer (Raleigh, North Carolina), September 14, 1878, page 3, accessed September 9, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6565929/a_new_quarterly_the_observer_raleigh/ Tupper's role as the founder of the first university dedicated to educating freedmen attracted opposition. During the Reconstruction era, his home was burned to the ground by the Ku Klux Klan. He and his wife fled and hid in a nearby cornfield. In 1870 the trustees of the local Second Baptist Church of Raleigh sued Tupper on charges of defrauding its members in relation to his fundraising for Shaw College. The suit was settled in his favor in 1875. Death Tupper died on November 12, 1893 following a prolonged illness. His funeral was reportedly one of the most attended in the history of Raleigh to that time. Tupper was buried on the campus in front of Shaw Hall.

This abelian group is a Klein four-group-module, where the group acts by reflection in each of the coordinate directions (here depicted by red and blue arrows intersecting at the identity element). In mathematics, given a group G, a G-module is an abelian group M on which G acts compatibly with the abelian group structure on M. This widely applicable notion generalizes that of a representation of G. Group (co)homology provides an important set of tools for studying general G-modules. The term G-module is also used for the more general notion of an R-module on which G acts linearly (i.e. as a group of R-module automorphisms). Definition and basics Let G be a group. A left G-module consists of. an abelian group M together with a left group action œÅ: G √ó M ‚Üí M such that :g¬∑(a + b) = g¬∑a + g¬∑b where g¬∑a denotes œÅ(g,a). A right G-module is defined similarly. Given a left G-module M, it can be turned into a right G-module by defining a¬∑g = g‚àí1¬∑a. A function f : M ‚Üí N is called a morphism of G-modules (or a G-linear map, or a G-homomorphism) if f is both a group homomorphism and G-equivariant. The collection of left (respectively right) G-modules and their morphisms form an abelian category G-Mod (resp. Mod-G). The category G-Mod (resp. Mod-G) can be identified with the category of left (resp. right) ZG-modules, i.e. with the modules over the group ring Z[G]. A submodule of a G-module M is a subgroup A ‚äÜ M that is stable under the action of G, i.e. g¬∑a ‚àà A for all g ‚àà G and a ‚àà A. Given a submodule A of M, the quotient module M/A is the quotient group with action g¬∑(m + A) = g¬∑m + A. Examples *Given a group G, the abelian group Z is a G-module with the trivial action g¬∑a = a. *Let M be the set of binary quadratic forms f(x, y) = ax2 \\\\+ 2bxy + cy2 with a, b, c integers, and let G = SL(2, Z) (the 2√ó2 special linear group over Z). Define ::(g\\\\cdot f)(x,y)=f((x,y)g^t)=f((x,y)\\\\cdot\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\alpha & \\\\gamma \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta & \\\\delta \\\\end{bmatrix})=f(\\\\alpha x+\\\\beta y,\\\\gamma x+\\\\delta y), :where ::g=\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\alpha & \\\\beta \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma & \\\\delta \\\\end{bmatrix} :and (x, y)g is matrix multiplication. Then M is a G-module studied by Gauss. Indeed, we have :: g(h(f(x,y)) = gf((x,y)h^t)=f((x,y)h^tg^t)=f((x,y)(gh)^t)=(gh)f(x,y). *If V is a representation of G over a field K, then V is a G-module (it is an abelian group under addition). Topological groups If G is a topological group and M is an abelian topological group, then a topological G-module is a G-module where the action map G√óM ‚Üí M is continuous (where the product topology is taken on G√óM). In other words, a topological G-module is an abelian topological group M together with a continuous map G√óM ‚Üí M satisfying the usual relations g(a + a‚Ä≤) = ga + ga‚Ä≤, (gg‚Ä≤)a = g(g‚Ä≤a), and 1a = a.

Life and career Lady Spencer was born Karen Villeneuve on 30 November 1972 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, the eldest of three children. Her father‚Äôs job as a National Parks administrator took the family to 23 homes and 10 schools during her childhood; Spencer has credited this experience as the foundation for her interest in helping children without a stable home. Spencer was motivated to launch the nonprofit organization Whole Child International, which targets the largely overlooked emotional needs of society‚Äôs most at-risk children, after attending a 2004 parenting class that introduced the dynamic child-rearing approach of Emmi Pikler. In the years that followed, she and her team developed a cost- effective, sustainable, and scalable program, with a particular emphasis on relationship-based childcare, to provide the tools vulnerable children need to become productive members of society. Whole Child is currently implementing programs with funding from USAID, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Korean Poverty Reduction Fund, and other significant donors such as David G. Booth, the Annenberg Foundation, and the Pamella and Daniel DeVos Foundation. In February 2010, the 14th Dalai Lama came to lend his personal support to Whole Child at the launch of its global initiative to raise awareness of the plight of institutionalized children.

Since opening in 2004, it has become home to several more giant pandas. This includes the U.S.-born Hua Mei and Mei Sheng, who were relocated there after the May 12, 2008, Sichuan earthquake severely damaged the panda breeding center at the Wolong National Nature Reserve. Both facilities are managed by the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda. The Vienna Zoo-born male panda Fu Long (b. 2007) was relocated to Bifengxia in November, 2009. On February 5, 2010, Bifengxia became home to Tai Shan, who was born at the National Zoo in Washington D.C. Later that year, Su Lin and Zhen Zhen from the San Diego Zoo were also moved here. In 2008, there were 13 baby pandas surviving in the Bifengxia Base. On February 12, 2009, the base held a simple ceremony for these small ones as they attended the panda kindergarten.

The command accepts a printf format string, which specifies methods for formatting items, and a list of items to be formatted. Named historically after the intention of printing to a printer, it now actually outputs to stdout. Characters in the format string are copied to the output or, if a \`%\` is encountered, are used to format an item. In addition to the standard formats, \`%b\` causes printf to expand backslash escape sequences (for example \` \` for newline), and \`%q\` outputs an item that can be used as shell input. The format string is reused if there are more items than format specs. Unused format specs provide a zero value or null string.

Stephen Colbert ate one on The Colbert Report, spurring the item's popularity even more. Oceania KFC Australia started selling the Double Down (renamed The Double) with the tagline \\"make time for mantime\\" on March 30, 2011, for a limited time only.

Both the grilled and fried Double Down products have nearly a full day's worth of sodium according to the American Heart Association's guidelines. A Los Angeles Times reviewer pointed out that the grilled chicken Double Down has fewer calories and less fat than the fried chicken Double Down (460 versus 540 calories, and 23 g versus 32 g fat) but that the grilled chicken option has more sodium (1,430 mg versus 1,380). The L.A. Times article also noted that both Double Downs have fewer calories than Burger King's TenderCrisp chicken sandwich, which has 800 calories. Sales From its April 12, 2010 nationwide launch through early July, a KFC spokesperson reported that the chain had sold 10 million units for a total of about US$50 million in revenue. An analyst said that figure accounts for 5% of KFC's sales in that time period, a figure insubstantial to KFC's financial bottom line. In Canada, the Double Down became KFC's best-selling new menu item ever, selling over 350,000 units in less than 10 days. Despite sales in excess of one million units, KFC Canada discontinued the Double Down in 2010, reviving it again for a short period in 2011. In August 2015, KFC Canada brought back the Double Down for a small period of time. Sales in New Zealand were 600,000 units over its five-week promotion. Grant Ellis, CFO of New Zealand KFC operator Restaurant Brands, said that despite these sales the Double Down \\"did cannibalise some of our better-margin products.\\" Following the launch of Zinger Double Down in Korea, the overall sales for KFC Korea increased by 20%.

History  Before World War II, ≈†entvid and Viƒç were connected to the center of Ljubljana by a tramway. After May 1957, there was a gradual discontinuation of the tram service and former tramway routes. During an interim period of a week, the ≈†entvid ‚Äì Ajdov≈°ƒçina and Viƒç ‚Äì Ajdov≈°ƒçina stations were serviced by trolleybus route 1, Vi≈æmarje ‚Äì Viƒç. The last day of operations for the former tram service was 4 September 1971. After this date, buses commenced operation on the new route: Vi≈æmarje ‚Äì Mestni log. In the city center, buses initially crossed the Bavarski Dvor locality. In the early 20th century, the former turnout of today's Krimska bus stop was moved to Koper Street, where it remains today. In October 2003, the night route 1a extended to Mestni log (Brod ‚Äì Bavarski dvor ‚Äì Mestni log) over the Bavarski dvor in both directions, with the last journey starting at 30 minutes past midnight. In July of the following year, the route returned to its old operating timetable (Bavarski dvor ‚Äì Brod). The route was extended to Brod on Sundays in the summer of 2004, when route 8 stopped operating on Sundays. Routes to Avtosejem () had already been introduced several years earlier. In autumn 2007, night route 1a was re-numbered to line N1; the Sunday extension to Brod was re-numbered to line 1B and the extension to () was re- numbered to line 1S. The bus routes were not altered by the \\"number changes\\". On 26 June 2008, lines 26, 26B, and 26C were discontinued and lines 1B, 1S, N1, and 8 were extended to Gameljne. On 28 June 2010, operating hours on line N1 were extended with the first departure from Bavarski dvor at 02:50 on weekdays and Saturdays. Furthermore, the operating hours on Sundays were extended until 03:50; public holiday operating hours were changed to end at 00:20.

The Salonpas Pain Relief Patch and Salonpas Arthritis Pain patches are manufactured using what Hisamitsu calls \\"comfort stretch\\" technology that provides effective pain relief while allowing patients to maintain daily activities and, an alternative for those who prefer to avoid the use of oral OTC pain-relief medication for minor aches and pains. The company differentiates its products from oral medications because the active ingredients in Salonpas patches are absorbed through the skin and go directly to the site of the pain.  FDA approval  In February 2008, the FDA approved a New Drug Application (NDA) covering Salonpas Pain Relief Patch and Salonpas Arthritis Pain, topical pain-relieving patches. These patches contain recognized analgesic ingredients (menthol, methyl salicylate) called counterirritants, which when applied to the skin, diminish pain signals under areas to which they are administered. To date, the Salonpas Pain Relief Patch and Salonpas Arthritis Pain patch are the only external analgesic patches subject to an approved NDA and sold into the over-the- counter health care market. The effectiveness of the Salonpas Pain Relief Patch and Salonpas Arthritis Pain patch have been established in a randomized controlled trial that was performed by Hisamitsu employees.

Conservation and curation of artifacts Lab technician cataloging artifactUAB operates a state-of-the-art Archaeology & Conservation Laboratory as well as provides professional guidance to the Navy on conservation and curation of artifacts originating from an underwater environment. The branch inventories, conserves, curates, and provides access to an artifact collection of over 2000 artifacts for research, analysis, and museum exhibition. It also maintains an archaeological artifact loan program with over 7200 artifacts currently on loan to national and international museums.UAB Conservation and Curation The UAB Laboratory also functions as an environmentally-controlled curatorial repository for Navy's recovered artifacts that are not on loan to museums or other institutions. After removal from an underwater environment, the artifacts are in immediate danger due to the deteriorating effects of increased oxygen, temperature, light, and other atmospheric conditions. While artifacts are undergoing conservation in the laboratory, they are scientifically analyzed and thoroughly documented to prevent loss of information throughout the stabilization process. Even after they are stabilized, artifacts excavated from underwater sites require periodic monitoring and evaluation, as they are susceptible to fluctuations in their immediate environment. All collections are available for study, with research as its goal. Historic preservation and policy development Navy underwater archaeologists map early 19th century shipwreck The Branch develops, coordinates, reviews, advises, and implements policy related to the preservation and protection of Navy sunken military craft and Ensures Navy compliance with applicable federal laws. To this effect, it drafts cooperative agreements, state or regional management plans, legislation, regulations, and assists the Department of State and Department of Justice in international agreements and litigation claims involving both domestic and foreign sunken military craft. Under the Sunken Military Craft Act, the United States maintains ownership of any sunken military craft and its associated contents owned or operated by the government at the time of its sinking, regardless of the passage of time or location. As a result, it is illegal to disturb, remove, or injure sunken military craft, including navy wrecks, as well as foreign government historic wrecks located in U.S. waters, without permission.Division A, Title XIV of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 which was passed 2004UAB:Custody and management of shipwrecks As part of its management mandate, UAB also coordinates the protection of Navy sunken military craft as, besides their historical importance, many of them serve as war graves, carry unexploded ordnance, or may potentially raise environmental concerns. In addition to policy and laws, the UAB maintains a geographic information system and database of over 3,000 ship and 14,000 aircraft wrecks for management as well as prepares nominations for the National Register of Historic Places.National Register of Historic Places Outreach efforts and dissemination of information The UAB disseminates information to the Navy, the general public, and academia on Navy archaeology, conservation, history, and historic preservation policy via scientific and popular publications, lectures, the NHHC UAB web-site, in-person tours of the Archaeology & Conservation Laboratory, the artifact loan program, and underwater archaeological exhibits. The UAB also strives to support United States Naval Academy midshipmen training and student research.BHR Collaborators Vision Assessment of well- preserved WWII aircraft The Underwater Archaeology Branch, as the Department of the Navy's sole expertise on underwater cultural heritage, envisions the Navy's sunken ship and aircraft as a unique resource for interpreting the Navy's history and traditions through the science of underwater archaeology. The Navy's sunken military craft represent a non-renewable, fragile, and untapped repository for science, technology, and history. The Branch operates at the interface between policy, archaeology, history, cultural resource management, and marine science. As such, it is highly dependent upon multi- disciplinary cooperative relationships with federal, state and private programs, advances in technologies, and a variety of scientific disciplines. Priorities *The Underwater Archaeology Branch intends to augment and maintain its reputation as the Navy's center of expertise in all matters pertaining to underwater archaeology, conservation, historic preservation policy, and sunken military craft management. *Identify priority targets, conduct archaeological research, and produce educational products and publications on the Navy's historic wrecks. *Maintain a state-of-the-art conservation and curation laboratory. *Build cooperative relationships with other Navy Commands, federal agencies, academic institutions and private sector with the aim of preserving Navy's cultural heritage. *Educate the Navy and the public on the importance of preserving the Navy's underwater archaeological cultural heritage for present and future generations. *Fulfill the legal mandate regarding the management and preservation of the Navy's historic ship and aircraft wrecks.

It is a palimpsest containing a Latin text written over a Gothic one. The Gothic text is designated by siglum Car, the Latin text is designated by siglum gue (traditional system) or by 79 (on the list of Beuron), it represents the Old Latin translation of the New Testament. It is housed in the Herzog August Bibliothek. It is one of very few manuscripts of Wulfila's Gothic Bible.Manuscripts of Gothic Bible at the Wulfila Project The manuscript is fragmentary. The four leaves of the codex were used as raw material for the production of another manuscript ‚Äì Codex Guelferbytanus 64 Weissenburgensis. It is a palimpsest, and its text was reconstructed several times. Franz Anton Knittel was the first to examine it and decipher its text.  Description  The codex has survived to the present day in a very fragmentary condition. It contains only the text of the Epistle to the Romans 11-15 on four parchment leaves (size 26.5 cm by 21.5 cm). The text is written in two parallel columns, 27 lines per column. The left column is in Gothic, the right in Latin. ; Contents : Romans 11:33-12:5; 12:17-13:5; 14:9-20; 15:3-13. The text of the codex is not divided into chapters. The nomina sacra are used both in Gothic and Latin texts (ihm and ihu for \\"Iesum\\" and \\"Iesu\\"). All the abbreviations are marked with the superscript bar.Gothica Its text has some value in Romans 14:14 for Textual Criticism.George W. S. Friedrichsen, The Gothic Text of Rom. XIV 14 ( œÑŒπ Œ∫ŒøŒπŒΩŒøŒΩ ŒµŒπŒΩŒ±Œπ ), in Cod. Guelferbytanus, Weissenburg 64, JTS (Clarendon Press, 1937), pp. 245-247. It is a palimpsest, the whole book is known as Codex Guelferbytanus 64 Weissenburgensis. The upper text is in Latin, it contains Isidore of Seville's Origines and his six letters. The lower text of the codex belongs to several much earlier manuscripts, such as Codex Guelferbytanus A, Codex Guelferbytanus B, and Codex Carolinus.  History  Folio 256 verso with text of Romans 12:17-13:1; the Latin text is inverted The manuscript is dated palaeographically to the 6th century or 7th century. According to Tischendorf it was written in the 6th century.Tischendorf, Editio Octava maiora, vol. III, p. 1111. Probably it was written in Italy. Nothing is known about its early history. In the 12th or 13th century four of its leaves were used as material for another book and they were overwritten by Latin text. Its later story is linked with the codices Guelferbytanus A and B. Formerly the manuscript was held in Bobbio, Weissenburg, Mainz, and Prague. The Duke of Brunswick bought it in 1689. The manuscript became known to the scholars in the half of the 18th century, where it was found in the Ducal Library of Wolfenb√ºttel. The first description of the codex was made by Heusinger. Franz Anton Knittel (1721‚Äì1792) recognized two lower Greek texts of the New Testament in this palimpsest codex, and designated them by A and B, he recognized also the Gothic-Latin text (known later as Codex Carolinus). F. A. Knittel deciphered Gothic-Latin text of the Codex Carolinus and published it in 1762 at Brunswick. In his edition all abbreviated forms, Gothic and Latin, are written in full. It was published in Uppsala in 1763.F. A. Knittel, Fragmenta Versionis Ulphilanae, Upsaliae 1763. It was published again by Theodor Zahn. Knittel made many errors, especially in Latin text, he also did not decipher every word and left several lacunae in the reconstructed text (e.g. Romans 11:35; 12:2; 15:8). Tischendorf made a new and more accurate collation for the Latin text and edited in 1855. Tischendorf used abbreviations for the nomina sacra, he did not leave any lacunae. The new collation of the Gothic text was given by Carla Falluomini in 1999. The codex is located at the Herzog August Bibliothek (no. 4148) in Wolfenb√ºttel.

Founded in 2006, the company provides an automated cloud-based service for securing web, mobile and third-party enterprise applications. Veracode provides multiple security analysis technologies on a single platform, including static analysis, dynamic analysis, mobile application behavioral analysis and software composition analysis. On March 9, 2017, CA Technologies announced it was acquiring Veracode for approximately $614 million in cash, and the acquisition was completed on April 3, 2017. On July 11, 2018, Broadcom announced that it was acquiring Veracode parent CA Technologies for $18.9 billion in cash. The acquisition was completed on November 5, 2018, and Broadcom thus became the new owner of the Veracode business. On the same day, Thoma Bravo, a private equity firm headquartered in San Francisco, California, announced that it had agreed to acquire Veracode from Broadcom for $950 million cash. Overview Veracode was founded by Chris Wysopal and Christien Rioux, former engineers from @stake, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based security consulting firm known for employing former ‚Äúwhite hat‚Äù hackers from L0pht Heavy Industries. Much of Veracode's software was written by Rioux. In 2007, the company launched SecurityReview, a service which can be used to test code in order to find vulnerabilities that could lead to cybersecurity breaches or hacking. The service is intended to be used as an alternative to penetration testing, which involves hiring a security consultant to hack into a system. On November 29, 2011, the company announced that it had appointed Robert T. Brennan, former CEO of Iron Mountain Incorporated, as its new chief executive officer. The company issued a report on cybersecurity in June 2015. The report found that most sectors failed industry-standard security tests of their web and mobile applications and that government is the worst performing sector in regards to fixing security vulnerabilities. A report issued by the company in December 2015 found that \\"four out of five applications written in popular web scripting languages contain at least one of the critical risks in an industry-standard security benchmark.\\" As of 2014, Veracode's customers included three of the top four banks in the Fortune 100. Fortune reported in March 2015 that Veracode planned to file for an initial public offering (IPO) later that year in order to go public. However, the IPO did not occur, and Veracode was later acquired by CA Technologies. Funding Major investors in the company include .406 Ventures, Accomplice, STARVest Partners, and Meritech Capital Partners. In a funding round announced in September 2014, the firm raised in a late-stage investment led by Wellington Management Company with participation from existing investors. Reception In 2013, Veracode ranked 20th on the Forbes list of the Top 100 Most Promising Companies in America. Veracode was named one of the \\"20 Coolest Cloud Security Vendors of the 2014 Cloud 100\\" by CRN Magazine. Gartner named Veracode as a Leader for seven consecutive years (2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019) in Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing.

In November 2006, IRV achieved 69% voter approval. On January 5, 2010, the Oakland City Council voted to adopt IRV for its mayoral and council elections. In 2002 and 2006, Wells ran campaigns for state controller, Smartvoter.org receiving 419,873 votes in 2002, the most ever for a Green Party candidate in a statewide partisan race in California. Greenparty.org In 2009, Wells appeared on the Fox News program \\"Your World\\" several times to discuss tax fairness in California. Wells has also participated in ten international delegations to Canada and South America to study innovations in participatory democracy and new constitutions, and has broadly worked in a range of volunteer and professional capacities for community and labor organizations, including Pesticide Action Network (North America), Women's Economic Agenda Project, and SEIU United Healthcare Workers (West). She co-founded Green Focus, a party newspaper. 2010 campaign for California governor In January 2010, Laura Wells announced her candidacy for governor of California in the 2010 election.Chang, Jack. \\"The Sacramento Bee\\" Saturday January 16, 2010 Wells won the Green Party primary on June 8, 2010 with over 78% of the votes. California Secretary of State, Debra Bowen, Tuesday June 8th, 2010 Semi-official Election Results Wells' campaign emphasized the California budget and tax issues, particularly Proposition 13, passed during Jerry Brown's tenure as governor, which she says must be changed, in part because it primarily benefits corporations over individuals. In a position paper on Proposition 13, Wells wrote: > Prop. 13, in 1978, was promoted to California voters as a way to reduce > taxes and to stop fixed-income seniors and others from losing their homes > due to escalating property taxes. Since then, the bulk of the \\"tax relief\\" > goes places the voters never intended--giant corporations. Corporate > properties are rarely re-assessed since corporations don't die and seldom > sell.Wells, Laura Smartvoter.org, Position Paper, 2002 Candidate for > Controller; State of California Wells also favored lowering the margin needed to pass a budget and raise taxes in the state from two-thirds to a simple majority. She supported increasing funding for education, and the use of a 'split-roll tax' to keep cap residential property taxes while allowing higher property taxes for businesses. In a January 2010 interview with The Sacramento Bee discussing her views on taxes and the budget in California, Wells stated: > The two parties, the Democrat and Republican parties, do not address the > root causes of the problem,\\" Wells said. \\"That's off the table for them. ... > To get what we want and to have the revenue that pays for it we need to have > a budget that makes sense. Wells has also addressed the difficulty that third parties have in running candidates for state elections: > ... she says [the difficulty for third parties] is a result of the \\"locked- > down\\" system the Democrats and Republicans have put in place. As a case in > point, she said she had to pay $6,000 for a 300-word ballot statement when > she ran for state controller in 2006, a fee she said blocks minor-party > candidates from running.Chang, Jack. \\"The Sacramento Bee\\" Capitol Alert, > Friday January 15, 2010 Wells supports a Single Payer Universal Health Care solution for California, and if given the opportunity, says that she would gladly sign SB 840 (the Single Payer bill introduced by State Senator Sheila Kuehl) into law. LauraWells.org, Platform Wells also supports the use of clean, sustainable, local energy, including publicly owned utilities, Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) and localized (distributed) electricity generation, instead of nuclear power or carbon sequestration. LauraWells.org, Platform Wells also opposes government bailouts of large corporations and banks and proposes the creation of a State Bank for California which could partner with local banks and credit unions, and potentially improve their ability to lend. LauraWells.org, Platform Other Green Party candidates, such as the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial candidate Rich Whitney, also support a State Bank proposal. Wells has been endorsed by San Francisco for Democracy sf4democracy.org and numerous elected officials, described at her campaign website. Arrested at debates On October 12, 2010, Laura Wells was given a ticket to watch the California gubernatorial debate at Dominican University in San Rafael by a friend of hers and used it to enter the building. Wells was initially allowed in, but upon being recognized as the Green Party gubernatorial candidate, she was approached by security and asked to surrender the ticket on the grounds that it was not issued to her, but to her friend. When she refused to surrender the ticket, she was handcuffed and taken from the building and put into a police car, and arrested for \\"trespassing at a private party\\". She was later released. Wells stated: > Republicans and Democrats will go to any lengths, even arresting candidates, > to keep the truth from California voters. There are solutions, but voters > aren't being allowed to hear from independent candidates.

Plot Set in a small Australian town during the interwar period, the film follows the battle between two children, Scott, a poor farm boy, and Josie, the handicapped daughter of a wealthy ranch owner, for ownership of a horse that both children love. Scott requires a horse to ride seven miles to school today and his father buys an unbroken pony, which Scott names Taff. Josie yearns to ride again but, being afflicted with polio two years ago, must settle on the use of a cart and pony. Scott's pony disappears, while a pony is eventually selected for Josie from her father's herd. When Scott sees the horse, which Josie named Bo, performing in the pony and cart competition at the township fair, he recognizes it as his horse and attempts to take it away. The ensuing quarrel affects both the children as well as dividing the town. The children eventually become friends and, while the ownership issue is legally resolved, they agree on a way of sharing the pony between them.

However, the producer, Jerome Courtland, determined that an Australian background would not detract from the film's potential for success in the US. As a result, the film was not only set in Australia, but employed a largely Australian-based cast. Shooting began in October 1974 and mostly took place in the small town of Chiltern, Victoria. There was also some filming in the small country town of Bingara, New South Wales, where some of the cast and crew, including John Meillon, stayed at the Imperial Hotel for around 3 months. Several different Welsh mountain ponies were used in the film's production. Reception The film opened on Christmas Day, 1975 at the Fine Arts theatre in Los Angeles and grossed $9,000 in its first week. In 1976, The New York Times criticized the film as a \\"fundamentally uneventful and somewhat padded story\\", while in 1987 in a review for the film's video release it wrote that the film \\"was well acted, by adults, youngsters and pony...a film that children ‚Äì and their parents ‚Äì should certainly enjoy.\\" Also in 1976, The Blade wrote that the film \\"combines an intelligent script, a generally excellent cast, and good production values in a film with broad appeal.\\" The Daily Collegian also praised the film, saying that it contained \\"a refreshing amount of realism, and an emotional subtelty that is unusual for a Disney film.\\" See also * List of American films of 1975 *Cinema of Australia References External links   Ride a Wild Pony at Oz Movies Category:1975 films Category:American films Category:Walt Disney Pictures films Category:1970s adventure films Category:Films set in Australia Category:Films about horses Category:Films directed by Don Chaffey Category:Films based on children's books Category:Films scored by John Addison ","title":"Ride a Wild Pony"},{"id":"26069184","text":"Ouled Fares is a town and commune in Chlef Province, Algeria.
