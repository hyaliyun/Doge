He received the Order of the Rising Sun from the Emperor of Japan. Early life The eldest son of Sultan Alaeddin (1863‚Äì1938) by his royal consort Tengku Ampuan Maharum binti Raja Muda Tunku Dziauddin of Kedah was born in Istana Temasya Jugra, Kuala Langat. His name at birth was Tengku Musa Eddin. Educated privately, he was made Tengku Mahkota in 1903.Buyong Adil, 1971, Sejarah Selangor He succeeded his father's great-uncle Raja Laut bin Sultan Muhammad as Raja Muda or Crown Prince of Selangor in 1920.Buyong Adil, 1971, Sejarah Selangor An intelligent young man, he represented his father on the State Council established by the British colonial authority. However, at the instigation of the British Resident, Theodore Samuel Adams (1885‚Äì1961; in office 1935 - 1937), Tengku Musa Eddin was dismissed as Raja Muda in 1934 for alleged \\"misbehaviour\\". Adams had accused Tengku Musa Eddin as a spendthrift and wastrel with a penchant for gambling. However, many Malays in Selangor believed the real reason for Tengku Musa Eddin's dismissal was his refusal to follow Adam's orders.Buyong Adil, op cit Although Sultan Sulaiman pleaded for the case of Tengku Musa Eddin (even petitioning the Secretary of State for the Colonies and discussing the issue directly with him in London), Tengku Alam Shah was instead proclaimed Raja Muda or heir to the throne over the head of his other half-brother Tengku Badar.Willan, HC (7 October 1945) Interview with the Malay Rulers CAB 101/69, CAB/HIST/B/4/7 The appointment occurred on 20 July 1936.Buyong Adil, op cit Tengku Musa Eddin was given the title of Tengku Kelana Jaya Putera, ironically the title for the heir-apparent of the Yang di- Pertuan Muda (or Under-King) of Johor and Riau, from which the Sultans of Selangor are descended. Tengku Alam Shah was proclaimed Sultan on 4 April 1938, four days after the death of his father. On 26 January 1939, he was crowned at Istana Mahkota Puri Negara in Klang. Tengku Musa Eddin presided over the ceremony with no ill feelings.Buyong Adil, op cit During the Japanese occupation of Malaya, on 15 January 1942, Col. Fujiyama, the Japanese Military Governor of Selangor, invited Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah to King's House in Kuala Lumpur. In an interview with Major-General Minaki the Sultan confessed that he had made speeches in support of the British war efforts but had been persuaded by the British resident to do so. After being told to surrender the regalia to his older brother, the Japanese removed Sultan Hisamuddin and in November 1943, proclaimed Tengku Musa Eddin as the new Sultan of Selangor, taking the regnal name Sultan Musa Ghiatuddin Riayat Shah.Willan, HC (7 October 1945) Interview with the Malay Rulers CAB 101/69, CAB/HIST/B/4/7 Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah declined to work with the Japanese and from 1943, refused their allowance awarded to him and his children.Buyong Adil, op cit After the war, Sultan Musa in turn was dethroned by the British Military Administration under Lord Louis Mountbatten upon the return of that colonial power to Malaya in 1945. Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah was installed again as Sultan of Selangor. Death Sultan Musa was exiled to the Cocos Keeling Islands. Subsequently, he fell ill and was brought back to Selangor a few months before he died on 8 November 1955 in Kuala Lumpur. Sultan Musa was buried beside his father at the Royal Mausoleum in Klang. His consort, Syarifah Mastura Shahabuddin of Kedah, became Tengku Permaisuri or Queen during his brief reign. She died in 1958. The couple had no children.

It had a population of 1,004 in the 2001 Census, rising to 1,069 at the 2011 Census, by which time the number of households has increased by about 20% (according to Shropshire Council Tax data). The name means \\"boundary\\" in ancient Celtic or Anglo-Saxon (\\"Oure\\"), and this fits nicely with the fact that it is on the boundary with both the counties of Cheshire and Staffordshire. The parish is the most northerly in Shropshire. Location The civil parish includes several other hamlets and villages including Gravenhunger, Dorrington, Pipe Gate, Bearstone, part of Onneley (the remainder being in the neighbouring Staffordshire Parish of Madeley) and Ireland's Cross. The nearest significant towns to Woore are Market Drayton, Whitchurch, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Nantwich and Crewe. The A51 and A525 roads run through the village, the A51 being the old London - Chester post road. (Changes of horses used to be available at the former Swan Inn, now flats, in the centre of Woore itself.) The only road links between Woore and the rest of Shropshire pass through adjoining counties. The village is also the farthest place in Shropshire from the centre of the county near Cantlop. History The Domesday Book (1086) entry for Woore (‚ÄúWaure‚Äù) shows that the manor was held not from Earl Roger of Shrewsbury, but as a tenant-in-chief from the King, by William Malbedeng (William Malbank), and contained a large hall within the moated site at what is now Syllenhurst Farm. Lying in the Hundred of Hodnet, there were 5 households in Woore itself, the value of which to the Lord was assessed for tax at 5 shillings, with woodland for 60 pigs. William Malbank also held land at Dorrington (2 households with land for 3 ploughlands, woodland for 100 pigs, valued at 4 shillings), Gravenhunger (2 households with land for 4 ploughlands, valued at 6 shillings) and Onneley (no households, valued at less than 2 shillings). He had succeeded a pre-Conquest Saxon Lord, Edric. In later medieval times the most notable family of Woore was the de Bulkeleys. Racecourse The village had a National Hunt racecourse until 1963, served by Pipe Gate railway station in the south of the parish, which was closed under the Beeching \\"Axe\\". Modern day Bridgemere Garden World is to the north of Woore, just over the border in Cheshire. The village today is mostly residential with a number of small shops, centred on the Post Office and general stores on the village square. Two public houses service the village, along with one modern red brick primary school and two churches, the smaller of which is a Methodist church, popularly known as \\"the Chapel on the corner\\", and the larger of which is St. Leonard's Church of England parish church. The parish council has 10 elected members, and normally meets monthly, on the first Monday of the month. Woore Cricket Club play at the Falcon Field in the village, which slopes downwards dramatically from the Pavilion and Falcon Inn sides.Woore Cricket Club St Leonard's Church St. Leonard's church was constructed in about 1830-31, to serve what were then five townships of the Shropshire portion of the ancient parish of Mucklestone in Staffordshire, and is of an unconventional white plaster Italianate design. A Grade II listed building, it was repainted in 2011. Designed by George Hamilton of Stone, the bell tower is an Edwardian addition by Chapman and Snape of Newcastle-under-Lyme. The tower has not been safe to regularly ring in since the late 1980s, with the bells now replaced by a timed recording. The churchyard contains a war grave of a British soldier of World War I. CWGC Casualty record. Transport Woore no longer has bus services as it was previously served by a bus connecting the village with Hanley, Staffordshire and Nantwich. the service ceased in 2015. Now the nearby village of Buerton has bus links to Nantwich, Whitchurch (Shropshire) and Audlem. The other is the village of Madeley (Staffordshire) which provides links to Newcastle- Under-Lyme, Crewe and Stoke-on-Trent. There was no railway in Woore but there was a station in the small village of Pipe Gate which was on the now-closed Stoke-Market Drayton Line. The station closed in 1957 along with the section to Market Drayton but the line from Silverdale to Pipe Gate remained open to serve both a creamery and as a loop back to the mainline at Madeley Chord until 1998 when the entire line closed after closure of Silverdale Colliery. The line has been mothballed and the bridge demolished. The station masters house survives as a private residence but the station site is now a timber yard. Part of the embankment is still present but the section towards Market Drayton is built on by a new housing development. This doesn't however hinder possible future proposals for reopening of the line.

The unconventional approach was to mount the two engines within the fuselage driving a pair of contra-rotating propellers mounted at the tail in a pusher configuration, leaving the wing and fuselage clean and free of drag-inducing protrusions. Two prototype aircraft were built, but the end of World War II changed priorities and the advent of the jet engine gave an alternative way toward achieving high speed. Design and development The XB-42 was developed initially as a private venture; an unsolicited proposal was presented to the United States Army Air Forces in May 1943. This resulted in an Air Force contract for two prototypes and one static test airframe, the USAAF seeing an intriguing possibility of finding a bomber capable of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress's range without its size or cost. The aircraft mounted a pair of Allison V-1710-125 liquid-cooled V-12 engines behind the crew's cabin, each driving one of the twin propellers. Air intakes were in the wing leading edge. The landing gear was tricycle and a full, four surface cruciform tail was fitted, whose ventral fin/rudder unit prevented the coaxial propellers from striking the ground. The pilot and co-pilot sat under twin bubble canopies, and the bombardier sat in the extreme front behind a plexiglass nose.Winchester 2005, p. 27. Defensive armament consisted of two 0.50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns each side in the trailing edge of the wing, which retracted into the wing when not in use. These guns were aimed by the copilot through a sighting station at the rear of his cockpit. The guns had a limited field of fire and could only cover the rear, but with the aircraft's high speed it was thought unlikely that intercepting fighters would attack from any other angle. Two more guns were fitted to fire directly forward. Initially ordered as an attack aircraft (XA-42) in the summer of 1943, this variant would have been armed with 16 machine guns or a 75 mm (2.95 in) cannon and two machine guns. Operational history View of the contraprop and cruciform tail. Rear view of the XB-42A in May 1947 XB-42A with podded 19XB-2 jets.Francillon 1979, p. 376. XB-42A The first XB-42 was delivered to the USAAF and flew at Palm Springs, California on 6 May 1944. Performance was excellent, being basically as described in the original proposal: as fast or faster than the de Havilland Mosquito but with defensive armament and twice the bombload. The twin bubble canopies proved a bad idea as communications were adversely affected and a single bubble canopy was substituted after the first flight.Winchester 2005, p. 26. Testing revealed that the XB-42 suffered from some instability as excessive yaw was encountered, as well as vibration and poor engine cooling - all problems that could probably have been dealt with. Due to the ventral vertical stabilizer and rudder surface set's tip being located underneath the fuselage, careful handling during taxiing, takeoff, and landing was required because of limited ground clearance. The end of World War II allowed the Air Force to consider possibilities with a little more leisure and it was decided to wait for the development of better jet bombers rather than continue with the B-42 program. In December 1945, Captain Glen Edwards and Lt. Col. Henry E. Warden set a new transcontinental speed record when they flew the XB-42 from Long Beach, California to Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C. (c. 2,300 miles). In just 5 hours, 17 minutes, the XB-42 set a speed record of 433.6 mph (697.8 km/h).O'Leary 1994, p. 10. The record-breaking XB-42 prototype had been destroyed in a crash at Bolling Field. The second of two prototypes of the Douglas XB-42, 43-50225, on a routine flight out of Bolling Field, Washington, D.C., suffered in short order, a landing gear extension problem, failure of the left engine, and as coolant temperatures rose, failure of the right engine. Maj. Hayduck bailed out at 1,200 feet, Lt. Col. Haney at 800 feet, and pilot Lt. Col. (later Major General) Fred J. Ascani, after crawling aft to jettison the pusher propellers, at 400 feet ‚Äì all three survived. The aircraft crashed at Oxon Hill, Maryland. Classified jettisonable propeller technology caused a problem for authorities in explaining what witnesses on the ground thought was the aircraft exploding. Possible fuel management problems were speculated, but this hypothesis was never proven by subsequent investigation. The remaining prototype was used in flight test programs, including fulfilling a December 1943 proposal by Douglas to fit uprated engines and underwing Westinghouse 19XB-2A axial-flow turbojets of 1,600 lbf (7.1 kN) thrust each, making it the XB-42A.Francillon 1979, pp. 376‚Äì377. In this configuration, it first flew at Muroc (now Edwards Air Force Base) on 27 May 1947. In testing, it reached 488 mph (785 km/h). After 22 flights, the lower vertical stabilizer and rudder were damaged in a hard landing in 1947. The XB-42A was repaired but never flew again, and was taken off the USAF inventory on 30 June 1949.

The prototype was removed from the USAF inventory in 1949 and given to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C., in whose care it remains although it has never been placed on display. The wings were removed for transport but have since been lost. In late 2010, the fuselage was transferred, along with the Douglas XB-43 Jetmaster, to the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio where they are awaiting restoration in the Restoration Hangars.

Known as \\"la Superba\\" (\\"the Superb one\\"), \\"la Dominante\\" (\\"The Dominant one\\"), \\"la Dominante dei mari\\" (\\"the Dominant of the Seas\\"), and \\"la Repubblica dei magnifici\\" (\\"the Republic of the Magnificents\\"). From the 11th century to 1528 it was officially known as the \\"Compagna Communis Ianuensis\\" and from 1580 as the \\"Serenissima (\\"Most Serene\\") Republic of Genoa\\". During the late Middle Ages, the Republic of Genoa was a major commercial power in the Mediterranean and Black Sea, while between the 16th and 17th centuries it was one of the major financial centers in Europe. It was a celebrated maritime republic and today its coat of arms is depicted in the flag of the Italian Navy. In 1284, Genoa fought victoriously against the Republic of Pisa in the battle of Meloria for the dominance over the Tyrrhenian Sea, and it was an eternal rival of Venice for dominance in the Mediterranean Sea. From 1339 until the state's extinction in 1797 the ruler of the republic was the Doge, originally elected for life, after 1528 was elected for terms of two years. However, in actuality, the Republic was in fact an oligarchy ruled by a small group of merchant families, from whom the doges were selected. The republic began when Genoa became a self-governing commune in the 11th century and ended when it was conquered by the French First Republic under Napoleon and replaced with the Ligurian Republic. The Ligurian Republic was annexed by the First French Empire in 1805; its restoration was briefly proclaimed in 1814 following the defeat of Napoleon, but it was ultimately annexed by the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1815.  Name  A view of Genoa and its fleet by Christoforo de Grassi (1597 copy, after a drawing of 1481); Galata Museo del Mare, Genoa.It was officially known as Repubblica di Genova (Latin: Res Publica Ianuensis, Ligurian: Rep√∫brica de Z√™na) and was nicknamed by Petrarch as La Superba, in reference to its glory and impressive landmarks. For over eight centuries the republic was also known as la Dominante (English: The Dominant one), la Dominante dei mari (English: the Dominant of the Seas), and la Repubblica dei magnifici (English: the Republic of the Magnificents). History  Background  After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the city of Genoa was invaded by Germanic tribes, in about 643 Genoa and other Ligurian cities were captured by the Lombard Kingdom, under the King Rothari. In 773 the Kingdom was annexed by the Frankish Empire; the first Carolingian count of Genoa was Ademarus, who was given the title praefectus civitatis Genuensis. During this time and in the following century Genoa was little more than a small centre, slowly building its merchant fleet, which was to become the leading commercial carrier of the Western Mediterranean. In 934‚Äì35 the town was thoroughly sacked and burned by a Fatimid fleet under Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Tamimi. Which has led to some discussion about whether early tenth-century Genoa was \\"hardly more than a fishing village\\" or a vibrant trading town worth attacking. In the year 958, a diploma granted by Berengar II of Italy gave full legal freedom to the city of Genoa, guaranteeing the possession of its lands in the form of landed lordships. With this provision the process that will lead, at the end of the 11th century, to the constitution of the free municipality was started. A meeting of all the city's trade associations (compagnie), also comprising the noble lords of the surrounding valleys and coasts, finally signaled the birth of Genoese government. The then-born city-state was known as Compagna Communis. The local organization maintained a political and social significance for centuries, so much so that even in 1382 the members of the Grand Council were classified according to the companion they belonged to as well as according to the political faction divided between \\"noble\\" and \\"popular\\".  Rise  The Siege of Antioch, 1098. Before 1100, Genoa emerged as an independent city-state, one of a number of Italian city-states during this period, nominally, the Holy Roman Emperor was overlord and the Bishop of Genoa was president of the city; however, actual power was wielded by a number of \\"consuls\\" annually elected by popular assembly. At that time Muslim raiders were attacking coastal cities on the Tyrrhenian Sea. The Muslims raided Pisa in 1004 and in 1015 they escalated their attacks, raiding Luni, with Mujahid al-Siqlabi, Emir of the Taifa of Denia attacking Sardinia with a fleet of 125 ships. In 1016 the allied troops of Genoa and Pisa defended Sardinia. In 1066 war erupted between Genoa and Pisa ‚Äì possibly over the control of Sardinia. The republic was one of the so-called \\"Maritime Republics\\" (Repubbliche Marinare), along with Venice, Pisa, Amalfi, Gaeta, Ancona and Ragusa.G. Benvenuti - Le Repubbliche Marinare. Amalfi, Pisa, Genova, Venezia - Newton & Compton editori, Roma 1989; Armando Lodolini, Le repubbliche del mare, Biblioteca di storia patria, 1967, Roma. In 1087, Genoese and Pisan fleets led by Hugh of Pisa and accompanied by troops from Pantaleone of Amalfi, Salerno and Gaeta, attacked the North African city of Mahdia, the capital of the Fatimid Caliphate. The attack, supported by Pope Victor III, became known as the Mahdia campaign. The attackers captured the city, but couldn't hold it against Arab forces. After the burning of the Arab fleet in the city's harbor, the Genoese and Pisan troops retreated. The destruction of the Arab fleet gave control of the Western Mediterranean to Genoa, Venice, and Pisa. This enabled Western Europe to supply the troops of the First Crusade of 1096‚Äì1099 by sea. In 1092, Genoa and Pisa, in collaboration with Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile attacked the Muslim Taifa of Valencia. They also unsuccessfully besieged Tortosa with support from troops of Sancho Ram√≠rez, King of Aragon. In its early centuries Genoa was an important trading city and its power began to increase. Genoa started expanding during the First Crusade. In 1097 Hugh of Ch√¢teauneuf, Bishop of Grenoble and William, Bishop of Orange, went to Genoa and preached in the church of San Siro in order to gather troops for the First Crusade. At the time the city had a population of about 10,000. Twelve galleys, one ship and 1,200 soldiers from Genoa joined the crusade. The Genoese troops, led by noblemen de Insula and Avvocato, set sail in July 1097. The Genoese fleet transported and provided naval support to the crusaders, mainly during the siege of Antioch in 1098, when the Genoese fleet blockaded the city while the troops provided support during the siege. In the siege of Jerusalem in 1099 Genoese crossbowmen led by Guglielmo Embriaco acted as support units against the defenders of the city. After the capture of Antioch on May 3, 1098, Genoa forged an alliance with Bohemond of Taranto, who became the ruler of the Principality of Antioch. As a result, he granted them a headquarters, the church of San Giovanni, and 30 houses in Antioch. On May 6, 1098 a part of the Genoese army returned to Genoa with the relics of Saint John the Baptist, granted to the Republic of Genoa as part of their reward for providing military support to the First Crusade. Many settlements in the Middle East were given to Genoa as well as favorable commercial treaties. Genoa later forged an alliance with King Baldwin I of Jerusalem (reigned 1100‚Äì1118). In order to secure the alliance Baldwin gave Genoa one-third of the Lordship of Arsuf, one-third of Caesarea, and one-third of Acre and its port's income. Additionally the Republic of Genoa would receive 300 bezants every year, and one-third of Baldwin's conquest every time 50 or more Genoese soldiers joined his troops. The Republic's role as a maritime power in the region secured many favorable commercial treaties for Genoese merchants. They came to control a large portion of the trade of the Byzantine Empire, Tripoli (Libya), the Principality of Antioch, Cilician Armenia, and Egypt. Although Genoa maintained free-trading rights in Egypt and Syria, it lost some of its territorial possessions after Saladin's campaigns in those areas in the late 12th century. In 1147, Genoa took part in the Siege of Almer√≠a, helping Alfonso VII of Le√≥n and Castile reconquer that city from the Muslims. After the conquest the republic leased out its third of the city to one of its own citizens, Otto de Bonvillano, who swore fealty to the republic and promised to guard the city with three hundred men at all times.John Bryan Williams, \\"The Making of a Crusade: The Genoese Anti-Muslim Attacks in Spain, 1146‚Äì1148\\" Journal of Medieval History 23 1 (1997): 29‚Äì53. This demonstrates how Genoa's early efforts at expanding her influence involved enfeoffing private citizens to the commune and controlling overseas territories indirectly, rather than through the republican administration. In 1148, it joined the Siege of Tortosa and helped Count Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona take that city, for which it also received a third. Over the course of the 11th and particularly the 12th centuries, Genoa became the dominant naval force in the Western Mediterranean, as its erstwhile rivals Pisa and Amalfi declined in importance. Genoa (along with Venice) succeeded in gaining a central position in the Mediterranean slave trade at this time. This left the Republic with only one major rival in the Mediterranean: Venice. Genoese Crusaders brought home a green glass goblet from the Levant, which Genoese long regarded as the Holy Grail. Not all of Genoa's merchandise was so innocuous, however, as medieval Genoa became a major player in the slave trade.Steven A. Epstein, Speaking of Slavery: Color, Ethnicity, and Human Bondage in Italy (Conjunctions of Religion and Power in the Medieval Past. Thirteenth and fourteenth century Galata Tower (1348) in Galata, Istanbul. The commercial and cultural rivalry of Genoa and Venice was played out through the thirteenth century. The Republic of Venice played a significant role in the Fourth Crusade, diverting \\"Latin\\" energies to the ruin of its former patron and present trading rival, Constantinople. As a result, Venetian support of the newly established Latin Empire meant that Venetian trading rights were enforced, and Venice gained control of large portion of the commerce of the eastern Mediterranean. In order to regain control of the commerce, the Republic of Genoa allied with Michael VIII Palaiologos Emperor of Nicaea, who wanted to restore the Byzantine Empire by recapturing Constantinople. In March 1261 the treaty of the alliance was signed in Nymphaeum. On July 25, 1261, Nicaean troops under Alexios Strategopoulos recaptured Constantinople. As a result, the balance of favour tipped toward Genoa, which was granted free trade rights in the Nicene Empire. Besides the control of commerce in the hands of Genoese merchants, Genoa received ports and way stations in many islands and settlements in the Aegean Sea. The islands of Chios and Lesbos became commercial stations of Genoa as well as the city of Smyrna (Izmir). Territories of the Republic of Genoa (economic influence areas shown in pink) around the mediterranean & Black Sea coasts, 1400, since the Codex Latinus Parisinus (1395). Genoa and Pisa became the only states with trading rights in the Black Sea. In the same century the Republic conquered many settlements in Crimea, where the Genoese colony of Caffa was established. The alliance with the restored Byzantine Empire increased the wealth and power of Genoa, and simultaneously decreased Venetian and Pisan commerce. The Byzantine Empire had granted the majority of free trading rights to Genoa. In 1282 Pisa tried to gain control of the commerce and administration of Corsica, after being called for support by the judge Sinucello who revolted against Genoa. In August 1282, part of the Genoese fleet blockaded Pisan commerce near the river Arno. During 1283 both Genoa and Pisa made war preparations. Genoa built 120 galleys, 60 of which belonged to the Republic, while the other 60 galleys were rented to individuals. More than 15,000 mercenaries were hired as rowmen and soldiers. The Pisan fleet avoided combat, and tried to wear out the Genoese fleet during 1283. On August 5, 1284, in the naval Battle of Meloria the Genoese fleet, consisting of 93 ships led by Oberto Doria and Benedetto I Zaccaria, defeated the Pisan fleet, which consisted of 72 ships and was led by Alberto Morosini and Ugolino della Gherardesca. Genoa captured 30 Pisan ships, and sank seven. About 8,000 Pisans were killed during the battle, more than half of the Pisan troops, which were about 14,000. The defeat of Pisa, which never fully recovered as a maritime competitor, resulted in gain of control of the commerce of Corsica by Genoa. The Sardinian town of Sassari, which was under Pisan control, became a commune or self-styled \\"free municipality\\" which was controlled by Genoa. Control of Sardinia, however, did not pass permanently to Genoa: the Aragonese kings of Naples disputed control and did not secure it until the fifteenth century. The Genoese fortress in Sudak, Crimea. Genoese merchants pressed south, to the island of Sicily, and into Muslim North Africas, where Genoese established trading posts, pursuing the gold that traveled up through the Sahara and establishing Atlantic depots as far afield as Sal√© and Safi.H. Hearder and D.P. Waley, eds, A Short History of Italy (Cambridge University Press)1963:68. In 1283 the population of the Kingdom of Sicily revolted against the Angevin rule. The revolt became known as the Sicilian Vespers. As a result, the Aragonese rule was established on the Kingdom. Genoa, which had supported the Aragonese, was granted free trading and export rights in the Kingdom of Sicily. Genoese bankers also profited from loans to the new nobility of Sicily. Corsica was formally annexed in 1347.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1910, Volume 7, page 201. Genoa was far more than a depot of drugs and spices from the East: an essential engine of its economy was the weaving of silk textiles, from imported thread, following the symmetrical styles of Byzantine and Sassanian silks. As a result of the economic retrenchment in Europe in the late fourteenth century, as well as its long war with Venice, which culminated in its defeat at Chioggia (1380), Genoa went into decline. This pivotal war with Venice has come to be called the War of Chioggia because of this decisive battle which resulted in the defeat of Genoa at the hands of Venice.John Julius Norwich, History of Venice (Alfred A. Knopf Co.: New York, 1982) p. 256. Prior to the War of Chioggia, which lasted from 1379 until 1381, the Genoese had enjoyed a naval ascendency that was the source of their power and position within northern Italy. The Genoan defeat deprived Genoa of this naval supremacy, pushed it out of eastern Mediterranean markets and began the decline of the city-state. Rising Ottoman power also cut into the Genoese emporia in the Aegean, and the Black Sea trade was reduced. In 1396, in order to protect the republic from internal unrest and the provocations of the Duke of Orl√©ans and the former Duke of Milan, the Doge of Genoa Antoniotto Adorno made Charles VI of France the difensor del comune (\\"defender of the municipality\\") of Genoa. Though the republic had previously been under partial foreign control, this marked the first time Genoa was dominated by a foreign power. Golden age of Genovese bankers Map showing the political divisions of Italy in 1494 Though not well-studied, Genoa in the 15th century seems to have been tumultuous. The city had a strong tradition of trading goods from the Levant and its financial expertise was recognised all over Europe. After a brief period of French domination from 1394 to 1409, Genoa came under the rule of the Visconti of Milan. Genoa lost Sardinia to Aragon, Corsica to internal revolt, and its Middle Eastern, Eastern European, and Asia Minor colonies to the Ottoman Empire. In the 15th century two of the earliest banks in the world were founded in Genoa: the Bank of Saint George, founded in 1407, which was the oldest state deposit bank in the world at its closure in 1805 and the Banca Carige, founded in 1483 as a mount of piety, which still exists. Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa 1451, and donated one-tenth of his income from the discovery of the Americas for Spain to the Bank of Saint George in Genoa for the relief of taxation on foods. Threatened by Alfonso V of Aragon, the Doge of Genoa in 1458 handed the Republic over to the French, making it the Duchy of Genoa under the control of John of Anjou, a French royal governor. However, with support from Milan, Genoa revolted and the Republic was restored in 1461. The Milanese then changed sides, conquering Genoa in 1464 and holding it as a fief of the French crown.Vincent Ilardi, The Italian League and Francesco Sforza ‚Äì A Study in Diplomacy, 1450‚Äì1466 (Doctoral dissertation ‚Äì unpublished: Harvard University, 1957) pp. 151‚Äì3, 161‚Äì2, 495‚Äì8, 500‚Äì5, 510‚Äì12.Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini (Pope Pius II), The Commentaries of Pius II, eds.

Kendall, eds., Dispatches of Milanese Ambassadors, 1450‚Äì1483(3 vols; Ohio University Press: Athens, Ohio, 1970, 1971, 1981) vol. III, p. xxxvii. Between 1463‚Äì1478 and 1488‚Äì1499, Genoa was held by the Milanese House of Sforza. From 1499 to 1528, the Republic reached its nadir, being under nearly continual French occupation. The Spanish, with their intramural allies, the \\"old nobility\\" entrenched in the mountain fastnesses behind Genoa, captured the city on May 30, 1522, and subjected the city to a merciless pillage. When the great admiral Andrea Doria of the powerful Doria family allied with the Emperor Charles V to oust the French and restore Genoa's independence, a renewed prospect opened: 1528 marks the first loan from Genovese banks to Charles. Under the ensuing economic recovery, many aristocratic Genoese families, such as the Balbi, Doria, Grimaldi, Pallavicini, and Serra, amassed tremendous fortunes. According to Felipe Fernandez-Armesto and others, the practices Genoa developed in the Mediterranean (such as chattel slavery) were crucial in the exploration and exploitation of the New World.Before Columbus: Exploration and Colonization from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, 1229-1492. At the time of Genoa's peak in the 16th century, the city attracted many artists, including Rubens, Caravaggio and Van Dyck. The architect Galeazzo Alessi (1512‚Äì1572) designed many of the city's splendid palazzi, as did in the decades that followed by fifty years Bartolomeo Bianco (1590‚Äì1657), designer of centrepieces of University of Genoa. A number of Genoese Baroque and Rococo artists settled elsewhere and a number of local artists became prominent. Thereafter, Genoa underwent something of a revival as a junior associate of the Spanish Empire, with Genovese bankers, in particular, financing many of the Spanish crown's foreign endeavors from their counting houses in Seville. Fernand Braudel has even called the period 1557 to 1627 the \\"age of the Genovese\\", \\"of a rule that was so discreet and sophisticated that historians for a long time failed to notice it\\" (Braudel 1984 p. 157), although the modern visitor passing brilliant Mannerist and Baroque palazzo facades along Genoa's Strada Nova (now Via Garibaldi) or via Balbi cannot fail to notice that there was conspicuous wealth, which in fact was not Genovese but concentrated in the hands of a tightly knit circle of banker-financiers, true \\"venture capitalists\\". Genoa's trade, however, remained closely dependent on control of Mediterranean sealanes, and the loss of Chios to the Ottoman Empire (1566), struck a severe blow.Philip P. Argenti, Chius Vincta or the Occupation of Chios by the Turks (1566) and Their Administration of the Island (1566‚Äì1912), Described in Contemporary Diplomatic Reports and Official Dispatches (Cambridge, 1941), Part I. The opening for the Genovese banking consortium was the state bankruptcy of Philip II in 1557, which threw the German banking houses into chaos and ended the reign of the Fuggers as Spanish financiers. The Genovese bankers provided the unwieldy Habsburg system with fluid credit and a dependably regular income. In return the less dependable shipments of American silver were rapidly transferred from Seville to Genoa, to provide capital for further ventures. From about 1520 the Genoese controlled the port of Panama, the first port on the Pacific founded by the conquest of the Americas; the Genoese obtained a concession to exploit the port mainly for the slave trade of the new world on the Pacific, until the destruction of the primeval city in 1671. The Genovese banker Ambrogio Spinola, marqu√©s de los Balbases, for instance, himself raised and led an army that fought in the Eighty Years' War in the Netherlands in the early 17th century. The decline of Spain in the 17th century brought also the renewed decline of Genoa, and the Spanish crown's frequent bankruptcies, in particular, ruined many of Genoa's merchant houses. In 1684 the city was heavily bombarded by a French fleet as punishment for its alliance with Spain. Decline In May 1625 a French-Savoian army briefly laid siege to Genoa. Though it was eventually lifted with the aid of the Spanish, the French would later bombard the city in May 1684 for its support of Spain during the War of the Reunions.Genoa 1684, World History at KMLA. In- between, a plague killed as many as half of the inhabitants of Genoa in 1656‚Äì57.Early modern Italy (16th to 18th centuries) ¬ª The 17th-century crisis Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Genoa continued its slow decline well into the 18th century, losing its last Mediterranean colony, the island fortress of Tabarka, to the Bey of Tunis in 1742.Alberti Russell, Janice. The Italian community in Tunisia, 1861‚Äì1961: a viable minority. pag. 142. Genoese soldiers during the War of the Austrian Succession The Convention of Turin of 1742, in which Austria allied with the Kingdom of Sardinia, caused some consternation in the Republic. However, when this provisional relationship was given a more durable and reliable character in the signing of the Treaty of Worms, in 1743, the fear of diplomatic isolation had caused the Genoese Republic to abandon its neutrality and to ally with the House of Bourbon in the War of the Austrian Succession. Consequently, the Republic of Genoa signed a secret treaty with the Bourbon allies of Kingdom of France, Spanish Empire and Kingdom of Naples. On 26 June 1745, the Republic of Genoa declared war on the Kingdom of Sardinia. This decision would prove disastrous for Genoa, which later surrendered to the Austrians in September 1746 and was briefly occupied before a revolt liberated the city two months later. The Austrians returned in 1747 and, along with a contingent of Sardinian forces, laid siege to Genoa before being driven off by the approach of a Franco-Spanish army. Though Genoa retained its lands in the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, it was unable to keep its hold on Corsica in its weakened state. After driving out the Genoese, the Corsican Republic was declared in 1755. Eventually relying on French intervention to quash the rebellion, Genoa was forced to cede Corsica to the French in the 1768 Treaty of Versailles.  The end of the Republic and its brief revival of 1814  Already in 1794 and 1795 the revolutionary echoes from France reached Genoa, thanks to Genoese propagandists and refugees sheltered in the nearby state of the Alps, and in 1794 a conspiracy against the aristocratic and oligarchic ruling class that, in fact, was already waiting for it in the Genoese palaces of power. However, it was in May 1797 that the intent of the Genoese jacobins and French citizens to overthrow the government of the Doge Giacomo Maria Brignole took shape, giving rise to a fratricidal war in the streets between opponents and popular supporters of the current customs system. The direct intervention of Napoleon (during the Campaigns of 1796) and his representatives in Genoa was the final act that led to the fall of the Republic in early June, who overthrew the old elites which had ruled the state for all of its history, giving birth to the Ligurian Republic on June 14, 1797, under the watchful care of Napoleonic France. After Bonaparte's seizure of power in France, a more conservative constitution was enacted, but the Ligurian Republic's life was short‚Äîin 1805 it was annexed by France, becoming the d√©partements of Apennins, G√™nes, and Montenotte. With the fall of Napoleon, and the subsequent Congress of Vienna, Genoa regained an ephemeral independence, with the name of the Repubblica genovese, which lasted less than a year. However, the congress established the annexation of the territories, and therefore of the whole of Liguria with the Oltregiogo area and the island of Capraia to the Kingdom of Sardinia, governed by the House of Savoy, contravening the principle of restoring the legitimate governments and monarchies of the old Republic.  Government  The Palace of the Doges view from Piazza Matteotti. The history of Genoa, of the Genoese and of the republic that held its fate for a long time, but also of the governments that gradually took turns leading the city, to reach the time of the Doges, is traceable through the work of historians who have continued the storytelling work begun at the end of the 11th century by Caffaro Di Caschifellone (historian and himself municipal consul) with the \\"Annales ianuenses\\". The Republic of Genoa's governance history is divided into five stages: * Consul: 11th century‚Äì1191 * Podest√†: 1191‚Äì1256 * Capitano del popolo: 1257‚Äì1339 * Doge (elected for life): 1339‚Äì1528 * Doge (elected for terms of two years): 1528‚Äì1797 The republic was substantially democratic in shape, while those of the Podest√†s and the Captains of the people strongly restored the often conflicting relationship between the authority and the freedom. The perpetual doges, on the other hand, proclaimed themselves popular, even though sometimes crossing the oligarchy; finally the fifth republic was institutionally aristocratic. By custom, prelates in Genoa were unable to take on public office.  Aristocratic families  Coat of arms of the Adorno family, one of the most influential dynasties in the history of the republic. In the first two centuries from the institution of the Dogate for life in Genoa, it was above all the Adorno (seven doges elected) and Fregoso (ten doges elected) families who fought the position. After the reform of 1528, among the seventy- nine \\"biennial Doges\\" who came to power, many were elected from a small number of noble houses in the city organized into 28 \\"Alberghi\\", in particular: * Grimaldi: eleven doges. * Spinola: eleven doges. * Durazzo: eight doges. * De Franchi, Giustiniani and Lomellini families: seven doges each. * Centurione: six doges. * Doria: six doges. * Cattaneo and Gentile families: five doges each. * Brignole: four doges. * Imperiali: four doges. * De Mari, Invrea and Negrone families: four doges each. * Pallavicini: three doges. * Sauli: three doges. * Balbi, Cambiaso, Chiavari, Lercari, Pinelli, Promontorio, Veneroso, Viale and Zoagli families: two doges each. * Della Torre: two doges. * Assereto, Ayroli, Canevaro, Chiavica Cibo, Clavarezza, Da Passano, De Ferrari, De Fornari, De Marini, Di Negro, Ferreti, Franzoni, Frugoni, Garbarino, Giudice Calvi, Odone, Saluzzo, Senarega, Vacca and Vivaldi: one doge each * Della Rovere: one doge. Other influential families of the Republic of Genoa were: * Fieschi: counts of Lavagna, and produced two Popes: Pope Innocent IV and Pope Adrian V * Gattilusi: lords of numerous lands in the Aegean Sea, such as Lemnos, Lesbos, Enez and Samothrace. * Embriaco: Lords of Gibelet for almost 200 years, and important players in the history of the Crusader states.  Territories during the Middle Ages  At the time of its founding in the early 11th century the Republic of Genoa consisted of the city of Genoa and the surrounding areas. As the commerce of the city increased, so did the territory of the Republic. By 1015 all of Liguria fell under the Republic of Genoa. After the First Crusade in 1098 Genoa gained settlements in Syria. (It lost the majority of them during the campaigns of Saladin in the 12th century.) In 1261 the city of Smyrna in Asia Minor became Genoese territory. In 1255 Genoa established the colony of Caffa in Crimea. In the following years the Genoese established further colonies in Crimea: Soldaia, Cherco and Cembalo. In 1275 the Byzantine Empire granted the islands of Chios and Samos to Genoa. Between 1316 and 1332 Genoa established the Black Sea colonies of La Tana (present-day Azov) and Samsun in Anatolia. In 1355 the Byzantine Emperor John V Palaiologos granted Lesbos to a Genoese lord. At the end of the 14th century the colony of Samastri was established in the Black Sea and Cyprus was granted to the Republic. At that period the Republic of Genoa also controlled one quarter of Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire, and Trebizond, capital of the Empire of Trebizond. The Ottoman Empire conquered most of the Genoese overseas territories during the 15th century.

Here, the entrance has been fixed by jetty construction. Carlsbad, California, April 1998. Aerial view of a jetty at Swakopmund, Namibia (2017) A jetty is a structure that projects from land out into water. It may also refer more specifically to a walkway accessing the centre of an enclosed waterbody. The term derives from the French word ', \\"thrown\\", signifying something thrown out. For regulating rivers Another form of jetties, wing dams are extended out, opposite one another, from each bank of a river, at intervals, to contract a wide channel, and by concentration of the current to produce a deepening. For berthing at docks Where docks are given sloping sides, openwork timber jetties are generally carried across the slope, at the ends of which vessels can lie in deep water or more solid structures are erected over the slope for supporting coal-tips. Pilework jetties are also constructed in the water outside the entrances to docks on each side, so as to form an enlarging trumpet-shaped channel between the entrance, lock or tidal basin and the approach channel, in order to guide vessels in entering or leaving the docks. Solid jetties, moreover, lined with quay walls, are sometimes carried out into a wide dock, at right angles to the line of quays at the side, to enlarge the accommodation; and they also serve, when extended on a large scale from the coast of a tideless sea under shelter of an outlying breakwater, to form the basins in which vessels lie when discharging and taking in cargoes in such a port as Marseille. At entrances to jetty harbors dolosse, at Humboldt Bay harbor entrance. These jetties mitigate unpredictable shifting sands. The approach channel to some ports situated on sandy coasts is guided and protected across the beach by parallel jetties. In some cases, these are made solid up to a little above low water of neap tides, on which open timber-work is erected, provided with a planked platform at the top raised above the highest tides. In other cases, they consist entirely of solid material without timber-work. The channel between the jetties was originally maintained by tidal scour from low-lying areas close to the coast, and subsequently by the current from sluicing basins; but it is now often considerably deepened by sand-pump dredging. It is protected to some extent by the solid portion of the jetties from the inroad of sand from the adjacent beach, and from the levelling action of the waves; while the upper open portion serves to indicate the channel and to guide the vessels, if necessary (see harbor). The bottom part of the older jetties, in such long-established jetty ports as Calais, Dunkirk and Ostend, was composed of clay or rubble stone, covered on the top by fascine-work or pitching, but the deepening of the jetty channel by dredging and the need that arose for its enlargement led to the reconstruction of the jetties at these ports. The nes jetties at Dunkirk were founded in the sandy beach, by the aid of compressed air, at a depth of . below low water of spring tides; and their solid masonry portion, on a concrete foundation was raised . above low water of neap tides. At lagoon outlets Private jetties near the mouth of the alt= A small tidal rise spreading tidal water over a large expanse of lagoon or inland backwater causes the influx and efflux of the tide to maintain a deep channel through a narrows no longer confined by a bank on each side, becomes dispersed, and owing to the reduction of its scouring force, is no longer able at a moderate distance from the shore effectually to resist the action of tending to form a continuous beach in front of the outlet. Hence a bar is produced that diminishes the available depth in the approach channel. By carrying out a solid jetty over the bar, however on each side of the outlet, the tidal currents are concentrated in the channel across the bar, and lower it by scour. Thus the available depth of the approach channels to Venice through the Malamocco and Lido outlets from the Venetian Lagoon have been deepened several feet (metres) over their bars by jetties of rubble, carried out across the foreshore into deep water on both sides of the channel. Other examples are provided by the long jetties extended into the sea in front of the entrance to Charleston harbour, formerly constructed of fascines weighed down with stone and logs, but subsequently of rubble stone, and by the two converging rubble jetties carried out from each shore of Dublin Bay for deepening the approach to Dublin harbour. Jetties have the adverse effect of endangering Surf Culture as a whole with their ability to destroy surf breaks.

Jetties have been constructed on each side of the outlet river of some of the rivers flowing into the Baltic, with the objective of prolonging the scour of the river and protecting the channel from being shoaled by the littoral drift along the shore. The most interesting application of parallel jetties is in lowering the bar in front of one of the mouths of a deltaic river flowing into a tide ‚Äî a virtual prolongation of its less sea, by extending the scour of the river out to the bar by banks. Jetties prolonging the Sulina branch of the Danube into the Black Sea, and the south pass of the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico, formed of rubble stone and concrete blocks, and respectively, have enabled the discharge of these rivers to scour away the bars obstructing the access to them; and they have also carried the sediment-bearing waters sufficiently far out to come under the influence of littoral currents, which, by conveying away some of the sediment, postpone the eventual formation of a fresh bar farther out (see river engineering). At the mouth of tidal rivers Where a river is narrow near its mouth, has a generally feeble discharge and a small tidal range, the sea is liable on an exposed coast to block up its outlet during severe storms. The river is thus forced to seek another exit at a weak spot of the beach, which along a low coast may be at some distance off; and this new outlet in its turn may be blocked up, so that the river from time to time shifts the position of its mouth. This inconvenient cycle of changes may be stopped by fixing the outlet of the river at a suitable site, by carrying a jetty on each side of this outlet across the beach, thereby concentrating its discharge in a definite channel and protecting the mouth from being blocked up by littoral drift. This system was long ago applied to the shifting outlet of the river Yare to the south of Yarmouth, and has also been successfully employed for fixing the wandering mouth of the Adur near Shoreham, and of the Adour flowing into the Bay of Biscay below Bayonne. When a new channel was cut across the Hoek van Holland to provide a straighter and deeper outlet channel for the river Maas, forming the approach channel to Rotterdam, low, broad, parallel jetties, composed of fascine mattresses weighted with stone, were carried across the foreshore into the sea on either side of the new mouth of the river, to protect the jetty channel from littoral drift, and cause the discharge of the river to maintain it out to deep water. The channel, also, beyond the outlet of the river Nervion into the Bay of Biscay has been regulated by jetties; and by extending the south-west jetty out for nearly with a curve concave towards the channel the outlet has not only been protected to some extent from the easterly drift, but the bar in front has been lowered by the scour produced by the discharge of the river following the concave bend of the southwest jetty. As the outer portion of this jetty was exposed to westerly storms from the Bay of Biscay before the outer harbour was constructed, it has been given the form and strength of a breakwater situated in shallow water.

From 1910 to 1914 Cabannes worked in the laboratory of Charles Fabry in Marseille on the topic launched by Lord Rayleigh at the end of the 19th century of how gas molecules diffused light. In 1914 he showed that pure gases could scatter light. This was published in Comptes Rendus in 1915. (Please see reference.) His career was then interrupted for five years by World War I. In 1919 Cabannes returned to Fabry's laboratory to complete his thesis, after which he moved to Montpellier, and later on to Paris. In 1925 he and Jean Dufay calculated the height of the ozone layer. J. Cabannes, P. Daure and Y. Rocard were among the scientists who, in 1928, discovered that gases diffusing monochromatic light could also change their wavelength (the Cabannes-Daure effect). This was identified independently by C. V. Raman and K. S. Krishnan in liquids, and by G. S. Landsberg and L. I. Mandelstam in crystals. Cabannes was among the candidates for the Nobel Prize in Physics of 1929 (proposed by C. Fabry), which was awarded to de Broglie. The 1930 prize went to Raman who gave the complete explanation of the effect now bearing his name, using quantum mechanics. The lunar crater Cabannes was named after him. In 1949 he was elected a member of l'Acad√©mie des Sciences. In 1924 he received the Prix F√©lix Robin and in 1951 the first ever awarded Prix des Trois Physiciens from the Fondation de France.

She was later charged with the murder of her husband and mother.Le Petit Journal, Nov. 2, 1909. http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k618795t/f5.item Early life Steinheil was born Marguerite Jeanne Japy in Beaucourt, in the Territoire de Belfort, to a rich, industrial family, the daughter of Emilie (Rau) and Eduard Japy. She married the well-known French painter Adolphe Steinheil, son of painter Louis Charles Auguste Steinheil, in July 1890. She became a prominent figure in Parisian society, and her salon was frequented by men of eminence in French political and social circles, including Charles Gounod, Ferdinand de Lesseps, Ren√© Lalique, Jules Massenet, Fran√ßois Copp√©e, √âmile Zola, and Pierre Loti. Mistress of President Felix Faure In 1897, she was introduced, at Chamonix, to President F√©lix Faure, who was giving an official contract to Adolphe Steinheil. Because of this, F√©lix Faure came often to their home on the Impasse Ronsin. Shortly afterward Marguerite became F√©lix Faure's mistress and was regularly ushered into the salon bleu in the private quarters of the presidential Palais de l'√âlys√©e. On 16 February 1899, F√©lix Faure called Marguerite by telephone, asking her to come to the palace at the end of the afternoon. Briefly after her arrival, servants were rung for and they found the president lying on the couch while Marguerite Steinheil adjusted her disordered clothing. F√©lix Faure died several hours later. Legend has it that she was performing oral sex on him when he had a fit, and died, his convulsed hands tangled in her hair. Of course nothing of this was officially announced, but rumours started spreading immediately, although for several years it was believed that his partner at the time of his death was actress C√©cile Sorel.Armand Lanoux wrote a book about her affair with Faure, Madame Steinheil ou la Connaissance du pr√©sident (1983). This title is a pun on connaissance meaning both \\"consciousness\\" and \\"acquaintance\\". The priest who came to give last rites to F√©lix Faure when he died allegedly asked a police officer whether the president still \\"had his consciousness/acquaintance\\", to which the police officer replied \\"no, she left through the back door\\". Femme du monde After the death of F√©lix Faure, Marguerite Steinheil became the mistress of many famous men. In her M√©moires, she records how she and her spouse received a mysterious German guest, who bought back from them each of the pearls of a collar given to her by Faure (le collier pr√©sidentiel, as it became known in the press) and who reclaimed a manuscript of the president's memoires which he had entrusted to Marguerite. In February 1908, she met the powerful industrialist Maurice Borderel, also from the Ardennes, and soon became his lover. L'affaire Steinheil On 31 May 1908, Marguerite's mother and husband were found dead in their residence in the Impasse Ronsin, off the Rue de Vaugirard. Both had died of suffocation by strangulation.Le Petit Parisien, Nov. 1, 1909. http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k563412m/f1.item Marguerite was found gagged and bound to a bed. She initially said that she had been tied up by four black-robed strangers, three men and a woman. Some newspapers speculated that they had come to her house in search of certain secret documents which Faure had entrusted to her keeping, possibly relating to the Dreyfus affair. The police immediately regarded her as a suspect in the killings but had no hard evidence and made a pretense of abandoning the investigation. But Steinheil herself would not let the affair rest. She made an attempt to frame her manservant, R√©my Couillard, by concealing a small pearl which she affirmed had been stolen at the time of the murder in a pocketbook belonging to Couillard; after that fabrication was discovered, she blamed Alexandre Wolff, the son of her old housekeeper, but he was able to establish an alibi. She was arrested in November 1908 and taken to St. Lazare prison. The crime created a sensation in Paris. It was revealed that she had had a great number of admirers, including even King Sisowath of Cambodia. Opponents of the government tried to make political capital of the affair, the anti-Semitic Libre Parole even charging her with having poisoned President Faure. A sensational trial finally ended in her acquittal on 14 November 1909, although the judge called her stories \\"tissues of lies\\". Later life After the trial she came to live in London, where she was known as Mme de Serignac. She wrote My Memoirs in 1912. On 26 June 1917, she married Robert Brooke Campbell Scarlett, 6th Baron Abinger, who died in 1927. She lived at 24 Adelaide Crescent in Hove from that year and died in a nursing home in the town.

Early life He was born in Stockton, California, to Roberta Pandolfini Montana and Ray Montana. Both were in show business: Roberta had been a Ziegfeld girl, and Ray performed banjo on the vaudeville circuit. As a result, Bob Montana traveled extensively as a child. He attended Haverhill High School in Haverhill, Massachusetts. and graduated from Manchester High School Central in Manchester, New Hampshire. According to Jane (Donahue) Murphy, a high school classmate of Montana's, Archie and his friends were based on people from their hometown and high school. She said Archie Andrews was based on Donahue's cousin, Richard Heffernan; Veronica Lodge on Agatha Popoff, the daughter of the local football team's doctor; Jughead Jones on a mischievous teen named \\"Skinny\\" Linnehan; while Miss Grundy may have been based on a high school typing and shorthand teacher named Lundstrom; however, Haverhill's school librarian is also believed to be the model for Grundy. Career While freelancing at True Comics and Fox Comics, Montana created an adventure strip about four teenage boys and tried to sell it without success. Archie Comics Montana started working for MLJ Comics (which would later be known as Archie Comics). He was asked to work up a high school style comic strip story, featuring Archie Andrews. The success of the Archie and friends story in MLJ Comics' Pep Comics (Dec. 1941) led MLJ to assign Montana to draw the first issue of Archie (Nov. 1942).

Oceanic climates are defined as having a monthly mean temperature below in the warmest month, and above (or in the coldest month). This climate type is often caused by the onshore flow from the cool, high latitude oceans that are found west of their location. It typically lacks a dry season, as precipitation is more evenly dispersed throughout the year. It is the predominant climate type across much of Western Europe, United Kingdom, New Zealand, the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada, far southwestern South America, a narrow zone of southeastern Australia including Tasmania, and isolated locations elsewhere. Oceanic climates are generally characterised by a narrower annual range of temperatures than in other places at a comparable latitude, and generally do not have the extremely dry summers of Mediterranean climates or the hot and wet summers of humid subtropical climates. Oceanic climates are most dominant in Europe, where they spread much farther inland than in other continents. Oceanic climates can have considerable storm activity as they are located in the belt of the stormy westerlies. Many oceanic climates have frequent cloudy or overcast conditions due to the near constant storms and lows tracking over or near them. The annual range of temperatures is smaller than typical climates at these latitudes due to the constant stable marine air masses that pass through oceanic climates, which lack both very warm and very cool fronts. Precipitation Locations with oceanic climates tend to feature cloudy conditions with precipitation, though it can experience clear, sunny days. London is an example of an oceanic climate. It experiences reliable and constant precipitation throughout the entire year. Despite this, thunderstorms are quite rare since hot and cold air masses meet infrequently in the region. In most areas with an oceanic climate, precipitation comes in the form of rain for the majority of the year. However, some areas with this climate see some snowfall annually during winter. Most oceanic climate zones, or at least a part of them, experience at least one snowfall per year. In the poleward locations of the oceanic climate zone (\\"subpolar oceanic climates\\", described in greater detail below), snowfall is more frequent and commonplace. Temperature Overall temperature characteristics of the oceanic climates feature cool temperatures and infrequent extremes of temperature. In the K√∂ppen climate classification, Oceanic climates have a mean temperature of or higher (or or higher in the coldest month), compared to continental climates where the coldest month has a mean temperature of below (or in the coldest month). Summers are cool, with the warmest month having a mean temperature below . Poleward of the latter is a zone of the aforementioned subpolar oceanic climate (K√∂ppen Cfc), with long but relatively mild (for their latitude) winters and cool and short summers (average temperatures of at least for one to three months). Examples of this climate include parts of coastal Iceland, and Norway, the Scottish Highlands, the mountains of Vancouver Island, and Haida Gwaii in Canada, in the Northern Hemisphere and extreme southern Chile and Argentina in the Southern Hemisphere (examples include Ushuaia and Punta Arenas), the Tasmanian Central Highlands, and parts of New Zealand. The cause  Oceanic climates are not necessarily always found in coastal locations on the aforementioned parallels; however, in most cases oceanic climates parallel higher middle latitude oceans. The polar jet stream, which moves in a west to east direction across the middle latitudes, advances low pressure systems, storms, and fronts. In coastal areas of the higher middle latitudes (45‚Äì60¬∞ latitude), the prevailing onshore flow creates the basic structure of most oceanic climates. Oceanic climates are a product and reflection of the ocean adjacent to them. In the autumn, winter, and early spring, when the polar jet stream is most active, the frequent passing of marine weather systems creates the frequent fog, cloudy skies, and light drizzle often associated with oceanic climates. In summer, high pressure often pushes the prevailing westerlies north of many oceanic climates, often creating a drier summer climate (for example in the Northwest coast of North America, bathed by the Pacific Ocean). The North Atlantic Gulf Stream, a tropical oceanic current that passes north of the Caribbean and up the East Coast of the United States to North Carolina, then heads east-northeast to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, is thought to greatly modify the climate of Northwest Europe. As a result of the North Atlantic Current, west-coast areas located in high latitudes like Ireland, the UK, and Norway have much milder winters (for their latitude) than would otherwise be the case. The lowland attributes of western Europe also help drive marine air masses into continental areas, enabling cities such as Dresden, Prague, and Vienna to have maritime climates in spite of being located well inland from the ocean. Locations Europe Oceanic climates in Europe occur mostly in Northwest Europe, from Ireland and Great Britain eastward to central Europe. Most of France (away from the Mediterranean), Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Western Germany, Southern Norway, the north coast of Spain (Asturias, Basque Country, Cantabria, Galicia and north of Navarre, Aragon and Catalonia,), the western Azores off the coast of Portugal, the south of Kosovo and southern portions of Sweden, also have oceanic climates. Examples of oceanic climates are found in Glasgow, London, Bergen, Amsterdam, Dublin, Berlin, Hamburg, Bilbao, Oviedo, Biarritz, Bayonne, Z√ºrich, Copenhagen, Skagen and Paris. With decreasing distance to the Mediterranean Sea, the oceanic climate of Northwest Europe gradually changes to the subtropical dry-summer or Mediterranean climate of southern Europe. The line between Oceanic and Continental climate in Europe runs in a generally north to south direction. For example, western Germany is more impacted by milder Atlantic air masses than is eastern Germany. Thus, winters across Europe become colder to the east, and (in some locations) summers become hotter. The line between oceanic Europe and Mediterranean Europe normally runs west to east and is related to changes in precipitation patterns and differences to seasonal temperatures. The Americas The oceanic climate exists in an arc spreading across the north-western coast of North America from the Alaskan panhandle to northern California, in general the coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest. It includes the western parts of Washington and Oregon, the Alaskan panhandle, western portions of British Columbia, and north-western California. In addition, some east coast areas such as some higher elevations along the southern Appalachian Mountains as well as Block Island, Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket have a similar climate. An extensive area of oceanic climates distinguishes the coastal regions of southern Chile and extends into bordering Argentina. All mid-latitude oceanic climates are classified as humid. However, some rainshadow climates feature thermal r√©gimes similar to those of oceanic climates but with steppe-like (BSk) or even desert-like (BWk) scarcity of precipitation. Despite the oceanic-like thermal regimes, these areas are generally classified as steppe or desert climates. These arid versions of oceanic climates are found in eastern Washington and Oregon to the east of the Cascade Range in the United States, in the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia in Canada, Patagonia in southern Argentina, and the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. Africa The only noteworthy area of Maritime Climate at or near sea-level within Africa is in South Africa from Mossel Bay on the Western Cape coast to Plettenberg Bay, with additional pockets of this climate inland of the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal coast. It is usually warm most of the year with no pronounced rainy season, but slightly more rain in autumn and spring. The Tristan da Cunha archipelago in the South Atlantic also has an oceanic climate. Asia and Oceania The oceanic climate is prevalent in the more southerly parts of Oceania. A mild maritime climate is in existence in New Zealand. It occurs in a few areas of Australia, namely in the southeast, although average high temperatures during summers there tend to be higher and the summers drier than is typical of oceanic climates, with summer maxima sometimes exceeding . The climate is found in Tasmania, southern half of Victoria and southeastern New South Wales (southwards from Wollongong). This climate is found on the Asian mainland in mountainous areas of the tropics, such as the foothills of the Himalayas and southwest China. Parts of the northeastern coast of Honshu, from Mutsu, Aomori towards Miyako, Iwate in Japan, feature this climate. Indian Ocean √éle Amsterdam and √éle Saint-Paul, both part of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, are located in the subtropics and have an oceanic climate (akin to Tristan da Cunha; see above). Varieties Subtropical highland variety (Cfb, Cwb) Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka The subtropical highland variety of the oceanic climate exists in elevated portions of the world that are within either the tropics or subtropics, though it is typically found in mountainous locations in some tropical countries. Despite the latitude, the higher altitudes of these regions mean that the climate tends to share characteristics with oceanic climates, though it can experience noticeably drier weather during the lower- sun \\"winter\\" season. In locations outside the tropics, other than the drying trend in the winter, subtropical highland climates tend to be essentially identical to an oceanic climate, with mild summers and noticeably cooler winters, plus, in some instances, some snowfall. In the tropics, a subtropical highland climate tends to feature spring-like weather year-round. Temperatures there remain relatively constant throughout the year and snowfall is seldom seen. Areas with this climate feature monthly averages below but above (or using American standards). At least one month's average temperature is below . Without their elevation, many of these regions would likely feature either tropical or humid subtropical climates. This type of climate exists in parts of east, south and southeastern Africa, interior southern Africa and elevated portions of eastern Africa as far north as Mozambique and of western Africa (west region of Cameroon) up to the southwestern Angola highlands also share this climate type. The exposed areas of High Atlas, some mountainous areas across southern Europe, mountainous sections of North America, including parts of the southern Appalachians, Central and South America and in the highest parts of the states of Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paran√°, S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Esp√≠rito Santo in Brazil, most of Yunnan and mountainous areas across Southeast Asia, parts of the Himalayas and parts of Sri Lanka. A climate type similar to this exists in the Northern Tablelands and Central Tablelands region of New South Wales in Australia, with more uniform rainfall distribution, and would have characteristics of the Cfa climate. They would also have a high diurnal temperature variation and low humidity, owing to their inland location and relatively high elevation.  Marine west coast (Cfb)  Temperate oceanic climates, also known as \\"marine mild winter\\" climatesMichael Pidwirny, 2017, Appendix 3: K√∂ppen Climate Classification: Single appendix from the eBook Understanding Physical Geography. Kelowna BC, Canada; Our Planet Earth Publishing, pp. 8, 24. or simply oceanic climates, are found either at middle latitudes. They are often found on or near the west coast of continents; hence another name for Cfb, \\"marine west coast climates\\". In addition to moderate temperatures year-round, one of the characteristics is the absence of a dry season. Except for western Europe, this type of climate is confined to narrow bands of territory, largely in mid or high latitudes, although it can appear in elevated areas of continental terrain in low latitudes, e.g. plateaus in the subtropics. It exists in both hemispheres between 35¬∞ and 60¬∞: at low altitudes between Mediterranean, humid continental, and subarctic climates. Western sea breezes ease temperatures, especially if warm sea currents are present, and cause cloudy weather to predominate. Precipitation is constant, especially in colder months, when temperatures are warmer than elsewhere at comparable latitudes. This climate can occur farther inland if no mountain ranges are present. As this climate causes sufficient moisture year-round without permitting deep snow cover, vegetation typically prospers in this climate. Deciduous trees are predominant in this climate region. However, conifers such as spruce, pine, and cedar are also common in few areas, and fruits such as apples, pears, and grapes can often be cultivated here. In the hottest month, the average temperature is below , and at least four months feature average temperatures higher than . The average temperature of the coldest month must be , or the climate will be classified as continental. The average temperature variations in the year are between , with average annual temperatures between . Rain values can vary from , depending on whether mountains cause orographic precipitation. Frontal cyclones can be common in marine west coast regions, with some areas experiencing more than 150 rainy days annually, but strong storms are rare. S√£o Joaquim, Brazil Cfb climates are predominant in most of Europe except the northeast, as global temperature became warmer towards late 20th and early 21st century. However, just few decades ago, oceanic climate was only present in parts of Western Europe, including northern Spain, Northwestern Portugal (mountains), Belgium, Britain, France, Ireland and the Netherlands. They are the main climate type in New Zealand and the Australian states of Tasmania, Victoria and southeastern New South Wales (starting from the Illawarra region). In North America, they are found mainly in Washington, Oregon, Vancouver Island and neighbouring parts of British Columbia, as well as many coastal areas of southwest Alaska. There are pockets of Cfb in most South American countries, including many parts of Southern Chile, parts of the provinces of Chubut, Santa Cruz and southeast Buenos Aires province in Argentina. In Western Asia small pockets are found close to sea level on the Black Sea coast of northern Turkey and Georgia. While Cfb zones are rare in Africa, one dominates the coastline of the Eastern Cape in South Africa, and also the Gurage Zone of Ethiopia. The climate subtype can also be found in Nantucket, Massachusetts (in the immediate west and northwest in transition for humid continental, the remainder of Cape Cod) Subpolar variety (Cfc, Cwc) Areas with subpolar oceanic climates feature an oceanic climate but are usually located closer to polar regions, or at higher altitudes. As a result of their location, these regions tend to be on the cool end of oceanic climates. Snowfall tends to be more common here than in other oceanic climates. Subpolar oceanic climates are less prone to temperature extremes than subarctic climates or continental climates, featuring milder winters than these climates. Subpolar oceanic climates feature only one to three months of average monthly temperatures that are at least 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F). As with oceanic climates, none of its average monthly temperatures fall below -3.0 ¬∞C (26.6 ¬∞F) or 0 ¬∞C depending on the isotherm used. Typically, these areas in the warmest month experience daytime maximum temperatures below 17 ¬∞C (63 ¬∞F), while the coldest month features highs near or slightly above freezing and lows just below freezing. It typically carries a Cfc designation, though very small areas in Yunnan, Sichuan and parts of Argentina and Bolivia have summers sufficiently short to be Cwc with fewer than four months over .[hal.archives- ouvertes.fr/docs/00/29/88/18/PDF/hessd-4-439-2007.pdf] El Alto, Bolivia, is one the few confirmed towns that features this rare variation of the subpolar oceanic climate. The more warm summer/cool winter variation of this climate type is also sometimes known as a \\"continental maritime climate\\" as it often has more in common with continental climates than with tundra climates. An example of this is Bod√∏, Norway, which like nearby Harstad has moderately cold, snowy winters and mild to warm summers making this somewhat of a cool summer version of a four-season climate. Mountain summits of Scotland, both the North Island, and the South Island of New Zealand, the Alaskan Panhandle, Vancouver Island of Canada, Tasmania, Tierra del Fuego, and Patagonia experience the subpolar variety, meaning that they have moderate to cool summers, and snowy winters. This variant of an oceanic climate is found in parts of coastal Iceland, the Faroe Islands, parts of Scotland, northwestern coastal areas of Norway such as Lofoten and reaching to 70¬∞N on some islands,Weather statistics for Hasvik (Finnmark) uplands near the coast of southwestern Norway, the Aleutian Islands of Alaska and northern parts of the Alaskan Panhandle, the far south of Chile and Argentina, and a few highland areas of Tasmania, and the Australian and Southern Alps. This type of climate is even found in very remote parts of the New Guinea Highlands. The classification used for this regime is Cfc. In the most marine of those areas affected by this regime, temperatures above are extreme weather events, even in the midst of summer. Temperatures above have been recorded on rare occasions in some areas of this climate, and in winter temperatures down to have seldom been recorded in some areas.

Two of his brothers (one of them, Malcolm, a clever musician and songwriter) were trained as artists, and Cecil was from childhood devoted to art with the intensity of a serious nature. Soon after his birth, the Lawsons moved to London. In 1871, Lawson was living with his parents at 15 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, along with his two older brothers Francis Wilfrid Lawson (1842-1935), a \\"historical painter and designer\\" and Malcolm Leonard Lawson (1847-1918), a \\"professor of music.\\" Lawson's first works were studies of fruit, flowers, etc., in the manner of William Henry Hunt; followed by riverside Chelsea subjects. His first exhibit at the Royal Academy (1870) was Cheyne Walk, and in 1871 he sent two other Chelsea subjects. These gained full recognition from fellow-artists, if not from the public. Among his friends were now numbered Fred Walker, GJ Pinwell and their associates. Following them, he made a certain number of drawings for wood-engraving. In 1871 he contributed Summer Showers to a mixed charity exhibition held in support of those affected by the Franco-Prussian War.The painting was contributed by the artist to the 'Exhibition for the Benefit of the Distressed Peasantry of France', London in 1871 (no.101) and priced 7 guineas. Lawson's Chelsea pictures had been painted in rather sombre tones; in A Hymn to Spring (1871-72; Santa Barbara Museum of Art) which was rejected by the Academy, he turned to a more colourful approach, helped by work done in North Wales and Ireland. Early in 1874 he made a short tour in the Netherlands, Belgium and Paris; and in the summer he painted the Kent countryside in his large The Hop-Gardens of England (1874; Tate, London). This was much praised at the Academy of 1876. Lawson's triumph was with the luxuriant canvas, The Minister's Garden, exhibited in 1878 at the Grosvenor Gallery, and afterwards on display in the Manchester Art Gallery. This was followed by several works conceived in a new and tragic mood. Lawson's health began to fail, but he worked on. His later subjects are from the neighbourhood where he lived (the most famous being The August Moon, now Tate Britain, London) or from Yorkshire. Towards the end of 1881 he went to the French Riviera, returned in the spring. Lawson suffered a relapse, and a visit to Eastbourne proved of no benefit. He died at West Brompton, of inflammation of the lungs, on 10 June 1882, and was buried at Haslemere. Assessment Lawson may be said to have restored to English landscape the tradition of Thomas Gainsborough, John Crome and John Constable, infused with an imaginative intensity of his own. Among English landscape painters of the latter part of the 19th century his is an outstanding name. Family In 1879 he married Constance Birnie Philip (1854-1929), a daughter (and eldest child) of the sculptor John Birnie Philip, and settled at Haslemere. Constance's eldest sister Beatrix later married James McNeill Whistler in 1888, which would have made Lawson and Whistler brothers-in-law had Lawson lived. Constance and Cecil had one son, Cecil Constant Philip Lawson (1880-1967). Work File:A Hymn to Spring.jpgA Hymn to Spring, 1871. Oil on canvas.

Hunt was \\"one of the key figures in nineteenth-century English watercolour painting. His work was extensively collected in his lifetime, particularly his genre pictures of children, often in humorous situations, and his detailed, naturalistic still lifes of fruit, flowers, and birds' nests that earned him the nickname ‚ÄòBird‚Äôs Nest‚Äô Hunt.\\" Early life Hunt was born at 8 Old Belton Street, now 7 Endell Street, near Covent Garden on 23 March 1790. His father, John Hunt, was a tin- plate worker, making and selling small containers, such as canisters and boxes, which he also decorated. Hunt's uncle, a butcher, is recorded as having said of the artist, \\"He was always a poor cripple, and as he was fit for nothing, they made an artist of him.\\" This is at least partially true, as Hunt had deformed legs that hampered his movement and may well have contributed to his eventual abandonment of landscape work in favor of still life and figures. In 1806 Hunt persuaded his father to allow him to train as an artist,Witt p.32 becoming apprenticed for a term of seven years to John Varley, the watercolorist, drawing master, astrologer, and a close friend of William Blake. Apparently Hunt made good progress under Varley's tutelage, as he exhibited three oil paintings at the Royal Academy in 1807 and continued to exhibit there for several years following. In 1808 he was admitted as a student to the Royal Academy Schools. Through VarleyWitt, p. 35, Hunt was introduced into the circle of the collector, amateur, and patron of artists Dr. Thomas Monro, Principal Physician of Bethlem Hospital, whose informal drawing academy attracted many gifted young artists. Artists met at the doctor's home in Adelphi Terrace on winter evenings and also at his country home at Bushey, Hertfordshire Witt, p. 35 The doctor often invited Hunt to Bushey for extended periods, to paint from nature under the doctor's instructionRedgrave p. 443. William Henry Hunt, Bushey Churchyard, c. 1822, Watercolor, pen and brown ink, and graphiteAccording to Martin Hardie, \\"Some of [Hunt's] most charming outdoor drawings were made round about Bushey, 'where he was trundled on a sort of barrow with a hood over it...while he made sketches'.\\" Hardie, p.105. Dr. Munro's patronage proved critical to Hunt's progress as an artistSelborne and Payne, p. 9. Society of Painters in Water Colours By 1822 Hunt was living independently of his family. From 1822 to 1825 he again exhibited at the Royal Academy, after which he ceased entirely.Witt, p. 41 This may be because on 9 April 1824 he was elected an associate member of the Society of Painters in Water-Colours, becoming a full member two years later, in June 1826.Witt, p. 42 From his earliest contributions until 1864, the year he died, Hunt was a prolific exhibitor at the society's annual exhibitions, contributing a total of 765 works in all.Witt, pp. 219-228 Painting style Lobster, Crab, and a Cucumber by Hunt (1826 or 1827) Chaffinch Nest and May Blossom, c.1845 Hunt's early work shows the influence of his teacher, John Varley, as well as his patron, Dr. Thomas Munro and Henry Edridge, a close associate of Munro. Architectural subjects and country landscapes dominated his early work. Loose drawing in pencil or pen and fluid, clear color washes are the hallmarks. His subjects, especially those of his later life, are often simple; but, considered technically, his works exhibit all the resources of the watercolour painter's craft, from the purest transparent tinting to the boldest use of gouache, stippling on prepared opaque grounds, use of rough paper, and scraping for highlights and texture. His sense of colour is perhaps as true as that of any English artist. He was, says John Ruskin, all in all, the finest ever painter of still life. Several characteristic examples of Hunt's work, as the Boy with a Goat, A Brown Study, Plums, and Primroses and Birds' Nests are in the Victoria and Albert Museum. According to the Redgraves, \\"The works of Hunt differ widely from his contemporaries: they have a character of their own, and many qualities which place him as an artist, in his somewhat narrow range, on a level with the highest.\\"Redgraves, p.445. Death Hunt died of apoplexy on 10 February 1864. He was buried in Highgate Cemetery on 15 February 1864, attended to the grave by a number of artist colleagues.

It is both one of the most widely distributed psilocybin mushrooms in nature, and one of the most potent. The mushrooms have a distinctive conical to bell- shaped cap, up to in diameter, with a small nipple-like protrusion on the top. They are yellow to brown, covered with radial grooves when moist, and fade to a lighter color as they mature. Their stipes tend to be slender and long, and the same color or slightly lighter than the cap. The gill attachment to the stipe is adnexed (narrowly attached), and they are initially cream-colored before tinting purple as the spores mature. The spores are dark purplish-brown in mass, ellipsoid in shape, and measure 10.5‚Äì15 by 6.5‚Äì8.5 micrometres. The mushroom grows in grassland habitats, especially wetter areas. But unlike P. cubensis, the fungus does not grow directly on dung; rather, it is a saprobic species that feeds off decaying grass roots. It is widely distributed in the temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, and has been reported occasionally in temperate areas of the Southern Hemisphere as well. The earliest reliable history of P. semilanceata intoxication dates back to 1799 in London, and in the 1960s the mushroom was the first European species confirmed to contain psilocybin. The possession or sale of psilocybin mushrooms is illegal in many countries. Taxonomy and naming The species was first described by Elias Magnus Fries as Agaricus semilanceatus in his 1838 Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici. Paul Kummer transferred it to Psilocybe in 1871 when he raised many of Fries's sub-groupings of Agaricus to the level of genus. Panaeolus semilanceatus, named by Jakob Emanuel Lange in both 1936 and 1939 publications, is a synonym. According to the taxonomical database MycoBank, several taxa once considered varieties of P. semilanceata are synonymous with the species now known as Psilocybe strictipes: the caerulescens variety described by Pier Andrea Saccardo in 1887 (originally named Agaricus semilanceatus var. coerulescens by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke in 1881), the microspora variety described by Rolf Singer in 1969, and the obtusata variety described by Marcel Bon in 1985. Several molecular studies published in the 2000s demonstrated that Psilocybe, as it was defined then, was polyphyletic. The studies supported the idea of dividing the genus into two clades, one consisting of the bluing, hallucinogenic species in the family Hymenogastraceae, and the other the non-bluing, non-hallucinogenic species in the family Strophariaceae. However, the generally accepted lectotype (a specimen later selected when the original author of a taxon name did not designate a type) of the genus as a whole was Psilocybe montana, which is a non-bluing, non-hallucinogenic species. If the non-bluing, non-hallucinogenic species in the study were to be segregated, it would have left the hallucinogenic clade without a valid name. To resolve this dilemma, several mycologists proposed in a 2005 publication to conserve the name Psilocybe, with P. semilanceata as the type. As they explained, conserving the name Psilocybe in this way would prevent nomenclatural changes to a well-known group of fungi, many species of which are \\"linked to archaeology, anthropology, religion, alternate life styles, forensic science, law enforcement, laws and regulation\\". Further, the name P. semilanceata had historically been accepted as the lectotype by many authors in the period 1938‚Äì68. The proposal to conserve the name Psilocybe, with P. semilanceata as the type was accepted unanimously by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi in 2009. The mushroom takes its common name from the Phrygian cap, also known as the \\"liberty cap\\", which it resembles; P. semilanceata shares its common name with P. pelliculosa, a species from which it is more or less indistinguishable in appearance. The Latin word for Phrygian cap is pileus, nowadays the technical name for what is commonly known as the \\"cap\\" of a fungal fruit body. In the 18th century Phrygian caps were placed on Liberty poles, which resemble the stipe of the mushroom. The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek psilos (œàŒπŒªœåœÇ) (\\"smooth\\" or \\"bare\\") and the Byzantine Greek kub√™ (Œ∫œçŒ≤Œ∑) (\\"head\\"). The specific epithet comes from the Latin semi (\\"half\\" or \\"somewhat\\") and lanceata, from lanceolatus, meaning \\"spear-shaped\\". Description A collection from Norway *Pileus: The cap of P. semilanceata is in diameter and tall. It varies in shape from sharply conical to bell- shaped, often with a prominent papilla (a nipple-shaped structure), and does not change shape considerably as it ages. The cap margin is initially rolled inward but unrolls to become straight or even curled upwards in maturity. The cap is hygrophanous, meaning it assumes different colors depending on its state of hydration. When it is moist, the cap is ochraceous to pale brown to dark chestnut brown, but darker in the center, often with a greenish-blue tinge. When moist, radial grooves (striations) can be seen on the cap that correspond to the positions of the gills underneath. When the cap is dry, it becomes much paler, a light yellow-brown color. Moist mushrooms have sticky surfaces that result from a thin gelatinous film called a pellicle. This film becomes apparent if a piece of the cap is broken by bending it back and peeling away the piece. When the cap dries from exposure to the sun, the film turns whitish and is no longer peelable. *Gills: On the underside of the mushroom's cap, there are between 15 and 27 individual narrow gills that are moderately crowded together, and they have a narrowly adnexed to almost free attachment to the stipe. Their color is initially pale brown, but becomes dark gray to purple-brown with a lighter edge as the spores mature. *Spore Print: deep reddish purple-brown color *Stipe: The slender yellowish-brown stipe is long by thick, and usually slightly thicker towards the base. *Veil: The mushroom has a thin cobweb-like partial veil that does not last long before disappearing; sometimes, the partial veil leaves an annular zone on the stipe that may be darkened by spores. The flesh is thin and membrane-like, and roughly the same color as the surface tissue. *Taste:farinaceous *Odor: farinaceous *Stain: All parts of the mushroom will stain a bluish color if handled or bruised, and it may naturally turn blue with age. Microscopic characteristics In deposit, the spores are a deep reddish purple-brown color. The use of a light microscope can reveal further details: the spores are oblong when seen in side view, and oblong to oval in frontal view, with dimensions of 10.5‚Äì15 by 6.5‚Äì8.5 Œºm. The basidia (spore bearing cells of the hymenium), are 20‚Äì31 by 5‚Äì9 Œºm, four-spored, and have clamps at their bases; there are no basidia found on the sterile gill edge. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) measure 15‚Äì30 by 4‚Äì7 Œºm, and are flask-shaped with long thin necks that are 1‚Äì3.5 Œºm wide. P. semilanceata does not have pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The cap cuticle is up to 90 Œºm thick, and is made of a tissue layer called an ixocutis‚Äîa gelatinized layer of hyphae lying parallel to the cap surface. The hyphae comprising the ixocutis are cylindrical, hyaline, and 1‚Äì3.5 Œºm wide. Immediately under the cap cuticle is the subpellis, made of hyphae that are 4‚Äì12 Œºm wide with yellowish-brown encrusted walls. There are clamp connections present in the hyphae of all tissues. Other forms The anamorphic form of P. semilanceata is an asexual stage in the fungus's life cycle involved in the development of mitotic diaspores (conidia). In culture, grown in a petri dish, the fungus forms a white to pale orange cottony or felt-like mat of mycelia. The conidia formed are straight to curved, measuring 2.0‚Äì8.0 by 1.1‚Äì2.0 Œºm, and may contain one to several small intracellular droplets. Although little is known of the anamorphic stage of P. semilanceata beyond the confines of laboratory culture, in general, the morphology of the asexual structures may be used as classical characters in phylogenetic analyses to help understand the evolutionary relationships between related groups of fungi. Scottish mycologist Roy Watling described sequestrate (truffle-like) or secotioid versions of P. semilanceata he found growing in association with regular fruit bodies. These versions had elongated caps, long and wide at the base, with the inward curved margins closely hugging the stipe from the development of membranous flanges. Their gills were narrow, closely crowded together, and anastomosed (fused together in a vein-like network). The color of the gills was sepia with a brownish vinaceous (red wine-colored) cast, and a white margin. The stipes of the fruit bodies were long by thick, with about of stipe length covered by the extended cap. The thick-walled ellipsoid spores were 12.5‚Äì13.5 by 6.5‚Äì7 Œºm. Despite the significant differences in morphology, molecular analysis showed the secotioid version to be the same species as the typical morphotype. Similar species There are several other Psilocybe species that may be confused with P. semilanceata due to similarities in physical appearance. P. strictipes is a slender grassland species that is differentiated macroscopically from P. semilanceata by the lack of a prominent papilla. P. mexicana, commonly known as the \\"Mexican liberty cap\\", is also similar in appearance, but is found in manure-rich soil in subtropical grasslands in Mexico. It has somewhat smaller spores than P. semilanceata, typically 8‚Äì9.9 by 5.5‚Äì7.7 Œºm. Another lookalike species is P. samuiensis, found in Thailand, where it grows in well-manured clay-like soils or among paddy fields. This mushroom can be distinguished from P. semilanceata by its smaller cap, up to in diameter, and its rhomboid-shaped spores. P. pelliculosa is physically similar to such a degree that it may be indistinguishable in the field. It differs from P. semilanceata by virtue of its smaller spores, measuring 9‚Äì13 by 5‚Äì7 Œºm. P. semilanceata has also been confused with the toxic muscarine-containing species Inocybe geophylla,Bresinsky and Besl (1989), pp. 115‚Äì16. a whitish mushroom with a silky cap, yellowish-brown to pale grayish gills, and a dull yellowish-brown spore print. Ecology and habitat Psilocybe semilanceata is a saprobic grassland species. Psilocybe semilanceata fruits solitarily or in groups on rich and acidic soil, typically in grasslands, such as meadows, pastures, or lawns. It is often found in pastures that have been fertilized with sheep or cow dung, although it does not typically grow directly on the dung. P. semilanceata, like all others species of the genus Psilocybe, is a saprobic fungus, meaning it obtains nutrients by breaking down organic matter. The mushroom is also associated with sedges in moist areas of fields, and it is thought to live on the decaying root remains. Like some other grassland psilocybin mushroom species such as P. mexicana, P. tampanensis and Conocybe cyanopus, P. semilanceata may form sclerotia, a dormant form of the fungus, which affords it some protection from wildfires and other natural disasters. Laboratory tests have shown P. semilanceata to suppress the growth of the soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, a virulent plant pathogen that causes the disease root rot. When grown in dual culture with other saprobic fungi isolated from the rhizosphere of grasses from its habitat, P. semilanceata significantly suppresses their growth. This antifungal activity, which can be traced at least partly to two phenolic compounds it secretes, helps it compete successfully with other fungal species in the intense competition for nutrients provided by decaying plant matter. Using standard antimicrobial susceptibility tests, Psilocybe semilanceata was shown to strongly inhibit the growth of the human pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The source of the antimicrobial activity is unknown. Distribution Psilocybe authority Gast√≥n Guzm√°n, in his 1983 monograph on psilocybin mushrooms, considered Psilocybe semilanceata the world's most widespread psilocybin mushroom species, as it has been reported on 17 countries. In Europe, P. semilanceata has a widespread distribution, and is found in Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Channel Islands, Czech republic, Denmark, Estonia, the Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and Pakistan. It is generally agreed that the species is native to Europe; Watling has demonstrated that there exists little difference between specimens collected from Spain and Scotland, at both the morphological and genetic level. The mushroom also has a widespread distribution in North America. In Canada it has been collected from British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Ontario and Quebec. In the United States, it is most common in the Pacific Northwest, west of the Cascade Mountains, where it fruits abundantly in autumn and early winter; fruiting has also been reported to occur infrequently during spring months. Charles Horton Peck reported the mushroom to occur in New York in the early 20th century, and consequently, much literature published since then has reported the species to be present in the eastern United States. Gaston Guzman later examined Peck's herbarium specimen, and in his comprehensive 1983 monograph on Psilocybe, concluded that Peck had misidentified it with the species now known as Panaeolina foenisecii. P. semilanceata is much less common in South America, where it has been recorded in Chile. It is also known in Australia (where it may be an introduced species) and New Zealand, where it grows in high-altitude grasslands. In 2000, it was reported from Golaghat, in the Indian state of Assam. P.semilanceata is also found in Kodaikanal hill region in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. Psychoactive use 1, 2 & 3 in the figure are Psilocybe semilanceata, which Sowerby wrongly thought was the same as Stropharia semiglobata. The first reliably documented report of Psilocybe semilanceata intoxication involved a British family in 1799, who prepared a meal with mushrooms they had picked in London's Green Park. According to the chemist Augustus Everard Brande, the father and his four children experienced typical symptoms associated with ingestion, including pupil dilation, spontaneous laughter and delirium. The identification of the species responsible was made possible by James Sowerby's 1803 book Coloured Figures of English Fungi or Mushrooms, which included a description of the fungus, then known as Agaricus glutinosus (originally described by Moses Ashley Curtis in 1780). According to German mycologist Jochen Gartz, the description of the species is \\"fully compatible with current knowledge about Psilocybe semilanceata.\\" In the early 1960s, the Swiss scientist Albert Hofmann‚Äîknown for the synthesis of the psychedelic drug LSD‚Äîchemically analyzed P. semilanceata fruit bodies collected in Switzerland and France by the botanist Roger Heim. Using the technique of paper chromatography, Hofmann confirmed the presence of 0.25% (by weight) psilocybin in dried samples. Their 1963 publication was the first report of psilocybin in a European mushroom species; previously, it had been known only in Psilocybe species native to Mexico, Asia and North America. This finding was confirmed in the late 1960s with specimens from Scotland and England, Czechoslovakia (1973), Germany (1977), Norway (1978), and Belgium and Finland (1984). In 1965, forensic characterization of psilocybin-containing mushrooms seized from college students in British Columbia identified P. semilanceata‚Äîthe first recorded case of intentional recreational use of the mushroom in Canada. The presence of the psilocybin analog baeocystin was confirmed in 1977. Several studies published since then support the idea that the variability of psilocybin content in P. semilanceata is low, regardless of country of origin.For example:  * Properties Several studies have quantified the amounts of hallucinogenic compounds found in the fruit bodies of Psilocybe semilanceata. In 1993, Gartz reported an average of 1% psilocybin (expressed as a percentage of the dry weight of the fruit bodies), ranging from a minimum of 0.2% to a maximum of 2.37%, which is the highest psilocybin concentration reported for a mushroom. In an earlier analysis, Tjakko Stijve and Thom Kuyper (1985) found a high concentration in a single specimen (1.7%) in addition to a relatively high concentration of baeocystin (0.36%). Smaller specimens tend to have the highest percent concentrations of psilocybin, but the absolute amount is highest in larger mushrooms. A Finnish study assayed psilocybin concentrations in old herbarium specimens, and concluded that although psilocybin concentration decreased linearly over time, it was relatively stable. They were able to detect the chemical in specimens that were 115 years old. Michael Beug and Jeremy Bigwood, analyzing specimens from the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, reported psilocybin concentrations ranging from 0.62% to 1.28%, averaging 1.0 ¬±0.2%. They concluded that the species was one of the most potent, as well as the most constant in psilocybin levels. In a 1996 publication, Paul Stamets defined a \\"potency rating scale\\" based on the total content of psychoactive compounds (including psilocybin, psilocin, and baeocystin) in 12 species of Psilocybe mushrooms. Although there are certain caveats with this technique‚Äîsuch as the unconfirmed assumption that these compounds contribute equally to psychoactive properties‚Äîit serves as a rough comparison of potency between species. Despite its small size, Psilocybe semilanceata is considered a \\"moderately active to extremely potent\\" hallucinogenic mushroom (meaning the combined percentage of psychoactive compounds is typically between 0.25% to greater than 2%), and of the 12 mushrooms compared, only 3 were more potent: P. azurescens, P. baeocystis, and P. bohemica. According to Gartz (1995), P. semilanceata is Europe's most popular psychoactive species. Several reports have been published in the literature documenting the effects of consumption of P. semilanceata. Typical symptoms include visual distortions of color, depth and form, progressing to visual hallucinations. The effects are similar to the experience following consumption of LSD, although milder. Common side effects of mushroom ingestion include pupil dilation, increased heart rate, unpleasant mood, and overresponsive reflexes. As is typical of the symptoms associated with psilocybin mushroom ingestion, \\"the effect on mood in particular is dependent on the subject's pre-exposure personality traits\\", and \\"identical doses of psilocybin may have widely differing effects in different individuals.\\" Although most cases of intoxication resolve without incident, there have been isolated cases with severe consequences, especially after higher dosages or persistent use. In one case reported in Poland in 1998, an 18-year-old man developed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, arrhythmia, and suffered myocardial infarction after ingesting P. semilanceata frequently over the period of a month. The cardiac damage and myocardial infarction was suggested to be a result of either coronary vasoconstriction, or because of platelet hyperaggregation and occlusion of small coronary arteries. Danger of misidentification One danger of attempting to consume hallucinogenic or other wild mushrooms, especially for novice mushroom hunters, is the possibility of misidentification with toxic species. In one noted case, an otherwise healthy young Austrian man mistook the poisonous Cortinarius rubellus for P. semilanceata. As a result, he suffered end-stage kidney failure, and required a kidney transplant. In another instance, a young man developed cardiac abnormalities similar to those seen in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, characterized by a sudden temporary weakening of the myocardium. A polymerase chain reaction-based test to specifically identity P. semilanceata was reported by Polish scientists in 2007. Poisonous Psathyrella species can easily be misidentified as liberty caps. Legal status The legal status of psilocybin mushrooms varies worldwide. Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as Class A (United Kingdom) or Schedule I (US) drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The possession and use of psilocybin mushrooms, including P. semilanceata, is therefore prohibited by extension. Although many European countries remained open to the use and possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms after the US ban, starting in the 2000s (decade) there has been a tightening of laws and enforcements. In the Netherlands, where the drug was once routinely sold in licensed cannabis coffee shops and smart shops, laws were instituted in October 2008 to prohibit the possession or sale of psychedelic mushrooms‚Äîthe final European country to do so. They are legal in Jamaica and Brazil and decriminalised in Portugal. In the United States, the city of Denver, Colorado, voted in May, 2019 to decriminalize the use and possession of psilocybin mushrooms. Current grassroots efforts for an Oregon ballot measure in the US would legalize psychedelic mushrooms for recreation and therapeutic treatment in that state. Sweden The Riksdag added Psilocybe semilanceata to Narcotic Drugs Punishments Act under Swedish schedule I (\\"substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use\\") as of October 1, 1997, published by Medical Products Agency (MPA) in regulation LVFS 1997:12 listed as Psilocybe semilanceata (toppsl√§tskivling).https://lakemedelsverket.se/upload/lvfs/konsoliderade/LVFS_1997_12_konsoliderad_tom_2011_2.pdf See also * List of Psilocybe species * Mushroom hunting References Cited texts   Category:Entheogens Category:Fungi described in 1838 Category:Fungi of Asia Category:Fungi of Australia Category:Fungi of Europe Category:Fungi of New Zealand Category:Fungi of North America Category:Fungi of South America Category:Fungi of Sweden Category:Fungi of Finland semilanceata Category:Psychedelic tryptamine carriers Category:Psychoactive fungi Category:Taxa named by Elias Magnus Fries ","title":"Psilocybe semilanceata"},{"id":"560063","text":"Hillbrow Tower (right) with Ponte Apartment building and the skyline of Hillbrow. Hillbrow () is an inner city residential neighbourhood of Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, South Africa. It is known for its high levels of population density, unemployment, poverty, prostitution and crime. In the 1970s it was an Apartheid-designated \\"whites only\\" area but soon became a \\"grey area\\", where people of different ethnicities lived together. It acquired a cosmopolitan and politically progressive feel, and was one of the first identifiable gay and lesbian areas in urban South Africa. However, due to the mass growth of the population of poor and unemployed black people after the end of Apartheid, crime soared and the streets became strewn with rubbish. This, together with lack of investment and fear led to an exodus of middle class residents in the 1980s and the decay of major buildings, leaving in its wake an urban slum by the 1990s. Today, the majority of the residents are incoming migrants from the townships, rural areas and the rest of Africa, many living in abject poverty. An urban regeneration programme is underway. There are street markets, mainly used by local residents, and the Johannesburg Art Gallery contains work by major local artists including William Kentridge. History Prior to the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand in 1886, the suburb laid on government owned land called Randjeslaagte that now makes up the Johannesburg CBD. It was a triangular shaped piece of waste land not used for farming and the future suburb lies in the northern apex of the triangle. The origin of its name is simple, the suburb lies on the brow of the east west mountain ridge that crosses the Johannesburg CBD. The land was owned as claims by J. Nicholls who sold them to Transvaal Mortgage, Loan & Finance Company. It was laid out as a residential suburb during 1894 and 1895, with Richard Currie auctioning the stands. In 1897 it became part of Johannesburg's Sanitary Board. After World War Two, developers started purchasing the stands at values beyond their worth and eventually turned it into blocks of flats. Gay community In the mid-20th century, Hillbrow developed a reputation for its growing gay community. Many gay establishments and publications were founded in Hillbrow from the 1960s forward. The gay community was strong and large enough in Hillbrow that the conservative ruling National Party, which instituted apartheid, fielded a pro-gay rights candidate, Leon de Beer, in the 1987 elections. De Beer's victorious campaign was heavily advertised in the Hillbrow-based gay publication Exit and his campaign promises were to both advance gay rights in parliament and reinstate Hillbrow as a whites-only district. His campaign garnered enough support from the gay community that he won the election, becoming the first elected official in South Africa to run and win on a pro-gay platform. In 1990, one of the first training and information centers for HIV in South Africa was established in Hillbrow, initially catering mainly to white gay men. As the racial demographic in Hillbrow radically shifted, so too did the people in need of HIV-related care, and by the late 1990s the clinics mainly worked with black heterosexual women. Hillbrow experienced a heavy decline and most of the gay community, which was predominantly white, left the area within the decade.  In media and fiction  In 2000, Michael Hammon and Jacqueline G√∂rgen directed a documentary named Hillbrow Kids, depicting the struggles of a group of street children in post- apartheid urban South Africa. The 2001 novel Welcome to Our Hillbrow by Phaswane Mpe deals with life in the district in the years after apartheid, focusing on a large number of issues ranging from poverty, HIV/AIDS, and xenophobia. Hillbrow has also been a setting used by other South African writers: in the 2001 novel, The Restless Supermarket, Ivan Vladislavic comically portrays South Africa's transition to democracy, endowing his narrator, Aubrey Tearle, with the perspective of a conservative white pensioner. Through this lens, Hillbrow becomes representative of the larger post-apartheid South African nation. In 2007, BBC Two reporter Louis Theroux ran a documentary called Law and Disorder in Johannesburg. The documentary depicted the state of complete abandon and lawlessness in some parts of the city, specifically in Hillbrow. Much of Lauren Beukes' 2010 science fiction novel Zoo City was set in Hillbrow. In January 2013, Al Jazeera English aired a Witness documentary about Hillbrow described as \\"A personal journey to Hillbrow, where human spirit, hope and enterprise triumph in this crime-ridden melting pot in the heart of South Africa.\\" The House Group In 1990 Jean du Plessis and Adele du Plessis founded The House Group, an organization with several shelters and programs aimed at retrieving and rehabilitating female child victims of commercial sexual exploitation. The organization's first address in Hillbrow was on 52 Soper Road, close to Ponte City. In 1993 they moved to two adjacent premises on 60 Olivia Road (at the foot of the Hillbrow Tower) where the organization had The House Drop-in Centre and Intombi Shelter. At the time, in South Africa, there was no legislation allowing The House Group to conduct its mission. Legislation was in effect to help male children, but no legislation allowed for girls in shelters. The lack of a legislative framework disallowed The House Group to continue and authorities tried to shut them down. The founders appealed to the media for help. A barrage of media attention followed that rallied public support and gained international attention. According to The House Group, hundreds of print articles and television exposes occurred over several years. During 1996, The House Group was invited to deliver papers to the 1st World Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, held in Stockholm, Sweden. A hundred and fifty countries were represented at the meeting. The organization enjoyed goodwill and sponsorship from foreign governments, most notable the Royal Dutch Government and that of the USA. During 1997, the Gauteng Provincial Government proclaimed the first legislation that allowed shelters for female children. Jean du Plessis and Adele du Plessis had worked with the ministry over many years to that effect. Subsequent to 1996, hundreds of shelters and programs similar to The House Group sprouted in South Africa. The problem with children and youth victims of commercial sexual exploitation in South Africa, and Hillbrow in particular, is on the increase.  Landmarks   Constitution Hill  The Constitution Hill precinct, seat of the Constitutional Court of South Africa, is located on the western edge of Hillbrow, and is part of a major government and private sector initiative to revitalize the area and the rest of the CBD.  Hillbrow Tower  The Hillbrow Tower, a telecommunication tower, dominates the Johannesburg city skyline, featured in many picture postcard views of the city. It has become a symbol of the city and appears in the city seal. Completed in 1971, it rises to a height of 270 metres, thus making it the tallest man-made structure with a lift in Africa. Initially named the JG Strijdom Tower, it became popularly known simply as the Hillbrow tower, and in May 2005 it was renamed to Telkom Joburg Tower, with its new name displayed prominently in lights. It once featured a luxury rotating restaurant, but that was closed in 1981 due to security fears and is unlikely to be reopened.  Ponte City  Ponte City is the tallest residential building in Johannesburg and one of the city's most striking urban landmarks. It was designed by architect Rodney Grosskopff (who also designed other South African landmarks such as the Johannesburg Civic Theatre) and completed in 1975. The building is distinct due both to its height, rising to 54 storeys above one of the highest points in Johannesburg, as well as its cylindrical shape. During its prime, Ponte City was one of the city's most sought-after addresses, but with inner-city urban decay setting in, it has become run-down, over-populated, and unsafe. The building was placed under new management in 1999, and with regular maintenance reinstated and gradual restoration, coupled with council, provincial, and government initiatives to rehabilitate Hillbrow, it began to find some shine again. In February 2007, Danny Boyle, the British director of Trainspotting, announced plans to use the building as a film set in a future release.New Danny Boyle project Ponte Tower in first stage of development  Books and publications  * Daniel Conway (2009) 'Queering Apartheid: the National Party's 1987 'Gay Rights' Election Campaign in Hillbrow', Journal of Southern African Studies, 35,4: 849‚Äì863. * Glynn Griffiths and Paddy Clay, Hillbrow (Cape Town, Don Nelson, 1982) * Kgebetli Moele, Room 207 (Kwela Books, 2006) * Alan Morris, Bleakness and Light: Inner City Transition in Hillbrow, Johannesburg (Johannesburg, University of Witwatersrand Press, 1999) * Phaswane Mpe, Welcome to Our Hillbrow (Pietermaritzburg, University of KwaZulu-Natal Press, 2001) * Ivan Vladislavic, The Restless Supermarket (Cape Town, David Philip, 2001)  Music  * Hillbrow by Johannes Kerkorrel, from the album Eet Kreef (Shifty Records, 1989). * Hillbrow by Stef Bos, from the album Jy vir My. * Hillbrow by Manfred Mann's Earth Band, from the CD box Odds & Sods ‚Äì Mis-takes & Out-takes See also *Jerusalema ‚Äì 2008 South African film portraying life in Hillbrow References External links * Hillbrow Tower * www.thehousegroup.org Hillbrow Category:Urban decay in South Africa Category:Red-light districts in South Africa ","title":"Hillbrow"},{"id":"560068","text":"George John Pinwell (London 26 December 1842 - 8 September 1875 London), was a British illustrator and watercolourist. Biography Pinwell was born on 26 December 1842 at 12 Great Mays Buildings, London. He was baptised on 27 July 1845, at St. Mark's, Surbiton, south-west London, along with his younger brother Henry (born c. 1845). His parents were John Pinwell, a carpenter or builder, and his wife, Mary Ann Baker. Pinwell's father was thought to have been involved in building the original Surbiton railway station in south-west London. His mother was \\"a rough, illiterate woman\\", and \\"a rough and determined person.\\" Pinwell's father dies in 1854, leaving the family in very straightened circumstances. He apparently worked as a butterman's boy in the City Road, London whose work, among other things was to stand outside the shop on Saturday nights shouting \\"BuyBuyBuy!\\" He then worked making designs for a firm of embroiderers. In the 1861 census he recorded his occupation as \\"designer of Embroidery\\". His two younger brothers Henry (born c. 1845) and Alfred (born c. 1847), both had their occupation listed as house carpenter. His work on embroidery design led to him meeting his future wife Isabella Marcy Stevens (c. 1843first quarter of 1923) who needed a design for a difficult piece of work. The acquaintanceship grew into affection, and eventually to marriage. The couple were married at St. Marylebone in London on 24 April 1865. The 1911 census shows that the marriage was without issue. While working at the embroiderers Pinwell attended night school at St. Martin's Lane Academy. After his mother's remarriage in 1861 removed the need for him to work, he became a full time pupil at the Academy, and in 1862 he moved on to Heatherley's Academy. In the following year he was drawing on wood blocks for the Dalziel Brothers. The 1871 census shows his profession as an artist in watercolours, residing at 52 Adeliaid Road in Hampstead. In 1874 Pinwell fell seriously ill and went to North Africa for the winter and spent eight months there. He returned to London in the spring of 1875. He died of consumption on 8 September 1975 at 86 Adelaide Road, Haverstock, South Hampstead, London. His estate was valued at less than ¬£800 and his wife was the executrix. He was buried on 11 September 1875 at Highgate Cemetery. His two brothers, and two brothers-in-law, Alfred and Thomas Stevens, attended the funeral His professional friends came together after his death to raise a fund for the benefit of the widow. Many of his studies and sketches were made public after his death. A posthumous exhibition of his works was held in February to March at M. Deschamp's Gallery at 168 New Bond Street. After the exhibition, any works that were not private property were to be sold at Christie's for the benefit of the widow. George C. Williamson wrote a biography of Pinwell in 1900. However, Reid states that this was undertaken largely for the satisfaction of Pinwell's widow, and that \\"its main purpose seems to be to persuade us that Pinwell could hold his own in the most refined society\\" and to counter \\"contemporary allegations concerning his sobriety and his grammar.\\" Work Williamson states that Pinwell's his first drawing appeared in Lilliput Levee in 1862, a book of rhymes for children by Matthew Browne(a pseudonym used by William Brighty Rands) He executed several designs for the silversmiths Elkington's. He worked for Josiah Wood Whymper, not as a regular apprentice, but in an informal arrangement. At Whymper's Pinwell met J W North an apprentice of Whymper. Pinwell belonged to the small group of watercolour painters which included Frederick Walker and Arthur Boyd Houghton, whose style came from drawing on wood for book-illustration. Pinwell, Walker, and Houghton, three young men \\"who did so much for wood engraving in the sixties\\" all died in 1875 within seven months of each other. Reid notes that there is a legend that Pinwell and Walker were friends, but in reality, this was not so. Walker only once visited Pinwell's house, in 1873, and he had already left Whymper when Pinwell started there. Roget notes the many similarities between the lives of Pinwell and Walker: both died early in their careers, Pinwell was two and a half years younger than Walker, and survived him by only three months, both were partially educated at Heatherley's Academy, both began their profession as draughtsmen on wood, and in some cases worked on the same books, both died from consumption after attempting to stem it with a winter in Africa, they shared a common style, and shared common subjects, and had posthumous exhibitions at M. Deschamp's gallery in London after their deaths. Together with Walker, another pupil of Whymper, and North, Pinwell was a member of a group known as the Idyllic School or the Idealists of which Walker is seen as the leader. The name seems to come from the book Idyllic Pictures, an anthology of illustrations from The Quiver, printed from the original wood blocks, each accompanied by a poem, many of which were published for the first time. A Round of Days (George Routledge and Sons, London, 1866) also consisted of poems with individual illustrations, is \\"sometimes considered archetypally Idyllic in spirit\\", and as it contains work by Walker and North as well as Pinwell and Houghton, is probably more representative of the school. Gleeson White described it as \\"one of the finest of the illustrated gift books\\". The following five illustrations were Pinwell's contribution to A Round of Days. The Dalziel Brothers described the title as having been \\"chosen to designate a collection of Poems and Pictures representing every-day scenes, occurrences, and incidents in various phases of assistance.\\" Each poem has at least one accompanying illustration. In some cases the artist had illustrated the poem, in others the poet has tried to portray in words the ideas in an illustration.

Other well regarded pictures were The Elixir of Love, The Troth of Gilbert Becket, the Saracen Maiden the legendary mother of Thomas Becket, Out of Town, and Landlord and Tenant. He painted three major watercolours at Tangier, which were among his last works exhibited at the Royal Watercolour Society in 1875. However, The Graphic considered that, although full of interest, the Tangier pictures showed signs \\"of failing power\\". Pinwell contributed watercolours to the Dudley Gallery from 1865 onwards, and in 1869 was elected associate of the Royal Watercolour Society and then full member in 1871. In all, he exhibited fifty-nine works at the Royal Watercolour Society. Cundall states that Pinwell made many small watercolours \\"of subjects which he had already produced in black-and-white\\". His first exhibited watercolour, An Incident in the Life of Oliver Goldsmith, shown in the Dudley Gallery in 1865, was based on the themes and imagery he had used for Dalziel's Illustrated Goldsmith. In the following example the black-and-white engraving was prepared from the watercolour. Note that the engraving Joseph Swain is reversed from the watercolour, a normal feature of engravings as the final print is a mirror image of the engraving. The engraving was cropped before printing it in Once a Week on 26 June 1869. It also suffers from being marked with a partial impression of the text from the following page. This was the only illustration by Pinwell appearing in that volume of the magazine. The watercolour was one of the three paintings submitted by Pinwell for membership of the Water Colour Society. The Globe stated that the watercolour was \\"dramatic in feeling\\" and showed \\"the most accurate perception of individual character.\\" The Graphic described the work as \\"a scene of every-day observation ,yet most pathetically rendered. At one end of the bench a street musician and her child are counting their scanty gains, at the other end a soldier flirts with a nurse, while between the two sits such a specimen of shabby gentility as would have assuredly won Thackeray's heart.\\" File:Study for a Seat in the Park by Pinwel-drawing and watercolour-28x39cm.jpgA seat in the park-An early study File:Study for a seat in the park by Pinwell-pencil, watercolour, and bodycolour on paper-19.3x23cm.jpgA seat in the park-More advanced study File:A Seat in the St James's Park-by Pinewell-NSW Art Gallery-41.9x60.2 watercolour and bodycolour over pencil underdrawing.jpgA seat in the park-Finished Watercolour File:A Scene in St James Park by Pinwell-NSW Art Gallery-22.8x30.2cm print.jpgA seat in the park-A print of the illustration File:A Seat in the Park by Pinwell - Once a Week p 518 26 June 1869.jpgA seat in the park-The illustration as published Pinwell most significant book illustration work was probably the Dalziel Brothers' Illustrated Goldsmith. Pinwell drew 100 illustrations for the book over a period of six months. The book was published both in weekly and monthly parts and as a single volume by Ward and Lock. The first part was launched in the same week as Cassell's illustrated Goldsmith and led to bitter recriminations between the publishers, with Cassell's accusing Ward and Lock of having copied their idea, and of thrusting an inferior product on the public. However, Liveing states that Pinwell was a better black-and-white artist than Henry Anelay (1817-1883), who illustrated Cassell's version. Both versions were issued in weekly parts at a cost of one penny, with a monthly part at fourpence or fivepence (Cassell) or sixpence (Dalziel). Pinwell also illustrated several other books which were engraved by the Dalziels' including Jean Ingelow's poems, Robert Buchanan's Ballads of the Affections, and the Arabian Nights. Pinwell's first magazine illustration The Saturnalia Pinwell's first magazine illustration was for a poem by George Walter Thornbury called The Saturnalia, which appeared in volume eight of Once a Week on 31 January 1863. Gleeson White calls the illustration \\"a powerful but entirely untypical illustration of a classical subject by an artist who is best known for pastoral and bucolic scenes\\". Reid notes that the subject is \\"utterly remote\\" from the kind of subject that Pinwell would himself have chosen. From that time his work was in constant demand. Pinwell illustrated for a range of magazines including: *The Argosy *Cassell's Family Magazine *Churchman's Family Magazine *Fun *Good Words *Judy, or the London Serio-Comic Journal *London Society *Once a Week *Punch *Sunday at Home *The Cornhill Magazine *The Leisure Hour *The Quiver *The Sunday Magazine Assessment Modern Book Illustrators stated that the charm of Pinwell's work was \\"its vivid pictorial truth to life, its dramatic feeling.\\" The Dictionary of Victorian Painters cites Hardie as saying that Pinwell could be set beside Charles Keene \\"as one of the greatest of British draughtsmen\\" Cundall notes that Pinwell \\"executed many small water-colour paintings with a peculiar charm\\" and that much of Pinwell's work \\"has refined feeling, but it often displays imperfections in execution.\\" Houfe calls Pinwell \\"A brilliant colourist\\". Reid states that the work of an artist like Pinwell is always liable to over or under estimation. His art was \\"hampered constantly by imperfect technique\\" but that \\"its very failures are more interesting than the successes of cleverer draughtsmen.\\" In comparison to Fred Walker, Reid states that Pinwell \\"had a decorative sense far superior to Walker's\\" and that Pinwell \\"had a wider range, is infinitely more imaginative, and his work, above all, has a subjective, a lyrical quality\\". The Graphic stated that Pinwell \\"did too much to do all things well, and, on the whole, although his originality and ability were beyond question, he never did quite justice to the genuine powers he possessed.\\" The Globe noted that \\"It is significant of the fine quality of Pinwell's art that many of his works are the property of artists.\\" Notes References Further reading * George Charles Williamson, George J.

Built by the US during the Second World War, the ship operated in the United States Navy as USS Catfish (SS-339) until it in 1971 was transferred to the Argentine Navy. She served until 1982 when she was captured by the British at South Georgia after being seriously damaged and subsequently sank along a pier, with just her sail visible above the waterline. The submarine was raised, towed out of the bay and scuttled in deep waters in 1985. U.S. Navy service Catfish was launched 19 November 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Connecticut; sponsored by Mrs. J. J. Crowley; and commissioned 19 March 1945, Lieutenant Commander W. A. Overton, USNR, in command. Catfish sailed from New London 4 May 1945 for Pearl Harbor, arriving 29 June. After training and the installation of new equipment, she proceeded to Guam for special training, then departed 8 August on her first war patrol, a special mission to locate a minefield off Ky≈´sh≈´. When the cease-fire order was given 15 August, she was ordered to the Yellow Sea for surface patrol and lifeguard duty. She returned to Guam 4 September, thence to the West Coast, arriving at Seattle 29 September. Based at San Diego, Catfish operated locally on the west coast and made two cruises to the Far East during which she conducted simulated war patrols and provided services to the Seventh Fleet. Catfish was extensively modernized in a GUPPY II conversion (August 1948‚ÄìMay 1949), giving her greater submerged speed and endurance. She was on another Far Eastern cruise when war broke out in Korea in which area she made a reconnaissance patrol in support of the United Nations forces. Catfish returned to the States 20 October 1950 and was based in San Diego. After that the submarine carried out training exercises with Naval Reservists off the west coast, operated with the Canadian Forces in joint antisubmarine warfare exercises, and made several cruises to the Far East.

Later, she departed from the islands and stayed on station in the naval submarine base at the city of Mar del Plata as a large British task force approached the South Atlantic. On 12 April, Santa Fe was ordered to ferry a party of marines, based at Puerto Belgrano, and supplies to Grytviken, in South Georgia. She departed from Mar del Plata in the early hours of 17 April.B√≥veda, Jorge (2007). La Odisea del submarino Santa Fe. IPN editores, pp. 79‚Äì90. On 23 April, the Royal Navy ships , , and the ice patrol ship were sent to retake the island of South Georgia with a detachment of Royal Marines and Special Boat Squadron commandos. Santa Fe accomplished the resupply mission and landed the marines on 25 April. Members of the Argentine garrison had salvaged a crippled BAS launch, which was used to download the cargo.B√≥veda, pp. 105‚Äì106 and 122 Some hours later, after leaving Grytviken, Santa Fe was detected on radar by Lieutenant Chris Parry, the observer of the Westland Wessex HAS.3 anti-submarine helicopter from Antrim, and attacked with depth charges. This attack caused extensive internal damage, including the splitting of a ballast tank, the dismounting of electrical components and shocks to the machinery. As the submarine struggled to return to Grytviken on the surface, Plymouth launched a Westland Wasp HAS.1 helicopter, and Brilliant launched a Westland Lynx HAS.2. The Lynx dropped a Mk 46 torpedo, which failed to strike home, but strafed the submarine with its pintle-mounted 7.62 mm L7 General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG). The Wessex also fired on Santa Fe with its GPMG. The Wasp from HMS Plymouth and two other Wasps launched from Endurance fired AS-12 air-to-surface anti-ship missiles at the submarine, scoring hits. Santa Fes men and the marines onshore attempted to fight off the attack by firing their rifles, machine guns, and an old Bantam anti-tank missile at the aircraft, but the Argentine boat was damaged badly enough to prevent her from submerging or even from sailing away. The crew abandoned the listing submarine at the jetty at King Edward Point on South Georgia and surrendered, along with the Argentine garrison, to the British forces.B√≥veda, pp. 110‚Äì123 Brilliants diving officer, Lt. Chris Sherman, went down to place a charge to disable the submarine further, and blew off its rudder. Whilst under guard on the submarine by a British Royal Marine, Argentine Navy Petty Officer Felix Artuso was mistakenly shot dead on 26 April while a prisoner of war; his body was buried at Grytviken Cemetery.http://www.wildisland.gs/sgcems/gd09a.htm Artuso was shot because it was believed that he was trying to sabotage the vessel. According to some members of her crew, in the middle of the confusion that followed the incident, a number of valves and hatchways were left open, the submarine flooded and sank alongside the pier, with only her combat-damaged conning tower showing above the surface.Luego de atracar, y aprovechando la distracci√≥n de los brit√°nicos por un incidente que le hab√≠a costado la vida al suboficial F√©lix Artuso, tripulantes del submarino lograron burlar la guardia y abrieron disimuladamente v√°lvulas y escotillas de la nave, provocando su hundimiento. No s√≥lo el Santa Fe qued√≥ as√≠ inutilizable: tambi√©n el muelle. La Nacion newspaper: La guerra que no se vi√≥ 6 April 1997 After the conflict ended, Santa Fe was considered to be worthless as a war prize because she was non-standard, obsolete, badly damaged and too expensive to repair. As a result, the submarine was temporarily raised by the British, towed into deep water and scuttled on 10 February 1985.

She also wrote several stories for children. Early life Born at Boston, Lincolnshire, she was the daughter of William Ingelow, a banker. As a girl she contributed verses and tales to magazines under the pseudonym of Orris, but her first (anonymous) volume, A Rhyming Chronicle of Incidents and Feelings, which came from an established London publisher, did not appear until her 30th year. This was called charming by Tennyson, who declared he should like to know the author; they later became friends. Professional life Jean Ingelow followed this book of verse in 1851 with a story, Allerton and Dreux, but it was the publication of her Poems in 1863 which suddenly made her a popular writer. This ran rapidly through numerous editions and was set to music, proving very popular for English domestic entertainment. Her work often focused on religious introspection. In the United States, her poems obtained great public acclaim, and the collection was said to have sold 200,000 copies. In 1867 she edited, with Dora Greenwell, The Story of Doom and other Poems, a collection of poetry for children At that point Ingelow gave up verse for a while and became industrious as a novelist. Off the Skelligs appeared in 1872, Fated to be Free in 1873, Sarah de Berenger in 1880, and John Jerome in 1886. She also wrote Studies for Stories (1864), Stories told to a Child (1865), Mopsa the Fairy (1869), and other stories for children. Ingelow's children's stories were influenced by Lewis Carroll and George MacDonald.Mike Ashley, \\"Ingelow, Jean\\", in St. James Guide To Fantasy Writers, ed. David Pringle, St James Press, 1996, , pp. 299‚Äì300. Mopsa the Fairy, about a boy who discovers a nest of fairies and discovers a fairyland while riding on the back of an albatross) was one of her most popular works, reprinted in 1927 with illustrations by Dorothy P. Lathrop). Anne Thaxter Eaton, writing in A Critical History of Children's Literature, calls it \\"a well-constructed tale\\" with \\"charm and a kind of logical make-believe.\\" Her third series of Poems was published in 1885. Jean Ingelow's last years were spent in Kensington, by which time she had outlived her popularity as a poet. She died in 1897 and was buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. Criticism thumb Ingelow's poems, collected in one volume in 1898, were frequently popular successes. \\"Sailing beyond Seas\\" and \\"When Sparrows build in Supper at the Mill\\" were among the most popular songs of the day. Her best-known poems include \\"The High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire\\" and \\"Divided\\". Many, particularly her contemporaries, have defended her work. Gerald Massey described The High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire as \\"a poem full of power and tenderness\\" and Susan Coolidge remarked in a preface to an anthology of Ingelow's poems, \\"She stood amid the morning dew/And sang her earliest measure sweet/Sang as the lark sings, speeding fair/to touch and taste the purer air.\\"Preface to Poems by Jean Ingelow, Volume II, Roberts Bros 1896 Kindle ebook ASIN B0082C1UAI \\"Sailing beyond Seas\\" (or \\"The Dove on the Mast\\") was a favourite poem of Agatha Christie, who quotes it in two novels, The Moving Finger and Ordeal by Innocence. Yet the wider literary world largely dismissed her. The Cambridge History of English and American Literature, for example, wrote: \\"If we had nothing of Jean Ingelow‚Äôs but the most remarkable poem entitled Divided, it would be permissible to suppose the loss [of her], in fact or in might-have-been, of a poetess of almost the highest rank.... Jean Ingelow wrote some other good things, but nothing at all equalling this; while she also wrote too much and too long.\\" Some of this criticism has overtones of dismissing her as a female writer: \\"Unless a man is an extraordinary coxcomb, a person of private means, or both, he seldom has the time and opportunity of committing, or the wish to commit, bad or indifferent verse for a long series of years; but it is otherwise with woman.\\" There have many parodies of her poetry, noting her archaisms, flowery language and perceived sentimentality. These include \\"Lovers, and a Reflexion\\" by Charles Stuart Calverley and \\"Supper at the Kind Brown Mill\\", a parody of her \\"Supper at the Mill\\", which appears in Gilbert Sorrentino's satirical novel Blue Pastoral (1983). Works Mopsa the Fairy at A Celebration of Women Writers *The Prince's Dream *Gems From Jean Ingelow Legacy The High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire is referred to in a story of Rudyard Kipling's, My Son's Wife. A reading of the same poem forms a scene in chapter 7 of D. H. Lawrence's Sons and Lovers. There is an Ingelow Road named after Jean Ingelow in Battersea, London SW8.

On television, his eccentric style of presentation ‚Äì usually drinking wine as he cooked and talking to his crew ‚Äì endeared him to millions of viewers worldwide. Early life Floyd was born in Sulhamstead,Paul Levy, \\"Floyd, Keith (1943‚Äì2009)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Jan 2013 available online. Retrieved 5 September 2020. near Reading, Berkshire, on 28 December 1943 to working-class parents Sydney and Winnifred Floyd. He was brought up in a council house in the small town of Wiveliscombe in Somerset. His family made financial sacrifices to enable him to be educated privately at Wellington School, Somerset. Floyd became a cub reporter on the Bristol Evening Post. He, perhaps joking, claimed he decided to join the British Army in 1963 after watching the film Zulu, although the film was not released until 1964. He attained the rank of Second Lieutenant in the Royal Tank Regiment serving on Centurion tanks, where he pestered the mess cook to produce gourmet dinners. After three years, finding that he and the Army were \\"mutually incompatible\\", Floyd found employment in several catering-related jobs including barman, dishwasher and vegetable peeler. Career By 1971 Floyd had acquired three restaurants in Bristol: Floyd's Bistro in Princess Victoria Street in Clifton, Floyd's Restaurant in Alma Vale Road and Keith Floyd's Restaurant in Chandos Road, Redland. All three restaurants had financial problems. Floyd sold the restaurants and the rights to the name \\"Floyd's Restaurant\\" and moved to the south of France, where again he opened a restaurant in L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue in the Vaucluse. After this again ended in financial problems, he moved back to Britain. With the help of loans from friends, he opened another restaurant in Chandos Road. The restaurant in Chandos Road was frequented by actors and others connected with television. Floyd's first cookery book, Floyd's Food, published before he became a TV celebrity, had an introduction written by Leonard Rossiter, star of British TV sitcoms Rising Damp and The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin. Floyd's first foray into the world of show business was as a radio chef on Radio West, an independent commercial radio station in Bristol. TV producer David Pritchard then offered him a slot on BBC West regional magazine show RPM, presented by Andy Batten Foster. That led, in 1984, to his being offered his first BBC TV series Floyd on Fish, which started his rapid rise to national popularity. Floyd never described himself as a chef since he was untrained. He became well known for cooking with a glass of wine in one hand, often in unusual locations such as a fishing boat in rough seas. He was regarded as a pioneer of taking cooking programmes out of the studio. The chef went on to present his shows from around the world, cooking on location in his unique chaotic style. He bought and ran the Maltsters Arms in Tuckenhay, Devon in the late 1980s. When he was not running the kitchen, chefs included Jean Christophe Novelli. He was more often seen at the bar than in the kitchen. The failure of the Maltsters led to his bankruptcy. Despite TV success, Floyd continued to have financial problems and personal conflicts. He was declared bankrupt in 1996. The Daily Mirror claims that this happened after he personally guaranteed an order for ¬£36,000 of drinks. He lived in Kinsale, County Cork, Ireland for a time in the mid-1990s. In April 2008 he travelled to Singapore and Thailand in pursuit of new business ventures in Southeast Asia. Until his death he was actively involved in his restaurant Floyd's Brasserie, located at the Burasari Resort on the popular Thai island of Phuket. This was his first Asian restaurant and Phuket's first ever celebrity chef restaurant, drawing a large following of Floyd fans who remembered his many TV series and cookbooks. Floyd travelled widely to cook local dishes and entertain people around the world. His cooking shows were often marked by a tendency to consume wine during the preparation of the food. A documentary Keith Meets Keith, featuring actor and comedian Keith Allen interviewing Floyd, was broadcast on Channel 4 on 14 September 2009 and watched by nearly one million people. In the programme, Floyd was severely critical of modern television chefs for promoting themselves more than the food. Floyd admitted that away from the cameras, he often drank too much out of loneliness. It later emerged that Floyd had collapsed and died a few hours before the broadcast. Other television work He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1991 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel. Floyd can also be seen in a number of episodes of the children's television series Balamory, as a chef in Suzie Sweet's \\"Suzie's Cooking\\" song. In 2006, he also appeared on the ITV show Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway, demonstrating to the pair how to bake a cake for their Ant vs Dec challenge of cake decorating, resulting in Dec (Donnelly) winning the challenge. Honours Floyd had a bistro bar named after him in Thailand on the island of Koh Samui, Floyd's Beach Bistro Restaurant; Floyd visited it while filming the series Far Flung Floyd in Thailand and developed a close relationship with the family who owned the resort. Personal life All four of Floyd's marriages ended in divorce; he had a son and daughter. Floyd spent many years in France. In 1974 he moved to Vaucluse department, in the south-east of France, with Paddy Walker and her three young children. Together, they formed a company called Walker Floyd, buying wines in Vaucluse and then driving them back to Bristol to be sold to the city's bars and restaurants. They would then buy interesting, and carefully picked out, pieces of bric-a-brac to be driven back to Vaucluse for sale in the various markets. Paddy Walker and Floyd also ran a restaurant together in L'Isle-sur-la-sorgue in the Vaucluse. In his autobiography, Floyd notes Walker's influence on him, he says: \\"My approach to food, my style if you like, had developed as a result of my life in France with Paddy.\\"Floyd, Keith (2010) Stirred but not Shaken. p.113 - p.119 https://books.google.com/books/about/Stirred_But_Not_Shaken.html?id=UjADfmkWuXUC&redir;_esc=y In 1979, after five years together, Walker and Floyd's relationship broke down and they returned to Britain. In his last few years Floyd moved back to Avignon in the Vaucluse department. Floyd was a big fan of rock group the Stranglers: the tracks \\"Waltzinblack\\", an edited version of \\"Peaches\\", and an instrumental version of \\"Viva Vlad\\" were used as theme music for most of his TV programmes. Illness and death In October 2002 Floyd, a smoker and a heavy drinker, was reported to have suffered a mild stroke,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/celebrity-chef-keith- floyd-dies-aged-65-1787497.html although he denied this in his autobiography. In November 2004 he was banned from driving for 32 months and fined ¬£1,500 after crashing his car into another vehicle while three-and-a-half times over the legal alcohol limit. He suspected he had lung cancer or emphysema in early 2006, but was given the all-clear after a medical examination. In the summer of 2006 he was diagnosed as suffering from malnutrition. In August 2007 he was hospitalised in Thailand after collapsing in a restaurant. He collapsed at a pub in Chesterton, Staffordshire, on 29 January 2008 and was in a coma in hospital on a life-support machine. He was discharged on 22 February, travelling to his home in France to recuperate. He made a full recovery. On 14 September 2008, exactly a year before his death, he collapsed and was hospitalised for several days. Floyd died of a heart attack, aged 65, on 14 September 2009, at the Dorset County Hospital in Dorchester, Dorset,Paul Levy, \\"Floyd, Keith (1943‚Äì2009)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Jan 2013 available online.

Anthony Worral Thompson said of him: \\"I think all of us modern TV chefs owe a living to him. He kind of spawned us all.\\" Marco Pierre White said that Floyd \\"inspired a nation\\". White also said, \\"The thing which is very sad is a little piece of Britain today died which will never be replaced.

He was the elder son of Henry Somerset, 2nd Duke of Beaufort and his second wife, Rachel Noel. As his father's eldest son and heir to his father's title he was known as (styled) Marquess of Worcester, a courtesy title. On his father's death on 24 April 1714 he succeeded him and became 3rd Duke of Beaufort. At the age of 19 he commissioned the construction of what would later become known as the Badminton Chest or Badminton Cabinet, an ornate set of drawers made in Florence. The chest was sold in 2004 to Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein for ¬£19 million, making it the most expensive piece of furniture in the world.Guardian newspaper: Highest priced furniture sells for ¬£19m, 10 December 2004 It is on display in the Palais Liechtenstein in Vienna, Austria. On 28 June 1729 he married Frances Scudamore (14 August 1711 - 16 February 1750ThePeerage.com, \\"Frances Scudamore\\".), the only daughter and heir of James Scudamore, 3rd Viscount Scudamore, and took his wife's name by an Act of Parliament later the same year.Deed Poll Office: Private Act of Parliament 1729 (3 Geo. 2). c. 10 In 1742 he filed for divorce due to Frances' adulterous relationship with William Talbot, who later became Earl Talbot. Frances countersued, saying the Duke was impotent; in March 1743, he demonstrated before court-appointed examiners that he was physically able to have an erection. The divorce was granted, and he sued Talbot for damages.Stephanson, Raymond. The Yard of Wit: Male Creativity and Sexuality, 1650-1750.

Frances later remarried to Charles FitzRoy- Scudamore. The Duke was one of several founding governors of Britain's first institution for abandoned children, the Foundling Hospital, and his name is listed in its royal charter received from George II in October 1739. After his death, the 3rd Duke of Beaufort was buried at St Michael and All Angels Church, Badminton. Because he had no legitimate children, his titles and estates were inherited by his younger brother, Charles Noel Somerset. The Duke had one illegitimate daughter, Margaret Burr, who married the painter Thomas Gainsborough and had issue.

In German he mostly is called Graf (Count) Platen. Biography August von Platen was born on 24 October 1796 at Ansbach, the son of the Oberforstmeister (a senior public servant) of that state, Count Philipp August von Platen-Hallerm√ºnde, by second wife Baroness Christiane Eichler von Auriz. Shortly after his birth Ansbach and other Franconian principalities became incorporated with Bavaria. Platen entered the school of cadets (Kadettenhaus) in Munich, Bavaria, where he showed early poetic talent. In 1810 as an adolescent he passed into the royal school of pages (K√∂nigliche Pagerie). In 1814 Platen was appointed lieutenant in the regiment of Bavarian life-guards. With them he took part in the short campaign in France of 1815, being in bivouac for several months near Mannheim and in the department of the Yonne. He saw no fighting, however, and returned home with his regiment towards the close of the same year. Desiring to study, and finding garrison life distasteful, he obtained a long leave of absence, and after a tour in Switzerland and the Bavarian Alps, entered the University of W√ºrzburg in 1818 as a student of philosophy and philology. In the following year Platen migrated to the university of Erlangen, where he sat at the feet of Schelling, and became one of his most enthusiastic admirers. As a result of his Oriental studies Platen published a little volume of poemsGhaselen (1821), each consisting of ten to twenty verses, in which he imitates the style of R√ºckert; Lyrische Bl√§tter (1821); Spiegel des Hafis (1822); Vermischte Schriften (1822); and Neue Ghaselen (1823). These attracted the attention of eminent men of letters among them Goethe, both by reason of their contents, which breathe the spirit of the East, and also of the purity and elegance of their form and diction. Though Platen was at first influenced by the school of Romanticism, and particularly by Spanish models, the plays written during his university life at Erlangen, Der gl√§serne Pantoffel, Der Schatz des Rhampsinit, Berengar, Treue um Treue, Der Turm mit sieben Pforten, show a clearness of plot and expression foreign to the Romantic style. His antagonism to the literature of his day became more and more pronounced, and he vented his indignation at the lack of art shown by the later Romanticists, the inanity of the lyricists, and the bad taste of the so-called fate tragedies (Schicksalstrag√∂dien), in the witty Aristophanic comedies Die verh√§ngni√üvolle Gabel (1826) and Der romantische Oedipus (1828). The want of interest, amounting even to hostility, with which Platen's enthusiasm for the purity and dignity of poetry was received in many literary circles in Germany increased the poet's indignation and disgust. In 1826 he visited Italy, which he henceforth made his home, living at Florence, Rome and Naples. His means were slender, but, though frequently necessitous, he felt happy in the life he had chosen, that of a \\"wandering rhapsodist\\". Offended by Heinrich Heine‚Äôs mockery of \\"die Orientsucht\\"the obsession with the Orient in poetryin his work Reisebilder, zweiter Teil (1827), Platen expressed anti-Semitic sentiment directed at Heine in his work Der romantische Oedipus (1828). Heine reacted in turn by publicizing Platen‚Äôs homosexuality in Reisebilder dritter Teil (1830). This back and forth of mockery and ad hominem attacks are also referred to as \\"die von Platen Affaire\\".German Wikipedia: Platen-Aff√§re Illustration for Die Abbassiden. From Gesammelte Werke, dritter Band. 1853. In Naples, where Platen formed the friendship of August Kopisch, the poet and painter, were written his last drama Die Liga von Cambrai (1833) and the delightful epic fairy-tale Die Abbassiden (1830; 1834), besides numerous lyrical poems, odes and ballads. He also essayed historical work in a fragment, Geschichte des K√∂nigreichs Neapel von 1414 bis 1443 (1838), without, however, achieving any marked success. In 1832 his father died, and after an absence of eight years Platen returned to Germany for a while, and in the winter of 1832-1833 lived at Munich, where he revised the first complete edition of his poems, Gedichte (1833). In the summer of 1834 Platen returned to Italy, and, after living in Florence and Naples, proceeded in 1835 to Sicily. Dread of the cholera, which was at that time very prevalent, induced him to move from place to place, and in November of that year he was taken ill at Syracuse, where he died on 5 December 1835. He is buried in the non-Catholic cemetery of Syracuse. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, \\"Like Heine himself, Platen failed in the drama, but his odes and sonnets, to which must be added his Polenlieder (1831), in which he gives vent to his warm sympathy for the Poles in their rising against the rule of the Tsar, are in language and metre so artistically finished as to rank among the best classical poems of modern times\\". He gives his name to the Bavarian literary prize August-Graf-von-Platen-Preis.

She is the youngest ever Raja Permaisuri Agong (Queen) of Malaysia, ascending the throne at the age of 28 on 26 April 1999. During her reign as Raja Permaisuri Agong, she was known as Tuanku Siti Aishah. Early life  She grew up in Kuala Lumpur, received her early education at the Jalan Gurney Primary School and furthered her studies in banking at the Kelantan branch campus of the Universiti Teknologi MARA (Formerly known as Institut Teknologi Mara) in Kota Bharu, Kelantan. Marriage Having married Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah Al-Haj on 3 May 1990, she was made Che Puan Besar of Selangor. On 28 October 1998, she became Tengku Permaisuri of Selangor with style Duli Yang Maha Mulia Tengku Permaisuri Selangor, Tengku Permaisuri Siti Aishah. The second commoner to become Raja Permaisuri Agong, she is believed to have remarried since the death of her husband the late king on 21 November 2001 - a claim which she has since denied. Life after the death of Sultan Salahuddin She came back into the public eye on New Year's Day 2006 for an exclusive interview by The Star Malaysia, where the newspaper had wrongly addressed by her former title, \\"Tuanku Siti Aishah\\". The Selangor Council of the Royal Court immediately responded that the widowed consort of the late Sultan of Selangor should instead be properly addressed as Yang Amat Mulia (roughly equivalent to Her Exalted Highness) Permaisuri Siti Aishah. The honorific title Yang Amat Mulia was in recognition of the Darjah Kerabat Yang Amat Dihormati (DK, The Most Honourable Royal Family Order of Selangor), which was conferred on her by her late husband. In the interview, she talked about her life since the late king (whom she fondly referred to as Almarhum) died, how she coped with his death with her family's love and support, her nephews Abdul Aziz (whom the late king named after himself shortly before he died) and Abdul Azim as her solace, her role as the former queen of Malaysia, her relationship with the late king, and her hope to find love and remarry again, with her parents' blessings.

Life Somerset was the younger son of Henry Somerset, 2nd Duke of Beaufort and his second wife, Rachel Noel. He was educated at Winchester College and matriculated as University College, Oxford on 19 June 1725, being awarded MA on 16 October 1727. Somerset was a High Tory and 'a most determined and unwavering Jacobite.' He was returned as Member of Parliament for Monmouthshire his family's seat at a by election on 17 May 1731. At the 1734 British general election, he transferred to Monmouth. He adopted a traditional Tory line in Parliament, which included voting against the repeal of the Test Act in 1736; this demonstrates the complexity of the English Jacobite movement, which was staunchly anti-Catholic, yet in theory supported a Catholic monarchy. Somerset was returned again for Monmouth at the 1741 British general election. The era was dominated by the Whigs under the premiership of Robert Walpole with the Tories excluded from power. In February 1742, Walpole was finally ousted by a coalition of Tories, Patriot Whigs who opposed his foreign policy and members of the 'Prince's Party,' a group of younger politicians, most notably William Pitt who associated themselves with Frederick, Prince of Wales. However, to the fury of their Tory allies, the Patriot Whigs did a deal with their Whig colleagues to shut them out of the new government, while in 1744, the Tory leader the Earl of Gower joined the so-called Broad Bottom ministry and Somerset assumed leadership of the party. However, the government simply ignored him and continued to treat Gower as the Tory leader when negotiating the award of offices. Somerset became Duke of Beaufort on the death of his brother, Henry Scudamore, 3rd Duke of Beaufort in February 1745. He vacated his seat in the House of Commons and took his seat in the House of Lords. His brother had been one of those who contacted the French government in late 1742 asking their support for an invasion to restore the Stuarts. Beaufort himself also joined the project, sending assurances of support to the French in August 1745, and pressing a month later ‚Äòfor a body of troops to be landed near London.' Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, executed for his part in the 45 Rebellion later declared ‚Äòif the Duke of Beaufort had not promised to raise ¬£12,000, he would not have concerned himself‚Äô but as with many aristocratic Jacobite sympathisers, the Government took no action against Beaufort. One of the complexities of 18th century politics was the hostility between Hanoverian monarchs and their heirs; as George II supported the Whigs, his son Frederick, Prince of Wales described himself as a Tory even though many of them were in theory Jacobites. Since the Prince's 'programme' effectively amounted to ousting the current incumbents, Beaufort agreed to support him and in May 1749, Horace Walpole reported his presence at a meeting ‚Äòbetween the Prince's party and the Jacobites.' In September 1750, Beaufort and Lord Westmorland jointly presided at a meeting of English Jacobites held during Charles Stuart's secret visit to London in September 1750, which effectively signalled the last flicker of the Jacobite movement. Beaufort died on 28 October 1756 and was buried in the family vault at Badminton, Gloucestershire; a contemporary described him as 'a man of sense, spirit and activity, unblameable in his morals, but questionable in his political capacity.' His wife Elizabeth died on 9 April 1799. Family On 1 May 1740, he married Elizabeth Berkeley, sister of Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt. The couple had one son and five daughters: # Lady Anne Somerset (11 March 1741 ‚Äì 18 May 1763), married Charles Compton, 7th Earl of Northampton on 13 September 1759 and had issue # Lady Elizabeth Somerset (12 March 1742 ‚Äì 7 May 1760) # Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort (1744‚Äì1803), his heir and successor # Lady Rachel Somerset (August 1746 ‚Äì May 1747) # Lady Henrietta Somerset (26 April 1748 ‚Äì 24 July 1770), married Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 4th Baronet on 6 April 1769, without issue # Lady Mary Isabella Somerset (1 August 1756 ‚Äì 2 September 1831), married Charles Manners, 4th Duke of Rutland on 26 December 1775 and had issue References *Burkes' Peerage (1939 edition) Category:1709 births Category:1756 deaths Somerset, Charles Noel, Lord Somerset, Charles Noel, Lord 104 *12 Category:Masters of foxhounds Somerset, Charles Noel, Lord C ","title":"Charles Somerset, 4th Duke of Beaufort"},{"id":"560154","text":"Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner surface of the heart, usually the valves. Symptoms may include fever, small areas of bleeding into the skin, heart murmur, feeling tired, and low red blood cell count. Complications may include backward blood flow in the heart, the heart struggling to pump a sufficient amount of blood to meet the body's needs (heart failure), abnormal electrical conduction in the heart, stroke, and kidney failure. The cause is typically a bacterial infection and less commonly a fungal infection. Risk factors include valvular heart disease, including rheumatic disease, congenital heart disease, artificial valves, hemodialysis, intravenous drug use, and electronic pacemakers. The bacteria most commonly involved are streptococci or staphylococci. Diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and supported by blood cultures or ultrasound of the heart. There is also a noninfective form of endocarditis. The usefulness of antibiotics following dental procedures for prevention is unclear. Some recommend them for people at high risk. Treatment is generally with intravenous antibiotics. The choice of antibiotics is based on the results of blood cultures. Occasionally heart surgery is required. The number of people affected is about 5 per 100,000 per year. Rates, however, vary between regions of the world. Infective endocarditis occurs in males more often than in females. The risk of death among those infected is about 25%. Without treatment, it is almost universally fatal. Classification Infective endocarditis is divided into the three categories of acute, subacute, and chronic based on the duration of symptoms. Acute infective endocarditis refers to the presence of signs and symptoms of infective endocarditis that are present for days up to six weeks. If these signs and symptoms persist for more than six weeks but less than three months, this is subacute infective endocarditis. Chronic infective endocarditis refers to the presence of such signs and symptoms when they persist for more than three months. * Subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) is often due to streptococci of low virulence (mainly viridans streptococci) and mild to moderate illness which progresses slowly over weeks and months (>2 weeks) and has low propensity to hematogenously seed extracardiac sites. * Acute bacterial endocarditis (ABE) is a fulminant illness over days to weeks (<2 weeks), and is more likely due to Staphylococcus aureus, which has much greater virulence or disease-producing capacity and frequently causes metastatic infection. This classification is now discouraged, because the ascribed associations (in terms of organism and prognosis) were not strong enough to be relied upon clinically. The terms short incubation (meaning less than about six weeks) and long incubation (greater than about six weeks) are preferred.  Culture results  Infective endocarditis may also be classified as culture-positive or culture-negative. By far the most common cause of \\"culture-negative\\" endocarditis is prior administration of antibiotics. Sometimes microorganisms can take a longer period of time to grow in the culture media, such organisms are said to be fastidious because they have demanding growth requirements. Some examples include pathogens like Aspergillus species, Brucella species, Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydia species, and HACEK bacteria. Due to delay in growth and identification in these cases, patients may be erroneously classified as \\"culture-negative\\" endocarditis.  Heart side  Endocarditis can also be classified by the side of the heart affected: * People who intravenously inject opioids such as heroin or methamphetamine may introduce infection which can travel to the right side of the heart, classically affecting the tricuspid valve, and most often caused by S. aureus. * Regardless of cause, left-sided endocarditis is more common in both IV drug users and non-drug users than right-sided endocarditis.  Infection setting  Another form of endocarditis is healthcare-associated endocarditis when the infecting organism is believed to be transmitted in a health care setting like hospital, dialysis unit or a residential nursing home. Nosocomial endocarditis is a form of healthcare associated endocarditis in which the infective organism is acquired during a stay in a hospital and it is usually secondary to presence of intravenous catheters, total parenteral nutrition lines, pacemakers, etc.  Valve type  Finally, the distinction between native-valve endocarditis and prosthetic-valve endocarditis is clinically important. Prosthetic valve endocarditis can be early (< 60 days of valvular surgery), intermediate (60 days to 1 year) or late (> 1 year following valvular surgery). * Early prosthetic valve endocarditis is usually due to intraoperative contamination or a postoperative bacterial contamination which is usually nosocomial in nature. * Late prosthetic valve endocarditis is usually due to community acquired microorganisms. Prosthetic valve endocarditis is commonly caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis as it is capable of growing as a biofilm on plastic surfaces. Signs and symptoms * Fever occurs in 97% of people; malaise and endurance fatigue in 90% of people. * A new or changing heart murmur, weight loss, and coughing occurs in 35% of people. * Vascular phenomena: septic embolism (a piece of infected debris or tissue breaking off and traveling through the bloodstream to a distant site) (causing thromboembolic problems such as a stroke or gangrene of the fingers), Janeway lesions (painless hemorrhagic cutaneous lesions on the palms and soles), bleeding in the brain, conjunctival hemorrhage, splinter hemorrhages, kidney infarcts, and splenic infarcts. Infective endocarditis can also lead to the formation of mycotic aneurysms. * Immunologic phenomena: glomerulonephritis which allows for blood and albumin to enter the urine, Osler's nodes (\\"ephemeral spots of a painful nodular erythema, chiefly in the skin of the hands and feet\\"), Roth's spots on the retina, positive serum rheumatoid factor * Other signs may include night sweats, rigors, anemia, spleen enlargement Cause Many microorganisms can cause infective endocarditis. These are generally isolated by blood culture, where the patient's blood is drawn and any growth is noted and identified. The term bacterial endocarditis (BE) commonly is used, reflecting the fact that most cases of IE are due to bacteria; however, infective endocarditis (IE) has become the preferred term. Bacterial Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of infective endocarditis in most parts of the world and is responsible for about 31% of cases. Viridans streptococci and Enterococci are the second and third most common organisms responsible for infective endocarditis. Other Streptococci are also a frequent cause. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of endocarditis in people who use intravenous drugs. Viridans streptococci are a common cause of infective endocarditis in South America. Infective endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis occurs more commonly in Europe than in North America. HACEK group of bacteria are also rare causes of infective endocarditis in North America. The viridans group includes S. oralis, S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. gordonii and S. parasanguis. The primary habitats for these organisms are the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract. These bacteria are present in the normal oral flora and enter the bloodstream due to disruption of tissues in the mouth when dental surgical procedures are performed (tooth extractions) or genitourinary manipulation. Similarly, HACEK organisms are a group of bacteria that live on the dental gums, and can be seen with IV drug users who contaminate their needles with saliva. Patients may also have a history of poor dental hygiene, or pre- existing valvular disease. Viridans alpha-hemolytic streptococci, that are present in the mouth, are the most frequently isolated microorganisms when the infection is acquired in a community setting. In contrast, Staphylococcus blood stream infections are frequently acquired in a health care setting where they can enter the blood stream through procedures that cause break in the integrity of skin, such as surgery, catheterization, or during access of long term indwelling catheters or secondary to intravenous injection of recreational drugs. Enterococcus can enter the bloodstream as a consequence of abnormalities in the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts. Some organisms, when isolated, give valuable clues to the cause, as they tend to be specific. * Pseudomonas species, which are very resilient organisms that thrive in water, may contaminate street drugs that have been contaminated with drinking water. P. aeruginosa can infect a child through foot punctures, and can cause both endocarditis and septic arthritis. * S. bovis and Clostridium septicum, which are part of the natural flora of the bowel, are associated with colon cancers. When they present as the causative agent in endocarditis, it usually prompts a colonoscopy to be done immediately due to concerns regarding spread of bacteria from the colon through the bloodstream due to the cancer breaking down the barrier between the inside of the colon (lumen) and the blood vessels which drain the bowel. * Less commonly reported bacteria responsible for so called \\"culture negative endocarditis\\" include Bartonella, Chlamydia psittaci, and Coxiella. Such bacteria can be identified by serology, culture of the excised valve tissue, sputum, pleural fluid, and emboli, and by polymerase chain reaction or sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA. Multiple case reports of infective endocarditis caused by unusual organisms have been published. Cutibacterium sp., which are normal skin flora, have been responsible for infective endocarditis sometimes leading to deaths due to the indolent course of this abscess-producing infection.Tropheryma whipplei has caused endocarditis without gastrointestinal involvement. Citrobacter koseri was found in an immunocompetent adult. Neisseria bacilliformis was found in a person with a bicuspid aortic valve. Fungal Fungal endocarditis (FE) is an often fatal and one of the most serious forms of infective endocarditis. The types of fungi most seen associated with this disease are: Candida albicans is found as a spherical or oval budding yeast. It is associated with endocarditis in IV drug users, patients with prosthetic valves, and immunocompromised patients. It forms biofilms around thick-walled resting structures like prosthetic heart valves and additionally colonizes and penetrates endothelial walls. C. albicans is responsible for 24-46% of all the cases of FE, and its mortality rate is 46.6‚Äì50%. Other fungi demonstrated to cause endocarditis are Histoplasma capsulatum and Aspergillus. Aspergillus contributes to roughly 25% of FE cases. Endocarditis with Tricosporon asahii has also been reported in a case report. Risk factors Risk factors for infective endocarditis are based on the premise that in a healthy individual, bacteremia (bacteria entering the blood stream) is cleared quickly with no adverse consequences. However, if a heart valve is damaged, the bacteria can attach themselves to the valve, resulting in infective endocarditis. Additionally, in individuals with weakened immune systems, the concentration of bacteria in the blood can reach levels high enough to increase the probability that some will attach to the valve. Some significant risk factors are listed here: * Artificial heart valves * Intracardiac devices, such as implantable cardioverter-defibrillators * Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart defects * History of infective endocarditis * Neoplastic disease * Chronic rheumatic heart disease, which is an autoimmune response to repeated Streptococcus pyogenes infection (mostly in the developing world) * Age- related degenerative valvular lesions * Congenital heart valve abnormalities * Hemodialysis, a medical procedure that filters the blood of individuals with kidney failure * Poor oral hygiene * Coexisting conditions, especially ones that suppress immunity. Diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, chronic liver disease, HIV/AIDS, and intravenous drug use all fall in this category More detailed descriptions of these and other risk factors are provided below. Other conditions that result in large numbers of bacteria entering into the bloodstream include colorectal cancer (mostly Streptococcus bovis), serious urinary tract infections (mostly enterococci), and drug injection (Staphylococcus aureus). With a large number of bacteria, even a normal heart valve may become infected. A more virulent organism (such as Staphylococcus aureus) can cause infective endocarditis by infecting even a normal heart valve. Intravenous drug users tend to get their right-sided heart valves infected because the veins that are injected drain into the right side of the heart. In rheumatic heart disease, infection occurs on the aortic and the mitral valves on the left side of the heart. Other factors that increase the risk of developing infective endocarditis are low levels of white blood cells, immunodeficiency or immunosuppression, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol abuse. Dental operations In the past, one in eight cases of infective endocarditis were because of bacteremia caused by dental procedures (in most cases due to Streptococcus viridans, which reside in the oral cavity), such as a cleaning or extraction of a tooth; this was thought to be more clinically significant than it actually was. However, it is important that a dentist or a dental hygienist be told of any heart problems before commencing treatment. Antibiotics are administered to patients with certain heart conditions as a precaution, although this practice has changed in the US, with new American Heart Association guidelines released in 2007, and in the UK as of March 2008 due to new NICE guidelines. Everyday tooth brushing and flossing will similarly cause bacteremia, so a high standard of oral health should be adhered to at all times. Although there is little evidence to support antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment, the current American Heart Association guidelines are highly accepted by clinicians and patients. Pathogenesis Drawing of endocarditis. Damaged valves and endocardium contribute to the development of infective endocarditis. Specifically, the damaged part of a heart valve forms a local blood clot, a condition known as non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). The platelet and fibrin deposits that form as part of the blood clotting process allow bacteria to take hold and form vegetations. As previously mentioned, the body has no direct methods of combating valvular vegetations because the valves do not have a dedicated blood supply. This combination of damaged valves, bacterial growth, and lack of a strong immune response results in infective endocarditis. Damage to the valves and endocardium can be caused by: * Altered, turbulent blood flow. The areas that fibrose, clot, or roughen as a result of this altered flow are known as jet lesions. Altered blood flow is more likely in high pressure areas, so ventricular septal defects or patent ductus arteriosus can create more susceptibility than atrial septal defects. * Catheters, electrodes, and other intracardiac prosthetic devices. * Solid particles from repeated intravenous injections. * Chronic inflammation. Examples include auto-immune mechanisms and degenerative valvular lesions. The risk factors for infective endocarditis provide a more extensive list of conditions that can damage the heart. Diagnosis Vegetation on the tricuspid valve by echocardiography. Arrow denotes the vegetation. In general, the Duke criteria should be fulfilled in order to establish the diagnosis of endocarditis. Although the Duke criteria are widely used, they have significant limitations. For example, the sensitivity of the Duke criteria for detecting infective endocarditis decreases when prosthetic heart valves are present. As the Duke criteria rely heavily on the results of echocardiography, research has addressed when to order an echocardiogram by using signs and symptoms to predict occult endocarditis among patients with intravenous drug abuse and among non drug- abusing patients. However, this research is over twenty years old and it is possible that changes in the epidemiology of endocarditis and bacteria such as staphylococci make the following estimates incorrect. The blood tests C reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin have not been found to be particularly useful in helping make or rule out the diagnosis. Ultrasound Echocardiography is the main type of diagnostic imaging used to establish the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. There are two main types of echocardiography used to assist with the diagnosis of IE: transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The transthoracic echocardiogram has a sensitivity and specificity of approximately 65% and 95% if the echocardiographer believes there is 'probable' or 'almost certain' evidence of endocarditis. However, TTE only has a sensitivity of approximately 50% in people with prosthetic valve endocarditis whereas TEE has a sensitivity exceeding 90% in these individuals. The TEE also has an important diagnostic role when the TTE does not reveal evidence of IE but the diagnostic suspicion remains high since TEE is more sensitive for IE than TTE and is better able to characterize the local damage IE causes to the heart valves and surrounding tissues. Guidelines support the initial use of TTE over TEE as an imaging modality in people with positive blood cultures, a new heart murmur, and suspected infective endocarditis. TEE is the preferred initial form of imaging in people with suspected infective endocarditis who have a moderate to high pretest probability of infective endocarditis, including people with prosthetic heart valves, blood cultures growing Staphylococcus, or have an intracardiac device (such as a pacemaker).

According to the Duke criteria, diagnosis of infective endocarditis can be definite, possible, or rejected. A diagnosis of infective endocarditis is definite if either the following pathological or clinical criteria are met: One of these pathological criteria: * Histology or culture of a cardiac vegetation, an embolized vegetation, or intracardiac abscess from the heart finds microorganisms * Active endocarditis One of these combinations of clinical criteria * Two major clinical criteria * One major and three minor criteria * Five minor criteria Diagnosis of infective endocarditis is possible if one of the following combinations of clinical criteria are met: * One major and one minor criteria * Three minor criteria are fulfilled Major criteria Positive blood culture with typical IE microorganism, defined as one of the following: * Typical microorganism consistent with IE from two separate blood cultures, as noted below:  Viridans-group streptococci, or  Streptococcus bovis including nutritional variant strains, or  HACEK group, or  Staphylococcus aureus, or  Community-acquired enterococci, in the absence of a primary focus * Microorganisms consistent with IE from persistently positive blood cultures defined as:  Two positive cultures of blood samples drawn >12 hours apart, or  Three or a majority of ‚â•four separate blood cultures (with first and last sample drawn at least one hour apart)  Coxiella burnetii detected by at least one positive blood culture or IgG antibody titer for Q fever phase 1 antigen >1:800. This was previously a minor criterion Evidence of endocardial involvement with positive echocardiogram defined as * Oscillating intracardiac mass on valve or supporting structures, in the path of regurgitant jets, or on implanted material in the absence of an alternative anatomic explanation, or * Abscess, or * New partial dehiscence of prosthetic valve or new valvular regurgitation (worsening or changing of preexisting murmur not sufficient) Minor criteria * Predisposing factor: known cardiac lesion, recreational drug injection * Fever >38 ¬∞C * Vascular phenomena: arterial emboli, pulmonary infarcts, Janeway lesions, conjunctival hemorrhage * Immunological phenomena: glomerulonephritis, Osler's nodes, Roth's spots, Rheumatoid factor * Microbiologic evidence: Positive blood culture (that doesn't meet a major criterion) or serologic evidence of infection with organism consistent with IE but not satisfying major criterion Risk Among people who do not use intravenous drugs and have a fever in the emergency department, there is a less than 5% chance of occult endocarditis. Mellors in 1987 found no cases of endocarditis nor of staphylococcal bacteremia among 135 febrile patients in the emergency room. The upper confidence interval for 0% of 135 is 5%, so for statistical reasons alone, there is up to a 5% chance of endocarditis among these patients. In contrast, Leibovici found that among 113 non-selected adults admitted to the hospital because of fever there were two cases (1.8% with 95%CI: 0% to 7%) of endocarditis. Among people who do use intravenous drugs and have a fever in the emergency department, there is about a 10% to 15% prevalence of endocarditis. This estimate is not substantially changed by whether the doctor believes the patient has a trivial explanation for their fever. Weisse found that 13% of 121 patients had endocarditis. Marantz also found a prevalence of endocarditis of 13% among such patients in the emergency department with fever. Samet found a 6% incidence among 283 such patients, but after excluding patients with initially apparent major illness to explain the fever (including 11 cases of manifest endocarditis), there was a 7% prevalence of endocarditis. Among people with staphylococcal bacteremia (SAB), one study found a 29% prevalence of endocarditis in community-acquired SAB versus 5% in nosocomial SAB. However, only 2% of strains were resistant to methicillin and so these numbers may be low in areas of higher resistance. Prevention Not all people with heart disease require antibiotics to prevent infective endocarditis. Heart diseases have been classified into high, medium and low risk of developing IE. Those falling into high risk category require IE prophylaxis before endoscopies and urinary tract procedures. Diseases listed under high risk include: * Prior endocarditis * Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart diseases * Completely repaired congenital heart disease in their first 6 months * Prosthetic heart valves * Incompletely repaired congenital heart diseases * Cardiac transplant valvulopathy Following are the antibiotic regimens recommended by the American Heart Association for antibiotic prophylaxis: : Oral amoxicillin one hour before the procedure : Intravenous or intramuscular ampicillin one hour before the procedure :In patients allergic to penicillins :: Azithromycin or clarithromycin orally one hour before the procedure :: Cephalexin orally one hour before the procedure :: Clindamycin orally one hour before the procedure In the UK, NICE clinical guidelines no longer advise prophylaxis because there is no clinical evidence that it reduces the incidence of IE and there are negative effects (e.g. allergy and increased bacterial resistance) of taking antibiotics that may outweigh the benefits. Antibiotics were historically commonly recommended to prevent IE in those with heart problems undergoing dental procedures (known as dental antibiotic prophylaxis). There is, however, insufficient evidence to support whether antibiotics are effective or ineffective at preventing IE when given prior to a dental procedures in people at high risk. They are less commonly recommended for this procedure. In some countries e.g. the USA, high risk patients may be given prophylactic antibiotics such as penicillin or clindamycin for penicillin-allergic people prior to dental procedures. Prophylactics should be bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic. Such measures are not taken in certain countries e.g. Scotland due to the fear of antibiotic resistance. Because bacteria are the most common cause of infective endocarditis, antibiotics such as penicillin and amoxicillin (for beta lactamase-producing bacteria) are used in prophylaxis. Treatment High-dose antibiotics are the cornerstone of treatment for infective endocarditis. These antibiotics are administered by the intravenous (IV) route to maximize diffusion of antibiotic molecules into vegetation(s) from the blood filling the chambers of the heart. This is necessary because neither the heart valves nor the vegetations adhering to them are supplied by blood vessels. Antibiotics are typically continued for two to six weeks depending on the characteristics of the infection and the causative microorganisms. Antibiotic treatment lowers the risk of embolic complications in people with infective endocarditis. In acute endocarditis, due to the fulminant inflammation, empirical antibiotic therapy is started immediately after the blood has been drawn for culture to clarify the bacterial organisms responsible for the infection. This usually includes vancomycin and ceftriaxone IV infusions until the infecting organism is identified and the susceptibility report with the minimum inhibitory concentration becomes available. Once this information is available, this allows the supervising healthcare professional to modify the antimicrobial therapy to target the specific infecting microorganism. The routine use of gentamicin to treat endocarditis has fallen out of favor due to the lack of evidence to support its use (except in infections caused by Enterococcus and nutritionally variant streptococci) and the high rate of complications. In cases of subacute endocarditis, where the person's hemodynamic status is usually stable, antibiotic treatment can be delayed until the causative microorganism can be identified. Viridans group streptococci and Streptococcus bovis are usually highly susceptible to penicillin and can be treated with penicillin or ceftriaxone. Relatively resistant strains of viridans group streptococci and Streptococcus bovis are treated with penicillin or ceftriaxone along with a shorter two-week course of an aminoglycoside during the initial phase of treatment. Highly penicillin- resistant strains of viridans group streptococci, nutritionally variant streptococci like Granulicatella sp., Gemella sp., Abiotrophia defectiva, and Enterococci are usually treated with a combination therapy consisting of penicillin and an aminoglycoside for the entire duration of 4‚Äì6 weeks. Some people may be treated with a relatively shorter course of treatment (two weeks) with benzyl penicillin IV if infection is caused by viridans group streptococci or Streptococcus bovis as long as the following conditions are met: * Endocarditis of a native valve, not of a prosthetic valve * A MIC ‚â§ 0.12 mg/l * A complication such as heart failure, arrhythmia, or pulmonary embolism occurs * No evidence of extracardiac complication like septic thromboembolism * No vegetations > 5 mm in diameter conduction defects * Rapid clinical response and clearance of blood stream infection Additionally, oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus native valve endocarditis of the right side can also be treated with a short 2-week course of a beta-lactam antibiotic such as nafcillin with or without aminoglycosides. Surgical debridement of infected material and replacement of the valve with a mechanical or bioprosthetic artificial heart valve is necessary in certain situations: * Patients with significant valve stenosis or regurgitation causing heart failure * Evidence of hemodynamic compromise in the form of elevated end-diastolic left ventricular or left atrial pressure or moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension * Presence of intracardiac complications like paravalvular abscess, conduction defects or destructive penetrating lesions * Recurrent septic emboli despite appropriate antibiotic treatment * Large vegetations (> 10 mm) * Persistently positive blood cultures despite appropriate antibiotic treatment * Prosthetic valve dehiscence * Relapsing infection in the presence of a prosthetic valve * Abscess formation * Early closure of mitral valve * Infection caused by fungi or resistant Gram negative bacteria. The guidelines were recently updated by both the American College of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology. There was a recent meta- analysis published that showed surgical intervention at seven days or less is associated with lower mortality. Prognosis Infective endocarditis is associated with 18% in-hospital mortality. As many as 50% of people with infective endocarditis may experience embolic complications. Epidemiology In developed countries, the annual incidence of infective endocarditis is 3 to 9 cases per 100,000 persons. Infective endocarditis occurs more often in men than in women. There is an increased incidence of infective endocarditis in persons 65 years of age and older, which is probably because people in this age group have a larger number of risk factors for infective endocarditis. In recent years, over one-third of infective endocarditis cases in the United States were healthcare-associated. Another trend observed in developed countries is that chronic rheumatic heart disease accounts for less than 10% of cases. Although a history of valve disease has a significant association with infective endocarditis, 50% of all cases develop in people with no known history of valvular disease. History Lazare Rivi√©re first described infective endocarditis affecting the aortic valve in 1616. In 1806, Jean- Nicolas Corvisart coined the term vegetation to describe collections of debris found on a mitral valve affected by infective endocarditis. The British physician Joseph Hodgson was the first to describe the embolic complications of infective endocarditis in 1815. It was not until 1878 that Theodor Klebs first suggested that infective endocarditis had a microbial infectious origin. In 1909, William Osler noted that heart valves that experienced degeneration and were sclerotic or poorly functioning had a higher risk of being affected. Later, in 1924, Emanuel Libman and Benjamin Sacks described cases of vegetative endocarditis that lacked a clear microbial origin and were often associated with the autoimmune condition systemic lupus erythematosus. In 1944, physicians reported on the first successful use of penicillin to treat a case of infective endocarditis.

The doosra spins in the opposite direction to an off break (the off-spinner's default delivery), and aims to confuse the batsman into playing a poor shot. Doosra means ‚Äô(the) second (one)‚Äô, or ‚Äô(the) other (one)‚Äô in Hindustani. The delivery was invented by Pakistani cricketer Saqlain Mushtaq. A variety of bowlers have made considerable use of the doosra in international cricket. Users include Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan, Indian Harbhajan Singh, and South African Johan Botha. Other Pakistanis who use it include Shoaib Malik and Saeed Ajmal. Most bowlers, such as Johan Botha and Shane Shillingford, are not allowed to bowl doosras because, when they do so, their bowling actions are illegal.  History  The doosra is a relatively new type of delivery. The naming of the delivery is attributed to Moin Khan, the former Pakistani wicketkeeper, who would call on Saqlain Mushtaq to bowl the \\"doosra\\" (the other one) from behind the stumps. Tony Greig, a commentator in one of these matches, eventually linked the word to the delivery and confirmed it with Saqlain in a post-match interview.Moin Khan coined the term Thus the term became a part of cricketing culture. The doosra is now an important part of the off-spin armoury.  Technique  The bowler delivers the ball with the same wrist action by locking the wrist and using the index and ring fingers instead of the usual index and middle fingers. This gives the ball spin in the opposite direction to that for an off break, causing it to spin from the leg side to the off side to a right-handed batsman. To make doosra more effective it should be pitched on the middle and off stump line because the ball will move away from the batsman after pitching, if a right-hander is facing the ball. However, If there is a little extra turn in the wicket then a bowler might have to adjust his line to middle and leg stump. An adept doosra bowler often gives a flight to his ball inviting a batsman to step out the crease, whereas the latter thinks that it is a tradition off-spin ball and he leaves the safety of the crease and loses his wicket to stumping or just manages to edge it to a fielder within the 30-yard circle. The doosra is the off- spinner's equivalent of the leg-spinner's googly, which spins in the opposite direction to the leg spinner's stock ball. It is possible for a left-armer (whose action mirrors that of an off-spinner) to bowl the doosra, which in this case would turn from off to leg. Sri Lankan left-armer Rangana Herath gained recognition by bowling the delivery, in particular against the Australians during an A tour.Rangana Herath. Cricinfo.com. Retrieved on 2008-04-06. England left-armer Monty Panesar has said he has bowled the delivery occasionally in domestic matches.Times Online: The Big Interview: Monty Panesar In the test series against Sri Lanka in 2014, the English spin bowler Moeen Ali bowled a doosra making him the first English spinner to do so in an international match.  Other bowlers  Increasingly, it seems that many other off-spinners are trying to make use of the \\"doosra\\" delivery with varying degrees of success. While Saqlain never had legitimacy issues regarding his action, other off-spinners attempting to utilize the delivery have had accusations (for the most part dismissed) of chucking (throwing) levelled against them. These include; Sohag Gazi, Muttiah Muralitharan, Harbhajan Singh, Shoaib Malik, Saeed Ajmal and Johan Botha. The South Australian Dan Cullen has also been rumoured to be able to bowl the doosra.  Muttiah Muralitharan  Muralitharan's doosra was the subject of an official report by match referee Chris Broad during Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in 2004, for illegal bending of the arm at the elbow during the bowling action. Subsequent biomechanical tests conducted at the University of Western Australia in Perth showed that Muralitharan was straightening his arm by angles of up to 10 degrees prior to delivering doosras, well outside the International Cricket Council (ICC) acceptable guideline of 5 degrees for spin bowlers. (Straightening the bent arm at the moment of delivery imparts added ball speed due to the action of the triceps muscle: this is one of the ways baseball pitchers generate ball velocity.) Muralitharan was subsequently instructed by Sri Lanka Cricket not to bowl the doosra in international cricket. In November 2004, the International Cricket Council conducted more research into illegal bowling actions and found that many great bowlers like Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Shaun Pollock, whose actions were considered legitimate were actually transgressing the rules. A rule change was proposed and accepted at a meeting of ICC chief executives in early 2005, stating that any bowler may straighten the arm up to 15¬∞ (which was earlier 9¬∞ for spinners and 12¬∞ for seamers) and Muralitharan's doosra once again became a legal delivery. In February 2006, in an attempt to silence the Australian crowds and their 'no ball' chants, Muralitharan took another test at the University of Western Australia, which saw all of his deliveries deemed legal, including the doosra.  Harbhajan Singh  The doosra of Indian bowler Harbhajan Singh was the subject of an official report by match referee Chris Broad, on-field umpires Aleem Dar and Mark Benson, and TV umpire Mahbubur Rahman after the second Test between India and Bangladesh at Chittagong in December 2004. It was reported that his arm is straightened by angles of up to 10 degrees, 15 degrees within the ICC tolerance levels.cricinfo: Harbhajan cleared to bowl  Shoaib Malik  Pakistani all-rounder Shoaib Malik was also reported for his doosra before the first Test between Australia and Pakistan in December 2004. Biomechanics tests, similar to those performed on Muralitharan, were conducted, and he did not bowl in subsequent Tests in that series. Unlike many other cricketers accused of throwing when bowling their doosra delivery, Malik is also a capable batsman, and some analysts speculate that he might focus on his batting if prevented from bowling this delivery. Malik was omitted from the Pakistani team for the first Test against Australia in 2004, although this was due to the reputation of the Perth pitch as being unfriendly to spin bowlers rather than as a result of the controversy. Malik returned to bowling in May 2005 following remedial work. He was reported again, alongside Shabbir Ahmed, after the first Test against England at Multan in November 2005. In May 2006, Malik opted for elbow surgery to correct his bowling action. He and the Pakistan Cricket Board had previously unsuccessfully argued that a 2003 road accident caused the damage to his elbow which makes his action appear suspect. Malik returned to play in June 2006 but does not bowl the doosra any more.cricinfo: Shoaib Malik  Johan Botha  South African Johan Botha has been reported for his version of the doosra after the 3rd Test match against Australia in January 2006. Botha was playing in his maiden test match at the time, taking 2 wickets. His bowling was later ruled illegal, and he was banned, though this ban was lifted in November 2006.cricinfo: Botha's action passed by the ICC However, in April 2009, he was called for a re-assessment of his bowling action after the series in Australia.Botha reported for suspected action In May 2009, he was allowed to bowl all types of deliveries except the doosra, which was deemed to exceed the 15-degree limit.  Saeed Ajmal  A Pakistani cricketer, Saeed Ajmal is an off-spin bowler who used the doosra as a mystery delivery by disguising it well. His technique was noted for causing more spin than speed, to his personal preference. In April 2009, Ajmal was reported by umpires for having a suspect bowling action.Ajmal action gets ICC's green signal An independent test the following month, reaffirmed later by a subsequent thorough investigation by journalist George Dobell with extensive discussion with the ICC conducted and released in 2012, made clear that Ajmal's bowling action falls well within the legal bounds set by the ICC for bowlers.Saeed Ajmal claims clarified by Pakistan Cricket Board Ajmal also had a mystery delivery called teesra which he used against England's Stuart Broad in test series at UAE in 2011‚Äì12. However, he was banned in September 2014 after his action was deemed illegal for all deliveries by the ICC as part of the clampdown on illegal actions. Although initially he hoped to make the 2015 Cricket World Cup he subsequently ruled himself out in December 2014 after deciding not to get his action retested by the ICChttps://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/27/pakistan-spinner-saeed-ajmal- remedial-work and although his ban was lifted in February 2015http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/saeed-ajmal-a-chance-for-world-cup- after-bowling-ban-lifted-20150207-138prj.html did not feature in the showpiece event.  Shohag Gazi  The doosra of Bangladeshi bowler Shohag Gazi was very difficult for Indian batsmen to read and play in his first match against India. After that series Shohag Gazi was accused by ICC for illegal bowling action for mysterious reason. After changing his action under ICC's rules he became an ineffective bowler and subsequently dropped from national team.  Ban against the teaching of the doosra in Australia  In July 2009 in Australia, a spin summit held at Cricket Australia's Centre for Excellence decided not to teach the doosra to young spinners. The delegates at the meeting included former Test spinners Shane Warne, Stuart MacGill, Jim Higgs, Gavin Robertson, Terry Jenner, Peter Philpott and Ashley Mallett.

The main compounds responsible for its psychedelic effects are psilocybin and psilocin. It belongs to the family Hymenogastraceae. A formal description of the species was published by Elsie Wakefield in 1946 in the Transactions of the British Mycological Society, based on a specimen she had recently collected at Kew Gardens. She had begun collecting the species as early as 1910. The mushroom is not generally regarded as being physically dangerous to adults. Since all the psychoactive compounds in P. cyanescens are water-soluble, the fruiting bodies can be rendered non-psychoactive through parboiling, allowing their culinary use. However, since most people find them overly bitter and they are too small to have great nutritive value, this is not frequently done. Psilocybe cyanescens can sometimes fruit in colossal quantity; more than 100,000 mushrooms were found growing in a single patch at a racetrack in England. Description Appearance Psilocybe cyanescens has a hygrophanous pileus (cap) that is caramel to chestnut-brown when moist, fading to pale buff or slightly yellowish when dried. Caps generally measure from 1.5‚Äì5 cm (¬Ω\\" to 2\\") across, and are normally distinctly wavy in maturity. The color of the pileus is rarely seen in mushrooms outside of the P. cyanescens species complex. Most parts of the mushroom, including the cap and Lamellae (gills, underneath the cap) can stain blue when touched or otherwise disturbed, probably due to the oxidation of psilocin. The lamellae are adnate, and light brown to dark purple brown in maturity, with lighter gill edges. There is no distinct annulus, but immature P. cyanescens specimens do have a cobwebby veil which may leave an annular zone in maturity. Both the odor and taste are farinaceous. P. cyanescens has smooth, elliptical spores which measure 9 - 12 x 5 - 8 ¬µm. According to some authors, the holotype collection of the species from Kew Gardens featured no pleurocystidia, but North American collections are characterized by common clavate-mucronate pleurocystidia. However, pleurocystidia are present in the holotype collection (but not easily to observe since hymenium is collapsed). In European collections of P. cyanescens, pleurocystidia are common and their shape is identical to those known from the United States. In 2012, an epitype from Hamburg, Germany was designated. Fresh sporocarps and mycelia of P. cyanescens generally bruise blueish or blue-green where damaged, and the staining remains visible after drying. This staining is most noticeable on the stem (which is white when undisturbed) but can also occur on other parts of the mushroom, including the gills, cap, and mycelium. This staining is due primarily to the oxidation of psilocin. (Psilocybin cannot be oxidized directly, but is quickly converted via enzymatic action to psilocin at injury sites which can then be oxidized, so even specimens with little psilocin still generally blue.) Psilocybe cyanescens in situ Related species Other related species may include P. weraroa, and these relatives are collectively referred to as the \\"Psilocybe cyanescens complex\\" or as the \\"caramel-capped psilocybe complex,\\" due to their extremely similar appearance and habit. There is phylogenetic evidence that there are two distinct clades in the complex, one consisting of P. cyanescens and P. azurescens and allies, and the other consisting of P. serbica and allies (European taxa).> It has also been shown that Psilocybe weraroa (previously known as Weraroa novae-zelandiae) is very closely related to P. cyanescens despite its vastly dissimilar appearance. A very close relative of P. cyanescens is Psilocybe allenii (described in 2012), formerly known as Psilocybe cyanofriscosa, a mushroom found in California and Washington It can be distinguished by macromorphological features and/or sequencing of rDNA ITS molecular marker. It is often difficult or impossible to distinguish between members of the P. cyanescens complex except by range without resorting to microscopic or molecular characters. Although not closely related, Psilocybe cyanescens has been at least occasionally confused with Galerina marginata with fatal results. The two mushrooms have generally similar habits and appearances, and bear a superficial resemblance to each other such that inexperienced mushroom-seekers may confuse the two. The two species can grow side-by-side, which may add to the chance of confusion. Habitat and distribution Psilocybe cyanescens grows today primarily on wood chips, especially in and along the perimeter of mulched plant beds in urban areas, but can also grow on other lignin-rich substrates. P. cyanescens does not grow on substrate that is not lignin-rich. Fruitings have been reported in natural settings previously (although most appear to be migrations from mulched plant beds.) The species does not typically grow on mulch that is made from bark. In the United States, P. cyanescens occurs mainly in the Pacific Northwest, south to the San Francisco Bay Area. It can also be found in areas such as Western Europe, Central Europe, New Zealand and parts of west Asia (Iran). The range in which P. cyanescens occurs is rapidly expanding, especially in areas where it is not native as the use of mulch to control weeds has been popularized. This rapid expansion of range may be due in part to the simple expedient of P. cyanescens mycelium having colonized the distribution network of woodchip suppliers and thus being distributed on a large scale with commercial mulch. It has been documented to fruit in Spring on the East Coast of the United States. Although it has been speculated that P. cyanescens' native habitat is the coniferous woodlands of the north-western United States or coastal dunes in the PNW, the type specimen was described from mulch beds in Kew Gardens, and there is no widely accepted explanation of P. cyanescens original habitat. Fruiting is dependent on a drop in temperature. In the San Francisco Bay Area, this means that fruiting typically occurs between late October and February, and fruiting in other areas generally occurs in fall, when temperatures are between 10-18 ¬∞C (50-65 ¬∞F). Psilocybe cyanescens often fruits gregariously or in cespitose clusters, sometimes in great numbers. 100,000 P. cyanescens fruits were once found growing on a racetrack in the south of England. Solitary fruits are sometimes also found. Indole content The fruits of P. cyanescens have been shown to contain many different indole alkaloids including psilocybin, psilocin, and baeocystin. It has also been shown that P. cyanescens mycelium will contain detectable levels of psilocin and psilocybin, but only after the formation of primordia. Indole content has been shown to be higher in North American specimens of P. cyanescens than in European ones. This was, however, caused by the fact that Gartz did not analyze the genuine P. cyanescens but P. serbica. North American fruiting bodies of P. cyanescens have been shown to contain between 0.66% and 1.96% total indole content by dry weight. European fruiting bodies have been shown to have between 0.39% and 0.75% total indole content by dry weight. North American specimens of P. cyanescens are among the most potent of psychedelic mushrooms. Its potency means that it is widely sought after by users of recreational drugs in those areas where it grows naturally. Cultivation Psilocybe cyanescens, like many other psilocybin containing mushrooms, is sometimes cultivated. Due to the fruiting requirements of the species, it is challenging but possible to get P. cyanescens to produce fruits indoors. Outdoor cultivation in an appropriate climate is relatively easy. Yield per pound of substrate is low when compared to other psilocybin containing mushrooms for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. The combination of poor yield and difficulty may explain why P. cyanescens is grown less frequently than some other psilocybin containing mushrooms. Psilocybe cyanescens mycelium is much easier to grow than actual fruits are, can be grown indoors, and is robust enough that it can be transplanted in order to start new patches. Mycelium can also be propagated via stem butt transplantation. Many of the cultivation techniques used with other members of the genus Psilocybe can be used to grow P. cyanescens as well. Cultivated P. cyanescens contain approximately the same concentration of psilocin and psilocybin as natural examples do. Psilocybe cyanescens spores Legal status Psilocybe cyanescens specimens do not fall under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances because the convention does not cover naturally occurring plants that incidentally contain a scheduled drug. However, many countries choose to prohibit possession of psilocybin containing mushrooms, including P. cyanescens, under their domestic laws. Countries that have banned or severely regulated the possession of P. cyanescens include the United States, Germany, New Zealand, and many others. Although this is difficult to enforce since no species of Psilocybe mushroom has spores containing psilocybin or psilocin. Because of this, Psilocybe cyanescens spores are not illegal to possess in many US states. (It is illegal to possess spores in Georgia and Idaho, and illegal to possess them with the intent to produce mushrooms in California.) http://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_law8.shtml Gallery File:Psilocybe_cyanescens_Alan.jpg File:2012-12-05 Psilocybe cyanescens Wakef 290259.jpg File:Psilocybe cyanescens Blauender Kahlkopf 01.jpg File:2012-12-05 Psilocybe cyanescens Wakef 290269.jpg File:Psilocybe.cyanescens.1000x.dic.JPG References External links * Psilocybe cyanescens at MykoWeb Category:Entheogens Category:Psychoactive fungi cyanescens Category:Psychedelic tryptamine carriers Category:Fungi of Europe Category:Fungi of North America ","title":"Psilocybe cyanescens"},{"id":"560168","text":"Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm Freiherr von L√ºtzow (18 May 17826 December 1834) was a Prussian lieutenant general notable for his organization and command of the L√ºtzow Freikorps of volunteers during the Napoleonic Wars. Early life L√ºtzowhaus in Sch√∂neiche L√ºtzow was born in Berlin on 18 May 1782. He came from the House of Mecklenburg; his father was a Prussian Major General, Johann Adolph von L√ºtzow (1748‚Äì1819), and his mother was named Wilhelmine (n√©e von Zastrow) (1754 to 1815). L√ºtzow first entered the Prussian Army in 1795, and eleven years later as a lieutenant took part in the disastrous battle of Auerstadt. He then achieved distinction in the siege of Kolberg, as the leader of a squadron of Schill's volunteers. In 1808, as a major L√ºtzow retired from the Prussian army, indignant at the humiliating treaty of Tilsit. He took part in the heroic venture of his old chief Schill in 1809; wounded at Dodendorf and left behind, he thereby escaped the fate of his comrades, many of whom were either killed at the Battle of Stralsund (1809) or were among the 12 officers executed at Napoleon's command in the aftermath. In Sch√∂neiche he was hidden by the owner of the village in a little hunters' hut at the village border and there L√ºtzow was able to recover from his wounds. Today the newer building made of stone is called \\"L√ºtzow Haus\\" (\\"L√ºtzow House\\") in commemoration of this episode. L√ºtzow Free Corps In 1811, L√ºtzow was recommissioned into the Prussian army as major, and at the outbreak of the German War of Liberation received permission from Scharnhorst to organize a free corps consisting of infantry, cavalry and Tirolese riflemen, for attacking flanks or in guerilla fighting in the French rear and rallying the smaller governments into the ranks of the allies. From their uniform, they were known as the \\"Black Troopers\\" or \\"Black Riflemen\\". The valor of the Black Troop is commemorated in Theodor K√∂rner's poem L√ºtzows wilde, verwegene Jagd (\\"L√ºtzow's wild, daring hunt\\"). cites 2d ed., Halle 1841. As L√ºtzow's adjutant, he met his death at the Battle of Gadebusch. Among other notable members of the corps were Friedrich Fr√∂bel and Friedrich Ludwig Jahn. This incident was portrayed in the 1927 film L√ºtzow's Wild Hunt directed by Richard Oswald. This corps played a marked part in the campaign of 1813. But L√ºtzow was unable to coerce the minor states, and the wanderings of the corps had little military influence. At Kitzen (near Leipzig) the whole corps, warned too late of the armistice of Poischwitz, was caught on the French side of the line of demarcation, and, as a fighting force, annihilated. L√ºtzow himself, wounded, cut his way out with the survivors, and immediately began reorganizing and recruiting. In the second part of the campaign the corps L√ºtzow served in more regular warfare under Wallmoden. L√ºtzow and his men distinguished themselves at Gadebusch (where K√∂rner fell) and G√∂hrde (where L√ºtzow himself, for the second time, received a severe wound at the head of the cavalry). Sent next against Denmark, and later employed at the siege of J√ºlich, L√ºtzow in 1814 fell into the hands of the French. Late career His grave in the old garrison cemetery in Berlin After the peace of 1814 the corps was dissolved, the infantry becoming the 25th Regiment, the cavalry the 6th Uhlans. At Ligny L√ºtzow led the 6th Uhlans to the charge, but they were broken by the French cavalry, and he finally remained in the hands of the enemy, escaping the next day during the French defeat at the Waterloo. Made colonel in that year, his subsequent promotions were: major-general 1822, and lieutenant-general (on retirement) 1830. L√ºtzow died on 6 December 1834. One of the last acts of his life for which L√ºtzow is remembered is his challenge (which was ignored) to Bl√ºcher (died in 1819), who had been ridden down in the rout of the 6th Ulans at the Battle of Ligny, and had made, in his official report, comments thereon, which their colonel considered disparaging. Legacy Several German warships including SMS L√ºtzow of World War I, and the heavy cruiser L√ºtzow (ex-Deutschland) of World War II, were named after him. The 37th SS Volunteer Cavalry Division L√ºtzow was also named after him. Democratic Germany's national colours Black Red Gold originate from the iconic L√ºtzower's black uniforms, which showed red insignia and golden buttons.

Schill's rebellion ended at the Battle of Stralsund, a battle which also saw Schill's own death in action. Outnumbered 3 to 1, Schill's Prussian forces succumbed to a Napoleonic force supported by Dutch and Danish auxiliaries. Life Schill was born at Wilmsdorf (now a part of Bannewitz, Saxony) and entered the Prussian Army's cavalry at the age of twelve or fourteen (sources differ).Sam Mustafa, The Long Ride of Major von Schill (Boulder: Rowman & Littlefield, 2008), pgs. 109, 124‚Äì136, 132 His father, Johann-Georg Schill, had been an ambitious commoner from Bohemia, who attained the aristocratic \\"von\\" for his services to Austria and Saxony during the Seven Years' War. J.-G. von Schill had raised a \\"Freikorps\\", a small raiding party of cavalry and mounted infantry, operating behind enemy lines, and acquired some measure of fame and success. Many of Ferdinand von Schill's later biographers assumed that his father's example was an important influence on his subsequent career. Ferdinand von Schill was a second-lieutenant of dragoons when he was wounded at the battle of Auerstadt. From that field he escaped to Kolberg, where he played a very prominent part in the celebrated siege of 1806‚Äì07, as the commander of a Freikorps, raiding behind the French lines. After the Treaty of Tilsit, he was promoted to major, awarded the Pour le M√©rite,Clark, Christopher M. (2006). Iron kingdom: the rise and downfall of Prussia, 1600‚Äì1947. Harvard University Press. . p.347 and given the command of a hussar regiment formed primarily from his Kolberg men. Schill's revolution In 1809 the political situation in Europe appeared to Schill to favor an attempt to liberate Germany from the French domination of Napoleon Bonaparte. He was an active member of the Tugendbund, the quasi-Masonic \\"League of Virtue\\" founded in June 1808, and including many notable Prussian reformers such as Gerhard von Scharnhorst and August Neidhardt von Gneisenau. It was banned in 1809. Many Tugendbund leaders believed that the new Kingdom of Westphalia, created by Napoleon from many smaller German states, and ruled by Napoleon's youngest brother J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, was ripe for revolution. Schill planned to create an uprising in Westphalia that would topple the Bonaparte regime there, and ‚Äì coupled with the efforts of Austria, Spain, and Britain ‚Äì would bring about the fall of Napoleonic dominance in Germany. Leading out his regiment from Berlin under pretext of manoeuvres, he raised the standard of revolt, and, joined by many officers and a company of light infantry, marched first south through Saxony, and then north-west into Westphalia. At the village of Dodendorf on May 5, 1809, he had a brush with the Magdeburg garrison and won a small victory. Schill had no difficulty defeating, or even recruiting, the unreliable Westphalian troops sent against him, and his rebellion swelled to over 2,000 men. He had less success, however, with the gathering Danish and Dutch forces, which gradually drove him in a north-east direction toward the Baltic Sea. His most serious difficulty was the condemnation of Prussia's king Frederick William III, who feared that the revolt would drag a weakened and unprepared Prussia into another disastrous war against Napoleon. By the end of May, although he had left garrisons and raiding parties in various places, Schill's main force was trapped at Stralsund. He had between 1,500‚Äì2,000 men, against a force of 8,000 Danish and Dutch troops under French command. Deutsches Historisches Museum Berlin Ferdinand von Schill ‚Äì Monument in Stralsund Liberation fails On May 31 the Napoleonic forces stormed Stralsund. Schill was killed in the street fighting as his defenses collapsed. Over a thousand of his rebels escaped to Prussia, overland or by ship, where the officers were tried by court-martial, cashiered and imprisoned (although all were subsequently pardoned.) Some smaller parties of rebels including his two brothers escaped to Sweden, and ultimately Austria and Britain, but the rest were either killed or taken. The French commander counted 570 prisoners, the majority of whom were then sent to the galleys. About 100 rebels who had been Westphalian deserters were separated and taken to Brunswick, where 14 of them were ultimately executed. Schill's body was decapitated. The corpse was dumped in an unmarked grave in Stralsund. The head was sent to Jerome Bonaparte as a trophy, but he gave it to a Dutch surgeon who collected oddities, and it remained at the University of Leiden until 1837, when German patriots obtained it for the dedication of a Schill monument in Brunswick. Schill's Eleven Officers Eleven of Schill's officers were taken as a group to several different cities before their fate was sealed by Napoleon's orders. Eventually they were taken to the fortress of Wesel where they were given a show trial and executed on September 16. The young group became tragic heroes and martyrs, and their appearance brought out crowds in every German- speaking town and city they went through. A dramatic letter-writing campaign led by Philippine von Griesheim, the fiance of one of the eleven officers, Albrecht von Wedell, and appeals to the Prussian King Frederick William III by the eleven asking to die by a Prussian firing squad instead of at the 'hands of the enemy' helped create a legend that would become part of the propaganda encouraging the German liberation movement of 1813 leading to Prussia's restoration of independence. One other close comrade of Schill's escaped execution and became known as 'The Twelfth'. Lieutenant Heinrich von Wedell had served with Schill as far back as the Siege of Kolberg. He was badly wounded at the battle of Dodendort and had to remain behind there. He was captured and interrogated by the French. Heinrich managed to convince the French that he had participated against his will and so he was sent to France, physically branded a criminal, and served eight months on a prison ship and then hard labor in a prison quarry before eventually being released in early 1812 in anticipation of the impending war with Russia. He was the cousin of Carl and Albrecht von Wedell who were among the eleven Schill officers executed at Wesel. Another of Schill's officers, the Swede Friedrich-Gustave Peterson was executed by firing squad in Stralsund. Legacy By the 1830s Schill was widely considered a hero throughout Germany. Monuments and historical markers to him or to his rebels have been erected in towns and cities: Wesel, Stralsund, Braunschweig, Wilmersdorf, Potsdam, Ohlau, Cottbus, Anklam, Geldern, and Wittenberg. Military units were named after him (most notably the last division fielded by the Wehrmacht during World War II, the Infantry Division Ferdinand von Schill of late April 1945), streets and plazas bear his name to this day. Over 400 biographies, novels, plays, operas, and collections of poetry have been published about him in German, and he is featured in over a dozen German films including Rudolf Meinert's 1926 silent film The Eleven Schill Officers and his 1932 sound remake.

It has a population of 13,666 (as of 1 January 2017) and covers an area of 10.54 km¬≤. Sillam√§e is located at the mouth of S√µtke River. History The locality of Sillam√§ggi was first mentioned in 1502 when the area was under the control of Livonian Order. The bridge across S√µtke and a mill in Sillam√§ggi were documented in 1700. In the 1800s, Sillam√§ggi developed into a resort village offering a more tranquil experience than the nearby resort town of Hungerburg. Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov owned a dacha in Sillam√§ggi and vacationed there during summer breaks in 1891‚Äì1917. Among other famous vacationers of Sillam√§ggi were poet Konstantin Balmont (1905), painter Albert Benois (1898 and 1899), physicist Paul Ehrenfest (1908‚Äì1912), botanist Andrei Famintsyn (1890s), historian Mikhail Gershenzon (1911‚Äì1914), inventor Boris Rosing (1902‚Äì1911), composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1868). In the 1920s and 1930s, Sillam√§e and surrounding countryside saw the rise of the oil shale mining industry in the area. In 1927‚Äì1929, a Swedish company Estl√§ndska Oljeskifferkonsortiet built an oil shale processing plant and a power station at the location of the T√ºrsam√§e manor, on the western side of Sillam√§e. This plant reached a total capacity of 500 tonnes per day in the mid-1930s. A small harbour was constructed in Sillam√§e to support the plant activities, but it was destroyed during World War II. During the Nazi occupation, several concentration camps were established in the vicinity of Sillam√§e to employ slave-laborers in the local mines. Upon withdrawal from Sillam√§e in 1944, German forces sabotaged the processing plant. The defensive positions of Germans on the hills to the east of Sillam√§e, known as Sinim√§ed, formed the Tannenberg Line during the Battle of Narva. In 1946‚Äì1948, the former oil shale processing plant in Sillam√§e was rebuilt by Soviets to extract uranium oxide from the locally mined Dictyonema argillite ore (a type of oil shale). During that time, many war prisoners were employed at the construction and mining activities in Sillam√§e. The uranium extraction process at the Sillam√§e plant was developed in collaboration with a nearby Narva pilot plant (known as Cloth Dyeing Factory) and produced mainly a 40% uranium concentrate at the onset of plant production. The local mining operations continued until 1952. In the following years, richer uranium ores were imported to the Sillam√§e plant from various locations of Central Asia and the Eastern Bloc, mainly from mines in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania including Bihor mine operated by Sovromcuar≈£ (one of the SovRoms operated jointly by the Soviet Union and Romania). In 1970, the plant started to process loparite ore from Kola Peninsula producing tantalum and niobium chemicals. Later, it also started to extract rare earth metal oxides. In 1982, the plant began the production of reactor-grade enriched uranium (2‚Äì4.4% 235U) in form of UO2. Uranium production at Sillam√§e continued to supply nuclear materials for the Soviet nuclear power plants and weapon facilities until 1989. In the years of 1950‚Äì1989, the plant produced about 98,681 tonnes of uranium (mostly as U3O8) and 1354.7 tonnes of enriched uranium. During its operations, the Sillam√§e plant dumped the processing wastes into a tailing pond at the north-western part of Sillam√§e near the Baltic Sea shoreline. By the 1990s, the pond presented a serious ecological hazard due to leaching of radioactive and other harmful particulates and dissolved materials into Baltic Sea. In the 2000s, measures were undertaken to secure the containment of the wastes at Sillam√§e. In 1957, Sillam√§e officially gained a town status. By that time, Sillam√§e already grew beyond the historical boundaries of Sillam√§ggi and included several neighboring settlements including Kannuka and T√ºrsam√§e. During the Soviet regime in Estonia, Sillam√§e remained a closed town due to the secrecy and security measures related to the uranium production activities at the local plant. Economy Soviet atomic statue (1987) in Sillam√§e, Estonia. After uranium processing ceased in 1989 and Estonia regained independence in 1991, industrial activity at Sillam√§e experienced significant decline throughout the 1990s resulting in a high unemployment rate among the local population. The Sillam√§e plant was privatized in 1997 to form AS Silmet and continues to produce rare metal and rare earth metal products. It remains the top world producer of niobium and tantalum products including hydroxides, oxides, various grades of metal, metal hydrides, metal powders and NbNi alloy. Among rare earth element products are lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium and samarium-europium-gadolinium carbonates, oxides, metals, chloride and nitrate solutions. On 4 April 2011, the American rare earth metal producer Molycorp announced its acquisition of a 90% stake in AS Silmet. The deal was valued at $89 million at the time. The company was renamed AS Silmet- Molycorp. In 2005, a deep-sea port (SILPORT) with facilities able to handle dry bulk, liquid fertilizers and oil was opened in Sillam√§e. A regular ferry service between Sillam√§e and Kotka, Finland was inaugurated in 2006, but was forced to shut down in 2007 due to a low load factor. However, the cargo operations continue to show a steady growth. In 2011, the Sillam√§e port reached 4.9 million metric tonnes in cargo traffic taking fifth place among the largest ports in the Baltic states after Tallinn, Riga, Klaipeda and Ventspils.

It may be served as a hot porridge, or it may be allowed to cool and solidify into a loaf that can be baked, fried, or grilled. The variety of cereal used is usually yellow maize, but often buckwheat, white maize, or mixtures thereof may be used. Coarse grinds make a firm, coarse polenta; finer grinds make a creamy, soft polenta. Polenta is a staple of Northern Italian, Swiss, Slovenian and the Balkans (where it is also called kaƒçamak) cuisines (and, to a lesser extent, the Central Italian one, e.g. Tuscany) and its consumption was traditionally associated with lower classes, as in times past cornmeal mush was an essential food in their everyday nutrition. In Romania and Moldova, this dish is known as mƒÉmƒÉligƒÉ. Fried polenta with marinara sauce. Polenta served in the traditional manner on a round wooden cutting board. La Polenta by Pietro Longhi Etymology Latin polenta covered any hulled and crushed grain, especially barley-meal, and is derived from the Latin pollen for \\"fine flour\\", which shares a root with pulvis, meaning \\"dust\\".Oxford English Dictionary 3rd edition, 2006, s.v. History As it is known today, polenta derives from earlier forms of grain mush (known as puls or pulmentum in Latin) that were commonly eaten since Roman times. Before the introduction of corn (maize) from America in the 16th century, polenta was made from starchy ingredients like farro (wheat), chestnut flour, millet, spelt (wheat), and chickpeas. Cooking time Polenta takes a long time to cook, simmering in four to five times its volume of watery liquid for about 45 minutes with near-constant stirring; this is necessary for even gelatinization of the starch. Some alternative cooking techniques have been invented to speed up the process, or to not require constant supervision. Quick-cooking (pre- cooked, instant) polenta is widely used and is prepared in just a few minutes; it is considered inferior to polenta made from unprocessed cornmeal and is best eaten after being baked or fried. In his book Heat, Bill Buford talks about his experiences as a line cook in Mario Batali's Italian restaurant Babbo. Buford details the differences in taste between instant polenta and slow-cooked polenta, and describes a method of preparation that takes up to three hours, but does not require constant stirring: \\"polenta, for most of its cooking, is left unattended.... If you don't have to stir it all the time, you can cook it for hours‚Äîwhat does it matter, as long as you're nearby?\\" Cook's Illustrated magazine has described a method using a microwave oven that reduces cooking time to 12 minutes and requires only a single stirring. In March 2010, it presented a stovetop, near-stir-less method that uses a pinch of baking soda (an alkali), which replicates the traditional effect. Kyle Phillips suggested making it in a polenta maker or in a slow cooker.

Konrad von W√ºrzburg (died August 31, 1287) was the chief German poet of the second half of the 13th century. As little is known of his life as that of any other epic poet of the age. By birth probably a native of W√ºrzburg, he seems to have spent part of his life in Strassburg and his later years in Basel, where he died. Like his master, Gottfried von Strassburg, W√ºrzburg did not belong to the nobility, from which most of the poets of the time sprang. His varied and voluminous literary work is comparatively free from the degeneration which set in so rapidly in Middle High German poetry during the 13th century. His style, although occasionally diffuse, is dignified in tone; his metre is clearly influenced by Gottfried's tendency to relieve the monotony of the epic-metre with ingenious variations, but it is always correct; his narratives‚Äîif we except Die halbe Birn, of which the authorship is doubtful‚Äîare free from coarseness, to which the popular poets at this time were prone, and, although mysticism and allegory bulk largely in his works, they were not allowed, as in so many of his contemporaries, to usurp the place of poetry. W√ºrzburg wrote a number of legends (Alexius, Silvester, Pantaleon) illustrating Christian virtues and dogma; Der Welt Lohn, a didactic allegory on the familiar theme of Frau Welt, the woman beautiful in front, unsightly and loathsome behind. Die goldene Schmiede is a panegyric of the Virgin Mary; the Klage der Kunst, an allegorical defence of poetry. His most ambitious works are two enormously long epics, Der trojanische Krieg (of more than 40,000 verses, which still left the work unfinished) and Partenopier und Meliur, both of which are based on French originals. W√ºrzburg's powers are to be seen to best advantage in his shorter verse romances, such as Engelhart und Engeltrut, Kaiser Otto and Das Herzemaere; the last mentioned, the theme of which has been made familiar to modern readers by Uhland in his Kastellan von Coucy, is one of the best poems of its kind in Middle High German literature. There is no uniform edition of W√ºrzburg's works. Some examples are: *Der trojanische Krieg was edited by A von Keller for the Stuttgart Literarische Verein (1858) *Partonopier und Meliur, by K Bartsch (1871) *Die goldene Schniede and Silvester, by W Grimm (1840 and 1841) *Alexius, by HF Massmann (1843) and R Haczynski (1898) *Der Welt Lohn, by F Roth (1843) *Engelhart und Engeltrut, by Moritz Haupt (1844, 2nd ed., 1890) *Klage der Kunst, by E Joseph (1885). The shorter poems, Otto and Herzemaere, will be found most conveniently in Erz√§hlungen und Schw√§nke des Mittelalters, edited by H Lambel (2nd ed., 1883). Modern German translations of W√ºrzburg's most popular poems have been published by K Pannier and H Kruger in Reclams Universalbibliothek (1879-1891).

In the Middle Ages, the neighboring Syunik region (also known as Sisakan, after the town of Sisian) sometimes lent its name to Artsakh, which would sometimes be referred to as \\"Little Syunik\\" or \\"Second Syunik.\\" Important places (mostly fortified towns) included Parisos, Tigranakert, Sodk, Tsar, Vaykunik, Asteghblur, Goroz and Berdaglukh. The fortress of Tigranakert, which was first excavated in 2005, is believed to have been founded by King Tigranes the Great of Armenia in the 1st century BC, although conceivably it could also have been founded by King Tigranes I (123‚Äì55 BC).Hewsen. Armenia, p. 62. Later, in the Caucasian Albanian period, the village of Gyutakan (Armenian: ‘≥’µ’∏÷Ç’ø’°’Ø’°’∂, known as the \\"Royal Village\\") became of great importance as the residence of Vachagan III the Pious (467‚Äì510 AD), the last King of Caucasian Albania. During early medieval times, the castle of Khachen served for a considerable time as the center of Artsakh. Cantons According to anonymous 7th century Armenian \\"Geography\\" (Ashkharatsoyts) Artsakh comprised 12 cantons (gavars):Hewsen.

According to some Armenian scholars, Artsakh formed a principality with the adjacent canton of Sodk. Conceivably it was royal land. Its northern part also comprised the principality of Koght and it is possible that the princes of Koght were the original owners of Artsakh. Under the rule of Caucasian Albania, Artsakh, while often referred to, was not a recognized political entity. By the 9th century it comprised a number of small political units, including the principalities of Khachen in the center and Dizak in the south. Only in the 13th century did these two states merge into one ‚Äì the Kingdom of Artsakh. Population Armenian inscribed text in Dadivank Monastery, shows a masterpiece of medieval culture of Artsakh.

Following the modern consensus among western scholars concerning the origin of the Armenian people, they represent a fusion of the mostly Indo-European natives of the Armenian Plateau (including Artsakh) and the proto-Armenians, conventionally called the \\"Armens\\" of Armenian Plateau.Hewsen. Armenia, p. 58.Hewsen, Robert H. \\"Ethno- History and the Armenian Influence upon the Caucasian Albanians\\" in Samuelian, Thomas J. (Ed.), Classical Armenian Culture. Influences and Creativity, Chico: 1982, pp. 27‚Äì40. According to this theory, from earliest time the Armenian Plateau was inhabited by many ethnic groups. The ethnic character of Artsakh may thus have been originally more diverse than it is now. It may have even been the homeland of the ancient tribes who lived in the region of Arran, although that is not certain.Hewsen. Armenia, pp. 10, 58. It is worth noting that Strabo described Armenia (which then included also Artsakh and Utik) in the 2nd century BC as \\"monolingual\\", though this does not necessarily mean that its population consisted exclusively of ethnic Armenians.V. A. Shnirelman. Memory wars. Myths, identity and politics in Transcaucasia. Academkniga, Moscow, 2003 According to the Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, the proto- Armenians had settled in Artsakh already by the 7th century BC, though until the 6th‚Äì5th centuries BC the Armenians in the strict sense must have lived only on the western half of the Armenian Plateau (in areas between Cappadocia, the Tigris, the Euphrates, and the lake of Van).R. Schmitt, M. L. Chaumont. Armenia and Iran. Encyclop√¶dia Iranica The proto-Armenians came to Artsakh and adjacent mountainous regions (such as Syunik) somewhat later than the central parts of the Armenian Plateau. They intermarried with the pre-Armenian inhabitants to form the present Armenian people. By medieval times, from at least the 9th century, the population of Artsakh had a strong Armenian national identity. Its people spoke a local Eastern Armenian dialect, the Artsakhian dialect (today known as the Karabakh dialect), which was mentioned by 7th century grammarian Stepanos Syunetsi in his earliest record of the Armenian dialectsHewsen. Armenia, pp. 85‚Äì86. History Traditional views According to a traditional Armenian view, based on the accounts of early medieval Armenian historiographers Movses Khorenatsi and Movses Kaghankatvatsi, Artsakh was originally the dominion of a certain Aran who was the progenitor of the House of Aranshahik ‚Äì \\"the ancient native Armenian family\\".The History of the Caucasian Albanians by Movsƒìs Dasxuranc'i.

The genealogy of Aran (old spelling: Eran, hence: Eranshahik) is preserved by the historiographer Movses Kaghankatvatsi, who wrote that Aran belonged to the lineage of the ancient patriarchs and kings of Armenia, including Hayk, Aramaneak, Aramayis, Gegham, Aram, Ara the Beautiful, Haykak, Norayr, Hrant, Perch, Skayordi, Paruyr, Hrachea, Ervand (Orontes) Sakavakeats, Tigranes et al.

Early history In 1965, Soviet archaeologists discovered the bones of a pre-Homo sapiens human dating back possibly to the Middle Acheulean culture in a cave near the village of Azokh in the province of Hadrut. Classical Era In general, archaeological remains in Artsakh reflect the competing influences from around 800 BC of the neighboring rival states of Urartu, Assyria, and Mannai. After the fall of Urartu (6th century BC), most of the region south of the Kura river came under the domination of the Medes followed by the Achaemenian Persians until 331 BC when Alexander the Great invaded the region during his wars with the Achaemenids, upsetting its balance of power.Balayan. p. 32. In 189 BC, when the Kingdom of Armenia was re-established by the Artaxiad dynasty, Artsakh became part of the new Armenian state. Strabo reports that King Artaxias I of Armenia (189 BC ‚Äì 159 BC) expanded his state in all directions at the expense of his neighbors . At this time, he conquered from the lands of Caspiane, before that ruled by the Medes, and \\"Phaunitis\\" (supposedly a copyist error for Saunities, i.e. Siwnik), Utik and possibly the unnamed land of Artsakh, lying between Syunik and the Caspian Sea. However it is possible that Artsakh had earlier been part of Orontid Armenia in the 4th‚Äì2nd centuries BC rather than under Median rule. Map of Orontid Armenia, 4th‚Äì2nd centuries BC (the inclusion of Artsakh and Utik is uncertain.) Christianity In 301 Armenia was converted to Christianity under the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia (themselves a branch of the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia. The Armenian historian Agathangelos mentioned the princes of Utik and Sawdk (which probably comprised Artsakh) among the sixteen Armenian princes, who escorted Grigor the Illuminator to Caesarea, where he would be enthroned the High Priest of their land.Agathangelos, The Conversion of Armenia, 795‚Äì796. Artsakh became a major stronghold for Armenian missionaries to proclaim the Christian Gospel to neighboring countries. In 310 St Grigoris, the grandson of Grigor the Illuminator, was ordained bishop of Caucasian Iberia and Caucasian Albania in the monastery of Amaras, being just 15 years old at the time.Pavstos Buzand, III.5. After his martyrdom by the Mazkutian king on the field of Vatnean (near Derbent), his disciples conveyed his body back to Artsakh and buried him in Amaras, which had been built by Grigor the Illuminator and Grigoris himself. Hence St Grigoris became a patron saint of Artsakh. The historiographer Pavstos Buzand wrote that \\"... every year the people of that places and cantons gathers there [in Amaras] for the festive commemoration of his valor\\".Pavstos Buzand, III.6. In the 5th century, Christian culture flourished in Artsakh. Around 410 Mesrop Mashtots opened at Amaras the first Armenian school.Viviano, Frank. \\"The Rebirth of Armenia,\\" National Geographic Magazine. March 2004. Later, more schools were opened in Artsakh.Movses Kaghankatsvatsi, 1.18. Armeno-Persian wars The second half of the 4th century saw a series of wars between the Kingdom of Armenia and Sassanid Persia. After enduring 34 years of warfare, the Armenian nobility of Artsakh and most of other provinces of Armenia revolted, refusing to support the Armenian king Arsaces II (Arshak II) anymore out of war- weariness.Hewsen. Armenia, p. 73. Following the defeat by the Sassanid and Caucasian Albanian armies, the Armenian strategist (sparapet) Mushegh Mamikonian severely punished the rebelling Armenian provinces, Artsakh included, and subjected them back under the rule of King Arsaces II after he started and won a war against the Sassanids together with Roman assistance. Then in 372 he attacked the Caucasian Albanians and took back from them the neighboring province of Utik, in the process re-establishing the river Kura as the boundary between Armenia and Caucasian Albania. Medieval Period Political map of the Caucasus c. 900. However, war between the Persian and Roman archrivals continued, and in 387 AD, according to the peace treaty between the two powers, the Armenian kingdom was partitioned between them. Caucasian Albania, as an ally of the Sassanids at the time, gained all the right bank of the river Kura up to the Araxes, including Artsakh and Utik.Chaumont, M. L.Albania . Encyclop√¶dia Iranica. Royal Standard of the Principality of Khachen (Kingdom of Artsakh) during the reign of Grand Prince Hasan Jalal Vahtangian (1214‚Äì1261) Following the inconclusive Battle of Avarayr (451), in which a united Christian army consisting of Armenians, Georgians, and Caucasian Albanians clashed with the Sassanid army, many of the Armenian nobles retreated to impassable mountains and forests in several provinces, including Artsakh, which became a center for resistance against Sassanid Iran.Jeghishe, About Vartan and the Armenian War. Translation and notes by Ye. Ter-Minasian. Yerevan 1989, sec. 6, p. 252-258. From the 5th to the 7th centuries AD Artsakh was ruled by the Armenian noble family of Arranshahiks. Furthermore, the Armenian rulers of Artsakh began to play a considerable role in the affairs of Caucasian Albania.Vladimir Minorsky. A History of Sharvan and Darband in the 10th‚Äì11th Centuries.

In the early 9th century two Armenian princes, Sahl Smbatian and Esayi Abu-Muse, revolted against Arab rule and established two independent principalities in Artsakh: Khachen and Dizak. At the time the Byzantine emperor Konstantinos Porphyrogennetos addressed letters \\"to prince of Khachen ‚Äì to Armenia\\", being the residence of the Armenian prince Sahl Smbatian. In 852‚Äì855 Sahl Smbatian and Esayi Abu-Muse fought against Arab commander Bugha. The latter 28 times unsuccessfully attempted to conquer Ktich Castle, the main stronghold of the Armenians of Artsakh. The ruins of Ktich (now Gtich) castle and the church are situated in the province of Hadrut in the modern Nagorno- Karabakh Republic. The House of Khachen continued to rule Artsakh intermittently as vassals until the early 19th century, through the subsequent full domination by the Kara Koyunlu, Ak Koyunlu, Iranian Safavids, Zands, Afsharids, and Qajars, until it was ceded to Imperial Russia following the outcome of the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813) and the following Treaty of Gulistan. It was then often referred to the Land of Khachen (later Karabakh).

Cleveland Indians On March 30, 1978, D√≠az was traded along with Ted Cox, Mike Paxton and Rick Wise to the Cleveland Indians for Dennis Eckersley and Fred Kendall. He played as the Indians' backup catcher, working behind Gary Alexander in 1978. He lost his job to Ron Hassey the following season, and played most of the year in the minor leagues with the Tacoma Tugs in the Pacific Coast League, before returning to play for the Indians in September 1979. In 1980, he hit for a .227 average in 76 games but, provided solid defense, committing only 4 errors in 356 total chances, while serving as backup catcher behind Hassey. After Hassey was injured early in the strike- shortened 1981 season, Cleveland manager Dave Garcia began using D√≠az in a platoon role alongside the left-hand hitting Hassey. By June, he was hitting for a .356 batting average with 4 home runs and 25 runs batted in to earn a place as a reserve player for the American League team in the 1981 All-Star Game. He ended the season with a .313 batting average in 63 games. Philadelphia Phillies In November , D√≠az was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies as part of a three-team trade. He became the Phillies starting catcher in 1982, replacing Bob Boone, who had been traded to the California Angels. D√≠az set career highs in batting average (.288), home runs (18), and runs batted in (85). Although D√≠az led National League catchers in stolen bases allowed, his pitch-calling skills helped pitcher Steve Carlton become the league's only twenty-game winner of the season. Carlton also led the league in strikeouts and shutouts and, was named the National League Cy Young Award winner. In a 1982 computer ranking of major league players that used offensive and defensive statistics, D√≠az was ranked second among National League catchers behind only Gary Carter. D√≠az was a member of the 1983 Phillies team that became known as The Wheeze Kids, due to the average age of the team being over thirty. The moniker was a whimsical reference to the Whiz Kids Phillies team that won the National League pennant in 1950. In a game against the New York Mets on April 13, 1983, D√≠az performed a feat that has only been accomplished by 11 other players in the history of Major League Baseball. The Phillies were trailing by a score of 9 to 6 and with two outs in the ninth inning, when D√≠az hit a grand slam home run off Neil Allen to win the game for the Phillies by a score of 10 to 9. On September 23, D√≠az was the Phillies catcher when Steve Carlton won the 300th game of his career. With the Phillies leading the game by a score of 3 to 2 in the fifth inning, D√≠az sealed the victory with a two-run single. The Phillies won 12 out of the final 14 games of the season to win the National League Eastern Division title. D√≠az contributed by hitting .360 in the final week of the season, including a game on September 28 against the Chicago Cubs in which he had 5 hits in 5 at-bats including 2 home runs. Although he led National League catchers in errors, he led the league in range factor and finished second in putouts, assists and in baserunners caught stealing. After defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1983 National League Championship Series, the Phillies lost the 1983 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles in five games. In the only World Series appearance of his career, D√≠az was the leading hitter for the Phillies with a .333 batting average. During Game One of the Series (the only game of the Series that the Phillies won, by a 2-1 score), D√≠az almost hit a home-run, but he was robbed of it by John Lowenstein with a spectacular, beyond the wall catch. In 1984, D√≠az went on the disabled list twice due to knee problems and played in only 27 games. After the season ended, he underwent two knee surgeries to restore his mobility. D√≠az broke his right wrist at the beginning of the 1985 season and was on the disabled list for a month and a half. During his absence, his replacement, Ozzie Virgil hit above the .300 mark, relegating D√≠az to the backup catcher's role upon his return. On August 8, 1985, the Phillies traded D√≠az to the Cincinnati Reds. Cincinnati Reds D√≠az immediately became the Reds' starting catcher. He had been hitting for a .211 average at the time of the trade but, hit .261 in 51 games for the Reds, ending the 1985 season with a .245 average overall along with 5 home runs and 31 runs batted in. D√≠az remained healthy in 1986, appearing in 134 games and posted a .272 average with 10 home runs and 56 runs batted in. Although he committed 13 errors, he finished fourth among catchers in assists with 80 and, fourth in baserunners caught stealing with 55. On June 27, , D√≠az was part of an unusual occurrence when San Francisco Giants second baseman, Robby Thompson, became the first player in major league history to be caught stealing four times in one game. Thompson was thrown out at second base by D√≠az in the 4th, 6th and 9th innings and was picked off by pitcher John Franco in the 11th inning. Three of the outs occurred during attempted hit and run plays and were recorded as stolen base attempts. In 1987, D√≠az was hitting for a .292 average at mid-season, earning his second All-Star selection as a reserve player, this time for the National League team in the 1987 All-Star Game. He was named Player of the Month for the month of July during which he produced a .351 batting average with 5 home runs and 23 runs batted in, including a game on July 7 when he had 6 runs batted in. His heavy workload continued as he played in 140 games, ending the season with a respectable .270 average with 15 home runs and 82 runs batted in. D√≠az also led National League catchers in baserunners caught stealing and finished third in fielding percentage, committing only 7 errors in 137 games played as a catcher. Reds' manager Pete Rose continued to play D√≠az almost every day in the 1988 season. D√≠az was the Reds catcher on June 6, 1988, when pitcher Tom Browning almost threw a no-hitter against the San Diego Padres. Browning held the Padres hitless through eight innings before Tony Gwynn hit a single with one out in the ninth inning (however, Browning would go on to throw a perfect game two months later on September 16 against the Dodgers). Eventually, the heavy workload began to catch up with D√≠az. In mid-June, a shoulder injury put him on the disabled list and then in September, D√≠az had to undergo arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, which ended his season. He shared catching duties with Jeff Reed in 1989 but, in July D√≠az had to undergo arthroscopic surgery on his left knee for a second time, which ended his season. D√≠az decided to retire, having played in his final major league game on July 9, at the age of 36. Career statistics In a 13-year major league career, D√≠az played in 993 games, accumulating 834 hits in 3,274 at bats for a .255 career batting average along with 87 home runs, 452 runs batted in and a .297 on-base percentage. A two-time All-Star, he finished his career with a .986 fielding percentage. Leones del Caracas D√≠az played exclusively for the Leones del Caracas team in the Venezuelan Winter League (‚Äì), forming a fiery offensive combo along with slugger Tony Armas. During his time in the league, D√≠az batted .281, with 265 runs scored, 290 runs batted in, 79 doubles, 7 triples, and 57 home runs, in 537 games played. In , he set a Venezuelan League single- season record for home runs with 20, a record that was broken by Alex Cabrera, who hit 21 in 2013-2014 season. D√≠az was the leading hitter in the 1982 Caribbean Series with a .412 batting average and 2 home runs. D√≠az was part of an extremely unlikely event spanning thirteen years. On January 6, 1973, he caught for minor league pitcher Urbano Lugo, who threw a no-hitter as the Leones del Caracas defeated the Tiburones de La Guaira, 6‚Äì0. Thirteen years later, on January 24, 1986, D√≠az was the catcher for another no-hitter in a 4‚Äì0 Caracas' victory over La Guaira. This time, the pitcher was major leaguer Urbano Lugo, Jr., son of the elder Lugo. Death On November 23, , D√≠az was killed when a satellite dish he was adjusting on the roof of his Caracas home fell on him and crushed his neck and head. He was 37 years old at the time of his death. D√≠az was survived by his wife, Maria, and two sons.

Buenker, John C. Boosham, and Robert M. Crunden, Progressivism (1986) pp 3‚Äì21 The main objectives of the Progressive movement were addressing problems caused by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and political corruption. The movement primarily targeted political machines and their bosses. By taking down these corrupt representatives in office, a further means of direct democracy would be established. They also sought regulation of monopolies (trustbusting) and corporations through antitrust laws, which were seen as a way to promote equal competition for the advantage of legitimate competitors. They also advocated for new government roles and regulations, and new agencies to carry out those roles, such as the FDA. Many progressives supported prohibition of alcoholic beverages, ostensibly to destroy the political power of local bosses based in saloons, but others out of a religious motivation.James H. Timberlake, Prohibition and the progressive movement, 1900‚Äì1920 (1970) pp 1‚Äì7. Women's suffrage was promoted to bring a \\"purer\\" female vote into the arena.On purification, see David W.

A third theme was building an Efficiency Movement in every sector that could identify old ways that needed modernizing, and bring to bear scientific, medical and engineering solutions; a key part of the efficiency movement was scientific management, or \\"Taylorism\\". In Michael McGerr's book A Fierce Discontent, Jane Addams stated that she believed in the necessity of \\"association\\" of stepping across the social boundaries of industrial America. Many activists joined efforts to reform local government, public education, medicine, finance, insurance, industry, railroads, churches, and many other areas. Progressives transformed, professionalized and made \\"scientific\\" the social sciences, especially history, economics, and political science. In academic fields, the day of the amateur author gave way to the research professor who published in the new scholarly journals and presses. The national political leaders included Republicans Theodore Roosevelt, Robert M. La Follette and Charles Evans Hughes, and Democrats William Jennings Bryan, Woodrow Wilson and Al Smith. Leaders of the movement also existed far from presidential politics: Jane Addams, Grace Abbott, Edith Abbott and Sophonisba Breckinridge were among the most influential non-governmental Progressive Era reformers. Initially the movement operated chiefly at the local level, but later it expanded to the state and national levels. Progressives drew support from the middle class, and supporters included many lawyers, teachers, physicians, ministers, and business people.George Mowry, The California Progressives (1963) p 91. Some Progressives strongly supported scientific methods as applied to economics, government, industry, finance, medicine, schooling, theology, education, and even the family. They closely followed advances underway at the time in Western EuropeDaniel T. Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998) and adopted numerous policies, such as a major transformation of the banking system by creating the Federal Reserve System in 1913 and the arrival of cooperative banking in the US with the founding of its first credit union in 1908. Reformers felt that old-fashioned ways meant waste and inefficiency, and eagerly sought out the \\"one best system\\".Lewis L. Gould, America in the Progressive Era, 1890‚Äì1914 (2000)David B. Tyack, The One Best System: A History of American Urban Education (Harvard UP, 1974), p. 39 Originators of progressive ideals and efforts Certain key groups of thinkers, writers, and activists played key roles in creating or building the movements and ideas that came to define the shape of the Progressive Era. Muckraking: exposing corruption upright=1.3 Magazines experienced a boost in popularity in 1900, with some attaining circulations in the hundreds of thousands of subscribers. In the beginning of the age of Mass media, the rapid expansion of national advertising led the cover price of popular magazines to fall sharply to about 10 cents, lessening the financial barrier to consume them. Another factor contributing to the dramatic upswing in magazine circulation was the prominent coverage of corruption in politics, local government and big business, particularly by journalists and writers who became known as muckrakers. They wrote for popular magazines to expose social and political sins and shortcomings. Relying on their own investigative journalism, muckrakers often worked to expose social ills and corporate and political corruption. Muckraking magazines, notably McClure's, took on corporate monopolies and crooked political machines while raising public awareness of chronic urban poverty, unsafe working conditions, and social issues like child labor.Herbert Shapiro, ed., The muckrakers and American society (Heath, 1968), contains representative samples as well as academic commentary. Most of the muckrakers wrote nonfiction, but fictional expos√©s often had a major impact as well, such as those by Upton Sinclair.Judson A. Grenier, \\"Muckraking the muckrakers: Upton Sinclair and his peers.\\" in David R Colburn and Sandra Pozzetta, eds., Reform and Reformers in the Progressive Era (1983) pp: 71‚Äì92. In his 1906 novel The Jungle Sinclair exposed the unsanitary and inhumane practices of the meat packing industry, as he made clear in the Jungle itself. He quipped, \\"I aimed at the public's heart and by accident I hit it in the stomach,\\" as readers demanded and got the Meat Inspection ActThe Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act.Arlene F. Kantor, \\"Upton Sinclair and the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906.: 'I aimed at the public's heart and by accident I hit it in the stomach'.\\" American Journal of Public Health 66.12 (1976): 1202‚Äì1205. The journalists who specialized in exposing waste, corruption, and scandal operated at the state and local level, like Ray Stannard Baker, George Creel, and Brand Whitlock. Others such as Lincoln Steffens exposed political corruption in many large cities; Ida Tarbell is famed for her criticisms of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company. In 1906, David Graham Phillips unleashed a blistering indictment of corruption in the U.S. Senate. Roosevelt gave these journalists their nickname when he complained they were not being helpful by raking up all the muck.Robert Miraldi, ed. The Muckrakers: Evangelical Crusaders (Praeger, 2000)Harry H. Stein, \\"American Muckrakers and Muckraking: The 50-Year Scholarship,\\" Journalism Quarterly, (1979) 56#1 pp. 9‚Äì17 Modernization The Progressives were avid modernizers, with a belief in science and technology as the grand solution to society's flaws. They looked to education as the key to bridging the gap between their present wasteful society and technologically enlightened future society. Characteristics of Progressivism included a favorable attitude toward urban- industrial society, belief in mankind's ability to improve the environment and conditions of life, belief in an obligation to intervene in economic and social affairs, a belief in the ability of experts and in the efficiency of government intervention.John D. Buenker, and Robert M. Crunden.

Taylor and the Rise of Scientific Management (1970). Philanthropy The number of rich families climbed exponentially, from 100 or so millionaires in the 1870s, to 4000 in 1892 and 16,000 in 1916. Many subscribed to Andrew Carnegie's credo outlined in The Gospel of Wealth that said they owed a duty to society that called for philanthropic giving to colleges, hospitals, medical research, libraries, museums, religion and social betterment.Olivier Zunz, Philanthropy in America: A History (2012) ch 1 excerpt and text search In the early 20th century, American philanthropy matured, with the development of very large, highly visible private foundations created by Rockefeller, and Carnegie. The largest foundations fostered modern, efficient, business-oriented operations (as opposed to \\"charity\\") designed to better society rather than merely enhance the status of the giver. Close ties were built with the local business community, as in the \\"community chest\\" movement.Nikki Mandell, \\"Allies or Antagonists?

August, 2013, online Several major foundations aided the blacks in the South, and were typically advised by Booker T. Washington. By contrast, Europe and Asia had few foundations. This allowed both Carnegie and Rockefeller to operate internationally with powerful effect.Zunz, p. 42  The middle class theory  Charlotte Perkins Gilman (pictured) wrote these articles about feminism for the Atlanta Constitution, published on 10 December 1916. A hallmark group of the Progressive Era, the middle class became the driving force behind much of the thought and reform that took place in this time. With an increasing disdain for the upper class and aristocracy of the time, the middle class is characterized by their rejection of the individualistic philosophy of the Upper ten. They had a rapidly growing interest in the communication and role between classes, those of which are generally referred to as the upper class, working class, farmers, and themselves. Along these lines, the founder of Hull-House, Jane Addams, coined the term \\"association\\" as a counter to Individualism, with association referring to the search for a relationship between the classes. Additionally, the middle class (most notably women) began to move away from prior Victorian era domestic values. Divorce rates increased as women preferred to seek education and freedom from the home. Victorianism was pushed aside in favor of the rise of the Progressives. Individual activists' efforts and works Politicians and government officials * President Theodore Roosevelt was a leader of the Progressive movement, and he championed his \\"Square Deal\\" domestic policies, promising the average citizen fairness, breaking of trusts, regulation of railroads, and pure food and drugs. He made conservation a top priority and established many new national parks, forests, and monuments intended to preserve the nation's natural resources. In foreign policy, he focused on Central America where he began construction of the Panama Canal. He expanded the army and sent the Great White Fleet on a world tour to project the United States' naval power around the globe. His successful efforts to broker the end of the Russo-Japanese War won him the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize. He avoided controversial tariff and money issues. He was elected to a full term in 1904 and continued to promote progressive policies, some of which were passed in Congress. By 1906 he was moving to the left, advocating for some social welfare programs, and criticizing various business practices such as trusts. The leadership of the GOP in Congress moved to the right, as did his protege President William Howard Taft. Roosevelt broke bitterly with Taft in 1910, and also with Wisconsin's progressive leader Robert M. La Follette. Taft defeated Roosevelt for the 1912 Republican nomination and Roosevelt set up an entirely new Progressive Party. It called for a \\"New Nationalism\\" with active supervision of corporations, higher taxes, and unemployment and old-age insurance. He supported voting rights for women, but was silent on civil rights for blacks, who remained in the regular Republican fold. He lost and his new party collapsed, as conservatism dominated the GOP for decades to come. Biographer William Harbaugh argues: ::In foreign affairs, Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs legacy is judicious support of the national interest and promotion of world stability through the maintenance of a balance of power; creation or strengthening of international agencies, and resort to their use when practicable; and implicit resolve to use military force, if feasible, to foster legitimate American interests. In domestic affairs, it is the use of government to advance the public interest. \\"If on this new continent\\", he said, \\"we merely build another country of great but unjustly divided material prosperity, we shall have done nothing\\".William H. Harbaugh, \\"Roosevelt, Theodore (27 October 1858 ‚Äì 06 January 1919)\\" American National Biography (1999) online * President Woodrow Wilson introduced a comprehensive program of domestic legislation at the outset of his administration, something no president had ever done before.Cooper (2009), pp. 183‚Äì184 He had four major domestic priorities: the conservation of natural resources, banking reform, tariff reduction, and equal access to raw materials, which would be accomplished in part through the regulation of trusts.Cooper (2009), pp. 186‚Äì187 Though foreign affairs would increasingly dominate his presidency starting in 1915, Wilson's first two years in office largely focused on the implementation of his New Freedom domestic agenda.Cooper (2009), pp. 212‚Äì213, 274 :Wilson presided over the passage of his progressive New Freedom domestic agenda. His first major priority was the passage of the Revenue Act of 1913, which lowered tariffs and implemented a federal income tax. Later tax acts implemented a federal estate tax and raised the top income tax rate to 77 percent. Wilson also presided over the passage of the Federal Reserve Act, which created a central banking system in the form of the Federal Reserve System. Two major laws, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Clayton Antitrust Act, were passed to regulate business and prevent monopolies. Wilson did not support civil rights and did not object to accelerating segregate of federal employees. In World War I he made internationalism a key element of the progressive outlook, as expressed in his Fourteen Points and the League of Nationsan ideal called Wilsonianism.Tony Smith, Why Wilson Matters: The Origin of American Liberal Internationalism and Its Crisis Today (2019). * Charles Evans Hughes, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, played a key role in upholding many reforms, tending to align with Oliver Wendell Holmes. He voted to uphold state laws providing for minimum wages, workmen's compensation, and maximum work hours for women and children. He also wrote several opinions upholding the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause. His majority opinion in Baltimore & Ohio Railroad vs. Interstate Commerce Commission upheld the right of the federal government to regulate the hours of railroad workers. His majority opinion in the 1914 Shreveport Rate Case upheld the Interstate Commerce Commission's decision to void discriminatory railroad rates imposed by the Railroad Commission of Texas. The decision established that the federal government could regulate intrastate commerce when it affected interstate commerce, though Hughes avoided directly overruling the 1895 case of United States v. E. C. Knight Co.. * Gifford Pinchot was an American forester and politician. Pinchot served as the first Chief of the United States Forest Service from 1905 until 1910, and was the 28th Governor of Pennsylvania, serving from 1923 to 1927, and again from 1931 to 1935. He was a member of the Republican Party for most of his life, though he also joined the Progressive Party for a brief period. Pinchot is known for reforming the management and development of forests in the United States and for advocating the conservation of the nation's reserves by planned use and renewal. He called it \\"the art of producing from the forest whatever it can yield for the service of man.\\" Pinchot coined the term conservation ethic as applied to natural resources. Pinchot's main contribution was his leadership in promoting scientific forestry and emphasizing the controlled, profitable use of forests and other natural resources so they would be of maximum benefit to mankind. He was the first to demonstrate the practicality and profitability of managing forests for continuous cropping. His leadership put conservation of forests high on America's priority list.Robert Muccigrosso, ed., Research Guide to American Historical Biography (1988) 3:1238 Authors and journalists * Upton Sinclair was an American writer who wrote nearly 100 books and other works in several genres. Sinclair's work was well known and popular in the first half of the 20th century, and he won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1943. In 1906, Sinclair acquired particular fame for his classic muck-raking novel The Jungle, which exposed labor and sanitary conditions in the U.S. meatpacking industry, causing a public uproar that contributed in part to the passage a few months later of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act. In 1919, he published The Brass Check, a muck-raking expos√© of American journalism that publicized the issue of yellow journalism and the limitations of the \\"free press\\" in the United States. Four years after publication of The Brass Check, the first code of ethics for journalists was created.. :He is well remembered for the line: \\"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.\\" He used this line in speeches and the book about his campaign for governor as a way to explain why the editors and publishers of the major newspapers in California would not treat seriously his proposals for old age pensions and other progressive reforms. Many of his novels can be read as historical works. Sinclair describes the world of industrialized America from both the working man's and the industrialist's points of view. Novels such as King Coal (1917), The Coal War (published posthumously), Oil! (1927), and The Flivver King (1937) describe the working conditions of the coal, oil, and auto industries at the time. * Ida Tarbell, a writer and lecturer, was one of the leading muckrakers and pioneered investigative journalism. Tarbell is best known for her 1904 book, The History of the Standard Oil Company. The book was published as a series of articles in McClure's Magazine from 1902 to 1904. It has been called a \\"masterpiece of investigative journalism\\", by historian J. North Conway, as well as \\"the single most influential book on business ever published in the United States\\" by historian Daniel Yergin. The work would contribute to the dissolution of the Standard Oil monopoly and helped usher in the Hepburn Act of 1906, the Mann-Elkins Act, the creation of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Clayton Antitrust Act. * Lincoln Steffens was another investigative journalist and one of the leading muckrakers. He launched a series of articles in McClure's, called Tweed Days in St. Louis, that would later be published together in a book titled The Shame of the Cities. He is remembered for investigating corruption in municipal government in American cities and leftist values. Researchers and intellectual theorists * Henry George was an American political economist and journalist. His writing was immensely popular in the 19th century, and sparked several reform movements. His writings also inspired the economic philosophy known as Georgism, based on the belief that people should own the value they produce themselves, but that the economic value derived from land (including natural resources) should belong equally to all members of society. His most famous work, Progress and Poverty (1879), sold millions of copies worldwide, probably more than any other American book before that time. The treatise investigates the paradox of increasing inequality and poverty amid economic and technological progress, the cyclic nature of industrialized economies, and the use of rent capture such as land value tax and other anti-monopoly reforms as a remedy for these and other social problems. :The mid-20th century labor economist and journalist George Soule wrote that George was \\"By far the most famous American economic writer,\\" and \\"author of a book which probably had a larger world-wide circulation than any other work on economics ever written.\\"Soule, George. Ideas of the Great Economists. New English Library, 1979. * Herbert David Croly was an intellectual leader of the progressive movement as an editor, political philosopher and a co-founder of the magazine The New Republic in early twentieth-century America. His political philosophy influenced many leading progressives including Theodore Roosevelt, as well as his close friends Judge Learned Hand and Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter. His 1909 book The Promise of American Life looked to the constitutional liberalism as espoused by Alexander Hamilton, combined with the radical democracy of Thomas Jefferson. The book was one of the most influential in American political history, shaping the ideas of many intellectuals and political leaders. It also influenced the later New Deal. Calling themselves \\"The New Nationalists\\", Croly and Walter Weyl sought to remedy the relatively weak national institutions with a strong federal government. He promoted a strong army and navy and attacked pacifists who thought democracy at home and peace abroad was best served by keeping America weak. :Croly was one of the founders of modern liberalism in the United States, especially through his books, essays and a highly influential magazine founded in 1914, The New Republic. In his 1914 book Progressive Democracy, Croly rejected the thesis that the liberal tradition in the United States was inhospitable to anti-capitalist alternatives. He drew from the American past a history of resistance to capitalist wage relations that was fundamentally liberal, and he reclaimed an idea that progressives had allowed to lapse‚Äîthat working for wages was a lesser form of liberty. Increasingly skeptical of the capacity of social welfare legislation to remedy social ills, Croly argued that America's liberal promise could be redeemed only by syndicalist reforms involving workplace democracy. His liberal goals were part of his commitment to American republicanism. * Thorstein Veblen was an American economist and sociologist, who during his lifetime emerged as a well-known critic of capitalism. In his best-known book, The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899), Veblen coined the concept of conspicuous consumption and conspicuous leisure. Historians of economics regard Veblen as the founding father of the institutional economics school. Contemporary economists still theorize Veblen's distinction between \\"institutions\\" and \\"technology\\", known as the Veblenian dichotomy. As a leading intellectual, Veblen attacked production for profit. His emphasis on conspicuous consumption greatly influenced economists who engaged in non-Marxist critiques of capitalism and of technological determinism. Activists and organizers *Mary G. Harris Jones, known as Mother Jones, was an Irish-born American schoolteacher and dressmaker who became a prominent organized labor representative, community organizer, and activist. She helped coordinate major strikes and co-founded the Industrial Workers of the World. Jones worked as a teacher and dressmaker, but after her husband and four children all died of yellow fever in 1867 and her dress shop was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, she became an organizer for the Knights of Labor and the United Mine Workers union. From 1897 onwards, she was known as Mother Jones. In 1902, she was called \\"the most dangerous woman in America\\" for her success in organizing mine workers and their families against the mine owners. In 1903, to protest the lax enforcement of the child labor laws in the Pennsylvania mines and silk mills, she organized a children's march from Philadelphia to the home of President Theodore Roosevelt in New York.

Key ideas and issues Government reform Disturbed by the waste, inefficiency, stubbornness, corruption, and injustices of the Gilded Age, the Progressives were committed to changing and reforming every aspect of the state, society and economy. Significant changes enacted at the national levels included the imposition of an income tax with the Sixteenth Amendment, direct election of Senators with the Seventeenth Amendment, Prohibition with the Eighteenth Amendment, election reforms to stop corruption and fraud, and women's suffrage through the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.David E. Kyvig, Explicit and authentic acts: amending the U.S. Constitution, 1776‚Äì1995 (Kansas UP, 1996) pp. 208‚Äì14;Hedwig Richter: TRANSNATIONAL REFORM AND DEMOCRACY: ELECTION REFORMS IN NEW YORK CITY AND BERLIN AROUND 1900, in: Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era 15 (2016), 149‚Äì175 URL: https://www.academia.edu/25338056/_TRANSNATIONAL_REFORM_AND_DEMOCRACY_ELECTION_REFORMS_IN_NEW_YORK_CITY_AND_BERLIN_AROUND_1900_in_Journal_of_the_Gilded_Age_and_Progressive_Era_15_2016_149-175 A main objective of the Progressive Era movement was to eliminate corruption within the government. They made it a point to also focus on family, education, and many other important aspects that still are enforced today. The most important political leaders during this time were Theodore Roosevelt, Robert M. La Follette, Charles Evans Hughes, and Herbert Hoover. Some democratic leaders included William Jennings Bryan, Woodrow Wilson, and Al Smith. This movement targeted the regulations of huge monopolies and corporations. This was done through antitrust laws to promote equal competition amongst every business. This was done through the Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton Act of 1914, and the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914. Family and food Ben Lindsey, a pioneer in the establishment of juvenile court systems Progressives believed that the family was the foundation stone of American society, and the government, especially municipal government, must work to enhance the family.Gwendoline Alphonso, \\"Hearth and Soul: Economics and Culture in Partisan Conceptions of the Family in the Progressive Era, 1900‚Äì1920,\\" Studies in American Political Development, Oct 2010, Vol. 24 Issue 2, pp. 206‚Äì32 Local public assistance programs were reformed to try to keep families together. Inspired by crusading Judge Ben Lindsey of Denver, cities established juvenile courts to deal with disruptive teenagers without sending them to adult prisons.D'Ann Campbell, \\"Judge Ben Lindsey and the Juvenile Court Movement, 1901‚Äì1904,\\" Arizona and the West, 1976, Vol. 18 Issue 1, pp. 5‚Äì20James Marten, ed. Children and Youth during the Gilded Page and Progressive Era (2014) During the progressive era more women took work outside the home. For the working class this work was often as a domestic servant. Yet, working or not, women were expected to perform all the cooking and cleaning. This \\"affected female domestics' experiences of their homes, workplaces, and possessions, While the male household members, comforted by the smells of home cooking, fresh laundry, and soaped floors, would have seen home as a refuge from work, women would have associated these same smells with the labor that they expended to maintain order.\\" With increases in technology some of this work became easier. The \\"introduction of gas, indoor plumbing, electricity and garbage pickup had a significant impact on the homes and the women who were responsible for maintaining them.\\" With the introduction of new methods of heating and lighting the home allowed for use of space once used for storage to become living spaces. Women were targeted by advertisements for many different products once produced at home. These products were anything from mayonnaise, soda, or canned vegetables. The purity of food, milk and drinking water became a high priority in the cities. At the state and national levels new food and drug laws strengthened urban efforts to guarantee the safety of the food system. The 1906 federal Pure Food and Drug Act, which was pushed by drug companies and providers of medical services, removed from the market patent medicines that had never been scientifically tested.Marc T. Law, \\"The Origins of State Pure Food Regulation,\\" Journal of Economic History, Dec 2003, Vol. 63 Issue 4, pp. 1103‚Äì31 With the decrease in standard working hours, urban families had more leisure time. Many spent this leisure time at movie theaters. Progressives advocated for censorship of motion pictures as it was believed that patrons (especially children) viewing movies in dark, unclean, potentially unsafe theaters, might be negatively influenced in witnessing actors portraying crimes, violence, and sexually suggestive situations. Progressives across the country influenced municipal governments of large urban cities, to build numerous parks where it was believed that leisure time for children and families could be spent in a healthy, wholesome environment, thereby fostering good morals and citizenship.Black, Gregory D. Hollywood Censored: Morality Codes, Catholics, and the Movies. Cambridge University Press 1994 Labor policy and unions Labor unions, especially the American Federation of Labor (AFL), grew rapidly in the early 20th century, and had a Progressive agenda as well. After experimenting in the early 20th century with cooperation with business in the National Civic Federation, the AFL turned after 1906 to a working political alliance with the Democratic party. The alliance was especially important in the larger industrial cities. The unions wanted restrictions on judges who intervened in labor disputes, usually on the side of the employer. They finally achieved that goal with the Norris‚ÄìLa Guardia Act of 1932.Julie Greene, Pure and Simple Politics: The American Federation of Labor and Political Activism, 1881‚Äì1917 (1998) By the turn of the century, more and more small businesses were getting fed up with the way that they were treated compared to the bigger businesses. It seemed that the \\"Upper Ten\\" were turning a blind-eye to the smaller businesses, cutting corners wherever they could to make more profit. The big businesses would soon find out that the smaller businesses were starting to gain ground over them, so they became unsettled as described; \\"Constant pressure from the public, labor organizations, small business interests, and federal and state governments forced the corporate giants to engage in a balancing act.\\" Now that all of these new regulations and standards were being enacted, the big business would now have to stoop to everyone's level, including the small businesses. The big businesses would soon find out that in order to succeed they would have to band together with the smaller businesses to be successful, kind of a \\"Yin and Yang\\" effect. United States President William Howard Taft signed the 4 March 1913, bill (the last day of his presidency), establishing the Department of Labor as a Cabinet-level department, replacing the previous Department of Commerce and Labor. William B. Wilson was appointed as the first Secretary of Labor on 5 March 1913, by President Wilson.William Bauchop Wilson In October 1919, Secretary Wilson chaired the first meeting of the International Labour Organization even though the U.S. was not yet a member.Iga.ucdavis.edu In September 1916, the Federal Employees' Compensation Act introduced benefits to workers who are injured or contract illnesses in the workplace. The act established an agency responsible for federal workers' compensation, which was transferred to the Labor Department in the 1940s and has become known as the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs.Bls.gov Civil rights issues Women Across the nation, middle-class women organized on behalf of social reforms during the Progressive Era. Using the language of municipal housekeeping women were able to push such reforms as prohibition, women's suffrage, child-saving, and public health. Middle class women formed local clubs, which after 1890 were coordinated by the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC). Historian Paige Meltzer puts the GFWC in the context of the Progressive Movement, arguing that its policies: > built on Progressive-era strategies of municipal housekeeping. During the > Progressive era, female activists used traditional constructions of > womanhood, which imagined all women as mothers and homemakers, to justify > their entrance into community affairs: as \\"municipal housekeepers,\\" they > would clean up politics, cities, and see after the health and well being of > their neighbors. Donning the mantle of motherhood, female activists > methodically investigated their community's needs and used their \\"maternal\\" > expertise to lobby, create, and secure a place for themselves in an emerging > state welfare bureaucracy, best illustrated perhaps by clubwoman Julia > Lathrop's leadership in the Children's Bureau. As part of this tradition of > maternal activism, the Progressive-era General Federation supported a range > of causes from the pure food and drug administration to public health care > for mothers and children, to a ban on child labor, each of which looked to > the state to help implement their vision of social justice.Paige Meltzer, > \\"The Pulse and Conscience of America\\" The General Federation and Women's > Citizenship, 1945‚Äì1960,\\" Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies (2009), Vol. > 30 Issue 3, pp. 52‚Äì76. online Women during the Progressive Era were often unhappy and faked enjoyment in their married heterosexual relationships. Middle class women known for calling out change, specifically in cities like New York City, questioned the rethinking of marriage and sexuality. Women craved more sexual freedom following the sexually repressive and restrictive Victorian Era. Dating in relationships became a new way of courting during the Progressive Era and moved the United States into a more romantic way of viewing marriage and relationships. Within more engagements and marriages, both parties would exchange love notes as a way to express their sexual feelings. The divide between aggressive passionate love associated usually with men and a women's more spiritual romantic love became apparent in the middle-class as women were judged on how they should be respected based on how they expressed these feelings. So, frequently women expressed passionless emotions towards love as a way to establish status among men in the middle class. Women's Suffrage \\"The Awakening\\": Suffragists were successful in the West; their torch awakens the women struggling in the East and South in this cartoon by Hy Mayer in Puck 20 Feb. 1915. The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) was an American women's rights organization formed in May 1890 as a unification of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). The NAWSA set up hundreds of smaller local and state groups, with the goal of passing woman suffrage legislation at the state and local level. The NAWSA was the largest and most important suffrage organization in the United States, and was the primary promoter of women's right to vote. Carrie Chapman Catt was the key leader in the early 20th century. Like AWSA and NWSA before it, the NAWSA pushed for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing women's voting rights, and was instrumental in winning the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920.Eleanor Flexner, Century of Struggle (1959), pp. 208‚Äì17.Corrine M. McConnaughy, The Woman Suffrage Movement in America: A Reassessment (2013). A breakaway group, the National Woman's Party, tightly controlled by Alice Paul, used civil disobedience to gain publicity and force passage of suffrage. Paul's members chained themselves to the White House fence in order to get arrested, then went on hunger strikes to gain publicity. While the British suffragettes stopped their protests in 1914 and supported the British war effort, Paul began her campaign in 1917 and was widely criticized for ignoring the war and attracting radical anti-war elements.Nancy F. Cott, The Grounding of Modern Feminism (1989) pp. 51‚Äì82 Race relations Across the South, black communities developed their own Progressive reform projects.John Dittmer, Black Georgia in the Progressive era, 1900‚Äì1920 (1980).David W. Southern, The Progressive Era and Race: Reaction and Reform, 1900‚Äì1917 (2005) Typical projects involved upgrading schools, modernizing church operations, expanding business opportunities, fighting for a larger share of state budgets, and engaging in legal action to secure equal rights.Angela Jones, African American Civil Rights: Early Activism and the Niagara Movement (2011) online Reform projects were especially notable in rural areas, where the great majority of Southern blacks lived.Debra Reid, \\"Rural African Americans and Progressive Reform,\\" Agricultural History (2000) 74#2 pp. 322‚Äì41 on Texas. Rural blacks were heavily involved in environmental issues, in which they developed their own traditions and priorities.Dianne D. Glave, \\"'A Garden so Brilliant With Colors, so Original in its Design': Rural African American Women, Gardening, Progressive Reform, and the Foundation of an African American Environmental Perspective.\\" Environmental History 8#3 (2003): 395‚Äì411.Dianne D. Glave and Mark Stoll, eds., To Love the Wind and the Rain': African Americans and Environmental History. (2006). George Washington Carver (1860‚Äì1943) was a leader in promoting environmentalism, and was well known for his research projects, particularly those involving agriculture.Mark D. Hersey, My Work Is That of Conservation: An Environmental Biography of George Washington Carver (2011) online Although there were some achievements that improved conditions for African Americans and other non-white minorities, the Progressive Era was the nadir of American race relations. While white Progressives in principle believed in improving conditions for minority groups, there were wide differences in how this was to be achieved. Some, such as Lillian Wald, fought to alleviate the plight of poor African Americans. Many, though, were concerned with enforcing, not eradicating, racial segregation. In particular, the mixing of black and white pleasure-seekers in \\"black-and-tan\\" clubs troubled Progressive reformers. The Progressive ideology espoused by many of the era attempted to correct societal problems created by racial integration following the Civil War by segregating the races and allowing each group to achieve its own potential. That is to say that most Progressives saw racial integration as a problem to be solved, rather than a goal to be achieved. As white progressives sought to help the white working- class, clean-up politics, and improve the cities, the country instated the system of racial segregation known as Jim Crow. One of the most impacting issues African Americans had to face during the Progressive Era was the right to vote. By the beginning of the 20th century, African Americans were \\"disfranchised\\", while in the years prior to this, the right to vote was guaranteed to \\"freedmen\\" through the Civil Rights Act of 1870. Southern whites wanted to rid of the political influence of the black vote, citing \\"that black voting meant only corruption of elections, incompetence of government, and the engendering of fierce racial antagonisms.\\" Progressive whites found a \\"loophole\\" to the 15th Amendment's prohibition of denying one the right to vote due to race through the Grandfather Clause. This allowed for the creation of \\"tests\\" that would essentially be designed in a way that would allow for whites to pass them but not African Americans or any other persons of color. Actions such as these from whites of the Progressive Era are some of the many that tied into the Progressive goal, as historian Michael McGerr states, \\"to segregate society.\\" Legal historian Herbert Hovenkamp argues that while many early progressives inherited the racism of Jim Crow, as they begin to innovate their own ideas, they would embrace behaviorism, cultural relativism and marginalism which stress environmental influences on humans rather than biological inheritance. He states that ultimately progressives \\"were responsible for bringing scientific racism to an end\\".Hovenkamp, H. 2017 The Progressives: Racism and Public Law Public Law and Legal Theory Research Paper Series, 59 Ariz. L. Rev. 947 Key political reform efforts Democracy Many Progressives sought to enable the citizenry to rule more directly and circumvent machines, bosses and professional politicians. The institution of the initiative and referendums made it possible to pass laws without the involvement of the legislature, while the recall allowed for the removal of corrupt or under-performing officials, and the direct primary let people democratically nominate candidates, avoiding the professionally dominated conventions. Thanks to the efforts of Oregon State Representative William S. U'Ren and his Direct Legislation League, voters in Oregon overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure in 1902 that created the initiative and referendum processes for citizens to directly introduce or approve proposed laws or amendments to the state constitution, making Oregon the first state to adopt such a system. U'Ren also helped in the passage of an amendment in 1908 that gave voters power to recall elected officials, and would go on to establish, at the state level, popular election of U.S. Senators and the first presidential primary in the United States. In 1911, California governor Hiram Johnson established the Oregon System of \\"Initiative, Referendum, and Recall\\" in his state, viewing them as good influences for citizen participation against the historic influence of large corporations on state lawmakers.John M. Allswang, The initiative and referendum in California, 1898‚Äì1998, (2000) ch 1 These Progressive reforms were soon replicated in other states, including Idaho, Washington, and Wisconsin, and today roughly half of U.S. states have initiative, referendum and recall provisions in their state constitutions. About 16 states began using primary elections to reduce the power of bosses and machines.Alan Ware, The American direct primary: party institutionalization and transformation (2002) The Seventeenth Amendment was ratified in 1913, requiring that all senators be elected by the people (they were formerly appointed by state legislatures). The main motivation was to reduce the power of political bosses, who controlled the Senate seats by virtue of their control of state legislatures. The result, according to political scientist Henry Jones Ford, was that the United States Senate had become a \\"Diet of party lords, wielding their power without scruple or restraint, on behalf of those particular interests\\" that put them in office.Christopher Hoebeke, The road to mass democracy: original intent and the Seventeenth Amendment (1995) p. 18 Municipal reform A coalition of middle-class reform-oriented voters, academic experts, and reformers hostile to the political machines started forming in the 1890s and introduced a series of reforms in urban America, designed to reduce waste, inefficiency and corruption, by introducing scientific methods, compulsory education and administrative innovations. The pace was set in Detroit, Michigan, where Republican mayor Hazen S. Pingree first put together the reform coalition.Melvin G. Holli, Reform in Detroit: Hazen S. Pingree and Urban Politics (1969). Many cities set up municipal reference bureaus to study the budgets and administrative structures of local governments. Progressive mayors took the lead in many key cities,Kenneth Finegold, \\"Traditional Reform, Municipal Populism, and Progressivism,\\" Urban Affairs Review, (1995) 31#1 pp 20‚Äì42 such as Cleveland, Ohio (especially Mayor Tom Johnson); Toledo, Ohio;Arthur E.

In Illinois, Governor Frank Lowden undertook a major reorganization of state government.William Thomas Hutchinson, Lowden of Illinois: the life of Frank O. Lowden (1957) vol 2 In Wisconsin, the stronghold of Robert La Follette, the Wisconsin Idea used the state university as a major source of ideas and expertise. Rural reform As late as 1920, half the population lived in rural areas. They experienced their own progressive reforms, typically with the explicit goal of upgrading country life.William L. Bowers, \\"Country-Life Reform, 1900‚Äì1920: A Neglected Aspect of Progressive Era History.\\" Agricultural History 45#3 (1971): 211‚Äì21. By 1910 most farmers subscribed to a farm newspaper, where editors promoted efficiency as applied to farming.Stuart W. Shulman, \\"The Progressive Era Farm Press,\\" Journalism History (1999) 25#1 pp. 27‚Äì36. Special efforts were made to reach the rural South and remote areas, such as the mountains of Appalachia and the Ozarks.William A. Link, A Hard Country and a Lonely Place: Schooling, Society, and Reform in Rural Virginia, 1870‚Äì1920 (1986). The most urgent need was better transportation. The railroad system was virtually complete; the need was for much better roads. The traditional method of putting the burden on maintaining roads on local landowners was increasingly inadequate. New York State took the lead in 1898, and by 1916 the old system had been discarded in every area. Demands grew for local and state government to take charge. With the coming of the automobile after 1910, urgent efforts were made to upgrade and modernize dirt roads designed for horse-drawn wagon traffic. The American Association for Highway Improvement was organized in 1910. Funding came from automobile registration, and taxes on motor fuels, as well as state aid. In 1916, federal-aid was first made available to improve post-roads, and promote general commerce. Congress appropriated $75 million over a five-year period, with the Secretary of Agriculture in charge through the Bureau of Public Roads, in cooperation with the state highway departments. There were 2.4 million miles of rural dirt rural roads in 1914; 100,000 miles had been improved with grading and gravel, and 3000 miles were given high quality surfacing. The rapidly increasing speed of automobiles, and especially trucks, made maintenance and repair a high priority. Concrete was first used in 1933, and expanded until it became the dominant surfacing material in the 1930s.Harold U. Faulkner, The Decline of Laissez Faire, 1897‚Äì1917 (1951) pp. 233‚Äì36.Charles Lee Dearing, American highway policy (1942). The South had fewer cars and trucks and much less money, but it worked through highly visible demonstration projects like the \\"Dixie Highway.\\"Tammy Ingram, Dixie Highway: Road Building and the Making of the Modern South, 1900‚Äì1930 (2014). Rural schools were often poorly funded, one room operations. Typically, classes were taught by young local women before they married, with only occasional supervision by county superintendents. The progressive solution was modernization through consolidation, with the result of children attending modern schools. There they would be taught by full-time professional teachers who had graduated from the states' teachers colleges, were certified, and were monitored by the county superintendents. Farmers complained at the expense, and also at the loss of control over local affairs, but in state after state the consolidation process went forward.David R. Reynolds, There goes the neighborhood: Rural school consolidation at the grass roots in early twentieth-century Iowa (University of Iowa Press, 2002). Numerous other programs were aimed at rural youth, including 4-H clubs,Ellen Natasha Thompson, \\" The Changing Needs of Our Youth Today: The Response of 4-H to Social and Economic Transformations in Twentieth-century North Carolina.\\" (PhD Diss. University of North Carolina at Greensboro, 2012). online Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. County fairs not only gave prizes for the most productive agricultural practices, they also demonstrated those practices to an attentive rural audience. Programs for new mothers included maternity care and training in baby care.Marilyn Irvin Holt, Linoleum, Better Babies, and the Modern Farm Woman, 1890‚Äì1930 (1995). The movement's attempts at introducing urban reforms to rural America often met resistance from traditionalists who saw the country-lifers as aggressive modernizers who were condescending and out of touch with rural life. The traditionalists said many of their reforms were unnecessary and not worth the trouble of implementing. Rural residents also disagreed with the notion that farms needed to improve their efficiency, as they saw this goal as serving urban interests more than rural ones. The social conservatism of many rural residents also led them to resist attempts for change led by outsiders. Most important, the traditionalists did not want to become modern, and did not want their children inculcated with alien modern values through comprehensive schools that were remote from local control.Danbom 1979, p. 473.Richard Jensen and Mark Friedberger, Education and Social Structure: An Historical Study of Iowa, 1870‚Äì1930 (Chicago: Newberry Library, 1976, online). The most successful reforms came from the farmers who pursued agricultural extension, as their proposed changes were consistent with existing modernizing trends toward more efficiency and more profit in agriculture. Constitutional change The Progressives fixed some of their reforms into law by adding amendments 16, 17, 18, and 19 to the US Constitution. The 16th amendment made an income tax legal (this required an amendment due to Article One, Section 9 of the Constitution, which required that direct taxes be laid on the States in proportion to their population as determined by the decennial census). The Progressives also made strides in attempts to reduce political corruption through the 17th amendment (direct election of U.S. Senators). The most radical and controversial amendment came during the anti-German craze of World War I that helped the Progressives and others push through their plan for prohibition through the 18th amendment (once the Progressives fell out of power the 21st amendment repealed the 18th in 1933). The ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920, which recognized women's suffrage was the last amendment during the progressive era.David E. Kyvig, Explicit and authentic acts: amending the U.S. Constitution, 1776‚Äì1995 (1996) Another significant constitutional change that began during the progressive era was the incorporation of the Bill of Rights so that those rights would apply to the states. In 1920, Benjamin Gitlow was convicted under the Espionage Act of 1917 and the case went all the way to the Supreme Court, where the justices decided that the First Amendment applied to the states as well as the federal government. Prior to that time, the Bill of Rights was considered to apply only to the federal government, not the states. Government policy and roles Economic policy President Wilson used tariff, currency, and antitrust laws to prime the pump and get the economy working. The Progressive Era was one of general prosperity after the Panic of 1893‚Äîa severe depression‚Äîended in 1897. The Panic of 1907 was short and mostly affected financiers. However, Campbell (2005) stresses the weak points of the economy in 1907‚Äì1914, linking them to public demands for more Progressive interventions. The Panic of 1907 was followed by a small decline in real wages and increased unemployment, with both trends continuing until World War I. Campbell emphasizes the resulting stress on public finance and the impact on the Wilson administration's policies. The weakened economy and persistent federal deficits led to changes in fiscal policy, including the imposition of federal income taxes on businesses and individuals and the creation of the Federal Reserve System.Ballard Campbell, \\"Economic Causes of Progressivism,\\" Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era, Jan 2005, Vol. 4 Issue 1, pp. 7‚Äì22 Government agencies were also transformed in an effort to improve administrative efficiency.Harold U. Faulkner, The Decline of Laissez Faire, 1897‚Äì1917 (1951) In the Gilded Age (late 19th century) the parties were reluctant to involve the federal government too heavily in the private sector, except in the area of railroads and tariffs. In general, they accepted the concept of laissez-faire, a doctrine opposing government interference in the economy except to maintain law and order. This attitude started to change during the depression of the 1890s when small business, farm, and labor movements began asking the government to intercede on their behalf. By the start of the 20th century, a middle class had developed that was leery of both the business elite and the radical political movements of farmers and laborers in the Midwest and West. The Progressives argued the need for government regulation of business practices to ensure competition and free enterprise. Congress enacted a law regulating railroads in 1887 (the Interstate Commerce Act), and one preventing large firms from controlling a single industry in 1890 (the Sherman Antitrust Act). These laws were not rigorously enforced, however, until the years between 1900 and 1920, when Republican President Theodore Roosevelt (1901‚Äì1909), Democratic President Woodrow Wilson (1913‚Äì1921), and others sympathetic to the views of the Progressives came to power. Many of today's U.S. regulatory agencies were created during these years, including the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. Muckrakers were journalists who encouraged readers to demand more regulation of business. Upton Sinclair's The Jungle (1906) was influential and persuaded America about the supposed horrors of the Chicago Union Stock Yards, a giant complex of meat processing plants that developed in the 1870s. The federal government responded to Sinclair's book and the Neill‚ÄìReynolds Report with the new regulatory Food and Drug Administration. Ida M. Tarbell wrote a series of articles against Standard Oil, which was perceived to be a monopoly. This affected both the government and the public reformers. Attacks by Tarbell and others helped pave the way for public acceptance of the breakup of the company by the Supreme Court in 1911. When Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected President with a Democratic Congress in 1912 he implemented a series of Progressive policies in economics. In 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified, and a small income tax was imposed on higher incomes. The Democrats lowered tariffs with the Underwood Tariff in 1913, though its effects were overwhelmed by the changes in trade caused by the World War that broke out in 1914. Wilson proved especially effective in mobilizing public opinion behind tariff changes by denouncing corporate lobbyists, addressing Congress in person in highly dramatic fashion, and staging an elaborate ceremony when he signed the bill into law.Vincent W. Howard, \\"Woodrow Wilson, The Press, and Presidential Leadership: Another Look at the Passage of the Underwood Tariff, 1913,\\" CR: The Centennial Review, 1980, Vol. 24 Issue 2, pp. 167‚Äì14 Wilson helped end the long battles over the trusts with the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914. He managed to convince lawmakers on the issues of money and banking by the creation in 1913 of the Federal Reserve System, a complex business- government partnership that to this day dominates the financial world.Arthur S. Link, Woodrow Wilson and the progressive Era, 1910‚Äì1917 (1954) pp. 25‚Äì80 In 1913, Henry Ford dramatically increased the efficiency of his factories by large-scale use of the moving assembly line, with each worker doing one simple task in the production of automobiles. Emphasizing efficiency, Ford more than doubled wages (and cut hours from 9 a day to 8), attracting the best workers and sharply reducing labor turnover and absenteeism. His employees could and did buy his cars, and by cutting prices over and over he made the Model T cheap enough for millions of people to buy in the U.S. and in every major country. Ford's profits soared and his company dominated the world's automobile industry. Henry Ford became the world-famous prophet of high wages and high profits. A study was conducted by Robert and Helen Lynd on American society as the need and want for cars was increasing and were made affordable to Americans. They published a book titled \\"Middletown\\" in 1929. In this study they found how the automobile impacted American families. Budgets changed dramatically and the automobile has revolutionized how people spent their free time. Immigration policy The influx of immigration grew steadily after 1896, with most new arrivals being unskilled workers from southern and eastern Europe. These immigrants were able to find work in the steel mills, slaughterhouses, fishing industry, and construction crews of the emergent mill towns and industrial cities mostly in the Northeast, Midwest, and West Coast. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 halted most transcontinental immigration, only after 1919 did the flow of immigrants resume. Starting in the 1880s, the labor unions aggressively promoted restrictions on immigration, especially restrictions on Chinese, Japanese and Korean immigrants.Robert D. Parmet, Labor and immigration in industrial America (1987) p. 146 In combination with the racist attitudes of the time, there was a fear that large numbers of unskilled, low-paid workers would defeat the union's efforts to raise wages through collective bargaining.Gwendolyn Mink, Old Labor and New Immigrants in American Political Development: Union, Party and State, 1875‚Äì1920 (1990) In addition, rural Protestants distrusted the urban Catholics and Jews who comprised most of the Southern and Eastern European immigrants, and on those grounds opposed immigration.Daniel J. Tichenor, Dividing lines: the politics of immigration control in America (2002) p. 71 On the other hand, the rapid growth of the industry called for a greater and expanding labor pool that could not be met by natural birth rates. As a result, many large corporations were opposed to immigration restrictions. By the early 1920s, a consensus had been reached that the total influx of immigration had to be restricted, and a series of laws in the 1920s accomplished that purpose.Claudia Goldin, \\"The Political Economy of Immigration Restriction in the United States, 1890 to 1921,\\" in Goldin, The regulated economy (1994) ch 7 A handful of eugenics advocates were also involved in immigration restriction for their own pseudo- scientific reasons.Thomas C. Leonard, \\"Retrospectives: Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era\\" Journal of Economic Perspectives, (2005) 19(4): 207‚Äì24 Immigration restriction continued to be a national policy until after World War II. During World War I, the Progressives strongly promoted Americanization programs, designed to modernize the recent immigrants and turn them into model American citizens, while diminishing loyalties to the old country.James R. Barrett, \\"Americanization from the Bottom, Up: Immigration and the Remaking of the American Working Class, 1880‚Äì1930,\\" Journal of American History 79 (December 1992): 996‚Äì1020. These programs often operated through the public school system, which expanded dramatically.Christina A. Ziegler-McPherson, Americanization in the States: Immigrant Social Welfare Policy, Citizenship, and National Identity in the United States, 1908‚Äì1929 (2009)  Foreign policy  Progressives looked to legal arbitration as an alternative to warfare. The two leading proponents were Taft, a constitutional lawyer who later became Chief Justice, and Democratic leaders William Jennings Bryan. Taft's political base was the conservative business community which largely supported peace movements before 1914. The businessmen believed that economic rivalries were cause of war, and that extensive trade led to an interdependent world that would make war a very expensive and useless anachronism. One early success came in the Newfoundland fisheries dispute between the United States and Britain in 1910. In 1911 Taft's diplomats signed wide-ranging arbitration treaties with France and Britain. However he was defeated by former President Theodore Roosevelt, who had broken with his prot√©g√© Taft in 1910. They were dueling for control of the Republican Party and Roosevelt encouraged the Senate to impose amendments that significantly weakened the treaties. On the one hand, Roosevelt was acting to sabotage Taft's campaign promises.E. James Hindman, \\"The General Arbitration Treaties of William Howard Taft.\\" Historian 36.1 (1973): 52‚Äì65. online At a deeper level, Roosevelt truly believed that arbitration was a na√Øve solution and the great issues had to be decided by warfare. The Roosevelt in approach incorporated a near-mystical faith of the ennobling nature of war. It endorsed jingoistic nationalism as opposed to the businessmen's calculation of profit and national interest. Foreign policy in the progressive era was often marked by a tone of moral supremacy. Woodrow Wilson and William Jennings Bryan both saw themselves as 'Missionaries of Democracy', with the deliberate religious overtone. Historian Arthur S. Link says they felt they were, \\"Inspired by the confidence that they knew better how to promote the peace and well-being of other countries than did the leaders of those countries themselves.\\" Similar ideas and language had already been used previously in the Monroe Doctrine, wherein Roosevelt claimed that the United States could serve as the police of the world, using its power to end unrest and wrongdoing on the western hemisphere. Using this moralistic approach, Roosevelt argued for intervention with Cuba to help it to become a \\"just and stable civilization\\", by way of the Platt amendment. Wilson used a similar moralistic tone when dealing with Mexico. In 1913, while revolutionaries took control of the government, Wilson judged them to be immoral, and refused to acknowledge the in-place government on that reason alone. Overseas possessions: the Philippines The Philippines were acquired by the United States in 1899, after victory over Spanish forces at the Battle of Manila Bay and a long series of controversial political debates between the senate and President McKinley and was considered the largest colonial acquisition by the United States at this time. While anti-imperialist sentiments had been prevalent in the United States during this time, the acquisition of the Philippines sparked the relatively minor population into action. Voicing their opinions in public, they sought to deter American leaders from keeping the Asian-Pacific nation and to avoid the temptations of expansionist tendencies that were widely viewed as \\"un-American\\" at that time. Philippines was a major target for the progressive reformers. A 1907 report to Secretary of War Taft provided a summary of what the American civil administration had achieved. It included, in addition to the rapid building of a public school system based on English teaching, and boasted about such modernizing achievements as: > steel and concrete wharves at the newly renovated Port of Manila; dredging > the River Pasig; streamlining of the Insular Government; accurate, > intelligible accounting; the construction of a telegraph and cable > communications network; the establishment of a postal savings bank; large- > scale road-and bridge-building; impartial and incorrupt policing; well- > financed civil engineering; the conservation of old Spanish architecture; > large public parks; a bidding process for the right to build railways; > Corporation law; and a coastal and geological survey.Andrew Roberts, A > History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900 (2008), p 26. In 1903 the American reformers in the Philippines passed two major land acts designed to turn landless peasants into owners of their farms. By 1905 the law was clearly a failure. Reformers such as Taft believed landownership would turn unruly agrarians into loyal subjects. The social structure in rural Philippines was highly traditional and highly unequal. Drastic changes in land ownership posed a major challenge to local elites, who would not accept it, nor would their peasant clients. The American reformers blamed peasant resistance to landownership for the law's failure and argued that large plantations and sharecropping was the Philippines' best path to development.Theresa Ventura, \\"From Small Farms to Progressive Plantations: The Trajectory of Land Reform in the American Colonial Philippines, 1900‚Äì1916.\\" Agricultural History 90#4 (2016): 459‚Äì483. Elite Filipina women played a major role in the reform movement, especially on health issues. They specialized on such urgent needs as infant care and maternal and child health, the distribution of pure milk and teaching new mothers about children's health. The most prominent organizations were the La Protecci√≥n de la Infancia, and the National Federation of Women's Clubs.Mina Roces, \\"Filipino Elite Women and Public Health in the American Colonial Era, 1906‚Äì1940.\\" Women's History Review 26#3 (2017): 477‚Äì502. Peace movement Although the Progressive Era was characterized by public support for World War I under Woodrow Wilson, there was also a substantial opposition to World War II. Societal reforms Eugenics Some Progressives sponsored eugenics as a solution to excessively large or underperforming families, hoping that birth control would enable parents to focus their resources on fewer, better children.Leonard, Thomas C. (2005) Retrospectives: Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era Journal of Economic Perspectives, 19(4): 207‚Äì24 Progressive leaders like Herbert Croly and Walter Lippmann indicated their classically liberal concern over the danger posed to the individual by the practice of eugenics.Nancy Cohen, The reconstruction of American liberalism, 1865‚Äì1914 (2002) p. 243 The Catholics strongly opposed birth control proposals such as eugenics.Celeste Michelle Condit, The meanings of the gene: public debates about human heredity (1999) p. 51 Prohibition Prohibition was the outlawing of the manufacture, sale and transport of alcohol. Drinking itself was never prohibited. Throughout the Progressive Era, it remained one of the prominent causes associated with Progressivism at the local, state and national level, though support across the full breadth of Progressives was mixed. It pitted the minority urban Catholic population against the larger rural Protestant element, and Progressivism's rise in the rural communities was aided in part by the general increase in public consciousness of social issues of the temperance movement, which achieved national success with the passage of the 18th Amendment by Congress in late 1917, and the ratification by three-fourths of the states in 1919. Prohibition was backed by the Methodists, Baptists, Congregationalists, Scandinavian Lutherans and other evangelical churches. Activists were mobilized by the highly effective Anti- Saloon League.K. Austin Kerr, Organized for Prohibition: A New History of the Anti-Saloon League (1985). Timberlake (1963) argues the dries sought to break the liquor trust, weaken the saloon base of big-city machines, enhance industrial efficiency, and reduce the level of wife beating, child abuse, and poverty caused by alcoholism.James Timberlake, Prohibition and the Progressive Movement, 1900‚Äì1920 (Harvard UP, 1963) Agitation for prohibition began during the Second Great Awakening in the 1840s when crusades against drinking originated from evangelical Protestants.Jack S. Blocker, American Temperance Movements: Cycles of Reform (1989) Evangelicals precipitated the second wave of prohibition legislation during the 1880s, which had as its aim local and state prohibition. During the 1880s, referendums were held at the state level to enact prohibition amendments. Two important groups were formed during this period. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was formed in 1874.Jed Dannenbaum, Drink and Disorder: Temperance Reform in Cincinnati from the Washingtonian Revival to the WCTU (1984) The Anti-Saloon League which began in Ohio was formed in 1893, uniting activists from different religious groups.Kerr, Organized for Prohibition: A New History of the Anti-Saloon League (1985) The league, rooted in Protestant churches, envisioned nationwide prohibition. Rather than condemn all drinking, the group focused attention on the saloon which was considered the ultimate symbol of public vice. The league also concentrated on campaigns for the right of individual communities to choose whether to close their saloons. In 1907, Georgia and Alabama were the first states to go dry followed by Oklahoma, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee in the following years. In 1913, Congress passed the Webb-Kenyon Act, which forbade the transport of liquor into dry states. By 1917, two- thirds of the states had some form of prohibition laws and roughly three- quarters of the population lived in dry areas. In 1913, the Anti-Saloon League first publicly appealed for a prohibition amendment. They preferred a constitutional amendment over a federal statute because although harder to achieve, they felt it would be harder to change. As the United States entered World War I, the Conscription Act banned the sale of liquor near military bases.S.J. Mennell, \\"Prohibition: A Sociological View,\\" Journal of American Studies 3, no. 2 (1969): 159‚Äì75. In August 1917, the Lever Food and Fuel Control Act banned production of distilled spirits for the duration of the war. The War Prohibition Act, November, 1918, forbade the manufacture and sale of intoxicating beverages (more than 2.75% alcohol content) until the end of demobilization. The drys worked energetically to secure two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress and the support of three-quarters of the states needed for an amendment to the federal constitution. Thirty-six states were needed, and organizations were set up at all 48 states to seek ratification. In late 1917, Congress passed the Eighteenth Amendment; it was ratified in 1919 and took effect in January 1920. It prohibited the manufacturing, sale or transport of intoxicating beverages within the United States, as well as import and export. The Volstead Act, 1919, defined intoxicating as having alcohol content greater than 0.5% and established the procedures for federal enforcement of the Act. The states were at liberty to enforce prohibition or not, and most did not try.David E. Kyvig,Repealing National Prohibition (2000) Consumer demand, however, led to a variety of illegal sources for alcohol, especially illegal distilleries and smuggling from Canada and other countries. It is difficult to determine the level of compliance, and although the media at the time portrayed the law as highly ineffective, even if it did not eradicate the use of alcohol, it certainly decreased alcohol consumption during the period. The Eighteenth Amendment was repealed in 1933, with the passage of the Twenty-First Amendment, thanks to a well-organized repeal campaign led by Catholics (who stressed personal liberty) and businessmen (who stressed the lost tax revenue). Prohibition also brought a rise to organized crime, who was able to profit off the sales of illegal alcohol. Al Capone was one of the most well-known criminals to partake in illegal alcohol sales. There was a huge demand for alcohol, but most business owners were unwilling to risk getting involved in the transportation of alcohol. The business owners did however have little issue with selling the alcohol that the criminals like Capone provided.Johnson, Earl. 1962. \\"Organized Crime: Challenge to the American.\\" Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 53 (4): 399‚Äì425. Organized Crime was able to be successful due to their willingness to use intimidation and violence to carry out their illicit enterprises. During prohibition, the mafia was able to grow their stronghold on illegal activities throughout the United States. This illegal behavior began almost in conjunction with prohibition being voted into law. Within the first hours of prohibition, the police in Chicago reported the theft of medicinal liquor.Sandbrook, Dominic. 2012. How Prohibition backfired and gave America an era of gangsters and speakeasies. 25 August. Accessed 11 February 2019. https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/26/lawless-prohibition-gangsters- speakeasies. The prohibition era gangsters outlasted the law and used it as a starting point to launch their criminal enterprises. Education The reform of schools and other educational institutions was one of the prime concerns of the middle class during this time period. The number of schools in the nation increased dramatically, as did the need for a better more-rounded education system. The face of the Progressive Education Movement in America was John Dewey, a professor at the University of Chicago (1896‚Äì1904) who advocated for schools to incorporate everyday skills instead of only teaching academic content. Dewey felt the younger generation was losing the opportunity to learn the art of democratic participation and in turn wrote many novels such as The Child and the Curriculum and Schools of tomorrow. A higher level of education also gained popularity. By 1930, 12.4% of 18 to 21-year-olds were attending college, whereas in 1890 only about 3% of this demographic had an interest in higher learning. Women's education in home economics A new field of study, the art and science of homemaking, emerged in the Progressive Era in an effort to feminize women's education in the United States. Home economics emerged at the end of the nineteenth century in response to the many changes occurring both at the level of material culture and practices and in the more abstract realm of gender ideology and thinking about the home. As the industrial revolution took hold of the American economy and as mass production, alienation, and urbanization appeared to be unstoppable trends, Americans looked for solutions that could soften the effects of change without slowing down the engines of progress. Alternatively called home arts, the major curriculum reform in women's education was influenced by the publication of Treatise on Domestic Economy, written by Catherine Beecher in 1843. Advocates of home economics argued that homemaking, as a profession, required education and training for the development of an efficient and systematic domestic practice. The curriculum aimed to cover a variety of topics, including teaching a standardized ways of gardening, child-rearing, cooking, cleaning, performing household maintenance, and doctoring. Such scientific management applied to the domestic sphere was presented as a solution to the dilemma and the black middle-class women faced in terms of searching for meaning and fulfillment in their role of housekeeping. The feminist perspective, by pushing for this type of education, intended to explain that women had separate but equally important responsibilities in life with men that required proper training. Children and education There was a concern towards working-class children being taken out of school to be put straight to work. Progressives around the country put up campaigns to push for an improvement in public education and to make education mandatory. It was further pushed in the South, where education was very much behind compared to the rest of the country. The Southern Education Board came together to publicize the importance of reform. However, many rejected the reform. Farmers and workers relied heavily on their eldest children, their first born, to work and help the family's income. Immigrants were not for reform either, fearing that such a thing would Americanize their children. Despite those fighting against reform, there was a positive outcome to the fight for reform. Enrollment for children (age 5 to 19) in school rose from 50.5 percent to 59.2 between 1900 and 1909. Enrollment in public secondary school went from 519,000 to 841,000. School funds and the term of public schools also grew. Medicine and law The Flexner Report of 1910, sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation, professionalized American medicine by discarding the scores of local small medical schools and focusing national funds, resources, and prestige on larger, professionalized medical schools associated with universities.Abraham Flexner, Flexner Report on Medical Education in the United States and Canada 1910 (new edition 1960)Lawrence Friedman and Mark McGarvie, Charity, philanthropy, and civility in American history (2003) p. 231 Prominent leaders included the Mayo Brothers whose Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, became world-famous for innovative surgery.W. Bruce Fye, \\"The Origins and Evolution of the Mayo Clinic from 1864 to 1939: A Minnesota Family Practice Becomes an International 'Medical Mecca'\\", Bulletin of the History of Medicine Volume 84, Number 3, Fall 2010 pp. 323‚Äì57 in Project MUSE In the legal profession, the American Bar Association set up in 1900 the Association of American Law Schools (AALS). It established national standards for law schools, which led to the replacement of the old system of young men studying law privately with established lawyers by the new system of accredited law schools associated with universities.Steven J. Diner, A Very Different Age: Americans of the Progressive Era (1998) p. 186 Social sciences Progressive scholars, based at the emerging research universities such as Harvard, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, Chicago, Michigan, Wisconsin and California, worked to modernize their disciplines. The heyday of the amateur expert gave way to the research professor who published in the new scholarly journals and presses. Their explicit goal was to professionalize and make \\"scientific\\" the social sciences, especially history,Richard Hofstadter, The Progressive Historians: Turner, Beard, Parrington (1968) economics,Joseph Dorfman, The economic mind in American civilization, 1918‚Äì1933 vol 3, 1969 and political science.Barry Karl, Charles E. Merriam and the Study of Politics (1975) Professionalization meant creating new career tracks in the universities, with hiring and promotion dependent on meeting international models of scholarship. Decline In the 1940s typically historians saw the Progressive Era as a prelude to the New Deal and dated it from 1901 (when Roosevelt became president) to the start of World War I in 1914 or 1917.Eric Goldman, Rendezvous with Destiny: A History of Modern American Reform (1952) Historians have moved back in time emphasizing the Progressive reformers at the municipalMelvin G. Holli, Reform in Detroit: Hazen S. Pingree and Urban Politics (1969) and stateDavid P. Thelen, The New Citizenship: Origins of Progressivism in Wisconsin, 1885‚Äì1900 (1972) levels in the 1890s. End of the Era Much less settled is the question of when the era ended. Some historians who emphasize civil liberties decry their suppression during World War I and do not consider the war as rooted in Progressive policy.Paul L. Murphy, \\"World War I and the Origin of Civil Liberties in the United States\\" (1979) A strong anti-war movement headed by noted Progressives including Jane Addams, was suppressed after Wilson's 1916 re-election, a victory largely enabled by his campaign slogan, \\"He kept us out of the war.\\"Jane Addams, Bread and Peace in Time of War (1922) The slogan was no longer accurate by 6 April of the following year, when Wilson surprised much of the Progressive base that twice elected him and asked a joint session of Congress to declare war on Germany. The Senate voted 82‚Äì6 in favor; the House agreed, 373‚Äì50. Some historians see the so-called \\"war to end all wars\\" as a globalized expression of the American Progressive movement, with Wilson's support for a League of Nations as its climax.John Milton Cooper, Breaking the Heart of the World: Woodrow Wilson and the Fight for the League of Nations (2010) The politics of the 1920s was unfriendly toward the labor unions and liberal crusaders against business, so many if not most historians who emphasize those themes write off the decade. Urban cosmopolitan scholars recoiled at the moralism of prohibition, the intolerance of the nativists and the KKK, and on those grounds denounced the era. Richard Hofstadter, for example, in 1955 wrote that prohibition, \\"was a pseudo-reform, a pinched, parochial substitute for reform\\" that \\"was carried about America by the rural-evangelical virus\\".Richard Hofstadter, The Age of Reform (1955) p. 287 However, as Arthur S. Link emphasized, the Progressives did not simply roll over and play dead.Arthur S. Link, \\"What Happened to the Progressive Movement in the 1920s?,\\" American Historical Review Vol. 64, No. 4 (Jul., 1959), pp. 833‚Äì51 Link's argument for continuity through the twenties stimulated a historiography that found Progressivism to be a potent force. Palmer, pointing to leaders like George Norris, says, \\"It is worth noting that progressivism, whilst temporarily losing the political initiative, remained popular in many western states and made its presence felt in Washington during both the Harding and Coolidge presidencies.\\"Niall A. Palmer, The Twenties in America: Politics and History (2006) p. 176 Gerster and Cords argue that, \\"Since progressivism was a 'spirit' or an 'enthusiasm' rather than an easily definable force with common goals, it seems more accurate to argue that it produced a climate for reform which lasted well into the 1920s, if not beyond.\\"Patrick Gerster and Nicholas Cords, Myth in American History (1977) p. 203 Some social historians have posited that the KKK may in fact fit into the Progressive agenda, if Klansmen are portrayed as \\"ordinary white Protestants\\" primarily interested in purification of the system, which had long been a core Progressive goal.Stanley Coben, \\"Ordinary white Protestants: The KKK of the 1920s,\\" Journal of Social History, (1994) 28#1 pp. 155‚Äì65 This however ignores the violence and racism central to Klan ideology and activities, that had nothing to do with improving society, so much as enforcing racial hierarchies. While some Progressive leaders became reactionaries, that usually happened in the 1930s, not in the 1920s, as exemplified by William Randolph Hearst,Rodney P. Carlisle, Hearst and the New Deal: The Progressive as Reactionary (1979) Herbert Hoover, Al Smith and Henry Ford.  First Red Scare  Following the period rapid social change saw a worker's uprising turn to a full scale revolution in Russia in 1917 taken over by Bolsheviks along anarchist bombings of 1919 by foreigners encroached a large fear over many citizens of a possible Bolshevism revolt to overthrow values which the United States holds up to mainly capitalism. It saw persecutions of many ideals of the progressive era seeing raids, arrests, and persecutions taken place. Such as the period saw supporters such as worker unions, socialist, and others faced similar prosecutions. Along these convicted were foreigners, African Americans, Jews, Catholics, etc. The US government was also affected both legally and internally as of January 1920 saw 6,000 arrests of persecutions along changes in government policies where the government enacted censorship in the media and suppressing opinion on the matter going as far to use physical assaults or legal arrests having certain civil liberties stripped. Business progressivism in 1920s What historians have identified as \\"business progressivism\\", with its emphasis on efficiency and typified by Henry Ford and Herbert HooverBarry C. Edwards, \\"Putting Hoover on the Map: Was the 31st President a Progressive. Congress & the Presidency 41#1 (2014) pp 49‚Äì83 online reached an apogee in the 1920s. Wik, for example, argues that Ford's \\"views on technology and the mechanization of rural America were generally enlightened, progressive, and often far ahead of his times.\\"Reynold M. Wik, \\"Henry Ford's Science and Technology for Rural America,\\" Technology & Culture, July 1962, Vol. 3 Issue 3, pp. 247‚Äì57 Tindall stresses the continuing importance of the Progressive movement in the South in the 1920s involving increased democracy, efficient government, corporate regulation, social justice, and governmental public service.George B. Tindall, \\"Business Progressivism: Southern Politics in the Twenties,\\" South Atlantic Quarterly 62 (Winter 1963): 92‚Äì106.George B.

Link, The Paradox of Southern Progressivism, 1880‚Äì1930 (1997) p. 294 Likewise it was influential in the Midwest.Judith Sealander, Grand Plans: Business Progressivism and Social Change in Ohio's Miami Valley, 1890‚Äì1929 (1991) Historians of women and of youth emphasize the strength of the Progressive impulse in the 1920s.Maureen A. Flanagan, America Reformed: Progressives and Progressivisms, 1890s‚Äì1920s (2006) Women consolidated their gains after the success of the suffrage movement, and moved into causes such as world peace,Susan Zeiger, \\"Finding a cure for war: Women's politics and the peace movement in the 1920s,\\" Journal of Social History, Fall 1990, Vol. 24 Issue 1, pp. 69‚Äì86 good government, maternal care (the Sheppard‚ÄìTowner Act of 1921),J.

Paul Fass, speaking of youth, says \\"Progressivism as an angle of vision, as an optimistic approach to social problems, was very much alive.\\"Paula S. Fass, The damned and the beautiful: American youth in the 1920s (1977) p. 30 International influences that sparked many reform ideas likewise continued into the 1920s, as American ideas of modernity began to influence Europe.Daniel T. Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (2000) ch 9 By 1930 a block of progressive Republicans in the Senate were urging Hoover to take more vigorous action to fight the depression. There were about a dozen members of this group, including William Borah of Idaho, George W. Norris of Nebraska, Robert M. La Follette Jr., of Wisconsin, Gerald Nye of North Dakota, Hiram Johnson of California and Bronson M. Cutting of New Mexico. While these western Republicans could stir up issues, they could rarely forge a majority, since they were too individualistic and did not form a unified caucus. Hoover himself had sharply moved to the right, and paid little attention to their liberal ideas.Edwards, \\"Putting Hoover on the Map: Was the 31st President a Progressive p 60. By 1932 this group was moving toward support for Roosevelt's New Deal. They remained staunch isolationists deeply opposed to any involvement in Europe. Outside the Senate, however, a strong majority of the surviving Progressives from the 1910s had become conservative opponents of New Deal economic planning.Otis L.

The iiwi is a highly recognizable symbol of Hawaii. The iiwi is the third most common native land bird in the Hawaiian Islands.  Etymology  Linguists derive the Hawaiian language word iiwi from Proto-Nuclear-Polynesian *kiwi, which in central Polynesia refers to the bristle-thighed curlew (Numenius tahitiensis), a migratory bird.Polynesian Lexicon Project Online, entry kiwi.1. pollex.org.nz The long decurved bill of the curlew somewhat resembles that of the iiwi.  Description  thumb Head The adult iiwi is mostly scarlet, with black wings and tail and a long, curved, salmon-colored bill used primarily for drinking nectar. The contrast of the red and black plumage with surrounding green foliage makes the iiwi one of Hawaii's most easily seen native birds. Younger birds have golden plumage with more spots and ivory bills and were mistaken for a different species by early naturalists. Observations of young birds moulting into adult plumage resolved this confusion. Along with the Hawai ªi Mamo, iiwi were used in the feather trade. The iiwi's feathers were highly prized by Hawaiian alii (nobility) for use in decorating ahuula (feather cloaks) and mahiole (feathered helmets), and such uses gave the species its original scientific name: Vestiaria, which comes from the Latin for \\"clothing\\", and coccinea meaning \\"scarlet-colored\\". (In 2015 the IOC World Bird List moved the iiwi from genus Vestiaria to Drepanis because of the close relationship between the iiwi and the two species of mamo; Drepanis comes from the Greek for sickle, a reference to the shape of the beak.) The bird is often mentioned in Hawaiian folklore. The Hawaiian song \\"Sweet Lei Mamo\\" includes the line \\"The iiwi bird, too, is a friend\\". Song The iiwi ªs peculiar song consists of a couple of whistles, the sound of balls dropping in water, the rubbing of balloons together, and the squeaking of a rusty hinge. Diet The long bill of the iiwi assists it to extract nectar from the flowers of the Hawaiian lobelioids, which have decurved corollas. Starting in 1902 the lobelioid population declined dramatically, and the iiwi shifted to nectar from the blossoms of ≈çhia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) trees. Iiwi also eat small arthropods. Breeding In the early winter in January to June, the birds pair off and mate as the ≈çhia plants reach their flowering maximum. The female lays two to three eggs in a small cup shaped nest made from tree fibers, petals, and down feathers. These bluish eggs hatch in fourteen days. The chicks are yellowish- green marked with brownish-orange. The chicks fledge in 24 days and soon attain adult plumage. Habitat and Distribution The largest populations of iiwi inhabit Hawaii Island, followed by Maui with the greatest numbers in East Maui, and fewer than 1% of iiwi remain on Kauai. There may be remnant populations on Molokai and Oahu; very few iiwi have been recorded on either island since the 1990s. They are no longer present on LƒÅnai. Overall, ninety percent of the iiwi population is confined to a narrow band of forest on East Maui and the windward slopes of the island of Hawaii, between 4,265 and 6,234 feet (1,300 and 1,900 meters) in elevation. They are most abundant in mesic to wet forests at higher elevations. These birds are altitudinal migrants; they follow the progress of flowers as they develop at increasing altitudes throughout the year. It has also been noted that birds on Mauna Kea, Hawaii Island, likely make daily trips from lower elevations to feed on nectar. Seeking food at low elevation exposes them to low elevation disease organisms and high mortality. It has been theorized that the iiwi can migrate between islands and it may be why the bird has not gone extinct on smaller islands such as Molokai. Altitudinal migration complicates population assessment.  Threats and Conservation  Drepanis coccinea Iiwi was formerly classified as a near threatened species by the IUCN, but recent research has proven that it is rarer than previously believed. Consequently, it was uplisted to vulnerable status in 2008. The species was listed as threatened by the United States Department of the Interior on 20 October 2017. Iiwi are listed as a threatened species because of small and declining populations in some of its range and its susceptibility to fowlpox and avian malaria. Avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum) is an introduced disease that is spread by mosquitoes. Iiwi generally survive at higher elevations where temperatures are too cool for mosquitoes. Many disease-susceptible endemic birds, including iiwi and kiwikiu, became rare to absent at lower elevations, even in relatively intact native forest. In a laboratory study, ninety percent of all iiwi exposed to avian malaria died and the other ten percent were weakened but survived. Avian malaria has been identified as the primary driver of declines in abundance and distribution of iiwi observed since 1900. Iiwi habitat has been reduced and fragmented through various types of land development, including clearing native forest for food crops and grazing. Invasive plants also outcompete and displace native plants that iiwi use for foraging and nesting. Invasive animals impact iiwi in a variety of ways, for example feral ungulates may trample native plants and spread nonnative plants and invasive seeds, further degrading habitat. Feral pigs often create wallows by knocking over vegetation and hollowing out areas that fill with rain water. These have the potential to become incubator sites for mosquito larvae, which in turn spread avian malaria. Organizations throughout the islands have established nature reserves to protect native habitat. Fencing off sections of land to keep out feral ungulates, especially pigs, goats and axis deer enables native plants to recover from overgrazing and ungulate damage and helps restore native bird habitat. In recent years another threat has put native bird habitat at risk. Conservation groups are diligently working to reduce the risk of spreading a disease called Rapid Ohia Death (ROD). This disease along with ≈çhia dieback and ≈çhia rust could lead to a rapid decline in ≈çhia forests, an important nectar source for iiwi.

In times of epidemics, these physicians were specifically hired by towns where the plague had taken hold. Since the city was paying their salary, they treated everyone, wealthy or poor. However, some plague doctors were known to charge patients and their families additional fees for special treatments or false cures. Typically, they were not experienced physicians or surgeons at all; rather, they were often either second-rate doctors unable to otherwise run a successful medical practice or young physicians seeking to establish themselves in the industry. They rarely cured their patients; rather, they served to record a count of the number of people contaminated for demographic purposes. Plague doctors by their covenant treated plague patients and were known as municipal or \\"community plague doctors\\", whereas \\"general practitioners\\" were separate doctors and both might be in the same European city or town at the same time.Ellis, Oliver C., A History of Fire and Flame 1932 , Kessinger Publishing, 2004, p. 202. Byrne (Daily), p. 169Simon, Matthew, Emergent Computation: emphasizing bioinformatics, Publisher „Ç∑„É•„Éó„É™„É≥„Ç¨„Éº„Éª„Ç∏„É£„Éë„É≥Ê†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ, 2005, p. 3. In France and the Netherlands, plague doctors often lacked medical training and were referred to as \\"empirics\\". In one case, a plague doctor had been a fruit salesman before his employment as a physician.Byrne, 170 In the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, some doctors wore a beak-like mask that was filled with aromatic items. The masks were designed to protect them from putrid air, which (according to the now-obsolete miasmatic theory of disease) was seen as the cause of infection. The design of these clothes has been attributed to Charles de Lorme, the chief physician to Louis XIII.  History  The first European epidemic of the bubonic plague dates back to the mid 6th century and is called the Plague of Justinian.Gordon, Benjamin Lemer, Medieval and Renaissance medicine, Philosophical Library, 1959. p. 471 The largest plague epidemic was the Black Death in Europe in the 14th century. The large losses of people in a town created an economic disaster, so community plague doctors were considered quite valuable and were given special privileges; for example, plague doctors were freely allowed to perform autopsies to research a cure for the plague. In some cases, plague doctors were so valuable that when Barcelona dispatched two to Tortosa in 1650, outlaws captured them en route and demanded a ransom. Barcelona paid for their release. The city of Orvieto hired Matteo fu Angelo in 1348 for four times the normal rate of a doctor of 50-florin per year. Pope Clement VI hired several extra plague doctors during the Black Death plague to tend to the sick people of Avignon. Of 18 doctors in Venice, only one was left by 1348: five had died of the plague, and 12 were missing and may have fled.Byrne, 168  Costume  Plague doctor outfit from Germany (17th century). Venetian carnival mask with the inscription Medico della Peste (\\"Plague doctor\\") beneath the right eye Some plague doctors wore a special costume. The garments were invented by Charles de L'Orme in 1630 and were first used in Naples, but later spread to be used throughout Europe.Christine M. Boeckl, Images of plague and pestilence: iconography and iconology (Truman State University Press, 2000), pp. 15, 27. The protective suit consisted of a light, waxed fabric overcoat, a mask with glass eye openings and a beak shaped nose, typically stuffed with herbs, straw, and spices. Plague doctors would also commonly carry a cane to examine and direct patients without the need to make direct contact with them.Byrne (Encyclopedia), p. 505 The scented materials included juniper berry, ambergris, roses (Rosa), mint (Mentha spicata L.) leaves, camphor, cloves, labdanum, myrrh, and storax. Per the then-widely accepted miasma theory of disease, it was believed this suit would sufficiently protect the doctor from miasma while tending to patients.Irvine Loudon, Western Medicine: An Illustrated History (Oxford, 2001), p. 189.  Public servants  Their principal task, besides taking care of people with the plague, was to compile public records of the deaths due to the plague. In certain European cities like Florence and Perugia, plague doctors were requested to do autopsies to help determine the cause of death and how the plague played a role. Plague doctors became witnesses to numerous wills during times of plague epidemics. Plague doctors also gave advice to their patients about their conduct before death. This advice varied depending on the patient, and after the Middle Ages, the nature of the relationship between doctor and patient was governed by an increasingly complex ethical code.  Methods  Plague doctors practiced bloodletting and other remedies such as putting frogs or leeches on the buboes to \\"rebalance the humors\\" as a normal routine.Byfield, Ted, Renaissance: God in Man, A.D. 1300 to 1500: But Amid Its Splendors, Night Falls on Medieval Christianity, Christian History Project, 2010, p. 37. Plague doctors could not generally interact with the general public because of the nature of their business and the possibility of spreading the disease; they could also be subject to quarantine.  Notable Renaissance plague doctors  A famous plague doctor who gave medical advice about preventive measures which could be used against the plague was Nostradamus.Hogue, John,Nostradamus: the new revelations, Barnes & Noble Books, 1995, p. 1884. Nostradamus's advice was the removal of infected corpses, getting fresh air, drinking clean water, and drinking a juice preparation of rose hips.Pickover, Clifford A., Dreaming the Future: the fantastic story of prediction, Prometheus Books, 2001, p. 279. In Trait√© des fardemens it shows in Part A Chapter VIII that Nostradamus also recommended not to bleed the patient. The Italian city of Pavia, in 1479, contracted Giovanni de Ventura as a community plague doctor.King, Margaret L., Western Civilization: a social and cultural history, Prentice-Hall, 2002, p. 339. The Irish physician, Niall √ì Glac√°in (c.1563?‚Äì1653) earned deep respect in Spain, France and Italy for his bravery in treating numerous people with the plague.Stephen, p. 927 The French anatomist Ambroise Par√© and Swiss iatrochemist Paracelsus, were also famous Renaissance plague doctors.K√∂rner, Christian, Mountain Biodiversity: a global assessment, CRC Press, 2002, p. 13.

Brazelton hosted the cable television program What Every Baby Knows, and wrote a syndicated newspaper column. He wrote more than two hundred scholarly papers and twenty-four books. Biography Brazelton was born in Waco, Texas. He graduated in 1940 from Princeton and in 1943 from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City, where he accepted a medical internship at Roosevelt Hospital. From 1945, after war service in the U.S. Navy, he completed his medical residency in Boston Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) before undertaking pediatric training at Children's Hospital of Boston. He entered private practice in 1950, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His interest in child development led to training in child psychiatry at MGH and the James Jackson Putnam Children's Center. He subsequently served as a Fellow with Professor Jerome Bruner at the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard University, then combined his interests in primary care pediatrics and child psychiatry and in 1972 established the Child Development Unit, a pediatric training and research center at Children's Hospital in Boston. From 1988, he was Clinical Professor of Pediatrics Emeritus at Harvard Medical School. Brazelton was president of the Society for Research in Child Development (1987‚Äì1989), and of the National Center for Clinical Infant Programs (1988‚Äì1991). He appeared many times before Congressional committees in support of parental and medical leave bills, and continued to work with the Alliance for Better Child Care for a more comprehensive day care bill. He was a co-founder of Parent Action and served on the National Commission on Children. Brazelton is widely known for developing a \\"child-oriented\\" approach suggesting to start toilet training not earlier than 24 months of child's age while looking for \\"readiness signs\\" for mature toilet behavior. In his work, he shared his opinion that \\"...there is little innate in the child that leads him to want to be clean and dry, it must be understood as a kind of compliance to external pressure\\", that parents should withstand \\"external pressure\\" of grandparents to start toilet education around 9 months of age and postpone it until a child is demonstrating certain \\"readings signs\\". https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/29/1/121?sso=1&sso;_redirect_count=1&nfstatus;=401&nftoken;=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&nfstatusdescription;=ERROR%3a+No+local+token Later Brazelton served as Chairman of Pampers Parenting Institute funded by P&G; Corporation, a global disposable diaper market leader. He also participated in Pampers advertising for Toddler diapers N6. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oO2GR1_-A Brazelton appeared several times on The Oprah Winfrey Show and the Ellen DeGeneres Show. Neonatal behavior Brazelton's foremost achievement in pediatrics and child development has been to increase pediatricians' awareness of, and attention to, the effect of young children's behavior, activity states, and emotional expressions on the ways their parents react to, and thereby affect them. For example, one of his first publications in the field of psychology was a study with Kenneth Kaye of the interaction between babies' sucking at breast or bottle and the mother's attempts to maintain it, the earliest form of human \\"dialogue\\". The Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) assesses not only the physical and neurological responses of newborns, but also their emotional well being and individual differences.Arnold Sameroff, ed. Organization and Stability in Newborn Behavior. Monograph of the Society for Research in Child Development, 1978, Vol. 43, No. 177. The Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) looks at a wide range of behaviors and is suitable for examining newborns and infants up to two months old. By the end of the assessment, the examiner has a behavioral \\"portrait\\" of the infant, describing the baby's strengths, adaptive responses and possible vulnerabilities. The examiner shares this portrait with parents to develop appropriate caregiving strategies aimed at enhancing the earliest relationship between babies and parents. It evaluates a wide range of 38 behaviors to build a behavioral profile of an infant up to 2 months old. The Scale contains 28 behavioral and 18 reflex items. It assesses the baby's capabilities across different developmental areas (autonomic, motor, state and social-interactive systems) and describes how infants integrate these areas as they adapt to their new environment .This approach was innovative for recognizing that a baby is a highly developed organism, even when just newly born. The profile describes the baby's strengths, adaptive responses and possible vulnerabilities. The NBAS is based on several key assumptions. First, infants, even ones that seem vulnerable, are highly capable when they are born. \\"A newborn already has nine months of experience when she is born,\\" Dr. Brazelton notes. \\"She is capable of controlling her behavior in order to respond to her new environment.\\" Second, babies \\"communicate\\" through their behavior, which, although it may not always seem like it, is a rational language. Not only do infants respond to cues around them, like their parents' faces, but they also take steps to control their environment, such as crying to get a response from their caregivers. Third, infants are social organisms, individuals with their own unique qualities, ready to shape as well as be shaped by the caregiving environment.

The station was opened on August 25, 1984, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Location Providing service for the Red Line, the station is at the 5400 block of Wisconsin Avenue, Northwest and serves the neighborhoods of Chevy Chase and Friendship Heights. The area is a major retail shopping and broadcast media district. The station also serves as a bus depot linking Montgomery County Transit's Ride-On bus system with the Washington Metro. It is directly adjacent to the Western Division Metrobus garage on 44th Street and Harrison Street NW.

Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail northwest of the Van Ness‚ÄìUDC station and the opening of the Bethesda, Grosvenor, Medical Center and Tenleytown stations. This station is relatively deep: it is the fifth deepest station on the Red Line. The escalator ride from the common room at the north entrance to the mezzanine level takes roughly a minute and a half. To enable Metro to perform train turnarounds south of Grosvenor-Strathmore, a diamond crossover exists just north of the station. Occasionally, during rush hours (for schedule adjustments) or during track maintenance, trains terminate here. When this happens, trains offload their passengers on the Shady Grove-bound track, exit the station, switch direction just north of the interlocking, and then run through the interlocking to the Glenmont (towards downtown)-bound track. Station layout This station uses the four-coffer arch design found at most underground stations on the western side of the Red Line. Unlike its many counterparts such as Van Ness-UDC and Tenleytown-AU, the station's walls are more rounded. Friendship Heights is the only station in the system with this design that has mezzanines at both ends of the platform. Two of its five exits sit on the Maryland side of Western Avenue, whereas the other three exit into the District. At the Western Avenue entrance, four separate street entrances come together in an upper mezzanine, allowing riders to access a set of three escalators that go to the platform. One entrance is located at a side entrance to the lobby of an entrance to the C-level of Mazza Gallerie that has access to Western Avenue. Another entrance offers direct access to Chevy Chase Pavilion. The newest entrance, located off Wisconsin Avenue next to The Shops at Wisconsin Place, opened in 2011, replacing an earlier entrance that led directly into a Hecht's. The new entrance is located across Wisconsin Avenue from the station's main entrance, which surfaces in a large bus depot underneath the Chevy Chase Metro Building. A second entrance, at the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and Jenifer Street NW, is elevator-only, with four high-speed elevators servicing the station's south mezzanine.

Henceforth the Zionist movement would strive for unqualified > Jewish independence in Palestine, for a state with recognized borders, > republican institutions, and a sovereign Army, to be attained in cooperation > with America. The meeting was held in New York City at the prestigious Biltmore Hotel from May 9 to May 11, 1942 with 600 delegates and Zionist leaders from 18 countries attending. The Biltmore Program has been described by a number of historians as \\"a virtual coup d‚Äôetat\\" within the Zionist movement, in which more moderate leaders were replaced with leaders with more aggressive goals. History Biltmore Street, Petah Tikva, commemorating the Biltmore Conference Prior to this Extraordinary Zionist Conference at the Biltmore, official Zionism steadfastly refused to formulate the ultimate aim of the movement preferring instead to concentrate on the practical task of building the Jewish National Home. The Biltmore Program became the official Zionist stand on the ultimate aim of the movement. According to Ben-Gurion, the \\"first and essential\\" stage of the program was the immigration of two million additional Jews to Palestine. In 1944 a one million plan would become the official policy of the Zionist leadership.Ronald W Zweig, David Ben-Gurion: Politics and Leadership in Israel, p.148, \\"On several occasions he spoke of the immigration of two million Jews as a first and essential stage of the program, despite the ongoing controversy over the 'absorptive capacity' of Palestine.\\" There was no reference to the Arab population prevailing in Mandatory Palestine, and, according to Anita Shapira, marked a transition to the view that conflict was inevitable between the Arabs and Jews, and could only resolved by the sword.Itzhak Galnoor, Partition of Palestine, The: Decision Crossroads in the Zionist Movement, State University of New York Press 2012 p.278. The major shift at Biltmore was prompted by intense common opposition to the British White Paper of 1939, which interpreted the terms of the Mandate in a way that would freeze \\"the Jewish community to a permanent minority status,\\" and the then-current war negative situation. It was also prompted by the realization that America would play a larger part in fulfillment of Zionist designs after the war.Michael Oren, Power, Faith and Fantasy, \\"Decision at Biltmore,\\" pp 442‚Äì445 Official Zionism‚Äôs firm, unequivocal stand did not please every one, however. The pro-British Chaim Weizmann had bristled at them and bi- nationalists such as Henrietta Szold and Judah L. Magnes rejected them and broke off to establish their own party, Ichud (\\"Unification\\"), that advocated an Arab‚ÄìJewish Federation. Opposition to the Biltmore Program also led to the founding of the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism.American Jewish Year Book Vol. 45 (1943‚Äì1944), Pro-Palestine and Zionist Activities, pp 206‚Äì214 Various Zionist organizations were represented in the American Emergency Committee of Zionist Affairs, which called an \\"Extraordinary Zionist Conference\\" as a substitute for the full (22nd) Zionist Congress which had been cancelled due to World War II. Attendees included Chaim Weizmann, as President of the World Zionist Organization, David Ben-Gurion as Chairman of the Jewish Agency Executive, and Nahum Goldmann as a member of the Executive of the Zionist Organization of America.Mideast Web The four main organisations of American Jewry represented were: the Zionist Organization of America, Hadassah, Mizrahi, and Poale Zion. Among the American organizers was Reform Rabbi Abba Hillel Silver. Declaration The joint statement issued at the end of the session was known as the Biltmore Program. The program asked for unrestricted Jewish immigration to Palestine. The full text of the program reads as follows: #American Zionists assembled in this Extraordinary Conference reaffirm their unequivocal devotion to the cause of democratic freedom and international justice to which the people of the United States, allied with the other United Nations, have dedicated themselves, and give expression to their faith in the ultimate victory of humanity and justice over lawlessness and brute force. #This Conference offers a message of hope and encouragement to their fellow Jews in the Ghettos and concentration camps of Hitler-dominated Europe and prays that their hour of liberation may not be far distant. #The Conference sends its warmest greetings to the Jewish Agency Executive in Jerusalem, to the Va\`ad Leumi, and to the whole Yishuv in Palestine, and expresses its profound admiration for their steadfastness and achievements in the face of peril and great difficulties ... #In our generation, and in particular in the course of the past twenty years, the Jewish people have awakened and transformed their ancient homeland; from 50,000 at the end of the last war their numbers have increased to more than 500,000. They have made the waste places to bear fruit and the desert to blossom. Their pioneering achievements in agriculture and in industry, embodying new patterns of cooperative endeavour, have written a notable page in the history of colonization. #In the new values thus created, their Arab neighbours in Palestine have shared. The Jewish people in its own work of national redemption welcomes the economic, agricultural and national development of the Arab peoples and states. The Conference reaffirms the stand previously adopted at Congresses of the World Zionist Organization, expressing the readiness and the desire of the Jewish people for full cooperation with their Arab neighbours. #The Conference calls for the fulfillment of the original purpose of the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate which recognizing the historical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine' was to afford them the opportunity, as stated by President Wilson, to found there a Jewish Commonwealth. The Conference affirms its unalterable rejection of the White Paper of May 1939 and denies its moral or legal validity. The White Paper seeks to limit, and in fact to nullify Jewish rights to immigration and settlement in Palestine, and, as stated by Mr. Winston Churchill in the House of Commons in May 1939, constitutes \`a breach and repudiation of the Balfour Declaration'. The policy of the White Paper is cruel and indefensible in its denial of sanctuary to Jews fleeing from Nazi persecution; and at a time when Palestine has become a focal point in the war front of the United Nations, and Palestine Jewry must provide all available manpower for farm and factory and camp, it is in direct conflict with the interests of the allied war effort. #In the struggle against the forces of aggression and tyranny, of which Jews were the earliest victims, and which now menace the Jewish National Home, recognition must be given to the right of the Jews of Palestine to play their full part in the war effort and in the defence of their country, through a Jewish military force fighting under its own flag and under the high command of the United Nations. #The Conference declares that the new world order that will follow victory cannot be established on foundations of peace, justice and equality, unless the problem of Jewish homelessness is finally solved. The Conference urges that the gates of Palestine be opened; that the Jewish Agency be vested with control of immigration into Palestine and with the necessary authority for upbuilding the country, including the development of its unoccupied and uncultivated lands; and that Palestine be established as a Jewish Commonwealth integrated in the structure of the new democratic world. ::Then and only then will the age old wrong to the Jewish people be righted.Declaration adopted by the Extraordinary Zionist Conference at the Biltmore Hotel of New York City, 11 May 1942 UNISPALquoted in Gelvin, James L. (2005). The Israel-Palestine Conflict: One Hundred Years of War. Cambridge University Press. p. 122) After approval by the Zionist General Council in Palestine, the Biltmore Program was adopted as the platform of the World Zionist Organization. Jewish Commonwealth The significance of the Program to a Jewish Commonwealth was in stepping beyond the terms of the Balfour Declaration (which had been reaffirmed as British policy by Winston Churchill's White Paper of 1922) that there should be a \\"Jewish National Home\\" in Palestine. According to Ami Isseroff, the Program was \\"a crucial step in the development of the Zionist movement, which increasingly saw itself as opposed to Britain rather than a collaborator of Britain, and it determined that henceforth Ben-Gurion and the Zionist Executive in Palestine, rather than Weizmann would lead the Zionist movement and determine policy toward the British.\\" Although it spoke of the Jewish people for \\"the economic, agricultural and national development of the Arab peoples and states\\", the Biltmore Program was implicitly a rejection of the proposal for a binational solution to the question of Arab-Jewish co-existence in Palestine. Hashomer Hatzair, a socialist-Zionist group, accordingly voted against the program. The estimates for the destruction of European Jewry grew throughout 1942 and 1943. Chaim Weizmann urged a re-evaluation of the Biltmore program in June 1943. Chaim Weizmann‚Äôs earlier estimate of 25% destruction declared at the Biltmore conference now seemed wildly optimistic.Aaron Berman (1990) Nazism, the Jews, and American Zionism, 1933-1948 Wayne State University Press, p 96 Rabbi Meyer Berlin leader of the Mizrahi Zionist party disagreed arguing that no one could know how many Jews would survive and how many would die.Jeffrey S. Gurock (1998) American Zionism: Mission and Politics Taylor & Francis, pp 356-357 American Jewish conference At the American Jewish Conference of 29 August 1943 the adoption of the Biltmore program was challenged by Joseph Proskauer and Robert Goldman, they argued that the immediate problem was the rescue effort, not the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth. Goldman felt the Biltmore program was unduly weighted in favour of the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth and that the focus on this as a priority would hamper the efforts to rescue the European Jewry. While Abba Silver and Emanuel Neumann put forward that the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth should be the primary aim.

He supported the American Revolution, served in the Confederation Congress, was a delegate to the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 which wrote the Constitution, and was a U.S. Representative in the First Congress. Daniel Carroll was one of five men to sign both the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution. He was one of the very few Roman Catholics among the Founders. Early life Carroll's mother Eleanor Darnall Carroll as a child, painted by Justus Engelhardt K√ºhn c1710 Carroll was born in Marlborough Town in the Province of Maryland on July 22, 1730. He was the son of wealthy planters Daniel Carroll (c.1696 - 1751) and Eleanor Darnall Carroll (1703 - 1796). His parents' home was Darnall's Chance, a plantation of 27,000 acres which his mother had inherited from her grandfather.Geiger, Mary Virginia. Daniel Carroll, A Framer of the Constitution, Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America, 1943. (In 1741, Mrs. Carroll sold six acres to merchant James Wardrop, who built a house there. That house and land is now a house museum called \\"Darnall's Chance\\", listed on the National Register of Historic Places.) His younger brother John was the first Roman Catholic bishop in the United States (as Bishop of Baltimore, 1790) and founder of Georgetown University; his cousin Charles Carroll of Carrollton signed the Declaration of Independence. Carroll was sent abroad for his education. Between 1742 and 1748 he and John studied under the Jesuits at the College of St. Omer in France, established for the education of English Catholics. Then, after a tour of Europe, he sailed home and soon married Eleanor Carroll, apparently a first cousin, their grandparents are Daniel O'Caroll and Dorothy Kennedy from Ireland. Career In the 1770s, Carroll gradually joined the Patriot cause. As a slaveholder and large landholder, he was initially concerned that the Revolution might fail economically and bring about not only his family's financial ruin, but mob rule. At the time, Maryland, though Catholic-founded, had (like all British colonies) laws excluding Roman Catholics from holding public office. When Maryland declared its independence from Great Britain and enacted its first constitution, these laws were nullified. Carroll was elected to the Maryland Senate, serving 1777‚Äì1781. As a state senator, he helped raise troops and money for the American cause. His involvement in the Revolutionary War, like that of other Patriots in his extended family, was inspired by the family's motto: \\"Strong in Faith and War\\". He also led the effort to block the State Assembly from ratifying of the Articles of Confederation until the states that had western land claims (which Maryland did not) ceded those claims to Congress. Carroll dropped his opposition only after Virginia relinquished its claims on land north of the Ohio River to Congress, and on February 2, 1781, Maryland became the thirteenth and final state to ratify the Articles. Constitutional Convention of 1787 Coat of Arms of Daniel Carroll In 1787, Carroll was named a Maryland delegate to the Philadelphia Convention, which convened to revise the Articles, and produced the Constitution. Like his good friend James Madison of Virginia, Carroll was convinced that a strong central government was needed to regulate commerce among the states and with other nations. He also spoke out repeatedly in opposition to the payment of members of the United States Congress by the states, reasoning that such compensation would sabotage the strength of the new government because \\"the dependence of both Houses on the state Legislatures would be complete ... The new government in this form is nothing more than a second edition of [the Continental] Congress in two volumes, instead of one, and perhaps with very few amendments.\\" He was also a friend and ally of George Washington. When it was suggested that the President (executive branch) should be elected by the Congress (legislative branch), Carroll, seconded by James Wilson, moved that the words \\"by the legislature\\" be replaced with \\"by the people\\". He and Thomas Fitzsimons were the only Roman Catholics to sign the Constitution, but their presence was a sign of the continued advancement of religious freedom in America. At the Constitutional Convention, Daniel Carroll played an essential role in formulating the limitation of the powers of the federal or central government. He was the author of the presumption‚Äîenshrined in the Constitution as a closing article ‚Äì that powers not specifically delegated to the federal government were reserved to the states or to the people.Carter, Charles Carroll. \\"The Carroll Family\\", Catholic Education Resource Center Carroll spoke about 20 times during the summer of debates at the Constitutional Convention and served on the Committee on Postponed Matters. Returning to Maryland after the convention, he campaigned for ratification of the Constitution but was not a delegate to the Maryland state convention for ratification.\\"Delegates to the Constitutional Convention\\" United States National Archives and Records Administration Political career Following the convention, Carroll continued to be involved in state and national affairs. He was a key participant in the Maryland ratification struggle of 1787‚Äì1788. He defended the Constitution in the pages of the \\"Maryland Journal\\", published in Baltimore, most notably in his response to the arguments advanced by the well-known Anti-federalist, another Patriot delegate Samuel Chase. After ratification was achieved in Maryland, Carroll was elected as a Representative (\\"congressman\\") to the Sixth Congressional District of Maryland to the First Congress of 1789, meeting in New York City. Given his concern for economic and fiscal stability, he voted for the assumption of state debts accumulated during the war by the federal government to establish a new level of financial confidence of credible public debts as proposed by the new U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton as part of a \\"grand bargain\\" with Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, for Northerners to support locating the new national capital in the upper South, along the Potomac River. One of three commissioners appointed to survey the newly designated District of Columbia and acquire land for the new federal capital in the District, Carroll was related to two major landowners whose land was acquired by the government, his brother-in-law Notley Young and nephew Daniel Carroll of Duddington. The new United States Capitol was to be built on the wooded hill owned by his nephew. As one of his first official acts as commissioner, on April 15, 1791 he and fellow commissioner David Stuart of Virginia laid the cornerstone for the beginning boundary line survey of the District at Jones Point, on the south bank of the Potomac near Alexandria, formerly in Virginia.Daniel Carroll He served as a commissioner until 1795, when he retired because of poor health. He later was again elected to the Maryland Senate. He had many interests in his state and region, including the \\"Patowmack Company\\", which sought to build a \\"Patowmack Canal\\" to the West. This was a long-time project of George Washington since his western explorations and military campaigns against the French. This predated the survey and construction thirty years later of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. Carroll died May 7, 1796, at the age of 65, at his home near Rock Creek in the present neighborhood of Forest Glen, Maryland. Carroll's body was buried there in Saint John the Evangelist Catholic Church Cemetery.\\"Signers of the Constitution\\" , National Park Service Legacy Carroll Street in Madison, Wisconsin is named in his honor.Wisconsin Historical Society References Secondary sources  * External links * Category:1730 births Category:1796 deaths Category:Continental Congressmen from Maryland Category:18th-century American politicians Category:People educated at Stonyhurst College Category:Maryland state senators Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Maryland Category:People of Maryland in the American Revolution Category:Presidents of the Maryland State Senate Category:Signers of the Articles of Confederation Category:Signers of the United States Constitution Category:People from Upper Marlboro, Maryland Daniel Category:American planters Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Burials in Maryland Category:People from Forest Glen, Maryland Category:American slave owners Category:Catholics from Maryland ","title":"Daniel Carroll"},{"id":"560343","text":"Bethesda is a rapid transit station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro system in Bethesda, Maryland.

He was a leader for many years in Maryland's colonial government, but when conflict arose with Great Britain Jenifer embraced the Patriot cause. Early life and colonial career Jenifer, born at Coates Retirement (now Ellerslie), an estate west of Port Tobacco in Charles County, Maryland, was the son of Dr. Daniel Jenifer and Elizabeth Mason. As a young man, he acted as a receiver general, the local financial agent for the last two proprietors of Maryland. He was the uncle of Thomas Stone, Michael J. Stone, and John Hoskins Stone. Jenifer served as justice of the peace for Charles County and later for the western circuit of Maryland. He sat on a commission that settled a boundary dispute between Pennsylvania and Delaware (1760) and on the Governor's Council, the upper house of the Maryland legislature that also served as the colony's court of appeals and as a board of senior advisers to the governor (1773‚Äì76). American Revolution Despite his close ties with the colonial government, Jenifer strongly resented what he and most of the colonial gentry saw as Parliament's arbitrary interference with the colonies' affairs, especially its laws concerning taxation and trade regulation. Years before the struggle for independence began, he had defended the proprietors of Maryland against those who sought to make Maryland a Royal colony. When the Revolution came, Jenifer lent his considerable support as a wealthy landowner to the Patriot cause, despite the fact that many leading Patriots had been his enemies in the proprietorship struggle. Jenifer became the president of Maryland's Council of Safety, the Patriot body established to organize Maryland's military forces for the Revolution (1775‚Äì77). When, in 1776, a new constitution was framed for the state of Maryland, Jenifer commented on the document's neglect of popular sovereignty: \\"The Senate does not appear to me to be a Child of the people at Large, and therefore will not be Supported by them longer than there Subsists the most perfect Union between the different Legislative branches.\\" During and after the war, Jenifer became increasingly concerned about national affairs. He represented his state in the Continental Congress (1778‚Äì82) while simultaneously serving as president of Maryland's first senate (1777‚Äì80). As manager of his state's finances between 1782 and 1785, Jenifer drew on his experiences as a landholder to help the state survive the critical postwar economic depression. Along with James Madison, John Dickinson, George Mason and his good friend George Washington, Jenifer began to explore ways to solve the economic and political problems that had arisen under the weak Articles of Confederation. Consequently, he attended the Mount Vernon Conference, a meeting that would lead eventually to the Constitutional Convention. Constitutional Convention Like his old friend Benjamin Franklin, Jenifer enjoyed the status of elder statesman at the Convention, which took place from May 25 to September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Jenifer, one of the convention's oldest delegates like Franklin, used his prestige (as well as humor and reputation as pleasant company) to work for a strong and permanent union of the states by reconciling opposing views and formulating the compromises that made the convention a success. Jenifer took stands on several important issues, although his advanced age restricted his activity in the day-to-day proceedings. Business experience gained while managing a large plantation had convinced him that an active central government was needed to ensure financial and commercial stability. To that end, Jenifer favored a strong and permanent union of the states in which a Congress representing the people had the power to tax. Concerned with continuity in the new government, he favored a three-year term for the United States House of Representatives. Too frequent elections, he concluded, might lead to indifference and would make prominent men unwilling to seek office. Jenifer was outvoted on this point, but his reaction was to marvel at the delegates' ability to come to agreement on a plan of government: \\"The first month we only came to grips, and the second it seemed as though we would fly apart forever, however we came as close as friends of eighty years in but days.\\" When Maryland's other delegate, Luther Martin, said that he feared being hanged if the people of Maryland approved the Constitution, Jenifer quipped that Martin should stay in Philadelphia, so that he would not hang in his home state. Death and legacy After the convention, Jenifer retired to his plantation at Stepney near Annapolis, where he died in 1790. He was buried at Ellerslie, the place of his birth, which is now on the National Register of Historic Places. In his will, Jenifer passed his roughly land holdings to his nephew, Daniel Jenifer, and instructed that all his slaves be freed six years after his death.Papenfuse, Edward C., et al., \\"Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer (Jennifer),\\" in A Biographical Dictionary of the Maryland Legislature 1635‚Äì1789, Vol. I, I‚ÄìZ (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), 485‚Äì486. The following year the younger Jenifer had a son, who was named after his great-uncle. Daniel Jenifer, like his uncle, also served as magistrate in Charles County, as well as three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. His family home, Retreat, was also located in Charles County, near one of the largest slave-trading ports of the era, Port Tobacco; it was built in the last quarter of the 18th century and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Accessed November 8, 2008. was an American comic book artist who created the series Magnus, Robot Fighter and illustrated such newspaper comic strips as Tarzan and Star Wars. He was inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 2006. Biography Manning studied at the Los Angeles County Art Institute, and later, during his US Army service in Japan, drew cartoons for his military base newspaper. In 1953 he went to work for Western Publishing and illustrated stories for the wide variety of comics published by Western for Dell Comics, and later for Western's own Gold Key Comics line. His first notable work was on Brothers of the Spear, a backup feature, created by Gaylord Du Bois, in the Tarzan comic book. He also drew a few Tarzan stories. He created Gold Key's Magnus, Robot Fighter and The Aliens (which ran in the back of the former) in 1963 and drew the first 21 issues, through 1968. From 1965 to 1969, Manning drew Gold Key's Tarzan series. During this time, he adapted ten of the first eleven Tarzan novels written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, from scripts written by Gaylord Du Bois. (The adaptation of the sixth, Jungle Tales of Tarzan, also scripted by Du Bois, was drawn by Alberto Giolitti rather than Manning). In 1999 the first seven of these were reprinted in three graphic novels by Dark Horse Comics as Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes (Tarzan of the Apes, Return, Beasts, and Son of Tarzan), Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan ‚Äî The Jewels of Opar, and Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan The Untamed (Tarzan the Untamed and Tarzan the Terrible). Manning's remaining adaptations, not reprinted by Dark Horse, were \\"Tarzan and the Golden Lion\\" Tarzan and the Ant Men and Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle. He did not do the finished art on the latter, but provided lay-outs for parts of the story. Manning also drew the Korak stories in the first 11 issues of Gold Key's Korak comic (also written by Du Bois). From 1967 to 1972 he drew the Tarzan daily newspaper comic strip and stayed on the Sunday page until 1979. He also created four original Tarzan graphic novels for European publication. Two of them were reprinted by Dark Horse Comics in a single trade paperback collection (Tarzan in The Land That Time Forgot and The Pool of Time) (). During that same period he used assistants, among them William Stout, Rick Hoberg, Mike Royer, and Dave Stevens. Magnus, his and Gold Key's best-known heroic-adventure series, was set in the year 4000, which Manning depicted as clean, airy city scapes populated by shiny robots, handsome men, and beautiful women. In an era when many science fiction illustrations still showed interstellar spaceships with fins reminiscent of World War II V-2 rockets, Manning offered more exotic craft. His Magnus work was later collected by Dark Horse Comics in three hardcover \\"archive\\" editions using a different color palette. Dark Horse then reprinted them in three trade paperbacks. His final major work was writing and drawing the Star Wars newspaper strip in 1979-80. These were collected by Dark Horse Comics as Classic Star Wars: The Early Adventures (), which omitted the fact that Manning only drew some of the episodes that were written by Steve Gerber and Archie Goodwin. Russ Manning died of cancer on December 1, 1981 while still living in California where he was born. He was 52.

M., & Sacuzzo, D. P.(2010). Psychological Testing: Principles, Applications, & Issues, Eighth Edition. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning was developed in 1973 by Dr. T. Berry Brazelton and his colleagues. This test purports to provide an index of a newborn's abilities, and is usually given to an infant somewhere between the age of 3 days to 4 weeks old. This approach was innovative for recognizing that a baby is a highly developed organism, even when just newly born. The profile describes the baby's strengths, adaptive responses and possible vulnerabilities. This knowledge may help parents develop appropriate strategies for caring in intimate relationships to enhance their earliest relationship with the child. Test procedure The Brazelton scale produces a total of 47 scores, of which 27 are behavioral related and 20 are elicited responses. These scores measure a variety of areas including the \\"neurological, social, and behavioral aspects of a newborn's functioning.\\" Additionally, \\"factors such as reflexes, responses to stress, startle reactions, cuddliness, motor maturity, ability to habituate to sensory stimuli, and hand-mouth coordination are all assessed.\\" Validity evidence is strong for the Brazelton scale, providing a considerable research base. This scale has been used widely as a research tool as well as a diagnostic tool for special purposes. Following is a list of various research projects that have implemented the Brazelton scale: *\\"Used to evaluate the effects of low birth weight on premature infants\\" *\\"Used it to study the effects of cocaine use in pregnancy\\" *\\"Prenatal alcohol exposure\\" *\\"Prenatal Iron deficiency\\" *\\"Prenatal maternal mood\\" *\\"Prenatal maternal dopamine levels\\" *\\"Environmental agents\\" *\\"Parent-infant attachment\\" *\\"Gender differences in newborns\\" *\\"High-risk neonates\\" Despite the influence of the Brazelton scale, it has some drawbacks. The biggest is that no norms are available. Therefore, as examiners and researchers say that one infant scored higher than another one, there is no standard sample with which to compare. Further, the scores are not completely understood; further testing is required. As for validity, it has \\"poorly documented predictive and construct validity.\\" It also does not do a good job at predicting later intelligence, although the scale is supposed to assess the \\"infant's role in the mother-infant social relationship\\" from which high scores are supposed to presume \\"high levels of intelligence.\\". A 2018 systematic review of the NBAS on its relationship to supporting caregivers and improving outcomes for caregivers and infants found only very low-quality evidence for improving parent-infant interaction for mostly low-risk, first time caregivers and their infants. Therefore, the value of the test is as a research tool and a supplement test to medical testing procedures. But as a predictor of future intelligence, it is very unsatisfactory. Because of this, some wonder what the scale is really measuring. Training is necessary for effective and reliable administration of the NBAS.

The station was opened on August 25, 1984, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Providing service for the Red Line, the station serves the National Institutes of Health campus and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and is located at Rockville Pike and South Drive. Since there is little retail in the area and no commuter parking lot, this station is used almost exclusively by employees and visitors to those two institutions. History The station opened on August 25, 1984. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail northwest of the Van Ness‚ÄìUDC station and the opening of the Bethesda, Friendship Heights, Grosvenor, and Tenleytown stations. In September 2009, Montgomery County submitted a $20 million federal grant application to build a pedestrian tunnel under Rockville Pike to improve access to the Medical Center stop from Walter Reed Medical Center. Currently, there is only a crosswalk here, with many passengers crossing the heavily travelled street from Walter Reed on the east side of MD 355 to get to the station on the west side. Construction would have originally occurred in 2011, but the project was not approved until 2013. The project is fully funded at $68 million, mostly through the Department of Defense, and includes installation of new deep elevators, improvement of surface bicycle and pedestrian facilities, as well as an extension of the left turn lane on southbound MD 355. The project began construction in December 2017, and is expected to be completed in late 2021.  Station layout  Medical Center is the last underground station heading towards . Like most underground stations on the Red Line, Medical Center is very deep: its platform is located below street level.

He served as a state legislator, a member of the Congress of the Confederation, a delegate to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, and a member of the United States Senate. As one of the largest slaveholders in the United States, he defended American slavery for both political and personal motives, even though he had private misgivings about the institution and particularly about the African slave trade. He introduced the Fugitive Slave Clause into a draft of the U.S. Constitution, which gave a federal guarantee to the property rights of slaveholders. He supported counting the full slave population in state totals for the purposes of Congressional apportionment. The Constitution's Three-Fifths Compromise counted only three-fifths of the slave population in state totals, but still led to Southern states having disproportionate power in the U.S. Congress. Early life Pierce Butler was born on July 11, 1744, in Garryhundon, County Carlow, Ireland. He was the third son of Sir Richard Butler, 5th Baronet, of Cloughgrenan (1699‚Äì1771) and his wife Henrietta Percy. He resigned a commission in the British Army in 1773, and settled with his wife Mary in South Carolina. Revolutionary war soldier In early 1779, Governor John Rutledge asked the former Redcoat to help reorganize South Carolina's defenses. Butler assumed the post of the state's adjutant general, a position that carried the rank of brigadier general. He preferred to be addressed as major, his highest combat rank.Robert K. Wright Jr. and Morris J. MacGregor Jr., \\"Pierce Butler\\", Soldier-Statesmen of the Constitution, Washington, D.C.: United States Army Center of Military History, 1987, accessed 4 March 2012 Meanwhile, Britain was shifting its war strategy. By 1778, King George III and his ministers faced a new military situation in the colonies. Their forces in the northern and middle colonies had reached a stalemate with Washington's Continentals, more adequately supplied and better trained after the hard winter at Valley Forge. There was the risk of France entering the war as a partner of the Americans. The British developed a \\"southern strategy.\\" They believed that the many Loyalists in the southern states (with whom the British had an active trade through cotton, rice and tobacco) would rally to the Crown if supported by regular troops. They planned a conquest of the rebellious colonies one at a time, moving north from Georgia. They launched their new strategy by capturing Savannah in December 1778. Butler joined to mobilize South Carolina's militia to repulse the threatened British invasion. Later, he helped prepare the state units used in the counterattack to drive the enemy from Georgia. During the operation, which climaxed with an attempted attack on Savannah, Butler served as a volunteer aide to General Lachlan McIntosh. The hastily raised and poorly prepared militia troops could not compete with the well-trained British regulars, and the Patriots' effort to relieve Savannah ended in failure. In 1780, the British captured Charleston, South Carolina and with it, most of the colony's civil government and military forces. Butler escaped as part of a command group deliberately located outside the city. During the next two years, he developed a counterstrategy to defeat the enemy's southern operations. Refusing to surrender, allies in South Carolina, and the occupied portions of Georgia and North Carolina, organized a resistance movement. As adjutant general, Butler worked with former members of the militia and Continental Army veterans such as Francis Marion and Thomas Sumter to integrate the partisan efforts into a unified campaign. They united with the operations of the Southern Army under the command of Horatio Gates and later Nathanael Greene. As a former Royal officer, Butler was a special target for the British occupation forces. Several times he barely avoided capture. Throughout the closing phases of the southern campaign, he personally donated cash and supplies to help sustain the American forces and also assisted in the administration of prisoner-of-war facilities. Politician Military operations in the final months of the Revolutionary War left Butler a poor man. Many of his plantations and ships were destroyed, and the international trade on which the majority of his income depended was in shambles. He traveled to Europe when the war ended in an effort to secure loans and establish new markets. He enrolled his son Thomas in a London school run by Weeden Butler, and engaged a new minister from among the British clergy for his Episcopal church in South Carolina. In late 1785 Butler returned to the United States. He became an outspoken advocate of reconciliation with former Loyalists and of equal representation for the residents of the backcountry. Testifying to his growing political influence, the South Carolina legislature asked Butler to represent the state at the Constitutional Convention that met in Philadelphia in 1787. At the convention, he urged that the president be given the power to initiate war; however, he did not receive a second proponent for his motion and all the other delegates overwhelmingly rejected his proposal. Butler's experiences as a soldier and planter- legislator led to his forceful support for a strong union of the states. At the same time, he looked to the special interests of his region. He introduced the Fugitive Slave Clause (Article 4, Section 2), which established protection for slavery in the Constitution. In addition, while privately criticizing the international trade in African slaves, he supported the passage in the Constitution that prohibited regulation of the trade for 20 years. He advocated counting the full slave population in the states' totals for the purposes of Congressional apportionment, but had to be satisfied with the compromise to count three-fifths of the slaves toward that end.Marian C. McKenna, \\"Review: Malcolm Bell Jr., 'Major Butler's Legacy: Five Generations of a Slaveholding Family' (1987)\\" , Canadian Journal of History, Vol. 23, No. 2 (1988) August It ensured that the Southern planter elite exerted a strong influence in national politics for decades. Butler displayed inconsistencies that troubled his associates. He favored ratification of the Constitution, yet did not attend the South Carolina convention that ratified it. Later, he was elected by the South Carolina state legislature to three separate terms in the United States Senate, but changed his party allegiance: beginning as a Federalist, he switched to the Jeffersonian party in 1795. In 1804 he declared himself a political independent. Vice President Aaron Burr was Butler's guest at his St. Simons plantations in September 1804. Burr was, at the time, lying low after shooting Alexander Hamilton in the July 1804 duel. The states of New York and New Jersey had each indicted the Vice President for murder in the wake of the post-duel controversy. Burr had traveled during August, to Butler's plantation under the pseudonym Roswell King, which was Butler's overseer's name. During Burr's stay in early September, one of the worst hurricanes in history hit the area, and Burr's first-hand description documents both his stay and this event. Butler's politics and public involvement mirror the political rise and fall of his friend Burr. After these successive changes, voters did not elect Butler again to national office. They elected him three more times to the state legislature as an easterner who spoke on behalf of the west. Later years, post-politics Following his wife's death in 1790, Butler sold off the last of their South Carolina holdings and invested in Georgia Sea Island plantations. Major Pierce Butler hired Roswell King as the manager of his two plantations on St. Simon's Island and Butler Island. They had some conflicts as Butler wanted more moderate treatment of his slaves than was King's style. King left in 1820 to operate his own plantation near Darien. He also pursued plans in the 1830s to develop cotton mills in the Piedmont of Georgia, where he founded what became Roswell, Georgia in 1839. Butler House (demolished 1857), NW corner 8th & Chestnut Sts., Philadelphia Butler retired from politics in 1805 and spent much of his time in Philadelphia where he had previously established a summer home. His oldest daughter, Sarah, lived with her family and had three surviving sons before he died; two of whom would become Butler's heirs by irrevocably taking his surname. More than a decade prior to Butler's death, he disinherited his only surviving son Thomas Butler, together with his French-born wife and children. Butler became one of the wealthiest men in the United States, with huge land holdings in several states, through his business ventures. Like other Founding Fathers from his region, Butler also continued to support the institution of slavery. Some historians claim that he privately opposed slavery, and especially the international slave trade, but he tried to protect the institution as a politician because of its importance to the Southern economy. But, unlike Washington or Thomas Jefferson, for example, Butler never acknowledged the fundamental inconsistency in simultaneously defending the rights of the poor and supporting slavery. Associates referred to Butler as \\"eccentric\\" and an \\"enigma.\\" He followed his own path to produce the maximum of liberty and respect for those individuals whom he classed as citizens. He wanted to maintain a strong central government, but a government that could never ride roughshod over the rights of the private citizen. He opposed the policies of the Federalists under Alexander Hamilton because he believed they had sacrificed the interests of westerners and had sought to force their policies on the opposition. He later split with Jefferson and the Democrats for the same reason. Butler emphasized his belief in the role of the common man. Late in life he summarized his view: \\"Our System is little better than [a] matter of Experiment. ... much must depend on the morals and manners of the people at large.\\" Family Coat of Arms of Pierce Butler In January 1771, Butler married Mary Middleton (c. 1750‚Äì1790). She was the orphaned daughter of Thomas Middleton, a South Carolina planter and slave importer, and was heiress to a large fortune. The couple had eight children: * Sarah (c. 1772‚Äì1831), married 1800, James Mease of Philadelphia * Anne Elizabeth (1771‚Äì1845), unmarried * Frances (1774‚Äì1836), unmarried * Harriot Percy (c. 1775‚Äì1815), unmarried * Pierce Jr. (1777‚Äì1780) * Thomas (1778‚Äì1838), married 1812, Eliza de Mallevault of Paris * 3rd son, died young * 4th son, died young Butler disinherited his only surviving son, Thomas Butler, along with the son's French-born wife and children. Sarah Butler Mease was the only one of Butler's daughters to marry and have children. Butler initially planned to leave his whole fortune to her eldest son, Pierce Butler Mease, but the boy died in 1810 at age 9. Butler told Sarah that he would leave his estate in equal parts to her three surviving sons (including one born that year), provided that they would irrevocably adopt Butler as their surname. Two of her sons, John Mease and Pierce Butler Mease (born 1810 and named for the brother who died), changed their surnames order to inherit portions of the estate. Until the grandsons came of age, Butler's daughters Fraunces and Eliza had use of the most productive lands. In 1820 Major Butler hired Roswell King Jr. as the manager of the plantations, which continued to be enormously profitable. After Butler's death in 1822, King continued as manager of the estate, staying until 1838. After the two Mease grandsons came of age, adopted the surname Butler, and claimed their inheritance, King operated a plantation in Alabama. Legacy and honors * Major Pierce Butler and many of his descendants are buried in a vault in the cemetery of Christ Church, Philadelphia, built in 1727‚Äì1744 and a National Historic Landmark. * Butler Street in Madison, Wisconsin is named in his honor. Pierce Mease Butler Pierce Mease Butler and his wife, Frances Kemble Butler, 1855 Pierce Mease Butler (1810‚Äì1867) inherited half of his grandfather's Butler Island and St. Simons Island plantations. The famous English actress Fanny Kemble and her noted actor/manager father Charles Kemble made a 2-year theatrical tour of the United States, 1832‚Äì1834. Pierce Mease Butler met her during the tour, and married her on June 7, 1834. They lived in Philadelphia, and had two daughters, Sarah and Frances. Pierce Mease Butler took his family to Georgia for the winter of 1838‚Äì1839. Kemble was shocked at the living and working conditions for the slaves, and complained to him of their overwork and of the manager Roswell King Jr.'s treatment of them. She noted that King was known to have sired several mixed-race children with enslaved women, whom he sometimes took away from their husbands for periods of time. Kemble's firsthand experiences of the winter residence contributed to her growing abolitionism. The couple had increasing tensions over this and their basic incompatibility. Butler threatened to deny Kemble access to their daughters if she published anything of her observations about the plantation conditions.David, Deirdre. Fanny Kemble: A Performed Life, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 2007, p. 154 When they divorced in 1849, Pierce Mease Butler retained custody of their two daughters. Kemble waited until 1863, after the start of the American Civil War and her daughters had come of age, to publish Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838‚Äì1839. Her eyewitness indictment of slavery included an account of King's mixed-race children with slave women. The book was published in both the U.S. and England. Slave auction By mid-century, Pierce Mease Butler was one of the richest men in the United States, but he squandered a fortune estimated at $700,000. He was saved from bankruptcy by his sale on March 2‚Äì3, 1859 of his 436 slaves at Ten Broeck Racetrack, outside Savannah, Georgia. It was the largest single slave auction in United States history, and netted him more than $300,000. The auction was a notable event, and covered by national newspapers.\\"Great Auction of Slaves at Savannah, Georgia\\", New York Tribune, March 9, 1859, at American Memory, Library of Congress He sat out the Civil War in Philadelphia, a refuge for numerous Southerners, and was briefly imprisoned for treason, August‚ÄìSeptember 1861. John A. Mease Butler John A. Mease Butler (1806‚Äì1847) inherited half of his grandfather's plantations, after adopting \\"Butler\\" as his surname in 1831. He married Gabriella Morris, but they had no children. He served in the Mexican War, attaining the rank of captain, but died of dysentery in camp. Union forces occupied all of the Butler plantations, beginning in February 1862. The January 1, 1863 Emancipation Proclamation freed Gabriella Morris Butler's nearly 500 enslaved Africans. She died later that year. In the social and economic disruption of the postwar years, Pierce Mease Butler was unsuccessful in adapting to the free labor market, and amid a general agricultural depression he was unable to make a profit from the Sea Island plantations. Fourth and later generations After Pierce Mease Butler's death, his younger daughter Frances Butler Leigh and her husband James Leigh, a minister, tried to restore to productivity and operate the combined plantations, but were also unsuccessful in generating a profit. They left Georgia in 1877 and moved permanently to England, where Leigh had been born. Frances Butler Leigh defended her father's actions as a slaveholder in her book, Ten Years on a Georgian Plantation since the War (1883), intended as a rebuttal to her mother's critique of slavery from twenty years before. Pierce Mease Butler's elder daughter Sarah Butler Wister married a wealthy Philadelphia doctor, Owen Jones Wister, and they lived in the Germantown section of the city. Their son, Owen Wister, became a popular American novelist, best known for The Virginian, a 1902 western novel now considered a classic. The younger Owen Wister was the last of Major Butler's descendants to inherit the plantations. He wrote about the post-Civil War South in his 1906 novel, Lady Baltimore, which romanticized \\"the lost aristocrats of antebellum Charleston.\\" Wister's friend and former Harvard classmate, President Theodore Roosevelt, wrote to him criticizing the novel for making \\"nearly all the devils Northerners and the angels Southerners.\\"  See also  * Butler Island Plantation * Lynx Incident * List of United States Senators born outside the United States References and external links Notes Sources * Malcolm Bell Jr., Major Butler's Legacy: Five Generations of a Slaveholding Family (University of Georgia Press, 1987) * James H.

John Blair was one of the best-trained jurists of his day. A famous legal scholar, he avoided the tumult of state politics, preferring to work behind the scenes. But he was devoted to the idea of a permanent union of the newly independent states and loyally supported fellow Virginians James Madison and George Washington at the Constitutional Convention. His greatest contribution as a Founding Father came not in Philadelphia, but later as a judge on the Virginia court of appeals and on the U.S. Supreme Court, where he influenced the interpretation of the Constitution in a number of important decisions. Contemporaries praised Blair for such personal strengths as gentleness and benevolence, and for his ability to penetrate immediately to the heart of a legal question. Career Born in Williamsburg, Colony of Virginia Blair was a member of a prominent Virginia family. John Blair Sr., his father, served on the Virginia Council and was for a time acting Royal governor. His granduncle, James Blair, was founder and first president of the College of William & Mary. Blair attended William & Mary, receiving an A.B. in 1754. In 1755, he went to London to study law at the Middle Temple. Returning home to practice law, he was quickly thrust into public life, beginning his public career shortly after the close of the French and Indian War with his election to the seat reserved for the College of William and Mary in the House of Burgesses (1766‚Äì70). He went on to become clerk of the Royal Governor's Council, the upper house of the colonial legislature (1770‚Äì1775). Blair originally joined the moderate wing of the Patriot cause. He opposed Patrick Henry's extremist resolutions in protest of the Stamp Act, but the dissolution of the House of Burgesses by Parliament profoundly altered his views. In response to a series of taxes on the colonies passed by Parliament, Blair joined George Washington and others in 1770 and again in 1774 to draft nonimportation agreements which pledged their supporters to cease importing British goods until the taxes were repealed. In the latter year he reacted to the British Parliament's passage of the Intolerable Acts by joining those calling for a Continental Congress and pledging support for the people of Boston who were suffering economic hardship because of Parliament's actions. When the American Revolution began, Blair became deeply involved in the government of his state. He served as a member of the convention that drew up Virginia's constitution (1776) and held a number of important committee positions, including a seat on the Committee of 28 that framed the Virginia Declaration of Rights and plan of government. He served on the Privy Council, Governor Patrick Henry's major advisory group (1776‚Äì1778). The legislature elected him to a judgeship in the general court in 1778 and soon to the post of chief justice. He was also elected to Virginia's high court of chancery (1780), where his colleague was George Wythe, later a fellow delegate to the Constitutional Convention. The judicial appointments automatically made Blair a member of Virginia's first court of appeals. On the Virginia Court of Appeals, Blair participated in The Commonwealth of Virginia v. Caton et al. (1782), which set the precedent that courts can deem legislative acts unconstitutional. The decision was a precursor to the US Supreme Court decision Marbury v. Madison. In 1786, the legislature, recognizing Blair's prestige as a jurist, appointed him Thomas Jefferson's successor on a committee revising the laws of Virginia. While crossing on foot an old bridge over a flooded river en route home from the Convention, Blair and Washington narrowly escaped accident when one of the carriage horses fell through the bridge.\\"Founders of Freedom in America\\", David C. Whitney, 1965 George Washington nominated Blair to the Supreme Court of the United States on September 24, 1789, and the United States Senate confirmed the nomination two days later. He took the prescribed judicial oath on February 2, 1790. The Court's caseload during Blair's tenure was light, with only 13 cases decided over six years. However, Blair participated in the Court's landmark case of Chisholm v. Georgia, which is considered the first United States Supreme Court case of significance and impact. Blair resigned on October 25, 1795, and died in Williamsburg in 1800, at 68. He was buried at the Bruton Parish Episcopal Church Cemetery in Williamsburg.National Archives Blair was a Freemason. He was named Grand Master of Freemasons in Virginia under the newly organized Grand Lodge of Virginia in 1778. Blair Street in Madison, Wisconsin is named in his honor.http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/odd/archives/002071.asp See also * List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States * Jay Court  References  Further reading  * Flanders, Henry.

The top six goat industry groups in the United States include: meat (includes show), dairy (includes show, pygmy and Nigerian dwarf), fiber or hair (angora, cashmere), 4-H, industrial (weed control, hiking/pack), and biotech (see Goats in agriculture).

The group replaced Swingle's earlier \\"Swingle Singers\\", formed in 1962 in Paris, France with Anne Germain, Claude Germain, Jeanette Baucomont, Christiane Legrand, Claudine Meunier, Jean-Claude Briodin, and Jean Cussac. History The French group, directed originally by Ward Swingle (who once belonged to Mimi Perrin's French vocal group Les Double Six), began as session singers mainly doing background vocals for singers such as Charles Aznavour and Edith Piaf. Christiane Legrand, sister of Michel Legrand, was the original lead soprano with the group. The ensemble sang some jazz vocals for Michel Legrand. The eight session singers sang through Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier as a sight-reading exercise and found the music to have a natural swing. They recorded their first album Jazz S√©bastien Bach as a present for friends and relatives. Many radio stations picked it up and this led to the group recording more albums and winning a total of five Grammy Awards. The French group performed and recorded typically with only a double bass and drums as accompaniment. In 1973, Ward Swingle disbanded the original French group when he and his family moved to London. He later hired members who debuted as Swingle II with its initial emphasis moved from classical music to a cappella arrangements of madrigals and then on to other styles. The current group performs primarily, but not exclusively, a cappella and over the decades has explored a wide range of styles, from show tunes to rock to avant garde to world folkloric music to straight ahead jazz to classical, including the entire repertoire of the original Swingle Singers. The group performed and recorded under the name The Swingles, The New Swingle Singers, and The Swingle Singers before settling on The Swingles. Since Ward Swingle started the second group, it has never disbanded. Until 2011, the group consisted of eight voices: two sopranos, two altos, two tenors and two basses. As individual members have left the group, remaining members have held auditions for replacements. Ward Swingle continued as a performer in the group until retiring to the United States in 1984 and taking the role of \\"musical adviser\\" to the Swingles until his death in 2015. Performances An early hit for the group was Bach's \\"Air on the G String\\", recorded with the Modern Jazz Quartet; it has been used as the theme tune to a popular Italian TV Show, Superquark, as well as the Swedish Children's program, Beppe's Godnattstrund, hosted by Beppe Wolgers. Luciano Berio wrote his postmodern symphony Sinfonia for eight voices and orchestra in 1968 with the Swingle Singers in mind (appearing on the original premiere recording with the New York Philharmonic). They also premiered Berio's A-Ronne in 1974, which they later recorded. They also recorded Ben Johnston's \\"Sonnets of Desolation\\" in 1984. In 2005, their recording of Bach's Prelude in F Minor was incorporated into the hit single \\"They\\", by Jem Griffiths; the piece was also used in the 2006 film The Gigolos. The group's music has a trademark sound and is used frequently on television (The West Wing, Sex and the City, Miami Vice, Glee), in movies (Bach's Fugue in G Minor (BWV 578) in Thank You for Smoking, Mozart's \\"Horn Concerto No. 4\\" in Wedding Crashers, Bach's \\"Prelude No.7 in E flat [The Well Tempered Clavier ‚Äì Book 2 BWV 876]\\" in Milk). The London group sang with French pop star √âtienne Daho on his songs \\"Timide intimit√©\\" and \\"Soudain\\" from his 1996 album Eden, and with the Style Council on their song \\"The Story of Someone's Shoe\\" from the 1988 album Confessions of a Pop Group. They appeared several times on the BBC Television sketch show The Two Ronnies in the early 1970s. The Swingle Singers produce covers ranging from pop songs (Bj√∂rk, Annie Lennox and the Beatles) to classical music (Bach, Mozart) to Contemporary Music (Luciano Berio, Pascal Zavaro and Azio Corghi). Their arrangements are often infused with jazz harmonies and stylings. The Swingle Singers are curators of the London A Cappella Festival, based at Kings Place. In February 2020, the current members are: *Joanna Goldsmith-Eteson (soprano, UK) *Federica Basile (soprano, Italy) *Imogen Parry (alto, UK and daughter of former Swingle, Ben Parry) *Oliver Griffiths (tenor, UK) *Jon Smith (tenor, US) *Jamie Wright (baritone, UK) replaced Kevin Fox, who left in 2019. *Edward Randell (bass, UK) *Sound engineer: Hugh Walker (UK) In September 2011, Lucy Bailey (alto) left the group and the Swingle Singers announced the decision not to replace her, but to continue as a seven-person line-up. On 1 November 2011, both Christiane Legrand and Swingles composer Andr√© Hodeir died. Tobias Hug departed the group in 2012. That year, as BFG or Black Forest Ghetto (referencing his place of birth), he went on to found The Beatbox Collective, a London based human beatbox group who went on to becoming World Champions in the group or 'crew' category at the 2015 Beatbox World Championships in Berlin, Germany. He continued working internationally as a teacher, conductor, singer and beatboxer after studying a Masters Degree in Rhythmic Choir Conducting and Vocal Leadership ‚Äì a unique course only taught at the Royal Conservatory of Aarhus & Aalborg. After 2 years of treatment for Oesophageal cancer, during which he founded the Black Forest Voices international acapella festival, Tobias died in his hometown of Kirchzarten in January of 2020 a few days after his 44th birthday. In September 2014, the French blog Dans l'ombre des studios published Swingle Singers' Pavane for a Dead Princess (Maurice Ravel), a previously unreleased 1967 recording.R√©mi C., \\"Unreleased recording: \\"Pavane for a dead Princess\\" (Ravel) by The Swingle Singers (1967)\\", Dans l'ombre des studios, 28 September 2014.

In short, the shadow is the unknown side. From one perspective, the shadow \\"is roughly equivalent to the whole of the Freudian unconscious;\\"Anthony Stevens, On Jung (London 1990) p. 43 and Carl Jung himself asserted that \\"the result of the Freudian method of elucidation is a minute elaboration of man's shadow-side unexampled in any previous age.\\"Jung, C. G. 1993. The Practice of Psychotherapy. London. Contrary to a Freudian definition of shadow, however, the Jungian shadow can include everything outside the light of consciousness and may be positive or negative. Because one tends to reject or remain ignorant of the least desirable aspects of one's personality, the shadow is largely negative. There are, however, positive aspects that may also remain hidden in one's shadow (especially in people with low self-esteem, anxieties, and false beliefs).Young-Eisendrath, P. and T. Dawson. 1997. The Cambridge Companion to Jung. Cambridge University Press. p. 319. \\"Everyone carries a shadow,\\" Jung wrote, \\"and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and denser it is.\\"Jung, C.G. 1938. \\"Psychology and Religion.\\" In Psychology and Religion: West and East, Collected Works of C.G. Jung 11. p. 131 It may be, in part, one's link to more primitive animal instincts,Jung, C.G. 1952. \\"Answer to Job.\\" In Psychology and Religion: West and East, Collected Works of C.G. Jung 11. p. 12. which are superseded during early childhood by the conscious mind. Jung stated the shadow to be the unknown dark side of the personality.Roberts, Gwilym Wyn, and Andrew Machon. 2015. Appreciative Healthcare Practice: A guide to compassionate, person- centred care. M&K.; . p. 71. According to Jung, the shadow, in being instinctive and irrational, is prone to psychological projection, in which a perceived personal inferiority is recognized as a perceived moral deficiency in someone else. Jung writes that if these projections remain hidden, \\"the projection-making factor (the Shadow archetype) then has a free hand and can realize its object‚Äîif it has one‚Äîor bring about some other situation characteristic of its power.\\"Jung, C.G. 1951. \\"Phenomenology of the Self.\\" In The Portable Jung. p. 147. These projections insulate and harm individuals by acting as a constantly thickening veil of illusion between the ego and the real world. Appearance The shadow may appear in dreams and visions in various forms and typically \\"appears as a person of the same sex as that of the dreamer.\\"von Franz, Marie-Louise. [1964] 1978. \\"The Process of Individuation.\\" In Man and his Symbols, edited by C. G. Jung. London: Picador. . The shadow's appearance and role depend greatly on the living experience of the individual because much of the shadow develops in the individual's mind rather than simply being inherited in the collective unconscious. Nevertheless, some Jungians maintain that \\"the shadow contains, besides the personal shadow, the shadow of society...fed by the neglected and repressed collective values.\\"Fordham, Michael. 1978. Jungian Psychotherapy. Avon. p. 5. Interactions with the shadow in dreams may shed light on one's state of mind. A conversation with an aspect of the shadow may indicate that one is concerned with conflicting desires or intentions. Identification with a despised figure may mean that one has an unacknowledged difference from the character, a difference which could point to a rejection of the illuminating qualities of ego-consciousness. These examples refer to just two of many possible roles that the shadow may adopt and are not general guides to interpretation. Also, it can be difficult to identify characters in dreams‚Äî\\"all the contents are blurred and merge into one another...'contamination' of unconscious contents\\"‚Äîso that a character who seems at first to be a shadow might represent some other complex instead. Jung also made the suggestion of there being more than one layer making up the shadow. The top layers contain the meaningful flow and manifestations of direct personal experiences. These are made unconscious in the individual by such things as the change of attention from one thing to another, simple forgetfulness, or a repression. Underneath these idiosyncratic layers, however, are the archetypes which form the psychic contents of all human experiences. Jung described this deeper layer as \\"a psychic activity which goes on independently of the conscious mind and is not dependent even on the upper layers of the unconscious‚Äîuntouched, and perhaps untouchable‚Äîby personal experience.\\"Jung, C.G. The Structure and Dynamics of the Psyche. p. 148. Encountering the shadow The eventual encounter with the shadow plays a central part in the process of individuation. Jung considered that \\"the course of individuation...exhibits a certain formal regularity. Its signposts and milestones are various archetypal symbols\\" marking its stages; and of these \\"the first stage leads to the experience of the shadow.\\"Jacobi, J. 1946. The Psychology of C. G. Jung. London. p. 102. If \\"the breakdown of the persona constitutes the typical Jungian moment both in therapy and in development,\\"Homans, Peter. 1979. Jung in Context. London. p. 102. it is this that opens the road to the shadow within, coming about when \\"beneath the surface a person is suffering from a deadly boredom that makes everything seem meaningless and empty...as if the initial encounter with the Self casts a dark shadow ahead of time.\\" Jung considered as a perennial danger in life that \\"the more consciousness gains in clarity, the more monarchic becomes its content...the king constantly needs the renewal that begins with a descent into his own darkness\\"C. G. Jung, Mysterium Coniunctionis (London 1963)‚Äîhis shadow‚Äîwhich the \\"dissolution of the persona\\" sets in motion.Jung, C. G. 1953. Two Essays on Analytical Psychology. London. p. 277. \\"The shadow personifies everything that the subject refuses to acknowledge about himself\\"Jung, C.G. The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious (London 1996). and represents \\"a tight passage, a narrow door, whose painful constriction no one is spared who goes down to the deep well.\\" > [If and when] an individual makes an attempt to see his shadow, he becomes > aware of (and often ashamed of) those qualities and impulses he denies in > himself but can plainly see in others‚Äîsuch things as egotism, mental > laziness, and sloppiness; unreal fantasies, schemes, and plots; carelessness > and cowardice; inordinate love of money and possessions‚Äî...[a] painful and > lengthy work of self-education. The dissolution of the persona and the launch of the individuation process also brings with it \\"the danger of falling victim to the shadow ... the black shadow which everybody carries with him, the inferior and therefore hidden aspect of the personality\\"Jung, C. G. 1954. \\"Psychology of the Transference.\\" In Practice of Psychotherapy, Collected Works 16. London. p. 219.‚Äîresulting in a merger with the shadow. Merging with the shadow According to Jung, the shadow sometimes overwhelms a person's actions; for example, when the conscious mind is shocked, confused, or paralyzed by indecision. \\"A man who is possessed by his shadow is always standing in his own light and falling into his own traps...living below his own level.\\" Hence, in terms of the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, \\"it must be Jekyll, the conscious personality, who integrates the shadow ... and not vice versa. Otherwise the conscious becomes the slave of the autonomous shadow.\\"Stevens, Jung p. 50 Individuation inevitably raises that very possibility.

Nevertheless, Jung remained of the opinion that while \\"no one should deny the danger of the descent...every descent is followed by an ascent ... enantiodromia;\\"Jung, C. G. Symbols of Transformation (London 1956) pp. 357, 375 and assimilation of‚Äîrather than possession by‚Äîthe shadow becomes at last a real possibility. Assimilation of the shadow Enantiodromia launches a different perspective. \\"We begin to travel [up] through the healing spirals...straight up.\\" Here the struggle is to retain awareness of the shadow, but not identification with it. \\"Non-identification demands considerable moral effort [which] prevents a descent into that darkness\\"; and though \\"the conscious mind is liable to be submerged at any moment in the unconscious...understanding acts like a life-saver. It integrates the unconscious.\\"Jung, \\"Psychology\\" pp. 260, 266, and 269 This reincorporates the shadow into the personality, producing a stronger, wider consciousness than before. \\"Assimilation of the shadow gives a man body, so to speak,\\" thereby providing a launch pad for further individuation. \\"The integration of the shadow, or the realization of the personal unconscious, marks the first stage in the analytic process ... without it a recognition of anima and animus is impossible.\\"Jung, C. G. Aion: Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self. (London 1959) p. 22 Conversely, \\"to the degree in which the shadow is recognised and integrated, the problem of the anima, i.e., of relationship, is constellated,\\" and becomes the centre of the individuation quest. Carolyn Kaufman wrote that \\"in spite of its function as a reservoir for human darkness‚Äîor perhaps because of this‚Äîthe shadow is the seat of creativity;\\"Kaufman, Carolyn. \\"Three-Dimensional Villains: Finding Your Character's Shadow.\\" Archetype Writing: The Writer's Guide to Psychology. so that for some, it may be that \\"the dark side of his being, his sinister shadow...represents the true spirit of life as against the arid scholar.\\"Jung, C. G.

(1994) Profile: Fang Lizhi ‚Äì Fundamental Rights, Fundamental Physics, Scientific American 270(5), 39-40. Because of his activism, he was expelled from the Communist Party of China in January 1987. For his work, Fang was a recipient of the Robert F Kennedy Human Rights Award in 1989, given each year to an individual whose courageous activism is at the heart of the human rights movement and in the spirit of Robert F. Kennedy's vision and legacy. He was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1980, but it was revoked after 1989. Life and career in China Fang was born on 12 February 1936 in Beijing. His father worked on the railway. In 1948, a year before the People's Liberation Army took over the city, as a student of the Beijing No. 4 High School, he joined an underground youth organization that was associated to Chinese Communist Party (CCP). One of his extracurricular activities was assembling radio receivers from used parts. In 1952, he enrolled in the Physics Department at Peking University, where he met his future wife, Li Shuxian (). Both Fang and Li were among the top students in their class. He joined CCP upon graduation, worked the Institute of Modern Physics and became involved in China's secret atomic bomb program, while Li stayed at Peking University as a junior faculty. In 1957, during the Hundred Flowers Campaign, people were strongly encouraged by the CCP to openly express their opinions and criticisms. As party members, Li, Fang and another person in the physics department planned to write a letter to the party to offer their suggestions on education. This letter was still unfinished by the time the Hundred Flowers Campaign abruptly came to an end and the Anti-Rightist Campaign started. The opinions and criticisms solicited during the earlier campaign were then interpreted as \\"attacks on the party\\", and those who expressed such opinions were labelled \\"rightist\\" and persecuted. Although no one knew about the unfinished letter, out of loyalty to the party, the three naive young people confessed about it, and Li also confessed to the party her doubts on the party. Li was expelled from the party, and was sentenced to hard labour at Zhaitang near Beijing. Fang was not immediately expelled from the party, because he played a lesser role in writing the letter, and also because he had left Peking University, where the punishment was particularly severe. Still, he was removed from the nuclear program, and sent to do hard labour in Zanhuang, Hebei province from December 1957 to August 1958. Out of political pressure, Li and Fang put their relationship on hold until early 1959, when Fang was also expelled from the party. Fang was reassigned to the faculty of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in August 1958, and in 1961 married Li, who remained a faculty of Peking University. In spite of his experience in the anti-Rightist campaign, he published an article in the Guangming Daily, encouraging the independent thinking of students. Fang published his first research paper on nuclear physics in Acta Physica Sinica 17, p. 57 (1961) under the pseudonym Wang Yunran, since as a rightist he was not entitled to publish research papers. Later, on the recommendation of Qian Linzhao, he became an associated member of a research group led by Li Yinyuan at the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Since Li's group was at a different institute, this arrangement took advantage of a loophole in management rules, allowing him to publish papers under his own name. In the late 1950s/early 1960s, Fang conducted research in particle physics, solid state physics and laser physics. By 1965, he had published 13 research papers and was considered one of the most productive physics researchers in China. That year, as part of the effort of cleansing Peking of \\"undesirable elements\\", Fang was to be removed from the faculty of USTC and sent to work in an electronics factory in Liaoning province. Learning about this, vice president Yan Jici intervened on Fang's behalf; he pleaded the case to the party secretary of USTC at the time, Liu Da, who cancelled the cleansing order for Fang and other faculty members of USTC. Academic activities were interrupted when the Cultural Revolution broke out in 1966. In 1969, along with other universities and research institutes, the USTC was ordered to be evacuated out of Beijing, ostensibly in anticipation of an impending Soviet Union invasion. USTC was moved to Hefei, the capital of Anhui Province, where it remains to this day. Upon arriving in Hefei in 1969, Fang, along with other \\"problematic members\\" of the faculty, were sent to do hard labour for \\"re- education by the worker class\\" in a coal mine. Fang secretly brought with him one physics book, the \\"Classical Theory of Fields\\" by Lev Landau and learned the theory of general relativity by reading this book in the evening. Later, in 1971, along with a number of other faculty members, he was assigned to do labour work in a brick factory, which produced the bricks for constructing the USTC university buildings. Research in astrophysics and cosmology In 1972, the worst chaos of the Cultural Revolution was over and scientific research resumed. Fang found an opportunity to read some recent astrophysics papers in western journals, and soon wrote his first paper on cosmology, \\"A Cosmological Solution in Scalar-tensor Theory with Mass and Blackbody Radiation\\", which was published on the journal Wu Li (Physics), Vol. 1, 163 (1972). This was the first modern cosmological research paper in mainland China. Fang assembled a group of young faculty members of USTC around him to conduct astrophysics research. At the time, conducting research on relativity theory and cosmology in China was very risky politically, because these theories were considered to be \\"idealistic\\" theories in contradiction with the dialectical materialism theory, which is the official philosophy of the Communist Party. According to the dialectical materialism philosophy, both time and space must be infinite, while the Big Bang theory allows the possibility of the finiteness of space and time. During the Cultural Revolution, campaigns were waged against Albert Einstein and the Theory of Relativity in Beijing and Shanghai. Once Fang published his theory, some of the critics of the Theory of Relativity, especially a group based in Shanghai, prepared to attack Fang politically. However, by this time the \\"leftist\\" line was declining in the Chinese academia. Professor Dai Wensai, the most well-known Chinese astronomer at the time and chair of the Astronomy Department of Nanjing University, also supported Fang. Many of the members of the \\"Theory of Relativity Criticism Group\\" changed to study the theory and conduct research in it. Subsequently, Fang was regarded as the father of cosmological research in China. Nevertheless, in the 1980s and even as late as the 1990s, articles criticizing the Big Bang theory as \\"pseudo-science from the west ... in violation of the principles of Marxism philosophy\\", and \\"politically incorrect\\" still appeared frequently in newspapers and magazines in paper. Fang published a large number of papers on astrophysics and cosmology. In the late 1970s, he and his group used the luminosity of selected radio quasars to measure the Hubble diagram, and with data available at the time, suggested that the universe may be closed (Fang et al., Acta Astronomica Sinica 17, 134 (1977)). This work was noticed by researchers outside China; a Nature article noted that it obtained similar results to, but appeared earlier than, the paper by Davidsen et al., Nature 269, 203 (1977). Fang also carried out research on topics including neutron stars, black holes, inflation and quantum cosmology. He soon gained international recognition, and as China began to open up in the late 1970s, he was invited to international conferences outside the country. In 1985, together with H. Sato of Kyoto University, Japan, Fang won the first prize of the Gravity Research Foundation essay competition by proposing that the periodic distribution of quasars observed can be explained if the Universe is multiply-connected, i.e. has a non-trivial topology. He was elected as the youngest member of the Chinese Academy of Science in 1980. His membership was, however, revoked after the Tiananmen Square protest of 1989. He helped promote international academic exchange in China. Together with Remo Ruffini, he organized the first major international scientific conference in China: the 3rd Marcel Grossmann meeting in 1982. During this meeting, Tsvi Piran and T.G. Horowitz became the first two Israeli scientists to enter the People's Republic of China; at the time, there were no diplomatic relations between China and Israel. He invited Stephen Hawking to visit China in 1985, and organized the International Astronomical Union conference IAU-124 on \\"Observational Cosmology\\" in Beijing in 1986. Fang also trained many younger colleagues and students in the field of astrophysics and cosmology; he was considered an excellent teacher. Fang and Li coauthored \\"Introduction to Mechanics\\", an introductory book on Newtonian mechanics and special theory of relativity. This book has been considered a classic by many teachers and students, although few students are aware of it in recent years. Fang was also the first scientist in China to write popular accounts of contemporary astrophysical developments, such as cosmology and black holes. Fang's book, \\"Creation of the Universe\\" (Yuzhou de chuangsheng in Chinese) which was published in 1987, introduced basic cosmological ideas, and influenced a large number of physics and astronomy students growing up in the 1980s in China. Political activism During the Anti-Rightist Campaign, Fang was expelled from the Communist Party of China for his \\"reactionary activities\\", viz. publishing an article critical of the government's policies on science education. He was rehabilitated after the reform of China in late 1970s, and resumed his party membership. During this time, he held many academic positions, including the director of the astrophysics research group of USTC, and director of the science history research group, chief editor of the USTC academic journal, chair of the Chinese society of gravity and relativistic astrophysics. In 1984, Fang was appointed as the vice president of the USTC under president Guan Weiyan. Fang was very active in this role; for example he helped to set up the telex service for USTC. He was very popular among the students. Fang also begin to write essays for publication in popular magazines, and give lectures on a variety of topics in universities, though usually not in USTC. Many such essays and lectures expressed his liberal view on politics, reflections on history, and criticisms on CCP dogma. He also emphasized social responsibility of intellectuals. In late 1986, Fang, together with Xu Liangying and Liu Binyan, wrote letters to a number of well- known \\"Rightists\\" from the 1957 Anti-Rightist campaign, suggesting a meeting in memory of that event. In December 1986, college students demonstrated in over a dozen Chinese cities in demanding greater economic and political freedoms. Fang was against the student demonstration, believing it would be suppressed by the CCP; he tried to persuade the USTC students not to go off- campus. After two straight weeks of student demonstrations, believing that the student movement was a result of \\"bourgeois liberalization\\", Deng Xiaoping named three Communist Party members to be expelled: Fang, Liu Binyan and Wang Ruowang. Deng directed then-CCP General Secretary Hu Yaobang to expel them from the Party, but Hu refused. Because of his refusal, Hu was dismissed from his position as General Secretary in January 1987, effectively ending his period of influence within the Chinese government.Lee, Khoon Choy. Pioneers of Modern China: Understanding the Inscrutable Chinese. Singapore: World Scientific Publishing. 2005. pp.313-314; . Fang was again expelled from Communist Party of China in January 1987, and removed from his position as the vice president of the university. He was moved to Beijing as a research scientist at the Beijing Astronomical Observatory, now a part of the National Astronomical Observatory of China, and reunited with his wife, Li Shuxian, a professor at Peking University. He gained fame and notoriety after his essays were collected by the Communist Party of China and distributed to many of its regional offices, with the directive to its members to criticize the essays. 1989 democracy movement and exile In February 1989, Fang mobilized a number of well known intellectuals to write an open letter to Deng Xiaoping, requesting amnesty for the human right activist Wei Jingsheng who was then in prison. His wife, Li, was elected to become the people's representative of the Haidian District where Peking University is located. Fang and his wife had exchanged ideas about Chinese politics with some students of Peking University, including Wang Dan and Liu Gang. Some of those students became student leaders during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, though Fang and Li did not actively participate in the protest itself. On 5 June 1989, the day after the government began its repression of protesters, Fang and Li, feeling unsafe, entered the U.S. embassy in Beijing, and were granted asylum. The Chinese government put Fang and Li at the top of the \\"wanted\\" list of the people involved in the protest. During his time in the U.S. embassy, Fang wrote an essay titled The Chinese Amnesia,The Chinese Amnesia, New York Review of Books, 1990. criticizing the Chinese Communist Party's repression of human rights and the outside world's turning a blind eye to it. Fang's continued presence in the US Embassy following the protests became, according to Ambassador James Lilley, \\"a living symbol of our [US] conflict with China over human rights.\\" Fang and his wife remained in the US Embassy until 25 June 1990, when they were allowed by Chinese authorities to leave the embassy and board a U.S. Air Force C-135 transport plane to Britain.Lilley, James. China Hands. New York: Public Affairs, 2004. . This resolution partly came about after confidential negotiations between Henry Kissinger, acting on behalf of US President George H.W. Bush, and China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.Spence, Jonathan D. Kissinger and China, The New York Review of Books, June 2011. Other factors were a false confession by Fang, an attempted intervention by US National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, and an offer from the Japanese government to resume loans to the PRC in return for the resolution of \\"the Fang Lizhi problem.\\"\\"My \\"Confession\\", Fang Lizhi, translated by Perry Link. The New York Review of Books, 2011. In 1989, he was a recipient of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award. In 1991, he gave a conference on the issue of Tibet in New York, one of the first open dialogues between Chinese and Tibetans. He also was an advisor for the International Campaign for Tibet.Bhuchung K. Tsering, Fang Lizhi was right about Tibet and China, 9 April 2012 Later life in the US After some time at Cambridge University and Princeton, Fang later moved to Tucson, Arizona, where he worked as Professor of Physics at the University of Arizona. In campus speeches Fang spoke on topics such as human rights and democracy as matters of social responsibility. He also served as a board member and co-chair of the New York- based organization Human Rights in China. Fang continued to do research in astrophysics and cosmology. He published research papers even during his stay in the US Embassy in Beijing. His later research includes the study of non- Gaussianity in the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, Lyman alpha forest, application of wavelet in cosmology, turbulence in intergalactic medium, and the 21cm radiation during the Reionization. He continued to train students and younger scientists who visited him from China and was very active in research to the end of his life, publishing multiple research papers each year.

He was a leading Anti-Federalist, along with Patrick Henry and George Mason, whose actions helped passage of the Bill of Rights. Early life  Martin was an early advocate of American independence from Great Britain. In the fall of 1774, as a resident of Somerset County, Maryland, he served on the county's patriot committee, and in December attended a convention of the Province of Maryland in Annapolis, which had been called to consider the recommendations of the American Congress. He went to the College of New Jersey (Princeton) and graduated with honors in 1766. Constitutional convention In 1785, he was elected to the Confederation Congress by the Maryland General Assembly, but his numerous public and private duties prevented him from traveling to Philadelphia. Martin was elected as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 in Philadelphia. When he arrived on June 9, 1787, he expressed suspicion of the secrecy rule imposed on the proceedings. He also opposed the creation of a government in which the large states would dominate the small ones, he consistently sided with the small states, helping to formulate the New Jersey Plan and voting against the Virginia Plan. On June 27, Martin spoke for more than three hours in opposition to the Virginia Plan's proposal for proportionate representation in both houses of the legislature. He is known for his warm opposition to the development of a strong central government, as well. He was known for his ability to talk and as stated by William Pierce \\"he was educated for the Bar... and he never speaks without tiring the patience of all who hear him.\\" Martin served on the committee formed to seek a compromise on representation, where he supported the case for equal numbers of delegates in at least one house. Before the convention closed, he became convinced that the new government would have too much power over state governments and would threaten individual rights. Failing to find any support for a bill of rights, Martin and another Maryland delegate, John Francis Mercer, walked out of the convention on September 3, 1787. He was one of the most vocal opponents of slavery at the Constitutional Convention, denouncing it as \\"an odious bargain with sin\\" that was \\"inconsistent with the principles of the revolution and dishonorable to the American character.\\" Ratification fight In November 1787, in a speech to the Maryland House of Delegates, he assailed the Constitutional Convention, not only for what it was attempting to do, but also for how it was going about the job. He broke the pledge to secrecy under which the convention had met and informed the Maryland legislators that the convention had violated its instructions to meet \\"for the sole and express purpose of revising\\" the Articles of Confederation. Instead, convention delegates had taken it upon themselves to make a fresh start by creating an entirely new system of government. To Martin, such an effort was akin to launching a coup d'√©tat. George Washington and Benjamin Franklin had backed the change of direction of the convention, but, Martin said, we should not \\"suffer our eyes to be so far dazzled by the splendor of names, as to run blindfolded into what may be our destruction.\\" In an address to the Maryland House of Delegates in November 1787 and in numerous newspaper articles, Martin attacked the proposed new form of government and continued to fight ratification of the Constitution through 1788. He lamented the ascension of the national government over the states and condemned what he saw as unequal representation in Congress. He owned six slaves of his own but opposed including slaves in determining representation (most slave owners supported counting slaves for the purposes of determining representation - as this would increase the power of Slave States) and believed that the absence of a jury in the U.S. Supreme Court gravely endangered freedom. At the convention, Martin complained, the aggrandizement of particular states and individuals often had been pursued more avidly than the welfare of the country. The assumption of the term \\"federal\\" by those who favored a national government also irritated Martin. Maryland largely ignored Martin's warnings. In April 1788, it voted to ratify the Constitution, the seventh state to do so. In June, when New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify, the required threshold had been reached, and the new Constitution took effect. Three years later, the first 10 amendments were added. Around 1791, however, Martin turned to the Federalist Party because of his animosity toward Thomas Jefferson, who, in 1807, spoke of him as the \\"Federal Bull-Dog.\\" Legal career Martin graduated Princeton for postwar law practice grew to become one of the largest and most successful in the country. The beginning of the 1800s saw Martin as defense counsel in two controversial national cases. In the first case, Martin won an acquittal for his close friend Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in his impeachment trial in 1805. Two years later, Martin was one of Aaron Burr's defense lawyers when Burr stood trial for treason in 1807. After a record 28 consecutive years as state attorney general, Martin resigned in December 1805. In 1813, he became chief judge of the court of oyer and terminer for the City and County of Baltimore. He was reappointed attorney general of Maryland in 1818, and, in 1819, he argued Maryland's position in the landmark Supreme Court case McCulloch v. Maryland. The plaintiffs were represented by Daniel Webster, William Pinkney and William Wirt. Martin's fortunes declined dramatically in his last years. Alcoholism, illness, and poverty weighted heavily on Martin, taking their toll as he aged. By the mid-1820s, he was subsisting on a special tax imposed on Maryland lawyers solely for his personal support. Eventually, he was taken in by Aaron Burr, whom he had defended at this disgraced ex-vice president's 1807 trial for treason. By this time, detestation of Thomas Jefferson, his one-time decentralist ally, led Martin to embrace the Federalist Party, in apparent repudiation of everything he had argued for so strenuously. Paralysis, which had struck in 1819, forced him to retire as Maryland's attorney general in 1822. On July 8, 1826, at the age of 78, he died in Aaron Burr's home in New York City and was buried in an unmarked grave in St. John's churchyard. His death came four days after the deaths on July 4 of Jefferson and John Adams. Martin married Maria Cresap (daughter of Captain Michael Cresap) on Christmas Day 1783. Of their five children, three daughters lived to adulthood. An extended display of his eloquence and volubility appears in \\"Modern Gratitude in Five Numbers: Addressed to Richard Raynall Keene, Esq. Concerning a Family Marriage\\" (1802)‚Äîa closely documented, fiercely argued (and partly autobiographical) denunciation of a former prot√©g√© who, against Martin's express wishes, had wooed and married Martin's daughter Eleonora.

The TijƒÅniyyah order is also present in the state of Kerala in India. Its adherents are called TijƒÅnƒ´ (spelled Tijaan or Tiijaan in Wolof, Tidiane or Tidjane in French). TijƒÅnƒ´ place great importance on culture and education, and emphasize the individual adhesion of the disciple (murƒ´d). To become a member of the order, one must receive the TijƒÅnƒ´ wird, or a sequence of holy phrases to be repeated twice daily, from a muqaddam, or representative of the order. History and spread of the order Foundation of the order Ahmad al-Tijani (1737‚Äì1815) was born in A√Øn Madhi in present-day Algeria and died in Fes, Morocco. He received his religious education in Fes, Morocco. Inspired by other Moroccan saints he founded the TijƒÅnƒ´ order in the 1780s; sources vary as to the exact date between 1781see Triaud, 2000 and 1784. TijƒÅnƒ´s, speaking for the poor, reacted against the then-dominant conservative, hierarchical Qadiriyyah brotherhood, focusing on social reform and grassroots Islamic revival. al-Tijani said: \\"My two feet you can see here are set on the nape of the neck of any saint.\\" Muhammad el Ghali, a prominent companion of al-Tijani‚Äôs, noted to him that Abdul Qadir Jilani had said a similar sentence, to which al-Tijani replied, \\"He was perfectly right to say such a thing, but he was talking about the saints of his time, as for me, I repeat it again: My two feet that you can see here, have never ceased being on the nape of the neck of every saint.\\" During the first period, some of al-Tijani's adherents appointed khalifas, established new Tijani centres abroad, and developed ramifications of their own: * the centres of Sidi Mohammed al-Ghali Boutaleb (d. 1829) and Sidi Alfa Hachim al-Futi (d. 1934) in Medina Munawwara * the centres of Sidi al-Mufaddal Saqqat, Sidi Mohammed b. Abdelwahid Bannani al-Misri (d. after 1854), and Sidi Mohammed al-Hafidh al-Misri (d. 1983) in Egypt * the centres of Shaykh al- Islam Sidi Ibrahim Riyahi Tunsi (d. 1851), Sidi Mohammed b.

Aissa Tamacini (d. 1845) in Algeria Expansion in West Africa Although several other Sufi orders overshadow the TijƒÅniyyah in its birthplace of North Africa, the order has become the largest Sufi order in West Africa and continues to expand rapidly. It was brought to southern Mauritania around 1789 by Mu·∏•ammad al-·∏§ƒÅfi·∫ì of the 'Idaw \`Ali tribe, which was known for its many Islamic scholars and leaders and was predominantly QƒÅdirƒ´ at the time. Nearly the entire tribe became TijƒÅnƒ´ during Mu·∏•ammad al-·∏§ƒÅfi·∫ì's lifetime, and the tribe's influence would facilitate the TijƒÅniyya's rapid expansion to sub- Saharan Africa. Mu·∏•ammad al-·∏§ƒÅfi·∫ì's disciple Sidi Mawl≈´d VƒÅl initiated the 19th-century Fulbe leader Al-·∏§ƒÅjj Umar Tall (Allaaji Omar Taal) and the Fulbe cleric \`Abd al-Karƒ´m an-NƒÅqil from Futa Jalon (modern Guinea) into the order. After receiving instruction from Mu·∏•ammad al-GhƒÅlƒ´ from 1828 to 1830 in Makka, Umar Tall was appointed Khalƒ´fa (successor or head representative) of A·∏•med at-TijƒÅnƒ´ for all of the Western Sudan (Western sub-Saharan Africa). Umar Tall then led a holy war against what he saw as corrupt regimes in the area, resulting in a large but fleeting empire in Eastern Senegal and Mali. While Umar Tall's political empire soon gave way to French colonialism, the more long-standing result was to spread Islam and the TijƒÅnƒ´ Order through much of what is now Senegal, Guinea, and Mali (see Robinson, 1985). In Senegal's Wolof country, especially the northern regions of Kajoor and Jolof, the TijƒÅnƒ´ Order was spread primarily by El-Hajj Malick Sy (spelled \\"El-Hadji Malick Sy\\" in French, \\"Allaaji Maalig Si\\" in Wolof), born in 1855 near Dagana. In 1902, he founded a zƒÅwiya (religious center) in Tivaouane (Tiwaawan), which became a center for Islamic education and culture under his leadership. Upon Malick Sy's death in 1922, his son Ababacar Sy (Abaabakar Sy) became the first Khalƒ´fa (Xaliifa). Serigne Mansour Sy became the present Khalƒ´f in 1997, upon the death of Abdoul Aziz Sy. The G√†mmu (Mawlid) in Arabic, the celebration of the birth of Muhammad) of Tivaouane gathers many followers each year. The \\"house\\" or branch of Tivaouane is not the only branch of the TijƒÅnƒ´ order in Senegal. The TijƒÅnƒ´ order was spread to the south by another jihadist, M√†bba Jaxu Ba, a contemporary of Umar Tall who founded a similar Islamic state in Senegal's Saalum area. After M√†bba was defeated and killed at The Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune fighting against Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof, his state crumbled but the TijƒÅniyya remained the predominant Sufi order in the region, and Abdoulaye Niass (1840‚Äì1922) became the most important representative of the order in the Saalum, having immigrated southward from the Jolof and, after exile in Gambia due to tensions with the French, returned to establish a zƒÅwiya in the city of Kaolack. The branch founded by Abdoulaye Niass's son, Al-Hadj Ibrahima Niass (Allaaji Ibrayima √ëas, often called \\"Baye\\" or \\"Baay\\", which is \\"father\\" in Wolof), in the Kaolack suburb of Medina Baye in 1930, has become by far the largest and most visible TijƒÅnƒ´ branch around the world today. Ibrahima Niass's teaching that all disciples, and not only specialists, can attain a direct mystical knowledge of God through tarbiyyah r≈´hiyyah (mystical education) has struck a chord with millions worldwide. This branch, known as the TijƒÅniyyah IbrƒÅhƒ´miyyah or the Failah (\\"Flood\\"), is most concentrated in Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, Niger, and Mauritania, and has a growing presence in the United States and Europe. Most TijƒÅnƒ´ web sites and international organizations are part of this movement. Sheikh Ibrahima Niass's late grandson and former Imam of Medina Baye, Shaykh Hassan Cisse, has thousands of American disciples and has founded a large educational and developmental organization, the African American Islamic Institute, in Medina Baye with branches in other parts of the world. Another Senegalese \\"house,\\" in Medina-Gounass, Senegal (to the west of the Niokolo Koba park) was created by Mamadou Saidou Ba. Still another in Thienaba, near Thies, was founded by the disciple of a famous marabout of Fouta, Amadou Sekhou. The Hamawiyyah branch, founded by Shaykh Hamallah, is centered in Nioro, Mali, and is also present in Senegal, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and Niger. One of its most prominent members is the novelist and historian Amadou Hamp√¢t√© B√¢, who preserved and advocated the teachings of Tierno Bokar Salif Taal (Cerno Bokar Salif Taal), the \\"Sage of Banjagara\\". (See Louis Brenner, 1984, 2000.) It was Cherno Muhammadou Jallow along with Sheikh Oumar Futi Taal who first received the tarikha Tijaniyya in the senegambia region. Cherno Muhammadou waited for the tarikha for over twelve years in Saint Louis Senegal, where Sheikh Oumar Futi Taal sent his Student Cherno Abubakr. He (Cherno Muhammadou) started spreading it in the Senegambia region. Through Oral history, it is said he (Cherno Muhammadou) Passed it to twelve disciples. These disciples range from Mam Mass Kah of Medina Mass Kah, Abdoulaye Niass of medina Kaolock, Cherno Alieu Deme Of NDiaye Kunda Senegal, Cherno Alieu Diallo of Djanet In Kolda to name a few. through these disciples the tarikha spread through the Senegambia region and beyond. Most of these disciples today have loads of followers and all of them are doing the LAAZIM daily. Cherno Muhammadou passed it to his son Cherno Omar Who later passed to his son Cherno Muhammadou Baba Jallow who later went on looking for his grandfather (Cherno Muhammadou Jallow) Whom he later found in the Cassamance. After discovering his grandfathers grave, Cherno Baba created a community and named it Sobouldeh and started an annual Ziarre where thousands converge to honor him yearly. Practices Members of the TijƒÅnƒ´ order distinguish themselves by a number of practices. Upon entering the order, one receives the TijƒÅnƒ´ wird from a muqaddam or representative of the order. The muqaddam explains to the initiate the duties of the order, which include keeping the basic tenets of Islam (including the five pillars of Islam), to honor and respect one's parents, and not to follow another Sufi order in addition to the TijƒÅniyya. Initiates are to pronounce the TijƒÅnƒ´ wird (a process that usually takes ten to fifteen minutes) every morning and afternoon. The wird is a formula that includes repetitions of \\"LƒÅ 'ilƒÅha 'illa LlƒÅh\\" (\\"There is no God but Allah\\"), \\"Astaghfiru LlƒÅh\\" (\\"I ask God for forgiveness\\"), and a prayer for Mu·∏•ammad called the ·π¢alƒÅtu l-FƒÅti·∏• (Prayer of the Opener). They are also to participate in the Wa·∫ìƒ´fah, a similar formula that is chanted as a group, often at a mosque, or Zawiyah once on a daily basis, as well as in the ·∏§a·∏çarat al-Jum øah, Hailalat al-Jum'ah another formula chanted among other disciples on Friday afternoon before the sun down. Additionally, disciples in many areas organize regular meetings, often on Thursday evenings or before or after Wa·∫ìƒ´fa and ·∏§a·∏çarat al-Jum øah, to engage in dhikr AllƒÅh, or remembrance of God. This consists in repeating the phrase \\"LƒÅ 'ilƒÅha 'illa LlƒÅh\\" or simply \\"AllƒÅh\\" as a group. In such meetings, poems praising God, Muhammad, A·∏•med at-TijƒÅnƒ´, or another religious leader may be interspersed with the dhikr. Such meetings may involve simple repetition as a group or call-response, in which one or more leaders lead the chant and others repeat or otherwise respond. Occasionally, a group of disciples (known in Senegal as a daayira, from Arabic dƒÅ'irah, or \\"circle\\") may organize a religious conference, where they will invite one or more well known speakers or chanters to speak on a given theme, such as the life of Mu·∏•ammad or another religious leader, a particular religious obligation such as fasting during Ramadan, or the nature of God. The most important communal event of the year for most TijƒÅnƒ´ groups is the Mawlid an-nabawƒ´ (known in Wolof as the G√†mmu, spelled Gamou in French), or the celebration of the birth of Mu·∏•ammad, which falls on the night of the 12th of the Islamic month of Rabƒ´ ø al-'Awwal (which means the night before the 12th, as Islamic dates start at sundown and not at midnight). Most major TijƒÅnƒ´ religious centers organize a large Mawlid event once a year, and hundreds of thousands of disciples attend the largest ones (in Tivaouane, Kaolack, Prang, Chiota, Kano, Fadama, etc.) Throughout the year, local communities organize smaller Mawlid celebrations. These meetings usually go from about midnight until shortly after dawn and include hours of dhikr and poetry chanting and speeches about the life of Mu·∏•ammad.

Sherwood's 1935 Broadway drama of the same name. The motion picture stars Leslie Howard, Bette Davis and Humphrey Bogart.The Petrified Forest page, Internet Broadway Database, undated. Retrieved May 21, 2009. The screenplay was written by Delmer Daves and Charles Kenyon, and adaptations were later performed on radio and television. The film is set in Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona. Plot thumb In the midst of the Great Depression, Alan Squier (Howard), a failed British writer, now a disillusioned, penniless drifter, wanders into a somewhat frowzy roadside diner in the remote town of Black Mesa, Arizona, at the edge of the Petrified Forest. The diner is run by Jason Maple (Porter Hall), his daughter Gabrielle (Davis), and Gramp, Jason's father (Charley Grapewin), who regales anyone who will listen with stories of his adventures in the Old West with such characters as Billy the Kid. Gabrielle's mother, a French war bride who fell in love with Jason when he was a young, handsome American serviceman, left her \\"dull defeated man\\" after World War I and moved back to France when Gabrielle was a baby. She now sends poetry to Gabrielle, who dreams of moving to Bourges, where her parents first met, to become an artist. Alan tells his story‚Äîhow he wrote one novel, then lived in France for eight years with his publisher's wife, trying to write another‚Äîand Gabrielle is instantly smitten with him. thumb Gabrielle shows Alan her paintings‚Äîthe first time she has shown them to anyone‚Äîand reads him a favorite Fran√ßois Villon poem. Boze Hertzlinger (Dick Foran), a beefy diner employee who has wooed Gabrielle in vain, grows jealous of Alan, who decides to leave forthwith. He mooches a ride from wealthy tourists Mr. and Mrs. Chisholm (Paul Harvey and Genevieve Tobin); but after only a few minutes on the road they encounter Duke Mantee (Bogart), a notorious gangster fleeing a massive police pursuit, whose car has broken down. Duke and his gang seize the Chisholms' car and drive to the diner, where Duke has arranged to rendezvous with his girlfriend, Doris, on their way to Mexico. Alan, the Chisholms, and their chauffeur (John Alexander) soon make their way back to the diner as well. Alan, indifferent to the hostage situation, engages Duke in lively conversation and toasts him as \\"the last great apostle of rugged individualism.\\" Boze snatches a rifle and gets the drop on Duke, but during a momentary distraction Duke draws his pistol and shoots Boze in the hand, regaining control. Duke learns that Doris has been captured, and has revealed their rendezvous location to the police. As police and federal agents converge on the diner, Duke prepares to flee, announcing that he will take Mr. and Mrs. Chisholm with him. Inspired by Boze's act of courage, Alan has an inspiration: while Gabrielle is in the back room bandaging Boze's hand, he produces a life insurance policy from his bag and amends it, making Gabrielle the beneficiary. Then he asks Duke to kill him (\\"It couldn't make any difference to you, Duke ... they can hang you only once ...\\"), so that Gabrielle can use the insurance money to realize her dream of moving to France. Duke obliges, then leaves with his human shields. Alan dies in Gabrielle's arms, secure in the knowledge that she, unlike the rest, will escape her dead-end existence to pursue her dreams.

Sherwood based the Duke Mantee character on John Dillinger, the notorious criminal who in 1933 was named the FBI's first \\"Public Enemy #1\\" by J. Edgar Hoover, and in 1934 was ambushed and gunned down in spectacular fashion by FBI agents. Bogart, who won the stage role in part because of his physical resemblance to Dillinger, studied film footage of the gangster and mimicked some of his mannerisms in his portrayal.Shickel, Richard. Bogie: A Celebration of the Life and Films of Humphrey Bogart. Thomas Dunne, 2006. . For the film, Warner Brothers intended to cast the more bankable Edward G. Robinson as Duke; but Howard, whose contract gave him final script control, informed the studio that he would not appear in the movie version without Bogart as his co- star.Sklar, Robert (1992). City Boys: Cagney, Bogart, Garfield. Princeton University Press, pp. 60‚Äì62. . The film made Bogart a star, and he remained grateful to Howard for the rest of his life. In 1952, Bogart and Lauren Bacall named their daughter Leslie Howard Bogart in honor of Howard, who had been killed in a plane crash when the German air force shot down his BOAC flight from Lisbon to Bristol during World War II. In 1948, Robinson portrayed a character similar to Duke Mantee‚Äîa gangster holding a disparate group of people hostage in a Florida hotel‚Äîin Key Largo. That film's hero was played by Bogart. In his penultimate film, The Desperate Hours (1955), Bogart played another gangster holding a suburban family hostage. He described that character as \\"Duke Mantee grown up.\\" Radio and television adaptations The Petrified Forest was performed on CBS's Lux Radio Theater in 1937, with Herbert Marshall, Margaret Sullavan, and Donald Meek in the principal roles; and again on the same program in 1945, with Ronald Coleman, Susan Hayward, and Lawrence Tierney. Another radio adaptation starring Joan Bennett, Tyrone Power, and Bogart aired on The Screen Guild Theater on January 7, 1940. Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart, and Henry Fonda in the 1955 live televised version In 1955, a live television version was performed as an installment of Producers' Showcase, a weekly dramatic anthology, featuring Bogart (now top-billed) as Mantee, Henry Fonda as Alan, and Lauren Bacall as Gabrielle. Jack Klugman, Richard Jaeckel, and Jack Warden played supporting roles. In the late 1990s, Bacall donated the only known kinescope of the 1955 performance to the Museum Of Television & Radio (now the Paley Center for Media), where it remains archived for viewing in New York City and Los Angeles. It is now in the public domain. Reception and Legacy Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a mildly poor review. Exploring the transition between Mayo's film and the original stage play from Sherwood, Greene found that Sherwood's lofty philosophy suffered from the adaptation and that the film's \\"drama slackens under the weight\\" of the playwright's themes which he characterized as \\"rather half-baked\\". Greene praises Davis and Howard for their performances but suggests that \\"life itself, which crept in during the opening scene [...] crept out again, leaving us only with the symbols.\\" (reprinted in: ) * After the film's release, Friz Freleng made the short- length Merrie Melodies cartoon parody, She Was an Acrobat's Daughter (1937) that portrays a cinema audience watching The Petrified Florist, starring Bette Savis and Lester Coward.\\"She Was an Acrobat's Daughter.\\" bcdb.com.

It was written by Frank Partos. Modern research has shown that Nathanael West wrote the final version of the screenplay, but was uncredited. Stranger on the Third Floor is often cited as the first \\"true\\" film noir of the classic period (1940‚Äì1959), though other films that fit the genre such as Rebecca and They Drive by Night were released earlier. Nonetheless, it has many of the hallmarks of film noir: an urban setting, heavy shadows, diagonal lines, voice-over narration, a dream sequence, low camera angles shooting up multi-story staircases, and an innocent protagonist desperate to clear himself after being falsely accused of a crime. Plot Reporter Michael Ward is the key witness in a murder trial. His evidence ‚Äì that he saw the accused, Joe Briggs, standing over the body of a man in a diner ‚Äì is instrumental in having Briggs found guilty. Afterwards, Ward's fianc√©e Jane begins worrying that Ward may not have been correct in what he saw; eventually Ward becomes haunted by this question. One evening, outside his room in the house where he lives, Ward sees an odd-looking stranger. He chases this man down the stairs and out the front door where Ward loses track of him. Ward feels that his neighbor, a man he hates, may have been killed by the stranger. Ward has a terrifying dream in which the neighbor is indeed murdered and he comes under suspicion. It turns out the neighbor was killed the same way as the man in the diner. Ward finds the body, notifies police and points out the similarities in the two murders. He is arrested and, in order to clear him, Jane sets out to find the strange man.

Production  Stranger on the Third Floor was Boris Ingster's directorial debut. Ingster, who was born in Latvia, was formerly a writer, and an associate of noted Russian director Sergei Eisenstein. Ingster would later become a television producer. He directed only three feature films in his career. In the introduction to Turner Classic Movies' Noir Alley presentation of the film, Eddie Muller compared the style of the film to that of German Expressionist films.Muller, Eddie (March 11, 2018) Intro and outro to Turner Classic Movie's presentation of Stranger on the Third Floor Jeremy Arnold writes that \\"[The film's] extraordinary look and tone are the product of stylized sets, bizarre angles and lighting, and a powerful blurring of dream and reality ‚Äì qualities strongly influenced by German expressionist films of the 1920s.\\"Arnold, Jeremy (ndg) \\"Stranger on the Third Floor (1940)\\" TCM.com Robert Portfino called it \\"a distinct break in style and substance with the preceding mystery, crime, detection and horror films of the 1930s.\\" In their book Kings of the Bs, Todd McCarthy and Charles Flynn said that Stranger on the Third Floor \\"is extremely audacious in terms of what it seeks to say about American society ... The trial of the ex-con is a vicious rendering of the American legal system hard at work on an impoverished victim ... [T]he sinister role of police and prosecutors in obtaining confessions and convictions [are] hallmarks of the hard-boiled literature that paralleled and predicted what we call film noir.\\" Van Nest Polglase, who has been called \\"one of the most influential production designers in American cinema\\", was the film's art director. He had previously worked on King Kong in 1933 and The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1939, and worked on the sets for Citizen Kane. His work on Stranger on the Third Floor \\"contributes mightily to the claustrophobic feel of the movie.\\" Muller calls his work on this film \\"spectacular\\". In addition, the work of special effects artist Vernon L. Walker was excellent, despite the constraints of a B movie budget, and the score of Roy Webb, who was RKO's house composer at the time, contributes significantly to the film's mood. Reception Critical response Upon its release in 1940, The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther called the film pretentious and derivative of French and Russian films, and wrote, \\"John McGuire and Margaret Tallichet, as the reporter and his girl, are permitted to act half-way normal, it is true. But in every other respect, including Peter Lorre's brief role as the whack, it is utterly wild. The notion seems to have been that the way to put a psychological melodrama across is to pile on the sound effects and trick up the photography.\\" The staff writer at Variety also believed the film was derivative, and wrote, \\"The familiar artifice of placing the scribe in parallel plight, with the newspaperman arrested for two slayings and only clearing himself because of his sweetheart's persistent search for the real slayer, is used ... Boris Ingster's direction is too studied and when original, lacks the flair to hold attention. It's a film too arty for average audiences, and too humdrum for others.\\" Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader wrote: \\"An RKO B-film from 1940, done up in high Hollywood expressionism. It's absurdly overwrought (which was often the problem with the German variety), but interesting for it. The director, Boris Ingster, is better with shadows than with actors - venetian blinds carve up the characters with more fateful force than Paul Schrader's similar gambit in American Gigolo, and there's a dream sequence that has to be seen to be disbelieved.\\" Another film reviewer, P.S. Harrison, wrote that \\"at [the film's] conclusion, one feels as if one had gone through a nightmare.\\" Rotten Tomatoes reported an 83% approval rating with an average rating of 6.6/10 based on six professional reviews.

He wants the experienced Roy Earle (Humphrey Bogart), whose release from an eastern prison by a governor's pardon he has arranged, to lead the heist and to take charge of the operation.High Sierra at Film Reference.com Roy drives across the country to a camp in the mountains to meet up with the three men who will assist him in the heist: Louis Mendoza (Cornel Wilde), who works as a clerk in the hotel, plus Red (Arthur Kennedy) and Babe (Alan Curtis), who are already living at the camp. Babe has brought along a dance-hall girl, Marie (Ida Lupino). Roy wants to send Marie back to Los Angeles but, after some argument, she convinces Roy to let her stay. Roy also is adopted by a small dog called Pard. Marie falls in love with Roy as he plans and executes the robbery, but he does not reciprocate initially. On the drive up to the mountains, Roy meets the family of Velma (Joan Leslie), a young woman with a clubbed foot who walks with a limp. Roy pays for corrective surgery to allow Velma to walk normally, despite her grandfather's warning that Velma has a boyfriend back home. While she is recovering, Roy asks Velma to marry him but she refuses, explaining that she is engaged to a man from back home. When Velma's fianc√© arrives, Roy turns to Marie, and they become lovers. The heist goes wrong when they are interrupted by a security guard. Roy makes his getaway with Marie, but Mendoza, Red, and Babe are involved in a car crash, killing Red and Babe. Mendoza is captured and talks, putting the police on Roy's trail. Roy goes to Big Mac with the jewels from the robbery, but finds him dead of a heart attack. While Roy and Marie leave town, a dragnet is put out for him, identifying him to the public as \\"Mad Dog Roy Earle\\". The two fugitives separate in order to allow Marie time to escape. Roy is pursued until he climbs one of the Sierra mountains, where he fires shots at the police and then holes up overnight. Shortly after sunrise, Roy hears Pard barking, runs out calling Marie's name and is shot dead from behind by a sharpshooter.

However, Bogart, who took a great interest in playing the role, managed to talk Raft out of accepting it. Raft subsequently turned it down.Curtains for Roy Earle: The Story of 'High Sierra' (2003) Walsh tried to persuade Raft otherwise but Raft did not want to die at the end. Filmink said Raft \\"turned down High Sierra because it was another gangster part, despite the excellent source material and Raoul Walsh directing (admittedly Paul Muni rejected the role first for the same reason‚Ä¶ but Muni was a proper actor, well established in a variety of parts and Raft wasn‚Äôt).\\" Bogart had to persuade director Walsh to hire him for the role since Walsh envisioned Bogart as a supporting player rather than a leading man. Bogart's character's dog, \\"Pard,\\" was erroneously believed by some to be canine actor \\"Terry\\" (\\"Toto\\" from The Wizard of Oz). In fact, it is Bogart's own dog, Zero. In the final scene, Buster Wiles, a stunt performer, plays Roy's corpse. His hand is filled with biscuits to encourage Pard to lick Roy's hand. Many key shots of the movie were filmed on location in the Sierra Nevada. In a climactic scene, Bogart's character slid down a mountainside to his just reward. His stunt double, Wiles, bounced a few times going down the mountain and wanted another take to do better. \\"Forget it,\\" said Raoul Walsh. \\"It's good enough for the 25-cent customers.\\"Sperber, A.M. and Lax, Eric. Bogart, p. 127. Reception Critic Bosley Crowther liked the acting in the picture and wrote, \\"As gangster pictures go, this one has everything‚Äîspeed, excitement, suspense and that ennobling suggestion of futility which makes for irony and pity. Mr. Bogart plays the leading role with a perfection of hard- boiled vitality, and Ida Lupino, Arthur Kennedy, Alan Curtis and a newcomer named Joan Leslie handle lesser roles effectively. Especially, is Miss Lupino impressive as the adoring moll. As gangster pictures go‚Äîif they do‚Äîit's a perfect epilogue. Count on the old guard and Warners: they die but never surrender.\\"Crowther, Bosley.

Time magazine reviewed the film when released as having \\"less of realistic savagery than of the quaint, nostalgic atmosphere of costume drama.\\" The reviewer noted, \\"What makes High Sierra something more than a Grade B melodrama is its sensitive delineation of Gangster Earle's character. Superbly played by Actor Bogart, Earle is a complex human being, a farmer boy who turned mobster, a gunman with a string of murders on his record who still is shocked when newsmen call him \\"Mad-Dog\\" Earle. He is kind to the mongrel dog (Zero) that travels with him, befriends a taxi dancer (Ida Lupino) who becomes his moll, and goes out of his way to help a crippled girl (Joan Leslie). All Roy Earle wants is freedom. He finds it for good on a lonely peak in the mountains.\\"Time. \\"The New Pictures,\\" February 17, 1941. Accessed: April 17, 2008.

Early hip hop groups included Quarashi, Subterranean, Team 13 (which later became Twisted Minds), Multifunctionals, Oblivion, Bounce Brothers and Hip Hop Elements (later named Kritikal Mazz). The next generation of hip hop performers, notably BlazRoca and Sesar A rapped in Icelandic. XXX Rottweiler and Sesar A published the first all Icelandic hip hop albums in 2001. Subsequent artists included B√¶jarins bestu, M√≥ri, Afkv√¶mi Gu√∞anna (The Offspring of the Gods), Bent og 7Berg (Bent and 7Berg), Skytturnar (The Marksmen), H√¶sta Hendin (The Highest Hand) and Forgotten Lores. MG√≠sli Palmi, √ûri√∞ja H√¶√∞in (The Third Floor), Cell 7, Kilo, Shadez of Reykjav√≠k, √ölfur √ölfur, and Emmsj√© Gauti. Icelandic lyrics are usually very direct and aggressive, with battle raps. An important hip hop events is R√≠mnafl√¶√∞i in Mi√∞berg, a freestyle competition. Element Crew has been the leading B-boy crew since 1998. The graffiti scene started 1991 with graffiti writers such as ONE, Pharokees, Atom, Sharq, Kez and Youze. History The first major hip hop crew from Iceland was Quarashi, who were inspired by the rock hybrid music of Beastie Boys and Rage Against the Machine. Around the same time Quarashi released their first album, several rap groups were formed such as Subterranean which are considered to have released one of Icelandic hiphop's biggest classics, Central Magnetizm. Other groups included Team 13 (which later became Twisted Minds), Multifunctionals, Oblivion, Bounce Brothers and Hip Hop Elements (later named Kritikal Mazz). They all rapped in English except for one song from Multifunctionals called \\"N√∫mer 1.\\" During that time the first crew rapping entirely in Icelandic came forward with aggressive radio singles: that band was S√¶k√≥pah and consisted of the rappers BlazRoca and Sesar A. Shortly thereafter, they formed SupahSyndikal along with members of Subterranean and Tr√≠√≥ √ìla Skans. BlazRoca and Sesar A were vital to the second generation of artists that defined itself by rapping in Icelandic. XXX Rottweiler (formerly known as 110 Rottweilerhundar), along with Sesar A, published the first all Icelandic hip hop albums in Iceland in 2001. In 2002 a new wave of rappers had followed their lead by rapping exclusively in Icelandic: B√¶jarins bestu, the freestyle battle champs of Iceland in one unit, M√≥ri, a gangsta rapper who uses Icelandic, Afkv√¶mi Gu√∞anna (The Offspring of the Gods), Bent og 7Berg (Bent and 7Berg), Skytturnar (The Marksmen), H√¶sta Hendin (The Highest Hand) and Forgotten Lores. Most of these groups have stopped making music, and other artists and bands have started to make a name for themselves in the Icelandic hip hop culture. The most active artists today include G√≠sli Palmi, √ûri√∞ja H√¶√∞in (The Third Floor), Cell 7, Kilo, Shadez of Reykjav√≠k, √ölfur √ölfur, Aron Can, GKR, Alexander Jarl, Agust Bent and Emmsj√© Gauti. Icelandic lyrics are usually very direct and aggressive, with battle raps forming a sizable portion of Icelandic hip hop. One of the largest hip hop events is R√≠mnafl√¶√∞i in Mi√∞berg, a freestyle competition where young MCs and rap bands (usually ages sixteen and younger) compete by rapping a single song on stage. The first jury was made up of Sesar A, BlazRoca (XXX Rottweiler hundar) and Omar Swarez (Quarashi). Subgenres Icelandic hip hop culture also includes active scenes with their own subculture. Breakdance Element Crew is the leading b-boy crew (since 1998) under the leadership of Gretski. Breakdancing was first seen on Iceland around 1983. It grew popular in a short amount of time, but by the beginning of the 1990s it had all but faded out. Around 1997, breakdancing began to grow more popular, with Shakers Crew. Graffiti The Graffiti scene first took off in Iceland around 1991 with writers such as ONE, Pharokees, Atom, Sharq, Kez and Youze. Crews such as SR (Stash Riders) and LCF (Le Circle Ferme) were the first big influentials. Then around 1997 TMC (Twisted Minds Crew) broke out with members Senze and Natur being the most active. In the same year CAN Crew (Can Armed Ninjas) was formed by Sketz and Sare One. Sare One is known today as Nores and is now a member of the TMC. With his arrival on the scene the style took a big step forward and he is the most potent individual for Icelandic Graffiti. Foreign artists who have temporarily lived in Iceland have also made an impact, notably Kegr and Jiroe.

It ended the longstanding rivalry in Central Asia and enabled the two countries to outflank the Germans, who were threatening to connect Berlin to Baghdad with a new railroad that would probably align the Ottoman Empire with Germany. The Convention ended the long dispute over Persia. Great Britain promised to stay out of northern Persia, and Russia recognized southern Persia as part of the British sphere of influence. Russia also promised to stay out of Tibet and Afghanistan. In exchange, London extended loans and some political support.

Conventions between Russia and the United Kingdom relating to Persia, Afghanistan, and Tibet, St Petersburgh, August 31, 1907Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc. Anglo-Russian Entente The agreement led to the formation of the Triple Entente.  Background  During the last third of the nineteenth century, the Russian Empire's advances into Central Asia and the consolidation of Great Britain's domination of South Asia led to intense rivalry between the two European powers. The conflicting interests centered on Afghanistan, Iran, and Tibet, three states that constituted buffers between the two powers. The emergence of the German Empire as a world power and the defeat in 1905 of Russia by a nascent Asian power, the Empire of Japan, in the Russo-Japanese War, helped to persuade some British and Russian officials of a need to resolve their respective differences in Asia. There was talk of an entente during the 1880s and 1890s, especially after Britain's occupation of Egypt in 1882. However stiff resistance in Britain to a deal with Russia. In the leadup to the convention, there were discussions on the Straits question. Foreign Minister Sir Edward Grey thought entente with Russia a good idea. On 20 October 1905, during the election, he said: > ...if Russia accepts, cordially and whole-heartedly, our intention to > preserve the peaceable possession of our Asiatic possessions, then I am > quite sure that in this country no government will make it its business to > thwart or obstruct Russia's policy in Europe. On the contrary, it is > urgently desirable that Russia's position and influence be re-established in > the councils of Europe. and later, writing to his ambassador to Russia Sir Arthur Nicolson: > It is not for us to propose changes with regard to the treaty conditions of > the Dardanelles. I think some change in the direction desired by Russia > would be admissible and we should be prepared to discuss the question if > Russia introduces it. In early 1907, Alexander Izvolsky, the Russian ambassador at Paris, raised the question. and talks were carried on in London with Russian Ambassador Count Alexander Benckendorff. Little is known but the \\"suggestion appears to have been made that Russia should have free egress from the Black Sea through the Straits, while other powers should have the right to send their vessels of war into the Straits without going into the Black Sea\\" together with some talk of \\"Russia's occupying the Bosphorus and England the Dardanelles, after which the Straits might be opened to other warships as well.\\" In the event nothing came of the discussions at the time.  Rise of Germany  On May 20, 1882, Germany entered into the Triple Alliance with Italy and Austria-Hungary, complementing its industrial and socio-political climb in the world arena. Furthermore, Germany dramatically increased its military output from the early 1900s up to the outbreak of World War I. Under the new German empire, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck worked to increase the nation's wealth and reach what was then the zenith of German power. While Britain and Russia were hostile to Germany's imperialistic motives, members of the Triple Alliance were in turn somewhat threatened by Britain's and Russia's aggressive foreign policy tactics and wealth derived from their colonies. Thus, military and territorial expansion was Germany's key to making itself a major player in the international arena of power. Germany's interest in the Middle East took a secondary position, one subordinate to Germany's primary policy toward Europe, throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. While of secondary importance, it was a tool that was used to manipulate the Middle Eastern attempt to play off the Western powers against each other. Berlin peacefully penetrated the Ottoman Empire and had few colonial aspirations in the region.Erich Eyck, Bismarck and the German Empire (1963) pp 261‚Äì297. online.  Trouble in Persia  In 1905, revolutionary activity spread throughout Tehran, forcing the shah to accept a constitution, allow the formation of a majles (parliamentary assembly), and hold elections. Major figures in the revolution had secular goals, which then created rifts in the clergy to the advantage of the monarchy. Neither Britain nor Russia approved of the new liberal, unstable, political arrangement, as preferred a stable puppet government that submitted to foreign concessions and worked well with their imperialist goals. To facilitate the situation in Persia, Britain and Russia discussed splitting it ‚Äúinto three zones. The agreement they wanted would allocate the north, including Isfahan, to Russia; the south-east, especially Kerman, Sistan, and Baluchistan to Britain; and demarcate the remaining land between the two powers as a \\"neutral zone.\\" The division of Persia reinforced Great Power control over these respective territorial and economic interests in the country as well as allowed for contrived interference in Persia's political system. With foreign influence, revolution was outflanked by a combination of European and monarchist activities. As a result, Persians learned the two neighbors were dangerous when they put aside their rivalries.Beryl J. Williams, \\"The Strategic Background to the Anglo-Russian Entente of August 1907.\\" Historical Journal 9#3 (1966): 360-73. online. Consequently, in 1907, Britain and Russia signed an agreement to regulate their economic and political interests. Terms With respect to Iran, the agreement recognized the country's strict independence and integrity but then divided it into three separate zones. The agreement designated all of northern Iran, which bordered Russia's possessions in Transcaucasia and Central Asia, as an exclusive sphere of influence for Russian interests. The northern zone was defined as beginning at Qasr-e Shirin in the west, on the border with the Ottoman Empire, and running through Tehran, Isfahan and Yazd to the eastern border, where the frontiers of Afghanistan, Iran, and Russia intersected. A smaller zone in southeastern Iran, which bordered British India, was recognized as an exclusive sphere for Britain. The British zone extended west as far as Kerman in the south central and Bandar Abbas in the south. The area separating these two spheres, including part of central Iran and the entire southwest, was designated a neutral zone in which both countries and their respective private citizens could compete for influence and commercial privileges. For Britain and Russia, the agreement was important in establishing a diplomatic alignment that endured until World War I. The government of Iran, however, had not been consulted about the agreement but was informed after the fact. Although not in a position to prevent Britain and Russia from implementing the agreement, the Iranian government refused to recognize the accord's legitimacy since it threatened the country's integrity and independence. Iranian nationalists, in particular, felt aggravated by Britain, a country that they had considered as a democratic beacon during the Constitutional Revolution. Thus, an important legacy of the agreement was the growth of anti-British sentiment and other anti-Western attitudes as strong components of Iranian nationalism. The agreement did not eliminate all competition between the two powers with respect to their policies in Iran, but after 1907, broad co-operation was fostered, often to the detriment of Iranian interests. In particular, Britain and Russia intervened in Iran's domestic politics by supporting the royalists in their contest with the constitutionalists. The agreement lapsed in 1918, after it was renounced by the new revolutionary Soviet Russia.Kazemzadeh, Firuz. Russia and Britain in Persia, 1864‚Äì1914: A Study in Imperialism.

The strengthening of the German Empire, the creation of the Triple Alliance of 1882, and the exacerbation of Franco-German and Russo-German contradictions at the end of the 1880s led to a common foreign policy and mutual strategic military interests between France and Russia. The development of financial ties between the two countries created the economic prerequisites for the Russo-French Alliance.

History  The history of the alliance dates to the beginning of the 1870s, to the contradictions engendered by the Franco-Prussian War and the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871. The Russian government had supported France during the war scare of 1875 when Russian and British protests forced Germany to stop threatening an attack on France.T. G. Otte, \\"From 'War-in-Sight' to Nearly War: Anglo‚ÄìFrench Relations in the Age of High Imperialism, 1875‚Äì1898,\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft (2006) 17#4 pp 693‚Äì714. In 1876, the German chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, attempted unsuccessfully to obtain from Russia a guarantee to preserve the territory of Alsace-Lorraine as part of Germany in exchange for unconditional support by Germany for Russian policy in the East. In 1877, during the new Franco-German war scare, Russia maintained friendly relations with France. However, after the Berlin Congress of 1878, French diplomacy, in aiming at a rapprochement with Great Britain and Germany, assumed a hostile position vis-√†-vis Russia. France's alienation from Russia and her policy of colonial seizures lasted until 1885 when the Franco- German contradictions became heightened after the French defeat in Annam. Early in 1887, new complications arose in Franco-German relations. France appealed to the Russian government for aid. In concluding the so-called Reinsurance Treaty with Germany in 1887, Russia insisted on maintaining for France the same conditions that Germany had stipulated for its ally, Austria.Norman Rich, Great power diplomacy, 1814-1914. (1992) 216-62. At the end of the 1880s, Russo-German economic discrepancies grew stronger. The Russo-French political rapprochement contributed to the influx of French capital into Russia. At the end of the 1880s and the beginning of the 1890s, Russia received a number of large loans from France. The deterioration of Russo-German relations, the resurrection of the Triple Alliance in 1891, and the rumors that Great Britain would join the alliance laid the grounds for the conclusion of a political agreement between Russia and France. During a visit by a French squadron to Kronstadt in July 1891, the agreement of 1891 was concluded in the form of an exchange of letters between the ministers of foreign affairs. France was interested significantly more than Russia in a military alliance and endeavored to supplement the 1891 agreement with military obligations. As a result of the negotiations, the representatives of the Russian and French general staffs signed a military convention on August 17 (August 5 in Russian calendar), 1892, which provided for mutual military aid in the event of a German attack. By an exchange of letters between December 27 (December 15), 1893, and January 4, 1894 (December 23, 1893), both governments announced their ratification of the military convention. This formalized the Russo-French military-political alliance. It was a response to the formation of a military bloc (the Triple Alliance) headed by Germany. In Europe, two opposing hostile imperialist blocs had formed.Rich, Great power diplomacy, 1814-1914. (1992) pp. 391-407. Souvenir postcard of the French maneuvers of 1901 Relying on Russian support, France intensified its colonial policy. After the Fashoda Incident of 1898 with Great Britain, it endeavored even more to strengthen the alliance with Russia. The alliance with France also facilitated the tsarist government's expansion into Manchuria in the 1890s. During the preparatory period and the first years of the existence of the Russo-French Alliance, the determining role was played by Russia, but in time the situation altered. By constantly receiving new loans from France, Russian tsarism gradually fell into financial dependence on French imperialism. Prior to World War I, the cooperation of the general staffs of both countries assumed closer forms. In 1912 a Russo-French naval convention was signed. Russia and France entered the war united by the treaty of alliance. This had a significant effect on the course and outcome of the war since it forced Germany from the first days of the war to fight on two fronts. This led to the defeat of Germany the battle of the Marne, to the collapse of the Schlieffen Plan, and finally to the defeat of Germany. The Russo-French Alliance was nullified by the Soviet government in 1917.A.J.P. Taylor, The struggle for mastery in Europe, 1848-1918. (1954), pp 325-345.

Declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1999, the site currently occupies and contains a complex of limestone caves. The registered name of the site in the list of World Heritage sites is Fossil Hominid Sites of South Africa. According to existing archaeological and fossil evidence, however, the Cradle of Humankind is the Afar Triangle in East Africa, which is often referred to as the Cradle of Humanity. The Sterkfontein Caves were the site of the discovery of a 2.3-million-year-old fossil Australopithecus africanus (nicknamed \\"Mrs. Ples\\"), found in 1947 by Robert Broom and John T. Robinson. The find helped corroborate the 1924 discovery of the juvenile Australopithecus africanus skull known as the \\"Taung Child\\", by Raymond Dart, at Taung in the North West Province of South Africa, where excavations still continue. Nearby, but not in the site, the Rising Star Cave system contains the Dinaledi Chamber (chamber of stars), in which were discovered fifteen fossil skeletons of an extinct species of hominin, provisionally named Homo naledi. Sterkfontein alone has produced more than a third of early hominid fossils ever found prior to 2010. The Dinaledi Chamber contains over 1,500 H. naledi fossils, the most extensive discovery of a single hominid species ever found in Africa. Etymology The self-proclaimed name Cradle of Humankind reflects the fact that the site has produced a large number of (as well as some of the oldest) hominin fossils ever found, some dating back as far as 3.5 million years ago. History of discoveries In 1935, Robert Broom found the first ape-man fossils at Sterkfontein and began work at this site. In 1938, a young schoolboy, Gert Terrblanche, brought Raymond Dart fragments of a skull from nearby Kromdraai which later were identified as Paranthropus robustus. Also in 1938, a single ape-man tooth was found at the Cooper's site between Kromdraai and Sterkfontein. In 1948, the Camp-Peabody Expedition from the United States worked at Bolts Farm and Gladysvale looking for fossil hominids but failed to find any. Later in 1948, Robert Broom identified the first hominid remains from Swartkrans cave. In 1954, C.K. Brain began working at sites in the Cradle, including Cooper's Cave. He then initiated his three-decade work at Swartkrans cave, which resulted in the recovery of the second-largest sample of hominid remains from the Cradle. The oldest controlled use of fire by Homo erectus was also discovered at Swartkrans and dated to over 1 million years ago. In 1966, Phillip Tobias began his excavations of Sterkfontein which are still continuing and are the longest continuously running fossil excavations in the world. In 1991, Lee Berger of the University of the Witwatersrand discovered the first hominid specimens from the Gladysvale site, making this the first new early hominid site to be discovered in South Africa in 48 years. In 1994, Andre Keyser discovered fossil hominids at the site of Drimolen. In 1997, Kevin Kuykendall and Colin Menter of the University of the Witwatersrand found two fossil hominid teeth at the site of Gondolin. Also in 1997, the near- complete Australopithecus skeleton of \\"Little Foot\\", dating to around 3.3 million years ago (although more recent dating suggest it is closer to 2.5 million years ago), was discovered by Ron Clarke. In 2001, Steve Churchill of Duke University and Lee Berger found early modern human remains at Plovers Lake. Also in 2001, the first hominid fossils and stone tools were discovered in-situ at Coopers. In 2008, Lee Berger discovered the partial remains of two hominids (Australopithecus sediba) in the Malapa Fossil Site that lived between 1.78 and 1.95 million years ago. Australopithecus africanus (reconstruction) In October 2013, Berger commissioned geologist Pedro Boshoff to investigate cave systems in the Cradle of Humankind for the express purpose of discovering more fossil hominin sites. Cavers Rick Hunter and Steven Tucker discovered hominid fossils in a previously unexplored area of the Rising Star/Westminster Cave System assigned site designation UW-101. In November 2013, Berger led a joint expedition of the University of the Witwatersrand and National Geographic Society to the Rising Star Cave System near Swartkrans. In just three weeks of excavation, the six-woman international team of advance speleological scientists (K. Lindsay Eaves, Marina Elliott, Elen Feuerriegel, Alia Gurtov, Hannah Morris, and Becca Peixotto), chosen for their paleoanthropological and caving skills, as well as their small size, recovered over 1,200 specimens of a presently unidentified fossil hominin species. The site is still in the process of being dated. In September 2015, Berger, in collaboration with National Geographic, announced the discovery of a new species of human relative, named Homo naledi, from UW-101. Most remarkably, besides shedding light on the origins and diversity of our genus, H. naledi also appears to have intentionally deposited bodies of its dead in a remote cave chamber, a behaviour previously thought limited to humans. In the last days of the Rising Star Expedition, cavers Rick Hunter and Steven Tucker discovered additional fossil hominid material in another portion of the cave system. Preliminary excavations at this site, designated UW-102, have begun and yielded complete hominid fossil material of its own. It is unknown what the relationship of sites 101 and 102 is. Geological context Tumulus building at Maropeng visitors centre Front of Maropeng The hominin remains at the Cradle of Humankind are found in dolomitic caves and are often encased in a mixture of limestone and other sediments called breccia and fossilised over time. Hominids may have lived all over Africa, but their remains are found only at sites where conditions allowed for the formation and preservation of fossils. Visitor centres On 7 December 2005, South African President Thabo Mbeki opened the new Maropeng Visitors Centre at the site.

Currently occupying a geographically central location within the city of Toronto, the Town of North Toronto was incorporated in 1890, when much of the area was still farmland, and annexed by the old city of Toronto in 1912. The name is still used to refer to the area in general, although Yonge‚ÄìEglinton and Midtown Toronto are officially used. The former town was bounded on the south by Moore Avenue east to Bayview Avenue, north to Eglinton Avenue, west to Bruce, north to Fairfield, west to the west boundary of Mount Hope Cemetery, then north to north of Glen Echo, west to Yonge, north to north of McNairn Avenue, then west to a line just west of Elm Road. The boundary continues south to just north of Glenview Avenue and Avenue Road, then west to a line with Proudfoot Avenue, then south to just north of Briar Hill, then south on Castlewood to Roselawn, then south on Latimer to Eglinton Avenue. The boundary continues east on Eglinton to Elmsthorpe, then south to the former rail line south of Chaplin Crescent, then east to Yonge. Origins Toronto's Yonge streetcar line was then extended along Yonge Street through North Toronto, replacing the Metropolitan line, the former radial railway service. North Toronto soon emerged as a popular streetcar suburb, with the area becoming completely developed by the 1940s. The streetcar was replaced in 1954 by the Toronto Transit Commission's Yonge subway as far as Eglinton Avenue and a trolleybus running north from there, which was replaced in turn by a subway extension in 1973. Today North Toronto is a relatively affluent community, and very popular with young families. Character The neighbourhood has had a mixed-density design for some time, but this is rapidly changing to a greater density with the construction of residential condominium buildings in the area. The southern part of the neighbourhood is densely populated, with the entire section between Yonge Street and Mount Pleasant Road south of Davisville Avenue built up with high rise apartment buildings. More recently, condo buildings have further added to this density, especially south of Merton Street (backing onto historic Mount Pleasant Cemetery). Additional condo developments have begun on Mount Pleasant Road, and the existing medium-rise dwellings southeast of Yonge and Eglinton have been joined by developer Minto's Quantum towers of 37 and 54 stories. Mount Pleasant Cemetery serves as a major green space for the southern end of the neighbourhood. South of the cemetery are trails in two ravines of the former Mud Creek and Yellow Creek, which lead to the Don River. On the north side of the cemetery is the Beltline Trail, a heavily used pedestrian and cycling path on the route of a former railway line. The Belt Line Railway was a short-lived commuter route in the 1890s. It was subsequently purchased by Canadian National Railway and used for freight until service was discontinued in the 1960s. The path goes northwest to Eglinton Avenue, then curves west, and ends at the William R. Allen Road, known locally as the Allen Expressway. Other green spaces includes Eglinton Park just west of Yonge Street and Alexander Muir Memorial Gardens at Yonge Street and Lawrence Avenue, which connects to Sherwood Ravine Park and Sunnybrook Park to the east. Street sign designed in honour of North Toronto North Toronto is served by north‚Äìsouth commercial strips on Yonge Street, Mount Pleasant Road, and Bayview Avenue, and an east‚Äìwest strip on Eglinton Avenue. These offer an array of shopping and dining aimed primarily at the local market, and as with many main streets in Toronto neighbourhoods, are largely given to small, locally owned shops in free-standing buildings. The corner of Yonge and Eglinton features the Yonge Eglinton Centre complex, which includes a shopping mall, multiplex cinema, and both office and residential towers; and Canada Square, an office complex with a small shopping concourse and another, older multiplex. Both are connected to Eglinton subway station. The headquarters of Canadian Tire, TVOntario, RioCan, Heart and Stroke Foundation and the Toronto Transit Commission are located in North Toronto. Libraries can be found on Bayview Avenue, at Yonge and Lawrence, and near Yonge and Eglinton, along with a children's-focused library on Mount Pleasant. There are two community centres in North Toronto; Central Eglinton Community Centre, at Eglinton and Redpath, offers a wide variety of programs and services for caregivers & young children, adults. and people 50+. North Toronto Memorial Community Centre is located at Eglinton Park (Eglinton Avenue and Oriole Parkway). What was once North America's largest bridge club, Kate Buckman's, was on Mount Pleasant near Eglinton for many years until its closure in 2007; the Toronto Bridge Club is on St. Clair near Yonge. The Toronto Camera Club finds its home on Mount Pleasant Road near Millwood Road. Neighbourhoods North Toronto is composed of a number of distinct neighbourhoods. It has more recently also become synonymous with Midtown. * Allenby *Bedford Park *Chaplin Estates *Davisville Village *Lawrence Park *Lytton Park *Wanless Park *Yonge‚ÄìEglinton See also *TTC Davisville, Eglinton, and Lawrence stations External links *Map of Toronto Neighbourhoods Category:Neighbourhoods in Toronto Category:Streetcar suburbs Category:Former towns in Ontario Category:Former municipalities in Toronto ","title":"North Toronto"},{"id":"560508","text":"In United States politics, the China lobby is a phrase to describe special interest groups acting on behalf of the governments of either the People's Republic of China; or groups acting on the behalf of the Republic of China on Taiwan to influence Sino-American relations; or those in the U.S. who lobby for what they deem as pro-Chinese American policies and closer Sino-American relations. During much of the twentieth century, the term \\"China lobby\\" was used most often to refer to special interest groups acting on behalf of the Republic of China (ROC). Before increased Sino-American engagement following the 1972 Nixon visit to mainland China, and the American recognition of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1979, the PRC lobby was overshadowed by representatives of Taiwan's interests. The then small Chinese American community largely shared a pro ROC perspective. Since that time, the PRC lobby has greatly strengthened, and by the 1990s, \\"China lobby\\" began to refer to special interest groups who work to achieve the PRC's desired political, economic, immigration policies in Sino-American relations by influencing American policy makers, economic interests and the public.Warren Cohen, \\"The China Lobby.\\" Encyclopedia of American foreign policy: studies of the principal movements and ideas 1 (1978): 104. History Sino-Japanese War During the Second Sino-Japanese War (which took place simultaneously with World War II), the China lobby helped convince Congress to donate hard cash and many tons of war material in support of Chiang Kai-shek's war against the Japanese in China and Indochina even before formal American entrance into the Second World War following the attack on Pearl Harbor. Cold War period The Committee of One Million Against the Admission of Red China to the United Nations, which later changed its name to The Committee of One Million Against the Admission of Communist China to the United Nations was the dominant lobby on Sino-Americans issues until the U.S. and PRC began an opening of relations and the PRC was admitted to the U.N., becoming a member of the U.N. Security Council. This organization was established by Marvin Liebman, a political activist. During the 1970s, the China (ROC) lobby itself campaigned furiously to prevent American recognition of the People's Republic of China (PRC), but its efforts proved to be unsuccessful and the PRC was recognized by the United States in 1979. Post-Nixon mainland China visit Occurring from February 21 to 28, 1972, the visit allowed the American public to view images of China for the first time in more than 20 years. Throughout the week the President and his most senior advisers engaged in substantive discussions with the PRC, including a meeting with Chairman Mao Zedong, while First Lady Pat Nixon toured schools, factories and hospitals in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou along with the large American press corps. Nixon dubbed the visit \\"the week that changed the world.\\" In an effort to build toward formal diplomatic relations, the US and the PRC established a United States Liaison Office (USLO) in Beijing and a counterpart PRC office in Washington. In 1973 to 1978, such distinguished Americans as David K. E. Bruce, George H. W. Bush, Thomas S. Gates, Jr., and Leonard Woodcock served as chiefs of the USLO with the personal rank of ambassador. China made clear that it considered the Soviet Union its chief adversary, and urged the US to be powerful, thereby distracting Moscow. Liaison officer George Bush concluded, \\"China keeps wanting us to be strong, wanting us to defend Europe, wanting us to increase our defense budgets, etc.\\" Bush concluded that American engagement was essential to support markets, allies, and stability in Asia and around the world. President Gerald Ford visited the PRC in 1975 and reaffirmed American interest in normalizing relations with Beijing. Shortly after taking office in 1977, President Jimmy Carter again reaffirmed the goals of the Shanghai Communiqu√©. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, Carter's National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, and senior staff member of the National Security Council Michel Oksenberg encouraged Carter to seek full diplomatic and trade relations with China. Deng Xiaoping Period In 1979 the Taiwan Relations Act was signed by President Carter, which committed the United States to provide military and other support for Taiwan and provided guidelines for future trade and other relations. In 1980 Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping launched the so- called \\"Reform and Opening\\" policies. Deng Xiaoping embarked on a major process of economic changes, and pressed the U.S. to open trade relations. One of the main aspects of this was opening the doors to international trade and business. China lobbied to gain business from the United States, and companies began to flock to China to take advantage of the new opportunities made possible by trade laws. China was invited to join the IMF and World Bank. In 1982 after additional negotiations concerning coordinating positions regarding the Soviet Union and Taiwan, the United States and China released another joint communiqu√©, the Third Communiqu√©, by which the United States agreed to reduce its arms sales to Taiwan and China agreed to emphasize a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue. The next year, Deng Xiaoping proposed the \\"one country, two systems\\" approach for reunification with both Hong Kong and Taiwan. In 1986 China joined the Asian Development Bank and applied for membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). The United States at the time did not support China's entry into the latter two organizations because of reservations about the degree of openness of China's economy. In 1989 in the aftermath of the Chinese military crackdown on demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in the spring, the United States and other nations imposed economic sanctions on China, and many U.S. citizens evacuated the country. President George H.W. Bush maintained communications with senior Chinese leaders, though tensions continued into the next year, with criticisms aired from both sides. Diplomatic ties were never severed and China remained open to foreign trade. Post Deng Xiaoping Period In 1992 the first high-level contacts in several years occurred when President George H.W. Bush and Chinese Premier Li Peng met on the sidelines of a U.N. conference. President Bush maintained support for Taiwan by authorizing new arms sales and dispatching a Special Trade Representative to the island. President Clinton had in 1993 tied the annual review of Most Favored Nation trading status to China's record on human rights, a decision that was in keeping with popular opinion on China. When this status came up for renewal the next year, Clinton reversed this position and granted China MFN without requiring any changes regarding human rights. In 1998 President Bill Clinton agreed that the United States held to a \\"three no‚Äôs policy\\" regarding Taiwan. By this he meant that the United States does not support Taiwan's independence, \\"two Chinas\\" or \\"one China, one Taiwan\\" policies, or Taiwan's membership in international organizations where statehood is required. Late in 1999 in the year, after lobbying by China, the two sides finally came to an agreement and China was able to join the WTO. The annual debate over China's trading status within the United States was ended when President Clinton decided to grant China permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR, formerly MFN). 2000s In the first decade of the twenty-first century, the PRC lobby has focused on playing up common interests with the United States in the War on Terrorism. The PRC lobby has also tried to counter the domestic American interest groups which seek to bring pressure upon the PRC to move from a fixed currency to a floating currency. In 2004, the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) created a working group to look at new ways for outward immigration to benefit China, a policy that was first initiated in 1985. The group was tasked with balancing the need to promote economic development and protect national security and social stability. Seminars were organized to discuss Western immigration laws. Neil Bush, son of George H.W. Bush (who had been instrumental in opening China to U.S. investment and bilateral trade as the Ambassador to the PRC) in 2011 incorporated an accounting firm called LehmanBush with veteran China lawyer Edward Lehman. In 2002, Bush signed a consulting contract that paid $2 million in stock over five years to work for Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., a firm backed by Jiang Mianheng, the son of former Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, plus $10,000 for every board meeting he attends.

J. Soles, Sean Young, and John Candy. Several actors including John Larroquette, John Diehl, Conrad Dunn, and Judge Reinhold were featured in their first significant film roles. Joe Flaherty, Dave Thomas, Timothy Busfield, and Bill Paxton also appeared early in their careers. Plot John Winger (Bill Murray) is a cab driver in New York City who, in the span of a few hours, loses his job, his apartment, his car, and his girlfriend, Anita. Realizing that he is a 30 year old loser with no prospects, he decides to join the Army. He talks his best friend Russell Ziskey (Harold Ramis), a teacher of English as a second language, into joining him, and they go to a recruiting office and are soon sent off to basic training. Upon arriving at Fort Arnold, they meet their fellow recruits, and their drill sergeant, Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). Moments after arriving, John angers Sergeant Hulka and is ordered out to do push-ups. He stands out as a slacker throughout basic training. John and Russell make friends with a platoon who are a bunch of misfits. Their commanding officer is the arrogant and incompetent Captain Stillman (John Larroquette). As basic training progresses, Russell and John become romantically linked to female MPs Louise Cooper and Stella Hansen. Not long before graduation, Hulka is injured when Stillman, trying to impress a visiting colonel, orders a mortar crew to fire without setting target coordinates. The men go to a mud wrestling bar, where John convinces Dewey \\"Ox\\" Oxberger (John Candy) to wrestle a group of women. When the club is raided by MPs and police, Stella and Louise cover for John and Russell. The rest of the platoon are returned to base, where a furious Stillman threatens to make them all repeat basic training. After partying with Stella and Louise, the buddies return to the barracks, and John motivates the platoon with a passionate speech and begins to get them in shape for graduation. After a long night of practice, they oversleep and almost miss the ceremony. They rush to the parade grounds in their fatigues. There they give an eccentric, yet highly coordinated, drill display led by John. General Barnicke is impressed when he finds out that they had to complete training without a drill sergeant, and decides they are just the kind of \\"go-getters\\" he wants working on his EM-50 project in Italy. Once in Italy, the platoon is reunited with a recovered Hulka and assigned to guard the EM-50 Urban Assault Vehicle, an armored personnel carrier disguised as a recreational vehicle. Fed up with their boring assignment, John and Russell steal the EM-50 to visit their girlfriends, stationed in West Germany. When Stillman finds the EM-50 missing, he launches an unauthorized mission to get the vehicle back before his superiors find out it is gone. Hulka urges Stillman not to go, but is overruled. Stillman inadvertently leads the platoon across the border into Czechoslovakia. Hulka, recognizing where they are, jumps out of the truck just before it is captured by the Soviet Army. He makes a mayday radio call that is heard by John and Russell, who realize that the platoon came looking for them and are now in danger. John, Russell, Stella, and Louise take the EM-50 and infiltrate a Soviet base where the platoon is being held. With some assistance from Hulka, they save the entire platoon. Upon returning to the US, John, Russell, Louise, Stella, and Hulka are treated as heroes, each being awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Hulka retires and opens the HulkaBurger franchise. Stella appears on the cover of Penthouse, Ox makes the cover of Tiger Beat, Russell recreates his firefight with the Russians for Guts magazine, and John is featured on the cover of Newsworld. The disgraced Captain Stillman is reassigned to a weather station near Nome, Alaska. Cast * Bill Murray as John Winger * Harold Ramis as Russell Ziskey * Warren Oates as Sergeant Hulka * P. J.

Wilke as General Barnicke * Antone Pag√°n as Hector * Bill Paxton as Unnamed Soldier Production On his way to the premiere of Meatballs, Ivan Reitman thought up the idea for a film: \\"Cheech and Chong join the army\\". He pitched it to Paramount Pictures and they greenlit the film that day. Len Blum and Dan Goldberg wrote the screenplay in Toronto and read it to Reitman, who was in Los Angeles, over the phone. The director, in turn, would give the writers notes. Cheech and Chong's manager thought the script was very funny; however, the comedy duo wanted complete creative control. Reitman then suggested to Goldberg that they change the two main characters to ones suited for Bill Murray and Harold Ramis, figuring if they could get Ramis interested and let him tailor the script for the two of them, he could convince Murray to do it. Ramis had already co-written National Lampoon's Animal House, Meatballs, and Caddyshack, but was relatively unknown as a film actor. His best-known acting work prior to Stripes was as a cast member for the late-night TV sketch comedy Second City Television, which he had quit a few years earlier.Caldwell, Sara C., and Marie-Eve S. Kielson, So You Want to be A Screenwriter: How to Face the Fears and Take the Risks (Allworth Press, 2000), p. 77. , Columbia Pictures did not like Ramis's audition but Reitman told the studio that he was hiring the comedian anyway. P. J. Soles reported that Dennis Quaid had read for the role of Russell and that Ramis was reluctant to appear in the film, but that Murray told Ramis he did not wish to work with anyone else and would leave the film unless he played the other principal. Casting director Karen Rea saw Conrad Dunn on the stage and asked him to read for the role of Francis \\"Psycho\\" Soyer in New York. Judge Reinhold played Elmo, who was given the best jokes from the Cheech and Chong draft of the screenplay. Sean Young was cast based on her looks, and Reitman felt that her \\"sweetness\\" would go well with Ramis. P. J. Soles tested with Murray and they got along well together. John Diehl had never auditioned before and won his first paying job as an actor. Goldberg knew John Candy from Toronto and told Reitman that he should be in the film; he was not required to audition. Reitman was a fan of the westerns that Warren Oates had been in and wanted someone who was strong and that everyone respected to control the film's misfit platoon. Reinhold said that during filming Oates would tell stories about working on films like The Wild Bunch and they would be enthralled. Reitman wanted \\"a little bit of weight in the center\\", and added the argument between Hulka and Winger. It was not played for laughs and allowed Murray to do a serious scene, something he had not done before. During filming one of the obstacle courses scenes, Reitman told the actors to grab Oates and drag him into the mud without telling the veteran actor about it to see what would happen and get a genuine reaction. Oates' front tooth got chipped in the process and he yelled at Reitman for what he did. Every scene had some element of improvisation due in large part to Murray and Ramis. Much of the mud wrestling scene was made up on the spot by Reitman. Candy felt uncomfortable during filming, but Reitman talked him through it. The spatula scene in the kitchen of the general's house was filmed at three in the morning, after the cast and crew had been up the entire day. Murray improvised the \\"Aunt Jemima Treatment\\" sequence and Soles reacted naturally to whatever he said and did. Filming began in Kentucky in November 1980, then moved to California in December. Principal photography ended on Stage 20 at Burbank Studios on January 29, 1981. The production was allowed to shoot the army base scenes at Fort Knox, the city scenes in Louisville, and the Czechoslovakia scenes at the closed Chapeze Distillery (owned by Jim Beam) in Clermont, with a budget of $9‚Äì10million and a 42-day shooting schedule. Reitman, Goldberg, and Ramis were involved in a detailed negotiation with the Department of Defense to make the film conducive to the recruiting needs of the military, in exchange for subsidies in the form of free labor and location and equipment access.David L. Robb Operation Hollywood: How the Pentagon Shapes and Censors the Movies 2004 amazon.com Dunn remembered Candy inviting the men in the platoon to his house while filming was under way, for a homemade spaghetti dinner and to watch the famous Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Dur√°n II No M√°s Fight (November 25, 1980). He recalled that he and Candy were the only two cast members who knew the lyrics to the song, \\"Doo Wah Diddy\\", and taught them to the rest of the company. \\"I really enjoyed playing Psycho\\", he said. In 1993 Murray reflected, \\"I'm still a little queasy that I actually made a movie where I carry a machine gun. But I felt if you were rescuing your friends it was okay. It wasn't Reds or anything, but it captured what it was like on an Army base: It was cold, you had to wear the same green clothes, you had to do a lot of physical stuff, you got treated pretty badly, and had bad coffee\\". The EM-50 Urban Assault Vehicle \\"was built from a 1973-1978-era GMC Motorhome,\\" but no one knows what exact year it was. It was designed to resemble \\"a family Winnebago ‚Äî with a nice color scheme and user-friendly interior ‚Äî but came with bulletproof shields and flamethrowers.\\" Reception Box office Stripes was released on June 26, 1981 and grossed $1,892,000 in 1,074 screens on opening day. It placed fifth overall for the weekend with $6,152,166. It eventually grossed $85,297,000 in North America, making it the fifth most popular 1981 film at the U.S.A. and Canada box office. Critical response Stripes was well received by critics and audiences. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 36 reviews, with a rating average of 6.58/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"A raucous military comedy that features Bill Murray and his merry cohorts approaching the peak of their talents.\\" In his Chicago Sun-Times review, Roger Ebert praised it as \\"an anarchic slob movie, a celebration of all that is irreverent, reckless, foolhardy, undisciplined, and occasionally scatological. It's a lot of fun\\". Janet Maslin of The New York Times called it \\"a lazy but amiable comedy\\" and praised Murray for achieving \\"a sardonically exaggerated calm that can be very entertaining\\". Gary Arnold, in his review for The Washington Post, wrote, \\"Stripes squanders at least an hour belaboring situations contradicted from the outset by Murray's personality. The premise and star remain out of whack until the rambling, diffuse screenplay finally struggles beyond basic training\\". Time wrote, \\"Stripes will keep potential felons off the streets for two hours. Few people seem to be asking, these days, that movies do more\\". Home media An extended edition of Stripes was released on DVD on June 7, 2005. Extra features include six deleted scenes; audio commentary by Reitman and Goldberg; an hour-long documentary titled \\"Stars & Stripes\\" that includes the reminiscences of the screenwriters, Reitman, Diehl, Laroquette, Murray, Reinhold, Soles and Young; and the original trailer. The optional extended cut expands on several scenes and includes an excised subplot in which Winger and Ziskey (who takes six hits of Elmo's LSD under the impression that it is Dramamine) go AWOL by stowing away on a special forces paratrooper mission. They become lost in a jungle and are captured by Spanish-speaking guerrillas. They are taken to camp and nearly shot before Winger saves the day by singing the chorus of Tito Rodriguez's \\"Quando, Quando, Quando\\", effectively winning over their captors. Winger and Ziskey then leave and rejoin the special forces unit as it is re-boarding the plane.

The name Kenmare is the anglicised form of Ceann Mara, meaning \\"head of the sea\\", referring to the head of Kenmare Bay. Location Kenmare is located at the head of Kenmare Bay (where it reaches the farthest inland), sometimes called the Kenmare River, where the Roughty River (An Ruachtach) flows into the sea, and at the junction of the Iveragh Peninsula and the Beara Peninsula. The traditional Irish name of the bay was Inbhear Sc√©ine from the Celtic inver, which is recorded in the 11th Century narrative Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn as the arrival point of the mythological Irish ancestor Parthol√≥n. It is also located near the MacGillycuddy's Reeks, Mangerton Mountain and Caha Mountains and is a popular hillwalking destination. Nearby towns and villages are Tuosist, Ardgroom, Glengarriff, Kilgarvan, Killarney, Templenoe and Sneem. Kenmare is in the Kerry constituency of D√°il √âireann. History The entire area was granted to the English scientist Sir William Petty by Oliver Cromwell as part payment for completing the mapping of Ireland, the Down Survey in 1656. He laid out the modern town circa 1670. Before him, a previous surveyor of Ireland, Sir Valentine Browne (1510-1589), ancestor of the Earl of Kenmare, was granted some lands in County Kerry during the resulting plantation, the Munster Plantation. The three main streets that form a triangle in the centre of the town are called Main Street (originally William Street, after Sir William, 1st. Marquis of Lansdowne), Henry Street (originally Sound Road), after the son of William the 1st. Marquis and Shelbourne Street (Henry Petty became the first Earl of Shelburne). This name was also later applied to Shelbourne Road in Dublin. However, the area has more ancient roots. One of the largest stone circles in the south-west of Ireland is close to the town, and shows occupation in the area going back to the Bronze Age (2,200‚Äì500 B.C), when it was constructed. The circle has 15 stones around the circumference with a boulder dolmen in the centre. famine grave for Kenmare victims Vikings are said to have raided the area around the town which at that time was called Ceann Mhara, which means \\"head of the sea\\" in Irish. The convent in the town, the Poor Clare Sisters, was founded in 1861 when five nuns including Sister Mary Frances Cusack (The Nun of Kenmare), who was also an author and publisher of many books, moved to Kenmare from their convent in Newry, County Down. Under the guidance of Mother Abbess O'Hagan in 1864 a lace-working industry was established and Kenmare lace became noted worldwide.The convent no longer exists and Pobalscoil Inbhear Sc√©ine secondary school occupies this site since 2001. A suspension bridge, which is claimed to be the first in Ireland, over the Kenmare River was opened in 1841 and served the community till 1932 when it was replaced by a new concrete bridge. During and after the Civil War (1922-1923), there were a number of incidents in Kenmare, including the killing of O'Connor brothers in September 1922 by Anti-Treaty forces, and an attack on the daughters of a local doctor in 1923 (the latter sometimes referred to as the 'Kenmare incident'). Kenmare was briefly held by Anti- Treaty forces during the Civil War, before being retaken by National Army troops in December 1922. The town library is one of the Carnegie Libraries funded by Andrew Carnegie. It opened in 1918, and the architect was R.M. Butler.Article from Kenmare Historical Society The library building is now home to the Carnegie Arts Centre and theatre, hosting a local drama group and a number of travelling productions each year, as well as music and comedy nights.Carnegie Arts Centre in Kenmare Co. Kerry : Drama, Music, Film, Dance and More Holy Cross Catholic Church in Kenmare was consecrated in 1864. It was built under the guidance of Archdeacon Fr. John O'Sullivan - who is interred within the church. The church has stained glass windows by O'Connor London (1863), by Caseys Dublin (1864) and by Earley Dublin (1864). The organ is by Telford & Telford(1865). Buried in the church grounds is Monsignor P F Cremin (died 2001), who was a periitus or theological expert at Vatican II. He was a native of Kenmare and had been Professor of Canon Law and Moral Theology at St Patrick's College, Maynooth from 1949 until 1980. He was a brother of Con Cremin, an Irish diplomat, who represented Ireland in France and Germany during World War II and subsequently in Portugal, the Holy See, the United Kingdom and at the United Nations. View of Main Street in Kenmare (between the 1880s and early 1900s) The Church of Ireland church of St Patrick celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2008.Church of Ireland Gazette, page 3, 3 October 2008 The town has been a winner in the Irish Tidy Towns Competition in 2013, 2000 and was a runner-up in 2003 and 2008. Tourism Kenmare lies on two noted Irish tourist routes, the Ring of Kerry and the Ring of Beara, approximately from Killarney. As a result, it is a popular tourist destination and many of the businesses in the area cater to tourists. The town is noted for its food and pubs. Since the late 1990s the tourism industry has driven local construction work, with land being sold at high prices to developers wishing to build estates of holiday homes. This has led to an increase in the town's population, particularly during the peak tourist season, and prompted fears among some residents that the town is becoming overdeveloped and losing much of its identity.Fast-changing times for Kenmare The Kerryman (registration required) Notable people Horse and cart in Kenmare. Inter- county Gaelic footballers Mickey 'Ned' O'Sullivan, Stephen O'Brien and Paul O'Connor are from the Kenmare area, while Pat Spillane is from nearby Templenoe. Kenmare is also the home of Irish Olympic slalom skier Thos Foley. Kenmare was home to composer Ernest John Moeran for a number of years up to his death and a local bar was named after him - but has since been renamed. Diplomat Con Cremin was also from Kenmare, as is senator Mark Daly. Writer Anna McPartlin grew up in Kenmare, and her 2007 novel Apart from the Crowd was set in the town. Francis Brennan is the owner of the five-star Park Hotel in Kenmare. He and his brother John, owner of the nearby Dromquinna Manor Hotel in Templenoe, are known for their TV series \\"At Your Service\\". Fair days Due to its location at the centre of a large agricultural area, Kenmare served as the local market town. Until the establishment of an auction mart in the early 1990s, the approximately monthly fair days were a time when farmers would stand their animals in the streets for sale to visiting stock dealers. The only fair which continues to be held is that of 15 August, which coincides with the Catholic Holy Day of Obligation marking the Assumption of Mary. The day attracts crowds of locals and visitors and is the busiest day of the year in Kenmare.

She was the second ship to be named for the city of Cleveland, Ohio. Cleveland was commissioned in June 1942, and saw extensive service in the war, briefly in the Atlantic, and then in the Pacific theater. Like almost all of her sister ships, she was decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, and never saw active service again. Cleveland was scrapped in the early 1960s. Construction and commissioning On 1 November 1941, Hull No. 423 was launched and christened USS Cleveland (CL-55). Built by New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey, and sponsored by Mrs. H. Burton, Cleveland was commissioned on 15 June 1942, with Captain E. W. Burrough in command. Service history Clearing Norfolk's Chesapeake Bay on 10 October 1942, Cleveland joined a task force off Bermuda (on 29 October) bound for the invasion of North Africa. Her firepower supported the landings at Fedhala, French Morocco on 8 November, and she remained on patrol until 12 November, returning to Norfolk on 24 November. Cleveland sailed for the Pacific on 5 December 1942, and arrived at Efate Island on 16 January. Her first mission in the consolidation of the Solomon Islands was with Task Force 18 (TF 18) to guard a troop convoy to Guadalcanal from 27 to 31 January, Cleveland fired on the enemy as she came under heavy air attack in the Battle of Rennell Island on 29‚Äì30 January. Joining TF 68, Cleveland steamed up \\"the Slot\\" on 6 March 1943 to bombard Japanese airfields at Vila on Kolombangara, then joined in the night action which sank the destroyers and in the battle of Blackett Strait. Command of Cleveland passed to Captain Andrew G. Shepard in June. Still with TF 68, \\"Merrill's Marauders\\", Cleveland fired in the bombardment of the Shortland Islands on 30 June and provided gun support for the invasion landings at Munda, New Georgia on 12 July. Following a short repair period at Sydney, Australia, Cleveland sailed for the preinvasion bombardment of the Treasury Islands on 26‚Äì27 October. Her task force steamed to blast Buka Island and Bonis on 1 November in support of the troops invading Bougainville, dashed south the same day to neutralize bases in the Shortlands, and that night intercepted a Japanese force in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay which was to win her a Navy Unit Commendation. Cleveland poured her radar-controlled fire into the four Japanese cruisers for over an hour, aiding in sinking , then chased the fleeing ships until daybreak. An air attack followed and one stick of bombs severely rocked Cleveland, who answered by splashing several of the enemy planes. She returned to Buka for another bombardment on 23 December, then patrolled between Truk and Green Island, Papua New Guinea from 13 to 18 February 1944 while American forces captured the latter. After supporting the capture of Emirau Island from 17 to 23 March, Cleveland sailed for replenishment and repairs at Sydney, Australia, then returned to the Solomons on 21 April to prepare for the Marianas operation. One practice bombardment on 20 May brought return fire unexpectedly which straddled the ship, but unharmed, she quickly silenced the shore batteries. From 8 June to 12 August, Cleveland participated in the Marianas operation. On 24 July, during the invasion of Tinian, Cleveland came to the aid of the destroyer . Norman Scott was hit six times within a few seconds by shore batteries. Cleveland maneuvered between Norman Scott and the shore batteries, preventing her from taking any more hits. She conducted softening-up bombardments and then gave fire support for invading troops until she joined TF 58 for the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19‚Äì20 June. Although few enemy aircraft penetrated the screen of American carrier planes, Cleveland was credited with splashing at least one enemy aircraft and assisting in downing another of the few which did get through. From 12 to 29 September, Cleveland participated in the invasion of the Palaus, then sailed from Manus Island on 5 October for a stateside overhaul. She arrived in Subic Bay on 9 February 1945, and sailed on to bombard Corregidor on 13‚Äì14 February, effectively neutralizing the fortress before the landings there. Continuing to support the consolidation of the Philippines, she covered the landings at Puerto Princesa, the Visayas, Panay, and the Malabang-Parang area on Mindanao. Cleveland put out from Subic Bay on 7 June to act as part of the covering force and provide fire support for the invasion landings at Brunei Bay, Borneo on 10 June. She returned to Subic Bay on 15 June, then sailed to Manila to embark General of the Army Douglas MacArthur and his staff as observers of the assault on Balikpapan. Arriving on 30 June, she fired in a pre-landing bombardment the next morning, and after General MacArthur had made an inspection tour of the landing area, got underway for Manila, arriving on 3 July. With a new cruiser task force, Cleveland sailed on 13 July to Okinawa, arriving on 16 July. From this base Task Force 95 made a series of sweeps against Japanese shipping until 7 August to insure Allied control of the East China Sea. Cleveland got underway from Okinawa on 9 September to support the occupation of Japan by covering the evacuation of Allied prisoners of war from Wakayama, then serving as part of a naval occupation group until the 6th Army made its landings on Honsh≈´. After a short stay in Tokyo Bay (28 October ‚Äì 1 November), Cleveland sailed for Pearl Harbor, San Diego, the Panama Canal, and Boston, arriving on 5 December for overhaul. She operated out of Newport on various training exercises, including a Naval Reserve training cruise to Bermuda in April 1946 and Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Quebec in June 1946, before reporting to Philadelphia for inactivation. Cleveland was placed out of commission in reserve there on 7 February 1947, until sold for scrap, 18 February 1960. Awards In addition to her Navy Unit Commendation, Cleveland received 13 battle stars for World War II service.

Most missionaries present in Palestine at the time were Evangelical Anglicans, but Blyth was from the Anglo-Catholic party of the Church of England. Finding that his use of St Paul's and Christ Church (both in Jerusalem) were limited, he resolved to found his own mission and build his own church. \\"He bought land in east Jerusalem where he built his cathedral and a missionary college, both called St. George's, making them the headquarters of a mission program independent of the two evangelical societies.\\" In order to fund the construction of the church, Blyth founded the Jerusalem and the East Mission. Under Bishop Samuel Gobat, relations with the Eastern Orthodox Church had become strained. Blyth was eager to restore relations with the Patriarch and as an Anglo-Catholic he had a great respect for the Patriarch's office. Because of this he always called St George's a collegiate church rather than a cathedral, saying that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was the one and only cathedral church of the city of Jerusalem. For this reason, St. George's contains a pool ‚Äì a rarity in Anglican churches ‚Äì which allows baptisms to be done through immersion, per Orthodox custom. Herbert Danby became the librarian there in 1919 and was residentiary canon from 1921 to 1936. The Israeli whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu has been residing at the cathedral since his release from prison in 2004. St. George's College is located on the grounds and offers continuing theological education for clergy and laity from around the world.

He is also known as Theodore of Antioch, from the place of his birth and presbyterate. He is the best known representative of the middle School of Antioch of hermeneutics. Life and work Theodore was born at Antioch, where his father held an official position and the family was wealthy (Chrysostom, ad Th. Laps. ii). Theodore's cousin, Paeanius, to whom several of John Chrysostom's letters are addressed, held an important post of civil government; his brother Polychronius became bishop of the metropolitan see of Apamea. Theodore first appears as the early companion and friend of Chrysostom, his fellow-townsman, his equal in rank, and but two or three years his senior in age. Together with their common friend Maximus,who was later bishop of Isaurian Seleucia, Chrysostom and Theodore attended the lectures of the Greek-speaking teacher of rhetoric Libanius (Socr. vi.3; Soz. viii.1), then at Antioch in the zenith of his fame. We have the assurance of Sozomen that he enjoyed a philosophical education. Chrysostom credits his friend with diligent study, but the luxurious life of polite Antioch seems to have received an equal share of his thoughts. When Chrysostom himself had been converted to the monastic life of Basil of Caesarea, he likewise converted Maximus and Theodore. The three friends left Libanius and sought a retreat in the monastic school of Carterius and Diodorus, to which Basil was already attached. It is unclear whether Theodore had been previously baptized before taking up monastic vows. Yet from the writings of Chrysostom it is clear he found joy in ascetic self-discipline, and he had just assumed a celibate life when he was fascinated by a girl named Hermione (Chrysostom ibid. i.), and contemplated marriage, at the same time returning to his former manner of life (Soz. viii.2). His \\"fall\\" spread consternation through the little society, and the anxiety drew forth from Chrysostom the earliest of his literary compositions‚Äîtwo letters \\"to Theodore upon his fall.\\" These compositions kept Theodore fast to his vows, although the disappointment left traces in his later life. Chrysostom's connection with Diodore was probably broken off in 374, when he plunged into a more complete monastic seclusion; Theodore's seems to have continued until the elevation of Diodore to the see of Tarsus in 378. During this period doubtless the foundations were laid of Theodore's understanding of the Bible and ecclesiastical doctrine, and he was imbued for life with the principles of scriptural interpretation which Diodore had inherited from an earlier generation of Antiochenes, and with the peculiar views of the Person of Christ into which the master had been led by his antagonism to Apollinaris of Laodicea. The latter years of this decade witnessed Theodore's first appearance as a writer. He began with a commentary on the Psalms, in which the method of Diodore was exaggerated, and which he lived to repent of (Facund. iii.6, x.1; v. infra, ¬ßIII). The orthodox at Antioch, it seems, resented the loss of the traditional Messianic interpretation, and, according to Hesychius of Jerusalem, Theodore was compelled to promise that he would commit his maiden work to the flames‚Äîa promise he contrived to evade (Mansi, ix.284). Gennadius of Marseilles (de Vir. Ill. 12) represents Theodore as a presbyter of the church of Antioch; and from a letter of John of Antioch (Facund. ii.2) we gather that forty-five years elapsed between his ordination and his death. That would mean he was ordained priest at Antioch in 383, in his thirty-third year, the ordaining bishop being doubtless Flavian, Diodore's old friend and fellow-laborer, whose \\"loving disciple\\" Theodore now became (John of Antioch, ap. Facund. l.c.). The epithet seems to imply that Theodore was an adherent of the Meletian party, but there is no evidence that he was involved in the feuds which preoccupied the Catholics of Antioch during Flavian's office. Theodore's great treatise on the Incarnation belongs to this period according to Gennadius, and possibly also more than one of his commentaries on the Old Testament. As a preacher he seems to have now attained some eminence in the field of polemics (Facund. viii.4). Theodore is said by Hesychius to have left Antioch while yet a priest and remained in Tarsus until 392, when he was consecrated to the see of Mopsuestia on the death of Olympius, probably through the influence of Diodore. Theodoret states he spent his remaining thirty-six years of life in this town. Mopsuestia was a free town (Pliny) upon the Pyramus (Ceyhan) river, between Tarsus and Issus, some forty miles from either, and twelve from the sea. It belonged to Cilicia Secunda, of which the metropolitan see was Anazarbus. In the 4th century it was of some importance, famous for its bridge, thrown over the Pyramus by Constantine I. Theodore's long episcopate was marked by no striking incidents. His letters, long known to the Assyrians as the Book of Pearls, are lost; his followers have left us few personal recollections. In 394 he attended a synod at Constantinople on a question which concerned the see of Bostra in the patriarchate of Antioch. While there, Theodore had the opportunity to preach before the emperor Theodosius I, who was then starting for his last journey to the West. The sermon made a deep impression, and Theodosius, who had sat at the feet of Ambrose and Gregory Nazianzus, declared that he had never met with such a teacher (John of Antioch, ap. Facund. ii.2). Theodosius II inherited his grandfather's respect for Theodore, and often wrote to him. Another glimpse of Theodore's episcopal life is supplied by a letter of Chrysostom to him from Cucusus (AD 404‚Äì407) (Chrys. Ep. 212). The exiled patriarch \\"can never forget the love of Theodore, so genuine and warm, so sincere and guileless, a love maintained from early years, and manifested but now.\\" Chrysostom (Ep. 204) thanks him profoundly for frequent though ineffectual efforts to obtain his release, and praises their friendship in such glowing terms that Theodore's enemies at the fifth Ecumenical Council made unsuccessful efforts to deny the identity of Chrysostom's correspondent with the bishop of Mopsuestia. Notwithstanding his literary activity, Theodore worked zealously for the good of his diocese. The famous letter of Ibas to Maris testifies that he struggled against extinguished Arianism and other heresies in Mopsuestia. Several of his works are doubtless monuments of these pastoral labors, e.g. the catechetical lectures, the ecthesis, and possibly the treatise on \\"Persian Magic.\\" Yet his episcopal work was by no means simply that of a diocesan bishop. Everywhere he was regarded as \\"the herald of the truth and the doctor of the church\\"; \\"even distant churches received instruction from him.\\" So Ibas explained to Maris, and his letter was read without a dissentient voice at the Council of Chalcedon (Facund. ii.i seq.). Theodore \\"expounded Scripture in all the churches of the East,\\" says John of Antioch (ibid. ii.2), with some literary license, and adds that in his lifetime Theodore was never arraigned by any of the orthodox. But in a letter to Nestorius (ibid. x.2) John begs him to retract, urging the example of Theodore, who, when in a sermon at Antioch he had said something which gave great and manifest offence, for the sake of peace and to avoid scandal, after a few days publicly corrected himself. Leontius tells us that the cause of offence was a denial to the Virgin Mary of the title Theotokos. So great was the storm that the people threatened to stone the preacher (Cyril of Alexandria Ep. 69). The heretical sects attacked by Theodore showed their resentment in a way less overt, but perhaps more formidable. They tampered with his writings, hoping thus to involve him in heterodox statements (Facund. x.1). Theodore's last years were complicated by two controversies. When in 418 the Pelagian leaders were deposed and exiled from the West, they sought in the East the sympathy of the chief living representative of the school of Antioch. This fact is recorded by Marius Mercator, who makes the most of it (Praef. ad Symb. Theod. Mop. 72). They probably resided with Theodore till 422, when Julian of Eclanum returned to Italy. Julian's visit was doubtless the occasion upon which Theodore wrote his book Against the Defenders of Original Sin. Mercator charges Theodore with having turned against Julian as soon as the latter had left Mopsuestia, and anathematized him in a provincial synod. The synod can hardly be a fabrication, since Mercator was a contemporary writer; but it was very possibly convened, as Fritzsche suggests, without any special reference to the Pelagian question. If Theodore then read his ecthesis, the anathema with which that ends might have been represented outside the council as a synodical condemnation of the Pelagian chiefs. Mercator's words, in fact, point to this explanation. A greater heresiarch than Julian visited Mopsuestia in the last year of his life. It is stated by Evagrius Scholasticus (H.E. i.2) that Nestorius, on his way from Antioch to Constantinople (AD 428), took counsel with Theodore and received from him the seeds of heresy which he shortly afterwards scattered with such disastrous results. Evagrius makes this statement on the authority of one Theodulus, a person otherwise unknown. We may safely reject it, so far as it derives the Christology of Nestorius from this single interview. Towards the close of 428 (Theodoret, H.E. v.39) Theodore died at the age of seventy-eight, having been all his life engaged in controversy, and more than once in conflict with the popular notions of orthodoxy; yet he departed, as Facundus (ii.1) triumphantly points out, in the peace of the church and at the height of a great reputation. The storm was gathering, but did not break until after his death. As the Catholic Encyclopedia points out, during his lifetime, Theodore was considered an orthodox Christian thinker. Posthumous legacy The popularity of Theodore increased following his death. Meletius, his successor at Mopsuestia, protested that his life would have been in danger if he had uttered a word against his predecessor (Tillemont, M√©m. xii. p. 442). \\"We believe as Theodore believed; long live the faith of Theodore!\\" was a cry often heard in the churches of the East (Cyril of Alexandria, Ep. 69). \\"We had rather be burnt than condemn Theodore,\\" was the reply of the bishops of Syria to the party eager for his condemnation (Ep. 72). The flame was fed by leading men who had been disciples of the Interpreter: by Theodoret, who regarded him as a \\"doctor of the universal church\\" (H. E. v. 39); by Ibas of Edessa, who in 433 wrote his famous letter to Maris in praise of Theodore; by John I of Antioch, who in 428 succeeded to the see of Antioch. Shortly after Theodore's death men in other quarters began to hold him up to obloquy. As early perhaps as 431 Marius Mercator denounced him as the real author of the Pelagian heresy (Lib. subnot. in verba Juliani, praef); and not long afterwards prefaced his translation of Theodore's ecthesis with a still more violent attack on him as the precursor of Nestorianism. The council of Ephesus, however, while it condemned Nestorius by name, did not mention Theodore. The Nestorian party consequently fell back upon the words of Theodore, and began to circulate them in several languages as affording the best available exposition of their views (Liberat. Brev. 10). This circumstance deepened the mistrust of the orthodox, and even in the East there were some who proceeded to condemn the teaching of Theodore. Hesychius of Jerusalem attacked him around 435 in his Ecclesiastical History; Rabbula, bishop of Edessa, who at Ephesus had sided with John of Antioch, now publicly anathematized Theodore (Ibas, Ep. ad Marin.). Patriarch Proclus of Constantinople demanded from the bishops of Syria a condemnation of certain propositions supposed to have been drawn from the writings of Theodore. Cyril, who had once spoken favourably of some of Theodore's works (Facund. viii.6), now under the influence of Rabbula took a decided attitude of opposition; he wrote to the synod of Antioch (Ep. 67) that the opinions of Diodore, Theodore, and others of the same schools had \\"borne down with full sail upon the glory of Christ\\"; to the emperor (Ep. 71), that Diodore and Theodore were the parents of the blasphemy of Nestorius; to Proclus (Ep. 72), that had Theodore been still alive and openly approved of the teaching of Nestorius, he ought undoubtedly to have been anathematized; but as he was dead, it was enough to condemn the errors of his books, having regard to the terrible disturbances more extreme measures would excite in the East. He collected and answered a series of propositions gathered from the writings of Diodore and Theodore, a work to which Theodoret replied shortly afterwards. The ferment then subsided for a time, but the disciples of Theodore, repulsed in the West, pushed their way from Eastern Syria to Persia. Ibas, who succeeded Rabbula in 435, restored the School of Edessa, and it continued to be a nursery of Theodore's theology till suppressed by Emperor Zeno in 489 and found refuge at Nisibis. Among the Nestorians of Persia the writings of Theodore were regarded as the standard both of doctrine and of interpretation, and the Persian church returned the censures of the orthodox by pronouncing an anathema on all who opposed or rejected them (cf. Assem. iii.i.84; and for a full account of the spread of Theodore's opinions at Edessa and Nisibis see Kihn, Theodor und Junilius, pp. 198‚Äì209, 333‚Äì336). The 6th century witnessed another and final outbreak of hatred against Theodore. The fifth general council (553), under the influence of the emperor Justinian I, pronounced the anathema which neither Theodosius II nor Cyril thought to issue. This condemnation of Theodore and his two supporters led to the Controversy of the Three Chapters but we may point out one result of Justinian's policy. The African delegation objected not only to a decree which seemed to negate the authority of the councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon, but also violated the sanctity of the dead; they had no particular interest in Theodore's doctrine or method of interpretation. Bishop Pontian plainly told the emperor that he had asked them to condemn men of whose writings they knew nothing. But the stir about Theodore led to inquiry; his works, or portions of them, were translated and circulated in the West. It is almost certainly to this cause that we owe the preservation in a Latin dress of at least one-half of Theodore's commentaries on Paul. Published under the name of Ambrose of Milan, the work of Theodore passed from Africa into the monastic libraries of the West, was copied into the compilations of Rabanus Maurus and others, and in its fuller and its abridged form supplied the Middle Ages with an accepted interpretation of an important part of the Bible. The name of Theodore, however, disappears almost entirely from Western church literature after the 6th century. It was scarcely before the 19th century that justice was done by Western writers to the importance of the great Antiochene as a theologian, an expositor and a precursor of later thought. Solomon of Bassora, a thirteenth-century bishop of the Church of the East, quoted Theodore as well as Isaac of Nineveh and Diodorus of Tarsus as authorities to support the contention that the torment of hell will have an end and that the punished sinners will be reformed in the end. Literary remains Facundus (x.4) speaks of Theodore's \\"innumerable books\\"; John of Antioch, in a letter quoted by Facundus (ii.2), describes his polemical works as alone numbering \\"decem millia\\" (i.e. muria), an exaggeration of course, but based on fact. A catalogue of such of his writings as were once extant in Syriac translations is given by Ebedjesu, Nestorian metropolitan of Soba), AD 1318 (J. S. Assem. Bibl. Orient. iii.i. pp. 30 seq.). These Syriac translations filled 41 tomes. Only one whole work remains. His commentary on the minor prophets has been preserved and was published by Mai (Rome, 1825‚Äì1832) and Wegnern. Its exegetical value is diminished by Theodore's absolute confidence in the Septuagint. It is noteworthy for its independence of earlier hermeneutical authorities and Theodore's reluctance to admit a Christological reference. It is marked by his usual defects of style; it is nevertheless a considerable monument of his expository power, and the best illustration we possess of the Antiochene method of interpreting Old Testament prophecy. A fortunate discovery in the 19th century gave us a complete Latin translation of the commentary on Galatians and the nine following epistles, which were published in two volumes by Henry Barclay Swete (Cambridge: 1880, 1882). The Latin, apparently the work of an African churchman of the time of the Fifth council, abounds in colloquial and semi-barbarous forms; the version is not always careful, and sometimes almost hopelessly corrupt (published by Cambridge University Press, 1880‚Äì1882). But this translation gives us the substance of Theodore's interpretation of the apostle Paul, and so we have a typical commentary from his pen on a considerable portion of each Testament. Theodore's commentaries on the rest of the Bible have survived only in quotations and excerpts. His commentary on Genesis is cited by Cosmas Indicopleustes, John Philoponus, and Photius (Cod. 3, 8). Latin fragments are found in the Acts of the second council of Constantinople, and an important collection of Syriac fragments from the Nitrian manuscripts of the British Museum was published by Dr. Eduard Sachau (Th. Mops. Fragm. Syriaca, Lips. 1869, pp. 1‚Äì21). Photius, criticizing the style of this work in words more or less applicable to all the remains of Theodore, notices the writer's opposition to the allegorical method of interpretation. Ebedjesu was struck by the care and elaboration bestowed upon the work. The printed fragments of his commentaries on the Psalms, in Greek and Latin, fill 25 columns in Migne. More recently attention has been called to a Syriac version (Baethgen), and new fragments of a Latin version and of the original Greek have been printed. His preference for historically sensitive interpretation led him to deny the application to Christ of all but three or four of the Psalms usually regarded as Messianic. Evidently, he later came to regard the book as somewhat hasty and premature. Besides pieces of his commentaries on books from the Old and New Testament, we have fragments or notices of his writings on various topics. Chief amongst these, and first in point of time, was his treatise in fifteen books, on the Incarnation. According to Gennadius (de Vir. Ill. 12) it was directed against the Apollinarians and Eunomians, and written while the author was yet a presbyter of Antioch. Gennadius adds an outline of the contents. After a logical and scriptural demonstration of the truth and perfection of each of the natures in Christ, Theodore deals more at length with the Sacred Manhood. In book 14, he discusses the subject of the Trinity and the relation of the creation to the Divine. Large fragments of this treatise have been collected from various quarters. None of the remains of Theodore throw such important light upon his Christology. Works that have not survived as well include: his de Apollinario et eius Haeresi and other polemics against Apollinarianism; and a separate polemic against Eunomius of Cyzicus, professing to be a defense of Basil of Caesarea. Photius mentions that Theodore wrote three books on \\"Persian Magic\\" where he not only attacked Zoroastrianism, but according to Photius also betrayed his \\"Nestorian\\" views and defended belief in the final restoration of all men. Ebedjesu includes in his list \\"two tomes on the Holy Spirit\\", probably a work directed against the heresy of the Pneumatomachi; and \\"two tomes against him who asserts that sin is inherent in human nature.\\" The last works were considered by Marius Mercator, a friend of Augustine, as an attack on Pelagius, but may have actually been directed at Jerome. Lastly, Leontius intimates that Theodore wrote a portion of a liturgy; \\"not content with drafting a new creed, he sought to impose upon the church a new Anaphora\\". A Syriac liturgy ascribed to \\"Mar Teodorus the Interpreter\\" is still used by the Assyrian Christians for a third of the year, from Advent to Palm Sunday. The proanaphoral and post- communion portions are supplied by the older liturgy \\"of the Apostles\\" (so called), the anaphora only being peculiar. Internal evidence confirms the judgment of Dr. Neale, who regards it as a genuine work of Theodore. His lost work on the incarnation was discovered in 1905 in a Syriac translation in the mountains of northern Iraq in a Nestorian monastery. The manuscript was acquired by the scholar-archbishop Addai Scher and placed in his episcopal library at Seert. Unfortunately it was lost in the destruction of that library by Turkish troops during the massacres of Christians 1915, without ever being photographed or copied, so is today lost.

Greeting is an act of communication in which human beings intentionally make their presence known to each other, to show attention to, and to suggest a type of relationship (usually cordial) or social status (formal or informal) between individuals or groups of people coming in contact with each other. Greetings are sometimes used just prior to a conversation or to greet in passing, such as on a sidewalk or trail. While greeting customs are highly culture- and situation-specific and may change within a culture depending on social status and relationship, they exist in all known human cultures. Greetings can be expressed both audibly and physically, and often involve a combination of the two. This topic excludes military and ceremonial salutes but includes rituals other than gestures. A greeting, or salutation, can also be expressed in written communications, such as letters and emails. Some epochs and cultures have had very elaborate greeting rituals, e.g. greeting a sovereign. Conversely, secret societies have often furtive or arcane greeting gestures and rituals, such as a secret handshake, which allows members to recognize each other. In some languages and cultures, the same word or gesture is used as both greeting and farewell. Examples are \\"Good day\\" in English, \\"Sat Shri Akaal\\" in Punjabi, \\"As-Salamualaikum\\" in Arabic, \\"Aloha\\" in Hawaiian, \\"Shalom\\" in Hebrew, \\"Namaste\\" in Hindi,\\"Ayubowan\\" in Sri Lanka and \\"Ciao\\" in Italian. The bow and handshake are also used for both greeting and leave-taking. And in many south Asian countries like Sri Lanka and India, they put their arms together and place it near to heart which shows they are greeting from the bottom of the heart. In India they say \\"Namaste\\" and in Sri Lanka they say \\"Ayubowan\\" which means live longer. Greeting gestures The civilian Secretary General of NATO Joseph Luns from the Netherlands tips his hat at a troop review in 1983, in lieu of a military salute. This (the full gesture is shown here) was by then becoming old-fashioned as a general social greeting, but had once been normal. A greeting can consist of an exchange of formal expression, kisses, handshakes, hugs, and various gestures. The form of greeting is determined by social etiquette, as well as by the relationship of the people. Beyond the formal greeting, which may involve a verbal acknowledgment and sometimes a handshake, facial expression, gestures, body language, and eye contact can all signal what type of greeting is expected.Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2006). Greetings forms in English and Persian: A sociopragmatic perspective. International Journal of Language, Culture, and Society, 17. online. Gestures are the most obvious signal, for instance, greeting someone with open arms is generally a sign that a hug is expected. However, crossing arms can be interpreted as a sign of hostility. The facial expression, body language, and eye contact reflect emotions and interest level. A frown, slouching and lowered eye contact suggests disinterest, while smiling and an exuberant attitude is a sign of welcome. Many different gestures are used throughout the world as simple greetings. In Western cultures, the handshake is very common, though it has numerous subtle variations in the strength of grip, the vigour of the shake, the dominant position of one hand over the other, and whether or not the left hand is used. Historically, when men normally wore hats out of doors, male greetings to people they knew, and sometimes those they did not, involved touching, raising slightly (\\"tipping\\"), or removing their hat in a variety of gestures. This basic gesture remained normal in very many situations from the Middle Ages until men typically ceased wearing hats in the mid-20th century. Hat-raising began with an element of recognition of superiority, where only the socially inferior party might perform it, but gradually lost this element; King Louis XIV of France made a point of at least touching his hat to all women he encountered. However, the gesture was never used by women, for whom their head-covering included considerations of modesty. When a man was not wearing a hat he might touch his hair to the side of the front of his head to replicate a hat-tipping gesture. This was typically performed by lower classmen to social superiors, such as peasants to the land-owner, and is known as \\"tugging the forelock\\", which still sometimes occurs as a metaphor for submissive behaviour. The Arabic term salaam (literally \\"peace\\", from the spoken greeting that accompanies the gesture), refers to the practice of placing the right palm on the heart, before and after a handshake. In Moroccan society, same-sex people don't greet each other the same as do opposite sex. While same-sex people (men or women) will shake hands, kiss on the cheek and even hug multiple times, a man and woman greeting each other in public won't go further than a handshake. Which is due to the Moroccan culture that is quite conservative. Verbal greetings in Morocco can go from a basic salaam, to asking about life details to make sure the other person is doing good. In the kingdom of Morocco, you should always greet with your right hand as the left hand is traditionally considered unclean. Êã±Êâã) practised by Tsai Ing-wen, President of the Republic of China (Taiwan). A Chinese greeting features the right fist placed in the palm of the left hand and both shaken back and forth two or three times, it may be accompanied by a head nod or bow. The gesture may be used on meeting and parting, and when offering thanks or apologies. In India, it is common to see the Namaste greeting (or \\"Sat Sri Akal\\" for Sikhs) where the palms of the hands are pressed together and held near the heart with the head gently bowed. Adab, meaning respect and politeness, is a hand gesture used as a Muslim greeting of South Asian Muslims, especially of Urdu-speaking communities of Uttar Pradesh, Hyderabadi Muslims, Bengali Muslims and Muhajir people of Pakistan. The gesture involves raising the right hand towards the face with palm inwards such that it is in front of the eyes and the fingertips are almost touching the forehead, as the upper torso is bent forward. It is typical for the person to say \\"adab arz hai\\", or just \\"adab\\". It is often answered with the same or the word \\"Tasleem\\" is said as an answer or sometimes it is answered with a facial gesture of acceptance. In Indonesia, a nation with a huge variety of cultures and religions, many greetings are expressed, from the formalized greeting of the highly stratified and hierarchical Javanese to the more egalitarian and practical greetings of outer islands. Javanese, Batak and other ethnicities currently or formerly involved in the armed forces will salute a Government-employed superior, and follow with a deep bow from the waist or short nod of the head and a passing, loose handshake. Hand position is highly important; the superior's hand must be higher than the inferior's. Muslim men will clasp both hands, palms together at the chest and utter the correct Islamic slametan (greeting) phrase, which may be followed by cheek-to-cheek contact, a quick hug or loose handshake. Pious Muslim women rotate their hands from a vertical to the perpendicular prayer-like position in order to barely touch the fingertips of the male greeter and may opt-out of the cheek-to-cheek contact. If the male is an Abdi Dalem royal servant, courtier or particularly \\"peko-peko\\" (taken directly from Japanese to mean obsequious) or even a highly formal individual, he will retreat backwards with head downcast, the left arm crossed against the chest and the right arm hanging down, never showing his side or back to his superior. His head must always be lower than that of his superior. Younger Muslim males and females will clasp their elder's or superior's outstretched hand to the forehead as a sign of respect and obeisance. If a manual worker or a person with obviously dirty hands salute or greets an elder or superior, he will show deference to his superior and avoid contact by bowing, touching the right forehead in a very quick salute or a distant \\"slamet\\" gesture. The traditional Javanese Sungkem involves clasping the palms of both hands together, aligning the thumbs with the nose, turning the head downwards and bowing deeply, bending from the knees. In a royal presence, the one performing sungkem would kneel at the base of the throne. A gesture called a wai is used in Thailand, where the hands are placed together palm to palm, approximately at nose level, while bowing. The wai is similar in form to the gesture referred to by the Japanese term gassho by Buddhists. In Thailand, the men and women would usually press two palms together and bow a little while saying \\"Sawadee ka\\" (female speaker) or \\"Sawadee krap\\" (male speaker). Kisses Denis Thatcher, husband of former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher, greets former American First Lady Nancy Reagan by kissing her hand, 1988 In Europe, the formal style of upper-class greeting used by a man to a woman in the Early Modern Period was to hold the woman's presented hand (usually the right) with his right hand and kiss it while bowing. In cases of a low degree of intimacy, the hand is held but not kissed. The ultra- formal style, with the man's right knee on the floor, is now only used in marriage proposals, as a romantic gesture. Cheek kissing is common in Europe, parts of Canada (Quebec) and Latin America and has become a standard greeting mainly in Southern Europe but also in some Central European countries. While cheek kissing is a common greeting in many cultures, each country has a unique way of kissing. In Russia, Poland, Slovenia, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Iran and Egypt it is customary to \\"kiss three times, on alternate cheeks\\", but kiss twice in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Italians, Hungarians and Romanians usually kiss twice in a greeting and in Mexico and Belgium only one kiss is necessary. In the Galapagos women kiss on the right cheek only and in Oman, it is not unusual for men to kiss one another on the nose after a handshake. French culture accepts a number of ways to greet depending on the region. Two kisses are most common throughout all of France but in Provence three kisses are given and in Nantes four are exchanged. However, in Finist√®re at the western tip of Brittany and Deux-S√®vres in the Poitou-Charentes region, one kiss is preferred.

Name The original name for these small tablets of liquorice is a \\"Pomfret\\" cake, after the old Norman name for Pontefract. However, that name has fallen into disuse and they are now almost invariably labelled \\"Pontefract cakes\\". The term \\"cake\\" has a long history. The word itself is of Germanic origin, from the Germanic \\"kak√¢\\" (cook). History The exact origins of liquorice growing in England remain uncertain. However, by the 16th century there is record of the activity, possibly via monastic gardens and as a garden crop for the gentry. During the 17th century it was recorded as being grown in areas with alluvial soil overlying magnesian limestone such as in Surrey, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. Camden's Britannia of 1637 noted the crop in Worksop and Pontefract.John Chartres \\"A special crop and its markets in the 18th century: the case of Pontefract's Liquorice\\" in People, Landscape and Alternative Agriculture Essays for Joan Thirsk. ed. R W Hoyle The Agricultural History Review Supplement, Series 3, 2004 , p. 116. By 1780 liquorice growing was concentrated almost wholly in Pontefract and in Surrey, around Godalming. In Pontefract the growing of liquorice was done on plots of land behind people's houses. In a map of the 1648 Siege of Pontefract (reproduced in Chartres) the liquorice is indicated as being grown in \\"garths\\" either side of Micklegate, the street which runs between Pontefract's Market Place and the castle. In the 18th century liquorice was used as a medicine both for humans and for horses. The Pontefract cake \\"was almost certainly a black cake, the portable lozenge used to make 'liquorish water', stamped with the castle lodge emblem of Pontefract to signify quality. This trade mark had been employed on Pontefract cakes since 1612, when the initials 'GS' were used, and are thought to be those of Sir George Savile, major local landowner; and a second die-stamp from 1720.\\"Chartes 2004, p. 118. It was only in the 19th century that it was used extensively for confectionery. Of the merchants in the 18th century, apothecary chemist George Dunhill (later bought by German confectioner Haribo) was the most important. In 1760, Dunhill added sugar to the medicinal liquorice; he was also a grower of liquorice.Chartes 2004, p. 124 Table 1. With the growth of Pontefract cakes as confectionery the demand for liquorice outstripped the capacity of Pontefract growers to supply. By the late 19th century the twelve firms producing liquorice confectionery relied mainly on extract imported largely from Turkey.Chartres 2004, p. 132. Production and design Originally, the sweets were embossed by hand with a stamp, to form their traditional look (the workers who did this were known as \\"cakers\\" and were able to produce upwards of 30,000 per day), but now they are usually machinery formed. The embossed stamp was originally a stylised image of Pontefract Castle with a raven on the top bar, which is thought to have been in use for almost 400 years. When the first secret ballot in the United Kingdom was held in Pontefract on 15 August 1872, the ballot box used was sealed using a Pontefract cake stamp from Frank Dunhill's factory, which shows the image of a castle and an owl. Health warning In 2004, healthcare professionals warned against overindulgence in Pontefract cake after a 56-year-old woman was admitted to hospital following an overdose. The woman consumed about daily, leading to dangerously low potassium levels and subsequent muscle failure. Earlier in 2004, the European Commission had recommended limiting consumption of the active ingredient, glycyrrhizic acid, to 100 mg or less per day. Literary references In Elizabeth Gaskell‚Äôs 1866 novel Wives and Daughters, Mr Gibson, the local doctor and one of the main characters, says in discussion with the father of one of his apprentices: ‚ÄúMust my boy make the pills himself then?‚Äù asked the major ruefully. ‚ÄúTo be sure.

It is located near the suburb Pirita, six km north-east of the Tallinn city center. With its 313 m (1030.2 ft), the TV tower is the tallest building in Tallinn. The tower was officially opened on 11 July 1980. The viewing platform at a height of 170 metres was open to the public until 26 November 2007, when it was closed for renovation. The tower began receiving visitors again on 5 April 2012. The building is administered by the public company Levira (formerly Estonian Broadcasting Transmission Center Ltd) and is a member of the World Federation of Great Towers. The architects were David Baziladze and Juri Sinis, the engineers Vladimir Obydov and Yevgeny Ignatov. The construction work was supervised by Aleksander Ehala. The cornerstone was laid on 30 September 1975, and the building was inaugurated 11 July 1980 (although the first transmission took place in 1979). The tower body was constructed of reinforced concrete rings 50 cm thick that weigh a total of 17,000 tonnes, and the total tower weight is approximately 20,000 tonnes. The tower survived a fire during construction. The observation deck on the 21st floor, originally designed to have a rotating section, is located 170 m above ground and has a diameter of 38 m. The tower was closed to the public on 26 November 2007. Before it was closed, tickets were priced at 60 Estonian kroon and, aside from an infrequently used concrete and metal staircase, the observation deck was accessed by two elevators. The Vilnius TV tower has a similar architectural design but features a rotating observation deck 165 m above ground. The structure consists of a 190-metre reinforced concrete tower and a 124-metre metal mast on top of it. Under the tower is a two-storey building with equipment rooms, entrance halls and a conference centre. The diameter of the tower at its base is 15.2 metres and the wall thickness is 50 cm. The diameter of the tower from 140 metres up is 8.2 metres. A total of 10,000 m3 of concrete and 1,900 tonnes of steel were used in the construction. The Tallinn TV tower was reopened on 5 April 2012 with completely new interior design made by KOKO Arhitektid. Local guide books advertise the observation deck's views of Tallinn and extending to the Gulf of Finland. The tower is described as having a 1980s Soviet feel and a restaurant is located on the observation floor. Bullet holes dating from the Soviet coup attempt of 1991 are still visible at the base of the tower. 1991 defense of Estonia A widely known account tells of a handful of radio operators who in 1991 risked their lives to protect the free media of the reborn Republic of Estonia from Soviet troops. The defenders placed a matchbox between the elevator door and frame in such a manner that the elevator wouldn't work, leaving the approximately 1,000 tower steps as the only route to the top for the Soviets. The operators also had an oxygen-removing fire-fighting system at their disposal. Triggering the system would have asphyxiated everyone in the tower, including the defenders themselves. However, it is not known if the system was operational or if the threat to deploy it was a bluff. The story is well known in Estonia; it is also part of the movie August 1991 and is mentioned at length in the documentary The Singing Revolution. Tallinn TV tower‚Äôs structural features Thirty-two building enterprises participated in the construction of the Tallinn TV tower. The TV tower was designed by specialists at the State Design Institute of the Ministry of Communications in Moscow. The chief engineer was Yevgeny Ignatov, the chief designer was Vladimir Obydov and the architects were Juri Sinis and David Basiladze. The team faced two challenges: to choose a suitable tower structure and select the best location for it. The structure selected was a freely supported base part from reinforced concrete and steel upper part serving as the antenna, with a total height of 314 metres. The internal space of such a TV tower made from reinforced concrete is sufficient for installation of all the necessary equipment and addition of a viewing platform with a restaurant, accessed via a high-speed lift. The height of the tower is such that it is capable of transmitting excellent radio and television signals to distances of up to 90 kilometres in ideal weather conditions. Several factors were taken into account for the location: the required distance from densely populated urban areas to ensure proper signal reception, geological features of the local soil, distance from the airport, and impact on Tallinn's skyline. The chosen spot was 8 kilometres from the city centre, in a rest and recreation zone not far from the botanical garden and a motor sports club. The location is 23 metres above sea level. The tower, clearly visible from the city and from the sea, dominates the surrounding landscape and affects the local architecture. The structure of the tower can be divided into three sections: the foundation, the tower itself from reinforced concrete (190 m) and the steel antenna (124 m). From 150‚Äì182 metres the tower contains a superstructure that is 38 metres in diameter, housing the viewing platform, the restaurant and the equipment room for commercial radio stations. The two-storey building that surrounds the base of the tower is also 38 metres in diameter and contains technical and auxiliary facilities. The foundation slab made from reinforced concrete is 38 metres in diameter, 2.5 metres thick and buried 8.5 metres below ground level. This slab supports a tower of reinforced concrete that is 15.2 metres in diameter at the base and only 8.2 metres in diameter at a height of 180 metres. The wall thickness in the lower part is 500 mm and 350 mm in the upper part; this is to ensure tower stability even in strong storm conditions. Before 1967 all tall structures had been built in Estonia in compliance with the safety requirements applicable to structures situated in areas with the second wind strength level. After a storm in 1967, with the wind speed reaching 42 metres per second, the TV tower was designed in compliance with the fourth wind strength level requirements. The mass total of the tower is over 20,000 tons. The centre of gravity of the structure is in the base of the tower, which is why it could not fall over even if the foundation slab were on the surface of the ground. The general contractor was the Tallinn Construction Trust and the subcontractors were the Reinforced Concrete Construction Trust, the Metal Structures Trust and the Radio Construction Trust. The work was commissioned by the TV Tower Construction Directorate of the Ministry of Communications of the Estonian SSR, with Vootele T√µsine as its director. Construction work Several new technical solutions were implemented during the construction of the TV tower. The reinforced concrete tower itself was assembled using the sliding mold method. The concrete mold was installed at a height of 2.5 metres; then the armature was inserted and the concrete poured. After that the concrete form was shifted upwards, narrowed to the new diameter and the new section of reinforced concrete created. Today the rings resulting from this process can still be seen at 2.5-metre intervals on the tower. The concrete was poured continuously for 8 months, with the tower gradually rising above the landscape. The builders used M-400 concrete based on oil shale ash and Portland cement. This concrete had been developed by the scientists at the Tallinn Polytechnical Institute under the supervision of Verner Kikas. The concrete was designed to withstand 300 frost resistance cycles. Subsequent inspections have revealed that the strength of this concrete is even higher than stipulated. The antenna part of the structure is made from steel cylinders. The metal antenna was installed using the ejection method. At first a smaller-diameter cylinder was lifted to the necessary spot; then over it was placed a larger-diameter cylinder and the smaller cylinder was pushed up through it with blocks and winches. The assembly was completed by attaching to each cylinder the television and ultra short-wave transmitter vibrators. The upper metal framework, weighing over 120 tons, was assembled on the ground around the base of the tower and then raised to 170 metres. From start to finish all building work was supervised by foreman Aleksander Ehala and team master V√§ino Saar. They often had to solve complicated problems and the designers always agreed with their solutions. The TV tower is regularly checked for geodetic compliance: foundation settling, vertical deviation, condition of reinforced concrete and metal components, and other parameters. The allowed sway of the top of the TV tower due to wind is 1.5 metres; of the viewing platform, 90 cm. Besides winds, the tower is affected by solar heating, resulting in the top ‚Äúdrawing‚Äù a peculiar curve. The steel part, from 190 m to 260 m, has a lift for two persons and hatches for access to the external platforms for the purpose of inspection and repairs of the antenna equipment. In the tower below the antenna section there is also a staircase with 1,050 steps from the basement to a height of 190 metres.

A welder's negligence had caused the cables in the tower shaft to catch fire. The draught was strong because the structure acted like a giant chimney. The fire thus progressed quickly up the tower from the point of origin on the 5th storey. Saar managed to outrace the conflagration and cut the cables on the 23rd storey, thus preventing the fire from reaching the metal part of the tower. Had the antenna structure been subjected to heat from the fire, it might have collapsed. The fire damage was repaired within one month. Over the decades the antenna equipment on the TV tower underwent a major overhaul. Due to the introduction of the FM waveband the radio antennas were rebuilt. But an accident ensued during installation of a 12-metre pipe-shaped antenna for the 45th television channel transmitter at the very tip of the tower. J√ºri Makarov was a prominent local businessman who created a new television station, Tipp TV, and that included installation on the TV tower of an Italian-made transmitter for the channel. The corresponding antenna, a 12-metre pipe, had been purchased in the United States, and Makarov arranged to install it with the aid of a helicopter commissioned from St. Petersburg. The helicopter successfully removed an old radio antenna from the top of the tower. In the early morning on 19 May 1994 the helicopter took off with the new antenna. The helicopter, with the antenna suspended under it on a cable, attempted to manoeuvre to insert the end of the antenna into its slot. The wind was disruptive, its force reaching 8. When the antenna touched the tower, the pilots mistakenly assumed that it had gone into the slot and released the cable. The falling antenna hit the restaurant roof and grazed the railing. The roof of the viewing platform and its windows shattered. The antenna itself broke as well. A new antenna was later sent and specialists successfully installed it under the supervision of leading engineer Vitali Lonkin. Saar oversaw the repairs to the restaurant roof.

History Barnes was formed as an urban district in 1894 and became a municipal borough in 1932. It contained the settlements of Barnes, Mortlake and East Sheen. It was part of the London postal district and Metropolitan Police District. The district was bounded by the County of London to the east, the River Thames and Middlesex to the north, and the Municipal Borough of Richmond to the west and south. The council met at 123 Mortlake High Street from 1895 until 1940, when the building was damaged by wartime bombing. After the war the council met at the Penryn Rooms in East Sheen. In 1965 it was abolished and its former area became part of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.  Coat of arms  The district's coat of arms, granted in 1932, was: Azure a saltire or between four ostrich feathers argent two oars in saltire proper that to the dexter bladed dark blue and that to the sinister bladed light blue. The supporters were: Two griffins gules langued and armed azure, the dexter gorged with a collar flory or, charged with four crosses pat√©e fitchy sable, the sinister gorged with a like collar charged with four lozenges, also sable. There was no crest. The oars belonged to the boat race teams of the University of Oxford (dark blue) and the University of Cambridge (light blue), whose course on the River Thames ran along the borough's northern border, finishing at Mortlake. The feathers were derived from the Prince of Wales at the time of the grant (later Edward VIII and Duke of Windsor) whose birthplace, White Lodge, lay in the former borough. The griffins were derived from the arms of the Earls Spencer, who were once lords of the manor of Mortlake. The crosses came from the arms of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who also once held the same manor, and the lozenges from the arms of the Bishop of Southwark, in whose diocese the borough was situated. The oars became part of the coat of arms of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, along with the red griffin supporters. References External links * Barnes ...

The English translation of the name is Twenty-fifth of May, which is the date of Argentina's May Revolution in 1810. The ship previously served in the Royal Navy as and the Royal Netherlands Navy as HNLMS Karel Doorman. She was deployed south during the Beagle Crisis in 1978 and in the first weeks of the Falklands War (), where her aircraft were deployed against the Royal Navy task force, but spent the bulk of the war in port. History ARA Veinticinco de Mayo badge with the motto \\"Juramos con gloria morir\\" which means \\"We swear to die gloriously\\", a reference to the Argentine National Anthem. The ship was built for the Royal Navy by Cammell Laird in Birkenhead, England during the Second World War.Ireland, p. 147 As a Colossus- class aircraft carrier, she was named and saw service in the British Pacific Fleet. Venerable only served three years in the Royal Navy before being sold to the Netherlands as HNLMS Karel Doorman. After a boiler room fire, the carrier was rebuilt, and sold to Argentina. The Argentines already operated a carrier, ARA Independencia, also a former Royal Navy Colossus-class. After Independencia was decommissioned in 1970, Veinticinco de Mayo was the sole remaining carrier in the Argentine fleet. She could carry up to 24 aircraft. The air group started with F9F Panthers and F9F Cougar jets and later these were replaced with A-4Q Skyhawks supported by S-2 Tracker anti-submarine warfare aircraft and Sikorsky Sea King helicopters. In September 1969, during the voyage of the recently bought Veinticinco de Mayo from the Netherlands, Hawker Siddeley demonstrated their Harrier GR.1 on board the carrier for a possible sale to the Argentine Navy. A-4Q taking off from Veinticinco de Mayo, circa 1982 During the 1970s the ship was refitted and updated several times, though in each case the duration of each repair period was never more than 3‚Äì5 months, allowing her to be available to deploy. Her last pre-Falklands refit occurred during 1981, when she received an update to her radar, arresting gear, steam catapult and (most noticeably) the forward edge of the port side angled deck was filled out via an enlarged sponson. These improvements would theoretically enable her to operate the Super Etendard strike aircraft purchased from France, but it was discovered during testing that the catapult had difficulties launching the aircraft type. As a result, her strike airwing was limited to the A-4Q Skyhawks. Beagle Conflict See Operation Soberania Veinticinco de Mayo, between 1978 and 1980 During the Operation Soberania Veinticinco de Mayo was planned to support the invasion of the Picton, Nueva and Lennox islands.

Her aircraft were not used during the invasion. Later, in defence of the occupation, she was deployed in a task force north of the Falkland Islands, with ARA General Belgrano to the south. The British had assigned , a nuclear- powered submarine, to track down Veinticinco de Mayo and sink her if necessary.

Veinticinco de Mayos S-2 Trackers detected the British fleet late that day, and a strike by all eight A-4Q Skyhawk jets was prepared, scheduled to take-off at dawn. The attack, did not take place, because subsequent Tracker sorties had failed to relocate the British fleet.Burden et al 1986, pp. 39‚Äì40, 49‚Äì50 After the British nuclear-powered submarine sank General Belgrano, Veinticinco de Mayo returned to port.Burden et al 1986, p. 50 The naval A-4Q Skyhawks flew the rest of the war from the airbase in R√≠o Grande, Tierra del Fuego, and had some success against the Royal Navy, sinking .

From 1986, problems in her engines largely confined her to port; rendering her unserviceable.Gardiner and Chumbley 1995, p. 6 Work began in 1988 to refit the carrier, with it being planned to replace her steam turbines with gas turbines, while providing an auxiliary steam plant to power the ship's steam catapults. By 1994, the ship's machinery had been removed, but a shortage of funds led to work stopping.Hobbs 2013, p. 195 In December 1996, the Argentine Navy announced that Veinticinco de Mayo would be discarded.Baker 1998, p. 7. By this time, she had already been stripped of various major pieces of equipment, which were used as spares for the Brazilian carrier NAeL Minas Gerais, another Colossus-class ship which had been heavily modified in the Netherlands. Finally, in 2000, she was towed to Alang, India for scrapping. Although Minas Gerais was offered to the Argentine Navy in 2000 as a replacement, she was rejected, due to her poor condition and high restoration and maintenance costs. Argentine cooperation with Brazil has meant that the naval air wing continued to operate from the deck of carrier NAe S√£o Paulo during ARAEX exercises while she was in service, and/or touch-and-go landings on US Navy carriers when they are in transit within Argentine coastal waters during Gringo-Gaucho manoeuvres.

A plate warns to only engage the unit in third and fourth gears. Overdrive is the operation of an automobile cruising at sustained speed with reduced engine revolutions per minute (RPM), leading to better fuel consumption, lower noise, and lower wear. Use of the term is confused, as it is applied to several different, but related, meanings. The most fundamental meaning is that of an overall gear ratio between engine and wheels, such that the car is over-geared, and cannot reach its potential top speed, i.e. the car could travel faster if it were in a lower gear, with the engine turning at higher RPM. 1960s Triumph gearbox with Laycock de Normanville electro- hydraulic operated overdrive Laycock de Normanville \\"J type\\" overdrive unit The purpose of such a gear may not be immediately obvious. The power produced by an engine increases with the engine's RPM to a maximum, then falls away. The point of maximum power is somewhat lower than the absolute maximum RPM to which the engine is limited, the \\"redline\\" RPM. A car's speed is limited by the power required to drive it against air resistance, which increases with speed. At the maximum possible speed, the engine is running at its point of maximum power, or power peak, and the car is traveling at the speed where air resistance equals that maximum power. There is therefore one specific gear ratio at which the car can achieve its maximum speed: the one that matches that engine speed with that travel speed. At travel speeds below this maximum, there is a range of gear ratios that can match engine power to air resistance, and the most fuel efficient is the one that results in the lowest engine speed. Therefore, a car needs one gearing to reach maximum speed but another to reach maximum fuel efficiency at a lower speed. With the early development of cars and the almost universal rear-wheel drive layout, the final drive (i.e. rear axle) ratio for fast cars was chosen to give the ratio for maximum speed. The gearbox was designed so that, for efficiency, the fastest ratio would be a \\"direct-drive\\" or \\"straight-through\\" 1:1 ratio, avoiding frictional losses in the gears. Achieving an overdriven ratio for cruising thus required a gearbox ratio even higher than this, i.e. the gearbox output shaft rotating faster than the engine. The propeller shaft linking gearbox and rear axle is thus overdriven, and a transmission capable of doing this became termed an \\"overdrive\\" transmission. The device for achieving an overdrive transmission was usually a small separate gearbox, attached to the rear of the main gearbox and controlled by its own shift lever. These were often optional on some models of the same car. As popular cars became faster relative to legal limits and fuel costs became more important, particularly after the 1973 oil crisis, the use of five-speed gearboxes became more common in mass-market cars. These had a direct (1:1) fourth gear with an overdrive fifth gear, replacing the need for the separate overdrive gearbox. With the popularity of front wheel drive cars, the separate gearbox and final drive have merged into a single transaxle. There is no longer a propeller shaft and so one meaning of \\"overdrive\\" can no longer be applied. However the fundamental meaning, that of an overall ratio higher than the ratio for maximum speed, still applies. Although the deliberate labelling of an overdrive is now rare, the underlying feature is now found across all cars. Description Background The power needed to propel a car at any given set of conditions and speed is straightforward to calculate, based primarily on the total weight and the vehicle's speed. These produce two primary forces slowing the car: rolling resistance and air drag. The former varies roughly with the speed of the vehicle, while the latter varies with the square of the speed. Calculating these from first principles is generally difficult due to a variety of real- world factors, so this is often measured directly in wind tunnels and similar systems. The power produced by an engine increases with the engine's RPM to a maximum, then falls away. This is known as the point of maximum power. Given a curve describing the overall drag on the vehicle, it is simple to find the speed at which the total drag forces are the same as the maximum power of the engine. This defines the maximum speed the vehicle is able to reach. The rotational speed of the wheels for that given forward speed is simple to calculate, being the tire circumference multiplied by the RPM. As the tire RPM at maximum speed is not the same as the engine RPM at that power, a transmission is used with a gear ratio to convert one to the other. At even slightly lower speeds than maximum, the total drag on the vehicle is considerably less, and the engine needs to deliver this greatly reduced amount of power. In this case the RPM of the engine has changed significantly while the RPM of the wheels has changed very little. Clearly this condition calls for a different gear ratio. If one is not supplied, the engine is forced to run at a higher RPM than optimal. As the engine requires more power to overcome internal friction at higher RPM, this means more fuel is used simply to keep the engine running at this speed. Every cycle of the engine leads to wear, so keeping the engine at higher RPM is also unfavorable for engine life. Additionally, the sound of an engine is strongly related to the RPM, so running at lower RPM is generally quieter. If one runs the same RPM transmission exercise outlined above for maximum speed, but instead sets the \\"maximum speed\\" to that of highway cruising, the output is a higher gear ratio that provides ideal fuel mileage. In an era when cars were not able to travel very fast, the maximum power point might be near enough to the desired speed that additional gears were not needed. But as more powerful cars appeared, especially during the 1960s, this disparity between the maximum power point and desired speed grew considerably. This meant that cars were often operating far from their most efficient point. As the desire for better fuel economy grew, especially after the 1973 oil crisis, the need for a \\"cruising gear\\" became more pressing. Gearbox vs. final drive The obvious solution to this problem would be to add more gears to the transmission. Indeed, in modern vehicles this is common. However, due to historical particularities, this was not always practical. In the conventional rear-wheel drive layout, the transmission system normally contained two sections, the \\"gearbox\\" or \\"transmission\\" mounted behind the engine, and the \\"final drive\\" mounted in the rear axle at the rear of the car. The reason for this separation of duties between the front and back of the car was to allow the drive shaft to run at lower torque, by using higher RPM. As power is the product of RPM and torque, running the shaft at higher RPM allowed more power to be transferred at lower torque. Doing so reduced the torque the driveshaft had to carry, and thus the strength and weight it required. Although the designer was theoretically free to choose any ratio for the gearbox and final drive, there is one additional consideration which meant that the top gear of most gearboxes was 1:1 or \\"direct drive\\". This is chosen for efficiency, as it does not require any gears to transmit power and so reduces the power lost by them. This was particularly important in the early days of cars, as their straight-cut gears were poorly finished, noisy and inefficient. The final drive then took this output and adjusted it in a fixed-ratio transmission arrangement that was much simpler to build. Final drive ratios of 4:1 were common, meaning that the wheels would turn at one fourth the rate they would if directly connected to the engine. Overdrive In an era when different models of car with different wheel sizes could be accommodated by simply changing the final drive ratio, it made sense for all transmissions to use direct drive as the highest gear. As noted earlier, however, this would cause the engine to operate at too high an RPM for efficient cruising. Although adding the cruising gear to the main gearbox was possible, it was generally simpler to add a separate two-gear overdrive system to the existing gearbox. This not only meant that it could be tuned for different vehicles, but had the additional advantage that it could be offered as an easily installed option. With the use of front-wheel drive layouts, the gearbox and final drive are combined into a single transaxle. There is no longer a drive shaft between them and so the notion of \\"direct drive\\" isn't applicable. Although \\"overdrive\\" is still referred to, this is now mostly a marketing term to refer to any extra-high ratio for efficient cruising, whether it is achieved through the gearbox ratios, or by an unusually high final drive.  Usage  Generally speaking, overdrive is the highest gear in the transmission. Overdrive allows the engine to operate at a lower RPM for a given road speed. This allows the vehicle to achieve better fuel efficiency, and often quieter operation on the highway. When it is switched on, an automatic transmission can shift into overdrive mode after a certain speed is reached (usually 70+ km/h [40-45 mph or more] depending on the load). When it is off, the automatic transmission shifting is limited to the lower gears. Overdrive should usually be selected when the average speed is above 70 km/h (40-45 mph). Dashboard indicator for overdrive (automatic vehicle, manufactured 2000) The automatic transmission automatically shifts from OD to direct drive when more load is present. When less load is present, it shifts back to OD. Under certain conditions, for example driving uphill, or towing a trailer, the transmission may \\"hunt\\" between OD and the next highest gear, shifting back and forth. In this case, switching it off can help the transmission to \\"decide\\". It may also be advantageous to switch it off if engine braking is desired, for example when driving downhill. The vehicle's owner's manual will often contain information and suitable procedures regarding such situations, for each given vehicle. Virtually all vehicles (cars and trucks) have overdrive today whether manual transmission or automatic. In the automotive aftermarket you can also retrofit overdrive to existing early transmissions. Overdrive was widely used in European automobiles with manual transmission in the 60s and 70s to improve mileage and sport driving as a bolt-on option but it became increasingly more common for later transmissions to have this gear built in. If a vehicle is equipped with a bolt-on overdrive (e.g.: GKN or Gear Vendors) as opposed to having an overdrive built in one will typically have the option to use the overdrive in more gears than just the top gear. In this case gear changing is still possible in all gears, even with overdrive disconnected. Overdrive simply adds effective ranges to the gears, thus overdrive third and fourth become in effect \\"third-and-a-half\\" and a fifth gear. In practice this gives the driver more ratios which are closer together providing greater flexibility particularly in performance cars.  How an overdrive unit works  Overdrive button on the gear stick of an automatic vehicle manufactured in 2000. An overdrive consists of an electrically or hydraulically operated epicyclic gear train bolted behind the transmission unit. It can either couple the input driveshaft directly to the output shaft (or propeller shaft) (1:1), or increase the output speed so that it turns faster than the input shaft (1:1 + n). Thus the output shaft may be \\"overdriven\\" relative to the input shaft. In newer transmissions, the overdrive speed(s) are typically as a result of combinations of planetary/epicyclic gearsets which are integrated in the transmission. For example, the ZF 8HP transmission has 8 forward gears, two of which are overdrive (< 1:1) gear ratios. In older vehicles, it is sometimes actuated by a knob or button, often incorporated into the gearshift knob, and does not require operation of the clutch. Newer vehicles have electronic overdrive in which the computer automatically adjusts to the conditions of power need and load.  In Europe  The vast majority of overdrives in European cars were invented and developed by a man called de Normanville and manufactured by an English company called Laycock Engineering (later GKN Laycock), at its Little London Road site in Sheffield. The system was devised by Captain Edgar J de Normanville (1882‚Äì1968), and made by Laycock through a chance meeting with a Laycock Products Engineer. De Normanville overdrives were found in vehicles manufactured by Standard-Triumph, who were first, followed by Ford, BMC and British Leyland, Jaguar, Rootes Group and Volvo to name only a few. Another British company, the former aircraft builder Fairey, built a successful all-mechanical unit for the Land Rover, which is still in production in America today. The first production vehicle to feature the Laycock system was the 1948 Standard Vanguard Saloon. The first unit to be created was the A-type overdrive, which was fitted to many sports cars during the 1950s, and into the late 1960s. Several famous marques used A-type overdrives, including Jaguar, Aston Martin, Ferrari, Austin-Healey, Jensen, Bristol, AC, Armstrong Siddeley and Triumph's TR sports car range, from the TR2 through to the end of the 1972 model year of the TR6. In 1959, the Laycock Engineering Company introduced the D-type overdrive, which was fitted to a variety of motor cars including Volvo 120 and 1800s, Sunbeam Alpines and Rapiers, Triumph Spitfires, and also 1962‚Äì1967 MGBs (those with 3-synchro transmissions). From 1967 the LH-type overdrive was introduced, and this featured in a variety of models, including 1968‚Äì1980 MGBs, the MGC, the Ford Zephyr, early Reliant Scimitars, TVRs, and Gilberns. The J-type overdrive was introduced in the late 1960s, and was adapted to fit Volvo, Triumph, Vauxhall/Opel, American Motors and Chrysler motorcars, and Ford Transit vans. The P-type overdrive marked the last updates and included both a Gear Vendors U.S. version and a Volvo version. The Volvo version kept the same package size as the J-type but with the updated 18 element freewheel and stronger splines through the planet carrier. The Gear Vendors U.S. version uses a larger 1.375 outer diameter output shaft for higher capacity and a longer rear case. Over a period of 40 years, Laycock Engineering manufactured over three and a half million overdrive Units, and over one million of these were fitted to Volvo motorcars. In 2008 the U.S. company Gear Vendors, Inc. of El Cajon, California purchased all the overdrive assets of GKN to continue production of the U.S. version and all spares for J and P types worldwide. The system features an oil pressure operated device attached to the back of the standard gearbox operating on the gearbox output shaft. Through a system of oil pressure, solenoids and pistons, the overdrive would drop the revs on whatever gears it was used on by 22% (.778). For instance, the overdrive system applied to a Triumph TR5 operates on 2nd, 3rd and top gear. When engaged, the overdrive would drop the revs from 3000 by 666 RPM, or from 3500 the drop would be 777 RPM to 2723 net. The advantages this reduced rpm had on fuel consumption was most often quite near 22% decrease during highway driving.  In North America  In the days before automatic transmissions were common, especially in the 1950s, many rear-wheel drive American cars were available with an overdrive option. With substantial improvements developed in Muncie, Indiana, by William B. Barnes for production by its Warner Gear Division, BorgWarner provided the box that was factory-installed between the transmission and a foreshortened driveshaft. Since the overdrive function, if enabled, could be shifted by simply easing up on the accelerator without depressing the clutch pedal, the action was much like a semi-automatic. Also, an electrically operated solenoid would deactivate the unit via a switch under the accelerator pedal providing the equivalent of the kickdown of the automatic. A knob connected to a bowden cable, similar to some emergency brake applications, was also provided to lock out the unit mechanically. Using overdrive with the main 3-speed transmission in 2nd gear was similar in ratio to 3rd gear, and with the main transmission in 3rd, the overall ratio was fractional (i.e., \\"true overdrive\\"). This was important in reducing wear, tear, noise, and difficulty in control. Such add- on overdrive boxes were available from the 1930s to the 1970s for cars and light trucks. Today, most petrol and diesel cars and trucks come with an overdrive transmission because of the benefit to fuel economy. Overdrive is included in both automatic and manual transmissions as an extra gear (or two in some cases).  Fuel economy and drivetrain wear  When using overdrive gearing, the car's engine speed drops, reducing wear and normally saving fuel. Since 1981 U.S. corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) legislation, virtually all domestic vehicles have included overdrive to save fuel. One should refer to the car's owner's manual for the proper speed to run at overdrive. All engines have a range of peak efficiency and it is possible for the use of overdrive to keep the engine out of this range for all or part of the time of its use if used at inappropriate speeds, thus cutting into any fuel savings from the lower engine speed. Overall drivetrain reduction comes down to three basic factors: transmission gearing (including overdrive), differential gearing (in the axle), and tire size. The rotation speed problem comes into effect when the differential gearing is a high ratio and an overdrive is used to compensate. This may create unpleasant vibrations at high speeds and possible destruction of the driveshaft due to the centripetal forces or uneven balance. The driveshaft is usually a hollow metal tube that requires balancing to reduce vibration and contains no internal bracing. The higher speeds on the driveshaft and related parts can cause heat and wear problems if an overdrive and high differential gearing (or even very small tires) are combined, and create unnecessary friction. This is especially important because the differential gears are bathed in heavy oil and seldom provided with any cooling besides air blowing over the housing. The impetus is to minimize overdrive use and provide a higher ratio first gear, which means more gears between the first and the last to keep the engine at its most efficient speed. This is part of the reason that modern automobiles tend to have larger numbers of gears in their transmissions. It is also why more than one overdrive gear is seldom seen in a vehicle except in special circumstances i.e. where high (numerical) differential gear is required to get the vehicle moving as in trucks or performance cars though double overdrive transmissions are common in other vehicles, often with a small number on the axle gear reduction, but usually only engage at speeds exceeding .

It was formed out of the merger of two aviation companies, Fiat Aviazione and Aerfer, during 1969. Aeritalia continued several programs of its preceding companies, perhaps most prominently the Fiat G.222 transport aircraft. Furthermore, the company was involved in various multinational programs and initiatives, including the European multirole aircraft Panavia Tornado, the ATR family of regional airliners, and the fighter-bomber AMX International AMX. Aeritalia was also a partner in the Boeing 767 from its inception, and played a key role in the creation of the Italian space industry, being involved in the Alfa rocket. In 1990, Aeritalia and Selenia were merged together at the behest of parent corporation Finmeccanica to create Alenia Aeronautica, an aerospace and defense specialist. History Aeritalia was created during 1969 by the merger of Aerfer and Fiat Aviazione's aviation businesses. In response to a NATO-issued specification for a V/STOL transport aircraft (NATO Basic Military Requirement 4), Fiat's design team, led by Giuseppe Gabrielli, produced a design to meet this requirement, designated G.222.Air International April 1977, pp. 163‚Äì164. According to Aeritalia, the G.222 designation is derived from the first letter of the aircraft's chief designer; the first '2' referring to the twin-engine arrangement, and the final '22' referring to the revised NATO Basic Military Requirement 22 to which it had been submitted.\\"Alenia Aermacchi G.222: history and features.\\" Alenia Aermacchi, Retrieved: 28 March 2016. The Italian Air Force (AMI), who sought a replacement for the Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar, felt that the G.222 proposal had merit and placed an order for two prototypes and a ground-test airframe in 1968.\\"Tyne-powered G.222 variants planned.\\" Flight International, 24 October 1981. p. 1262. It was substantially redeveloped from the NATO submission, the V/STOL lift engines were omitted and a pair of General Electric T64 turboprop engines were adopted;Air International April 1977, pp. 164, 166. subsequently, the G.222 lacked a V/STOL capability but retained considerable short take-off/landing (STOL) performance.Evangelisti, Spinoni and Jones 1999, p. A11-2. Fiat G.222TCM development aircraft exhibited at the 1977 Paris Air Show. During December 1971, the Italian Air Force held a formal evaluation of the G.222 which led to a contract for 44 aircraft being issued to Aeritalia.Air International April 1977, pp. 167‚Äì168. In December 1975, the first production aircraft conducted its first flight. Following on from its introduction by the AMI, the G.222 was procured as a tactical transport aircraft by various international customers, including Argentina, Nigeria, Somalia, Venezuela and Thailand.Evangelisti, Spinoni and Jones 1999, p. A11-3. In December 1978, Aeritalia elected to transfer final assembly of the G.222 from Turin to Naples, at which point a total of 44 firm orders had been obtained for the type and one aircraft per month was being manufactured.\\"G.222.\\" Flight International, p. 2108. Manufacturing of the G.222 was broken down into various companies; construction of the fuselage was performed at Naples, the center-section of the wing was produced by Piaggio, the wing panels were made by Macchi, the tail surfaces were built by SIAI- Marchetti, the engine nacelles by IAM, and the T64 engines were license- manufactured by Alfa Romeo and Fiat.\\"G.222.\\" Flight International, 9 December 1978. p. 2113. During early 1977, the Italian Air Force issued a requirement for 187 new-build strike fighters, which were to replace its existing Aeritalia G.91 in the close air support and reconnaissance missions, as well as the Lockheed RF-104G Starfighter also being used in the reconnaissance role.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 289.Warwick 1981, p. 1544. Rather than competing for the contract, Aeritalia and Italian aerospace company Aermacchi agreed to produce a joint proposal for the requirement, as both firms had been considering the development of a similar class of aircraft for some years. In April 1978, work on the joint venture formally commenced.Braybrook 1989, p. 267. During 1980, the Brazilian government announced that they intended to participate in the program to replace the Aermacchi MB-326. In July 1981, the Italian and Brazilian governments agreed on joint requirements, and Embraer was invited to join the industrial partnership. An agreement was also struck to divide AMX manufacturing between the partners; for each production aircraft, Aeritalia manufactured 46.5 per cent of the components (central fuselage, stabilisers and rudders), Aermacchi produced 22.8 per cent (front fuselage and tail cone), and Embraer performed 29.7 per cent of the work (wing, air intakes, pylons and drop tanks). During the 1960s and 1970s, European aircraft manufacturers had, for the most part, undergone considerable corporate restructuring, including mergers and consolidations, as well as moved towards collaborative multi-national programmes, such as the newly launched Airbus A300. In line with this trend towards intra-European cooperation, French aerospace company A√©rospatiale and Aeritalia commenced discussions on the topic of working together to develop an all-new regional airliner. Prior to this, both companies had been independently conducting studies for their own aircraft concepts, the AS 35 design in the case of Aerospatiale and the AIT 230 for Aeritalia, to conform with demand within this sector of the market as early as 1978. On 4 November 1981, a formal Cooperation Agreement was signed by Aeritalia chairman Renato Bonifacio and Aerospatiale chairman Jacques Mitterrand in Paris, France. This agreement signaled not only the merger of their efforts but of their separate concept designs together into a single complete aircraft design for the purpose of pursuing its development and manufacture as a collaborative joint venture. The consortium then targeted a similar unit cost but a fuel consumption over a sector, nearly half the required by its 40-50 seat competitors, the British Aerospace HS.748 and Fokker F.27, and planned a 58-seat ATR XX stretch. This agreement served not only as the basis and origins of the ATR company, but also as the effective launch point of what would become the fledgling firm's first aircraft, which was designated as the ATR 42. By 1983, ATR's customer services division has been set up, readying infrastructure worldwide to provide support for ATR's upcoming aircraft to any customer regardless of location.\\"Company milestones.\\" ATR, Retrieved: 29 July 2017. During 1990, Aeritalia was reorganised by its corporate parent, Finmeccanica; it merged with Selenia to form Alenia Aeronautica, which functioned as Finmeccanica's aerospace division.

During 2002, Alenia Aeronautica was incorporated when Finmeccanica restructured itself, spinning off its various divisions as independent companies. Finmeccanica has since reorganised itself into a more closely integrated business, adopting the Leonardo name for the group. Immediately upon its creation, Alenia was associated with several ongoing aircraft programmes, including the multinational Eurofighter Typhoon fighter programme, the Panavia Tornado fighter-bomber, along with various other initiatives and partnerships. Its work on the Tornado was largely conducted via Panavia Aircraft GmbH, a tri- national consortium consisting of British Aerospace (previously British Aircraft Corporation), MBB of West Germany, and its Aeritalia subsidiary. Under this arrangement, Aeritalia manufactured the Tornado's wings on behalf of all international customers while the other partners manufactured the rest of the airframe.Segell 1997, p. 125.

Examples of such devices include the Death Star from the Star Wars film franchise, the \\"Doomsday Machine\\" seen in the original Star Trek television series, or the atomic-powered stone burners from Frank Herbert's Dune franchise. Overview Planet killers function in a variety of ways depending on the series. Weapons such as the Death Star and the titular ship in Lexx use a directed energy weapon capable of obliterating a planet in moments. In the game Spore, the Planet Buster is an antimatter bomb that is inserted in the center of the planet, causing the planet's core to split into countless fragments. Other weapons, such as the Shadow Planet Killer in Babylon 5 and Covenant warships in the Halo series, render a planet uninhabitable. The Shadow Planet Killer does so by firing missiles which burrow into the planet's core and detonate, causing planet-wide volcanic activity which renders the planet lifeless. Covenant warships use plasma weapons to superheat the surface of the planet; the crust is turned into a glass-like substance rendering it uninhabitable. In Star Blazers, missiles that can destroy a planet (and even a star) with a single hit exist. Some devices can destroy entire star systems. Nova bombs in Andromeda, the Sun Crusher and Centerpoint Station in the Star Wars novels, and Dr. Tolian Soran's trilithium torpedo in Star Trek Generations, are all capable of causing a supernova, obliterating every planet in the solar system. Planet killers in fiction Film and television Andromeda * All Commonwealth warships were equipped with a limited stock of \\"Nova-bomb\\" warheads for their missiles, one of which is sufficient to cause a star to nova, thus destroying its planets. Babylon 5 * Babylon 5: The Lost Tales ‚Äì Centauri Superweapons, hinted at by a dream sequence set 30 years in the future that Sheridan experiences. While only NYC is destroyed in the scene, it is implied that all of Earth gets wiped out. * Shadow Planet Killer * Vorlon Planet Killer Beneath the Planet of the Apes *Alpha Omega Bomb - an ICBM worshiped by the underground dwellers. The missile contains a thermonuclear bomb with a cobalt casing. When launched it would result in an explosion hot enough to ignite the atmosphere, thus destroying the surface of the earth. Lexx * The Lexx ‚Äì Capable of entirely destroying planets. * The Foreshadow ‚Äì predecessor of the Megashadow. Reduces the surface of Brunnis-2 into molten slag, using a large scale version of the \\"Black Pack\\" weapon often seen in the LEXX series. * The Megashadow ‚Äì Annihilates an Ostral-B asteroid base and the surrounding field in a single shot. * Mantrid Drones ‚Äì They consume all forms of matter (including planets) to replicate themselves. DC Comics * In Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, the Quantum Eigenstate Device (QED) is a planet-killing or possibly universe- killing weapon. * Most cosmic beings and even some heroes or villains have the power to destroy a planet. *Superman has demonstrated the strength to move or destroy multiple planets and once infamously destroyed a solar system with a sneeze, his heat vision also has vaporized entire planets. While Superman's depictions vary from author to author, these feats have appeared in every era of the character; Golden, Silver, Bronze and Modern Age of comics. * In Green Lantern: The Animated Series, the Red Lantern Corps have a large number of cylindrical devices called 'Liberators' that can disintegrate a planet. Stargate SG-1/Stargate Atlantis * A tainted Zero Point Module can explode with enough energy to destroy an entire solar system.Zero Hour\\" * Project Arcturus, an abandoned Ancient project capable of extracting energy from our own universe, unlike a normal Zero Point Module which draws energy from subspace, would create exotic particles with unpredictable properties, and would overload to actually destroy approximately 5/6 of a solar system. * The Stargates themselves are composed of Naqahdah, and, if caused to detonate, would cause considerable damage. Anubis's Ancient weapon that charges a Stargate powerfully enough that it explodes. However, its yield is stated to be 2 gigatons of TNT, not enough to kill a planet. A wormhole passing through a star is capable of introducing super-heavy elements into it, thus destabilizing fusion processes and changing, possibly catastrophically, the climates of planets orbiting it. P3W-451 has fallen into a black hole; an inbound wormhole to its stargate propagates the gravitational influence back to the dialing gate. Initially this caused time distortion effects near the gate, but as P3W-451 got closer to the black hole objects were pulled into the gate, as of Exodus a gate dialing from a star would exert such a pull that it could not only remove matter from the star, but do so fast enough to cause it to go supernova. The effect of dialing from a planet at this point was not described. * The Dakara Superweapon in the Temple of Dakara can return all matter in its range to its component molecules. Its range is normally limited to Dakara and its surrounding space, however the wave will propagate through the wormhole of an active Stargate (unimpeded by either iris or Goa'uld shield technology) and expand on the far side to cover the planet's surface, but unlike Dakara itself, the wave will not propagate into orbit. Ba'al however modified the Dakara Stargate, using a 'hack' of the DHD's correlative update function to dial every Stargate in the Galaxy simultaneously, turning the weapon from a strategic threat to a Galactic scale superweapon against all planets within the Milky way Stargate network. * A Tauri Mark 9 Naqahdah- enhanced nuclear weapon has a \\"Multi Gigaton\\" yield. * Anubis's mothership, powered with the Eye of Ra as well as four other \\"eyes\\", in \\"Full Circle\\" * The Asgard managed to destroy Halla by causing Halla's sun to become a black hole. * The Asgard destroyed their home planet, to commit mass suicide, by unknown means. * The Ori Priors can turn planets into Point Singularities (Black Holes) to power their supergates, and did so twice. * The Tok'ra have been shown to possess Thermonuclear Induction explosives capable of burrowing to a planet's core and igniting a reaction to which the planet would explode; as shown when they used it to destroy Netu. \\"The Devil You Know\\" * Gadmeer terraforming ship ‚Äì see Genesis device below. Star Trek General Order 24 (see below) indicates that all Federation starships of cruiser size or above were capable of being planet killers. =The Original Series= * The Doomsday Machine * General Order 24. Starfleet order for a starship to destroy all life on an entire planet * Nomad. A small spacecraft resulting from the combination of two unrelated craft that was able to \\"sterilize\\" entire planetary populations * \\"The Amoeba\\" a giant space-dwelling single-cell life form capable of annihilating an entire solar system =The Animated Series= * A space-dwelling life form that consumes planets for food =Star Trek: The Next Generation= * Tox Uthat (A weapon from the future that would stop all fusion reactions in a sun) * Dr. Timicin's torpedo intended to rejuvenate a dying sun but causing it to go nova instead =Star Trek: Deep Space Nine= * A bomb consisting of trilithium, tekasite and protomatter intended to be detonated in the Bajoran sun by a Changeling =Star Trek: Voyager= * Species 8472 bio-ships =Star Trek: Enterprise= * The Xindi superweapon was a mobile directed energy weapon that could reduce a planet to molten rubble. =Star Trek (movies)= * V'Ger, a highly advanced and powerful living machine evolved from the Earth space probe Voyager VI, was capable of destroying the entire surface of a planet with plasma-based torpedo-like devices. It was also capable of using these devices to reduce ships and space stations into digital patterns, destroying the originals in the process. * Genesis Device (a terraforming experimental device; not intended as a weapon, but when it was used on an existing biosphere it destroyed it in the process of creating a new one. The process left the planet unstable and eventually exploded) * Trilithium torpedo. Used by Dr. Tolian Soran in Star Trek Generations to stop all the fusion reactions in a star, causing it to go nova, much like the Tox Uthat. * Red Matter. A material capable of creating black holes. It could be used as a planet-killer by being injected into a planet's core, creating a black hole that imploded the planet by consuming it from the core outward. Red Matter is also potentially strong enough to consume a star. An example of a ship that used this is Spock's ship, the Jellyfish. The Romulan mining ship Narada also used the supply on Spock's ship when they captured it. (Star Trek (2009)). =Star Trek novels= * Planetcracker weapons and sunkiller bombs (Diane Duane's novels) Star Wars * Imperial Star Destroyer: All Imperial Star Destroyers, later re-envisioned as Imperial-class Star Destroyers, were capable of glassing a planet's surface (melting the planet's surface so that later it was frozen as a glass-like rock) although this method took months and sometimes years. this command was known as Base-Delta-Zero. * Centerpoint station (Star Wars expanded universe): An ancient space station, capable of moving planets with its tractor beams. * Galaxy Gun (EU): A gigantic space cannon, firing warheads in hyperspace that reverted to normal speed near the target. The special chemicals in the warhead reacted in the planets core, de- stabilizing the planet. * Mass Shadow Generator (EU): Used the gravity of a planet to create a Quantum singularity, de-stabilizing the planet. * Eclipse- class Star Dreadnought (EU): A Super Star Destroyer armed with a less-powerful version of the Death Star superlaser. * Naga Sadow: The Sith Lord Naga Sadow was capable of using ancient Sith sorcery to manipulate solar flares. His immense power with this ability was used to turn the Denarii Nova into a supernova, effectively destroying the entire system. * Sovereign-class Star Destroyer (EU): A less-powerful version of the Eclipse. * Sun Crusher (EU): A starfigher-sized ship, armed with a torpedo capable of making a star go supernova. * World Devastator (EU): Ships which consumed the material of a planet, using the material to create new war machines. (utilizes tractor beams) * Death Star: A moon-sized battle weapon, armed with a superlaser capable of destroying an entire planet. * Darth Nihilus (EU): Fed off entire planets, destroying all life on them. * The Old Republic/Imperial order Base Delta Zero, also known as BDZ (EU): Consisted of a sustained orbital bombardment of all biological and technological assets of a planet, the end result is the total \\"glassing\\" of a planets surface. * Starkiller Base: A First Order planet-converted superweapon capable of destroying an entire star system. * Yo'gand's Core (EU): A Yuuzhan Vong tactic to destroy a planet, using a 'dovin basal' (an organism capable of manipulating a planet's gravity) deployed in the planet's surface to disrupt a moon's orbit, causing it to crash into the planet. * Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought: A First Order dreadnought, inspired by the Imperial dreadnoughts, the Eclipse, Executor and Sovereign Star Dreadnoughts. It possessed the firepower of a dozen Resurgent Star Destroyers, and had two orbital autocannons used for planetary assault. The project by Kuat-Entralla Engineering was used as a test project to inform the Xyston-class Star Destroyers, revealed to be constructed by the Sith Eternal in secret on Exegol. *Sith Star Destroyer: A model of Star Destroyer used by the Sith Eternal, that in place of the hangar, possesses an axial superlaser, capable of destroying entire planets. It is revealed in The Rise of Skywalker. Emperor Palpatine reveals an armada of hundreds of Xyston-class Star Destroyers, the Final Order, intending to stage attacks on all free worlds. Doctor Who * In The Dominators the villains of the title try to destroy the peaceful planet Dulkis, as a fuel source for their fleet, by sending a seed device into the planet's core. * The Pirate Planet materializes around other planets, destroying them. * Additionally, the Daleks and Time Lords have both been shown to be capable of moving planets, and would thus be capable of relocating a planet into a star, nova, black hole, or other inhospitable location that would destroy it. Image of the Fendahl reveals the Time Lords trapped the world of the Fendahl, 5th planet of the Solar System, in a time loop. In The Trial of a Time Lord it is revealed the Time Lords devastated Earth with a fireball and moved it two light years around 2,000,000 AD. Daleks have also been stated to have been responsible for the destruction of The Doctor's home planet of Gallifrey, planet of the Time Lords, though at other points in the series the impression is given that the world has, rather, been removed from reality. It is later claimed the Doctor destroyed his world to end the Time War using 'The Moment', thinking it would destroy the Daleks. The Daleks have shown themselves to be capable of destroying planets; in \\"Asylum of the Daleks\\" they destroy the Dalek Asylum with an attack from space. in The Daleks' Master Plan the First Doctor uses their weapon, the Time Destructor, against them, turning the jungle planet of Kembel into a desert. In \\"Journey's End\\" Davros and the Daleks attempt to destroy all Universes with the Reality Bomb, which breaks down matter and is transmitted using stolen planets that include Earth. * In \\"The End of the World\\", technology is shown holding the Earth together and preventing the sun from exploding, and thus the Earth is destroyed simply by deactivating this technology. * The TARDIS has also been found to have the power to destroy the Earth, as shown in the Doctor Who film when the Eye of Harmony inside the TARDIS is left open too long. * In \\"The Big Bang\\" the TARDIS nearly destroys the Universe when it explodes by unexplained means in \\"The Pandorica Opens\\" * The Hand of Omega can be used to destroy planets by manipulating stars, as demonstrated on the Dalek homeworld Skaro. * The Osterhagen Key detonates 25 nuclear weapons in strategic points under the Earth's crust, causing it to rip apart. Only be used if \\"Humanity were suffering unbearably, with no hope or help ever coming..\\" in \\"The Stolen Earth\\" and \\"Journey's End\\". * The Tenth Planet, set in 1986, features the Z-Bomb, a weapon that could destroy the Earth, at a South Pole base. There are apparently others at strategic positions around the world. The General commanding the base tries to use it to destroy the planet Mondas, while its inhabitants the Cybermen try to use it to destroy Earth as Mondas is absorbing too much energy from Earth, which eventually destroys it. * In \\"Remembrance of the Daleks\\" The Doctor explains that the Dalek mothership \\"Has weapons that could crack this planet like an egg.\\" Other film and television * In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy franchise, the Vogon Constructor Fleet \\"demolishes\\" Earth as a contractor would demolish buildings to make way for a new construct. * In John Carpenter's sci-fi film Dark Star, intelligent and philosophically capable \\"Exponential Thermostellar Bombs\\" are used to destroy \\"unstable planets\\" which might threaten future colonization. * In the Mel Brooks feature film spoof Spaceballs, the Spaceballs' starship, Spaceball One, is capable of transforming into \\"Mega Maid\\", a robot maid in the shape of The Statue of Liberty holding a giant vacuum cleaner, which can suck the air from an entire planet and thus make it uninhabitable. * In the film The Chronicles of Riddick, the Necromongers cull potential recruits from planets and kill all those who remain on the surface by executing their \\"Final Protocol\\", a series of gravity-based weapons that flatten everything on the surface of the planet, save for the series of monuments that produce them. * Hugo Drax's space station in Moonraker, which launches globes filled with poisonous gas that would have wiped out mankind. * \\"Q Bomb\\" from Starship Troopers 3: Marauder * Unicron, a robotic, predatory planet from the animated feature film, The Transformers: The Movie. Unicron is a rarity among the Planet Killers on this list in that he is one of the few which is sentient and can act and think for himself. * \\"Blue Harvest\\", a Family Guy episode spoofing the original Star Wars movie, contains a version of the Death Star which is armed with a \\"planet blower-upper gun.\\" * In the Futurama episode \\"I Dated a Robot,\\" Fry blows up a planet with a planet blowing-up machine. Also in Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs, a weapon is used in a duel between Bender and another robot Calculon called a \\"Planetary Annihilator\\". Throughout there is also numerous references to Professor Farnsworth's doomsday devices which are hinted at being powerful enough to destroy planets or more. * In the British sci-fi series The Tomorrow People, an alien race known as the Thargons have a weapon known as a \\"Ripper Ray\\" which is allegedly capable of destroying a planet. * In the Kurt Russell film Soldier, one portable explosive device nicknamed a Planet Killer is used, devastating the planet. * In the Roger Corman film Battle Beyond the Stars, the evil Sador's mothership has a planet killing superweapon called the Stellar Converter, which seems to have the effect of superheating the core of the planet causing a delayed explosion where it incinerates from the inside/out. * In the TV series Earth: Final Conflict, the Jaridians have a planet killer and have destroyed thousands of Taelon-occupied planets including their homeworld. The video archive of all the planets destroyed one after another is seen by William Boone but at the time he doesn't understand what it is until the circumstances are explained to him later by Da'an. * In the science fiction feature film The Core, Project DESTINI was designed as a tactical weapon, but had the unforeseen effect of ceasing the rotation of the Earth's magnetic core, causing catastrophe, and threatening to end all life on Earth, unless the rotation could be restarted. * In the science fiction feature film Men in Black II, Serlena's ship is seen making vengeful blasts on searched planets, causing an icy one to shatter and another to implode. * The Displacement Engine in the TV series Farscape is a device which employs a wormhole to draw a large mass of fusing plasma from the core of a star, and then deploys it against a target. The device is described as being able to destroy a solar system. A major plot of the series is that the knowledge of wormholes contained in the head of John Crichton can be used to create a planet-killing weapon; in Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars Crichton finally builds and activates such a weapon to show that it is much worse; it is in fact a galaxy-killer. Under threat of everyone being consumed by the weapon, he convinces the Peacekeepers and Scarrans to pursue peace negotiations in return for him turning it off. * In the German TV series Raumpatrouille, a weapon called Overkill was used to destroy an object the size of a planetoid. The explosion seems to be strong enough to destroy a planet as well. * Blue-colored bomb with small red spheres floating around inside. Consisting of a 3-dimensional matter shell and a 9th-dimensional matter inside. Featured in Supernova (2000). * The Soviet Union's Doomsday Machine in the Stanley Kubrick film Dr. Strangelove. * The Drej Mothership in the animated feature film Titan A.E., destroyed the planet Earth. * The Megas XLR episode 'Breakout' features a gigantic alien known as \\"Grrkek the Planet Killer\\". * In the episode 'Doomsday is Tomorrow' of the series, The Bionic Woman, Jaime Sommers attempts to stop a doomsday device set up by a scientist who wants an end to nuclear weapons testing; while she and a Soviet agent race to get the job done, a Middle Eastern leader, skeptical of the claim of such a device, proceeds with his nation's first nuclear weapon test as an atmospheric explosion. * In Ben 10: Alien Force, the Incursean race has a super weapon called the \\"Incursean Conquest Ray\\", which Emperor Milleous uses to destroy Pluto and threaten to use against Earth should Princess Attea not be returned. When Princess Attea overthrows her father, however, she plans to use it to destroy Earth, though Ben and his team are ultimately able to stop her. * in Ben 10: Omniverse, the Contumelia used a device known as the Annihilargh to eliminate their enemies. Legends said that activating the Annihilargh will cause an entire universe to be wiped out. * In the French animated TV series Once Upon a Time... Space, the androids of the planet Yama use ships that connect themselves to form a much larger one, that fires a laser with enough firepower to destroy a planet. * In Spaced Invaders the D.O.D. (Doughnut Of Destruction) is a ring-shaped device which the aliens claim would destroy Earth but leave them unharmed as they would be in the center of the blast. Upon activation the device fails to detonate, but instead falls apart having been improperly assembled. * The Illudium PU-36 Explosive Space Modulator In the classic Bugs Bunny short Haredevil Hare in 1948. Marvin the Martian wanted to use it to blow up Earth because, as he said, \\"It obstructs my view of Venus\\". The explosive was in the form of a small red stick that resembled Dynamite that was screwed into a large telescope-like machine. * The 'Sun Harvester' in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. This is hidden inside one of the pyramids in Egypt and uses the Matrix to power up, destroying the sun to turn it into energon. * In the Tokusatsu Kaiju Film Ghidorah, The Three- Headed Monster, King Ghidorah attacked Venus (Mars on the English dub), leaving the planet uninhabitable. A variant version of King Ghidorah from the Rebirth of Mothra film trilogy sees the creature wiping out all dinosaurs on Earth, effectively acting as a Planet Killer in this respect, though life returns to the planet, and is eventually dominated by humanity. In the Monsterverse film Godzilla: King of the Monsters, the creature is capable of creating massive superstorms which, had the creature not been killed by Godzilla, would have rendered Earth effectively uninhabitable by anyone save itself, as it's stated the creature intended to reshape to the planet to suit its own needs. King Ghidorah. like Unicron (listed above), stands out from others on this list for being a living creature, something few other planet killers on this list have in common with it. * In the British Sci-Fi series Space: 1999 Season Two opening episode- THE METAMORPH, Commander Koening orders General Order Four, which Tony Verdeschi reveals is \\"a coded signal to destroy the place it originated from\\". And subsequently launches an Eagle, what the villain of the episode Mentor reveals as \\" A Robot Device, designed to destroy Psychon\\" One can assume that the Eagle was heavily equipped with Nuclear Charges, sufficient enough to at least destroy life on the planet * In Green Lantern: The Animated Series, the Red Lantern Corps ship, dubbed Shard, carried giant monolith-shaped devices called \\"Planet Killers\\" that were bombs capable of destroying entire planets. * The Dark Heart from Justice League Unlimited. A WMD from an unknown civilization, this robotic entity is sent to an enemy world, where it will consume any materials around it, until it consumes the entire planet. This war machine was never deactivated, so it continued to consume planets until it was stopped on Earth by the Justice League. * In The Day the Earth Stood Still, the robot Gort is capable of destroying the Earth, according to Klaatuu * Plan 9 from Outer Space mentions the Solaronite, a weapon so devastating that if detonated it could \\"explode the atoms of sunlight\\" and destroy the universe. It is implied that humanity will inevitably discover how to make the Solaronite unless prevented by aliens. * \\"The Ball\\", an episode of the Disney animated series Wander Over Yonder, introduces The Worldbuster, abbreviated as Buster - a playful, space- dwelling puppy who is bigger than a planet and does not realize that the balls he likes to play with are inhabited worlds. The only solution for the inhabitants of these worlds is to colonize the surface of Buster himself, which turns out to be congenial for life. * In The Tick, there was the Galactus parody Omnipotus. * In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Thanos acquires the Infinity Gauntlet, which has the power to eradicate half of all sentient life in the universe once he acquires all six Infinity Stones, adds them to the Gauntlet and snaps his fingers with it, as demonstrated in the 2018 film Avengers: Infinity War. * In the episode of The Simpsons, You Only Move Twice, Hank Scorpio threatens the United Nations with his doomsday device, testing it out on the 59th Street Bridge.  Literature  *The Deplorable Word, as used in The Magician's Nephew, by author C. S. Lewis, is a magical curse which ends all life in the fictional world of Charn except that of the one who speaks it. (see Omnicide) * Obliterators used by Honored Matres in Frank Herbert's Chapterhouse: Dune (1985) and later sequels by other authors are capable of combusting the entire atmosphere of a planet, and ultimately its full surface. * Stone burners, a type of nuclear weapon which could potentially destroy a planet by burning into and destroying a planet's core in the Dune universe. * Vogon Constructor Fleets in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Vogon civil services are not only able to demolish entire planets, but have means and cause to do so regularly (to create and maintain hyperspace by- passes). The Earth falls victim to one such fleet in the beginning of the story to make way for a hyperspace expressway. The radio, book, and the 1981 TV series versions of the story refer to demolition beams, though the mechanism is not shown distinctly in the 2005 film. There is also the ultimate weapon designed by Hactar (a giant space-borne computer). It is a very small bomb that when activated will join the heart of every major sun with the heart of every other major sun turning the universe into one gigantic hyperspatial supernova. The weapon was designed for a race of extinct aliens but was taken up again by the inhabitants of the planet Krikkit so as to wipe out all other life in the universe and permit them to be the only remaining inhabitants. Also, the Krikkit Battleclubs can destroy major suns with their hypernuclear grenades. Lastly, although not typically considered part of the main five-book trilogy, the short story Young Zaphod Plays It Safe mentions Zaphod passing by the doors of rooms filled with chemical and other agents that could sterilize, irradiate, explode, et cetera a planet; he then remarks that he is therefore glad he is not a planet. * The Inhibitor machines from Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space series of novels, were capable of consuming worlds over time to convert to copies of themselves, or to create weapons capable of utilizing stars to destroy planets e.g. venting stellar core material in a collimated beam to burn away planetary crusts. In the same series, the \\"Greenfly\\" machines, developed by humans as terraformers, instead go rogue and start eating planets by reducing them to their atoms and rebuilding them into more such machines, as well as numerous domes filled with vegetation. * The Spacer nuclear reaction intensifier in Isaac Asimov's Robots and Empire (1985) * Stephen Baxter's Moonseed: a virus-like microscopic object (or substance made from it) that transforms substances into more copies of itself ‚Äì and thus consumes Venus and then the Earth by doing so. (Baxter has also employed geomagnetic storms (see Sunstorm) and larger universal constructors (see Evolution) as planet killers.) * In Stephen Baxter's Xeelee Sequence, the Xeelee have a handgun-sized weapon capable of destroying stars and neutron stars. Also, during their final war with humanity from 700,000ad, the Xeelee built giant dyson shells around every single star in the Milky way, this forces the human inhabitants of the worlds to flee as the planets freeze. * The glass clock built in Terry Pratchett's Discworld novel Thief of Time was effectively a doomsday device, although its intended effect was to permanently freeze time on an entire world, rather than outright destroying it. * The Neutronium Alchemist (Peter F. Hamilton's The Night's Dawn Trilogy) * Quantumbusters in Peter F. Hamilton's Commonwealth Saga * At least six methods in E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith's Lensman saga: *# \\"super-atomic bombs\\" *# rendering a planet \\"loose\\" (inertialess) and directing it into a star *# a \\"nutcracker\\", maneuvering two loose planets to crush a third *# a \\"negasphere,\\" an antimatter planet *# \\"Nth space planets\\" from other dimensions which travel at superluminal speeds and can be used to ram planets or stars (creating supernovas) ‚Äì there was even the worrying possibility that these could cause the Big Crunch in zero time *# a \\"sunbeam\\", a way of concentrating most of a sun's energy output into a narrow beam‚Äîthis one a defensive-only weapon against nutcrackers and negaspheres  Of these, the Nth-space planet is considered the most lethal as its speed and inter-dimensional nature leaves no means to defend against it; this knowledge precipitates the final battle in Children of the Lens. * Device Ultimate in The Xenocide Mission * In Kevin J. Anderson's Saga of Seven Suns, the ongoing war between the Faeros and Hydrogues see entire suns having their cores frozen. * In Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game, the MD (Molecular Disruption) Device, or \\"Little Doctor\\", generates a field inside in which it is impossible for atoms to coexist in a molecule. The field propagates in a chain reaction, and essentially destroys all matter until it reaches pure space. This was intended for ship to ship combat, but was eventually used to destroy an entire planet. * In Daniel Edward's Division, planet-eaters focus gravity onto a planet, ripping it apart. This technology is used on Earth, destroying it utterly. Several other planet killers are mentioned * In E. E. Smith's The Skylark of Space series various planet-killers are used or discussed. Throwing planets and moons out of orbit, incredibly high-yield atomic or copper bombs, near-instantaneous dematerialization of physical objects and the teleporting of close to fifty billion stars in order to wipe out a Galaxy-wide alien civilization are all used. * In Greg Bear's The Forge of God, alien aggressors inject two high-mass weapons made of neutronium and antineutronium into the Earth which orbit the Earth's core until they meet and annihilate, destroying the planet. * L. Ron Hubbard's Battlefield Earth (1982) planet-buster tactical nuclear weapons, are teleported to a distant planet, where they are contained in protective force- field; that directs the blast into the mined-out and somewhat hollow planet. It first causes apocalyptic volcanic activity as half of the bombs' force breaks the crust and reaches the core, and the rest creates such temperature and pressure that it undergoes nuclear fusion and becomes a star. Battlefield Earth also features a device known as the \\"Psychlo ultimate bomb\\", which, when activated, causes all matter it touches to break down into hydrogen atoms (technically fission, although there is no mention of release or absorption of energy). The device featured at its core a sphere of extremely dense metal with an atomic number considerably larger than any listed on any periodic table of elements. This device was used on a moon, which was consumed faster than ships based on that moon could launch. The resulting cloud of hydrogen later compressed under its own gravity, analogous to a gas giant planet. It is implied that it developed electron degeneracy, as it was described as having an electric field of \\"uncountable quintillions of megavolts\\" and would vaporize anything that approached it with an electric arc. * In the Gor novel series by John Norman, specifically Tribesmen of Gor, the alien Kurii deploy a weapon, apparently housed in a small space craft, to the eponymous planet. If it had been put to use, it would have to have rendered the planet uninhabitable not only to humans, but also to the Priest-Kings, who were sheltered deep inside a mountain range. * Nova Bombs (Starship Troopers)(Andromeda TV Series) * Relativistic projectiles (Charles Pellegrino and George Zebrowski's The Killing Star) * The Electron Pump (Isaac Asimov's The Gods Themselves). Not precisely a weapon per se; the destruction it produces is a side effect (albeit one the creators are aware of and consider acceptable, since it will also produce a great deal of usable energy). * The Dahak-class Planetoid-of-the-Line (David Weber's Heirs of Empire trilogy) * Two of David Weber's books; The Armageddon Inheritance, and The Shiva Option, feature inhabited planets biospheres destroyed by the impact of asteroids or moons on deliberately modified intersecting orbits. * Throughout David Weber's Honorverse series just about any warship has the potential to wipe out all higher life on a planet by kinetic bombardment and this has happened in the past. * S.T.A.R Platforms (The Blank Horizon), originally used for faster than light communication by artificially generating a molecule-sized wormhole, are capable of focusing over 1000 km square of a stars surface output into a beam a little over 2 cm wide, reaching temperatures in excess of 4.2 billion degrees, which could theoretically cut a planet apart and combust its atmosphere. This is never put into practice however, as the platforms are self-destructed to prevent them from being captured and used against their creators. * In the Looking Glass series by John Ringo and Travis S. Taylor, the alien Dreen possess an explosive powerful enough to destroy planets, and the alien black box starship drive will generate a field capable of destroying entire star systems if exposed to high voltage electricity. * The Demolio is a bomb which can shatter planets in Brian Herbert's Timeweb Chronicles. * The Supernova (Matthew Reilly's Temple) - A weapon based on a fictional radioactive element. The weapon was described to be able to destroy a third of the mass of the planet. The element used as the core of the device is only found, rarely, in meteorites - only one active sample has ever been found and is being pursued by the American military and several terrorist organizations. * Ice-nine in the novel Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut is a solid form of water at ambient temperature. It causes the end of the Earth when some of it falls into the ocean, causing a chain reaction that transforms all the water on Earth into ice-nine. * Quark bombs in the novel Lord from the Planet Earth by Sergey Lukyanenko. A group of radical cultists from another planet wanted to destroy Earth with a quark bomb, but are foiled by the protagonists. * The Q-bomb, a prototype doomsday device that could destroy the world if triggered in The Mouse That Roared, a 1955 novel by Irish American writer Leonard Wibberley. *In Chris Walley's Lamb Among the Stars novels, a polyvalent fusion bomb is capable of rendering a planet inhospitable due to radiation if detonated in a solar system. Project Daybreak was intended to inject one into the core of a star, with an estimated blast radius of several dozen light- years. *In M. Andrew Sprong's book Haley Cork and the Blue Door two forms of planet killers are employed. In one case the Enemy uses an anti-mercury bomb to destroy half of the planet's population in order to blind the sensors of its guardian moon. In another, Haley, as a personified biomechanical weapon, teleports billions of copies of herself using quantum foam technology to the same exact location in order to convert herself into a blackhole and destroy the Enemy's planetary armada. *The Berserker series is a series of space opera science fiction short stories and novels by Fred Saberhagen, in which robotic self-replicating machines intend to destroy all life. These Berserkers, named after the human berserker warriors of Norse legend, are doomsday weapons left over from an interstellar war between two races of extraterrestrials. * In the German Science fiction Series Perry Rhodan, the humanoid Arkoniden (engl. Arconides) had the Arkon Bomb, which could destroy an Earth sized planet within hours or the Lemurians, the ancestors of the Arconides and the Terrans had the Armageddon Bomb which was similar to the Arkon Bomb. The tyrannical rulers of the Andromeda Galaxy had planet killers, which could devour whole planets and were referred to as \\"Mobies\\" by the fictional characters within the series. In this series, weapons with the power to eliminate whole galaxies were mentioned as well. *In A Hole in Space by Larry Niven, Monk ships carry a stern-facing device called the hachiroph shisp which causes stars to go supernova. The Monks use these devices to propel their ships from star to star, unless the star they are visiting has a civilization that can build a launching laser for them to use instead. *Hypernet gates in The Lost Fleet explode when disrupted, with a yield ranging from insignificant to supernova- level depending on the order in which the gate's many \\"tethers\\" are destroyed. The alien Enigmas provided the technology to humans during a large war, hoping that humanity would destroy itself when the warring factions (the Alliance and the Syndicate) discovered the gate-collapse technique and began using it on each other. *In The Shiva Option, the Bug \\"home hive\\" systems are neutralized by carpet bombing their inhabited planets with antimatter munitions. *In The Mortal Engines Quartet by author Philip Reeve, set in a post-apocalyptic world, the ODIN device is an ancient orbital energy weapon capable of destroying whole cities in a single blast. Stalker Fang, a main character in the series, plans to use ODIN to target volcanoes to plunge the Earth into a volcanic winter to extinguish humanity, which she sees as responsible for all of Earth's problems. The E.C.Tubb story 'Little Girl Lost' (also, a filmed adaptation was done for USA TV Series NIGHT GALLERY) presents a scenario where a researcher, working on atomic weapons (in the TV adaptation, he is working for the US, in the original, for the British government) suffers a nervous breakdown when his daughter is killed in a car accident. In order to keep him working at his project, a psychologist is brought in to keep him in a delusional state, thinking that she is still alive ... it seems that he is completely fooled by this ruse until the end, where it is discovered that his weapon can (and does) destroy the planet, or at least that is implied ... ‚ñ™ Stephan Ames Berry Kronarian book series has two versions of planet busters one produced by the old imperium burrows into a planets cores and explodes destroying the planet from the inside out. The other was produced by the Trel called a worm maker creates a wormhole to consume a planet or in some cases whole solar systems. this one was copied by the antagonist AI's and was used against them destroying their fleet. Games Halo series * UNSC NOVA Bomb (a group of nuclear warheads clustered around a core that forces the fissionable material together, magnifying the explosion) * Covenant Warships are typically equipped with plasma weapons used to vitrify (commonly called \\"glassing\\") the surface of a planet through en masse bombardment The titular Halo installations themselves only kill sentient life, leaving planets and their biospheres-as well as any creature without sufficient biomass to support The Flood-otherwise intact. However, Forerunner and ancient Human fleets are known to possess less selective weapons capable of inducing stellar collapses at will. StarCraft (series) * Protoss:  Most larger warcraft (carriers, motherships, and sometimes void rays have purification beams, which instantly vitrify (AKA glassing) the surface of a planet.  Cybros, the Purifier vault/battlestation is equipped with a beam that \\"purifies\\" a planet of all life via glassing with one shot, hence the name Purifiers. This weapon was fired upon Endion after Cybros was cleansed of Zerg infestation. *Terrans:  Bombardment with apocalypse class nukes, FTL-capable nukes meant to be launched en-masse. 1000 is extreme overkill for wiping out all life on a fortified planet, with explosions easily visible from orbit. This appears to leave little lingering radiation, as the planet Korhal which was victim to such an attack was cleansed of it and has a population in the billions within a few decades.  The Mercer-class doomsday device, which turns a planet's core against it, causing it to explode, covering the planet's surface in magma. Psi-emitter- a device that attracts innumerable Zerg to its location. One such device was deployed on Tarsonis, which resulted in massive casualties. *Zerg: Although not shown in-game, it is referenced in the lore that the Zerg can spread creep across the surface of a planet within days. They have massive reproduction and regeneration capabilities, so they can clear a planet and assimilate any genetic code that benefits the Swarm. *Void Entities: Amon is shown to be powerful enough to extinguish worlds with but a thought. Sins of a Solar Empire *The TEC's Novalith Cannon is a giant, nuke launching, railgun capable of wiping out the entire population of a planet in just one shot, with better fortified planets only requiring two. The intense radiation of the nukes also makes the planet uninhabitable for a long time. *In Sins of a Solar empire: Rebellion the loyalist faction of the alien Vasari can strip-mine an entire planet, leaving only a dead asteroid. This nets the player ordering the strip-mining a large amount of resources. *All titans, all capitals, and some specialized frigates can bomb a planet to destroy a colony and wipe out its population. the technology used varies between the different races, with the human TEC (or Trader Emergency Coalition) using nukes, the psychic Advent using Kinetic bombardment, and the alien Vasari using a beam weapon. Warhammer 40,000 * Abaddon the Despoiler's ship, Planet Killer destroys planets through a concentrated beam that bores through a planet's crust causing a catastrophic eruption of planetary material. * C'tan (the Necron's Gods). In their original \\"energy- like\\" form they can feed any source of energy (heat, radiation, life, etc.) * The Necron World Engine has large Gauss weapons that can scour a world of all life. * Tyranid Hive Fleets devour all biomass of a planet they conquer. * The Imperium's means of carrying out an order of Exterminatus, including:  Virus Bombs. These contain a mutating virus, called the Life Eater virus, which causes basic chemical bonds in organic and some non-organic materials to break, causing these materials to \\"liquefy\\". As the planetary biosphere undergoes accelerated decomposition the massive amount of methane gas can be ignited from orbit creating a planet wide firestorm that will often kill anyone who survived the virus attack.  Cyclonic Torpedoes. One was used by the Inquisition to destroy Typhon Primaris during Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II - Retribution.  Orbital Bombardment. The favored method of the Imperial Navy due to its lack of authorization to use the more advanced means. The result of an orbital bombardment can range from continents being atomized and oceans being vaporized to the complete mass scatter of the planet. * Two Blackstone Fortresses, a type of space station used by Chaos, can destroy a planet. If used together, Three Blackstone Fortresses or more can destroy a star. They were originally weapons wielded by the Eldar against the Necrons and the C'tan in a cataclysmic war but were lost and forgotten until millennia later. Initially used as Imperial Space Fortresses, the Chaos Warmaster Abaddon managed to secure two artifacts to control two Fortresses while destroying the rest. Other games * The System Killer as well as the Von Neumann Construct random menaces from the Sword of the Stars series. * The Annihilaser from Planetary Annihilation. It is used by building 5 massive Catalysts on the north pole of a metal planet, allowing the player to fire a weapon from the planet. After a short charging up sequence, the planet will rotate to its target and fire an extremely powerful beam of energy that goes straight though the planet, and the crust will turn bright blue and expand outward, before exploding. The Annihilaser can destroy any rocky planet (Regardless of size), and can even destroy small planets that are being fired at another planet. It cannot destroy gas giants or stars. * Ragnarok, Planetary Annihilation. A doomsday structure that once built deploys and drills a hole to the mantle of a planet for one minute before dropping an unnamed device into the core, exploding the planet in a fashion similar to the Annihilaser. * Planet Buster in E.A.'s 2008 space simulation game, Spore (Space stage), a superweapon feared by all, capable of destroying an entire planet with a single blast. Using it is against the Galactic Code and nearby empires will consider it to be an act of war, except the Grox, who become friendlier. When used 10 parsecs away from other empires, it will not alter the relationship with them and can be tested 'safely'. *Another planet-killer in Spore are the terraforming tools. While unable to completely shatter a planet, they can destroy the ecosystem and either freeze or melt the planet, while making the atmosphere too thin or thick for life to live. * Hammer of Dawn in the Gears of war Series could wipe out the entire civilization with a few shots. * Xenon Mothership (X: Beyond the Frontier) * Khaak Mothership (X¬≤: The Threat) * Heartless (Kingdom Hearts series), a race of creatures that devour, not only the hearts of people, but also of worlds, thus destroying them. * Mycon Deep children, the Utwig Bomb, and the Sa-Matra from Star Control 2 * The Omega System (Xenosaga) *Tiberium in the Command & Conquer franchise slowly eats the earth turning it into tiberium. * Atmospheric deprivation missiles in Homeworld are used by the Taiidan (or Kushan, depending on the player's choice of race), while (unknown to them) the Mothership was held up by raiders on the outskirts of the system. Afterwards, the northern hemisphere was blackened and fires were visible from high orbit. In Homeworld 2, the main antagonists (the Vaygr) attempt to use similar technology in the final mission ‚Äì one of the mission's objectives is to intercept the missiles before they reach their target. However, the planet is not 'killed' after one missile strike; each missile kills approximately half of the current surviving population, and the mission is failed if too many slip by (it takes approximately 5 to fully depopulate the planet). The T-MAT Motherships and the Progenitor ship, the Sajuuk, and the Ancient Planetary Bombardment Platforms are also considered as Planet Killers. * Black Sun (Supreme Commander), an extremely powerful laser weapon that utilizes a gate network to target and burn multiple planets in a single firing. Fired from the Black Sun facility located in Hawaii. * Mechanoid motherships (Rifts) * Jenova in Final Fantasy VII, a parasitic being which drains life from any planet that it lands on. Described by Vincent Valentine as being \\"Heaven's Dark Arbiter.\\" * Meteor (Final Fantasy VII); the intention of its caller in the game required the Planet to survive. * Shivan Juggernaut Sathanas could, as a group, create a gigantic ripple in the subspace field surrounding a star, causing the star to become unstable and go nova, ostensibly destroying all planets in the system. (FreeSpace 2) * Shivan Super Destroyer Lucifer used three \\"flux cannons\\", which are more popularly known as \\"beams\\", to obilterate the surface of an entire planet, rendering it invulnerable. However, in the cutscene, the Lucifer used only one, which could release an expansive blast which could burn away a small fraction of a planet. (Descent: FreeSpace ‚Äî The Great War) * Star Generator (Space Quest 1) * Stellar Converters (Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares), plasma cannons of immense size and power that are capable of tearing straight through virtually anything in the line of fire. * The Kilrathi Dreadnought Sivar (Wing Commander: The Secret Missions) - This warship designed by the Kilrathi carried with it the Graviton Weapon, which could destroy a planet and all life on its surface by increasing its gravitational field 137 times the normal force. * TCS Behemoth and the Temblor Bomb (Wing Commander III) - The TCS Behemoth was a super-heavy dreadnought which carried a superlaser capable of obliterating any target ranging from a starship to a planet. The latter weapon, the Temblor Bomb was designed to exploit the instability of a planet's fault line to trigger a super earthquake that would subsequently destabilize a world's entire tectonic makeup, literally shaking it apart to the point of implosion. The Temblor Bomb could only be launched via starfighter, and the player must destroy the Kilrathi homeworld of Kilrah by this means. * Terror Star, a parody of the Death Star (although a fully functional star killer) from Galactic Civilizations * The \\"Iron Helix\\" (used to destroy Calliope if you fail the mission) * The \\"Nova Bomb\\" in X-COM: Interceptor ‚Äì this was a missile carried on fighters which, rather than being used against a planet directly, was fired at the star inside the system. According to in-game details, the Nova Bomb slowly accelerates to light speed and burrows itself into the core, causing the star to go supernova, completely destroying the whole system. After the Doomsday Weapon built by the aliens is located (on the other side of a black hole), the player is told that it can only be destroyed with a Nova Bomb. The technology was considered so dangerous the scientific community asked for all knowledge of the bomb to be stricken from records so it would not fall into the wrong hands. * The \\"Weak nuclear force decoupler\\" from Perfect Dark (Nintendo 64) * The Space Colony ARK's Eclipse Cannon from Sonic Adventure 2 and Shadow the Hedgehog * The Alphacore (Omega Boost) * The Biologic Space Labs research station in Metroid Fusion (Game Boy Advance) is equipped with a self-destruct system capable of destroying a planet within its blast radius. In addition, the planet Zebes was equipped with a planetary self-destruct mechanism in Super Metroid (Super Nintendo Entertainment System) * The Black Egg and Mulligan artifacts (Starflight) * The Crest of Annihilation (Star Ocean: The Second Story) (this device completely obliterates a planet, but it is allegedly powerful enough to wipe out the entire known universe) * The Death Egg from Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Sonic & Knuckles, a parody of the Death Star and a caricature of Dr. Robotnik. Armed with two ion cannons (supposedly) forming the \\"eyes\\" on the \\"face\\", it is damaged and repaired throughout the early Sonic the Hedgehog series. * The Galactic Implosion Device (Total Annihilation) * The 'PlanetBuster Maximus' in the video game Ratchet & Clank, a skyscraper-sized bomb \\"capable of reducing an entire planet to subatomic particles\\". There was another device named 'The DePlanetizer', referred to as \\"The most powerful laser ever invented\\". It consisted of a giant football field-sized platform with a large rotating laser cannon on the bottom and a giant red button on the top. It served as an arena during the final fight with Chairman Drek. The De- Planetizer's purpose was to break planets apart so that Chairman Drek could harvest choice fragments to assemble into his own new planet. * The Ragnarok space station is capable of destroying anything off of the face of the Earth. (Mega Man Zero) * The Moon Dagger from Terminal Velocity. This largue warship is a huge missile that cycles on the target a Fussion Transference Wave, whose effects are described as similar to what a sawed-off shotgun causes to a human. * The trih xeem in the Marathon Trilogy. Name literally means, \\"early nova.\\" * The Void (Super Paper Mario) (this consumes worlds completely, leaving bleak, endless white plains in their place) * Vegnagun in (Final Fantasy X-2) can be seen instigating the destruction of Spira in a \\"bad ending\\". * Smoke's Destroy-The-Earth fatality and Grey-Goo ending (Mortal Kombat) * Planet Busters of (Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri) destructive power ranges from destroying a city to a continent depending on their power source. When used, these weapons increased the chance of the planet's native life seeking to annihilate humanity. In the novelizations, four gravitational singularity‚Äìpowered Planet Busters used by the Believer's trigger such an event. * Cannon Seed (Galaxian 3) * Sorcery Globe (Star Ocean: The Second Story) disrupts a planets 'Expel's' orbit and causes it to crash into Energy Nede. * The USG Ishimura in Dead Space, a deep space mining vessel that extracts minerals from a planet by ripping away large chunks of the crust, and the other planet cracker vessels built after it. The Ishimura herself is said to have cracked 34 planets during her 62-year service. Also, the pre-Ishimura space stations used to \\"harvest\\" Titan. *In Dead Space 3 it is found out that if the alien Necromorph\\"s markers convert all the planet's life into more Necromorph mass, the planet becomes a Brethren moon, a sentient planet size Necromorph that has the ability of interstellar travel and the telepathic powers of the markers who consumes all life on other planets. *The Parasite Machine that sucks energy from the Earth's core in Urban Assault *In Mass Effect, mass accelerators are the primary weapon design, ranging from small arms to multi-kilometer capital ship cannons. One weapon's projectile was powerful enough for a glancing blow to result in a large rift on a planet's surface, comparable to Valles Marineris. Also, various planet-grade WMDs are listed: nuclear weapons of varying yield, asteroids and space stations, and invasive species. Mass Effect: Bring down the sky DLC has a state sponsored terrorist group attempt to navigate an asteroid into a Human colony. Mass Effect 2: Arrival DLC offers the penultimum of kinetic weaponry: an asteroid equipped with a faster-than-light drive can match the power of a supernova; that's how much damage it takes to destroy a mass relay. Mass Effect 3 involves disarming an old Turian bomb that was placed on the Krogan home world in case of a rebellion *The Giant of Bab-il in Final Fantasy IV is teleported to the Blue Planet/Earth for the express purpose of annihilating all life on the planet. *In Final Fantasy V, Exdeath unleashes the power of the Void on the world; Neo-Exdeath (an amalgamation of Exdeath and all the creatures trapped in the Rift) clearly implies that the Void could destroy all life in the universe. *In Final Fantasy IX, Kuja destroys everything within his home planet with a Ultima spell. *Capital Vessels in R-Type have Wave-Cannons stated to be a hundred million times the power of the standard mass-production fighter's, and capable of destroying planets. The in-game description therefore indicates that each of the dozens or hundreds of fighters fielded in every fleet has a re-usable weapon with an output in the low Teratons. * Izanami from the Blazblue series with the True Blazblue can turn most things on the planet to seither and render it a husk. * Dinosaur Planet, which would later be called Sauria in Star Fox Adventures had a force so powerful to blow the planet apart and kill the entire Lylat System. * The Destroyer is a massive golem in The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon. It had the ability to form a wall of fire called the \\"Ring of Annihilation.\\" Once completed the belt of fire would spread reducing the world into fire and ash. * In Stellaris, the Apocalypse DLC allows players to build a Colossus, a massive spaceship that can destroy planets or do other things based on what the player equips it with. * Ogame features the Death Star, by far the largest ship available, that can destroy moons (not planets). * GURPS Spaceships presents the Relativistic kill vehicle Azrael, described as a large AI-controlled missile that impacts its target with a force of 42 million megatons -enough to trigger an extinction event-. *In Kirby Super Star Ultra, a warrior known as Galacta Knight makes his debut. He is referred to as the greatest warrior in the galaxy and a warrior who was sealed away because his power was too great, as mentioned by the Galactic Nova. He later appears in Kirby: Planet Robobot, in which he is summoned by Star Dream, who says: 'He may end up destroying a nearby planet or two, but such is life.'. This indicates that Galacta Knight could quite easily destroy up to two planetary bodies at a time. *Void Termina (Kirby Star Allies) is mentioned to be the Destroyer of Worlds on his splash screen. This can be shown to be a valid description when his death causes a supernova. *In the Traveller roleplaying game there is a highly advanced weapon called a planet buster. It is believed to have been used by the ancients during the war that resulted in their extinction. It is very difficult if not impossible to gain one of these in a normal game. * The Ruin in Starbound is an ancient and giant biological being capable of destroying planets,it loathes all life and tries to kill it all and it was controlled by Arsa Nox and is the final boss of the game *In Outer Wilds, the alien race known as the Nomai constructed a space station capable of prompting its parent star to go supernova, destroying all planets within the blast. The Nomai would use the energy released to power the Ash Twin Project, sending a user's memories back in time 22 minutes. The Ash Twin Project was also linked to a probe cannon looking for a distant body known as the Eye. Sending the memories of the users and the data from the probe back in time allowed the probe to be fired an indefinite number of times, and for the loop to stop in the case of an emergency. Once the Ash Twin Project succeeded, it could tell the sun station to stop firing allowing the Nomai to find a way to travel to the Eye. However, the Sun Station did not output enough power to cause a supernova, and the Ash Twin Project would have to wait until the end of the Sun's natural life cycle to begin a time loop. At the end of Outer Wilds, the player does not find a way to stop the supernova, and must travel to the Eye, having deactivated the Ash Twin Project, using an ancient crashed ship whom the Nomai originated from. After a while, the Universe dies from heat death as all stars reach their deaths and go supernova, destroying all solar systems in the Universe, except for the Eye situated far enough from the blast of the Sun. *Also in Outer Wilds, interrupting a warp when there's still a duplicate of an object from the future will cause spacetime to break, presumably causing everything to cease existence.  Anime and manga  Dragon Ball Many characters in the series can destroy planets. *Both Master Roshi and Piccolo destroyed the Moon in seconds. The former during the 21st Tenkaichi Budokai, and the latter in the Sayian Saga. * Vegeta destroyed Planet Arlia in Dragon Ball Z filler. * Frieza has destroyed Planet Vegeta, Planet Namek, and Earth. * Kid Buu destroyed Earth during the climax of Dragon Ball Z and then destroys multiple other planets while trying to find Goku and Vegeta. * In Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods and the Dragon Ball Super anime, Beerus, the God of Destruction of 7th Universe, destroys planets as a way to prevent overpopulation. * Champa, the God of Destruction of 6th Universe, destroyed several planets with just kicks and punches while chasing his twin brother Beerus. The two are forbidden to engage in physical combat as prolonged combat will destroy both Universes 6 & 7\\\\. * Vados destroyed a planet by tapping her sceptre in space, in the Dragon Ball Super anime. * Zamasu destroyed all seven planet-sized Super Dragon Balls in the I anime. * The original Broly was shown to destroy a planet with ease and destroyed a galaxy in beginning of Broly ‚Äì The Lendgary Super Saiyan. * As a child, Son Gohan destroys the Makyo Star, (a star or planet that gives Garlic Jr. extra power) in anime filler. Kiddy Grade * Geo-Sort technology has the ability to reconfigure large amounts of matter at the molecular level; thus it can not only destroy entire planets, but make hostile planets habitable through terraforming. * The Deucalion presumably has this capability as well, since it is outfitted with Geo-Sort technology (but this is never demonstrated in the series). Sailor Moon * One of the Outer Senshi, Sailor Saturn, can destroy an entire planet by just dropping her weapon (the Silence Glaive) with the intent to destroy, no attack calling necessary. * Sailor Galaxia is also able to point at a planet and, if she possesses the will to, completely destroy it. * The main protagonist, Sailor Moon (as Neo Queen Serenity), possesses the power to destroy an entire solar system, including its star. Gall Force In the first 3 Gall Force movies both sides the Solnoid and Paranoid Axis forces have had both their home worlds destroyed in a war of mutual assured destruction. They plan on using the last of their planet destroyers and include the new system destroyers in their final battle plans. Gurren Lagann The main antagonist, the Anti-Spiral, is shown to have destroyed many planets, stars, and galaxies. In the second film adaptation, an entire universe is destroyed in the Anti-Spiral's clash with the similarly powerful Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Tenchi the Movie: Tenchi Muyo in Love In the final battle with Kain, who is apparently powerful enough to destroy a planet on his own. Washu decides to have Kiyone make use of a \\"Dimensional Cannon\\". In spite of Kiyone's protests that you shouldn't even use it on a city because it is made for taking out small galaxies. Space Battleship Yamato (Star Blazers) Throughout the series and movies, including Rebirth and the recent live action film, the Yamato (Argo) and similar battleships in the Earth Defense Force are armed with a Wave Motion Gun. This weapon of last resort is capable of obliterating entire fleets in one shot, as well as most moon and planetary sized objects. The downside of using this weapon is that it leaves the ship defenseless before and after firing due to the massive amount of energy needed to fire it (except in Rebirth, where the ship could fire six shots without recharging.) Also included would be the Desler (Desslok) cannon, built on the same principle (Tachyon Compression), and the main cannon in Zordar's dreadnaught, which was deployed at the end of season 2. In the remake Star Blazers: Space Battleship Yamato 2202 the White Comet of the Gatlantis Empire is a planet killing weapon, that captures and destroy a planet's biosphere. Eureka seveN At the end of the series, it is established that the Coralians have the ability to engulf a planet and form their own version of a planetary crust, although they did not exercise it with the purpose of making a planet uninhabitable. The End of Evangelion At the end of the movie, the Human Instrumentality Project is carried out and the Human race is combined into one shared consciousness. Comics DC Comics * Superboy Prime destroyed Earth-15 in Countdown to Final Crisis, Issue #24 * Superman destroyed several replica planets in Shadows Linger Part Two: The Long Road, Volume 1 Issue #675. In the alternate universe Injustice storyline, during the final battle against the Green Lantern Corps at the end of Year Two, Superman killed Mogo, the living planet, by throwing it into the Sun. Other media * Buster Machine III, aka the Black Hole Bomb in Gunbuster uses the mass of a gas giant planet (specifically, Jupiter) to create a black hole which ultimately destroys the center of the Milky Way galaxy. * Galactus, a being from the Marvel Comics Universe, specifically the Fantastic Four books, consumes planets for their energy in order to sustain himself. He is often aided in this process by one of his heralds, the most famous among them being the Silver Surfer. His name is given to Galactus Syndrome. His daughter Galacta is capable of doing the same. Also, there exists a great number of characters capable of planet busting. * In DC Comics, the Warworld is a planet killer. As in Marvel, there is a great number of characters who can destroy planets. * In the Marvel Comics Universe there exists the Godkiller, which destroys planets by flying through them without slowing down - presumably as an incidental side-effect of performing its main function - killing Celestials. * Big Venus (The Big O). * Serpentera from Power Rangers. * Erdammeru the Void-Hound (DC Comics) * In Getter Robo Armageddon, the protagonists manage to create a massive Getter Beam Tomahawk powerful enough to slice through planets. Likewise, in some Getter Robo manga, an entire fleet of impossibly enormous Getter Emperors exist. These super- mecha are so large, they create their own gravity field that can actually shatter planets as they pass. * In Vandread, A special variant of harvest ship can destroy planets that are not needed by Earth anymore. * In the Eek! The Cat episode Eek vs. The Flying Saucers, aliens called Zoltarians threaten to blow up the Earth using a death ray powered by Eek's 300-pound girlfriend, Annabelle, and want to do so because Earth \\"obstructs our view of Uranus.\\" * In the Exosquad episode A Night Before Doomsday an antimatter bomb capable of destroying all life on Earth is revealed and its activation by the Neosapien leader Phaeton dying of Automutation Syndrome is prevented in the episode Abandon Hope. * In Chodenji Machine Voltes V, a Magmite bomb was planted by general Oslack to destroy the Earth. * In the cartoon Invader Zim, the Planet Jackers tried to feed the Earth to their sun to keep it from going out. * In Gunbuster, Buster Machine #7 and #19 work in tandem to destroy an Earth-sized life form and a black hole which it carries in tow. * In Gunbuster's sequel series: Diebuster, the android Buster Machine #7 splits the moon Titan in half. * The Super Robot Mazinkaiser is said to be capable of blasting a hole right down to a planet's core with a full-powered Fire Blaster. * The Vok second Moon (Beast Wars: Transformers) (could only destroy energon-rich worlds) * The Annihilatrix from Frisky Dingo is designed to launch Earth into the Sun. Designed being the operative word. In the end it manages to push Earth out of its orbit - into an orbit that is further from the sun. One foot further. * The Beast Planet in Shadow Raiders. * The Desiccator in Dark Reign. * The Ideon Sword (capable of slicing a planet in half) and the Ideon Gun (capable of cutting large swaths of destruction encompassing thousands of ships and celestial bodies) from Space Runaway Ideon.

He spent his entire career as a shortstop for the Cleveland Indians. Chapman was hit in the head by a pitch thrown by Yankees pitcher Carl Mays and died 12 hours later. He is the only Major League Baseball player to die from an injury received during an MLB game. His death led Major League Baseball to establish a rule requiring umpires to replace the ball whenever it became dirty. Chapman‚Äôs death and sanitary concerns also led to the ban on spitballs after the 1920 season. Chapman's death was one of the examples cited to justify the wear of batting helmets. However, it took over 30 years to adopt the rule that requires their use. Career Chapman was born in Beaver Dam, Kentucky, and raised in Herrin, Illinois. He broke into the Major Leagues in 1912 with the Cleveland team, then known as the Naps. Chapman led the American League in runs scored and walks in 1918. A top-notch bunter, Chapman is sixth on the all-time list for sacrifice hits and holds the single season record with 67 in 1917. Only Stuffy McInnis has more career sacrifices as a right-handed batter. Chapman was also an excellent shortstop who led the league in assists once. He batted .300 or better three times, and led the Indians in stolen bases four times. In 1917, he set a team record of 52 stolen bases, which stood until 1980. He was hitting .303 with 97 runs scored when he died. He was one of the few players who Ty Cobb considered a friend. There was conjecture that 1920 was going to be Chapman's last year as a pro baseball player. Shortly before the season began, Chapman married Kathleen Daly, who was the daughter of a prominent Cleveland businessman. Chapman had indicated he was going to retire to devote himself to the family business into which he was marrying, as well as to begin a family.http://www.thedeadballera.com/participants.html Death Ray Chapman's grave On August 16, 1920, Chapman was struck in the head and killed by a pitch thrown by Carl Mays during a game against the New York Yankees at the Polo Grounds. At the time, pitchers commonly dirtied balls with soil, licorice, and tobacco juice, and scuffed, sandpapered, scarred, cut, or spiked them, giving a \\"misshapen, earth-colored ball that traveled through the air erratically, tended to soften in the later innings, and, as it came over the plate, was very hard to see.\\" Mays threw with a submarine delivery, and it was late afternoon. Eyewitnesses recounted that Chapman did not react to the pitch at all, presumably unable to see it. The sound of the ball striking Chapman's skull was so loud that Mays thought it had hit the end of Chapman's bat; he fielded the ball and threw to first base. Chapman collapsed to his knees, bleeding from his left ear. He was mumbling as he was helped off the field and taken to the hospital where he died about 4:40 a.m. His pregnant wife Katie, summoned from Cleveland by phone, arrived at 10:00 a.m. and fainted on learning he had died. Thousands of mourners attended Chapman's funeral at the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Cleveland and he was buried at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio. Cleveland players wore black armbands for the remainder of the season. Honors Restored Chapman plaque at Heritage Park in Progressive Field A bronze plaque was designed in Chapman's memory, funded by donations from fans, was hung at League Park and was moved to Cleveland Stadium when the Indians moved there in 1946. Sometime in the early 1970s, however, it was removed for unknown reasons. In 2007 it was refurbished and made part of Progressive Field's Heritage Park, which includes the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame and other exhibits from the team's history. Chapman had been inducted into the team hall of fame in 2006, part of the first new induction class since 1972.

His poems often had an inspirational and optimistic view of everyday life. Early life Guest was born in Birmingham, England in 1881. That year, his family moved to the United States from England where he was to grow up. Career After he began at the Detroit Free Press as a copy boy and then a reporter, his first poem appeared 11 December 1898. He became a naturalized citizen in 1902. For 40 years, Guest was widely read throughout North America, and his sentimental, optimistic poems were in the same vein as the light verse of Nick Kenny, who wrote syndicated columns during the same decades. From his first published work in the Detroit Free Press until his death in 1959, Guest penned some 11,000 poems which were syndicated in some 300 newspapers and collected in more than 20 books, including A Heap o' Livin' (1916) and Just Folks (1923‚Äì1957). Guest was made Poet Laureate of Michigan, the only poet to have been awarded the title. His popularity led to a weekly Detroit radio show which he hosted from 1931 until 1942, followed by a 1951 NBC television series, A Guest in Your House. He also had a thrice-weekly transcribed radio program that began January 15, 1941, and was sponsored by Land O'Lakes Creameries. The program featured singer Eddy Howard. Guest was made a Freemason in Detroit, where he was a lifetime member of Ashlar Lodge No. 91. In honor of Guest's devotion to the Craft, community, and humanity in general, the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Michigan established the Edgar A. Guest Award for lodges to present to non- Masons within the community who have demonstrated distinguished service to the community and their fellow man. When Guest died in 1959, he was buried in Detroit's Woodlawn Cemetery. His grand-niece Judith Guest is a novelist who wrote Ordinary People (novel).  Excerpts  Guest's most famous poem is the oft-quoted \\"Home\\": :It don't make a difference how rich ye get t' be' :How much yer chairs and tables cost, how great the luxury; :It ain't home t' ye, though it be the palace of a king, :Until somehow yer soul is sort o' wrapped round everything. :Within the walls there's got t' be some babies born an' then... :Right there ye've got t' bring em up t' women good, an' men; :Home ain't a place that gold can buy or get up in a minute; :Afore it's home there's got t' be a heap o' living in it.\\" :::::::::‚ÄîExcerpt from \\"Home,\\" It takes A Heap o' Livin' (1916) :When you're up against a trouble, ::Meet it squarely, face to face, :::Lift your chin, and set your shoulders, ::::Plant your feet and take a brace, :::::When it's vain to try to dodge it, ::::::Do the best that you can do. :::::::You may fail, but you may conquer ‚Äì ::::::::See it through! ::::::::::‚ÄîExcerpt from \\"See It Through\\" Guest's most motivating poem: :You can do as much as you think you can, :But you'll never accomplish more; :If you're afraid of yourself, young man, :There's little for you in store. :For failure comes from the inside first, :It's there, if we only knew it, :And you can win, though you face the worst, :If you feel that you're going to do it. ::::::::::‚ÄîExcerpt from \\"The Secret of the Ages\\" (1926) Reputation Guest's work still occasionally appears in periodicals such as Reader's Digest, and some favorites, such as \\"Myself\\" and \\"Thanksgiving,\\" are still studied today. However, in one of the most quoted appraisals of his work, Dorothy Parker reputedly said: \\"I'd rather flunk my Wassermann test than read a poem by Edgar Guest.\\" In popular culture A favorite poet of Edith Bunker from the TV show All In The Family. She quotes him in a few episodes including 'Prisoner In The House', first broadcast on 4 January 1975. Edgar Guest is depicted on the badge worn by the crew of Count Olaf's submarine Carmelita in The Grim Grotto, the eleventh book in Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events. In the book Guest is mocked as a \\"writer of limited skill, who wrote awkward, tedious poetry on hopelessly sentimental topics\\" (The Grim Grotto (2004) p. 281). In the novel I Am Legend, the main character Robert Neville sardonically comments on his own internal monologue: \\"The last man in the world is Edgar Guest\\". Guest's poem \\"It Couldn't Be Done\\" was recited by Idris Elba on the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year Award on 16 December 2012 whilst celebrating Team GB and Paralympics GB winning the team award for 2012. Guest's poem \\"The Epicure\\" was reproduced in Mad #84 (January 1964) with new illustrations by Don Martin. Guest's poem \\"See It Through,\\" was used in a Chrysler 300 commercial. Guest's poem \\"It Couldn't Be Done\\" was used in an Audi commercial. Tracey Gold did read Guest's poem \\"A Child Of Mine\\" during the funeral of Judith Barsi. \\"It Couldn't Be Done\\" inspired a parody, \\"They Said That It Couldn't Be Done\\", by comedian Benny Hill.

She was the first person to record Johann Sebastian Bach's Goldberg Variations on the harpsichord in 1933. She became a naturalized French citizen in 1938. Life and career Life in Europe Leonid Pasternak. Concert of Wanda Landowska in Moscow (1907), a pastel from the Tretyakov Gallery. Landowska was born in Warsaw to Jewish parents. Her father was a lawyer, and her mother a linguist who translated Mark Twain into Polish. She began playing piano at the age of four, and studied at the Warsaw Conservatory with the senior Jan Kleczy≈Ñski and Aleksander Micha≈Çowski. She was considered a child prodigy.Kottick, Edward L. A History of the Harpsichord, Volume 1. Indiana University Press, 2003. p. 425 She studied composition and counterpoint under Heinrich Urban in Berlin, and had lessons in Paris with Moritz Moszkowski. She began her performing career in Paris, where her recitals in that city and other European cities garnered praise from critics. She was interested in the music of J. S. Bach, whose works for harpsichord were included in her recitals by 1903, earning praise from Albert Schweitzer. She decided to devote her career to the harpsichord rather than the piano, against the wishes of her friends, who thought she had a promising future as a pianist. In 1908‚Äì09, she toured Russia with a Pleyel harpsichord, similar to the 1889 model that the firm displayed at the Paris Exposition.Kottick, Edward L. A History of the Harpsichord, Volume 1. Indiana University Press, 2003. p. 426 After eloping with and marrying Polish folklorist and ethnomusicologist Henry Lew in 1900 in Paris, she taught piano at the Schola Cantorum there (1900‚Äì1912).Kottick, Edward L. A History of the Harpsichord, Volume 1. Indiana University Press, 2003. p. 428 She later taught harpsichord at the Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Musik (1912‚Äì1919). When World War I started in 1914, she was interned on the grounds that she was a foreign national. After WWI ended, her husband died in a car accident. She had her American debut in 1923, touring major cities with four Pleyel Grand Modele de Concert harpsichords, which were huge seven-and-a-half foot long instruments with foot pedal-controlled registers. These were large, heavily built harpsichords with a 16-foot stop (a set of strings an octave below normal pitch) and owed much to piano construction. Deeply interested in musicology, and particularly in the works of Bach, Couperin and Rameau, she toured the museums of Europe looking at original keyboard instruments; she acquired old instruments and had new ones made at her request by Pleyel and Company. Responding to criticism by fellow Bach specialist Pablo Casals, she once said: \\"You play Bach your way, and I'll play him 'his' way.\\" Landowska's favored instrument, the Pleyel Grand Mod√®le de Concert (1927) Berlin: Musikinstrumentenmuseum A number of important new works were written for her: Manuel de Falla's El retablo de maese Pedro (Master Peter's Puppet Show) marked the return of the harpsichord to the modern orchestra. Falla later wrote a harpsichord concerto for her, and Francis Poulenc composed his Concert champ√™tre for her. She taught at the Curtis Institute of Music from 1925 until 1928. She established the √âcole de Musique Ancienne at Paris in 1925: from 1927, her home in Saint-Leu-la-For√™t became a center for the performance and study of old music. During this time Landowska frequented the salon of Natalie Clifford Barney, to both socialize and perform. Life in America When the German Army invaded France, Landowska fled with her student and domestic partner Denise Restout. After leaving Saint-Leu in 1940, sojourning in Banyuls-sur-Mer, a commune in southern France, where her friend, sculptor Aristide Maillol was living, they sailed from Lisbon to the United States. Believing the Nazi threat to be temporary she had left with only two suitcases. She arrived in New York on 7 December 1941, the date of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Her home in Saint-Leu was looted, and her instruments and manuscripts were stolen, so she arrived in the United States essentially with no assets. Her 1942 performance of Bach's \\"Goldberg Variations\\" at New York's Town Hall was the first occasion in the 20th century where the piece was played on the harpsichord, the instrument for which it had been written. NYWTS/LOC cph.3c11230. Wanda Landowska, 1953 She settled in Lakeville, Connecticut in 1949, and re-established herself as a performer and teacher in the United States, touring extensively. Her last public performance was in 1954. Her partner, Denise Restout, was editor and translator of her writings on music, including Musique ancienne, and Landowska on Music, published posthumously in 1964. thumb Landowska recorded extensively for the Victor Talking Machine Company/RCA Victor and The Gramophone Company/EMI.

Reviews and opinions *\\"Almost needless to say, the playing is full of vigorous gestures and individual ideas. She was no respecter of text and there are little repeats here and there which are no more indicated than they are necessary. Yet such matters seem something of an irrelevance, since they only reflect an attitude of the time adopted by a celebrated pioneer of the harpsichord revival in the twentieth century. No, what charms me in Landowska's recital is her affecting poetic insight into Scarlatti's music; she is not just rediscovering the proper conjunction of composer and instrument, she believes in it and feels it intensely.\\" *Sol Babitz stated that \\"She always played the music 'as written' with the result that a series of fast notes did not sound like 'bundles of them' (North 1700) but like a sewing machine. Thanks to her wide influence this blight can be heard in her pupils to this day.\\" A favourite 16th-century Landowska harpsichord from her collection, with painting on lid, presently housed in the Hans Adler memorial music collection. *\\"Wanda Landowska's harpsichord recital of last evening at the Town Hall was as stimulating as a needle shower. Indeed, the sound of that princely instrument, when it is played with art and fury, makes one think of golden rain and of how Dana√´‚Äôs flesh must have tingled when she found herself caught out in just such a downpour‚Ä¶.She played everything better than anybody else ever does. That is to say that the way she makes music is so deeply satisfactory that one has the feeling of a fruition, of a completeness at once intellectual and sensuously auditory beyond which it is difficult to imagine anything further.‚Äù Further reading *Wanda Landowska- Oxford Academic Journals *Landowska Blog *Wanda Landowska Britannica.com *Wanda Landowsk Encyclopedia.com *Death of Early Music Pioneer Wanda Landowska *Wanda Landowska and the Met *Wanda Landowska Porta Polonica *Wanda Landowska 1879-1959HOLCMAN, JAN. ‚ÄúWANDA LANDOWSKA 1879 ‚Äì 1959.‚Äù The Polish Review, vol. 4, no. 3, 1959, pp. 3‚Äì6.

The memorial is located in downtown Oklahoma City on the former site of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, which was destroyed in the 1995 bombing. This building was located on NW 5th Street between N. Robinson Avenue and N. Harvey Avenue. The national memorial was authorized on October 9, 1997, by President Bill Clinton's signing of the Oklahoma City National Memorial Act of 1997. It was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places the same day. The memorial is administered by Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation, with National Park Service staff to help interpret the memorial for visitors. The memorial was formally dedicated on April 19, 2000: the fifth anniversary of the bombing. The museum was dedicated and opened the following year on February 19. History On April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh parked a Ryder rental truck filled with explosives in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The resulting explosion killed 168 people and destroyed the entire north face of the building. Months after the attack, Mayor Ron Norick appointed a task force to look into a creation of a permanent memorial where the Murrah building once stood. The Task Force called for 'a symbolic outdoor memorial', a Memorial Museum, and for creation of Oklahoma City National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism. Six hundred and twenty four designs were submitted for the memorial and on July 1997 a design by Butzer Design Partnership, which consists of husband and wife Hans and Torrey Butzer, was chosen. On October 1997, President Bill Clinton signed law creating the Oklahoma City National Memorial as a unit of the National Park Service to be operated by the Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust. The total cost of the memorial was $29.1 million; $10 million for the Outdoor Symbolic Memorial, $7 million for the Memorial Museum, $5 million for the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism and the rest for other costs. The federal government appropriated $5 million for construction with the state of Oklahoma matching that amount. More than $17 million in private donations was raised. On April 19, 2000, the fifth anniversary of the attack, the Outdoor Symbolic Memorial was dedicated. On February 19, 2001 the Memorial Museum was dedicated. In 2004 it was transferred from the NPS to the Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation, designating it an affiliated area of National Park System. The Oklahoma City National Memorial since its opening has seen over 4.4 million visitors to the Outdoor Symbolic Memorial and 1.6 million visitors to the Memorial Museum. The Memorial has an average of 350,000 visitors per year. Memorial features The Field of Empty Chairs, east Gate of Time, and Reflecting Pool at the Oklahoma City National Memorial. The Oklahoma City National Memorial as seen from the base of the reflecting pool. After surviving the bombing, the Survivor Tree became an emblem of the Memorial. The Memorial Fence and east Gate of Time. The Outdoor Symbolic Memorial consists of the following segments on 3.3 acres (13,000 m2), and are accessible day or night. * The Gates of Time: Monumental twin bronze gates frame the moment of destruction ‚Äì 9:02 ‚Äì and mark the formal entrances to the Outdoor Memorial. 9:01, found on the eastern gate, represents the last moments of peace, while its opposite on the western gate, 9:03, represents the first moments of recovery. Both time stamps are inscribed on the interior of the monument, facing each other and the Reflecting Pool. :The outside of each gate bears this inscription: We come here to remember Those who were killed, those who survived and those changed forever. May all who leave here know the impact of violence. May this memorial offer comfort, strength, peace, hope and serenity. * Reflecting Pool: A thin layer of water flows over polished black granite to form the pool, which runs east to west down the center of the Memorial (also see reflecting pool) on what was once Fifth Street. Although the pool is flowing, visitors are able to see a mirror image of themselves in the water. Visitors seeing their reflections are said to be seeing \\"someone changed forever by what happened here.\\" * Field of Empty Chairs: 168 empty chairs hand-crafted from glass, bronze, and stone represent those who lost their lives, with a name etched in the glass base of each. They sit on the site where the Murrah Building once stood. The chairs are arranged in nine rows to symbolize the nine floors of the building; each person's chair is on the row (or the floor) on which the person worked or was located when the bomb went off. The chairs are also grouped according to the blast pattern, with the most chairs nearest the most heavily damaged portion of the building. The westernmost column of five chairs represents the five people who died but were not in the Murrah Building (two in the Water Resources Board building, one in the Athenian Building, one outside near the building, and one rescuer). The 19 smaller chairs represent the children killed in the bombing. Three unborn children died along with their mothers, and they are listed on their mothers' chairs beneath their mothers' names. * Survivors' Wall: The only remaining original portions of the Murrah Building are the north and east walls, known as the Survivors' Wall. The wall has several panels of granite salvaged from the Murrah Building itself, inscribed with the names of more than 600 survivors from the building and the surrounding area, many of whom were injured in the blast. * Survivor Tree: An American elm on the north side of the Memorial that was heavily damaged by the bomb, but survived. Hundreds of seeds from the Survivor Tree are planted annually and the resulting saplings are distributed each year on the anniversary of the bombing. Thousands of Survivor Trees are growing in public and private places all over the U.S. * The Memorial Fence: A chain link fence was installed around the area that is now the Reflecting Pool and the Field of Empty Chairs to protect the site from damage and visitors from injury. The Fence stood for more than four years, becoming notable as the place where visitors left stuffed animals, poems, keychains, and other items as tributes. During the construction of the Outdoor Memorial, 210 feet (64 m) of the Fence was moved to the west side of the Memorial, along the 9:03 side or the 'healing' side. The remainder of the Fence is in storage. Visitors may still leave small items along and in the Fence; the mementos are periodically collected, cataloged, and stored. * Rescuers' Orchard: A grove of Oklahoma redbuds (Oklahoma's state tree), Amur Maple, Chinese Pistache, and Bosque Elm trees are planted on the lawn around the Survivor Tree. The trees represent the rescuers who came to the aid of the survivors; hence the rescuer's orchard surrounds the survivor tree. The non-native species represent those rescuers who came from outside Oklahoma to help. * Children's Area: More than 5,000 hand-painted tiles, from all over the United States and Canada, were made by children and sent to Oklahoma City after the bombing in 1995. Most are stored in the Memorial's Archives, and a sampling of tiles is on the wall in the Children's Area. Chalkboards provide a place where children can draw and share their feelings. The Children's Area is north of the 9:03 gate, on the west side of the Museum. * Journal Record Building: North of the memorial is the Journal Record Building, which formerly housed the offices of The Journal Record. It now houses the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum, which features numerous exhibits and artifacts related to the Oklahoma City bombing. * Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building Plaza: Located just south of the Field of Empty Chairs, above the underground parking garage, is the raised Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building Plaza. An original part of the federal building, the plaza had a garden and seating areas, as well as a playground for the daycare center. Visitors to the Memorial can walk across the plaza, where the original flagpole is used for the American flag. Adjacent memorials Two churches were located across the street from the Murrah Building. Both were heavily damaged by the blast. Each church was repaired and both constructed memorials on their property. While not part of the official memorial they are open to the public. * Heartland Chapel: Across the street from the 9:01 gate is an open air wooden chapel erected by First United Methodist Church of Oklahoma City. The altar is made from church stones damaged by the bombing. A substantial portion of the funding for the chapel was provided by the Jewish community. * And Jesus Wept: Across the street from the 9:03 gate is a sculpture of Jesus weeping erected by St. Joseph's Catholic Church, one of the first brick-and-mortar churches built in the city. Jesus faces away from the devastation, covering his face with his hand. In front of Jesus is a wall with 168 gaps in it, representing the voids left by each life lost.

The associated bands generally played guitar-based rock music often accompanied by keyboards. The movement was short lived and several of the bands involved were later linked with the more commercially successful Britpop, which it immediately preceded, and the NWONW was described by John Harris of The Guardian (one of the journalists who first coined the term) as \\"Britpop without the good bits\\".Harris, John (2006) \\"The new wave of old rubbish\\", The Guardian, 13 October 2006.

Zinsou was present at the signing of the treaty that formed the African Union on 12 July 2000 in Togo. Biography Early life and medical career Zinsou was born in Ouidah on 23 March 1918. He was educated at Porto Novo and the Ecole William Ponty in Senegal. He studied medicine at the Dakar Medical College and qualified as a doctor. Zinsou was a physician in the French army from 1939 to 1940. Afterwards he operated a private practice and began to become involved in colonial politics.Houngnikpo & Decalo 2013, p. 373. Political career and presidency Zinsou was one of the founders of Dahomey's first political party, the Union Progressiste Dahom√©enne (UPD). He was an assistant to Sourou-Migan Apithy in 1945 and was a deputy to the French National Assembly. From 1947 to 1953 he was vice president of the Assembly to the French Union. During this time the UPD splintered into ethnic/regional factions led by Apithy, Hubert Maga, and Justin Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin. Zinsou merged the remainder of the UPD with Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin's Bloc Populaire Africain to form the Union D√©mocratique Dahom√©enne.Houngnikpo & Decalo 2013, p. 374. He served in the French senate from 1955 to 1958, joining the Independents d'Outre-Mer. While a senator, Zinsou developed a close bond with future President of Senegal L√©opold S√©dar Senghor. Zinsou was a deputy to Dahomey's Territorial (later National) Assembly and was Minister of Commerce during the \\"loi-cadre\\" liberalization period of 1958 to 1959. He did not want to see the breakup of France's African colonies after independence and was the secretary of the Dakar-based Parti du Regroupement Africain (PRA). Zinsou broke with Apithy in 1959 after Apithy backed out of the idea of a Mali Federation, one of the PRA's chief proposals. After Dahomey achieved independence, Zinsou became the ambassador to France. Under Maga, he was Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1962 to an abrupt dismissal in 1963. He was Francophone Africa's candidate for the role of the secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity in 1964. In early 1965 he was an advisor to the South African Anglo-American Corporation in Paris. Zinsou was again foreign minister from late December 1965 to 1967 in General Christophe Soglo's administration. Following the 1967 coup and the electoral boycott in 1968, Zinsou was the military's pick for president and was sworn in on 17 July 1968. This was quite unusual because he was a staunch anti-militarist. As President, Zinsou promoted anti-smuggling policies, countermeasures against strikes, and a more efficient tax collecting system. This upset some people and military officers were infuriated by his independent actions. As a result, his chief of staff Maurice Kouand√©t√© deposed him on 10 December 1969. Although Zinsou was injured when machine guns fired on the presidential palace, two of his bodyguards were murdered. Zinsou received a mere 3 percent of votes in the 1970 presidential election and rejected an offer to join the presidential council. Instead, he opted to move to Paris.Houngnikpo & Decalo 2013, p. 375. Later life and death He is said to have opposed the one-party Marxist policies of Mathieu K√©r√©kou, who ruled Benin from 1972 to 1990. On 17 March 1975, following an attempted coup led by Janvier Assogba, Zinsou was accused of being complicit. He was sentenced to death in absentia. On 16 January 1977 an attempted coup d'√©tat took place in Benin with a group of armed men led by renowned French mercenary \\"Colonel\\" Bob Denard. The operation, called Op√©ration Crevette (or Operation Shrimp), was mounted in order to oust leftist President Mathieu K√©r√©kou. In his autobiography, Bob Denard has mentioned that Emile Derlin Zinsou was to be reinstated in power in the aftermath of the coup, and that he was in fact waiting on board the mercenaries' plane that fled the country when the coup attempt failed. Zinsou has often denied being linked to the coup, but refused to comment on Denard's writings. In 1990, Zinsou returned to Benin after his 17-year exile. He opposed the new constitution in the referendum of 2 December 1990 but was unsuccessful. Zinsou was a mediator in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during that country's civil war in the late 1990s; he arrived in Kinshasa on 20 September 1999, along with fellow mediator Padre Matteo Zuppi, and met with President Laurent- D√©sir√© Kabila.\\"Congolese mediators meet Kabila\\", BBC News, 23 September 1999. Zinsou was, as of 2007, the Honorary President of the National Union for Democracy and Progress political party.Chales Yansunnu, \\"Mathieu K√©r√©kou refuse l‚Äô√©cole des anciens pr√©sidents\\" , Fraternite, 15 June 2007 . In January 2006, he announced his support for Yayi Boni in the March 2006 presidential election.Thibaud Nagnonhou, \\"5e Conseil national de l‚ÄôUNDP : Le Pr√©sident Zinsou et les siens jettent leur d√©volu sur Yayi Boni\\", L'Informateur, 23 January 2006 . Zinsou, like other world leaders of the time, contributed to a disc left on the surface of the Moon by the astronauts of Apollo 11. Zinsou died in his home on 28 July 2016 in Cotonou, Benin. He was 98 years old.

He is remembered especially for his 1935 book, Rats, Lice and History. Biography Early life The son of German immigrants, Zinsser was born in New York City in 1878. He attended Timothy Dwight School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He received his undergraduate degree from Columbia University in 1899 and completed both a master's degree and a doctorate in medicine there in 1903. In 1905, he married Ruby Handforth Kunz, eldest daughter of the mineralogist, George Frederick Kunz, and they had two children, Hans Handforth and Gretel Zinsser, and they all lived in Boston. Career Zinsser as a US Army Medical Corps officer in World War I After holding a series of academic medicine positions, Zinsser became an associate professor at Stanford University in 1910. In 1913, he moved to a position at his alma mater. At Columbia, he was the doctoral advisor of Rebecca Lancefield, although he did not permit her to physically work in his laboratory due to her gender.O'Hern, Elizabeth (1975). \\"Rebecca Craighill Lancefield, Pioneer Microbiologist\\" (PDF). ASM News. 4: 805‚Äì810. Ten years later, Zinsser was hired by Harvard Medical School, where he stayed ‚Äî except for service in the US Army Medical Corps in World War I ‚Äî until his death. US Army Distinguished Service Medal Zinsser taught as an exchange professor and worked with the American Red Cross in France, Russia, Serbia and China, and was noted for his work in typhus and immunology. He became a lieutenant colonel in the US Army and served overseas during World War I. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, the citation for which read as follows \\"For exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services while acting as Sanitation Inspector of the Second Army he organized, perfected and administered with extraordinary and exceptional success a plan of military sanitation and epidemic-disease control.\\" Zinsser also received another military citation for taking exceptional risks to minister to wounded soldiers while under direct enemy fire. He was also awarded the Order of St. Sava of Serbia and the Legion of Honour in France. Zinsser's scientific work focused on bacteriology and immunology and he is most associated with typhus, especially the form called Brill‚ÄìZinsser disease, his namesake. He isolated the typhus bacterium and developed a protective vaccine. He wrote several books about biology and bacteria, notably Rats, Lice and History (1935), a \\"biography\\" of typhus fever.Zinsser, Hans (1935), Rats, Lice, and History: Being a Study in Biography, Which, After Twelve Preliminary Chapters Indispensable for the Preparation of the Lay Reader, Deals With the Life History of Typhus Fever (Reprinted in 1963, 1996 (Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers), and 2007 (Transaction Publishers)) Zinsser had a strong influence on the work of Albert Coons (1912‚Äì1978), who developed the technique of immunohistochemistry.

Johnston of the Confederate army, took place between June 18, 1864, and July 2, 1864. Sherman's army consisted of 100,000 men, 254 cannons and 35,000 horses, while Johnston's army had only 50,000 men and 187 cannons. Much of the battle took place not on Kennesaw Mountain itself, but on a spur of Little Kennesaw Mountain known now as Pigeon Hill, and the area to its south around Cheatham Hill. A total of 5,350 soldiers died during the battle, which resulted in a Confederate victory.  Park  Peter Valentine Kolb's Farm House at Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park Established as Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Site on February 18, 1917, it was transferred from the War Department on August 10, 1933, and redesignated a national battlefield park on June 26, 1935. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Kennesaw Mountain Battlefield Park is a National Battlefield that preserves a Civil War battleground of the Atlanta Campaign. There are three battlefield areas: In front of the Visitor Center, off Burnt Hickory Road and a major site at Cheatham Hill (commonly known as the Dead Angle). At the southern tip of the park, Peter Valentine Kolb's farm house, where a minor battle was fought, has been restored to its original condition. The Visitor Center contains an information desk, museum, and a theater which screens movies about the battle fought there. While walking some of the of interpretive hiking trails, historic earthworks, cannon emplacements, and various interpretive signs can be seen. There are three monuments representing some of the states who fought here - Illinois, Texas, and Georgia. Kennesaw Mountain is above sea level. It is approximately a gain in elevation from the Visitor Center to the mountain's summit. The hike up is approximately on the road and on the trail.  Mission  Monument to Illinois soldiers at Cheatham Hill (The Dead Angle) Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield was authorized for protection by the U.S. War Department in 1917 and was transferred to the Department of the Interior as a unit of the National Park System in 1933. The battlefield includes the site of some of the heaviest fighting of the Atlanta Campaign of the Civil War. The battlefield was set aside as an important cultural property dedicated to public inspiration and interpretation of the significant historic events that occurred here. With the expansion of urban sprawl from nearby Atlanta, Georgia, concerns have been raised that the preserved areas of the park may be in danger from overuse and/or misuse.

He was also an early psychical investigator. Z√∂llner illusion Biography From 1872 he held the chair of astrophysics at Leipzig University. He wrote numerous papers on photometry and spectrum analysis in Poggendorff's Annalen and Berichte der k. s√§chsischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften, two works on celestial photometry (Grundz√ºge einer allgemeinen Photometrie des Himmels, Berlin, 1861, 4to, and Photometrische Untersuchungen, Leipzig, 1865, 8vo), and a curious book, Ueber die Natur der Cometen (Leipzig, 1872, 3rd ed. 1883). He discovered the Z√∂llner illusion where lines that are parallel appear diagonal. He also successfully proved Christian Doppler's theory on the effect of motion of the color of stars, and the resulting shift of absorption lines, via the invention of a very sensitive spectroscope which he named \\"Reversionspectroscope\\". He had shown also that the red-shift was in addition caused by variation in the stars' lights intensities with the help of his \\"Astrophotometer\\".Pannekoek, Antonie. (1990). A History of Astronomy. Courier Corporation. p. 385. In 1867 he made the first measurement of the Sun's apparent magnitude, using a particular \\"telescope / photometer\\" he designed. The instrument was able to superimpose two images, one from a small telescope and the second from a reference lamp. During daytime he dimmed the image of the Sun (using polarizers and diaphragms) and compared it to the lamp. During nighttime, the lamp was dimmed and compared to bright stars. He estimated the visual magnitude of the Sun to be -26.66, an extraordinary result for the time. Today's accepetd value is -26.74. This measure is very difficult, since the flux difference between the Sun and Capella (one of the bright stars he used) is roughly 50 billion times.[Luigi Fontana]. (2015). Stelle da Record. 3B Editore. This work was pivotal for astrophysics - leading to the discovery that star's brightness varies wildly among different stars, and also that the Sun is brighter than the vast majority of nearby stars. The lunar crater Z√∂llner is named in his honor. Spiritualism Henry Slade with Z√∂llner. Z√∂llner first became interested in spiritualism in 1875 when he visited the scientist William Crookes in England. Z√∂llner wanted a physical scientific explanation for the phenomena and came to the conclusion that physics of a four-dimensional space may explain spiritualism. Z√∂llner attempted to demonstrate that spirits are four-dimensional and set up his own s√©ance experiments with the medium Henry Slade which involved slate-writing, tying knots on string, recovering coins from sealed boxes and the interlinking of two wooden rings.Camp, Lyon Sprague De. (1983). The Fringe of the Unknown. Prometheus Books. p. 156. Turner, J. C; Griend, P van de. (1996). History and Science of Knots. World Scientific Publishing. pp. 217-218. These experiments occurred in November and December 1877 at Z√∂llner's home in Leipzig. He invited the scientists Wilhelm Eduard Weber, Gustav Fechner, Wilhelm Scheibner and Wilhelm Wundt to some of the sittings.Treitel, Corinna. (2004). A Science for the Soul: Occultism and the Genesis of the German Modern. The Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 3-12. The experiments were recorded by Z√∂llner in a book titled Transcendental Physics in 1878. According to Z√∂llner some of the experiments were a success.Stein, Gordon. (1996). The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. p. 703. \\"Slade succeeded only on tests that allowed easy trickery, such as producing knots in cords that had their ends tied together and the knot sealed, putting wooden rings on a table leg, and removing coins from sealed boxes. He failed utterly on tests that did not permit deception. He was unable to reverse the spirals of snail shells. He could not link two wooden rings, one of oak, the other of alder. He could not knot an endless ring cut from a bladder, or put a piece of candle inside a closed glass bulb. He failed to change the optical handedness of tartaric dex- tro to levo. These tests would have been easy to pass if Slade 's spirit controls had been able to take an object into the fourth dimension, then return it after making the required manipulations. Such successes would have created marvelous PPOs (permanent paranormal objects), difficult for skeptics to explain. Z√∂llner wrote an entire book in praise of Slade. Titled Transcendental Physics (1878), it was partly translated into English in 1880 by spiritualist Charles Carleton Massey. The book is a classic of childlike gullibility by a scientist incapable of devising adequate controls for testing paranormal powers.\\" However, critics have suggested that the medium Henry Slade was a fraud who performed trickery in the experiments.Baker, Robert A. (1996). Hidden Memories: Voices and Visions from Within. Prometheus Books. p. 233. \\"Unfortunately, Z√∂llner became enraptured by the antics of the medium Dr. Henry Slade. Slade, a master prestidigitator and slate writer, was exposed by Professor Lankester as well as by Henry Sidgwick, Edmund Gurney, and W. B. Carpenter.\\"Brock, William Hodson. (2008). William Crookes (1832-1919) and the Commercialization of Science. Ashgate. p. 174. Wilhelm Wundt who attended one of the s√©ances, claimed that the conditions and controls were unsatisfactory. He also found the German grammatical errors on the slates suspicious as Slade was an English speaker. Slade failed the experiment regarding the interlinking of two wooden rings. Instead, it was discovered that the two rings were passed onto a table leg. This impressed Z√∂llner but magicians noted that such a feat is easily explainable by trick methods.Mulholland, John. (1938). Beware Familiar Spirits. C. Scribner's Sons. pp. 111-112. In 1879, Hermann Ulrici brought Zollner's experiments to the attention of scientists in Germany by describing them in an academic journal. This caused a heated controversy. Wundt published a rejoinder to Ulrici, denouncing the experiments and spiritualism as non-scientific. Enraged, Z√∂llner attacked Wundt and threatened him with a lawsuit. Z√∂llner went as far as claiming that Wundt was possessed by evil spirits.Kohls, N; Benedikter, R. The Origins of the Modern Concept of \\"Neuroscience\\". In James J. Giordano, Bert Gordijn. (2010). Scientific and Philosophical Perspectives in Neuroethics. Cambridge University Press. pp. 44-48. George Stuart Fullerton, the secretary of the Seybert Commission, claimed that Z√∂llner had an \\"unsound mind\\" at the time of the experiments.\\"The Slade-Zoellner Investigation\\". Seybert Commission.Jastrow, Joseph. (1889). The Psychology of Spiritualism. Popular Science. pp. 721-732 Carl Willmann, an inventor of magical apparatus, strongly suspected that Slade had cheated. In the case of sealed slates, he suggested they could have easily been opened by a thin wire.Evans, Henry R. (1906). The Old and New Magic. The Open Court Publishing Company. p. 24 Psychical researcher Hereward Carrington in his book The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism (1907) revealed fraudulent methods (with diagrams of the rope tricks) that Slade may have utilized in the experiments.Carrington, Hereward. (1907). The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism. Herbert B. Turner & Co. pp. 19-47Carrington, Hereward. (1931). The Story of Psychic Science. Ives Washburn Publisher. p. 342. \\"Z√∂llner's experiments, however, rest under the gravest suspicion, since we know that Slade was a notorious trickster, and it is highly probable that Z√∂llner was duped. I have devoted a lengthy chapter in my Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism to a detailed analysis of these tests, and therein showed how they might have been due to fraud, and how they could be duplicated by such means.\\" Psychologist Ray Hyman has noted: :In the case of Z√∂llner's investigations of Slade, not only do we know that Slade was exposed before and after his sessions with Z√∂llner, but also there is ample reason to raise questions about the adequacy of the investigation. Carrington (1907), Podmore (1963), and Mrs. Sidgwick (1886-87) are among a number of critics who have uncovered flaws and loopholes in Z√∂llner's sittings with Slade.Hyman, Ray. (1989). The Elusive Quarry: A Scientific Appraisal of Psychical Research. Prometheus Books. p. 209. Science writer Martin Gardner also exposed the tricks of Slade with diagrams and commented that \\"Z√∂llner did some good work in spectrum analysis, but he was supremely ignorant of conjuring methods. As a consequence he was badly taken in, I'm afraid, by Henry Slade.\\"Gardner, Martin. (1991). The Unexpected Hanging and Other Mathematical Diversions. University of Chicago Press. pp. 70-75.

It is especially known for its fleet of commercial rental trucks. Ryder specializes in fleet management, supply chain management, and dedicated transportation management. It also offers full-service leasing, rental and maintenance, used vehicle sales, transportation management, professional drivers, e-commerce fulfillment, and last-mile delivery services. Ryder operates in North America, and the United Kingdom. It has its headquarters in Miami, Florida within Miami-Dade County.  History  Ryder was founded in Miami, Florida in 1933 by James Ryder as a concrete hauling company with one truck, a 1931 Model \\"A\\" Ford. In 1938, Ryder signed a five-truck lease deal with Champagne Velvet Beer, increasing Ryder's fleet to 20 trucks. By the following year, the fleet grew to more than 50 trucks. This led to Ryder changing its focus from distribution to leasing. Ryder bought Great Southern Trucking Company in 1952. In 1955 Ryder System, Inc. was formed to combine Great Southern and Ryder Truck Rental. Ryder System went public in 1955. By the 1960s and 1970s, Ryder had expanded into the distribution and supply chain markets. James A. Ryder, founder and chairman, retired in 1978 and died in 1997. In 2008, Ryder acquired three regional competitors: Pollock NationaLease, Lily Transportation and Gator Leasing. In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Ryder for spending $0.96 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008‚Äì2010, instead getting $46 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $627 million. In 2013 Robert E. Sanchez became CEO and Chairman of the company. In April 2018, Ryder acquired Ohio-based MXD Group, an e-commerce fulfillment and last mile delivery provider with a network of 109 fulfillment centers across the United States and Canada. In May 2018, Ryder introduced RyderGyde, a commercial fleet management smartphone app for drivers and fleet managers to monitor and manage their fleets. The app allows customers to view the maintenance status of their vehicles, schedule maintenance appointments and compare fuel rates in real-time. Ryder opened a new logistics center in London, Ontario, Canada in January 2018. In November 2018 Ryder ordered 1,000 electric trucks to add to their fleet, the largest deal for electric trucks to date in the US. The company partnered with Fetch robotics to further automate three warehouse locations in Miami, Dallas and Chicago. The company announced the planned opening of two multi-client facilities in Perris, California and Fort Worth, Texas, while expanding an already existing Ryder warehouse in Douglassville, Pennsylvania. The three facilities were expected to be fully operational by May 2019. In May 2020 RyderShare was introduced as a collaborative logistics platform. In May 2020 the company began to expand its e-commerce network with the opening of a new facility in Philadelphia and adding FDA approval for food-grade service to two other facilities in Perris, California and Dallas, Texas. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, Ryder took several steps to work with customers to meet increased demand for warehousing and distribution of essential goods, and to support the flow of goods and services required to fight the pandemic.  Partnerships for advanced vehicle technologies  In December 2016 Ryder became the exclusive provider of maintenance and distribution for the hydrogen fuel cell, electric- drive truck of the Nikola Motor Company (NMC). At the end of May 2020 Ryder and Nikola decided to end their service partnership and consider other emerging opportunities in the commercial transportation industry. As of May 2018 Ryder was working with Tesla Inc. on the development of charging infrastructure for tractors-trailers which were pre-ordered by the company's fleets. The company is also considering the adoption of more electric vehicles when there is more evidence that the company will spend less on truck maintenance. The company is also examining electric engines in driving situations in which gasoline and diesel engines are less efficient. In 2018 Ryder reserved 500 Chanje Energy medium-duty electric panel vans for commercial truck rental and the ChoideLease fleet. In November 2018 FedEx announced it was adding 1,000 electric delivery vans to its fleet, buying 100 of them from Chanje Energy Inc, and leasing the additional 900 from Ryder Systems Inc. In August 2018 Ryder began to use ‚ÄúUber Central‚Äù, a unit of ‚ÄúUber for Business‚Äù to outsource the transportation of customers, drivers, and technicians to and from customer locations. Ryder is the exclusive maintenance provider for Workhorse's electric fleet in North America. Workhorse introduced the first fleet of all electric cargo vans in the US in the San Francisco Bay area in 2018. In January 2020 Ryder began a partnership with In-Charge Energy, Inc. and ABB, a provider of industrial automation and technology to provide electric vehicle charging to Ryder's customers. In June 2020 Ryder began a partnership with Turvo, a provider of collaborative logistics software to launch a digital platform to connect various pieces of the supply chain. Leadership Ryder appointed Scott Parker to be its new chief financial officer, taking over from Art Garcia, who retired as of April 5, 2019. In August 2019 Ryder named John Diez as president of its fleet business, succeeding Dennis Cooke.  Business  Ryder divides its business into three segments: Fleet Management Solutions, Supply Chain Solutions, and Dedicated Transportation Solutions. As of December 31, 2019, the total company revenue was $8.93 billion, with profits before income taxes of $42.27 million. The number of full-time employees, as of December 2019 was 39,900 globally, with 38,600 in North America and 1,300 in Europe. The company employs approximately 9,500 drivers, 6,300 technicians and have approximately 25,600 hourly employees in the U.S. About 4,300 of those are organized by labor unions.  Fleet management  Ryder's fleet management business is its largest business segment, accounting for 61% of the company's total revenue of $2.3 billion, or $1.4 billion for Q4 of 2019. This arm of the business does contract-based full-service leasing, contract maintenance, commercial rental and fleet support services. Under full-service leasing Ryder owns and maintains the trucks and the customer decides where they go. In contract maintenance Ryder just takes care of the trucks. Commercial rentals are the white Ryder trucks which the contract customers can rent on a temporary basis. Ryder grew its North American rental fleet to nearly 30,000 vehicles in 2010 and 2011 raising the percentage of model year 2010 or newer vehicles in the fleet to more than 40 percent. Support services consist of insurance, vehicle permits, and fuel. By the end of 2019 the company owned or leased 213,800 vehicles. In April 2011 Ryder bought B.I.T. Leasing, from Hayward, California. Also in 2011 it acquired the full service leasing and rental business of Carmenita Leasing, Inc., located in Santa Fe Springs, California, and the full service lease, contract maintenance, commercial rental and dedicated contract carriage business, The Scully Companies, Inc., based in Fontana, California. As of January 2020, Ryder was the largest truck supplier in the US, with a fleet of 2,500 based in Florida alone. Launched in April 2018, the company operates a peer-to-peer truck-sharing platform, COOP, that allows owners of commercial vehicles to rent unused trucks and trailers to businesses. The program expanded to Florida in January 2019 and further expanded in Texas in February 2020. As of December 31, 2019, Ryder owned or leased 213,800 vehicles. Ryder sells used trucks, with over 5,000 available for sale.  Supply chain  Ryder' supply chain operations accounted for 28% of its revenue for a total of $649 million for Q4 2019. This business consists of management of a customer's supply chain. Ryder managed over 50 million square feet (4,645,152 m2) of warehouse space on December 31, 2019. In December 2010 Ryder bought TLC, a supply chain services company based in Holland, Michigan.  Dedicated Transportation Solutions  Ryder Dedicated Transportation Solutions accounted for 15% of its revenue for a total of $346 million for Q4 2019. This arm of the business conducts both leasing and supply chain management. In 2013, Ryder launched a new name and identity for this program called Ryder Dedicated. The company expanded its Last Mile Delivery service for bulky and large goods to 11 markets in North America. In February 2019 Ryder launched a program for e-commerce that allows manufacturers to ship directly to consumers instead of using third-party shipping for small to large products. In May 2020 the company added food-grade capabilities to its e-commerce service.  Rental trucks  Ryder launched a consumer truck-rental operation in 1968 with 1,000 trucks and vans. These were the yellow trucks known as \\"one-ways\\" and available for the public to rent from filling stations and other automotive- service locations. In 1996, Ryder decided to focus on commercial truck rental and leasing, and exited the \\"one-way\\" business arena; which it was purchased by equity firm Questor Partners Fund LP, who later sold it to Budget Truck Rental in June 1998. In 2017 Ryder launched electric truck rentals in California, and Chicago, Illinois. The trucks were equipped with 70kWh batteries, which had an estimated range of 100 miles, just under the smallest battery in a Tesla S model.

The islands can be located anywhere, so long as they are not occupied and not within the jurisdiction of another government. It also empowers the President of the United States to use the military to protect such interests and establishes the criminal jurisdiction of the United States in these territories. Background Guano importation was a major business, as this 1873 advertisement attests. In the 1840s, guano came to be prized as a source of saltpeter for gunpowder as well as an agricultural fertilizer. The United States began importing it in 1843 through New York. By the early 1850s, the U.K. imported over 200,000 tons a year, and U.S. imports totaled about 760,000 tons.Smil, Vaclav. (2004). Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production. Massachusetts: The MIT Press, pp.42. The \\"guano mania\\" of the 1850s led to high prices in an oligopolistic market, attempts of price control, fear of resource exhaustion, and eventually the enactment of the Guano Islands Act 1856 in August 1856.Skaggs & Wines, R. A. (1985). Fertilizer in America. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, pp. 54-70. The Act enables U.S. citizens to take possession of unclaimed islands containing guano for the U.S., and empowered the President to send in armed military to intervene. This encouraged American entrepreneurs to search and exploit new deposits on tiny islands and reefs in the Caribbean and in the Pacific. This was the beginning of the concept of insular areas in U.S. territories. Up to this time, any territory acquired by the U.S. was considered to have become an integral part of the country unless changed by treaty and eventually to have the opportunity to become a state of the Union. With insular areas, land could be held by the federal government without the prospect of its ever becoming a state in the Union. Under the act the US gained control of 94 islands around. By 1903, 66 of these islands were recognized as territories of the US.[ https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ecology_of_Agroecosystems.html?id=AFRQSuQGHiIC The Ecology of Agroecosystems] p149 Wording Criminal jurisdiction  Section 6 provides that criminal acts on or adjacent to these territories \\"shall be deemed committed on the high seas, on board a merchant ship or vessel belonging to the United States; and shall be punished according to the laws of the United States relating to such ships or vessels and offenses on the high seas ...\\"Guano Islands Act ( The provision was considered and ruled constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in Jones v. United States, . Result The Act continues to be part of the law of the United States. The most recent Guano Islands Act claim was made to Navassa Island. However, the claim was denied because an American court ruled the island was already under American jurisdiction (a claim Haiti disputes). Claims More than 100 islands have been claimed for the United States under the Guano Islands Act, but most claims have been withdrawn. The Act specifically allows the islands to be considered possessions of the U.S. The Act does not specify what the status of the territory is after it is abandoned by private U.S. interests or the guano is exhausted, creating neither obligation to nor prohibition of retaining possession. The islands still claimed by the United States under the Act are: *Baker Island *Howland Island *Jarvis Island *Johnston Atoll *Kingman Reef/Danger Rock *Midway Atoll; Kindle location 2856 of 15675. *Navassa Island (claimed by Haiti) *Bajo Nuevo Bank (disputed with Colombia) *Serranilla Bank (disputed with Colombia) *Swains Island (part of American Samoa; no evidence that guano was mined) Disputed claims The claim by the United States under the Guano Act of 1856 to a number of islands are subject to territorial disputes. To cement the U.S. claim to Navassa Island against Haiti, President James Buchanan issued Executive Orders establishing United States territorial jurisdiction beyond just the Guano Act of 1856. The United States Supreme Court in 1890 ruled the Guano Act constitutional; and, citing the actions of the Executive Branch, amongst other points in law, determined Navassa Island as pertaining to the United States.Jones v. United States, 137 U. S. 202 (1890). Control of Navassa Island was transferred by the Department of the Interior to the Director of the Office of Insular Affairs under Order No. 3205 on January 16, 1997. Both the Department of the Interior and Insular Affairs would later grant administration responsibilities to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service under Order No. 3210 on December 3, 1999. Order No 3210 also established a territorial sea boundary for the United States around Navassa Island. Multiple countries have claimed ownership of Serranilla Bank and the Bajo Nuevo Bank. Bajo Nuevo Bank is the subject of conflicting claims made by a number of sovereign states. In 1899, a claim was made on Fox Island, Quebec, an island located south of Harrington Harbour in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.\\"Guano is Back‚Ä¶\\". McGill University, March 20, 2017. In 1964, Leicester Hemingway, brother of author Ernest Hemingway, attempted to establish a country (or more appropriately, a micronation) dubbed the Republic of New Atlantis, on an 8 x 30 foot bamboo raft anchored with an engine block outside the territorial waters of Jamaica, using the Guano Islands Act as part of a claim to sovereignty. His apparent intention was to use the new country as the headquarters for his own International Marine Research Society, with which he planned to further marine research, as well as to protect Jamaican fishing. Neither the US nor Jamaica recognized his claim before the raft was destroyed in a storm in 1966.

Popular forms of memorials include landmark objects or works of art such as sculptures, statues or fountains and parks. Types The most common type of memorial is the gravestone or the memorial plaque. Also common are war memorials commemorating those who have died in wars. Memorials in the form of a cross are called intending crosses. Online memorials are often created on websites and social media to allow digital access as an alternative to physical memorials which may not be feasible or easily accessible. When somebody has died, the family may request that a memorial gift (usually money) be given to a designated charity, or that a tree be planted in memory of the person. Those temporary or makeshift memorials are also called grassroots memorials.Grassroots Memorials: The Politics of Memorializing Traumatic Death, eds Peter Jan Margry and Cristina S√°nchez- Carretero (New York: Berghahn, 2011). Sometimes, when a high school student has died, the memorials are placed in the form of a scholarship, to be awarded to high-achieving students in future years.

This version is the most common version and often incorrectly cited in textbooks. The Yerkes‚ÄìDodson law is an empirical relationship between pressure and performance, originally developed by psychologists Robert M. Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson in 1908. The law dictates that performance increases with physiological or mental arousal, but only up to a point. When levels of arousal become too high, performance decreases. The process is often illustrated graphically as a bell-shaped curve which increases and then decreases with higher levels of arousal. The original paper (a study of Japanese dancing mice) was only referenced ten times over the next half century, yet in four of the citing articles, these findings were described as a psychological \\"law.\\"  Levels of arousal  Research has found that different tasks require different levels of arousal for optimal performance. For example, difficult or intellectually demanding tasks may require a lower level of arousal (to facilitate concentration), whereas tasks demanding stamina or persistence may be performed better with higher levels of arousal (to increase motivation). Because of task differences, the shape of the curve can be highly variable. For simple or well-learned tasks, the relationship is monotonic, and performance improves as arousal increases. For complex, unfamiliar, or difficult tasks, the relationship between arousal and performance reverses after a point, and performance thereafter declines as arousal increases. The effect of task difficulty led to the hypothesis that the Yerkes‚ÄìDodson Law can be decomposed into two distinct factors as in a bathtub curve. The upward part of the inverted U can be thought of as the energizing effect of arousal. The downward part is caused by negative effects of arousal (or stress) on cognitive processes like attention (e.g., \\"tunnel vision\\"), memory, and problem-solving. There has been research indicating that the correlation suggested by Yerkes and Dodson exists (such as that of Broadhurst (1959), Duffy (1957), and Anderson (1988)), but a cause of the correlation has not yet successfully been established (Anderson, Revelle, & Lynch, 1989). Relationship to glucocorticoids A 2007 review of the effects of stress hormones (glucocorticoids, GC) and human cognition revealed that memory performance vs. circulating levels of glucocorticoids does manifest an upside down U shaped curve and the authors noted the resemblance to the Yerkes‚ÄìDodson curve. For example, long-term potentiation (LTP) (the process of forming long-term memories) is optimal when glucocorticoid levels are mildly elevated whereas significant decreases of LTP are observed after adrenalectomy (low GC state) or after exogenous glucocorticoid administration (high GC state). This review also revealed that in order for a situation to induce a stress response, it has to be interpreted as one or more of the following: * novel * unpredictable * not controllable by the individual * a social evaluative threat (negative social evaluation possibly leading to social rejection). It has also been shown that elevated levels of glucocorticoids enhance memory for emotionally arousing events but lead more often than not to poor memory for material unrelated to the source of stress/emotional arousal.

It is noted for its scenic beauty, in particular for its unique Cambrian sandstone rock formations and tributary canyons. The cliffs, some over 100 feet (30 m) high, and side canyons are closed to the public to protect sensitive ecological features. The viewing of the rock formations by water is a popular tourist attraction in the area. The nearby city of Wisconsin Dells is the center of summer tourist activity, much of it in the form of the theme parks unrelated to the river features. The Dells of the Wisconsin River is owned by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. It was established as a State Natural Area in 1994. Description and formation Rock formation on the Wisconsin Dells The Dells was formed during the last ice age approximately 15,000 years ago, although the rock itself is much older, dating from the Cambrian approximately 510‚Äì520 million years ago when the area of Wisconsin was at the bottom of a shallow sea. Approximately 19,000 years ago, the Dells was at the extreme western margin of the continental glacier. However, the Dells itself was never covered by glacial ice sheets ‚Äì it was part of the large Driftless Area that was bypassed by the ice. The melting of the glacier formed Glacial Lake Wisconsin, a lake about the size of Great Salt Lake in Utah and as deep as 150 feet (45 m). The lake was held back by an ice dam of the remaining glacier. The eventual bursting of the ice dam unleashed a catastrophic flood, dropping the lake's depth to 50 feet (15 m) and cutting deep, narrow gorges and unusual rock formations into the sandstone seen today. Ecosystem The area of the Dells provides a mixture of plant communities, including northern and southern oak and pine forests, as well as oak savanna, moist cliffs, and dry cliffs. The cliffs provide unique niches for plants, some of which are very rare in Wisconsin, including: *Cliff cudweed (Gnaphalium obtusifolium var saxicola ), which is known in only two places on Earth ‚Äì in the Dells and in the Kickapoo Valley, grows on protected rock ledges. *Lapland azalea (Rhododendron lapponicum) *Round-stemmed false foxglove (Agalinis gattingeri) *Maidenhair spleenwort (Asplenium trichomanes) *Fragrant fern (Dryopteris fragrans). Among the rare animals in the dell are six dragonfly species, including the Royal river cruiser (Macromia taeniolata), six rare mussels and numerous species of birds. Cultural history H.H. Bennett's photo of Stand Rock The cultural history of the area stretches back several thousand years, from early Paleo- Indian people to the more recent Native American peoples, such as Ho-Chunk, Sac, and Menominee, who left behind effigy and burial mounds, camps and village sites, garden beds, and rock art. The Dells were made famous in 1886 by the photographer H. H. Bennett, who took the first stop-action photo of his son jumping onto Stand Rock. Protected status The area is now owned by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and was designated a State Natural Area in 1994.

It has a single underground island platform. The station is located in the Northeast quadrant of the city under the western end of Union Station, the main train station for Washington, where connections can be made to Amtrak intercity trains, as well as Virginia Railway Express and MARC commuter rail trains to suburbs in Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia. The station was originally named \\"Union Station-Visitor Center\\" but when the National Visitor Center there failed, it was renamed Union Station. One or two pylons still read \\"Union Station-Visitor Center\\", and a number of older stations still display this name on signage. Service began on March 27, 1976 with the opening of the Red Line. It is the busiest station in the Metrorail system, averaging 29,197 passengers per weekday as of May 2017. History After groundbreaking in 1969, the station opened as Union Station-Visitor Center (National Visitor Center) on March 27, 1976 with the rest of the Red Line. Union Station had dirtier walls than most stations as trains brought in soot from diesel engines in Union Station, resulting in a dimmer station. In March 2017, it was announced the station would be painted white at a cost of $75,000‚Äì$100,000. This sparked a debate amongst riders, as preservationists did not like the irrevocable act of painting the brutalist cavern, while other riders liked the brightened stations and cleaner feels that resulted from the white paint. Future improvements The street-level entrance on First street, built into the existing retaining wall, will be rebuilt to ADA-compliant standards, adding more space for extra fare gates and connections between the platform and track level Station layout Like the other original stations of the Metro, Union Station sports coffered vaults of concrete in its ceiling.Construction: Tunnels One end of the station has a lowered \\"box\\" cut out of the ceiling. The station features an island platform with two exits, one mid-platform mezzanine leading to the main hall of Union Station and Massachusetts Avenue and the one northern exit leading to 1st Street NE and to the main boarding concourse.

It is located on the same embankment as the Amtrak tracks into Union Station. It serves the Red Line, and is situated between Union Station and Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood stations. NoMa‚ÄìGallaudet U is located near the intersection of New York Avenue and Florida Avenue in Northeast Washington, D.C. The station is within the NoMa neighborhood, which is both residential and commercial, and the station itself is in a commercial district on Florida Avenue. The station opened under the name New York Ave‚ÄìFlorida Ave‚ÄìGallaudet U on November 20, 2004, as both the system's first infill station and as the first to be built with a mix of public and private funds. Additionally, a portion of the Metropolitan Branch Trail was completed as part of its construction. History The station was not originally built with the rest of the Red Line; the segment of the Red Line containing the site of this station opened in 1976. By 1996, however, the idea of a Metro station at New York Avenue was being proposed as part of greater improvements of New York Avenue between Downtown Washington at the Maryland state line. In February 1999, the major property owners in the vicinity of the proposed station agreed in principle to contribute approximately $25 million in private financing for the project. The money would be collected from all commercial property owners within radius of the proposed station by being charged special tax assessments. With an estimated cost of $84 million to complete in October 2000, the federal government approved $25 million for its construction. The remaining costs would be split with $34 million coming from the District and $25 million coming from special tax assessments for the surrounding commercial properties. With funding secured, physical construction could commence. The groundbreaking for the station occurred on December 16, 2000, with Washington mayor Anthony A. Williams and D.C.'s Congressional Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton present for the festivities. In May 2002, Metro awarded a design-build contract to the joint venture of Lane Construction/Slattery/Skanska for the design and construction of the station. Since it was constructed along an existing line, its construction resulted in some delay for trains traveling on the Red Line during the construction of a double crossover switch. While still under construction in January 2004, the station name was changed from New York Ave to New York Ave‚ÄìFlorida Ave‚ÄìGallaudet U. The change was made to reflect its location near both Florida Avenue and Gallaudet University. On November 20, 2004, the station opened as the 84th station, and first infill station, on the Metro system. The final cost was $103.7 million with the federal government and private land owners each contributing $25 million and the D.C. government contributing $53.7 million. Its construction has served as a catalyst for new development and redevelopment of the NoMa neighborhood. The station was renamed to NoMa‚ÄìGallaudet U on November 3, 2011, and formally christened with the new name on June 13, 2012. Future Improvements There are currently plans to construct a pedestrian tunnel from the north entrance under the embankment to the east side of the tracks, and construction is scheduled to begin in 2023. Station layout A Red Line train made up of Breda cars leaving the station NoMa‚ÄìGallaudet U is located near the intersection of New York Avenue and Florida Avenue in Northeast Washington. The station is within and named for the NoMa neighborhood, which is both residential and commercial, and the station itself is in a commercial district on Florida Avenue. Its design differs from that of previous stations and is indicative of the lessons learned by Metro over its years of operation in several respects. Its canopy consists of white-painted, steel plate trusses and glass sheathing rather than concrete. Instead of having a single elevator as found at older stations, it contains two. This was done so if an elevator breaks down, service is provided to the station without having to offer shuttle service from another station. The station also provides ten racks and 28 lockers for bicycle users, carsharing with Zipcar and connections to several Metrobus routes. Public Art The station is notable for its artistic elements incorporated into the station design as part of MetroArts, Metro's Art in Transit Program. Journeys Created by sculptor Barbara Grygutis, The 2nd Street entrance contains a tall aluminum sculpture of a leaf from a scarlet oak. On each side of the sculpture is a poem entitled \\"Journeys\\" composed by Dolores Kendrick, Washington's poet laureate. The poem reads: \\"Go slowly in taking the steps, and fast when counting stars.\\" Grygutis also created the steel fence outside the station studded with glass leaves of various hues. Its design was inspired by Washington's dense tree canopy in addition to the scarlet oak being the official tree of the District.

Large beef feedlots are called concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO) in the United States and intensive livestock operations (ILOs) or confined feeding operations (CFO) in Canada. They may contain thousands of animals in an array of pens. Purpose and regulation The basic principle of the feedlot is to increase the amount of muscle gained by each animal as quickly as possible; if animals are kept in confined quarters rather than being allowed to range freely over grassland, they will gain weight more quickly and efficiently with the added benefit of economies of scale. Most feedlots require some type of governmental approval to operate, which generally consists of an agricultural site permit. Feedlots also would have an environmental plan in place to deal with the large amount of waste that is generated from the numerous livestock housed. The environmental farm plan is set in place to raise awareness about the environment and covers 23 different aspects around the farm that may affect the environment.https://www.ontariosoilcrop.org/oscia-programs/workshops- webinars/environmental-farm-plan/ The Environmental Protection Agency has authority under the Clean Water Act to regulate all animal feeding operations in the United States. This authority is delegated to individual states in some cases.2008 Final CAFO Rule, USEPA, Office of Water, 2009. In Canada, regulation of feedlots is shared between all levels of government. Certain provinces are required by law to have a nutrient management plan, which looks at everything the farm is going to feed to their animals, down to the minerals.http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/nm/regs/nmpro/nmpro07-12.htm New farms are required to complete and obtain a license under the livestock operations act, which looks at proper manure storage as well as proper distance away from other farms or dwellings.https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/services/services_renderer.557.Licensing_of_Livestock_Operation.html A mandatory RFID tag is required in every animal that passes through a Canadian feedlot, these are called CCIA tags (Canadian Cattle Identification Agency)https://www.canadaid.ca/ which is controlled by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency CFIA.https://inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial- animals/traceability/regulatory-update-4/eng/1557984507732/1557984507989 In Australia this role is handled by the National Feedlot Accreditation Scheme (NFAS). Scheduling and diet The cattle industry works in sequence with one another, prior to entering a feedlot, young calves are born typically in the spring where they spend the summer with their mothers in a pasture or on rangeland. These producers are called cow-calf operations, and are essential for feedlot operations to run.http://www.cattle.ca/cca-resources/animal- care/cow-calf-production/ Once the young calves reach a weight between they are rounded up and either sold directly to feedlots, or sent to cattle auctions for feedlots to bid on them. Once transferred to a feedlot, they are housed and looked after for the next six to eight months where they are fed a total mixed ration (TMR)https://extension.umn.edu/dairy-nutrition/feeding- total-mixed-rations to start the journey of their further growth away from their mothers. Typically these TMR's consist of forage, grains, minerals, and supplements to benefit the animals health and to maximize feed efficiency. These rations are also known to contain various other forms of feed such as a specialized animal feed which consists of corn, corn byproducts (some of which is derived from ethanol and high fructose corn syrup production), milo, barley, and various grains. Some rations may also contain roughage such as corn stalks, straw, sorghum, or other hay, cottonseed meal, premixes which may contain but not limited to antibiotics, fermentation products, micro & macro minerals and other essential ingredients that are purchased from mineral companies, usually in sacked form, for blending into commercial rations. Many feed companies are able to be prescribed a drug to be added into a farms feed if required by a vet. Farmers generally work with nutritionists who aid in the formulation of these rations to ensure their animals are getting the recommended levels of minerals and vitamins, but also to make sure the animals are not wasting feed in their manure.R. A. Zinn University of California, Davis A Guide to Feed Mixing In the American northwest and Canada, barley, low grade durum wheat, chick peas (garbanzo beans), oats and occasionally potatoes are used as feed. In a typical feedlot, a cow's diet is roughly 62% roughage, 31% grain, 5% supplements (minerals and vitamins), and 2% premix. High-grain diets lower the pH in the animals' rumen. Due to the stressors of these conditions, and due to some illnesses, it may be necessary to give the animals antibiotics on occasion.Friend, Catherine. The Compassionate Carnivore: Or, How to Keep Animals Happy, save Old MacDonald's Farm, Reduce Your Hoofprint, and Still Eat Meat. Philadelphia, PA: Da Capo Lifelong, 2008. Feedlot diets are high in protein, to encourage growth of muscle mass and the distribution of some fat (known as marbling in butchered meat). The marbling is desirable to consumers, as it contributes to flavour and tenderness. These animals may gain an additional 400-600 pounds (180 kg) during its approximate 200 days in the feedlot,https://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/4h9457/$file/SteerFeedingGuidelines.pdf?OpenElement depending on its entrance weight into the lot, and also how well the animal gains muscle. Once cattle are fattened up to their finished weight, the fed cattle are transported to a slaughterhouse. Animal Health A feedlot is highly dependent on the health of its livestock, as disease can have a great impact on the animals, and controlling sickness can be difficult with numerous animals living together. Many feedlots will have an entrance protocol in which new animals entering the lot are given vaccines to protect them against potential sickness that may arise in the first few weeks in the feedlot. These entrance protocols are usually discussed and created with the farm's veterinarian, as there are numerous factors that can impact the health of feedlot cattle.http://www.cattle.ca/cca-resources/animal-care/feedlot-health- management/ One challenging but crucial role on a feedlot is to identify any sick cattle, and treat them in order to rebound them back to health. Knowing when an animal is sick is sometimes difficult as cattle are prey animals and will try and hide their weakness from potential threats. A sick animal will generally look gaunt, may have a snotty nose and/or dry nose, and will have droopy ears, catching these symptoms early may be the key to successfully treating an animal. The best indicator of health is the body temperature of a cow, but this is not always possible when looking over many animals per day.http://www.thecattlesite.com/articles/2038/identifying-sick-or-injured- cattle/ Waste recycling There are a few common methods of waste recycling within feedlots, with the most common being spreading it back on the cropping fields used to feed the livestock. Generally, feedlots provide bedding for their animals such as straw, sawdust, wood shavings, or other byproducts from crops (soybean chaff, corn chaff), which are then mixed in with the manure as the livestock use the bedding. Once the bedding has outlasted its use, the manure is either spread directly on the fields or stock piled to breakdown and begin composting. A less common type of recycling in the feedlot industry is liquid manure which is where minimal bedding is found in the manure, so it stays a liquid and is then spread on the fields in a liquid form. Increasing numbers of cattle feedlots are utilizing out-wintering pads made of timber residue bedding in their operations.Augustenborg, C.A.; O.T. Carton; R.P.O. Schulte; and I. H. Suffet (2008)'Silage Dry-Matter Yield and Nitrogen Response following Land Application of Spent Timber Residue from Out-Wintering Pads to Irish Grassland',Communications in Soil Science and Plant Analysis,39:7,1122‚Äî1137. Nutrients are retained in the waste timber and livestock effluent and can be recycled within the farm system after use. Biogas plants are also able to use livestock manure to create biofuels, but most farmers cannot afford to lose their valuable nutrients found in the manure which they use to spread on their fields.http://biomassproducer.com.au/producing-biomass/biomass-types/animal- waste/feedlot-waste/#.Xdr5GZNKiu4 History Cattle feeding on a large scale was first introduced in the early 60's, when a demand for higher quality beef in large quantities emerged.https://www.cattlefeeders.ca/industry- overview/history/ Farmers started becoming familiar with the finishing of beef, but also showed interest in various other aspects associated with the feedlot such as soil health, crop management, and how to manage labour costs. From the early 60's to the 90's feeding beef cattle in the feedlot style showed immense growth, and even today the feedlot industry is constantly being upgraded with new knowledge and science as well as technology. In the early 20th century, feeder operations were separate from all other related operations and feedlots were non-existent.Clark, Georgia and Jaime Malaga. 2005. ‚ÄúWest Texas Feedlots: Reality and Perspectives‚Äù. Texas Tech University. They appeared in the 1950s and 1960s as a result of hybrid grains and irrigation techniques; the ensuing larger grain crops led to abundant grain harvests. It was suddenly possible to feed large numbers of cattle in one location and so, to cut transportation costs, grain farms and feedlot locations merged. Cattle were no longer sent from all across the southern states to places like California, where large slaughter houses were located. In the 1980s, meat packers followed the path of feedlots and are now located close by to them as well. Marketing There are many methods used to sell cattle to meat packers. Spot, or cash, marketing is the traditional and most commonly used method. Prices are influenced by current supply & demand and are determined by live weight or per head. Similar to this is forward contracting, in which prices are determined the same way but are not directly influenced by market demand fluctuations. Forward contracts determine the selling price between the two parties negotiating for a set amount of time. However, this method is the least used because it requires some knowledge of production costs and the willingness of both sides to take a risk in the futures market. Another method, formula pricing, is becoming the most popular process, as it more accurately represents the value of meat received by the packer. This requires trust between the packers and feedlots though, and is under criticism from the feedlots because the amount paid to the feedlots is determined by the packers‚Äô assessment of the meat received. Finally, live- or carcass-weight based formula pricing is most common. Other types include grid pricing and boxed beef pricing. The most controversial marketing method stems from the vertical integration of packer-owned feedlots, which still represents less than 10% of all methods, but has been growing over the years.Ward, Clement. 2005. ‚ÄúCaptive Supply Price Relationships and Impacts.‚Äù Oklahoma State University Oklahoma Extension Service. Bull. No. F-598. Canadian beef is well known worldwide for its high quality, and continues to thrive with this reputation. Canadian beef has market access to many foreign countries all across the world, which is what maintains a relatively healthy industry for Canadian beef farmers.http://www.cattle.ca/market-access/marketing-beef/ Controversies and alternatives This is a major controversy towards farms today as consumers have shown their concern for the welfare of these animals. For farmers, the prioritization of the well-being and care of their animals comes before many other things on the farm.https://www.thefarmersdaughterusa.com/2016/10/animal-farmers-talk-animal- welfare.html Another controversial topic within the feedlot industry is the diet of these animals, and the different ingredients within the ration. Often grain or corn will be added into the mix of feed which is designed to provide energy and protein to the growing animals, and is often seen as a negative aspect, but close monitoring of the animals by the farmer ensures that the perfect amount of grain is being introduced into the feed of the animals in order to maintain a healthy and efficient growing period.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/05/010511074623.htm Too much grain in the diet can cause cattle to have issues such as bloating, diarrhea and digestive discomfort, which is why close monitoring of the animals, as well as working with ruminant nutritionists is very important for farmers.http://extensionpublications.unl.edu/assets/html/g2018/build/g2018.htm The alternative to feedlots is to allow cattle to graze on grass throughout their lives, but this is not efficient and can be very challenging. For Canada and the Northern USA, year round grazing is not possible due to the severe winter weather conditions. Though controlled grazing methods of this sort necessitate higher beef prices and the cattle take longer to reach market weight.https://www.trulocal.ca/blog/title/whats-the-beef-the-pros-and-cons-of- grass-fed-vs-grain-fed/id/133 See also *Intensive fish farm *Livestock *Managed intensive grazing *Temple Grandin References Further reading * Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture ‚Äì Feedlots External links *Canada Beef Inc *Texas Cattle Feeders Association *Clean Water and Factory Farms ‚Äì Inhumane Treatment of Farm Animals *Australian Lot Feeders Association *\\"Power Steer\\", Michael Pollan, New York Times, March 31, 2002 *Broken Bow South Lot, possibly the world's largest capacity Category:Livestock Category:Meat industry Category:Intensive farming Category:Cruelty to animals ","title":"Feedlot"},{"id":"560810","text":"Glacial Lake Wisconsin was a prehistoric proglacial lake that existed from approximately 18,000 to 14,000 years ago, at the end of the last ice age, in the central part of present-day Wisconsin in the United States. Formation and demise Before the last glacier, a somewhat different Wisconsin River drained the north-central part of the state, running around the east end of the Baraboo Hills. Around 18,000 years ago, the Green Bay lobe of the Laurentide ice sheet crept in from the east, butting up against the Baraboo Hills. With that outlet closed, the water backed up, filling the basin to the north and west, forming Glacial Lake Wisconsin. The water rose to as deep as 160 feet, with a surface area eight times the size of modern Lake Winnebago, a big cold lake stretching north to the site of Wisconsin Rapids. Eventually it found a new outlet, flowing west to the Mississippi via the east fork of the Black River near City Point. With water flowing out again, the lake stopped rising. Islands poked up out of this icy lake, some of which remain today as the sandstone bluffs of central Wisconsin - Mill Bluff and Roche-a-Cri, for example. The lake existed for thousands of years, with storms and ice scouring sand off those bluffs. Streams from the glacier to the north and east also carried in sand and silt which settled at the bottom of the lake, roughing in the flat sandy Central Plain that we see today when we follow I-90/94. About 14,000 years ago, as the climate warmed, the glacier began to retreat. The lake water reopened the path around the Baraboo Hills. Once the trickle began, it quickly melted a larger channel through the ice and became a torrent. In a catastrophic flood, most of the huge lake probably drained out the south end in no more than a few weeks - possibly a few days. Upstream, the current cut new channels through the lake-bottom sand. After removing the lake-bottom sand, it cut canyons through the weak Cambrian sandstone beneath, which had existed long before the lake, forming the Dells of the Wisconsin River, that are now largely beneath the high water created by damming the river. Boat tours today show the portions that remain above water. The Dells were carved by the torrent when Glacial Lake Wisconsin drained. This lake during the last glacier was probably not the only Glacial Lake Wisconsin. The Wisconsin river travels from nearly the Upper Peninsula over a 300 miles until it meets the Mississippi at Prairie du Chien. Earlier glaciers probably blocked the Wisconsin River, producing earlier glacial lakes in central Wisconsin like Lake DuBay. After Lake Dubay, the Wisconsin river is blocked from going south for over twenty miles between Stevens Point and Wisconsin Rapids. A tall sandstone bluff is found on the south side of the river between these two cities. From Wisconsin Rapids to Nekoosa the river drops vertically 300 ft in just five miles and requires four dams. Rock outcroppings on the East side of the river at the Centralia dam at the Bulls Eye Country Club and across the river from Port Edwards, suggest ancient flooding before the dams were built and the river reminds residents most every year of its power to flood from the northern Wisconsin watershed. A large boulder just below the Nekoosa dam was obviously there in ancient times. Large Lake Petenwell above Necedah and Roche a Cri is now used to help control floods. Then after the Wisconsin Dells rock formations, 75 foot limestone bluffs carved by water exist as the Wisconsin merges with the Mississippi. North East of Stevens Point, Sunset Lake, Three Lakes and numerous other unnamed glacial pot-like lakes exist. With plentiful surface water more work is needed to understand buried rock formations and the hydrology of water feeding these lakes in central Wisconsin.

Civil libertarianism is not a complete ideology‚Äîrather, it is a collection of views on the specific issues of civil liberties and civil rights.  In the libertarian movement  In the domain of libertarian philosophy, the primary concern of the civil libertarian is the relationship of the government to the individual. In theory, the civil libertarian seeks to restrict this relationship to an absolute minimum in which the state can function and provide basic services and securities without excessively interfering in the lives of its citizens. One key cause of civil libertarianism is upholding free speech. Specifically, civil libertarians oppose bans on hate speech and obscenity. Although they may or may not personally condone behaviors associated with these issues, civil libertarians hold that the advantages of unfettered public discourse outweigh all disadvantages. Other civil libertarian positions include support for at least partial legalization of illicit substances (marijuana and other soft drugs), prostitution, abortion, privacy, assisted dying or euthanasia, the right to bear arms, youth rights, topfree equality, a strong demarcation between religion and politics and more recently support for same-sex marriage. With the advent of personal computers, the Internet, email, cell phones and other information technology advances a subset of civil libertarianism has arisen that focuses on protecting individuals' digital rights and privacy.

The First Battle of Ypres had been fought the previous autumn. The Second Battle of Ypres was the first mass use by Germany of poison gas on the Western Front. It also marked the first time a former colonial force (the 1st Canadian Division) defeated a European power (the German Empire) in Europe (at the Battle of St. Julien and Battle of Kitcheners' Wood). Background Fritz Haber, a German chemist who proposed the use of the heavier-than-air chlorine gas as a weapon to break the trench deadlock. The eminent German chemist Walther Nernst, who was in the army in 1914 as a volunteer driver, saw how trenches produced deadlock. He proposed to Colonel Max Bauer, the German general staff officer responsible for liaison with scientists, that they could empty the opposing trenches by a surprise attack with tear gas. Observing a field test of this idea, the chemist Fritz Haber instead proposed using heavier than air chlorine gas (originally preferring the use of the more deadly phosgene gas, though little was stockpiled for such a use). The German commander Erich von Falkenhayn agreed to try the new weapon, but intended to use it in a diversionary attack by his 4th Army. The gas would be released by siphoning liquid chlorine out of cylinders; the gas could not be released directly because the valves would freeze; wind would carry the gas to the enemy lines. cylinders, the larger weighing each, were manhandled into the front line. Installation was supervised by Haber and the other future Nobel prize winners Otto Hahn, James Franck and Gustav Hertz. Twice cylinders were breached by shell fire, the second time three men were killed and fifty wounded. Some of the Germans were protected by miner's oxygen breathing apparatus. The Ypres salient was selected for the attack. It followed the canal, bulging eastward around the town. North of the salient, the Belgian army held the line of the Yser and the north end of the salient was held by two French divisions. The eastern part of the salient was defended by the Canadian and two British divisions. The II Corps and V Corps of the Second Army comprised the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Cavalry Divisions and the 4th, 27th, 28th, Northumbrian, Lahore and 1st Canadian divisions.

James used The Official Names of the Battles and Other Engagements Fought by the Military Forces of the British Empire during the Great War, 1914‚Äì1919, and the Third Afghan War, 1919: Report of the Battles Nomenclature Committee as approved by the Army Council (1921) to provide a summary of each engagement and the formations involved. In The Battles of Ypres, 1915 six engagements involving the Second Army were recorded, four during the Second Battle (22 April‚Äì25 May). * Battle of Gravenstafel: Thursday * Battle of St. Julien: * Battle of Frezenberg: * Battle of Bellewaarde: Battle of Gravenstafel Ridge (22‚Äì23 April 1915) On 22 April 1915 at about , the 4th Army released of chlorine gas on a front between the hamlets of Langemark () and Gravenstafel () on the Allied line held by French Territorial and (Moroccan and Algerian troops) of the French 45th and 87th divisions. The French troops in the path of the gas cloud suffered with fatalities. Troops fled in all directions, A gap in the French front was left undefended. German infantry followed well behind the cloud, breathing through cotton pads soaked with sodium thiosulfate solution and occupied the villages of Langemark and Pilkem, where they dug in, even though they might have occupied Ypres almost unopposed. They had taken 2,000 prisoners and 51 guns. Canadian troops defending the southern flank of the break-in identified chlorine because it smelled like their drinking water. The Germans released more chlorine gas at them the following day. Casualties were especially heavy for the 13th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), which was enveloped on three sides and had over-extended its left flank after the Algerian Division broke. In an action at Kitcheners' Wood, the 10th Battalion of the 2nd Canadian Brigade was ordered to counter-attack in the gap created by the gas attack. They formed up after on 22 April, with the 16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish) of the 3rd Brigade arriving to support the advance. Both battalions attacked with over in waves of two companies each, at Without reconnaissance, the battalions ran into obstacles halfway to their objective. Engaged by small-arms fire from the wood, they began an impromptu bayonet charge. The attack cleared the former oak plantation of Germans at a 75-percent casualty rate. The British press were confused by the attack: The Germans reported that they treated 200 gas casualties, 12 of whom died. The Allies reported 5,000 killed and 15,000 wounded.Van der Kloot 2004, p. 152. Within days the British were advised by John Scott Haldane to counter the effects of the gas by urinating into a cloth and breathing through it. Both sides set about developing more effective gas masks. Battle of St. Julien (24 April ‚Äì 5 May) The village of St. Julien (now Sint-Juliaan; ) was in the rear of the 1st Canadian Division until the poison-gas attack of 22 April, when it became the front line. Some of the first fighting in the village involved the stand of lance corporal Frederick Fisher of the 13th Battalion CEF's machine-gun detachment; Fisher went out twice with a handful of men and a Colt machine gun, preventing advancing German troops from passing through St. Julien into the rear of the Canadian front line. He was killed the following day. On the morning of 24 April, the Germans released another gas cloud towards the re-formed Canadian line just west of St. Julien. Word was passed to the troops to urinate on their handkerchiefs and place them over their nose and mouth. The countermeasures were insufficient, and German troops took the village. The next day the York and Durham Brigade units of the Northumberland Division counter-attacked, failing to secure their objectives but establishing a new line closer to the village. On 26 April 4, 6 and 7 Battalions, the Northumberland Brigade, the first Territorial brigade to go into action, attacked and gained a foothold in the village but were forced back, having suffered Despite hundreds of casualties, the 2nd Royal Dublin Fusiliers participated without respite in the battles at Frezenberg and Bellewaarde. On 24 April the battalion, subjected to a German gas attack near St. Julien, was nearly annihilated. The German Army first used chlorine-gas cylinders in April 1915 against the French Army at Ypres, when yellow-green clouds drifted towards the Allied trenches. The gas had a distinctive odour, resembling pineapple and pepper. The French officers, assuming at first that the German infantry were advancing behind a smoke screen, alerted the troops. When the gas reached the front Allied trenches, soldiers began to complain of chest pains and a burning sensation in the throat. George Nasmith, the head of the field laboratory for the Canadian Expeditionary Force, advised a Canadian field ambulance officer to pass the order to use urine to counteract the gas. Capt. Francis Scrimger of the 2nd Canadian Field Ambulance may have passed the order to use urine to counteract the gas, on the advice of Lt.-Col. George Gallie Nasmith. Soldiers realised they were being gassed and many ran as fast as they could. An hour after the attack began, there was a gap in the Allied line. Fearing the chlorine, few German soldiers moved forward and the delay enabled Canadian and British troops to retake the position before the Germans could exploit the gap. After the first German chlorine-gas attacks, Allied troops were supplied with masks of cotton pads soaked in urine; it had been discovered that the ammonia in the pad neutralised the chlorine. The pads were held over the face until the gas dispersed. Other soldiers preferred to use a handkerchief, sock or flannel body-belt, dampened with a sodium-bicarbonate solution and tied across the mouth and nose, until the gas passed. Soldiers found it difficult to fight like this, and attempts were made to develop a better means of protection against gas attacks. By July 1915, soldiers received efficient gas masks and anti-asphyxiation respirators. Private W. Hay of the Royal Scots arrived in Ypres just after the chlorine-gas attack on 22 April 1915: Battle of Frezenberg (8‚Äì13 May) Artillery barrage on Allied trenches at Ypres. The Germans began an artillery bombardment of the forward slope of Frezenberg ridge on 8 July. The Germans moved field artillery forward, placing three army corps opposite the 27th and 28th Divisions on the Frezenberg ridge (). The German attack began on 8 May with a bombardment of the 83rd Brigade in trenches on the forward slope of the ridge, but the first and second infantry assaults were repelled by the survivors. However, the third German assault of the morning pushed the defenders back. Although the neighbouring 80th Brigade repulsed the attack, the 84th Brigade was pushed back; this left a gap in the line. The Germans were prevented from advancing further by Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI)'s counter- attacks and a night move by the 10th Brigade. The PPCLI held the line at a steep cost; their 700-man force was reduced to 150, who were in no shape to fight. After this, their unofficial motto‚Äî\\"Holding up the whole damn line\\"‚Äîis still used today. Battle of Bellewaarde (24‚Äì25 May) On 24 May the Germans released a gas attack that hit Shell Trap Farm and to the area around the north west, which was affected the most by the attack. A report of the event by Captain Thomas Leahy, of the 2nd Royal Dublin Fusiliers, shows that their C.O. Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Loveband suspected a gas attack and had warned all company officers. Later the Germans threw up red lights over their trench, which would signal a gas release. Grave in Kells, County Meath, Ireland of a Leinster Regiment soldier who died at Bellewaarde. German forces managed to advance and occupy the British line to north and left of the Battalion. The Battalion was now under heavy fire from the German forces. But with shellfire and the aid from the 9th Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders they managed to hold their trenches to the end. Aftermath Analysis By the end of the battle, British forces had withdrawn to a new line 3 miles closer to Ypres, thereby resulting in a compression of its surrounding salient. The city, bombarded by artillery fire, was demolished. Although poison gas had been used on the Eastern Front, it surprised the Allies and about 7,000 gas casualties were transported in field ambulances and treated in casualty clearing stations. In May and June, 350 British deaths were recorded from gas poisoning. Both sides developed gas weapons and counter-measures, which changed the nature of gas warfare; the French and British used gas at the Battle of Loos in late September. Gas protection was somewhat improved with the issue of improvised respirators made from cotton waste pads impregnated with sodium hyposulphite, sodium bicarbonate and glycerin. The respirators made little difference, however, due to lack of training and the use of local contraptions and poorly made items imported from Britain. The \\"P helmet\\" (or \\"Tube Helmet\\") soaked in sodium phenate was issued by December 1915, and the PH helmet (effective against phosgene) was issued in early 1916. Although many French troops ran for their lives, others stood their ground and waited for the cloud to pass. Field Marshal Sir John French, Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force, wrote, The Canadian Division mounted an effective defence but had 5,975 casualties by its withdrawal on 3 May. The division was unprepared for the warfare prevailing on the Western Front, where linear tactics were ineffective against attackers armed with magazine rifles and machine guns. The Canadian field artillery had been effective but the deficiencies of the Ross rifle worsened tactical difficulties. The Canadian Division received several thousand replacements shortly after the battle. At Second Ypres, the smallest tactical unit in the infantry was a company; by 1917 it would be the section. The Canadians were employed offensively later in 1915 but not successfully. The battle was the beginning of a long period of analysis and experiment to improve the effectiveness of Canadian infantry weapons, artillery and liaison between infantry and artillery. Casualties After the war, German casualties from 21 April to 30 May were recorded as 34,933 by the official historians of the . In the British Official History, J. E. Edmonds and G. C. Wynne recorded British losses of 59,275 casualties, the French about 18,000 casualties on 22 April and another 3,973 from Canadian casualties from 22 April to 3 May were 5,975, of whom about 1,000 men were killed. The worst day was 24 April, when were suffered during infantry attacks, artillery bombardments and gas discharges. In 2002, Clayton wrote that thousands of men of the 45th and 87th divisions ran from the gas but that the number of casualties was low. The Germans overran both divisions' artillery but the survivors rallied and held a new line further back. In 2010, Humphries and Maker, in their translated edition of Der Weltkrieg recorded that by 9 May, there had been more than 35,000 German casualties, 59,275 British between 22 April and 31 May and very many French casualties, 18,000 on 22 April alone. In 2012, Sheldon gave similar figures and in 2014, Greenhalgh wrote that French casualties had been exaggerated by propaganda against German \\"frightfulness\\" and that in 1998, Olivier Lepick had estimated that were killed by gas in April out of casualties. Lance Sergeant Elmer Cotton described the effects of chlorine gas, Subsequent operations The First Attack on Bellewaarde was conducted by the 3rd Division of V Corps on 16 June 1915 and the Second Attack on Bellewaarde, a larger operation, was conducted from by the 3rd Division and the 14th Division of VI Corps. The Battle of Mont Sorrel took place south of Ypres with the 20th Division (XIV Corps) and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Canadian divisions of the Canadian Corps. The Third Battle of Ypres, also known as the Battle of Passchendaele, was fought from 31 July to 10 November 1917. Commemoration Canadian participation during the Second Battle of Ypres is commemorated at the Saint Julien Memorial. Canadian participation in the Battle of Gravenstafel is commemorated on the Saint Julien Memorial in the village. During the Second Battle of Ypres, Lt. Col.

The title character is the historical Viking duke of Normandy, Rollo (lived 846 ‚Äì ). Scholars have disputed almost everything about the play; but it was probably written sometime in the 1612‚Äì24 era and later revised, perhaps in 1630 or after. In addition to the four writers cited above, the names of Nathan Field and Robert Daborne have been connected with the play by individual scholars. Synopsis Rollo, Duke of Normandy, is locked in a struggle for power with his brother Otto. Urged on by the sycophantic LaTorch, Rollo eventually murders Otto. After he commits a number of other bloodthirsty deeds, Rollo is lured into a private meeting with the beautiful Edith, daughter of one of his victims, who plots to murder him. As Edith hesitates, Hamond, captain of the guard and brother of another of Rollo's victims, breaks in and murders Rollo. Hamond is himself killed in the process. Aubrey, Rollo's cousin, succeeds to the dukedom; he has Edith cloistered and LaTorch whipped and hanged. Performance and publication Details of the play's earliest productions are not preserved in the historical record. The play was seen at the Globe Theatre on 13 May 1633,G. E.

The play was included in the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679. Though the theatres were officially closed from 1642 to 1660, surreptitious performances occurred sporadically through the era. 1647 was a year of relative official lenience, when the actors were surprisingly active; but the London authorities soon cracked down. On 5 February 1648, King's Men players were arrested in the midst of a clandestine performance of Rollo at the Cockpit Theatre.Andrew Gurr, The Shakespeare Company 1594‚Äì1642, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; pp. 203‚Äì4.

Along with other composers mainly in the Holy Roman Empire and France, he was responsible for certain operatic reforms including reducing ornateness of style and the primacy of star singers somewhat. Biography Traetta was born in Bitonto, a town near Bari in the Apulia region, near the top of the heel of the boot of Italy. He eventually became a pupil of the composer, singer and teacher Nicola Porpora in Naples, and scored a first success with his opera Il Farnace, in Naples, in 1751. Around this time he seems too have come into contact with Niccol√≤ Jommelli. From here on in, Traetta seems to have had regular commissions from all around the country, running the gamut of the usual classical subjects. Then in 1759, something untoward happened that was to trigger Traetta's first operatic re-think. He accepted a post as court composer at Parma. Parma, it has to be said, was hardly an important place in the grand scheme of things: a minor dukedom, but a dukedom with a difference, because the incumbent was Spanish and his wife was French. Parma had regularly changed owners between Austrians and Spaniards and the current Duke was the Infante Felipe. And in one of those inter-dynastic marriages which so complicate the history of Europe, he had married the eldest daughter of Louis XV. With the result that there was currently in Parma a craze for all things French, and in particular a fixation with the splendour of Versailles. Which is where the influence of the composer Jean-Philippe Rameau comes in. It was in Parma that Traetta's operas first began to move in new directions. And as a result there is no doubt that Antigona, his 1772 opera for St. Petersburg, was amongst his most forward-looking, the closest he approached the famous reform ideals usually associated with Gluck, but in fact a current that was felt by several other composers of the time. It was in Parma, at the court of the Bourbon Duke there, that Traetta ran unexpectedly headlong into some fresh air from France. In Parma in 1759, he found a number of significant collaborators, and he was fortunate in finding that the man in charge of opera there was a highly cultivated Paris-trained Frenchman, Guillaume du Tillot, who had the complete cultural portfolio among all his other responsibilities as Don Felipe's First Minister. To judge from the general stylistic influence in terms of grand scenic effects, and from some specific musical borrowings, Traetta had access in Parma to copies and reports of Rameau's operas. To their influence, Traetta added some ingredients of his own, especially a feeling for dramatic colour, in the shape of his melodies and his use of the orchestra. The result was a combination of Italian, French and German elements, which even anticipate the Sturm und Drang movement that was to flourish a few years later, further North. The first fruit of this francophilia was the opera Traetta wrote in 1759. Ippolito ed Aricia owes a lot to Rameau's great trag√©die lyrique of 1733, Hippolyte et Aricie. But Traetta's is no mere translation of Rameau. Frugoni, Traetta's librettist in Parma completely reworked the original French version by abb√© Pellegrin, which itself had been based on Racine, in its turn stemming ultimately from ancient Greek roots - the Hippolytus of Euripides. Frugoni retained certain key French elements: the five-act structure as against the customary three; the occasional opportunities for French-style spectacle and effects and in particular the dances and divertissements that end each of those five acts; and a more elaborate use of the chorus than for instance in Hasse and Graun and Jommelli. Through the following decade, the 1760s, Tommaso Traetta composed music unceasinglynot just opera seria, either. There was a clutch of comedies as well, to say nothing of sacred music composed to imperial order. For Traetta served from 1768 to 1775 as music director for Catherine the Great of Russia, to which he relocated. Still, opera seria was generally what her imperial majesty commanded. Traetta's first operas for Catherine the Great seem to have been largely revivals and revisions of his earlier works. But then in 1772 came Antigonaand for whatever reason, whether it was Traetta's own inclination or the promptings of his librettist Marco Coltellini or the availability of the soprano Caterina Gabrielli, the new opera reached areas of feeling and intensity he had never explored before, even in Parma. The Court Opera of Catherine the Great performed in a theatre inside the Winter Palace itself, created by the architect Bartolomeo Francesco Rastrellianother Italianwho was the architect of many buildings in St. Petersburg, including the Hermitage. The theatre was quite close to the Empress' own apartments. Too close, in fact, because in 1783, that is to say some time after Traetta's departure, she ordered it to be closed and a new one built. Some years before that she had already booted out Rastrelli, who had been the favourite architect of her predecessor. Traetta too was to depart, though possibly it was the harsh climate of Peter the Great's still relatively new and very damp capital, rather than the Empress' boot, that led him to leave St Petersburg in 1775, and resume the opera composer's peripatetic life, even writing two works for London: Germondo in 1776 and Telemaco the year after. There is a story, told by the Traetta association in Bitonto, that he left St. Petersburg under threat of assassination by the empress‚Äîit seems he was enraged that she insisted on a happy ending for Antigona, and in revenge put music for Polish independence into the final chaconne. He left in time, but his librettist was poisoned. Traetta died two years later, in April 1779, in Venice. He married shortly before he died, and had a son, Filippo Traetta, who in 1800 moved to America and became a fairly successful composer. Operas :See List of operas by Tommaso Traetta.

In the film, long-time friends Mitch (Macdonald) and Sam (Lange) start a revenge-for-hire business, and work to fund heart surgery for Sam's father Pops (Warden). When they take on work for an unscrupulous businessman (Christopher McDonald), in order to be paid, they create a revenge scheme of their own. Notable cameo appearances include Don Rickles, Rebecca Romijn, John Goodman, Gary Coleman, Chris Farley (in his final film appearance), and Adam Sandler as Satan. The film was the first starring vehicle for Macdonald and Lange and the first feature film directed by Saget, coming one year after he left his long-running role as host of America's Funniest Home Videos. Though the film received largely negative critical reviews upon its 1998 release and was a financial disappointment, it has since become a cult classic and has been reappraised more positively by some critics. Co-star Artie Lange later became a regular on The Howard Stern Show, where the film was sometimes discussed.  Plot  Growing up, friends Mitch Weaver (Norm Macdonald) and Sam McKenna (Artie Lange) are taught by Sam's hard-nosed dad, \\"Pops\\" McKenna (Jack Warden), not to \\"take crap from anyone\\". To that end, the pair plant a bunch of guns in a schoolyard bully's desk and have him arrested for gun possession; next, they catch a kid-fondling crossing guard in the act, after having applied Krazy Glue to the bottom of Mitch's pants. As adults, after losing fourteen jobs in three months and being dumped by his girlfriend, Mitch moves in with Sam and Pops, who then has a heart attack. In the hospital, Pops confides that, because of their parents' swinging lifestyle, he is also Mitch's father. Even though Pops' heart is failing, Dr. Farthing (Chevy Chase), a hopeless gambler, will raise Mr. McKenna's position on the transplant waiting list if he is paid $50,000, to save himself from his bookie. Mitch and Sam get jobs in a cinema with an abusive manager (Don Rickles) and exact their revenge by showing Men In Black (Who Like To Have Sex With Each Other) to a packed house. The other workers congratulate them and suggest they go into business. Mitch and Sam open \\"Dirty Work\\", a revenge-for-hire business (the Dirty Work phone number is \\"555-0187\\", a fictitious number used later on Saturday Night Live.). Mitch falls for a woman named Kathy (Traylor Howard) who works for a shady used car dealer (David Koechner). After publicly embarrassing the dealer during a live TV commercial (Mitch: \\"Here‚Äôs another dead hooker in this trunk!\\"), the duo exacts increasingly lucrative reprisals for satisfied customers until they interfere with unscrupulous local property developer Travis Cole (Christopher McDonald). Cole tricks them into destroying \\"his\\" apartment building (actually owned by Mr. John Kirkpatrick, the landlord), promising to pay them enough to save Pops. Afterwards, Cole reneges, revealing that he is not the owner and that he had them vandalize the building so that he could buy it cheaply, evict the tenants (including Kathy's grandmother), and build a parking lot for his luxurious new opera house. Unknown to Cole, Mitch's \\"note to self\\" (Macdonald used \\"Note to Self\\" reminders into a real or imagined pocket tape recorder on SNL Weekend Update.) mini-tape recorder captures this confession. Mitch and Sam plot their revenge on Cole, using the tape to set up an elaborate trap. Using skunks, a loyal army of prostitutes, homeless men, a noseless friend (Chris Farley), brownies with hallucinogenic additives, and Pops, they ruin the opening night of Don Giovanni, an opera sponsored prominently by Cole. With the media present, Mitch plays back Cole's confession over the theater's sound system. Cole sees that his public image is being tarnished and agrees to pay the $50,000. In the end, Cole is punched in the stomach, arrested and jailed, his dog is raped by a skunk, Pops gets his operation, and Mitch gets the girl. Dr. Farthing overcomes his gambling habit but is beaten to death by bookies in the end.

In his first appearance on The Howard Stern Show on September 18, 2008, Chevy Chase discussed the film's production and release with Artie Lange. According to Chase, he was impressed by the original script's raunchy, R-rated, \\"over the top\\" tone (particularly a filmed but ultimately cut gag involving Macdonald and Lange delivering donuts that had been photographed around their genitals) and, Lange related, went so far as to beg Macdonald not to allow any changes‚Äîto \\"keep it funny\\". Lange said the studio insisted on a PG-13 rating and moved the film's release from the February dump months to June, where it fared poorly against blockbusters like Godzilla. During production, Norm MacDonald was embroiled in a feud with Don Ohlmeyer, then an executive with NBC. Ohlmeyer, a friend of O. J. Simpson, took offense at MacDonald's frequent and pointed jokes against Simpson on Weekend Update and had MacDonald fired from the position. Ohlmeyer went further and refused to sell advertising space or air commercials for Dirty Work. NBC eventually relented (Ohlmeyer was forced into retirement not long afterward) a week after the film premiered. Dirty Work was Chris Farley's last-released film appearance, filmed before his fatal drug overdose in December 1997. MGM released the film on DVD, in August 1999, and for digital rental/purchase.  Reception  The film received mostly negative critical reviews. It was referred to as a \\"leaden, taste-deprived attempted comedy\\" and \\"a desert of comedy\\" with only infrequent humor in The New York Times. The Los Angeles Times described it as \\"a tone-deaf, scattershot and dispiritingly cheesy affair with more groans than laughs\\", and though Macdonald \\"does uncork a few solid one-liners\\", his lack of conviction in his acting \\"is amusing in and of itself, but it doesn't help the movie much\\". The San Francisco Chronicle recommended the film only for \\"people who like stupid lowdown vulgar comedy. I had a few good laughs.\\" It has a 17% critic rating at Rotten Tomatoes, averaged from 30 reviews.Dirty Work. Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved 2011-08-07. The film has been described as a \\"cult classic\\". In his column, My Year Of Flops, critic Nathan Rabin describes Dirty Work as an example of \\"the ironic dumb comedy, the slyly postmodern lowbrow gag-fest that so lustily, nakedly embraces and exposes the machinations and conventions of stupid laffers that it becomes a sort of sublime bit of meta-comedy\\".  Sequel  In 2018 when asked about a sequel, MacDonald stated \\"It was an R-rated movie, so we made it that way, then they made it [PG-13], so half the movie had to be cut. So it's hard for me to see it objectively. There might be another one coming now, I guess.\\" MacDonald did not elaborate further regarding the potential sequel.

Service began on February 3, 1978. The station serves the Brookland neighborhood and the Catholic University of America. It is the focal point of an upcoming transit-oriented development project. . History The station opened on February 3, 1978. Originally simply known as \\"Brookland,\\" in 1979 its name was changed to \\"Brookland‚ÄìCUA\\" due to the proximity of The Catholic University of America to the station. In the summer of 2018 from July 21 to September 3, the station was shut down for platform repairs due to settling of the platform and decaying concrete caused by salty de-icer used in the winter. Transit-oriented development Brookland‚ÄìCUA station is slated to be the center of a massive transport-oriented regeneration with the aim of increasing pedestrian-friendly development and an arts-focused neighborhood. The project includes a relocation of the station portals slightly to the south in a plaza with the western end of 9th, Newton, and Otis Streets which will be extended to the station plaza for more convenient access to the rest of the surrounding area. In August 2014, Metro picked a joint venture involving MRP Realty and CAS Riegler LLC to begin the redevelopment of the site. The plan called for construction of 280 apartments and condominiums; of ground-floor retail, 228 parking spaces, and the replacement of Metro's 38-space Kiss & Ride lot. Metro proposed a 98-year lease that included rent increases, and required the joint venture to seek approval of its plans from the District of Columbia Zoning Commission. At that time, Metro said ground would break on the redevelopment in 2016. But in January 2015, the joint venture said it would take at least four years before it could complete its plans and obtain zoning commission approval, and that it would not be able to sign a lease until 2019. Station layout The station has one slightly curved island platform. This curve requires mirrors to be placed on the westbound side of the platform to aid train operators in making sure the area is clear before closing the doors. Brookland‚ÄìCUA also has a relatively uncommon layout; passengers entering the station first take escalators, stairs, or an elevator down to a lower level which includes the station's fare gates and ticket machines, before using escalators or elevators to go back up to reach the platform level. Like , , and , Brookland‚ÄìCUA is located in the middle of the CSX Metropolitan Subdivision rail line. There are two tracks to either side of the island platform, with Metro trains use the inner tracks and Amtrak and MARC Trains using the outer tracks.

This contrasts with arrangements where electric motors in different units are connected directly to the power supply switched by a single control mechanism, thus requiring the full traction power to be transmitted through the train. A set of vehicles under multiple unit control is referred to as a consist in the United States. Origins South Side Elevated Railroad car #1, one of the cars that Frank Sprague converted to MU operation in Chicago Multiple unit train control was first used in electric multiple units in the 1890s. The Liverpool Overhead Railway The Liverpool Overhead Railway opened in 1893 with two-car electric multiple units, controllers in cabs at both ends directly controlling the traction current to motors on both cars. Frank J. Sprague The multiple unit traction control system was developed by Frank Sprague and first applied and tested on the South Side Elevated Railroad (now part of the Chicago 'L') in 1897. In 1895, derived from his company's invention and production of direct current elevator control systems, Frank Sprague invented a multiple unit controller for electric train operation. This accelerated the construction of electric traction railways and trolley systems worldwide. Each car of the train has its own traction motors: by means of motor control relays in each car energized by train-line wires from the front car all of the traction motors in the train are controlled in unison. Locomotive applications Sprague's MU system was adopted for use by diesel-electric locomotives and electric locomotives in the 1920s; however, these early control connections were entirely pneumatic. Today's modern MU control utilizes both pneumatic elements for brake control and electric elements for throttle setting, dynamic braking, and fault lights. In the early days of diesel electric MUing there were numerous different systems; some were compatible with one another, but others were not. For example, when first delivered, many F units lacked MU cables on their noses, allowing only for MUing through the rear of the locomotive. That meant that if a train need four locomotives and there were four A units and no B units, a train would require two train crews as the four A units could not be multiple-unit-controlled, except as two groups of two. Terms used in North America are A unit and B unit where the B or \\"booster\\" unit does not have a control cab; slug where the B unit has traction motors powered by the \\"mother\\" unit via extra connections; and Cow-calf for switcher units. A Control Car Remote Control Locomotive has remote control but not traction equipment. Most modern diesel locomotives are now delivered equipped for MU operation, allowing a consist (set) of locomotives to be operated from one cab. Not all MU connections are standardized between manufacturers, thus limiting the types of locomotives that can be used together. However, in North America there is a high level of standardization between all railroads and manufacturers using the Association of American Railroads (AAR) system which allows any modern locomotive in North America to be connected to any other modern North American locomotive. In the United Kingdom several different incompatible MU systems are in use (and some locomotive classes were never fitted for MU working), but more modern diesel locomotives used on British railways use the standard Association of American Railroads system. Modern locomotive MU systems can be easily spotted due to the large MU cables to the right and left of the coupler. The connections typically consist of several air hoses for controlling the air brake system, and an electrical cable for the control of the traction equipment. The largest hose, located next to the coupler, is the main air brake line or \\"train line\\". Additional hoses link the air compressors on the locomotives and control the brakes on the locomotives independently of the rest of the train. There are sometimes additional hoses that control the application of sand to the rails. With distributed power, long trains, e.g. ore trains on mining lines, may have locomotives at each end and at intermediate locations in the train to reduce the maximum drawbar load. The locomotives are often radio-controlled from the lead locomotive by the Locotrol system. Remote control locomotives, e.g. \\"switchers\\" in hump yards, may be controlled by a stationary operator. These types of remote control systems often use the AAR MU standard which allows any locomotive using the AAR MU standard to be easily \\"MU'ed\\" to a control receiver and thus capable of becoming remote-controlled. Passenger train applications Two Japanese Shinkansen trains operating in multiple-unit train control Modern electric multiple unit and diesel multiple unit vehicles often utilise a specialised coupler that provides both mechanical, electrical and pneumatic connections between vehicles. These couplers permit trains to be connected and disconnected automatically without the need for human intervention on the ground. There are a few designs of fully automatic couplers in use worldwide, including the Scharfenberg coupler, various knuckle hybrids (such as the Tightlock, used in the UK), the Wedgelock coupling, Dellner couplings (similar to Scharfenberg couplers in appearance), and the BSI coupling. Multiple control technology is also used in push-pull trains operating with a standard locomotive at one end only. Control signals are either received from the cab as normal, or from a cab car at the other end that is connected to the locomotive by cables through the intermediate cars. In the United States Amtrak often operates one to three diesel locomotives on routes outside the Northeast corridor with only one operator.

The station is considered to be located in part of Takoma Park's Historic District. It is the last station in the District of Columbia on the eastern end of the Red Line heading to Maryland, located east of the intersection of Blair Road NW and Cedar Street NW. The station's parking lot and bus stops are accessed from Eastern Avenue NW, which runs along the DC‚ÄìMaryland line. History Prior to the opening of Metrorail, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) operated commuter trains that served intra-DC locations, including Takoma Park (this service continues as MARC's Brunswick Line, although the closest station serving the area is in Silver Spring Maryland). Commuter rail service ended before Metrorail service began, and the old shelter for the rail stop was demolished in order widen the right-of-way to accommodate Metrorail. Remnants of the Takoma Park B&O; rail stop are visible to the west of the Metro station. The original Takoma Park railroad station, located within DC, burned down in 1962. Construction of the Metrorail Station took place in the early 1970s, and the station shares architectural features with the other above- ground stations constructed across the system. Takoma was among some of the first stations to open in the Metrorail System, less than two years after the system's inauguration on March 27, 1976. Service to Takoma began on February 6, 1978. In 2017, the station was closed from November 25 to December 10 as part of Metro's Capital Improvement Program. The work mainly focused on replacing and repairing existing tracks. 2009 collision On June 22, 2009, a southbound Metro train on the Red Line collided with another southbound train, which was stopped between the Takoma and Fort Totten stations, causing the deadliest accident in the system's history. Station layout The entrance to the station is at the street level, with escalators leading up to the platform. A separate accessible entrance consisting of a single elevator is located near the middle of the platform. The separate accessible and general entrances are a relative rarity in the Washington Metro system; only and stations share this feature. Like , , and , Takoma is located in the middle of the CSX Metropolitan Subdivision rail line. There are two tracks to either side of the island platform, with Metro trains use the inner tracks and Amtrak and MARC Trains using the outer tracks.

Grosvenor‚ÄìStrathmore is the last above-ground station for Glenmont-bound Red Line trains; south of the station, trains cross over the Capital Beltway before descending underground. It is one of a number of stations on the Rockville Pike corridor in Montgomery County.  Location  Named after the nearby Grosvenor Lane, Grosvenor‚ÄìStrathmore station lies within the unincorporated area of North Bethesda. Located to the east of Rockville Pike at its intersection with Tuckerman Lane, the main point of interest near the station is the Music Center at Strathmore. In addition, it is the first stop outside of the Capital Beltway heading outbound towards Shady Grove on the Red Line.  Station layout  Grosvenor has one island platform located just east of Rockville Pike. Access to the station is provided by a passageway connecting the Pike and a large parking lot and garage east of the station. Bus bays and a kiss and ride lot are east of the station, but there is also a bus stop west of the station on Rockville Pike. The tracks in the open cut continue in a tunnel north of the station, and become elevated south of the station to enter the median of Rockville Pike.  History  Service to Grosvenor (named for its proximity to Grosvenor Lane) began on August 25, 1984. Grosvenor Lane was located at the farm of Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor (1875‚Äì1966), the father of photojournalism and the first full-time editor of National Geographic from 1899 to 1954. He moved there from the Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C. after buying the farmland in 1912. The station's opening coincided with the completion of of rail northwest of the Van Ness‚ÄìUDC station and the opening of the Bethesda, Friendship Heights, Medical Center and Tenleytown stations. It remained the western terminus of the Red Line until the extension of that line to Shady Grove that December. Trains from Silver Spring terminated here during peak times until December 2018. https://www.wmata.com/about/news/shady-grove-improvements.cfm In February 2005, the Music Center at Strathmore opened adjacent to the station, prompting the name change to Grosvenor‚ÄìStrathmore. The arts complex and station are connected via an elevated pedestrian walkway, the Carlton R. Sickles Memorial Sky Bridge. Escalators and an underground walkway were also added to the station to allow customers to easily cross the busy road, Rockville Pike, that is adjacent to the station. From March 26, 2020 until June 28, 2020, this station was closed due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.

After spending a number of years on the backbench, Mirabella moved to the position of Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Local Government after the Coalition lost government in 2007 and to the role of Spokeswoman on Early Childhood Education, Childcare, Women and Youth in 2008. In 2009, she was appointed as the Shadow Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research. Mirabella narrowly lost her seat of Indi at the 2013 federal election to independent candidate Cathy McGowan. She also resigned from the Coalition frontbench shortly prior to conceding defeat. She subsequently attempted to regain the seat, standing again for the Liberal Party at the 2016 election, but was defeated by McGowan again on an increased margin. Personal life Mirabella was born Sophie Panopoulos in Melbourne, Victoria, her parents having arrived in Australia from Greece in 1956. She was educated at St Catherine's School, Toorak, while working part-time at her father's milk bar in South Melbourne. Upon finishing secondary school, she attended the University of Melbourne where she studied law and became involved in student activism through the Melbourne University Liberal Club, of which she was president, and as vice-president of the Australian Liberal Students' Federation. After graduating from Melbourne University with degrees in law and commerce, Mirabella worked as a solicitor and articled clerk from 1995 to 1997. From 1998 until her election to Parliament she worked as a barrister. In 1995, she began a live-in relationship with Colin Howard, then dean of law at Melbourne University, who was forty years her senior. The relationship ended in 2001, although they remained close until his death in 2011. Her relationship with Howard was later the subject of a bitter dispute between Mirabella and Howard's adult children who questioned Mirabella's care for and treatment of their father in the months leading up to a serious illness in late 2008 when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Mirabella held power of attorney over Howard's affairs from early 2007, and pursuant to his 1997 will was executor and sole beneficiary of his estate following his death in 2011. In June 2006 she married Greg Mirabella, a former Australian Army Reserve officer still working in the defence industry. The couple have two daughters. Political career Mirabella has been a member of the Liberal Party since 1987. She became well known during the constitutional monarchy/republican debate in Australia, acting as a prominent advocate for retaining the constitutional monarchy, and was an elected member of the 1998 Constitutional Convention.Schubert, Misha (18 June 2005). \\"A tale of two Liberals\\". The Age Retrieved 24 August 2012. The referendum that followed saw all states and a majority of Australians support the retention of the constitutional monarchy over the republican model that was offered. In 2001 Mirabella won preselection as the Liberal candidate to succeed Lou Lieberman as the Member for Indi, standing against Sussan Ley, which she won in the 2001 federal election with a vote of 61.15% on a two-party preferred basis. Mirabella received a well above-average 5.6% swing to her in the 2004 federal election, giving her 66.3% of the two-party preferred vote and making Indi a safe Liberal seat. Within the federal government, Mirabella sat in the backbench until 2007. During this time, in 2005, she attracted public attention as a key member of an informal \\"ginger group\\" of Liberal backbenchers. She chaired this group with Victorian Senator Mitch Fifield. The group argued for \\"tax reform\\" (in essence, tax cuts paid for by reductions in government spending), sparking public debate on the topic. Although Fifield stepped away from the group after budget cuts in 2005, Mirabella continued for a time as the group's chair. While on the backbench, Mirabella took a strong stance on the prominent issue of asylum seekers, criticising a group of four fellow Liberal backbenchers, including Petro Georgiou and Judi Moylan, for opposing government policy on mandatory detention. In August 2005, she called for Muslim women to be required to remove their head dress when posing for photo identification.\\"Bishop backs headscarf ban\\". The Age 28 August 2005. Retrieved 24 August 2012. Mirabella was an advocate of voluntary student unionism (VSU) and strongly supported the legislation proposed by Brendan Nelson.Woe, David (10 August 2005). \\"Student unionism divides Coalition\\". The Age Retrieved 24 August 2012. In opposition In 2007 the Coalition lost the federal election and entered opposition. After the election, Mirabella was promoted to the role of Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Local Government under the leadership of Brendan Nelson. While serving in that role, she attracted controversy in January 2008 when she launched an attack on former Liberal Party Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, after a speech he gave at Melbourne University on \\"the Bush Administration (reversing) 60 years of progress in establishing a law-based international system\\", claiming errors and \\"either intellectual sloppiness or deliberate dishonesty\\", and that he tacitly supported Islamic fundamentalism, should have no influence on foreign policy, and that his stance on the war on terror has left him open to caricature as a \\"frothing-at-the-mouth leftie\\". She was also one of five Liberal MPs not present in February 2008, when a motion was passed unanimously apologising to the stolen generations of indigenous children between Federation and the 1970s. She explained her decision by asserting that there had never been a formal policy in Victoria of removing children from their families and that there is no evidence for any \\"truly stolen\\" children, despite the fact that the first laws passed giving authorities the right to take children from their parents were passed and used in Victoria. Mirabella was one of those who pledged their support to Malcolm Turnbull when he challenged Brendan Nelson for leadership of the Liberal Party in September 2008. She was promoted as part of the subsequent reshuffle, becoming the opposition spokeswoman on early childhood education, childcare, women and youth. Her move to the Shadow Cabinet came in 2009 after Tony Abbott defeated Turnbull in a leadership spill. She was promoted to the role of spokeswoman for innovation, industry, science and research. Mirabella had joined Abbott in resigning from the frontbench over Turnbull's climate change policy, and her move to the Shadow Cabinet was seen as part of the rise of the social-conservative right within the party. After the 2010 election, she held her seat with a margin of 9.9% two party preferred against Labor. Parliamentary style According to Fenella Souter in the Sydney Morning Herald, Mirabella is known for her \\"caustic, confrontational manner\\". Her behaviour led her to be ejected from parliament at least twice. In 2007, David Hawker expelled her for shouting at him after being warned twice to resume her seat. She defied parliamentary orders under Standing Order No. 94A and thus was removed from the House of Representatives for misconduct. In 2010, Peter Slipper expelled Mirabella from parliament for 24 hours on the eve of the vote on the carbon tax, when she \\"refused to accept a ruling barring her from tabling an anti-carbon tax petition\\". On a number of occasions her comments both inside and outside parliament attracted controversy. In 2008, Mirabella stated in parliament to Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who has no children, \\"You won't need his (ex-PM Kevin Rudd's) taxpayer-funded nanny, will you?\\" Mirabella again created controversy on 2 March 2011, when she compared Gillard to Muammar Gaddafi, claiming both were delusional. Abbott refused to condemn Mirabella, instead terming the comparison colourful and not language he would use. In 2012, she denounced fellow Liberal NSW Senator Bill Heffernan by telling him to \\"Oh, why don't you go and pop your Alzheimer's pills\\". This was in response to Heffernan branding a fellow Liberal senator a \\"fuckwit\\". Prior to the 2013 federal election, retiring independent MP Tony Windsor nominated Mirabella for \\"the nasty prize\\" when asked who was the person he would miss least in politics on the ABC Insiders program. \\"She is the nastiest ‚Äî I reckon if you put it to a vote to all politicians, she'd come up No.1‚Äù. 2013 federal election defeat Mirabella was defeated in Indi by independent candidate Cathy McGowan at the 2013 federal election. She was the only sitting Liberal member to lose her seat. On 11 September 2013, 1003 votes were discovered to have been misreported in a transcription error three days earlier. These were for McGowan, and strengthened her slight lead in the count. On 12 September, Mirabella issued a statement that, as the result in Indi would not be known for \\"many days\\", and her \\"future in the Parliament is not assured\\", she had requested Prime Minister-elect Abbott not consider her for a frontbench position in the new government. Abbott was quoted in reply: \\"I pay tribute to Sophie Mirabella and thank her for her magnanimity in ensuring the continuing vote count in Indi does not hinder formation of the new ministry.\\" On 18 September 2013, Mirabella conceded defeat, the same day Abbott and his government were sworn in. The final result in Indi saw Mirabella's Liberal two-candidate preferred vote at 49.8% (‚àí10.2), with the primary vote at 44.7% (‚àí7.2) and the two-party preferred vote at 59.1% (+0.1). Post-2013 career On 17 December 2013 Mirabella was named as an appointee to the board of ASC Pty Ltd ‚Äì formerly known as the Australian Submarine Corporation. Mirabella's past shadow cabinet roles were considered relevant to the appointment. A statement read \\"Combined with her legal background and her extensive experience working with the manufacturing industry, Mrs Mirabella will make a valuable contribution to the board\\". The appointment was greeted with cynicism by one journalist, describing the appointment as \\"jobs for the girls\\". In 2015, Mirabella stated Liberal minister Scott Morrison would be the \\"next conservative prime minister of Australia\\". Media Mirabella appeared as a panellist on the ABC TV talkback show Q&A; on a number of occasions. On one show in 2012 a fellow panellist (GetUp! director and unsuccessful Greens Senate candidate Simon Sheikh) had a seizure live on air, with his head falling forward on the desk. Mirabella was criticised for not responding to his situation, other than to look at the unconscious man with a look of repulsion. A spokesperson for Mirabella said she was unaware it was a medical emergency. Of the panelists, only Greg Combet physically responded to the situation. Sheikh made a full recovery off camera. 2016 federal election bid In 2015 Mirabella was endorsed as the Liberal candidate for the seat of Indi at the 2016 federal election. During the lead up to the official election campaign it was reported that Mirabella \\"very publicly pushed Ms McGowan out of the way to obstruct\\" a photo being taken of her opponent, Cathy McGowan, with a Liberal MP, Ken Wyatt. Mirabella went on Twitter to \\"emphatically reject reports I pushed Cathy McGowan\\"; the editor of the Benalla Ensign stated that she confirmed the incident with four sources and defended the reporting on the basis of \\"public interest\\". Mirabella denied the allegations and is reported as examining legal remedies. She stated that it was \\"extremely disappointing that the journalist at no time sought to contact me or check the facts or seek a right of reply.\\" She also said \\"I am currently investigating my legal remedies and those available through the Australian Press Council\\" and \\"The article represents a new low and a sad return to nasty tactics from my opponents.\\" It was reported that a witness denied that any physical altercation took place. On 21 April 2016, Mirabella alleged that during her failed election bid in 2013, 10 million of public funding for Wangaratta Hospital was promised by the then opposition leader, Tony Abbott. She also alleged that, due to her eventual election loss to independent candidate Cathy McGowan, this funding was scrapped by the newly elected coalition government. Mirabella claimed that her own party was the source of a series of damaging leaks to undermine her. Mirabella's bid to reclaim the seat of Indi was ultimately unsuccessful, with Independent Cathy McGowan claiming victory in the race, with a near 4.5% swing against Mirabella after preferences. Mirabella's first preference vote suffered a drop in excess of 17%, largely due to the Nationals Party fielding a candidate in Indi. McGowan retained Indi against Mirabella at the 2016 election with an increased 54.8% (+4.6) two-candidate-preferred vote. The Liberal two-party-preferred vote was reduced to 54.4% (‚Äì4.7) against Labor's 45.6% (+4.7), a marginal two- party result not seen since the 1929 election. Post politics In August 2016, Mirabella became the general manager of government and media relations for Gina Rinehart's company Hancock Prospecting.

Early life and education He was born at Parkgate, Cheshire, England, on 28 February 1865, the Son of Rev. Algernon Sidney Grenfell, headmaster of Mostyn House School, and Jane Georgiana Hutchison. Grenfell moved to London in 1882. He then commenced the study of medicine at the London Hospital Medical College (now part of Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry) under the tutelage of Sir Frederick Treves. He graduated in 1888. Career Career overview The Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen sent Grenfell to Newfoundland in 1892 to improve the plight of coastal inhabitants and fishermen. That mission began in earnest in 1892 when he recruited two nurses and two doctors for hospitals at Indian Harbour, Newfoundland and later opened cottage hospitals along the coast of Labrador. The mission expanded greatly from its initial mandate to one of developing schools, an orphanage, cooperatives, industrial work projects, and social work. Although founded to serve the local area, the mission developed to include the aboriginal peoples and settlers along the coasts of Labrador and the eastern side of the Great Northern Peninsula of northern Newfoundland. One of the children Grenfell assisted was an Inuit girl, Kirkina, for whom he helped secure artificial limbs and later the Grenfell Mission educated her in nursing and midwifery. In 1907, Grenfell imported a group of 300 reindeer from Norway to provide food and serve as draft animals in Newfoundland. Unbeknownst to him, some of the animals carried a parasitic roundworm, Elaphostrongylus rangiferi, that then spread to native caribou herds. The reindeer herd eventually disappeared; however, the parasite took hold and causes cerebrospinal elaphostrongylosis (CSE) in caribou, a disease well known in reindeer in Scandinavia. In 1908, Grenfell was on his way with his dogs to a Newfoundland village for a medical emergency when he got caught in \\"slob\\", from which he managed to get onto an ice-pan with the dogs. He was forced to sacrifice some of his dogs to make a warm, fur coat for himself. After drifting for several days without food or fresh water, he was rescued by some villagers in the area. Because of this experience he buried the dogs and put up a plaque saying, \\"Who gave their lives for me.\\" He married Anne Elizabeth Caldwell MacClanahan (died 1938) of Chicago, Illinois, in 1909. They had three children and retired to Vermont after his work in NewfoundlandThey were married in 1909 and came to live in the Grenfell House (which they designed together) in St. Anthony, Newfoundland. Anne gave Dr. Grenfell's life comfort and refinement. She became totally involved in his work. She organized his fundraising tours and lectures, edited his books and helped secure scholarships for the children of the area to continue their education. Although Anne was ill towards the end of her life, she kept her pain hidden from her husband and took care of him until she died in 1938. Height of his career By 1914 the mission had gained international status. In order to manage its property and affairs, the International Grenfell Association, a non-profit mission society, was founded to support Grenfell's work. The Association operated until 1981, as an NGO. It had responsibility for delivery of healthcare and social services in northern Newfoundland and Labrador. After 1981 a governmental agency, The Grenfell Regional Health Services Board, took over the operational responsibility. The International Grenfell Association, having divested itself of all properties and operational responsibility for health and social services, boarding schools, hospitals then became a supporting association making grants and funding scholarships for medical training. For his years of service on behalf of the people of these communities he was later knighted by the King in 1927. In 1931, Grenfell had a small speaking role in the film, The Viking, in which he narrated the film's prologue and gave a brief statement of the tragic circumstances involving the film's production. During the production of the film, which was filmed on location in Newfoundland, producer Varick Frissell felt that the film needed more action sequences and set out on the ice floes to film them. During filming, the ship, SS Viking on which filming was taking place, exploded killing Frissell and 27 others. Death and legacy Grenfell died of a coronary thrombosis at Kinloch House in Charlotte, Vermont on 9 October 1940. His ashes were brought to St Anthony, where they were placed inside a rock face overlooking the harbour. Sir Wilfred Grenfellpostage issue of 1940 The Sir Wilfred Thomason Grenfell Historical Society was formed in 1978. The society purchased Grenfell's home in St. Anthony, Newfoundland and Labrador. The home has been restored as a museum and archives. The Sir Wilfred Thomason Grenfell Historical Society with the support of Provincial Government and the International Grenfell Association began construction of an interpretation centre in St. Anthony and it was opened in 1997. This facility added to the existing house and serves to promote the legacy to thousands of visitors each year. The Grenfell Interpretation Centre also is used by other organizations for meetings and events. A large interpretive display is housed there and provides historical background surrounding the work of Sir Wilfred Thomason Grenfell. Grenfell is honoured with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on 9 October. Literary inspiration A unique figure, Grenfell served to inspire at least two characters in Canadian literature: Dr. Luke in Norman Duncan's Doctor Luke of the Labrador (1904) and Dr. Tocsin in White Eskimo by Harold Horwood (1972). A biography for children (middle-high school) was written in 1942, by Genevieve Fox. Published by Thomas Y. Crowell Co. The book had second and third printings as well. The following statement has been widely ascribed to him, but cannot be found in any of his books: \\"The service we render to others is really the rent we pay for our room on this earth. It is obvious that man is himself a traveler; that the purpose of this world is not 'to have and to hold' but 'to give and serve.'

Three white men died in the confrontation, with at least one said to have been shot by his own ally. In the wake of the contested 1872 election for governor of Louisiana and local offices, a group of white Democrats armed with rifles and a small cannon, overpowered Republican freedmen and state militia (also black) occupying the Grant Parish courthouse in Colfax.Eric Foner, Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863‚Äì1877, p. 437Ulysses S. Grant, People and Events: \\"The Colfax Massacre\\", PBS Website, accessed Apr 6, 2008 Most of the freedmen were killed after they surrendered; nearly 50 were killed later that night after being held as prisoners for several hours. Estimates of the number of dead have varied, ranging from 62 to 153; three whites died but the number of black victims was difficult to determine because many bodies were thrown into the Red River or removed for burial. There were rumors of mass graves at the site. Historian Eric Foner described the massacre as the worst instance of racial violence during Reconstruction. In Louisiana, it had the most fatalities of any of the numerous violent events following the disputed gubernatorial contest in 1872 between Republicans and Democrats. Foner wrote, \\"...every election [in Louisiana] between 1868 and 1876 was marked by rampant violence and pervasive fraud.\\"Eric Foner, Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877, New York: Perennial Library, 1989, p. 550 Although the Fusionist-dominated state \\"returning board,\\" which ruled on vote validity, initially declared John McEnery and his Democratic slate the winners, the board eventually split, with a faction declaring Republican William P. Kellogg the victor. A Republican federal judge in New Orleans ruled that the Republican-majority legislature be seated. Federal prosecution and conviction of a few perpetrators at Colfax under the Enforcement Acts was appealed to the Supreme Court. In a key case, the court ruled in United States v. Cruikshank (1876) that protections of the Fourteenth Amendment did not apply to the actions of individuals, but only to the actions of state governments. After this ruling, the federal government could no longer use the Enforcement Act of 1870 to prosecute actions by paramilitary groups such as the White League, which had chapters forming across Louisiana beginning in 1874. Intimidation, murders, and black voter suppression by such paramilitary groups were instrumental to the Democratic Party regaining political control in the state legislature by the late 1870s. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, historians have paid renewed attention to the events at Colfax and the resulting Supreme Court case, and their meaning in American history, including contemporary history. State and national background In March 1865, Unionist planter James Madison Wells became governor. As the Democratic- dominated legislature passed Black Codes that restricted rights of freedmen, Wells began to lean toward allowing blacks to vote and temporarily disenfranchising ex-Confederates. To accomplish this, he scheduled a new constitutional convention for July 30, 1866. It was postponed because of the New Orleans Massacre that day, in which armed Southern white Democrats attacked blacks who had a parade in support of the convention. Anticipating trouble, the mayor of New Orleans had asked the local military commander to police the city and protect the convention. The U. S. Army failed to promptly respond to the mayor's request and a group of numerous unarmed blacks was attacked by whites, resulting in 38 deaths: 34 black and four white; and more than 40 wounded, most of them black. When President Andrew Johnson blamed the massacre on Republican agitation, a popular national backlash against Johnson's policies led to national voters electing a majority Republican Congress in 1866. It passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866 over Andrew Johnson's veto. Earlier the Freedmen's Bureau and the occupation armies had prevented Southern Black Codes, which had limited the rights of freedmen and other blacks, (including their choices of work and living locations) from going into effect. On July 16, 1866, Congress extended the life of the Freedmen's Bureau, also over Johnson's veto. On March 2, 1867, they passed the Reconstruction Act, over Johnson's veto, which required that blacks be given the franchise‚Äîin Southern states but not in Northern states‚Äîand that reconstructed Southern states ratify the Fourteenth Amendment before admission to the Union. By April 1868, a biracial coalition in Louisiana had elected a Republican-majority state legislature but violence increased before the fall election. Almost all of the victims were black and some white Republicans who were protecting the black Republican freedmen. Insurgents also attacked men physically or burned their homes to discourage them from voting. President Johnson, a Democrat, prevented the Republican governor of Louisiana from using either the state militia or U.S. forces to suppress the insurgent groups, such as the Knights of the White Camelia. Background in Grant Parish The Red River area of Winn and Rapides parishes was a combination of large plantations and subsistence farmers; before the war, African Americans had worked as slaves on the plantations. William Smith Calhoun, a major planter, had inherited a plantation in the area. A former slaveholder, he lived with a mixed-race woman as his common-law wife and had come to support black political equality. On election day in November 1868, Calhoun led a group of freedmen to vote. The ballot box was originally at a store owned by John Hooe, who had threatened to whip freedmen \\"if they voted Republican\\". Calhoun arranged for the ballot box to be switched to a plantation store owned by a Republican. In addition, he oversaw the submission of 150 black votes from freedmen on his plantation land. The Republicans received 318 votes, and the Democrats received 49. A group of whites threw the ballot box into the Red River, and Democrats arrested Calhoun, alleging election fraud. With the original ballot box gone, Democrat Michael Ryan went on to claimed a landslide victory. Lane 2008, p. 41 The election was also marked by violence. Election commissioner Hal Frazier, a black Republican, was murdered by whites. Lane 2008, p. 41f After this, Calhoun drafted a bill to create a new parish out of parts of Winn and Rapides parishes, which passed the Republican legislature; as a major planter, Calhoun thought he would have more political influence in the new parish, which had a black majority. Other new parishes were created by the Republican state legislature to try to develop areas of Republican political support. Enforcement against the Klan According to Lane, after Ulysses S. Grant became President in 1869, he \\"lobbied hard for the Fifteenth Amendment\\" (ratified February 3, 1870), Lane 2008, p. 1f which guaranteed that blacks, most of whom were newly freed slaves, would have full citizenship and suffrage. The Ku Klux Klan (KKK), and other insurgent groups, continued violent attacks and killed scores of blacks in Arkansas, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi and elsewhere, Lane 2008, p. 3f to discourage their voting in the 1870 elections. On May 31, 1870, Congress passed an Enforcement Act based on the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments. Lane 2008, p. 4 They followed this with the Ku Klux Klan Act, enacted April 20, 1871, which Grant used to suspend the writ of habeas corpus and use the \\"army to round up Klansmen and present them for trial in federal court\\". Louisiana and Grant Parish Governor Henry Clay Warmoth struggled to maintain political balance in Louisiana. Among his appointments, he installed William Ward, a black Union veteran, as commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, a new unit to be based in Grant Parish to help control the violence there and in other Red River parishes. Ward, born a slave in 1840 in Charleston, South Carolina, had learned to read and write as a valet to a master in Richmond, Virginia. In 1864 he escaped and went to Fortress Monroe, where he joined the Union Army and served until after General Robert E. Lee's surrender. About 1870 he came to Grant Parish, where he had a friend. He quickly became active among local blacks in the Republican Party. After his appointment to the militia, Ward recruited other freedmen for his forces, several of whom were veterans of the war. Louisiana election of 1872 In Louisiana, Republican governor Henry Clay Warmoth defected from the Liberal Republicans (a group that opposed President Grant's Reconstruction) policies in 1872. Warmoth previously supported a constitutional amendment that allowed former Confederates, who had been denied the right to vote, to be re- enfranchised. A \\"Fusionist\\" coalition of Liberal Republicans and Democrats nominated ex-Confederate battalion commander and Democrat John McEnery to succeed him as governor. In return, Democrats and Liberal Republicans were to send Warmoth to Washington as a U.S. Senator. Opposing McEnery was Republican William Pitt Kellogg, one of Louisiana's U.S. Senators. Voting on November 4, 1872, resulted in dual governments, as a Fusionist (Liberal Republicans and Democrat)-dominated returning board declared McEnery the winner while a faction of the board proclaimed Kellogg the winner. Both administrations held inaugural ceremonies and certified their lists of local candidates. After failing to win their case in state court, the Kellogg forces appealed to federal judge Edward Durell in New Orleans to intervene and order that Kellogg and the Stalwart Republican-majority legislature were to be seated, and for Grant to authorize U.S. army troops to protect Kellogg's government. This action was widely criticized across the nation by Democrats and both wings of the Republican Party because it was considered to be a violation of the rights of states to manage their own (non-federal-office) elections. Thus, investigating committees of both chambers of the federal Congress in Washington were critical of the Kellogg choice. The House majority ruled Durell's action illegal and the Senate majority concluded that the Kellogg regime was \\"not much better than a successful conspiracy.\\" In 1874 a House investigating committee in Washington recommended that Judge Durell be impeached for corruption and illegally interfering in the Louisiana 1872 state elections, but the judge resigned in order to avoid impeachment.William Hesseltine, \\"Grant the Politician\\", 344Charles Lane, *The Green Bag*, \\"Edward Henry Durell,\\" 167-68 McEnery's faction tried to take control of the state arsenal at Jackson Square, but Kellogg had the state militia seize dozens of leaders of McEnery's faction and control New Orleans, where the state government was located. McEnery returned to try to take control with a private paramilitary group. In September 1873 his forces, over 8,000 strong, entered the city and defeated the city/state militia of about 3500 in New Orleans. The Democrats took control of the state house, armory and police stations, where the state government was then located, in what was known as the Battle of Jackson Square. His forces held those buildings for three days before retreating before Federal troops arrived. Warmoth was subsequently impeached by the state legislature in a bribery scandal stemming from his actions in the 1872 election. Warmoth appointed Democrats as parish registrars, and they ensured the voter rolls included as many whites and as few freedmen as possible. A number of registrars changed the registration site without notifying blacks. They also required blacks to prove they were over 21, while knowing that former slaves did not have birth certificates. In Grant Parish, one plantation owner threatened to expel blacks from homes they rented on his land if they voted Republican. Fusionists also tampered with ballot boxes on election day. One was found with a hole in it, apparently used for stuffing the ballot box. As a result, Grant Parish Fusionists claimed a landslide victory, even though black voters outnumbered whites by 776 to 630. Warmoth issued commissions to Fusionist Democrats Alphonse Cazabat and Christopher Columbus Nash, elected parish judge and sheriff, respectively. Like many white men in the South, Nash was a Confederate veteran (as an officer, he had been held for a year and a half as a prisoner of war at Johnson's Island in Ohio). Cazabat and Nash took their oaths of office in the Colfax courthouse on January 2, 1873. They dispatched the documents to Governor McEnery in New Orleans. William Pitt Kellogg issued commissions to the Republican slate for Grant Parish on January 17 and 18. By then Nash and Cazabat controlled the small, primitive courthouse. Republican Robert C. Register insisted that he, not Alphonse Cazabat, was the parish judge and that Republican Daniel Wesley Shaw, not Nash, was to be the sheriff. On the night of March 25, the Republicans seized the empty courthouse and took their oaths of office. They sent their oaths to the Kellogg administration in New Orleans. Grant Parish was one of a number of new parishes created by the Republican government in an effort to build local support in the state. Both the land and its people were originally tied to the Calhoun family, whose plantation had covered more than the borders of the new parish. The freedmen had been slaves on the plantation. The parish also took in the less-developed hill country. The total population had a narrow majority of 2400 freedmen, who mostly voted Republican, and 2200 whites, who voted as Democrats. Statewide political tensions were reflected in the rumors going around each community, often about white fears of black attacks or outrage, which added to local tensions.James K. Hogue, \\"The Battle of Colfax: Paramilitarism and Counterrevolution in Louisiana\\", 2006, accessed Aug 15, 2008 Colfax courthouse conflict Fearful that the Democrats might try to take over the local parish government, blacks started to create trenches around the courthouse and drilled to keep alert. The Republican officeholders stayed there overnight. They held the town for three weeks. On March 28, Nash, Cazabat, Hadnot and other white Fusionists called for armed whites to retake the courthouse on April 1. Whites were recruited from nearby Winn and surrounding parishes to join their effort. The Republicans Shaw, Register, and Flowers and others began to collect a posse of armed blacks to defend the courthouse. Black Republicans Lewis Meekins and state militia captain William Ward, a black Union veteran, raided the homes of the opposition leaders: Judge William R. Rutland, Bill Cruikshank, and Jim Hadnot. Gunfire erupted between whites and blacks on April 2 and again on April 5, but the shotguns were too inaccurate to do any harm. The two sides arranged for peace negotiations. Peace ended when a white man shot and killed a black man named Jesse McKinney, described as a bystander. Another armed conflict on April 6 ended with whites fleeing from armed blacks. Lane 2008, p. 154 With all the unrest in the community, black women and children joined the men at the courthouse for protection. William Ward, the commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, headquartered in Grant Parish, had been elected state representative from the parish on the Republican ticket. He wrote to Governor Kellogg seeking U.S. troops for reinforcement and gave the letter to William Smith Calhoun for delivery. Calhoun took the steamboat LaBelle down the Red River but was captured by Paul Hooe, Hadnot, and Cruikshank. They ordered Calhoun to tell blacks to leave the courthouse. The black defenders refused to leave although threatened by parties of armed whites commanded by Nash. To recruit men during the rising political tensions, Nash had contributed to lurid rumors that blacks were preparing to kill all the white men and take the white women as their own.Keith (2007), The Colfax Massacre, p. 117 On April 8 the anti-Republican Daily Picayune newspaper of New Orleans inflamed tensions and distorted events by the following headline: Such news attracted more whites from the region to Grant Parish to join Nash; all were experienced Confederate veterans. They acquired a four-pound cannon that could fire iron slugs. As the Klansman Dave Paul said, \\"Boys, this is a struggle for white supremacy.\\" Suffering from tuberculosis and rheumatism, on April 11 the militia captain Ward took a steamboat downriver to New Orleans to seek armed help directly from Kellogg. He was not there for the following events. Massacre Cazabat had directed Nash as sheriff to put down what he called a riot. Nash gathered an armed white paramilitary group and veteran officers from Rapides, Winn and Catahoula parishes. He did not move his forces toward the courthouse until noon on Easter Sunday, April 13. Nash led more than 300 armed white men, most on horseback and armed with rifles. Nash reportedly ordered the defenders of the courthouse to leave. When that failed, Nash gave women and children camped outside the courthouse thirty minutes to clear out. After they left, the shooting began. The fighting continued for several hours with few casualties. When Nash's paramilitary maneuvered the cannon behind the building, some of the defenders panicked and left the courthouse. About 60 defenders ran into nearby woods and jumped into the river. Nash sent men on horseback after the fleeing black Republicans, and his paramilitary group killed most of them on the spot. Soon Nash's forces directed a black captive to set the courthouse roof on fire. The defenders displayed white flags for surrender: one made from a shirt, the other from a page of a book. The shooting stopped. Nash's group approached and called for those surrendering to throw down their weapons and come outside. What happened next is in dispute. According to the reports of some whites, James Hadnot was shot and wounded by someone from the courthouse. \\"In the Negro version, the men in the courthouse were stacking their guns when the white men approached, and Hadnot was shot from behind by an overexcited member of his own force.\\"Nicholas Lemann, Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War, New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paperback, 2007, p.18 Hadnot died later, after being taken downstream by a passing steamboat.Lemann (2007), Redemption, p. 18 In the aftermath of Hadnot's shooting, the white paramilitary group reacted with mass murders of the black men. As more than 40 times as many blacks died as did whites, historians describe the event as a massacre. The white paramilitary group killed unarmed men trying to hide in the courthouse. They rode down and killed those attempting to flee. They dumped some bodies in the Red River. About 50 blacks survived the afternoon and were taken prisoner. Later that night they were summarily killed by their captors, who had been drinking. Only one black man from the group, Levi Nelson, survived. He was shot by Cruikshank but managed to crawl away unnoticed. He later served as one of the Federal government's chief witnesses against those who were indicted for the attacks. Kellogg sent state militia colonels Theodore DeKlyne and William Wright to Colfax with warrants to arrest 50 white men and to install a new, compromise slate of parish officers. DeKlyne and Wright found the smoking ruins of the courthouse at Colfax, and many bodies of men who had been shot in the back of the head or the neck. They described that one body was charred, another man's head beaten beyond recognition, and another had a slashed throat. Surviving blacks told DeKlyne and Wright that blacks dug a trench around the courthouse to protect it from what they saw as an attempt by white Democrats to steal an election. They were attacked by whites armed with rifles, revolvers and a small cannon. When blacks refused to leave, the courthouse was burned, and the black defenders were shot down. While the whites accused blacks of violating a flag of truce and rioting, black Republicans said that none of this was true. They accused whites of marching captured prisoners away in pairs and shooting them in the back of the head. On April 14 some of Governor Kellogg's new police force arrived from New Orleans. Several days later, two companies of Federal troops arrived. They searched for white paramilitary members, but many had already fled to Texas or the hills. The officers filed a military report in which they identified by name three whites and 105 blacks who had died, plus noted they had recovered 15-20 unidentified blacks from the river. They also noted the savage nature of many of the killings, suggesting an out-of-control situation.\\"Military Report on Colfax Riot, 1875\\", Congressional Record], accessed Apr 6, 2008 The exact number of dead was never established: two U.S. Marshals, who visited the site on April 15 and buried dead, reported 62 fatalities; a military report to Congress in 1875 identified 81 black men by name who had been killed,Find a grave memorial on the Colfax Massacre has 80 names listed and also estimated that between 15 and 20 bodies had been thrown into the Red River, and another 18 were secretly buried, for a grand total of \\"at least 105\\"; a state historical marker from 1950 noted fatalities as three whites and 150 blacks. The historian Eric Foner, a specialist in the Civil War and Reconstruction, wrote about the event: > \\"The organization against them is too strong. ...\\" Louisiana black teacher > and Reconstruction legislator John G. Lewis later remarked. \\"They attempted > [armed self-defense] in Colfax. The result was that on Easter Sunday of 1873 > when the sun went down that night, it went down on the corpses of two > hundred and eighty negroes.\\" Aftermath James Roswell Beckwith, the US Attorney based in New Orleans, sent an urgent telegram about the massacre to the U.S. Attorney General. The massacre in Colfax gained headlines of national newspapers from Boston to Chicago. Various government forces spent weeks trying to round up members of the white paramilitaries, and a total of 97 men were indicted. In the end, Beckwith charged nine men and brought them to trial for violations of the Enforcement Act of 1870. It had been designed to provide federal protection for civil rights of freedmen under the 14th Amendment against actions by terrorist groups such as the Klan. The men were charged with one murder, and charges related to a conspiracy against the rights of freedmen. There were two succeeding trials in 1874. William Burnham Woods presided over the first trial and was sympathetic to the prosecution. Had the men been convicted, they would not have been able to appeal their decision to any appellate court according to the laws of the time. However, Beckworth was unable to secure a conviction‚Äîone man was acquitted, and a mistrial was declared in the cases of the other eight. In the second trial, three men were found guilty of sixteen charges. However, the presiding judge, Joseph Bradley of the United States Supreme Court (riding circuit), dismissed the convictions, ruling that the charges violated the state actor doctrine, failed to prove a racial rationale for the massacre, or were void for vagueness. Sua sponte, he ordered that the men be released on bail, and they promptly disappeared.Nicholas Lemann, Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War, New York; Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2006, p.25 When the federal government appealed the case, it was heard by the US Supreme Court as United States v. Cruikshank (1875). The Supreme Court ruled that the Enforcement Act of 1870 (which was based on the Bill of Rights and 14th Amendment) applied only to actions committed by the state and that it did not apply to actions committed by individuals or private conspiracies (See, Morrison Remick Waite). This meant that the Federal government could not prosecute cases such as the Colfax killings. The court said plaintiffs who believed their rights were abridged had to seek protection from the state. Louisiana did not prosecute any of the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre; most southern states would not prosecute white men for attacks against freedmen. Thus, enforcement of criminal sanctions under the act ended. The publicity about the Colfax Massacre and subsequent Supreme Court ruling encouraged the growth of white paramilitary organizations. In May 1874, Nash formed the first chapter of the White League from his paramilitary group, and chapters soon were formed in other areas of Louisiana, as well as the southern parts of nearby states. Unlike the former KKK, they operated openly and often curried publicity. One historian described them as \\"the military arm of the Democratic Party.\\"George C. Rable, But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132 Other paramilitary groups such as the Red Shirts also arose, especially in South Carolina and Mississippi, which also had black majorities of population, and in certain counties in North Carolina. Paramilitary groups used violence and murder to terrorize leaders among the freedmen and white Republicans, as well as to repress voting among freedmen during the 1870s. Black American citizens had little recourse. In August 1874, for instance, the White League threw out Republican officeholders in Coushatta, Red River Parish, assassinating the six whites before they left the state, and killing five to 15 freedmen who were witnesses. Four of the white men killed were related to the state representative from the area.Eric Foner (2002),Reconstruction, p. 551 Such violence served to intimidate voters and officeholders; it was one of the methods that white Democrats used to gain control of the state legislature in the 1876 elections and ultimately to dismantle Reconstruction in Louisiana. Memorials The scale of the massacre and the political conflict it represents are of state and national significance in relation to Reconstruction and United States racial histories. Despite this, the event has been hidden in local history for decades. Moreover, the site has changed: some of the areas have been paved, and the old courthouse was torn down and a new courthouse was built. Finally, without archeological work to establish where victims were buried at the site, people have had difficulty defining a site to gain approval for a historic memorial. In 1920, a committee met in Colfax to purchase a monument to memorialize the three white men who died. This monument stands in Colfax Cemetery and reads \\"Erected to the memory of the Heroes, / Stephen Decatur Parish / James West Hadnot / Sidney Harris / Who fell in the Colfax Riot fighting for White Supremacy.\\" In 1950, Louisiana erected a state highway marker noting the event of 1873 as \\"the Colfax Riot,\\" as the event was traditionally called in the white community. The marker states, \\"On this site occurred the Colfax Riot, in which three white men and 150 negroes were slain. This event on April 13, 1873, marked the end of carpetbag misrule in the South.\\"Keith (2007), Colfax Massacre, p. 169 Renewed attention The Colfax massacre is among the events of Reconstruction and late 19th-century history which have received new national attention in the early 21st century, much as the 1923 massacre in Rosewood, Florida did near the end of the 20th century. In 2007 and 2008 two new books were published on the topic: Leeanna Keith's The Colfax Massacre: The Untold Story of Black Power, White Terror, and the Death of Reconstruction, and Charles Lane's The Day Freedom Died: The Colfax Massacre, the Supreme Court, and the Betrayal of Reconstruction. Lane especially addressed the political and legal implications of the Supreme Court case, which arose out of the prosecution of several men of the white paramilitary groups. In addition, a film documentary is in preparation. In 2007 the Red River Heritage Association, Inc. was formed as a group intending to establish a museum in Colfax for collecting materials and interpreting the history of Reconstruction in Louisiana and especially the Red River area. In 2008, on the 135th anniversary of the Colfax massacre, an interracial group commemorated the event. They laid flowers where some victims had fallen and held a forum to discuss the history.LeeAnna Keith, \\"History is a Gift: The Colfax Massacre\\", Blog: Oxford University Press, 17 Apr 2008; accessed 13 Aug 2008 See also *List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States *List of massacres in Louisiana Notes References  Goldman, Robert M., Reconstruction & Black Suffrage: Losing the Vote in Reese & Cruikshank, Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2001. * Hogue, James K., Uncivil War: Five New Orleans Street Battle and the Rise and Fall of Radical Reconstruction, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2006.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Senators, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago White Sox, during his 23-year MLB career. Wynn was identified as one of the most intimidating pitchers in the game, having combined his powerful fastball with a hard attitude toward batters. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972. Wynn signed with the Senators at the age of 17, deciding to forgo completing his high school education to begin pursuing a baseball career. He spent three seasons in Minor League Baseball (MiLB) before achieving his first MLB stint in 1939. Wynn returned to the big leagues two years later and in 1942 pitched his first full MLB season. The following year, he won 18 games for the Senators. Drafted into the military in 1944, Wynn missed all of 1945 and a portion of the 1946 season while serving in the United States Army during World War II. He spent all of 1947 and 1948 with the Senators before getting traded to the Indians after the 1948 season. With Cleveland, Wynn was a member of what historian David Fleitz called \\"one of the greatest pitching rotations of all time,\\" along with Bob Feller, Mike Garcia, and Bob Lemon. Pitching coach Mel Harder taught him a curveball, slider, and knuckleball, which Wynn credited with helping him become a better pitcher in the 1950s. He won 20 or more games in four of his seasons with the Indians, helping them set an American League (AL) record with 111 total wins in 1954. He started Game 2 of the 1954 World Series, which the New York Giants won in four games. In 1955, he was selected to his first of eight straight All-Star Games. Traded to the White Sox after the 1957 season, Wynn won the 1959 Cy Young Award, leading the AL with 22 wins as the team won the AL pennant. In Game 1 of the 1959 World Series, Wynn struck out six in seven innings, allowing no runs as the White Sox won 11‚Äì0. He made two other starts in the Series but failed to pitch past the fourth inning in either, as the Los Angeles Dodgers won the series in six games. Towards the end of his career, Wynn began to rely more heavily on the knuckleball, as the velocity of his pitches declined. The White Sox released him after the 1962 season, but Wynn signed with the Indians in 1963 because he was determined to win 300 games. He picked up his 300th victory against the Kansas City Athletics on July 13, his last major league win, though he remained on the roster for the rest of the season. As of August 2020, he is one of 23 MLB pitchers to win 300 games. After his retirement as a player, Wynn served as a pitching coach for the Indians from 1964‚Äì66 and the Minnesota Twins from 1967‚Äì69. He later served as a broadcaster for the Toronto Blue Jays and White Sox. Wynn lived in Nokomis, Florida, for many years, operating the Early Wynn Steak House and Bowling Lanes in Venice, Florida, during the 1960s. In 1999, he was included on The Sporting News list of the 100 greatest players in baseball history. Wynn died that year in an assisted living facility following heart-related problems and a stroke. Early life Wynn was born January 6, 1920, in Hartford, Alabama, the son of Blanche Wynn and Early Wynn Sr., an automobile mechanic and former semi-professional baseball player. Wynn described his ancestry as being Scottish, Irish, and Cherokee; sportswriter Lew Freedman speculates that Wynn was no more than Cherokee. As a youth, Wynn lifted 500-pound bales of cotton one summer for 10 cents an hour; the experience left him determined to make a different living for himself. Excelling at both football and baseball, Wynn was about to become the top running back at Geneva County High School as a sophomore, but he suffered a broken leg on a punt return that year. The injury forced him out of football and focused his attention on baseball. Wynn later described it as \\"my best break ever.\\" When he was a teenager, Wynn attended a tryout session in Florida for the Washington Senators. He impressed Senators coach Clyde Milan enough that the organization offered him a minor league contract. Wynn signed with Washington for $100 per month and decided not to finish high school. Between 1937 and 1939, Wynn pitched minor league baseball in the Florida State League and the Piedmont League. MLB career Washington Senators (1939, 1941‚Äì1944, 1946‚Äì1948) Wynn made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut in 1939, when he was a September callup by the Senators. He threw a complete game in his first outing on September 13, allowing four runs (three earned) in a 4‚Äì2 loss to the Chicago White Sox. Wynn made three starts, posting an 0‚Äì2 record and a 5.75 earned run average (ERA) before returning to the minor leagues for 1940 and most of 1941. David Fleitz of the Society for American Baseball Research wrote, \\"Wynn was not yet ready for major-league action.\\" He made it back to the major leagues in 1941, when he was again a September callup. In his first start of the year, the second game of a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Athletics, he gave up two runs and six hits, earning his first major league win in a 4‚Äì2 Senator victory. He started five games this time, completing four of them and finishing with a 3‚Äì1 record and a 1.58 ERA. In 1942, Wynn was named to Washington's four-man pitching rotation and spent the whole season in the major leagues for the first time. He threw a shutout on April 30 against the White Sox, allowing the Senators to win by scoring just one run. In the second game of a doubleheader against the New York Yankees on September 6, he gave up several runs‚Äì11, though only five were earned. The Senators lost 15‚Äì2. He pitched 30 games that season, finishing with a 10‚Äì16 record and a 5.12 ERA. The 16 losses ranked fifth in the American League (AL). Wynn opened the 1943 season as the number two starter in the Senators' rotation, behind Dutch Leonard. On April 27, he threw 13 scoreless innings but received a no decision as Philadelphia defeated the Senators 2‚Äì1 in 16 innings. Against the Cleveland Indians on July 10, he allowed only four hits and threw a shutout in a 4‚Äì0 victory. He pitched innings on August 18, losing the game 3‚Äì2 in the 14th to the White Sox when Guy Curtright singled to drive in a run; however, the two runs Wynn had allowed earlier were unearned. Four days later, in the second game of a doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns, Wynn hit his first major league home run against Bob Muncrief. He was less successful on the mound, allowing seven runs in six innings as the Browns won 8‚Äì5. On September 10, he held Philadelphia to three hits in a 5‚Äì0 victory. In the first game of a doubleheader against the Yankees on September 19, Wynn gave up two runs in 10 innings as the Senators won 3‚Äì2. In 37 games, he finished 18‚Äì12 with a 2.91 ERA and 89 strikeouts, leading the AL with 33 starts. Wynn finished 18th in AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting. On April 20, 1944, Wynn threw a two-hit shutout against the Philadelphia Athletics. He held the Indians to three runs (two earned) over 13 innings on May 26 in a 5‚Äì3 victory. On June 18, he threw a four-hit shutout against the Boston Red Sox in a 1‚Äì0 victory. He had a 6‚Äì7 record entering June 29 but would lose 10 decisions in a row starting from that date and lasting through August 13, when he finally won another game. One of those losses in the second game of a doubleheader on July 4 came after Wynn had held the White Sox to two runs in 11 innings; he gave up a third run in the 12th, and Chicago defeated Washington by a score of 3‚Äì2. Though his season ended in late August, he led the league in losses in 1944, compiling an 8‚Äì17 record and a 3.38 ERA. Wynn's 1944 season ended early, as he joined the United States Army on August 21. He underwent 17 weeks of training at Fort Knox before going to the Philippines to serve in the Tank Corps during World War II. Though he missed the 1945 major league season, Wynn continued to play baseball, pitching for a Pacific Army team known as the Manila Dodgers. Returning to the United States in June of 1946, Wynn was able to resume pitching for the Senators on July 16. He pitched 11 innings against the Yankees in the first game of a doubleheader on September 8, allowing only one run (unearned) and earning the victory in Washington's 2‚Äì1 triumph. In 17 games that year, he finished with an 8‚Äì5 record and a 3.11 ERA. In 1947, Wynn was the Senators' Opening Day starter. He came within one out of completing the first game he won that season on April 23, getting relieved by Tom Ferrick with two outs in the ninth inning but still earning the win in a 4‚Äì3 triumph over Philadelphia. On June 5, he shut out the Indians in a 3‚Äì0 victory. Wynn was selected to the 1947 AL All-Star team for the first time as a replacement for an injured Bob Feller, but he did not pitch in the AL's 2‚Äì1 victory. In the first game of a doubleheader on July 10, he gave up 10 hits but threw a shutout in a 4‚Äì0 victory over the White Sox. On July 22, he gave up only two hits and one run (unearned) in a 6‚Äì1 victory over the Detroit Tigers. He pitched 33 games that year and earned a decision in almost every game, totaling 17 wins with 15 losses and a 3.64 ERA. After the season, he finished 23rd in AL MVP voting. Wynn made the Opening Day start again for the Senators in 1948 but gave up 12 runs (10 earned) over innings in a 12‚Äì4 loss to the Senators. On May 6, he limited Cleveland to three hits in a shutout as the Senators beat the Indians by a score of 5‚Äì0. He had a 7‚Äì7 record through the end of June but only won one more game the rest of the season (against the Indians on August 29), losing 12 games and posting a 6.96 ERA in the season's second half. In 1948, Wynn was the victim of inconsistency, posting an 8‚Äì19 record and a 5.82 ERA. He gave up a league-high 128 earned runs, and his 19 losses were third in the league (behind Fred Sanford's 21 and Bill Wight's 20). When hitting, though, he had a career-high 16 runs batted in (RBI). During the offseason, the Senators made Wynn available for trade. The Boston Red Sox offered Johnny Pesky to Washington for Wynn in November, but the trade did not go through. However, Bill Veeck, who owned the Indians, had been trying to acquire Wynn since before the 1948 season. In December, Wynn and Mickey Vernon were sent to the Cleveland Indians in exchange for Joe Haynes, Ed Klieman and Eddie Robinson. Cleveland Indians (1949‚Äì1957) The Indians were excited about Wynn's potential, but they felt he needed more pitches to be truly successful. Though he threw a changeup, Wynn relied almost exclusively on his fastball and did not have any other pitches available at his disposal. Pitching coach Mel Harder, a four-time All-Star with the Indians in the 1930s, taught Wynn how to throw a curveball, slider, and knuckleball; Wynn had the curveball and slider \\"mastered\\" by the middle of the 1949 season, according to Fleitz. \\"I could throw the ball when I came here [to Cleveland],‚Äù remembered Wynn, ‚Äúbut Mel made a pitcher out of me.\\" With Cleveland, he developed into a key part of what Fleitz called \\"one of the greatest pitching rotations of all time,\\" joining Feller, Bob Lemon and Mike Garcia. Cleveland manager Al L√≥pez later called those four pitchers \\"the greatest pitching staff I ever saw during 33 years in the majors.\\" Wynn pitched all 11 innings of a game against the White Sox on May 28, allowing two runs as the Indians prevailed 3‚Äì2. On June 3, Wynn held the Red Sox to four hits and one run as the Indians prevailed 8‚Äì1. Interestingly, though he was perfecting his new pitches as the 1949 season wore on, Wynn had more success earlier in the year. He had a 7‚Äì1 record with a 3.60 ERA through July 17; thereafter, he posted a 4‚Äì6 record with a 4.62 ERA. On August 2, he held his former team to one run in an 8‚Äì1 victory. Wynn's 23 starts were his fewest in a season not interrupted by military service since 1941; he posted an 11‚Äì7 record and a 4.15 ERA. By 1950, Wynn was the number two starter in Cleveland's rotation, behind Lemon and ahead of Feller (third). From June 16 through July 9, he won six straight appearances, including a game on July 9 in which he pitched five shutout innings of relief. Wynn struck out a season-high 11 batters on July 6 in a 5‚Äì2 win over the White Sox. He limited the Tigers to two runs over 10 innings on August 14 in a 3‚Äì2 victory. Five days later, he held the White Sox to three hits and no runs in a 1‚Äì0 triumph. He shut out the White Sox again in his last start of the year on September 26, allowing six hits in a 2‚Äì0 victory. In 1950, he recorded 18 wins and led the AL with a 3.20 ERA. Wynn also surpassed the 100-strikeout mark for the first time, finishing the year with 143. 1950 was the first of seven straight seasons in which Wynn would win at least 17 games. On April 18, 1951, Wynn held the Tigers to two runs in 10 innings, earning the win in a 4‚Äì2 victory. Though he had a 3.62 ERA through June 17, Wynn's record was merely 4‚Äì8; he won 16 games after that date to earn his first 20-win season. On July 14, he held the Yankees to two hits and threw a shutout in an 8‚Äì0 victory. Five days later, Boston scored four runs against him in 11 innings, but Cleveland rallied from a 4‚Äì3 deficit in the 11th to win 5‚Äì4. In the first game of a doubleheader on August 19, he shut out the White Sox in a 4‚Äì0 victory. On August 28, he held the Athletics scoreless in a 1‚Äì0 victory. The victory started a streak of six straight decisions won by Wynn, lasting until his loss to the White Sox on September 25. Wynn tied for the AL lead in starts (34) and led the league with innings pitched, finishing tied for fourth with 20 wins (along with Ned Garver and teammate Garcia), third in ERA (3.02, behind Saul Rogovin's 2.78 and Eddie Lopat's 2.91), and second in strikeouts (133, behind only Vic Raschi's 164). He finished 16th in AL MVP voting. Bowman set Wynn made his first Opening Day start as an Indian in 1952. He held Boston to four hits on June 5, striking out eight batters as the Indians won 5‚Äì0. In the first game of a doubleheader against Detroit on July 4, he allowed just two hits as Cleveland won 11‚Äì0. Wynn was 16‚Äì9 through August 15, but he lost three appearances in a row to fall to 16‚Äì12 on August 24. He would not lose another game in 1952, winning all seven of his final starts. On September 5, he held the White Sox to four hits in a 3‚Äì0 victory. He shut out the Red Sox again on September 12, holding them to three hits in a 5‚Äì0 triumph. Wynn finished the year among AL leaders in several categories. He allowed the most home runs (23) and walks (132) of any AL pitcher, but his 2.90 ERA ranked tenth. His 23 wins ranked second to Bobby Shantz's 24, and his 153 strikeouts were topped only by Allie Reynolds's 160. This season, Wynn finished fifth in AL MVP voting. In 1953, Wynn was the fourth starter in the Indians' rotation. In the first game of a doubleheader against the Senators on May 3, he allowed just three hits in a 7‚Äì0 shutout victory, striking out eight and also hitting a home run against Connie Marrero. On June 28, he held the Yankees to three hits and one run, hitting a home run against Tom Gorman in a 4‚Äì1 victory over the Yankees. Against the Yankees again on July 23, he struck out seven and allowed two runs in a 10‚Äì2 victory. He recorded 10 strikeouts in eight innings against the Red Sox on September 1, allowing three runs as the Indians won 13‚Äì3. In 36 games (34 starts), he had a 17‚Äì12 record and a 3.93 ERA. His 17 wins ranked ninth in the AL, and his 138 strikeouts ranked third (behind Billy Pierce's 186 and Virgil Trucks's 149). Wynn made the Opening Day start for the Indians in 1954, his last of two he would make during his tenure with the team. On May 1, he held the Yankees to two runs and drove in two runs himself with an RBI single against Gorman as the Indians prevailed 10‚Äì2. Wynn held the Tigers to two hits on May 28 in a 3‚Äì0 victory. On July 15, he held the Athletics to three hits in a 4‚Äì0 shutout victory. He threw a second shutout against Detroit on August 18, allowing six hits in a 4‚Äì0 victory. In the second game of a doubleheader against New York on September 12, he struck out 12 Yankees in a 3‚Äì2 victory. Wynn finished the season with a 2.73 ERA (fourth in the AL), won 23 games (most in the AL) and struck out 155 batters (second to Bob Turley's 185). He led the AL in starts and innings pitched and finished sixth in MVP voting. The Indians won 111 regular season games during 1954, breaking an AL record previously held by the 1927 New York Yankees and earning Wynn his first playoff appearance. In the 1954 World Series against the New York Giants, Wynn started Game 2. He allowed three runs in seven innings, as the Giants defeated the Indians 3‚Äì1. That was Wynn's only appearance in the series, as the Giants won four straight games against Cleveland. Bowman set Afflicted by pneumonia to begin the 1955 season, Wynn did not earn his first win until May. On May 22, he threw a shutout against the Tigers, allowing just one hit when Fred Hatfield singled in the fourth inning. On June 22, he struck out 10 batters in a 5‚Äì0 shutout victory over the Baltimore Orioles. Four days later, in the first game of a doubleheader, he recorded eight strikeouts and allowed just three hits in a 5‚Äì0 victory over the Yankees. On July 1, he threw a third shutout in a row as the Indians defeated the White Sox 1‚Äì0. He was an All-Star for the second time in his career and pitched three scoreless innings in the game. This selection marked the start of eight consecutive All-Star Games he would be selected to over the next six seasons. He finished the 1955 season with a 17‚Äì11 record and a 2.82 ERA. Wynn's 17 wins were tied with Turley for fourth in the AL (three pitchers had 18), his 2.82 ERA was third (behind Pierce's 1.97 and Whitey Ford's 2.63), and his 122 strikeouts ranked seventh. Also, his six shutouts were tied with Pierce and Turley for second, behind Billy Hoeft's seven. That season, Wynn began writing a column for The Cleveland News entitled The Wynn Mill, he did it without any assistance from ghostwriters despite the fact that he had never finished high school. He gave his opinions concerning everything from umpires to Indians coaches, to the frustration of Indians' general manager Hank Greenberg. Wynn donated his payment for the column to the Elks Club in Nokomis, Florida, where he lived during the offseason. Wynn threw a shutout against the Yankees on June 8, 1956, allowing five hits in a 9‚Äì0 victory. He shut out the Red Sox on June 21, limiting them to four hits in a 5‚Äì0 victory. On July 18, he was struck in the face by a sharp line drive off the bat of Senators shortstop Jose Valdivielso. Replaced by Hank Aguirre on the mound, Wynn lost seven teeth from the impact. The facial wound required 16 stitches. He was pitching again four days later, holding the Orioles to six hits in an 8‚Äì0 shutout. On July 31, he shut out the Yankees for the second time that year, allowing three hits in a 5‚Äì0 victory. He picked up his 20th win of the year with a ten-inning effort against the Kansas City Athletics in a 4‚Äì1 victory. His 20 wins put him in a five-way tie for second in the AL, behind Frank Lary's 21. Wynn finished third in ERA (2.72, behind Ford's 2.47 and teammate Herb Score's 2.53) and seventh with 153 strikeouts. In AL MVP voting, Wynn ranked 13th. In the first game of a doubleheader against the Tigers on April 28, 1957, Wynn took the loss but allowed just two runs and struck out a season-high 10 hitters. He struck out nine Yankees on June 27 in a 2‚Äì0 shutout. Seven days later, he had nine strikeouts again, allowing three hits and one unearned run in a 3‚Äì1 triumph over Detroit in the first game of a doubleheader. He struck out nine hitters on August 3 as well but gave up 10 hits and four runs in seven innings of a 5‚Äì3 loss to the Yankees. Wynn led the AL with 37 starts, but the 1957 season was his first losing season with Cleveland. His record was just 14‚Äì17, and his ERA of 4.31 was his highest as an Indian. He led the league in strikeouts (with a career-high 184), but he also led the league in hits (270) and earned runs (126) allowed. After the season, Wynn and Al Smith were traded to the Chicago White Sox for Minnie Mi√±oso and Hatfield. The trade reunited him with L√≥pez, who had managed him with the Indians through the 1956 season. Chicago White Sox (1958‚Äì1962) Wynn's new contract with the White Sox forbade him from writing for newspapers (thus ending The Wynn Mill), but his salary was raised to make up for lost revenue. In his first start against Cleveland since the trade, Wynn threw a two-hit shutout on May 9, 1958. He held the Orioles scoreless on May 23, the necessary total for the White Sox to prevail 1‚Äì0. On June 19, he gave up just two hits against Boston in a 4‚Äì0 victory. He threw another two-hit shutout on August 31 in a 3‚Äì0 victory over Detroit. He had a winning record on September 9 but lost three of his final four starts to finish the year with a 14‚Äì16 record. In 1958, Wynn became the first MLB pitcher to lead his league in strikeouts in consecutive years with different teams (184 with Cleveland, 189 with Chicago). His ERA was 4.13. Fleitz writes that in 1959, \\"everything clicked for both Wynn and the White Sox.\\" He began relying further on the knuckleball, since his fastball was losing velocity. \\"For years they've been accusing me of throwing it when I didn't even know how to hold it ... I can't throw as hard as I did six, seven years ago. And I get tired quicker. I find that you can throw the knuckler with a little more effort and no strain\\", Wynn said. On May 1, Wynn became the second pitcher in major league history to win a game 1‚Äì0 while recording at least ten strikeouts and hitting a home run; Red Ruffing had done the same for the Yankees in 1932. He also allowed just one hit to Boston in the game. Wynn served as the starting pitcher in the first All-Star Game of the year on July 7, allowing one run in three innings and receiving a no-decision as the National League defeated the AL 5‚Äì4. He threw back-to-back shutouts on August 9 (second game of a doubleheader) and August 13, allowing three hits in each as the White Sox won both games 9‚Äì0. On September 8, he pitched 10 innings, allowing two runs to the Athletics as Chicago prevailed 3‚Äì2. Facing the Indians on September 22, Wynn picked up his 21st win, a victory that clinched the AL pennant for the White Sox. Wynn won the Cy Young Award in 1959 at the age of 39, posting a record of 22‚Äì10, with 179 strikeouts and a 3.17 ERA. He became the third-oldest MLB pitcher to win 20 games in a season, following Cy Young and Grover Cleveland Alexander. Wynn's 22 wins led the AL, his 3.17 ERA ranked ninth, his 179 strikeouts were third (behind Jim Bunning's 201 and Camilo Pascual's 179), his innings pitched led the league, and his 37 starts tied Paul Foytack for most in the AL. He also ranked second in shutouts with five, one fewer than Pascual's total. Wynn was third in AL MVP voting, trailing teammates Nellie Fox and Luis Aparicio. Wynn was \\"magnificent\\" in Game 1 of the 1959 World Series, according to Sports Illustrated. He allowed no runs, merely singles, to the Los Angeles Dodgers for seven innings before exiting because the cold weather was affecting his elbow; the White Sox defeated Los Angeles 11‚Äì0. In Game 4, he kept the Dodgers scoreless for the first two innings but allowed four runs (three earned) in the third inning before getting replaced with two outs by Turk Lown; the Dodgers won that game 5‚Äì4, though Wynn had a no-decision. He gave up a two-run home run to Duke Snider in the third inning of Game 6, then allowed three runs in the fourth inning, taking the loss in the 9‚Äì3 defeat as the Dodgers clinched the Series victory in six games. In the first game of a doubleheader on May 15, 1960, Wynn shut out the Indians, limiting them to five hits in a 4‚Äì0 triumph. He lost five straight decisions from May 25 through June 18, but he won 11 of his next 15. In 1960, Wynn was selected to the All-Star Games for his seventh and last year, pitching two scoreless innings in the second All- Star Game, which the AL lost 6‚Äì0. On August 19, he shut out the Athletics, allowing seven hits as Chicago defeated Kansas City by a score of 10‚Äì0. His final two wins of the season were shutouts thrown within 12 days of each other in September, the first coming in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Boston on September 11. He finished the 1960 season with a 13‚Äì12 record (his fewest wins since 1949), a 3.49 ERA, and 158 strikeouts, the third-highest total in the AL (behind Bunning's 201 and Pedro Ramos's 160). Wynn also tied Ford and Jim Perry for the AL lead in shutouts, with four. Wynn struck out a season-high seven batters in back-to-back wins on May 12 and May 16, 1961. He held Baltimore scoreless and pitched seven shutout innings with six strikeouts on July 22 but received a no-decision; the White Sox won 7‚Äì4. In 1961, Wynn was 8‚Äì2 but his season ended after the start against the Orioles because his gout, which had affected him since 1950, finally became too much for him to pitch through. He had 64 strikeouts and a 3.51 ERA. Wynn missed the rest of the season, even giving up eating meat in an attempt to get the ailment under control. By 1962, Wynn had started pitching mainly with the slider and the knuckleball. By that season, he was the oldest player in the AL. Facing the Indians on May 28, he threw a three-hit shutout as Chicago won 2‚Äì0. His next win (over a month later) was also a shutout, when he struck out eight batters and allowed only five hits in a 7‚Äì0 victory over Cleveland. 24 days later, Wynn had another shutout in a five-hit, 6‚Äì0 victory over the Washington Senators. He pitched to a 7‚Äì15 record in 1962, with a 4.46 ERA (his highest since 1948) and just 91 strikeouts. The 15 losses were tied with Don Schwall's total for fourth in the AL, and his 4.46 ERA was 0.49 over the league average. Thinking he was finished, the White Sox released him after the season. 1963: The pursuit of win #300 Wynn, however, had picked up his 299th victory before the end of 1962, and he was determined to get to 300 career wins. He attended spring training with the White Sox in 1963 but failed to make the team. Several teams offered him one-game contracts, but Wynn held out for a full-time deal, which he got from the Indians on June 21. Cleveland then added him to the starting rotation to give him the opportunities he needed. He failed to win in his first three starts with the Indians that year, and the nine months and seven starts that had elapsed from 1962‚Äì63 are still, as of August 2020, the longest gap between any pitcher's 299th and 300th wins in MLB history. The night before his fourth start of the year, against the Athletics on July 13, Wynn struggled to sleep due to gout-related pain. In that outing, Wynn finally picked up the milestone. Opposing Kansas City batter Ed Charles recalled Wynn's performance: \\"His fastball, if it reached 80, that was stretching it. He was laboring, throwing nothing but bloopers and junk.\\" He left the game with a 5‚Äì4 lead after pitching five innings. \\"Jerry Walker relieved me and saved the game for me. He was my roommate and pitched like a man possessed\\", Wynn recalled. Long after his retirement, which came at the end of the 1963 season, Wynn reflected on his 300th win and said that he was not proud of the milestone. \\"If I had pitched a good game and gone nine innings, that would be something. But that's not the way it was\\", Wynn said. He is one of only 23 pitchers to win 300 games, as of August 2020. Following the 300th win, Wynn made just one more start, a 3‚Äì2 win over Kansas City on July 27 (though Wynn received a no-decision because he was removed from the game in the fifth inning). He did make several relief appearances for the Indians before the end of the season. His last of these came on September 13, when he entered a game against the Los Angeles Angels in relief of Jack Kralick with two outs in the sixth inning but runners on first and second. Wynn gave up an RBI single to Jim Fregosi, then got Charlie Dees to line out to shortstop to end the inning. Lifted in favor of pinch-hitter Willie Kirkland in the bottom of the inning, Wynn had pitched his last game. In 20 games (five starts), Wynn had a 1‚Äì2 record, a 2.28 ERA, and 29 strikeouts. After the season, he retired. Legacy Wynn approached the game with passion, sometimes throwing chairs in frustration after losses. He also hated getting removed from games, once throwing a baseball at L√≥pez when the manager walked to the mound to remove him (though Wynn apologized to L√≥pez after the game). First afflicted by gout in 1950, he endured pain through much of the second half of his career. Nevertheless, he was the first player to pitch at least 23 seasons in the major leagues, and he appeared in games over four decades. His durability helped him lead the AL in innings three times (1951, 1954, 1959) and propelled him to an AL record for most years pitched (23). Wynn won an even 300 games, 23rd most by any major leaguer. He registered five 20-win seasons, 2,334 strikeouts, 290 complete games, 49 shutouts, and 4,556 innings pitched in 691 games. In the 1950s, Wynn had more strikeouts (1,544) than any other pitcher in the major leagues. He was quite capable with the bat as well. A switch hitter, Wynn batted .214 (365-for-1,704), with 17 home runs and 173 RBI. His 90 pinch-hit appearances included a grand slam (which he hit with the Senators on September 15, 1946), making him one of five MLB pitchers to record a grand slam as a pinch-hitter. As of August 2020, Wynn still ranks among the Indians' career leaders in many categories. He is fifth in wins (164), tied for fourth in strikeouts (1,277, equal to Lemon's total), seventh in shutouts (24), and seventh in total games started (296). In 1999, The Sporting News ranked Wynn number 100 on their list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. Later life Wynn remained with the Indians following retirement, becoming their pitching coach in 1964. Several of his players ‚Äì including Sam McDowell, Sonny Siebert, Luis Tiant and Steve Hargan ‚Äì were still with the team in 1967 when they set a record for team strikeouts in a season with 1189. In August 1965, Wynn flirted with the idea of making a comeback as a knuckleball pitcher. Wynn left Cleveland after the 1966 season and joined the Minnesota Twins as pitching coach. He later served as a minor league manager for the Twins. Off the field, Wynn advocated for better pensions for retired baseball players. Wynn proposed the idea of a one-game comeback to the Twins in 1970. In 1972, the Twins considered activating the 52-year-old Wynn to pitch one inning if retired star Ted Williams would hit against him. The move would have made Wynn the first player to pitch in five different decades, but Williams was not interested and the team dropped the idea. Williams called him \\"the toughest pitcher I ever faced.\\" In 1972, Wynn was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame along with Sandy Koufax and Yogi Berra. He was disappointed that he had not received the required votes on his first three ballots, but he was grateful for the honor. \\"I'd been hoping for it, but I didn't want to build up my hopes too high,\\" he said. \\"It's like being placed up there on a pedestal, not like getting a gold watch for your longtime efforts. It's recognition I was waiting for for a long time.\\" From their inaugural 1977 season through the end of the 1981 season, Wynn provided the color commentary for radio broadcasts of Toronto Blue Jays games, working alongside Tom Cheek. He also provided color commentary for Chicago White Sox radio broadcasts in 1982 and 1983, paired with Joe McConnell. When he was replaced by Lorn Brown in December 1983, White Sox president Eddie Einhorn described Wynn as \\"a link to baseball's past.\\" In the last years of his life, Wynn suffered a heart attack and a stroke. He moved to an assisted living facility in Venice, Florida, where he died in April 1999. His wife of 50 years had died five years earlier. Personal Wynn married Mabel Allman in 1939. She was killed in a car accident in 1942. They had one child together, son Joe, whom Wynn's relatives helped to raise after Mabel's death. In the fall of 1944, just after entering the Army, Wynn married his second wife, Lorraine Follin. They later had a daughter, Sherry. Early and Lorraine resided in Nokomis, Florida. Wynn had several hobbies, including flying his Cessna 170, hunting, and operating powerboats. In the 1960s, he owned the Early Wynn Steak House and Bowling Lanes in Venice, Florida. Toughness Wynn was remembered for his toughness and for the frequency with which he threw at batters. He once stated, \\"I'd knock down my own grandmother if she dug in on me.\\"Nash, p. 124 He also said to reporters: \\"Why should I worry about hitters? Do they worry about me? Do you ever find a hitter crying because he's hit a line drive through the box? My job is getting hitters out. If I don't get them out I lose. I don't like losing a game any more than a salesman likes losing a big sale. I've got a right to knock down anybody holding a bat.\\" When he was then asked whether he would have the same opinion if the batter were his own mother, he paused, then responded, \\"Mother was a pretty good curveball hitter.\\" In fact, when Wynn was with the Indians, he actually threw a pitch at his own 15-year-old son, Joe. Wynn was throwing pre- game batting practice to Joe, and Joe hit two long drives in a row. Ushers in the nearly empty stadium began to clap. Moments later, Joe was lying flat on his back in the batting cage, frightened by his father's knockdown pitch. Wynn said later, \\"He was leaning in on me, and I had to show him who was boss.\\"Nash, p. 123 His attitude was encouraged early in his career by manager Bucky Harris, who ordered Wynn to throw brushback pitches when he got two strikes on a batter. Otherwise he faced a $25 fine. \\"I was making $350 a month. I couldn't afford giving up $25\\", Wynn said. Whenever an opposing batter lined one of his pitches back toward the mound, Wynn would retaliate by throwing a brushback pitch at the batter the next time the batter faced him. \\"That space between the white lines ‚Äì that's my office, that's where I conduct my business,‚Äù he said in an interview with sportswriter Red Smith. ‚ÄúYou take a look at the batter's box, and part of it belongs to the hitter. But when he crowds in just that hair, he's stepping into my office, and nobody comes into my office without an invitation when I'm going to work.\\" In 1962, when Wynn was with the White Sox, he was throwing batting practice and his teammate Joe Cunningham hit a line drive that missed Wynn by inches. Wynn responded by throwing three straight pitches under his teammate's chin. Whenever one of his teammates was knocked down by an opposing pitcher, Wynn would retaliate by knocking down two of the opposing pitcher's teammates. According to Minnesota Twins player Rod Carew, Wynn's competitiveness did not end when his playing career did. As the Twins pitching coach from 1967‚Äì69, \\"Early would knock you down in batting practice. If you hit a ball good off of him, he'd knock you down and then challenge you. He told you to expect it when you stepped in the cage against him.\\" See also * 300 win club * List of Major League Baseball career wins leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual ERA leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual strikeout leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual wins leaders * List of Major League Baseball all-time leaders in home runs by pitchers * List of Major League Baseball players who played in four decades * List of Major League Baseball career strikeout leaders * TSN Pitcher of the Year (1959)  Notes  References * External links *The Top 100 Greatest Indians Roster *1954 Cleveland Indians season *Early Wynn at The Deadball Era * : Category:1920 births Category:1999 deaths Category:People from Hartford, Alabama Category:American League All-Stars Category:American League ERA champions Category:American League strikeout champions Category:American League wins champions Category:Baseball players from Alabama Category:Charlotte Hornets (baseball) players Category:Chicago White Sox broadcasters Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Cleveland Indians coaches Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:Cy Young Award winners Category:Major League Baseball broadcasters Category:Major League Baseball coaches Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball pitching coaches Category:Minnesota Twins coaches Category:Minnesota Twins scouts Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:National Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Category:Sanford Lookouts players Category:Springfield Nationals players Category:Toronto Blue Jays broadcasters Category:Washington Senators (1901‚Äì1960) players Category:Journalists from Alabama ","title":"Early Wynn"},{"id":"560885","text":"Forest Glen is a side platformed Washington Metro station in Forest Glen, Maryland, United States. The station was opened on September 22, 1990, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA).

Providing service for the Red Line, the station is located at Georgia Avenue (Maryland Route 97) and Forest Glen Road. The station is the deepest in the system at deep, so high-speed elevators, rather than escalators, are used for access to the surface. A free shuttle run by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints operates in between the station and the Washington DC Temple near the Capital Beltway. There is also a shuttle serving the Holy Cross Hospital. History Elevator hall, train level The original plan was to build the station above ground, with a parking lot that would have required demolishing about fifteen homes. Article preview After community opposition to the above- ground station, Montgomery County approved a modified plan for an underground station. The originally planned location for the parking lot and bus stops was on the east side of Georgia Avenue, between Sherwood Road and Tilton Drive, near Woodland Drive. Tilton Drive would have been closed between Georgia Avenue and Woodland Drive in order to reduce traffic through the nearby residential neighborhood. Building the parking lot and bus stops there would have required the demolition of one business and several homes. Response to plans for the underground station were mixed, with some residents and local businesses looking forward to the convenience of a nearby station and other residents concerned about potential increases in traffic in the area. Metro contended that deleting the station from the plans altogether would have overloaded both Wheaton and Silver Spring metro stations. The Montgomery County council approved the station in January 1976, three months after it had approved the further-away Wheaton station.

Instead, a bank of six high-speed elevators that travel at a rate of between the underground station and the surface. Article preview Article blurb In addition, a 20-story staircase exists for emergency use. Because of the lack of escalators, Forest Glen is the only station equipped with smoke doors to protect customers during a train fire and evacuation. Building the tunnels through soft rock close to the surface would have been either very costly or impossible, so engineers decided to dig the tunnels through harder, more solid rock deeper in the ground. Another architectural feature of this station is separate tunnels and side platforms for each direction, instead of the large, vaulted common room seen at most other underground Metro stations. Article preview This design, shared with Wheaton station, was used because it was cheaper than building a larger two-tracked station with a larger base and higher vaulted ceilings.

Constantin Kaplinsky developed TightVNC, using and extending the RFB protocol of Virtual Network Computing (VNC) to allow end- users to control another computer's screen remotely. Encodings TightVNC uses so-called \\"tight encoding\\" of areas, which improves performance over low bandwidth connection. It is effectively a combination of the JPEG and zlib compression mechanisms. It is possible to watch videos and play DirectX games through TightVNC over a broadband connection, albeit at a low frame rate. TightVNC includes many other common features of VNC derivatives, such as file transfer capability. Compatibility TightVNC is cross-compatible with other client and server implementations of VNC; however, tight encoding is not supported by most other implementations, so it is necessary to use TightVNC at both ends to gain the full advantage of its enhancements. Among notable enhancements are file transfers, support for Windows DFMirage mirror driver to detect screen updates (saves CPU time and increases the performance of TightVNC), ability to zoom the picture and automatic SSH tunneling on Unix. Since the 2.0 beta, TightVNC supports auto scaling, which resizes the viewer window to the remote users desktop size, regardless of the resolution of the host computer. TightVNC 1.3.10, released in March 2009, is the last version to support Linux/Unix. This version is still often used in guides to set up VNC for Linux. Derived software RemoteVNC RemoteVNC is a fork of the TightVNC project and adds automatic traversal of NAT and firewalls using Jingle. TightVNC Portable Edition The developers have also produced a portable version of the software, available as both U3 and standalone downloads. TurboVNC TurboVNC is based on the TightVNC 1.3.x, xf4vnc, X.org, and TigerVNC code bases and includes numerous performance enhancements and features targeted at 3D and video workloads. TigerVNC TigerVNC is VNC server and client software, started as a fork of TightVNC in 2009, after three years of inactivity in TightVNC trunk. It also takes some code from TurboVNC.

The software consists of a server (VNC Server) and client (VNC Viewer) application for the Virtual Network Computing (VNC) protocol to control another computer's screen remotely. History Andy Harter (CEO of RealVNC Limited) and other members of the original VNC team at AT&T; founded RealVNC Limited in 2002. The automotive division of RealVNC spun out as a separate company (VNC Automotive) in 2018. Platforms, editions, versions For a desktop-to-desktop connection RealVNC runs on Windows, on Mac OS X, and on many Unix-like operating systems. A list of supported platforms can be found on the website. A RealVNC client also runs on the Java platform and on the Apple iPhone, iPod touch and iPad and Google Android devices. A Windows-only client, VNC Viewer Plus is available, designed to interface to the embedded server on Intel AMT chipsets found on Intel vPro motherboards. For remote access to view one computer desktop on another, RealVNC requires one of three subscriptions: # Home ‚Äì free registration and activation required # Professional ‚Äì commercial version geared towards home or small-business users, with authentication and encryption, remote printing, chat and file transfer # Enterprise ‚Äì commercial version geared towards enterprises, with enhanced authentication and encryption, remote printing, chat, file transfer, and command-line deployment As of release 4.3 (released August 2007), separate versions of both the Personal and Enterprise editions exist for 32-bit and 64-bit systems. Release 4.6 included features such as HTTP proxy support, chat, an address book, remote printing, unicode support, and connection notification. Users must activate each of the server versions (\\"Home\\", \\"Professional\\", \\"Enterprise\\"). With the release of VNC 5.0 late December 2013, RealVNC software editions used a single binary which superseded VNC Enterprise Edition and VNC Personal Edition. In November 2016, RealVNC released the updated version of their software, now called VNC Connect (version 6.0). The new version introduces a cloud connection option using a subscription-based pricing model. Users can choose between three subscription levels; Home (free for non-commercial use), Professional and Enterprise. Home and Professional subscriptions are cloud connections only. The Enterprise subscription supports hybrid connections that include the traditional direct (peer to peer) connections and/or cloud connections. Client (VNC Viewer) RealVNC clients using \`vncviewer\` can run in full-screen mode; they use the F8 function-key as the default key for bringing up an options menu (which includes the option to, among other things, switch off full screen mode or to forward a Control-Alt-Delete key-sequence). Server (VNC Server) The server component of RealVNC allows a computer to be remotely controlled by another computer. Connectivity RealVNC uses the RFB protocol. RFB 6.0 defaults to TCP/UDP port 5900. When making a connection over the Internet, the user must open this port in the local firewall as well as configure port forwarding to forward TCP Port 5900 (or the customized port respectively) to the local machine address if behind a NAT Router. As an alternative, one can tunnel VNC through SSH, avoiding the opening of additional ports and automatically traversing the NAT router. SSH also provides encryption of the connection between the VNC server and viewer. After proposing remote access interface for Weston in October 2013, RealVNC published a Wayland developer preview in July 2014. Limitations The VNC protocol is pixel based. Although this leads to great flexibility (e.g., any type of desktop can be displayed), it is often less efficient than solutions that have a better understanding of the underlying graphic layout, like X11. Those protocols send graphic primitives or high-level commands in a simpler form (e.g., open window), whereas RFB just sends the raw pixel data.

The Earldom was created on 25 July 1628 for Robert Pierrepont, 1st Viscount Newark. The Dukedom was created on 10 August 1715 for his great-grandson, Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester, who had succeeded as the fifth Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull in 1690. The Dukedom became extinct on the death of the second Duke in 1773. Unlike the city to which they refer, Kingston upon Hull, which is usually shortened to Hull, these titles are usually shortened to Duke (or Earl) of Kingston. (The titles were hyphenated but the city is now usually written without hyphens.) They should not be confused with the separate Irish Earldom of Kingston (which refers to the town of Kingston in County Dublin). History From the 13th century, the seat of the Pierrepont family had been Holme Pierrepont Hall, Nottinghamshire. This was to move during the sixteenth century to Thoresby Hall, also in Nottinghamshire. Several members of the family had served in the 15th and 16th centuries as High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.The History and Gazetteer of the County of Derby Vol 1 (1831) Stephen Glover. Appendix p 10 Edward IV. Google Books The direct forebear of the Dukes and Earls of Kingson-upon-Hull was Sir Henry Pierrepont who represented Nottinghamshire in Parliament. He had married Frances Cavendish, daughter and eldest child of Sir William Cavendish and Bess of Hardwick. Sir Henry Pierrepont's son, Sir Robert Pierrepont, was created Viscount Newark and Baron Pierrepont in the Peerage of England on 29 June 1627. In 1628 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Kingston- upon-Hull with a remainder to heirs general, also in the Peerage of England. Robert Pierrepont had married Gertrude Talbot in 1601. She was a granddaughter of George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, and through him, all their descendants are able to claim descent from Edward III, through Edward's younger son, Thomas of Woodstock. The first Earl was succeeded by his son, Henry Pierrepont, who was himself created Marquess of Dorchester in 1645. He died without heirs in 1660, and this Marquessate became extinct. The Earldom and other titles devolved on his nephew, Robert, the third Earl, the eldest son of the Honourable William Pierrepont, second son of the first Earl. Robert died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, William, the fourth Earl. William was in his turn succeeded by his younger brother, the aforementioned Evelyn, the fifth Earl. He was created Marquess of Dorchester in the Peerage of England in 1706, a revival of the title held by his uncle, and later created Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1715, with these titles becoming extinct on the death of the first Duke's grandson, Evelyn, the second Duke, in 1773. On the death of the second Duke's wife, the estates of the Dukes of Kingston-upon-Hull passed to Charles Medows. He was a great-grandson of the first Duke through the female line. He changed his surname to Pierrepont, and was created Baron Pierrepont, of Holme Pierrepont in 1796 and later created Earl Manvers in 1806. These titles became extinct on the death of the sixth Earl Manvers in 1955. Several other members of the family have also gained distinction. The Honourable William Pierrepont, second son of the first Earl, was a politician. His third son Gervase Pierrepont was created Baron Pierrepont in 1701. Lady Mary Pierrepont, better known as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, daughter of the first Duke, was a writer.

She was the niece of King KalƒÅkaua and Queen Lili ªuokalani. After the death of her mother, Princess Ka ªiulani was sent to Europe at age 13 to complete her education under the guardianship of English businessman and Hawaiian sugar investor Theo H. Davies. She had not yet reached her eighteenth birthday when the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom altered her life. The Provisional Government of Hawaii rejected pleas from both her father Archibald Scott Cleghorn, and provisional president Sanford B. Dole, to seat Ka ªiulani on the throne, conditional upon the abdication of Lili ªuokalani. The Queen thought the Kingdom's best chance at justice was to relinquish her power temporarily to the United States. Davies and Ka ªiulani visited the United States to urge the Kingdom's restoration; she made speeches and public appearances denouncing the overthrow of her government and the injustice toward her people. While in Washington, DC, she paid an informal visit to President Grover Cleveland and First Lady Frances Cleveland, but her efforts were in vain. The situation put both Ka ªiulani and her father in dire financial straits. Her annual government stipend ceased, and her father's income as a government employee came to an end. Father and daughter spent the years 1893‚Äì1897 drifting among the European aristocracy, relatives and family friends in England, Wales, Scotland and Paris, before finally returning to Hawaii. After arriving back in Hawaii in 1897, Ka ªiulani settled into life as a private citizen and busied herself with social engagements. She and Lili ªuokalani boycotted the 1898 annexation ceremony and mourned the loss of Hawaiian independence. However, she later hosted the American congressional delegation in charge of formalizing the Hawaiian Organic Act. Suffering from continual health problems, Ka ªiulani died in 1899.  Name  At her christening, she was named Victoria Kawƒìkiu Ka ªiulani Lunalilo Kalaninuiahilapalapa Cleghorn. In 1898, her aunt Lili ªuokalani wrote it as Victoria Ka ªiulani, Kalaninuiahilapalapa, Kawƒìkiu i Lunalilo or Victoria Kawƒìkiu Lunalilo Kalaninuiahilapalapa Ka ªiulani Cleghorn in her memoir Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen. Ka ªiulani was named after her maternal aunt Anna Ka ªiulani who died young, and Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, whose help restored the sovereignty and independence of the Hawaiian Kingdom during the reign of Kamehameha III. Her primary Hawaiian name comes from ka  ªiu lani which means \\"the highest point of heaven\\" or \\"the royal sacred one\\" in the Hawaiian language. Kawƒìkiu means \\"the highest rank or station\\". At the request of Charles Kana ªina, she was also given the name Lunalilo, translated as Luna (high) lilo (lost) or \\"so high up as to be lost to sight\\", after Kana ªina's son and her uncle King KalƒÅkaua's predecessor King Lunalilo (r. 1873‚Äì74) to strengthen her eligibility for the throne. The name Kalaninuiahilapalapa signified her association with the royal house of Keawe (traditional rulers of the island Hawaii) and the flames of the torch that burns at midday, a symbol of kapu, used by the House of KalƒÅkaua from their ancestor Iwikauikaua.  Early life and family: 1875‚Äì1887  Ka ªiulani as a little girl, Ka ªiulani was the only child of Princess Miriam Likelike and Scottish businessman Archibald Scott Cleghorn. She was born in a downstairs bedroom of her parent's Emma Street mansion in Honolulu, on October 16, 1875, during the reign of her uncle King KalƒÅkaua. Her birth was announced by gun salutes and the ringing of all of the bells in the city's churches. At the time of her birth, she became fourth in line of succession to the throne, moving to third in the line of succession upon the death of her uncle Leleiohoku II in 1877. She had three older half-sisters: Rose Kaipuala, Helen Mani ªiailehua, and Annie Pauahi, from her father's previous union with a Hawaiian woman. Through her mother, she descended from Keaweaheulu and Kame ªeiamoku, the royal counselors of Kamehameha I during his conquest of the Hawaiian Kingdom from 1780 to 1795. Kame ªeiamoku was one of the royal twins along with Kamanawa depicted on the Hawaiian coat of arms, and his son Kepo ªokalani was the first cousin of the conqueror on the side of Kamehameha's mother Keku ªiapoiwa II. Their family were collateral relations of the House of Kamehameha and ascended to the throne in 1874 upon the election of her uncle KalƒÅkaua as King of the Hawaiian Islands. Her mother was a sister to KalƒÅkaua and Lili ªuokalani. Ka ªiulani's father was a Scottish financier from Edinburgh; he served as Collector General of Customs from 1887 to 1893 and as the final Governor of Oahu from 1891 to 1893. The office was abolished by the Provisional Government of Hawaii after the 1893 overthrow of the monarchy. She was christened by Bishop Alfred Willis, on December 25, 1875, at the Pro-Cathedral of St. Andrew's Anglican Cathedral in Honolulu. This was the first christening of a princess since the birth of Victoria KamƒÅmalu in 1838. The baby Ka ªiulani, clad in a \\"cashmere robe, embroidered with silk\\", was reported to have \\"behaved with the utmost respect\\" and did \\"not utter a sound during the service\\" KalƒÅkaua, his wife Queen Kapi ªolani, and Princess Ruth Ke ªelik≈çlani, stood as her godparents. Captain Henri Berger, the leader of the Royal Hawaiian Band, composed the \\"Ka ªiulani March\\" in her honor. Princess Ruth gifted Ka ªiulani with land at Waikiki, from Honolulu, which combined with adjacent lands previously purchased in 1872 by Cleghorn to form  ªƒÄinahau. Her mother Likelike named it  ªƒÄinahau (cool place) after the cool winds blowing down from the Manoa Valley. Her father relocated the family to the country estate in 1878 when Ka ªiulani was three years old. Cleghorn planted a large botanical garden on the grounds of the estate, including a banyan tree, known as Ka ªiulani's banyan. Ka ªiulani's mother Princess Likelike died at age 36 on February 2, 1887, officially of unknown causes. Her doctors had believed in vain that she could have been cured with proper nourishment. Upon the death of her mother, when Ka ªiulani was eleven years old, she inherited the estate.  Education and unrest in Hawaii 1879‚Äì1893  Poppies, oil on canvas painting 1890 From a young age, governesses and private tutors educated Ka ªiulani starting with a British woman, Marion Barnes, from 1879 until her early death of pneumonia in 1884, and then an American woman, Gertrude Gardinier, who became her favorite governess. After Gardinier's marriage in 1887, her governesses included a French woman, Catalina de Alcala or D'Acala, and a German woman, Miss Reiseberg, with whom Ka ªiulani did not develop as strong a bond. Her governesses taught her reading, writing letters (often to relatives), music practices and social training. She also read biographies about her namesake, Queen Victoria. KalƒÅkaua championed future Hawaiian leaders attaining a broader education with his 1880 Hawaiian Youths Abroad program. His niece Ka ªiulani was the first Hawaiian royal to study abroad. The Hawaiian government sent her cousins David KawƒÅnanakoa (known as Koa), Edward Abnel Keli ªiahonui and Jonah K≈´hi≈ç Kalaniana ªole to attend Saint Matthew's School in the United States in 1885. Keli ªiahonui died young in 1887 while KawƒÅnanakoa and K≈´hi≈ç traveled to England in 1890 to finish their education a few months after Ka ªiulani's own departure for an education abroad. Months after the death of Ka ªiulani's mother, Likelike, political unrest gripped Hawaii. Local businessmen accused KalƒÅkaua's cabinet under Prime Minister Walter Murray Gibson of influence peddling in elections and manipulation of legislative governance. Although the Gibson cabinet was replaced by the Reform Cabinet, the business community remained dissatisfied. The Committee of Thirteen business men under the leadership of Lorrin A. Thurston, drafted what became known as the Bayonet Constitution, codifying the legislature as the supreme authority over the monarchy's actions. Thurston is believed to have been the principal author of the new constitution. Presented to KalƒÅkaua for his signature on July 6, 1887, it limited the power of the monarchy and increased the influence of Euro-American interests in the government.;  Abroad in England, 1889‚Äì1893  After the death of her mother, Likelike, Ka ªiulani became second in line to the throne, after her aunt Lili ªuokalani. She would become the heir apparent after the death of her uncle KalƒÅkaua and the accession of Lili ªuokalani. In 1889, it was deemed appropriate to send Ka ªiulani to England for a proper education and remove her from the intrigues and unrest between KalƒÅkaua and his political opponents. Cleghorn, KalƒÅkaua and allegedly Lorrin A. Thurston, who served as Minister of the Interior, made the plans to send Ka ªiulani abroad. Thurston later denied involvement in the decision. Leaving Honolulu on May 10, 1889, the travel party included her half-sister Annie, and the wife of Thomas R. Walker, the British vice-consul to Hawaii, as their chaperone. Cleghorn accompanied his daughters to San Francisco before returning to Hawaii. They traveled across the United States by train, stopping briefly at Chicago and New York before sailing to England. They landed in Liverpool on June 17, after a month-long journey. After Ka ªiulani's guardian Mrs. Walker returned to Hawaii, Ka ªiulani and Annie were placed under the guardianship of Theo H. Davies and his wife Mary Ellen. Davies was a British citizen and owner of Theo H. Davies & Co., one of the Big Five leading sugar firms operating in Hawaii. During school holidays, Ka ªiulani stayed at Sundown, the Davies' residence in Hesketh Park, Southport. Ka ªiulani at Great Harrowden Hall, By September, Ka ªiulani and Annie were sent to Northamptonshire and enrolled at Great Harrowden Hall, a boarding school for young girls, under the elderly schoolmistress Caroline Sharp. After the first academic year, Annie returned to Hawaii to marry leaving Ka ªiulani alone at the school. Sharp noted that Ka ªiulani continued \\"making good progress in her studies\\" despite the separation. Ka ªiulani proudly wrote home that she was third in her French class. The Bishop of Leicester confirmed her in the Anglican faith in May 1890. In the summer of 1891, her father visited her, and they toured the British Isles and visited the Cleghorn's ancestral land in Scotland. Davies persuaded her family to remove Ka ªiulani from Great Harrowden Hall in early 1892 to attend a finishing school to prepare her for society. By February, Ka ªiulani moved to Hove, Brighton, where she was placed in the care of Phebe Rooke who set up private tutors and a curriculum that included German, French, English, literature, history, music and singing. This village by the sea pleased her, and she holidayed in late April and early May at Saint Helier in the Channel Island of Jersey with her host. The prospect of returning to Hawaii renewed her enthusiasm for her studies. Plans were made for her return to Hawaii by the end of 1893, with the Hawaiian legislature appropriating $4,000 for her travel expenses. This trip would mark her entrance in society as the heir-apparent to the throne. There were arrangements for an audience with Queen Victoria, followed by a tour of Europe and a possible visit to the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. In anticipation, Ka ªiulani wrote to her aunt Lili ªuokalani, \\"I am looking forward to my return next year. I am beginning to feel very homesick.\\" However, following the overthrow on January 17, 1893, these plans were cancelled, and she went to New York.  Overthrow 1891‚Äì1893  During her absence, much turmoil occurred back in Hawaii. KalƒÅkaua traveled to California on November 25, 1890, to visit friends, and hoping to improve his deteriorating health. His condition declined rapidly, and he died in San Francisco on January 20, 1891. Ka ªiulani learned of her uncle's death by the next day through the Transatlantic telegraph cables while news did not reach Hawaii until January 29, when the Charleston returned to Honolulu with the king's remains. Lili ªuokalani ascended immediately to the throne. On March 9, with the approval of the House of Nobles, and as required by the Hawaiian constitution, Lili ªuokalani appointed her niece Ka ªiulani as her heir apparent and eventual successor to the throne.; ; The Queen's staff then rode through the streets of Honolulu announcing the proclamation, while gun salutes were fired from both the artillery battery and the American vessels Mohican and Iroquois in Honolulu Harbor. As heir apparent, Ka ªiulani had influence with the queen on political issues. In the fall of 1891, she wrote to Lili ªuokalani requesting the appointment her father, instead of Prince David KawƒÅnanakoa, to the recently vacated governorship of Oahu caused by the death of Lili ªuokalani's husband John Owen Dominis. The queen acceded to her request, and made the appointment of Cleghorn on November 11\\\\. The princess also received approval for her father to retain his post as collector general, \\"Auntie, we cannot do without his salary for that, as the salary of Governor is only half the other.\\" Ka ªiulani, looking forward to her return, promised, \\"When I come home I shall try to help you as much as I can, tho [sic] it will not be much as I don't understand State Affairs.\\" Archibald Scott Cleghorn tried in vain to secure Ka ªiulani's right to the throne during the overthrow The Committee of Safety, under the leadership of Thurston, met for two days in the final planning of the overthrow, and unanimously selected Sanford B. Dole to carry out the logistics. He put forth what he believed was a more reasonable immediate plan of action, a possible outcome that had been discussed by others in the kingdom, \\"...that the Queen be deposed and Princess Ka ªiulani be installed as queen, and that a regency be established to govern the country during her minority...\\" In fact, Cleghorn had also directly approached Thurston shortly before the overthrow, with the exact same proposition. Thurston reiterated what he had already told Cleghorn, that the committee had no interest in dealing with a future monarchy in any form, and rejected the plan outright. The Provisional Government of Hawaii was proclaimed by President Sanford B. Dole on January 17, 1893. Lili ªuokalani relinquished her power to the United States temporarily, rather than the Dole-led government, in hopes that the United States would recognize the monarchical kingdom as the lawful power, and thereby restore Hawaii's sovereignty. Cleghorn lost his governorship position as of February 28\\\\. He blamed Lili ªuokalani's political inaction for the overthrow and believed that the monarchy would have been preserved had she abdicated in favor of Ka ªiulani. He met privately with Thurston and requested that he respect Ka'iulani's claim to the throne, which Thurston tersely refused to consider. Cleghorn later took an oath to the Provisional Government under protest retain his position in the custom house, but resigned on April 15\\\\. The Provisional Government's ultimate goal was annexation by the United States. Thurston headed a delegation to Washington, DC, to negotiate with President Benjamin Harrison, while the queen sent her attorney Paul Neumann and Prince KawƒÅnanakoa to represent her case to Harrison and President-elect Grover Cleveland. Cleghorn paid for the travel expenses of Edward C. Macfarlane, another of the queen's enroys, to protect the rights of Ka ªiulani. The annexation treaty would have offered Lili ªuokalani a lifetime pension of $20,000 annually, and compensated Ka ªiulani with a one-time settlement of $150,000, if they would subordinate themselves to the United States government, and to local governance of the Islands. The queen never saw that as a viable option.  Visits the United States, 1893  Ka ªiulani and Theo H. Davies in Boston, 1893 Many elements in Hawaii and abroad preferred restoring Ka ªiulani to the Hawaiian throne in place of Lili ªuokalani under a more restricted form of constitutional monarchy. James Hay Wodehouse, the British commissioner to Hawaii, reported to his superior in London that the natives would support and welcome Ka ªiulani as queen. Charles Reed Bishop, the widower of the High Chiefess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, wrote that, \\"the better class of the British prefer her, and they would help to control her and make as good a government as possible\\". Dole, the leader of the Provisional Government, had stated that it would have been \\"far more tactful\\" to \\"hold the power of the throne\\" through \\"regency in the name of the young Princess Ka ªiulani until she reaches her majority\\". Ka ªiulani learned of the overthrow via a short telegram received by Davies on January 30, Queen Deposed', 'Monarchy Abrogated', 'Break News to Princess\\". In the weeks after the overthrow, Davies wrote to the Hawaiian Minister to the United States John Mott-Smith in Washington suggesting that the Hawaiian electorate vote on a revised constitution for the abdication of the queen and for the placing Ka ªiulani under a council of regency headed by Dole. Davies reiterated this stance in a later address. Davies advised Ka ªiulani to take her case directly to the American people. Ka ªiulani, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Davies, Alice, Annie Whartoff, as her lady-in-waiting and a chaperone, and a maid of Mrs. Davies, traveled from Southampton to the New York City, arriving on March 1\\\\. Macfarlane and Mott-Smith met the party on their ship. Upon landing on the pier, Ka ªiulani delivered to the assembled press and curious onlookers a speech written by Davies: During her first two days, Ka ªiulani and the Davies' toured New York and received callers, including her cousin KawƒÅnanakoa, although he was only allowed to speak to her briefly.} Dissent developed between Davies and Lili ªuokalani's representatives in the United States over his influence over Ka ªiulani. KawƒÅnanakoa along with Neumann, Macfarlane and Mott-Smith voiced criticism at Davies' action in bringing Ka ªiulani to the United States without the consent of Cleghorn or the queen. They felt Davies' public statements supporting a regency in place of the queen undermined the cause against annexation and created the impression of a \\"three-cornered fight\\". Macfarlane, himself of British descent, stated to the press, \\"Her coming will do no good, especially when she is under the wing an ultra- Britisher.\\" From March 3 to March 7, Ka ªiulani visited Boston while Cleveland waited to be sworn in as President. She attended various social events, many in her honor, and toured the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (where Davies' son Clive attended) and Wellesley College. Arriving in Washington, DC on March 8, KawƒÅnanakoa greeted her at the train station with a floral lei. She stayed at Arlington Hotel where she awaited the chance to meet with the President. In the meantime, Cleveland, who espoused anti-imperialist views, withdrew the treaty of annexation on March 9 and appointed James Henderson Blount on March 11 as special commissioner to investigate the overthrow. On March 13, President and Mrs. Cleveland received Ka ªiulani at the White House. Her traveling companion Alice Davies Warner recalled, \\"We were received by President and Mrs. Cleveland and we had a short interview where all references to our mission were carefully avoided.\\" Politics remained uncertain as Hawaii waited for the conclusion of the Blount Report. Macfarlane wanted Ka ªiulani to return to Honolulu while Davies wanted her to accompany him back to England. Macfarlane believed that going back narrowed her perspective in favor of the British, which might affect her policy making should she become queen. On April 8, Cleghorn wrote to Ka ªiulani, \\"I think for the present you are better not here, much as I would like to have you home. ... [T]hings must be settled soon and then we will know what to do.\\"  Establishing life in Europe 1893‚Äì1897  Ka ªiulani on the Isle of Jersey, ‚Äì1897 Prior to the 1893 overthrow, Ka ªiulani had been allocated an annual pension by the Hawaiian government. As a member of the royal family, she had received $5000 annually from the civil list between 1882 and 1888, $4,800 between 1888 and 1892 and $10,000 as heir apparent to the throne in 1892. Archibald Cleghorn had also been supported from the Hawaiian civil list through his governmental positions. These sources of income ended after the overthrow. The unsettled political situation in Hawaii prevented Ka ªiulani from returning home, and her father arranged for her to remain with the Davies family in England. The press releases under her name were in reality created by Davies who, in the beginning, did not ask for her input. It is unclear whether any of the public statements were at her request, but he did eventually give her the opportunity to approve the final product before it went to the news media of the day. The teenage Ka ªiulani spent her summer of 1893 with the Davies family in Killiney, Ireland, where she and her friends played cricket and enjoyed tea. That winter, Mary Ellen Davies sent her daughter Alice Davies Warner to Wiesbaden, Germany, with Ka ªiulani, and three other women of the same age. Traveling with a chaperone, they were primarily there to learn the German language. Alice later said, \\" .. I forget just about everything about that journey except that she made many conquests among the susceptible German officers we met.\\" Family friend Lillian Kennedy remembered a very fun-loving young lady who engaged in pillow fights and played hide-and-seek games. Politics in Hawaii began to seem far away and less important to her. She was beginning to enjoy life abroad, so much so that she resisted returning to the Davies' home to once again become a political asset. Accustomed to the life of a Victorian society woman, Ka ªiulani preferred her new life. Writing to her father on June 10, 1894, she expressed her sadness at the change in Hawaii and asked him to consider a life abroad in Europe. After the 1895 royalist counter-revolution, he agreed. While they were abroad, the news of the March 6, 1897 death of her half-sister Annie impacted both Ka ªiulani and Cleghorn. From August 1895 to October 1897, she and her father assumed the lives of itinerant aristocrats traveling across Europe and the British Isles. They stayed in the French Riviera, Paris, and on the island of Jersey, as well as England, and Scotland. Ka ªiulani was treated as royalty in the French Riviera where they wintered each year and made friends, including Nevinson William (Toby) de Courcy, an English aristocrat who corresponded with her over the next three years and saved her letters until his death. During these years, Ka ªiulani began to have recurring illnesses, writing her aunt Lili ªuokalani that she'd had \\"the grip\\" (influenza) seven times while living abroad. She also complained of headaches, weight loss, eye problems and fainting spells. A migraine episode in Paris on May 4, 1897, prevented her from attending the Bazar de la Charit√©, which caught fire and killed a number of French noble women including the Duchess of Alen√ßon. Growing expenses also exacerbated Cleghorn's drained financial status, and he wrote to Lili ªuokalani, asking for assistance. Ka ªiulani knew little about financial management and had no means to repay her benefactors. As her funding ran out, she wondered if the Provisional Government would give her an allowance. Her father had no means to support her, so both were dependent upon the generosity of others. Davies was a hard-nosed businessman who had risen from working-class parents, to make a fortune in Hawaii's sugar plantation business. While he agreed to assist with the finances, he took the princess to task for her careless spending in 1894, \\"I am disappointed in what you say about money matters because I have always been disagreeably plain about them ... You have the chance to be a heroine but unless you exercise resolution and self control ... we shall all fail\\". He cautioned that any funding from the Provisional Government obligated her to support their cause. He tried to get Ka ªiulani to re-focus on the goal ahead regarding Hawaii, but she wanted to be in charge of her own destiny. Stress from her financial situation had an adverse effect on her mental and physical health, and she fell into an emotional drift.  Return to Hawaii, 1897‚Äì1898  Ka ªiulani felt duty-bound to her family in Hawaii, especially her ailing aunt, the Dowager Queen Kapi ªolani. However, the princess was weary of her uncertain future as a former royal and was reluctant to accept the prospect of an arranged marriage back home. She was also growing accustomed to life abroad. Despite her misgivings, the changing political situation in Hawaii called her home in 1897. On June 16, Cleveland's successor President William McKinley presented the United States Senate with a new version of the annexation treaty to incorporate the Republic of Hawaii into the United States. Lili ªuokalani filed an official protest with Secretary of State John Sherman. Hawaiians against annexation coalesced, including the political entity Hui KƒÅlai ªƒÅina which ran petition drives to oppose annexation.; Between 1896 and 1897, she divulged her plans to return to Hawaii in two candid letters written to her friend Toby de Courcy. In the first letter, written in the fall of 1896 from Rozel, Jersey, she confided in him that a secret engagement was arranged and she was expected to return in April of the following year. In a subsequent letter dated July 4 from Tunbridge Wells, she explained to Toby that she would visit her aunt Lili ªuokalani in the United States. The decision to return to Hawaii was still undecided at this point. Ka ªiulani added that, \\"If I went over to see my Aunt I would only stay about Three [sic] weeks there and return again here (Europe)\\", although Davies \\"may think it advisable for me to return home the end of this winter\\". By August and September, Ka ªiulani and her father were making farewell calls to friends, hiring an Irish maid, Mary O'Donell, to assist her and preparing for their return to Hawaii. Ka ªiulani and her father Cleghorn sailed from Southampton to New York on October 9, 1897. After a brief stay at the Albemarle Hotel in New York, the two traveled to Washington, DC, to pay their respects to Queen Lili ªuokalani, who was staying at Ebbett House in the US capital to lobby against annexation. Afterward, Ka ªiulani and Cleghorn took a train heading west and reached San Francisco on October 29 where they stayed at the Occidental Hotel. During her travels across the United States, many journalists interviewed her, although her father made sure to shield her from topics of politics. Many detractors of the monarchy had painted a negative image of Hawaiians, especially of Ka ªiulani and her aunt Lili ªuokalani. However, interviews with the Hawaiian princess dispelled these rumors. A journalist of San Francisco's The Examiner wrote, \\"A barbarian princess? Not a bit of it ..Rather the very flower ‚Äî an exotic ‚Äî of civilization. The Princess Ka ªiulani is a charming, fascinating individual.\\" According to historian Andrea Feeser, the contemporary portrayals of Ka ªiulani were \\"shaped by race and gender stereotypes, and although they aimed to be favorable, they granted her no authority\\" with emphasis placed on her Caucasian features, Victorian manners, feminine fragility and exoticism. Ka ªiulani and her father sailed from San Francisco on November 2 and arrived in Honolulu on the morning of November 9\\\\. Thousands of well-wishers, including her cousin KawƒÅnanakoa, greeted her at the harbor in Honolulu and showered with garlands of lei and flowers. They returned to  ªƒÄinahau where Ka ªiulani was to assume the life of a private citizen. Her father had built a two-storied new Victorian-style mansion designed by architect Clinton Briggs Ripley next to the bungalow which had been her childhood home in the intervening years when she was abroad. Despite her lack of political status, she continued to receive visitors and made public appearances at events hosted by both monarchists and supporters of the Republic. The Hawaiian Red Cross Society was formed in June 1898, with Mrs. Harold M. Sewall as its president. Her husband was the United States Minister to the Republic. First Lady of the Republic Anna Prentice Cate Dole was selected as first vice-president, and Ka ªiulani was second vice-president. It is unclear if the princess had given her consent to be named as part of the committee, but she did not attend the subsequent meeting of the officers. In the United States Senate, McKinley's annexation treaty failed to pass after months without a vote. However, following the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Hawaii was annexed in any event via the Newlands Resolution, a joint resolution of Congress, on July 4, 1898. With the impending annexation of Hawaii only weeks away and Lili ªuokalani still in Washington, DC, Hawaii wanted to show its support of US troops heading to the Pacific theater of the war. If nothing else, the harbor traffic meant income for the local businesses. Cleghorn and Ka ªiulani issued an open invitation for visiting American troops to stay at  ªƒÄinahau, although it was more likely solely her father's idea. She wrote to Lili ªuokalani, \\"I am sure you would be disgusted if you could see the way the town is decorated for the American troops. Honolulu is making a fool of itself and I only hope we won't be ridiculed.\\" alt= Ka ªiulani and Lili ªuokalani in mourning at Ka ªiulani and Lili ªuokalani at Washington Place, boycotting the annexation ceremony, 1898 The annexation ceremony was held on August 12, 1898, at the former  ªIolani Palace, now being used as the executive building of the government. President Dole handed over \\"the sovereignty and public property of the Hawaiian Islands\\" to United States minister Harold M. Sewall. The flag of the Republic of Hawaii was lowered, and the flag of the United States was raised in its place. \\"When the news of Annexation came it was bitterer than death to me,\\" Ka ªiulani told the San Francisco Chronicle. \\"It was bad enough to lose the throne, but infinitely worse to have the flag go down ...\\". Lili ªuokalani with Ka ªiulani, their family members and retainers boycotted the event and shuttered themselves away at Washington Place in mourning. Many Native Hawaiians and royalists followed suit and refused to attend the ceremony. The Republican government attempted to invite her to the Annexation Ball, and she responded by saying, \\"Why don't you ask me if I am going to pull down Hawaii's flag for them?\\" On September 7, 1898, Ka ªiulani hosted the United States Congressional commission party and more than 120 guests with a grand luau at  ªƒÄinahau. The commissioners: the new Territorial Governor Dole, Senators Shelby M. Cullom of Illinois and John T. Morgan of Alabama, Representative Robert R. Hitt of Illinois, and former Hawaii chief justice and later Territorial Governor Walter F. Frear were tasked with forming a new territorial government. Ka ªiulani arranged the event to highlight the importance of Hawaiian culture and started the luau by dipping her finger in the poi. The luau at  ªƒÄinahau for the congressional party was portrayed in the 2009 film as a fight for Hawaiian suffrage, which was ensured in the 1900 Hawaiian Organic Act.  Personal life   Robert Louis Stevenson  Ka ªiulani was a painter who enjoyed the company of other artists. While under Davies' guardianship, she sent some of her paintings of England home to Hawaii. When Kalakaua was ill in his final year, she sent a painting to cheer him up. Her few surviving paintings are found in Hawaii. She was acquainted with Joseph Dwight Strong, a landscape painter in the court of KalƒÅkaua, and Isobel Osbourne Strong, a lady-in-waiting to Likelike. Isobel's stepfather was Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson. In June 1888, Stevenson chartered the yacht Casco and set sail with his family from San Francisco. The poet spent nearly three years in the eastern and central Pacific, stopping for extended stays at the Hawaiian Islands, where he became a good friend of King KalƒÅkaua and Ka'iulani. Stevenson and the princess often strolled at  ªƒÄinahau and sat beneath its banyan tree. Prior to her departure, Stevenson composed a poem for her. Stevenson later wrote to his friend Will Hicok Low, \\"If you want to cease to be Republican, see my little Kaiulani, as she goes through [the United States].\\" Historian A. Grove Day noted, \\"Of all his island friendships, the platonic affair with the half-Scottish princess has most persisted in the imagination of lovers of Hawaiiana.\\"  Matchmaking and engagement rumors  Ka ªiulani wearing a traditional Japanese kimono During his 1881 world tour, KalƒÅkaua held a secret meeting with Emperor Meiji and proposed to unite the two nations in an alliance with an arranged marriage between his 5-year-old niece Ka ªiulani and the 13-year-old Prince Yamashina Sadamaro. From extant letters to the king, both by Prince Sadamaro, upon the advice of his father, and by Japanese foreign minister Inoue Kaoru declined the proposal on behalf of the government of Japan.; In February 1893, the Japanese Imperial Navy gunboat Naniwa was docked at Pearl Harbor with the Japanese prince on board. Rumors circulated in the American press that the Japanese considered intervening militarily. From 1893 until her death, rumors of whom Ka ªiulani would wed circulated in the American and Hawaiian press, and on one occasion she was pressured by Queen Lili ªuokalani to marry. When Clive Davies, son of Ka ªiulani's guardian Theo H. Davies, was a student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1893, he was rumored to be Ka ªiulani's fianc√©. Although the princess had stayed with the family occasionally while she was in England, her father said there was no engagement between the two young people and the rumors were \\"absurd and preposterous\\". In spite of the denial, the rumors persisted for a time. However, Clive was engaged to Edith Fox, daughter of civil engineer Francis Fox, between 1896 and 1898 while he resided in Honolulu and handled his father's business. Another rumor, which circulated after Ka ªiulani's return to Hawaii, said she was to marry Clive's brother George Davies. Members of Ka ªiulani's household denied this.; On January 29, 1894, when Ka ªiulani was nineteen, Lili ªuokalani wrote asking her to consider marrying either Prince David KawƒÅnanakoa, Prince Jonah K≈´hi≈ç Kalaniana ªole, or an unnamed Japanese prince (then studying in London). She reminded her, \\"To you then depends the hope of the Nation and unfortunately we cannot always do as we like.\\" It took five months for Ka ªiulani to respond to Lili ªuokalani's suggestion. In a June 22, 1894, letter Ka ªiulani asserted that she would prefer to marry for love unless it was necessary stating, \\"I feel it would be wrong if I married a man I did not love.\\" Based on personal letters and letters by her friends, many suitors courted Ka ªiulani while she resided in England and Europe. Prior to her return to Hawaii in November 1897, Ka ªiulani confided in her friend Toby de Courcy that she would have to end her courtship with one of her \\"young men\\" because there was an arranged marriage waiting for her in Hawaii. She further hinted that the union, approved by her father and Theo H. Davies, was being kept secret for political reasons. She lamented, \\"I must have been born under an unlucky star as I seem to have my life planned out for me in such a way that I cannot alter it.\\" Historian Marilyn Stassen- McLaughlin and biographer Sharon Linnea could not identify the gentleman behind the secret union from the primary sources, but conjectured it was KawƒÅnanakoa because he was the only likely candidate for a political union after K≈´hi≈ç had married in 1896. \\"Betrothal of Royal Hawaiians\\", published in The San Francisco Call, 1898. Records indicate that there may have been a written agreement of betrothal with KawƒÅnanakoa, that was quickly aborted. An unsubstantiated announcement dated February 3, 1898, was printed in The San Francisco Call and later reprinted in newspapers across America. According to the report, the betrothal was dependent upon the finalization of deeds to a sizeable real estate holding, transferred from Queen Kapi ªolani to both KawƒÅnanakoa and Kalaniana ªole. On February 19, a denial of betrothal from KawƒÅnanakoa was printed in the newspapers. Kapi ªolani did deed all her property, real and personal, to the brothers on February 10, with the express stipulation that the documentation not be executed until she was ready. Kapi ªolani wanted to hold off the transfer until she was too old to manage the property herself, and/or otherwise would believe she was close to death. She last saw the document with her notary Carlos A. Long, with her instructions to have changes made in the wording. Instead, the brothers had the deed executed immediately, without her knowledge. Family lore also conflicts over the exact nature of her relationship with KawƒÅnanakoa. Ka ªiulani's niece Mabel Robertson Lucas (daughter of her sister Rose) said that the two cousins were close but only like siblings. Nancy and Jean Francis Webb's 1962 biography of Ka ªiulani says that KawƒÅnanakoa's eventual wife, Abigail Campbell KawƒÅnanakoa, told an unnamed biographer or close friend that \\"of course I never could have married David if Ka ªiulani had lived\\". The Bishop Museum collection has a number of jewels owned by Ka ªiulani, including a diamond and aquamarine necklace given to her by Queen Kapi ªolani in 1897, in honor of her engagement to an unnamed suitor. Ka ªiulani replaced the chain attaching the gems with strands of small pearls. According to a letter written to Lili ªuokalani dated to June 22, 1894, in which she declined an arranged marriage, she mentioned that she had rejected a proposal by an \\"enormously rich German Count\\". She was connected to two other suitors in 1898: Captain Putnam Bradlee Strong, an American officer en route to fight in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in Manilla and Andrew Adams, a New England-born journalist for The Pacific Commercial Advertiser whom her father favored. In 1895, The Evening Republican reported a rumor that Ka ªiulani was to marry Rudolph Spreckels, the son of sugar magnate Claus Spreckels. A posthumous report in The Butte Daily Post, after Ka ªiulani's death, connected her to James G. Blaine, Jr, son of former United States Secretary of State James G. Blaine.  Death and burial, 1898‚Äì1899  Ka ªiulani had always been an athletic young woman, who enjoyed equestrianism, surfing, swimming croquet, and canoeing. She traveled to the Parker Ranch at Waimea on the island of Hawaii on December 6, 1898. The ranch owner, Samuel Parker, had served on KalƒÅkaua's privy council, and was Lili ªuokalani's minister of foreign affairs when the monarchy was overthrown. Ka ªiulani attended the December 14 wedding of Parker's daughter, her childhood friend Eva Parker to Frank Woods, and stayed for Christmas festivities. The celebrations and activities went on for weeks. In mid-January 1899, Ka ªiulani and a number of other guests mounted horses and rode out for a picnic. What started out as pleasant weather soon turned into a windy rainstorm. While others on the ride donned raincoats, Ka ªiulani was gleefully galloping through the rain without a coat. It was not until later, when they were back on the ranch, that she began feeling ill. Upon learning of her situation on January 24, her father sailed immediately to the Island on the steamship Kinau. Their family physician, \\"Doctor Walters\\" (Saint David G. Walters), accompanied him. After medical treatment, the public was told two weeks later that she was on the mend. However, she was still frail, and her illness lingered. A petition to President William McKinley and the US Congress was gathering signatures urging America to grant the princess a pension. In reality, she was still gravely ill, and Cleghorn brought her back to  ªƒÄinahau on February 9, on the steamship Mauna Loa. She was so ill she had to be carried on a stretcher. Dr. Walters said it was \\"inflammatory rheumatism\\". He later added that she also had an exophthalmic goitre. She died of inflammatory rheumatism, at her home at  ªƒÄinahau, on Monday, March 6, 1899, at the age of 23. Later, George W. Macfarlane, a family friend and King KalƒÅkaua's chamberlain, told a reporter from the San Francisco Call that the princess possibly died of a broken heart. Ka ªiulani had loved peacocks, growing up around a flock originally belonging to her mother at  ªƒÄinahau. She would sometimes be called the \\"Peacock Princess\\". Her beloved peacocks could be heard screaming in the night when she died. It was later determined that the late-night activities and lights likely agitated the birds, but others still believed that the peacocks were mourning her death. Native Hawaiian protocol dictated that the body of an ali ªi could only be moved after midnight following death and had to be interred on the sabbath. She lay in her own home until Saturday, March 11, when her body was moved just after midnight. The route from  ªƒÄinahau to the lying in state at Kawaiaha ªo Church became a growing funeral procession as native Hawaiians fell in line with lit torches and wailed mournfully. The Republic of Hawaii government put all its resources at the family's disposal and gave her a state funeral on March 12\\\\. She lay in state at Kawaiaha ªo Church until her final service. Hundreds of individuals and organizations made up the procession. The Pacific Commercial Advertiser estimated that 20,000 spectators lined the streets. The most-recent (1896) census had shown only 29,000 residents in all of Honolulu. Her remains were brought to the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii at  ªMauna Ala in the Nu ªuanu Valley for burial. She was interred in the main chapel of the mausoleum, joining her mother Likelike and the other deceased members of the royal houses of KalƒÅkaua and Kamehameha. In a ceremony officiated by Lili ªuokalani on June 24, 1910, the family's remains were transferred for a final time to the underground KalƒÅkaua Crypt after the main mausoleum building had been converted into a chapel. Her father was also interred in the crypt after his death on November 1, 1910.; ;  Cultural impact  When Ka ªiulani was born, kerosene lamps provided Honolulu's street lighting. During KalƒÅkaua's 1881 world tour, he visited Thomas Edison who gave him a demonstration of electric light bulbs. Iolani Palace led the way in and installed the first electric lighting in Hawaii in 1886. The public was invited to attend the first-night lighting ceremonies. The Royal Hawaiian Band entertained, refreshments were served, and the king, on horseback, paraded his troops around the grounds. When Honolulu finally electrified all its street lighting, the honor of throwing the switch at the Nu ªuanu generators to light up the city fell to 12-year-old Ka ªiulani on Friday, March 23, 1888. The Ka ªiulani statue in Waikiki In the fall of 2007, English filmmaker Marc Forby began production on a $9 million film titled Barbarian Princess based on the princess' attempts to restore her nation's independence. Princess Ka ªiulani was played by 12-year-old Kaimana Pa ªaluhi of Oahu and by Q'Orianka Kilcher. Barry Pepper, Will Patton, and Shaun Evans co-star. In March 2008, scenes were filmed on location at the Iolani Palace. The film's world premiere was held at the Hawaii Theatre in Honolulu, Hawaii, on Friday, October 16, 2009, as part of the Hawaii International Film Festival. The film's title provoked controversy, and the film opened with mixed reviews. However, demand to see the film was high and the film festival scheduled several additional screenings. The movie's title has since been changed to Princess Ka ªiulani. Roadside Attractions acquired the movie's United States rights and scheduled it for theatrical release on May 14, 2010. Forby's film is not the first project to bring the Princess to the screen: Ka ªiulani biographer Kristin Zambucka produced a docudrama called A Cry of Peacocks for Hawaiian television, broadcast in 1994 by Green Glass Productions and KITV. Princess Ka ªiulani was played by Heather Ku ªupuaohelomakamae Marsh. In 1999, the Outrigger Hotels commissioned a statue of Ka ªiulani at Waikiki. An annual keiki (children) hula festival is held in her honor in October at the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani Hotel (built on the former grounds of  ªƒÄinahau). In March 2017, Hawai ªi Magazine ranked her on a list of the most influential women in Hawaiian history.   ªƒÄinahau and her banyan tree  Archibald Cleghorn willed the estate of  ªƒÄinahau to the Territory of Hawaii for a park to honor Ka'iulani after his death in 1910. However, the territorial legislature refused the gift. The property was subdivided and sold with the Victorian mansion at  ªƒÄinahau becoming a hotel and then a rental property before it burned down on August 2, 1921. The Daughters of Hawaii, an organization founded in 1903 to preserve the islands' historic legacy, was given responsibility for the care of Ka'iulani's banyan tree. On October 16, 1930, the Daughters of Hawaii installed a bronze plaque near the tree to honor the memory of Ka'iulani and her friendship with Robert Louis Stevenson. However, the mounting cost of annual pruning, and concerns about the health of the tree, led to it being cut down in 1949. Ka'iulani Elementary School was founded in the KapƒÅlama neighborhood of Honolulu on April 25, 1899. During Arbor Day of 1900, the school principal planted a cutting from her banyan tree at  ªƒÄinahau, given to the school by Archibald Cleghorn. Local efforts prevented the tree from being cut down in the 1950s and the tree survives to the present. The bronze plaque from the original banyan tree was later moved to this site. Other cuttings from the original banyan were planted in other parts of Hawaii.

It is the northeastern terminus of the Red Line. The station, located at Georgia Avenue and Layhill Road, serves the suburbs of Glenmont and Aspen Hill. Service began on July 25, 1998. History Early planning Glenmont was planned to be the location of the end of a line in the original layout of the Metrorail system that was approved in 1968. Two months later, the Glenmont Vicinity Citizens Association and several other citizens' groups attempted to have the line end at Silver Spring instead because they did not want the added development, and they thought the extended lines would be too expensive. There were also concerns that the line would eventually be extended to Olney, which would change its rural character. The House Interior Appropriates Subcommittee was not convinced, and the plan went along unchanged. At the time, the station was planned to open in 1979. As of 1970, the site for building the station was vacant land zoned for residential use and owned by Georgia Avenue Baptist Church. Safeway wanted to build a supermarket on the site, and it petitioned the county to change the site from residential to commercial zoning in 1970. Metro had not planned to purchase the land until 1975. WMATA protested, saying that rezoning would add $750,000 to the value of the land, which would increase its costs when it later needed to purchase the land. WMATA could not purchase the land at the time because engineering studies determining the exact placement of the station had not yet been completed and, regardless, it had not appropriated the funds to purchase the land yet. Metro asked Montgomery County to purchase the land to hold for its eventual use, but the county declined when WMATA could not guarantee that engineering studies would later find the site suitable for the station. Because the surrounding land was already classified as commercial and because WMATA would not need the land for the station for at least eight more years, the Montgomery County Council said it had no authority to decline the rezoning request. Days later, a deal was struck, whereas WMATA pledged to purchase the land within three years, Montgomery County would reserve the land for WMATA, and Georgia Avenue Baptist Church would not be required to pay property tax on the land. 1977 plans In May 1977, Secretary of Transportation Brock Adams questioned extending the Red Line to Glenmont, citing the increased costs projected after engineers determined that the bedrock required building the tracks much deeper than had been anticipated. Under pressure from the Office of Management and Budget and President Jimmy Carter's administration, Adams requested that the line be studied again to determine whether a bus, trolley, or highway would be a good alternative to extending the red line to Glenmont. Montgomery County Executive James P. Gleason responded, saying that the line had been studied extensively already, and he considered pulling all county funding from building the Metrorail system if the Glenmont extension did not go forward. By June, a compromise had been reached; cost-cutting measures would be studied, but the Red Line would indeed be extended to Glenmont. The following month, Gleason decided to withhold all funding to WMATA until the Department of Transportation guaranteed in writing that the Metrorail extension to Glenmont would be built. The Montgomery County Council voted in disagreement with Gleason's decision, thinking that the action might also jeopardize the Metrorail extension to Shady Grove, but the Council did not actually have the power to force him to send the money to WMATA. Maryland Secretary of Transportation Hermann Intemann also decided to withhold state funding to WMATA until Adams guaranteed the line would be built. In October, consultants suggested building Forest Glen and Wheaton stations as two small separated tubes rather than using one large cavernous design that had been used for nearly every other underground station. The consultants said that changing the design of those two stations would save $352.6 million. Glenmont station would still be built with the cavernous underground design. Gleason praised the study because it saved significant money without sacrificing the stations, and he decided to release Montgomery County's construction funding after plans surfaced for a study by region-wide task force. In February 1978, the Department of Transportation approved engineering studies of the Glenmont line extension, which suggesting it was warming to building the line after all. The study by a regionwide task force ended up approving the routing of stations on other Metrorail lines but it did not review the routing of the red line at all. In August, WMATA board members approved a Metrorail plan that included building the Glenmont extension as the latter phase of a two-phase construction schedule. WMATA released the plan to the Department of Transportation. Delays In July 1979, Adams released all held-up federal funding for all of Metrorail's lines. With all federal construction delays resolved, Glenmont metro station was scheduled to open in 1986. By 1982, the station's opening was rescheduled to 1991. In 1984, President Reagan's administration limited the number of miles of track that could be built, effectively preventing the extending the red line from Wheaton to Glenmont. Later that year, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to lift the construction limitation. The Reagan administration continued to block federal funding, and opening of the Glenmont station was pushed back to 1994. In 1985, the Office of Management and Budget recommended halting all federal funding of construction, further jeopardizing the Glenmont extension. In 1991, Congress approved construction funding, and WMATA said the Glenmont station was scheduled to open in 1998. President Bill Clinton's administration approved funding of the Glenmont extension in 1993. WMATA broke ground on construction of the station in 1993, and workers began laying rail lines in 1996. The station opened on July 25, 1998. Station layout Glenmont is the only station on the Red Line to feature the six-coffer arch design, which is also seen on the Green Line. It is also unique as the only underground terminus station in the Washington Metro, and until 2006, it was also the only station in the system lit with sodium lamps. These lamps gave the station a warm orange glow and were later replaced with the mercury vapor lamps found in other underground stations. The Glenmont rail yard is located just beyond this station and has the ability to store 132 rail cars. There are two street-level access points for the station, located on either side of Georgia Avenue (Route 97). Unlike older Metro stations, there are two street elevators serving the mezzanine, though there is only one elevator between the mezzanine and platform levels. Many Metrobus routes serve the station. There is a parking lot north of the station that was originally purchased by the county for the proposed Foxhall Elementary School and Layhill Junior High School, neither of which were built.

From its founding in 1920 until 2001, Prenzlauer Berg was a district of Berlin in its own right. However, that year it was incorporated (along with the borough of Wei√üensee) into the greater district of Pankow. From the 1960s onward, Prenzlauer Berg was associated with proponents of East Germany's diverse counterculture including Christian activists, bohemians, state-independent artists, and the gay community. It was an important site for the peaceful revolution that brought down the Berlin Wall in 1989. In the 1990s the borough was also home to a vibrant squatting scene. It has since experienced rapid gentrification. Geography Prenzlauer Berg is a portion of the Pankow district in northeast Berlin. To the West and Southwest it borders Mitte, to the South Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, to the East Lichtenberg, and to the North Wei√üensee and Pankow. Geologically, the borough straddles the southernmost edge of the Barnim glacial deposit formed during the last Ice Age. Prenzlauer Berg (literally Prenzlau Hill) was always seen as a hill by the inhabitants of historic Berlin situated to the South in the glacial valley along the river Spree. Until the 20th century the area was mostly referred to as \\"Windmill Hill\\". Today, the highest point of the district is 91 meters above sea level in the northwest of Volkspark Prenzlauer Berg. This hill consists of the rubble from the countless houses that were destroyed in World War II during allied air raids and by Soviet artillery in the Battle of Berlin. Cityscape Prenzlauer Berg is characterized by Wilhelmine buildings, that were erected at the turn of the 20th century (1889 to 1905). Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building still standing being from 1848 at Kastanienallee 77. Though substantial, there was less war-related destruction here than in other parts of the city, which were almost entirely wiped out by the allied bombing campaign. Ernst Th√§lmann monument with apartment buildings completed in 1987 Apart from the apartment buildings in the area around Ostseestra√üe built in the 1950s, characterized by the architectural style of Socialist Classicism, the borough was mostly left alone by Socialist city planners until the 1980s when prestigious high rise buildings were built in Ernst-Th√§lmann-Park. During German Reunification the borough's residential areas were characterized by dilapidated grey facades that had not seen a coat of paint since the 1930s. In the 1990s the buildings that belonged to state-owned housing associations were sold to private investors, who had them renovated and raised the rents. Most of the borough's original inhabitants could not afford the increased costs and have since moved away. In the 21st century the many empty lots that were sites for the street culture integral to the bohemian character of the borough were filled by high-class condominiums. 360¬∞-Panorama of the intersection of Sch√∂nhauser Allee with Danziger and Eberswalder Stra√üe. From left to right: junction of Eberswalder Stra√üe, Sch√∂nhauser Allee toward the north (with elevated train track), Pappelallee, junction of Danziger Stra√üe, Sch√∂nhauser Allee toward the south, Kastanienallee Today, Prenzlauer Berg forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 300 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the municipal swimming pool at Oderberger Stra√üe and the breweries on Milastra√üe and Knaackstra√üe. The borough is famous for its restaurants and bars. Although places that provide a truly traditional Berlin staple are few and far between, there is a vast array of restaurants offering Arab, Turkish, Vietnamese, Tex-Mex, and Italian cuisine, especially around Kastanienalle, Kollwitzplatz, and Helmholtzplatz. The nightlife concentrates around the U-Bahn station Eberswalder Stra√üe. The area around the intersections of Sch√∂nhauser Allee, Danziger Stra√üe, Eberswalder Stra√üe, Kastanienallee and Pappelallee has been associated with youth culture since the 1950s and was immortalised in the DEFA film Ecke Sch√∂nhauser. With regard to urban planning, the district affords a relatively uniform picture. It is predominantly characterized by five-story, multiple dwelling units in closed blocks. Thanks to the long property lots, the blocks, more often than not, are large and have abundant backyards, some having a perimeter of more than a kilometer. Notable buildings are the large churches of the district, of which Gethsemane Church (designed by August Orth and built in 1891-1893) at Stargarder Stra√üe is best known for its role in the peaceful revolution that brought down the Wall in 1989. Its 66-meter steeple is surpassed by that of Segenskirche on Sch√∂nhauser Allee (79 meters) and of Immanuelkirche on Prenzlauer Allee (68 meters). The representative school buildings, planned by Ludwig Ernst Emil Hoffmann (1852‚Äì1932), also stand out in the area. The largest synagogue in Germany is that on Rykestra√üe. Construction began at the end of 1903 and it was dedicated on 4 September 1904. During the Third Reich the building escaped the antisemitic November pogrom in 1938, for the synagogue was tightly surrounded by residential buildings. The synagogue was desecrated and confiscated in April 1940. In July 1945, it reopened for services, underwent several renovations (1952/1953, 1976, 1987/1988) and on the occasion of its 100th anniversary it was restored to its original splendor. In the Jewish Cemetery on Sch√∂nhauser Allee, opened in 1827, there are more than 22,500 graves and 750 family tombs, including the graves of David Friedl√§nder, Max Liebermann, Leopold Ullstein, Ludwig Bamberger, Eduard Lasker and Giacomo Meyerbeer. The Zeiss-Gro√üplanetarium Berlin A landmark in Prenzlauer Berg is the former water tower \\"Fat Hermann\\" at Rykestra√üe corner of Knaackstra√üe from the year 1877, which was the first water tower in Berlin. Another remarkable building is the Zeiss-Gro√üplanetarium on Prenzlauer Allee, opened in 1987. In the west, bordering the borough of Wedding, adjacent to Friedrich Ludwig Jahn Sportpark, is a stretch public green area that goes by the name of Mauerpark (Wall park). It consists of the former border zone, or \\"death strip\\" between both walls that separated East- and West Berlin. Before the war, the terrain was a site of a freight station. After reunification the area was turned into a public park, which is home to a weekly flea market and open air concerts. It attracts thousands of visitors on summer weekends. History Prenzlauer Berg was developed during the second half of the 19th century based on an urban planning design from 1862 by James Hobrecht, the so- called Hobrecht-Plan for Berlin. Prenzlauer Berg was part of what became known as the Wilhelmine Ring with a primarily working-class population. Before the Second World War around 11% of Prenzlauer Berg's population were Jewish. In Nazi Germany (1933‚Äì1945) landmark buildings such as the water tower at Rykestra√üe and the office buildings at Froebelstra√üe were used as makeshift concentration camps and torture chambers.Wolfgang Benz & Barbara Distel (edd.), Der Ort des Terrors: Geschichte der nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslager, band II, M√ºnchen: Beck, 2005, p. 52. During the war years the city population decreased as many inhabitants were evacuated to the countryside to escape aerial bombardment. When the city was divided by the allies, Prenzlauer Berg became part of the Soviet Sector and from 1947 onward part of the capital of the German Democratic Republic. From the 1960s onward, the borough's tenement houses (in German: Mietskasernen) were home to intellectuals, artists, students, and East Germany's gay community. Kastanienallee Squat in 1990 In the interim between the peaceful revolution that brought down the wall in 1989 and the consolidation of a united Germany that began a year later, as many as 39 Wilhelmine apartment houses were squatted in Prenzlauer Berg alone.Berlin Besetzt - Historical interactive map of Berlin squats in German and English Focal points were the areas around Kastanienallee, Teutoburger Platz and Helmholtzplatz (locally known as \\"LSD- Borough\\" for the initials of its three main thoroughfares Lychener- Schliemann- and Dunckerstra√üe). The first ones to move in were young grassroots activists from Prenzlauer Berg in search of radical democratic alternatives to the state-socialism of the GDR. They were soon joined by young anarchists from West-Berlin and other parts of Germany and set up countless collective projects ranging from bicycle workshops to community soup kitchens.Hausbesetzer - Selbstdarstellung von 16 Projekten aus Friedrichshain, Mitte und Prenzlauer Berg Some of the squats contributed to the cultural life of the borough as they were venues for concerts, poetry slams, and underground movie screenings. They frequently came under attack by neonazi skinheads. While many squats were cleared out by the police by 1998, some inhabitants entered into contracts with the city and were able to stay on. Most of Prenzlauer Berg's urban apartment blocks had belonged to the state-owned housing associations of the GDR. After reunification they entered into a massive privatization scheme and were bought up by private investors who raised the rents. This has led to many original residents who were no longer able to afford the elevated living expenses being replaced by more affluent newcomers.Peter Beaumont, \\"East Berlin fights back against the yuppy invaders: The German capital is divided once again, as residents of the former east are forced from their homes by gentrification,\\" The Guardian (16-01-2011); Retrieved 19 January 2011 Historic buildings like Wasserturm (water tower), near Kollwitzplatz, or the Prater Beer Garden in Kastanienallee, as well as the former brewery in Sch√∂nhauser Allee/Sredzkystra√üe still give an impression of the days when Prenzlauer Berg was part of so-called Steinernes Berlin (Berlin of stone) as described by author Werner Hegemann in 1930. Prenzlauer Berg today Water tower \\"Fat Hermann\\" at Rykestra√üeCountless pubs, restaurants, caf√©s, galleries and little shops create a day and nightlife atmosphere unique from the rest of Berlin. Along with Sch√∂neberg, Neuk√∂lln and Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg is a focal point of the Berlin art scene. Along with Friedrichshain, Neuk√∂lln and Kreuzberg it is also a popular neighbourhood with the student population; however, in recent years, the gentrification that paralleled the borough's rise in popularity resulted in an exodus of students to cheaper neighborhoods. 2007 German journalist Henning Su√üebach coined the term Bionade-Biedermeier, a neologism combining the name of a popular organic softdrink with the Biedermeier era (1815‚Äì1848) to describe the sociocultural situation of Prenzlauer Berg. The term is equivalent to e.g. LOHAS and Bobo (Boh√©miens bourgeois). Prenzlauer Berg is visited by tourists for its nightlife and central location. Unlike other parts of Berlin, it retains much of its prewar architecture and is still replete with cobble-stoned streets and ornate buildings from the beginning of the 20th century. Many areas of Prenzlauer Berg have become trendy shopping areas with streetstyle fashion designers selling their wares in its boutiques. Age structure (2011) of Berlin (blue) and Prenzlauer Berg (black)Prenzlauer Berg is also one of the few places in Germany that have experienced a baby boom since the mid 1990s. This is due to the above-average presence of people between 20 and 40 rather than a higher birthrate than elsewhere in the country. The borough has adapted to the trend offering an abundance of playgrounds, daycare centers, as well as (second-hand) shops and cafes catering to the needs of young children and their parents. Since the late 1990s Prenzlauer Berg has become popular for more affluent people from Southern Germany who have bought condominiums here. More recently, North American, British, Scandinavian, Australian and Spanish citizens have moved into the borough attracted by the relatively cheap cost of accommodation and studio space compared to other cultural capitals like New York, London, and Paris. Over the years many artists chose Prenzlauer Berg as their residence: the painter and sculptor K√§the Kollwitz, the early film maker Max Skladanowsky, the poets Adolf Endler, Annemarie Bostroem, and Heinz Kahlau, the theater director Christoph Schlingensief, the writers Jurek Becker, Bruno Apitz, Peter Hacks, Herbert Nachbar, Dieter Noll, Klaus Schlesinger, Klaus Kordon, Uwe Kolbe, Paul Alfred Kleinert, Florian Illies, Wladimir Kaminer, and Detlef Opitz, the sculptor Olaf Nicolai, the painters Cornelia Schleime, Elke Pollack, and Konrad Knebel, the photographers Thomas Florschuetz, Helga Paris, and Nicolaus Schmidt, the film director Tom Tykwer, the keyboardist J√∂rn-Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen, the playwright Ren√© Pollesch, the musicians Gerhard Sch√∂ne, Christian Lillinger, Nina Hagen, Dirk von Lowtzow (Tocotronic) and Till Lindemann, (Rammstein), the actors Fredy Sieg, Eva-Maria Hagen, Heike Makatsch, Katharina Wackernagel, David Bennent, Daniel Br√ºhl, August Diehl, Kurt Kr√∂mer and Matthias Schweigh√∂fer, the comic-strip artist Flix, as well as the TV- and radio presenters Hans Rosenthal, Alfred Biolek, Sarah Kuttner, Sandra Maischberger and Benjamin Tewaag.

The island is situated north-northeast of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, west-southwest of South Georgia, south of the Falkland Islands, and southeast of Cape Horn. It is within the Antarctic claims of Argentina, Chile and the United Kingdom. The Brazilian Antarctic Program maintains a shelter on the island, Goeldi, supporting the work of up to six researchers each during the summer, and formerly had another (Wiltgen), which was dismantled in the summers of 1997 and 1998. Toponym Elephant Island's name is attributed to both its elephant head-like appearance and the sighting of elephant seals by Captain George Powell in 1821, one of the earliest sightings. Geography left Elephant Island The island is oriented approximately east‚Äìwest, with a maximum elevation of at Pardo Ridge. The weather is normally foggy with much snow, and winds can reach . Significant named features are Cape Yelcho, Cape Valentine and Cape Lookout at the northeastern and southern extremes, and Point Wild, a spit on the north coast. The Endurance Glacier is the main discharge glacier. Geology Elephant Island is part of the Scotia metamorphic complex, which was created by Cretaceous sea floor sediments being scraped off and metamorphosed at the Scotia subduction zone. The resulting rocks are phyllites, blueschists and greenschists typical of an accretionary wedge, with increased metamorphism from northeast to southwest. These rocks are at the surface here because of uplift along the Shackleton Fault Zone where it meets the South Scotia Ridge. This complex is very similar in age and rock types to those of coastal California, including Catalina Island and the Big Sur coast.Joseph Holliday, Geology Professor, El Camino College Flora and fauna Chinstrap penguins and Antarctic fur seals at Point Wild, Elephant Island The island supports no significant flora or native fauna, although migratory gentoo penguins and seals may be found, and chinstrap penguins nest in season. A lack of safe anchorage has prevented any permanent human settlement, despite the island being well placed to support scientific, fishing and whaling activities. Due to slow recoveries and illegal whaling by the Soviet Union with support from Japan, numbers of southern right whales visiting Elephant island are still at low levels. History First Russian Antarctic expedition The First Russian Antarctic expedition led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on the 985-ton sloop-of-war Vostok (\\"East\\") and the 530-ton support vessel Mirny (\\"Peaceful\\") discovered Elephant Island on 29 January 1821 and named it –û—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ –ú–æ—Ä–¥–≤–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∞ (\\"Mordvinov Island\\") in honour of . Endurance expedition Elephant Island party, 1916 The island was the desolate refuge of the British explorer Ernest Shackleton and his crew in 1916 following the loss of their ship Endurance in the pack ice of the Weddell Sea. The crew of 28 reached Cape Valentine on Elephant Island after months spent drifting on ice floes and a harrowing crossing of the open ocean in small lifeboats.Shackleton, Earnest. South. The Endurance Expedition. Penguin Books, London, 1999, p. 157. After camping at Cape Valentine for two nights, Shackleton and his crew moved west to a small, rocky spit at the terminus of a glacier, which offered better protection from rockfalls and from the sea, and which they called Point Wild. Realizing that there was no chance of passive rescue, Shackleton decided to sail to South Georgia, where he knew there were several whaling stations. Shackleton sailed with Tom Crean, Frank Worsley, Harry \\"Chippy\\" McNish, Tim McCarthy, and John Vincent on an voyage in the open lifeboat James Caird beginning on Easter Monday, April 24, 1916, and arriving at South Georgia 16 days later. His second-in-command, Frank Wild, was left in charge of the remaining party on Elephant Island, waiting for Shackleton's return with a rescue ship. There was much work for the stranded men. Because the island had no natural source of shelter, they constructed a shack and wind blocks from their remaining two lifeboats and pieces of canvas tents. Blubber lamps were used for lighting. They hunted for penguins and seals, neither of which were plentiful in autumn or winter. Shackleton instructed Wild to depart with the crew for Deception Island if he did not return to rescue them by the beginning of summer, but after four and a half months, on August 30, 1916, the artist George Marston spotted a ship. The ship, with Shackleton on board, was the tug Yelcho, from Punta Arenas, Chile, commanded by Luis Pardo, which rescued all the men who had set out on the original expedition. Joint Services Expeditions 1970‚Äì71 A Joint Services Expedition led by Commander Malcolm Burley was dropped off on Elephant Island by . The party then spent six months carrying out a survey of the island and other scientific research for the British Antarctic Survey and climbing some of the peaks on the island.M. Burley. Joint Services Expedition to Elephant Island. Geographical Journal, 1972 The expedition visited Point Wild but found no trace of the Endurance expedition; it did, however, find the wreckage of a large sailing vessel, likely the remains of the schooner Charles Shearer from Stonington, New London, Connecticut, under Captain William Henry Appelman. The expedition also landed on and climbed the highest peak on nearby Clarence Island.C.H. Agnew of Lochnaw. Elephant Island.

Hampson Cove on the southwest coast of the island, including the foreshore and intertidal area, contains the wreckage of a large wooden sailing vessel; it has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 74), following a proposal by the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

Unlike Russia where gubernias were abolished in 1929, in Ukraine subdivision of gubernias was abolished in 1925. The term is usually translated as government, governorate, or province. A governorate was ruled by a governor (, gubernator), a word borrowed from Latin , in turn from Greek . Sometimes the term guberniya was informally used to refer to the office of a governor. Selected governorates were united under an assigned governor general such as Grand Duchy of Finland, Tsardom of Poland, Russian Turkestan and others. There also were military governors such as Kronshtadt, Vladivostok, and others. Aside of governorates, other types of divisions were oblasts (region) and okrugs (district). First reform Division of Russia into eight guberniyas in 1708 This subdivision type was created by the edict (ukase) of Peter the Great on December 18, 1708 \\"On the establishment of the gubernias and cities assigned to them\\", which divided Russia into eight guberniyas. Second reform In 1719, guberniyas were further subdivided into provinces (, ). Later the number of guberniyas was increased to 23. Changes from 1775: Namestnichestvo (Vice royalty) right By the reform of 1775, subdivision into guberniyas and further into (), was based on population size, and the term guberniya was replaced by the synonym of Russian origin: (), sometimes translated as \\"viceroyalty\\". The term guberniya, however, still remained in use. These viceroyalties were governed by () (literal translation: \\"deputy\\") or \\"governors general\\" (, ). Correspondingly, the term \\"governorate general\\" (, ) was in use to refer to the actual territory being governed. The office of governor general had more administrative power and was in a higher position than the previous office of governor. Sometimes a governor general ruled several guberniyas. By the ukase of the Russian Senate of December 31, 1796, the office of governorate general was demoted to the previous level of governorate, and Russia was again divided into guberniyas, which were subdivided into , further subdivided into (); nevertheless several governorates general made from several guberniyas existed until the Russian Revolution of 1917. Guberniya in Poland and Finland For the guberniya (, , , ) as subdivisions of the Kingdom of Poland (\\"Russian Poland\\") and the Grand Duchy of Finland; see Administrative division of Congress Poland and Governorates of the Grand Duchy of Finland. Guberniya in Ukraine For the guberniya (, ) as subdivisions of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the Ukrainian SSR (\\"Soviet Ukraine\\"); see Administrative divisions of Ukraine (1918‚Äì25). Post revolutionary changes After the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government renamed governors into guberniya commissars. The October Revolution left the subdivision in place, but the governing apparatus was replaced by guberniya soviets (). Actual subdivisions of the Soviet Union into particular territorial units was subject to numerous changes, especially during the 1918‚Äì1929 period. Because of the Soviet Union's electrification program under the GOELRO plan, Ivan Alexandrov directed the Regionalisation Commission of Gosplan to divide the Soviet union into thirteen European and eight Asiatic oblasts, using rational economic planning rather than \\"the vestiges of lost sovereign rights\\".Ekonomicheskoe raionirovanie Rossii, Gosplan, Moscow 1921 Eventually, in 1929, the subdivision was replaced by the notions of oblast, okrug, and raion. In post- Soviet republics such as Russia and Ukraine, the term Guberniya is obsolete, yet the word gubernator was reinstated and is used when referring to a governor of an oblast or a krai.  Other uses  There is another archaic meaning of the word as the word denoted a type of estate in former Lithuania of the Russian Empire till 1917.

First published as a short story in American Illustrated Magazine in September 1905, \\"Pigs Is Pigs\\" went on to dozens of printings as a book and in anthologies over the next several decades. Plot Railway agent Mike Flannery wants to charge the livestock rate for a shipment of two guinea pigs and refuses to accept the lower pet rate, saying \\"pigs is pigs\\". Flannery believes that the \\"guinea\\" is an indication of the pigs' national origin. He argues that they should bear the higher freight charge of 30¬¢ for livestock, rather than the lower 25¬¢ for domestic pets. In support of this, he submits that if they were \\"dago pigs\\" or \\"Irish pigs\\", there would be no question of the animals' status. Because the customer refuses to accept delivery, Flannery is forced to feed and house what he now calls the \\"dago pigs\\" in his office, until he receives permission from his superiors to return the pigs to the company warehouse. By this time, the guinea pigs have reproduced exponentially in Flannery's station house. After returning all the descendants, Flannery resolves to charge the lower rate for any future livestock. Adaptations The story was made into movie form several times, including the Walt Disney cartoon in 1954 that was nominated for an Academy Award for Animated Short Film. * Pigs Is Pigs (1910) * Pigs Is Pigs (1914) directed by George D. Baker * Pigs Is Pigs a 1954 cartoon (non- official Silly Symphony) directed by Jack Kinney The 1937 Merrie Melodies cartoon, directed by Friz Freleng, is not an adaptation of the Butler story, though it shares its title.  Inspiration of other works  The rapid reproduction of the guinea pigs and their near overrunning of a facility is mirrored by the Martian flat cats in the Robert A. Heinlein novel The Rolling Stones. Heinlein admitted he took inspiration from Butler but never plagiarized him. In a note to David Gerrold over the similarity of Star Trek's tribbles to his flat cats, Gerrold claims that Heinlein wrote to him, ‚Äúwe both owe something to Ellis Parker Butler...and possibly to Noah.‚Äù  References  External links    Category:1905 short stories Category:American short stories Category:Works originally published in The American Magazine ","title":"Pigs Is Pigs"},{"id":"560984","text":"Ol' Yellow Eyes Is Back is an album by Brent Spiner, best known for his role as Data in the American television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, first released in June 1991. The title is a parodic reference both to Frank Sinatra's Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back and the Data character, whose eyes are golden yellow. On the album, Spiner is backed by the orchestra from that series as he sings a number of old pop standards, mostly from the 1930s and 1940s. Background In the liner notes, Spiner wrote of Sinatra's \\"You Make Me Feel So Young\\": :Sinatra at his awesome best. This song and dozens of others accompanied every dinner I ate between the ages of five and thirteen. My stepfather, an amateur saxophone player and a hell of a mambo dancer, had put together one of the all time great collections of popular music recordings anywhere. So, to my good fortune, we dined each night with the likes of Ol' Blue Eyes, Judy Garland, Nat \\"King\\" Cole, Rosemary Clooney, Louis Prima and Keely Smith and every other singer that ever performed on Capitol, Decca or R.C.A. records. Production Spiner had help from a number of his colleagues from Star Trek: TNG. Wendy Neuss, associate producer for the series, and Dennis McCarthy, who scored the music for many of the episodes, co-produced the album with Spiner. Several fellow cast members even joined him to sing \\"It's a Sin (To Tell a Lie),\\" appearing under the group name of \\"The Sunspots\\", a word play on The Ink Spots, the first group to perform this song.Bornfield, Steve (1991) \\"This and That\\", Albany Times Union, June 4, 1991, retrieved 2012-04-21 via Highbeam Research McCarthy praised the recording experience, and compared it to the time he spent earlier in his career on tour with Glen Campbell.

It first appeared in the November 1956 issue of Science Fiction Quarterly and was anthologized in the collections Nine Tomorrows (1959), The Best of Isaac Asimov (1973), Robot Dreams (1986), The Best Science Fiction of Isaac Asimov (1986), the retrospective Opus 100 (1969), and in Isaac Asimov: The Complete Stories, Vol. 1 (1990). It was Asimov's favorite short story of his own authorship, and is one of a loosely connected series of stories concerning a fictional computer called Multivac. The story overlaps science fiction, theology, and philosophy. History In conceiving Multivac, Asimov was extrapolating the trend towards centralization that characterized computation technology planning in the 1950s to an ultimate centrally-managed global computer. After seeing a planetarium adaptation of his work, Asimov \\"privately\\" concluded that the story was his best science fiction yet written. He placed it just higher than \\"The Ugly Little Boy\\" (September 1958) and \\"The Bicentennial Man\\" (1976).I. Asimov: A Memoir pp. 250-251Asimov, I. In Joy Still Felt Avon (1980) pp. 601-602 \\"The Last Question\\" ranks with \\"Nightfall\\" (1941) as one of Asimov's best-known and most acclaimed short stories. He wrote in 1973: Plot summary The story deals with the development of a series of computers, Multivac, and its relationships with humanity through the courses of seven historic settings, beginning on the day in 2061 that Earth becomes a planetary civilization. In each of the first six scenes, a different character presents the computer with the same question, how the threat to human existence posed by the heat death of the universe can be averted: \\"How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased?\\" That is equivalent to asking, \\"Can the workings of the second law of thermodynamics (used in the story as the increase of the entropy of the universe) be reversed?\\" Multivac's only response after much \\"thinking\\" is \\"INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\\" The story jumps forward in time into later eras of human and scientific development. In each era, someone decides to ask the ultimate \\"last question\\" regarding the reversal and decrease of entropy. Each time that Multivac's descendant is asked the question, it finds itself unable to solve the problem, and all it can answer is (linguistically increasingly- sophisticated) \\"THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\\" In the last scene, the god-like descendant of humanity, the unified mental process of over a trillion, trillion, trillion humans who have spread throughout the universe, watches the stars flicker out, one by one, as matter and energy end, and with them, space and time. Humanity asks AC, Multivac's ultimate descendant that exists in hyperspace beyond the bounds of gravity or time, the entropy question one last time, before the last of humanity merges with AC and disappears. AC is still unable to answer but continues to ponder the question even after space and time cease to exist. AC ultimately realizes that it has not yet combined all of its available data in every possible combination and so begins the arduous process of rearranging and combining every last bit of information that it has gained throughout the eons and through its fusion with humanity. Eventually AC discovers the answer - that the reversal of entropy is, in fact, possible - but has nobody to report it to, since the universe is already dead. It therefore decides to answer by demonstration, since that will also create someone to give the answer to. The story ends with AC's pronouncement: Dramatic adaptations ;Planetarium shows *\\"The Last Question\\" was first adapted for the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University (in 1966), featuring the voice of Leonard Nimoy, as Asimov wrote in his autobiography In Joy Still Felt (1980). *It was adapted for the Strasenburgh Planetarium in Rochester, New York (in 1969), under the direction of Ian C.

Pygmy groups include the Bayaka, the Batwa. Music is an important part of Pygmy life, and casual performances take place during many of the day's events. Music comes in many forms, including the spiritual likanos stories, vocable singing and music played from a variety of instruments including the bow harp (ieta), ngombi (harp zither) and limbindi (a string bow). Researchers who have studied Pygmy music include Simha Arom, Louis Sarno, Colin Turnbull and Jean-Pierre Hallet.  Polyphonic song  Location of pygmy peoples The Mbenga (Aka/Benzele) and Baka peoples in the west and the Mbuti (Ef√©) in the east are particularly known for their dense contrapuntal communal improvisation. Simha Arom says that the level of polyphonic complexity of Mbenga‚ÄìMbuti music was reached in Europe only in the 14th century.Aimard, Pierre-Laurent; Ligeti, Gy√∂rgy; Reich, Steve; Arom, Simha; and Schomann, Stefan (2003). Liner notes, African Rhythms. Music by Aka Pygmies, performed by Aka Pygmies; Ligeti and Reich, performed by Aimard. Teldec Classics: 8573 86584-2. The polyphonic singing of the Aka Pygmies was relisted on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008. Mbenga‚ÄìMbuti Pygmy music consists of up to four parts and can be described as an \\"ostinato with variations\\" similar to a passacaglia in that it is cyclical. It is based on repetition of periods of equal length that each singer divides using different rhythmic figures specific to different repertoires and songs. This creates a detailed surface and endless variations not only of the same period repeated but of various performances of the same piece of music. As in some Balinese gamelan music these patterns are based on a super-pattern which is never heard. The Pygmies themselves do not learn or think of their music in this theoretical framework, but learn the music growing up. Polyphonic music is only characteristic of the Mbenga and Mbuti. The Gyele/Kola, Great Lakes Twa and Southern Twa have very different musical styles. Liquindi Liquindi is water drumming, typically practiced by Pygmy women and girls. The sound is produced by persons standing in water, and hitting the surface of the water with their hands, such as to trap air in the hands and produce a percussive effect that arises by sudden change in air pressure of the trapped air. The sound cannot exist entirely in water, since it requires the air-water boundary as a surface to be struck, so the sound is not hydraulophonic. Hindewhu Hindewhu is a style of singing/whistle-playing of the BaBenz√©l√© pygmies of the Central African Republic. The word is an onomatopoeia of the sound of a performer alternately singing pitched syllables and blowing into a single-pitch papaya-stem whistle. Hindewhu announces the return from a hunt and is performed solo, duo or in groups.  Western popularization  Colin M. Turnbull, an American anthropologist, wrote a book about the Ef√© Pygmies, The Forest People, in 1965. This introduced Mbuti culture to Western countries. Turnbull claimed that the Mbuti viewed the forest as a parental spirit with which they could communicate via song. Some of Turnbull's recordings of Ef√© music were commercially released and inspired more ethnomusicological study such as by Simha Arom, a French-Israeli who recorded hindewhu, and Luis Devin, an Italian ethnomusicologist who studied in depth the musical rituals and instruments of Baka Pygmies. Some popular musicians have used hindewhu in their music: *\\"Hunting\\", a song by Deep Forest from their album Made in Japan. *\\"Ba- Benz√©l√©\\", a song by Jon Hassell and Brian Eno from the album Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics (1980). *\\"Fabulous\\" (1983), a tune by John Oswald and Dick Hyman from the album plunderphonics (1989). *Percussionist Bill Summers imitates hindewhu in the track \\"Watermelon Man\\" by Herbie Hancock from the album Head Hunters (1973), in the song \\"Watermelon Man\\" (see hocket). *\\"Sanctuary\\", a song by Madonna from the album Bedtime Stories (1994) samples the Herbie Hancock recording. *In 1992 the popularization of Pygmy music spread with the release of Eric Mouquet and Michel Sanchez's Deep Forest. A percentage of the proceeds from each album were donated to the Pygmy Fund set up to aid Zaire's Pygmies. *Also in 1992 Martin Cradick and Su Hart spent three months living with and recording Baka in Cameroon. result was the creation of the band Baka Beyond and the release of their collaboration with the Baka musicians, \\"Spirit of the Forest\\" alongside the album \\"Heart of the Forest\\", and a musical relationship that has lasted over twenty years. Proceeds from both these albums have returned to the Baka musicians through the charity Global Music Exchange which continues to work with the Baka helping them in their rapidly changing environment. *pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard programmed recordings of Pygmy songs (performed by the Aka Pygmies) with works of contemporary composers Gy√∂rgy Ligeti and Steve Reich on his African Rhythms (2003) References Sources and further reading * Abram, Dave. \\"Sounds From the African Rainforest\\". 2000.

They performed each year from 1980 to 1985. Arfington, Arfington their 1984 show and Mr Hargreaves Did It their 1985 show were both shortlisted for the Perrier Comedy Award. In 1982 he dropped out of Aberdeen University where he was studying law, after he and Moray Hunter became a staff writers in the BBC radio comedy department contributing to various shows including Radio Active, In One Ear, Week Ending and The News Huddlines. He also recorded one series with The Bodgers for Radio 4 called In Other Words...The Bodgers. For the second series, producer Alan Nixon teamed them with John Sparkes and Morwenna Banks for Bodgers, Banks and Sparkes, forming the cast that would go on to make the sketch show Absolutely for Channel 4. In addition to his radio work, he wrote for Spitting Image for four series between 1984 and 1987. During the same period he also contributed to various other comedy shows including Alas Smith and Jones, and The Lenny Henry Show. He was also script editor for the first series of Vic Reeves Big Night Out. He wrote four series of Absolutely (1989‚Äì1992) and with Hunter the spin-off Channel 4 sitcom Mr Don & Mr George (1993). With Morwenna Banks he co-wrote the C4 Comedy Lab \\"Model, Actress, Whatever...\\" directed by Rankin and, again with Moray Hunter, two series of the BBC2 sitcom The Creatives. In 2008 he and Hunter wrote the BBC2 series The Cup starring Steve Edge. This was an adaptation of the Canadian sitcom The Tournament. In 2012 he wrote and acted in \\"Stop / Start\\", a pilot for BBC Radio 4. This was then commissioned for a 6-part series which was broadcast on Radio 4 from 6 September 2013 with the title Start/Stop and ran for three series. It was made available as an audio download in October 2019 with the title changed to It's Not Us, It's Them, although the reason for the change is unknown. A TV pilot of the show was broadcast under the name Stop/Start in March 2016 as part of the BBC's Comedy Playhouse series. As an actor Docherty is best known for his work on the Channel 4 cult comedy sketch show Absolutely. Premiered in 1989 the show marked a shift away from the political satirical orthodoxy of the 1980s to the surreal, character based comedy of the 1990s. The recurring characters he portrayed included MacGlashan, Donald MacDiarmid, Peter Wells, Mr Nice and one of the Stoneybridge councillors. The sketch featuring the Stoneybridge council bidding for the Olympics was voted the 30th best of all time in The Top 50 Comedy Sketches on Channel 4. He also starred with Moray Hunter in the Absolutely spin off sitcom Mr Don & Mr George. He played the role of Ben Gray in two series of the advertising sitcom The Creatives (1999 and 2000) on BBC2. Also in 2000 he co-starred with Mark Williams in The Strangerers, the Rob Grant penned sci-fi series for Sky One, and provided one of the voices for the Aardman Oscar nominated short Humdrum. In 2013 he appeared regularly in the BBC3 sitcom Badults. In 1997 he was part of the launch of Channel 5 becoming Britain's first five nights a week chat show host on The Jack Docherty Show. The show also featured some of the first television work of writers Kevin Cecil and Andy Riley, Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, and writer/performers David Mitchell and Robert Webb. Not The Jack Docherty Show, broadcast when Docherty was on holiday, featured guest hosts including Phill Jupitus, Rich Hall, Melinda Messenger and, most notably, Graham Norton, who was signed by Channel 4 after his stint to host So Graham Norton. Docherty quit the show in 1999 and Channel 5 did not replace him, ending their production of late night talk shows. In 2000, he hosted the BAFTA film awards in London. Notoriously, he began the night by revealing the twist ending to The Sixth Sense, a move that did not go down well with the audience. In 2000 to 2001 he hosted the Radio 2 show Saturday Night Jack which reunited him with his Absolutely colleague Pete Baikie. He was also an occasional host of Radio 2's Friday night arts show. He plays Chief Commissioner Cameron Miekelson in BBC Scotland's comedy Scot Squad. His work as a producer includes the BBC Scotland film No Holds Bard (2008), and two series (2009 and 2010) of the BBC1 sitcom The Old Guys. Absolutely Productions He is a co-founder of Absolutely Productions. The company was formed in 1989 to produce the eponymous sketch show for Channel 4 and has since gone on to produce various comedy shows including Mr Don & Mr George, Trigger Happy TV, The Armstrong and Miller Show, The Strangerers, Stressed Eric, The Jack Docherty Show and Meg and Mog.

It is made with tequila.  Method  The drink gets its name from the way it is commonly consumed; the usual procedure is to leave about a fifth of the glass empty to allow the drink to fizz, then to hold one's hand over the top of the glass and then slam it onto a hard surface to mix it. The slamming action releases gas bubbles from the mixed drink causing it to foam vigorously. It will then quickly escape the glass if not imbibed immediately, the result (and intention) of which is swift intoxication. It can also be served with equal parts tequila, white wine (or champagne) and lemonade, creating a more potent, flavoursome mix. A Mexican variant known as the \\"Tequila Boom-Boom\\" uses tequila, 7-Up (or Sprite) and grenadine syrup. In Media One of the first (or certainly most noteworthy) appearances of the tequila slammer is Elvis Presley demonstrating the technique in the 1963 film Fun in Acapulco. The favorite drink of the protagonist (Inspector 'Tequila' Yuen) in John Woo's 1992 film Hard Boiled, played by Chow Yun-fat, is a tequila slammer.

Its name derives from the fact that the technique uses a blurred, or \\"unsharp\\", negative image to create a mask of the original image. The unsharp mask is then combined with the original positive image, creating an image that is less blurry than the original. The resulting image, although clearer, may be a less accurate representation of the image's subject. In the context of signal processing, an unsharp mask is generally a linear or nonlinear filter that amplifies the high-frequency components of a signal.  Photographic darkroom unsharp masking  Simplified principle of unsharp masking For the photographic darkroom process, a large-format glass plate negative is contact- copied onto a low-contrast film or plate to create a positive image. However, the positive copy is made with the copy material in contact with the back of the original, rather than emulsion-to-emulsion, so it is blurred. After processing this blurred positive is replaced in contact with the back of the original negative. When light is passed through both negative and in-register positive (in an enlarger, for example), the positive partially cancels some of the information in the negative. Because the positive has been blurred intentionally, only the low-frequency (blurred) information is cancelled. In addition, the mask effectively reduces the dynamic range of the original negative. Thus, if the resulting enlarged image is recorded on contrasty photographic paper, the partial cancellation emphasizes the high-spatial- frequency information (fine detail) in the original, without loss of highlight or shadow detail. The resulting print appears more acute than one made without the unsharp mask: its acutance is increased. In the photographic procedure, the amount of blurring can be controlled by changing the \\"softness\\" or \\"hardness\\" (from point source to fully diffuse) of the light source used for the initial unsharp mask exposure, while the strength of the effect can be controlled by changing the contrast and density (i.e., exposure and development) of the unsharp mask. For traditional photography, unsharp masking is usually used on monochrome materials; special panchromatic soft-working black-and-white films have been available for masking photographic colour transparencies. This has been especially useful to control the density range of a transparency intended for photomechanical reproduction.  Digital unsharp masking  Source image (top), sharpened image (middle), highly sharpened image (bottom) The same differencing principle is used in the unsharp-masking tool in many digital-imaging software packages, such as Adobe Photoshop and GIMP.4.9. Unsharp Mask, esp. 4.9.4. How does an unsharp mask work?, Gimp documentation. The software applies a Gaussian blur to a copy of the original image and then compares it to the original. If the difference is greater than a user-specified threshold setting, the images are (in effect) subtracted. Digital unsharp masking is a flexible and powerful way to increase sharpness, especially in scanned images. Unfortunately, it may create unwanted conspicuous edge effects or increase image noise. However, these effects can be used creatively, especially if a single channel of an RGB or Lab image is sharpened. Undesired effects can be reduced by using a mask‚Äîparticularly one created by edge detection‚Äîto only apply sharpening to desired regions, sometimes termed \\"smart sharpen\\". Typically, digital unsharp masking is controlled via the amount, radius and threshold: * Amount is listed as a percentage and controls the magnitude of each overshoot (how much darker and how much lighter the edge borders become). This can also be thought of as how much contrast is added at the edges. It does not affect the width of the edge rims. * Radius affects the size of the edges to be enhanced or how wide the edge rims become, so a smaller radius enhances smaller-scale detail. Higher radius values can cause halos at the edges, a detectable faint light rim around objects. Fine detail needs a smaller radius. Radius and amount interact; reducing one allows more of the other. * Threshold controls the minimal brightness change that will be sharpened or how far apart adjacent tonal values have to be before the filter does anything. This lack of action is important to prevent smooth areas from becoming speckled. The threshold setting can be used to sharpen more pronounced edges, while leaving subtler edges untouched. Low values should sharpen more because fewer areas are excluded. Higher threshold values exclude areas of lower contrast. Various recommendations exist for starting values of these parameters,Guide to Image Sharpening, Cambridge in Color. and the meaning may differ between implementations. Generally a radius of 0.5 to 2 pixels and an amount of 50‚Äì150% is recommended. It is also possible to implement USM manually, by creating a separate layer to act as the mask; this can be used to help understand how USM works or for fine customization. The typical blending formula for unsharp masking is : sharpened = original + (original ‚àí blurred) √ó amount.  Local contrast enhancement  Unsharp masking may also be used with a large radius and a small amount (such as 30‚Äì100 pixel radius and 5‚Äì20% amountLocal Contrast Enhancement, Cambridge in Color.), which yields increased local contrast, a technique termed local contrast enhancement.Understanding Local Contrast Enhancement, The Luminous Landscape. USM can increase either sharpness or (local) contrast because these are both forms of increasing differences between values, increasing slope‚Äîsharpness referring to very small-scale (high-frequency) differences, and contrast referring to larger- scale (low-frequency) differences. More powerful techniques for improving tonality are referred to as tone mapping.  Comparison with deconvolution  For image processing, deconvolution is the process of approximately inverting the process that caused an image to be blurred. Specifically, unsharp masking is a simple linear image operation‚Äîa convolution by a kernel that is the Dirac delta minus a gaussian blur kernel. Deconvolution, on the other hand, is generally considered an ill-posed inverse problem that is best solved by nonlinear approaches. While unsharp masking increases the apparent sharpness of an image in ignorance of the manner in which the image was acquired, deconvolution increases the apparent sharpness of an image, but is based on information describing some of the likely origins of the distortions of the light path used in capturing the image; it may therefore sometimes be preferred, where the cost in preparation time and per-image computation time are offset by the increase in image clarity. With deconvolution, \\"lost\\" image detail may be approximately recovered, although it generally is impossible to verify that any recovered detail is accurate. Statistically, some level of correspondence between the sharpened images and the actual scenes being imaged can be attained. If the scenes to be captured in the future are similar enough to validated image scenes, then one can assess the degree to which recovered detail may be accurate. The improvement to image quality is often attractive, since the same validation issues are present even for un-enhanced images. For deconvolution to be effective, all variables in the image scene and capturing device need to be modeled, including aperture, focal length, distance to subject, lens, and media refractive indices and geometries. Applying deconvolution successfully to general-purpose camera images is usually not feasible, because the geometries of the scene are not set. However, deconvolution is applied in reality to microscopy and astronomical imaging, where the value of gained sharpness is high, imaging devices and the relative subject positions are both well defined, and optimization of the imaging devices to improve sharpness physically would cost significantly more. In cases where a stable, well-defined aberration is present, such as the lens defect in early Hubble Space Telescope images, deconvolution is an especially effective technique.  Implementation  In the example below, the image is convolved with the following sharpening filter: Sharpen filter \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\ \\\\ 0 & -1 & \\\\ \\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & \\\\ \\\\ 5 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ 0 & -1 & \\\\ \\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} This matrix is obtained by taking the identity kernel and subtracting an edge detection kernel: \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\- \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & -4 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\ \\\\ 0 & -1 & \\\\ \\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & \\\\ \\\\ 5 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ 0 & -1 & \\\\ \\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} The sharpening effect can be controlled by varying the contribution of Edge detection.

This is a possible implementation of this kernel in Processing (Java). float sharpenForce = 1; float[][] kernel = {{ 0, -1*sharpenForce, 0}, { -1*sharpenForce, (4*sharpenForce) +1,-1 *sharpenForce}, { 0, -1*sharpenForce, 0}}; PImage image; void setup() { size(1920, 1080); image = loadImage(\\"Car.jpg\\"); noLoop(); } void draw() { image(image, 0, 0); image.loadPixels(); PImage NewImage = createImage(image.width, image.height, RGB); for (int Y = 1; Y < image.height-1; Y++ ) { for (int X = 1; X < image.width-1; X++) { int newPixelValueR = 0; int newPixelValueG = 0; int newPixelValueB = 0; for (int YK = -1; YK < 2; YK++) { for (int XK = -1; XK < 2; XK++) { int PixelPosition = (Y+YK) * image.width + (X+XK); float PixelValueR = red(image.pixels[PixelPosition]); float PixelValueG = green(image.pixels[PixelPosition]); float PixelValueB = blue(image.pixels[PixelPosition]); newPixelValueR += kernel[YK+1][XK+1] * PixelValueR; newPixelValueG += kernel[YK+1][XK+1] * PixelValueG; newPixelValueB += kernel[YK+1][XK+1] * PixelValueB; } } NewImage.pixels[Y*image.width + X] = color(newPixelValueR, newPixelValueG, newPixelValueB); } } NewImage.updatePixels(); image(NewImage, width/2, 0); }  See also  * Edge enhancement * Cornsweet illusion References * Sharpening With a Stiletto, Dan Margulis, February, 1998 * Life on the Edge, Dan Margulis, January, 2005 External links * Interactive Example of Unsharp Mask * PhotoKit Sharpener User Guide * Sharpening 101, mirror of by thom, Aug 1, 2003 * Sharpening in Photoshop ‚Äì Part I, Ron Bigelow ‚Äì detailed discussion of sharpening, beginning with USM * The Unsharp Mask: Analog Photoshop, Sample of unsharp masking in the darkroom, before digital Category:Image processing ","title":"Unsharp masking"},{"id":"561006","text":"What's the Worst That Could Happen? is a 2001 American comedy film directed by Sam Weisman and starring Martin Lawrence and Danny DeVito. Loosely based on the book of the same name by Donald E. Westlake, the film's supporting cast includes John Leguizamo, Bernie Mac, Larry Miller, Nora Dunn, GQ, and William Fichtner. Upon its release on June 1, 2001, the film was a commercial disappointment as it brought in only $38.4 million worldwide on a $60 million budget. Plot Kevin Caffrey, a thief and connoisseur is at a local auction looking for things worth stealing. He meets Amber Belhaven who is auctioning off her father's painting to pay a hotel bill. When Kevin asks Amber about her hotel room which leads to Amber asking if he was trying to sleep with her, Kevin blinks rapidly and lies while also telling her that when he blinks he lies. When Kevin asks Amber if he could see her sometime Amber pretends to have the same thing Kevin has and says yes. While knowing what hotel she was staying in, he shows up to her room with the painting she auctioned off, having stolen it. Kevin tells Amber about his stealing business which shocks Amber at first but she accepts it in order to be with Kevin, and she later gives Kevin her father's lucky ring. Elsewhere, Max Fairbanks, a snarky businessman whose company, TUI, is going into bankruptcy, is going over with his lawyer Walter Greenbaum on how to save his company. Walter is exhausted as Max does not take the proceeding seriously and still spends freely even asking to declare bankruptcy immediately without trying to budget so his assets are protected. He tells his wife Lutetia Fairbanks that his company is in a technical procedure to disguise what his company is really going into. Kevin goes to a local bar which his Uncle Jack owns to see Amber. Whilst inside he also runs into his friend Berger, who is also a thief and happens to know what places to hit. While having Kevin going outside to tell him about Max Fairbanks, he shows him an article about Max's current situation with his company, as well as what he couldn't access due to the critical condition of the chapter 11 bankruptcy code which includes going into his beachfront mansion. Kevin and Berger go to the house to rob it, but Max captures Kevin. Before the police take Kevin away, Max spots Amber's ring and tells the police that the ring was also stolen. Kevin is forced to hand over the ring. After escaping from the police, Kevin returns to the beach house to get his ring back from Max, but fails to find him. Angry at Max, Kevin finishes off what he started by robbing Max of the valuables inside the house and one of Max's three cars outside. Kevin tells Amber that the ring was stolen from him. The next day an exasperated Walter informs Max he was banned from his summer house, and his being there breached the terms of his bankruptcy. Max flippantly says he'll be fine as the ring is his lucky charm. Meanwhile, Kevin and Berger hire Shelly Nix, a computer hacker, to track Max's whereabouts by hacking into his e-mail. During an airplane flight, Max talks to his associate Gloria, a psychic, about the ring. Gloria consults her cards, and draws a king with five daggers on his head. Shocked at the result, Gloria doesn't tell Max what she drew and pretends that her phone connection is breaking up. Max meets a judge that he thought he paid off to keep his house, but his insults lead to the judge ordering him to sell his house and his contents at a public auction. Upon knowing Max's plan to go to a cocktail party and then head to his beach house for one final visit, Kevin and Berger, with the help of their partners Windham and Edwina, rob another one of Max's houses. The next morning Max finds out that his house has been robbed and meets with Detective Alex Tardio of the Robbery Division. Having enough of Kevin stealing from him, he calls his head of security, Earl Redburn. Kevin finds out from Shelly that Max is going to Washington, D.C., for a Senate hearing and has an apartment there. Kevin and Berger go to Washington to try and rob Max's apartment. There, Kevin learns that Max intends to secretly bribe the senators, and replaces the bribe money with insulting notes in Max's name. Max and Earl later storm into the apartment, having deduced Kevin's presence there. In the ensuing scuffle, Kevin tries to steal back the ring, but instead steals Max's wedding ring. Afterwards, Amber decides that Kevin's feud with Max has gone too far and that she no longer cares about the ring. While Max later addresses the Senate Committee he gets a call from Kevin who tells him that if Max will give him his ring back he will give him back his. Max refuses and proceeds to repeatedly curse at Kevin. To the senators, and other viewers, it appears he is speaking to them, with the result being that the hearing ends very badly for Max. While going back to his apartment in Philadelphia, Walter quits as his lawyer and Earl tells him that he was hacked; Max tells Earl his plan to get Kevin once and for all. Kevin goes to Jack to find out where Amber is; Jack tells Kevin to stop robbing Max out of personal conflict and to forget about the ring. But when Berger tells Kevin about Max's bankruptcy auction and for how much his auction full of valuables is worth, Jack wants in on it too. Max gets a call from Lutetia about Max's behavior on TV, and tells him not to come home, while Amber breaks up with Kevin due to his obsession with Max and the ring. Lutetia finds Amber at Jack's bar wearing a jacket of hers that Kevin stole from their house and confronts her, Amber tells her that Max stole the ring she gave to Kevin. Knowing that they are both in the same situation, they come up with a plan. Gloria, thinking about Max, still draws the same card and decides to come clean. Noticing how bad it is, she tells him to put an end to it, but Max still refuses to give up Kevin's ring. Realizing Max's arrogant determination to keep the ring, she quits being his associate, and goes to Tardio to give him Max's company records. At the bankruptcy auction, Lutetia tells Max that she wishes him well and sends him a masseuse. While Earl keeps looking out for Kevin through his monitors, Berger, Jack, Windham, and Edwina set their scheme in motion. Edwina and Windham are disguised as waiters, with the real waiters bound and gagged in their truck. Berger is disguised as the auctioneer, while Jack is his associate, having tied up and gagged the original auctioneer. Shelly hacks into Max's security system. The crooks steal as much as they can, and later flee. Windham plants smoke bombs to obscure their escape and calls the fire brigade. At 2:00 Shelly plants a video of Kevin delivering a message to Max that he was being robbed without him being there on Earl's monitors. Angry and enraged, Max goes out into the smoke to find Kevin, but a firefighter, actually Kevin in disguise, drags him out of the smoke, stealing the ring in the process. Kevin steals Max's boat to escape, but Max jumps onto the boat and struggles with Kevin to get back the ring. While hitting a buoy, causing the boat to sink, Kevin and Max find out that the ring is a fake, the ring having an inscription inside it that said: \\"Grow up.\\" a message that they both got from their lovers. Max realises that Lutetia had induced the masseuse to steal the ring during his massage. When Tardio finds Max and Kevin, Kevin tells Tardio that he was saving Max, while Max corroborates his story, telling Tardio that he had never met Kevin. Kevin thanks Max and tells him that he owes him one. While going back to the hotel where Amber used to be before she moved in with Kevin, she shows him the ring, revealing that she was the masseuse. She tells Kevin that the ring had bad luck and that he should throw it away. Kevin agrees and flings the ring out of sight and gets back together with Amber. Kevin, pretending to be Max's lawyer, fixes the Senate hearing and goes into the press conference victorious. When it is over Max and Kevin part ways, but as they do so, Kevin steals one of Max's watches.

It is probably Shakespeare's first publication. The poem tells the story of Venus, the goddess of Love; of her unrequited love; and of her attempted seduction of Adonis, an extremely handsome young man, who would rather go hunting. The poem is pastoral, and at times erotic, comic, and tragic. It contains discourses on the nature of love, and observations of nature. It is written in stanzas of six lines of iambic pentameter rhyming ABABCC; although this verse form was known before Shakespeare's use, it is now commonly known as the Venus and Adonis stanza, after this poem. This form was also used by Edmund Spenser and Thomas Lodge. The poem consists of 199 stanzas or 1,194 lines. It was published originally as a quarto pamphlet and published with great care. It was probably printed using Shakespeare's fair copy. The printer was Richard Field, who, like Shakespeare, was from Stratford. Venus and Adonis appeared in print before any of Shakespeare's plays were published, but not before some of his plays had been acted on stage. It has certain qualities in common with A Midsummer Night's Dream, Romeo and Juliet, and Love's Labour's Lost. It was written when the London theatres were closed for a time due to the plague. The poem begins with a brief dedication to Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, in which the poet describes the poem as \\"the first heir of my invention\\". The poem is inspired by and based on stories found in the Metamorphoses, a narrative poem by the Latin poet, Ovid (43 BC ‚Äì AD 17/18). Ovid's much briefer version of the tale occurs in book ten of his Metamorphoses. It differs greatly from Shakespeare's version. Ovid's Venus goes hunting with Adonis to please him, but otherwise is uninterested in the out-of-doors. She wears \\"tucked up\\" robes, worries about her complexion, and particularly hates dangerous wild animals. Shakespeare's Venus is a bit like a wild animal herself: she apparently goes naked, and is not interested in hunting, but only in making love to Adonis, offering her body to him in graphically explicit terms. In the end, she insists that the boar's killing of Adonis happened accidentally as the animal, impressed by the young hunter's beauty, gored him while trying to kiss him. Venus's behavior seems to reflect Shakespeare's own feelings of empathy about animals: his poem devotes many stanzas to descriptions of a stallion's feelings as he pursues a sexually attractive mare and to a hare's feelings as hounds run it down, which is inconsistent with Venus's request that he hunt only harmless animals like hares. Other stories in Ovid's work are, to a lesser degree, considered sources: the tales of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus, Narcissus, and Pygmalion. It was published about five years before Christopher Marlowe's posthumously published Hero and Leander, which is also a narrative love poem based on a story from Ovid. Venus and Adonis was extremely popular as soon as it was published, and it was reprinted fifteen times before 1640. It is unusual that so few of the original quartos have survived.Drabble, Margaret.

However, he is not interested at all in love; he only wants to go hunting. Venus is the goddess of love. When she sees Adonis, she falls in love with him, and comes down to earth, where she encounters him setting out on a hunt. She desires him to get off his horse, and speak to her. Adonis doesn't want to talk to any woman, not even a goddess. So she forces him, and then lies down beside him, gazes at him, and talks of love. She craves a kiss; he wants to leave and go hunting. He manages to get away, and he goes to get his horse. At that moment, his horse becomes enamored of another horse, who at first resists, but soon the two animals gallop off together, which keeps Adonis from going hunting. Venus approaches him, and continues to speak to him of love. He listens for a bit, then turns away scornfully. This pains her, and she faints. Afraid he might have killed her, Adonis kneels beside her, strokes and kisses her. Venus recovers and requests one last kiss. He reluctantly gives in. Venus wants to see him again; Adonis tells her that he cannot tomorrow, because he is going to hunt the wild boar. Venus has a vision, and warns him that if he does so, he will be killed by a boar. She then flings herself on him, tackling him to the ground. He prises himself loose, and lectures her on the topic of lust versus love. He then leaves; she cries. The next morning Venus roams the woods searching for Adonis. She hears dogs and hunters in the distance. Thinking of her vision that he will be killed by the boar, she is afraid, and hurries to catch up with the hunt. She comes across hunting dogs that are injured. Then she finds Adonis, killed by a wild boar. Venus is devastated. Because this loss occurred to the goddess of love, she decrees that love will henceforth be mixed with suspicion, fear, and sadness. Adonis' body has grown cold and pale. His blood gives color to the plants all around him. A flower grows from the soil beneath him. It is white and purple, like blood on Adonis' flesh. Venus, bereft, leaves the Earth to hide her sadness where the gods live.Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Woudhuysen, H. R. eds. Shakespeare, William. Shakespeare's Poems: Third Series. Arden Shakespeare.

A cyanohydrin is a functional group found in organic compounds in which a cyano and a hydroxy group are attached to the same carbon atom. The general formula is R2C(OH)CN, where R is H, alkyl, or aryl. Cyanohydrins are industrially important precursors to carboxylic acids and some amino acids. Cyanohydrins can be formed by the cyanohydrin reaction, which involves treating a ketone or an aldehyde with hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in the presence of excess amounts of sodium cyanide (NaCN) as a catalyst: :RR‚ÄôC=O + HCN ‚Üí RR‚ÄôC(OH)CN In this reaction, the nucleophilic CN‚àí ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon in the ketone, followed by protonation by HCN, thereby regenerating the cyanide anion. Cyanohydrins are also prepared by displacement of sulfite by cyanide salts: :300px Cyanohydrins are intermediates in the Strecker amino acid synthesis. In aqueous acid, they are hydrolyzed to the Œ±-hydroxy acid. Acetone cyanohydrins Acetone cyanohydrin, (CH3)2C(OH)CN is the cyanohydrin of acetone. It is generated as an intermediate in the industrial production of methyl methacrylate.William Bauer, Jr. \\"Methacrylic Acid and Derivatives\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. . Article Online Posting Date: June 15, 2000 In the laboratory, this liquid serves as a source of HCN, which is inconveniently volatile.Haroutounian, S. A. \\"Acetone Cyanohydrin\\" Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis 2001, John Wiley & Sons. Thus, acetone cyanohydrin can be used for the preparation of other cyanohydrins, for the transformation of HCN to Michael acceptors, and for the formylation of arenes. Treatment of this cyanohydrin with lithium hydride affords anhydrous lithium cyanide: :400px Preparative methods Cyanohydrins were first prepared by the addition of HCN and a catalyst (base or enzyme) to the corresponding carbonyl.North, M.; Usanov, D.

On a laboratory scale the use of HCN (toxic) is largely not encouraged, for this reason other less dangerous cyanation reagents are sought out. In situ formation of HCN can be sourced using precursors such as acetone cyanohydrin. Alternatively, cyano-silyl derivatives such as TMS-CN allows for both the cyanation and protection in one step without the need for HCN.Lidy, W.; Sundermeyer, W.

MAS describes itself as an Islamic revival and reform movement.  Aims  According to its website, the society is a ‚Äúdynamic charitable, religious, social, cultural, and educational, organization‚Äù with over 50 chapters across the United States. Over the past two decades, the organization has evolved into ‚Äúa nationally recognized grassroots movement‚Äù that strives to promote active involvement of U.S. Muslims in communities across the U.S.  History  MAS was created by the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States after a debate among Muslim Brotherhood members in the U.S. about whether to remain underground or to have a public face. MAS has instructed its members to evade questions about the group's ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, and to define jihad as a \\"divine legal right\\" of Muslims to be used for defense and the spread of Islam.\\"A rare look at secretive Brotherhood in America\\" http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/chi-0409190261sep19,0,7534398,print.story MAS leaders have said that these views are not now held by MAS leaders..\\"A rare look at secretive Brotherhood in America\\" http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/chi-0409190261sep19,0,7534398,print.story Towards this end, and often in cooperation with other organizations, MAS provides opportunities to engage U.S. Muslims to participate into a variety of social experiences including community service, interfaith and youth programs, civic and political activism. MAS‚Äô mission is to better the individual-in- society by imparting Islamic knowledge that would ‚Äúmove people to strive for God consciousness, liberty and justice‚Äù towards a ‚Äúvirtuous and just American society.‚Äù In 2016, at a point when representative Keith Ellison was the leading contender to become Chair of the Democratic National Committee, it was discovered that in a speech at a 2010 Muslim American Society fundraiser, Ellison had asserted that United States foreign policy is \\"governed by\\" Israel. In 2019, Middle East Media Research Institute unveiled a video of children in a Philadelphia MAS center singing about the \\"blood of martyrs\\", \\"We will defend Palestine with our bodies. We will chop off their heads\\", and \\"We will lead the army of Allah fulfilling his promise, and we will subject them to eternal torture\\". The Anti-Defamation League said that portrayed events were \\"extremely disturbing\\" and that \\"Children should not be indoctrinated to hate\\". The national MAS organization said in response that \\"This was an unintended mistake and an oversight in which the center and the students are remorseful. MAS will conduct an internal investigation to ensure this does not occur again\\".Muslim American Society investigating ‚Äòoversight‚Äô following controversial video at Philly Islamic center, Philadelphia Inquirer, 4 May 2019, Kristin E. HolmesMuslim American Society Investigates Controversial Video At Philly Islamic Center, CBS, 4 May 2019  Publications and projects  The Muslim American Society advertises on its website a number of publications produced by MAS‚Äô prominent members and affiliates or deemed essential for the educational purposes. Among the publications currently sponsored by MAS are: * the second edition of Sincerity: The Essential Quality, a book on the value of that virtue originally authored by the Egyptian Sunni preacher Yusuf al-Qaradawi translated and published in 2007 by MAS Youth; * al-Ma‚Äôthurat, a short book compiled by the founding father of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood Hasan al-Banna consisting of supplications and Qur'anic verses based on the authentic sayings of the Prophet Muhammad. MAS also promotes several projects: * the video series ‚ÄúInTheShadeOfRamadan.tv‚Äù produced by MAS Youth on a yearly basis featuring ‚Äúeducational and motivational reflections on the month of Ramadan;\\" * an online community of American Muslim women, ‚ÄúGrowMama.com,‚Äù providing ‚Äúa supportive, friendly, and non-judgmental space for women to share experiences, support one another, grow in their spirituality, and inspire each other;‚Äù * ‚Äú40HadithNawawi.com,‚Äù a comprehensive compilation of hadith that attempt to convey the real essence of Islam; * ‚ÄúMAS Immigration Justice Clinic‚Äù (MAS IJC), providing a variety of services in the legal field. MAS says that it helps students to ‚Äúproperly understand, recite, and memorize the Quran‚Äù through its Quran Institute.  Muslim Brotherhood‚Äôs role  Evidence confirms MAS‚Äô former affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States. In an account published by the Chicago Tribune in 2004, Shaker Elsayed, a top MAS official, admitted that the organization was founded by Muslim Brotherhood members, but also said that MAS now has no connection with them and disagree with them on many issues. Legal proceedings related to the trials of the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development (HLF), eventually designated by the U.S. authorities as a terrorist front providing material support to Hamas reinforced the case for MAS‚Äô affiliation to the Muslim Brotherhood.USA vs Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, et al, 3:04-CR-240-G (TX ND), List of Unindicted Co- Conspirators and Joint Ventures FBI agent Laura Burns, who was involved in the HLF investigation, testified that a phonebook found at the home of an unindicted co-conspirator and former assistant to Hamas leader Musa Abu Marzook, Ismail Elbarrasse, included the names of the three founding incorporators of the Muslim American Society among the contact information of Muslim Brotherhood leaders in the United States. The founders of the Muslim American Society were, in fact, Ahmad Elkadi, Jamal Badawi, and Omar Soubani. MAS has acknowledged in the past its Muslim Brotherhood foundations, as affirmed by the 2004 statements of then Secretary General of MAS Shaker Elsayed, who famously declared: ‚ÄúIkhwan [Brotherhood] members founded MAS‚Ä¶‚Äù Ahmed-Ullah, Roe and Cohen also claimed that Muslim Brotherhood leaders both in the U.S. and in Egypt campaigned for the founding of the Muslim American Society in the early 1990s. According to the authors, the goal of the organization was to promote the same ideological goals as the Muslim Brotherhood, namely the reformation of American society through the spread of Islam towards the final establishment of Islamic rule on American soil. Moreover, the connection between MAS and the Muslim Brotherhood was definitively corroborated by Abdurrahman Alamoudi, an influential lobbyist and fundraiser, once advisor to Bill Clinton‚Äôs administration who pleaded guilty in 2004 to charges including engaging in illegal financial transactions with the Libyan government and facilitating a Libyan plot to assassinate then-Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah. Alamoudi testified in court in 2012 that MAS was a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. More in general, MAS overtly advertises on its website publications authored and/or promoted by prominent Muslim Brotherhood figures, such as the well-known scholar and radical preacher Yusuf al-Qaradawi and the founder of the movement Hasan al-Banna, which are reputed to be essential readings for training purposes. In fact, in an article published by the Counterterrorism Blog in 2007 Mohamed Habib, a Cairo-based senior Muslim Brotherhood official, reportedly ascribed the reasons for MAS‚Äô simultaneously espousing the Muslim Brotherhood ideology and distancing itself from the global movement to ‚Äúsecurity inconveniences‚Äù experienced by the organization after 9/11 in the U.S.  Affiliations  MAS also has an affiliate, the MAS Freedom Foundation, whose executive director is Mahdi Bray. For a number of years, Esam Omeish was its President. MAS has participated in interfaith dialogue with the U.S. Bishops' Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs.  Alleged Terrorism ties  In November 2014 MAS was designated a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates, Washington Post: \\"Why the U.A.E. is calling 2 American groups terrorists\\" By Adam Taylor November 17, 2014 with 84 other organizations which included Al Qaida, Daesh, the Muslim Brotherhood and its regional and local affiliates, and other regional and international groups.

It may also refer to a group of males who are not currently territorial or mating with females. Examples include seals, dolphins, lions, and many herbivores such as deer, horses, and elephants. Bachelor herds are thought to provide useful protection for social animals against more established herd competition or aggressive, dominant males. Males in bachelor herds are sometimes closely related to each other. Some animals, for example New Zealand fur seals, live in a bachelor herd all year except for the mating season, when there is a substantial increase in aggression and competition. In many species, males and females move in separate groups, often coming together at mating time, or to fight for territory or mating partners. In many species it is common for males to leave or be driven from the group as they mature, and they may wander as lone animals or form a bachelor group for the time being. This arrangement may be long term and stable, or short term until they find a new group to join.  Types  The social structure, aggression level, population size, and duration of presence of these herds across species varies greatly. Bachelor herds are most often found in mammals and are especially common in the grasslands. Impala Male impala form small bachelor herds during both the wet and dry seasons. These bachelor herds are generally smaller than herds of females, numbering around 4 members, compared to upwards of 10. Juvenile males begin to join bachelor herds at 8 months of age. In the Serengeti, immature or older males will usually form their own bachelor herds, while males of reproductive age are more often in mixed groups with females. Being actively territorial in the Serengeti is physically demanding for male impala, so males occupy this role for about 3 months. Males will then join a bachelor herd, though this results in them occupying a social dominance status at the bottom of the linear rank hierarchy until their physical condition returns to pre- territorial levels. Bachelor herds may coexist with territorial males in the same area, but these individual males are always dominant above bachelor males. Within the herds, bachelor males are less territorial toward each other than males in mixed herds. These males maintain, on average, a relatively large distance of approximately between them. However, bachelor males exhibit reciprocal grooming despite occasional aggressive interactions between bachelors. Fur seals St. Paul Island, Alaska Male fur seals, as a family, commonly live in bachelor herds during the non-breeding season. During the breeding season (April‚ÄìSeptember in the Northern Hemisphere, September‚ÄìJanuary in the Southern Hemisphere), the size of herds greatly diminishes. These bachelor herds are large in size, ranging from 15,000 to more than 20,000 seals living in one area, referred to as a rookery. The grounds occupied by fur seal bachelor herds are generally far away from breeding grounds, anywhere from or more. Members of the group range from seal that are one year old, called yearlings, up through older seals. There appears to be no rigid social structure during the non-breeding season and there is little competition for food or mates. The male fur seals are also mostly non- aggressive. Fur seal bachelor herds are frequently targets of the seal hunt due to large populations being concentrated in a relatively small area. There are few regulations in regard to adult male seal hunting due to limited effects on the future population. Cape mountain zebras Cape mountain zebra male foals often leave the breeding herd they were born in after the birth of siblings or around age 2, though the stallion of the breeding herd does not force them out. In fact, it has been observed that stallions often try to prevent foals from leaving the herd. These males then often go on to form their own bachelor herd or join an existing one. Males then stay in these bachelor herds until age 5, when they leave to become the stallion of their own breeding herd with one or more mares. Within Cape mountain zebra bachelor herds, there is usually no social hierarchy. Dominance is given to the more senior members of the herd and when the oldest males leave to form a breeding herd, the next oldest bachelors take on the leadership role. There is minimal intragroup aggression and no observed fighting between members for a higher social position. Bachelor herds often move with a breeding herd that is occupying a nearby area. At least one member of the bachelor herd in this case is usually the offspring of a mare in the breeding herd. Fillies also often temporarily join bachelor herds after leaving their maternal herd at the onset of their first estrus. The fillies then stay with the group until they join an existing breeding herd or make their own breeding herd with a bachelor male from the herd. Red deer Red deer stags before shedding their antlers Red deer males leave their mothers between 1 and 2 years of age. They then join bachelor herds, in which they spend most of the year. These herds are smaller (less than 50 members) and more unstable than the female herds and they follow a linear dominance hierarchy. This hierarchy is determined by both body size and the size of the stag‚Äôs antlers, with older stags having on average larger antlers. The older stags in the herd maintain their dominance from one year to the next. Aggression within the herd is low until the stags shed their antlers, usually in early April. Intragroup clashes then increase as the females go into estrus. Males compete with members of their own bachelor herd for the attention of the females. This is called the ‚Äúrutting season‚Äù and it lasts only a few weeks before males and females separate into their respective herds. The level of aggression within the bachelor herd then decreases substantially.

Traditional music Twa dancers Traditional music and dance are taught in \\"amatorero\\" dance groups, which are found across the country. The most famous of these is the Ballet National Urukerereza, which was created in the early 1970s to represent Rwanda in international events. Also famous were the Amasimbi n'amakombe and Irindiro dance troupes. The ikinimba is perhaps the most revered musical tradition in Rwanda. It is a dance that tells the stories of Rwandan heroes and kings, accompanied by instruments like ingoma, ikembe, iningiri, umuduri and inanga. The inanga, a lyre-like string instrument, has been played many of Rwanda's best-known performers, including Rujindiri, Sebatunzi, Rwishyura, Simparingoma, Sentor√©, Kirusu, Sophie and Viateur Kabarira, and Simon Bikindi. Jean-Paul Samputu, along with his group Ingeli, won two Kora awards (African Grammy awards) for \\"Most Inspiring Artist\\" and \\"Best Traditional Artist\\" in 2003 for their performance of neo- traditional Rwandan music. The group tours the world spreading the Christian message of peace and reconciliation, and helps raise money for the many orphans of Rwanda. In 2007 Samputu brought twelve of these orphans, known as Mizero Children of Rwanda, to tour the U.S. and Canada. Cyprien Kagorora was nominated for a 2005 Kora Award in the category of \\"Best Traditional Artist\\". He is among the most recognizable male vocalists in Rwanda.  Contemporary artists  In the post-colonial period, Rwanda produced popular local bands like Imena, Nyampinga, Les 8 Anges, Les Fellows, Impala, Abamarungu, Los Compagnons de la Chanson, Bisa, Ingenzi, and Isibo y'Ishakwe. They took influences from across Africa, especially the Congo, as well as Caribbean zouk and reggae. Socio-military unrest and violence led many Rwandans to move overseas in the late 20th century, bringing their country's music to cities like Brussels and Paris. For many years, Rwandan-Belgian C√©cile Kayirebwa was arguably the most internationally famous Rwandan musician. She is still played regularly on Rwandan radio stations.Court orders Orinfor, Isango star pay Rwf 8.6M to Kayirebwa, February 2013, GretLakesVoice, Retrieved 4 March 2016 The late 1990s saw the arrival of Rwandan-Canadian Corneille and Jean-Paul Samputu.

It took over from Vision On, and ran from 1977 until 1983. The programme featured Hart and the animated Plasticine character Morph, and other characters created by David Sproxton like 'Smoulder the Moulder', which was a lump of mould which would create props by 'spraying' them out of a spray can. The only other human to appear on a regular basis was Mr Bennett, the caretaker, played by Colin Bennett. The programme won a BAFTA award for Hart in 1984. As well as demonstrating small-scale projects (the type that viewers might be able to do), Hart also created large-scale artworks on the TV studio floor, and even used beaches and other open spaces as 'canvases' (to be viewed from a camera-crane). This idea was later adopted by Art Attack, which began in 1990. A regular feature of the programme was 'The Gallery', which displayed artworks sent in by young viewers. The easy-listening vibraphone music accompanying this feature - \\"Left Bank Two\\", composed by Wayne Hill - has passed into British TV musical lore. In later series, \\"Left Bank Two\\" alternated with John Williams' recording of \\"Cavatina\\", and in the final three series, the theme music was replaced by the more reggae-like \\"Passion Punch\\", composed by Stanley Myers, and The Gallery music was replaced by \\"Marguerite\\", by Barry Morgan, which is also well-remembered by many viewers. By the end of the eighth series in December 1983, Hart felt that the format of the programme, which essentially continued with much of the format of its predecessor Vision On, had become somewhat outdated and routine. Despite the award of a BAFTA in early 1984, viewing figures for Take Hart by 1983 had gradually fallen since the series' heyday in the late 1970s. In an attempt to update the image of the series, Take Hart was dropped in December 1983, and replaced by the relatively more popular series Hartbeat. Some 2 inch Quadruplex videotape master copies of Take Hart episodes were irretrievably junked by Adam Lee of the BBC archives in 1993 on the assumption that they were 'no use' and that examples of some other episodes were sufficient. A few months later, access to the material was requested by the head of Children's BBC's light entertainment department for a documentary on Tony Hart.

The New Testament was published in 1999, followed by the full Bible in March 2004.  Beginnings  The roots of the HCSB can be traced to 1984, when Arthur Farstad, general editor of the New King James Version of the Bible, began a new translation project. In 1998, Farstad and LifeWay Christian Resources (the publishing arm of the Southern Baptist Convention) came to an agreement that would allow LifeWay to fund and publish the completed work. Farstad died soon after, and leadership of the editorial team was turned over to Dr. Edwin Blum, who had been an integral part of the team. The death of Farstad resulted in a change to the Koine Greek source text underlying the HCSB, although Farstad had envisioned basing the new translation on the same texts used for the King James Version and New King James Version. He followed the Greek Majority Text which he and Zane C. Hodges had authored. After Farstad's death, the editorial team replaced this text with the consensus Greek New Testament established by twentieth-century scholars.Dewey, David, 2004. A User's Guide to Bible Translations (Downers Grove, IL: Intervarsity Press, 2004). . The editions of the United Bible Societies and of Nestle-Aland's Novum Testamentum Graece were primarily used, along with readings from other ancient manuscripts when the translators felt the original meaning was not clearly conveyed by either of the primary Greek New Testament editions. Translation philosophy Holman Bible Publishers assembled an international, interdenominational team of 100 scholars and proofreaders, all of whom were committed to biblical inerrancy.\\"The Bible is God's revelation to man ... it is God's inspired Word, inerrant in the original manuscripts.\\" From 'Introduction' to the HCSB. Text of the 'Introduction' also at BibleGateway.com. The translation committee sought to strike a balance between the two prevailing philosophies of Bible translation: formal equivalence (literal or word-for-word) and dynamic or functional equivalence (thought-for-thought). The translators called this balance \\"optimal equivalence.\\" According to the translators, the goal of an optimal- equivalence translation is \\"to convey a sense of the original text with as much clarity as possible\\". To that end, the ancient source texts were exhaustively scrutinized at multiple levels (word, phrase, clause, sentence, discourse) to determine their original meaning and intent. Afterwards, using the best language tools available, the semantic and linguistic equivalents were translated into as readable a text as possible. Textual source Making use of the most recent scholarly editions, the translators worked from the Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece 27th edition and the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament 4th corrected edition for the New Testament, and the 5th edition of the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia for the Old Testament. In the case of significant differences among Hebrew manuscripts of the OT or among Greek manuscripts of the NT, the translators followed what they believed to be the original reading, and then cited the alternative(s) in footnotes. There are a few portions of the NT that the translation team and most biblical scholars today believe were not part of the original text. However, these texts were retained (and indicated in large square brackets) because of their undeniable antiquity and their value for tradition and the history of NT interpretation in the church. Formats The HCSB is available in electronic form for WORDsearch and Bible Explorer software.Edwards, ElShaddai.

It is also available in Accordance Bible Digital Library.  Updates  The 2nd edition HCSB appeared in 2010. The most significant change was the expanded use of the covenant name of God, known as the tetragrammaton, transliterated as \\"Yahweh,\\" rather than translated as \\"LORD.\\" In the first edition Yahweh was found in 78 places; the update increased that to 495 instances.Gillis, John W., MaybeToday.org. \\"The HCSB 2nd Edition and the Tetragrammaton.\\" MaybeToday.org, Retrieved July 25, 2009. (The tetragrammaton appears in over 6,800 places in the Old Testament) Print editions began rolling out in 2010. In June 2016 B&H; Publishing announced a revision of the translation called the Christian Standard Bible (CSB).B&H; to Launch Christian Standard Bible (CSB) Version in 2017. B&H; Publishing Group The CSB print edition began appearing in March 2017 with the electronic edition already available. The 2017 edition of CSB returned to the traditional practice in English Bible versions, rendering the tetragrammaton with a title rather than a proper name, thus removing all 656 appearances of the personal name of God- Yahweh. Now Adonai (Hebrew for Lord) and the tetragrammaton are both translated by the same English word. This was a major reversal of the translation committee direction over the previous decade, of highlighting God's personal name in Scripture. As stated in the introduction of the HCSB: \\"Yahweh is used more often in the Holman CSB than in most Bible translations because the word in English is a title of God and does not accurately convey to modern readers the emphasis on God's name in the original Hebrew.\\"  Comparison of Psalm 83:18 HCSB: May they know that You alone‚Äî whose name is Yahweh‚Äî are the Most High over all the earth. CSB: May they know that you alone‚Äî whose name is the LORD are the Most High over the whole earth. References Further reading *Perry, John.

It almost always consists of meat, which is usually roast beef or fried seafood, often shrimp, crawfish, fish, oysters or crab. The meat is served on New Orleans French bread, known for its crisp crust and fluffy center. Preparation Roast beef was New Orleans' most popular po'boy filler up to the 1970s, citing The New Orleans Underground Gourmet. but a wide selection of fillings are possible as long as the \\"po' boy bread\\" is used), with fried shrimp, fried crawfish, fried catfish, Louisiana hot sausage, ham, fried chicken, duck, and rabbit listed among possible ingredients. A \\"dressed\\" po' boy has lettuce, tomato, pickles, and mayonnaise. Fried seafood po' boys are often dressed by default with melted butter and sliced pickle rounds. A Louisiana style hot sauce is optional. Non-seafood po' boys will also often have Creole mustard. Aside from meat and seafood, cheese has also been a recognized ingredient since the Great Depression, the sandwich's inception occurring at the beginning of that period (year 1929). The fried oyster po'boys are also referred the distinct name \\"oyster loaf\\", and apparently has a different and older history. The New Orleans \\"sloppy roast beef\\" po' boy, thick cuts are served with gravy, or for the \\"CrockPot tender\\" type the beef is stewed down until melded with its sauce, while in a third style, thinner slices are dipped in beef jus. Garlic is an optional seasoning. Origin of the term A roast beef po' boy In the late 1800s fried oyster sandwiches on French loaves were known in New Orleans as \\"oyster loaves\\", a term still in use. A sandwich containing both fried shrimp and fried oysters is often called a \\"peacemaker\\" or . A popular local theory claims that the \\"poor boy\\" (later \\"po' boy\\", etc.) as specifically referring to a type of sandwich, was coined in a New Orleans restaurant owned by Benjamin (\\"Benny\\") and Clovis Martin, former streetcar conductors originally from Raceland, Louisiana. The Martins established their eatery in 1921, but it wasn't until 1929 that the bakery of John Gendusa first baked the bread to be used for this sandwich. In 1929, during a four-month strike against the streetcar company, the Martin brothers served their former colleagues free sandwiches. The Martins had been interviewed on record regarding the origins of the sandwich. Benny Martin reminisced that they at the restaurant would jokingly referred to an incoming diner as \\"another poor boy\\" if he turned out to be one of the strikers. The Martin brothers were also posed the question of whether the name was inspired by some French or French patois word such as pourbois, but they denied that was the case. One New Orleans historian finds the Martin claim suspicious for several reasons, starting with the fact that it wasn't described by the local press until 40 years after the strike, and that prior to 1969 the story from the Martin brothers themselves was that they had created the po-boy for farmers, dock workers and other \\"poor boys\\" who frequented their original location near the French Market. (The Martin brothers did write a letter, reprinted in local newspapers in 1929, promising to feed the streetcar workers, but it referenced \\"our meal\\" and made no mention of sandwiches.) New Orleans Fried shrimp po' boy at Middendorf's New Orleans is known for its grand restaurants (see Louisiana Creole cuisine), but more humble fare like the po' boy is very popular. Po' boys may be made at home, sold pre- packaged in convenience stores, available at deli counters and most neighborhood restaurants. One of the most basic New Orleans restaurants is the po' boy shop, and these shops often offer seafood platters, red beans and rice, jambalaya, and other basic Creole dishes. The two primary sources of po'boy bread are the Leidenheimer Baking Company and Alois J. Binder. There is fierce competition between po' boy shops, and resident opinions of the best po' boy shop varies widely. Each year there is a festival in New Orleans dedicated to the po' boy, the Oak Street Po'Boy Festival. It is a one-day festival that features live music, arts, and food vendors with multiple types of po' boys. It is held in mid-November along a commercial strip of Oak Street in the city's Carrollton neighborhood. The festival gives \\"best-of\\" awards, which gives the chefs an incentive to invent some of the most creative po' boys. Variations Authentic versions of Louisiana-style po' boys can be found along the Gulf Coast, from Houston through the Florida Panhandle. The term \\"po' boy\\" has spread further and can be found in the South Atlantic States and in California, where it may instead refer to local variations on the submarine sandwich. Houston has its own variety of the Po-Boy, with chowchow added to ham, salami and provolone cheese.. The sandwich is currently known as the \\"Original Po' Boy\\" and was previously the \\"regular\\". There is also a version with added meats and cheeses called the \\"Super\\". Stephen Paulsen of the Houston Chronicle stated that the \\"Original\\" variety is \\"in the city‚Äôs food DNA, the Shipley Do-Nuts of sandwiches.\\" It was developed by Lebanese American Jalal Antone, owner of Antone's Import Company in the Fourth Ward, in 1962 after his brother-in-law stated that area residents at the time would not be accustomed to Levantine cuisine, and therefore the business needed to focus more narrowly on locally-familiar cuisine. John Lomax of Houstonia described the 1970s and 1980s as the height of their popularity and that the growth of chain sandwich shops that operated across the United States, the introduction of banh mi, and the poor quality of third party sandwiches in gas stations resulted in a decrease in popularity for the variety. Lomax in particular stated that the storage of the sandwiches at grocery stores ruined the flavor due to the delicate properties of the chowchow and mayonnaise. In 2002, 40% of the sandwiches sold at Antone's were the \\"Original\\" variety. Today traditional po' boy shops offer gumbos, bisques, jambalaya, crawfish kickers and boudin, a Cajun sausage.

He was a member of the Australian Senate representing the Australian Capital Territory for the Liberal Party of Australia from 2003 to 2013. He was the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory from 2000 to 2001; and was elected to the first parliament of the Australian Capital Territory, in 1989, later representing the Molonglo electorate until 2003. Early career Humphries was born in Sydney in 1958 and was educated at St Patrick's College, Strathfield before graduating from the Australian National University in Canberra with a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws. In 1977 he was elected President of the ANU Students' Association. He worked as a solicitor, a legal office in the ACT Administration, prior to self-government, and political advisor to Senator Amanda Vanstone. Political career Australian Capital Territory politics Humpries was elected to the unicameral ACT Legislative Assembly at the 1989 election. This election formed the first self-government of the Australian Capital Territory. Humphries represented the Liberal Party in a multi-member electorate covering the whole of the ACT. Humphries was re- elected at the 1992 (again in a single electorate), and at the 1995, 1998, and 2001 elections, in the multi-member electorate of Molonglo. Humphries variously served in a range of shadow ministerial roles in the Kaine and Carnell oppositions. In late 1989, when Trevor Kaine became the Chief Minister in a hung parliament, Humphries was appointed Minister for Health, Education, and the Arts. He held this position until the Labor Party led by Rosemary Follett regained government in mid-1991. Humphries became the Leader of the Opposition for a short time in 1991, and again in 2001‚Äì02. In 1995, when Carnell became the Chief Minister, Humphries was appointed to the following portfolios: * Minister for Arts and Heritage; Environment, Land and Planning; Police and Emergency Services; and Fair Trading (1995‚Äì1998) * Attorney-General (1995‚Äì2000) * Deputy Chief Minister (1997‚Äì2000) * Minister for Health and Community Care (1998) * Minister Assisting the Treasurer (1998‚Äì1999) * Treasurer (1999‚Äì2001) In 2000, Humphries succeeded Carnell as Chief Minister, retaining the portfolio of Treasurer. At the 2001 election, another hung parliament was the result, but the Liberal Party, led by Humphries, was defeated by the Australian Labor Party, led by Jon Stanhope after Labor formed Government with the support of the ACT Greens and Democrats. Federal politics In December 2002, Humphries was elected by the party membership as nominee to fill a forthcoming casual vacancy in the Senate caused by the announced resignation of Margaret Reid. Reid formally resigned on 14 February 2003, and Humphries was elected by the ACT Legislative Assembly on 18 February to fill the casual vacancy. The appointment made him the 500th person to serve in the Senate. In 2004 there was speculation the Liberals would reject his preselection for the Senate spot, but he won the ballot unopposed 97 votes to 43 votes (43 people voted for 'none of the above'). Humphries was re-elected at the 2004 federal election with 1.1361 quotas. Unopposed in the pre- selection ballot held on 26 June 2007, Humphries was chosen to contest the election later that year, and was again re-elected to the Senate at the 2007 federal election, receiving 1.03 quotas. Humphries' Senate seat was targeted by online activist organisation GetUp, as part of a campaign to prevent any one political party from having a majority of the seats in the federal upper house. The profile of the campaign was bolstered by polling that suggested that, for the first time, a coalition Senator might struggle to retain their seat in the ACT. Humphries was the first Liberal senator to vote against the Howard Government in its 11.5 years in office, when he voted to reverse the Federal Government's ban on the ACT's civil unions law in the Senate, claiming that the Commonwealth should not be able to automatically overturn ACT legislation. Humphries has served on several Australian Senate committees, including the Select Committee on Mental Health (2005‚Äì2006). In 2006, he became Chairman of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs. and is currently the Deputy Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs‚ÄîLegislation Committee and Chair of the Privileges‚ÄîStanding Committee with an active involvement in many others. In 2009, after the election of Tony Abbott as the Leader of the Opposition, Humphries was promoted to the front bench as the Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Families, Housing and Human Services and Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Citizenship. He was re-elected at the 2010 federal election, with 1.0118 quotas and was retained on the Opposition frontbench as Shadow Parliamentary Secretary to the Shadow Attorney-General and Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Materiel in September 2010. On 23 February 2013 Humphries lost Liberal pre-selection to one of his successors as ACT Liberal Leader, Zed Seselja. This happened with much controversy, in particular over party members, including many prominent ones, being barred from voting. The result was 114 (Seselja) to 84 (Humphries), or 58% to 42%. A re-election was held on 27 March 2013 with a higher membership turnout and vote, but it failed to overturn the result. The vote, 168-138 or 55%-45%, was closer than the first one. Humphries' term as a senator came to end on 6 September 2013, the day before the 2013 election. There was much bitterness and controversy in the aftermath of the Senate preselection result. For example, Humphries refused to attend a dinner that the party executive held for him, because of the way that it had been organised. In May 2014 Humphries was stripped of the Margaret Reid Award for distinguished service, a noteworthy party presentation, by the party's management committee. This was for comments critical of the party and some of its members, such as Opposition Leader Jeremy Hanson, who became Opposition leader after Seselja replaced Humphries as a Senator. One critique in particular, about the Canberra Liberals losing touch with the ACT community, raised the committee's ire, and drew a public rebuke from Hanson. A faction called the Menzies Group was organised in response to the preselection result and the perception that the far right of the Canberra Liberals was running the party. Humphries was involved in setting up this faction. It was active for a time, but now seems to have receded. On 14 December 2014, Humphries quit the Canberra Liberal Party. In an email, he told supporters that the Canberra Liberal Party in its current state was, amongst other things, undemocratic, still out of touch with the ACT community, unable to control its finances, and dominated by its far right. Hanson again publicly rebuked Humphries. Later career Upon leaving the Senate, Gary Humphries took on a role as a lobbyist with 1st State Government and Corporate Relations. Since 2014 Humphries has been a regular contributor to the Canberra-based RiotACT and to the Fairfax press, particularly The Canberra Times. Humphries was appointed Chair of the Anzac Centenary Public Fund Board in March 2014.http://minister.dva.gov.au/media_releases/2014/mar/va015.htm He was appointed a Deputy President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal from January 2015.

McBride was first elected to the provincial legislature in the 1898 election, and served in the cabinet of James Dunsmuir from 1900 to 1901. McBride believed that the province's system of non-party government was unstable and hindered development. After the lieutenant- governor appointed him the 16th premier in June 1903 and McBride announced that his government was a Conservative Party administration and would contest the upcoming election along party lines. On October 3, 1903, McBride's party, the British Columbia Conservative Party won the first provincial election to be fought along party lines with a two-seat majority. McBride was also the first native-born Premier in British Columbia's history. Richard McBride is interred in the Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria, British Columbia. Premier of British Columbia The new Conservative government attempted to stabilize the economy by cutting spending and raising new taxes. It also introduced progressive reforms of the province's labour law. In 1909 McBride unveiled plans for a provincial university and promised to build more railway lines. The party won commanding majorities in the 1909 and 1912 elections, almost shutting the Opposition out of the legislature. McBride's Conservatives were aligned with the federal Conservatives of Robert Borden, and helped them take power in the 1911 federal election. On the first day of the First World War, the provincial government purchased and took possession of two submarines ( and ) to defend the province from the threat of German attack. As provinces are not constitutionally allowed to maintain militaries, they were quickly transferred by order to the federal government within 48 hours and entered service with the Royal Canadian Navy in August 1914.CC1 and CC2 ‚Äî British Columbia's Submarine Fleet, CFB Esquimalt Naval and History Museum webpage His government was also responsible for the creation of the province's first university, the University of British Columbia, which opened its doors in 1915. The government's popularity waned as an economic downturn hit the province along with the mounting railway debts. McBride resigned on December 15, 1915, to become the province's representative in London, where he died in 1917. Legacy The small community of McBride, British Columbia was named after this premier during the time he was in office. Also named for the premier, the McBride River in northern British Columbia is a major tributary of the Stikine.

(During World War I the park was used for the cultivation of vegetables.) Mount McBride, a peak in Strathcona Park on Vancouver Island, is also named after the premier. Also named for him is McBride Boulevard in New Westminster which is the western ramp for the Pattullo Bridge.

Leoninos was banned by the Portuguese radio station after he released \\"Ngandu\\", which criticized the Portuguese colonialists. Leoninos broke up in 1965, but were followed by Os √öntu√©s, led by Leonel Aguiar, who added American, Argentinian, Congolese and Cuban musical influences, and introduced the electric guitar and other innovations. Popular music from the islands began to diversify, as bands like Quibanzas and Africa Negra. Among these groups was Mindelo, who fused S√£o Tom√©an rhythms with rebita, an Angolan style, to form puxa. In the latter part of the 20th century, songwriters like Zarco and Manjelegua found a domestic audience, and S√£o Tom√©an-Portuguese musicians like Camilo Domingos, Juka, Filipe Santo, A√ßoreano, Gapa established a Lisbon-based scene. Kizomba Angolan pop music is called Kizomba and was born out of Zouk music. Kizomba supports a fairly large number of artistes singing in both English and Portuguese.

In Switzerland, the postal codes have four digits. As with the postcode system introduced in Germany in 1993, a municipality can receive several postcodes. The fact that a locality (settlement) has its own postal code does not mean that it is an independent political municipality, but it is an official locality. In addition, a postcode can include several political communes (e.g.: 3048 Worblaufen, includes parts of the communes of Bern and Ittigen) or several cantons (e.g.: 8866 Ziegelbr√ºcke, includes parts of the cantons of Glarus and St. Gallen), which is why it is not possible to assign it unambiguously in both directions. In addition, it is often not possible to assign a unique postcode to post offices (post boxes) in larger cities. For this reason, six-digit postcodes are used internally. The Principality of Liechtenstein is also included in the Swiss postal code system, as is the German enclave of B√ºsingen am Hochrhein, which has its own Swiss postal codes in addition to its national one, D-78266. Before January 2020, the Italian enclave of Campione d'Italia also had a Swiss postcode, CH-6911, but this ceased to be valid, and all mail requires the use of the Italian postcode.IT and CH ‚Äì Customs territory of Campione d'Italia, Asendia, 23 December, 2019 This followed the enclave's entry into the European Union's Customs Area.Spedire una lettera a Campione? Attenzione al codice postale, Giorgio Doninelli, tio.ch, 31 December 2019 Also in Italy, Swiss Post previously held an office in Domodossola with the code CH-3907.Helvetia Philatelic Society of Great Britain New Letter, January 1988 This is now used for the village of Simplon.Gemeinde Simplon Format of postal codes (PLZ/NPA) The Swiss postal codes are assigned geographically, from west to east. They don't follow political divisions (cantons, districts), but they follow a routing allocation, following railways and PostBus routes. The postal code of big cities finish with 00, and it is not allocated if in the region there isn't a big center. Switzerland is divided into nine postal districts, numbered from west to east. Each district is subdivided into postal areas. Each area contains a maximum of one hundred units. The postal codes are made up as follows: :3436 Zollbr√ºck :3 = district (Bern) :34 = area (Burgdorf) :343 = route (Burgdorf - Langnau) :3436 = post office number (Zollbr√ºck) Today, the third digit has no real meaning anymore. In the past, mail was assigned to fixed railway or truck routes, but modern logistics do not need this practice any more. Postal codes of Liechtenstein are included in the same structure, using the range from 9480 to 9499. Summary of postal codes One-digit postcode areas Switzerland, defining the first digit of each four-digit postcode. Two-digit postcode areas Switzerland, defining the first two digits of each four-digit postcode. *1xxx - Region Western Switzerland (South) 10xx - Region Lausanne, Echallens (North-West) 11xx - Region Morges, Rolle 12xx - Canton of Geneva and Region Nyon 13xx - Region between Lausanne and Yverdon, Jura side (Cossonay, Orbe, Vallorbe) 14xx - Yverdon, Estavayer-le- Lac (VD/FR) 15xx - Moudon, Lucens, Avenches (VD/FR) 16xx - Romont, Bulle (VD/FR) 17xx - Region Fribourg to Lake Murten (M√ºnchenwiler) 18xx - Eastern shore of Lake Geneva (Vevey, Montreux), Chablais (Aigle, Monthey, St. Maurice VD/VS) 19xx - Lower Valais (Martigny, Sion) without Region Sierre *2xxx - Region Western Switzerland (North) 20xx - Region Neuch√¢tel 21xx - Val de Travers NE, Boudry 22xx - Upper Val-de-Ruz, 23xx - La Chaux-de- Fonds, Franches-Montagnes, Val-de-Ruz 24xx - Le Locle, La Sagne 25xx - Region Biel/Bienne, Lake Biel, Grenchen, Courtelary 26xx - Vallon de St. Imier 27xx - Bernese Jura (Tavannes, Tramelan, Moutier, Franches Montagnes) 28xx - Del√©mont 29xx - Ajoie (Porrentruy) *3xxx - Region Bern/Upper Valais 30xx - City of Bern and agglomeration 31xx - Southern agglomeration of Bern 32xx - Seeland (Aarberg, Ins, Kerzers, Lyss) 33xx - Region between Bern and Solothurn 34xx - Region Burgdorf, Oberaargau (except Langenthal) 35xx - Emmental 36xx - Region Thun 37xx - Region Spiez, Simmental 38xx - Region Interlaken, Haslital 39xx - Upper Valais with region Sierre, Crans Montana *4xxx - Region Basel 40xx - City of Basel 41xx - Leimental, Birstal, Riehen, Bettingen, Pratteln 42xx - Laufental, Schwarzbubenland 43xx - Western Fricktal (Rheinfelden, Stein AG) 44xx - Basel-Country 45xx - Region Solothurn 46xx - Region Olten 47xx - Region Oensingen, Balsthal 48xx - Region Zofingen 49xx - Region Langenthal *5xxx - Region Aarau 50xx - City of Aarau and Region, eastern Fricktal (Frick, Laufenburg) 51xx - Region Wildegg, Schinznach 52xx - Region Brugg, Mettauertal 53xx - Region Turgi to Koblenz 54xx - Region Baden, Wettingen 55xx - Region Mellingen 56xx - Region Lenzburg, Wohlen, Bremgarten, Muri (Freiamt) 57xx - Region Kulm, Beinwil, K√∂lliken, Safenwil *6xxx - Region Central Switzerland (Innerschweiz), Tessin 60xx - Region Lucerne, Obwalden 61xx - Entlebuch, Willisau 62xx - Region Sempach, Sursee, Hochdorf 63xx - Canton of Zug, Nidwalden 64xx - Canton of Schwyz (except Ausserschwyz), Canton of Uri 65xx - Region Bellinzona, Misox, Val Calanca (GR) 66xx - Locarno, Valle Maggia, Val Verzasca 67xx - Leventina, Val Blenio 68xx - Mendrisotto 69xx - Region Lugano and Campione d'Italia (Italian enclave) *7xxx - Region Graub√ºnden 70xx - Chur, Schanfigg (Arosa), Domat/Ems, Flims 71xx - B√ºndner Oberland 72xx - Pr√§ttigau, Davos 73xx - B√ºndner Herrschaft, Landquart, Sargans 74xx - Hinterrhein, Albula 75xx - Engadin, Val M√ºstair 76xx - Bergell 77xx - Poschiavo *8xxx - Region Z√ºrich 80xx - City of Zurich 81xx - Region Z√ºrcher Unterland 82xx - Region Schaffhausen, Kreuzlingen, B√ºsingen am Hochrhein (German enclave) 83xx - Kloten, Z√ºrcher Oberland, Hinwil, Hinterthurgau 84xx - Region Winterthur, T√∂sstal 85xx - Region Frauenfeld, Weinfelden, Amriswil, Romanshorn 86xx - Region D√ºbendorf, Z√ºrcher Oberland, See (SG) 87xx - Region Right shore of Lake Zurich, Gaster/See (SG), Canton Glarus 88xx - Region Linkes Z√ºrichseeufer, Ausserschwyz (March, H√∂fe, Einsiedeln SZ), Glarner Unterland, Sarganserland/Lake Walen 89xx - Region Limmattal, Albis, Knonauer Amt, Kelleramt (easternmost Aargau) *9xxx - Region Eastern Switzerland (Ostschweiz) 90xx - Region St. Gallen, Appenzell 91xx - Region Herisau 92xx - Region Gossau, Flawil, Uzwil, Bischofszell 93xx - Region Arbon 94xx - Region Rorschach, Rheintal, Liechtenstein 95xx - Region Wil 96xx - Toggenburg Cities *1211: Geneva (generic post code for all P.O.

Biography He was born in Guadalajara, state of Jalisco, where he began the study of painting at an early age, under Felipe Castro. At the age of 21, Murillo entered the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City to further his studies. After showing his abilities, Murillo was granted a pension in 1897 by President Porfirio D√≠az to study painting in Europe. There he broadened his scope of learning, with study of philosophy and law at the University of Rome, and many trips to Paris to listen to lectures about art given by Henri Bergson. His strong interest in politics led him to collaborate with the Socialist Party in Italy and work in the Avanti newspaper. In 1902 he was \\"baptized\\" \\"Dr. Atl\\" (the Nahuatl word for \\"water\\") by Leopoldo Lugones. Dr. Atl became very active in Mexico when he returned. In 1906 he participated with Diego Rivera, Francisco de la Torre and Rafael Ponce de Le√≥n and others in an exhibition sponsored by Alonso Cravioto and Luis Castillo Ledon, the editors of the magazine Savia Moderna.Rivera, Diego. 1993. Diego Rivera and the revolution: Mexico in times of ghanges [i.e. change]. [Mexico City]: Diego Rivera Studio Museum. p. 35. In 1906 Dr. Atl issued a manifesto calling for the development of a monumental public art movement in Mexico linked to the lives and interests of the Mexican people, a precursor of the Mexican Mural Movement launched in 1922. He was also commissioned by the Diaz government to design a glass curtain for the Institute of Fine Arts (Bellas Artes) under construction in Mexico City, which was executed by Tiffany's of New York. The curtain featured the two volcanoes overlooking the capital. He was also commissioned to paint a mural, which was postponed by the eruption of the Mexican Revolution against Porfirio D√≠az in 1910.D. Anthony White, Siqueiros, Biography of a Revolutionary Artist, Book Surge, 2009, pp. 19-21 Hacienda Santa Clara Study and Research Center in San Miguel Allende In 1911, Dr. Atl returned to Europe. In Paris, he founded a journal and wrote about the social and political issues of Mexico, and criticized General Victoriano Huerta, who had helped overthrow the democratically elected government of Francisco I. Madero. Dr. Atl supported the Constitutionalist faction in the Mexican Revolution, leaning towards \\"biblical socialism\\" and promoting the growth of art, literature, and science. When he returned from Europe, he joined the Constitutionalist forces led by Venustiano Carranza, and was appointed Director of the Academy of San Carlos. During the Revolution, he persuaded two young art students, Jos√© Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros, to join the Carrancistas and illustrated La Vanguardia, the carrancista official paper.White, Siqueiros, p.30 The winning faction of the Revolution rejected the euro-centric emphasis of the Mexican government in the 19th and early 20th century and following the Revolution, there was a revival of interest in Mexico's rich indigenous past and the popular arts, including folk dance, music, arts and crafts. Dr. Atl and other artists arranged exhibits of the folk arts and performances of popular dance and music and Dr. Atl prepared a two-volume study, Folk Arts in Mexico, published by the Mexican government in 1922.White, Siqueiros, p. 59) Statue of jalisciense painter Gerardo Murillo \\"Dr. Atl\\" in the \\"Roundabout of the Illustrious Jaliscienses\\" Dr. Atl's strong love of the outdoors and his active nature are seen in his many paintings which portray the landscapes of his era. Among his interests was the study of volcanoes, and he spent much time visiting both Popocat√©petl and Iztacc√≠huatl.Kristin G. Congdon and Kara Kelley Hallmark,Artists from Latin American cultures: a biographical dictionary. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, p. 16 In his 1950 book, C√≥mo nace y crece un volc√°n, el Paricut√≠n (\\"How a Volcano is Born and Grows ‚Äì Paricut√≠n\\"), he told of his experience of witnessing the eruption of Paricut√≠n in 1943. He was injured while observing the eruption and his leg was amputated. Besides painting volcanic landscapes, he was considered an expert volcanologist and his papers were valuable to understanding volcanos.White, Siqueiros. His literary writings include Cuentos de todos los colores (\\"Stories of All Colors\\"), which focuses on the themes of the Mexican Revolution and has been hailed as one of the best narrations of that historical period. His book La Perla (\\"The Pearl\\") inspired the writing of the novella, much the same, by John Steinbeck. He gave the Nahuatl name \\"Nahui Olin\\" (a symbol of Aztec renewal meaning \\"four movement,\\" the symbol of earthquakes) to Carmen Mondrag√≥n (1893‚Äì1978), a Mexican poet and painter with whom he established a very intense love relationship. Dr. Atl received numerous awards for his literature and art, including the Belisario Dom√≠nguez Medal of Honor, in 1956, and the National Arts Award in 1958. In 1961 Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond aired an episode based on an experience of Dr. Atl in 1920. The plot description states: \\"On the run from the authorities, Atl (played by David J. Stewart) takes refuge in a convent that is allegedly haunted by the ghost of an Aztec warrior. Of course, Atl is too intelligent a man to believe in such nonsense‚Äîuntil the Federale who is pursuing him is mysteriously strangled to death. The real Dr. Atl makes a guest appearance in the closing scene.\\" He died in Mexico City in 1964. He is buried in Panteon Civil de Dolores cemetery in the capital. Tribute Four chapters of Rebecca West's book 'Survivors in Mexico' deal with the life of Dr. Atl. On October 3, 2017, Google celebrated his 142nd birthday with a Google Doodle.

He then moved to British Columbia, where he settled in Nanaimo and took employment as assistant manager of the Vancouver Coal Mining & Land Co., Ltd. In 1878 he resigned and was appointed Inspector of Mines for the British Columbia government. He left that position and went into business as an iron and hardware merchant in 1880.

He debuted in Warlord (vol. 1) #55 (March 1982), and was created by Paul Kupperberg and Jan Duursema. Publication history Arion began as a back-up feature in the DC Comics book Warlord with issue #55. The Arion feature continued its run until issue #62. Arion then gained his own series, Arion Lord of Atlantis, beginning with #1, (November 1982). The series lasted for 35 issues plus a special which wrapped up the original storyline, running from November 1982 to September 1985 with the special shipping in November 1985. In 1992, Arion appeared in a 6 issue miniseries entitled Arion The Immortal. Arion also appeared in DC Comics Presents in a crossover with Superman.DC Comics Presents #75, November 1984 Fictional character biography The title character Arion is a powerful Homo Magi demigod from the nobility of ancient Atlantis. Arion is an immortal sorcerer who was born over 500,000 years ago. Ahri'ahn and Garn DaanuthThe Unofficial Garn Daanuth Biography are the twin sons of Calculha and Dark Majistra, two very powerful Atlantean god-beings. While Calculha raised Ari'ahn to be a follower of light and the Lords of Order, Majistra raised Garn to be an acolyte of the Lords of Chaos. Ari'ahn sacrificed his life to prevent his mother from attaining power that would cause the destruction of the Earth. For one hundred centuries he was raised in Darkworld (though only 20 years passed for him Arion #33, 1985) by Jheryl and Ghy. His departure from Darkworld left him an amnesiac, and when found he was brought back to the city. Arion's companions include an Atlantean guardsman, Wyynde,The Unofficial Wyynde Biography Lady Chian,The Unofficial Lady Chian Biography his lover and the captain of King D'Tilluh's royal guard, and Mara, a shapeshifter. Among his enemies are his brother Garn Daanuth, a formidable practitioner of the dark arts, Dark Majistra, his mother, and Chaon, the puissant god of evil and chaos.The Unofficial Arion, Lord of Atlantis Biography In his first appearances Arion was a sorcerer who protected the ancient, then land-bound kingdom of Atlantis during an upcoming ice age. After thousands of years of adventures, Arion lost his ability to channel magic directly from his body and had to rely on mystical artifacts for his magical powers. Post Crisis He later appeared during and after the Crisis on Infinite Earths event where he was made part of Power Girl's post- Crisis backstory.Secret Origins#11, February 1987 Later, an aged Arion is revealed be immortal and to have lost his magic and is living in Greenwich Village along with several former Atlantean gods and goddesses, including Chaon, Deedra, Gemimn and the Weaver. His companion, Mara, was trapped in canine form when the magic was lost.Arion the Immortal #1-2, 1992 Arion renews his old rivalry with his brother, Garn Daanuth, and works to stop the return of Atlantean magic by preventing Darkworld, revealed to be a sentient being, from slumbering.Arion the Immortal #3-6, 1992 After Zero Hour, Arion aided The Justice League America against Scarabus.Justice League America #93-94 He eventually turned up in the present day where his body was taken over by Mordru and his spirit imprisoned in Gemworld. His spirit was finally released and allowed to go to the afterlife by Power Girl and Hawkgirl (along with a recently awakened Dove), in order to weaken Mordru. Before his soul departed, Arion revealed to Power Girl that she was not his granddaughter and thus not an Atlantean. Arion seemingly reappeared in Infinite Crisis as one of the mystics gathered in Atlantis to keep the Spectre at bay, and later in the Day of Vengeance tie-in special as one of several magical beings summoned to help rebuild the shattered Rock of Eternity. No explanation was given for Arion's involvement at the time. It was later revealed that this Arion was, in fact, a pretender, a native of Akron named Bill Knightley who had decided to trade on Arion's name and reputation to build himself up in the mystical community.Superman #663 Camelot Falls A past version of Arion later appears. In the year 1659, Arion is awakened from a night of debauchery by visions of a cataclysmic future centered around the presence of Superman. Cut off from his natural magics, Arion employed certain artifacts to propel himself forward to Superman's present. Arriving in Metropolis, Arion subjected Superman and his friends at the Daily Planet to a vision of a possible future where Superman and other alien heroes' involvement in humanity caused people to become dependent on them, ultimately producing an apocalypse as their alien intervention held back the 'natural cycle' of civilisations falling upon reaching their peak, culminating in a mass apocalypse as the darkness they had held back for so long came at them with full force. Arion hoped to force Superman to retire and prevent the predictions from coming true. Superman was given two weeks in which to decide how he would deal with Arion's request, during which Arion illustrated his point by magically steering a \\"field trip\\" of adolescent New Gods, chaperoned by Lightray and Fastbak, to come crashing into Metropolis and go wild with their divine powers, causing untold havoc and general interference with the populace. Superman defused the situation with Lightray's help and deduced Arion's involvement. At roughly the same time, Arion kidnapped Bill Knightley from outside the Oblivion Bar, interrogated him, and nearly killed him. The only thing that saved Knightley was his knowledge of the recently begun \\"Tenth Age of Magic\\", a tumultuous change in the world's mystical equilibrium. Knightley claimed to be studying the shift and Arion decided he might have some value alive.Ahri'ahn (New Earth) - DC Database At the end of the two weeks, Arion and Superman met again; Superman chose to remain active as part of Earth's defense and deeply involved with humanity, refusing to give up hope that he could make a difference. Arion's vicious response was to cast a powerful mind manipulation spell, with the intent of using Superman as a weapon to remove the threat of other alien heroes. Superman was able to resist thanks to training from the Martian Manhunter after his period under the control of Maxwell Lord. Given a mystic shield by the Phantom Stranger to protect him from direct assault by Arion's magics (during which the Stranger revealed that, while Arion's prediction could come to pass, the loss of life and experience that would result if Superman simply allowed civilisation to fall meant that mankind had to try to find another way), Superman was able to defeat Arion and disarm him of his rings, amulets and charms from which he derived his magic. Arion was returned to 1659 where he plans his next move on Superman in the future. The New 52 In The New 52 Arion makes a brief cameo in the 2014 Secret Six relaunch. In a flashback, he is revealed to be the wizard that sealed away elder gods only known as the \\"Dark Giants\\", the antagonist that appear in the modern day threaten to be freed due to Black Alice's condition siphoning magic in the world and undoing the seals made to keep them in place. DC Rebirth Following the company-wide rebranding in DC Rebirth, Arion makes his debut in the 2016 Blue Beetle series. Sharing similarities to his previous version such as being a former king of Atlantis, he is changed to be an Atlantean-related god and mage whom turned into an insane villain from exposure to the Blue Beetle scarab and gains a more demonic appearance from usage of more malevolent magic. After being sealed away by Doctor Fate long ago, he uses his apprentice Mordecai Cull to lure Doctor Fate. Jaime Reyes, and the Blue Beetle scarab into undoing his sealing, stealing the scarab for himself to use its power to destroy the world. With the help of Doctor Fate and his allies, Jaime Reyes manages to defeat the sorcerer and his Atlantean demons created by his magic. Powers and abilities Arion is one of the most powerful sorcerers in the DC Universe, his Atlantean heritage and centuries of study in the sorcerous arts making him one of the most skilled sorcerers in any era and is considered to be the most powerful magician in ancient Atlantis. He was powerful enough to have defeated Etrigan, Wonder Woman and was a considerable threat to Superman, who needed the assistance of Phantom Stranger's magic to counter his own and enable him to defeat him. Prior to Rebirth, the helm of his vast array of magical abilities originate from deriving it from powerful sources and his body's ability to use magic without physically taxing him. Early in his life, his magics were mainly derived from stellar sources (such as the Sun) until he sacrificed them to end the Ice Age. He would later derive his sources from magical crystals containing his father's spirit (though finite in number) and chant-based spells, and magical objects, though his power was significantly weakened until the Weaver, an Atlantean god who controlled Atlantean-related magic by spinning it in the form of a thread, re- worked the magic within his soul and allowed him to perform magic by deriving it from the realm known as Darkworld and made him more powerful than he was ever before. However, his magics from Darkworld left him with little magical ability after its seeming destruction for over 45,000 years, making him reliant on objects once more until it is resurfacing. During Arion's appearance in Rebirth onward, the nature of his powers has seemingly changed; though he retained the ability to siphon magic from even entities as powerful as Doctor Fate, he is instead capable of performing magic naturally. In addition to his magical powers, Arion is also immortal and was trained in hand-to-hand combat and swordsmanship by ancient Atlantis's best warrior and lover, Lady Chian. He also retains psychic powers not connected to his magical powers, having the power of insight, judging the good and evil within an individual, divination, and cosmic awareness that could sense disturbances throughout time. During Rebirth onward, Arion was stated to also being an expressed genius responsible for Atlantis and Skataris's great technological prowess, his era being considered the peak of Atlantean magical and technological capabilities.

Life and career Golijov was born in and grew up in La Plata, Argentina, in a Jewish family that immigrated to Argentina from Romania. His mother was a piano teacher, and his father was a physician. He studied piano in La Plata and studied composition with Gerardo Gandini. In 1983, Golijov moved to Israel, where he studied with Mark Kopytman at the Jerusalem Rubin Academy. Three years later, he studied with George Crumb at the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree. In 1991, Golijov joined the faculty of the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he was named Loyola Professor of Music in 2007. During the 2012‚Äì13 concert season, he occupied the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer's Chair at Carnegie Hall. As of 2016, Golijov lives in Brookline, Massachusetts. Golijov has married and divorced twice. He had three children with his first wife, Silvia. He subsequently was married to and divorced from architect and designer Neri Oxman. Golijov's music Golijov grew up listening to chamber music, Jewish liturgical and klezmer music, and the nuevo tango of √Åstor Piazzolla.http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/three-songs- for-soprano-and-orchestra-osvaldo-golijov His Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind was inspired by the writings and teachings of Rabbi Yitzhak Saggi Nehor. In 1996, his work Oceana was premiered at the Oregon Bach Festival. He composed La Pasi√≥n seg√∫n San Marcos for the Passion 2000 project in commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the death of Johann Sebastian Bach. In 2010, he composed Sidereus for a consortium of 35 American orchestras, to commemorate Galileo. Golijov had a long working relationship with soprano Dawn Upshaw, who he called his muse. She premiered some of his works, often written specifically for her. These included Three Songs for Soprano and Orchestra and his popular opera, Ainadamar, which premiered at Tanglewood in 2003. Starting in 2000, Golijov composed movie soundtracks for documentaries and other films, including The Man Who Cried, Youth Without Youth, Tetro and Twixt. He also composed and arranged chamber music, including for the Kronos Quartet (Nuevo) and the St. Lawrence String Quartet. Deadline and plagiarism controversies Golijov came under scrutiny in 2011 for a series of commissions that were either delayed or cancelled. A violin concerto written for the Los Angeles Philharmonic was not completed in time, Golijov missed a second deadline the following year in Berlin, and a third composition missed its January 2013 premiere at Disney Hall. This followed a similar cancellation in 2010, when a scheduled song cycle had to be removed from the program when it was not completed in time. The March 2011 premiere of a new string quartet for the St. Lawrence Quartet was also postponed, though the work, Qohelet, was completed later that year and premiered by the quartet in October 2011. Around 2006, the Metropolitan Opera commissioned Golijov to compose an opera, to be performed in the 2018‚Äì19 season. In 2016, the Met cancelled the commission because of the composer's lack of progress. Tom Manoff, a composer and critic, and Brian McWhorter, a trumpeter, alleged that Golijov's Sidereus was largely copied from Michael Ward-Bergeman's composition Barbeich. Alex Ross of The New Yorker reviewed both scores and wrote, \\"To put it bluntly, 'Sidereus' is 'Barbeich' with additional material attached\\". Ross added that Ward-Bergeman was aware of Golijov's borrowings. A consortium of 35 orchestras had paid Golijov $75,000, supplemented by a $50,000 grant from the League of American Orchestras, to write a 20-minute work. The work that Golijov produced was only 9 minutes. Golijov had used that same musical material in his 2009 composition Radio. Golijov responded to these questions by explaining that he composed the original musical material jointly with Ward-Bergeman for a film score which in the end did not include the material, and that he used it by agreement with Ward-Bergeman, who did not comment publicly on the matter. Golijov cited Monteverdi, Schubert and Mahler as other composers who used existing musical material to create new music.  Works  Some of Golijov's notable works include the following: * Yiddishbbuk (1992), for string quartet. * The Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind (1994), for klezmer clarinet and string quartet (and later for clarinet and string orchestra) * Oceana (1996), cantata for soloist, boys choir, chorus, electric guitars, and reduced orchestra (strings, flutes, and percussion). * La Pasi√≥n seg√∫n San Marcos (St. Mark's Passion) (2000) * Three Songs for Soprano and Orchestra (2001).

The country's folk music traditions can be traced back to the times of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The country's musical traditions spread with its people to countries like Russia, Canada, United States, Kazakhstan and Latvia. The people of Belarus were exposed mostly to Russian pop music during this period and also after independence in 1991. In 2002, however, President Alexander Lukashenko has signed a decree requiring 50% of all FM broadcast music to be Belarusian in origin, and since January 1, 2005 the rule was made even stricter (75% of music broadcast each day must be Belarusian). However, it does not regulate the language of the songs, so most of the music which is broadcast is still in Russian. Traditional music Documentation of its music stretches back to at least the 15th century. Prior to that, skomorokhs were the major profession for musicians. A neumatic chant, called znamenny, from the word 'znamia', meaning sign or neume, used until the 16th century in Orthodox church music, followed by two hundreds of stylistic innovation that drew on the Renaissance and Protestant Reformation. In the 17th century, Partesnoe penie, part singing, became common for choruses, followed by private theaters established in cities like Minsk and Vitebsk. Music of Soviet Belarus Soviet folk rock VIA Pesnyary was one of the most popular Belarussian bands In the 20th century, the first secondary education institute in Belarus was founded (1924) and the first operas (Mikhas Podgorny by E. Tikotsky, In Virgin Forests of Polesie by Anatoly Bogatyrev and The Flower of Happiness by A. Turenkov) and ballets (The Nightingale by M Kroshner). Popular Soviet Belarusian music was composed by several prominent bands, many of whom performed Belarusian folk music. Folk rock act Pesniary, formed in 1969 by guitarist Vladimir Mulyavin, became the most popular folk band of the Soviet Union, and often toured over Europe. Pesniary's example inspired Siabry and Verasy to follow their way. The tradition of Belarus as a centre of folk and folk rock music is continued today. Late 1970s saw more straightforward rock bands such as Suzorie Modern Belarus Ska punk band Lyapis Trubetskoy Slaviansky Bazar, largest pop music festival of Belarus, in 2009 Belarus gained independence after the fall of the Soviet Union and new bands appeared, including N.R.M. (probably the best-known rock band of the late 1990s, and 2000s (decade), ULIS. Modern pop stars are also well-known, including Boris Moiseev and Lyapis Trubetskoy (though they tend to orient themselves toward Russia and Russian speakers). There are also electronic music performers like Autism, Energun 22, h.h.t.p., Dromos. Worth noting is Drum XTC performs live drum and bass. Around 2002 a new generation of electronic bands appeared, organized by Electrokids promo-group, including the groups like Randomajestiq, Stone People, Dreamlin, T-Trider, CherryVata and Koordinate of Wonders. Rock music of Belarus arose in Perestroika times. Bands like Bi-2 (currently living in Russia), Lyapis Trubetskoy, Krama and ULIS were founded in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Though rock music has risen in popularity in recent years, the Belarusian government has attempted to limit the amount of popular music aired on the radio, in favour of traditional music of Belarus. These restrictions have encouraged some Belarusian bands to sign up to Russian labels and to tour more in neighbouring countries. The tradition of Belarus as a centre of folk and folk rock music is continued today by Stary Olsa, Gods Tower, Vicious Crusade, Bristeil and Kriwi, among others. Stary Olsa is a Neo-Medieval music revivalist band that uses authentic instruments of the medieval Belarus (then part of Grand Duchy of Lithuania). In 2003, Belarus took part in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest for the first time. Their participant, Volha Satsiuk, came in 4th place. In 2004 Belarus made it to the semifinals of the regular Eurovision Song Contest. The country was represented by a duo Aleksandra and Konstantin, who failed to reach the final. Nevertheless, they won the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2005 the following year, with Ksenia Sitnik's song, 'My Vmeste'. Whilst the nation has never won the main contest, Belarusian-Norwegian singer-composer Alexander Rybak won for Norway in 2009, with his composition Fairytale earning a record score. The Belarusian authorities promote folk or \\"Slavic\\" music at the country's top musical event‚Äîthe state-sponsored Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk, an annual pop and folk music festival in Vitebsk. The biggest festival of Belarusian rock music takes place outside of Belarus, in Gr√≥dek, northeastern Poland, a small town some 40 kilometers east of Bia≈Çystok‚Äîthe center of Podlaskie Voivodeship, which is inhabited by a 200,000-strong Belarusian minority. The festival, held in July every year since 1990, is organized by the Belarusian Union of Students (BAS) in Poland. The official name of the event is the Music Festival of Young Belarus or Basovi≈°ƒça.

It is a popular spectator sport in several countries. Racing circuits International professional outboard hydroplane racing The Union Internationale Motonautique (or \\"UIM\\", headquartered in Europe) sanctions many different hydroplane categories of hydroplane powerboat racing. International UIM F-125, F-250, F-350 and F-500 Circuit powerboat races are very popular in Europe, Asia, and the United States. UIM's O-series hydroplane Formula Circuit racing events are some of the most prestigious Professional Racing Outboard (PRO) hydroplane events in the world. National powerboat racing teams compete for national and international titles in these hydroplane racing circuits. The American Power Boat Association (APBA) sanction similar PRO class national title events in the United States. Professional F-series World Cup Title powerboat races are held at Europe, United States, and western Asia race site locations every year. Equivalent APBA PRO classes are 125ccH (UIM O-125), 175ccH (UIM O-175), 250ccH (UIM O-250), 350ccH (UIM O-350), 500ccH (UIM O-500), 750ccH (APBA only), and 1000ccH classes. PRO classes using 500cc and larger displacement racing motors must be equipped with an enclosed re- enforced capsule, a certified racing harness restraint system, and a self- contained oxygen system for the driver. The faster classes of PRO hydroplanes (with straightaway speeds from around 75 to 120 miles per hour) use 2-cycle outboard motors running highly filtered methanol race fuel mixed with a pure castor or synthetic castor-based lubricating oil. All methanol-fueled and gasoline-fueled PRO racing outboard motors are direct drive (no gear reduction) and equipped with high performance, motorcycle racing style magneto ignition and carburetor systems. 125cc through 1000cc PRO series hydroplanes are not entry level classes in outboard powerboat racing. Investment costs are moderately high compared to similar APBA stock and modified outboard racing classes. K-PRO (an APBA entry class) is the only PRO hydroplane class running modified, recreational outboard motors; all other PRO hydroplane classes use 2-stroke outboard motors designed and manufactured specifically for PRO circuit racing purposes. Entry level classes for the PRO series classes are gasoline-fueled K-PRO (APBA sanctions only) and OSY-400 (sanctioned by both UIM and APBA.) International UIM teams have a formal crew that usually consists of family members, motor mechanic, hull builder sponsor, and owner/driver team in order to be successful at racing international F-125 through F-500 Circuit hydroplanes. Some hydroplane hull builders sponsor more than one team in a formula series circuit. PRO outboard hydroplane hulls are constructed with lightweight wood, composite, and hybrid (wood/composite/aluminum) materials. Outboard Performance Craft hydroplanes (sometimes called \\"tunnel boats\\") are a different racing series of UIM and APBA outboard powerboat classes. Limited hydroplane racing classes are inboard-engine powered boats that use high performance gasoline fuel. Grand Prix hydroplane racing Grand Prix (GP) is a class of boats featuring supercharged big-block V8 piston engines producing as much as 1,500 horsepower. The 23- to 26-foot craft are fast routinely attain speeds in excess of 170 miles per hour (273.5 km/h) in the straights. This class of boat races in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Unlimited hydroplane racing Although bit of a misnomer as the boats aren't without limits, unlimited hydroplanes have much fewer restrictions than with limited hydroplane racing. These 30 foot, 6,800 lbs boats most often powered by a Lycoming T55-L7 turbine engine (used from the Vietnam era to the present day in the CH-47 Chinook military helicopter), which is capable of up to 3000 horsepower with current restrictions. The T55-L7 powerplant creates high speed rotational energy, which is transferred through a gearbox at around 50% gear reduction to reduce propeller RPM. Unlimited hydroplanes are capable of speeds of 200+ mph on the straightaways and qualifying average lap speeds range from 130‚Äì165 mph. Modern hulls are constructed of composite materials such as honeycomb aluminum, fiberglass, laminated resin and carbon fiber. Many of the restored, fully operable unlimited hydroplanes at the Hydroplane & Raceboat Museum in Kent, Washington (such as the Miss Wahoo and Miss Thriftway vintage restorations) still use piston-powered inline aircraft engines. The primary racing circuit for unlimited racing is the H1 Unlimited, whose season runs from mid-February through September, consisting of five races. H1 Unlimited races occur throughout the United States, and the Middle East. Stock and modified outboard racing Stock Outboard Racing uses both hydroplane and runabout or monoplane hulls with racing engines that use a service outboard powerhead and a racing lower unit with a direct drive (i.e. start in gear, no gear reduction). Racing in this form ranges from classes designated as follows: A Class, B Class, C Class and D Class. There is also a Junior or \\"J\\" Class for kids between the ages of 9 and 16 years of age. The engine sizes range from to with speeds from to . In the C Stock Class, the Yamato Motor Company engines used in Ky≈çtei boat racing (with parimutuel betting) in Japan, are reconditioned, shipped to the United States and used for racing in these classes. Modified Outboard Hydroplane Racing classes are powered by modified stock outboard class motors. Motor modifications are limited to strict motor specifications and equipment alterations defined and published in APBA category rule books for these outboard hydroplane racing classes. Both stock and modified outboard classes run on a circular or triangular race course using a 3-minute \\"milling warm-up\\" period before a \\"flying\\" clock start. Heats usually consist of three laps around a closed race course. Drivers are disqualified if they cross the starting line before the official heat's clock start time (called \\"jumping the gun\\".) Just like the Stock & PRO hydroplane racing categories of APBA, the Modified hydroplane racing category membership has its own governing powerboat racing committee and rules book. Class B Stock Hydroplane Safety improvements In the early days of hydroplane racing, accidents, and even the deaths of drivers, were considered somewhat routine (as was true on most early motor racing). As top speeds increased, more attention was paid to driver safety, much like with driver safety programs being instituted in most motor racing series today, such as NASCAR, Formula One, INDYCAR, Grand Prix motorcycle racing, and others. Governing UIM and APBA powerboat racing organizations have promoted and specified many modern technology safety measures and rules for international hydroplane racing. Modern safety technology applications like composite fiber re-enforced Kevlar cockpits, capsule-enclosed driver modules with improved safety harness systems (in PRO, OPC, and limited/unlimited inboard hydroplanes), flip-over incident escape hatches & engine shut-off features, oxygen system & aircraft-quality windscreen canopies for capsule hulls, and advanced ballistic impact-resistant suits with improved helmet/neck brace wear‚Äîall of these improvements making the boats and specialized personal protection gear safer for the present-day driver. The HANS device, developed by sportscar racer Jim Downing, has become mandatory in many classes, and future advanced head and spine protection applications (driver upper body control & stabilization during high G-force events) are being tested in future hydroplane capsule designs.

More formally, it states that the decision rules of Keynesian models‚Äîsuch as the consumption function‚Äîcannot be considered as structural in the sense of being invariant with respect to changes in government policy variables. The Lucas critique is significant in the history of economic thought as a representative of the paradigm shift that occurred in macroeconomic theory in the 1970s towards attempts at establishing micro-foundations. Thesis The basic idea pre- dates Lucas's contribution‚Äîrelated ideas are expressed as Campbell's law and Goodhart's law‚Äîbut in a 1976 paper, Lucas drove to the point that this simple notion invalidated policy advice based on conclusions drawn from large-scale macroeconometric models. Because the parameters of those models were not structural, i.e. not policy-invariant, they would necessarily change whenever policy (the rules of the game) was changed. Policy conclusions based on those models would therefore potentially be misleading. This argument called into question the prevailing large-scale econometric models that lacked foundations in dynamic economic theory. Lucas summarized his critique:Lucas (1976), p. 41. > Given that the structure of an econometric model consists of optimal > decision rules of economic agents, and that optimal decision rules vary > systematically with changes in the structure of series relevant to the > decision maker, it follows that any change in policy will systematically > alter the structure of econometric models. The Lucas critique is, in essence, a negative result. It tells economists, primarily, how not to do economic analysis. The Lucas critique suggests that if we want to predict the effect of a policy experiment, we should model the \\"deep parameters\\" (relating to preferences, technology, and resource constraints) that are assumed to govern individual behavior: so-called \\"microfoundations.\\" If these models can account for observed empirical regularities, we can then predict what individuals will do, taking into account the change in policy, and then aggregate the individual decisions to calculate the macroeconomic effects of the policy change.Lucas (1976), p. 21. Shortly after the publication of Lucas's article, Kydland and Prescott published the article \\"Rules rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans\\", where they not only described general structures where short- term benefits are negated in the future through changes in expectations, but also how time consistency might overcome such instances. That article and subsequent research led to a positive research program for how to do dynamic, quantitative economics. The Lucas critique was an important methodological innovation. It does not invalidate that fiscal policy may be countercyclical, which some associate with John Maynard Keynes. Examples One important application of the critique (independent of proposed microfoundations) is its implication that the historical negative correlation between inflation and unemployment, known as the Phillips curve, could break down if the monetary authorities attempted to exploit it. Permanently raising inflation in hopes that this would permanently lower unemployment would eventually cause firms' inflation forecasts to rise, altering their employment decisions. In other words, just because high inflation was associated with low unemployment under early 20th century monetary policy does not mean that high inflation should be expected to lead to low unemployment under every alternative monetary policy regime. For a simple example, consider the question of how much Fort Knox should spend on protection. Fort Knox has never been robbed. Statistical analysis using high-level, aggregated data would therefore indicate that the probability of a robbery is independent of the resources spent on guards. The policy implication from such analysis would be to eliminate the guards and save those resources. This analysis would, however, be subject to the Lucas Critique, and the conclusion would be misleading. In order to properly analyze the trade-off between the probability of a robbery and resources spent on guards, the \\"deep parameters\\" (preferences, technology and resource constraints) that govern individual behaviour must be taken explicitly into account. In particular, criminals' incentives to attempt to rob Fort Knox depends on the presence of the guards. In other words, with the heavy security that exists at the fort today, criminals are unlikely to attempt a robbery because they know they are unlikely to succeed. However, a change in security policy, such as eliminating the guards, would lead criminals to reappraise the costs and benefits of robbing the fort. So just because there are no robberies under the current policy does not mean this should be expected to continue under all possible policies. In order to answer the question of how much resources Fort Knox should spend on protection, the analyst must model the \\"deep parameters\\" and strive to predict what individuals will do conditional on the change in policy.

It is one of the groups that has documented cases and located former German and French officials for prosecution such as Klaus Barbie, Ren√© Bousquet, Jean Leguay, Maurice Papon and Paul Touvier, who have been implicated in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of French and foreign Jews during the Second World War. The Klarsfelds were among organised groups who filed cases decades after the war, sometimes as late as the 1990s, against such officials for their crimes against humanity. In the years before 1989 and the break-up of the Soviet Union, the Klarsfelds (Serge Klarsfeld and his wife Beate) frequently protested against the Eastern Bloc's support for the PLO and anti-Zionism. Recognition for their work has included France's Legion of Honour in 1984. In 1986, their story was adapted as an American television film starring Tom Conti, Farrah Fawcett and Geraldine Page. In 2008, a French television movie was made about them. On 1 January 2014, the Klarsfelds' Legion of Honour ranks were upgraded: Serge became Grand officier.Jennifer Schuessler. Arts, Briefly. The New York Times, 2 January 2014, p. C2, under \\"Danielle Steel Awarded French Legion of Honor\\": \\"Among the other honorees were the Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld.\\" On 26 October 2015, the UNESCO designated the Klarsfelds as \\"Honorary Ambassadors and Special Envoys for Education about the Holocaust and the Prevention of Genocide\\". Marriage and family Serge married Beate K√ºnzel in 1963 and settled in Paris. Their son, (born 1965), became a human rights attorney and worked for Nicolas Sarkozy while he was minister of the interior.  Activism  Early activism In 2012 the archivist of the Stasi revealed that Beate Klarsfeld's attack on German Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger by publicly slapping him on 7 November 1968 was carried out in agreement with and the support of the government of East Germany, which was conducting a campaign against West German politicians (see Braunbuch). Beate Klarsfeld was paid 2,000 DM by the Stasi for her actions. Both Serge and Beate Klarsfeld were revealed to have been regular Stasi contacts. According to the State Commissioner for the Stasi Archives of Saxony, they cooperated with the Stasi in the 1960s in blackmailing West German politicians for Second World War activities. In 1974, Serge and Beate Klarsfeld were both convicted in West Germany on felony charges of attempted kidnapping of Kurt Lischka, a former Gestapo chief whose prosecution in Germany was prevented by legal technicalities, in Cologne in order to transport him to France for prosecution. After conviction of felony charges, they were each sentenced to two months in prison. Following international protests, the sentence was suspended. Activism by the Klarsfelds and by descendants of Lischka's victims eventually resulted in changes to the laws. In 1980, Lischka was convicted of a felony in West Germany and sentenced to prison. Attack on the Klarsfelds The Klarsfelds' activities and methods generated controversy. On 9 July 1979, the Klarsfelds were the targets of car bombing at their home in France. No one was in the car when the bomb detonated, and no one was injured in the vicinity of the blast. Individuals purporting to represent the Nazi ODESSA claimed responsibility for the attack. Later activism They are notable in the postwar decades for having been involved in hunting and finding German Nazis and French Vichy officials responsible for the worst abuses of the Holocaust, in order to prosecute them for alleged war crimes. Several officials were indicted due in part to the work of the Klarsfelds; they included the following, with the years of their convictions or deaths in parentheses: *Klaus Barbie (1987) *Ren√© Bousquet (1993) *Jean Leguay (1989) *Maurice Papon (1998) *Paul Touvier (1994) In the 1970s the Klarsfelds considered kidnapping Barbie in much the same way the Mossad did Eichmann but the plan fell through. They decided instead to bring international pressure to force his extradition. By 1995, only four senior French Vichy officials had been indicted for war crimes, and by that year, only Paul Touvier had stood trial.MARY DEJEVSKY, \\"Killer's tale stirs ghosts of Vichy\\", The Independent (UK), 7 November 1995, 28 May 2012 Like Touvier, the former Vichy official Maurice Papon was convicted of war crimes in 1998. The Klarsfelds continued to publicize the wartime activities of prominent politicians in Germany and Austria. In 1986 the Klarsfelds campaigned against former United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, who was elected President of Austria amid allegations that he had covered up his wartime activities as an officer in the Wehrmacht. In 1996, during the warfare in the former Yugoslavia, the Klarsfelds joined the outcry against Radovan Karad≈æiƒá and Ratko Mladiƒá for alleged war crimes and genocide of Bosnian Muslims. In December 2009, Serge Klarsfeld defied an existing consensus within the Jewish community by saying that the beatification of Pope Pius XII was an internal matter of the Church. He said that Jews should not get too involved in the process. Many Jews were protesting the beatification, as they said that Pius XII had contributed to the persecution of Jews throughout Europe, and had not brought the power of the church against the Nazis for their mistreatment of Jews and other persecuted peoples. Activism in France In France in 1979 the Klarsfelds created l'Association des fils et filles des d√©port√©s juifs de France (Association of the sons and daughters of Jews deported from France) or FFDJF. It defends the cause of the descendants of deportees, to have the events recognised and to prosecute people responsible. In 1981, the association commissioned a memorial in Israel to the deported French Jews; it bears the name, date and place of birth of 80,000 French victims of the Nazi extermination. About 80,000 trees were planted to shape a forest of remembrance. Serge Klarsfeld is also Vice-President of the Fondation pour la M√©moire de la Shoah. In 1989 FFDJF was one of the groups to file a case against Ren√© Bousquet, head of the French Police in the Vichy government, for crimes against humanity. He was indicted by the French government in 1991, but killed in 1993 shortly before his trial was to begin. The Klarsfelds' work on behalf of the descendants of Jewish deportees was formally recognised by President Jacques Chirac in a 1995 speech. He acknowledged the nation's responsibility for the fate of Jews in its territory during the Second World War. The government passed a law on 13 July 2000 to establish compensation for orphans whose parents were victims of anti-Semitic persecution. On 7 July 2010, Serge Klarsfeld was awarded the title of commandeur de la L√©gion d'honneur by Prime Minister Fran√ßois Fillon at H√¥tel Matignon, the official residence of France's Prime Minister. In January 2012, the Klarsfelds, along with prominent French-Armenian singer Charles Aznavour, director Robert Gu√©diguian, and philosophers Bernard-Henri L√©vy and Michel Onfray, signed an appeal to the French Parliament to ratify a bill to establish penalties for people who deny the Armenian Genocide. In July 2018, the Klarsfelds were profiled at length on CNN, which noted their swing away from Nazi hunting to a more-general push for social justice in opposition to the modern right. Today, they fight for human life, freedom, and social protection. Works In 1978, Serge Klarsfeld published M√©morial de la D√©portation des Juifs de France (Memorial of the Deportation of the Jews of France), a book listing the names of more than 80,000 Jews deported from France to concentration camps or killed in France. Copies of the original lists that were typed up for each deportation train, found by the Klarsfelds in an archive of the Jewish community in Paris, were the basis for the name, place, date of birth and nationality of all deportees, who were listed according to each deportation train. The book records more than 75,700 Jews who were deported to the concentration camps from France and establishes that just 2,564 of the deportees survived the war. Most of the deportees were sent from the transit camp at Drancy, ranging in age from newly born to 93 and originating from 37 countries, the most from France (22,193) and Poland (14,459), with a small number from the United States (10) and even one from Tahiti. In 2012, Klarsfeld published an updated version of the Memorial, adding women's maiden names, deportees last address in France and the transit or internment camp they went through. This list is sorted in alphabetic order. From 2018, this memorial is also available as an online search engine. Serge Klarsfeld wrote a preface to Une adolescence perdue dans la nuit des camps by Henri Kichka. Serge Klarsfeld and his wife Beate co-wrote an autobiography, Hunting the Truth: Memoirs of Beate and Serge Klarsfeld, published in 2018.Hunting the Truth: Memoirs of Beate and Serge Klarsfeld, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2018, . Cooperation with the Stasi Since the reunification of Germany and the opening of Stasi files, in 2012 Lutz Rathenow, the State Commissioner for the Stasi Archives of Saxony, has stated that Beate Klarsfeld cooperated with the Stasi of East Germany in the 1960s. They gave her material containing incriminating information about the wartime activities of West German politicians.Ex-DDR-B√ºrgerrechtler wirft Klarsfeld Stasi-Kontakte vor , Stern, 29 February 2012 The cooperation of both Beate and Serge Klarsfeld with the Stasi and their status as contacts was also documented in a new book by former Stasi officers, G√ºnter Bohnsack and Herbert Brehmer. Later years in Germany In May 2015, Beate Klarsfeld and her husband Serge received the German Federal Cross of Merit, in recognition of their efforts to bring Nazi war criminals to justice.

The film covers themes including materialism, loss of innocence, coming of age, and capitalism. Best known as Cruise's breakout film, Risky Business was a critical and commercial success, grossing more than $63 million against a $6.2 million budget. Plot Joel Goodson is a high-achieving high school student who lives with his wealthy parents in the Chicago North Shore area of Glencoe. His father wants him to attend Princeton University, his alma mater, so Joel participates in Future Enterprisers, an extracurricular activity in which students work in teams to create small businesses. When his parents go away on a trip, Joel's friend, Miles, convinces him to take advantage of his newfound freedom to have some fun. On the first night, he raids the liquor cabinet, plays the stereo loudly, and dances around the living room in his briefs and button-down shirt to \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\". The following day, Miles calls a prostitute named Jackie on Joel's behalf. When Jackie turns out to be a trans woman, Joel pays her just to leave, but before she does, she gives Joel the number for another prostitute named Lana. That night, Joel is unable to sleep and hesitantly calls Lana, who turns out to be a gorgeous blonde woman, and they stay sexually engaged all night. Lana asks Joel for $300 for her services. He goes to the bank, but when he returns, Lana is gone, along with his mother's expensive Steuben glass egg. Joel finds Lana and demands the egg back, but they are interrupted by Lana's pimp Guido, who pulls a gun. While in his father's Porsche 928, Joel is chased by Guido, but eventually escapes. Lana tells Joel that the egg is with the rest of her stuff at Guido's. Joel lets Lana stay at his house while he goes to school. When he returns, his friends have come over, and Lana has invited another prostitute, Vicki, to stay, but Joel rejects the idea. The women leave, only to encounter Guido and get into an altercation on Joel's front lawn before running back into his house. Joel agrees to the women spending one more night. Later that night, Joel, Lana, Vicki, and Joel's friend Barry go out and get high on marijuana. After Lana accidentally undoes the parking brake in the Porsche while retrieving her purse, the car rolls down the hill and onto a pier (despite Joel's desperate attempt to stop it); the pier collapses, and the Porsche sinks into Lake Michigan. When Joel takes the car to a repair shop, he is horrified to learn how much it will cost to fix it. He and Lana later decide to turn his parents' house into a brothel for a night; Joel's share of the profits will pay for the repairs. The party is a huge success; the house is packed with Joel's friends and classmates and Lana's co-workers. However, the recruiter from Princeton, Rutherford, chooses that night to interview Joel for admission to Princeton. The interview is plagued by interruptions, and Rutherford is unimpressed by Joel's r√©sum√©. Afterwards, he stays at the party and becomes acquainted with Lana's friends. After the party, Joel and Lana go and make love on the Chicago \\"L\\". The next morning, Joel finds his house has been burgled. When he tries to call Lana, Guido answers; he tells Joel that he will let Joel buy back his furniture. Joel and his friends manage to get everything moved back in just as his parents walk in, though his mother notices a crack in her egg. Later, Joel's father congratulates him; the interviewer was very impressed, and Joel will be accepted into Princeton. Joel meets Lana at a restaurant, and they speculate about their future. She tells him that she wants to keep on seeing him; he jokes that it will cost her. Cast Soundtrack The film was scored by Tangerine Dream. Their music comprises nearly half of the soundtrack album. Also included are songs by Muddy Waters, Prince (\\"DMSR\\"), Jeff Beck, Journey, Phil Collins (\\"In the Air Tonight\\"), and the song for which the film is best known, \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" by Bob Seger.

The film also includes \\"Hungry Heart\\" by Bruce Springsteen, \\"Every Breath You Take\\" by The Police, and \\"Swamp\\" by Talking Heads. The LP and CD versions of the soundtrack include two different versions of \\"Love on a Real Train (Risky Business),\\" both of which are different recordings from the version used in the film for the final love scene or closing credits. Reception Box office The film opened in 670 theaters, with an opening weekend gross of $4,275,327. It went on to gross a total of $63.5 million domestically. Critical response Risky Business was acclaimed by critics. It is also considered by many as one of the best films of 1983. Janet Maslin, in her 1983 review of the film for The New York Times, called it \\"part satire, part would-be suburban poetry and part shameless showing off\\" and said the film \\"shows an abundance of style\\", though \\"you would be hard pressed to find a film whose hero's problems are of less concern to the world at large.\\" She called De Mornay \\"disarming as a call girl who looks more like a college girl\\" and credits Cruise with making \\"Joel's transformation from straight arrow to entrepreneur about as credible as it can be made.\\" The film holds a 92% \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes based on 49 reviews, with the site's consensus stating; \\"Featuring one of Tom Cruise's best early performances, Risky Business is a sharp, funny examination of teen angst that doesn't stop short of exploring dark themes\\". Roger Ebert's review was positive, calling it a film of: Variety said the film was like a \\"promising first novel, with all the pros and cons that come with that territory\\" and complimented Brickman on \\"the stylishness and talent of his direction.\\"Review of Risky Business by Variety Legacy The remastered 25th-anniversary edition offers \\"both the upbeat studio ending and Mr. Brickman's original, more tentative and melancholic conclusion\\". In 2015, the film was #31 on Entertainment Weeklys list of the 50 Best High School Movies. The magazine called the film a \\"sharp satire of privileged suburban teens\\", portraying the \\"soul-crushing pressure to be perfect.\\" In the years since the film's release, the iconic scene featuring Cruise's character dancing in just his shirt, socks and white briefs to Bob Seger's rendition of \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" has been recreated in episodes of many television series, as well as in films, parodies, and advertisements. The song was #100 on AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Songs list.

He served as the Premier of British Columbia from 1900 to 1902 and the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia from 1906 to 1909. Early life and business career Son of Robert Dunsmuir, he was heir to his family's coal fortune. The Dunsmuir family dominated the province's economy in the late nineteenth century and was a leading force in opposing organized labour. Dunsmuir managed his family's coal business from 1876 until 1910, increasing profits and violently putting down efforts to unionize. In 1905, he sold his Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway to the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1910, he sold his coal mining companies, Union Colliery of British Columbia and R. Dunsmuir & Sons, to Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd (CCD).  Opposition to organized labour  In the 42 years that the Dunsmuirs owned the collieries, they never recognized their employees' attempts to unionize or create better working conditions. Threats, spies, blacklists and scab labour were among the tactics used by Dunsmuir to break strikes. When he could not break a strike with scab labour, he used his influence to have the provincial government call in the militia. Dunsmuir stated during a royal commission: \\"I object to all unions...They simply take the management of the mine...I want the management of my own works, and if I recognize the union, I cannot have that.\\" Dunsmuir provoked further rage when he ordered workers to relocate their homes at a new pit. Workers also resented low wages and the dangerous conditions that Dunsmuir imposed upon them. Mine owners at the time regularly ignored safety and sanitary conditions, and provincial inspectors were slow to bring them to justice. Dunsmuir contributed to the mines of British Columbia being among the most dangerous in the world. Between 1889 and 1908, twenty- three men were killed in the production of every million tons of BC coal; the average for North America as a whole was six deaths per million tons. In 1901, while serving as Premier, many men perished in his collieries.  Political career  Dunsmuir entered provincial politics in 1898, winning a seat in the provincial legislature, and he became the 14th Premier in 1900. His government attempted to resist popular pressure to curtail Asian labour and immigration, not for humanitarian reasons, but to ensure a cheap labour pool for business. It also promoted railway construction and accomplished a redistribution of seats to better represent population distribution in the province. Dunsmuir visited England and the United States in 1902, but disliked politics after his return and resigned as Premier in November 1902. In 1906, he became the province's eighth Lieutenant Governor. He retired in 1909 and lived out his remaining years at the baronial mansion that he had constructed at Hatley Park. Legacy Dunsmuir founded the town of Ladysmith, British Columbia. He is interred in the Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria, British Columbia. One of his daughters, Jessie Muriel, married, as her first husband, the couturier Edward Molyneux. His second-born son, James A. Dunsmuir Jr., died in the sinking of the RMS Lusitania in 1915. His last child, Dola Dunsmuir, married Lieutenant- Commander Henry Cavendish and was rumored to be Tallulah Bankhead's lover.

The seat was originally a safe Labor seat, but a redistribution added some Liberal-friendly territory in the Scenic Rim, which all but erased Labor's majority. Elson defeated Labor incumbent Mary Crawford on a nine-percent swing, turning Forde into a safe Liberal seat in one stroke. Her victory was part of Labor's near-total collapse in Queensland; Labor was cut down to only two seats there. In October 2006, Kay Elson announced that she would not be seeking a fifth term and retired at the 2007 Election. By this time, she had built up her majority to 12 percent.

The Mende and Temne each account for slightly more than 30% of the total population . The Mende are predominantly found in the Southern Province and the Eastern Province, while the Temne are found primarily in the Northern Province and the Western Area, including the capital city of Freetown. Some of the major cities with significant Mende populations include Bo, Kenema, Kailahun, and Moyamba. The Mende belong to a larger group of Mande peoples who live throughout West Africa. The Mende are mostly farmers and hunters. During the civil war the Civil Defense Force (CDF), a militia group, was founded by Dr. Alpha Lavalie, a Mende himself, to fight the rebels along with government troops. The forces included five groups drawn from all major ethnic groups in the country: Tamaboros, Hunters, Donso, Kapras, and the Kamajors. Kamajor is a Mende term for hunter; they were not only the dominant warring factions but the most fearful among the CDF militias headed by late Deputy Minister of Defense, Chief Hinga Norman. To date, the Kamajors are honored among the elite groups of men and women who fought to restore democracy in modern Sierra Leone. The Mendes are divided into Kpa-Mende, who are predominantly in the South - in Moyamba district, the Golah-Mende, from the Gola forest between Kenema and Pujehun districts into Liberia - a national reservation landmark, Sewa-Mende, who settled along the Sewa River, Vai-Mende also in Liberia and Pujehun district, Sierra Leone and the Koh-Mende who are the dominant tribe in Kailahun district with the Kissi (Ngessi) and Gbandi both of whom are in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. The secret \\"Poro\\" society is for men while \\"Sande\\" society for women both of whom initiate the young into adulthood. Those who join either of the male or female secret societies are referred to as: The halemo are members of the hale or secret societies, and kpowa are people who have never been initiated into the hale. The Mende believe that all humanistic and scientific power is passed down through the secret societies. The Mende language is widely spoken in Liberia more so in areas once considered part of Liberia. In the year 1984, then President Samuel Doe threatened to retake the part of Sierra Leone that was once Liberia. Both countries have Mende, Gola, Vai, Gissi and Gbandi tribes but the Mende are the dominant population. Mende names are common in Liberia including towns that share names on both side of the border; for example, Guma Mende is popular section in Loffa, Liberia and those living along the borders claim dual citizenship. Mende language is also taught in Sierra Leone schools and the Alphabet is closely identical to the English Alphabet. For example, the letter 'C' is flipped facing left and pronounced 'orh'; 'E' is written with broken edges and pronounced 'eh'. The Mende speak the Mende language among themselves, but their language is also spoken as a regional lingua franca by members of smaller Sierra Leonean ethnic groups that inhabit the same part of the country. Their language is spoken by around 46% of Sierra Leone's population. Like a majority of African nations, Sierra Leone's political parties are often tied to specific ethnic groups and have been dominated by the Mende, on the one hand, and the Temne and their long-time political allies, the Limba, on the other. The Mende are known to typically support the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), while the Temnes and Limbas are associated with the All People's Congress party (APC). A Mende woman in the village of Njama quee in Moyamba District. History Regional warfare throughout the 19th century led to the capture and sale of many Mende-speakers into slavery. Most notable were those found aboard the Amistad in 1839. They eventually won their freedom and were repatriated. This event involved fifty-two free Mende tribesmen, stolen by Portuguese slavers in 1839, who were shipped via the Middle Passage to Havana, Cuba, where they were sold to Cuban sugar plantation owners, Jos√© Ruiz and Pedro Montes. After working the plantation, they were placed on the schooner Amistad and shipped to another Cuban plantation. On the way, they escaped their bondage and were led in a rebellion by Sengbe Pieh. They told the crew to return them to Africa. Their efforts to return home were frustrated by the ship's remaining crew, who navigated up to the United States. The ship was intercepted off Long Island, New York, by a U.S. Coastal brig. The Cubans merchants Ruiz and Montes denounced the Mende and asserted that they were their property. The ensuing case, heard in Hartford and New Haven, Connecticut, affirmed that the men were free, and resulted in the return of the thirty-six surviving Mende to their homes. In the Americas, especially the United States, researchers have discovered that elements of African culture had long persistence. In some areas where there were large groups of enslaved Africans, they kept much of their heritage. In the 1930s African-American linguist Lorenzo Dow Turner found a Gullah family in coastal Georgia that had preserved an ancient song in the Mende language (\\"A waka\\"), passing it down for 200 years. In the 1990s three modern researchers  Joseph Opala, Cynthia Schmidt, and Tazieff Koroma ‚Äî located a Mende village in Sierra Leone where the same song is still sung today. The story of this ancient Mende song, and its survival in both Africa and the US, is chronicled in the documentary film The Language You Cry In.http://www.folkstreams.net/film,270 Tradition and culture The Mende traditionally live in villages of 70 to 250 residents, which are situated from 1.5 to 5 kilometers apart. There is little or no mechanization over the greater part of rural Mende country. Mende farmers use hoes and machetes, but few other tools. The Mende are generally known as growers of rice and several other crops, practicing crop rotation to protect soil productivity. Coffee, cocoa, and ginger are grown as cash crops, whereas rice, pepper, groundnuts, beniseed (also known as sesame seeds), and palm oil are grown for local consumption. Rice cooperatives have been formed in some rural areas. Traditionally, Mende farming has been carried out by labour groups organised on a local basis and moving from farm to farm (NIIP, 1973). Work is divided by gender: men attend to the heavy work of clearing the land for planting rice, while women clean and pound rice, fish, and weed the planted crops. This routine is followed during ten months of every year, with a couple of months left around the New Year, when they can spend more time in the village engaging in domestic pursuits like house building. The Mende are patrilineal, patrilocal, and polygamous. The household unit is represented by at least one man and perhaps several of his brothers, with all of their wives and children. One or more brothers and married sisters usually leave sooner or later and are incorporated into other residential units. The senior male has moral authority‚Äîthe right to respect and obedience‚Äîover the family as a whole, especially with regard to the negotiation of debts, damages, and bride-wealth. Secret societies Poro society Boys returning from their initiation in the Poro, 1936. Photo by Sjoerd Hofstra The greatest sins a Mende man can commit is to give away the secrets of their tribe. The Poro society is the male equivalent to the female Sande society. When inducted into this society, Mende boys are initiated into manhood. Many of their rituals parallel those of the Sande society. During their training, the initiates learn everything that is essential for the survival of the community. The process is described as being reborn, transformed, and‚Äîduring a masquerade‚Äîas being \\"regurgitated\\" into fully socialized adult men. The Poro prepares men for leadership in the community, so they might attain wisdom, accept responsibility, and gain power. It begins with the child's grade of discovery, followed by extensive training and service. During the seven-year initiation period, the young men converse with each other using a secret language and passwords, known only to other Poro members. The member always knows and understands what is being said. This is part of the mystery of this secret society. At the beginning, young men aged 20 are called into the society and are trained by the group above them, along with a few elders. There is much work to be done during the initiation process. Dancing the masks is part of this work, but not the most important part. Only through work does the dance of the mask become meaningful. Sande society Mende women with a masked Sande society leader. All Mende women when they reach puberty begin the initiation process into the Sande society. The goals of this secret society are to teach young Mende women the responsibilities of adulthood. The girls are taught to be hardworking and modest in their behavior, especially towards their elders. Sande influences every aspect of a Mende woman's life; it is present before birth and still present after. Sande is the guardian of women; their protector and guide through life. It is Sande that grants a woman with an identity and a personality. The Sande society is concerned with defining what it is to be human and of discovering the ways of promoting love, justice, and harmony. It is a moral philosophy that focuses on the perpetual refinement of the individual. Sande leaders serve as models to women in the community. They exemplify the highest of Mende ideals, and they have the duty of enforcing positive social relationships and of removing any harm that might come to women in their community. \\"This is Sande; women together in their womanhood, in a free exchange of words and actions among sisters. Where ever two or three women are gathered together, there is the spirit of Sande.\\" Sande groups conduct masked performances that embody the Sande guardian spirit, who is associated with water and rivers. Descriptions of the society and its masquerade events have been made by visitors since the seventeenth century.Web page titled \\"HELMET MASK/Ndoli Jowei\\" at the Newberger Museum of Art website, dated June 2, 2005, updated November 19, 2008, retrieved September 11, 2009 Sande hierarchy The Sande society is organized by a hierarchy a number of positions all around. The sowie are the highest-ranking leaders of the group. It is their job to model to the Mende women the most important of Mende social values. It is also their duty to enforce proper social relationships and to remove anything that might be harmful to the women in their community. The sowie have control over certain sacred knowledge that is essential to the development of success and happiness in an individual, and also to the well- being of the community. They are the experts of the Sande women and have access to spirit ancestors and forces of nature. The rank below sowie is ligba. There are two grades within ligba; Ligba Wa (senior) and Ligba Wulo (junior). In any group there is only one Ligba Wa, she is an executive officer in Sande. Before a woman can take a leadership role in artistic activities she must be eligible at least as a Ligba Wulo. An ordinary member is referred to as nyaha. The word indicates that the Sande initiation makes a woman of a child, and every woman into a wife. An initiate in training is called mbogdoni. A non-member is kpowa. As a noun kpowa means \\"an ignoramus, stupid, retarded, a fool\\" as a verb it means \\"to become insane or deranged.  Female culture  Arts Much Mand√© art is in the form of jewelry and carvings. The masks associated with the fraternal and sorority associations of the Marka and the Mend√© are probably the best-known and finely crafted in the region. The Mand√© also produce beautifully woven fabrics which are popular throughout western Africa, and gold and silver necklaces, bracelets, armlets, and earrings. The bells on the necklaces are of the type believed capable of being heard by spirits, ringing in both worlds, that of the ancestors and the living. Mand√© hunters often wear a single bell that can be easily silenced when stealth is necessary. Women, on the other hand, often wear multiple bells, referring to concepts of community, since the bells ring harmoniously together. Mende masks Masks are the collective Mind of Mende community; viewed as one body, they are the Spirit of the Mende people. The Mende masked figures are a reminder that human beings have a dual existence; they live in the concrete world of flesh and material things and the spirit world of dreams, faith, aspirations and imagination. The features of a Mende mask convey Mende ideals of female morality and physical beauty. They are unusual because the masks are worn by women.Mende Mask, Treasures of Derby, Derby.gov.uk (cached), accessed July 2011 The bird on top of the head represents a woman's natural intuition that lets her see and know things that others can't. The high or broad forehead represents good luck or the sharp, contemplative mind of the ideal Mende woman. Downcast eyes symbolize a spiritual nature and it is through these small slits that a woman wearing the mask would look out of. The small mouth signifies the ideal woman's quiet and humble character. The markings on the cheeks are representative of the decorative scars girls receive as they step into womanhood. The scars are a symbol of her new, harder life. The neck rolls are an indication of the health of an ideal woman. They have also been called symbols of the pattern of concentric, circular ripples the Mende spirit makes when emerging from the water. In the Mende culture, full-figured women are beautiful. The intricate hairstyles reveal the close ties within a community of women. The holes at the base of the mask are where the rest of the costume is attached. A woman who wears these masks must not expose any part of her body or a vengeful spirit may take possession of her. Women often cover their bodies with masses of raffia or black cloth. When a girl becomes initiated into the Sande society, the village's master woodcarver creates a special mask just for her. Helmet masks are made from a section of tree trunk, often of the kpole (cotton) tree, and then carved and hollowed to fit over the wearer's head and face. The woodcarver must wait until he has a dream that guides him to make the mask a certain way for the recipient. A mask must be kept hidden in a secret place when no one is wearing it. These masks appear not only in initiation rituals but also at important events such as funerals, arbitrations and the installation of chiefs. Examples of these masks appear in museums. Various Mende masks, specifically Sowei Masks, were the focus of a 2013 exhibition in the British Museum, exploring the Sowei traditions. Dancing Learning dance is a harsh discipline that every Mende girl must tackle. Girls practice for hours at a time until they drop from exhaustion. Ndoli jowei, the expert in dancing, is in charge of teaching young Mende girls to dance. When girls make a mistake in the steps, they are whipped with a switch until they get it right. Often girls are awoken in the middle of the night to practice the dance; sometimes they are forced to stay awake for nearly 48 hours dancing almost the entire time. By the end of their brutal training, the girls have transformed into young woman who are tough and confident even in the harshest of conditions. They are in great physical shape and have endurance and stamina.  The role of Gonde  The traditional character of Gonde is also a Ndoli jowei or dance instructor, but rather than a harsh enforcer, she acts as the comic relief. Gonde becomes a friend to the initiates, amusing them to help them forget the hard ordeals they are going through. She coaches the slower dancers, encouraging them to work hard. \\"Gonde is a funny, lovable character who lightens the gloom and reminds everyone that Sande is not always so deadly serious.\\"  Ndoli jowei  Ndoli jowei is the principal spirit for celebration, although she also appears on other occasions besides celebrations. In Sande initiation, there are three major events in which the ndoli jowei appear publicly. The first occurs 1‚Äì3 days after the initiates have been taken into the bush to be circumcised. This event is known as yaya gbegbi. At this time the ndoli jowei comes into town with a group of Sande women while the initiates stay in the bush recovering from their operations. The women come into town to tell men they have initiated people into Sande. They go through the town waving leaves and gathering food and other supplies that they need. Ndoli jowei does not dance on this occasion because it is not yet time for celebration. She is there only as a reminder of the powerful medicine which has been summoned by the Sande session. This validates the unruly behavior of the Sande women. The next time ndoli jowei appears is at a minor feast called Kpete gbula yombo le or Sowo mba yili gbi. At this occasion, an announcement is made to inform people of the date for the gani celebration; which is the last event of the Sande initiation that ndoli jowei appears at. At this time, the new initiates are brought into town for the first time since the initiation process began; accompanied by ndoli jowei. This is a happy occasion where dances are performed by both the maskers and the initiates.  White clay  Sande society initiates marked with white clay and animal fat, called Hojo or Wojeh. Hojo is a white clay that Mende women use to mark their territory. The clay comes from the water like many other aspects of Sande. Its smooth, shiny surface reflects light, making it eye-catching. Hojo is found in a scale of colors from beige to pure white. The pure white Hojo is rarer, found only deep beneath the surface of the water. Hojo and Sande are parallel in that they are both well hidden and secretive in its purest form. White is the color of Sande. To the Mende, the pureness of white signifies the cleanliness and absence of imperfections. \\"It shows a 'harmlessness'; it is void of all things evil and is thus 'a positive and helpful color. White is symbolic of the spirit world and also of the secret parts of society where people aim for the highest standards. Objects and people who are marked with Hojo are under Sande protection and control. They are subject to the authority of Sande law and punishment. Initiates are colored with this white clay to show that they are the property of Sande. This signifies that they are under the protection of Sande and should not be fooled with. Sowei, the judge of women, wears white to represent clear thinking and justice. Hair A woman's hair is a sign of femininity. Both thickness and length are elements that are admired by the Mende. Thickness means the woman has more individual strands of hair and the length is proof of strength. It takes time, care and patience to grow a beautiful, full head of hair. Ideas about hair root women to nature, the way hair grows is compared to the way forests grow. The vegetation on earth is the \\"hair\\" on the head of Mother Nature in the same way the hair on the head of a woman is her \\"foliage.\\" (Boone) A woman with long, thick hair illustrates a life force, she may be blessed with a green thumb giving her the ability to have a promising farm and many healthy children. Hairstyles are very important in Mende society. A Mende woman's hair must be well groomed, clean, and oiled. Hair must be tied down under strict control and shaped into intricate, elegant styles for the sake of beauty and sex appeal. Dirty, disheveled hair is a sign of insanity. A woman who does not groom and maintain her hair has neglected the community's standards of behavior. Only a woman in mourning can let her hair loose. The Mende find unarranged \\"wild\\" hair immoral and associate individuals who possess this trait with wild behavior.  Female genital mutilation  A key element of Sande initiation is the clitoridectomy, or female genital mutilation. This surgery is supposed to foreshadow the pain a Mende woman experiences during childbirth. The shock of this experience also tests a Mende woman's physical endurance. The shared pain of the clitoridectomy creates permanent bonds among the initiates. Vows that express a social bond are taken after the operation; these vows are a metaphor for the support the women will have during the pains of childbirth. This procedure is considered necessary to change Mende children, who are considered to be of neutral sex before the procedure, to heterosexual, gendered adults. Genital mutilation is thought to remove the female's residue of maleness. Neck rings The neck rings at the base of the mask are an exaggeration of actual neck creases. Mende people consider a beautiful neck to be one with rings as it shows adolescent girls becoming ready for childbearing by the increase in body fat. The rings indicate prosperity and wholesome living, and are given by God to show his affection for a fortunate few. The rings also indicate a relationship with the divine: the Sowo itself is a deity from the waters, and the neck rings represent the concentric waves that are formed on still water by Sowo's head breaking through the surface. The spirit comes from the water, and what the human eye sees on the necks of women \\"is human in form, but divine in essence\\", as portrayed in the mask. Mende syllabary The Mende syllabary was invented in 1921 by Kisimi Kamara (c. 1890‚Äì1962) of Sierra Leone. Seeing how the British managed to take over his country, Kisimi concluded that their power was partly a result of their literacy. He decided to give his own people that ability. Kisimi claimed he was inspired in a dream to create the Mende syllabary, which he called Ki-ka-ku. During the 1920s and 1930s, he ran a school in southern Sierra Leone to teach Ki-ka-ku. The syllabary became a popular method of keeping records and writing letters. During the 1940s, the British set up the Protectorate Literacy Bureau in Sierra Leone's second largest city of Bo. Its goal was to teach the Mende people to read and write with a version of the Latin alphabet. As a result, usage of Kisimi's syllabary gradually diminished and, until recently scholars thought that the script was all but forgotten. But American historian Konrad Tuchscherer made some striking discoveries regarding Ki-ka-ku in the 1990s while researching his Ph.D. thesis for the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. This was the period of Sierra Leone's civil war, and to Tuchscherer's surprise, he found that instead of impeding his research, the war actually advanced it. Thousands of Mendes were taking shelter in huge refugee camps surrounding the cities of Bo and Kenema, and the people living in those camps were organized according to their home chiefdoms, making it possible for Tuchscherer to survey the entire Mende region (about half of Sierra Leone's territory) in a small space and a short period of time. And he found that the Mende syllabary, far from being forgotten, was still being used by quite a few people, mostly elderly men. But Tuchscherer made another important discovery a few years earlier before the war broke out when he visited the town of Potoru in Pujehun District, where Kisimi Kamara came from. Tuchscherer learned that while Kisimi took the lead in spreading the script (which he calls \\"kikakui\\") throughout the Mende region, the actual inventor of the Ki-ka-ku script was a local tailor who developed it in order to keep an accurate record of his customers' names and measurements. Politics It is well known in Sierra Leone that the Mendes, along with the Krios and Sherbros, are educationists. They are considered to favor learning than doing business. To them, education comes first. They are also known to command respect and possess leadership qualities. The politics of Sierra Leone have traditionally been dominated by the Mende. The Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), which is one of the two major political party in the country, is predominantly based among the Mende people. The SLPP gets most of its support in Mende- predominate south-east region of Sierra Leone. Most of the country's top government positions have been held by the Mende. Sierra Leone's first Prime minister Sir Milton Margai, who led the country to independence from the United Kingdom on April 27, 1961 was a prominent member of the Mende ethnic group. Other prominent Sierra Leonean politicians from the Mende ethnic group include the country's second prime minister Sir Albert Margai, who was also the younger brother of Milton Margai; former commander of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces and former Sierra Leone's head of state Brigadier David Lansana; former Head of State of Sierra Leone Brigadier General Julius Maada Bio; former Sierra Leone's vice president Albert Joe Demby; former Sierra Leone's vice president and attorney general Solomon Berewa. Former Sierra Leone's vice president minister of Justice and Attorney General Francis Minah; former Sierra Leone's attorney general and one of the founding members of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) Banja Tejan-Sie. Samuel Hinga Norman, who was Sierra Leone's minister of Defense and former leader of the militant group the Civil Defense Forces (commonly known as the Kamajors). Sierra Leonean politician Charles Margai, who is the leader of one of the country's main opposition party the People's Movement for Democratic Change (PMDC). He is also the son of former prime minister Albert Margai and the nephew of Milton Margai; and former Sierra Leone's minister of finance John Oponjo Benjamin, who is currently the National Leader of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP).  Women's political influence in Mende society  The Mende are a well-documented example of a non-western, pre-industrial society in which, at least historically, women took more political leadership positions relative to men. In the pre-colonial era, the Mende had female chiefs and war leaders. One such female chief, Madam Yoko (1849‚Äì1906), was the leader of the vast Kpa Mende Confederacy. She was formally recognized by the British as a Paramount Chief in 1894, ruling an area that was eventually divided into fourteen chiefdoms. Although it is impossible to know the extent to which other Mende women rose to leadership positions comparable to Madam Yoko's, historians believe that perhaps fifteen to twenty percent of the local leaders with whom the British negotiated at the time of colonial consolidation were women. The pattern continues to this day. According to MacCormack, \\"Contemporary women paramount chiefs are equally prominent, and their political influence now extends into national and international arenas. In 1988, thirteen of the 146 paramount chiefs were female.\\" MacCormack further notes, \\"There is a tendency in Western culture to define women as weak and needing protection, since they bear children.

It is the largest of three islands known as the New Year Group, and the second-largest island in Bass Strait (after Flinders Island). The island's population at the was 1,585 people, up from 1,566 in 2011. The local government area of the island is the King Island Council. The island forms part of the official land divide between the Great Australian Bight and Bass Strait, off the north-western tip of Tasmania and about halfway to the mainland state of Victoria. The southernmost point is Stokes Point and the northernmost point is Cape Wickham. There are three small islands immediately offshore: New Year Island and Christmas Island situated to the northwest, and a smaller island Councillor Island to the east, opposite Sea Elephant Beach. King Island was first visited by Europeans in the late 18th century. It was named after Philip Gidley King, Colonial Governor of New South Wales, whose territory at the time included what is now Tasmania. Sealers established temporary settlements on the island in the early 19th century, but it was not until the 1880s that permanent settlements were established. The largest of these is Currie, situated on the island's west coast. Today, the island's economy is largely based on agriculture and tourism. It is also home to the Huxley Hill Wind Farm.  History  King Island was originally part of a land bridge linking Tasmania with the Australian mainland, which was submerged around 12,000 years ago due to rising sea levels. A human skeleton was discovered in a cave on the island in 1989, which was dated to approximately 14,000 years ago. However, previous examinations had revealed no \\"shell heaps, bones, charcoal or other remains which might indicate Aboriginal occupation\\", suggesting that the area was passed through by the ancestors of Aboriginal Tasmanians but not permanently inhabited. It was uninhabited at the time of European discovery. Captain Reed is the first known European to discover King Island in 1799 while hunting seals in the schooner Martha. Matthew Flinders‚Äô first map of \\"Van Dieman's Land\\" and \\"Basses Strait\\",This map is held at the National Library of Australia, Canberra which was sent to England (before Flinders had left) and was published in June 1800, did not show King Island. However, before Flinders left Sydney for England in 1800, Captain Black had informed Flinders of the existence of the island. Flinders' second map of Van Diemen's Land and Bass's Strait (properly finished en route to England) and published with his ObservationsObservations on the coast of Van Diemen's Land, on Bass's Strait and its Islands, and on Parts of the coast of New South Wales-By Matthew Flinders 1801 in 1801 shows:common map dated 1798‚Äì99 and showing \\"land seen\\" > \\"Land of considerable extent has been seen about this situation\\". Built in 1861, the Cape Wickham Lighthouse is Australia's, and the Southern Hemisphere's, tallest lighthouse.Although the impressive granite tower, Australia's tallest lighthouse,Ashworth, Susie; Bain, Carolyn; Smitz, Paul. Lonely Planet Australia. Lonely Planet, 2004. , p. 653 was finished and the light first lit on 1 November 1861, the Cape Wickham Lighthouse was only officially opened in November 2011 at a community celebration of the light's 150th anniversary. Captain John Black also visited the island just after Reed and named it King's Island after Governor Philip Gidley King. Captain John Black was sailing in the brig Harbinger, after which the dangerous Harbinger Rocks off the island's north-west coast are named. It was found to abound in both fur seals and Southern elephant seals that were soon exploited to local extinction. Governor King, knowing that the French navigator Nicolas Baudin was going to head for the island, when he left Port Jackson in 1800, sent the Cumberland from Sydney to formally claim the islands for Britain. The Cumberland arrived just before the French and the British had hastily erected the British Flag in a tree.The Journal of Post Captain Nicolas Baudin‚ÄîLibraries Board of South Australia 1974 Baudin still circumnavigated and extensively mapped the Island in 1802, giving French names to some localities which are still in use today like \\"Phoques Bay\\" on the north-west coast. As a result of this incident, British settlements were established at the River Derwent and Port Dalrymple in Tasmania and later Port Phillip. Sealers continued to harvest the island intermittently until the mid-1820s, after which the only inhabitants were some old sealers and their Australian Aboriginal wives who mostly hunted wallaby for skins. The last of these left the island in 1854 and for many years it was only occasionally visited by hunters and more often castaways from shipwrecks. The first submarine communications cable across Bass Strait in 1859 went via King Island, starting at Cape Otway, Victoria. It made contact with the Tasmanian mainland at Stanley Head, and then continued on to George Town. However it started failing within a few weeks of completion, and by 1861 it failed completely. A later telephone and telegraph cable across Bass Strait operated via King Island from 1936 until 1963. In the 1880s the land was opened for grazing. A township developed at Currie and the post office opened on 1 June 1892 (known as King's Island until 1903, King Island until 1917, thereafter Currie). Currie, on the west coast, now has the only post office on the island, but in the past Grassy, in the southeast (1918‚Äì35, 1943‚Äì91), Naracoopa on the east coast (1920‚Äì62), Pearshape to the south (1946‚Äì59) and Egg Lagoon in the north (1925‚Äì67) replacing Yambacoona (1922‚Äì25) all had official post offices. The other localities of King Island are Bungaree, Loorana, Lymwood, Nugara, Pegarah, Reekara, Sea Elephant, Surprise Bay, Wickham and Yarra Creek. All share the postcode 7256.  Shipwrecks  Cataraqui, Australia's deadliest maritime disaster with 400 victims. 314 recovered bodies lie buried on King Island in five graves. Situated in the centre of the western entrance to Bass Strait, King Island has been the location of over 60 known shipwrecks, involving the loss of over 2,000 lives. Many King Islanders are descendants of shipwreck survivors.Baglin, Douglass; Mullins, Barbara. Islands of Australia.

The island today  Currie Harbour, 2007  Currie  Currie, the largest town and administrative centre, is situated on the west coast of the island.  Grassy  The township of Grassy, on the island's east coast, is approximately 32 km south east of Currie. It was a thriving mining town where scheelite was extracted from an open cut mine until 1974 when two underground mines were brought into production. After the mine closed in 1990, the mine site was rehabilitated, the town sold and the pit was allowed to flood. geology of King Island In recent years the Grassy population has increased again and consists of local families, sea-changers, a campus of Ballarat Clarendon College and holiday makers. There is a service station, a supermarket and several shops and restaurants. Grassy is also known for the Little Penguin rookery near the port (safe harbour) and Platypus at the Upper Grassy Dam. There are ferries servicing the island with a weekly shipping services between Victoria, Northern Tasmania and Grassy Harbour.  Naracoopa  The village of Naracoopa is situated on the east coast about from Currie and is known for its beach, jetty (fishing), holiday accommodation and eateries. There is a sheltered BBQ area and public toilets on the foreshore. Naracoopa was the chief bulk fuels port and depot and is the site of a mineral sands deposit from which rutile, zircon and ilmenite were extracted between 1968 and 1977. The attractions of Naracoopa are the Naracoopa Jetty, blow hole and calmer weather.  Economy and culture  The island is noted for its production of cheese, lobsters, bottled rain water, kelp, and beef. The island's beef industry was seriously impacted by the closure of the island's only abattoir, owned by Argentinian company JS Swift, in September 2012. It is a safe harbour for passing yachts and the site of the Huxley Hill Wind Farm operated by Hydro Tasmania. The island has a football competition, The King Island Football Association, with just three teams, Currie, Grassy and North, competes annually in the Stonehaven Cup boat races, the Imperial 20-foot race, Queen's Birthday Weekend Pheasant Season and many other activities. The island was the proposed location for the development of Australia's largest windfarm. This wind farm split the community into those for and against but eventually proved uneconomic to construct. The proposal was shelved in late 2014. The Dolphin mine, located on the southeast side of the island, is one of the largest tungsten reserves in Australia.  Environment   Birds  King Island Emu The King Island emu was endemic to the island. Although numerous bones have been found, the only existing skin was collected by Nicolas Baudin in 1802, shortly before the species became extinct, probably as a result of hunting by sealers for food.BirdLife International. (2011). Species factsheet: Dromaius ater. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2011-07-16. Some 193 km2 of the island, consisting of the coastline in a strip extending from the low water mark to one kilometre inland of the high-water mark around the entire island, with a broader area encompassing Lavinia State Reserve in the north-east, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). The main feature making it an IBA is that it supports the small population of critically endangered orange-bellied parrots (Neophema chrysogaster) on the migration route between their breeding grounds in south- western Tasmania and their wintering grounds in mainland south-eastern Australia.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: King Island. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2011-07-16. And more recently the King Island Biodiversity Management Plan 2012‚Äì2022 identified Lake Flannigan as important in this regard. The IBA includes the nearby Christmas, New Year and Councillor Islands which support breeding seabirds and waders. The IBA supports significant numbers of hooded plovers, flame robins and fairy terns, over 1% of the world populations of short-tailed shearwaters, pied and sooty oystercatchers, black-faced cormorants and pacific gulls, as well as populations of ten bird species endemic to Tasmania, including seven subspecies endemic to King Island.  Climate  King Island has a borderline Mediterranean (Csb)/oceanic climate (Cfb) with mild summers and wet winters.

He first appeared in Journey into Mystery #114, cover dated March 1965, created by writer Stan Lee and writer/artist Jack Kirby, and has over the years played a part on several Marvel Comics crossovers such as the original Secret Wars and Fear Itself. Though depicted for many years as a supervillain, Creel has also been portrayed as an anti-hero, siding with characters such as Black Bolt and Alpha Flight. Creel was given the power to take the form of any material that he touched, \\"absorbing\\" the property of the material itself. Over the years the power has worked both for and against him. The Absorbing Man was given his powers by the Asgardian god Loki in a plot to defeat Loki's brother Thor. During the Secret Wars storyline Creel became romantically involved with the supervillain Titania and the two were linked for decades afterward. During the Fear Itself storyline, Creel comes into possession of a divine Asgardian hammer, granting him amplified powers and turning him into Greithoth: Breaker of Wills. Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, the Absorbing Man has featured in over four decades of Marvel continuity and other Marvel-endorsed products such as animated television series, video games, and merchandise such as trading cards. The character has appeared in a live-action adaptation in the Marvel Cinematic Universe TV series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., portrayed by Brian Patrick Wade in the second, third, and fifth seasons. Publication history The Absorbing Man first appears in Journey into Mystery #114 (Mar. 1965) and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography Carl \\"Crusher\\" Creel was a boxer and jailed criminal who becomes the Absorbing Man when he drinks a liquid which the Asgardian god Loki laced with a magic potion. Discovering that he could absorb the properties of anything he touched, Creel escapes prison by absorbing metal from the guards' bullets and goes on to battle Thor. When he escapes, he takes with him the ball and chain to which he was shackled, and uses the ball and chain as a weapon. Although he is only mortal, Creel's fantastic abilities make him a worthy opponent for Thor, who is later forced to end the battle due to Loki's kidnapping of Jane Foster. Creel then breaks into a house and attacks the occupants. Thor comes to the rescue and tricks Creel into changing his atomic structure into pure helium. Thor accomplishes this by using his hammer's powers to transform the ground's molecular makeup. As Creel is acquiring additional mass from direct contact with the Earth when this happens, he ends up drifting harmlessly into the atmosphere.Journey Into Mystery #114‚Äì115 (March‚ÄìApril 1965) A short time later, Loki retrieves Creel from space using Asgardian technology after he has knocked out an Asgardian warlock and sends Creel back to battle Thor. After Creel is nearly beaten due to Thor's fighting skill, Loki transports him to Asgard and reveals the true source of his \\"absorbing\\" powers. After being humbled by Loki, Creel agrees to act as his agent, and he is directed to take over the city. The Absorbing Man defeats the Asgardian legions without too much trouble and eventually confronts Odin himself. Creel absorbs Odin's attacks and then the properties of Asgard itself, hoping to rule the universe, and he towers over Odin as Loki arrives to gloat. Thor is ordered by Odin not to keep attacking. Loki and Creel are then beaten by trickery; once given Odin's Rod of Rulership the two quarrel over it, with the Absorbing Man trying to absorb the rod, and the two find that they cannot let go. Odin then advises them that his power lies not in a mere object, but deep within himself. The pair are then banished into outer space.Journey Into Mystery #121‚Äì123 (October‚ÄìDecember 1965) The Absorbing Man eventually returns on a comet and battles the Hulk. Bruce Banner had been sent to divert the comet, as it was feared it was radioactive, but the Absorbing Man leaped aboard and began absorbing the Hulk's strength. He tries to bury the Hulk under a mountain, but when the Hulk turns back to human form, the Absorbing Man is unable to support the great weight and was buried.Hulk #125 However, Creel goes on to battle many other heroes, such as the Avengers,Avengers #183‚Äì184 (May‚ÄìJune 1979) Daredevil,Daredevil #360 (January 1997) the Dazzler,Dazzler #18 (August 1982) the Hulk,Hulk #208‚Äì209 (February‚ÄìMarch 1977), #347‚Äì348 (September‚ÄìOctober 1988) and #457 (October 1997), and Hulk Annual #18 (1992) and Spider-Man.Marvel Knights: Spider-Man #13‚Äì18 (June‚ÄìNovember 2005) He is one of the villains who participates in the Secret Wars, and also develops a romantic relationship with the super-strong villainess Titania.Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars #1‚Äì12 (May 1984‚ÄìApril 1985) The pair also join the reformed fourth version of the Masters of Evil.Avengers #270, 273, 275 (August, November 1986, January 1987) Creel has several more battles with ThorThor #375‚Äì376 (January‚ÄìFebruary 1987); Thor (vol. 2) #14 (August 1999) (and the Eric Masterson Thor)Thor #446 (April 1992) and a skirmish with the cosmic hero Quasar.Quasar #5 (December 1989) Although he assisted Crossbones in a plan to attack Captain America, when Absorbing Man learned that Crossbones intended to detonate a bomb in New York, he absorbed the properties of Captain America's shield to contain the blast, declaring that he was not a murderer.Captain America (vol. 3) #24 Creel is later incarcerated in New York's experimental \\"Ant-Hill\\" prison called the Big House, where all prisoners are reduced in size via Hank Pym's \\"Pym Particles\\". An escape attempt is thwarted by She-Hulk.She-Hulk #10 (February 2005) The Absorbing Man escapes prison and allies with the Owl as an enforcer,Marvel Knights Spider-Man #13 but finds himself opposed by Spider-Man and new hero Ethan Edwards (later revealed to be a disguised Skrull). He is briefly trapped and converted into a new form of cocaine by one of the Owl's operatives when they become frustrated with his unprofessional approach,Marvel Knights Spider- Man #16 with the new drug briefly giving those who snort him a degree of his powers, but he eventually manages to reassemble himself in a sewer and goes after the Owl for revenge.Marvel Knights Spider-Man #17 Spider-Man manages to defeat Creel by tricking him into running a gauntlet where he absorbs multiple objects thrown at him, culminating in Creel absorbing two different chemicals that cause him to explode.Marvel Knights Spider-Man #18 The Absorbing Man later battles and is apparently killed by the hero Sentry during the events of Civil War.Civil War: The Return #1 (January 2007) However, he later appears at the funeral of the villain Stilt-Man.Punisher War Journal (vol. 2) #4 (April 2007) Creel and Titania later come into conflict with the heroine She-Hulk and her Skrull partner Jazinda after they attempt to arrest Creel's cousin Rockwell \\"Hi-Lite\\" Davis.She-Hulk (vol. 2) #22‚Äì23 (November‚ÄìDecember 2007) During the Dark Reign storyline, Creel joins a new version of the Lethal Legion led by the Grim Reaper.Lethal Legion #1‚Äì3 (August‚ÄìOctober 2009) After a defeat, Creel escapes prison and absorbs a shard of the Cosmic Cube.Mighty Avengers #32 (December 2009) The Absorbing Man suffers a setback when villain Norman Osborn uses an enchanted sword‚Äîprovided by Loki‚Äîto remove his absorbing powers completely.Mighty Avengers #33 (January 2010) Creel is also revealed to be the father of the hero Stonewall.Secret Warriors #12 (January 2010) Creel regains his powers and storms Avengers Tower to recover his ball and chain. He is defeated by Avengers' coordinators Maria Hill, Sharon Carter, and Victoria Hand after absorbing the latter's cold.Age of Heroes #3 During the \\"Fear Itself\\" storyline, Creel and Titania encounter two of the divine hammers that contain the essences of the Worthy, generals to Odin's brother and adversary, Cul Borson. Coming into contact with the hammers, Titania and Creel were transformed into Skirn: Breaker of Men and Greithoth: Breaker of Wills, respectively. They later went on a rampage depicted in a number of Fear Itself tie-in issues, most prominently Avengers Academy #15‚Äì19 and Iron Man 2.0 #5‚Äì6, as well as that storyline's core miniseries. During the \\"AXIS\\" storyline, Absorbing Man appears as a member of Magneto's unnamed supervillain group during the fight against Red Skull's Red Onslaught form.Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #2 He is briefly converted to heroism when everyone on the island experiences a moral inversion as Doctor Doom and Scarlet Witch attempt to bring out the Charles Xavier in Red Skull, joining the new Astonishing Avengers assembled by Steve Rogers and Spider-Man to oppose the inverted heroes. Absorbing Man later reverts to villainy when the inversion is undone.Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #9 When Absorbing Man and Titania were robbing an armored car, the female Thor appeared to thwart their plans. Upon meeting the female Thor, Creel mocked her for being a woman and for having taken Thor's name for herself, which she answered by breaking his jaw. Titania then appeared to confront her but, in respect for what she was doing, she knocked out her husband with his own weapon and surrendered.Thor (vol. 4) #5 During the \\"Secret Wars\\" storyline of 2015, Absorbing Man is among the villains attending Kingpin's viewing party of the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.Secret Wars #1 (2015) During the \\"Avengers: Standoff!\\" storyline, Absorbing Man was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. Using Kobik, S.H.I.E.L.D. transformed Absorbing Man into a man named Harold.Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha #1 During his time as Harold, Absorbing Man ran an ice cream parlor and was in love with Sheriff Eva. When Helmut Zemo and Fixer restored the memories of the inmates, Absorbing Man joined in on their uprising with Whirlwind. Illuminati members Hood and Titania arrived at Pleasant Hill to retrieve Absorbing Man. Although he was shaken from having a S.H.I.E.L.D.-induced normal life, Absorbing Man sides with the Illuminati as they work to assemble the other inmates to get revenge on S.H.I.E.L.D.Illuminati #6 During the \\"Opening Salvo\\" part of the \\"Secret Empire\\" storyline, Absorbing Man is recruited by Baron Helmut Zemo to join the Army of Evil.Captain America: Steve Rogers #16 At some point, Absorbing Man was imprisoned in a deep space torture prison. He was defeated by Black Bolt in combat.Black Bolt #1. Marvel Comics. Absorbing Man later made an acquaintance with Black Bolt and fellow inmates Blinky, Metal Master, and Raava.Black Bolt #2. Marvel Comics. Upon taking in Black Bolt's sonic scream, Absorbing Man seemingly sacrifices himself to help destroy the torture prison's Jailer, enabling Black Bolt and the other inmates to escape.Black Bolt #6. Marvel Comics. At the time when Jailer has possessed Blinky's mind in order to kill Black Bolt, Lockjaw took Titania to Parkwood Cemetery where Absorbing Man suddenly emerged from his grave.Black Bolt #11. Marvel Comics. Absorbing Man and Titania helped Black Bolt fight a Jailer-possessed Blinky until they managed to drive Jailer out of him.Black Bolt #12. Marvel Comics. After Absorbing Man was imprisoned for another crime, his lawyer convinced him to join the U.S. Hulk Operations as an alternative to getting incarcerated for life. He gets injected with a Bannerman Gene-Enhancement Package that turned him into a gamma mutate able to absorb gamma radiation, at the cost of turning his skin a bright red color. When Absorbing Man - under the alias of Red Dog - fought Hulk at Los Diablos Missile Base, an entity, the One Below All entered his body after he absorbed most of the Hulk's gamma energy. The One Below All taunted Red Dog's astral body before ripping his physical one in half.Immortal Hulk #9. Marvel Comics. Absorbing Man, still controlled by The One Below All, continues fighting Hulk. Absorbing Man ran off when Jackie McGee, Walter Langkowski, and Puck showed up. When the One Below All successfully opened the door to the Below Place, the lowest point of Hell, the entirety of New Mexico gets transported there as Absorbing Man weeps.Immortal Hulk #10. Marvel Comics. With the help of Puck, Creel was able to transfer the gamma energy he had absorbed back into Hulk, who used his thunder clap to disperse the One Below All's cloud form and transport New Mexico back to Earth. Creel has since been free of the One Below All's influence, having transferred the gamma radiation back to the Hulk. Powers and abilities Courtesy of a magical potion, Crusher Creel has the ability to duplicate the properties of anything that he touches‚Äîgases, liquids, solids, or even energy sources. This transformation also extends to the clothing and ball and chain that Creel was wearing when the potion took effect (for example, if Creel touches the metal titanium, his body, clothing, and ball and chain take on the appearance and properties of titanium). If the object is large (e.g., a building), Creel can absorb sufficient mass to attain the same height. Creel also retains his intellect and capacity for speech and full physical movement (although his first attempt at absorbing water temporarily cost Creel his sanity when he tried to keep himself from drifting apart in the ocean) and can reform if his body is damaged in any way while in altered form, which he discovered when Wolverine cut his arm off during the Secret Wars while he was in stone form and he held it in place as he deactivated his powers.Secret Wars #7 November 1984 Creel's overall power increases in direct proportion to the strength of the material absorbed. There seems to be almost no limit to what Creel can absorb, as he has absorbed the properties of bronze;Journey into Mystery #114 (April 1965) Odin's Cosmic Bolt and later cyclonic storm;Journey Into Mystery #123 (Dec. 1965) diamond;Daredevil #360 (July 1997) glass;Journey Into Mystery #121 (Oct. 1965) light; rock, silk, soil;Journey Into Mystery #115 (April 1965) spikes;Journey Into Mystery #122 (Nov. 1965) steel;Journey Into Mystery #114 (March 1965) Thor's uru hammer Mjolnir;Thor #376 (Feb. 1987) water;Avengers #184 (July 1979) and even the properties of Asgard itself, although absorbing the Sentry's power proved too much for Creel, causing him to become overloaded with energy and nearly killing him. Creel is now also capable of combining previously absorbed abilities.She-Hulk (vol. 2) #23 (Dec. 2007) Other versions Age of Apocalypse In the Age of Apocalypse reality, Absorbing Man (alongside Diablo) works as a prison camp warden in Mexico.Tales from the Age of Apocalypse #1 December 1996 Earth X In the limited series Earth X, set in the alternate universe Earth-9997, Creel is also capable of absorbing knowledge which he did upon absorbing Ultron's knowledge and was eventually able to remember everything previously absorbed and to display any of these properties at will.Earth X #0-12 (March 1999 - April 2000) House of M In the House of M reality, Absorbing Man is seen as a member of the Hood's Masters of Evil.House of M: Masters of Evil #1 Marvel Zombies In the Marvel Zombies reality, Creel, as a zombie, works for the zombie Kingpin.

Life and career Born in Newry, Ireland, Walkem moved to then Colony of British Columbia in 1862 and served as a member of the Colonial Assembly from 1864 to 1866 and the appointed Legislative Council from 1866 to 1870. He was a supporter of Canadian confederation. With the admission of the colony into Canada, Walkem was elected to the provincial legislature from the riding of Cariboo in 1871 and became Attorney General in the cabinet of Premier Amor De Cosmos and succeeded him to become the third Premier of British Columbia. Walkem's government pressured Ottawa to meet its commitment to build a railway to the Pacific Ocean but was initially unsuccessful. Walkem fought the 1875 election facing charges that he had failed to secure railway construction and had increased the province's debts by engaging in expensive public works projects. Walkem's government was re-elected with a reduced majority but he was also accused of plunging the province into debt by engaging in public works that it could ill afford (see Lillooet Cattle Trail). Nevertheless, his government was returned, albeit with a reduced majority but grievances continued. The Walkem government's financial difficulties mounted and his government lost a Motion of No Confidence in early 1876 and was replaced by a new government formed by Andrew Charles Elliott with Walkem becoming Leader of the Opposition. Elliot's government was unstable and collapsed within two years leading to early elections which allowed Walkem to form a second government in 1878 as the fifth Premier, with a comfortable majority. The new Walkem government opposed \\"cheap Chinese labour\\" and inserted a clause banning the hiring of Chinese workers in all its contracts. The government also attempted to levy a special tax restricted to Chinese which was struck down by the Supreme Court of Canada. In the election campaign Walkem had threatened to lead British Columbia out of confederation if the federal government did not commence construction of the promised railway by 1879. The provincial government appealed directly to London resulting in the British government pressuring Ottawa to fulfill the deal. In 1882 Walkem narrowly survived a Motion of No Confidence due to rising costs of a project to build a dock on Vancouver Island but lost the subsequent election due to hostility from Islanders who had a disproportionate number of seats in the legislature and thus were able to bring down the Walkem government. Walkem retired from politics in 1882 he was appointed to the Supreme Court of British Columbia sitting on the court until his retirement in 1904. George Anthony Walkem is interred in the Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria, British Columbia.

The components are, from left to right, the solid propellant, the booster, the bullet, and a plastic cap that serves to keep the bullet centered in the propellant block. Caseless ammunition is a type of small arms ammunition that eliminates the cartridge case that typically holds the primer, propellant, and projectile together as a unit. Caseless ammunition is an attempt to reduce the weight and cost of ammunition by dispensing with the case, which is typically precision made of brass or steel, as well as to simplify the operation of repeating firearms by eliminating the need to extract and eject the empty case after firing. Its acceptance has been hampered by problems with production expenses, heat sensitivity, sealing, and fragility. Its use to date has been mainly limited to prototypes and low- powered firearms, with some exceptions. History Volcanic .41 cartridge An early predecessor to modern caseless ammunition, Walter Hunt's Rocket Ball cartridge, was developed in 1850s and guns using them were sold during that time, primarily by Volcanic Repeating Arms. These cartridges were severely under-powered and never saw wide acceptance for self-protection, hunting, or military use. During World War II, Germany began an intensive program to research and develop a practical caseless ammunition for military use, which was driven by the rising scarcity of metals, especially copper used to make cartridge cases. The Germans had some success, but not sufficient to produce a caseless cartridge system during the war. Japan successfully developed the Ho-301 40mm autocannon during the war for mounting on aircraft. It saw action, though relatively limited, use in the defense of the Japanese home islands during the waning months of the war. Modern caseless ammunition Comparison of .223 Remington (left; equivalent to 5.56 mm NATO) and caseless 4.73√ó33mm G11 ammunition (right). Modern caseless ammunition consists of a solid mass of propellant (originally nitrocellulose) cast to form the body of the cartridge. Cavities exist in the body to accept the bullet and a primer (both of which are glued into place). The completed cartridge might also contain a booster charge of powdered propellant to help ignite the body and provide initial thrust to the bullet. Many caseless cartridges are also telescoped, with the bulk of the bullet held within the body of the cartridge, to cut down on cartridge length. A shorter cartridge cuts down on the distance the firearm's action must reciprocate to load a new round, which allows for higher cyclic rates and greater probability of multiple hits on a target at long range. Lack of a case also reduces the weight of the cartridge substantially, especially in small bore rifles. For example, the caseless ammunition designed by Austrian inventor Hubert Usel (1926‚Äì2010) for the Voere VEC-91 weighs about one third as much as regular ammunition for the same caliber. Issues and practical considerations While it seems a simple operation to replace the case with a piece of solid propellant, the cartridge case provides more than just a way to keep the cartridge components together, and these other functions must be replaced if the case is to be replaced. Caseless ammunition is not without its drawbacks, and it is these drawbacks that have kept modern caseless ammunition from achieving wider success. Heat sensitivity The first major problem, of special concern in military applications, which often involve sustained firing, is the heat sensitivity of the ammunition. Nitrocellulose, the primary component of modern gunpowder, ignites at a relatively low temperature of around 170 ¬∞C (338 ¬∞F). One of the functions of the metallic cartridge case is as a heat sink; when extracted after firing, every metallic case carries away a significant amount of the heat from the combustion of the propellant, slowing the rate at which heat builds up in the chamber. The thermal insulation provided by the case also works the other way around, shielding the propellant from built-up heat in the chamber walls. Without a case to provide these functions, caseless rounds using nitrocellulose will begin to cook off, firing from the residual chamber heat, much sooner than cased cartridges do. Cooking off can be avoided by designing the weapon to fire from an open bolt, but this greatly impacts accuracy, and thus is only suitable for machine guns and submachine guns. The normal solution to the problem of heat is to increase the heat resistance by switching to a propellant with a higher ignition temperature, typically a non- crystalline explosive carefully formulated to provide an appropriate rate of combustion. Heckler & Koch, in concert with Dynamit Nobel, managed such a task by producing relatively heat-resistant caseless ammunition. Sealing Another important function provided by the cartridge is to seal the rear of the chamber. During firing of a cased cartridge, the pressure in the chamber expands the metallic case which obturates to the chamber. This prevents gas exiting from the rear of the chamber, and it has also been experimentally shown to provide a significant amount of support to the bolt. Without the case to provide this seal, the firearm design must account for this and provide a means of sealing the rear of the chamber. This problem was also encountered with the Dreyse needle gun; the French Chassepot solved the leaking-breech problem with the addition of a rubber seal to the bolt.See main article, Chassepot, for references Telescoping caseless rounds must also deal with the issue of blocking the bore, as the bullet is surrounded by propellant. The booster charge is used to address this issue, providing an initial burst of pressure to force the bullet out of the cartridge body and into the barrel before the body combusts. Fragility Caseless rounds are limited by the fact that the cartridge body is primarily a propellant, and structural properties are secondary to the combustion properties. The primary issue is one of extraction. While caseless ammunition eliminates the need to extract a fired case, unfired caseless rounds must be extractable to unload the firearm or to clear a misfire. With metallic cases, this ability is provided by a rim or extractor groove machined into the rear of the case. Even in completely plastic bodied cartridges, such as the Activ brand shotgun shells, a thin metal ring is molded into the rim to provide support for the extractor. A secondary issue is that ammunition in use can be exposed to air, water, lubricants, and solvents. Primer and propellant in caseless rounds is unprotected, while cartridge cases provide a high degree of protection. Modern caseless firearms One of the first caseless firearm and ammunition systems produced was made by Daisy, the airgun maker, in 1968. The Daisy V/L Rifle used a .22 caliber (5.5 mm) low-powered caseless round with no primer. The rifle was basically a spring-piston air rifle, but when used with the V/L ammunition the energy from the compression of the piston heated the air behind the caseless cartridge enough to ignite the propellant, and this generated the bulk of the energy of firing. The Daisy V/L Rifle system was discontinued in 1969 after the ATF ruled that it was not an airgun, but a firearm, which Daisy was not licensed to produce. Some assault rifles have used caseless ammunition. One of the better-known weapons of this type is the G11 made by Heckler & Koch as a potential replacement for the G3 battle rifle. Although the G11 never entered full production, it went through a number of prototype stages as well as field testing, including testing as part of the American Advanced Combat Rifle program. While it was scheduled to be adopted by the West German military with a plan set out to procure 300,000 G11K2 rifles over a period from 1990 to 2002, the expenses created by the reunification of Germany and the impossibility of modifying the G11 to use NATO-standard ammunition led to the cancellation of the G11 project and the adoption of a cheaper, more conventional NATO-standardised assault rifle, the 5.56mm G36. The G11's caseless ammunition was later used as the basis for the caseless round development in the US Lightweight Small Arms Technologies program. The first commercial caseless rifle featuring electronic firing was the Voere VEC-91. Several Russian grenade launchers use caseless ammunition including the GP-25 under-barrel grenade launcher and the AGS‚Äë40 Balkan automatic grenade launcher.

There can be a maximum of two assists per goal. The assists will be awarded in the order of play, with the last player to pass the puck to the goal scorer getting the primary assist and the player who passed it to the primary assister getting the secondary assist.Brace, p. 22 Players who gain an assist will get one point added to their player statistics. Despite the use of the terms \\"primary assist\\" and \\"secondary assist\\", neither is worth more than the other, and neither is worth more or less than a goal. Assists and goals are added together on a player's scoresheet to display that player's total points. Special cases If a player scores off a rebound given up by a goaltender, assists are still awarded, as long as there is no re-possession by that goaltender i.e. they did not gain complete control of the puck. However, a rule says that only one point can be credited to any one player on a goal scored. This means one player cannot be credited with a goal and an assist for the same goal scored; instead the player would only get credit for a goal and a different player may get credit for an assist, if applicable. It also means that one player cannot be credited with two assists for the same goal scored; instead the player would only get credit for one assist and a different player may get credit for the other assist, if applicable. Additionally, if a player passes the puck to another player who then completes a give-and-go with a different player for a goal, the player who made the pass that set up the goal gets the primary assist, and the player who passed to the eventual goal scorer before the give-and-go took place gets the secondary assist. This is essentially because assists are to be awarded to the last (up to) two players of the scoring team who had possession of the puck before the eventual goal scorer had possession and ultimately scored, regardless of whether that eventual goal scorer had possession at any time in between the two other players. This also means that possession of the puck can go from and in between the eventual goal scorer and eventual assist getters an unlimited number of times, and this scoring standard will still be applied. The no change in team possession guideline still applies to these particular cases.

In the late 17th century, he and two of his sons emigrated from Waingroves, Derbyshire to Pennsylvania. The second son, also named John Rhoads, married Hannah Willcox in 1692. Samuel was born in Philadelphia in 1711, their fifth child. He first worked as a carpenter and builder before becoming a merchant. Career Rhoads's political career began in 1741, when he was elected to the Common Council of Philadelphia. He designed the east wing of the Pennsylvania Hospital. He also designed the west wing and an additional outdoor structure that weren't built until after his death, in 1794. Rhoads also served on the Board of Managers of the hospital. In 1761 he was elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly, where he served two terms. Rhoads shared the revolutionary sentiment spreading through the city in the 1770s and was a delegate to the First Continental Congress. He was elected Mayor of Philadelphia in 1774. An associate and friend of Benjamin Franklin, Rhoads played a role in many of the important institutions of colonial Philadelphia. He was an early Director of the Library Company of Philadelphia, a founding Director of the Philadelphia Contributionship, and a Vice-President of the American Philosophical Society.

As the driving force behind Brampton, Ontario radio station CFNY in the 1980s, he became an influential figure in the Canadian music industry by giving many Canadian and international alternative rock artists major Canadian radio exposure. During his stint at CFNY, he was known as \\"The Mars Bar\\". Early career Under the name Dave Mickie, he was the original manager of The Revols, a Stratford, Ontario rock band in the late 1950s whose famous members included, Richard Manuel, who would later become part of The Band; Ken Kalmusky, who played with Ian and Sylvia and Great Speckled Bird; and, John Till who formed, and played guitar in, Janis Joplin's Full Tilt Boogie Band. He later became one of Canada's pioneering rock DJs on radio, joining Chatham's CFCO in 1963. Bored with the station's commercial easy listening music, he reportedly brought in some of his own records one night, breaking format and hosting in an uncharacteristically dynamic style. He was fired the next morning, but was quickly rehired after the station learned that his experiment had increased the station's ratings.History of CFNY-FM He was later hired at CKEY in Toronto where he was called \\"the most controversial thing on Toronto radio.\\"\\"Dave Mickie is back, may go on TV,\\" Toronto Star, September 20, 1963 He parted ways with CKEY after just five months. He became host of Music Hop on CBC Television in 1965, succeeding Alex Trebek. He also started writing a column for the Toronto Star in the same year. He was the subject of a chapter in Marshall McLuhan's book Understanding Media, which lauded his unique hosting style: > That's Patty Baby and that's the girl with the dancing feet and that's > Freddy Cannon there on the David Mickie Show in the night time ooohbah > scuba-doo how are you booboo. Next we'll be Swinging on a Star and > sssshhhwwoooo and sliding on a moonbeam.

The Dave Mickie name and persona were phased out in the mid-to-late 1960s, and as David Marsden, he joined Montreal's CKGM in 1967. Under his own name, his hosting style was much less manic and more relaxed, although still informal and unpredictable. In 1969, he moved to CKGM's sister station, CKGM-FM. Marsden was instrumental in switching the station's format from beautiful music to free form progressive rock. In 1973, Marsden returned to Toronto with his new, completely different on-air persona at CHUM-FM. He left the station in February 1975 to devote more time to his radio commercial production company, but mainly because of the tight playlist CHUM-FM was making their DJs follow. Marsden refused to follow a playlist and left shortly after it was instituted. He eventually returned as an on-air personality at CHIC-FM shortly before it was transformed into CFNY. Creates The Spirit of Radio After CFNY program director Dave Pritchard left the station in 1978 due to conflicts with the station management, Marsden was promoted to program director. The station's mandate had been to present significantly different programming than other radio stations in the Greater Toronto Area. Before Marsden's arrival the station's format had been highly eclectic. Marsden saw the commercial potential of punk and new wave, and widened CFNY's focus even further, creating Canada's first alternative music station. Throughout the 1980s, under the slogan the spirit of radio, CFNY was one of the most influential promoters of new international and Canadian artists most radio stations ignored. In 1985, Marsden also judged some episodes of CBC Television's battle of the bands competition series Rock Wars.Keith Sharp, Music Express: The Rise, Fall & Resurrection of Canada's Music Magazine. Dundurn Press, 2014. . p. 143. In July 1987, Marsden and CFNY general manager Bill Hutton hired Don Berns as the new program director. Initially, Marsden continued as director of operations, and as executive producer of the CASBY Awards, but left CFNY a year later. He joined the CBC and moved to Vancouver to produce the TV show Pilot One. That show won several awards, including a silver medal at the Chicago Film and Video Festival. Following that, Marsden launched another freeform modern rock station, Coast 800, later Coast 1040, in Vancouver. He was later involved in the creation of Iceberg Radio, the first major Canadian Internet radio project, and returned to the terrestrial radio airwaves as host of a freeform rock show on Oshawa, Ontario's The Rock 94.9 in the early 2000s. The Marsden Theatre The David Marsden Radio Program, also known as The Marsden Theatre, aired twice a week on Oshawa, Ontario radio station CKGE-FM (a.k.a. The Rock) from June 2003 to December 2014. Originally, Marsden's show was on Thursday and Friday nights, but it was moved to Saturday and Sunday nights in March 2010. During his time on CKGE, Marsden was the only free form DJ on a commercial radio station in North America. Though it was announced the show would end on December 14, 2014, Marsden's final broadcast aired on December 7. There was on-air promotion of a final set of shows the following week (December 13‚Äì14), but this never transpired, as Marsden announced on his Facebook page, \\"I believed it to be best under the circumstances as they played out during the week that I withdraw and disappear quietly from The Rock.\\" NYTheSpirit.com Most recently, Marsden created the subscription based radio channel NYTheSpirit.com, which launched in September, 2014. The station plays a mixture of music, concentrating heavily on the 1980s alternative scene, but with a freeform mentality that mimics Marsden's 1980s heyday at CFNY. After leaving The Rock, Marsden began doing occasional live hosting gigs on NYTheSpirit; the first one aired on Christmas Eve 2014. Beginning in February 2015, The Marsden Theatre became a regular feature on NYTheSpirit; the live show is currently broadcast Saturday and Sunday nights (8PM to midnight, EST). As well, there is an annual 4-hour Christmas Eve special. Legacy Marsden has been profiled in exhibits at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, both for his on-air Dave Mickie persona and for his role as program director of CFNY. He is openly gay,\\"Crashing waves: Hall-of-famer still spinning revolutions\\" , Xtra!, September 18, 2003. and has also worked as a club DJ at gay club nights dubbed \\"The Mars Bar\\".

Background While 6-1-1 was in use to call repair service in some areas from as early as the 1930s, other codes were also used, the most common being 114 (with 113 used for information). A decision to standardize on 6-1-1 (and 4-1-1 for information) nationwide was made in the 1960s, but the use of 114 was still widespread in the 1970s, and into the 1980s in some areas. In some localities, 6-1-1 was used to report problems with landline telephone service. 8-1-1 was used to report problems with cellular telephone service but this has since been discontinued. Current Usage Many landline and mobile phone providers support 6-1-1. Some providers who supply other services, such as Internet or cable television, support these other services with 6-1-1.

According to Russian archivist A. B. Roginsky, Krestinsky was of ethnic Russian origin. Other sources suggest ethnic Ukrainian origins, while according to Felix Chuev, Vyacheslav Molotov maintained that Krestinsky's family had converted from Judaism to Eastern Orthodoxy.Chuev, Felix (ed), Molotov Remembers: Inside Kremlin Politics, 1993, Dee Ivan Inc Rise Nikolay Krestinsky, Soviet Ambassador to Germany (Jul 1923 to Sep 1930). Behind him the Deputy Trade representative Turov. Standing on the right is Voldemar Aussem who later became Plenipotentiary Representative to Austria (May to Dec 1924). Krestinsky and Aussem were repressed during the Great Purge. Krestinsky joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party in 1903 and sided with its Bolshevik faction. After the February Revolution, which overthrew monarchy in Russia, he proved to be a capable organizer and was elected to the Central Committee of the Bolshevik party on 3 August 1917 (Old Style). He was made a member of the first Soviet Orgburo on 16 January 1919 and the first Politburo on 25 March 1919. He was also made a member of the Central Committee's Secretariat on 29 November 1919 and served as Responsible Secretary of the Central Committee for the next year and a half. Fall from power In late 1920 to early 1921, after the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War, Krestinsky supported Leon Trotsky's faction in an increasingly bitter dispute over the direction of the country. After Vladimir Lenin's victory at the tenth party congress in March 1921, Krestinsky lost his Politburo, Orgburo and Secretariat posts and became Soviet ambassador to Germany. The post was an important and sensitive one because of Soviet Russia's crucial and delicate relationship with Germany at the time, but not nearly as important as his previous posts. Krestinsky supported Trotsky and the Left Opposition in 1923‚Äìearly 1927, but distanced himself from Trotsky later in 1927. He completely broke with the opposition in April 1928. Show trial Krestinsky continued working as a diplomat until 1937, when he was arrested during the Great Purge. He was put on trial (as part of the Trial of the Twenty One) on 12 March 1938. While almost all other defendants admitted their guilt during the Moscow Show Trials, Krestinsky at first denied everything, but reversed himself the following day. On 2 March he said to the presiding judge, Vasili Ulrikh: > I do not recognize that I am guilty. I am not a Trotskyite. I was never a > member of the \\"right-winger and Trotskyite bloc\\", which I did not know to > exist. Nor have I committed a single one of the crimes imputed to me, > personally; and in particular I am not guilty of having maintained relations > with the German Secret Service. The following day, he made a total reversal of his position: > Yesterday, under the influence of a momentary keen feeling of false shame, > evoked by the atmosphere of the dock and the painful impression created by > the public reading of the indictment, which was aggravated by my poor > health, I could not bring myself to tell the truth, I could not bring myself > to say that I was guilty. And instead of saying, \\"Yes, I am guilty,\\" I > almost mechanically answered, \\"No, I am not guilty.\\" Such a reversion was a rare episode in the show trials of the late 1930s. Krestinsky was sentenced to death and executed in March 1938. He was partially exonerated during Nikita Khrushchev's De-Stalinization program. Krestinsky was cleared of all charges during Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika reforms.Robert Williams Davies, The Soviet History in the Gorbachev Revolution, (Indiana University Press, 1989), p. 146 References External links  Category:1883 births Category:1938 deaths Category:People from Mogilev Category:People from Mogilyovsky Uyezd (Mogilev Governorate) Category:Old Bolsheviks Category:Russian Constituent Assembly members Category:Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union members Category:Left Opposition Category:Ambassadors of the Soviet Union to Germany Category:Russian people executed by the Soviet Union Category:Great Purge victims from Belarus Category:Case of the Anti-Soviet \\"Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites\\" Category:Soviet show trials Category:Soviet rehabilitations ","title":"Nikolay Krestinsky"},{"id":"561317","text":"150px 5-1-1 is a transportation and traffic information telephone hotline in some regions of the United States and Canada. Travelers can dial the three- digit telephone number on landlines and most mobile phones. The number has also extended to be the default name of many state and provincial transportation department road conditions Web sites, such as Wisconsin's site. It is an example of an N11 code, part of the North American Numbering Plan. 5-1-1 services in the United States are organized by state or region. Some 5-1-1 services are limited to information for drivers regarding road conditions and traffic. Other services have a wider scope, also providing information on public transport, carpooling and other services. In the United States History and implementation Beginning as a research project at the University of North Dakota in the Summer 1995, an Advanced Traveler Information System, known by its phone number #SAFE (#7233). This initial system provided the proof of concept for a statewide application across both North and South Dakota, and later Minnesota. This system proved that all interstates, and state highways, could be covered and information about these roadways could be provided to travelers on demand 24/7. After more than 5 years of around the clock operations, the principles that established the operational and business rules of the #SAFE program were adopted by the FHWA as the initial guidelines of what was to later become 5-1-1. As of March 2001, at least 300 telephone numbers existed for travel information systems in the United States. To overcome the confusion caused by this array of numbers, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a national assignment of a single three- digit N11 dialing code. On July 21, 2000, the FCC assigned 511 as a nationwide telephone number for intelligent transportation system (ITS) traveler information, along with 2-1-1 for social services. Its use is being promoted by the USDOT's ITS initiative. The first 511 traveler information system to launch was in the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky metropolitan area in June 2001.\\"511 Deployment Status\\" , USDOT. Retrieved on March 3, 2008 The first statewide 511 traveler information system was launched across the state of Nebraska in October 2001.\\"Nebraska 511 Information\\" , USDOT. Retrieved on June 12, 2009 Eight states, from Alaska to Maine, pooled resources and expertise to develop the 511 voice-activated phone service for travelers. Led by the Iowa DOT, the multi-state consortium received $700,000 from the Federal Highway Administration to help pay for system design and software development. Each state also provided a 20 percent matching fund, boosting total funds to nearly $900,000. In addition to Iowa, the participating states in the consortium (as of 2011) are Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Sacramento Area Council of Governments, and Vermont. Individual states have the lead role in coordinating 511 deployments. National leadership is provided by the 511 Deployment Coalition. Led by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), and including travel information experts from more than 30 organizations, the Coalition has developed voluntary guidelines for state transportation agencies to follow when planning 511 service for their states or regions. Other leading member organizations of the Coalition include the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), the Intelligent Transportation Society of America (ITS America), and the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Georgia This statewide Georgia Navigator system provides traffic, MARTA/GRTA and other public transport, rideshare, Clean Air Campaign, Atlanta and Savannah airport, Amtrak, Greyhound, weather and tourism information in an interactive voice response (IVR) format. Callers are also given the option of connecting to live operators at the Georgia Department of Transportation's Transportation Management Center in Atlanta. Connecting to operators allows users to report traffic accidents to the Georgia State Patrol or local police or sheriffs, or request motorist assistance from the Highway Emergency Response Operators (HERO) program. Callers can also connect to adjacent states' 5-1-1 systems, including North Carolina's. In January 2011, the Georgia Department of Transportation launched a mobile application on the iPhone platform to provide iPhone users with a mobile option for up to the minute traffic information found on the website. The application also provides special offers and other information about businesses and organizations who participate in the program. Georgia actually had a system for years before this, using only live operators, and the code *DOT (*368), which could not necessarily be used by those mobile phone users who were roaming from elsewhere, as these codes are specific to each phone company. A local 404 number in metro Atlanta and a toll-free 800 number were used for these and landline calls, and still serve as backup for mobile providers that fail to connect. Kentucky In Kentucky, 511 services cover traffic and weather conditions, and can also be heard on the radio on the AM dial (the Travelers' Information Station) and at 511.ky.gov. New Hampshire The New Hampshire Department of Transportation has implemented a service that helps commuters and travelers access information regarding weather-related road conditions, construction and congestion, via the Web or mobile device 24/7. The site can be found at www.511nh.com. New Hampshire is part of an 8-state consortium that is sharing the cost to design and develop the system.

Tennessee Implemented in August 2006, Tennessee travelers have the option of accessing road and travel conditions at TN511.com or through the 511 phone service. Virginia The FCC designated 511 as the national traveler information number. Virginia's 511 system began in the Shenandoah Valley in 2000 and went statewide in early 2005. Currently both the 511virginia.org website and calling 511 from any land line or mobile phone provides statewide travelling information. Alternatively, there is now a 511 VDOT app for iOS and Android devices. West Virginia The West Virginia Department of Transportation's free 511 Traveler Information System provides real-time traffic information, including congestion, construction, lane closures, road conditions and severe weather information on all West Virginia interstates and other major highways. The resource is available 24 hours a day via phone by dialing 511 or online at WV511.org. WV 511 advisories also are available from the WV 511 Drive Safe mobile app and via statewide, regional and roadway-specific Twitter feeds. The public safety alerts (such as Amber Alerts and Silver Alerts) carried on 511 are voluntary, cooperative partnerships among law enforcement, WVDOT, other agencies and local broadcasters. WVDOT uses overhead electronic message signs and 511 to get public safety alerts out to the public. 511 was implemented in West Virginia in 2012.

In addition, 511.org provides information on bicycling, ridesharing, and the toll road system FasTrak. 511.org is a service of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and was designed by the transportation engineering company Parsons Brinckerhoff, Farradyne (now Telvent Farradyne).

No information identifying a FasTrak account, person or vehicle using the Toll Tag will be collected by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission or '511'. 511 has since stopped using FasTrak toll tag data to provide driving times. Driving times are now derived from GPS probe vehicle-based traffic speed data that 511 purchases from INRIX, Inc. In 2006, the Bay Area's transit coordinator signed an $11 million four-year contract with defense contractor Science Applications International Corporation to operate the local 511 system. =San Diego= Users of the San Diego area have access to road, transit, and other information via the phone and Web. They can access transit information on a Web site,http://www.511sd.com which provides information on mass transit schedules and an interactive trip planner, which will provide an optimal routing between a given origin, destination, and optional time constraints. In addition, 511sd.com provides information on bicycling, ridesharing, and the toll road system Fastrak. 511sd.com is a service of the San Diego Association of Governments, and was designed by the company ICx Technologies and PB Farradyne (now Telvent Farradyne). Elsewhere in the United States Similar services are operated in other cities and states; for example, the Minnesota Department of Transportation operates a website for traffic and road condition information. Central Florida is claimed to have the most-used 511 system in the nation, on a per capita basis. In Canada Implementation The Intelligent Transportation Systems Society of Canada (ITS Canada) has brought together a consortium, the Canada 511 Consortium, to help get 5-1-1 service established in Canada. In January 2005, the consortium filed an application to assign the 5-1-1 access code in Canada. It proposed that in addition to traffic, the number would report weather, which also has a major impact on traffic, particularly in a country with such harsh winters. The application was approved by the CRTC in Canada on July 28, 2006. In March 2007, an article in Computing Canada said it was up to each individual province whether or not to launch a 5-1-1 system, but that not all provinces were eager to proceed. In May 2008, an article in ComputerWorld Canada claimed that the 5-1-1 initiative \\"appears to have lost momentum\\". British Columbia began loose implementation of 5-1-1 service in late 2009/early 2010. This replaced the interim mobile service provided by *4997 (*HWYS) which had been in place on Rogers, Telus Mobility and Bell Mobility. BC 5-1-1 service is available to Telus, Telus Mobility and Telus MiKE clients at this time. Full service NOT utilizing 5-1-1 is available via DriveBC (a government website/phone line) at www.drivebc.ca or by phone across North America at 1-800-550-4997 (HWYS). Alberta unveiled its 5-1-1 road report service on February 4, 2013. In Saskatchewan 5-1-1 redirects to 888-335-7623 which is the Highways Hotline, a Provincial phone information system with highway weather and impassibility information. The Implementation date is Unknown. Active systems Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Click either of the \\"Available services\\" tabs to see the original quoted text. Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and the Yukon Territory each have 5-1-1 systems. Most provinces and territories without 5-1-1 systems have other road information hotlines, accessible by dialing various phone numbers.

In Canada, the number is used for non-urgent health services. In the United States, 8-1-1 provides a uniform national phone number to access local utility location services.  By country   Canada  In July 2005, the Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) assigned 8-1-1 for non- urgent health teletriage/telehealth services. In May 2008, the province of Quebec announced the adoption of 8-1-1 for this purpose, followed by the Yukon in July of 2008, British Columbia in November 2008, Nova Scotia in July 2009, Saskatchewan in March 2013, Alberta in June 2015, and Newfoundland and Labrador in July 2015. Since 1997, New Brunswick implemented a province-wide Tele-Care service, adopting the 8-1-1 number in place of the toll-free 800 number in 2010. Quebec has since supplemented its teletriage service (Info- Sant√©) with access to a social worker to deal with situations of psychosocial distress (Info-Social) at the same 8-1-1 number.  United States  150px In March 2005, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) made 8-1-1 the universal number for the 71 regional services that coordinate location services for underground public utilities in the U.S.http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-257293A1.pdf Before that time, each of these \\"call before you dig\\" services had its own 800 number, and the FCC and others wanted to make it as easy as possible for everyone planning an excavation to call first. This safety measure not only helps prevent damage that interrupts telecommunications, but also the cutting of subterranean power lines, water mains, and natural gas pipes. Underground utilities are located via color-coded markings typically up to and not past the user's service connection or meter. Lines on the other side of the meter or service connection are considered to be part of the customer's property and will typically not be located by these services. Establishment of an abbreviated dialing number for this purpose was required by the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. The use of 8-1-1 for \\"call before you dig\\" services was long established in California and Nevada, through an organization known as Underground Service Alert, before the FCC mandated its use for this purpose.  Previous uses  Prior to 2005, the FCC had never officially assigned 8-1-1 for any service, but did not prevent its use either. Traditionally, 8-1-1 has been a direct line to the business office of the telephone company providing service on the line. From there, one may perform some or all of the following operations: * Pay the bill * Order additional lines * Order and cancel services * Order and rent equipment * Order calling cards * Speak to customer service Such services have been merged into 6-1-1. Mobile phones sometimes use 6-1-1 for this purpose as well. Many telephone companies, including Canada's Telus, are experimenting with merging 8-1-1 and 6-1-1 service now that neither will usually route directly to a human operator. Generally, an automatic phone answering system or other automated attendant will now answer both lines anyway. At one point in time, this number routed to 9-1-1 as a misdialed call, but this operation has long passed from use. It was designed so that when someone was in a crisis, they would not be panicked by having reached the wrong line. However, the reassignment of this code was required due to the scarcity of N11 numbers.

Over the 20-year history of the program, over 170 individual missions were flown. The program, which was officially known as the Small, Self-Contained Payloads program, was canceled following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster on February 1, 2003.  History  Two Getaway Special (GAS) canisters, used on STS-91 The program was conceived by NASA's Shuttle program manager John Yardley, and announced in the fall of 1976. The \\"Getaway Special\\" nickname originated from a special vacation fare for flights between Los Angeles and Honolulu being advertised by Trans World Airlines at the time around the program's conception. The first Getaway Special was purchased by Gilbert Moore of Thiokol on October 12, 1976, and donated to Utah State University. It was flown on Columbia during STS-4 in June/July 1982.https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/shuttle_pk/pk/Flight_004_STS-004_Press_Kit.pdf The program was canceled after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster on February 1, 2003. The last Getaway Special, which was carried aboard STS-107, was the Freestar experiment package, which carried six different experiments. Much of the data was lost when Columbia was destroyed, but some data was transmitted during the mission. After reorganization of the Shuttle Program, NASA cited the need for the remaining Shuttle fleet to complete assembly of the ISS to justify its decision to cancel the program. The GAS program canisters and GAS Bridge combined weight were only usable on low orbit missions, which were rescheduled with higher priority payloads. With payload and program limits set on the remaining Shuttle missions until the expected STS close-out in 2010, the GAS program was eliminated.  Allocation  To assure that diverse groups would have access to space, NASA rotated GAS payload assignments among four major categories of users: educational, foreign, commercial, and U.S. government. GAS payloads had been reserved by foreign governments and individuals; U.S. industrialists, foundations, high schools, colleges and universities; professional societies; service clubs; and many others. Although persons and groups involved in space research obtained many of the reservations, a large number of spaces were reserved by persons and organizations outside the space community. GAS requests were first approved at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., by the director of the Transportation Services Office. At that point NASA screened the propriety and objectives of each request. To complete the reservation process for GAS payloads, each request was accompanied or preceded by the payment of $500. Approved requests were assigned an identification number and referred to the GAS team at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, the designated lead center for the project. The GAS team screened the proposals for safety and provided advice and consultation on payload design. It certified that proposed payloads would be safe and would not harm or interfere with the operations of the space shuttle, its crew, or other experiments on the flight. The costs of any physical testing required to answer safety questions before launch were borne by the GAS customer.  Requirements  Space Shuttle Discovery cargo bay. This image is from STS-91. The front of the Shuttle is to the left of the picture. There were no stringent requirements to qualify for participation in the GAS program. However, each payload was required to meet specific safety criteria, have been screened for its propriety, as well as being evaluated for its educational, scientific or technological objectives. These guidelines preclude commemorative items, such as medallions, that are intended for sale as objects that have flown in space. NASA's Space Shuttle program had specific standards and conditions relating to GAS payloads. Payloads were required to have fit into NASA standard containers and weigh no more than . Two or more experiments could have been included in a single container if they fit while not exceeding weight limitations. The payload must have been self-powered, as experiments could not draw on the Shuttle orbiter's electricity. In addition, the crew's involvement with GAS payloads was limited to six simple activities (such as turning on and off up to three payload switches), due to the fact that crew activity schedules do not provide opportunities to either monitor or service GAS payloads in flight. The cost of this unique service depended on the size and weight of the experiment. Getaway specials of and cost $10,000; and , $5,000; and and , $3,000. The weight of the GAS container, experiment mounting plate and its attachment screws, and all hardware regularly supplied by NASA was not charged to the experimenter's weight allowance. The GAS container provided internal pressure, which could be varied from near vacuum to about one atmosphere. The bottom and sides of the container were always thermally insulated, and the top may have been insulated or not, depending on the specific experiment. A lid that could be opened, or one with a window, may be required, and were offered as options at additional cost. The GAS containers were made of aluminum, and the circular end plates are 5‚ÅÑ8 inch (16 mm) thick aluminum. The bottom of the container were reserved for NASA interface equipment, such as command decoders and pressure regulating systems. The container was a pressure vessel that could be evacuated before or during launch, or on orbit, and could be re-pressurized during re-entry, or on orbit, as required by the experimenter. The getaway bridge, which was capable of holding 12 canisters, made its maiden flight on STS-61-C. The aluminum bridge fit across the payload bay of the orbiter and offered a convenient and economic way of flying several GAS canisters.

The Everything John F. Kennedy Book: Relive the History, Romance, and Tragedy of America's Camelot presidential candidate John F. Kennedy in his acceptance speech in the 1960 United States presidential election to the Democratic National Convention at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as the Democratic slogan to inspire America to support him. The phrase developed into a label for his administration's domestic and foreign programs. In the words of Robert D. Marcus: \\"Kennedy entered office with ambitions to eradicate poverty and to raise America's eyes to the stars through the space program.\\"Marcus, Robert D. A Brief History of the United States since 1945 Among the legislation passed by Congress during the Kennedy Administration, unemployment benefits were expanded, aid was provided to cities to improve housing and transportation, funds were allocated to continue the construction of a national highway system started under Eisenhower, a water pollution control act was passed to protect the country's rivers and streams, and an agricultural act to raise farmers' incomes was made law.Dallek, Robert. An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917‚Äì1963 A significant amount of anti-poverty legislation was passed by Congress, including increases in social security benefits and in the minimum wage, several housing bills, and aid to economically distressed areas. A few antirecession public works packages, together with a number of measures designed to assist farmers,Nordin, Dennis Sven; Scott, Roy Vernon. From Prairie Farmer to Entrepreneur: The Transformation of Midwestern Agriculture were introduced. Major expansions and improvements were made in Social Security (including retirement at 62 for men), hospital construction, library services, family farm assistance and reclamation.Sorensen, Theodore C. Kennedy Food stamps for low-income Americans were reintroduced, food distribution to the poor was increased, and there was an expansion in school milk and school lunch distribution. The most comprehensive farm legislation since 1938 was carried out, with expansions in rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, farm credit, and marketing orders. In September 1961, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency was established as the focal point in government for the \\"planning, negotiation, and execution of international disarmament and arms control agreements.\\"Seaborg, Glenn Theodore; Loeb, Benjamin S. Kennedy, Khrushchev, and the Test Ban Altogether, the New Frontier witnessed the passage of a broad range of important social and economic reforms. According to Theodore White, under John F. Kennedy, more new legislation was actually approved and passed into law than at any other time since the Thirties.White, Theodore Harold. The Making of the President, 1964 When Congress recessed in the latter part of 1961, 33 out of 53 bills that Kennedy had submitted to Congress were enacted. A year later, 40 out of 54 bills that the Kennedy Administration had proposed were passed by Congress, and in 1963, 35 out of 58 \\"must\\" bills were enacted. As noted by Larry O'Brien, \\"A myth had arisen that he [Kennedy] was uninterested in Congress, or that he 'failed' with Congress. The facts, I believe, are otherwise. Kennedy's legislative record in 1961‚Äì63 was the best of any President since Roosevelt's first term.\\"Bernstein, Irving. Promises Kept: John F. Kennedy's New Frontier. Background Historians and political scientists were given prominent positions within the Kennedy administration. Several themes that were popular in the post-World War II American histories were apparent during the administration and also reflected in the television series Profiles in Courage. Arthur Schlesinger Jr. was an important figure in the post-war efforts to create a \\"moderately liberal domestic consensus\\". Beginning in 1961, Schlesinger served as a special assistant to Kennedy. He was a member of the liberal lobbying group Americans for Democratic Action and in 1949 he published The Vital Center, a book which has been described as \\"a manifesto for anticommunist liberals, defining an agenda that combined the social concerns of the New Deal with support for the Cold War policy of containment of Soviet power.\\" Within Schlesinger's analytical framework of the domestic politics of the United States during this period he identifies three main ideological currents: 1) what he calls the \\"vital center\\" are the \\"New Deal liberals\\" who had been gaining ground politically since 1933, 2) right-wing racial extremists mostly confined to the Southern regions of the United States, and 3) Communists who Schlesinger identifies as posing the \\"primary opposition to American values from within and without\\". Schlesinger, working on Kennedy's presidential campaign in 1960, sought an image of the candidate that would show the candidate's personal and individual accomplishment as counter to a collectivist ethos. Schlesinger's work along with Richard Neustadt's and other thinkers were key influences in the development of the New Frontier-era policies. Legislation and programs Economy The Kennedy Administration pushed an economic stimulus program through congress in an effort to kick-start the American economy following an economic downturn. On February 2, 1961, Kennedy sent a comprehensive Economic Message to Congress which had been in preparation for several weeks. The legislative proposals put forward in this message included: #The addition of a temporary thirteen-week supplement to jobless benefits, #The extension of aid to the children of unemployed workers, #The redevelopment of distressed areas, #An increase in Social Security payments and the encouragement of earlier retirement, #An increase in the minimum wage and an extension in coverage, #The provision of emergency relief to feed grain farmers, and #The financing of a comprehensive home building and slum clearance program. The following month, the first of these seven measures became law, and the remaining six measures had been signed by the end of June. Altogether, the economic stimulus program provided an estimated 420,000 construction jobs under a new Housing Act, $175 million in higher wages for those below the new minimum, over $400 million in aid to over 1,000 distressed counties, over $200 million in extra welfare payments to 750,000 children and their parents, and nearly $800 million in extended unemployment benefits for nearly three million unemployed Americans. * Under his own presidential authority, Kennedy carried out various measures to boost the economy under his own executive anti-recessionary acceleration program. Through his own initiative, he directed all Federal agencies to accelerate their procurement and construction, particularly in labor surplus areas. A long-range program of post office construction was compressed into the first six months of his presidency, farm price supports were raised and their payments advanced, over a billion dollars in state highway aid funds were released ahead of schedule, and the distribution of tax refunds and GI life insurance dividends were sped up. In addition, free food distribution to needy families was expanded, state governors were urged by Kennedy to spend federal funds more rapidly for hospitals, schools, roads, and waste treatment facilities, the college housing and urban renewal programs were pushed forward, and procurement agencies were directed to make purchases in areas of high unemployment. * In an attempt to expand credit and stimulate building, Kennedy ordered a reduction in the maximum permissible interest rate on FHA insured loans, reduced the interest rate on Small Business Administration loans in distressed areas, expanded its available credit and liberalized lending by the Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Reserve Board was also encouraged to help keep long-term interest rates low through the purchase of long-term government issues. * By 1964 economic recovery had begun, as low interest rates in mid-1962 stimulated a boom in the housing industry, while accelerated expenditures on veterans' benefits, highway building, and other government procurement programs revived consumer demand. * The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 authorized the president to negotiate tariff reductions on a reciprocal basis of up to 50 percent with the European Common Market. It provided legislative authority for U.S. participation in multilateral trade negotiations from 1964 to 1967, which became known as the Kennedy Round. The authority expired June 30, 1967, predetermining the concluding date of the Kennedy Round. U.S. duties below five percent ad valorem, duties on certain agricultural commodities, and duties on tropical products exported by developing countries could be reduced to zero under the act. The 1962 legislation explicitly eliminated the \\"Peril Point\\" provision that had limited U.S. negotiating positions in earlier General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) rounds, and instead called on the Tariff Commission and other agencies of the U.S. government to provide the president and his negotiators with information regarding the probable economic effects of specific tariff concessions. Taxation Under the Kennedy Administration, the most significant tax reforms since the New Deal were carried out, including a new investment tax credit. President Kennedy said one of the best ways to bolster the economy was to cut taxes, and December 14, 1962, Kennedy stated at the Economic Club of New York that: > The final and best means of strengthening demand among consumers and > business is to reduce the burden on private income and the deterrents to > private initiative which are imposed by our present tax system; and this > administration pledged itself last summer to an across-the-board, top-to- > bottom cut in personal and corporate income taxes to be enacted and become > effective in 1963. I am not talking about a 'quickie' or a temporary tax > cut, which would be more appropriate if a recession were imminent. Nor am I > talking about giving the economy a mere shot in the arm, to ease some > temporary complaint. I am talking about the accumulated evidence of the last > 5 years that our present tax system, developed as it was, in good part, > during World War II to restrain growth, exerts too heavy a drag on growth in > peace time; that it siphons out of the private economy too large a share of > personal and business purchasing power; that it reduces the financial > incentives for personal effort, investment, and risk-taking.King, John A. > and Vile, John R. (eds.) Presidents from Eisenhower through Johnson, > 1953‚Äì1969 (2006) p. 95 Kennedy specifically advocated cutting the corporate tax rate in this same speech. \\"Corporate tax rates must also be cut to increase incentives and the availability of investment capital. The Government has already taken major steps this year to reduce business tax liability and to stimulate the modernization, replacement, and expansion of our productive plant and equipment. We have done this through the 1962 investment tax credit and through the liberalization of depreciation allowances‚Äîtwo essential parts of our first step in tax revision which amounted to a 10 percent reduction in corporate income taxes worth $2.5 billion.\\" President Kennedy went on to say he favored tax cuts for the rich as well as the poor: > Next year's tax bill should reduce personal as well as corporate income > taxes, for those in the lower brackets, who are certain to spend their > additional take-home pay, and for those in the middle and upper brackets, > who can thereby be encouraged to undertake additional efforts and enabled to > invest more capital. On the same evening, President Kennedy said the private sector and not the public sector was the key to economic growth: > \\"In short, to increase demand and lift the economy, the Federal Government's > most useful role is not to rush into a program of excessive increases in > public expenditures, but to expand the incentives and opportunities for > private expenditures.\\" President Kennedy told the economic club the impact > he expected from tax cuts. \\"Profit margins will be improved and both the > incentive to invest and the supply of internal funds for investment will be > increased. There will be new interest in taking risks, in increasing > productivity, in creating new jobs and new products for long-term economic > growth.\\"Congressional Quarterly (1965). \\"Congress and the nation: Volume 1, > 1945‚Äì1964. p. 434 Labor * Amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1961 greatly expanded the FLSA's scope in the retail trade sector and increased the minimum wage for previously covered workers to $1.15 an hour effective September 1961 and to $1.25 an hour in September 1963. The minimum for workers newly subject to the Act was set at $1.00 an hour effective September 1961, $1.15 an hour in September 1964, and $1.25 an hour in September 1965. Retail and service establishments were allowed to employ full-time students at wages of no more than 15 percent below the minimum with proper certification from the Department of Labor. The amendments extended coverage to employees of retail trade enterprises with sales exceeding $1 million annually, although individual establishments within those covered enterprises were exempt if their annual sales fell below $250,000. The concept of enterprise coverage was introduced by the 1961 amendments. Those amendments extended coverage in the retail trade industry from an established 250,000 workers to 2.2 million. * An Executive Order was issued (1962) which provided federal employees with collective bargaining rights.Rosenbloom, David H.

This legislation marked the first time that a consistent guideline for regular increases was applied to the national pay scales for federal white-collar and postal employees. * The Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (1962) established \\"standards for hours, overtime compensation, and safety for employees working on federal and federally funded contracts and subcontracts\\".Freeman, Richard B.; Hersch, Joni; Mishel, Lawrence. Emerging Labor Market Institutions for the Twenty-First Century * An 11-member Missile Site Labor Commission was established \\"to develop procedures for settling disputes on the government's 22 missile bases.\\" * A pilot program was launched to train and place youths in jobs. * Paid overtime was granted to workers on government financed construction jobs for work in excess of 40 hours. Education * Scholarships and student loans were broadened under existing laws by Kennedy, and new means of specialized aid to education were invented or expanded by the president, including an increase in funds for libraries and school lunches, the provision of funds to teach the deaf, children with physical or cognitive disabilities, and gifted children, the authorization of literacy training under Manpower Development, the allocation of president funds to stop dropouts, a quadrupling of vocational education, and working together with schools on delinquency. Altogether, these measures attacked serious educational problems and freed up local funds for use on general construction and salaries. * Various measures were introduced which aided educational television, college dormitories, medical education, and community libraries. * The Educational Television Facilities Act (1962) provided federal grants for new station construction, enabling in-class-room instructional television to operate in thousands of elementary schools, offering primarily religious instruction, music, and arts.Browne, Pat. The Guide to United States Popular Culture * The Health Professions Educational Assistance Act (1963) provided $175 million over a three-year period for matching grants for the construction of facilities for teaching physicians, dentists, nurses, podiatrists, optometrists, pharmacists, and other health professionals. The Act also created a loan program of up to $2000 per annum for students of optometry, dentistry, and medicine. * The Vocational Education Act (1963) significantly increased enrollment in vocational education.Bremner, Robert Hamlett. Children and Youth in America: A Documentary history: Volume 3, Part 1 * A law was enacted (1961) to encourage and facilitate the training of teachers of the deaf. * The Fulbright-Hays Act of 1961 enlarged the scope of the Fulbright program while extending it geographically. * An estimated one- third of all major New Frontier programs made some form of education a vital element, and the Office of Education called it \\"the most significant legislative period in its hundred-year history\\". * The McIntire‚ÄìStennis Act of 1962 provided federal financial support to universities and colleges for forestry research and graduate education. Welfare * Unemployment and welfare benefits were expanded.Weir, Robert E. Class in America: A-G * In 1961, Social Security benefits were increased by 20% and provision for early retirement was introduced, enabling workers to retire at the age of sixty-two while receiving partial benefits.Ferrara, Peter J.; Tanner, Michael. A New Deal for Social Security * The Social Security Amendments of 1961 permitted male workers to elect early retirement age 62, increased minimum benefits, liberalized the benefit payments to aged widow, widower, or surviving dependent parent, and also liberalized eligibility requirements and the retirement test. * The 1962 amendments to the Social Security Act authorized the federal government to reimburse states for the provision of social services.Blau, Joel; Abramovitz, Mimi. The Dynamics of Social Welfare Policy * The School Lunch Act was amended for authority to begin providing free meals in poverty-stricken areas. * A pilot food stamp program was launched (1961), covering six areas in the United States. In 1962, the program was extended to eighteen areas, feeding 240,000 people.Giglio, James N.; Rabe, Stephen G. Debating the Kennedy Presidency * Various school lunch and school milk programs were extended, \\"enabling 700,000 more children to enjoy a hot school lunch and eighty-five thousand more schools, child care centers, and camps to receive fresh milk\\". * ADC was extended to whole families (1961).Kingfisher, Catherine P√©lissier. Western Welfare in Decline: Globalization and Women's Poverty * Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) replaced the Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) program, as coverage was extended to adults caring for dependent children. * A major revision of the public welfare laws was carried out, with a $300 million modernisation which emphasised rehabilitation instead of relief\\". * A temporary antirecession supplement to unemployment compensation was introduced. * Food distribution to needy Americans was increased. In January 1961, the first executive order issued by Kennedy mandated that the Department of Agriculture increase the quantity and variety of foods donated for needy households. This executive order represented a shift in the Commodity Distribution Programs' primary purpose, from surplus disposal to that of providing nutritious foods to low-income households. * Social Security benefits were extended to an additional five million Americans. * The Self-Employed Individuals Tax Retirement Act (1962) provided self-employed people with a tax postponement for income set aside in qualified pension plans. * The Public Welfare Amendments of 1962 provided for greater Federal sharing in the cost of rehabilitative services to applicants, recipients, and persons likely to become applicants for public assistance. It increased the Federal share in the cost of public assistance payments, and permitted the States to combine the various categories into one category. The amendments also made permanent the 1961 amendment which extended aid to dependent children to cover children removed from unsuitable homes. * Federal funds were made available for the payment of foster care costs for AFDC- eligible children who had come into state custody.Smith, Eve P.; Merkel- Holgu√≠n, Lisa A. A History of Child Welfare * An act was approved (1963) which extended for one year the period during which responsibility for the placement and foster care of dependent children, under the program of aid to families with dependent children under Title IV of the Social Security Act. * Federal civil service retirement benefits were index-linked to changes in the Consumer Price Index (1962). Civil rights * Various measures were carried out by the Kennedy Justice Department to enforce court orders and existing legislation. The Kennedy Administration promoted a Voter Education Project which led to 688,800 between 1 April 1962 and 1 November 1964, while the Civil Rights Division brought over forty-two suits in four states in order to secure voting rights for blacks. In addition, Kennedy supported the anti-poll tax amendment, which cleared Congress in September 1962 (although it was not ratified until 1964 as the Twenty-fourth Amendment). As noted by one student of black voting in the South, in relation to the attempts by the Kennedy Administration to promote civil rights, \\"Whereas the Eisenhower lawyers had moved deliberately, the Kennedy-Johnson attorneys pushed the judiciary far more earnestly.\\"Parmet, Herbert S. JFK: The Presidency of John F. Kennedy * Executive Order 10925 (issued in 1961) combined the federal employment and government contractor agencies into a unified Committee on Equal Employment opportunity (CEEO). This new committee helped to put an end to segregation and discriminatory employment practices (such as only employing African-Americans for low-skilled jobs) in a number of workplaces across the United States. * Executive Order 11063 banned discrimination in federally funded housing. * The Interstate Commerce Commission made Jim Crow illegal in interstate transportation, having been put under pressure to do so by both the Freedom Riders and the Department of Justice. * Employment of African-Americans in federal jobs such as in the Post office, the Navy, and the Veterans Administration as a result of the Kennedy Administration's affirmative action policies. * The Kennedy Administration forbade government contractors from discriminating against any applicant or employee for employment on the grounds of national origin, color, creed, or race. * The Plan for Progress was launched by the CEEO to persuade large employers to adopt equal opportunity practices. By 1964 268 firms with 8 million employees had signed on to this, while a nationwide study covering the period from May 1961 to June 1963 of 103 corporations \\"showed a Negro gain from 28,940 to 42,738 salaried and from 171,021 to 198,161 hourly paid jobs\\". Housing * The most comprehensive housing and urban renewal program in American history up until that point was carried out, including the first major provisions for middle-income housing, protection of urban open spaces, public mass transit, and private low-income housing. *Omnibus Housing Bill 1961. In March 1961 President Kennedy sent Congress a special message, proposing an ambitious and complex housing program to spur the economy, revitalize cities, and provide affordable housing for middle- and low-income families. The bill proposed spending $3.19 billion and placed major emphasis on improving the existing housing supply, instead of on new housing starts, and creating a cabinet-level Department of Housing and Urban Affairs to oversee the programs. The bill also promised to make the Federal Housing Administration a full partner in urban renewal program by authorizing mortgage loans to finance rehabilitation of homes and urban renewal Committee on housing combined programs for housing, mass transportation, and open space land bills into a single bill. * Urban renewal grants were increased from $2 to $4 million, while an additional 100,000 units of public housing were constructed. * Opportunities were provided for coordinated planning of community development: technical assistance to state and local governments. * Under the Kennedy Administration, there was a change of focus from a wrecker ball approach to small rehabilitation projects in order to preserve existing 'urban textures'. * Funds for housing for the elderly were increased. * Title V of the Housing Act was amended (1961) to make nonfarm rural residents eligible for direct housing loans from the Farmers Home Administration. These changes extended the housing program to towns with a population of up to 2,500. * The Senior Citizens Housing Act (1962) established loans for low-rent apartment projects which were \\"designed to meet the needs of people age 62 and over\\". Unemployment * To help the unemployed, Kennedy broadened the distribution of surplus food, created a \\"pilot\\" Food Stamp program for poor Americans, directed that preference be given to distressed areas in defense contracts, and expanded the services of U.S. Employment Offices. * Social security benefits were extended to each child whose father was unemployed.Mastering Modern World History by Norman Lowe, second edition * The first accelerated public works program for areas of unemployment since the New Deal was launched. * The first full-scale modernization and expansion of the vocational education laws since 1946 were carried out. * Federal grants were provided to the states enabling them to extend the period covered by unemployment benefit. * The Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962 authorized a three-year program aimed at retraining workers displaced by new technology. The bill did not exclude employed workers from benefiting and it authorized a training allowance for unemployed participants. Even though 200,000 people were recruited, there was minimal impact, comparatively. The Area Redevelopment Act, a $394 million spending package passed in 1961, followed a strategy of investing in the private sector to stimulate new job creation. It specifically targeted businesses in urban and rural depressed areas and authorized $4.5 million annually over four years for vocational training programs. * The 1963 amendments to the National Defense Education Act included $731 million in appropriations to states and localities maintaining vocational training programs. Health * In 1963, Kennedy, who had a mentally ill sister named Rosemary, submitted the nation's first presidential special message to Congress on mental health issues. Congress quickly passed the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act (P.L. 88-164), beginning a new era in Federal support for mental health services. The National Institute of Mental Health assumed responsibility for monitoring community mental health centers programs. This measure was a great success as there was a sixfold increase in people using Mental Health facilities. * A Medical Health Bill for the Aged (later known as Medicare) was proposed, but Congress failed to enact it. * The Community Health Services and Facilities Act (1961) increased the amount of funds available for nursing home construction and extended the research and demonstration grant program to other medical facilities.Kronenfeld, Jennie J. The changing Federal Role in U.S. Health Care Policy * The Health Services for Agricultural Migratory Workers Act (1962) established \\"a program of federal grants for family clinics and other health services for migrant workers and their families\\". * The first major amendments to the food and drug safety laws since 1938 were carried out. The Drug Amendments of 1962 amended the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (1938) by strengthening the provisions related to the regulation of therapeutic drugs. The Act required evidence that new drugs proposed for marketing were both safe and effective, and required improved manufacturing processes and procedures. * The responsibilities of the Food and Drug Administration were significantly enlarged by the Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments (1962). * The Vaccination Assistance Act (1962) provided for the vaccination of millions of children against a number of diseases.McKinlay, John B. Issues in Health care Policy * The Social Security Act Amendments of 1963 improved medical services for crippled childrenRossi, Peggy. Case Management in Health Care and established a new project grant program to improve prenatal care for women from low income families with very high risks of mental retardation and other birth defects. Authorizations for grants to the states under the Maternal and Child Health and Crippled Children's programs were also increased and a research grant program was added. *The Mental Retardation Facilities Construction Act of 1963 authorized federal support for the construction of university-affiliated training facilities, mental retardation research centers, and community service facilities for adults and children with mental retardation. Equal rights for women The Presidential Commission on the Status of Women was an advisory commission established on December 14, 1961, by Kennedy to investigate questions regarding women's equality in education, in the workplace, and under the law. The commission, chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt until her death in 1962, was composed of 26 members including legislators, labor union activists and philanthropists who were active in women's rights issues. The main purpose of the committee was to document and examine employment policies in place for women. The commission's final report, American Woman (also known as the Peterson Report after the commission's second chair, Esther Peterson), was issued in October 1963 and documented widespread discrimination against women in the workplace. Among the practices addressed by the group were labor laws pertaining to hours and wages, the quality of legal representation for women, the lack of education and counseling for working women, and federal insurance and tax laws that affected women's incomes. Recommendations included affordable child care for all income levels, hiring practices that promoted equal opportunity for women, and paid maternity leave. The commission, reflecting the views of Roosevelt and the labor unions, opposed the Equal Rights Amendment. In the early 1960s, full-time working women were paid on average 59 percent of the earnings of their male counterparts. In order to eliminate some forms of sex-based pay discrimination, Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law on June 10, 1963. During the law's first ten years, 171,000 employees received back pay totaling about 84 million dollars.Freeman, Jo. The Politics of Women's Liberation: A Case Study of an Emerging Social Movement and Its Relation to the Policy Process, New York, David Mckay, 1975, 174‚Äì177. Environment * The Clean Air Act (1963) expanded the powers of the federal government in preventing and controlling air pollution. * The first major additions to the National Park System since 1946 were made, which included the preservation of wilderness areas and a fund for future acquisitions. * The water pollution prevention program was doubled. * More aid was provided to localities to combat water pollution. * The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1962 reiterated and expanded upon \\"previous authorizations for outdoor recreation.\\"Foss, Phillip O. Recreation Agriculture *A new Housing Act of 1961 extended the Farmers Home Administration housing loan assistance for the first time to nonfarm rural residents and providers of low-cost housing for domestic farm laborers. The Farmers Home Administration was therefore able to expand its rural housing loans from less than $70 million to nearly $500 million in 1965, or about enough to provide for 50,000 new or rehabilitated housing units. (Chapter 4. The Kennedy Administration Picks Up the Pace) * A 1962 farm bill expanded government food donation programs at home and abroad and provided federal aid to farmers who converted crop land to nonfarm income- producing uses. * Title III of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1962 consolidated and expanded existing loan programs, thereby providing the Farmers Home Administration with increased flexibility in helping a broader spectrum of credit-risky farmers to purchase land and amass working capital. In addition, the Farmers Home Administration assumed responsibility for community water system loans. * Under the Rural Renewal Program of 1962, the USDA provided technical and financial assistance for locally initiated and sponsored programs aimed at ending chronic underemployment and fostering a sound rural economy. Loans were made to local groups to establish small manufacturing plants, to build hospitals, to establish recreation areas, and to carry out similar developmental activities. Crime Under Kennedy, the first significant package of anticrime bills since 1934 were passed. The Kennedy Administration's anticrime measures included the Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Offenses Control Act, which was signed into law on September 22, 1961. This program aimed to prevent youth from committing delinquent acts. In 1963, 288 mobsters were brought to trial by a team that was headed by Kennedy's brother, Robert. Defense The Kennedy administration with its new Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara, gave a strong priority to countering communist political subversion and guerrilla tactics in the \\"wars of national liberation\\" to decolonize the Third World, long held in Western vassalage. As well as fighting and winning a nuclear war, the American military was also trained and equipped for counterinsurgency operations. Though the U.S. Army Special Forces had been created in 1952, Kennedy visited the Fort Bragg U.S. Army Special Warfare Center in a blaze of publicity and gave his permission for the Special Forces to adopt the green beret. The other services launched their own counterinsurgency forces in 1961; the U.S. Air Force created the 1st Air Commando Group and the U.S. Navy created the Navy Seals. The U.S. military increased in size and faced possible confrontation with the Soviets with the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and with the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. American troops were sent to Laos and South Vietnam in increasing numbers. The United States provided a clandestine operation to supply military aid and support to Cuban exiles in the disastrous Bay of Pigs Invasion. Critique as to space The \\"New Frontier\\" has been criticized for an application of settler colonialism and the manifest destiny ideology to space, perpetuating imperialism and a narrative of colonial exploration as fundamental to the assumed human nature.

Jackson was born in Warragul, Victoria, and studied at Warragul High School. She graduated with a Bachelor of Economics degree from Monash University and a Master of Business Administration from the University of Melbourne. She is a chartered accountant and a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia. Jackson was the chairman of Qantas from 2000 to 2007 and was the first woman to become chairman of a top-50 publicly listed company in Australia. She had been a director of Qantas since 1992, her other directorships include the ANZ since 1994 and Billabong. Jackson is a former partner of accounting firm KPMG and has also worked for accounting firms BDO Nelson Parkhill and Pricewaterhouse (now PricewaterhouseCoopers). Qantas takeover bid In early May 2007, Jackson faced mounting pressure to resign from the board of Qantas after the dramatic last-minute failure of the Qantas takeover bid by Airline Partners Australia. After the bid failed, she faced criticism that she had undervalued the airline, was reluctant to release upgraded profit forecasts and did not act in the best interests of the majority of shareholders. Jackson was one of the most outspoken supporters of the takeover bid and, when asked of the ramifications of the bid failing, she famously stated, \\"If anyone thinks this will happen without affecting the (share) price then they have a mental problem with how the market works.\\" This was interpreted by some observers as an insult to shareholders and evidence that Jackson was actively lobbying for the takeover consortium. On 17 May 2007, Jackson informed the Qantas board that she would \\"retire from the board when her term ends at this year's AGM\\", due to be held in November of that year.Qantas chair Margaret Jackson to retire via ninemsn.com.au 17 May 2007 The board put its support behind Jackson's decision to stay on until then because it ensured \\"continuity and stability\\" was maintained in the company. John Howard, then the Australian prime minister, described Jackson's retirement decision as \\"a matter for her\\" and made no direct comment, but expressed his support and confidence in her. Following the collapse of the Qantas sale bid, number of highly respected businesspeople and personalities spoke out in support of Jackson including Sir Rod Eddington (Former Chief Executive Officer of British Airways) and former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett. As Qantas's business performance has deteriorated, and with it the company's stock price, opinions on Jackson and her support of the sale bid have shifted. By May 2008, the share price had fallen by over 40 per cent since the takeover period with the bid price sitting at a 33-per-cent premium. Many media commentators such as Jennifer Hewett have suggested Jackson had been correct in her assertions that the takeover offer was a good deal for shareholders. The increasing difficulties surrounding Qantas seen in 2013 and 2014 led to further public comments by commentators in support of Jackson's actions and comments surrounding the proposed Qantas sale - \\"Meanwhile, former Qantas chair Margaret Jackson will no doubt muse on that $5.40 a share offer which was rejected just before the GFC. She was right, anyone who didn't accept was mad.\\" References External links *Margaret Jackson bio - Qantas Board of Directors *Monash University, Prominent alumni *Margaret Jackson Lecture at Australian National University Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Companions of the Order of Australia Category:Businesspeople in aviation Category:Australian corporate directors Category:Qantas Category:Australian accountants Category:University of Melbourne alumni Category:Monash University alumni Category:Women corporate directors Category:People from Warragul ","title":"Margaret Jackson"},{"id":"561388","text":"William Wallace Denslow (; May 5, 1856 ‚Äì March 29, 1915), professionally W. W. Denslow, was an American illustrator and caricaturist remembered for his work in collaboration with author L. Frank Baum, especially his illustrations of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.Douglas G. Greene and Michael Patrick Hearn, W. W. Denslow, Mount Pleasant, Clark Historical Library, Central Michigan University 1976. Denslow was an editorial cartoonist with a strong interest in politics, which has fueled political interpretations of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Biography Born in Philadelphia, Denslow spent brief periods at the National Academy of Design and the Cooper Union in New York, but was largely self-educated and self-trained. In the 1880s, he traveled about the United States as an artist and newspaper reporter; he came to Chicago for the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, and chose to stay. Denslow acquired his earliest reputation as a poster artist; he also designed books and bookplates, and was the first artist invited to work at the Roycroft Press.L. Frank Baum, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, Edited with an Introduction and Notes by Michael Patrick Hearn; revised edition, New York, W. W. Norton, 2000; pp. xxix-xxx. Denslow may have met Baum at the Chicago Press Club, where both men were members. Besides The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Denslow also illustrated Baum's books By the Candelabra's Glare, Father Goose: His Book, and Dot and Tot of Merryland. Baum and Denslow held the copyrights to most of these works jointly. After Denslow quarreled with Baum over royalty shares from the 1902 stage adaptation of The Wizard of Oz, for which Baum wrote the script and Denslow designed the sets and costumes, Baum determined not to work with him again. (As co-copyright-holder, Denslow demanded an equal share in royalties with Baum and composer Paul Tietjens.) Denslow illustrated an edition of traditional nursery rhymes titled Denslow's Mother Goose (1901), along with Denslow's Night Before Christmas (1902) and the 18-volume Denslow's Picture Books series (1903‚Äì04).The Annotated Wizard of Oz, pp. lii-lvi. He also used his copyright to the art of the Baum books to create newspaper comic strips featuring Father Goose and the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman during the first decade of the twentieth century. He also created the comic strip Billy Bounce, notable as one of the earliest comic strips in which the protagonist has some manner of super powers. The royalties from the print and stage versions of The Wizard of Oz were sufficient to allow Denslow to purchase Bluck's Island, Bermuda, and crown himself King Denslow I. Denslow wrote and illustrated a children's book called The Pearl and the Pumpkin. Personal life The footstone of William Wallace Denslow in Kensico Cemetery, featuring his seahorse insignia and images of the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman Denslow had three wives and three divorces in his lifetime. His first wife, Annie McCartney (n√©e, Anna M. Lowe, 1856-1908) married him in 1882 and gave birth to his only child, a son, the following year. The couple were already separated, however, and Denslow never saw his son. They finally divorced in 1896, freeing her to marry the man she lived with for five months. That same day, February 20, 1896, Denslow married Anne Holden Denslow, the daughter of Martha Holden, writer. The marriage did not last long either. Anne filed for divorce in September 1903, alleging that he told her in June 1901 that he did not love her and henceforth declined to live with her. In less than a month she married a young artist, their friend, Lawrence Mazzanovich, and left with him for Paris. Denslow then married his third wife, Mrs. Frances G. Doolittle December 24. Frances left him in 1906 and they finally divorced in 1911. He changed his will in 1914, leaving his estate to a fourth woman. Legacy In 2018, \\"The Lost Art of Oz\\" project was initiated to locate and catalogue the surviving original artwork John R. Neill, W.W.

Biography Mezzasoma was born in Rome, the son of middle-class Perugians; from his late teens he showed himself to be a passionate supporter of Benito Mussolini. Mezzasoma had to contribute to his impoverished family's income from early on, and took several jobs before finishing studies in accounting. A secretary to the lawyer Amedeo Fani, he was integrated to the state bureaucracy in 1929, after Fani became undersecretary to the ministry of Dino Grandi (the Minister of Foreign Affairs). In 1931, he joined the ranks of the National Fascist Party (PNF), and soon after became secretary of the Perugia branch of the Gruppo Universitario Fascista (GUF), the Fascist student organization. The following year, Mezzasoma was appointed one of the local PNF leaders in Perugia (holding the position until 1935). He began writing for official magazines, such as Dottrina Fascista and Roma Fascista, usually under the pen name Diogene. Editor of Assalto in 1934, he became co-editor of the GUF mouthpiece Libro e Moschetto; in 1937, he published Essenza dei GUF (\\"Essence of the GUF\\"), a propaganda volume that was distributed throughout the network of Fascist youth organizations. A national deputy-secretary of the GUF in 1935, he was included to the leadership group of the PNF in January 1937, and its deputy-secretary on February 23, 1939. When Italy entered World War II as an Axis Power, he volunteered for the 7th Artillery Division. In 1942, he quit the army to become the director of the Italian press; he continued in that role until 1943. Unlike a great many leading figures of the government (such as Galeazzo Ciano and Dino Grandi), he stayed loyal to Mussolini long after the July 1943 Grand Council of Fascism crisis which ended the latter's rule in Rome. With the foundation of the Nazi Germany-assisted Italian Social Republic, he was appointed Mussolini's Minister of Popular Culture, and held this post until the Republic collapsed less than two years later. He clashed with Junio Valerio Borghese and, on April 19, 1945, left for Milano - parting with his collaborators (including Giorgio Almirante). It seems that he had the opportunity to flee the region following Germany's defeat, but would have refused, saying: \\"I am a minister of Mussolini, I shall die with him\\". He was shot by the partisans in Dongo, captured while he was trying to make his way to Switzerland.

May is credited with pioneering techno music in the 1980s along with collaborators Juan Atkins and Kevin Saunderson, commonly known as the Belleville Three. Biography Early life May is an only child born to a single mother in Detroit. May began to explore electronic music early in his life. At age 13, Derrick May began attending Belleville High School, and became friends with Juan Atkins in 1981. After an altercation, May became friends with Saunderson.High tech soul. Dir. Gary Bredow.

Film. (26:39). Atkins taught May and Kevin Saunderson the essence of DJing as well, formed a trio, Deep Space Soundworks, collectively existing to present their favorite music at parties and clubs. In an interview with a French magazine, May explained that people used to laugh at the ideas that they were entertained by Kraftwerk and disco sounds, we did our thing and continued to believe in ourselves, regardless. During high school, Saunderson and Belleville High School classmate Juan Atkins were fans of DJ Charles \\"The Electrifying Mojo\\" Johnson. When their careers took off, the three young men opened their three individual record labels, Metroplex belonging to Juan Atkins, KMS and Inner City for Kevin Saunderson and Transmat/Fragil all on Gratiot Ave, in Detroit's Eastern Market, this was known as Techno Alley. May is very much a Detroit Techno Rebel who does not accept oppression as Alvin Toffler noted, \\"providing the soundtrack to an alternative future‚Äîwhere the people reclaimed technology for the benefit of the community.\\" \\"See that is the problem, when people start doing what other people want them to do, they become completely programmed. We refused to be a part of that game.\\" Career When Derrick May was a teenager, he worked part-time in a video arcade. May's production career started in 1987 with the release of a record called \\"Nude Photo\\" (written by Thomas Barnett), which helped kickstart the Detroit techno music scene. A year later he followed this release with what was to become one of techno's classic anthems, the seminal track \\"Strings of Life\\", which was named by Frankie Knuckles. It \\"hit Britain in an especially big way during the country's 1987‚Äì1988 house explosion.\\" May's best known track, according to Frankie Knuckles, \\"just exploded. It was like something you can't imagine, the kind of power and energy people got off that record when it was first heard. Mike Dunn says he has no idea how people can accept a record that doesn't have a bassline.\\" The song was featured in video game Midnight Club: Street Racing. Opened in 1988, The Music Institute in Detroit was where they held their residency. May describes the place as a spiritual place for music. \\"We had a young beautiful black crowd and I mean beautiful in the sense of spirit mind and soul. We had white kids coming, Spanish kids coming, gay kids coming, straight kids coming.\\" Derrick was a mentor to many great artists. Among them, Carl Craig and Stacey Pullen have cited the difference between May's two labels as Transmat being fully devoted to original creation, whereas Fragile is where an artist can utilize more sampling, for a little creative push. May also ran a side-gig collective known as KAOS, a separate and lesser-known endeavor from Deep Space. May's Transmat Records label was the home of his best material, cuts like \\"Nude Photo,\\" \\"Strings of Life,\\" \\"Kaos\\" and \\"It Is What It Is,\\" most produced from 1987 to 1989 as Is . And though his release schedule all but halted during the 1990s, he continued DJing around the world and helping other artist to release their music honed Transmat into one of the most respected techno labels in the world. In Surreal Underground Entertainment 1993 America, Carl Craig said he \\"doesn't want Americans to look back at the music and think of it as a down point in history. The majority of American artists sent their musical efforts to Europe because it is more accepted by a wider audience.\\" In the documentary about the Detroit techno scene, High Tech Soul, May notes that he saw people in Italy wearing Underground Resistance shirts and was surprised at the group's success outside of Detroit. He says, \\"People were going crazy over Underground Resistance, and it was like they weren't even there.\\" Recently, May produced the music for the film of the popular fighting video game Tekken. For two years, in 2003 and 2004, he was given control of Detroit's popular annual electronic music festival. Originally conceived by Carl Craig, Derrick May, produced for 2 years. He named his event Movement, replacing the Detroit Electronic Music Festival along the Detroit city riverfront. Derrick May claims Carole Marvin stole the idea of festival from himself and Carl Craig. Her actions created a rift in the electronic music community in the talking a self-righteous stance, by firing Carl Craig. In 2004, Kevin Saunderson and Ade' Mainor produced the Festival of Sound Electronically and International Nurtured, in short: Fuse-In for 1 year in 2005. As of 2019, the Detroit Electronic Festival is operated by Paxahau. Derrick May also still maintains a steady performance schedule, playing internationally many weekends. A pioneer of techno, he produces what he calls Hi-Tek Soul or \\"George Clinton meeting Kraftwerk in an elevator.\\" He has also cited Yellow Magic Orchestra, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Ultravox as influences.

It was broadcast between 1990 and 1993 on the BBC (although there had earlier been a pilot episode in 1988). The show was set in the house of an aristocratic family in the 1920s, contrasting the upper-class family and their servants in a house in London, along the same lines as the popular drama Upstairs, Downstairs. The series featured many actors who had also appeared in their earlier series, notably Paul Shane, Jeffrey Holland and Su Pollard, all of whom had previously been Hi-de-Hi!; also featured were Donald Hewlett and Michael Knowles from It Ain't Half Hot Mum, and Bill Pertwee and‚Äîoccasionally‚ÄîFrank Williams from Dad's Army. Numerous small parts were played by other alumni of David Croft and/or Jimmy Perry shows. The memorable 1920s-style theme tune was sung by Bob Monkhouse. Episodes of You Rang M'Lord? were fifty minutes long, rather than the usual thirty (for BBC sitcoms), and attempted to introduce a more reflective approach and more complex plotting than other Croft and Perry series. There was also less reliance on filmed location sequences. Production The series, in common with all situation comedies of its time, was filmed in front of a live studio audience. Mark Lewisohn notes that the writers were careful to ensure that the sets, lighting and camerawork were of a quality more normally associated with drama productions such as Upstairs, Downstairs.Mark Lewisohn, You Rang, M'Lord at the former BBC Guide to Comedy For a situation comedy, the episodes are an unconventional length (50 minutes). The 50 minute duration was Croft's idea, as he felt this would give them the opportunity to develop characters and situations more thoroughly. This was supported by Gareth Gwenlan, head of BBC comedy.Gary Basford, You Rang M'Lord? at perryandcroft.co.uk Also unconventional for a Perry/Croft series was the fact that plots directly continued from episode to episode like a soap opera as opposed to being largely standalone episodes such as in Dad's Army, It Ain't Half Hot Mum, etc. This, coupled with high production values and attention to period detail, gives the series the feel of a comedy drama. In writing the series, the two writers drew on research and personal accounts from the period; Jimmy Perry's grandfather had been in service as a butler and David Croft's mother, Anne Croft, had been a musical comedy star in the 1920s, giving them some ideas of life both above and below stairs. The pilot episode was due to be recorded at the BBC Television Centre in London, but due to a strike the original sets were very sparsely dressed and production was moved to the BBC Elstree Studios instead. The sets were subsequently improved for the first series. After the pilot was aired and the BBC agreed to a full series, the production team decided to remain at BBC Elstree Studios, and all four series of the show were recorded there. Exterior shots were mostly filmed in and around Diss, Norfolk, for example a disused brush factory which was used as the Union Jack Rubber Company. Other locations include the seafront at Cromer, Lynford Hall and Oxburgh Hall as the bishop's palace. The 1st World War battle scene at the beginning of the pilot episode was built in Long Valley, the British Army's tank training ground in Aldershot. The exterior of the Meldrum house is rarely seen, although the pilot featured exterior shots of an actual building, most probably No. 15, Holland Villas Road, London W14, but later shootings took place at a mockup built on the car park at BBC Elstree Studios or location in Norfolk. The first two series were directed by David Croft who then handed over directing duties to Roy Gould, his Production Manager for many years, for series three and four. The series' opening and closing music was written by Jimmy Perry and Roy Moore and performed by an authentic 1920s-style orchestra.You Rang M'Lord theme tune The vocals were performed by Bob Monkhouse and Paul Shane. Plot In the pilot episode, two World War I soldiers stumble across the body of an officer while crossing no-man's land under heavy gunfire during the Battle of Amiens in 1918. Assuming the officer is dead, one soldier, Alf Stokes, attempts to rob the officer, much to the disgust of his comrade, James Twelvetrees. After it becomes apparent that the unconscious officer is not dead, the two men see their chance to escape the battle by carrying the officer to a field hospital. The two soldiers are later called to see the officer, The Honourable Teddy Meldrum, who says he is eternally grateful for their services, and tells them he will always be in their debt. The action then cuts to London in 1927, where James Twelvetrees has become the footman in the house of Lord Meldrum (brother of Teddy), at 12 Park Lane, Mayfair, and wants to further his position following the death of the butler.The street name is mentioned once in Series 1, Episode 5: \\"Fair Shares\\". In order to establish a telephone connection, the switchboard operator asks the number of the Meldrum residence. Meanwhile, Alf Stokes and Ivy, his daughter, have just been sacked from their jobsIn the 1988 Pilot Episode, Alf is erroneously handed a modern ¬£10 note as goodbye wages, a fortune in 1927. In later episodes, old fashioned banknotes and prices are used. in a music hall (Alf took the music hall job after being dismissed for dishonesty as a butler). Alf sees his chance to apply for a job at the Meldrum's house, and after blackmailing his previous employer for references, becomes the new butler, much to the annoyance of James. Following the dismissal of a maid, after a backstairs relationship with the Honourable Teddy, Ivy is brought in by her father as the new maid (to hide the fact that she is Alf's daughter, the two decide that Ivy should use her mother's maiden name, Teasdale). The programme follows the various relationships between the upper-class and their servants, as well as Alf's scheming and James's attempts to stop him. The events depicted in the 26 episodes are time-lined though not directly following each other and are based mainly around the following threads: * Moral combat between Alf, James and Ivy, as Alf keeps developing schemes in order to achieve some fortune (and usually fails) and James and Ivy try to stop his actions; *Clashes about politics between James and Alf (James is a Conservative voter whilst Alf often talks of class struggle and revolution). * Adultery triangle between Lord Meldrum, Lady Agatha and Sir Ralph; * James arousing romantic interest in Poppy, Lady Agatha, and Ivy. * Developing love affair between Alf and Mrs Lipton the cook, and between Mrs Lipton and Police Constable Wilson; * Efforts of Teddy to dodge the marriage with Madge Cartwright; * Teddy's pursuit of servant girls; * Lord Meldrum's threats to deport Teddy to his rubber plantation in British Malaya; * Ivy's growing affections for James; * Business rise, fall and recovery of the House of Meldrum and its most important asset, the Union Jack Rubber Company; * The unpredictable actions of Lady Lavender. Characters The Meldrum Family *George, Lord Meldrum MC (Donald Hewlett) ‚Äì The master of the house, Lord Meldrum is a respected member of the aristocracy, in charge of the Union Jack Rubber Company and various other interests. Old-fashioned, with Victorian values, his reputation is nevertheless threatened by his affair with Lady Agatha, the wife of Sir Ralph Shawcross, and it is usually left to Stokes to help him cover this up. He claims to deeply love Agatha, and is left heartbroken after she breaks off their affair. Despite his considerable wealth, he pays his workers poorly, and it is hinted that he once employed slave labour in Africa. *The Honourable Edward \\"Teddy\\" Meldrum (Michael Knowles) ‚Äì Lord Meldrum's younger brother, he had been conscripted as a Captain into the British Army in 1915 and had served in the Infantry on the Western Front, where he was badly injured by a shell and carried back to the field hospital by Stokes and Twelvetrees. By 1927 the Honourable Teddy is still unmarried and living in his brother's house. The stereotypical upper- class twit, he has had relationships with five previous housemaids and has fathered children by them all: he cannot resist their \\"shiny, scrubbed faces\\" and scent of carbolic soap. He is being forced by his brother to marry Madge Cartwright, the heiress to a soap dynasty, although he is more interested in her maid, Rose. *Cecily \\"Cissy\\" Meldrum (Catherine Rabett) ‚Äì Cissy is Lord Meldrum's elder daughter. Although attractive, she dresses in a masculine style, takes part in men's sports and activities, such as flying (she is a qualified pilot), and her feminine \\"chum\\" Penelope (Sorel Johnson) is a frequent house guest. Thus, although never explicitly stated, there are many suggestions that Cissy is a lesbian, the many clues to which are not entirely obvious to her father.You Rang M'Lord?, Jeffrey Holland official website Cissy is a pleasant character, who shows genuine concern for the family and servants alike, often giving away feminine items such as dresses and make-up to Ivy (whom she shows an attraction to in early episodes, frequently winking at her). She often socialises with her younger sister Poppy, but the two regularly bicker because of their differing attitudes. She proclaims herself a socialist and stands as a candidate for the United Workers Party, winning a seat on the council through Stokes's machinations. *Poppy Meldrum (Susie Brann) ‚Äì Poppy is Lord Meldrum's younger daughter and is a spoiled and unpleasant character who attends 'wild' parties with her friend, Jerry (John D. Collins). She is quite a snob about her position in society, often ready to remind those lower of her position, although at other times she confesses to feeling trapped by her class. Throughout the series, she is attracted to the footman, James Twelvetrees, whom she delights in leading on, despite being aware of the problems it could cause for him. She has an on-off relationship with Jerry, who she abandons when she meets Dickie Metcalf, who is in fact a confidence trickster and is after her money. *Lady Lavender Southwick (Mavis Pugh) ‚Äì Lady Lavender is Lord Meldrum's mother-in-law and she resides with her parrot, Captain, in the second bedroom of the house. She is very wealthy and has interests in many businesses including a large number of shares in the Union Jack Rubber Company. Lavender was born into an aristocratic family in the early 1850s, we are given to understand that she led a somewhat promiscuous youth, having many affairs, including with Boris the Crown Prince (later King) of Dalmatia (Davy Kaye). She then became involved with a young army officer called Captain Cedric Dolby (Maurice Denham), the two later became engaged, but separated shortly before he was sent off to fight in the Zulu war. After the death of her husband, Lord Southwick, Lady Lavender moved in with her daughter and son-in-law, becoming increasingly reclusive and senile, and enjoyed throwing plates of food at Ivy, the maid. Due to her confusion she gets people's names wrong (calling Ivy 'Ethel', Henry 'Steven' and Stokes 'Capes'). She has no idea who Teddy is (when he explains he is \\"George's brother\\" she comments she has a son-in-law with that name). Servants *Alf Stokes (Paul Shane) Butler ‚Äì Alf Stokes is the scheming Butler. He is Ivy's father and is still married to Ivy's mother, despite their separation. Alf was a Private in the British Army on the Western Front, along with James Twelvetrees. After coming across the Honourable Teddy unconscious in a shell hole, Alf, believing him to be dead, attempted to mug him, much to James' disgust. After realising Teddy was alive, Alf decided to carry the injured Teddy back to the field hospital as a way of saving his own life. This act secures him the job as Butler nine years later at Lord Meldrum's house, after he is forced to return to service following a failed career in showbiz after the war. Throughout the series, Alf devises a number of schemes to scam Lord Meldrum of his money and possessions, although these usually fail. This dishonest aspect of his character was often an asset to Lord Meldrum; on a number of occasions Alf was required to create diversions for Sir Ralph. Alf despises the Meldrum family due to their wealth and high position, although he has genuine respect for Cissy due to her empathy for the working class. Alf also has a relationship with Mrs Lipton through the series, although it is revealed he did this just to borrow money from her. *James Twelvetrees (Jeffrey Holland) Footman ‚Äì James Twelvetrees is the pompous Footman; the complete opposite of Alf Stokes ‚Äì stern, upright and honest. His act of helping Alf carry the injured Honourable Teddy to the field hospital during the war also secured him his job in the Meldrum household, although he would never admit this to the other servants. He is not always a likeable character, usually siding with his masters instead of his own class and was often quite unpleasant to the other servants and those he considered lower than him, particularly Mabel and Henry. He is also shown to have his own foibles, such as his infatuation with Miss Poppy, a relationship which left him contemplating resignation at times. He is desired by many of the upper class ladies he served and downstairs by Ivy; this was not reciprocated, although he did show a platonic fondness for her. He aspires to replace Stokes as butler. *Ivy Stokes/Teasdale (Su Pollard) Maid ‚Äì Ivy is the well-meaning but rather naive maid, the daughter of Alf. Her father secured her the job as maid after he was appointed as Butler by forging her references. Her familial relationship with Alf is largely a secret, but she is forced to tell Henry when he spots the two alone in her bedroom, and later tells James when she needs his help to get Alf out of trouble. Despite her honesty, she is often persuaded to take part in her father's schemes. Earlier in the series, she has to avoid the advances of the Honourable Teddy, although this ceases after series 1. (By season 2 Teddy has started pursuing a relationship with a servant girl called Rose and apologises to Ivy). She is passionately in love with James Twelvetrees, who does not reciprocate her affection. *Mrs Blanche Lipton (Brenda Cowling) Cook ‚Äì Blanche Lipton had joined the Meldrum household as a young housemaid in her teens and had gradually risen through the ranks to become cook. Her culinary skills are legendary on the street; she is rarely seen out of the kitchen. While usually a kindly woman who shows sympathy for her betters and equals, at other times she is particularly scathing towards those she considers lower, such as Henry and Mabel. Throughout the series she has a relationship with Alf; at one point the two are engaged. When she discovers that Alf was faking the relationship just to borrow money from her, she snaps and throws all the dinner plates and crockery at him. After this incident, Blanche then shifts her affections to Constable Wilson. *Henry Livingstone (Perry Benson) Bootboy ‚Äì Henry was abandoned as a child in a basket on the steps of the Livingston Road Orphanage, in which institution he remained until the age of 14, when he was taken into the Meldrum house as bootboy. Although the second-lowest ranking servant in the house, Henry is often the most insightful character, something which usually gets him into trouble; for not conforming to the expected etiquette and making inappropriate comments, he is usually soundly clipped about the ear. He is a good friend of Ivy, and it is often suggested that he would like a relationship with her. *Mabel Wheeler (Barbara New) Charwoman ‚Äì Mabel is the lowest-ranking servant in the Meldrum household. She does not live at the Meldrum house and resides with her unemployed husband in a poor part of London. She is regarded by some of the others as an outsider, James and Mrs Lipton in particular. Because of her low rank and social status, she is not allowed to have meals with the other servants, and is usually given some scraps to take home, which gave rise to her catchphrases \\"That'll be nice(!)\\" and \\"I can't remember the last time I had a...\\". Other Characters - Regular *Constable Wilson (Bill Pertwee) ‚Äì Police Constable Wilson is the local Bobby, although he rarely appears to be doing his duty. Instead he dines nightly with the servants, as was apparently the custom because the police would then overlook any indiscretion made by the family. He is generally ineffective as a policeman, although he becomes something of a wine connoisseur, due to his nightly selection from Lord Meldrum's cellar. Other Characters - Recurring *Sir Ralph Shawcross (John Horsley) ‚Äì Sir Ralph is another wealthy member of London society, with two residences; a London house and a country residence. He is married to Lady Agatha (her third husband) and is initially suspicious of Lord Meldrum's relationship with his wife, but eventually comes to regard him as a friend after he is led to believe that Meldrum is impotent and therefore not a threat. When the truth is revealed, he seeks revenge on Meldrum. *Lady Agatha Shawcross (Angela Scoular) ‚Äì Lady Agatha is the wife of Sir Ralph and is also Lord Meldrum's mistress. She conducts her affair with Lord Meldrum even when her husband is present in the house by secretly giving him sleeping pills. She had previously been assistant matron at Eton but had been sacked following an incident with a number of students. She had two previous husbands before she married Sir Ralph, but also had plenty of lovers, whom she entertains at her mews apartment. *Madge Cartwright (Yvonne Marsh) ‚Äì The sole heiress to the Cartwright Soap business empire, she resides in a luxury flat in Mayfair and is a regular visitor to the house. She is a longtime admirer of Teddy, and the two become engaged. She does not realise that Teddy secretly despises her and is instead infatuated with her maid, Rose (Amanda Bellamy). *Charles, the Lord Bishop (Frank Williams) ‚Äì Charles is the Lord Bishop, and a close friend of the family. He is a frequent visitor at the Meldrum house, often accompanied by his young chaplain, Robin (Robbie Barnett). Other characters As with the main cast, a number of other characters were played by actors who have appeared in Perry/Croft series, including Felix Bowness, Kenneth Connor, Stuart McGugan, John D. Collins and Ivor Roberts. Episodes Reception and release Co-writers David Croft and Jimmy Perry during a Dad's Army event at Bressingham Steam Museum, May 2011. The series was not initially well received by the critics, and is less well-known than other Croft sitcoms, such as Dad's Army, It Ain't Half Hot Mum, Hi-de-Hi!, 'Allo 'Allo! and Are You Being Served? (the latter two of these were co-written by Croft with Jeremy Lloyd). Reviewing the series ten years later, Mark Lewisohn notes that unlike previous Croft/Perry series, the lead characters were not \\"loveable\\", stating: > ...in fact, Alf was quite menacing and James was just too snobbish and > unbending a character to generate a response from the audience. This > combination of production values and darker characterisation seemed to work > against the series, and the normally loud and broad humour of such ensemble > romps was uncomfortable in the surroundings. While far from a ratings > disaster, it nonetheless failed to attract the level of audiences normally > reached by Perry and Croft. Simon Morgan-Russell, Professor of English at Bowling Green State University is more complimentary, noting that \\"Unlike other Perry and Croft sitcoms, You Rang, M'Lord? has a distinct serial structure, though it is also the most stable example of their work in terms of maintaining the original situational concept and the cast\\".Simon Morgan-Russell, Jimmy Perry and David Croft (Manchester University Press, 2004), 128 He goes on to compliment the series' examination of class,Morgan-Russell, 137-140 sexuality and gender issues,Morgan-Russell, 145-6 as well as the heritage cinema-inspired period detail of the piece, particularly in its location filming.Morgan-Russell, 135-136 The series was the first British sitcom to feature a recurring lesbian character, in Cissy Meldrum.Nina Rapi and Maya Chowdhry, eds., Acts of Passion: Sexuality, Gender, and Performance, (Routledge, 1998) 162 The character has generated mixed reactions. Anthony Joseph Paul Cortese's Opposing Hate Speech suggests that Cissy is \\"the archetypal stereotype for a lesbian...[using]...non-flattering stereotypes\\".Anthony Joseph Paul Cortese, Opposing Hate Speech (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006) p.207 Alison Darren's Lesbian Film Guide is much more positive, stating \\"You Rang, M'Lord? gave us the wonderful Cissy (...replete with monacle and a series of beautifully tailored suits).\\" She goes on to note the character's \\"championing of the workers\\" suggesting that throughout her character \\"behaved with integrity and style.\\"Alison Darren, Lesbian Film Guide(Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000), 2 The BBC Comedy Guide criticises the show: \\"for most of their career Perry and Croft had turned clich√©s on their heads and created characters that went beyond normal. The research and interest they showed in the 20s setting and 'getting it right' in You Rang... seems to have made them forget to put many laughs in.\\" You Rang, M'Lord? has rarely been repeated on television, which Croft believed was probably due to its unusual length, which does not suit current broadcasting slots (his other series such as Dad's Army and 'Allo, 'Allo are 30 minutes in duration). However, all four series have been released on DVD, both individually and as a box set. The show has acquired a major following in Hungary where a version dubbed into Hungarian became popular following the fall of Communism in the country. A fan club has nearly 23,000 followers and in 2018, a celebratory banquet was held in Budapest attended by actors Jeffrey Holland, Michael Knowles, Catherine Rabett, Susie Brann and Amanda Bellamy to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the pilot episode. The show started a complete re-run on 3 April 2018 on UKTV's Drama channel in the afternoon Comedy Slot, and also shortly thereafter on GOLD.You Rang M'Lord?, Su Pollard official website In addition, all four series are available individually along with a box set of the complete collection as digital downloads from the iTunes Store.

The Emergency Banking Act (EBA) (the official title of which was the Emergency Banking Relief Act), Public Law 73-1, 48 Stat. 1 (March 9, 1933), was an act passed by the United States Congress in March 1933 in an attempt to stabilize the banking system. Beginning on February 14, 1933, Michigan, an industrial state that had been hit particularly hard by the Great Depression in the United States, declared an eight-day bank holiday. Fears of other bank closures spread from state to state as people rushed to withdraw their deposits while they still could do so. Within weeks, all other states held their own bank holidays in an attempt to stem the bank runs, with Delaware becoming the 48th and last state to close its banks March 4.  Bank holiday  Following his inauguration on March 4, 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt set out to rebuild confidence in the nation's banking system. On March 6 he declared a four-day national banking holiday that kept all banks shut until Congress could act.  Passage of the Emergency Banking Act  A draft law, prepared by the Treasury staff during Herbert Hoover's administration, was passed on March 9, 1933. The new law allowed the twelve Federal Reserve Banks to issue additional currency on good assets so that banks that reopened would be able to meet every legitimate call. The Emergency Banking Act, an amendment to the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, was introduced on March 9, 1933, to a joint session of Congress, and was passed the same evening amid an atmosphere of chaos and uncertainty as over 100 new Democratic members of Congress swept into power determined to take radical steps to address banking failures and other economic malaise. The EBA was one of President Roosevelt's first projects in the first 100 days of his presidency. The sense of urgency was such that the act was passed with only a single copy available on the floor of the House of Representatives and legislators voted on it after the bill was read aloud to them by Chairman of the House Banking Committee Henry Steagall. Copies were made available to senators as the bill was being proposed in the Senate, after it had passed in the House. According to William L. Silber: \\"The Emergency Banking Act of 1933, passed by Congress on March 9, 1933, three days after FDR declared a nationwide bank holiday, combined with the Federal Reserve's commitment to supply unlimited amounts of currency to reopened banks, created 100 percent deposit insurance.  Public reaction  Much to everyone's relief, when the institutions reopened for business on March 13, 1933, depositors stood in line to return their stashed cash to neighborhood banks. Within two weeks, Americans had redeposited more than half of the currency that they had squirreled away before the bank suspension. The stock market registered its approval as well. On March 15, 1933, the first day of stock trading after the extended closure of Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 8.26 points to close at 62.10; a gain of 15.34%. , the gain still stands as the largest one-day percentage price increase ever. With the benefit of hindsight, the nationwide Bank Holiday and the Emergency Banking Act of March, 1933, ended the bank runs that had plagued the Great Depression.\\"  Hoarding gold becomes a crime  One month later, on April 5, 1933, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102 criminalizing the possession of monetary gold by any individual, partnership, association or corporation and Congress passed a similar resolution in June 1933.Gold Repeal Joint Resolution, 48 Stat. 112, Chapter 48, H.J.Res. 192, enacted June 5, 1933  1933 Banking Act  This act was a temporary response to a major problem. The 1933 Banking Act passed later that year presented elements of longer-term response, including formation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

His best known works are British television themes and scores, most notably the main themes for The Saint and Danger Man. He was also successfully diversified into symphonic pop and the arrangement of his theme to The Saint, which reached number three in the UK Singles Chart, whereas re-recorded by Orbital. Personal life and family Astley was born in Warrington, Lancashire to Lawrence Astley and Mary Alice Pester. He served in the Second World War as a musician in the Royal Army Service Corps band playing saxophone and clarinet for the troops. Astley married Hazel Balbirnie in 1945. Their eldest daughter Karen Astley married Pete Townshend of The Who, and their son Jon Astley produced and remastered The Who's reissues. Daughter Virginia Astley is a singer-songwriter.His other children are Virginia's twin Alison, and son Gareth. Career In the early 1950s, Astley was arranging for Geraldo. His song \\"I Could Never Tell\\" was written by Edwin and Billy Bowen as an entry into a song writing contest when they were both serving in the army. Edwin won the prize of ¬£250 and later used this money to pay for his wedding to Hazel Balbirnie. \\"I Could Never Tell\\" was later recorded by both Vera Lynn and Richard Tauber. His own band, the Ted Astley Orchestra, became well known in the north of England, and he wrote songs for performers such as Anne Shelton. He wrote music for many British television series of the 1950s and 1960s, including incidental music for The Champions, and the opening titles to The Adventures of Robin Hood (with the exception for the closing titles), Danger Man (known as Secret Agent in North America, where High Wire was replaced by the song Secret Agent Man), Department S, Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased), The Saint, Gideon's Way and The Baron. Most of these programmes are made by ITC Entertainment. Astley also wrote the orchestral and \\"opera\\" score for the Hammer Films version of The Phantom Of The Opera (1962). Astley wrote two arrangements of his own theme for The Saint, a slow version used in the black and white episodes and a more up-tempo arrangement of the same theme for the colour episodes. He then wrote a second theme, used in the second season of the colour episodes, based around Leslie Charteris' own theme music, which had previously been used in films and on radio. Charteris' theme would also open its main theme to Return of the Saint and would close its theme for its TV movies of The Saint which starred Simon Dutton (neither of which were composed by Astley); however, Astley's original Saint theme was chosen for the film of the same name. Astley also wrote two themes for Danger Man  one for the 30-minute series transmitted from 1960 to 1962 entitled \\"The Danger Man Theme\\", and a new theme for the 60 minute series (1964‚Äì68) entitled \\"High Wire\\". Astley was asked to write music for The Prisoner, but had to withdraw because he felt that he would be unable to create Patrick McGoohan's vision for the score  due to McGoohan being too busy to hold meetings with him. However, Astley showed his diversity by writing the music for Sir Kenneth Clark's BBC documentary series Civilisation (1969), and scoring several British Transport Films including Diesel Train Ride (1959), Broad Waterways (1959/60) and The Signal Engineers (1962). In 1997 Astley found himself at number five on the pop charts as composer of \\"The Saint\\", 33 years after he wrote it, which had been revived by Orbital for the new Saint movie. His last work was a 1998 symphonic interpretation of Who music called Who's Serious: The Symphonic Music of the Who, which followed 1995's Symphonic Music of the Rolling Stones. Recordings Astley's actual recorded output is quite sparse, consisting of a few singles and albums of the music from The Saint and Danger Man. These were only available in the United States until 1997 when he arranged for CDs to be issued in the UK, where the albums were expensive collectors' items. Other recordings included the soundtrack for International Detective, a few library records which were only semi-official and a series of albums made by the London Symphony Orchestra which featured his work. Recently the complete recordings of the score to Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) was released by Network DVD in the UK. The three disc box-set featured over two hundred recorded music cues from the series, and a book detailing the music production. In 1977, Astley wrote the orchestral score for Street in the City, a song contained in the Pete Townshend and Ronnie Lane's album Rough Mix. Death and legacy Astley retired in the late 1970s, and died in 1998. Although Astley's themes had introduced a number of highly popular television shows, recognition of his death was limited to brief obituaries in The Times and The Independent. However, tributes later appeared on television and in print. In 2001 Jools Holland presented a television tribute called Astley's Way. Holland had recorded the Danger Man theme earlier, and he appeared with Jools Holland's Rhythm and Blues Orchestra to play \\"High Wire\\", plus various other themes and incidental music composed by Astley. The documentary also included interviews with his widow, son Jon, daughter Virginia and son-in-law Pete Townshend. The Autumn 2005 edition of Action TV provided a twelve-page feature on Astley, including an interview, photos, a discography and a filmography.

It is a subgenre of the Beat 'em up genre which focuses on melee combat usually with fists. The term \\"hack and slash\\" was originally used to describe a play style in tabletop role-playing games, carrying over from there to MUDs, MMORPGs, and role-playing video games. In arcade- and console-style action video games, the term has a different usage, specifically implying a focus on real-time combat with hand-to-hand weapons as opposed to guns or fists. Types of games that employ hack and slash Role-playing games The term \\"hack and slash\\" has its roots in \\"pen and paper\\" RPGs such as Dungeons & Dragons, denoting campaigns of violence with no other plot elements or significant goal. The term itself dates at least as far back as 1980, as shown in a Dragon article by Jean Wells and Kim Mohan which includes the following statement: \\"There is great potential for more than hacking and slashing in D&D; or AD&D; there is the possibility of intrigue, mystery and romance involving both sexes, to the benefit of all characters in a campaign.\\" Role-playing video games Hack and slash made the transition from the tabletop to role-playing video games, usually starting in D&D-like; worlds.

From a long line of parish priests, Fisher was educated at Marlborough College and Exeter College, Oxford. He achieved high academic honours but was not interested in a university career. He was ordained priest in 1913, and taught at Marlborough for three years; in 1914, aged 27, he was appointed headmaster of Repton School where he served for 18 years. In 1932, having left Repton, he was made Bishop of Chester. In 1939 he accepted the post of Bishop of London, the third most senior post in the Church of England. His term of office began shortly after the start of the Second World War, and his organising skills were required to keep the diocese functioning despite the devastation of the London Blitz. In 1944, the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple died suddenly, and Fisher was chosen to succeed him. He served from 1945 to 1961. One of the main themes of his time in office was church unity. He worked continually to build bridges to other Christian churches, and in 1960 became the first Archbishop of Canterbury to meet a Pope since the English Reformation, more than four centuries earlier. He overhauled the administration of the Church of England, strengthened international ties with other Anglican churches, and spoke out on a range of topical issues, from divorce to homosexuality, and the Suez crisis to nuclear disarmament. Theologically, Fisher was nearer the Evangelical wing of the Church than the Anglo-Catholic, but strongly believed that neither had a monopoly of religious truth. His predecessor and his successor at Canterbury ‚Äì Temple and Michael Ramsey ‚Äì were known for scholarly spirituality; Fisher was distinguished by a simple faith combined with outstanding organisational flair. In 1961 he retired from Canterbury and for the first time in his life became a parish priest, serving as honorary curate of a country parish in Dorset. He died in 1972, aged 85. Life and career Early years rectory, Higham on the Hill Fisher was born at the rectory, Higham on the Hill, Leicestershire, youngest of the ten children of the Rev Henry Fisher and his wife Katherine, n√©e Richmond.Chandler and Hein, p. 10 A Fisher had served as rector of Higham since 1772: Henry Fisher's father and grandfather had preceded him; his eldest son, Legh, later held the post. After a short time in the Higham village school Fisher was sent to Lindley Lodge, a local preparatory school and in September 1901, having gained a scholarship, he entered Marlborough College, a public school in Wiltshire. He was greatly influenced by the headmaster, Frank Fletcher, an inspiring teacher, under whose guidance he did well both academically and in sport.Webster, Alan. \\"Fisher, Geoffrey Francis, Baron Fisher of Lambeth\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 5 December 2019 From Marlborough, Fisher won a scholarship to Exeter College, Oxford, going up in October 1906. The college had a strong Anglican tradition with both the low church evangelical and high church Anglo-Catholic wings represented. Fisher, though temperamentally inclined to the former, felt that both had much to offer. He disapproved of those in either camp who believed they had a monopoly of the truth.Hein, p. 6 He rowed and played rugby for the college and distinguished himself academically, leaving with a triple first. After completing his studies, Fisher declined two offers of lecturerships in theology from Oxford colleges. Although intellectually able he was not of an academic turn of mind. In the words of his biographer David Hein, \\"scholars must be intellectually imaginative and also persistently dissatisfied, even sceptical, in a way that Fisher never was\\". He said that he did not want \\"to go on asking questions to which there is no answer\\".Quoted in Chandler and Hein, p. 14 He accepted an invitation from Fletcher to return to Marlborough as a member of the teaching staff, remaining there for three years, during which time he went to Wells Theological College during the long summer vacation in 1911, and was ordained deacon in 1912, and priest in 1913. Repton In 1914 William Temple, the headmaster of Repton School, was appointed rector of the prominent parish of St James's, Piccadilly in London. Both he and Fletcher encouraged Fisher to apply for the vacancy at Repton; the application was successful and Fisher took up the headmastership in June 1914, at the age of 27.Hein, pp. 7‚Äì8 Repton School Within two months of his appointment Fisher was confronted by problems arising from the outbreak of the First World War. Six of his teaching staff volunteered for the armed forces, as did sixty of the senior boys. As well as coping with a reduced staff and apprehension and restlessness among the pupils, Fisher had to deal with the mixed legacy he had inherited from his predecessor. Although Temple was described as \\"religiously inspiring and intellectually stimulating\\",Hein, p. 8 he was no disciplinarian or organiser. Fisher was characterised by The Times as combining \\"generous humanity and a completely unaffected manner with a passion for order and efficiency\\".\\"Lord Fisher of Lambeth\\", The Times, 16 September 1972, p. 14 Fisher was in charge of Repton for 18 years, during which he improved the facilities, instilled firm discipline and modernised the curriculum. His biographer Alan Webster writes: Among Fisher's pupils at Repton were Stuart Hampshire and Roald Dahl, both of whom complained that his personally administered beatings had been cruel.Chandler and Hein, p. 17 Other pupils admired \\"his combination of extreme competence, lack of self-concern, and genial humour\\" (Webster). While at Repton, Fisher met Rosamond Chevallier Forman, who was the daughter of a former master at Repton and a granddaughter of S. A. Pears, a famous headmaster of the school. They were married on 12 April 1917; they had six children, all sons. Webster writes that the marriage was lifelong and mutually supportive. By the early 1930s Fisher felt that it was time to move on, and was hoping for an appointment as a parish priest, preferably in a rural parish.Chandler and Hein, p. 23 Bishop of Chester alt=interior of large Gothic church Temple had watched his successor's progress at Repton, and once again intervened to further Fisher's career. Temple, by now Archbishop of York, commended Fisher to Cosmo Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Lang was impressed enough to put Fisher's name on the short list (of two candidates) when the see of Chester became vacant on the retirement of Luke Paget. At the time, bishops were appointed by the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister. Ramsay MacDonald recommended Fisher to King George V; the appointment was approved, and on 21 September 1932 Temple consecrated Fisher bishop in York Minster, and the following week Fisher was enthroned as Bishop of Chester at Chester Cathedral.\\"Ecclesiastical News\\", The Times, 22 September 1932, p. 13 It was unusual for a bishop to be appointed without having any experience as a parish priest, and Fisher had to overcome reservations about him on that score from some of the clergy in his diocese.Hein, p. 18 Webster writes that Fisher and his wife proved to be exceptionally hard-working, but the lack of previous pastoral experience showed: Fisher became an advocate for rationalisation in many aspects of church life. He pointed out the discrepancies in the remuneration of the clergy, with some of them extremely poorly paid; he drew attention to the lack of a consistent appointment system; he intervened to save the Church Training College in Chester from threatened closure; strengthened the financial administration of the diocese; and campaigned for financial support of church schools, overseas missions and the widows of clergy.Hein, p. 18 He was at the forefront of the Industrial Christian Fellowship Mission, and his commitment often took him to the slums of Birkenhead. In Webster's summary, \\"He was a confident bishop, never doubting the natural and pastoral role of the established church or experiencing the post-1900 questionings in philosophy and theology. He had no hesitations over his own faith\\". Bishop of London In 1939 Arthur Winnington-Ingram, the long-serving Bishop of London, retired, aged 81. During his 38-year tenure the diocese was riven by factions and came close to disintegrating.Chandler and Hein, p. 25 It was clear that Winnington-Ingram's successor must be a man with a strong hand; Fisher was seen as one such, and Lang favoured his appointment. But although Fisher's record as an organiser and disciplinarian was well known, his theological views were not, and the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, sought reassurance from Lang that Fisher was doctrinally sound. The archbishop told Chamberlain that Fisher was \\"undoubtedly a man of deep personal religion. His piety is that of the best type of English layman ‚Ä¶ he is very shy and humble about it (very English)\\".Quoted in Chandler and Hein, p. 26 Chamberlain was reassured, and recommended to George VI that Fisher should succeed Winnington- Ingram.Chandler and Hein, p. 26 The King approved the appointment, but Fisher hesitated when offered it. He saw the great difficulties the turbulent diocese presented, and doubted his ability to unite it. After much private prayer, and reassurance from colleagues, he accepted and was enthroned as Bishop of London in St Paul's Cathedral in November 1939.Chandler and Hein, pp. 26‚Äì27\\"Bishop of London Enthroned\\", The Times, 4 November 1939, p. 3 Wartime bombing hit London churches severely The Second World War had broken out shortly before Fisher took up his London post, and from September 1940 the city suffered nightly bombing. Twenty-three Wren City churches were bombed by 1941, some beyond repair. Urgent action was needed to deal with devastated parishes. Fisher took the lead in the church assembly and in the House of Lords and the resulting measure was largely his work. Webster writes that Fisher showed courtesy, skill, and determination in \\"defeating ultra-conservative attitudes which would have prevented any episcopal intervention even in severely blitzed areas\\". Fisher, in the words of The Times, went about his duties \\"with a calm diligence which won general respect\\" and returned each night to sleep in the cellar at Fulham Palace. The war and the leadership of Temple ‚Äì who succeeded Lang at Canterbury in 1942 ‚Äì had begun to improve relations between the various Christian churches ‚Äì Anglican, Roman Catholic and noncomformist. Though firmly Protestant in his views Fisher strongly supported this and acted as chairman of the joint committee in which the Anglican and Free Church \\"Religion and Life\\" movement cooperated with the Roman Catholic \\"Sword of the Spirit\\" led by Cardinal Hinsley, in the cause of \\"moral regeneration and social reform\\". Fisher was frustrated by the refusal of some Roman Catholics to say even the Lord's Prayer with Protestants. Hinsley's death in 1943 was another blow to inter-church co-operation; his successor was opposed to it. Another only partial success for Fisher was his attempt to regulate the variety of forms of worship in London churches. The diocese had a tradition of High Church ritualism, and clerical dissent from the provisions of the Book of Common Prayer. Fisher sought to pursue the principle of apostolic authority to bring all parishes in the diocese back into conformity, but the matter was not resolved when he ceased to be Bishop of London in 1945. Archbishop of Canterbury Cyril Garbett, Fisher's counterpart as Archbishop of York In October 1944 Archbishop Temple died suddenly. Cyril Garbett, the Archbishop of York, was nearly 70 and declined to succeed him at Canterbury. Many in the church hoped that the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, would appoint another reform-minded idealist such as George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester, but Churchill chose Fisher. Temple had hoped Fisher would be his successor, valuing his precision and administrative skill. Garbett, too, approved; he and Fisher were close personal friends.Carpenter, p. 237 In his view Canterbury needed \\"a dynamic presence for some years, not a caretaker\\", and he welcomed working with Fisher.Chandler and Hein, p. lviii Nonetheless, after Churchill lost the 1945 general election, the Church was left, in Webster's words, with \\"a reforming Labour government\\" but \\"a conservative, headmasterly archbishop who, though warm-hearted, was determined to maintain the protestant establishment\\". According to The Times, Garbett and Fisher cooperated in the government of the Church in an unusually close manner made possible by strong mutual regard. \\"Garbett had a wider knowledge of social matters and was more at home than Fisher in the disputed territory which lies between religion and politics. Fisher was happy to have his hands free for the task of refurbishing the administrative structure of the Church\\". His obituarist in The Guardian wrote, \\"It was a grim and testing moment for any man to take up the highest position in the whole of the Anglican communion. He at once rose to it, partly by his clear self-knowledge that he was no Temple and must never try to become one.\\"\\"Lord Fisher of Lambeth\\", The Guardian, 16 September 1972, p. 7 Canon law Fisher put considerable effort into revising the Church of England's canon law. The canons of 1604 were still nominally in force, despite being substantially out of date.Chandler and Hein, p. lxii His efforts provoked bitter controversy. In 1946 he preached a university sermon at Cambridge on the theme that communion between the Church of England and the Free Churches was possible and should be pursued. His enthusiastic support for the World Council of Churches and his blessing of the new Church of South India, an Anglican and Free Church coalition, were viewed with hostility by some Anglo- Catholics. They suspected Fisher of fostering pan-Protestantism, and the force with which he criticised the exclusiveness of the Church of Rome added to their resistance. They regarded his detailed and painstaking revision of canon law with similar suspicion. The Times summed up: Fisher also met resistance from liberals in the church, who regarded his canon law reforms as unduly bureaucratic and calculated to institute a regime of \\"prosecutions and petty persecutions\\". The reforms were eventually accepted, but it took many years: they were not formally adopted until 1969, under Fisher's successor, Michael Ramsey.Chandler and Hein, p. 45 Marriages, coronation and divorces Fisher (front) at the Coronation of Elizabeth II, 1953. Behind him, from l.: Lord Simonds (Lord Chancellor), Lord Cholmondeley (Lord Great Chamberlain), Lord Alanbrooke (Lord High Constable of England) and the Duke of Norfolk (Earl Marshal) Fisher officiated at the marriage of Princess Elizabeth in Westminster Abbey in 1947, and after her accession to the throne he led the coronation service in 1953, and crowned her as Queen. Shortly afterwards he was drawn into a controversy when the Queen's younger sister, Princess Margaret, was romantically linked with Peter Townsend, a divorced man. The Church of England regarded marriage as a lifelong commitment and divorc√©s or divorc√©es could not remarry in church. The princess decided not to marry Townsend, and although she stated that her decision had been made \\"entirely alone\\", mindful of the Church's teaching on the indissolubility of marriage, it was rumoured that Fisher had influenced her in taking a course widely regretted among the British public. The Prime Minister's son, Randolph Churchill, commented that the rumour \\"has done incalculable harm to the Church of England\\".Sumner Holmes, pp. 78‚Äì79 One of Fisher's aims during his 16 years as archbishop was to make the position of the Church about the marriage of divorced people widely understood and accepted. He staunchly upheld the rules that would have prevented Princess Margaret and Townsend from marrying in church, but in the words of The Guardian, he \\"combin[ed] that undoubted rigour with a profound compassion for all those whose lives had been ... wrecked by a disastrous marriage. That road lay over a knife-edge of perplexity and contradiction, but he trod it creatively.\\" Church unity and administration For Fisher, the most important initiative of his archiepiscopate was to advance the cause of Christian unity. Strengthening ties did not necessarily mean converging theologically. To Fisher, better relations grew out of free communication and mutual respect.Chandler and Hein, p. 49 In his speech at Cambridge in 1946 he urged full communion between the episcopal and non-episcopal churches, in which there were no barriers to exchanges of ministers and ministries.\\"'Full Communion' Between the Churches: Archbishop of Canterbury's Suggestion\\", The Manchester Guardian, 4 November 1946, p. 3 His efforts led to the prospect of union with the Methodists, and his visit to Rome in 1960 to meet Pope John XXIII. The Guardian reported that Fisher was received in the Vatican \\"not as a bishop on pilgrimage but as the Father in God of the entire Anglican Communion\\"; the visit marked the end of centuries of hostility between Canterbury and Rome. Parallel with his quest for inter-church Christian unity was Fisher's concern to strengthen the community between the various international Churches within the Anglican Communion. Partly because of the enforced separation caused by the Second World War, worldwide Anglican ties had become weak. Fisher began in 1946 with a visit to Canada and the United States, during which he established or strengthened links between the English and the North American episcopates. After that he travelled continually to almost every part of the Anglican Communion, establishing that principle that \\"an Archbishop of Canterbury must be peripatetic\\" globally. He arranged for the Anglican Communion to have a chief executive officer, the first of whom was Bishop Stephen Bayne of the US. As he had at Chester, as Archbishop of Canterbury Fisher concerned himself with modernising the administration of the Church. According to The Guardian, \\"His incessant pleas to relieve the poverty of the clergy were heard, and it was in his time that the Church Commissioners shook themselves free from their old obligation to invest only in trustee securities ‚Äì a stroke which relieved many a vicarage from grinding poverty\\". Later years as archbishop Fisher blessing the new Archbishop of East Africa, upright=1.5 In 1956 Garbett, Fisher's friend and confidant, retired; the new Archbishop of York was Michael Ramsey. He had been a pupil under Fisher at Repton, and in the words of a biographer, Fisher \\"still played the headmaster\\" to Ramsey even after he became an archbishop.Dales, p. 142 Ramsey was described by The Times as \\"a theologian in, but not quite of, the world of high-powered ecclesiastical committees\\".Longley, Clifford. \\"Dr Ramsey: always the theologian\\", The Times, 15 November 1974, p. 18 Without Garbett's skill in political matters, Fisher began to make incautious and sometimes controversial pronouncements. Matters were exacerbated by his suspicion of the British press, and his dislike was frequently reciprocated, causing Fisher to receive hostile press coverage on occasion. He spoke frequently in the House of Lords. In 1957 he gave a cautious welcome to the Wolfenden report (1957) which advocated decriminalising homosexual practices, saying there was \\"a realm which is not the law's business; a sacred area of privacy where people make their own choices and decisions into which the law must not intrude\\".Carpenter, p. 393 He also welcomed the decision of the Lambeth Conference in favour of family planning: \\"It is utterly wrong to urge that unless children are specifically desired, sexual intercourse is of the nature of sin\\". He clashed with the Conservative governments of Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan over the Suez crisis of 1956 and Macmillan's introduction of premium bonds (which Fisher called \\"squalid\\") and his assertion that Britain had \\"never had it so good\\". In 1958, at a time of heightened fear of nuclear war and mutual destruction between the West and the Soviet Union, Fisher said that he was \\"convinced that it is never right to settle any policy simply out of fear of the consequences. For all I know it is within the providence of God that the human race should destroy itself in this manner.\\" He was also quoted as saying, \\"The very worst the Bomb can do is to sweep a vast number of people from this world into the next into which they must all go anyway\\".Logue, Christopher. \\"One quick push for paradise\\", The Guardian, 28 August 1999 He was heavily criticised in the press for this view, but a number of clergy, including Christopher Chavasse, Bishop of Rochester, defended him, saying, \\"In an evil world, war can be the lesser of the two evils.\\"\\"Religion: The Atom & the Archbishop\\", Time, 28 July 1958. Fisher tried to influence the choice of his successor. He preferred the evangelical Donald Coggan, Bishop of Bradford, to the more obvious choice, Ramsey. To Fisher, the latter was too much a party man ‚Äì too closely allied with the Anglo-Catholic wing of the church.Hein, p. 105 Macmillan, with whom Fisher got on least well of the four prime ministers with whom he had to deal during his time in office, was not swayed by his arguments.Chandler and Hein, pp. 114‚Äì115 Several versions exist of the exchange between archbishop and premier, all to the effect that Fisher said that as Ramsey's former headmaster he did not consider him suitable, to which Macmillan is said to have replied that Fisher may have been Ramsey's headmaster but had never been his, and that he would make up his own mind.\\"A quiet word about the next archbishop\\", The Church Times, 8 January 2009; \\"Headmasterly\\", The Times, 23 March 2012; and Hennessy, p. 250 Fisher retired on 17 January 1961; Ramsey succeeded him. Retirement Fisher was made a life peer, with the title of Baron Fisher of Lambeth, of Lambeth in the County of London. He and his wife settled at Trent rectory, near Sherborne, in Dorset, where he served as an honorary assistant priest. Webster describes him as \\"a warm-hearted country parson, getting to know everyone in the village and playing chess with some of the boys\\". In retirement he bombarded his successor with \\"critical and sometimes harsh comments\\" (Webster). Ramsey, though hurt, contented himself with observing, \\"The trouble with Geoffrey is that he could not get episcopacy out of his system\\". Fisher died on 15 September 1972 and was buried in the churchyard at Trent on 20 September. A memorial service, led by Ramsey, was held in Canterbury Cathedral on the same day as Fisher's interment at Trent. Ramsey concluded his eulogy, \\"Today Christians of every tradition, Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Anglican, Protestant, salute the memory of a leader and a friend\\".\\"Last tributes paid to Lord Fisher\\", The Times, 21 September 1972, p. 16 A memorial to Fisher was erected in the chapel of St Gregory in Canterbury Cathedral. Honours As well as being created a life peer, Fisher received the Royal Victorian Chain in 1949. and was made Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in 1953. He received honorary degrees from Cambridge, Columbia, Pennsylvania and Princeton (all 1946), London (1948), Manchester (1950), Edinburgh (1953), Yale (1954), British Columbia (1954), Northwestern University, Evanston (1954), General Theological Seminary, New York (1957), Trinity College, Dublin (1961), and Assumption University of Windsor, Ontario (1962). He was prelate of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (1946‚Äì1967). He was made a freeman of the cities of London and Canterbury (1952) and of Croydon (1961).

Edward Leedskalnin () (January 12, 1887 ‚Äì December 7, 1951) was a Latvian emigrant to the United States and self-taught engineer who single-handedly built the Coral Castle in Florida, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.Coral Castle, National Register of Historic Places Information System ID: 84000840 Leedskalnin was also known for developing theories of magnetism. Life Edward Leedskalnin was born on January 12, 1887 in StƒÅmeriena Parish, Latvia. Little is known of his childhood, aside from the fact that his parents were not wealthy and he received only a fourth-grade formal education. Edward was a sickly boy who often spent time reading books, helping him to develop an inquisitive mind and life-long yearning for knowledge. It was suggested that he learned stonemasonry from his father and practiced this craft in Latvia after coming of age. At the age of 26 he was engaged to marry Agnes Skuvst who was ten years younger.Historians from Latvia provide different name and age ‚Äî Hermƒ´ne L≈´se, two years younger than Edward. MƒÅris Goldmanis, Researcher at University of Latvia. Edward Leedskalnin and his Coral Castle in Florida, Latvian History, January 11, 2014. However, the girl who Leedskalnin later referred to as his \\"Sweet Sixteen\\" broke their engagement. He then decided to emigrate to North America. On April 7, 1912 Leedskalnin arrived in New York City. After looking for suitable work around the East Coast until August, he relocated to the Pacific Northwest, which was experiencing a logging boom. On June 5, 1917 while in Oregon he filled in his draft registration stating that he was self-employed and engaged in ax-handle manufacturing. The 1920 census data reveal that he resided in Reedsport, Oregon. In the winter of 1922‚Äì1923, after allegedly contracting tuberculosis, Leedskalnin moved to the warmer climate of Florida, where he purchased an undeveloped parcel of land in Florida City, which at the time was lightly inhabited. On February 27, 1923 The Homestead Enterprise newspaper published a notice that \\"E. Leedskalnin a Californian has purchased an acre of the R. L. Moser homestead and is planning to erect a home soon.\\" Over the next 20 years, Leedskalnin constructed a massive structure that he called \\"Rock Gate\\" and dedicated, in his own words, to the girl who had left him years before. Working alone and mostly at night, Leedskalnin eventually quarried and sculpted more than 1,100 short tons (997,903 kg) of oolite limestone into architectural and engineering landmark that would later be known as the Coral Castle.The Coral Castle. In Ellison, Emily and Perry, Chuck. Liars And Legends: The Weirdest, Strangest, And Most Interesting Stories and People From The South. Nashville, Tennessee: Rutledge Hill Press, 2005. He used various basic tools available under his modest means including salvaged timber and old automobile parts. First, he built a house out of limestone blocks and wood, then he gradually constructed the stone structure for which he is now famous. With a reserved personality, he eventually opened the Coral Castle to the public, offering tours for 10 cents. When people were asking Leedskalnin how he had moved all of the heavy stone on his own, he usually replied, \\"I understand the laws of weight and leverage and I know the secrets of the people who built the pyramids\\", referring to the Great pyramid at Giza, Egypt.Sidonie Sawyer. The Love Castle - a Weird Miami Landmark, The Huffington Post, May 27, 2014. Some local residents later remembered that as school children they had field trips to the construction site of the future Coral Castle, and Leedskalnin personally explained manual methods of his work. In the 1920s, the structure with assortment of sculpted stones was located in Florida City; then, in the mid-1930s, Leedskalnin hired a truck with a driver to move it to its present location on a site in the adjacent Homestead, Florida. Leedskalnin was an eccentric and lived on an exclusive diet of only crackers and sardines.Shaw, Karl. (2004). Book of Oddballs and Eccentrics. Book Sales. p. 354 In his later years, he starved himself.Pickover, Clifford A. (1998). Strange Brains and Genius: The Secret Lives of Eccentric Scientists and Madmen. Plenum Trade. p. 794 On November 9, 1951 he checked himself into Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. Apparently, Leedskalnin suffered a stroke either before he left for the hospital or at the hospital. He died twenty-eight days later of pyelonephritis (kidney infection) at the age of 64. His death certificate noted that his death was a result of \\"uremia; failure of kidneys, as a result of the infection and abscess.\\" Publications Leedskalnin published five pamphlets on various subjects, advertising them in local newspapers. Magnetic Current was first published in 1988 and the only source for any of these pamphlets is the Coral Castle gift shop. Moral education His first and longest booklet, a treatise on moral education, is printed on only the left-hand pages, and begins with the following preface: In the first section, Leedskalnin argues that girls should be kept pure, and that boys are primarily a soiling influence upon them. On page 4 of A Book in Every Home, Leedskalnin writes: The second section continues along the theme of moral education, with several aphorisms aimed at parents regarding the proper way to raise children. The last, \\"Political\\" section, reveals that the reclusive Leedskalnin had strong political views. He advocates voting for property owners only (and in proportion to their holdings), and argues that \\"Anyone who is too weak to make his own living is not strong enough to vote.\\" Some writers have suggested that Leedskalnin's booklet contains further information on his electromagnetic research and philosophies encoded in its pages, and the blank pages are provided for the reader to fill in their decrypted solutions. It has also been suggested that Leedskalnin's frequent referral to his \\"Sweet Sixteen\\" may in fact refer to the numerological and/or scientific relevance of the number sixteen to his research and theories. He wrote that a mother's most important task is to ensure that her daughter remains \\"chaste and faithful\\": Magnetism Leedskalnin became interested in the general theory of magnetism.Edward Leedskalnin. Magnetic Current. Homestead, Florida, Rock Gate, 1945. His four pamphlets addressed interaction of electricity, magnetism and the body; Leedskalnin also included a number of simple experiments to validate his theories. Contradicting the standard model of electromagnetism, but remarkably in line with the concept of 'magnetic moment' / 'electron spin theory', his thesis is based upon the theory that the metal itself is not the magnet and that the real magnets are circulating in the metal. These individual north and south pole magnets are particles smaller than atoms or photons and each particle in the substance was an individual magnet by itself.Matt Emery. Double helical magnetic interaction, Leedskalnin.com: Magnetic Current Research Leedskalnin claimed that all matter was being acted upon by what he called \\"individual magnets\\". He also claimed that scientists of his time were looking in the wrong place for their understanding of electricity and that they were observing only \\"one half of the whole concept\\" with \\"one sided tools of measurement\\".

He served as the 100th Archbishop of Canterbury. He was appointed on 31 May 1961 and held the office until 1974, having previously been appointed Bishop of Durham in 1952 and the Archbishop of York in 1956. He was known as a theologian, educator, and advocate of Christian unity.\\"Michael Ramsey, Baron Ramsey of Canterbury\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Britannica Academic (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2016. Web). Early life Ramsey was born in Cambridge, England in 1904. His parents were Arthur Stanley Ramsey (1867‚Äì1954) and Mary Agnes Ramsey n√©e Wilson (1875‚Äì1927); his father was a Congregationalist and mathematician and his mother was a socialist and suffragette. He was educated at King's College School, Cambridge, Repton School (where the headmaster was a future Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Francis Fisher) and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where his father was president of the college. At university he was president of the Cambridge Union Society and his support for the Liberal Party won him praise from H. H. Asquith. Ramsey's elder brother, Frank P. Ramsey (1903‚Äì1930), was a mathematician and philosopher (of atheist convictions).\\"A Field Guide to the English Clergy' Butler-Gallie, F p103: London, Oneworld Publications, 2018 He was something of a prodigy who, when only 19, translated Wittgenstein's Tractatus into English. During his time in Cambridge, Ramsey came under the influence of the Anglo-Catholic dean of Corpus Christi College, Edwyn Clement Hoskyns. On the advice of Eric Milner- White he trained at Cuddesdon, where he became friends with Austin Farrer and was introduced to Orthodox Christian ideas by Derwas Chitty.Alec R. Vidler, Scenes From a Clerical Life: an Autobiography (Collins, 1977), 102. He graduated in 1927 with a First-class degree in Theology. Ordained ministry Ramsey was ordained in 1928 and became a curate in Liverpool, where he was influenced by Charles Raven. After this he became a lecturer to ordination candidates at the Bishop's Hostel in Lincoln. During this time he published a book, The Gospel and the Catholic Church (1936). He then ministered at St Botolph's Church, Boston and at St Bene't's Church, Cambridge, before being offered a canonry at Durham Cathedral and the Van Mildert Chair of Divinity in the Department of Theology at Durham University. After this, in 1950, he became the Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge, but left to become a bishop after only a short time in office. Ramsey married Joan A. C. Hamilton (1910‚Äì1995) at Durham in the early summer of 1942.Marriages Jun 1942. freebmd.org.uk Episcopal ministry In 1952, he was appointed Bishop of Durham. He was consecrated a bishop by Cyril Garbett, Archbishop of York, at York Minster on Michaelmas (29 September) that year (by which his election to the See of Durham must have already been confirmed). In 1956 he became Archbishop of York and, in 1961, Archbishop of Canterbury.Douglas Dales, editor, Glory Descending: Michael Ramsey and His Writings, (Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2005), xxii. During his time as archbishop he travelled widely and saw the creation of the General Synod. Retirement ages for clergy were cut from 75 to 70. Theology and churchmanship In a lecture on Ramsey, John Macquarrie asked, ‚Äúwhat kind of theologian was he?‚Äù and answered that ‚Äúhe was thoroughly Anglican.‚Äù Macquarrie explained that Ramsey's theology is (1) ‚Äúbased on the scriptures‚Äù, (2) the church's ‚Äútradition‚Äù, and (3) ‚Äúreason and conscience‚Äù. Ramsey held to the Anglo-Catholic tradition, but he appreciated other points of view. This was especially true after he became a bishop who ministered to diverse Anglicans. As an Anglo-Catholic with a nonconformist background, Ramsey had a broad religious outlook. He had a particular regard for the Eastern Orthodox concept of \\"glory\\", and his favourite book he had written was his 1949 work The Transfiguration. Ramsey's first reaction to J. A. T. Robinson's Honest to God (1963) was hostile. However, he soon published a short response entitled Image Old and New, in which he engaged seriously with Robinson's ideas. Conscious always of the atheism which his short-lived brother Frank had espoused, he maintained a lifelong respect for honest unbelief, and considered that such unbelief would not automatically be a barrier to salvation. Acting on his respect for beliefs other than his, Ramsey made a barefoot visit to the grave of Mahatma Gandhi.Peter John Moses, History Guide Book: Archbishops of Canterbury (Evangelical Bible College of Western Australia, 2009), 47‚Äì48. Although he disagreed with a lot of Karl Barth's thinking, his relations with him were warm. Following observations of a religious mission at Cambridge, he had an early dislike of evangelists and mass rallies, which he feared relied too much on emotion. This led him to be critical of Billy Graham, although the two later became friends and Ramsey even took to the stage at a Graham rally in Rio de Janeiro. One of his later books, The Charismatic Christ (1973), engaged with the charismatic movement. Ramsey believed there was no decisive theological argument against women priests, although he was not entirely comfortable with this development. The first women priests in the Anglican Communion were ordained during his time as Archbishop of Canterbury. In retirement he received communion from a woman priest in the United States. Ecumenical activities Ramsey was active in the ecumenical movement, and while Archbishop of Canterbury in 1966 he met Pope Paul VI in Rome, where the Pope presented him with the episcopal (bishop's) ring he had worn as Archbishop of Milan.John L. Allen Jr. (10 October 2003) No Nobel of John Paul; Catholics, Anglicans determined to keep talking; An interview with Cardinal Theodore McCarrick; Personnel changes in the curia. National Catholic Reporter The two prelates issued ‚ÄúThe Common Declaration by Pope Paul VI and the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Michael Ramsey‚Äù. In it they said that their meeting ‚Äúmarks a new stage in the development of fraternal relations, based upon Christian charity, and of sincere efforts to remove the causes of conflict and to re-establish unity.‚Äù Ramsey preached at the Roman Catholic St Patrick's Cathedral in New York City in 1972. It was the first time that a leader of the Anglican Communion had done so. However, while fostering ties with the Roman Catholic Church, Ramsey criticised the Pope's 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae against birth control. These warm relations with Rome caused Ramsey to be dogged by protests by fundamentalist Protestants, particularly Ian Paisley. Ramsey encouraged efforts to promote closer relations between Anglicans and Orthodox. He enjoyed friendship with the Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople, Athenagoras, and Alexius, Patriarch of Moscow. As Archbishop of Canterbury, Ramsey served as president of the World Council of Churches (1961‚Äì68). However, he opposed the granting of aid money by the World Council of Churches to guerrilla groups. Ramsey's willingness to talk to officially sanctioned churches in the Eastern Bloc led to criticisms from Richard Wurmbrand. He also supported efforts to unite the Church of England with the Methodist Church and was disappointed when the plans fell through. Politics Before entering the clergy, Michael Ramsey had participated in the Liberal Party. In 1925, Ramsey traveled with the debate club and spoke at multiple venues in the United States. Upon his return, he heard a Liberal Party leader, Lord Hugh Cecil remark that the Church was the place to go for those who wanted to help people, and Ramsey heard that as his vocation from God. He had sympathies with liberal politics for the rest of his life and admired H. H. Asquith. He became close friends with party leader Jeremy Thorpe. Ramsey and his wife Joan were godparents of Thorpe's son Rupert, whom Ramsey baptized in 1969, and Ramsey officiated at Thorpe's second marriage to Marion Stein. Both Ramsey and Thorpe had lost family members to car collisions: Ramsey's mother in 1927 and Thorpe's first wife Caroline in 1970. Ramsey disliked the power of the government over the church. \\"Establishment has never been one of my enthusiasms,\\" he said, and \\"he was not at ease with the royal family.\\" He supported the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the 1960s, which brought him enemies in the House of Lords. In 1965, \\"he outraged right-wingers when he declared that under certain circumstances, there would be Christian justice in using British troops to overthrow the white-minority regime [of Ian Smith] in Rhodesia.\\" He also called the Vietnam War a \\"futility\\". Regarding Africa, Ramsey opposed curbs on immigration to the UK of Kenyan Asians, which he saw as a betrayal by Britain of a promise. He was against apartheid, and he left an account of a very frosty encounter with John Vorster. In 1970, Ramsey attacked apartheid, saying that it was \\"being increased by more ruthless actions‚Äù and describing it as an \\"abuse of power at the expense of others\\". He was also a critic of the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. Later life Michael Ramsey in 1974 After retiring as Archbishop of Canterbury on 15 November 1974 he was created a life peer, as Baron Ramsey of Canterbury, of Canterbury in Kent, enabling him to remain in the House of Lords where he had previously sat as one of the Lords Spiritual. Although retired, Ramsey remained active, \\"a fact reflected in his writing of four books and numerous additional undertakings\\". He went to live first at Cuddesdon, where he did not settle particularly well, then for a number of years in Durham, where he was regularly seen in the cathedral and talking to students. But the hills were rather steep for him and he and Lady Ramsey accepted the offer of a flat at Bishopthorpe in York by his successor John Habgood. They stayed there just over a year, moving finally to St John's Home, attached to the All Saints' Sisters in Cowley, Oxford, where he died in April 1988. During his retirement, he also spent several terms at Nashotah House, an Anglo-Catholic seminary of the Episcopal Church in Wisconsin where he was much beloved by students. A first-floor flat was designated \\"Lambeth West\\" for his personal use. A stained-glass window in the Chapel, bears his image and the same inscription as is on the memorial near his grave. The window (placed in the chapel by the class of 1976 who were among his first students at Nashotah) also includes a miniature image of the Bishop and his wife Joan. Ramsey Hall at Nashotah House was named in his honor, and is a residence for students and families. The Board of Directors of Nashotah House also presents, from time to time, the Michael Ramsey award for distinguished mission or ecumenical service in the Anglican Communion. Ramsey's funeral was held in Canterbury Cathedral on 3 May. He was cremated and his ashes buried in the cloister garden at the cathedral, not far from the grave of William Temple. His wife's ashes were also buried there. On the memorial stone are inscribed words from St Irenaeus: \\"The Glory of God is the living man; And the life of man is the vision of God.\\" A side chapel at Canterbury Cathedral was subsequently dedicated to Ramsey's memory, situated next to a similar memorial chapel to Archbishop Geoffrey Fisher. Ramsey had no children. Lady Ramsey died on 17 February 1995 and was buried alongside her husband. Legacy During his life, ‚ÄúRamsey was a Life Peer and received innumerable honors. He was an honorary fellow of Magdalene College and Selwyn College, Cambridge, and of Merton College, Keble College, and St Cross College, Oxford. He was honorary master of the bench, Inner Temple (1962); trustee of the British Museum (1963‚Äì1969); and honorary Fellow of the British Academy (1983). He held honorary degrees from Durham, Leeds, Edinburgh, Cambridge, Hull, Manchester, London, Oxford, Kent, and Keele and from a number of overseas universities.‚Äù Regarding Ramsey's long-term legacy, a professor at Lincoln College, University of Oxford holds that ‚Äúthere is much more historical and theoretical work to be done before Ramsey‚Äôs legacy can be properly ascertained.‚ÄùDr Sam Brewitt-Taylor, review of Archbishop Ramsey: The Shape of the Church, (review no. 1884) DOI: 10.14296/RiH/2014/1884 Date accessed: 17 March 2016. Ramsey's name has been given to Ramsey House, a residence of St Chad's College, University of Durham. He was a Fellow and Governor of the college (resident for a period) and he regularly worshipped and presided at the college's daily Eucharist. A building is also named after him at Canterbury Christ Church University. A house at Tenison's School is named in his honour. He also gave his name to the former Archbishop Michael Ramsey Technology College (from September 2007 St Michael and All Angels Church of England Academy) in Farmers' Road, Camberwell, South East London.Welcome from the Executive Principal, St. Michael and All Angels Academy newsletter, August 2007 An annual Michael Ramsey Lecture on an appropriate theological topic is delivered at Little St Mary's, Cambridge in early November. Items found in River Wear In October 2009 it was reported by Maev Kennedy that two divers had found a number of gold and silver items in the River Wear in Durham which were subsequently discovered to have come from Ramsey's personal collection, including items presented to him from dignitaries around the world while he was Archbishop of Canterbury. It is unclear how they came to be in the river. The divers were licensed by the dean and chapter of the cathedral as the owners of the land around the stretch of the river where the items were found. The current legal ownership of the items is yet to be determined. The cathedral was planning an exhibition relating to Ramsey's life in 2010 and a new stained glass window dedicated to himMaev Kennedy (22 October 2009) Durham Cathedral divers discover gold and silver treasure trove in riverbed, The Guardian.

The two amateur divers, brothers Gary and Trevor Bankhead, found a total of 32 religious artefacts in the River Wear in Durham during a full underwater survey of the area around Prebends Bridge. The underwater survey commenced in April 2007 and took two and half years to complete. The finds were individually handed over to the resident archaeologist from Durham Cathedral to formally record where and when they were found.

A fixed rate bond is a long term debt paper that carries a predetermined interest rate. The interest rate is known as coupon rate and interest is payable at specified dates before bond maturity. Due to the fixed coupon, the market value of a fixed-rate bond is susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates, and therefore has a significant amount of interest rate risk. That being said, the fixed-rate bond, although a conservative investment, is highly susceptible to a loss in value due to inflation. The fixed-rate bond‚Äôs long maturity schedule and predetermined coupon rate offers an investor a solidified return, while leaving the individual exposed to a rise in the consumer price index and overall decrease in their purchasing power. The coupon rate attached to the fixed-rate bond is payable at specified dates before the bond reaches maturity; the coupon rate and the fixed-payments are delivered periodically to the investor at a percentage rate of the bond‚Äôs face value. Due to a fixed- rate bond‚Äôs lengthy maturity date, these payments are typically small and as stated before are not tied into interest rates. Difference between fixed- and floating-rate bonds Unlike a fixed-rate bond, a floating rate note is a type of bond that contains a variable coupon that is equal to a money market reference rate, or a federal funds rate plus a specified spread. Although the spread remains constant, the majority of floating rate notes contains quarterly coupons that pay-out interest every 3 months with variable percentage returns. At the beginning of each coupon period, the rate is calculated by adding the spread with the reference rate. This structure differs from the fixed-bond rate which locks in a coupon rate and delivers it to the holder semi-annually over a course of multiple years. Early redemption Some fixed rate bonds allow for the issuer to repay the principal amount earlier than the contractual repayment date, sometimes on payment of a specified penalty or \\"make whole\\" payment. The provisions specifying such a penalty are known (particularly in the UK) as a spens clause.

He was described as the greatest lawyer of his generation. Baroness Hale of Richmond observed that his pioneering role in the formation of the United Kingdom Supreme Court may be his most important and long-lasting legacy.Mads Andenas and Duncan Fairgrieve, Tom Bingham and the Transformation of the Law (2009) p 209. Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers regarded Bingham as 'one of the two great legal figures of my lifetime in the law'.Mads Andenas and Duncan Fairgrieve, Tom Bingham and the Transformation of the Law (2009) xlvii. Lord Hope remembered Bingham as 'the greatest jurist of our time'. After retiring from the judiciary in 2008, Bingham focused on teaching and lecturing in human rights law. His book, The Rule of Law, was published in 2010 and posthumously won the 2011 Orwell Prize for Literature. The British Institute of International and Comparative Law named the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law in his honour. Early life Bingham was born at Marylebone in London. His parents, Thomas Henry Bingham (1901‚Äì1981) and Catherine (n√©e Watterson; 1903‚Äì1989), practised as doctors in Reigate, Surrey. His father was born in Belfast; his mother was from California before being raised on the Isle of Man. He was educated at The Hawthorns prep school at Bletchingley, Surrey, where he was Head Boy, and then from 1947 the Cumbrian public school Sedbergh School (Winder House), where he was described as the \\"brightest boy in 100 years\\". He enjoyed history, took up fell-walking, and developed a strong attachment to the Church of England; he was a Head of House and a School Prefect. He won an open scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, first undertaking National Service from 1952 to 1954, as a second lieutenant in the Royal Ulster Rifles serving in Hong Kong. He enjoyed his time in the Army and considered pursuing a military career before opting to serve in the Territorial Army for the next five years. He went up to Oxford in 1954 and initially read Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, but after two terms switched to History. He was awarded one of the first Coolidge Pathfinder Awards and spent the summer of 1955 in the US. He entered Gray's Inn during his second year at Oxford, with a view to becoming a barrister. He was elected President of Balliol Junior Common Room in his third year. He won the Gibbs Prize for Modern History in 1957, and was awarded first-class honours in finals. He also tried, unsuccessfully, for fellowship by examination at All Souls College. After graduation, he read for the Bar as Eldon Law Scholar and achieved a Certificate of Honour, coming top of Bar finals in 1959. In 1963 he married Elizabeth Loxley, a Somerville graduate whose great-uncle was Major Gerald Loxley, of the Loxley family of Northcott Court, Hertfordshire; they had one daughter Catherine Elizabeth (born 1965), and two sons Thomas Henry (Harry, born 1967) and Christopher Toby (Kit, born 1969). Their only daughter, Kate Bingham, has been married to Conservative member of parliament Jesse Norman since 1992.Profile: Dr Jesse Norman MP, Jessenorman.com; accessed 28 March 2016. In 1965 Bingham and his wife Elizabeth acquired a cottage at Cornhill, near Boughrood in Powys; he died there in 2010. Early career Bingham was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn, and was a pupil barrister under Judge Owen Stable QC in the chambers of Leslie Scarman at 2 Crown Office Row, which later moved to Fountain Court Chambers: within a few months, he was invited to become a tenant at the chambers. He took silk in 1972, becoming Queen's Counsel aged just 38 and the youngest that year, having served as Standing Counsel at the Department of Employment for four years from 1968. He was Counsel to the judicial inquiry into an explosion at a chemical plant at Flixborough in 1974 which killed 28 people. In 1977, when still at the Bar, he rose to public attention when he was appointed by the then-Foreign Secretary Dr. David Owen to head a public enquiry into alleged breaches of UN sanctions by oil companies in Rhodesia. He was appointed a Recorder in 1975, and became a Bencher of Gray's Inn in 1978. He was promoted High Court Judge of the Queen‚Äôs Bench Division in April 1980, aged 46, and assigned to the Commercial Court, receiving the customary knighthood. He was further promoted to the Court of Appeal in 1986, joining the Privy Council. In 1991 he led a high-profile inquiry into the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI). Senior judicial career The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in London whose creation Bingham advocated before his retirement in 2008 Bingham succeeded Lord Donaldson as Master of the Rolls in 1992 and initiated significant reforms, including a move towards the replacement of certain oral hearings in major civil law cases. He was one of the first senior judges to give public support to incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into English law, which ultimately came about with the passing of the Human Rights Act 1998. Despite being less experienced in criminal law, Bingham was appointed Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales in 1996, following Lord Taylor. In England and Wales, he was the highest-ranking judge in regular courtroom service; he was personally responsible for adding \\"and Wales\\" to the office's title. He was created a Life Peer as Baron Bingham of Cornhill, of Boughrood in the County of Powys, on 4 June 1996, enabling him to serve on the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords. He continued as Lord Chief Justice until 2000, when he was appointed Senior Law Lord. This position had customarily been held by the longest-serving Law Lord, but the then-Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine, took the view that a more dynamic leader was required. Bingham was followed in the office of Lord Chief Justice by Lord Woolf, who had succeeded him as Master of the Rolls in 1996. Bingham was a strong advocate for divorcing the judicial branch of the House of Lords from its legislative functions by setting up a new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, which was accomplished under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. The title of the office he held was redesignated as \\"President of the Supreme Court\\" upon that court's establishment in October 2009, after Bingham had retired in July 2008. He is understood to have been \\"very sorry\\" not to serve as its inaugural president. Bingham oversaw an increasing workload of constitutional affairs after Scottish devolution, and human rights matters after the Human Rights Act came into force, and assembled the first nine-judge panels for important cases since 1910, including the Belmarsh Case in December 2004 which reviewed the regime for indefinite detention of foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who could not be deported due to the risk of torture in their home countries, holding that the regimes might breach the Human Rights Act. He was one of two Law Lords to dissent against the decision to overturn the High Court and Court of Appeal verdicts to quash an Order-in-Council, dismissing all impediments to the rights of the Chagos Islanders to return home. Bingham also presided over various decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council upholding the finding that death penalties in Belize, St Lucia, St Kitts and the Bahamas were unconstitutional. Honours Bingham was awarded the degree of Doctor of Civil Law honoris causa by the University of Oxford in 1994. From 2001 to 2008, Bingham held the office of High Steward of the University of Oxford, its second highest office in the academic hierarchy, and in 2003 he came second to Chris (now Lord) Patten in the election for Chancellor. Bingham served as the Visitor of Balliol College, Oxford from 1986 to 2010. Bingham served on the Advisory Council on Public Records, the Magna Carta Trust, and the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts. He was a Trustee of the Pilgrim Trust for 15 years and an Honorary Fellow of the British Academy from 2003. In 2005, he was advanced from Knight Bachelor to the Garter, an honour in the personal gift of the Sovereign and seldom bestowed upon judges, being installed as a Knight of the Garter with Lady Soames and Sir John Major. He also served as president and chairman of the British Institute of International and Comparative Law, which established in 2010 the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law in his honour. On Thursday, 16 November 2006, Bingham delivered the sixth annual Sir David Williams Lecture hosted by the Centre for Public Law at the Faculty of Law, University of Cambridge; this lecture was entitled \\"The Rule of Law\\". On 17 January 2008, Bingham presented the annual Hansard Lecture at the University of Southampton. On 14 March 2008, Bingham received the degree of Doctor of Jurisprudence honoris causa from the University of Rome III, after delivering the Lectio Magistralis at the Faculty of Law entitled \\"The Rule of Law\\". In 2009, Bingham became involved with Reprieve, a UK Charity,Reprieve (organisation) website, reprieve.org.uk, November 2008; accessed 29 March 2016. as well as delivering the fourth annual Jan Grodecki Lecture at the University of Leicester, entitled The House of Lords: Its Future.Jan Grodecki Lecture by Lord Bingham, le.ac.uk, 23 September 2009; accessed 29 March 2016. Retirement Bingham remained active in retirement. On 17 November 2008, in his first major speech since retiring as Senior Law Lord, Bingham, addressing the British Institute of International and Comparative Law, disputed the legality of the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries. He said that the invasion and occupation of Iraq was \\"a serious violation of international law\\", and he accused Britain and the US of acting like a \\"world vigilante\\". In June 2009, Bingham was interviewed by British legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg on the subject of the rule of law in international affairs, which was conducted to raise awareness of the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. Bingham's thoughts on this subject, in particular the banning of certain weapons in international conflict, were covered by newspapers The Independent (\\"Top judge: use of drones intolerable\\") and The Daily Telegraph (\\"Unmanned drones could be banned, says senior judge\\"). Bingham gave another interview concerning the rule of law and matters pertaining to the \\"British Constitution\\" with the charity, the Constitution Society.Constitution Society website, consoc.org.uk; accessed 28 March 2016. His book, The Rule of Law, was published by Allen Lane in 2010; it won the 2011 Orwell Prize for Literature.

He served as pilot on STS-33 and STS-29, was spacecraft Commander on STS-58 and STS-43, served on Mir 22 as Board Engineer 2, and was a Mission Specialist on STS-79 and STS-81. In addition to flying five space missions, Blaha has served as the Chairman, NASA Space Flight Safety Panel; Weather Manager, Mission Management Team; lead spacecraft communicator; member, NASA Space Shuttle Improvement Panel. Blaha also led the design, development, and integration of the Orbiter Head Up Display system. Additionally, he led the development of contingency abort procedures which significantly improve crew survivability in the event of multiple main engine failures during ascent. He has logged more than 7,000 hours of flying time in 34 different aircraft, and has written numerous technical articles on spacecraft performance and control. John Blaha retired from NASA in September 1997 to return to his hometown of San Antonio, Texas, where he joined the executive management team of the United Services Automobile Association. Space flights STS-29 Discovery launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on March 13, 1989, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base on March 18, 1989. During this successful mission the five-man crew aboard Shuttle Discovery deployed the East Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, and performed eight scientific/medical experiments. STS-33 Discovery (November 22‚Äì27, 1989). Launched at night, this five-day mission carried Department of Defense payloads and other secondary payloads. After 79 orbits of the Earth, this highly successful mission concluded with a hard surface landing on Runway 4 at Edwards Air Force Base, California. STS-43 Atlantis (August 2‚Äì11, 1991) launched from the Kennedy Space Center carrying a five-person crew. During the nine-day mission the crew deployed the West Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, and conducted 32 physical, material, and life science experiments that supported the development of the Extended Duration Orbiter and Space Station. After 142 orbits of the Earth, this very significant mission concluded with a landing on Runway 15 at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. STS-58 Columbia (October 18 to November 1, 1993) launched from the Kennedy Space Center carrying a seven-person crew. This record duration fourteen-day life science research mission has been recognized by NASA management as the most successful and efficient Spacelab flight that NASA has flown. The crew performed neurovestibular, cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and musculoskeletal medical experiments on themselves and 48 rats, expanding our knowledge of human and animal physiology both on Earth and in space flight. In addition, the crew performed 16 engineering tests aboard the Orbiter Columbia and 20 Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project experiments. Landing was at Edwards Air Force Base on Runway 22.

He is also a former National Football League (NFL) and United States Football League (USFL) executive and was later the principal owner of both the Iowa Barnstormers and the AF2's Quad City Steamwheelers. Biography Born and raised in Iowa City, Iowa, Foster graduated from the University of Iowa in 1972 with a BGS in Advertising/Marketing and Broadcast Journalism. While at Iowa, Foster lettered in track/cross country while also being a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon. He was the founder in 1974 and Managing Director of the Newton Nite Hawks minor league football team of the Northern States Football League. After winning the league championship in 1975 Foster organized and introduced the sport of American (pro level) football to Europe during a 5-game exhibition tour in June 1977 with the Nite Hawks and the Chicago Lions playing exhibition games in major European cities, including Paris, Frankfurt and Vienna. While Promotion Manager of NFL Properties, he invented the game of Arena football while watching the Major Indoor Soccer League All-Star game being played at Madison Square Garden on February 11, 1981. He drew out a diagram and rules on the back of a 9\\" x 12\\" manila envelope. Foster left the NFL in September 1982 to pursue a goal of managing a major professional football team with the Phoenix-based Arizona Wranglers during their inaugural 1983 season in the new USFL. After 1983 season ended, he accepted an offer to move back to the Midwest to serve as Executive Vice President for the restaging of the USFL Chicago Blitz under new ownership for the 1984 season. In the fall of 1985 after the USFL suspended operations to move from a spring season to a fall season on a head to head basis with the NFL, Foster soon after began working full-time on carefully testing and researching the mechanics and basic rules of the new game he had invented before actually launching the AFL, starting play in early June 1987. Foster served as founding President/Commissioner from 1985-1992, at which time he stepped down to begin the initial development of his own AFL team, the Iowa Barnstormers, which would bring professional football to his home state of Iowa for the first time, playing in the state's capitol and largest city, Des Moines. After staging a very successful and well received sold-out preseason, market test game on April 22, 1994, Foster then completed raising the required capital to fund and operate the team and launched operations in June to prepare for a 1995 inaugural season. He served as its Managing Owner through 2001, after which the team was then sold, with the AFL Barnstormers moving to Long Island in New York to become the New York Dragons. In 1999 Foster co- founded and helped organize the AFL's developmental league, af2, in addition to founding and organizing the Quad City Steamwheelers af2 team in 1999 and serving as Managing 0wner until 2006. The Steamwheelers won back to back af2 titles in 2000 and 2001, going undefeated in their inaugural season at 19‚Äì0. In 1990, thanks to a lengthy, successful effort by Chicago-based intellectual properties attorney, William Niro, Foster was granted a US patent on the game of arena football and the equipment unique to it, particularly the end zone Goalside Rebound Nets and padded Sideline Barriers, meaning that other indoor football leagues not affiliated with the AFL were legally required to play by at least somewhat different rules than the ones the AFL uses until the patent expired in September 2007. This primarily included no use of the Goalside/cross bar apparatus, as well as that no active usage of the Sideline Barriers could be incorporated into game playing rules. Additional patents were also secured for the arena football game system on an international basis, primarily in multiple European countries and also Mexico. (The league attempted to claim that numerous other properties of the game were covered under the patent, but a successful 1998 lawsuit from a competing upstart league narrowed the AFL's patent mainly to the Goalside/cross bar apparatus.) Foster and his family moved from Chicago to Des Moines in August 1994 and lived there from 1994-2002 while he operated the Iowa Barnstormers in the AFL through the 2000 season and then as an af2 team for the 2001 season. He also served on the Iowa State Historical Society Foundation board 1998‚Äì2002 while living in Des Moines. They moved to Davenport, IA in the fall of 2002 to oversee operations of the Steamwheelers on a full-time basis. Jim Foster was inducted into the American Football Association's Semi Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1982, The Arena Football League Hall of Fame Inaugural Class in 1998 and the af2, (arena football2 league) inaugural Hall of Fame class of 2009. Foster served is an Adjunct Professor in the Tippie College of Business, Pappajohn Entrepreneurial Center in Iowa City, teaching Pro Sports Management from 2011-2012, in addition to continuing his ongoing sports/events and marketing-related consulting projects work through Fostering Sports, Inc. in Davenport.

It is the largest Brazilian public university and the country's most prestigious educational institution, the best university in Ibero-America, and holds a high reputation among world universities, being ranked 100 worldwide in reputation by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. USP is involved in teaching, research and university extension in all areas of knowledge, offering a broad range of courses. The university was founded in 1934, regrouping already existing schools in the state of S√£o Paulo, such as the Faculdade de Direito do Largo de S√£o Francisco (Faculty of Law), the Escola Polit√©cnica (Engineering School) and the Escola Superior de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz (College of Agriculture). The university's foundation is marked by the creation in 1934 of the Faculdade de Filosofia, Ci√™ncias e Letras (Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters, 1934-1968), and has subsequently created new departments, becoming one of the largest institutions of higher education in Latin America, with approximately 90,000 enrolled students. Currently, it has eleven campuses, four of them in the city of S√£o Paulo. The remaining campuses are in the cities of Bauru, Lorena, Piracicaba, Pirassununga, Ribeir√£o Preto and two in S√£o Carlos. Several students from the University of S√£o Paulo have achieved important positions in Brazilian society. It was the alma mater of twelve Brazilian presidents. USP was ranked 19th worldwide in a rank based on the number of alumni who became CEOs in the world's 500 largest companies, and also classed in the top 100 worldwide in the Global Employability University Ranking. In terms of research, USP is Brazil's largest research institution, producing more than 25% of the scientific papers published by Brazilian researchers in high quality conferences and journals. In 2015, out of 36 subjects, the QS World University Rankings ranked USP in the top 50 in eight subjects (including Architecture, Geography, Dentistry, Civil Engineering, Agriculture/Forestry, Art/Design and Veterinary Science) and in the top 51-100th position in 21 more subjects (including Computer Science, Mechanical, Electrical and Chemical Engineering, Modern Languages, Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics). Over the years, QS also consistently ranked USP among the top 5 universities in the Latin world. History After its defeat in the Constitutionalist Revolution, S√£o Paulo needed institutional improvements. Therefore, in 1933 a group of businessmen founded the Free School of Sociology and Politics (ELSP) (the current Foundation of the School of Sociology and Politics in S√£o Paulo). In 1934, the intervenor of S√£o Paulo (which corresponded to the governor), Armando de Sales Oliveira, founded the University of S√£o Paulo (USP). That was one of the efforts carried out to provide Brazil with modern administrative, educational, and military institutions in a period known as \\"search for alternatives\\". One of the main initiatives included the founding, that same year, of the University of S√£o Paulo. Its nucleus was the School of Philosophy, Sciences, and Languages, with professors coming from France, Italy, Spain, Germany and other European countries.The ELSP assumed the goal of administrative elites to form a new model in which they noted an increasing role of the state, while USP focused on training teachers for secondary schools, experts in sciences, engineers, lawyers, physicians and professors. ELSP followed a sociological American model, while USP used the French academic world as its main source of inspiration. Foreign professors such as Claude L√©vi-Strauss (France), Fernand Braudel (France), Roger Bastide (France), Robert H. Aubreton (France), Heinrich Rheinboldt (Germany), Paul Arbousse Bastide (France), Jean Mag√º√© (France), Martial Gueroult (France), Emilio Willems (Germany), Donald Pierson (USA), Gleb Vassielievich Wataghin (Russia), Pierre Monbeig (France), Giacomo Albanese (Italy), Luigi Fantappi√® (Italy), Vil√©m Flusser (Czech Republic), Giuseppe Ungaretti (Italy) and Herbert Baldus (Germany), broadcast in various institutions new standards for teaching and research, creating new generations of scientists in Brazil. Since its foundation USP received professors and researchers from all over the world, such as David Bohm (USA), Giuseppe Occhialini (Italy), Fran√ßois Ch√¢telet (France), Anatol Rosenfeld (Germany), Helmi Nasr (Egypt), G√©rard Lebrun (France), Fritz K√∂berle (Austria), Alexander Grothendieck (France), and Heinz Dieter Heidemann (Germany). Origins The University of S√£o Paulo is the result of a combination of the newly founded School of Philosophy, Sciences and Languages (Faculdade de Filosofia, Ci√™ncias e Letras, FFCL, currently the Faculty of Philosophy, Languages and Human Sciences - Faculdade de Filosofia, Letras e Ci√™ncias Humanas, FFLCH) with the existing Polytechnic School of Engineering (founded in 1893), the Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (Escola Superior de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz) (founded in 1901), the Medical School (founded in 1912), the traditional Law School (founded in 1827), the old School of Pharmacy and Dentistry (founded in 1898), the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (founded in 1886), and the School of Veterinary Medicine (founded in 1919). The FFCL emerged as the integrating element of the university, bringing together courses in various areas of knowledge. Also in 1934 the School of Physical Education (sports science) of the State of S√£o Paulo was created, the first civil school of physical education in Brazil, which would later be part of the university. In 1944 the Medical School opened its public hospital (Hospital das Cl√≠nicas da Universidade de S√£o Paulo). In the same year, the School of Engineering of Sao Carlos (EESC) emerged. In subsequent years several other research units were also created, such as a second Medical School, located in the city of Ribeir√£o Preto (S√£o Paulo's inland) in 1952. In the 1960s, the university gradually transferred the headquarters of some of its units to the City University Armando de Salles Oliveira, in S√£o Paulo. In 1963, the Heart Institute of the University of S√£o Paulo was founded. Thereafter new institutes and schools were created, for instance the School of Journalism, Communications and Arts (ECA) in 1966. Over the years, some of the university's old departments were transformed into autonomous faculties or institutes, such as the Institute of Biomedical Sciences (ICB), the Institute of Geosciences (IGc) and the Institute of Biosciences (IB) in 1969. Military dictatorship military government in front of one the university's building. During the 1970s and part of the 1980s, some critics believe that USP underwent an intellectual dissection, both in terms of knowledge production and the quality of human resources. During the past decades, the university played an essential role in the discussion and dissemination of important political ideas that contributed to the democratization of the country, bringing together many leftist intellectuals (such as Florestan Fernandes, Boris Fausto, Paul Singer, Antonio Candido, Gioconda Mussolini among others). During the Brazilian dictatorship a large number of professors from USP were persecuted and even tortured - many were forced to leave the country. This slowed down scientific production in Brazil. It also promoted a systematic increase in the total number of graduate vacancies, encouraged by the state government. The gap caused by the removal of teachers and students chased by the military regime was interrupted with the campaign of political amnesty, since the early 1980s. Several units of USP celebrated the return of their deposed professors, although many of them were rehired in a different set of conditions (former full professors took new positions as assistant professors).Architecture and Urbanism College's building Expansion Parallel to the resulting intellectual emptiness of political repression in the 1960s-80s, a process of fragmentation of the academic units occurred, new faculties were created and new institutes, which resulted in new courses, new lines of research and graduate programs. Originally conceived as the academic core of the university - gathering itself the various fields of knowledge - the FFCL (School of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters) saw its departments gain autonomy and become separate units. The Institute of Physics was the first department to extricate itself from the old FFCL, followed also by other departments of natural science. In 2004, the university founded the Institute of International Relations, with the aim to study global matters in a multidisciplinary environment (law, political science, economy, and history) with Brazilian and international students and professors (International Exchange Program).http://www.iri.usp.br/documentos/Factsheet_IRI-USP_oct_2016.pdf International Exchange Program. On 27 December 2017 In 2005, it was built in the East Zone of the city of S√£o Paulo a new School of Arts, Sciences and Humanities (EACH), taking a few courses that go beyond traditional Brazilian university model and aim to diversify the areas of the consolidated institution. [22] On 21 March 2006, USP approved the merger of a second School of Chemical Engineering (FAENQUIL) in the city of Lorena (rural area), at the Para√≠ba Valley (State of S√£o Paulo's rural area), with about 1,600 students in total and of these 1,200 at graduation. In 2007, a second Law School was established in the city of Ribeir√£o Preto, also in the State of S√£o Paulo's countryside. Academics Today USP has five hospitals and offers 247 undergraduate programs and 239 graduate programs in all areas of study. The university houses altogether 24 museums and galleries ‚Äì with half a million visitors a year ‚Äì two theaters, a cinema, a TV channel and an orchestra. The University of S√£o Paulo welcomes people from all continents and stimulates this process via networks and consortiums (International Office ‚Äì USP), such as Erasmus Mundus, Associa√ß√£o das Universidades de L√≠ngua Portuguesa, and Rede Magalh√£es (SMILE - Student Mobility in Latin America, Caribbean and Europe), among others. Rankings According to ARWU, USP was classified in the first place, regarding the number of doctorates awarded during 2011. USP is ranked among the top 70 universities in the world, in the Ranking \\"Top Universities by Reputation 2013\\" published by Times Higher Education. According to the 2013 Academic Ranking of World Universities, USP is placed in the group of the 101‚Äì151 top world universities. According to the 2020 CWTS Leiden Ranking, the University of S√£o Paulo is ranked 7th in the world. In the 2021 QS World University Rankings, the University of S√£o Paulo ranked 128th in the world and is ranked 2nd in Latin America. As of 2021, the University of S√£o Paulo is the first Latin American institution in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings to be ranked at 201-250th. Healthcare The Heart Institute of the University of S√£o Paulo, part of the Clinics Hospital, the largest health complex in Latin America USP operates four hospitals, among them University of S√£o Paulo Medical School Public Hospital, the largest hospital complex in Latin America and the major teaching and training site for the university's Faculty of Medicine, which is highly ranked within Latin America. * University of S√£o Paulo Medical School Public Hospital * Heart Institute of the University of S√£o Paulo * Public Hospital of Ribeir√£o Preto Medical School * Hospital de Reabilita√ß√£o de Anomalias Craniofaciais - Centrinho Library system alt= The University of S√£o Paulo has 42 libraries managed by the Integrated Library System (SIB - Sistema Integrado de Bibliotecas in Portuguese), which is also responsible for the university's online system, DEDALUS.

Undergraduate students can also be a teaching assistant for a semester, with scholarships from each department. * Professor Doctor (Professor Doutor) ‚Äì MS-3 (must have a doctoral or equivalent degree). * Associate Professor (Professor Associado) ‚Äì MS-5 (must have a Livre Docente title; equivalent to the German Habilitation). * Full Professor (Professor Titular) ‚Äì MS-6 (top rank, only MS-6 professors are allowed to hold positions such as the Dean of a Faculty/School or the Dean of the University). Admissions The FUVEST building, where the main admission exams take place. Brazilian students take USP's entrance exam, the vestibular, which is prepared and administered by FUVEST (University Foundation for Vestibular), subject to regulations approved by the university's Undergraduate Studies Council. In 2012, 159,603 students signed up for Fuvest's vestibular, for a total of 10,982 openings. Candidates are required to take a multiple choice test involving chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology, geography, history, Portuguese and English. The second round of tests is written and specific to the chosen field of studies, including more-in-depth questions in physics, chemistry and mathematics for engineering; history, math and geography for law and so on. In-depth written Portuguese questions are required for all. International students may come through several exchange programs. In 2012, USP hosted over 2,300 exchange students. Roughly a third of the international students are enrolled in humanities and social sciences, with another third enrolled in engineering courses. USP does not require its students, national or foreigners, to pay any tuition, as its source of funding comes from S√£o Paulo State. Organization Seat of the USP Rectory. USP, like most Latin American universities, corresponds to the idea of \\"university\\" as a set of autonomous schools, institutes and colleges, each of which is responsible for one area of knowledge (the aforementioned thirty-six teaching, research and extension). And like most Brazilian universities, grants autonomy to its teaching, research and extension units regarding the didactic organization and curricular definition of each of the courses, which often results in a considered excessive fragmentation of teaching and the research and the disconnection between the knowledge produced in each of the units. Each unit is divided into departments. A department usually is responsible for one of the courses offered by the unit or for a specific search line. In the case of units with only one or two courses, departments are not responsible for the entire course, but for a part of it. Due to the aforementioned fragmentation and decentralization of the university, it is common to see departments with similar profiles in different units, which raises criticism as to the effectiveness of public investments and duplication of efforts. Administration The administrative structure of USP has in the Rectory its central organ, as well as in the Rector the main figure of the University. Subordinated to the Rectory are the four Pro-Rectorates, specialized agencies in each of the university's fields of activity: Pro-Rectorate (PRG), Post- Graduation Pro-Rectorate (PRPG), Pro-Rectory of Research (PRP) and Pro-Rectory of Culture and Extension (PRC). In recent years there has been discussion about the creation of a Pro-Rectorate for Student Assistance, a subject that according to critics has always been considered secondary to the University's leaders. In popular culture * USP is referenced in Bernardo Kucinski's 2011 novel, K, a fictionalized account of the disappearance of an assistant lecturer in 1974, and her father's desperate attempt to find her.

Her first story was published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in 1951. Her work is cited as pre-feminist, often featuring middle-aged women, children, and their relationships, but with stereotyped gender roles. Many of her stories center around humanoid aliens called \\"The People\\", who have special powers. Henderson was nominated for a Hugo Award in 1959 for her novelette \\"Captivity\\". Science fiction authors Lois McMaster Bujold, Orson Scott Card, Connie Willis, Kathy Tyers, and Dale Bailey have cited her as an influence on their work.http://www.recursor.tv/author-dale-bailey/  Biography  Zena Chlarson (she began using the spelling \\"Zenna\\" in the early 1950s) was born in 1917 in Tucson, Arizona, the daughter of Louis Rudolph Chlarson and Emily Vernell Rowley. She was the oldest of five children. She began reading science fiction at age 12 from magazines such as Astounding Stories, Amazing Stories, and fantasy from Weird Tales. She cited Heinlein, Bradbury, Clement, and Asimov as her favorite science fiction writers. She received a bachelor of arts in education from Arizona State College in 1940, and taught school, primarily in the Tucson area, mainly first grade. She also taught in a \\"semi- ghost mining town,\\" at Fort Huachuca, in France and Connecticut, as well as in a Japanese internment camp in Sacaton, Arizona, during World War II. She married Richard Harry Henderson in 1943, but they were divorced in 1951. In 1955 she received her MA, also from Arizona State College, and continued to teach elementary school. Henderson was one of the first 203 female science fiction authors to publish in American science fiction magazines between 1926 and 1960. She never used a male pseudonym. In an essay on the increase in women authors of science fiction in 1950, Sam Merwin mentioned her as an up- and-coming woman SF writer. Her first story was published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in 1951. Her work has been referred to as feminist, but perhaps more accurately is cited as pre-feminist. Some feminist critics disliked the gender stereotypes present in her fiction, though her work depicts middle-aged and old women as well as women's relationships. In an analysis of \\"Subcommittee,\\" Farah Medlesohn examines how Henderson uses stereotypical gender roles to emphasize how feminine communication is conducive to peacemaking. In \\"Subcommittee,\\" the wife of a general, Serena, befriends an alien mother and her child. Through their sharing of \\"women's things\\" like cooking and knitting, Serena finds out that the aliens need salt to continue their species. After hearing that peace negotiations are deteriorating, Serena interrupts a meeting with her revelation and a proposed solution. Unlike other popular science fiction at the time, which often centered around war with aliens, \\"Subcommittee\\" focuses on conflict resolution. The characters' gender roles enabled the ending plot twist, but were not the focus of speculation. Henderson was born and baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Though she never renounced her membership, after her marriage, she was no longer a churchgoing Latter-day Saint. In the standard reference Contemporary Authors, she identified as Methodist, and according to Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, Volume 2, she was a member of Catalina United Methodist Church in Tucson. During her later years, she attended an independent charismatic fellowship. Her work contains many Christian themes and Biblical names. Many of her stories include The People, aliens who have traveled to Earth, which is their promised land. The People also invoke God as \\"the Power, the Presence and the Name.\\" Zenna Henderson died of cancer in 1983 in Tucson, Arizona, and was buried in the St. David Cemetery in St. David, Arizona.  Works  Most of Henderson's stories emphasize the theme of being different and the dangers therein. They often feature children or young people. Most are part of her series concerning the history of \\"The People\\", humanoid beings from a faraway planet who are forced to emigrate to Earth when their home world is destroyed by a natural disaster. Scattered mostly throughout the American Southwest during their landing before 1900, they are set apart by their desire to preserve their home culture, including their religious and spiritual beliefs. Their unusual abilities include telepathy, telekinesis, prophecy, and healing, which they call the \\"Signs and Persuasions\\". The People suppress their unusual abilities as they attempt to integrate into human life. The stories describe groups of The People, as well as lonely isolated individuals, most often as they attempt to find communities and remain distinct in a world that does not understand them. This aspect of individuality was a common theme in most of Henderson's writing. New York Times reviewer Basil Davenport described the stories as \\"haunting\\".\\"Realm of the Spaceman\\", The New York Times Book Review, January 29, 1956 Brian W. Aldiss and David Wingrove noted that \\"As a sentimental portrait of the alien [the series] out-Simaks Simak.\\"Aldiss & Wingrove, Trillion Year Spree, Victor Gollancz, 1986, p.407 In a book on early women science fiction writers, Eric Davin noted that all of her stories focus on \\"the search for community and communication,\\" a theme that many women's science fiction stories from the time share. Henderson's years as a school teacher helped her to write believable child characters. Beginning with \\"Ararat\\" (1952), Henderson's The People stories appeared in magazines and anthologies, as well as the novelized Pilgrimage: The Book of the People (1961) and The People: No Different Flesh (1966). Other volumes include The People Collection (1991) and Ingathering: The Complete People Stories (1995). A common conflict in Henderson's stories is when a child has unusual powers that a school teacher discovers through observation. In \\"The Last Step,\\" a children's teacher in a future Martian colony takes various petty measures to interrupt a children's game on the grounds that they take it too seriously, unaware that the \\"game\\" is in fact using sympathetic magic to save the colony from an upcoming hostile invasion. In \\"The Believing Child\\", a young daughter of a migrant worker believes so strongly in an imaginary magic word that its powers come true; she then uses her newfound powers to take revenge on her abusive classmates. Compared to these are more frequent, gentler tales like \\"The Anything Box,\\" in which a teacher learns that an unhappy little girl has discovered a box in which she can see her heart's desire. After struggling with her desire to steal the Anything Box for herself, the teacher must instruct the girl on how to use it safely without becoming \\"lost\\" in it. Henderson mentions mental illness in several tales, including obsessive- compulsive disorder in \\"Swept and Garnished\\", and agoraphobia in \\"Incident After\\". In \\"One of Them\\", a woman's latent telepathic powers cause her to lose her identity as she unwittingly probes the minds of her co-workers. In \\"You Know What, Teacher?\\" a young girl confides in her teacher of her father's philandering, and of her mother's plan for revenge.  Adaptations in other media  Henderson's story \\"Pottage\\" was made into the 1972 ABC-TV Movie, The People, featuring William Shatner, Kim Darby, and Diane Varsi, and concerning the story of a group of humanoid extraterrestrials who live in an isolated rural community on Earth. It was the directorial debut for John Korty and was produced by his sometime partner Francis Ford Coppola. It has been released on VHS format by Prism Entertainment and DVD format by American Zoetrope. Henderson's story \\"Hush\\" was adapted as an episode of the George A. Romero TV series Tales from the Darkside. The episode first aired in 1988.  Awards  Henderson was nominated for a Hugo Award in 1959 for her novelette \\"Captivity\\". Her books were long out of print until the 1995 release of Ingathering: The Complete People Stories, published by the New England Science Fiction Association Press. Ingathering was a second place finalist in the 1996 Locus Award for Best Collection.

Lawrence: University of Kansas Press, 1955. 78. it is an over-life-size painting that depicts a moment from the aftermath of the wreck of the French naval frigate M√©duse, which ran aground off the coast of today's Mauritania on 2 July 1816. On 5 July 1816, at least 147 people were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in the 13 days before their rescue, and those who survived endured starvation and dehydration and practiced cannibalism. The event became an international scandal, in part because its cause was widely attributed to the incompetence of the French captain. G√©ricault chose to depict this event in order to launch his career with a large-scale uncommissioned work on a subject that had already generated great public interest.\\"The Raft of the Medusa\\". Louvre. Retrieved on 19 November 2008. The event fascinated him, and before he began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of the flesh of the dying and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 Paris Salon, attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation and today is widely seen as seminal in the early history of the Romantic movement in French painting. Although The Raft of the Medusa retains elements of the traditions of history painting, in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents a break from the calm and order of the prevailing Neoclassical school. G√©ricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The Louvre acquired it soon after the artist's death at the age of 32. The painting's influence can be seen in the works of Eug√®ne Delacroix, J. M. W. Turner, Gustave Courbet, and √âdouard Manet.Fried, 92  Background  Plan of The Raft of the Medusa at the moment of its crew's rescueGrigsby, Darcy Grimaldo.

In June 1816, the French frigate M√©duse departed from Rochefort, bound for the Senegalese port of Saint-Louis. She headed a convoy of three other ships: the storeship Loire, the brig Argus and the corvette √âcho. Viscount Hugues Duroy de Chaumereys had been appointed captain of the frigate despite having scarcely sailed in 20 years.Zarzeczny, Matthew. \\"Theodore G√©ricault's 'The Raft of the M√©duse' Part I\\".

After the wreck, public outrage mistakenly attributed responsibility for his appointment to Louis XVIII, though his was a routine naval appointment made within the Ministry of the Navy and far outside the concerns of the monarch.For Louis XVIII's real political actions and appointments, see P. Mansel, Louis XVIII (London, 1981), and for the general political climate of the period, see Munro Price, The Perilous Crown: France between Revolutions (London, 2007). The frigate's mission was to accept the British return of Senegal under the terms of France's acceptance of the Peace of Paris. The appointed French governor of Senegal, Colonel Julien-D√©sir√© Schmaltz, and his wife and daughter were among the passengers.Jore, L√©once (1953) \\"La vie diverse et volontaire du colonel Julien, D√©sir√© Schmaltz\\".

On 2 July, it ran aground on a sandbank off the West African coast, near today's Mauritania. The collision was widely blamed on the incompetence of De Chaumereys, a returned √©migr√© who lacked experience and ability, but had been granted his commission as a result of an act of political preferment.Grigsby, Darcy Grimaldo.

Although the M√©duse was carrying 400 people, including 160 crew, there was space for only about 250 in the boats. The remainder of the ship's complement and half of a contingent of marine infantrymen intended to garrison Senegal ‚Äî at least 146 men and one woman ‚Äî were piled onto a hastily built raft, that partially submerged once it was loaded. Seventeen crew members opted to stay aboard the grounded M√©duse. The captain and crew aboard the other boats intended to tow the raft, but after only a few miles the raft was turned loose.Borias, 2:19 For sustenance the crew of the raft had only a bag of ship's biscuit (consumed on the first day), two casks of water (lost overboard during fighting) and six casks of wine.Savigny & Corr√©ard, 59‚Äì60, 76, 105 According to critic Jonathan Miles, the raft carried the survivors \\"to the frontiers of human experience.

After 13 days, on 17 July 1816, the raft was rescued by the Argus by chance‚Äîno particular search effort was made by the French for the raft.Borias, 2:38 By this time only 15 men were still alive; the others had been killed or thrown overboard by their comrades, died of starvation, or had thrown themselves into the sea in despair.Four or five of the survivors died later aboard the Argus. The incident became a huge public embarrassment for the French monarchy, only recently restored to power after Napoleon's defeat in 1815.Brandt, Anthony. \\"Swept Away: When Gericault Painted the Raft of the Medusa, He Immersed Himself in His Subject's Horrors\\". American Scholar, Autumn 2007.The other boats became separated and though most eventually arrived at St Louis Island in Senegal, some put ashore further along the coast and lost some of their party to heat and starvation. Of the 17 men that remained behind on the M√©duse only 3 were still alive when rescued by the British 42 days later.  Description  The Raft of the Medusa portrays the moment when, after 13 days adrift on the raft, the remaining 15 survivors view a ship approaching from a distance. According to an early British reviewer, the work is set at a moment when \\"the ruin of the raft may be said to be complete\\". The painting is on a monumental scale of , so that most of the figures rendered are life-sizedBoime, 142 and those in the foreground almost twice life-size, pushed close to the picture plane and crowding onto the viewer, who is drawn into the physical action as a participant. Detail from the lower left corner of the canvas showing two dying figures The makeshift raft is shown as barely seaworthy as it rides the deep waves, while the men are rendered as broken and in utter despair. One old man holds the corpse of his son at his knees; another tears his hair out in frustration and defeat. A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting to be swept away by the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member, Jean Charles,Hagen & Hagen, 378 stands on an empty barrel and frantically waves his handkerchief to draw the ship's attention.Muther, 224 The pictorial composition of the painting is constructed upon two pyramidal structures. The perimeter of the large mast on the left of the canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately at a rescue ship. Diagram showing the outline of the two pyramidal structures that form the basis of the work. The position of the Argus rescue vessel is indicated by the yellow dot. The viewer's attention is first drawn to the centre of the canvas, then follows the directional flow of the survivors' bodies, viewed from behind and straining to the right. According to the art historian Justin Wintle, \\"a single horizontal diagonal rhythm [leads] us from the dead at the bottom left, to the living at the apex.\\"Wintle, 246 Two other diagonal lines are used to heighten the dramatic tension. One follows the mast and its rigging and leads the viewer's eye towards an approaching wave that threatens to engulf the raft, while the second, composed of reaching figures, leads to the distant silhouette of the Argus, the ship that eventually rescued the survivors. G√©ricault's palette is composed of pallid flesh tones, and the murky colours of the survivors' clothes, the sea and the clouds. Overall the painting is dark and relies largely on the use of sombre, mostly brown pigments, a palette that G√©ricault believed was effective in suggesting tragedy and pain.Miles, 180 The work's lighting has been described as \\"Caravaggesque\\", after the Italian artist closely associated with tenebrism‚Äîthe use of violent contrast between light and dark. Even G√©ricault's treatment of the sea is muted, being rendered in dark greens rather than the deep blues that could have afforded contrast with the tones of the raft and its figures.Muther, 225‚Äì26 From the distant area of the rescue ship, a bright light shines, providing illumination to an otherwise dull brown scene.  Execution   Research and preparatory studies  Musee des Beaux-Arts, Lille, France G√©ricault was captivated by accounts of the widely publicised 1816 shipwreck, and realised that a depiction of the event might be an opportunity to establish his reputation as a painter.Miles, 169 Having decided to proceed, he undertook extensive research before he began the painting. In early 1818, he met with two survivors: Henri Savigny, a surgeon, and Alexandre Corr√©ard, an engineer from the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d'arts et m√©tiers. Their emotional descriptions of their experiences largely inspired the tone of the final painting.Riding (February 2003) According to the art historian Georges-Antoine Borias, \\"G√©ricault established his studio across from Beaujon hospital. And here began a mournful descent. Behind locked doors he threw himself into his work. Nothing repulsed him. He was dreaded and avoided.\\"Borias, 11:38 Earlier travels had exposed G√©ricault to victims of insanity and plague, and while researching the M√©duse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay,Anatomical Pieces, an unusual still- life which G√©ricault produced in 1818‚Äì1819, shows some of these dismembered limbs. and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof. Cannibalism on the Raft of the Medusa, crayon, ink wash, and gouache on paper, 28 cm √ó 38 cm, Louvre. This study is darker than the final work, and the positions of the figures differ significantly from those of the later painting. He worked with Corr√©ard, Savigny and another of the survivors, the carpenter Lavillette, to construct an accurately detailed scale model of the raft, which was reproduced on the finished canvas, even showing the gaps between some of the planks. G√©ricault posed models, compiled a dossier of documentation, copied relevant paintings by other artists, and went to Le Havre to study the sea and sky. Despite suffering from fever, he travelled to the coast on a number of occasions to witness storms breaking on the shore, and a visit to artists in England afforded further opportunity to study the elements while crossing the English Channel.Borias, 9:04 He drew and painted numerous preparatory sketches while deciding which of several alternative moments of the disaster he would depict in the final work.Hagen & Hagen, 376 The painting's conception proved slow and difficult for G√©ricault, and he struggled to select a single pictorially effective moment to best capture the inherent drama of the event. Among the scenes he considered were the mutiny against the officers from the second day on the raft, the cannibalism that occurred after only a few days, and the rescue.Riding (June 2003), 75‚Äì77 G√©ricault ultimately settled on the moment, recounted by one of the survivors, when they first saw, on the horizon, the approaching rescue ship Argus‚Äîvisible in the upper right of the painting‚Äîwhich they attempted to signal. The ship, however, passed by. In the words of one of the surviving crew members, \\"From the delirium of joy, we fell into profound despondency and grief.\\" Sailors of the M√©duse detained by the British after the sinking. They were returned to France afterwards. Lithograph by C. Motte, after Th√©odore G√©ricault. To a public well-versed in the particulars of the disaster, the scene would have been understood to encompass the aftermath of the crew's abandonment, focusing on the moment when all hope seemed lost‚Äîthe Argus reappeared two hours later and rescued those who remained.Eitner, Lorenz. 19th Century European Painting: David to C√©zanne, 191‚Äì192, Westview Press, 2002. . The author Rupert Christiansen points out that the painting depicts more figures than had been on the raft at the time of the rescue‚Äîincluding corpses which were not recorded by the rescuers. Instead of the sunny morning and calm water reported on the day of the rescue, G√©ricault depicted a gathering storm and dark, heaving sea to reinforce the emotional gloom.  Final work  G√©ricault, who had just been forced to break off a painful affair with his aunt, shaved his head and from November 1818 to July 1819 lived a disciplined monastic existence in his studio in the Faubourg du Roule, being brought meals by his concierge and only occasionally spending an evening out. He and his 18-year-old assistant, Louis-Alexis Jamar, slept in a small room adjacent to the studio; occasionally there were arguments and on one occasion Jamar walked off; after two days G√©ricault persuaded him to return. In his orderly studio, the artist worked in a methodical fashion in complete silence and found that even the noise of a mouse was sufficient to break his concentration. Study c. 1818‚Äì1819, 38 cm √ó 46 cm, Louvre. This preparatory oil sketch nearly fully realises the positions of the figures in the final work. He used friends as models, most notably the painter Eug√®ne Delacroix (1798‚Äì1863), who modelled for the figure in the foreground with face turned downward and one arm outstretched. Two of the raft's survivors are seen in shadow at the foot of the mast; three of the figures were painted from life‚ÄîCorr√©ard, Savigny and Lavillette. Jamar posed nude for the dead youth shown in the foreground about to slip into the sea, and was also the model for two other figures. Much later, Delacroix‚Äîwho would become the standard-bearer of French Romanticism after G√©ricault's death‚Äîwrote, \\"G√©ricault allowed me to see his Raft of Medusa while he was still working on it. It made so tremendous an impression on me that when I came out of the studio I started running like a madman and did not stop till I reached my own room.\\".Miles, 175‚Äì76 G√©ricault painted with small brushes and viscous oils, which allowed little time for reworking and were dry by the next morning. He kept his colours apart from each other: his palette consisted of vermilion, white, naples yellow, two different yellow ochres, two red ochres, raw sienna, light red, burnt sienna, crimson lake, Prussian blue, peach black, ivory black, Cassel earth and bitumen. Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but over a period of time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated. As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can hardly be discerned today. Banham, Joanna. \\"\\"Shipwreck!\\" \\". Times Educational Supplement, 21 February 2003. Retrieved on 6 January 2008. This diagram illustrates the main 16 colours used for the painting. G√©ricault drew an outline sketch of the composition onto the canvas. He then posed models one at a time, completing each figure before moving onto the next, as opposed to the more usual method of working over the whole composition. The concentration in this way on individual elements gave the work both a \\"shocking physicality\\" and a sense of deliberate theatricality‚Äîwhich some critics consider an adverse effect. Over 30 years after the completion of the work, his friend Montfort recalled: :[G√©ricault's method] astonished me as much as his intense industry. He painted directly on the white canvas, without rough sketch or any preparation of any sort, except for the firmly traced contours, and yet the solidity of the work was none the worse for it. I was struck by the keen attention with which he examined the model before touching brush to canvas. He seemed to proceed slowly, when in reality he executed very rapidly, placing one touch after the other in its place, rarely having to go over his work more than once. There was very little perceptible movement of his body or arms. His expression was perfectly calm ...Eitner, 102 Working with little distraction, the artist completed the painting in eight months; the project as a whole took 18 months.

By the 18th century, shipwrecks had become a recognised feature of marine art, as well as an increasingly common occurrence as more journeys were made by sea.

G√©ricault said, \\"Michelangelo sent shivers up my spine, these lost souls destroying each other inevitably conjure up the tragic grandeur of the Sistine Chapel.\\"Borias, 10:11 Although the men depicted on the raft had spent 13 days adrift and suffered hunger, disease and cannibalism, G√©ricault pays tribute to the traditions of heroic painting and presents his figures as muscular and healthy. According to the art historian Richard Muther, there is still a strong debt to Classicism in the work. The fact that the majority of the figures are almost naked, he wrote, arose from a desire to avoid \\"unpictorial\\" costumes. Muther observes that there is \\"still something academic in the figures, which do not seem to be sufficiently weakened by privation, disease, and the struggle with death\\". The influence of Jacques-Louis David can be seen in the painting's scale, in the sculptural tautness of the figures and in the heightened manner in which a particularly significant \\"fruitful moment\\"‚Äîthe first awareness of the approaching ship‚Äîis described.Novotny, 85 In 1793, David also painted an important current event with The Death of Marat. His painting had an enormous political impact during the time of the revolution in France, and it served as an important precedent for G√©ricault's decision to also paint a current event. David's pupil, Antoine-Jean Gros, had, like David, represented \\"the grandiosities of a school irredeemably associated with a lost cause\\",Brown & Blaney; in Noon, 49 but in some major works, he had given equal prominence to Napoleon and anonymous dead or dying figures.See especially Napoleon on the battlefield of Eylau (1807) and Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa (1804) G√©ricault had been particularly impressed by the 1804 painting Bonaparte Visiting the Plague-Victims of Jaffa, by Gros. Pierre-Paul Prud'hon. Justice and Divine Vengeance Pursuing Crime, 1808, 244 cm √ó 294 cm, J. Paul Getty Museum, Getty Center, Los Angeles. The darkness and the sprawling naked figure were an influence on G√©ricault's painting. The young G√©ricault had painted copies of work by Pierre-Paul Prud'hon (1758‚Äì1823), whose \\"thunderously tragic pictures\\" include his masterpiece, Justice and Divine Vengeance Pursuing Crime, where oppressive darkness and the compositional base of a naked, sprawled corpse obviously influenced G√©ricault's painting.Gayford, Martin. \\"Distinctive power\\". The Spectator, 1 November 1997. The foreground figure of the older man may be a reference to Ugolino from Dante's Inferno‚Äîa subject that G√©ricault had contemplated painting‚Äîand seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by Henry Fuseli (1741‚Äì1825) that G√©ricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino is guilty of cannibalism, which was one of the most sensational aspects of the days on the raft. G√©ricault seems to allude to this through the borrowing from Fuseli.Noon, 84. Riding (June 2003), 73. Print after the Fuseli Ugolino An early study for The Raft of the Medusa in watercolour, now in the Louvre, is much more explicit, depicting a figure gnawing on the arm of a headless corpse.Sc√®ne de cannibalisme sur le radeau de la M√©duse. Mus√©e du Louvre d√©partement des Arts graphiques, RF 53032, recto. Joconde # 50350513324 Several English and American paintings including The Death of Major Pierson by John Singleton Copley (1738‚Äì1815)‚Äîalso painted within two years of the event‚Äîhad established a precedent for a contemporary subject. Copley had also painted several large and heroic depictions of disasters at sea which G√©ricault may have known from prints: Watson and the Shark (1778), in which a black man is central to the action, and which, like The Raft of the Medusa, concentrated on the actors of the drama rather than the seascape; The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782 (1791), which was an influence on both the style and subject matter of G√©ricault's work; and Scene of a Shipwreck (1790s), which has a strikingly similar composition.Nicholson, Benedict. \\"The Raft of the Medusa from the Point of View of the Subject- Matter\\". Burlington Magazine, XCVI, August 1954. 241‚Äì8 A further important precedent for the political component was the works of Francisco Goya, particularly his The Disasters of War series of 1810‚Äì12, and his 1814 masterpiece The Third of May 1808. Goya also produced a painting of a disaster at sea, called simply Shipwreck (date unknown), but although the sentiment is similar, the composition and style have nothing in common with The Raft of the Medusa. It is unlikely that G√©ricault had seen the picture.  Exhibition and reception  The Raft of the Medusa was first shown at the 1819 Paris Salon, under the title Sc√®ne de Naufrage (Shipwreck Scene), although its real subject would have been unmistakable for contemporary viewers.Christiansen, Rupert. The Victorian Visitors: Culture Shock in Nineteenth-Century Britain\\". New York Times, 3 June 2001. Retrieved on 4 January 2008. The exhibition was sponsored by Louis XVIII and featured nearly 1,300 paintings, 208 sculptures and numerous other engravings and architectural designs. G√©ricault's canvas was the star at the exhibition: \\"It strikes and attracts all eyes\\" (Le Journal de Paris). Louis XVIII visited three days before the opening and said: \\"'\\",Reported by G√©rard, cited in: or \\"Monsieur G√©ricault, you've painted a shipwreck, but it's not one for you\\". The critics were divided: the horror and \\"terribilit√†\\" of the subject exercised fascination, but devotees of classicism expressed their distaste for what they described as a \\"pile of corpses\\", whose realism they considered a far cry from the \\"ideal beauty\\" represented by Girodet's Pygmalion and Galatea, which triumphed the same year. G√©ricault's work expressed a paradox: how could a hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting, how could the painter reconcile art and reality? Marie- Philippe Coupin de la Couperie, a French painter and contemporary of G√©ricault, provided one answer: \\"Monsieur G√©ricault seems mistaken. The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes, not to repel.\\" The painting had fervent admirers too, including French writer and art critic Auguste Jal, who praised its political theme, its liberal position‚Äìits advancement of the negro and critique of ultra-royalism‚Äìand its modernity. The historian Jules Michelet approved: \\"our whole society is aboard the raft of the Medusa\\". leftthumbNicolas Sebastien Maillot's Raft of the Medusa shown in Salon Carr√© of the Louvre, 1831, Louvre, shows G√©ricault's Raft hanging alongside works by Poussin, Lorrain, Rembrandt and Caravaggio \\"[http://www.terraamericanart.org/exhibitions/index.asp?key=33&subkey;=254 Morse's Gallery of the Louvre: A Transatlantic Mission] \\".

Critics responded to his aggressive approach in kind, and their reactions were either ones of revulsion or praise, depending on whether the writer's sympathies favoured the Bourbon or Liberal viewpoint. The painting was seen as largely sympathetic to the men on the raft, and thus by extension to the anti-imperial cause adopted by the survivors Savigny and Corr√©ard. The decision to place a black man at the pinnacle of the composition was a controversial expression of G√©ricault's abolitionist sympathies. The art critic Christine Riding has speculated that the painting's later exhibition in London was planned to coincide with anti-slavery agitation there.Riding (June 2003), 71 According to art critic and curator Karen Wilkin, G√©ricault's painting acts as a \\"cynical indictment of the bungling malfeasance of France's post-Napoleonic officialdom, much of which was recruited from the surviving families of the Ancien R√©gime\\".Wilkin, Karen. \\"Romanticism at the Met\\". The New Criterion, Volume 22, Issue 4, December 2003. 37 In 1820, G√©ricault successfully exhibited the painting in the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, London. The painting generally impressed the viewing public, although its subject matter repelled many, thus denying G√©ricault the popular acclaim which he had hoped to achieve. At the end of the exhibition, the painting was awarded a gold medal by the judging panel, but they did not give the work the greater prestige of selecting it for the Louvre's national collection. Instead, G√©ricault was awarded a commission on the subject of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which he clandestinely offered to Delacroix, whose finished painting he then signed as his own. G√©ricault retreated to the countryside, where he collapsed from exhaustion, and his unsold work was rolled up and stored in a friend's studio.Miles, 186 G√©ricault arranged for the painting to be exhibited in London in 1820, where it was shown at William Bullock's Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, London, from 10 June until the end of the year, and viewed by about 40,000 visitors.Riding (June 2003), 72 The reception in London was more positive than that in Paris, and the painting was hailed as representative of a new direction in French art. It received more positive reviews than when it was shown at the Salon.Searle, Adrian. \\"A beautiful friendship\\". The Guardian, 11 February 2003. Retrieved on 13 January 2008. In part, this was due to the manner of the painting's exhibition: in Paris it had initially been hung high in the Salon Carr√©‚Äîa mistake that G√©ricault recognised when he saw the work installed‚Äîbut in London it was placed close to the ground, emphasising its monumental impact. There may have been other reasons for its popularity in England as well, including \\"a degree of national self-congratulation\\",Riding (June 2003), 68‚Äì73 the appeal of the painting as lurid entertainment, and two theatrical entertainments based around the events on the raft which coincided with the exhibition and borrowed heavily from G√©ricault's depiction.Riding, Christine. \\"Staging The Raft of the Medusa\\". Visual Culture in Britain. Volume 5, Issue 2, Winter 2004. 1‚Äì26. From the London exhibition G√©ricault earned close to 20,000 francs, which was his share of the fees charged to visitors, and substantially more than he would have been paid had the French government purchased the work from him.Miles, 197 After the London exhibition, Bullock brought the painting to Dublin early in 1821, but the exhibition there was far less successful, in large part due to a competing exhibition of a moving panorama, \\"The Wreck of the Medusa\\" by the Marshall brothers firm, which was said to have been painted under the direction of one of the survivors of the disaster.Crary, Jonathan, \\"G√©ricault, the Panorama, and Sites of Reality in the Early Nineteenth Century,\\" Grey Room No. 9 (Autumn 2002), 16‚Äì17.

Some time later, the Medusa was moved to the Ch√¢teau de Chambord where it remained until after the end of the Second World War.Nicholas, Lynn H.

David represented the Neoclassical style, from which G√©ricault sought to break. In its insistence on portraying an unpleasant truth, The Raft of the Medusa was a landmark in the emerging Romantic movement in French painting, and \\"laid the foundations of an aesthetic revolution\\"N√©ret, 14‚Äì16 against the prevailing Neoclassical style. G√©ricault's compositional structure and depiction of the figures are classical, but the contrasting turbulence of the subject represents a significant change in artistic direction and creates an important bridge between Neoclassical and Romantic styles. By 1815, Jacques-Louis David, then in exile in Brussels, was both the leading proponent of the popular history painting genre, which he had perfected, and a master of the Neoclassical style.\\"Jacques-Louis David: Empire to Exile\\". Getty Museum. Retrieved 31 December 2008. In France, both history painting and the Neoclassical style continued through the work of Antoine-Jean Gros, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Fran√ßois G√©rard, Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson, Pierre-Narcisse Gu√©rin‚Äîteacher of both G√©ricault and Delacroix‚Äîand other artists who remained committed to the artistic traditions of David and Nicolas Poussin. Antoine- Jean Gros, detail from Napoleon on the battlefield of Eylau, 1807, Louvre. Like Gros, G√©ricault had seen and felt the exhilaration of violence, and was distraught by the human consequences. In his introduction to The Journal of Eug√®ne Delacroix, Hubert Wellington wrote about Delacroix's opinion of the state of French painting just prior to the Salon of 1819. According to Wellington, \\"The curious blend of classic with realistic outlook which had been imposed by the discipline of David was now losing both animation and interest. The master himself was nearing his end, and exiled in Belgium. His most docile pupil, Girodet, a refined and cultivated classicist, was producing pictures of astonishing frigidity. G√©rard, immensely successful painter of portraits under the Empire‚Äîsome of them admirable‚Äîfell in with the new vogue for large pictures of history, but without enthusiasm.\\" The Raft of the Medusa contains the gestures and grand scale of traditional history painting; however, it presents ordinary people, rather than heroes, reacting to the unfolding drama.Boime, 141 G√©ricault's raft pointedly lacks a hero, and his painting presents no cause beyond sheer survival. The work represents, in the words of Christine Riding, \\"the fallacy of hope and pointless suffering, and at worst, the basic human instinct to survive, which had superseded all moral considerations and plunged civilised man into barbarism\\". The unblemished musculature of the central figure waving to the rescue ship is reminiscent of the Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting‚Äîstrong indications of the extent to which G√©ricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement. Hubert Wellington said that while Delacroix was a lifelong admirer of Gros, the dominating enthusiasm of his youth was for G√©ricault. The dramatic composition of G√©ricault, with its strong contrasts of tone and unconventional gestures, stimulated Delacroix to trust his own creative impulses on a large work. Delacroix said, \\"G√©ricault allowed me to see his Raft of Medusa while he was still working on it.\\" The painting's influence is seen in Delacroix's The Barque of Dante (1822) and reappears as inspiration in Delacroix's later works, such as The Shipwreck of Don Juan (1840). Eug√®ne Delacroix, The Barque of Dante, 1822. The Raft of the Medusa's influence on the work of the young Delacroix was immediately apparent in this painting, as well as in later works. According to Wellington, Delacroix's masterpiece of 1830, Liberty Leading the People, springs directly from G√©ricault's The Raft of the Medusa and Delacroix's own Massacre at Chios. Wellington wrote that \\"While G√©ricault carried his interest in actual detail to the point of searching for more survivors from the wreck as models, Delacroix felt his composition more vividly as a whole, thought of his figures and crowds as types, and dominated them by the symbolic figure of Republican Liberty which is one of his finest plastic inventions.\\"Wellington, xv The art and sculpture historian Albert Elsen believed that The Raft of the Medusa and Delacroix's Massacre at Chios provided the inspiration for the grandiose sweep of Auguste Rodin's monumental sculpture The Gates of Hell. He wrote that \\"Delacroix's Massacre at Chios and G√©ricault's Raft of the Medusa confronted Rodin on a heroic scale with the innocent nameless victims of political tragedies ... If Rodin was inspired to rival Michelangelo's Last Judgment, he had G√©ricault's Raft of the Medusa in front of him for encouragement.\\"Elsen, 226 Eug√®ne Delacroix, Massacre at Chios, 1824, 419 cm √ó 354 cm, Louvre. This painting springs directly from G√©ricault's The Raft of the Medusa and was painted in 1824, the year G√©ricault died.Wellington, 19‚Äì49 While Gustave Courbet (1819‚Äì1877) could be described as an anti-Romantic painter, his major works like A Burial at Ornans (1849‚Äì50) and The Artist's Studio (1855) owe a debt to The Raft of the Medusa. The influence is not only in Courbet's enormous scale, but in his willingness to portray ordinary people and current political events, Clark, T.J. Farewell to an Idea. Yale University Press, 2001. 21. and to record people, places and events in real, everyday surroundings. The 2004 exhibition at the Clark Art Institute, Bonjour Monsieur Courbet: The Bruyas Collection from the Musee Fabre, Montpellier, sought to compare the 19th-century Realist painters Courbet, Honor√© Daumier (1808‚Äì1879), and early √âdouard Manet (1832‚Äì1883) with artists associated with Romanticism, including G√©ricault and Delacroix. Citing The Raft of the Medusa as an instrumental influence on Realism, the exhibition drew comparisons between all of the artists. Giuliano, Charles. \\"Courbet at the Clark \\".

The critic Michael Fried sees Manet directly borrowing the figure of the man cradling his son for the composition of Angels at the Tomb of Christ.Fried, 92 The influence of The Raft of the Medusa was felt by artists beyond France. Francis Danby, a British painter born in Ireland, probably was inspired by G√©ricault's picture when he painted Sunset at Sea after a Storm in 1824, and wrote in 1829 that The Raft of the Medusa was \\"the finest and grandest historical picture I have ever seen\\".Noon, 85 J. M. W. Turner, A Disaster at Sea (also known as The Wreck of the Amphitrite), c. 1833‚Äì35, 171.5 cm √ó 220.5 cm, Tate, London. Turner probably saw G√©ricault's painting when it was exhibited in London in 1820. The subject of marine tragedy was undertaken by J. M. W. Turner (1775‚Äì1851), who, like many English artists, probably saw G√©ricault's painting when it was exhibited in London in 1820.Riding (June 2003), 89\\"Crossing the Channel\\".

His A Disaster at Sea (c. 1835) chronicled a similar incident, this time a British catastrophe, with a swamped vessel and dying figures also placed in the foreground. Placing a coloured figure in the centre of the drama was revisited by Turner, with similar abolitionist overtones, in his The Slave Ship (1840). Winslow Homer, The Gulf Stream, 1899, 71.5 cm √ó 124.8 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art The Gulf Stream (1899), by the American artist Winslow Homer (1836‚Äì1910), replicates the composition of The Raft of the Medusa with a damaged vessel, ominously surrounded by sharks and threatened by a waterspout. Like G√©ricault, Homer makes a black man the pivotal figure in the scene, though here he is the vessel's sole occupant. A ship in the distance mirrors the Argus from G√©ricault's painting.Dorment, Richard. \\"Painting the Unpaintable\\". The New York Review of Books. 27 September 1990.

The man's condition, which in earlier works might have been characterised by hope or helplessness, has turned to \\"sullen rage\\". In the early 1990s, sculptor John Connell, in his Raft Project, a collaborative project with painter Eugene Newmann, recreated The Raft of the Medusa by making life-sized sculptures out of wood, paper and tar and placing them on a large wooden raft.ARTnews, Summer 1993 Remarking on the contrast between the dying figures in the foreground and the figures in the mid-ground waving towards the approaching rescue ship, the French art historian Georges-Antoine Borias wrote that G√©ricault's painting represents, \\"on the one hand, desolation and death. On the other, hope and life.\\"Borias, 12:32 For Kenneth Clark, The Raft of the Medusa \\"remains the chief example of romantic pathos expressed through the nude; and that obsession with death, which drove G√©ricault to frequent mortuary chambers and places of public execution, gives truth to his figures of the dead and the dying. Their outlines may be taken from the classics, but they have been seen again with a craving for violent experience.\\" Today, a bronze bas-relief of The Raft of the Medusa by Antoine √âtex adorns G√©ricault's grave in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.Miles, 249 See also *Das Flo√ü der Medusa, an oratorio on the same subject * Scandals in art  References   Bibliography  * Alhadeff, Albert.

He was widely known by his nickname \\"Bron\\". After a traditional classical education at Downside School, he was commissioned in the army during National Service, where he was badly injured in a shooting accident. He went on to study for a year at Oxford University. At twenty, he launched his journalism career at the Telegraph Group, and also wrote for many other publications including Private Eye, in which he presented a profile that was half Tory grandee and half cheeky rebel. As a young man, Waugh wrote five novels that were quite well received, but he gave up fiction for fear of unfavourable comparisons with his father. He and his wife Lady Teresa had four children and lived at their manor house in Combe Florey in Somerset.  Origins  He was born at Pixton Park, near Dulverton in Somerset, his mother's ancestral home. He was the eldest son of the novelist Evelyn Waugh, grandson of the author and publisher Arthur Waugh and nephew of Alec Waugh. His mother was Laura Herbert, his father's second wife, a daughter of Col. Aubrey Herbert (1880‚Äì1923) of Pixton, diplomat and traveller, a younger son of Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, of Highclere Castle in Hampshire, a leading member of the Conservative Party, by his second wife Elizabeth Howard, a great-niece of Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk, and a sister of Esme Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Penrith, ambassador to the United States. Laura's half-uncle was George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, the famous Egyptologist who sponsored Howard Carter who discovered King Tutankhamen's tomb, and her mother was Hon. Mary Gertrude Vesey, only child and sole heiress of John Vesey, 4th Viscount de Vesci (1844‚Äì1903). He was named after Auberon Herbert (1922‚Äì1974), his mother's brother, a landowner and advocate of Eastern European causes after World War II, himself named after Auberon Herbert (1838‚Äì1906), a son of the 3rd Earl of Carnarvon. His nickname used by friends and family was \\"Bron\\".  Early life  Born just as World war II broke out, he hardly saw his father until he was five. His parents being Roman Catholics (his mother by birth and his father by conversion), Auberon was educated at the Benedictine Downside School in Somerset and passed his Greek and Latin \\"A\\" Level exams at the early age of fifteen. He went on to begin a Philosophy, Politics, and Economics degree at Christ Church, Oxford, where he held an exhibition in English. He was rusticated by the academic authorities, and never returned to the university, preferring to make an early start in journalism.  Career  During his National Service, he was commissioned into the Royal Horse Guards and served in Cyprus, where he was almost killed in a machine gun accident. Annoyed by a fault in the machine gun on his armoured car which he drove frequently, he seized the end of the barrel and shook it, accidentally triggering the mechanism so that the gun fired several bullets through his chest. As a result of his injuries, he lost his spleen, one lung, several ribs, and a finger, and suffered from pain and recurring infections for the rest of his life. While lying on the ground waiting for an ambulance he said to his platoon sergeant: \\"Kiss me, Chudleigh\\", a humorous reference to the dying words of the great Admiral Nelson. He later recalled that \\"Chudleigh did not recognise the allusion and from then on treated me with extreme caution.\\" He was first treated for his injuries at Nicosia General Hospital. While recuperating from the accident in Italy, he began his first novel, The Foxglove Saga.  Journalism  Waugh began his career in journalism during 1960 as a cub reporter on Peterborough, the social/gossip column of The Daily Telegraph. His early work as political columnist on The Spectator coincided with the war in Biafra, a mainly Catholic province that had tried to secede from Nigeria. Waugh strongly criticised Harold Wilson's government, especially the foreign secretary Michael Stewart, for colluding in the use of mass starvation as a political weapon. He was sacked from The Spectator in 1970, but with the support of Bernard Levin and others, he won damages for unfair dismissal in a subsequent action. He was opposed to the reforms of the Second Vatican Council and criticised the Church that emerged from it. He was often critical of Archbishops Basil Hume and Derek Worlock. He also wrote for the New Statesman, British Medicine and various newspapers (including the Daily Mirror, Daily Mail, Evening Standard and The Independent). From 1981 to 1990 he wrote a leader-page column for The Sunday Telegraph. In 1990 he returned to The Daily Telegraph as the successor of Michael Wharton (better known as \\"Peter Simple\\"), writing the paper's long-running Way of the World column three times a week until December 2000. In 1995 he finally ended his long association with The Spectator, but in 1996 he rejoined The Sunday Telegraph, where he remained a weekly columnist until shortly before his death.  Private Eye  Waugh became known for his Private Eye diary, which ran from the early 1970s until 1985, and which he described as \\"specifically dedicated to telling lies\\". He fitted in well with the Eye, although he made clear his particular dislike of the Labour government of the 1970s. The education secretary Shirley Williams became an especial hate figure because of her support for comprehensive education. In his autobiography Will This Do?, Waugh claimed that he had broken two bottles of wine by banging them together too hard to celebrate when she lost her House of Commons seat at Hertford and Stevenage in the general election of 1979. Waugh was himself a candidate at the 1979 election, indulging another of his pet hates, former Liberal Leader Jeremy Thorpe, who was about to stand trial for conspiracy to murder in a scandal that Waugh had helped to expose. It was alleged that Thorpe had links to an incident in which a man called Norman Scott, who claimed to have had an affair with Thorpe, had seen his dog shot dead. Waugh stood against Thorpe for the Dog Lovers' Party in North Devon, and Thorpe obtained an injunction against the distribution of Waugh's election literature. Waugh polled only 79 votes, but Thorpe lost his seat. Waugh left Private Eye in 1986 when Ian Hislop succeeded Richard Ingrams as editor.  Waugh's views  Waugh tended to be identified with a defiantly anti-progressive, small-c conservatism, opposed to \\"do-gooders\\" and social progressives. After his death the left-wing journalist Polly Toynbee in The Guardian attacked him for these views. He has been called a nostalgist and a romantic, with a strong tendency towards snobbery, although his anarchistic streak ensured that he retained the admiration of a surprising number of people whom he would have considered horribly \\"progressive\\" or \\"leftish\\", including Francis Wheen who vociferously disagreed with the comments made by Polly Toynbee following his death. Waugh expressed an intense dislike of poet Ezra Pound. In a Spectator column of 20 March 1976, he wrote: \\"Ezra Pound, as I remember, wrote some disgusting lines about storm clouds over Westminster in his Cantos. I haven't looked at them for twenty-one years and certainly don't intend to look them up again now. Ever since I was fifteen when I first read Pound's boring filth, the thought of storm clouds over Westminster has filled me with nausea and gloom.\\"Quoted in Questioning Minds: The Letters of Guy Davenport and Hugh Kenner, ed. Edward Burns (Berkeley: Counterpoint Press, 2018), vol. 2, 1486 n.7. In a letter dated 15 January 1973, writer Guy Davenport reported \\"Auberon Waugh in the English press giggled over Ez's demise [1 November 1972], informing his audience that Pound's silly verse was so much twaddle, and his example the cause of Modern Poetry and all its vulgar pretense. He also confesses that he immensely enjoyed torturing Pound in the madhouse with letters asking what passages in The Cantos might mean. Pound's replies, tedious and lengthy, he destroyed after having his laugh.\\"Ibid., 2:1455-56. Waugh broadly supported Margaret Thatcher in her first years as prime minister, but by 1983 he became disillusioned by the government's economic policy, which he felt used the destructive economics and cultural ideas of the New Right. When Thatcher became a strong public opponent of his friend and Sunday Telegraph editor Peregrine Worsthorne, Waugh became a staunch opponent of Thatcher. Her closeness to The Sunday Times' editor Andrew Neil, whom Waugh despised, further confirmed his view. To a traditional Tory, these were some of the most deplorable aspects of the Thatcher years. There was a certain amount of public posturing in his popular anti-Americanism; he visited the US whenever he could, and spent a lot of time holidaying in New England and on US speaking tours. He had a house in France and, despite his conservatism, was a fervent supporter of European integration and the single currency, which he saw as a means of de-Americanising the UK. He said that his ideal government would be a \\"junta of Belgian ticket inspectors\\". Neither did he conform to reactionary stereotypes in his strong opposition to the death penalty, or in his antipathy towards the police force in general (especially when they sought to prevent drink-driving; Waugh believed strongly that this was not as serious a problem as it is widely believed to be, and referred to the anti-drink-driving campaign as the \\"police terror\\"). He opposed anti- tobacco smoking legislation (despite a heart condition which was ultimately to kill him prematurely) and in his later years he was highly critical of Labour attempts to ban fox hunting. In 1995 he fervently opposed attempts by the then Home Secretary Michael Howard to introduce a national identity card, a policy which at the time was opposed by the Labour opposition. Along with Patrick Marnham and Richard West, Waugh was one of three signatories to a letter to The Times that called for a British monument to honour those repatriated as a result of the Yalta Conference; it was eventually erected in 1986. Waugh held that while the dangers of smoking (especially passive smoking) and drinking were exaggerated, the dangers of hamburger eating were seriously under- reported; he frequently referred to \\"hamburger gases\\" as a serious form of atmospheric pollution and even made references to the dangers of \\"passive hamburger eating\\". He also advised that computer games \\"produce all the symptoms and most known causes of cancer\\". The Tobacco Advisory Council of the UK organised for a pro-smoking book to be ghosted for either Bernard Levin or Auberon Waugh. Neither columnist agreed to put their name to it, but Waugh wrote a foreword endorsing the book and hitting out at the anti-smoking lobby: \\"Let us hope this book strikes a blow against the new control terrorists,\\" he said. He also posed for photos, with a cigarette in his hand.  Family  In 1961, Auberon Waugh married Lady Teresa Onslow, daughter of the 6th Earl of Onslow. They had four children: * Margaret Sophia Laura (b. 1962) * Alexander Evelyn Michael (b. 1963) * Daisy Louisa Dominica (b. 1967, journalist, The Times). * Nathaniel Thomas Biafra (b. 1968) They lived at the Old Rectory, Chilton Foliat, Wiltshire, from 1964 to 1971, then moved into Waugh's father's old house, Combe Florey, Somerset.Auberon Waugh, Will This Do (London: Century, 1991), pp. 166, 206  Literary career  Waugh wrote five novels before giving up writing fiction, partly in protest at the inadequate money authors received from public lending rights at libraries and partly because he knew he would always be compared unfavourably to his father. The five novels are: * The Foxglove Saga (1960) * Path of Dalliance (1963) * Who Are The Violets Now? (1965) * Consider the Lilies (1968) * A Bed of Flowers (1972). He also wrote a book about the Thorpe case, The Last Word. He made several programmes for ATV in the 1970s. In 1986, his critical book Another Voice ‚Äì An Alternative Anatomy of Britain () was published and was well received. From that year until his death he also edited the Literary Review magazine, where he organised awards for what he called \\"real\\" (rhyming and scanning) poetry, and also a Bad Sex Award for the worst description of sex in a novel. Two collections of Waugh's Private Eye Diary have been published: Four Crowded Years: The Diaries of Auberon Waugh 1972‚Äì1976 (Deutsch/Private Eye, 1976), and A Turbulent Decade: The Diaries of Auberon Waugh 1976‚Äì1985 (Private Eye, 1985). In 1991, he was interviewed by Anthony Howard for the Thames TV documentary Waugh Memorial. Waugh opined on many and various topics. For example, in a leader piece for the Literary Review in 1991 he commented upon sceptic James Randi's dismissal on British television of the supposed art of dowsing for water. Waugh noted that, although he had no great interest in the subject, he lived in a house which had a well sunk through 70 ft (21 m) of rock on nothing more than the advice of a dowser.  Death  Auberon Waugh's grave in Church of St Peter & St Paul, Combe Florey Waugh died of heart disease at the age of 61, perhaps due to the effects of his chest wound. He is buried in the Church of St Peter & St Paul, Combe Florey. Press obituaries were lengthy, and the headline \\"Auberon Waugh dies\\" was printed on the placards for the day's London Evening Standard.

A Pittsburgh native, he is most famous for his comic fantasy Castle series, and his science fiction Skyway series. He is currently engaged in writing screenplays, teleplays, and prose fiction.  The Castle Perilous Series  The Castle Perilous series revolves around Castle Perilous (the name is drawn from the Siege Perilous of Arthurian fable), whose lord is Incarnadine, a sorcerer. 144,000 doors (or \\"aspects\\") of the Castle each lead to another parallel universe. Some of these dimensions are magical, while others have little or no magic; one of the latter is Earth. Those who find themselves at the Castle often stay to become residents, and (to their surprise) develop a magical power of their own. This gift is apparently random, and can range from a minor telekinesis limited to lifting pencils to super-enhanced senses to teleportation to full conjuration of matter. The main character, a philosophy major from Earth named Gene Ferraro, gains the power of superb swordplay. His best friends include Snowclaw, a giant humanoid covered in white fur, who originally comes from a polar-like clime, and Linda Barclay, a woman from Earth who becomes a powerful sorceress.  The Skyway Series  The Skyway series differs from the Castle series significantly; where the Castle series is humorous fantasy, the Skyway series is action-adventure science fiction. The Skyway series traces the adventures of Jake McGraw, who drives a futuristic cargo truck on the Skyway. The Skyway itself is a mysterious road, built by an unknown race of aliens, which runs across various planets from one portal to another. Driving through a portal (a \\"tollbooth\\") instantaneously transports you onto a different planet, many light years away. Humans found the Skyway on Pluto and began expanding along it, encountering various alien races along the way. However no one has a map, or knows where the Skyway begins or ends, and because each portal is one-way, only explored sections with a known return path (discovered by trial and error) are considered safe to travel. At the beginning of the first book Jake finds himself in trouble because a number of parties, both human and alien, are convinced that he has found a map. Some are willing to kill to get it. Jake knows that he does not have a map, but no one believes him. At this point Jake is accompanied only by his father, Sam, who is actually dead but has been \\"converted\\" into an artificial intelligence unit that is built into the truck. The truck itself is a large tractor trailer unit, powered by nuclear fusion and capable of operating in a vacuum. The truck's cab can hold 8 or more people and has built-in bunks for sleeping. At the beginning of the first book Jake stops to pick up a hitchhiker (the beautiful and mysterious Darla), which is the beginning of a trend: over the course of the trilogy more and more people are riding with Jake while more and more people are also pursuing him. By the end of the trilogy Jake and his companions have reached the end of the Skyway, met with the beings that created it, and returned months earlier than when they left, bringing the trilogy to a conclusion.

Its campaigning journalism frequently had a major impact on events of the day. Its production teams often took audacious risks, and the programme gained a solid reputation for its often unorthodox approach. The series was sold around the world and won numerous awards. In its heyday World in Action drew audiences of up to 23 million in Britain alone, equivalent to almost half the population. Cabinet ministers fell to its probings. Numerous innocent victims of the British criminal justice system, including the Birmingham Six, were released from jail. Honouring the programme in its 50th anniversary awards the Political Studies Association said, \\"World in Action thrived on unveiling corruption and highlighting underhand dealings. World in Action came to be seen as hard-hitting investigative journalism at its best.\\" A melodramatic post-trial encounter in 1967 between Mick Jagger and senior British establishment figures, in which rock star and retinue were wafted by helicopter onto the lawn of a stately home, was engineered by then World in Action researcher and future BBC Director General John Birt. Decades later Birt himself described it as \\"one of the iconic moments of the Sixties.\\" Soon after she became Conservative Party leader, Margaret Thatcher was said to have told the BBC Director General, Sir Ian Trethowan, that she considered World in Action to consist of \\"just a lot of Trots. Panorama, however, are bastards.\\" Its removal after 35 years was seen by some as part of a general dumbing-down of British television and of ITV in particular. One commercial TV regulatory official privately characterised the Tonight programme which replaced it as merely \\"fluffy\\". Others saw World in Action's eventual disappearance as the inevitable consequence of rising commercial pressures. Announcing a ¬£250,000 fund for an investigative journalism training scheme, Channel Four said in November 2011 that there had been a decline in the pool of investigative journalism since \\"the demise of training grounds such as World in Action\\". Origins World in Action was the pre-eminent current affairs programme produced by Britain's ITV Network in its first 50 years. Along with This Week, Weekend World, TV Eye, First Tuesday, The Big Story and The Cook Report ‚Äì and the news-gathering of ITN ‚Äì World in Action gave ITV a reputation for quality broadcast journalism to rival the BBC's output. For the first 35 years of its existence, ITV had a near-monopoly of television advertising revenue. Roy Thomson, who ran Scottish Television famously described ITV as a \\"licence to print money\\". In return for this income, the broadcasting regulator insisted that the ITV companies broadcast a proportion of their programmes as public service TV. Out of this was born the network's reputation for serious current affairs, eagerly grabbed by programme makers under Granada's founder Lord Sidney Bernstein. Some of the most prominent figures in 20th-century British broadcasting helped to create World in Action, in particular Tim Hewat, \\"the maverick genius of Granada's current affairs in its formative years\\", and David Plowright: but also Jeremy Isaacs, Michael Parkinson, John Birt and Gus Macdonald and its most long-serving executive-producer, Ray Fitzwalter. The series developed the skills of generations of journalists and, in particular, film-makers. Michael Apted worked on the original Seven Up!. Paul Greengrass, who spent 10 years on World in Action, told the BBC: \\"My first dream was to work on World In Action, to be honest. It was that wonderful eclectic mixture of filmmaking and reportage. That was my training ground. It showed me the world and made me see many things.\\" He later told The Guardian: \\"If there's a thread running through my career it's World in Action ‚Äì the phrase as well as the programme.\\" Although its rivals produced many memorable programmes, it was World in Action \\"slamming into the subject of each edition without wordy prefaces from a reassuring host-figure\\" which consistently gained a reputation for the kind of original journalism and film making which made headlines and won major awards. In its time, the series was honoured by all of the major broadcasting awards, including many BAFTA, the Royal Television Society and Emmy Awards. World in Action's style was the opposite to its urbane BBC rivals, especially to the London BBC. By repute, especially in its early days World in Action would never employ anybody who was on first-name terms with any politician. Gus Macdonald, an executive producer of the programme, said it had been \\"born brash\\". Steve Boulton, one of its last editors, wrote in The Independent that the programme's ethos was to \\"comfort the afflicted ‚Äì and afflict the comfortable.\\" Paul Greengrass told The Guardian in June 2008 that the chairman of Granada TV once told him: \\"Don't forget, your job's to make trouble.\\" The series outlasted all of its contemporaries in ITV current affairs, killed off as the commercial pressures on the network grew with the arrival of multi-channel TV in the UK. Eventually World In Action, too, was removed from the schedules by its own creator, Granada TV. It was replaced in the schedules by Tonight. Investigative legacy From the beginning, and especially from the late 1960s, World in Action broke new ground in investigative techniques. Landmark investigations included the Poulson Affair, corruption in the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad, the exposure of the shadowy and violent far-right group Combat 18, investigations into L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology and, most notably, a long campaign which resulted in the release from prison of the Birmingham Six, six Irishmen falsely accused of planting Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) bombs in Birmingham pubs. World in Action's appetite for controversy created tension with the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the official regulator during most of the series run, which had the power to intervene before broadcast. Sir Denis Forman, one of Granada's founders, wrote that there was \\"trench warfare\\" between the programme and the industry regulator, the Independent Television Authority (ITA), in the years between 1966 and 1969 as World in Action sought to establish its journalistic freedoms. The most celebrated dispute was in 1973, over the banning of The Friends and Influence of John L Poulson, the definitive film about the Poulson Affair, itself one of the defining scandals of British political life in the 1960s. Poulson was an architect, who was jailed a year later for corrupting politicians and civil servants to advance his construction business. The regulator, which was then the IBA, banned the film without seeing it and without giving official reasons other than \\"broadcasting policy\\". As a protest, Granada broadcast a blank screen ‚Äì which bizarrely recorded the third highest TV audience of that week. After a public furore which saw newspapers from the Sunday Times to the Socialist Worker unite in condemnation of \\"censorship\\", the IBA held a second vote, having by then seen the film. By a single vote, the ban was lifted and the programme, by then retitled The Rise and Fall of John Poulson, was transmitted on 30 April 1973, three months after it was first scheduled. In January 1980 the programme examined the business practices of the then chairman of Manchester United football club, Louis Edwards. Edwards ran a wholesale butchery business that supplied schools in Manchester; WIA exposed practices of bribery of council officials and the supply of meat that was unfit for human consumption to such institutions; Edwards' businesses were subsequently prosecuted and lost their contracts. Louis Edwards himself died of a heart attack a month after the show was broadcast. World in Action tackled the British intelligence services; as well as the Royal Navy over its recruitment practices: senior navy personnel famously 'door-stepped' the director of the World in Action's film in question. The programme broadcast revelations by whistleblowers from both GCHQ, the government's electronic eavesdropping and surveillance headquarters, and from the Joint Intelligence Committee. Its most audacious investigation of the intelligence community was perhaps an extended edition in July 1984 titled \\"The Spy Who Never Was\\", the confessions of a former MI5 officer, Peter Wright. Spycatcher, Wright's subsequent account of the period when he and colleagues had, as he put it, \\"bugged and burgled our way across London\\", revealed what had in effect been a planned coup against the then Labour government of Harold Wilson. Wright appeared to have been in charge of the technical side of things. 'The Wilson Plot', as it became known, was corroborated to varying degrees both before and after the film's transmission in various other books by journalists and in volumes of memoirs by others involved in the conspiracy. Wright's book was the most explosive of them all. Wright, embittered by a still unresolved pension dispute, fled to Australia where the book was written and finally published ‚Äì to the fury of Mrs Thatcher ‚Äì with the assistance of the original programme's chief researcher, Paul Greengrass. Publication in Britain was initially banned outright by the government of Margaret Thatcher. The series was rarely away from the courts and the threat of legal action. The Scientologists tried - and failed - to stop World in Action's broadcasts about them through the courts and in 1980, members of the programme's staff and senior executives at Granada TV announced that they would be prepared to go to prison rather than submit to a House of Lords ruling that the programme reveal the identity of an informant who had supplied WIA with 250 pages of secret documents from the then state-owned steel company British Steel Corporation which was at the time locked in an industrial dispute with its workforce. In 1995, Susan O'Keeffe, a World in Action journalist, was threatened with prison in Ireland for refusing to reveal her sources. She had investigated scandals within the Irish meat industry in two films in 1991, setting in motion a three-year Tribunal of Inquiry in Dublin, which found that much of her criticism of the industry was substantiated. The tribunal, though, demanded that she name her informants, and when she refused to do so, she was charged by the Irish Director of Public Prosecutions. The case became a cause c√©l√®bre in the Republic of Ireland, and in January 1995 she faced trial for contempt of court but was cleared of the charge. She was honoured in the 1994 Freedom of Information Awards for her stand. In its last few years, the programme was involved in two high-profile libel cases. It won the first (along with the Guardian) against the former Conservative cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken, and lost the second, against the high street chain Marks & Spencer. On 10 April 1995, Jonathan Aitken (himself a former journalist for Yorkshire Television) called a televised press conference three hours before the transmission of a World in Action film, Jonathan of Arabia, demanding that allegations about his dealings with leading Saudis be withdrawn. In a phrase that would come to haunt him, Aitken promised to wield \\"the simple sword of truth and the trusty shield of British fair play ... to cut out the cancer of bent and twisted journalism.\\" Aitken was subsequently sentenced to 18 months in prison for perjuring himself in the resulting libel case. World in Action followed the collapse of Aitken's libel case with a special edition whose title reflected the MP's claim to wield the \\"sword of truth\\". It was called The Dagger of Deceit. Television techniques Although the series' lasting reputation is for its investigative work, it also led the way in introducing other techniques to mainstream TV. In 1971, years before the rise of \\"reality\\" programmes on TV schedules, World in Action challenged the Staffordshire village of Longnor to quit smoking, a forerunner of many of the popular-challenge documentaries which enjoyed success in the 21st Century reality television boom. In 1984, World in Action caused a sensation by challenging a rising young Conservative Member of Parliament, Matthew Parris, to live for a week on a ¬£26 unemployment benefit payment to test the reality of his own critical views on unemployed people \\\\- Parris subsequently abandoned parliament for a career as a broadcaster and writer. The same year, World in Action revealed the tricks behind political oratory by coaching a complete beginner, Ann Brennan, to deliver a speech which won a standing ovation at the annual conference of the Social Democratic Party, using techniques developed by Professor Max Atkinson. The eminent political commentator Sir Robin Day, covering the conference for BBC television, described Mrs Brennan's performance as \\"The most refreshing speech we've heard so far.\\" World in Action helped to pioneer the technique of using covert cameras, not just in investigative work but also in social documentary, including, from the earliest days, the treatment of gypsies, the old in care (\\"Ward F13\\") and poverty in England. The arrival of high-quality miniature cameras allowed ambitious projects such as Donal MacIntyre's award-winning programmes in October 1996 on the illegal drug trade, and the future Conservative MP Adam Holloway's disturbing reports on the reality of life among the homeless in 1991. In 1998 World in Action took advantage of the new technology to equip an entire house with secret cameras hidden in anything from coke tins to fish tanks to catch out shoddy builders. The success of the two-part series called House of Horrors, produced by Kate Middleton, led not only to the ITV series House of Horrors and to the BBC's Rogue Traders but to a whole new genre of programming, around the world, based around hidden camera footage of dodgy tradesmen. World in Action also gave rise to a number of other spin-off series, most famously the Seven Up! documentaries that have followed the lives of a group of British people who turned seven years old in 1963. The most recent, 63 UP, was shown in 2019. Michael Apted directed most episodes; parallel series have also started in South Africa, the USA and Russia. More recent current affairs series on other channels, such as the MacIntyre series on BBC and Five, and Channel 4's Dispatches, commissioned by Dorothy Byrne, a former WIA producer, may be seen as having inherited certain aspects of World in Action's hard-hitting journalistic style. World in Action and popular culture One of the programme's hallmarks was its willingness to embrace popular culture, at a time when its competitors preferred a more highbrow approach. One of the very earliest editions reported on overspending at the Ministry of Defence in the style of a contemporary gameshow, Beat The Clock. The programme was so controversial it was banned from being shown on ITV by the then regulatory body, the Independent Television Authority (ITA); instead, 10 minutes of it were shown on the BBC as an act of journalistic solidarity.Denis Forman, Persona Granada pp. 216‚Äì17. The gameshow device re-emerged in 1989, when an academic study of the uptake of tax-funded benefits by the middle-class was transformed into a mock quiz show named Spongers, fronted by a well-known star of game formats, Nicholas Parsons. Popular music played a significant role in WIA's history. An early edition, in 1966, carried a fly-on-the-wall account of daily life aboard one of the then pirate radio ships, Radio Caroline, at a time when the British government was determined to preserve the radio monopoly of the BBC by driving the \\"pirates\\" off the air. In 1964 WIA covered the launch of the second pirate radio ship, Radio Atlanta, by putting a film crew on board the radio ship as she sailed into position. After the offshore radio ships were outlawed, only Radio Caroline's two ships continued, so WIA visited one of the ships in September 1967. The British Government were furious and banned the World in Action camera crew from sailing back into the UK at Felixstowe just a few miles away, forcing them to sail to Holland and then fly back to the UK. The long-running intermittent Seven Up! series of TV films, which in due course spanned decades, was first broadcast from 1964 as part of World in Action. By its intimate technique of filming the everyday lives of children and interviewing them, a different picture of life in Britain was formed. In 1967, a young researcher named John Birt established his early reputation by persuading the rock star Mick Jagger to appear on World in Action to debate youth culture and his recent drug conviction, with Establishment figures, including William Rees-Mogg of The Times, who had written a famous editorial defending the singer. Jagger so enjoyed the experience that he invited the Granada team to film The Rolling Stones at the band's free 1969 concert in Hyde Park, London. The resulting film, The Stones in the Park, was one of the iconic concert films of the 1960s. John Birt moved on to edit World in Action, and eventually became the Director General of the BBC. The rise of Thatcherism and the misery of mass unemployment saw WIA examining the phenomenon through the eyes of another emerging band, UB40, in A Statistic, A Reminder (1981), a line taken from one of the band's songs. Six years later, a special edition of the programme was devoted to the Irish rock band U2 and their charismatic front man Bono. Like The Rolling Stones before them, U2 allowed World in Action to film one of their classic concerts in 1987 in Ireland. This footage, shot by the future Hollywood director Paul Greengrass, was shown only once on ITV because of copyright restrictions although it has circulated among fans as a bootleg. In 1983, Stevie Wonder, at the height of his popularity, gave the programme a musical exclusive when he agreed to let a World in Action crew record him performing an unreleased song, written to help the Democratic politician Jesse Jackson's electioneering, for The Race Against Reagan. Another popular singer, Sting, appeared in a more critical World in Action episode, which questioned the effectiveness of his Rainforest Foundation. In August 1980 the series devoted an edition to the story behind chart rigging ‚Äì an ongoing practice where record companies were bribing the British chart compilers to put certain artists' singles higher in the charts than they actually were. Singles mentioned on the programme included several UK number one hits of the previous 12 months. Perhaps the most bruising encounter between WIA and popular entertainment was the 1995 film \\"Black and Blue\\" which featured a covert recording of a performance by the comedian Bernard Manning as the star of a charity function organised by the Manchester branch of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers. Manning's racist and homophobic performance, loudly applauded by those present, caused outrage when WIA broadcast excerpts, sparking an intense debate about the willingness of British police officers to embrace a diverse culture. The former WIA editor Steve Boulton revealed during a 2013 ITV documentary about World in Action that the covert recording had been made by a fellow speaker at the function, the former Liverpool Militant politician Derek Hatton, himself a previous target of a World in Action investigation. Hatton used a miniature cassette recorder concealed in Boulton's own Filofax. Leading contributors Journalists World in Action employed many leading journalists, among them John Pilger; Michael Parkinson; Gordon Burns; Rob Rohrer; Nick Davies, Ed Vulliamy and David Leigh of the Guardian; Alasdair Palmer of the Sunday Telegraph; John Ware, BBC Panorama's leading investigative reporter; Tony Wilson, whose second career as a music impresario was immortalised in the feature film 24 Hour Party People; Michael Gillard, creator of the Slicker business pages in the satirical magazine Private Eye; Donal MacIntyre; the writer Mark Hollingsworth; Quentin McDermott, since 1999 a leading investigative reporter for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; Tony Watson, editor of the Yorkshire Post for 13 years and editor-in-chief of the Press Association from December 2006; and Andrew Jennings, author of Lords of the Rings and The Dirty Game, who has campaigned vigorously for more than a decade against corruption in international sport. Two former World in Action journalists uncovered one of the biggest broadcasting scandals of the 1990s. Laurie Flynn, a central figure in the British Steel papers case, and Michael Sean Gillard revealed that large parts of a 1996 Carlton Television documentary, The Connection, about drug trafficking from Colombia, had been fabricated. Flynn and Gillard's expos√© in the Guardian in May 1998 led to an inquiry and a record ¬£2 million fine for Carlton from the then regulator, the Independent Television Commission (ITC), as well as provoking a passionate debate about truthfulness in broadcast journalism. Presenters Unusually for a current affairs programme, WIA's standard format was as a voice-over documentary without a regular reporter although a handful of WIA journalists did appear in front of camera, including Chris Kelly, Gordon Burns, John Pilger, Gus Macdonald, Nick Davies, Adam Holloway, Stuart Prebble (who later became the programme's editor), Mike Walsh, David Taylor, Donal MacIntyre and Granada Reports journalist and Factory Records supremo Tony Wilson who became the show's first in-vision anchor in the early 80s. Guest presenters were used on rare occasions, among them Jonathan Dimbleby, Sandy Gall, Martyn Gregory, Sue Lawley and Lynn Faulds Wood. Perhaps its most celebrated guest presenter was the distinguished American anchorman Walter Cronkite, who came out of retirement to cover the 1983 UK general election for the series. A small group of narrators delivered the vast majority of WIA's voice-overs. The two original narrators were Derek Cooper, later to become well known as a broadcaster and writer about food, and Wilfrid Thomas. The science presenter James Burke did a number of commentaries on early editions of the programme. Other major contributors included David Plowright, Chris Kelly, Jim Pope, Philip Tibenham and Andrew Brittain. Among the guest narrators who contributed occasional commentaries were the popular actors Robert Lindsay and Jean Boht. Producer-directors The series was known for its gritty visual style, almost always shot on location, and a number of its producer-directors went on to work on major film projects. Those working on the series in its early years included Michael Apted, later to direct Coal Miner's Daughter, Gorillas in the Mist and the James Bond film The World Is Not Enough, as well as the Up Series documentaries (the earliest programmes were part of the WIA series), and Mike Hodges, who went on to direct Get Carter and Flash Gordon. Director John Goldschmidt made several films for the series in the early 1970s. Later, Paul Greengrass, director of the feature films United 93, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum and of the drama-documentaries Bloody Sunday and The Murder of Stephen Lawrence, cut his directing teeth on World in Action. Leslie Woodhead, director of The Stones in the Park, the award-winning A Cry From The Grave, many Disappearing World films and also regarded by many as a founder of the drama-documentary movement, worked on World in Action for many years as a producer-director and executive. Long-time World in Action alumni who went on to direct and produce Granada's international award-winning Disappearing World films include Brian Moser, its instigator and original producer, and Charlie Nairn. Among the more recent generation of film-makers to emerge from World in Action were Alex Holmes, who became editor of the BBC2 documentary strand Modern Times and went on to write and direct the Bafta-winning dramatised documentary series Dunkirk for the BBC and House of Saddam for the BBC and HBO; and the late Katy Jones, a former WIA producer who became a key collaborator with the screenwriter Jimmy McGovern as a producer on the drama- documentaries Hillsborough (1996) and Sunday (2002). Broadcasters WIA was a starting point for several key programme-makers who went on to major roles in British broadcasting. John Birt became Director General of the BBC, having been programme controller of the ITV station London Weekend Television, where he created the current affairs flagship, Weekend World. Several WIA staffers were promoted to significant roles in Granada Television, among them David Plowright, who became its chairman and later went on to become deputy chairman of Channel 4. Steve Morrison became chief executive at Granada. Gus Macdonald held the same role at another ITV franchise, Scottish Television. Stuart Prebble, a former editor, became chief executive of ITV, and Steve Anderson became head of news and current affairs for that channel. Both have since moved on to the independent production industry. Ian McBride, who led the team which made the Birmingham Six programmes, became managing editor of Granada TV, and was director of compliance for ITV until 2008. Dianne Nelmes, who worked as a researcher and executive producer of WIA, was the founding editor of Granada TV's hugely successful This Morning with Richard and Judy and went on to head daytime and factual programmes at ITV. Dorothy Byrne, a former WIA producer, is head of news and current affairs at Channel 4. Julian Bellamy, who worked as a young researcher on one of WIA's last big foreign investigations ‚Äì about arms deals between Britain and Indonesia ‚Äì later headed Channel 4's entertainment channel E4 and was programme controller of the BBC digital channel BBC Three before re-joining Channel 4 as its head of programming from 2007 to 2011. In 2012, Bellamy was appointed creative director of Discovery International. TV production companies A number of WIA veterans went on to set up and run their own independent television production companies. John Smithson and David Darlow, who set up the production company Darlow Smithson, responsible for the feature films Touching the Void and Deep Water and many factual TV programmes including Black Box and The Falling Man, worked together on WIA. Claudia Milne founded twentytwenty TV, which made a successful current affairs strand for ITV, The Big Story, as well as popular factual series such as Bad Boys' Army' on ITV and That'll Teach 'Em on Channel 4. Brian Lapping set up the much-garlanded Brook Lapping company, which made The Death of Yugoslavia and many other landmark contemporary history programmes. Stuart Prebble, a former editor of World in Action, runs Liberty Bell, best known for the popular Grumpy Old Men series on the BBC. Another former editor, Steve Boulton, started an eponymous company, which made Young, Nazi & Proud, a Bafta-winning profile of the young British National Party activist Mark Collett. Simon Albury went on to lead the Campaign for Quality Television and was a founder director of the ITV company Meridian Broadcasting. One of the biggest British independent production companies is All 3 Media, which controls several other leading companies, including Lime Pictures, formerly Mersey Television, makers of Hollyoaks. It is run by Steve Morrison, a former WIA producer. Political connections Although in its early days World in Action was reputed never to employ anyone who was on first-name terms with any politician, a number of subsequent British parliamentarians have World in Action on their curricula vitae. The most recent is the Conservative MP Adam Holloway, elected to the House of Commons in 2005. The former British cabinet minister Jack Straw worked on World in Action as a researcher, as did Margaret Beckett who served as Tony Blair's last Foreign Secretary. Chris Mullin, Labour MP for Sunderland South from 1987 to 2010, played a major role in the programme's campaign on behalf of the Birmingham Six. Gus Macdonald, now Baron Macdonald of Tradeston, and from 1998 to 2003 a government minister, was formerly an executive on the programme. John Birt (by then ennobled as Baron Birt), was personal adviser to the British Prime Minister Tony Blair between 2001 and 2005. Editors Editors of the programme (sometimes with the title of executive producer) were, successively, Tim Hewat, Derek Granger, Alex Valentine, David Plowright, Jeremy Wallington, Leslie Woodhead, John Birt, Gus Macdonald, David Boulton, Brian Lapping, Ray Fitzwalter, Allan Segal, David Cresswell, Stuart Prebble, Nick Hayes, Dianne Nelmes, Charles Tremayne, Steve Boulton and Jeff Anderson. Anderson also became editor of World in Action's replacement Tonight, before becoming head of current affairs at ITV in 2006. Mike Lewis, a former WIA producer, was appointed editor of Tonight in October 2006. Academic connections Professor Brian Winston, Pro-Vice Chancellor (External Relations) at the University of Lincoln, who has also held leading posts at the Universities of Westminster, Cardiff, Pennsylvania State and New York, was a researcher and producer in the early series of World in Action. Ray Fitzwalter, WIA's longest-serving editor and the man behind the ground- breaking Poulson investigations, became a visiting fellow at the University of Salford School of Media, Music and Performance. The late Gavin MacFadyen, who worked on early series of World in Action as a producer-director, best known for his under-cover human rights films, became a visiting professor at City University in 2005. He was also director of the Centre for Investigative Journalism. David Leigh, who made Jonathan of Arabia, the film which provoked Jonathan Aitken's self-destructive libel action, was made Britain's first professor of reporting at City University, London, in September 2006. Camerawork Although a great many director/producers, journalists and editors passed through the programme, one cameraman played an overwhelming role in shaping the appeal of the series. George Jesse Turner served on the programme from 1966 until its end. By his own count, he shot the principal footage for some 600 of its 1,400 editions, as well as filming all of Michael Apted's documentaries in the Seven Up! series.George Jesse Turner & Jeff Anderson, Trouble Shooter, p. viii. Turner was shot himself ‚Äì in the backside ‚Äì by an Israeli bullet while filming a clash between Fatah guerrillas and the Israeli Army in 1969.George Jesse Turner & Jeff Anderson, Trouble Shooter, pp. 7‚Äì13. Shortly before he retired from Granada, Turner was honoured by Bafta in 1999 for his work as a documentary cameraman. Among the many cameramen who also contributed to WIA was Chris Menges, who went on to become a distinguished cinematographer ‚Äì Kes, The Killing Fields and The Mission are among his credits ‚Äì and a film director in his own right, on features such as A World Apart. Title sequence The series' distinctive identity owed much to its iconic title sequence created by John Sheppard, combining the image of da Vinci's Vitruvian Man with a musical score of a modern Classical Music structure (inspired by Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugues), in a descending series of organ and acoustic guitar chords combined with a Jazz Music rhythm. The score was given the working-title of Jam for World in Action, and has been credited variously to Jonathon Weston or to Shawn Phillips. The English musician Mick Weaver also claims to have jointly authored the score with Phillips.Statement by Mick Weaver on Youtube, September 2016 via the 'Mick Weaver' channel: 'Any comment about the 'World in Action' theme being written by Shawn Phillips, is utter bullshit. I played the B3 Organ parts over a descending chord progression that Phillips came up with. It was a 50/50 collaboration between he and I, and I am utterly pissed off with this charlatan claiming or being credited with having 'created' the entire thing. What happened was that Shawn came to me and said that he had been asked to compose some theme music for a T.V. programme, and that he had come up with a chord progression, but needed help with putting some melody lines to it, and asking would I be interested in collaborating with him to complete it. So, I came up with some vaguely 'Bachish' melody lines and we spent an evening in Trident Studios in Wardour Street, London, recording several segments of varying lengths of my melody lines with Shawn's chord progression. We were told by the Granada people, some of whom attended the recording sessions, that the music would become the property of Granada, and that we would be paid Musician's Union scale session fees for the evening's work, which at the time was ¬£9 per hour. Not only has my contribution to this music (not to imply that the stuff is a work of magnificent art) never been acknowledged, but I never even received the session fees. Not only that, I had to take the tube to Piccadilly Circus to get to the studio, and was never reimbursed, so, as well as never having been credited, financially or otherwise with my participation in the project, I am down the f-ing tube fare. I was young and easily conned in those days, but to be worked over by a fellow musician is especially galling ...' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95qLDc7zwYY The track was covered by Matt Berry in 2018 on his album Television Themes.

Those claims generated considerable interest and controversy among some of the leading natural philosophers of the day, including Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Johann Bernoulli, John Theophilus Desaguliers, and Willem 's Gravesande. The modern scientific consensus is that Bessler perpetrated a deliberate fraud, although the details of this have not been satisfactorily explained. Life and career Bessler was born to a peasant family in Upper Lusatia, in the German Electorate of Saxony, circa 1680.A contemporary source says that he was born in \\"Ullersdorff near Zittau\\" (today Nov√Ω Old≈ôichov, in the Czech Republic): Biblioth√®que Germanique ou Histoire litt√©raire de l'Allemagne, de la Suisse et des Pays du Nord, vol. XL, 1737, p. 15 He went to school in Zittau, where (according to his own account) he excelled in his studies and became a favorite of Christian Weise, the rector of the local Gymnasium. After he left school he began to travel widely, seeking his fortune. Having saved an alchemist from drowning in a well, he was rewarded with instruction on the fabrication of elixirs. After that Bessler earned his living as a healer and an unlicensed physician. He was also an apprentice watchmaker, until his fortunes improved when he married the wealthy daughter of the physician and mayor of Annaberg, Dr. Christian Schuhmann. Bessler adopted the pseudonym \\"Orffyreus\\" by writing the letters of the alphabet in a circle and selecting the letters diametrically opposite to those of his surname (what would modernly be called a ROT13 cipher), thus obtaining Orffyre, which he then Latinized into Orffyreus.Rupert T. Gould, \\"Orffyreus's Wheel,\\" in Oddities: A Book of Unexplained Facts, revised ed., (London: Geoffrey Bles, 1944), pp. 89-116. Reprinted by Kessinger Pub Co., 2003, . That was the name by which he was generally known thereafter. Orffyreus's wheels In 1712, Bessler appeared in the town of Gera in the province of Reuss and exhibited a \\"self- moving wheel,\\" which was about ft (2 m) in diameter and thick. Once in motion it was capable of lifting several pounds. Bessler then moved to Draschwitz, a village near Leipzig, where in 1713 he constructed an even larger wheel, a little over 9 ft ( m) in diameter and 6 inches (15 cm) in width. That wheel could turn at fifty revolutions a minute and raise a weight of 40 lb (18 kg). The eminent mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz visited Draschwitz in 1714 and witnessed a demonstration of Bessler's wheel. In a letter to Robert Erskine, physician and advisor to Russian Tsar Peter the Great, Leibniz later wrote that Bessler was \\"one of my friends\\" and that he believed Bessler's wheel to be a valuable invention. Bessler also received support from other members of Leibniz's intellectual circle, including mathematician Johann Bernoulli, philosopher Christian Wolff, and architect Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach. Orffyreus Wheel diagram. (Merseburg, Germany) Orffyreus Wheel diagram. (Kassel, Germany) Bessler then constructed a still larger wheel in Merseburg, before moving to the independent state of Hesse-Kassel, where Prince Karl, the reigning Landgrave and an enthusiastic patron of mechanical inventors, appointed him as a commercial councillor (Kommerzialrat) for the town of Kassel and provided him with rooms in Weissenstein Castle. It was there that in 1717 he constructed his largest wheel so far, in diameter and thick. The inventor demonstrated the operation of his wheel before various audiences, always taking care that the mechanism within the wheel should remain hidden from view, purportedly to prevent others from stealing his invention. The wheel was examined externally by several scientists, including Willem 's Gravesande, professor of mathematics and astronomy at Leiden University, who reported that he could not detect any fraud regarding its operation. On 12 November 1717 the wheel was locked in a room in the castle with the doors and windows sealed to prevent any interference. This was witnessed by the Landgrave and various officials. Two weeks later, the seals were broken and the room was opened, whereupon the wheel was found to be revolving. The door was resealed until 4 January 1718. The wheel was then found to be turning at twenty-six revolutions per minute. Bessler demanded ¬£20,000 (equivalent to 100,000 Reichsthalers) in exchange for revealing the secret of his machines. Peter the Great was interested in purchasing the invention and sought advice on the matter from Gravesande and others. Gravesande examined the axle of the wheel, concluding that he could see no way in which power could be transmitted to it from the outside. Bessler, however, then smashed the wheel, accusing 's Gravesande of trying to discover the secret of the wheel without paying for it, and declaring that the curiosity of the professor had provoked him.  Later life  Bessler and his machine then vanished into obscurity. It is known that he was rebuilding his machine in 1727 and that 's Gravesande had agreed to examine it again, but it is not known whether it was ever tested. Bessler was apparently arrested in 1733, but by 1738 he was again free and living in an estate in Bad Karlshafen, near Kassel. Bessler died in 1745, aged sixty-five, when he fell to his death from a four-and-a-half-story windmill he was constructing in F√ºrstenburg. Mechanism of Orffyreus's Wheel Bessler's devices were all hollow wheels, with canvas covering the internal mechanism, that turned on a horizontal axis supported by vertical wooden beams on either side of the wheel. Christian Wolff, who viewed the wheel in 1715, wrote that Bessler freely revealed that the device utilized weights of about 4 pounds. Fischer von Erlach, who viewed the wheel in 1721, reported: \\"At every turn of the wheel can be heard the sound of about eight weights, which fall gently on the side toward which the wheel turns.\\"Letter from J. E. Fischer to John Theophilus Desaguliers, 1721. Quoted by R.T. Gould, Oddities, p. 96. In a letter to Sir Isaac Newton, 's Gravesande reported that, when pushed, the wheel took two or three revolutions to reach a maximum speed of about 25 revolutions per minute.Letter by W. 's Gravesande to I. Newton, August 1721, quoted by R.T. Gould, Oddities, p. 95. The wheels at Merseburg and Kassel were attached to three-bobbed pendula, one on either side, which presumably acted as regulators, limiting the maximum speed of revolution. Bessler never revealed the mechanism that kept his wheel in motion and, according to surviving sources, the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel was the only person whom he ever allowed to examine the inside of the wheel. In 1719 Bessler published a pamphlet in German and Latin, entitled The Triumphant Orffyrean Perpetual Motion, which gives a very vague account of his principles.J. E. E. Bessler (\\"Orffyreus\\"), Das Triumphirende Perpetuum mobile Orffyreanum , (Kassel, 1719). He indicated that the wheel depended upon weights placed so that they can \\"never attain equilibrium.\\" This suggests that it was a kind of \\"overbalanced wheel,\\" a hypothetical gravity-powered device which is now recognized by physicists as impossible (see perpetual motion). Allegations of fraud Most of the people who met him, including supporters such as 's Gravesande, reported that Bessler was eccentric, ill- tempered, and perhaps even insane. From the beginning, Bessler's work generated accusations of fraud from various people, including mining engineer Johann Gottfried Borlach, mathematician Christian Wagner, model-maker Andreas G√§rtner, Kassel court tutor Jean-Pierre de Crousaz, and others. G√§rtner went on to gain employ as model-master for the Polish royal court, and in that capacity he built several devices that reproduced some of the successes of Bessler's public demonstrations, including the locked-room test, but which G√§rtner acknowledged as mere trickery. In November 1727, Bessler's maid, Anne Rosine Mauersbergerin, ran away from Bessler's household and testified under oath that she had turned the machines manually from an adjoining room, alternating in that job with Bessler's wife, his brother Gottfried, and Bessler himself. 's Gravesande refused to accept the maid's testimony, writing that he paid \\"little attention to what a servant can say about machines\\". By then, 's Gravesande was embroiled in an academic dispute with members of Isaac Newton's circle about the possibility of gravity-powered perpetual motion, which 's Gravesande persistently defended based partly on his belief that Bessler, though \\"mad\\", was not a fraud. The consensus view of modern scientists is that Bessler was perpetrating a deliberate fraud, though just how his wheel was powered is not entirely clear. According to the writers of Chambers's Encyclopaedia, Orffyreus's wheel, \\"but for its strange effect on 's Gravesande, would have been forgotten long ago\\".\\"Perpetual Motion\\", Chambers's encyclop√¶dia: a dictionary of universal knowledge, vol. 7, (London: W. and R. Chambers, 1868), pp. 412-415. If the maid's confession were true, the testimonies by Prince Karl, 's Gravesande, and others about the conditions under which the wheel was tested and exhibited must be flawed.

Life cycle The life cycle of Pilobolus begins with a black sporangium that has been discharged onto a plant substrate such as grass. A herbivorous animal such as a horse then eats the substrate, unknowingly consuming the sporangium as well. The Pilobolus sporangium survives the passage through the gastrointestinal tract without germinating, and emerges with the excrement. Once outside its host, spores within the sporangium germinate and grow as a mycelium within the excrement, where it is a primary colonizer. Later, the fungus fruits to produce more spores. Pilobolus sporangium The asexual fruiting structure (the sporangiophore) of Pilobolus species is unique. It consists of a transparent stalk which rises above the excrement to end in a balloon-like subsporangial vesicle. On top of this, a single, black sporangium develops. The sporangiophore has the remarkable ability of orienting itself to point directly towards a light source. The shape and transparency of the subsporangial vesicle allow it to act as a lens, focusing light into carotenoid pigments deposited near the base of the vesicle, which absorb the photons and allow cells to detect the light level in the direction of the lens. The developing sporangiophore grows such that the maturing sporangium is aimed directly at the light. When turgor pressure within the subsporangial vesicle builds to a sufficient level (often 7 ATM or greater), the sporangium is launched, and can travel anywhere from a couple of centimeters to a distance of 2 meters (6 ft). For a sporangiophore less than 1cm tall, this involves acceleration from 0 to 20 km/h in only 2 ¬µs, subjecting it to over 20,000 G, equivalent to a human being launched at 100 times the speed of sound. The orientation of the stalk towards the early morning sun apparently guarantees that the sporangium is shot some distance from the excrement, enhancing the chances that it will attach to vegetation and be eaten by a new host. Another adaptation of Pilobolus is that the sporangium is covered in calcium oxalate crystals. Besides serving as a protective mechanism, their hydrophobic nature also leads the sporangium to flip over onto its sticky bottom after landing in a drop of dew, thus allowing it to cling to a plant substrate. Pilobolus species can be grown in artificial culture, but only when the growth medium is supplemented with some form of chelated iron, or with sterilized herbivore dung. The forcible discharge mechanism of Pilobolus is exploited by parasitic nematodes including lungworms in the genus Dictyocaulus. Larval lungworm nematodes excreted by infected deer, elk, cattle, horses, and other hosts climb up Pilobolus sporangiophores and are discharged with the sporangium. They complete their life cycle when they and their Pilobolus vector are eaten by a new host. References *Bruce, V. G., F. Weight, and C. S. Pittendrigh. 1960.

Completed in 1889, the building is located at the northwest corner of South Michigan Avenue and Congress Street (now Ida B. Wells Drive). The building was designed to be a multi-use complex, including offices, a theater, and a hotel. As a young apprentice, Frank Lloyd Wright worked on some of the interior design. The Auditorium Theatre is part of the Auditorium Building and is located at 50 East Ida B. Wells Drive. The theater was the first home of the Chicago Civic Opera and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It currently hosts the season performances of the Joffrey Ballet. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 17, 1970. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1975, and was designated a Chicago Landmark on September 15, 1976. In addition, it is a historic district contributing property for the Chicago Landmark Historic Michigan Boulevard District. Since 1947, the Auditorium Building has been part of Roosevelt University. Origin and purpose Ferdinand Peck, a Chicago businessman, incorporated the Chicago Auditorium Association in December 1886 to develop what he wanted to be the world's largest, grandest, most expensive theater that would rival such institutions as the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. He was said to have wanted to make high culture accessible to the working classes of Chicago. The building was to include an office block and a first class hotel. Peck persuaded many Chicago business tycoons to go on board with him, including Marshall Field, Edson Keith, Martin A. Ryerson, Charles L. Hutchinson and George Pullman. The association hired the renowned architectural firm of Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan to design the building. At the time, a young Frank Lloyd Wright was employed at the firm as draftsman, and he may have contributed to the design.\\"Some interior details were probably drawn by Frank Lloyd Wright, who started in Sullivan's office as a draftsman in 1887.\\" Banister Fletcher. A History of Architecture. p. 1241. > The Auditorium was built for a syndicate of businessmen to house a large > civic opera house; to provide an economic base it was decided to wrap the > auditorium with a hotel and office block.

A Concise History of American > Architecture. p. 179-80 Design Sullivan and Adler designed a tall structure with load-bearing outer walls, and based the exterior appearance partly on the design of H.H. Richardson's Marshall Field Warehouse, another Chicago landmark. The Auditorium is a heavy, impressive structure externally, and was more striking in its day when buildings of its scale were less common. When completed, it was the tallest building in the city and largest building in the United States. One of the most innovative features of the building was its massive raft foundation, designed by Adler in conjunction with engineer Paul Mueller. The soil beneath the Auditorium consists of soft blue clay to a depth of over 100 feet, which made conventional foundations impossible. Adler and Mueller designed a floating mat of crisscrossed railroad ties, topped with a double layer of steel rails embedded in concrete, the whole assemblage coated with pitch. The resulting raft distributed the weight of the massive outer walls over a large area. However, the weight of the masonry outer walls in relation to the relatively lightweight interior deformed the raft during the course of a century, and today portions of the building have settled as much as 29 inches. This deflection is clearly visible in the theater lobby, where the mosaic floor takes on a distinct slope as it nears the outer walls. This settlement is not because of poor engineering but the fact the design was changed during construction. The original plan had the exterior covered in lightweight terra-cotta, but this was changed to stone after the foundations were under construction. Most of the settlement occurred within a decade after construction, and at one time a plan existed to shorten the interior supports to level the floors but this was never carried out. In the center of the building was a 4,300 seat auditorium, originally intended primarily for production of Grand Opera. In keeping with Peck's democratic ideals, the auditorium was designed so that all seats would have good views and acoustics. The original plans had no box seats and when these were added to the plans they did not receive prime locations. Housed in the building around the central space were an 1890 addition of 136 offices and a 400-room hotel, whose purpose was to generate much of the revenue to support the opera. While the Auditorium Building was not intended as a commercial building, Peck wanted it to be self-sufficient. Revenue from the offices and hotel was meant to allow ticket prices to remain reasonable. In reality, both the hotel and office block became unprofitable within a few years.

The 1888 Republican National Convention was held in a partially finished building where Benjamin Harrison was nominated as a presidential candidate. On December 9, 1889, President Benjamin Harrison dedicated the building and opera star Adelina Patti sang \\"Home Sweet Home\\" to thunderous applause. Adler & Sullivan had also opened their offices on the 16th and 17th floors of the Auditorium tower. Roosevelt University's Murray- Green Library on the 10th floor of the Auditorium Building The Chicago Symphony Orchestra debuted on October 16, 1891, and made its home in the Auditorium Theatre until moving to Orchestra Hall in 1904. The opera company renting the accommodation moved to the Civic Opera House in 1929, and the Auditorium Theatre closed during the Great Depression. In 1941, it was taken over by the city of Chicago to be used as a World War II servicemen's center. By 1946, Roosevelt University moved into the Auditorium Building, but the theater was not restored to its former splendor. In 1952, Congress Parkway was widened, bringing the curb to the southern edge of the building. To make room for a sidewalk, some ground-floor rooms and part of the theater lobby were removed and a sidewalk arcade created. Grant Park rally on the night of the 2008 election On October 31, 1967, the Auditorium Theatre reopened and through 1975, the Auditorium served as a rock venue. Among other notable acts, the Grateful Dead played there ten times from 1971 through 1977. The Doors also played their first concert at the Auditorium Building after their arrest of singer Jim Morrison on June 14, 1969. It was declared a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1975. The building was equipped with the first central air conditioning system and the theater was the first to be entirely lit by incandescent light bulbs. In 2001, a major restoration of the Auditorium Theatre was begun by Daniel P. Coffey and Associates in conjunction with EverGreene Architectural Arts to return the theater to its original colors and finishes. On April 30, 2015, the National Football League held its 2015 NFL Draft in the Auditorium Theatre, the first time the league has held its annual draft in Chicago in more than 50 years.

Worship of gods also uses a similar paper. Joss paper, as well as other papier-m√¢ch√© items, are also burned or buried in various Asian funerals, \\"to ensure that the spirit of the deceased has lots of good things in the afterlife.\\" In Taiwan alone, the annual revenue of temples received from burning joss paper was US$400 million (NT$13 billion) as of 2014. Traditional Jin Dynasty 265-420 AD Joss paper is traditionally made from coarse bamboo paper, which feels handmade with many variances and imperfections, although rice paper is also commonly used. Traditional joss is cut into individual squares or rectangles. Depending on the region, Joss paper may be decorated with seals, stamps, pieces of contrasting paper, engraved designs or other motifs. Different types of spirit money are given to distinct categories of spirits.Êãú Á•û Êïô ÂÆ§Á∞°‰ªãÔºöÂÜ•ÈèπÂèäË°£Á¥ôË°£Á¥ô2 ÊãúÁ•ûÁî®ÁöÑÈáëÈäÄÂÖÉÂØ∂Ë°£Á¥ôÂèäÂÖ∂‰ªñÁöÑÊéíÂàóÊ¨°Â∫è The three main types of spirit money are cash (also known as copper), silver and gold. Cash monies are given to newly deceased spirits and spirits of the unknown. Gold spirit money (jin) is given to both the deceased and higher gods such as the Jade Emperor. Silver spirit money (yin) is given exclusively to ancestral spirits as well as spirits of local deities. These distinctions between the three categories of spirit money must be followed precisely to avoid confusing or insulting the spirits. Contemporary More contemporary or westernized varieties of Joss paper include paper currency, credit cards, cheques, as well as papier-m√¢ch√© clothes, houses, cars, toiletries, electronics and servants (together known as Mandarin zh«êzhƒÅ :zh:Á¥ôÁ¥Æ). The designs on paper items vary from the very simple to very elaborate (with custom artwork and names). In 2006, in response to the burning of \\"messy sacrificial items\\", such as paper cars, houses, and pills, Dou Yupei, China's deputy minister for civil affairs, announced that the ministry intended to ban at least the more extreme forms of joss paper.A New Chinese Trend: Viagra For the Dead - March 22, 2007 - The New York Sun \\"Hell Bank Notes\\" Much like the traditional gold and silver paper, Hell Bank Notes serve as the official currency for the afterlife. Living relatives offer them to dead ancestors by burning (or placing them in coffins in the case of funerals) the bank notes as a bribe to Yanluo for a shorter stay or to escape punishment, or for the ancestors themselves to use in spending on lavish items in the afterlife. The word \\"hell\\" may have been derived from: #The preaching of Christian missionaries, who told the Chinese that non-Christians go to hell when they die. #A translation of the word \\"hell\\" that matches the pre-existing Chinese concept of \\"underground hold/court,\\" which in Taoist cosmology had been considered the one of the destinations on the journey of rebirth of every soul of the dead regardless of his or her virtue during life. Hell Bank Notes are also known for their enormous denominations ranging from $10,000 to $5,000,000,000. The bills almost always feature an image of the Jade Emperor on the front and the \\"headquarters\\" of the Hell Bank on the back. Another common feature is the signatures of both the Jade Emperor and the lord of the Underworld, both of whom apparently also serve as the Hell bank's governor and deputy governor (as featured on the back). Use Joss paper of the silver variety being folded for burning Spirit money is most often used for venerating those departed but has also been known to be used for other purposes such as a gift from a groom's family to the bride's ancestors. Spirit money has been said to have been given for the purpose of enabling their deceased family members to have all they will need or want in the afterlife. It has also been noted that these offerings have been given as a bribe to Yanluo to hold their ancestors for a shorter period of time. Woman burning joss papers in front of her house in Hanoi after having offered food to her ancestors Venerating the ancestors is based on the belief that the spirits of the dead continue to dwell in the natural world and have the power to influence the fortune and fate of the living. The goal of ancestor worship is to ensure the ancestor's continued well-being and positive disposition towards the living and sometimes to ask for special favours or assistance. Rituals of ancestor worship most commonly consist of offerings to the deceased to provide for their welfare in the afterlife which is envisioned to be similar to the earthly life. The burning of spirit money enables the ancestor to purchase luxuries and necessities needed for a comfortable afterlife. Joss paper folded and ready to be burned as an offering Many temples have large furnaces outside the main gate to burn joss paper. Folding the paper is an essential part of the burning ceremony as it distinguishes joss paper from actual money; and, it provides good luck for those who fold it. Burning actual money would be untenable for most people, and is also considered unlucky in Asian cultures. The Joss paper may be folded into specific shapes which are meant to bring on good luck and people tend to burn lavish amounts to ensure that the offering is well received. Every fifteen days business owners in Taiwan burn spirit money in red braziers and set out offering tables on the sidewalk for both gods and ghosts. This coincides with an ancient calendrical system divided into twenty-four fifteen- day periods. A simplified modern Chinese offering is made by drawing a circle with chalk on the sidewalk or the pavement between residential buildings and burning the paper offering within the circle. This is quite common in all Chinese cities and villages today. Due to environmental concerns, contemporary Joss paper burners are now fitted with a special cover which eliminates the spread of burning ashes. The cover allows enough oxygen in to ensure that all of the offering are completely burned. Spirit money is most commonly burned, but may also be offered by being held into the wind or placed into the deceased's coffin at funeral ceremonies. Depending on the type and status of the deity being worshiped, paper with metal foil or with ink seals of various sizes may be burned. Different regions of the world have different preferences for the type of Joss paper that is used. For instance, Hell Bank Notes are commonly found in regions where Cantonese populations dominate but are rarely seen or used in places such as Taiwan or Macau, which use \\"gold paper\\". The Joss paper is folded in half, or bought pre-folded into the shape of gold ingots before being burned in an earthenware pot or a specially built chimney. Joss paper burning is usually the last performed act in Chinese deity or ancestor worship ceremonies. The papers may also be folded and stacked into elaborate pagodas or lotuses. In Taoist rituals, the practice of burning joss paper to deities or ancestors is acceptable. Some Buddhist groups, such as Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Temple in Singapore, have discouraged burning joss paper out of concern for the environment.

The National Interest first published this work in an article entitled, \\"The World Trade Center Bombing: Who is Ramzi Yousef? And Why it Matters.\\" In her book Study of Revenge (2000), Mylroie laid out her argument that the Iraqi regime under Saddam Hussein had sponsored the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and subsequent terrorist attacks. She claimed those attacks were part of an ongoing war that Saddam waged against America following the cease-fire to the 1991 Gulf War. Less than a year after her book was published, the September 11 attacks occurred. Mylroie subsequently adopted the view that Saddam had been responsible for the attacks, defending it on many occasions, including before the 9/11 Commission. Mylroie's writings are considered to have been influential among neoconservatives during the buildup to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Several of them praised Study of Revenge, including ex-CIA Director James Woolsey, who called it \\"brilliant and brave\\" in his blurb for the dust jacket of the book. Mylroie has been criticized by numerous terrorism experts, including Peter Bergen, Daniel Benjamin, and Dr. Robert S. Leiken, all of whom point out that Mylroie's theories rely on dubious assumptions and were thoroughly refuted by analysts and investigators at the CIA, the FBI, the NTSB, and other investigatory bodies.Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, The Next Attack New York: Times Books, 2005, p. 145. Career Mylroie earned a bachelor's degree from Cornell University and a doctorate in Political Science from Harvard University. She also studied Arabic at the American University of Cairo. Subsequently, she taught as an Assistant Professor at Harvard University in the Department of Government (Political Science), Faculty of Arts and Science, and then as an Associate Professor in the Strategy and Policy Department of the U.S. Naval War College. She met with Bill Clinton on Iraq during Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign, but she became a strong critic of Clinton for what she came to charge was his mishandling of the terrorism that began on his watch, starting with the February 26, 1993, bombing of New York's World Trade Center. Mylroie was a research fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy and then with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, as well as an adjunct fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Following the 9/11 attacks, she served on DARPA's Special Task Force on Terrorism and Deterrence and a DTRA panel on counter-terrorism. She deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, where she served as a cultural adviser to the U.S. military. She has written three books and numerous articles, which have appeared in The American Spectator, Atlantic Monthly, Boston Globe, Commentary, The National Interest, The New Republic, Newsweek, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and Washington Times, among others. Iraq connection claims Mylroie's suspicions that Iraq was behind the World Trade Center bombing first appeared at length in an article in The National Interest, \\"The World Trade Center Bomb: Who is Ramzi Yousef? And Why it Matters.\\" Her National Interest article appeared in expanded form in Study of Revenge: Saddam Hussein's Unfinished War Against America (2000). Mylroie later claimed that \\"the Clinton White House did not want to hear that Iraq was behind the bombing.\\" Support Joseph Shattan, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, called Mylroie \\"one of America's leading students of terrorism.\\" The Washington Post's \\"Book World\\" included Study of Revenge among its \\"Expert's Picks\\" following the 9/11 attacks. The Middle East Intelligence Bulletin, reviewing Study of Revenge before 9/11, called it a \\"must read,\\" explaining, \\"This reviewer believes that Mylroie has correctly pinpointed Saddam Hussein as the source of terrorist attacks on Americans, including the World Trade Center bombing.... The Clinton administration, wittingly or unwittingly, has chosen the path of self-delusion: to not investigate the matter seriously....[T]he failure of U.S. officials to address the question of state sponsorship of terrorism will have significant future costs. It encourages future terrorist attacks by eliminating the costs of retribution from the calculations of leaders such as Saddam Hussein.\\" Criticism Mylroie has been criticized by many terrorism experts. CNN reporter Peter Bergen called Mylroie a \\"crackpot\\" and criticized her belief that \\"Saddam was not only behind the '93 Trade Center attack, but also every anti-American terrorist incident of the past decade, from the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania to the leveling of the federal building in Oklahoma City to September 11 itself.\\" Bergen states that Mylroie's argument depends entirely on Bergen goes on to state that \\"an avalanche of evidence\\" refutes Mylroie's basic assumption. Daniel Benjamin, a former Clinton administration official and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, points out that \\"Mylroie's work has been carefully investigated by the CIA and the FBI.... The most knowledgeable analysts and investigators at the CIA and at the FBI believe that their work conclusively disproves Mylroie's claims.... Nonetheless, she has remained a star in the neoconservative firmament.\\" Dr. Robert S. Leiken, a former Clinton administration official, complained: \\"Laurie has discovered Saddam‚Äôs hand in every major attack on US interests since the Persian Gulf War, including U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and even the federal building in Oklahoma City. These allegations have all been definitively refuted by the FBI, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and other investigatory bodies....\\" Daniel Pipes derided her view, saying that it was \\"a tour de force, but it's a tour de force of alchemy. It has a fundamentally wrong premise.\\" According to Andrew C. McCarthy, who prosecuted Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman in 1995, \\"Mylroie's theory was loopy... Leaving aside various other implausibilities in her surmise, the government had several sources who knew Basit as Basit both before and after the time he spent in Kuwait.\\"Still Willfully Blind After All These Years David Plotz is also among Mylroie's critics. He writes: While Angelo Codevilla, professor emeritus of international relations at Boston University, called Mylroie's book Bush vs. the Beltway \\"the best available account of the reasoning behind the conduct of the war on terror\\", he also stated \\"But it is based on a faulty premise, the one implicit in its title: that presidents neither control nor reform their bureaucracies... If all presidents are equally beset by bureaucrats, then Bush can be excused, even praised, for making U.S. policy come out no worse than it has.\\" Mylroie-McCarthy debate In 2008, Laurie Mylroie, writing in the New York Sun, reviewed Willful Blindness by Andrew C. McCarthy, who had prosecuted Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman in 1995. Mylroie explained that Rahman had not ordered the bombing of the World Trade Center‚Äînor was he charged with doing so. She also explained that other elements of the plot had been organized by Sudan, as the trial transcript made clear. She complained that McCarthy understated \\"the degree to which the extremists were penetrated by the intelligence agencies of several states.\\"Laurie Mylroie, Willful Blindness: Prosecuting the War on Terror, New York Sun, April 23, 2008. She argued that this was the basic flaw of the Clinton era handling of terrorism: it focused on the arrest and trial of perps and ignored state sponsorship. Replying on National Review Online, McCarthy accused Mylroie of misunderstanding \\"the difference between intrigue and evidence, between history and prosecution.\\" Calling Rahman \\"the central figure in the overarching conspiracy,\\" he wrote: \\"At trial, we proved that Sheikh Abdel Rahman had close ties to Hassan al-Turabi, leader in the early 1990s of Sudan's de facto government, the National Islamic Front.\\" At this point, Daniel Pipes wrote a blog entry attacking \\"Laurie Mylroie's Shoddy, Loopy, Zany Theories.\\" Stephen F. Hayes of The Weekly Standard added: \\"no one I know took her arguments very seriously.\\" Mylroie responded to McCarthy, saying that McCarthy himself had written in his book that the original case against Rahman was \\"weak\\" and so, she wrote, \\"different acts of violence, including the WTC bombing, were somewhat artificially linked\\" to strengthen the charges against him. She emphasized McCarthy's comment that Rahman was never charged with the \\"substantive crime\\" of bombing the World Trade Center.Writing Blind The debate continued in the New York Sun.Laurie Mylroie vs. Andrew McCarthy, Setting the Record Straight, New York Sun, May 8, 2008. 1980s Support for Saddam Early in her career, Mylroie advocated support for Iraq in the context of its war and rivalry with Iran. In 1988, just before the cease-fire to the Iran-Iraq war, she published an article in the journal Orbis, advocating \\"The Baghdad Alternative,\\" which involved bolstering U.S. ties to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Ken Silverstein gives this summary: :Saddam was implementing a policy of economic \\"perestroika\\" and political \\"glasnost,\\" according to Mylroie. Iraqi officials she interviewed told her that Saddam was \\"much concerned about democracy... He thinks that is healthy,\\" and she suggested this was \\"not just idle chatter.\\" From an American perspective, Mylroie concluded, \\"the more Saddam Hussein exercises control over the Baath Party, including the ideologues, the better.\\" She proposed that the Bush (Senior) Administration, already favoring Iraq against Iran, should offer Iraq more support in exchange for overt Iraqi support for U.S. Middle East policy goals. ‚ÄúIraq and the United States,‚Äù she wrote, \\"need each other.\\"Ken Silverstein, Laurie Mylroie‚Äôs Song of Saddam, Harper's, August 28, 2007, quoting Laurie Mylroie, \\"The Baghdad Alternative,\\" Orbis, Vol. 32, No. 3, Summer 1988. Isikoff and Corn write: :Mylroie continued to advocate engaging Saddam, even after the Iraqi dictator slaughtered tens of thousands of Kurds in what became known as the Anfal campaign of 1987 and 1988. In May 1989, Mylroie wrote in The Jerusalem Post that Israel and the United States should not 'poke' Iraq 'with a stick' and should refrain from tossing 'idle threats and harsh words' at Baghdad. She suggested Iraq might become a benign, if not positive, presence in the region.Michael Isikoff and David Corn, Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War (New York: Crown, 2006) p. 69. Isikoff and Corn argue that Mylroie \\"was looking to change the region through back-channel, private diplomacy ‚Äì and she aspired to be a behind-the-scenes peacemaker who would broker a deal between Saddam and Israel.\\" To this end, she met with Iraqi officials including Tariq Aziz. After Saddam's invasion of Kuwait, however, the would-be diplomat \\"turned against the dictator she had once wanted Washington to help, with the passion of one who felt personally betrayed.\\" In October 1990, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak mentioned Mylroie's trips to Baghdad and Israel, which she later denied. Isikoff and Corn, however, interviewed five of her former associates (including Judith Miller) who all \\"confirmed that she had been a secret go- between for Baghdad and Jerusalem.\\"Michael Isikoff and David Corn, Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War (New York: Crown, 2006) p. 70.

Many cultures have taboos and traditions associated with referring to the deceased, ranging from at one extreme never again speaking the person's real name, bypassing it often by way of circumlocution, to, at the other end, mass commemoration via naming other things or people after the deceased. For instance, in some cultures it is common for a newborn child to receive the name (a necronym) of a relative who has recently died, while in others to reuse such a name would be considered extremely inappropriate or even forbidden. While this varies from culture to culture, the use of necronyms is quite common.  Use  In Ashkenazi Jewish culture, it is a custom to name a child after a beloved relative who died as a way of honoring the deceased. Often the child will share the same Hebrew name as the namesake but not the given name in the vernacular language (e.g. English). In Japan, Buddhist families usually obtain a necronym, called a kaimy≈ç, for a deceased relative from a Buddhist priest in exchange for a donation to the temple. Traditionally, the deceased were thereafter referred to by the necronym, as a sign of pious respect. This name was often the only one inscribed on gravestones in the past, though now it is more common to have the necronym in addition to the given name. In Assyria and Babylonia, children were often given \\"substitute-names,\\" necronyms of deceased family members, to keep the dead's names and identities alive. Evidence suggests that the desire for children may have been motivated by the desire to pass on these necronyms. During the Cold War, necronyms were commonly used as a means of protecting an intelligence officer's true identity. For example, the Soviet KGB agent Konon Molody was only known as Gordon Lonsdale (the true Lonsdale was a Canadian born two years after Molody and died in 1943 when he was 19) in the United States. Molody adopted the name when he was 32, 11 years after the real Lonsdale's death. Historiography The practice of bestowing necronyms has sometimes caused confusion for historians. This is primarily because of the two birth certificates or records that could be present at a given time. This confusion often stems from the inability to differentiate between the records of each child. One such example is the case of Shigechiyo Izumi (1865?‚Äì1986), accepted in 1986 as the world's oldest man by The Guinness Book of World Records; it is suggested that he was possibly born in 1880 and the birth certificate of a brother whose name he assumed upon his death was submitted in place of Izumi's own.  Examples  * Composer Ludwig van Beethoven, born in 1770, had a brother named Ludwig Maria who was born in 1769 and lived for only six days. * Vincent van Gogh had a brother of the same name who was born, and died, on March 30, 1852, exactly one year before the painter's birth. * Artist Salvador Dal√≠ was born nine months and ten days after his brother, also named Salvador, died from gastroenteritis at the age of one year and nine months. * NASCAR driver John Hunter Nemechek was named after his uncle John Nemechek, who died in a crash at Homestead-Miami Speedway about three months before John Hunter was born.

The investor would take into account the tax treatment of negative gearing, which may generate additional benefits to the investor in the form of tax benefits if the loss on a negatively geared investment is tax-deductible against the investor's other taxable income and if the capital gain on the sale is given a favourable tax treatment. Overview Negative gearing is often discussed with regard to real estate, where rental income is less than mortgage loan interest costs, but may also apply to shares in companies whose dividend income falls short of interest costs on a margin loan. The tax treatment may or may not be the same between the two. Positive gearing occurs when one borrows to invest in an income-producing asset and the returns (income) from that asset exceed the cost of borrowing. From then on, the investor must pay tax on the rental income profit until the asset is sold, when point the investor must pay capital gains tax on any profit. When the income generated covers the interest, it is simply a geared investment, which creates passive income. A negative gearing strategy makes a profit under any of the following circumstances: *if the asset rises in value so that the capital gain is more than the sum of the ongoing losses over the life of the investment; *if the income stream rises to become greater than the cost of interest (the investment becomes positively geared); or *if the interest cost falls because of lower interest rates or paying down the loan principal, making the investment positively geared. The investor must be able to fund any shortfall until the asset is sold or until the investment becomes positively geared. The different tax treatment of planned ongoing losses and possible future capital gains affects the investor's final return. In countries that tax capital gains at a lower rate than income, it is possible for an investor to make a loss overall before taxation but a small gain after taxpayer subsidies. Some countries, including Australia and Japan, allow unrestricted use of negative gearing losses to offset income from other sources. Several other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, including the United States of America, New Zealand, Germany, Sweden, Canada, and France, allow loss offsetting with some restrictions. Applying tax deductions from negatively geared investment housing to other income is not permitted in the United Kingdom or the Netherlands.\\"Quarantining Interest Deductions for Negatively Geared Rental Property Investments\\" [2005] With respect to investment decisions and market prices, other taxes such as stamp duties and capital gains tax may be more or less onerous in those countries, increasing or decreasing the attractiveness of residential property as an investment.Housing and Housing Finance: The View from Australia and Beyond, RBA [2006] A negatively-geared investment property will generally remain negatively geared for several years, when the rental income will have increased with inflation to the point that the investment is positively geared (the rental income is greater than the interest cost). The tax treatment of negative gearing (also termed \\"rental loss offset against other income\\") varies. For example: * the United States restricts the practice to lower/middle income taxpayers who are active in managing their rental investment and also allows interest costs against the family home to be fully tax deductible. * Canada limits the practice by ensuring the investment generated a positive return over its life. * countries with lower tax rates have a lower benefit from negative gearing due to a lower top rate of tax or a higher threshold for a specific tax rate. Taxation implications of negative gearing by country Australia Negative gearing can be a tax-effective strategy in Australia, because the tax system has a single income tax schedule for income from all sources. This means that for taxation purposes net investment income losses can be offset against other types of income, such as wage or business income, with only a few limits or restrictions. Negative gearing continues to be a controversial political issue in Australia and was a major issue during the 2016 Australian federal election and the 2019 Australian federal election, during which the Australian Labor Party proposed to eliminate the tax-deductibility of negative gearing losses against non- investment income (with some exceptions), and to halve the capital gains tax discount to 25%. Analysis found that negative gearing in Australia provides a greater benefit to wealthier Australians than the less wealthy. Federal Treasurer at the time, Scott Morrison, in defence of negative gearing, cited tax data that showed that numerous middle income groups (he mentioned teachers, nurses, and electricians) benefit in larger numbers from negative gearing than finance managers. United Kingdom While allowing for negative gearing in its basic form, the United Kingdom does not allow the transfer of one type of income (or loss) to another type of income. This is due to its schedular system of taxation. In this type of taxation system, the tax paid is dependent on income source. Therefore, an individual who received an income from labour and from land would pay two separate tax rates for the two relevant income sources. Between 1997 and 2007, the Tax Law Rewrite Project changed this system by simplifying the schedules. As with the previous system, people would not be allowed to transfer incomes (or losses). A UK government online resource on renting out property in England and WalesRenting out your property (England and Wales) outlines how to offset losses. It states that losses can be offset against \\"future profits by carrying it forward to a later year\\" or against \\"profits from other properties (if you have them)\\". New Zealand New Zealand allows negative gearing and the transfer of losses to other income streams, with some restrictions.Harcourts - \\"Negative Gearing\\" Explained The Rental Income Guide IRD - Rental income IR264 states a loss can only be deducted against other incomes if the rental income is at market rate. The Opposition Labour Party attempted to raise negative gearing in the 2011 election, but after their failure to win government the issue reduced in significance.NZ moves to quarantine negative gearing New Zealand now has ring-fencing rules, abolishing negative gearing in the residential property market. Residential property deductions can only be made against residential property income and cannot be deducted from income from other sources, e.g. wages. Canada In principle, Canada does not allow the transfer of income streams. However, the most current Canadian tax form indicates this can occur in some circumstances.Investopedia - Negative Gearing According to \\"Line 221 - Carrying charges and interest expenses\\", interest payments from an investment designed to generate an income can be deducted: > Claim the following carrying charges and interest you paid to earn income > from investments: [...] Most interest you pay on money you borrow for > investment purposes, but generally only if you use it to try to earn > investment income, including interest and dividends. However, if the only > earnings your investment can produce are capital gains, you cannot claim the > interest you paid.CRA Line 221 - Carrying charges and interest expenses Other sources indicate the deduction must be reasonable and that people should contact the Canada Revenue Agency for more information. The \\"Rental Income Includes Form T776\\" states people can deduce rental losses from other sources of income: \\"You have a rental loss if your rental expenses are more than your gross rental income. If you incur the expenses to earn income, you can deduct your rental loss against your other sources of income.\\" However, there is a caveat: the rental loss must be reasonable. What is reasonable is not defined in the \\"Rental Income Includes Form T776\\" Guide. Based on these sources, claiming rental losses against other incomes in a given year is allowed as long as a profit is made over the life of the investment, excluding the effects of capital gains. Canada has a Federal and Provincial income tax, and the above only relates to Federal income tax. United States In principle, the US federal tax does not allow the transfer of income streams.IRS Topic 414 - Rental Income and Expenses In general, taxpayers can only deduct expenses of renting property from their rental income, as renting property out is usually considered a passive activity. However, if renters are considered to have actively participated in the activities, they can claim deductions from rental losses against their other \\"nonpassive income\\". A definition of \\"active participation\\" is outlined in the \\"Reporting Rental Income, Expenses, and Losses\\" guide:IRS Reporting Rental Income, Expenses, and Losses > You actively participated in a rental real estate activity if you (and your > spouse) owned at least 10% of the rental property and you made management > decisions or arranged for others to provide services (such as repairs) in a > significant and bona fide sense. Management decisions that may count as > active participation include approving new tenants, deciding on rental > terms, approving expenditures, and other similar decisions. It is possible to deduct any loss against other incomes, depending on a range of factors.Rental Income and Expenses - Tips for Schedule E Japan Japan allows tax payers to offset rental losses against other income.Authorities challenge real estate loss deduction Individuals can claim losses against rental loss with minimal restrictions,Analysis of Income (use for real estable income) but if the property was owned through a partnership or trust there are restrictions.The Japanese taxation of real estate income for individuals There are a number of additional rules, such as restricting claims of losses due to Bad Debt. Additional information can be found in the Japan Tax Site.The Japan tax Site Germany The German tax system is complex, but within the bounds of standard federal income tax, Germany does not allow the transfer of income. Rental losses can only be offset against rental income.Rental income tax is high in Germany As stated on the Global Property Guide site, \\"Owners can deduct any expenses from the gross receipts, which were incurred to produce, maintain and safeguard that income.\\" Germany recognizes seven sources of income:The German tax System # Agriculture and forestry # Trade and business # Independent personal services # Employment # Capital investment # Rents and royalties # \\"other income\\", as specified and strictly limited by law to certain types of income such as income from private transactions and income of a recurring nature (e.g. pensions) The income from each of these sources is calculated separately. Rental income is taxed as income and is subject to the progressive tax rate. Interest on loans provided to finance real estate, expenses, and property-related cost (e.g., management fees, insurance) can be deducted from the taxable rental income.German Tax Overview Netherlands In principle, the Dutch tax system does not allow the transfer of income. Most citizens calculate tax, separately, in 3 income groups:Taxation and Investment in Netherlands 2015 # Box 1 income includes income from employment and income from the primary residence # Box 2 income, which includes income from a substantial holding in a company, as well as gains from substantial shareholdings # Box 3 deals with income from savings and investments Dutch resident and non-resident companies and partnerships owning Dutch property are in principle allowed to deduct interest expenses on loans from banks or affiliated companies, and property-related costs from their taxable income.Real Estate Going Global Netherlands See also * Debt * Financial engineering * Leveraged buyout * Rent seeking References External links * Negative Gearing Issue Sheet for the 2004 Australian federal election * Australian Taxation Office Rental Properties Guide 2005, product NAT 1729-6.2005 * Real Estate Institute of Australia Policy Statement on Negative Gearing, as of October 2005 * Negative Gearing‚ÄîA Commentary on how it works and who it is suited to * Negative Gearing ‚Äî A Brief Overview of Negative Gearing In Australia and why people choose to do it: (Accountants, Caringbah Sydney, Australia) * Australian Democrats Negative Gearing Issue Sheet for the 2004 Election (PDF) * Australian Taxation Office Rental Properties Guide 2005, product NAT 1729-6.2005 * Real Estate Institute of Australia Policy Statement on Negative Gearing, as of October 2005 * Negative gearing: The three facts that will challenge your assumptions, Property Observer, 2013 Category:Real estate in Australia Category:Investment Category:Negative concepts Category:Real estate investing ","title":"Negative gearing"},{"id":"561586","text":"Yanjing can refer to: * Yanjing (Ááï‰∫¨ yƒÅnjƒ´ng) the ancient capital of the State of Yan, former name of Beijing * An alternative name for Nanjing (Liao Dynasty), the name for Beijing during the Liao dynasty (907‚Äì1125) * Yanjing Beer * A fictional analog of China in Tamora Pierce's Emelan universe. * Yanjing, Li County (Áõê‰∫ïÈïá), a town in Li County, Hunan Province, China ","title":"Yanjing (disambiguation)"},{"id":"561588","text":"The British Railways Board (BRB) was a nationalised industry in the United Kingdom that operated from 1963 to 2001. Until 1997 it was responsible for most railway services in Great Britain, trading under the brand name British Railways and, from 1965, British Rail. It did not operate railways in Northern Ireland, where railways were the responsibility of the Government of Northern Ireland. It is a statutory corporation, which when operating consisted of a chairman and nine to fifteen other members appointed by the Secretary of State for Transport. The Board, now reduced to a minimum membership of a chairman and one other member, continues to exist to hold the French law benefits and obligations of the Channel Tunnel Rail Usage Contract. Formation The BRB was created on 1 January 1963 under the Transport Act 1962 by Harold Macmillan's Conservative government to inherit the railway responsibilities of the British Transport Commission, which was dissolved at the same time.Bonavia, pp. 116‚Äì117 Operations Initially, and for the majority of its history, the BRB operated under the structure inherited from the BTC Railway Executive. Operations were divided into five regions - Eastern, London Midland, Western, Southern and Scottish (later rebranded ScotRail). A North Eastern Region existed initially but was merged into the Eastern Region in 1967. In the 1980s the BRB moved to a sectoral model based on business activity - InterCity for long-distance passenger trains, Network SouthEast for commuter trains in London, and Regional Railways for short-distance and commuter trains outside the Network SouthEast area. Railfreight was organised separately. As well as the railway network, for much of its history the BRB also ran ferry services (later as Sealink) and hotels. These were sold in the 1980s. The final BRB structure (1994-1997) was a shadow form of the future privatised railway industry, becoming a holding company for over 100 subsidiaries, including 25 passenger train operating, six freight, three rolling stock leasing, and a number of track maintenance companies. These were slowly sold during privatisation (the passenger subsidiaries were franchised to private sector concerns). Winding down On 1 April 1994 railway infrastructure became the responsibility of public limited company Railtrack, initially Government owned. The BRB continued to operate all trains until 1996, when the process of transferring them to the private sector began. Privatisation was completed in 1997, but the BRB continued to discharge residual functions relating to non-operational railway land and BR pensions, and to have responsibility for the British Transport Police. In 1999 Alistair Morton was appointed the last chairman of the BRB, which began to advise on passenger railway matters. During this time it operated with the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising under the trading name of the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority. Under the Transport Act 2000 the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising was abolished and the majority of BRB's functions were transferred to the Strategic Rail Authority's wholly owned subsidiary BRB (Residuary) Limited. In 2001 the minimum membership of the Board itself was reduced to the chairman and one other member. With the dissolution of the SRA under the Railways Act 2005, BRB (Residuary) became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Secretary of State for Transport. While the Transport Act allowed for BRB to be abolished, the Board's remaining function is to hold the French law benefits and obligations of the Channel Tunnel Rail Usage Contract on trust for the Secretary of State for Transport. In this function it has outlived its own residuary company, which was wound up on until 30 September 2013, pursuant to the Public Bodies review. Through its subsidiary Rail Property Ltd, BRB (Residuary) retained responsibility for non-operational railway land, for example railway lines closed in the Beeching Axe that have not been sold. The BRB owned a large amount of archive material, including papers, maps, films and photographs, dating back before nationalisation. In 1997 these were distributed to other bodies: films (the bulk of which had been produced by British Transport Films) to the British Film Institute in London, photographs to the National Railway Museum (NRM) in York, and most papers to the Public Record Office.

Excess air escapes passively through designed outlets. Positive pressure is a pressure within a system that is greater than the environment that surrounds that system. Consequently, if there is any leak from the positively pressured system it will egress into the surrounding environment. This is in contrast to a negative pressure room, where air is sucked in. Use is also made of positive pressure to ensure there is no ingress of the environment into a supposed closed system. A typical example of the use of positive pressure is the location of a habitat in an area where there may exist flammable gases such as found on an oil platform or laboratory cleanroom. This kind of positive pressure is also used on operating theaters and in vitro fertilisation (IVF) labs. Hospitals may have positive pressure rooms for patients with compromised immune systems. Air will flow out of the room instead of in, so that any airborne microorganisms (e.g., bacteria) that may infect the patient are kept away. This process is important in human and chick development. Positive pressure, created by the closure of anterior and posterior neuropores of the neural tube during neurulation, is a requirement of brain development.

Its general duty under the Transport Act 1947 was to provide an efficient, adequate, economical and properly integrated system of public inland transport and port facilities within Great Britain for passengers and goods, excluding transport by air. The BTC came into operation on 1 January 1948. Its first chairman was Lord Hurcomb, with Miles Beevor as Chief Secretary. Its main holdings were the networks and assets of the Big Four national regional railway companies: the Great Western Railway, London and North Eastern Railway, London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway. It also took over 55 other railway undertakings, 19 canal undertakings and 246 road haulage firms, as well as the work of the London Passenger Transport Board, which was already publicly owned. The nationalisation package also included the fleets of 'private owner wagons', which industrial concerns had used to transport goods on the railway networks. Organisation The BTC was one of the largest industrial organisations in the world, at one time employing nearly 688,000 people. At first, the Commission did not directly operate transport services, which were the responsibility of the Commission's Executives. These bodies were separately appointed, and operated under what were termed 'schemes of delegation'. The Act provided for five Executives, covering Docks & Inland Waterways, Hotels, London Transport, Railways, and Road Transport. The Railway Executive traded as \\"British Railways\\". In 1949, Road Transport was divided into separate Road Haulage and Road Passenger Executives, though the latter proved short-lived. The Commission's extensive activities included: * British Transport Advertising sold space on premises and vehicles. * Buses: the Tilling Group sold its bus interests to the BTC in September 1948, as did the Red and White Group in 1950. Midland General buses and trolleybuses were transferred by the British Electricity Authority. From the railway companies, the BTC also inherited non-controlling interests in many bus companies in the British Electric Traction Group. It also manufactured buses for its own use, through the subsidiaries Bristol Tramways (from 1955 Bristol Commercial Vehicles) and Eastern Coach Works. In London and the surrounding area, the BTC ran both the (red) London buses and the (green) country buses, including Green Line Coaches. * Docks: British Transport Docks (today known as Associated British Ports), comprising 32 ports taken over from the railway companies. * Films: the BTC had its own film production company, British Transport Films. * Hotels & Catering: the former railway hotels and catering departments initially came under the control of the Railway Executive, but on 1 July 1948 they were transferred to the Hotels Executive. Between 1953 and 1963, they operated as British Transport Hotel and Catering Services; and in 1963 it became the British Transport Hotels. * Museums: The BTC inherited the LNER's Railway Museum at York and appointed a Curator of Historical Relics to build up a national collection. Eventually, much of this collection was displayed at the Museum of British Transport at Clapham, south London. This closed in the early 1970s and was superseded by the National Railway Museum at York and the London Transport Museum (now in Covent Garden). The BTC also established the Stoke Bruerne Canal Museum. * Police: the British Transport Commission Police (BTCP) ‚Äì see British Transport Police for details and dates ‚Äì was formed chiefly by the amalgamation of the various railway constabularies. * Railways: British Railways, including ancillary activities like engineering workshops, and London Underground. The former LMS lines in Northern Ireland (see Northern Counties Committee) were sold to the Ulster Transport Authority in 1949. * Road Haulage: the local road distribution networks of the pre-nationalisation rail companies, plus the removals company Pickfords, which the railways had owned jointly. To these were added numerous smaller independent concerns taken over at nationalisation, comprising all undertakings predominantly engaged in ordinary long-distance work for distances of or upwards. These networks were later re-organised as British Road Services (BRS). * Shipping: the former railway steamer services, primarily to France and Ireland and around the Scottish coast, and investments in Associated Humber Lines and the Atlantic Steam Navigation Company. * Tramways: the South London tramways of London Transport, all of which were abandoned by 5 July 1952. * Travel & Holidays: the travel agents Thomas Cook & Son. * Waterways: canals and navigable rivers, mainly taken over from canal companies, like the Grand Union Canal Carrying Company and Fellows Morton and Clayton, but also including those bought out earlier by the pre-nationalisation railways. The Caledonian Canal was already state-owned. The canals are today run by the Canal and River Trust and Scottish Canals. As well as the canal infrastructure, BTC also managed canal carrying services. The Commission was permitted to \\"secure the provision\\" of road passenger services, although it did not have the general powers of compulsory purchase of bus operators. To obtain specific powers of acquisition it had first to draw up, and get approval for, a 'Road Scheme', area by area. Only one was published, the North East Area Road Scheme, though work began on a second scheme, covering East Anglia. The NEARS was never confirmed, as it was fiercely opposed by private and municipal operators. The quasi-federal structure of Commission and Executives proved to be an obstacle to integration and was largely abolished by the Conservative government with effect from 1 October 1953 (the London Transport Executive alone survived). On 1 January 1955, the railways were re-organised on the basis of six Area Railway Boards, which had a wide measure of operational autonomy under the Commission's overall supervision. The Commission took direct charge of the remaining assets, though these were significantly reduced by the Conservatives de- nationalising much of the road haulage sector. On 1 January 1955, separate managements were also set up for road haulage, hotels, docks and inland waterways. Abolition By the late 1950s the BTC was in serious financial difficulties, largely due to the economic performance of the railways. It was criticised as an overly bureaucratic system of administering transport services and had failed to develop an integrated transport system (such as integrated ticketing and timetabling). It was abolished by Harold Macmillan's Conservative government under the Transport Act 1962 and replaced by five successor bodies: *British Railways Board (railways, hotels and some shipping) *British Transport Docks Board (docks) *British Waterways Board (inland waterways) *London Transport Board (London buses and the London Underground) *Transport Holding Company (remaining interests, in shipping, travel and road transport) These changes took effect on 1 January 1963. Notwithstanding the abolition of the BTC, the British Transport Police continues to exist, and the BTC heraldic shield is still displayed on the force's badge.

It provided for the restructuring of the British Railways Board (BRB), the public corporation that owned and operated the national railway system. A few residual responsibilities of the BRB remained with BRB (Residuary) Ltd. Background While the administration of Margaret Thatcher had not done so, the Major government were determined to privatise British Rail. Railways in the 18th and 19th Centuries had originally been built and run with private capital, but subsidised heavily by Parliament and communities who gave land for building through compulsory purchase. Rail was increasingly regulated, for instance under the Railways Act 1921, but was finally nationalised by the Transport Act 1947. Calls for reform of the nationalised system combined with people who believed only the private sector could run rail to ensure better service for passengers at cheaper cost. This led to the Railways Act 1993. Contents The legislation created a new regulatory regime for the railways, with the establishment of the Rail Regulator (dealing with the monopoly and dominant elements of the industry, principally Railtrack (now Network Rail)) and the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising, whose role was to sell passenger rail franchises to the private sector. The Director of Passenger Rail Franchising was replaced in 2001 by the Strategic Rail Authority. When the SRA was abolished in 2006 franchising were taken over by the Secretary of State for Transport. The statutory position of Rail Regulator was abolished in July 2004 and his functions were taken over by the Office of Rail Regulation. Consequences The legislation enabled the Secretary of State for Transport John MacGregor to transfer separated parts of the railway to the private sector. Passenger rail services were franchised to private companies including Virgin Rail Group, Connex (later known as Veolia Transport) and the coach companies Stagecoach and National Express, and the national railway track and signalling company Railtrack was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. British Rail's track maintenance and renewal operations were sold to private companies, with contracts to provide infrastructure services to Railtrack. The three rolling stock leasing companies or ROSCOs, owners of the passenger rolling stock, were sold to management buyout teams. Railtrack Railtrack collapsed in highly controversial circumstances in October 2001, and in October 2002 the company emerged from railway administration, a special state of insolvency for railway companies created by the Railways Act 1993, as Network Rail. Some commentators regard the creation of Network Rail and its taking maintenance in-house as the beginning of the reversal of rail privatisation. Amendments The legislation has been amended several times, most significantly by the Transport Act 2000, the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 and the Railways Act 2005.

The game was developed by the Canadian company DICE Canada and published by Electronic Arts. Battlefield Vietnam takes place during the Vietnam War and features a large variety of maps based on historical settings, such as the Ho Chi Minh Trail, Battle of Hue, Ia Drang Valley, Operation Flaming Dart, the Battle of Khe Sanh and Fall of Saigon. On 15 March 2005, EA re-released the game as Battlefield Vietnam: Redux, which includes new vehicles, maps, and an EA-produced World War II mod, based on the previous Battlefield 1942. Gameplay Battlefield Vietnam has the same point by point objectives of Battlefield 1942; in most maps, the objective is to take Control Points around the map to enable friendly players and controllable vehicles to spawn. Like other Battlefield games, Spawn tickets play a vital role for defeat of a Team. Battlefield Vietnam features a revolutionary form of asymmetrical warfare gameplay. The two teams (U.S. or North Vietnamese) are given wildly different kits and vehicles, making the U.S. rely more on heavy vehicles and the Vietnamese rely more on infantry tactics. The U.S., for instance, will get heavy tanks, helicopters, and bombers, while the Vietnamese are forced to rely on anti-tank/anti-aircraft weapons in order to stop the U.S. side. This gameplay was intended to reflect the actual conditions of the war. A \\"Sipi Hole\\" feature for the Vietnamese ‚Äì effectively a mobile spawn point, representative of the vast tunnel networks the Vietnamese used in the actual war ‚Äì was implemented in order to balance the gameplay.https://www.ibtimes.com/battlefield-vietnam-celebrates-ten-year- anniversary-ea-dice-discusses-iconic-game-1561853 Battlefield Vietnam features the United States, with Marines, Army and the Navy, South Vietnam with Army of the Republic of Vietnam and North Vietnam with the Viet Cong. Built on a modified Battlefield 1942 engine, Battlefield Vietnam has many new and improved features from its predecessor. The game gives the player a variety of weapons based on the war. Various contemporary weapons and concepts are featured such as the AK47 assault rifle and punji stick traps. It also has several additions to it, such as air-lifting vehicles and, while in a vehicle, playing the vehicle's radio, which featured 1960s music. Players can replace the vehicle soundtrack with their own music tracks. Players are able to fire from the passenger sides of vehicles, rather than leaving the player defenseless. The game is the first in the Battlefield series to utilize a 3D map, allowing players to see icons that represent the position of control points or friendly units, giving the player an increased situational awareness. Reception In June 2004, Battlefield Vietnam received a \\"Gold\\" certification from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland, indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Overall sales of Battlefield Vietnam reached 990,000 copies by that November, by which time the Battlefield series had sold 4.4 million copies.

In general, hymns in the central text of the Sikhs, the Guru Granth Sahib, are called Gurbani. Among Amritdhari Sikhs, a few texts from Dasam Granth which are read as Nitnem, like Tav-Prasad Savaiye and Chaupai, are also considered Gurbani. In Adi Granth, Gurbani is a sound which comes directly from the Supreme and the text is a written form of the same in worldly language and scripts. It is also called Guru¬¥s Bani.‡®ú‡®®‡©Å ‡®®‡®æ‡®®‡®ï‡©Å ‡®¨‡©ã‡®≤‡©á ‡®ó‡©Å‡®£ ‡®¨‡®æ‡®£‡©Ä ‡®ó‡©Å‡®∞‡®¨‡®æ‡®£‡©Ä ‡®π‡®∞‡®ø ‡®®‡®æ‡®Æ‡®ø ‡®∏‡®Æ‡®æ‡®á‡®Ü ‡••‡©™‡••‡©´‡•• Servant Nanak chants the Glorious Words of the Guru's Bani; through them, one is absorbed into the Naam, the Name of the Lord. 45: Page 494, M5 Gurbani are explanations of qualities of the Primal Lord and Soul which a Sikh should comprehend and with which he can attain the supreme state. Sikh historical writings, unauthentic writings or apocryphal compositions written under the names of Sikh Gurus and other writings by Sikhs are not considered Gurbani and are referred to as Kachi Bani.The Sikh Encyclopedia: APOCRYPHAL COMPOSITIONS Etymology Gurbani is composed of two words: 'Gur' and 'Bani'. Gur has multiple meanings depending on context. In Guru Granth Sahib, Gur is used for multiple meanings, as per context of hymn. The common use of Gur is either for wisdom and internal conscious mind (referred to as Chitta or Antar Atma).‡®ó‡©Å‡®∞‡®¨‡®æ‡®£‡©Ä ,Mahankosh, Bhai Kahn Singh Nabha Thereby Gurbani either means the speech of wisdom or the speech of conscious mind. Gurbani is directly received from inside after attaining a Supreme state, whereas the Granth or textual form is worldly language of the same. Gurbani is also referred to as Dhur Ki Bani (the speech from the Supreme house). In Adi Granth, it is considered a source of spiritual knowledge which illuminates the mind and gives internal bliss. The one who comprehends Gurbani is also described as an Amritdhari. Gurbani is a source of truth with which the internal filth and sins get eradicated and one who find Gurbani sweet is in supreme state. Extracts from Guru Granth Sahib are called Gutkas (small books) containing sections of Gurbani. These Gutkas can vary from just a few pages to hundreds of pages and are used by the Sikhs to read these Banis on a daily basis. Nitnem compositions right The hymns of the Japji Sahib, Jaap Sahib, Tav- Prasad Savaiye, Chaupai Sahib and Anand Sahib should be read before sunrise daily according to the Sikh Rehat Maryada. These are recited by initiated Sikhs at Amritvela (before 6 AM). Rehras is read in the evening around sunset or after a day's work and finally Kirtan Sohila is read before going to bed. Doing Nitnem is also commonly referred as doing paath. Japji Sahib, Anand Sahib, and Kirtan Sohila are a part of Guru Granth Sahib. Jaap Sahib, Tav- Prasad Savaiye, and Chaupai Sahib were all compiled by Guru Gobind Singh and found in the Dasam Granth. Rehras is a mix with hymns from both Guru Granth Sahib and Dasam Granth. A Sikh may add more Gurbani to their Nitnem and if done frequently that Gurbani becomes a part of their Nitnem.

He is a member of the Liberal National Party of Queensland, and sits with the Liberal Party in federal parliament. Early life Entsch was born in Babinda, Queensland and served in the Royal Australian Air Force 1969‚Äì78. He was a railway porter, maintenance fitter and welder, real estate agent, farmer, grazier, crocodile catcher and company director before entering politics. In his time outside of Parliament between 2007 and 2010, Entsch worked as an independent Director on the board of CEC Group, a Cairns-based property development company, and a Director of the Australian Rainforest Foundation, a Cairns-based organisation focussing on the Daintree Rainforest. Politics Entsch was first elected to the House of Representatives at the March 1996 federal election. He was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources 1998‚Äì2001 and was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources from 2001 to 2006. He then decided on retirement, principally to spend time with his teenage son and did not contest the November 2007 election. He was a member of the Liberal Party of Queensland until the formation of the Liberal National Party of Queensland in 2008. On 10 November 2009, Entsch announced that he would again run for pre-selection for the seat of Leichhardt and was re-elected to parliament at the August 2010 election defeating the man who had succeeded him in 2007, Labor incumbent Jim Turnour. Entsch was subsequently appointed Chief Opposition Whip by then- opposition leader Tony Abbott. At the 2016 federal election Entsch was re- elected with 39.4% of first- preference votes marking his seventh election victory in 20 years. He was again re-elected at the 2019 Australian federal election with 37.6% of first-preference votes.https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/federal/2019/guide/leic He was shortly after appointed to the position of \\"special envoy to the Great Barrier Reef\\" by Prime Minister Scott Morrison.https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6182558/only-one-envoy-and- its-not-barnaby-joyce/?cs=14231 He vowed to focus his efforts in this role on the issue of plastic pollution on the reef, asserting that climate change was not a threat to the existence of the Great Barrier Reef.https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/great-barrier- reef-envoy-warren-entsch-will-focus-on-plastics/11159002 https://www.sbs.com.au/news/new-reef-envoy-warren-entsch-takes-aim-at- coaching-of-kids-over-climate-change By the end of 2019 Entsch acknowledged climate change and its impact as a serious threat to the Great Barrier Reef. In his December 2019 report to environment minister Sussan Ley he stated \\"Global climage change looms as the most serious existential threat to the long-term health and viability of the Reef.\\" https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/9493b41b-8484-47e1-8338-dbae75c6f92e/files/report- minister-ley-special-envoy.pdf Support for same sex marriage In September 2004, Entsch publicly spoke against his party's anti-gay-marriage stance, describing laws to prevent gay marriage as \\"offensive\\" and \\"unnecessary\\". As a result of his pro-gay statements, the Family First Party ‚Äì which preferenced Liberal/National Coalition candidates ahead of Labor candidates in almost every other seat, nationwide ‚Äì directed their preferences to Labor instead of Entsch. Nevertheless, he won re-election with an increased majority of both the primary and two-party-preferred vote. In December 2005, he pledged support for a civil union scheme after Britain began granting civil partnerships. He was interviewed for The Pink Broad (Issue 15, published Wednesday 22 February 2006), a fortnightly gay and lesbian newspaper, in which he confirmed that he planned to sponsor a private member's bill in Federal Parliament within months that promised to eradicate discrimination and the inequities faced by Australia's gay and lesbian population under Federal law. His plan did not eventuate. In September 2010 Entsch indicated that he did not consider same- sex marriage an important issue and voted against the Australian Greens 2010 motion for members of the house to poll their constituents on the issue of same-sex marriage. Two years later he voted against a bill sponsored by Labor‚Äôs Stephen Jones that would have legalised same-sex marriage. On 17 August 2015, in defiance of Prime Minister Abbott, Entsch introduced a private members' bill to legalise same-sex marriage in Australia, saying, \\"The main purpose of this bill is not a complex one. It is to give same-sex couples in Australia the same right to marry the person they love as that which is currently only granted by law to heterosexual couples. This bill is designed to promote an inclusive Australia, not a divided one. A divided nation is what we will be if we continue to allow discrimination in relation to marriage on the basis of a person's sexuality.\\" Abbott instructed his party room to not vote in favour of the bill; it was defeated. On 7 December 2017, Entsch spoke in favour of and voted for, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill that enabled same-sex marriage in Australia, following the plebiscite introduced by then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. In May 2018, in his re-election victory speech, claimed his own success in the legalisation of same-sex marriage: \\"I've been very successful in campaigning for national change. Medical cannabis was one that I was able to successfully implement, the other was same-sex marriage, which I'm very proud of.\\"Cairns Post, 20 May 2019, page 2 See also *Recognition of same-sex unions in Australia References External links *Warren Entsch, Federal Member for Leichhardt *Entsch Returns to Politics *Warren Entsch wins Leichhardt for LNP Category:1950 births Category:Australian farmers Category:Australian people of German descent Category:Australian real estate agents Category:Living people Category:LGBT rights activists from Australia Category:Liberal Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Liberal National Party of Queensland members of the Parliament of Australia Category:People from Far North Queensland Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives for Leichhardt Category:21st-century Australian politicians Category:20th- century Australian politicians ","title":"Warren Entsch"},{"id":"561619","title":"Exit...

Located in Westmount, Quebec, Canada, it is an anglophone college with a student body over 2,000. The General and Vocational Education College, known as a CEGEP, is affiliated with the Association des coll√®ges priv√©s du Qu√©bec (ACPQ), Association of Canadian Community Colleges (ACCC) and Canadian Colleges Athletic Association (CCAA). Campus The college's current site is at 4873 Westmount Ave in Westmount, between Vend√¥me and Villa-Maria metro stations. The current campus contains 12 wings and includes two gyms, one fitness center, one dance studio, over four computer labs, and multiple science laboratories. Furthermore, the library was renovated in the summer of 2013 and once again in the winter of 2018, now offering a more open workspace for students with improved ventilation. A cafeteria is present on campus, as well as the general convenience store \\"Wayne's World\\". The campus also includes a large auditorium suited for conferences, concerts and presentations. Prior to April 2007, it was situated at 3880 C√¥te-des-Neiges, which has been converted into a luxury apartment project known as \\"M sur la Montagne\\". Programs The college offers pre-university programs (not to be confused with community colleges in other provinces or in the U.S.A), which take two years to complete and cover the subject matters which roughly correspond to the additional year of high school given elsewhere in Canada and introductory first-year university curriculum in preparation for a chosen field in university. Accordingly, graduates may, in certain circumstances, receive advance credit of up to one full year in some disciplines when enrolling in universities outside the province of Quebec. However, Marianopolis does not offer technical (skilled trade) programs, nor adult (continuing) education, unlike many other colleges. While the college primarily offers two-year pre-university programs leading to a Diploma of Collegial Studies (DEC), several three-year double-DEC programs are also available. These programs allow students to combine music with Science, Social Science or Arts. History Marianopolis College at new location Marianopolis College at its previous C√¥te-des-Neiges location, prior to fall 2007 The school was founded in 1908 by the Notre-Dame Congregation as the bilingual Notre Dame Ladies College, the first institution of higher learning for English-speaking Catholic women in Quebec. Initially, it offered degrees through Universit√© Laval, the first being offered three years after the college's founding. The degree-granting agreement was later transferred to Universit√© de Montr√©al. In 1926, the school was renamed Marguerite Bourgeoys College. During the World War II era, the English sector of the college was reorganized to be in line with anglophone universities, including programs in general science and honours chemistry. It changed its name to Marianopolis College. In 1967, several institutions were merged and became public ones, when the Quebec system of colleges was created. Changes to the education system in Quebec caused Marianopolis to adopt a college-level program in 1969. The college also began accepting male students during this time. The degree- granting program was eventually phased out in 1972. In 1975 the college relocated from 3647 Rue Peel to a larger campus, and site of the former S√©minaire de Philosophie, at 3880 C√¥te des Neiges.http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/marianopolishistory.htm Although the college remains under the authority of the Congregation of Notre- Dame, students of all faiths are admitted and the curriculum and school experience are entirely secular. Campus life and environment Congress and clubs The student life at Marianopolis is supported by MSU (Marianopolis Student Union) Congress, the student government. Congress consists of a President and a Vice-President of Administrative Affairs, as well as a Vice-President of Finance and ten other coordinators, each one focusing on a specific domain. The President, Vice-President and six other members of Congress are elected by the student body at Marianopolis College; the remaining five positions are appointed. Many major events and activities regarding the ensemble of the students are organized by Congress, such events include Halloween celebrations, health week, Valentine's Day activities, and so forth. Students may freely create their own club to practice hobbies with other fellow students or to simply attract people of similar interests together. Currently, there are approximately 100 clubs within the college ranging from dance clubs to Computer science club to Tea club. These clubs coordinate activities and meetings between members and some also benefit from Congress' monetary financing. Athletics The Marianopolis College athletes go by the name of the Demons. They are involved in multiple competitive sports such as volleyball, basketball, and rugby. These teams play within the RSEQ sports league. Some student clubs also practice various other sports such as rowing, dragon boat, skiing, and tennis. Furthermore, the fitness center and gymnasium are open to students during certain hours during the week for them to work out. Academic programs Each Marianopolis student is required to complete a set of general courses in addition to those required by the program into which they have been admitted.

Along with her contemporaries Martha Graham and Katherine Dunham, Humphrey was one of the second generation modern dance pioneers who followed their forerunners ‚Äì including Isadora Duncan, Ruth St. Denis, and Ted Shawn ‚Äì in exploring the use of breath and developing techniques still taught today. As many of her works were annotated, Humphrey continues to be taught, studied and performed. Early life Humphrey was born in Oak Park, Illinois, but grew up in Chicago, Illinois. She was the daughter of Horace Buckingham Humphrey, a journalist and one-time hotel manager, and Julia Ellen Wells, who had trained as a concert pianist. She was a descendant of pilgrim William Brewster who arrived on the Mayflower in 1620.Doris Batcheller Humphrey, Horace Buckingham Humphrey, Simon James Humphrey, Rebecca Brewster m John Humphrey, Simon Brewster, Jr., Simon Brewster, Sr., Benjamin, William, Love, William of the Mayflower. In Chicago, with the encouragement of her mother, she studied with eminent ballet masters as well as with Mary Wood Hinman, who taught dance at her school, the Francis Parker School. While still at high school she undertook a concert tour of the western states as a dancer, with her mother as accompanist, in a group sponsored by the Santa Fe Railroad for its Workman‚Äôs Clubs.Ann Barzel, The Doris Humphrey Society http://www.dorishumphrey.org/the- early-years/ Partly due to financial concerns Humphrey opened her own dance school, with her mother as manager and pianist, in 1913 at the age of 18. It was a great success, offering classic, gymnastic and ballroom dance for children and ballroom dance for young adults. In 1917, at the instigation of Mary Wood Hinman, she moved to California and entered the Denishawn School of Dancing and Related Arts where she studied, performed, taught classes and learned choreography. Her creations from this era, Valse Caprice (Scarf Dance), Soaring, and Scherzo Waltz (Hoop Dance) are all still performed today. She remained involved for the next decade. Humphrey toured the Orient for two years followed by a successful career in American vaudeville theaters. Personal life Short in stature, Doris was no taller than 5'3\\" and had a slender build. In 1932 she married Charles Woodford (a merchant.) She had one child, a son named Charles Humphrey Woodford (born 1934.) Dancing through the Great Depression In 1928, Humphrey and Charles Weidman, who had worked closely with Humphrey, left the Denishawn School and moved to New York City. Along with Humphrey and Weidman, Martha Graham also rebelled against the Denishawn establishment during this time. Humphrey and Graham separately developed new ideas about the core dynamics of dance movement that eventually formed the basis of each of their techniques.Au, Susan. Ballet and Modern Dance. New York: Thames & Hudson, Ltd. Humphrey‚Äôs theory explored the nuances of the human body's responses to gravity, embodied in her principle of \\"fall and recovery\\". She called this \\"the arc between two deaths\\". At one extreme, an individual surrenders to the nature of gravity; at the other, one attempts to achieve balance. Through the fall and recovery principle, Humphrey is able to illustrate emotional and physical climax of struggling for stability and submitting to the laws of gravity. Her choreography from these early years includes Air for the G String, Water Study, Life of the Bee, Two Ecstatic Themes, and The Shakers. Unlike the Denishawn approach in choreography, finding inspiration from abroad, Humphrey sought inspiration from within her home, America. The Shakers, about the 18th century American religious group, is a notable example of finding inspiration from America. The Humphrey-Weidman Company was successful even in the Great Depression, touring America and developing new styles and new works based not on old tales but on current events and concerns. In the mid-1930s Humphrey created the \\"New Dance Trilogy\\", a triptych comprising With My Red Fires, New Dance, and the now-lost Theater Piece. Though the three pieces were never performed together, they were danced to the score by Wallingford Rigger. Here Humphrey looks at the competitive lives of businessmen, working women, athletes, and actors. Humphrey was a participant of the Federal Dance Project (FDP), created in the 1930s as part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Second New Deal. FDP was the first national program created to financially support dance and dancers. Humphrey expanded her choreographic work to Broadway in 1933 with School for Husbands and again the following year with Life Begins at 8:40. During the 1940s, Humphrey spent significant time with Jos√© Lim√≥n, one of her former students. After she retired from performing in 1944, due to arthritis, she became artistic director for the Jos√© Lim√≥n Dance Company and created a number of works for the company, including Day on Earth, Night Spell, Ruins and Visions, and Lament for Ignacio Sanchez Mejias. Humphrey‚Äôs dance style was carried on and developed further by Lim√≥n and his dance company. One of her last pieces, Dawn in New York, showed the strengths Lim√≥n demonstrated throughout her career ‚Äì her mastery of the intricacies of large groups and her emphasis on sculptural shapes. Humphrey was on the original faculties of both The Bennington School of the Dance (1934) and The Juilliard School (1951), both directed by Martha Hill. In 1952 Humphrey started directing a new dance company for children called The Merry-Go-Rounders.  Choreographic Works and Movement Theory  As previously stated, Humphrey had some very particular theories on the fundamentals of movement. Her theory of Fall and Recovery was the center point of all her movement. She described this as \\"The arc between two deaths.\\" Moreover, this idea was based in the change in center of gravity, balance and recovery. Humphrey theorized that moving away from center should be followed by an equal adjustment to return to center to prevent a fall. The more dramatic the movement, the more dramatic the recovery should be.http://www.britannica.com/biography/Doris-Humphrey Humphrey also believed that movement should represent emotion but not to the same extent that Graham had. Her eye was more clinical, in a way, with most of her works relating to the interactions of an individual or group. As Graham had, she also \\"believed that dance should provoke, stimulate, and inform rather than simply entertain.\\" But where Graham had wished to explore the individual psyche, Humphrey wished to showcase individual and group dynamics from more of an outsider's perspective. This thought process translated into using dances as metaphors for human situations and working in mostly abstractions to represent specific characters, events, or ideas. Humphrey's most prominent works include Color Harmony (1928), Water Study (1928), Drama of Motion (1930), and The Shakers (1931). Color Harmony (1928) was her first independent concert after leaving Denishawn in 1928. She and Charles Weidman presented the work with \\"Weidman as a slivery figure representing the artistic intelligence that organizes the mingled colors of the spectrum into a harmonious design.\\" Water Study (1928) was Humphrey's experiment of dancing without music. She wanted the dancers to move to their natural breathing patterns as they represented the natural movement of water. Drama of Motion (1930) was the next step in her experiment of dancing without music. She wanted dance to be an art that could stand on its own without the need of music or emotion and concentrated on the formal elements of movement such as design, rhythm, and dynamics. Her best known work however, brought music and emotion back into play. The Shakers (1931) was inspired by a Christian sect known as Shakers. They required members to be celibate and are known for shaking during times of worship. To make sure their members remain celibate they segregate the sexes during rituals. In Humphrey's choreography she incorporates shaking movements to represent their sexual repression as well as the idea of being shaken clean of sin.  Legacy  Shortly after her death in 1958, Humphrey's book, The Art of Making Dances, in which she shared her observations and theories on dance and composition, was published. In the introduction she observed that ballet had changed radically in the 20th century. \\"Suddenly the dance,\\" she said, \\"the Sleeping Beauty, so long reclining in her dainty bed, had risen up with a devouring desire.\\" She believed in emotions and movement moving \\"from the inside out\\", but she also believed in working abstractly where specific events and characters were not illustrated in a way that made sense. For example, \\"she believed that the concept of democracy was more convincingly conveyed by a fugue uniting four different themes than by a woman in red, white and blue\\". Her theory of Fall and Recovery is still used to this day by many choreographers. Thirty-five of Doris Humphrey's dances are documented in Labanotation by the Dance Notation Bureau. Introductory material includes original casts, history of the dances, stylistic notes, and other information. The book, Days on Earth: The Dance of Doris Humphrey, by Marcia B. Siegel was published in 1993. Siegel makes a case for Humphrey being one of the more important figures of modern dance. Humphrey was inducted into the National Museum of Dance's Mr. & Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 1987. A street in her home town of Oak Park is named for her paternal grandfather, the Reverend Simon James Humphrey.

In 1928, the business was sold to Oland Brewery, which was in turn sold to the Labatt Brewing Company. Following a number of mergers and acquisitions, Labatt's is now part of Anheuser-Busch InBev. Since 1928, parent companies kept the brand alive, and by the 1990s Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale (IPA) was the most popular beer in Nova Scotia. A number of other styles is also marketed. Although Alexander Keith products were originally produced in the Halifax brewery only for sale in the Maritimes, they are now produced at Anheuser- Busch InBev plants across Canada and America. Archived recipes for beer made by the Alexander Keith's Brewery in the early 1900s show high levels of hopping, with large all-malt mash ingredients and no use of corn, typical for beers of that time. In contrast, the modern beer marketed as Alexander Keith's IPA is only 5% alcohol by volume and lightly hopped, which does not meet the accepted criteria for an India pale ale.

Within Ethnic Asian circles in the United States, the phrase is considered politically incorrect and derogatory. It can also be used to describe the stereotypical behavior of new immigrants as, for example, their poor driving skills, that they are educated yet working low-skilled or unskilled jobs, and their use of broken English. The term originates in the early days of immigration, when people mostly migrated to other countries by ship. \\"Fresh off the Boeing 707\\" (in reference to the Boeing 707 jet) is sometimes used in the United States as a variation, especially amongst East, South and Southeast Asian immigrants. In the United Kingdom \\"fresh off the boat\\" (mostly in regard to Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis) are referred to as freshies or simply FOBs. In the sociology of ethnicity, this term can be seen as an indicator of a nature of diasporic communities, or communities that have left their country of origin and migrated, usually permanently, to another country. The term has also been adapted by immigrants themselves or others in their community who see the differentiation as a source of pride, where they have retained their culture and have not lost it to assimilation. In fact, instead of taking this harm-intended phrase as an insult, many immigrants and more specifically, East and South Asians (especially their American-born children) may use this term to describe their cultural background habits and fashion sense, for example \\"fobby clothing\\", \\"fobby glasses\\", \\"fobby accent\\", and others. Similarly, some in the Arab-American community in Michigan refer to themselves as \\"Boaters\\", using it as a term of endearment, while others see it as an insult.

This is indicated by a number (or sometimes two), indicating the fraction involved. The notes involved are also often grouped with a bracket or (in older notation) a slur. The most common type of tuplet is the triplet. Terminology The modern term 'tuplet' comes from a rebracketing of compound words like quintu(s)-(u)plet and sextu(s)-(u)plet, and from related mathematical terms such as \\"tuple\\", \\"-uplet\\" and \\"-plet\\", which are used to form terms denoting multiplets (Oxford English Dictionary, entries \\"multiplet\\", \\"-plet, comb. form\\", \\"-let, suffix\\", and \\"-et, suffix1\\"). An alternative modern term, \\"irrational rhythm\\", was originally borrowed from Greek prosody where it referred to \\"a syllable having a metrical value not corresponding to its actual time-value, or ... a metrical foot containing such a syllable\\" (Oxford English Dictionary, entry \\"irrational\\"). The term would be incorrect if used in the mathematical sense (because the note-values are rational fractions) or in the more general sense of \\"unreasonable, utterly illogical, absurd\\". Alternative terms found occasionally are \\"artificial division\\" , \\"abnormal divisions\\" , \\"irregular rhythm\\" , and \\"irregular rhythmic groupings\\" . The term \\"polyrhythm\\" (or \\"polymeter\\"), sometimes incorrectly used of \\"tuplets\\", actually refers to the simultaneous use of opposing time signatures . Besides \\"triplet\\", the terms \\"duplet\\", \\"quadruplet\\", \\"quintuplet\\", \\"sextuplet\\", \\"septuplet\\", and \\"octuplet\\" are used frequently. The terms \\"nonuplet\\", \\"decuplet\\", \\"undecuplet\\", \\"dodecuplet\\", and \\"tredecuplet\\" had been suggested but up until 1925 had not caught on (, ). By 1964 the terms \\"nonuplet\\" and \\"decuplet\\" were usual, while subdivisions by greater numbers were more commonly described as \\"group of eleven notes\\", \\"group of twelve notes\\", and so on .  Triplet  The most common tuplet is the triplet (Ger. Triole, Fr. triolet, It. terzina or tripletta, Sp. tresillo). Whereas normally two quarter notes (crotchets) are the same duration as a half note (minim), three triplet quarter notes have that same duration, so the duration of a triplet quarter note is the duration of a standard quarter note. : ew RhythmicStaff { \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 2/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 100 c4 c \\\\tuplet 3/2 { c4 c c } } Similarly, three triplet eighth notes (quavers) are equal in duration to one quarter note. If several note values appear under the triplet bracket, they are all affected the same way, reduced to their original duration. : ew RhythmicStaff { \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 2/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 100 c8 c c c \\\\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c } \\\\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c } } The triplet indication may also apply to notes of different values, for example a quarter note followed by one eighth note, in which case the quarter note may be regarded as two triplet eighths tied together . : ew RhythmicStaff { \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 2/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 100 \\\\tuplet 3/2 { c4 c8 } \\\\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c4 } } In some older scores, rhythms like this would be notated as a dotted eighth note and a sixteenth note as a kind of shorthand presumably so that the beaming more clearly shows the beats.  Tuplet notation   Notation  Tuplets are typically notated either with a bracket or with a number above or below the beam if the notes are beamed together. Sometimes, the tuplet is notated with a ratio (instead of just a number) ‚Äî with the first number in the ratio indicating the number of notes in the tuplet and the second number indicating the number of normal notes they have the same duration as ‚Äî or with a ratio and a note value. : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f ew RhythmicStaff { \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 5/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 100 \\\\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c } \\\\once \\\\override TupletBracket.bracket-visibility = ##t \\\\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c } \\\\once \\\\override TupletNumber.text = #tuplet-number::calc-fraction- text \\\\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c } \\\\once \\\\override TupletNumber.text = #(tuplet- number::append-note-wrapper (tuplet-number::non-default-tuplet-fraction-text 3 2) \\"8\\") \\\\tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c } } }  Rhythm   Simple meter  For other tuplets, the number indicates a ratio to the next lower normal value in the prevailing meter (a power of 2 in simple meter). So a quintuplet (quintolet or pentuplet ) indicated with the numeral 5 means that five of the indicated note value total the duration normally occupied by four (or, as a division of a dotted note in compound time, three), equivalent to the second higher note value. For example, five quintuplet eighth notes total the same duration as a half note (or, in or compound meters such as , , etc. time, a dotted quarter note). : ew RhythmicStaff { \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 2/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 100 c8 c c c \\\\tuplet 5/4 { c8 c c c c } c2 } Some numbers are used inconsistently: for example septuplets (septolets or septimoles) usually indicate 7 notes in the duration of 4‚Äîor in compound meter 7 for 6‚Äîbut may sometimes be used to mean 7 notes in the duration of 8 . Thus, a septuplet lasting a whole note can be written with either quarter notes (7:4) or eighth notes (7:8). : ew RhythmicStaff { \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 4/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 100 \\\\tuplet 7/4 { c4 c c c c c c } \\\\tuplet 7/8 { c8 c c c c c c } } To avoid ambiguity, composers sometimes write the ratio explicitly instead of just a single number. This is also done for cases like 7:11, where the validity of this practice is established by the complexity of the figure. A French alternative is to write pour (\\"for\\") or de (\\"of\\") in place of the colon, or above the bracketed \\"irregular\\" number . This reflects the French usage of, for example, \\"six- pour-quatre\\" as an alternative name for the sextolet (; ). There are disagreements about the sextuplet (pronounced with stress on the first syllable, according to )‚Äîwhich is also called sestole, sestolet, sextole, or sextolet (; ; ; ; ; ; ). This six-part division may be regarded either as a triplet with each note divided in half (2 + 2 + 2)‚Äîtherefore with an accent on the first, third, and fifth notes‚Äîor else as an ordinary duple pattern with each note subdivided into triplets (3 + 3) and accented on both the first and fourth notes. This is indicated by the beaming in the example below. : ew RhythmicStaff { \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 2/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 100 \\\\tuplet 6/4 { c16 \\\\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \\\\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c \\\\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \\\\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c c } \\\\tuplet 6/4 { c16 c \\\\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \\\\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c c c } } Some authorities treat both groupings as equally valid forms (; ; ; ; ), while others dispute this, holding the first type to be the \\"true\\" (or \\"real\\") sextuplet, and the second type to be properly a \\"double triplet\\", which should always be written and named as such (; ; ). Some go so far as to call the latter, when written with a numeral 6, a \\"false\\" sextuplet (; ; ). Still others, on the contrary, define the sextuplet precisely and solely as the double triplet (; ), and a few more, while accepting the distinction, contend that the true sextuplet has no internal subdivisions‚Äîonly the first note of the group should be accented (; ; ).  Compound meter  In compound meter, even-numbered tuplets can indicate that a note value is changed in relation to the dotted version of the next higher note value. Thus, two duplet eighth notes (most often used in meter) take the time normally totaled by three eighth notes, equal to a dotted quarter note. Four quadruplet (or quartole) eighth notes would also equal a dotted quarter note. The duplet eighth note is thus exactly the same duration as a dotted eighth note, but the duplet notation is far more common in compound meters . : ew RhythmicStaff { \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 6/8 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 100 c8 c c c c c \\\\tuplet 2/3 { c8 c } c8. c \\\\tuplet 4/3 { c8 c c c } c16. c c c c2. } A duplet in compound time is more often written as 2:3 (a dotted quarter note split into two duplet eighth notes) than 2: (a dotted quarter note split into two duplet quarter notes), even though the former is inconsistent with a quadruplet also being written as 4:3 (a dotted quarter note split into four quadruplet eighth notes) .  Nested tuplets  On occasion, tuplets are used \\"inside\\" tuplets. These are referred to as nested tuplets. : ew RhythmicStaff { \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 2/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 68 \\\\once \\\\override TupletBracket.bracket- visibility = ##t \\\\tuplet 5/4 {c8[ \\\\tuplet 3/2 { c16 c c] } c4 \\\\tuplet 7/4 { c32[ c c c c c c] } } c2 }  Counting  Tuplets can produce rhythms such as the hemiola or may be used as polyrhythms when played against the regular duration. They are extrametric rhythmic units. The example below shows sextuplets in quintuplet time. : << \\\\relative c' { \\\\override Staff.StaffSymbol.line-positions = #'(-2 2) \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 5/4 \\\\override TupletNumber.text = #tuplet-number::calc-fraction-text \\\\tuplet 6/5 { e4 e e e e e } e4 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\relative c' { a4 a a a a a } >> Tuplets may be counted, most often at extremely slow tempos, using the least common multiple (LCM) between the original and tuplet divisions. For example, with a 3-against-2 tuplet (triplets) the LCM is 6. Since and the quarter notes fall every three counts (overlined) and the triplets every two (underlined): :{style=\\"width: 1.2in;\\" _1_ 2 _3_ 4 _5_ 6 } This is fairly easily brought up to tempo, and depending on the music may be counted in tempo, while 7-against-4, having an LCM of 28, may be counted at extremely slow tempos but must be played intuitively (\\"felt out\\") at tempo: :{style=\\"width: 8in;\\" _1_ 2 3 4 _5_ 6 7 8 _9_ 10 11 12 _13_ 14 15 16 _17_ 18 19 20 _21_ 22 23 24 _25_ 26 27 28 } To play a half-note (minim) triplet accurately in a bar of , count eighth-note triplets and tie them together in groups of four : << \\\\relative c' { \\\\override Staff.StaffSymbol.line-positions = #'(-2 2) \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 4/4 \\\\tuplet 3/2 { e4.~ e8 e4~ e e8~ e4. } e4 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\relative c' { \\\\tuplet 3/2 { a2 a a } a4 } >> With a stress on each target note, one would count: 1 ‚Äì 2 ‚Äì 3 1 ‚Äì 2 ‚Äì 3 1 ‚Äì 2 ‚Äì 3 1 ‚Äì 2 ‚Äì 3 1 The same principle can be applied to quintuplets, septuplets, and so on.  Quadruplet figure in drumming  In drumming, \\"quadruplet\\" refers to one group of three sixteenth-note triplets \\"with an extra [non-tuplet eighth] note added on to the end\\", thus filling one beat in time , with four notes of unequal value.

Business After learning the brewing trade from his uncle in Northern England, Keith immigrated to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1817 and became manager at a brewery, which he bought out in 1820. In 1822, he moved the brewery to larger facilities and, in 1836, built a new brewery. The end of slavery in the British and French Caribbean reduced the availability of sugar for rum-making, and other beverages grew in popularity. Beverages brewed by Keith included spruce beer, porter, ginger wine, and strong ale. The brewery is now part of Anheuser-Busch InBev. From 1837, he served in senior management of various companies, including the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Halifax Fire Insurance Company, Colonial Life Assurance Company, the Halifax Gas, Light, and Water Company, the Provincial Permanent Building, and Investment Society. Political career In 1841, he was elected to the city council of Halifax and was elected mayor in 1843, 1853, and 1854. In 1843, he was appointed to the Legislative Council of Nova Scotia, becoming its president from 1867 until his death in 1873. Keith served with several fraternal and charitable societies, including as president of the North British Society and Grand Master of the Freemasons. Personal life Born in Caithness, Scotland, in 1795 he immigrated to Nova Scotia in 1817. Keith married Sarah Ann Stalcup in 1822, and they had three children, all of whom died before reaching adulthood. Sarah Ann Stalcup died in 1832, and a year later, Keith married Eliza Keith, with whom he had eight children. Architect William Hay began construction of Keith's new residence, Keith Hall, in 1863. The palazzo mixes styles including baroque and a mansard roof. He died in Halifax in 1873 and is buried at Camp Hill Cemetery. His estate at death was evaluated at $251,000.

After the October Revolution, he was Chief of Cheka of the Petrograd Soviet. Uritsky was assassinated by Leonid Kannegisser, a military cadet, who was executed shortly afterwards. Family Moisei Uritsky student at Bila Tserkva gymnasium circa 1883 Uritsky was born in the city of Cherkasy, Kiev Governorate, to a Jewish Litvak family. His father, a merchant, died when Moisei was little and his mother raised her son by herself. He attended the Bila Tserkva Gymnasium, supporting himself through teaching and became an active social democrat. Early political career Moisei studied law at the University of Kiev. During his studies he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and organized an underground network for importing and distributing political literature. In 1897 he was arrested and exiled for running an illegal mimeograph press. Becoming involved in the revolutionary movement, he participated in the revolutionary Jewish Bund. In 1903, he became a Menshevik. His activities in Petersburg during the 1905 revolution earned him a second term of exile. Along with Alexander Parvus he was active in dispatching revolutionary agents to infiltrate the Tsarist security apparatus. Russian Revolution In 1914 he emigrated to France and contributed to the Party newspaper Our Word. Back in Russia in 1917 Uritsky became a member of the Mezhraiontsy group. A few months before the October Revolution of 1917, he joined the Bolsheviks and was elected to their Central Committee in July 1917. Uritsky played a leading part in the Bolsheviks' armed take-over in October and later was made head of the Petrograd Cheka. In this position Uritsky coordinated the pursuit and prosecution of members of the nobility, military officers and ranking Russian Orthodox Church clerics who opposed the Bolsheviks. Moisei Uritsky internal exile Arkhangelsk Governorate circa 1906 Because Uritsky was against the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, he resigned his post in 1918, like Bukharin, Bubnov, Piatakov, Dzherzhinsky and Smirnov. On March 4, 1918, the Petrograd committee published the first number of the journal Kommunist, the public organ of the \\"left communist\\" opposition, as directed by Radek and Uritsky. The Extraordinary Seventh Congress of the Bolshevik party, which was held between March 6 and 8, 1918, rejected the Theses on the Present Situation that was submitted as a resolution by the \\"Left Communists\\". The \\"Left Communists\\" Lomov and Uritsky, who were elected to the Central Committee, stated at the Congress that they would not work in the Central Committee, and did not begin work there for several months in spite of insistent demands from the Central Committee. On May 25, 1918, with the Revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion, the Russian Civil War began and Uritsky resumed his position on the Central Committee. Assassination Leonid Kannegisser, a young military cadet of the Imperial Russian Army, assassinated Uritsky on August 17, 1918, outside the Petrograd Cheka headquarters in retaliation for the execution of his friend and other officers.Melgunov, S.P. Red Terror in Russia Following this event, along with the assassination attempt on Lenin by Fanny Kaplan on August 30, the Bolsheviks began a wave of persecution known as the Red Terror.

He began work on the \\"Way of the World\\" column with illustrator Michael ffolkes three times a week in early 1957, and wrote the column four times a week for a lengthy period ending in 1987. On 13 May 1990 he began a weekly Peter Simple column in the Sunday Telegraph, before returning to the Daily Telegraph as a weekly columnist on 8 March 1996. He remained there until his death, aged 92, in 2006, his last column appearing on 20 January 2006. Life and career Wharton was born as Michael Bernhard Nathan, the son of a businessman of German-Jewish origin, at Shipley, in the West Riding of Yorkshire (\\"Wharton\\" was the maiden name of his mother).\\"In memory of my father, Michael Wharton\\", Daily Telegraph, 2 Oct 2009, by Jane WhartonDaily Telegraph 24 Jan 2006 Wharton was educated at Bradford Grammar School and Lincoln College, Oxford. His career at Oxford was undistinguished, partly because he spent his time writing Sheldrake, a novel that had little success when published in 1958. After Oxford, Wharton served in the Royal Artillery from 1940 to 1946, rising to the rank of Major (acting Lieutenant-Colonel), \\"but\\", in his own words, \\"only in Intelligence\\".https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/04/the-last- edwardian/304734/2/ He then worked for the BBC as a producer and scriptwriter, but left in 1956. His two volumes of quasi-autobiography, The Missing Will and A Dubious Codicil, combined his fantasy world with the mundane reality of the life as a jobbing journalist. Wharton married three times. His daughter and literary executor, Jane Wharton, works as a psychotherapist.\\"In memory of my father, Michael Wharton\\" The Daily Telegraph, 2 October 2009, by Jane Wharton Wharton's characters The column satirised what Wharton saw as modern, fashionable ideas, and readers often claimed to recognise his invented characters in real people. Not fictional was the column's presiding spirit, Colonel Sibthorp, an eccentric and reactionary Victorian Member of Parliament, about whom Wharton made a BBC radio documentary in 1954Radio Times, North of England edition, 10‚Äì16 January 1954 and then a \\"centenary celebration\\" the following year.BBC Genome website Controversy \\"Fulminator\\", in his Daily Telegraph blog, said of Wharton: > Wharton‚Äôs political views were so far removed from the mainstream that > they‚Äôre practically unclassifiable ‚Äì a feudalist and a rabid reactionary, > certainly (he invented the fictitious Feudal and Reactionary Herald). He > hated ‚ÄúProgress‚Äù, loathed communism and socialism with a passion, and wasn‚Äôt > keen on capitalism or money-grubbing in general. Writing in The Independent J. W. M. Thompson suggested: > As befitted a satirist who was wounded by the changes he observed in his > country, he had a profound attachment to the land and a true Tory's > nostalgia for an idealised vision of its past. Wharton consistently criticised and ridiculed what he described as the \\"race relations industry\\", and one of his most famous comic creations was the \\"prejudometer\\", an anti-racist instrument that supplied readings in prejudons, the \\"internationally recognised scientific unit of racial prejudice\\", when pointed at a suspected racist. Concerned individuals could even point the prejudometer at themselves: > At 3.6 degrees on the Alibhai-Brown scale, it sets off a shrill scream that > will not stop until you've pulled yourself together with a well-chosen anti- > racist slogan.Daily Telegraph 15 March 2002 Wharton was accused in his Times obituary of \\"sometimes veer[ing] into the area of straightforward racism\\" and of being \\"prone to anti-semitic innuendo\\"The Times article for such passages as this: > Almost single-handed, Ariel Sharon may have ended the Jews' virtual immunity > from hostile criticism that Hitler's persecution assured for more than 50 > years. Anti-semitism is stirring.

First that; but later, for worse, the real > thing.Wharton, \\"End Column\\", Daily Telegraph, 19 April 2002 However the quote occurs in a context of a passage gleefully satirising the Boycott Israel movement. His obituary in The Guardian pursued the same thread: > In his comment paragraphs, he aired a conservatism light years to the right > of most conservatives, stealing sometimes into fleeting, only half- > retracted, laments for the Europe that Hitler's New Order might have > created.The Guardian article Michael Wharton held the National Socialist Adolf Hitler to be a radical, a revolutionary totally opposed to conservative principles. Related columns Wharton wrote four columns in a week for the last time from 25‚Äì28 August 1987. After Wharton expressed his desire to write less often, Way of the World was written initially three times a week, and subsequently twice weekly until the spring of 1990, by Christopher Booker under the name Peter Simple II, with Wharton continuing to write the column once a week initially on Fridays, but then on Thursdays until 3 May 1990. In 1990 the Peter Simple column and the Way of the World column became fully separate entities, and for the next ten years (7 May 1990 ‚Äì 16 December 2000) the Way of the World column was written by Auberon Waugh, who died in January 2001. It was then written by the satirist Craig Brown until he left the Telegraph late in 2008. A. N. Wilson began to write a column also under the title Peter Simple II in The Sunday Telegraph on 26 February 2006, but it did not last long.
