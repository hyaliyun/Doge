Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker portray the film's protagonists, Paul and Meryl Morgan, a recently separated New York power couple on the verge of divorce until they witness the murder of Meryl's client. They are forced to enter into temporary witness protection, given new identities, and relocated to a small Wyoming town (the fictional Ray, Wyoming, 45 minutes out of Cody). Supporting roles are played by Sam Elliott, Mary Steenburgen, Elisabeth Moss, and Wilford Brimley. It is the second collaboration of Grant and Parker, following the 1996 film Extreme Measures. The film premiered in New York on December 14, 2009 and in London the following day. It was released to the United States on December 18 and to most of Europe in January 2010. It received generally negative reviews from critics. The film grossed $6,616,571 in its opening weekend and earned $85 million worldwide. Did You Hear About the Morgans? was the 70th most successful film worldwide for 2009. Plot A successful Manhattan couple, lawyer Paul Morgan (Hugh Grant) and estate agent Meryl Morgan (Sarah Jessica Parker), are separated due to Paul's infidelity. After dinner one night, Meryl and Paul witness the murder of one of Meryl's real estate clients. As a result, they become targets of contract killer Vincent (Michael Kelly) and must enter the Witness Protection Program. Paul and Meryl are relocated to the small town of Ray, Wyoming and placed temporarily under the protection of husband and wife/sheriff and deputy, Clay and Emma Wheeler (Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen). For their own safety, they are permitted no outside contact via telephone or e-mail. They have trouble adjusting to small-town life, but after a perilous encounter with a bear and awkward attempts at shooting rifles, chopping wood, and horseback riding, they eventually adjust and begin assisting the local citizens professionally. Meanwhile, neither of their assistants back in New York City know their whereabouts. Vincent plants a bug at Meryl's office and in her assistant Jackie's (Elisabeth Moss) purse, hoping to gain information, which is eventually successful. Jackie attempts to call Meryl but Paul's assistant Adam (Jesse Liebman) stops her by kissing her, which she responds to by tasering him then apologizing and offering him to take her on a date the next day. Paul and Meryl go on a \\"date\\" in town and begin to reconcile, but then Paul is heartbroken when he learns that Meryl had a one-night stand with one of their acquaintances during their separation. The next day, with Vincent in town unbeknownst to them, the Morgans anticipate leaving Ray for a permanent hiding place. The Wheelers invite them to a rodeo, but the Morgans are at loggerheads, so they decline. Leaving the Morgans without any form of security, the Wheelers leave for the rodeo. Vincent tries to attack the house but is accosted by a bear, which gives the Morgans time to escape. They flee on horseback to the rodeo to seek help. Vincent follows them to the rodeo, they spot him and hide in a bull suit. However, they end up in the ring with a bull, which then charges them, injuring Meryl. Meryl, unable to walk, stays hidden from Vincent while Paul impulsively confronts him with a canister of bear repellent spray. Paul accidentally sprays himself in the face, alerting Vincent who then holds Paul at gun-point. The Morgans are rescued by the Wheelers and their new friends from the town. Six months later, Jackie and Adam are in a committed relationship while Paul and Meryl have repaired their marriage. They have an adopted baby girl from China, named Rae in honor of the Wyoming town, and Meryl is pregnant with their biological child living happily together in New York City.

The site's consensus states \\"It gets a certain amount of mileage out of the inherent likability of its stars, but with an unfunny script and a lack of onscreen chemistry, Did You Hear About the Morgans? falls flat.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 27 out of 100, based on 28 reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \\"B-\\" on scale of A to F. John Anderson of Variety magazine wrote: \\"the charm of the film is that it resists turning people into cliches and lets Parker and Grant work their particular magic -- before they get to Wyoming, their performances are as stressed out as their characters, and while it's a dubious conceit that going cowboy is a cure-all, they put the notion across as convincingly as possible.\\" Sarah Jessica Parker was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award as Worst Actress for her performance, but lost to Sandra Bullock for All About Steve. Box office In its first opening weekend, the film opened at #4 in the United States box office earning $6,616,571.

History  Electronic Data Systems (EDS) was founded in 1962 by H. Ross Perot, a graduate of the United States Naval Academy and a successful IBM salesman who firsthand observed how inefficiently IBM's customers typically were using their expensive systems. Somewhat to IBM's chagrin, since the company sold as many computers as possible, Perot made a fortune changing this. An early success was in matching the unused computer time at Southwestern Life Insurance Company with the computing needs of rapidly expanding Collins Radio, both located in Dallas, Texas. Perot knew the inside details of both companies. In its early years, EDS was a pioneer in facilities management (becoming the IT department for many companies) as well as beginning to service banks and provide early support for both Medicaid and Medicare in its home state of Texas. Leading the effort internally was Morton H. Meyerson, who joined the company in 1966 as the company's 54th employee. In 1967, he proposed the business model that eventually became known as \\"outsourcing\\" and which led to exponential growth for EDS. In the 1970s, EDS expanded initially into more insurance services and later credit unions, and by 1975 revenue topped $100 million and the company began bidding for work internationally. In 1978 EDS expanded into financial markets with the arrival of automated teller machines, electronic funds transfers and real-time point-of-sale terminals. Meyerson was named president in 1979, at which point EDS had revenue of $270 million, was free of debt, and had 8,000 employees. In the 1980s, they expanded into travel services supporting payment services between travel agents and airlines represented by the Air Transport Association of America and provided large scale contracts for the US military. In 1984, the company was acquired by General Motors for $2.5 billion, with EDS becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of GM. Meyerson remained president and in 1985, the company had a presence in 21 countries with 40,000 employees. Meyerson retired in 1987. During his years of executive leadership, EDS revenue grew to $4 billion a year, and the company grew to 45,000 employees. By the end of the decade, revenue was $5 billion. In 1996, GM spun off EDS as an independent company. In the 1990s, in addition to its existing markets, EDS was entering the telecommunications industry and was providing IT systems in many foreign countries. They were providing information systems for global sporting events including the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and the 1998 FIFA World Cup. In 1994, they signed what was at the time the largest information technology contract with Xerox for $3.2 billion and also bought the New Zealand banking processing company Databank Systems. In 1995 they purchased A.T. Kearney, the world's 4th largest private management consulting firm. In 1996, they became an independent company again and relisted on the New York Stock Exchange. Before the turn of the century they took part in over 1,300 Year 2000 projects. In 2000, EDS launched a new logo with an award- winning Super Bowl commercial about herding cats. Post-2000, they continued to sign long term, billion dollar contracts with organizations such as Bank of America, American Airlines, General Motors, Kraft Foods and the United States Navy. In 2006 they sold A.T. Kearney in a management buyout. On May 13, 2008, Hewlett-Packard Co. confirmed that it had reached a deal with EDS to acquire the company for $13.9 billion. The deal was completed on August 26, 2008. EDS became an HP business unit and was temporarily renamed \\"EDS, an HP company\\". Ronald A. Rittenmeyer, EDS Chairman, President, and CEO, remained at the helm and reported to HP CEO Mark Hurd until his retirement. In December 2008, HP announced that Rittenmeyer would retire at the end of the month. As of 2008, EDS employed 300,000 people in 64 countries, the largest locations being the United States, India and the UK. It was ranked as one of the largest service companies on the Fortune 500 list with around 2,000 clients. As of 23 September 2009, EDS began going to market as HP Enterprise Services, a name change which came one year after HP announced the acquisition of EDS, and which was a critical milestone as the integration of EDS into HP neared completion. On April 3, 2017, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services merged with Computer Sciences Corporation to form DXC Technology. Retaining significant operations from Plano, Texas and many aspects of EDS. On June 1, 2018, DXC spun off the U.S. public services sector of the business through a Reverse Morris Trust, combining with Vencore and KeyPoint Government Solutions to create a new independent and publicly traded government contractor, Perspecta.

During the 1979 overthrow, several EDS employees were detained by the transitioning government of Iran, causing H. Ross Perot to undertake extraordinary clandestine measures to get these employees out of Iran.Operation HOTFOOT , medicaid.state.ar.us These events were recounted in Ken Follett's book On Wings of Eagles.  Client contract controversies  * In December 2003, EDS lost a 10-year ¬£3 billion contract to run Inland Revenue IT services after a series of serious delays in the payment of tax credits, the contract instead being awarded to the company Cap Gemini. EDS had operated systems for the Inland Revenue since 1994 but the performance of its system had been low, causing late arrival of tax credit payments for hundreds of thousands of people. * In 2004, EDS was criticized by the UK's National Audit Office for its work on IT systems for the UK's Child Support Agency (CSA), which ran seriously over budget causing problems which led to the resignation of the CSA's head, Doug Smith on 2004-11-27. The system's rollout had been two years late and following its introduction in March 2003 the CSA was obliged to write off ¬£1 billion in claims, while ¬£750 million in child support payments from absent parents remained uncollected. An internal EDS memo was leaked that admitted that the CSA's system was \\"badly designed, badly tested and badly implemented\\". UK MPs described it as an \\"appalling waste of public money\\" and called for it to be scrapped. * In 2006, EDS' Joint Personnel Administration (JPA) system for the RAF led to thousands of personnel not receiving correct pay due to \\"processing errors\\". EDS and MoD staff were reported to have \\"no definitive explanations for the errors\\". * In September 2007 EDS paid $500,000 to settle an action by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding charges related to overstatement of its contract revenues in 2001‚Äì2003. At the time these caused a fall in share prices in 2002 which led to legal action against EDS from US shareholder groups. * On 2007-10-16, British TV company BSkyB claimed ¬£709m compensation from EDS, claiming that EDS' failure to meet its agreed service standards resulted not just from incompetence, but from fraud and deceit in the way it pitched for the contract. * During the BSkyB case, it was shown that a Managing Director had obtained a degree over the Internet. Lawyers for Sky were able to demonstrate that the process for awarding the degree claimed would give a degree to a dog, and that the mark attained by the dog was higher than that of the HP executive, who was questioned on his expertise and integrity. HP lost the case with a preliminary ¬£200 million payment ordered, whilst they appeal over the ¬£700 million total.http://www.itnews.com.au/News/165888,key-eds-witness-bought-internet- degree.aspx * On 2008-10-10 it was reported that a Ministry of Defence hard drive potentially containing the details of 100,000 Armed Forces personnel could not be located by EDS.

It is one of the Polish- American Roman Catholic parishes in New England in the Archdiocese of Boston.  History  Holy Trinity Parish of Lowell, Massachusetts started around 1893. With help of Fr. John Chmielinski, pastor of the Polish-American parish in South Boston, promised aid, a fund was started, and in 1903 land was purchased on High St. and in the spring of 1904, construction works have started. The architect was T. Edward Sheehan from Boston. In June 1904 the Archbishop Stanislaw Williams commissioned Fr. Alexander Ogonowskiego to live in Lowell and the canonical mission to organize and establish a Polish- American church. There were about 80 Polish families at that time. On August 19, 1904, Bishop Allen of Mobile diocese, made the consecration of the new church. In 1907 completed the construction of schools and it was placed under the patronage of the youth saint, St. Stanislaus Kostka. It was the first Polish parochial school in the Archdiocese of Boston. In 1910, nuns from the Congregation of the Felician Sisters of Buffalo, New York, began work at the school. In 1927 five acres of land was purchased for their own cemetery, across from St. Patrick cemetery. After World War II were erected a beautiful marble Passion (Crucifixion scene) and the altar, the place where every year is celebrated Mass. during the celebrations Memorial Day. At the base of the altar lie the remains of parishioners, who paid the supreme sacrifice for the country. Today the parish continues to be a beacon of hope and light. In 2004 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston attempted to close Holy Trinity Parish after closing its parish school. The parish reluctantly appealed to the Vatican and was granted to stay open. The parish continues to be open and is a fully active and traditional Catholic parish. It is open to all ethnic groups although the Polish community holds a special place. It has an active Holy Name Society, choir, Our Lady Solidarity, and strong Religious Education program. All are welcome.  Pastors  * Fr. Stanislaw Aleksander Ogonowski (1904‚Äì1955) * Fr.

History The community was first settled in 1880 when fifteen families established themselves along Toyah Creek. Antonio Matta built his horse ranch headquarters in the area. A post office opened in 1884, but closed in 1891. The post office was reestablished in 1900. In 1909, the plat for Saragosa was filed at the Reeves County courthouse. With the arrival of the Pecos Valley Southern Railway two years later, Saragosa became a shipping point for alfalfa, cotton, and fruits. By 1925, the community had a population of approximately 25. That number rose to 150 in 1931, but soon declined to around 25 in the mid-1930s. In 1938, Saragosa's school district consolidated with nearby Pecos. Throughout the 1940s, the community was home to four businesses and sixty residents. There were nine businesses in Saragosa at the end of the 1950s. The population peaked at around 380 in 1960. In 1968, Saragosa Elementary School closed and students were bussed to an elementary school in Pecos. The population stood at 173 in 1970 and rose slightly to 183 by the late 1980s, where it remained relatively stable during the remainder of the twentieth century. 1987 tornado On May 22, 1987, a multi-vortex, F4 tornado struck Saragosa. The half-mile wide tornado destroyed eighty percent of the community, killing 30 and injuring 121. The storm caused $1.5 million in damage. Most of Saragosa had been rebuilt by the early 1990s.

Water is pumped as the paddles push the water up the trough. Application The water ladder, as many low lift pumps, is commonly used for irrigation purposes and for drainage of lands. It is currently still used by farmers in south-east Asia. Advantages The water ladder was built as an alternative to the paddle wheel to get around the problem that to lift water to a greater height, a bigger wheel is needed. Water ladder pump Despite the emergence of new pumps that operate on other principles, the water ladder remains an important tool as some of its other benefits are that they can be built and repaired easily at a very low cost. This is possible as all the components can be built from local resources, such as wood; which can be obtained and shaped into the desired form easily. Disadvantages As mentioned before, the pump only allows the lifting of water over a small height. This makes it unsuitable to water drainage or irrigation over larger height differences or many other pumping applications besides drainage and irrigation.

In 2012, penalties for Andr√© Esteves' insider trading \\"force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option to reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest-profile bank deals.\\" In \\"a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision.\\" However, Esteves did not appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons. In 2013, Charles Rosier, a former partner of BTG Pactual, was convicted in an insider trading case in France. While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in SNCF Geodis just before a takeover bid was announced.  Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG  Arthur Rutishauser argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: Andr√© Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3 billion SFr to UBS, where Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction. Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion SFr after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG. Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared then resurfaced as a senior partner and board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.  BTG Pactual purchase of BSI  In July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). The current CEO of FINMA Mark Branson was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd. and reported directly to Huw Jenkins, CEO of UBS Investment Bank who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual. Branson also worked with Andr√© Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual, when both worked at UBS on its management committee in November 2007, the time Andr√© Esteves committed insider trades. Under Mark Branson, FINMA decided whether to approve BTG Pactual's purchase of BSI, although BTG Pactual wA being owned and operated by former superiors and colleagues Jenkins and Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever. Misrepresentation allegation The case was closed, a final settlement has been reached. An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BTG Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual board member Huw Jenkins and Andr√© Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with the bank. Ivic said he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual's initial public offering (IPO), which raised funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, and the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares. Ivic, who valued his claim at some US$20 million, started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013. In March 2017, the parties involved, including Messrs. Andr√© Esteves and Ivic Zeljko, reached a final settlement for the above-mentioned disputes, in which the parties have waived any of the rights they may have against the other party in respect of any of the claims.

History The community originated in either the late 1860s or early 1870s. The settlement was first known as Brown's Mill, but was later changed to Dime Box. The origin of the name \\"Dime Box\\" stemmed from a custom in which early settlers would use a large, wooden box to forward and receive mail, or order small items from a carrier on horseback traveling to nearby Giddings.https://www.npr.org/2014/04/01/297866811/a-penny-for-a-natives- thoughts-on-dime-box-texas In 1913, when the Southern Pacific Railroad built a line three miles southeast of the community, most of the residents and businesses moved to a site near the tracks.

The municipality existed from 1964 until 1972. It encompassed the northeastern part of the Bergen Peninsula, along the S√∏rfjorden, bordering the city of Bergen across the mountains to the west. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Indre Arna. The municipality stretched from the village of Ytre Arna to Trengereid along the coast and then inland about to the Espeland area. Today, the area of the former municipality makes up the borough of Arna in the city of Bergen. History On 1 January 1964, the historic municipality of Haus was split into two parts. The part on the island of Oster√∏y became part of the new municipality of Oster√∏y. The rest of Haus, located on the Bergen Peninsula became the municipality of Arna. The municipality was short-lived due to its proximity to the growing city of Bergen. On 1 January 1972, Arna was merged into the city of Bergen (along with the other neighboring municipalities of Fana, Laksev√•g, and √Ösane). Upon its dissolution in 1972, Arna had 11,766 residents. The municipality had two different mayors while it was in existence. From 1964 to 1967 Gustav Holtan was mayor and from 1967 to 1971 Arne Ekeland was mayor.

Innervation Trust is a Christian charity that exists to recruit and resource schools teams, dubbed \\"Collectives\\", each dedicated to a major city in the UK. Innervation Trust is the product of Mark Pennells and Zarc Porter, a songwriter/producer partnership also credited with writing most of the music for, and co-founding, the World Wide Message Tribe. After 7 years of promoting the Collective bands throughout every region of the UK, they were replaced by the primary school project, Pop Connection. This has since been replaced by iSingPOP. iSingPOP works in primary schools and will spend a week teaching all the children a number of songs (usually 7) as a choir and the next week will perform these songs in their local church or activity hall/centre with an audience. They also have a recording day to make their own album. Name As an advertising device to raise the profile of the band at its launch, Innervation opened a competition for fans to give the band a name. Fans were invited to vote via the internet for a new name, and the most popular ones were placed in a shortlist from which fans could vote for their favourite. However, the band decided, that alongside brother band Thebandwithnoname and with the help of around 80% of the votes, they decided to keep band name TBC in other words \\"Touring Band Collective\\". Shortly after the Collective work had ended, the girls refer to TBC as \\"To Be Continued\\", as to whatever the situation concerning new band members, the girls will try to continue doing work for God. Debut album TBC's debut album TBC, produced by Zarc Porter, was released in 2005. TBC were then a four-piece group, the members being Shell Perris, Natalie Joy Potgieter, Liz Roberts-Parry and Laura Moseley. The TBC self-titled album sold more than expected, due to the girls touring so much. The album also received a 10/10 review from popular Christian radio station, Cross Rhythms. Giving the girls high hopes for the future and catching something different in the Christian music market. This album had high energy pop, with an r'n'b influence throughout most of the tracks, including the rocky track, \\"Do You Know What It's Like?\\" and a contrast to a more WWMT past sound of \\"When I Get To Heaven\\". These two songs both had good reviews and also had music videos. Sugababes and the early Girls Aloud have been linked with this sound. The music of TBC became well known at Spring Harvest, popular Christian music festival and New Wine. Also expect some vocals by now solo artist/author, Shell Perris, in TBC hoody feature, \\"Loved\\". Interim line-up In 2006, the band announced a new line-up. Liz Roberts- Parry and Laura Mosely along with now Christian rock chick solo artist Shell Perris left the band. Natalie Joy Potgieter, a singer and dancer from Essex, remained along with three new members: Lucy-Jayne Wells, a dancer and singer from Tyrone ‚Äì Atlanta, Georgia (USA); Megan Howard a singer and dancer from Essex; and Rachel Holmes a dancer, rapper and singer from Manchester. A new album was set to release with a tour leading up to an album launch at the Manchester Apollo. It was decided that TBC would change their image. From doing secondary school work to Primary school. This meant their style and genre of music was to change from the more cranky r'n'b to primary school pop, only in relation to past groups such as Steps, S Club 7, S Club Juniors, or a slightly more party style Girls Aloud. Talk of the Town Talk of the Town was the band's second album, and launched the band further into the Christian music scene. The album received very positive reviews, mostly towards the work in which the girls were doing. Natalie Joy Potgieter had cut her hair from long and red to short and blonde. People warmed to the new line-up. All went smoothly as they launched their new album Talk of the Town at the Manchester Apollo. The crowd was a wide age range. This seemed like a popular new audience for the all new style TBC. The performance included special guests, Thebandwithnoname and support from the \\"Pop Connection Touring Choir\\". The title track \\"Talk of the Town\\" alongside \\"Faithful\\", \\"Nobody Loves Me Like You Do\\" and \\"One Summer's Day\\" have a genre similar to The Beatles and rock chick musical Grease. Whereas their other song, with music video, \\"We'll Keep on Dancing\\", was a contrast in pop, sounding similar to the likes of \\"Saturday Night Fever\\". Popular with the older TBC audience is the only r'n'b flavoured track \\"I Will Always Love You\\". Production crafted by producers in work with the Sugababes and resembling Shayne Ward. Also ending the Talk of the Town album with an almost-lullaby resemblance gives you \\"Goodnight\\" featuring the Pop Connection touring Choir. The title song \\"Talk of the Town\\" received the most airplay. Touring The girls have been touring up and down the UK since before and after their album launch. They also visit primary schools, which has been popular. The TBC girls toured South Africa successfully and also did an American tour in January 2009 visiting primary schools, taking lessons, dance workshops and church events. New line-up In April 2009, after nearly five years of work in TBC/Innervation Trust, it was time for Natalie Joy Potgieter to leave the band to move to South Africa with her husband. TBC were then a three-girl band and have been searching for a new member. They carried on touring at such events, Spring Harvest, QuobFest, and New Wine music festivals. Also continuing to do primary school work. In October 2009, Megan Howard left the group but continued with the band's main gigs until they find someone else. New album There have been rumours of a new album by TBC with a more up-to-date image. Since working with primary school, the TBC girls and their team at Innervation have understood the pop music that young children are listening to and are heading towards the sounds of the new dance hip/pop sound.

He also wrote film's screenplay and composed the music. The film features Ramya Krishna and Prakash Rai in pivotal roles, and Vanitha Vasu, Sridhar, Ramesh Bhat and Sadhu Kokila who appear in supporting roles. With the film, Ravichandran's reputation as an experimenter grew, having erected a house of 80 lakh exclusively for the film and spending heavily in filming song sequences, an unusual trend in Kannada cinema during the time. It was also the first in Kannada and second Indian film to employ SFX sound system. The film received warm reviews from film critics and won five awards at the 2001‚Äì02 Karnataka State Film Awards including the award for Second Best Film and Best Actor (Ravichandran). It was an ambitious project, but failed to succeed at the box-office, even though following the audience's hostile response after its theatrical release, almost 20 scenes were re-shot and re- edited before re-releasing it with censor acceptance. Ravichandran was said to have suffered a loss of 2 crore owing to the film's commercial failure.

Built just for the film and at a cost of 80 lakh, it was an unusual experiment by the director and producer Ravichandran at the time, considering that a similar house was erected even for Ravichandran's previous film O Nanna Nalle. Close to 80% of the film's scenes were filmed in the house. EFX sound system was employed in the film for the first time in Kannada cinema and second overall. Following the film's first theatrical release and a hostile response from the audience, close to 20 scenes of the film were re-shot and re-edit before giving it a re-release, a first of its kind in Kannada cinema. Soundtrack Ravichandran composed the film's background score, soundtracks and also wrote the lyrics for the tracks. The album consists of nine soundtracks. The album was released in late 2001, in Davangere, at an event. Critical reception The album was received well by critics upon release. But, for the lyrics, the album received appreciation. Amritamati S. of The Music Magazine reviewed the album and called it, \\"Symphonic grandeur on dumb lyrics\\". She added writing credits to the solo violin, guitar bits and the piano play among other highlights of the album. She concluded writing, \\"The quality of recording is excellent.

The McBeth family lived in rural Iowa, about four miles north of Martinsburg, and Gayno Smith had been living with them at the time. Another daughter, Patsy Lou, 15, was wounded by Smith but escaped in the night and ran to a nearby farm for help. Kellogg's six-month-old baby, Perry, was in a crib and left unharmed.

The names listed here are all in Cantonese romanisation. Nip family * Nip Fung () or Wind is one of the two protagonists. He was born in the Nip Family Village (ËÅ∂ÂÆ∂Êùë) in Jiuquan. He specialises in kick styles of martial arts and wields the 'Snow-Drinking Saber' (Èõ™È£≤ÂàÄ), which he inherited from his ancestors. His formidable prowess in qinggong earns him the nickname \\"God in the Winds\\" (È¢®‰∏≠‰πãÁ•û). The \\"Berserk Blood\\" (ÁòãË°Ä), which runs in him and his family, will increase his powers drastically when he is angered, but the side effect is that he will enter a state of uncontrollable rage and become a monstrous beast in human form. In contrast with Cloud, Wind is more friendly and empathetic towards others. He appears attractive to women and has many admirers, due to his gentlemanly behaviour, kindness and good looks. * Nip Yan-wong (), nicknamed \\"Wild Saber of the North\\" (ÂåóÈ£≤ÁãÇÂàÄ), is Wind's father. He is a famous fighter in the jianghu and shares equal fame as Duen Sui. After marrying Ngan Ying, he retired from the jianghu, had a son with her, and became a farmer. When his wife abandoned him, he was affected emotionally and unconsciously triggered the \\"Berserk Blood\\" syndrome in him. He duelled with Duen Sui outside Lingyun Cave but their fight was interrupted by the appearance of the Fire Qilin. They were dragged into the cave by the monster and presumed dead. In fact, they survived and chanced upon the Dragon Pulse ‚Äì the spiritual foundation of the Chinese empire ‚Äì and decided to dedicate their lives to defending the relic. They remained in the cave until Tin-wong and his men intruded to steal the Dragon Pulse, after which they reappeared in the jianghu to defend the relic. Wind trusted Duen Long wrongly and asked him to help him take care of his parents, but Duen Long murdered them. * Ngan Ying () is Nip Yan-wong's wife and Wind's mother. She was seduced by Po-kwan and decided to leave her family to join her new lover. Po-kwan presented her to Lord Godless later in exchange for learning a powerful skill from Godless. She willingly becomes Godless's concubine and bore him a son, Juet-tin. After Juet-tin is killed by Wind, she regrets her decision to abandon her family. Wind trusted Duen Long wrongly and asked him to help him take care of his parents, but Duen Long murdered them. * Nip Ying () was the ancestor of the Nip family. At a young age, Nip Ying was already very famous in the jianghu for his prowess in martial arts. Once, the Fire Qilin was ravaging the land, so Nip Ying decided to confront the monster and slay it. He managed to injure the Fire Qilin but accidentally swallowed some of its blood. As a result, he developed the \\"Berserk Blood\\" syndrome, which was then passed on to his descendants. He left his loved ones to prevent himself from harming them when he goes mad, and seeks help from his friend Ngou Yat, the master of Sword Worshipping Villa. After examining the problem together, Ngou Yat and Nip Ying realised that the way to curb Nip Ying's syndrome was to forge an 'icy' weapon to keep his 'fiery' temperament under control. Ngou Yat started forging the 'Ultimate Best Sword in the World' (Áµï‰∏ñÂ•ΩÂäç) for Nip Ying, but did not live to see its completion because the process lasted numerous decades. Nip Ying ultimately went berserk and became a menace to the jianghu. When he regained his senses, he confined himself in Lingyun Cave and died there before a cure was found for him. * Dai-yee-mung (), literally Second Dream, is Second Saber Emperor's daughter and only child. She learnt saber techniques from her father in her childhood and later learnt sword movements from Sword Emperor. Her father's skills are aggressive and masculine in nature, while Sword Emperor's are 'soft' and more feminine, so the two types of neigong she acquired from these two different sets of skills clashed with each other and resulted in the forming of a red mark on her face. She meets Wind, falls in love with him and bears him a son, Yik-fung. She dies from poisoning. * Yik-fung (), nicknamed \\" Little Evil King\\" (Â∞èÈÇ™Áéã), is Wind and Second Dream's son. He wields the Great Evil King Blade (Â§ßÈÇ™Áéã), a weapon of evil aura as told in jianghu legends. As a child, Yik-fung is cunning, highly intelligent and opportunistic. He has a much more complicated personality than his morally upright and heroic father. Although he exhibits chivalrous and virtuous traits, he also committed a fair share of evil deeds. Bou family * Bou Ging-wan () or Cloud is one of the two protagonists. He was born in the Bou Family Village (Ê≠•ÂÆ∂Êùë) in Hangzhou. His father died when he was young, so his mother remarried Fok Bou-tin and he became Fok's stepson and was renamed 'Fok Ging-gok' (ÈúçÈ©öË¶∫). He reverted to his birth name after the Fok family was massacred by Lord Conqueror's men, who took him to Under Heaven Society. He specialises in palm styles of martial arts and wields the 'Ultimate Greatest Sword in the World' (Áµï‰∏ñÂ•ΩÂäç), which he seized from Sword-Worshipping Villa. In contrast with Wind, Cloud appears cold and unsympathetic towards everyone except for a select few, whom he cares for and respects, but he does not know how to express his emotions. He appears brutal and ruthless for his practice of killing every single opponent in a group of foes. He is also nicknamed the \\"God of Death Who Does Not Cry\\" (‰∏çÂì≠Ê≠ªÁ•û) because he evokes a feeling of death and strikes fear in the hearts of many. * Bou Yuen-ting () is Cloud's father. He was a famous swordsmith and left home in search of cold iron to forge a sword. He died of illness when Cloud was four years old. * Yuk-nung () is Cloud's mother. When Cloud was born, he did not cry like any normal infant and did not make any sound. His father died when he was four, but Cloud did not feel sad because he had never seen his father before. Yuk-nung thought that her son was devoid of human emotions and beat him. She gradually started to hate her son for his emotionless behaviour and began to neglect and ignore him. As such, Cloud grew up to be a loner. A year after her husband died, Yuk- nung remarried Fok Bou-tin. She died when Cloud was eight years old. * Fok Bou-tin () is Cloud's stepfather. Yuk-nung remarried Fok Bou-tin after Bou Yuen-ting's death, so Cloud became Fok's stepson. Fok renamed Cloud 'Fok Ging- gok' and treated him like his own son, even after Cloud's mother died. When Cloud was nine, Fok became seriously ill and Cloud remained by his side until he recovered. Fok taught Cloud his famous skill, the Fok Family Swordplay (ÈúçÂÆ∂ÂäçÊ≥ï), and Cloud felt happy for the first time in his life. However, Fok and his family were massacred by Lord Conqueror's men one year later. Cloud witnessed everything and was taken to Under Heaven Society, where he became Conqueror's apprentice. He bore a grudge against Conqueror and secretly plotted to avenge his stepfather. * Yu Chor-chor () is Yu Ngok's daughter. She fell in love with Cloud and became emotionally connected with him. She was raped by Kim-san and became pregnant with Kim-san's child, but Cloud still loved her and married her and raised Kim-san's son as his own. They were separated for 12 years after Cloud got injured, lost his memory, and started a family with Violet. Both Chor-chor and her son Bou Wan were murdered by Duen Long. * Bou Wan () is Kim-san and Yu Chor-chor's son, conceived as a consequence of Kim-san raping Chor-chor when Kim-san was under Po-kwan's influence. He was raised as Cloud's son even though his biological father is Kim-san. He is killed along with his mother by Duen Long. * Tze-ying (), or Violet, is the daughter of a fisherman. She chanced upon Cloud after he was injured in a fight, and saved him. Cloud temporarily lost his memory due to the fall and is grateful to her for saving his life. He marries her, has two children ‚Äì Bou Tin and Bou Ting ‚Äì with her and lives with them for some time until he regains his memory. * Bou Tin () is Cloud's second son but first biological son, born to Cloud's second wife Violet. He is heavily influenced by his father and started practising martial arts. He is killed by Yik-fung, who has lost his senses. * Bou Ting () is Cloud and Violet's daughter. Duen family * Duen Sui (), nicknamed \\"Sword Chief of the South\\" (ÂçóÈ∫üÂäçÈ¶ñ), is Duen Long's father. He wields the 'Fire Qilin Sword' (ÁÅ´È∫üÂäç) and shares equal fame as Nip Yan-wong for his prowess in martial arts. He engaged Nip Yan-wong in a duel outside Lingyun Cave but their fight was interrupted by the Fire Qilin. They were dragged into the cave by the monster and presumed dead. In fact, they survived and chanced upon the Dragon Pulse ‚Äì the spiritual foundation of the Chinese empire ‚Äì inside the cave and decided to dedicate their lives to defending the relic. They remained in the cave until Tin-wong and his men intruded to steal the Dragon Pulse, after which they reappeared in the jianghu to defend the relic. He lost half of his right arm to Nip Fung, who had entered a demonic trance. He is unable to stop his treacherous son Duen Long from terrorising the jianghu after the latter morphed into the Qilin Demon. He disappeared from the jianghu after Duen Long's death and is eventually killed by his wicked grandson Lam Mou. * Duen Long (), whose name literally means Breaking Wave, is Duen Sui's son. He first met Wind when their fathers were duelling outside Lingyun Cave and they became friends. They were brought back to Under Heaven Society by Lord Conqueror, but encountered different fates. Wind became Conqueror's student while Duen Long was treated like a slave. He was forced by Conqueror to engage Cloud in a contest but lost, and was teased by his fellows. He killed one of them in anger and escaped from Under Heaven Society. He found his father's 'Fire Qilin Sword' later and was gradually influenced by the weapon's evil aura. Out of jealousy, he betrays Wind and Cloud numerous times and often resorts to Machiavellian means to achieve his goals. By chance, he consumes two fragments of the shattered Dragon Orb and his powers increase dramatically and he morphs into the Qilin Demon. He murders Wind and Cloud's loved ones to force them to fight him, but is eventually defeated and killed by Wind and Cloud. * Dou Wan-ling () is Duen Long's lover and the mother of San-fung and Lam Mou. * San-fung () is Duen Long and Dou Wan-ling's son, and Lam Mou's twin brother. When San-fung and Lam Mou were born, their mother secretly exchanged San-fung for Wind's son. Imperial Shadow mistook San-fung for Wind's son and brought the boy back to Japan and raised him. At the age of 16, San-fung returns to China in search of Wind, whom he thought to be his father. Later, he encounters Lam Mou without knowing his true identity. Lam Mou sees that San-fung resembles him in appearance and makes use of him to achieve his aims. By chance, San-fung meets Yik-fung, Wind's real son, and rises to prominence in the jianghu with Yik- fung's help. Unlike his twin brother, San-fung values friendship and righteousness and earns the respect of many martial artists. * Lam Mou () is San-fung's twin brother, who inherited their father's evil personality. He becomes the chief of the martial arts clan, Indestructible Lam Gate (‰∏çÊªÖËóçÈñÄ). He also betrays San-fung on numerous occasions, and even killed Second Saber Emperor and Third Pig Emperor. He is captured by Heartless later and eventually died trying to save his brother. Under Heaven Society * Hung-ba (), or Lord Conqueror, is the first major antagonist in the series. He is the chief of Under Heaven Society (Â§©‰∏ãÊúÉ), the most powerful martial arts clan in the jianghu in his time. He learns from Nei-pou-sat that he will rise to prominence in the jianghu with the help of 'Wind and Cloud'. By chance, he meets two boys named Wind and Cloud and immediately accepts them as his students and teaches them martial arts. When Nei-pou-sat reveals the second half of the prophecy that Wind and Cloud are also destined to bring about his downfall, Conqueror plans to turn Wind and Cloud against each other in the hope that they will destroy each other. Man Chau-chau discovers Conqueror's plot and informs Frost, who, in turn, notifies Wind and Cloud. He is eventually defeated by Wind and Cloud. Just then, he is betrayed by his followers, the Twelve Killers of the Heavenly Pool, and becomes a fugitive in the jianghu. Nameless saves him, but on the condition that he must self- destruct his martial arts and powers so that he can never use them again to harm others. Conqueror agrees. After losing his powers, Conqueror becomes disillusioned and retreats from the jianghu to lead a secluded life with his daughter, Yau-yeuk. However, they are soon tracked down by Cloud, who is bent on seeking vengeance on Conqueror. Yau-yeuk sacrifices herself to appease Cloud. Conqueror loses his will to live after seeing his daughter die, and commits suicide by throwing himself onto the blade of Cloud's sword. * Yau- yeuk () is Conqueror's daughter. Her father is very protective of her and makes her stay in a secluded area far away from his followers. She is attracted to Wind and maintains a strong crush on him and often disguises herself as him. She dies when Kim-san pushes her towards the blade of Cloud's sword. * Chun Seung (), or Frost, is Conqueror's eldest student and the senior of Wind and Cloud. He is not as accomplished as his juniors in terms of martial arts, but is very loyal towards his master, who highly trusts him. He is tactful, clam and kind. When he hears about Conqueror's plan to make Wind and Cloud destroy each other, he quickly informs his juniors and decides to help them. He is killed by Duen Long while defending the Dragon Pulse. * Hung Ci () is a servant girl in Under Heaven Society. She is used by Conqueror as a pawn in his scheme to make Wind and Cloud destroy each other. Conqueror knows that Cloud is in love with her, but still forces her to marry Frost in order to make Cloud angry. Cloud is unwilling to give up and has several intimate moments with Hung Ci behind Frost's back. When Wind discovers their affair, Cloud challenges him to a fight to the death. Hung Ci is killed by Cloud while using her body to shield Wind from Cloud's attack. Before her death, she confesses that the one she truly loved is Wind. Cloud is unable to accept the truth and flees with her dead body. He buries her in an imperial mausoleum later and places an item called the 'Icy Soul' in her mouth to prevent her body from decaying. * Man Chau-chau () is Conqueror's obsequious personal attendant. By chance, he discovers his master's plan to make Wind and Cloud destroy each other. After he escapes from Under Heaven Society, Conqueror sends Frost to kill him. He tells Frost the truth, and Frost informs Wind and Cloud in turn. He is slain by the Twelve Killers of the Heavenly Pool. * Suet Ngam-tin (), literally Snow Darkened Sky, and nicknamed \\"Blood-Drinking Skeleton\\" (È£≤Ë°ÄÈ™∑È´è), is from Under Heaven Society. He is defeated by Cloud and becomes Cloud's servant. He pretends to be loyal to Cloud but secretly plots to kill Cloud. He fails but Cloud spares his life.

They betray Conqueror when he is seriously injured and take control of Under Heaven Society. ** Tung-wong (), literally Child Emperor, is the leader of the 12. He practises a special skill that makes him look like a child despite his age. He seizes control of Under Heaven Society but is later subdued by Juet-mou-san after Conqueror's downfall. He joins Dai-sik-tin's clan, Heaven's Gate, later. ** Hei-bou (), literally Theatre Jewel, is a masked fighter. He fought with Yu Ngok in his younger days and was disfigured as a result.

Matchless City * Kim-sing (), literally Sword Saint, and originally named Duk-gu Kim (), is a highly revered swordsman. He started learning swordplay at the age of five and rose to prominence when he was 13. He created the skill 'Saintly Soul Swordplay' (ËÅñÈùàÂäçÊ≥ï) and used it to fight the assassin organisation Heavenly Pool. After a battle that lasted seven days and seven nights, all but 12 of the 108 assassins were slain by Sword Saint. Sword Saint shares equal fame as Nameless, as there is a saying that goes, \\"Nameless in the South, Sword Saint in the North\\" (ÂçóÁÑ°ÂêçÔºåÂåóÂäçËÅñ) to describe them. He lost to Nameless once and decided to retire from the jianghu, only to return when his younger brother Duk-gu Yat-fong was killed by Lord Conqueror's men. He goes to Under Heaven Society to confront Conqueror and his soul leaves his body to fight Conqueror when he performs the final movement in his 'Saintly Soul Swordplay'. Sword Saint dies when Cloud accidentally hits his body and causes his soul to be disintegrated. Cloud later finds the 'Saintly Soul Swordplay' manual and uses some of its movements against the Twelve Killers of the Heavenly Pool and scare them away. Sword Saint is succeeded by Long-yee, who becomes the second Sword Saint. * Duk-gu Yat-fong () is the master of Matchless City (ÁÑ°ÈõôÂüé). He forms an alliance with Lord Conqueror but breaks up later. Conqueror sends Wind to kill him but he has already died 20 years ago while watching Nameless duel with Po-kwan in Sword School.

He is regarded as a jianghu legend for his supremacy in martial arts, especially swordsmanship. He attains the philosophical level of \\"Heavenly Sword\\" (Â§©Âäç), the highest level of mastery any swordsman can achieve. Such is his sheer power that he can even perform swordplay without the physical existence of a sword, by using his fingers as swords or emitting energy from his body equivalent to the sharp blades of swords. He used to carry the \\"Hero Sword\\" (Ëã±ÈõÑÂäç) as his weapon but passes it to his apprentice Kim-san later. * Kim-san (), whose name literally means Dawn of the Sword, is Nameless's first apprentice. He was named by his master, who wants him to shine like the morning sun and yet not be unbearable. He is innately kind- hearted and behaves like a true gentleman. Po-kwan exploits his weakness and manipulates him into turning towards evil. He is tricked into consuming drugs that makes him commit a series of atrocities, including poisoning his master and raping Yu Chor-chor. He inherits his master's weapon, the \\"Hero Sword\\" (Ëã±ÈõÑÂäç). * Po-kwan (), whose name is based on one of the three stars of the Sha Po Lang and literally means Destroyer of Armies, is Nameless's former classmate. Both of them were mentored by Po-kwan's father. In contrast with Nameless, Po-kwan is spoilt, arrogant and rowdy. He swore adversity towards Nameless ever since the latter saved a woman from being sexually harassed by him. That woman became Nameless' wife later. Nameless and Po-kwan had a duel to decide who will inherit their school's most powerful skill, the \\"Origin of All Swords\\" (Ëê¨ÂäçÊ≠∏ÂÆó). Nameless was on the verge of winning when Po-kwan's father froze the entire school to prevent his son from losing. The contest ended without a victor; Po-kwan and Nameless left their frozen school. During the duel, Nameless inflicted Po-kwan with a red scar on his left forehead. Po-kwan fled to Japan and continued practising martial arts there. He acquires a pair of powerful weapons: the Heavenly Blade (Â§©ÂàÉ) and Greedy Wolf (Ë≤™Áãº; based on another star of the Sha Po Lang).

He sets foot on Chinese soil and attempts to dominate the jianghu and the whole of China. Wind and Cloud are unable to defeat him initially for his formidable prowess in martial arts.

It has been listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 2008 under its former scientific name P. bengalensis rabori as its range is estimated to be less than , and the population was thought to be decreasing.  Taxonomy  Prionailurus bengalensis rabori was proposed in 1997 by anthropologist Colin Groves on the basis of morphological analysis of a skin and skull. He considered it a leopard cat subspecies. Results of phylogeographic research show that Sunda leopard cats from Borneo, Sumatra and the Philippine islands are genetically very similar. The Sunda leopard cat probably reached the Philippine islands from Borneo after the eruption of Toba Volcano during the late Pleistocene glaciation. It has therefore been subsumed to P. javanensis sumatranus in 2017.  Characteristics  The fur of the Visayan leopard cat is dark ochre to buffy fawn with large and dark spots. Its skull is a little narrower than of Sumatran leopard cat and Bornean leopard cat.  Distribution and habitat  The Visayan leopard cat is endemic to the Philippine islands of Panay and Negros where it inhabits remnant forest fragments. In Cebu, it has also been recorded in sugarcane farms. It is probably locally extinct or close to extinction on the islands of Cebu and Masbate.

The world's first closed circuit flight took place at nearby Chalais-Meudon, in the La France airship designed and flown by Charles Renard and Arthur Constantin Krebs on 9 August 1884. It flew around Villacoublay during its 23-minute flight. In 1897, Clement Ader tested his Avion III on a circular track at nearby Satory with total lack of success. Count Charles de Lambert owned 2 Wright biplanes. In 1910 his flying field flooded, and he was moving the aircraft by oxcart when he needed to stop in Villacoublay, at a farm whose owner, Paul Dautier, had the previous year permitted an aircraft, designed by Alfred de Pischof and Paul Koechlin to fly from his land. Dautier offered Lambert his fields as a base for the aircraft. The Count accepted and, as holder of the Wrights' patents, set up the Wright-Astra flying school later that year. Louis Breguet followed, and set up an aircraft factory and flying school in July 1911. The Morane Brothers joined in, buying fields around the original farm in February 1912 to establish their school, and the Nieuport flying school followed that November. The French Army had also arrived in 1910, using it for aircraft testing, one of the first tests being of air-to- ground radio. The ground‚Äôs proximity to Paris meant that Military Aeronautics, which was created in 1912, used the airfield to give demonstrations to high- ranking officials, performed in March and September 1912. The first flight test conducted by the Service Technique de l'A√©ronautique (STA√©) took place here in the same year, and the airfield remained a military flight test centre until World War II. Soci√©t√© Astra, an established buider of airships and balloons, had acquired the licence to build Wright designs in 1909, and set up workshops at Villacoublay in 1912. They developed their own designs, the Astra C and Astra CM, which were built here. In 1914 Louis Breguet expanded his workshops, moving into old Michelin works nearby. It became a main manufacturing base until in 1936 when Breguet and the works were taken over by the government-owned Arsenal de l'A√©ronautique. Activity continued unabated during World War I, and during the 1920s and 1930s many air shows and flying events were held at the airfield, and there particularly big shows in 1937 and 1938. Marcel Bloch also set up facilities here, the company's first military aircraft, the MB.80, making its first flight at the airfield in the summer of 1930. The field was divided into two main areas, with commercial activity to the north, and military activity to the south, both sharing the flying field. At the beginning of World War II French fighter units moved in to help defend Paris, but on 3 June 1940 the airfield was badly bombed by the Luftwaffe. The base was soon evacuated, and the Germans occupied it on 13 June. German use during World War II Seized by the Germans in June 1940 during the Battle of France, Villacoublay was used as a Luftwaffe military airfield during the occupation.

The attacks were timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also the P-51 Mustang fighter-escort groups of Eighth Air Force would drop down on their return to England and attack the base with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.Derived from information in USAAF Film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4) American use It was liberated by Allied ground forces about 27 August 1944 during the Northern France Campaign. Almost immediately, the USAAF IX Engineer Command 818th Engineer Aviation Battalion began clearing the base of mines and destroyed Luftwaffe aircraft; filling bomb craters in the runway with rubble and an asphalt patch along with repairing operational facilities for use by American aircraft. Subsequently, Villacoublay became a USAAF Ninth Air Force combat airfield, designated as \\"A-42\\" about 30 August, only a few days after its capture from German forces.IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields General Construction Information Almost immediately, the 48th Fighter Group moved into the repaired air base, flying P-47 Thunderbolts from 29 August until 15 September 1944. The combat unit moved east along with the advancing Allied forces and Villacoublay became a supply and maintenance base for combat aircraft, becoming the home of the 370th Air Service Group and several Air Materiel squadrons from Air Technical Service Command. It was also given the designation of AAF-180. In addition, numerous C-47 Skytrain squadrons moved in and out, supporting airborne operations, including Operation Varsity, and Allied airborne crossing of the Rhine in March 1945.Johnson, David C.

Historically, this classification was used to indicate increasing power of programming styles. Later writers have somewhat redefined the meanings as distinctions previously seen as important became less significant to current practice. Generations First Generation (1GL) Examples: machine-level programming languages A first-generation programming language (1GL) is a machine-level programming language.\\"Computer Hope, Generation languages\\" A first generation (programming) language (1GL) is a grouping of programming languages that are machine level languages used to program first- generation computers. Originally, no translator was used to compile or assemble the first-generation language. The first-generation programming instructions were entered through the front panel switches of the computer system. The instructions in 1GL are made of binary numbers, represented by 1s and 0s. This makes the language suitable for the understanding of the machine but far more difficult to interpret and learn by the human programmer. Second Generation (2GL) Examples: assembly languages Second-generation programming language (2GL) is a generational way to categorize assembly languages. Third Generation (3GL) Examples: C, C++, C#, Java, BASIC, Pascal, Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL 3GLs are much more machine-independent and more programmer-friendly. This includes features like improved support for aggregate data types, and expressing concepts in a way that favors the programmer, not the computer. A third generation language improves over a second-generation language by having the computer take care of non-essential details. 3GLs are more abstract than previous generations of languages, and thus can be considered higher-level languages than their first- and second- generation counterparts. First introduced in the late 1950s, Fortran, ALGOL, and COBOL are examples of early 3GLs. Most popular general-purpose languages today, such as C, C++, C#, Java, BASIC and Pascal, are also third-generation languages, although each of these languages can be further subdivided into other categories based on other contemporary traits. Most 3GLs support structured programming. Many support object-oriented programming. Traits like these are more often used to describe a language rather than just being a 3GL. Fourth Generation (4GL) Examples: SQL, Unix Shell, Oracle Reports, R 4GL languages tend to be specialized toward very specific programming domains.35th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 1002 Domain-Specific Languages for Software Engineering 4GL languages may include support for database management, report generation, mathematical optimization, GUI development, or web development. Fifth Generation (5GL) Examples: OPS5, Mercury A fifth-generation programming language (5GL) is any programming language based on problem-solving using constraints given to the program, rather than using an algorithm written by a programmer. Most constraint-based and logic programming languages and some other declarative languages are fifth-generation languages. While fourth-generation programming languages are designed to build specific programs, fifth-generation languages are designed to make the computer solve a given problem without the programmer. This way, the user only needs to worry about what problems need to be solved and what conditions need to be met, without worrying about how to implement a routine or algorithm to solve them. Fifth-generation languages are used mainly in artificial intelligence research. OPS5 and Mercury are examples of fifth- generation languages,E. Balagurusamy, Fundamentals of Computers, Mcgraw Hill Education (India), 2009, , p. 340 as is ICAD, which was built upon Lisp. KL- ONE is an example of a related idea, a frame language. History The terms \\"first generation\\" and \\"second generation\\" programming language were not used prior to the coining of the term \\"third-generation\\"; none of these three terms are mentioned in early compendiums of programming languages. The introduction of a third generation of computer technology coincided with the creation of a new generation of programming languages. The marketing for this generational shift in machines correlated with several important changes in what were called high level programming languages, discussed below, giving technical content to the second/third-generation distinction among high level programming languages as well while retroactively renaming machine code languages as first generation, and assembly languages as second generation. Initially, all programming languages at a higher level than assembly were termed \\"third-generation\\", but later on, the term \\"fourth-generation\\" was introduced to try to differentiate the (then) new declarative languages (such as Prolog and domain-specific languages) which claimed to operate at an even higher level, and in a domain even closer to the user (e.g. at a natural language level) than the original, imperative high level languages such as Pascal, C, ALGOL, Fortran, BASIC, etc. \\"Generational\\" classification of high level languages (third generation and later) was never fully precise and was later perhaps abandoned, with more precise classifications gaining common usage, such as object-oriented, declarative and functional. C gave rise to C++ and later to Java and C#, Lisp to CLOS, Ada to Ada 2012, and even COBOL to COBOL 2002, and new languages have emerged in that \\"generation\\" as well.

It was in existence from 1919 until 1989. Its functions have now largely been taken over by the higher education funding councils (OfS and UKRI in England, SFC in Scotland, HEFCW in Wales, and Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland). History The creation of the UGC was first proposed in 1904 in the report of a committee chaired by Lord Haldane. The UGC was eventually created in 1918, to address a need for a mechanism to channel funds to universities, which had historically received direct parliamentary grants, but had suffered from neglect and lack of funding during the First World War. The UGC‚Äôs role at this time was to examine the financial needs of the universities and to advise on grants, but it did not have a remit to plan for the development of universities. This situation changed after the Second World War, when the Barlow Report of 1946 recommended that the UGC take on a planning role for the university sector, to ensure that universities were adequate for national needs during post-war reconstruction. The Education Act 1944 had also aimed to increase the number of school leavers qualified to enter higher education, necessitating a period of expansion for the universities, that needed planning by the UGC. During the post-war years the UGC continued to have a strategic role in the development of the university sector, acting as a buffer between government and the interests of the universities. In 1964 responsibility for the UGC was transferred from HM Treasury to the newly constituted Department of Education and Science. The UGC had its own premises in Park Crescent, London. In the early 1980s the chairman was Edward Parkes, who oversaw cuts in university funding.

Sources conflict on the cause of the loss, with some stating that there was a mid-air collision with an Iranian Air Force Northrop F-5E Tiger II or a HESA Saeqeh, and others stating that the rotodome detached from the aircraft, striking and removing the tailplane while the aircraft was maneuvering for an emergency landing following an engine fire. Accident A military parade was held in Tehran on 22 September 2009 to mark the anniversary of the start of the 1980‚Äì1988 Iran‚ÄìIraq War, and was a send-off for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who was to give a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on 23 September. A flyby by the Iranian Air Force was part of the parade involving the AWACS-equipped Ilyushin-76MD as well as Northrop F-5E Tiger IIs and HESA Saeqeh aircraft. Sources vary on the cause of the accident. Some state that a fire developed in one of the engines, and that the radome detached when the aircraft was attempting to make an emergency landing on runway 29L at Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport. The detached radar dome struck the tail fin, removing it and caused loss of control which led to the aircraft crashing. Other sources state that the Il-76MD and one of the escorts collided in mid- air over the site of the tomb of former Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeni. The Ilyushin subsequently crashed in flames 15 km northwest of Varamin, killing all seven crew members on board. Some reports state that no mayday call was made, indicating a sudden event while other reports indicate that there was an emergency call from the aircraft with the pilot reporting an engine fire and calling for an emergency landing. The accident was initially reported on the Islamic Republic News Agency website, but was withdrawn 5 hours later. A video of burning wreckage from the military aircraft surrounded by fire trucks was also shown on state TV. However, president Ahmadinejad made no mention of it during his speech at the parade. A video of the crash appeared on YouTube on 3 June 2011, showing the stricken IL-76MD with its rear fuselage missing, spiraling down out of control and then impacting the ground. The appearance of the video was reported in the Huffington Post. Aircraft involved IL-76 The aircraft involved was an Ilyushin Il-76MD Adnan 2, a Soviet- built transport aircraft, later converted to an AWACS system by the Iraqi Military Industrialization Corporation for the Iraqi Air Force called the Ilyushin Il-76MD Adnan 2. It had been flown from Iraq to Iran in 1991 during the First Gulf War, given serial number 5-8209 and renamed from \\"Baghdad\\" to \\"Simorgh\\" (a flying creature of Iranian fable which performs wonders in mid- flight). After arrival in Iran, Russian technicians had reportedly upgraded the aircraft and installed a newer Iranian-made radar, which could trace flying objects within a range. The aircraft came into service in April 2008 and was the only AWACS-equipped Iranian aircraft. Possible second aircraft If a mid-air collision was the cause of the accident, some sources state that the second aircraft involved was a Northrop F-5E Tiger II.

As a two-year-old he was beaten by Golden Fleece on his debut but went on to win the Beresford Stakes. In the following year he was again beaten by Golden Fleece in a trial race but went on to win four Group One races: the Prix du Jockey Club, Irish Derby, Benson & Hedges Gold Cup and Joe McGrath Memorial Stakes. He was rated the best middle-distance horse in Europe in 1982 by Timeform. He was retired to stud at the end of his three-year-old season and became a successful sire of winners. Background Assert was a bay horse with a white blaze and three socks bred in Ireland by the Moyglare Stud. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Be My Guest, an American-bred stallion who won the Waterford Crystal Mile when trained in Ireland by Vincent O'Brien. Be My Guest's other offspring included On The House, Pentire Go and Go and Luth Enchantee. Assert's dam Irish Bird, was a half-sister of Irish Ball, a colt who finished third in the Epsom Derby before winning the Irish Derby in 1971. A year before foaling Assert, Irish Bird had produced Bikala, who won the Prix du Jockey-Club 1981. Another of her foals was Eurobird, a filly who won the Irish St. Leger. As a yearling Assert was sent to the ales in France and was bought for 160,000 francs (approximately ¬£16,000) and entered the ownership of Robert Sangster. He was trained throughout his racing career by David O'Brien. Racing career 1981: two-year-old season Assert made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over one mile at Leopardstown Racecourse in September. He showed his inexperience (ran \\"very green\\") but finished second behind the impressive winner Golden Fleece. Three weeks later he was (theoretically at least) moved up in class for the Group Three Beresford Stakes over a mile at the Curragh. Ridden by Christy Roche, he took the lead early in the straight and won easily by four lengths from the odds-on favourite Longleat. On his final appearance of the year, Assert was sent to England for the Group One William Hill Futurity at Doncaster Racecourse. He started third favourite but finished eighth of the thirteen runners behind Count Pahlen. 1982: three-year-old season Assert began his three-year-old season in the Nijinsky Stakes over ten furlongs in May in which he again finished second to Golden Fleece. Two weeks later, Assert was moved up in distance for the Gallinule Stakes over one and a half miles at the Curragh and recorded a wide-margin victory over Rivellino. Golden Fleece was Sangster's representative in the Epsom Derby and so Assert was sent to contest the French equivalent, the Prix du Jockey Club over 2400m at Chantilly Racecourse four days later. Starting the 2.2/1 favourite he took the lead from Real Shadai in the straight and pulled clear to win by three lengths. He was the first foreign trained-horse to win the race since its inception in 1836. Three weeks later, Assert started 4/7 favourite for the Irish Derby at the Curragh, with the American-bred, British-trained Silver Hawk appearing to provide his only serious opposition. Assert took the lead and quickly went clear of the field to win very easily from Silver Hawk by a margin officially recorded as eight lengths (Timeform made it ten lengths). Assert became the first horse to win both the Prix du Jockey Club and Irish Derby. Assert was then matched against older horses for the first time in Britain's most prestigious weight-for-age race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over one and a half miles at Ascot Racecourse on 24 July. He started the 10/11 favourite ahead of his half-brother Bikala who had beaten a strong field in the Prix Ganay on his previous start. The other main contenders were Kalaglow, Height of Fashion and Glint of Gold. Assert went past Bikala on the turn into the straight and held off a strong challenge from Glint of Gold, but was caught inside the final furlong and beaten a neck by Kalaglow. On 17 August Assert was ridden by Pat Eddery in the eleventh running of the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse. Starting the 4/5 favourite against six British-trained opponents, he took the lead from the start and pulled clear in the straight vo win easily by six lengths from Norwick. A month later, Assert started the 1/4 favourite for the Joe McGrath Memorial Stakes over ten furlongs. With Roche back in the saddle, he went eight lengths clear in the straight before being eased down to win by three lengths from Kind of Hush. Timeform described the race as being \\"little more than an exercise gallop\\" for the winner. On 3 October, Assert started 5/2 favourite for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on very soft ground at Longchamp Racecourse. He was well-positioned turning into the straight but dropped away in the closing stage and finished eleventh of the seventeen runners behind Akiyda. Assessment In 1981, Assert was given a rating of 113 by the independent Timeform organisation, nineteen pounds below their top-rated two- year-old colt Wind and Wuthering. In the official International Classification he was rated thirteen pounds behind the top-rated Green Forest. In the following season he was rated the second-best three-year-old in Europe (and the joint-second-best horse of any age) behind Golden Fleece. Timeform rated him on 134, a pound ahead of Golden Fleece and level with Ardross and Green Forest as the best horse of the year. He was also named the year's best middle-distance horse by Timeform. Stud record At the end of his three- year-old season, Assert was syndicated with an estimated value of $25,000,000 and sent to North America to become a breeding stallion at the Windfield Farm in Maryland. He sired many good winners including Dancehall (Grand Prix de Paris), Lecroix (Union-Rennen), Tzar Rodney (Prix La Force), Timely Assertion (Santa Anita Oaks), Square Cut (San Luis Obispo Handicap), All My Dreams (Deutsches Derby), Betty Lobelia (Miss Grillo Stakes), Nomadic Way (Stayers' Hurdle, Cesarewitch Handicap, Irish Champion Hurdle), Running Flame (Hollywood Turf Cup). Pedigree * Assert was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Nearco, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

It is standardised as CENELEC EN 50157-1. The Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) communication channel in HDMI and PDMI is based on AV.link. Electrical characteristics AV.Link uses a single wire in an open collector configuration. It is passively pulled up to 3 or 3.3 V, and may be pulled down by any device on the bus. Total bus capacitance is a maximum of 7300 pF (ten devices at 100 pF each, plus nine cables at 700 pF), and signal transitions are correspondingly slow: 333 bit/s, with 50 Œºs fall time and 250 Œºs rise time. Each bit transferred begins with a falling edge. The duration of the low period determines the value. Data bits are 2.4¬±0.35 ms long, with 1 bits having a low period of 0.6¬±0.2 ms, and 0 bits having a low period of 1.5¬±0.2 ms. Receivers observe the data line at 1.05¬±0.2 ms after the falling edge to determine the bit's value. Every message begins with a special start bit, 4.5¬±0.2 ms long, with a low period of 3.7¬±0.2 ms. A transmitter must listen to the bus as it transmits; the receiver may hold it low, turning a transmitted 1 bit into a 0 bit. This is done, for example, to acknowledge a transmission. If a receiver detects an error in the received data, it holds the bus low for 3.6¬±0.24 ms; this causes the transmitter to abort the message and retry from the beginning. A message consists of a start bit, followed by a series of data bytes. Each byte is actually transmitted as 10 bits: * 8 data bits, most significant bit first, * An end-of-message bit is 0 to indicate that more bytes are being transmitted, or 1 to indicate not, and * An acknowledge bit is transmitted as 1, but overwritten to a 0 bit by the receiver to acknowledge receipt. ** For broadcast messages, the acknowledge bit is inverted: it is overwritten to 0 if any receiver rejects the message. Each message begins with an address byte specifying the 4-bit initiator and recipient addresses. If two initiators begin transmitting at the same time, one of them will transmit a 0 bit while the other transmits a 1 bit, and the latter will observe the conflict and cease transmitting until the bus is idle again. (Note that it must be prepared for the case that the incoming message is addressed to it.) An address byte sent with EOM=1 is a simple \\"ping\\" to check if the addressed device exists and is powered on. Otherwise, it is followed by an opcode byte, and parameters as required by the opcode. When a device is powered on, it chooses an address and sends a ping to see if that address is claimed by another device. If no acknowledge is received, the address is free and may be kept. Otherwise, the device tries another address.

(1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama. After the war, the base was completely rebuilt. An 8000' new jet runway was laid down along with two circular marguerite systems of hardstands that could be revetted later with earth for added protection. The Marguerite consist of fifteen to eighteen hardstands around a semicircular taxiway. Each hardstand can hold one or two aircraft, and allows the planes to be spaced approximately 150 feet (46 m) apart. Each marguerite is dispersed at each end of the runway, allowing the aircraft to be launched quickly. Each squadron is assigned to a separate hangar/hardstand complex. The wartime main runway was extended to become the taxiway for the new jet runway. Additional dispersed aircraft parking, ramp space and hangars were also constructed, along with a completely new administrative and personnel area. A 4000' grass runway was also constructed for glider and small aircraft landings. Bricy will be the home of the upcoming Airbus A400M new European tactical cargo aircraft for the French Air Force.

The episode aired on February 16, 2010, on ABC. It was directed by Tucker Gates and written by executive producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and producer Melinda Hsu Taylor. John Locke is the character the episode is centered on. In 2007, The Man in Black, while impersonating John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), attempts to recruit James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway) and reveals the survivors' purpose on the Island. Meanwhile, Jacob's (Mark Pellegrino) bodyguards, led by Ilana Verdansky (Zuleikha Robinson), decide to bury the corpse of the real John Locke. In the \\"flash-sideways\\", Locke, still wheelchair-bound, deals with the difficulties of his life. Plot 2004 (flash-sideways timeline) John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) arrives at his home, after returning from Australia on Flight 815. He is greeted by his fianc√©e, Helen Norwood (Katey Sagal), whom he is set to marry shortly, in a wedding also apparently to be attended by his father. Helen encourages Locke to call Dr. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), who previously offered to evaluate Locke's condition. Locke declines to do so because he doesn't believe in miracles and wants Helen to love him for who he is; they reaffirm their love for one another. Locke returns to work, where his supervisor, Randy (Billy Ray Gallion), confronts Locke about Locke's failure to attend a company conference while in Sydney. Locke attempts to apologize, but Randy abruptly fires him. As he leaves the building, Locke comes into contact with Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), the owner of the company, who refers Locke to a temp agency that he also owns. At the temp agency, Rose Nadler (L. Scott Caldwell) sympathizes with Locke's handicap because of her own battle with cancer. Rose denies his request to work at a construction company because his handicap will make this impossible. In addition, Locke tells Helen why he lost his job and admits that he went to Australia to go on a walkabout, but was not allowed to do so. Rose eventually finds him work as a substitute teacher at a school where Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) also works as a history teacher. 2007 (original timeline) The Man in Black, in the form of Locke, attempts to recruit both Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) and James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway) for his quest to leave the island. Sawyer immediately realizes that the Man in Black is not Locke, because Locke was always scared and the Man in Black is not. He separately promises each of them answers about the island; Richard refuses and Sawyer agrees to travel with him. While in the jungle, they both see a young boy (the Man in Black is surprised that Sawyer can see him as well), whom the Man in Black chases. The boy tells him, \\"You know the rules; you can't kill him.\\" At this, the Man in Black becomes angry and loudly declares \\"don't tell me what I can't do,\\" a phrase that the real Locke frequently used in the past. At this time, Richard speaks with Sawyer, claiming that the Man in Black's true intention is to kill everyone on the island, but runs away before he can explain further. Locke leads Sawyer to a cave, after descending via a ladder made of rope and bamboo, inside of which is a set of scales holding one black and one white stone. Locke takes the white stone and throws it into the sea, referring to it as an inside joke. Locke leads Sawyer deeper into the cave, where there are several surnames written on the ceiling and walls. The names include his own, Jarrah, Shephard, Reyes, and Kwon (referring to either Sun or Jin). Several other names are scratched out and the Man in Black crosses out \\"Locke\\". Additionally, six names correspond to one of the numbers (4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42 for Locke, Reyes, Ford, Jarrah, Shephard and Kwon, respectively). He explains that they were brought to the island by Jacob as candidates to replace him as the guardian of the island. The Man in Black claims that Jacob has manipulated the lives of all of the candidates in order to bring them to the island. Sawyer now has three options: to do nothing, to accept the job and protect the island, or to leave the island with the Man in Black, who claims that protecting the island is pointless as there's nothing to protect it from; Sawyer agrees to leave with him. Meanwhile, at the remains of the statue, Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson) and Ben discuss what happened to her companions; Ben tells her that the Man in Black killed them all, including Jacob. Ilana, who is visibly upset, takes some of the ashes of Jacob's body and informs Ben that the Man in Black is now \\"stuck\\" in the form of Locke. Outside, she tells the remaining group, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) that they must travel to the temple for protection. Sun insists that they must first bury Locke's body and travel to the survivors' original graveyard to do so. They hold an impromptu funeral, where Ben delivers a short eulogy and apologizes for murdering Locke. Reception The episode has received positive reviews, with many citing it as the best of the first four episodes. Review tally website Metacritic awarded the episode a score of 88 out of 100, indicating \\"Universal Acclaim\\". This is up on the previous episodes score of 64 out of 100.Dietz, Jason (February 17, 2010), \\"Episode Review: Last Night's Lost, Season 6, Ep. 4: 'The Substitute'\\", Metacritic. Retrieved on February 19, 2010. Chris Carbot of IGN gave the episode a highly positive review, stating that \\"Early on it's clear that Lindelof and Cuse are determined to reinvigorate some of the strong character work the show was known for during the first couple of seasons. There are some great examples of this in 'The Substitute'.\\" Overall, he gave the episode a score of 9.4 out of 10. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode and gave a perfect score. Emily VanDerWerff of Los Angeles Times also gave the episode a positive review, stating \\"There may not have been enough answers for the hyper- mythological crowd (though we got a good deal of interesting conjecture), but it was a great showcase for the finest character \\"Lost\\" ever cooked up.\\" Zap2it's Ryan McGee also praised the episode, calling the episode \\"impossibly good.\\" However, Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune was mixed about the episode, stating \\"Even as a certified \\"Lost\\" fan, I was a little frustrated with the episode at times.

He was born on June 4, 1966 in New York City. He received his bachelor's degree (Summa Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa) and an MA in Political Science in 1988 from Yale University, where he worked closely with James C. Scott, and he received his PhD in 1995 from Cornell University, where he worked under the supervision of Benedict Anderson. Sidel taught at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London, first as a lecturer in Southeast Asian Politics (1994‚Äì2001) and then as a Reader in Southeast Asian Politics (2001‚Äì2004). Sidel has written several books as well as a range of journal articles and essays in edited volumes, and he serves as co-editor of the Contemporary Issues in Asia and the Pacific Series at Stanford University Press and member of the editorial boards of the journals South East Asia Research and Indonesia and the Malay World. He has served as an occasional commentator in the media and as a consultant for a range of government and multilateral agencies, foundations, and non-governmental organizations. Research Sidel's research focuses on Southeast Asia, with expertise on the Philippines and Indonesia, where he has conducted primary research and fieldwork since the late 1980s. His research and writing to date cover three main issue areas: local politics and the persistence of subnational authoritarianism in formally democratic settings; religious violence and mobilization in the name of Islam; and the role of transnational forces in anti-colonial 'nationalist' revolutions. Sidel's research and writing are noteworthy for their interdisciplinary nature, for the contrarian nature of their contributions to existing bodies of literature, and for their efforts to bridge the divide between qualitative comparative social-science research, on the one hand, and Southeast Asian Studies, on the other. His first book, Capital, Coercion, and Crime: Bossism in the Philippines (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999) gained attention from academics, journalists,Robert W. Hefner's review essay in Volume 67, Issue 2 of the Journal of Asian Studies (2008), pp. 669 and Marc Howard Ross, Perspectives on Politics, Volume 7, Number 1 (2009), pp. 159-160 and NGO activists‚Äîby pioneering the study of subnational authoritarianism in Southeast Asia, and his work on local bosses, dynasties, and gangsters is widely cited by scholars working on Southeast Asia and other parts of the world. In this book he made the argument that democratization and decentralization facilitate the rise of subnational authoritarianism, as seen in contexts as varied as Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, and South Africa. Meanwhile, Sidel's book Philippine Politics and Society in the Twentieth Century: Colonial Legacies, Post-Colonial Trajectories (London: Routledge, 2000), co-authored with Eva-Lotta Hedman, further established his influence on the study of the Philippines. With the publication of Riots, Pogroms, Jihad: Religious Violence in Indonesia (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2006), Sidel's work attracted renewed critical attention among scholars, journalists,See - Robert W. Hefner's review essay in Volume 67, Issue 2 of the Journal of Asian Studies (2008), pp. 667-674 and policy-makers, especially in the context of rising interest in Islamist terrorism in Southeast Asia. Sidel's book offered an original explanation for the pattern of religious violence in Indonesia from the mid-1990s through 2005, linking the shifts from riots (1995‚Äì97) to pogroms (1998‚Äì2001) to jihad (2002‚Äì2005) to changes in the structures of religious identity and authority in Indonesia, and to the uncertainties and anxieties accompanying those changes. As Sadanand Dhume notes, Mr. Sidel traces the roots of religious conflict in Indonesia to Dutch rule. He contends that the Dutch system of pillarization, in which Catholics and Protestants developed their own religious schools, associations and political parties, was mimicked in Indonesia to a striking degree. A person‚Äôs religious identity‚ÄîCatholic, Protestant, nominal Muslim or orthodox Muslim‚Äîdetermined his schooling and, ultimately, his access to power through the legislature, the civil service or the military.Sadanand Dhume review in Far Eastern Economic Review, April 2008 One of the shortcomings of the work, however, is that Sidel's institutionalist argument neglects jihadists' own ideological arguments about why they engage in violent jihad. Sidel's publication of The Islamist Threat in Southeast Asia: A Reassessment] (Washington, D.C.: East-West Center, 2007) earned considerable attention, due to his attack against alarmist accounts of Islamist mobilization in Southeast Asia and his argument that violence in the name of Islam reflects the weakness, rather than the strength, of Islamist forces in the region.See Michael Vatikiotis, De-demonizing Southeast Asian Islam Asia Times Online 22 August 2007. Since 2008, Sidel has been working on broad comparative themes covering the full extent of Southeast Asia and beyond. In an article in Comparative Politics, he linked the diverging trajectories of democratization across Southeast Asia to the variegated pattern of business class formation observed across the region from the mid-19th century to the present. Forthcoming essays treat such themes as the diverging fates of nationalism across post-independence Southeast Asia, on the one hand, and the emerging body of research on so-called subnational authoritarianism across such settings as southern Italy and post-Soviet Russia. Sidel is currently researching the diverging fates of nationalism across post-independence Southeast Asia, on the one hand, and the emerging body of research on so-called subnational authoritarianism across such settings as southern Italy and post-Soviet Russia. He is also working on a major revisionist study of the 'nationalist' revolutions of Southeast Asia that stresses the role of major international conflicts and powerful transnational forces in the transitions to independence across the region. He has also begun work on a study of intolerance and persecution of religious deviance across the Muslim world, with a special focus on the treatment of the Ahmadiyya minority in a range of countries across Asia and Africa.

Reinhart (n√©e Castellanos, born October 7, 1955) is a Cuban-born American economist and the Minos A. Zombanakis Professor of the International Financial System at Harvard Kennedy School. Previously, she was the Dennis Weatherstone Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. and Professor of Economics and Director of the Center for International Economics at the University of Maryland. She is a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, a Research Fellow at the Centre for Economic Policy Research, Founding Contributor of VoxEU, and a member of Council on Foreign Relations. She is also a member of American Economic Association, Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association, and the Association for the Study of the Cuban Economy. She became the subject of general news coverage when mathematical errors were found in a research paper she co-authored. On May 20, 2020, Reinhart was appointed World Bank Chief Economist, starting on June 15, 2020. According to Research Papers in Economics (RePec). Reinhart is ranked among the top economists worldwide, based on publications and scholarly citations. She has testified before Congress and is listed among Foreign Policy's Top 100 Global Thinkers, Thompson Reuters' The World's Most Influential Scientific Minds, and Bloomberg Markets Most Influential 50 in Finance. In December 2018, Reinhart received the King Juan Carlos Prize in Economics and Nabe's Adam Smith Award. Early life Born in Havana, Cuba, Reinhart arrived in the United States on January 6, 1966, at the age of 10, with her mother and father and three suitcases. They settled in Pasadena, California, during the early years before moving to South Florida, where she grew up. When the family moved to Miami, Reinhart started college at two-year Miami Dade College, before transferring to Florida International University, where she received a B.A. in Economics (summa cum laude) in 1975. After her B.A., Reinhart worked for her Master's degree in Philosophy, eventually receiving this degree in 1981 from Columbia University. A few years down the road, Reinhart also received her Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1988.  Career  Recommended by Peter Montiel, an M.I.T. graduate teaching at FIU, Reinhart in 1978 went on to attend Columbia University graduate school. After Reinhart passed her field examinations, she was hired as an economist by Bear Stearns and rose to the investment bank's chief economist three years later. In 1988 she returned to Columbia to obtain her Ph.D. under the supervision of Robert Mundell. In the 1990s, she held several positions in the International Monetary Fund. From 2001 to 2003, she returned to the International Monetary Fund as deputy director at the Research Department. She has been the Minos A. Zombanakis Professor of the International Financial System at Harvard Kennedy School since 2012. She has served on the editorial boards of The American Economic Review, the Journal of International Economics, International Journal of Central Banking, among others. In both 2011 and 2012, she was included in the 50 Most Influential ranking of Bloomberg Markets. Outside of Reinhart's professional activities, she has received compensation for conference-related and speaking engagements, advisory boards, as well as writing and royalties. Research and publication She has written and published on a variety of topics in macroeconomics and international finance, including: international capital flows, capital controls, inflation and commodity prices, banking and sovereign debt crises, currency crashes, and contagion. Her work has been published in scholarly journals such as The American Economic Review, the Journal of Political Economy, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, and the Journal of Economic Perspectives. Her work is featured in the financial press, including The Economist, Newsweek, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal. Her book (with Kenneth Rogoff), This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, studied the striking similarities of the recurring booms and busts that have characterized financial history. Her work has helped to inform the understanding of financial crises in both advanced economies and emerging markets. It has been translated to over 20 languages and won the Paul A. Samuelson Award, among others. She also has written monthly columns for international media organization Project Syndicate since 2014. Work on the 2008 near-meltdown Fellow economist Alan Blinder credits both Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff with describing highly relevant aspects of the 2008 financial institution near-meltdown and resulting serious recession. In a normal recession such as 1991 or 2000, the Keynesian tools of tax cuts and infrastructure spending (fiscal stimulus), and lowered interest rates (monetary stimulus), will usually right the economic ship in a matter of months and lead to recovery and economic expansion. Even the serious recession of 1982, which Blinder states \\"was called the Great Recession in its day\\", fits comfortably within this category of a typical recession, which will respond to the standard tools. By contrast, the 2008 near-meltdown destroyed parts of the financial system and left other parts reeling and in serious need of de-leveraging. Large amounts of governmental debt, household debt, corporate debt, and financial institution debt were left in its wake. And because of this debt, the normal tools of tax cuts and increased infrastructure spending were somewhat less available and/or politically difficult to achieve. Indeed, economist Paul Krugman argued that even the combination of the Oct. 2008 bailout plus the Feb. 2009 bailout did not go big enough, although Blinder states that they were large compared to previous bailouts. Moreover, since interest rates were already near zero, the standard monetary tool of lowering rates was not going to provide much help. Recovery from what Blinder terms a Reinhart-Rogoff recession may require debt forgiveness, either directly or implicitly, by encouraging somewhat higher than normal rates of inflation.\\"What Did We Learn from the Financial Crisis, the Great Recession, and the Pathetic Recovery?,\\" Alan S. Blinder, Princeton University Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies Working Paper No. 243, November 2014. Criticism and controversy In 2013, Reinhart and Rogoff were in the spotlight after researchers discovered that their 2010 paper \\"Growth in a Time of Debt\\" in The American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings had methodological and computational errors. The work argued that debt above 90% of GDP was particularly harmful to economic growth, while corrections have shown this is not the case, and that the negative correlation between debt and growth does not increase above 90% as their work had contended. A separate and previous criticism is that the negative correlation between debt and growth need not be causal. Rogoff and Reinhart claimed that their fundamental conclusions were accurate, despite the errors. A review by Herndon, Ash, and Pollin of her widely cited paper with Rogoff, \\"Growth in a Time of Debt\\", argued that \\"coding errors, selective exclusion of available data, and unconventional weighting of summary statistics lead to serious errors that inaccurately represent the relationship between public debt and GDP growth among 20 advanced economies in the post-war period\\". Personal life Reinhart met her husband, Vincent Reinhart, when they were classmates at Columbia University in the late 1970s. They have one son.

Life He was the son of Richard Babington and Anne Starkey (formerly of Wrenbury Hall).Rt. Rev.

(London: Henry Colburn, 1838), Vol. IV, p. 513. He was a native of Cheshire, and was admitted to Christ's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1572. He graduated B.A. in 1576, and became a fellow also in 1576, with an M.A. from St John's College, Cambridge in 1579. He was rector of Thurcaston, Leicestershire, from 1583. He was collated to the prebend of Bishopshall, in Lichfield Cathedral, 18 September 1592, and was rector of Tatenhill, Staffordshire, from 1602. On the death of George Boleyn, Babington applied for the deanery of Lichfield unsuccessfully. On 6 July 1603 he complained to Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury that the chancellor of the diocese, Zachary Babington, had obstructed his suit and dispossessed him of his divinity lectureship. Brutus Babington memorial window in the north aisle of St Columb's Cathedral, installed c. 1860 In 1610 he was appointed to the bishopric of Derry, after some opposition from supporters of Dean William Webb. Babington was chosen as an advocate of a persuasive missionary approach to convert the native population to the reformed faith, an approach which was preferred by King James and his Privy Council. His predecessor, George Montgomery, was considered disappointing in his dedication to missionary and pastoral work and translated to Meath in 1609. Babington tried a new approach with his clergy. In his own words, he \\"did not violently go to work with them nor urge them by authority, but endeavoured rather to persuade their consciences by arguments and reasons.\\" He tried also to compromise by being content with an Oath of Allegiance instead of insisting on an Oath of Supremacy, and approving an Irish language translation of the liturgy. Babington successfully convinced one of the diocesan chapters to agree. Babington died unexpectedly early on 10 September 1611. Among Catholics his death was ascribed to a divine punishment as he suggested to Andrew Knox, Bishop of Raphoe, to destroy the wooden statue of the Virgin at Agivey. The statue was attributed to miraculous cures which drew pilgrims even from the Pale. Knox himself took the statue from Agivey, brought it to Coleraine where it was destroyed by fire in the town centre.

Clarke, first published in 1949 in the magazine Astounding Science Fiction. It was subsequently published as part of a short story collection in Expedition to Earth in 1953. Summary \\"Hide-and-Seek\\" uses the story within a story format. The frame story is told in the first person, set in a future that has interplanetary travel and has recently seen an interplanetary war. The characters are out hunting when one, Kingman, attempts to shoot a squirrel which takes refuge behind the trunk of a tree. This reminds Kingman of an incident which happened to him during the recent war. Kingman then recounts the story (in the third person) of agent K-15 who was fleeing in a space craft with vital information, pursued by the space cruiser Doradus. K-15 was 12 hours from a rendezvous with a capital ship, but the cruiser was only 6 hours behind him. To escape K-15 lands on the moon Phobos, sending his craft on broadcasting a message of his plan. He is left alone on the hostile moon to face the oncoming cruiser. However, despite the apparently overwhelming superiority the cruiser had over a man in a spacesuit armed only with a pistol, the story shows the advantage. The cruiser could only manoeuvre with difficulty so close to Phobos, while K-15 could easily outpace it on the ground. Also, despite the cruiser‚Äôs firepower, K-15‚Äôs gun gave him the advantage over any men (who would be unarmed) that the cruiser might land. At first K-15 tries to keep to the opposite side of the moon, in case the cruiser opens fire on the surface, but later realizes he is better keeping it in sight, just above his horizon. This continues until the arrival of K-15's rendezvous, and the cruiser is forced to flee, where Kingman‚Äôs story ends. Back in the frame story the narrator asks Kingman if he was, in fact, K-15. No, he replies, he wasn‚Äôt, and leaves for another shot at the squirrel. It transpires Kingman was commander of Doradus.

At the 32nd National Film Awards, the film was awarded the Best Feature Film in Kannada. It also won two awards at the 1984‚Äì85 Karnataka State Film Awards; Best Actor (Vishnuvardhan) and Best Music Director (M. Ranga Rao). In addition to this, Vishnuvardhan and Suhasini won the awards for Best Actor and Best Actress categories at the South Filmfare Awards. The film is seen as a milestone in Kannada cinema. The film was remade in Tamil as Premapasam with Sivakumar and Revathi. https://www.filmibeat.com/kannada/movies/bandhana.html Plot Doctor Harish (Vishnuvardhan) falls in love with his protege Nandini (Suhasini) but is too shy to express his feelings for her. When he finally musters the courage to tell her that he loves her, he finds out that she holds him in high esteem more as a Guru. She tells him she is unable to reciprocate his romantic love. Nandini marries an engineer Balu (Jai Jagadish), who is incidentally Harish's friend. Harish starts withdrawing into a shell. Marital problems crop between Nandini and Balu because of her dedication to her career as a doctor. Harish develops a heart enlargement condition which draws Nandini closer to him in the hospital. This frustrates Balu who accuses her of having an affair with Harish. When Nandini discovers that Balu has assaulted their house maid she decides to leave him. Harish tries to convince Balu that his relationship with Nandini is pure but Balu misbehaves with him. Harish saves Nandini's baby but dies because of his advanced heart condition. Nandini divorces her husband and moves on with her new born child. Cast * Vishnuvardhan as Doctor Harish * Suhasini as Doctor Nandini * Jai Jagadish as Balu * Roopa (actress) * G. K. Govinda Rao * Kanchana * Shivaram * Mysore Lokesh * Musuri Krishnamurthy https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1392100/fullcredits Production When director Rajendra Singh Babu cast Vishnu for a love story like Bandhana, the industry had been skeptical, for Vishnu was known more for his action roles. But the director's faith in the actor and the way Vishnu managed the role of Dr. Harish built up reputation in the industry. https://metrosaga.com/facts-about-Vishnuvardhan/ Originally Kalpana held the rights to the script and happened to give it to Babu on request, just before she passed away. In 1983 when Babu set about to make the movie, his first choice for the heroine's role was Aarati. But her date diary was full and the search for the heroine started. He happened to meet Suhasini who was acting with his sister, and immediately knew she was going to be Dr. Nandini. The film was shot in several scenic locales such as Lakya Dam, Hanumanagundi Falls, Lalitha Mahal Palace, Krishnarjuna Sagar Dam, Harangi Dam and the Grand Ashok Hotel in Bangalore.http://www.filmapia.com/where-is-it- shot/films/bandana Usha Navratnaram's novel was a literary romance that dealt with the inner feelings of the lead players. Babu with his strong command of film-making techniques, effectively adapted the novel into a screenplay rich in visuals and external drama that are required for the medium of cinema. He also showed a penchant for filming on a grander scale like the Hindi movies of the time - be it the Holi song or the prominent presence of the grand piano in the wedding song. Release The movie was certified on 26 July 1984 and was released on 24 August the same year. The songs of the movie were chart busters. Reception The movie garnered immensely positive reviews from both critics and viewers alike. The performance of Vishnuvardhan and Suhasini received high praise while the story and direction received equally high acclaim. The movie ran for 100 days in 18 theatres and 25 weeks in many first class theatres. The movie had a 30 weeks run in two theatres (a big record then) and completed 469 days of run in one movie hall. Bandhana was the highest grossing movie of the year and one of the highest grossing Kannada films of the 1980s. http://www.sandalwoodking.rocks/threads/hit-percentage- hit-quotient-of-actors.6048/page-5 Legacy In Bandhana, Vishnuvardhan played the role of a shy doctor who fails to express his love to a girl and ends up as a tragic hero by developing a fatal heart condition. The role of Dr. Harish brought him critical appreciation. The success of Bandhana was a turning point in Vishnu's career. He began acting in more family-oriented movies like Krishna Nee Begane Baro, Karunamayi, Suprabhata and carved another niche among family audience. The movie also made Dr. Vishnuvardhan - Suhasini duo a much celebrated pair onscreen. Following the immense success of Bandhana they acted together in several movies like Suprabhata, Mutthina Haara and Himapaata. The song Noorondu Nenapu from this movie was a chart buster and later inspired a 2017 movie with the song's title. https://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/kannada/movies/news/Recreating-the- Bandhana-magic/amp_articleshow/52805880.cms Home Media The video rights of the movie is shared by Sri Ganesh Video and Moser Baer.

It was founded on 23 September 2009 and was edited by Antonio Padellaro until 2015, when Marco Travaglio became the editor. History Late within 2008, Marco Travaglio was asked by fellow journalist Massimo Fini to advertise the latter's newly founded magazine, La Voce del Ribelle (\\"The Rebel's Voice\\"), on the former's blog, voglioscendere.it, with the objective of gathering \\"a few hundred subscriptions\\". Thousands of people answered, allowing Fini's magazine to succeed.La Voce del Ribelle, a year later, by Marco Travaglio on his blog. Because of this success, Travaglio started considering the idea of using his blog to launch a new newspaper, independent from public funding.

The newspaper could not just be named \\"Il Fatto\\" because RAI, the Italian public broadcast vetoed it mentioning name ownership, even if its very management was the one who put it off the air. In June 2009, l'Antefatto, a promotional website, was set up containing information about subscription and the development of the project. The publisher stated he would not use the Italian state advertising and funding to run the newspaper but instead he would use only money from sales and market advertisements.

Career Teimoc's martial arts training started during the summer of 1960 in the basement of a Buddhist church. His father believed judo, kendo, aikido, and ky≈´d≈ç were essential parts of an education, so at age of 6 he began his lifelong study of Judo. Four years later, at the 1964 World's Fair, he demonstrated the art of Judo and Kendo at the Japanese pavilion, and over the following years he progressed rapidly in both disciplines. Amongst his instructors were Kiyoshi Shiina, Wally Jay, and Jimmy Bregman.Black Belt October 1972 At the age of 16, Teimoc became one of the youngest Judo practitioners to receive the rank of Black Belt, winning titles in the Junior and Senior divisions, and in the High School Nationals the same year. He remained an accomplished high school wrestler and undefeated practitioner throughout his wrestling junior and senior career. In 1971 he qualified as an alternate for the 1972 Olympic Games, which earned him the nickname \\"The Kid\\". Four years later he captured a coveted spot on the 1976 Olympic Judo team. Teimoc retired from competition in 1990 to become Head Coach of the US Olympic training center in Colorado Springs, and two years later he returned to his home in New York City to direct the Chelsea Piers Martial Arts program. He has also maintained a teaching, coaching, and representative position for the New York Athletic Club for over 40 years. As of 2009, he is head trainer of the 5 Points Academy in Chinatown, NYC.Teimoc Johnston-Ono talks with the Fight Nerd Return to competitions After a 14-year layoff, Teimoc returned to international competitions. In order to adapt himself, he was forced to redefine his training methodology. His new approach worked well as he is not only still active in competition, but has a winning record to prove it. Today he does the majority of his strength training and conditioning at the Parisi Speed School alongside athletes from the UFC, the IFL, and the NFL. In 2003 Teimoc went to Brazil to compete in the World Masters Jiu Jitsu tournament, which he won. To date, he is undefeated and the only non-Brazilian to win both the Black Belt division and the Absolute Black Belt division. Returning in 2006, 2007 and 2008, he consecutively took back home first place awards in both divisions. He also received his Black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in 2006 under Fabricio Martins Costa. Teimoc is the only practitioner to win the prestigious World Masters competition in both Judo and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

C-K design theory or concept-knowledge theory is both a design theory and a theory of reasoning in design. It defines design reasoning as a logic of expansion processes, i.e. a logic that organizes the generation of unknown objects. The theory builds on several traditions of design theory, including systematic design, axiomatic design, creativity theories, general and formal design theories,Braha D. and Maimon O. 1998. A Mathematical Theory of Design: Foundations, Algorithms, and Applications. Springer. and artificial intelligence-based design models. Claims made for C-K design theory include that it is the first design theory that: # Offers a comprehensive formalization of design that is independent of any design domain or object # Explains invention, creation, and discovery within the same framework and as design processes. The name of the theory is based on its central premises: the distinction between two spaces: *a space of concepts C *a space of knowledge K. The process of design is defined as a double expansion of the C and K spaces through the application of four types of operators: C‚ÜíC, C‚ÜíK, K‚ÜíC, K‚ÜíK. The first draft of C-K theory was sketched by Armand Hatchuel, and then developed by Hatchuel and his colleague, Beno√Æt Weil. Recent publications explain C-K theory and its practical application in different industries.Hatchuel A., Le Masson P. & Weil B. (2004), C-K Theory in Practice: Lessons from Industrial Applications , 8th International Design Conference, D. Marjanovic, (Ed.), Dubrovnik, 18‚Äì21 May 2004: 245-257. C-K theory is a research field and a teaching area in several academic institutions in France, Switzerland, Israel, the UK, the USA, and Sweden. Genesis of C-K theory C-K theory was a response to three perceived limitations of existing design theories:Hatchuel, A and Weil, B 2003, A new approach of innovative design: an introduction to C-K theory . Proceedings of the international conference on engineering design (ICED‚Äô03), Stockholm, Sweden, pp 109‚Äì124 # Design theory when assimilated to problem solving theory is unable to account for innovative aspects of design. # Classic design theories dependent on object domains, machine design, architecture or industrial design favored design theories that were tailored to their specific knowledge bases and contexts. Without a unified design theory these fields experience difficulties over cooperation in real design situations. # Design theories and creativity theories have been developed as separate fields of research. But design theory should include the creative, surprising and serendipitous aspects of design; while creativity theories have been unable to account for intentional inventive processes common in design fields.Hatchuel, Armand, Le Masson, Pascal, and Weil, Benoit. (2008) Studying creative design: the contribution of C-K theory . Studying design creativity: Design Science, Computer Science, Cognitive Science and Neuroscience Approaches, Aix-en-Provence, France, 10-11 March 2008 C-K theory claims to have overcome these three limitations. It uses an approach which is domain-independent and which allows acting on unknown objects, and changes of the definitions of known objects during the process (revision of objects' identities).Hatchuel A. and Weil B., C-K design theory: An advanced formulation, Research in Engineering Design, 19(4):181-192, 2009 C-K theory was shown by Hatchuel and Weil to be closely related to Braha's Formal Design Theory and its clarification by Braha and Reich‚Äôs Coupled Design Theory,Braha D. and Reich Y. 2003. Topological Structures for Modeling Complex Engineering Design Processes. Research in Engineering Design 14(4): 185-199. which are both based on topological structures for design modeling. Structure of C-K theory  The core idea behind C-K theory is to define rigorously a design situation. A brief is an incomplete description of objects that do not exist yet and are still partly unknown. The first step in C-K theory is to define a brief as a concept, through the introduction of a formal distinction between concept and knowledge spaces; the second step is to characterize the operators that are needed between these two spaces. Knowledge The knowledge space is defined as a set of propositions with a logical status, according to the knowledge available to the designer or the group of designers. The knowledge space (i.e. K-Space) describes all objects and truths that are established from the point of view of the designer. Then K-Space is expandable as new truths may appear in it as an effect of the design process. Conversely, the structure and properties of the K-Space have a major influence on the process. Concept  A concept is defined as a proposition without a logical status in the K-Space. A central finding of C-K theory is that concepts are the necessary departure point of a design process. Without concepts, design reduces to standard optimization or problem-solving. Concepts assert the existence of an unknown object that presents some properties desired by the designer. Concepts can be partitioned or included, but not searched nor explored. C-K operators Building on these premises, C-K theory shows the design process as the result of four operators: C‚ÜíK, K‚ÜíC, C‚ÜíC, K‚ÜíK. *The initial concept is partitioned using propositions from K: K‚ÜíC *These partitions add new properties to the concepts and create new concepts: C‚ÜíC *Thanks to a conjunction C‚ÜíK this expansion of C may in return provoke the expansion of the K space: K‚ÜíK The process can be synthesized through a design square. One design solution for a first concept C0 will be a path in the C-space that forms a new proposition in K. There may exist several design paths for the same C0. The C-K Design Square Central findings The following graphical representation summarises the design process using C-K theory. 500px ;Crazy concepts Crazy concepts are concepts that seem absurd as an exploration path in a design process. Both C-K theory and practical applications have shown that crazy concepts can benefit the global design process by adding extra knowledge, not to be used to pursue that \\"crazy concept\\" design path, but to be used to further define a more \\"sensible concept\\" and lead to its eventual conjunction. The following image is a graphical representation of this process. center ;Design creativity The creative aspect of Design results from two distinct expansions: C-expansions which may be seen as \\"new ideas\\", and K-expansions which are necessary to validate these ideas or to expand them towards successful designs. ;Unification of design theories Domain dependent design theories are built on some specific structure of the K-space, either by assuming that some objects have invariant definitions and properties (like in all engineering fields), or by assuming that the K-space presents some stable structure (e.g. that the functions of an object can be defined independently from its technical realization, as in systematic design theory). ;Theory of design At The Design Society's 2009 International Conference on Engineering Design, an awarded- paperShai, O; Reich, Y; Hatchuel, A; and Subrahmanian, E.

They tended to model the dynamic co-evolution between design solutions and requirements. Within the field of engineering design, C-K theory opens new modelling directions that explore connections with basic issues in logic and mathematics; these are different from the classic use of scientific models in design. It has been argued that C-K theory has analogies with forcing in set theory, and with intuitionistic mathematics.Kazakci, Akin, and Hatchuel, Armand,Is \\"creative subject\\" of Brouwer a designer? - an Analysis of Intuitionistic Mathematics from the Viewpoint of C-K Design Theory? , International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED'09, Stanford CA, 24-27 August 2009. ;Industrial applications C-K theory has been applied in several industrial contexts since 1998, mainly in France, Sweden and Germany. It is generally used as a method that increases the innovative capacity of design and R&D; departments. C-K theory has also inspired new management principles for collaborative innovation, with the aim of overcoming the limitations of standard design management methods.Hatchuel, A. ; Le Masson, P. and Weil, B.

Early life Mesac Damas was born in Haiti on July 2, 1976. Damas had an unstable family life and was influenced in his youth by domestic violence and poverty. He was raised an Evangelical Christian by his mother and father until the age of 10 when his parents left for the United States, leaving him in Haiti with extended family members who practiced Haitian Voodoo. As an adult, Damas identifies as an Evangelical Christian. At the age of 19, Damas left Haiti and relocated to the United States, where he has lived ever since. At the time of the murders, Damas was 33 years old and worked as a chef at a local ale house. He described himself as \\"the best of the best\\" in his line of work. In January 2009, eight months prior to the murders, Damas was arrested for domestic violence battery against his wife, Guerline, whom he had been with for 12 years. The incident arose over Damas' suspicions of unfaithfulness on the part of his wife. Murders In a statement to US Marshal agents, Damas divulged that on Wednesday, September 16, 2009, his wife, Guerline Damas, brought up the topic of divorce while at home that evening. Damas stated that the conversation became frenzied, and that at one point he said to his wife, \\"Divorce me? I'll [expletive] kill you.\\" The following morning, Thursday, September 17, 2009, Damas followed his wife to work for her 5:00AM shift at Publix to make sure she was \\"really there\\". Another argument then ensued when she discovered that he had followed her. Damas stated that the conversation of the night before lingered in his mind all day, causing him to become increasingly angrier over the subject. Damas reported to work that evening but clocked out after working only two hours, saying that he couldn't work because he wasn't feeling well and had a \\"pounding headache\\". Damas would later tell agents that at the time, \\"bad spirits\\" and voices were telling him that his wife would leave him. After leaving work, Damas arrived at a local supermarket where he purchased a Berkley fillet knife, a roll of silver duct tape, and a pack of gum. When he arrived home, Damas stated that his wife did not speak to him except to ask him to sign immigration papers and tell him that she still intended on leaving. It was then that Damas grabbed a knife, tied her with a rope, and duct taped her mouth. Damas could not describe any of the events after that, except to say, \\"it's bad, it's criminal.\\" When agents asked whether anyone helped him commit the crimes, Damas said that he had help from a \\"visible spirit\\" but not an actual, physical person. Damas asserted that his actions were carried out as a result of a hex that was placed on him by his mother-in-law and/or a coworker of his. Damas remained in the house until 7:00AM the following morning, thinking about how he was going to kill himself. He then changed his clothes, packed a suitcase, and drove to Miami International Airport. On Saturday September 19, 2009, the family of Guerline Damas contacted the Collier County Sheriff's Office to file a missing person's report, as they had not heard from Guerline since Thursday, September 17, 2009 and she had not reported to work. At 7:03 PM that evening, deputies arrived at the Damas family's residence to conduct a welfare check on Guerline Damas and her five children. It was at this time that deputies entered the residence and noticed what appeared to be blood leaking from a closed door under the stairs, with floor rugs pushed against it to cover the space between the bottom of the door and the tile floor beneath it. The residence was then secured as a possible homicide scene. Deputies pried open the locked door to discover the body of Guerline Damas on the floor of a small bathroom, face down in a large pool of dried blood with a black trash bag over her head and her limbs bound with duct tape. Her autopsy revealed blunt force injury to her right elbow and right eye, and deep, extensive sharp force injury to her left shoulder and neck. Deputies then discovered the body of Meshach Damas in a second floor bedroom, face down on a mattress atop an area of dried blood. The autopsy of Meshach Damas revealed sharp force injuries to the palm of his right hand, as well as extensive sharp force injuries encircling almost the entirety of his neck. Upon entry into another second floor bedroom, deputies discovered the bodies of the remaining four Damas children, two on the bedroom floor beside one another, one on the bed, and one on a mattress on the floor of the bedroom. All four sustained sharp force injuries to their necks. Flight and Arrest On the morning of Friday, September 18, 2009, Mesac Damas went to the Miami International Airport and purchased a ticket for a one-way flight to Port Au Prince, Haiti, where he arrived at 10:50 AM the same day. Damas would later state to US Marshals that he had flown to Haiti to say goodbye to his family, because he \\"knew what he did was wrong and that he didn't deserve to live\\". On September 22, 2009 a warrant was signed by a Collier County judge for the arrest of Mesac Damas for the murder of his wife and five children. On September 23, 2009, Damas was apprehended by United States Marshal Service agents in Port Au Prince, Haiti. Damas voluntarily provided a lengthy statement to agents at that time, saying, among other things, \\"I know what I did was wrong. Bad spirits made me do it.\\" and asking agents, \\"You think I want to live after what I did?\\" In a statement to the Naples Daily News the same day, Damas admitted to the murders of his wife and five children, and stated that he wished to receive the death penalty for his crimes. Damas was transported back to Collier County by the US Marshal, where he was incarcerated and held no bond. Competency Throughout the pendency of the Damas case, his competency to stand trial was an ongoing question, mainly revolving around his hyper-religious ideation and refusal to cooperate with attorneys, with the court, and with jail staff. Questions of competency caused frequent and significant delays in the progress of the case. Between September 2010 and March 2011, three experts were appointed by the court to evaluate Damas' competency, resulting in a June 2011 court order finding him competent to proceed. Despite this, competency issues persisted as the case proceeded and as Damas' behavior became more bizarre. Damas was then re- evaluated and found incompetent to proceed on March 19, 2014 by a court order which cited, \\"a substantial likelihood that in the near future the defendant will inflict serious bodily harm on himself or another person, as evidenced by recent behavior.\\" Additionally, the order stated that Damas' condition had \\"substantial probability\\" of responding well to treatment with the goal of restoring his competency to proceed \\"in the reasonably foreseeable future.\\" It was at this time that he was committed to the custody of the Department of Children and Families and referred to a mental health treatment facility, where he was admitted in April 2014. In October 2014, his competency was found to have been restored by a court order, stating that facility records note Damas was \\"aggressive, manipulative, and deceitful, and would engage in cooperative behavior when necessary to get something he wanted,\\" as well as describing Damas as \\"grandiose, preoccupied with his own self-worth, entitled and wants to be admired by others, lacks empathy, and arrogant.\\" Reports further state that Damas \\"has the ability to engage in appropriate behavior, and his refusal to do so at times is a volitional choice, and not a symptom of mental illness\\". Having found that his competency had been restored, Damas was set back on track to proceed to trial. Jail and Courtroom Behavior While being held in custody, Damas rejected his legal name and took on a moniker of his own making, \\"C.O.G.\\" ‚Äî an acronym meaning \\"Child of God\\". Damas also refused to eat or shower for long periods of time. At least one reported instance involved Damas going without showering for over 30 consecutive days. Local news sources reported that the smell coming from Mesac Damas' cell was so bad at times that it made other inmates physically ill. Damas routinely refused deputies' orders and was the subject of numerous disciplinary action by jail staff, including at least one incident wherein Damas was sprayed with pepper spray after hiding under his bunk. Damas' courtroom behavior often became a spectacle and attracted much media attention. One August 2010 court appearance involved Damas singing aloud until his lawyer and the presiding judge told him to calm down. He ceased until the hearing was almost over, but then began again with the outbursts. Damas was routinely transported by multiple jail deputies to and from his court appearances, at times secured to a wheelchair-like contraption for the safety of staff. As the case proceeded, Damas' courtroom behavior became generally less disruptive but not necessarily any more cooperative. At nearly every court appearance attended by Damas in 2017, he could be seen sitting silently with his head resting on the table, possibly asleep. At a hearing on June 23, 2017, Damas unexpectedly rose to his feet and stated in open court that he wanted to discharge his attorneys, represent himself, and plead guilty to the charges against him. At a later hearing on July 21, 2017 to determine his ability to adequately represent himself and enter a guilty plea to six capital felonies, Damas again became uncooperative, making rambling and disjointed statements to the court. At one hearing in October 2017, Damas handwrote a note to the presiding judge which read, \\"Go ahead, continue your work, may my blood be upon your shoulders,\\" signing the note \\"C.O.G.\\" Disposition On September 5, 2017, Mesac Damas pled guilty to all six counts of first degree premeditated murder. Sentencing was deferred until October 27, 2017, when Collier Circuit Judge Christine H. Greider sentenced Mesac Damas to concurrent death sentences on all six counts.Naples Daily News Published 4:38 p.m. ET Oct. 27, 2017 Updated 3:43 a.m. ET Oct. 28, 2017. Retrieved November 26, 2017. In January 2019, the Supreme Court affirmed the original sentence, confirming six death sentences.

Countourites are produced by thermohaline-induced deepwater bottom currents and may be influenced by wind or tidal forces.Rebesco, M. & Camerlenghi, A. 2008. Contourites, Elsevier Science, 688pp. The geomorphology of contourite deposits is mainly influenced by the deepwater bottom-current velocity, sediment supply, and seafloor topography. Definition The definition of the term contourite has varied throughout the decades. Originally, Heezen et al. (1966) defined the concept, without using the actual word, as a sedimentary deposit on the continental rise derived from thermohaline-induced geostrophic bottom-currents that flow parallel to bathymetric contours. They did this to emphasize the difference between these deposits and turbidites in order to explain the ubiquitous smoothness and lack of irregularities of the continental rise in the Blake-Bahama Basin. Before this, it was thought that only turbidity flows were capable of depositing and reworking sediment at depths greater than the continental slope. Hollister and Heezen (1972) adopted the name contourite for these deposits and provided a list of characteristics that described their sediments. Faug√®res and Stow (1993) note that as research on the subject developed, the term contourite was used to describe various forms of sedimentary deposits from bottom-currents including those at much shallower depths and even in lacustrine settings. They suggested going back to the original definition of a contourite, that is for deposits at depths greater than 500 m derived from stable thermohaline-induced geostrophic bottom-currents (i.e. deepwater bottom-currents), in order to avoid using the same name when describing sedimentary deposits formed by different processes. They also suggest the umbrella term bottom-current deposit, which includes contourites and deposits generated by other bottom- currents. Flow conditions Bottom current flow in the Gulf of Cadiz Thermohaline circulation is the principal driving force of deepwater bottom- currents. The term refers to the movement of water over large distances as a consequence of global oceanic density gradients. This circulation commonly travels at velocities between 2 ‚Äì 20 cm/s. Note that at this velocity range, considering the general shape of the Shields diagram still holds in these conditions, a flow will only be able to continue transporting finer sediment that is already in suspension but will not be able to erode the same sized sediment once it is deposited. However, flow velocity may be intensified as a consequence of the Coriolis force driving currents west against continental margins or as current squeezes between two ridges. Periodically, velocities may increase dramatically or even reverse due to atmospheric storms raising the local surface eddy kinetic energy, which gets partially transmitted down to abyssal depths in episodes called benthic storms. These velocities may reach magnitudes well above 40 cm/s and vary significantly depending on the specific location. At the lower continental rise, south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and at the lower slope around the Faeroe Islands these velocities may reach up to 73 cm/s and 75 cm/s, respectively. Bottom-current flow velocities have been measured as high as 300 cm/s in the Strait of Gibraltar. These benthic storms occur only 5 to 10 times per year and usually last between 3 and 5 days, but that is enough to heavily erode benthic sediment and keep the finer grains in suspension even after flow velocities return to normal and the bedload has been deposited. During benthic storms, the eroded sediment may be transported over thousands of kilometers and deposited rather quickly (i.e. ~1.5 cm/month) once the storm wanes. However, the net sedimentation rate over thousands of years may be much smaller (i.e. ~5.5 cm/year) due to the intense periods of erosion during benthic storms. Sediment supply Bedform phase diagram for contourites (Stow et al. 2009) Erosion of the seafloor contributes to the growth of a deepwater nepheloid layer. This layer plays a key role in supplying the sediment for the deposition of contourites under appropriate flow conditions. Terrigenous sediment supply to the deepwater bottom-currents and to the nepheloid layer primarily depends on climate and tectonics in the continental environment. The rate of tectonic uplift is directly related to the amount of sediment available and variations in sea level will determine the ease with which this sediment is transported basinward. The sediment will most likely reach deepwater in the form of turbidity flows, which travel across bathymetric contours, only to be ‚Äúblown‚Äù parallel to these contours as the finer sediments cross a deepwater bottom-current. Other sources of terrigenous sediment may include airborne and seaborne volcanoclastic debris. Biogenic deposition from suspension may also supply sediment to these deepwater bottom-currents. The deposition of this material has strong implications for the biology, chemistry and flow conditions at the time. It must occur in areas of high biogenic productivity, during periods of relatively quiet flow and, if calcareous, must also occur at depths above the carbonate compensation depth. There is also a contribution to the concentration of suspended sediment by the burrowing activity of benthic organisms. Geomorphology The accumulation and geomorphology of contourite deposits are mainly influenced by three factors: intensity of deepwater bottom-currents, seafloor topography, and sediment supply. There are five main types of contourite accumulations: giant elongate drifts, contourite sheets, channel related drifts, confined drifts and modified drift-turbidite systems. Giant elongate drifts Sparker seismic line showing elongate drifts in the Gulf of Cadiz Giant elongate drifts form very large mounded elongated geometries parallel to the deepwater bottom-current flow. They are characterized by a near complete lack of parallel bedding. Mounded drifts are often bounded on one or both sides by non-depositional or erosional channels, sometimes known as moats. These drifts can be ‚Äútens to hundreds of kilometers long, tens of kilometers wide, and range from 0.1 to more than 1 km in relief above the surrounding seafloor‚Äù. Their length to width ratio ranges from 2:1 to 10:1. They can accumulate to thicknesses greater than 2 km and can form anywhere from the upper slope to the deepest parts of the basin depending on the specific location of the bottom-current. Sedimentation rates range from 20 ‚Äì 100 m/Ma. They tend to be finer-grained with a lot of mud, silt and biogenic material. Coarse-grained contourites are very rare. They may also form detached or separated versions due to seafloor topography and flow conditions. Detached drifts are isolated and migrate downslope while separated drifts typically are asymmetric in shape, tend to form at the base of a slope and migrate up-slope. Large sediment waves have been observed partially covering some giant elongate drifts. Contourite sheets reflection seismic data off the coast of Portugal Contourite sheets are broad, low-relief features that extend through very large areas (i.e. ~1,000,000 km2) and are seen covering the abyssal plains or even plastered against the continental margins. They are characteristic of very deep water. They have a relatively constant thickness of up to a few hundred meters with a slight thinning towards the continental margin. Sediment wave fields are a variety that is generally located near the rise to slope transition. Seismic reflection profiles show that the sediment waves tend to migrate up-slope. Channel-related drifts Channel-related drifts form when deepwater bottom-currents are confined to a smaller cross sectional area of flow and therefore their velocity increases substantially. This can happen if the deepwater bottom-current is trapped within a deep channel or within a gateway that connects two basins. Due to the high velocities, it is common to see scours and erosional features as well as different types of deposits at the floor of the channel, the flanks, and the down-current exit of the channel. Flank deposits are usually patchy and small (tens of km2), can be elongate and subparallel to flow direction and may have a sheeted or mounded geometry. At the down-current exit of the channel, flow velocity decreases dramatically and a cone-shaped contourite fan is formed which is much larger than the flank deposits, measuring about 100 km in radius and about 300 m in thickness. Channel floor deposits can be patchy and contain sand, gravel and mud clasts in the form of a channel lag. Confined drifts Confined drifts are contourite accumulations that occur within small basins. The basins in which they form tend to be tectonically active in order to allow for topographic confinement of the deposit. Modified drift- turbidite systems Modified drift-turbidite systems refer to the interactions of contourite and turbidite deposits. These can be observed as modifications of one another depending on the dominant process at the time. Examples range from asymmetric turbidite channel levees caused by strong deepwater bottom-currents as seen in the Nova Scotian Margin, to alternations in turbidite/debrite and contourite deposits both in time and space as seen in the Hebridean Margin. The Caledonia and Judith Fancy formations in St. Croix were studied by Stanley (1993) in which he found an ancient analog of an alternating turbidite and contourite deposit and generated a stratigraphic model of a continuum from a turbidite dominant environment to a contourite dominant one. Distinguishing turbidites, contourites, and bottom-current modified turbidite deposits is essential for reconstructing the paleoenvironment in deepwater settings. Traction structures, such as cross- stratification, indicate bottom-current reworking because it is more likely to have avalanching in clear bottom-currents than it is in sediment saturated turbidity flows. Deposition from suspension in turbidity flows do not generate a sharp upper contact as bottom-current reworked deposits show due to the highly oscillating energy conditions. Stanley (1993) proposes that the transition from a turbidite to a contourite involves a continuous transition from a sandy deposit to lenticular bedding passing through wavy bedding. Occurrence Present day Contourite deposition is active in many locations throughout the world, but particularly in areas affected by the thermohaline circulation. Ancient examples Identifying contourites in ancient sedimentary sequences is difficult as their distinctive morphology becomes obscured by the effects of later bioturbation, sedimentation, erosion and compaction. Most examples of contourites identified in the geological record come from the Cenozoic but examples have been noted from as far back as the Ediacaran.

Though today functioning only as a peaking plant, the Canal plant formerly generated the vast majority of the cape's power in its heyday. The plant's owner has proposed a project to modernize the plant and keep it relevant by constructing a 330 megawatt combined cycle natural gas plant on the site which would be a combined-cycle natural gas unit capable of starting up within 10 minutes as well as a 1.5 MW solar array on the property. The third unit would have the ability to run on liquid fuel during cold periods in the winter when the natural gas pipelines are constrained.

Information bias is also referred to as observational bias and misclassification. A Dictionary of Epidemiology, sponsored by the International Epidemiological Association, defines this as the following: > \\"1. A flaw in measuring exposure, covariate, or outcome variables that > results in different quality (accuracy) of information between comparison > groups. The occurrence of information biases may not be independent of the > occurrence of selection biases. 2\\\\. Bias in an estimate arising from > measurement errors.\\" Misclassification Misclassification thus refers to measurement error. There are two types of misclassification in epidemiological research: non differential misclassification and differential misclassification. Nondifferential misclassification Nondifferential misclassification is when all classes, groups, or categories of a variable (whether exposure, outcome, or covariate) have the same error rate or probability of being misclassified for all study subjects. It has traditionally been assumed that in the case of binary or dichotomous variables nondifferential misclassification would result in an 'underestimation' of the hypothesized relationship between exposure and outcome. However, this has more recently been challenged in that results of individual studies represent a single estimate and not the average of repeated measurements and thus can be farther (or nearer) from the null value (i.e. zero) than the true value. Differential misclassification Differential misclassification occurs when the error rate or probability of being misclassified differs across groups of study subjects. For example, the accuracy of blood pressure measurement may be lower for heavier than for lighter study subjects, or a study of elderly persons may find that reports from elderly persons with dementia are less reliable than those without dementia. The effect(s) of such misclassification can vary from an overestimation to an underestimation of the true value. Statisticians have developed methods to adjust for this type of bias, which may assist somewhat in compensating for this problem when known and when it is quantifiable.

She was Princess of Cond√© by her marriage. She has no known descendants today as her grandson, heir to the Cond√© family, died without children and her daughter remained childless. Charlotte was praised for being a cultured and attractive princess of her age. Early life Charlotte Godefridesometimes spelt Godefroyde √âlisabeth de Rohan was born on 7 October 1737 in Paris. Her father was Charles de Rohan, prince de Soubise, a great friend of King Louis XV of France. Her mother was Anne Marie Louise de La Tour d'Auvergne. Anne Marie Louise was a granddaughter of Marie Anne Mancini, one of the famous Mazarinettes. Through Marie Anne Mancini, Charlotte was a cousin of both Prince Eugene of Savoy and Louis Joseph de Bourbon, two famous generals during the reign of Louis XIV. Anne Marie Louise was also the great-granddaughter of Madame de Ventadour, the governess of King Louis XV as a small child. Charlotte was born at the H√¥tel de Soubise in Paris, the townhouse of the Rohan family in the fashionable Marais. She had a younger half sister, Victoire Armande Jos√®phe de Rohan. Victoire would later become the governess of the future King Louis XVI. Victoire was also a cousin of Queen Marie Antoinette's ill-fated friend, the princesse de Lamballe. As the House of Rohan claimed descent from the Dukes of Brittany, Charlotte and her family were accorded the rank of princes √©trangers at the French court with the corresponding style of Highness. In 1739, she was created Marchioness of Gordes and Countess of Moncha, both of which she received from her mother when she died. In 1745, she was made the Viscountess of Guignen in her own right. In her dowry, she was given the Lordship of Annonay, which she passed onto the Bourbons. Princess of Cond√© Charlotte de Rohan, by Jean-Marie Ribou Charlotte married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Cond√© in a ceremony at the Palace of Versailles on 3 May 1753. Charlotte's father reportedly gave a dowry of 20 million Livres. Louis Joseph was a year older than Charlotte. Louis Joseph had been the prince de Cond√© since 1740 when at the young age of four he had lost his father, Louis Henri, prince de Cond√©. His father, as the duc de Bourbon, had been at one time the chief minister of King Louis XV and had been instrumental in arranging the young king's marriage to the Polish princess Marie Leszczy≈Ñska. He was only forty-eight at the time of his death. Louis Joseph's mother, the German princess, Caroline of Hesse-Rotenburg, died the next year in 1741 at the age of twenty-two. As a result, Louis Joseph was an orphan and had been raised by his uncle the Count of Clermont. The new princesse de Cond√© was among the most important females at court, ranking behind Queen Marie Leszczy≈Ñska and her eight daughters, the Duchess of Orl√©ans, and Mademoiselle; Mademoiselle would later become her daughter-in- law. Louis Joseph possessed the rank of prince du sang at court with the corresponding style of Serene Highness, a style Charlotte assumed when she became the princesse de Cond√©. Three children were born to the marriage. First, a girl was born in 1755, soon to be followed by a desired son in 1756. Another daughter was born in 1758. Charlotte lived at the H√¥tel de Cond√© in Paris, the Cond√© family residence, since the Palais Bourbon built by Louis Joseph's grandmother, Louise-Fran√ßoise de Bourbon, had been sold to the crown in 17. A cultured princess, she was kind to the poor. Death It was at the H√¥tel de Cond√© that Charlotte died after a long illness as reported by the Duke of Luynes. She was just twenty-two years old, the same age her mother-in- law, Caroline, had been at her death. She was buried at the Carmelite Convent of the Faubourg Saint-Jacques. The official time for mourning for Charlotte began on 11 March. Her husband went on to marry again in 1798. He married as his second wife the Italian noblewoman, Maria-Caterina di Brignole-Sale, the widow of Honor√© III, Prince of Monaco.

Her music incorporates elements of rock, pop, R&B;, folk, country, and dance. She has released 3 studio albums, 3 EPs and has contributed to various film, television and multi-media soundtracks and exceeded sales of 50,000 units as an independent artist. Foster has garnered a number of awards for her songwriting skills and has written with a number Nashville, Tennessee Music Row hit songwriter's including Pam Tillis (\\"Mi Vida Loca\\", \\"Spilled Perfume\\"), Jeffrey Steele (\\"What Hurts The Most\\", \\"My Wish\\"), Natalie Hemby (\\"Only Prettier\\", \\"White Liar\\"), Liz Rose (\\"Teardrops on My Guitar\\"), Mike Reid (\\"I Can't Make You Love Me\\"), Kristen Hall of Sugarland (\\"Baby Girl\\", \\"Stay\\"), Greg Barnhill (\\"Walkaway Joe\\"), Keith Folles√© (\\"Smile\\", \\"Lookin' for a Good Time\\", \\"I Love You\\"), Rob Giles (The Rescues), and Emily West (\\"I Hate You, I Love You\\", \\"Blue Sky\\").  Early life  Jen Foster grew up in a suburban neighborhood in Houston, Texas. Her father is a successful Texas businessman and her mother was a housewife and an antiques dealer who died from endometrial cancer in 2008. Foster began playing the guitar at the age of eight, wrote her first song at sixteen, and won a number of talent contests at Duchesne Academy, the Catholic girls high school she attended. Foster says \\"I was a fan of thought-provoking lyrics.\\" Her early influences included James Taylor, Joni Mitchell, Jackson Brown, and Bob Dylan. After moving to Los Angeles to go to Whittier College she graduated in 1992 with a degree in English and a minor in Music. Foster's first performances were at coffee houses and clubs including the Whisky a Go Go and The Troubadour. After working a few odd jobs including a receptionist for the luggage company Ricardo of Beverly Hills, she decided that she wanted to move back South. Foster also wanted to live in a strong community of songwriters so she moved to Nashville, Tennessee.  Career  In 2003, Foster recorded her first official CD release, \\"Everybody's Girl.\\" With the help of an investor and a small team of industry professionals they put together the first incarnation of her independent record label called American Garage Records. Foster began touring the United States playing colleges, clubs and radio stations and implemented a street team, allowing her to mobilize her fan base. In 2006, \\"The Underdogs\\" her 2nd official release came out, and was even more well- received than the first project. On \\"The Underdogs\\", Foster worked with Jeff Trott, who is best known for his extensive work with Sheryl Crow, as her guitar player, co-writer, and co-producer. Several songs on that project won some respectable songwriting awards and opportunities for Film/TV placements were coming in as well. In 2008, the second incarnation of her label Fosterchild Records, was born and her first official release under Fosterchild was an EP featuring the single \\"Closer To Nowhere.\\" Foster made her first video for the song which quickly went to #1 on the LOGO channel and stayed on their Top 10 list for 6 months. \\"Closer To Nowhere\\" was also featured in MTV'S \\"The Hills.\\" The full CD project, \\"Thirty-Nine,\\" was released in 2009 and produced by world-class engineer Greg Droman. This project featured some of Foster's favorite musicians: Peter Stroud (Sheryl Crow's guitar player), Rami Jaffee (Keyboard player for the Foo Fighters and The Wallflowers), Sean Hurley (Bass for John Mayer, Vertical Horizon), and Fred Eltringham (The Wallflowers, Dixie Chicks, Wreckers). At the same time the CD was being recorded Foster's mother began her battle with cancer and over those next few years Foster was called to spend a lot of time with her mother and family. It was at this time that Foster wrote the song inspired by her mother \\"The Least I Can Do.\\" In 2009, Foster was invited by Bart Herbison to be the artist/writer representative on the very distinguished board at Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI). This board consists of some of the very best and most successful songwriters in music: Jessi Alexander (\\"The Climb\\", Miley Cyrus), Rivers Rutherford (\\"Homewrecker\\", Gretchen Wilson), Danny Wells (\\"Check Yes Or No\\", George Strait), Clay Mills (\\"Don't Think I Don't Think About It\\", Darius Rucker), Byron Hill (\\"Fool Hearted Memory\\", George Strait), Steve Bogard (\\"Damn Your Eyes\\", Etta James), and many others. Through her work with NSAI, Foster travelled to Washington DC to fight for the rights and fair compensation which songwriters are entitled to. Foster performed some her original compositions for Barbara Boxer, Jim Cooper, Lamar Alexander, and other members of Congress and the Senate, in an effort to remind them the value of a song. Foster released the single \\"I Didn't Just Kiss Her\\", a tongue-in-cheek response to Katy Perry's hit I Kissed a Girl. Despite the controversial subject Jen has said the reaction to her single has been \\"surprisingly, overwhelmingly positive\\" although a few people have emailed her expressing their offense. 2009 was also the year that Foster's song \\"Venice Beach\\" was chosen to be the theme song for the popular web series \\"VENICE\\" which is a spin-off from the CBS soap opera \\"The Guiding Light\\". Other original songs by Jen, including \\"She\\", \\"I'm in Love With You\\", and \\"I Can't Believe\\", were regularly featured in the series. Thousands of new fans have embraced Foster's music as a result of this placement. In 2011 the series won an Emmy for Best Daytime Short Format. Foster is constantly writing, co- writing, and recording new songs. Creating demo's of country songs in Nashville to pitch to major country artists, travels to LA regularly to write and record new songs for pop pitches as well as for film/TV pitches. Foster has had songs on hold in Nashville with Faith Hill, Wynonna Judd, Rascal Flatts, Rodney Atkins, and Lee Brice. In 2012 Foster released a new artist project, \\"You Stayed\\" which is a compilation of a lot of the recordings she did in Los Angeles with co-producer, Rich Jacques and dedicated to her fans for their dedication and continue supported. She co-wrote the title track with songwriter/producer and Nashville Star judge, Jeffrey Steele. 2012 also saw Foster assemble a new Fosterchild Records team, start speaking at conferences about how she has marketed her music and built my fan base independently. Foster was the keynote speaker, along with Ashley Capps of Bonaroo, at the Indiegirl Conference in Knoxville, TN, spoke to a crowd of 350 people for Tin Pan South at the Millennium Hotel in Nashville and at Belmont University's \\"Best Job Ever\\" event in September 2012. Foster has hosted three songwriter events since 2009 called \\"The Writer's Share\\", to benefit the TJ Martell Foundation for Leukemia, Cancer, and AIDS Research. This event has typically been held at the Bluebird Cafe, and has featured Richard Marx, Keb' Mo, and many other well-loved hit songwriters, such as Mike Reid (\\"I Can't Make You Love Me\\", Bonnie Raitt) and Chuck Cannon (\\"I Love The Way You Love Me\\", John Michael Montgomery).

Born in 1864 in Prince Edward Island, he moved to British Columbia in 1883 where he worked for several railway companies as an accountant. In 1915 he moved to Camrose, Alberta to become a farmer. The same year, he married Lily Bury, with whom he would have five children. Smith contested the 1921 provincial election in the riding of Camrose for the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA), where he received 56% of the vote and defeated incumbent Liberal George P. Smith. The UFA, which had never before run candidates in an election, won a surprise victory in 1921, and new premier Herbert Greenfield appointed Smith to his cabinet as Minister of Railways and Telephones.Foster 60 In this capacity, Smith was responsible for dealing with a number of money-losing railways, including the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway (ED&BC;), that had fallen into the government's hands as a result of the collapse of the syndicates that had built them. He favoured government ownership of these railways, while Greenfield supported selling them to the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). Smith did not like the CPR, and in 1923 publicly accused it of dereliction of duty in relation to a contract it held to recondition the ED&BC; Greenfield apologized to the CPR in the legislature on behalf of the government, opening a rift between him and his minister. One independent member of the legislative assembly speculated that \\"if the farmer members of the House took a vote between Greenfield and Smith\\" on the issue, \\"they would certainly take Smith.\\"Jones 68‚Äì69 Indeed, the issue was one of several leading the UFA to caucus to pressure Greenfield to resign in favour of his Attorney-General, John Edward Brownlee, which he did in 1925.Foster 115 Resolving the railways question was one of Brownlee's top priorities, and in early 1926 he and Smith travelled to Ottawa, where they met with federal Minister of Railways Charles Avery Dunning in an unsuccessful effort to persuade him that the federal government should take over the railways. Next they travelled to Montreal, where they reached an agreement with the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) to acquire its shares in the ED&BC;, originally valued at $2 million, for $1.3 million; this gave the government full ownership of the railway and the flexibility to sell, lease, or operate it without requiring the consent of the RBC. Still in Montreal, Brownlee and Smith made offers to sell the railway to both the CPR and the Canadian National Railway (CNR).Foster 120 Neither was interested, and on returning to Edmonton Smith repeated his recommendation for direct government operation of the railways. Brownlee proved more receptive to the idea than Greenfield had, and the government appointed John Callaghan‚Äîa business acquaintance of Smith's and a successful railway contractor‚Äîas Superintendent of Railways.Foster 135 Callaghan was successful in converting the railways to profit-making ventures, and in 1928 one of the smaller lines, the Lacombe and North Western, was sold to the CPR for $1.5 million.Foster 144 The following year, the CPR purchased all remaining lines for $25 million.Foster 152 Vernor Smith was re-elected in the 1926 and 1930 elections, and remained Minister of Railways and Telephones. On July 19, 1932, Smith dropped dead at his Edmonton home while preparing to meet his family at his summer cottage at Pigeon Lake. He had been suffering from angina pectoris for years and had succumbed to the condition. Vernor Smith's great grandson is musician Mac DeMarco, whose birth name‚ÄîVernor Winfield McBriare Smith IV‚Äîwas chosen in honour of the elder Smith.

History The Montreal World Health Organization Simulation was founded under the name McWHO (McGill World Health Organization Simulation) in 2007 by Martin Smoragiewicz, a McGill Medical Student, who was deeply concerned by the lack of recognition by his colleagues of the social determinants of health. Equally aware of the many professionals, both in and out of the healthcare field, who influence health outcomes, Martin wanted to develop an event that allowed his colleagues to challenge their assumptions, broaden their perspectives and develop inter-professional relationships. Martin developed the concept of a simulation of the World Health Organization with the idea in mind that it would offer participants the opportunity to step out into the world as a citizen of the global village while discussing health issues in a political, social and economic context. Participants would assume the role of a country's ambassador to the WHO and work with their peers to develop resolution papers that address global health problems. In 2009, McWHO's name was changed to MonWHO to reflect the population of students who participated in the conference and sat on the Secretariat. Today, MonWHO is proud to welcome delegates from North America and Europe, who are pursuing a variety of studies including Medicine, Engineering, Economics and Law. Since its inception, MonWHO has been hosted with the support of the McGill International Health Initiative (MIHI), the student branch of McGill's Global Health Program. MonWHO also served as the official meeting spot for the Global Health Advocates of the Canadian Federation of Medical Students (CFMS) for 2009 and 2010. As of 2011, MonWHO is an officially recognized transnational project of the International Federation of Medical Students Association (IFMSA). Organization Secretariat There are three levels to the MonWHO staff structure: the Secretariat (consisting of the Executive Director and the Under Secretaries General), which is led by the Executive Director; the Senior Staff (consisting of Chairs); and the Junior Staff (consisting of Vice-Chairs). The Secretary of MonWHO 2014 includes Shu Yang Hu (Executive Director), Chris Cadham (Chief of Staff), Gregory Marks (Theme Director), Kelly Chiu (Public Relations Director), David Benrimoh (Crisis Director), Emily Zhou (Logistics Director), Ayesha Bery (Delegate Resource Coordinator), Alvin Chauhan (VP Finance), Priyanka Bijlani (Charg√©e d'Affaires), Uzma Ahmed (NGO Fair Coordinator), Leah Zhao (VP Communications), Brian Mann (Media Director).  Awards  Like most Model UN conferences, MonWHO recognizes exceptional delegates with awards at the end of the conference. Awards are given to the delegates who demonstrate strong preparation, excellent speaking skills, adherence to national policy, and exceptional abilities of compromise and negotiation. *Best Delegate *Outstanding Delegate *Honorable Mention  Expansion Following the success of MonWHO, a number of other universities have introduced WHO simulations. Annual conferences in Toronto (OMWHO), Calgary (CalWHO), and Edmonton (edmontonWHO) have already been established and there are talks of creating similar simulations in both Ottawa and North Carolina.

It offered basic but necessary protection against mine attack through the use of a V-hull. Design Leopard displayed in the Imperial War Museum North, Manchester, UK View from rear, showing passenger entrance door, steps up, engine compartment and fuel tank at extreme rear.The Leopard was designed in 1974 by Ernest Konschel. It pre-dates and is similar in concept to the South African Buffel, but is smaller, and carried a driver on the front right, 2 passengers behind on the right, and three on the left. All passengers were on bench seats fixed to the hull facing in. It is powered by a Volkswagen Type 1 engine located in an un-armoured enclosure at the rear, behind the rear axle. The vehicle is notable for its highly unusual shape, all facets of which are intended to counter the effect of land mine blasts. * V-hull cab, * circular external roll over bars, * soft-top roof, preventing undue pressure build-up in the hull in the event of a land-mine blast. * detachable front and rear suspension and engine sub-assemblies, * all passenger seats are fitted with semi-adjustable over-shoulder and lap straps, * road wheels deliberately positioned well away from the passenger compartment or hull, so that if a mine was triggered by a road wheel the hull was not directly over the blast field. This vehicle is considered the first monocoque mine proof vehicle produced. The example shown, from the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester, UK, was built in 1978-9 according to the attached label, making this the Mk6 variant. Production history The Leopard was produced in Rhodesia from 1975 to 1979 by Willowvale Motor Industries Ltd., and possibly in South-West Africa (Namibia), from a design by and under the supervision of Ernest Konschel. He was a Rhodesian engineer and farmer who also designed the Pookie mine detecting vehicle. Some 700 - 750 Leopards are recorded as being produced with only 3 complete examples surviving. The Leopard was primarily intended for use as a vehicle to provide cost-effective protection to the civilian population, which was particularly susceptible to the devastating effects of land-mine warfare. Mine-proof vehicles were not readily available due to the severe economic sanctions imposed on Rhodesia at the time. Modified versions, particularly those with a double door on the rear, were produced for the Rhodesian Security Forces, though this vehicle never found particular favour with these armed formations. The surviving vehicles on display are fundamentally designed and were sold for civilian use. This vehicle predates the South African 'Buffel' by several years. Many Rhodesian-designed vehicles were shipped to South Africa for trial and 'reverse engineering', giving rise to the first generation of South African monocoque mine proof vehicles. The Leopard suffered from a number of practical problems, which included overheating of the VW 1600cc, Dual port, Type 2, Air-cooled engine; a lack of power to traverse difficult terrain and escape ambush situations; and the unintended parting of the front or rear sub-assemblies from the hull while traversing difficult terrain. The Rhodesian Police, BSAP, particularly did not favour the vehicle and preferred various other mine resisting vehicles such as the Cougar (also designed by Konschel) and locally produced armored Land Rovers. The pictures of the IWM Leopard show a lack of two essential pieces of protection equipment: a sturdy wire mesh curved to fit to the top of the roll bars which acted as an anti-grenade screen preventing these entering the hull and the canvas roof which stretched over the screen to further help as an anti-grenade measure and keep out rain. This vehicle has been repainted at some time in an incorrect colour. Operators Primarily civilian, but utilized by many civilian and paramilitary branches of the Rhodesian government. The vehicle did not find favour with the Rhodesian Army. Surviving examples were later passed on to the Zimbabwean security forces at independence.

National Academy Press, Washington DC Bioresources Biological resources include agriculture, forestry, and biologically-derived waste, and there are many other renewable bioresource examples. One of the scientific terms used to denote renewable bioresources is lignocellulose. Lignocellulosic tissues are biologically- derived natural resources containing some of the main constituents of the natural world. 1) Holocellulose is the carbohydrate fraction of lignocellulose that includes cellulose, a common building block made of sugar (glucose) that is the most abundant biopolymer, as well as hemicellulose. 2) Lignin is the second most abundant biopolymer. Cellulose and lignin are two of the primary natural polymers used by plants to store energy as well as to give strength, as is the case in woody plant tissues. Other energy storage chemicals in plants include oils, waxes, fats, etc., and because these other plant compounds have distinct properties, they offer potential for a host of different bioproducts Bowyer, J.L., Ramaswamy, S., 2005: ‚ÄúRedefining undergraduate education for the 21st Century: Minnesota moves aggressively to strengthen program‚Äù Forest Products Journal, July-Aug 2005, 55 (7-8): 4-10)Ramaswamy, S., Tschirner, U., Chen, Y., 2007: ‚ÄúTransforming Academic Curricula: Pulp and Paper to Biobased Products - Providing Education and Research Training for the Conventional and Emerging Biobased Products Industry and the Bioeconomy‚Äù ACS Symposium Series Chapter 4, Section 1, Materials, Chemicals and Energy from Forest Biomass Ed. by Argyropoulos. Conventional bioproducts and emerging bioproducts are two broad categories used to categorize bioproducts. Examples of conventional bio-based products include building materials, pulp and paper, and forest products. Examples of emerging bioproducts or biobased products include biofuels, bioenergy, starch-based and cellulose-based ethanol, bio-based adhesives, biochemicals, bioplastics, etc.Bowyer, J.L., Ramaswamy, S., 2005: ‚ÄúRedefining undergraduate education for the 21st Century: Minnesota moves aggressively to strengthen program‚Äù Forest Products Journal, July-Aug 2005, 55 (7-8): 4-10)Ramaswamy, S., Tschirner, U., Chen, Y., 2007: ‚ÄúTransforming Academic Curricula: Pulp and Paper to Biobased Products - Providing Education and Research Training for the Conventional and Emerging Biobased Products Industry and the Bioeconomy‚Äù ACS Symposium Series Chapter 4, Section 1, Materials, Chemicals and Energy from Forest Biomass Ed. by Argyropoulos. Emerging bioproducts are active subjects of research and development, and these efforts have developed significantly since the turn of the 20/21st century, in part driven by the price of traditional petroleum- based products, by the environmental impact of petroleum use, and by an interest in many countries to become independent from foreign sources of oil. Bioproducts derived from bioresources can replace much of the fuels, chemicals, plastics etc. that are currently derived from petroleum Bioproducts engineering Bioproducts engineering (also referred to as bioprocess engineering) refers to engineering of bio-products from renewable bioresources. This pertains to the design, development and implementation of processes, technologies for the sustainable manufacture of materials, chemicals and energy from renewable biological resources. Also referred to as Bioprocess Engineering: Bioprocess Engineering is a specialization of Biotechnology, Chemical Engineering or Biological Engineering or of Agricultural Engineering. It deals with the design and development of equipment and processes for the manufacturing of products such as food, feed, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, chemicals, and polymers and paper from biological materials. Bioprocees engineering is a conglomerate of mathematics, biology and industrial design, and consists of various spectrums like designing of Fermentors, study of fermentors (mode of operations etc.). It also deals with studying various biotechnological processes used in industries for large scale production of biological product for optimization of yield in the end product and the quality of end product. Bio process engineering may include the work of mechanical, electrical and industrial engineers to apply principles of their disciplines to processes based on using living cells or sub component of such cells Bioprocess engineering- Basic concepts; Shular, Michael A., kargi, Fikret, Prentice Hall of India,2005 Also referred to as Bioresource Engineering: Bioresource engineering is related to the applications of biological engineering, chemical engineering and agricultural engineering usually based on biological and/or agricultural feedstocks. Bioresource engineering is more general and encompasses a wider range of technologies and various elements such as biomass, biological waste treatment, bioenergy, biotransformations and bioresource systems analysis, and technologies associated with Thermochemical conversion technologies: combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, catalysis, etc. Biochemical conversion technologies: aerobic methods, anaerobic digestion, microbial growth processes, enzymatic methods, composting Products: fibre, fuels, feedstocks, fertilisers, building materials, polymers and other industrial products Management: modelling, systems analysis, decisions, support systems. The impact of urbanization and increasing demand for land, food, and water presents engineers in a world with serious challenges. Little attention has been given to the interface between the biological world and traditional engineering in the past. It is the job of bioresource engineers to fill that gap. Agricultural and bioresource engineers develop efficient and environmentally-sensitive methods of producing food, fiber, timber, bio-based products and renewable energy sources for an ever-increasing world population.

As a former inhabitant of the city of Pripyat and an eyewitness (and victim) of the Chernobyl disaster, she has devoted a great part of her creative output to the 1986 catastrophe. She writes in both Ukrainian and Russian, and also translates from Ukrainian into Russian and vice versa. Her poems have been translated into many languages, including English. Life Sirota was born in Irtyshsk, Pavlodar Province, Kazakhstan (then a part of the USSR) to a large family which had been deported from Ukraine. When she was one, her family moved to the Kyrgyzstan capital, Frunze (now Bishkek). Her mother wanted to move to the city so that her children could have more opportunities for education and development. Sirota spent her childhood in Frunze, where she was a member of the city literary studio (\\"The Dawn of Mountains\\"). There she developed a dissident spirit: fostering freedom and love of truth. Her first literary works were printed in Kyrgyzstan magazines. In 1975 Sirota moved with her parents to their ancestral homeland, Ukraine. There, she received a degree in Russian language and literature from the philology department at Dnipropetrovsk National University. In 1983 she moved with her son Alexander to the new city of Pripyat (near the Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station, 1.5 km away), where she headed the literary group \\"Prometheus\\" and a literary studio for children. She also managed department of the Palace of Culture \\"Energetik\\" (literally, the \\"energy plant worker\\"). At the Palace of Culture, Sirota wrote and directed two plays: the musical \\"We Couldn't Not Find Each Other\\" and \\"My Specialty ‚Äî a life\\", a biography of the Russian poet Marina Tsvetaeva. The latter play was more successful, and was scheduled to be repeated when the Chernobyl nuclear station exploded on April 26, 1986. Sirota and her son were among the tens of thousands evacuated from the area following the event. Their lives were forever changed due to the evacuation, the loss of friends and acquaintances, and the assault on their health due to radiation exposure. Despite her suffering, however, the experience enhanced Sirota's poetic talent. To express her grief and rage she wrote poetry and collected them in a book, \\"Burden\\". Burden was published in 1990 in Kyiv (capital of Ukraine), where Sirota (as of 2011) lives with her family. In Kyiv, Sirota worked as a film editor in the film studio named after Alexander Dovzhenko. After her evacuation from Pripyat she reorganized \\"Prometheus\\", using poetry and music to proclaim the truth about the Chernobyl area and its people. However, repeated hospitalization for fatigue and pain (typical results of radiation exposure) increasingly interfered with her work. Since 1992 Sirota has been an invalid; however, at home she continues her efforts to prevent another Chernobyl. Her poems have been translated from Russian into other languages, and are known in many countries from the translation of Burden into English by Elisavietta Ritchie, Leonid Levin and Birgitta Ingemanson, with the assistance of Professor Paul Brians in the United States. Sirota's poetry has been published in magazines and anthologies in the United States, Canada and the UK.The First International Center of Woman‚Äôs Memories, Biographies and Testimonies ‚Äì see Lyubov Sirota (+ info) in the section \\"Members of the board\\". The hard life experience after Chernobyl has led Lyubov Sirota to the understanding what terrible danger the atomic engineering and all dangerous technologies carry, the pain-alarm was already not only for destiny of own family, own city, own country (Ukraine), but also for destiny of all world, for all, who live on the Earth. This universal pain dictated more from the lines of her poems after Chernobyl. She is convinced, that to describe all this there will be not enough of one life, therefore the theme of Chernobyl, as well as a theme of a survival and spiritual regeneration of mankind ‚Äì continue to remain the main themes of her poetry, journalism and prose now... Especially fully and sharply these themes are expressed in her essay about the destinies of Chernobyl women \\"Excessive burden\\" and in her prose book ‚Äì film-story \\"Pripyat syndrome\\", which has been recently issued at support of the site Pripyat.com and the International public organization \\"Center PRIPYAT.com\\", as a Russian/English edition of the poems illustrated with photos of Prypiat ‚Äì \\"To an Angel of Pripyat\\", published 2010. Also this life experience after Chernobyl has led to the understanding of necessity to search for a way for survival of mankind and rescue of our planet. So \\"The Appeal to the citizens of the Earth from the victims of Chernobyl\\" has arisen, from which the International Annual Action \\"The Saved Planet\\" has begun. One of Lyubov Sirota's articles \\"The modelling of the future ‚Äî is a reality\\" is devoted to this theme. Work Poetry Sirota's poetry became more widely known after Rollan Sergienko's 1988 film about the Chernobyl catastrophe, (which she co-authored) and her 1990 anthology Burden, published in Kyiv. Center of ghost town Pripyat (including Chernobyl power plant), 2007. Photo by Alexander Sirota Burden opens with a triptych of poems devoted to the evacuated city of Pripyat. The dead city only comes to life at night, in the dreams of people who have fled from it: \\"At night, of course, our town though emptied forever, comes to life. There, our dreams wander like clouds, illuminate windows with moonlight.\\" (Translated from the Russian by Leonid Levin and Elisavietta Ritchie) In the second verse, we see stars falling on a city roadway: \\"‚Ä¶And stars are thrust down onto the pavement, to stand guard until morning.\\" (Translated from the Russian by Leonid Levin and Elisavietta Ritchie) The city dies at each dawn: \\"‚Ä¶We are doomed to be left behind by the flock in the harshest of winters‚Ä¶ But when you fly off don't forget us, grounded in the field! And no matter to what joyful faraway lands your happy wings bear you, may our charred wings protect you from carelessness.\\" (Translated from the Russian by Leonid Levin and Elisavietta Ritchie) Sirota's poetry is, at times, full of indignation: \\"‚Ä¶But nothing will silence us! Even after death, from our graves we will appeal to your Conscience not to transform the Earth into a sarcophagus! ‚Ä¶ (Translated from the Russian by Leonid Levin and Elisavietta Ritchie) The third poem of the triptych is devoted to reflection on moral responsibility and civil duties: \\"...Life went up in smoke from somebody's campfire (this world has inquisitors to spare!). Everything burned, burned up. Even the ashes were not always left behind... ...But with merciful hands you extinguish the fatal fire under me. May the flame of the redeemed soul shield you!\\" (Translated from the Russian by Leonid Levin and Elisavietta Ritchie) Sirota is especially angry in her poem, Radiophobia (radiophobia is the fear of ionizing radiation), which is directed against the lies and double standards of the criminal authorities of the former USSR).(text the poem \\"Radiophobia\\" ...\\" ‚Äì written in the article \\"Reflection of ecological thinking in Russian art texts of the 20th century\\" by the professor of the Bergamo University Ugo Persi (the magazine \\"Russian abroad\\", 3/2001) Radiophobia (featured in Threshold and on radio) inspired Julio Soto (writer-director of the Spanish-American film Radiophobia) and artist Michael Genovese (painter of window frescoes containing the poem in the Ukrainian Village, Chicago, in 2006). \\"RADIOPHOBIA\\". A Chernobyl Poem by Lyubov Sirota, in Russian. Enamel on glass, Chicago, IL., 2006 \\"For those who were at the epicenter of the Chernobyl cataclysm this word is a grievous insult. It treats the normal impulse to self-protection, natural to everything living, your moral suffering, your anguish and your concern about the fate of your children, relatives and friends, and your own physical suffering and sickness as a result of delirium, of pathological perversion. This term deprives those who became Chernobyl's victims of hope for a better future because it dismisses as unfounded all their claims concerning physical health, adequate medical care, food, decent living conditions, and just material compensation. It causes an irreparable moral harm, inflicting a sense of abandonment and social deprivation that is inevitable in people who have gone through such a catastrophe.\\" Before the Chernobyl catastrophe Lyubov Sirota wrote more the lyrical poems, which were published in some periodicals of Kyrgyzstan and in newspapers of Ukraine: \\"Dnepr Miner\\", \\"Tribune of Power Specialist\\", \\"Flag of the Victory\\", etc.; in the literary almanac \\"Literary Ukraine\\"; in the collective poetic collections of Ukraine ‚Äî \\"The Steps\\" and of Russia ‚Äì \\"The Sources\\", etc. After Chernobyl her products were published in such newspapers, almanacs, of Ukraine: ‚ÄúThe Truth Ukraine‚Äù, ‚ÄúLiterary Ukraine‚Äù, \\"National newspaper\\", \\"Independent Ukraine\\", \\"Our Ukraine\\", \\"Your Health \\", \\"Ukrainian Forum \\", \\"Education\\", \\"Chernobyl Newspaper\\", \\"Post Chernobyl \\" and in many other; in the magazines ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù, ‚ÄúDnipro‚Äù, \\"Extreme Situation\\", \\"Scientific World\\", etc., in Latvian magazine \\" Cinema \\" No.4/1989; and in the poetic collections: \\"Chernobyl. Days of tests\\" (Kyiv, 1988), \\"Passing in a zone\\" ‚Äî the poetic anthology (Kyiv, 1996), \\"Chernobyl beside...\\" (Kyiv, 2000), etc. Now her poems are known all over the world, thanks to the translations into English, German, Japanese, Italian, Polish (in Polish her lyrical poems have been published in the collective collection \\"Ukrainian Love Poetry\\", Warszawa, 1991). But nevertheless her poetry became more known, thanking the long-term diligence of the professor of Washington University Paul Brians and his web page about Lyubov Sirota \\"The Chernobyl Poems of Lyubov Sirota\\". So her poems have sounded in the National radio of America (program Terra Infirma), have been issued in English in such anthologies, almanacs, magazines and poetic collections of the US and Canada: \\"Life on the Line: Selections on Words and Healing\\"; \\"Perspectives from the Past\\"; \\"A Fierce Brightness: Twenty-Five Years of Women's Poetry\\", and also in the Canadian and American magazines: \\"Calyx\\", \\"Woman World\\", \\"Promin'\\", \\"Journal of the American Medical Association\\"; \\"New York Quarterly\\", \\"WISE\\", \\"The Russell Record Magazine\\", \\"The Modern Review\\", \\"In Our Own Words\\", etc. Her own translations of the poetry of known Ukrainian poet Vasyl Stus in Russian have been issued in the book \\"Vasyl Stus. \\"And you same burn down\\" (Kyiv, 2005).

Background and objectives In recent years large parts of Europe suffered from extreme drought, a phenomenon that may become more frequent and more severe as a consequence of climate change. If not addressed properly, the socio-economic and environmental impacts of droughts will be huge. To inform European Drought and Climate Adaptation policies, the Xerochore assesses the existing knowledge about the physical causes, intensity, spatial and temporal patterns of droughts, and their social, environmental and economic impacts. Furthermore, it develops a catalogue of demand-and supply-side policies to manage droughts. To this end a series of expert workshops, roundtable discussions and stakeholders consultation will be organised. A Core Group will synthesise the collected knowledge and produce Guidance Documents for drought management. The Xerochore SA objectives are: * To synthesize knowledge on past, current and future drought events; * To compile a roadmap that provides a short to long term vision on research needs and steps forward towards supporting the implementation of drought management plans; * To provide information on possible impacts of droughts and guidance for stakeholders in the area of planning, implementation and scenarios; * To further extend and develop the drought network established as part of the European Drought Centre (EDC) to assess the international (inside and outside of Europe) state of the art in research related to droughts; * To link up with non-EU experts (through network partners and members of the External Advisory Board) to ensure that the synthesis, roadmap and guidance to stakeholders includes background from other leading continents (e.g. USA, Canada, Australia) and to encourage them to become member of the extended EDC; * To initiate a long lasting platform beyond this project through the network that communicates drought related research and policy making within the research community, water managers, policy makers and the wider public. Organization of work The Xerochore SA is based on the involvement of 11 Partners (Core Partners) and a wider group of already identified partners as Network Partners (contributing to the review and synthesis). Also being open to more experts on a voluntary basis, the area addressed benefits from broadening the information collection as much as possible, by keeping the effort for coordinating the synthesis development in reasonable limits. The Xerochore SA is related to five main areas corresponding to 5 work packages (WP1-5), addressing sectoral key topics for the final synthesis. A sixth work package deals with the management of the SA (WP6). The five main areas (work packages) to be covered are: # WP1: Natural system (climate and hydrology), including physical causes, spatial and temporal development of historic droughts, anthropogenic influences, incl also impact of climate change on drought, development of basic elements for early warning systems, forecasting of drought; # WP2: Economic and social impacts of droughts and of research actions taken to mitigate and to adapt to the effects of droughts, incl. providing guidance for stakeholders; # WP3: Environmental impacts of droughts and of research actions taken to mitigate and to adapt to the effects of droughts, incl. providing guidance for stakeholders; # WP4: An appraisal of existing drought-associated policies and the research needs to develop an EU drought policy (Pan-European scale); # WP5: Implications of drought policies for integrated water management at the regional and national level. The outcome of the WP's 1-3 provide then a possibility to integrate drought management both to its drivers (causes) and impacts as well as to possible consequences of drought management (WP5). The link of the drought management to WP4 (Drought policy) is dual, first to impose urgent fields of action in policy making, but considering at the same time constraints and restrictions as discussed under WP5. Partners The XEROCHORE Support Action are implemented by a Consortium of 11 Core Partners. The Consortium composition ensures interdisciplinary and multiplicity of skills in order to allow the achievement of the multifaceted project objectives and ensure a successful implementation of the outreach strategy by reaching all the different target groups addressed by the project activities. The project network consists of over 80 organizations including research institutes, universities, ministries, water management organizations, stakeholders, consultants, international organizations and programmes. The XEROCHORE Consortium, experienced in the different fields that lead toward a European Drought Policy, is well balanced as four main different partner types are represented: International Recognised Research Centres (FEEM, WMC, NERC, CEMACREF, JRC): The involved International Research Centres contribute to long-term interactions with national and international meteorological services and will support the XEROCHORE roadmap on applied projects and consulting. These research centres enable sufficient consideration of practical needs and requirements for private sector markets, within the roadmap towards EU drought policy. Academic Institutions (WU, UiO, NTUA): The involvement of these type of institutions together with similar Network Partners will ensure that the very first outcome of ongoing international academic research on different drought issues that is carried out by PhD students and postdocs (e.g. Aquastress, WATCH) will be integrated in the round table discussions that eventually will lead to the XEROCHORE roadmap for future research. National Authorities (MATTM, MMA): The involved National Authorities contribute to the XEROCHORE project by interactions with national and international hydrometeorological services and will support the roadmap in consideration of institutional links and requirements from national authorities and governmental organisations. International Organisation (JRC, IUCN): The involvement of International Organisations contributes to the embedding of international NGO's and support to policy making at EU and international level in consideration of environmental aspects and sustainable development.

Crewed Mars ascent vehicle from a DRA5 version Mars orbit rendezvous (MOR) is a space travel concept where two spacecraft meet up and/or dock in Mars orbit. For example, one vehicle takes off from Mars, such as a Martian ascent stage, and does a rendezvous in Mars orbit with another spacecraft. Applied to a Mars sample return or human mission to Mars, it allows much less weight to be sent to the surface and back into orbit, because the fuel needed to travel back to Earth is not landed on the planet. Page 8-9 in Chapter 2 of David S. F. Portree's Humans to Mars: Fifty Years of Mission Planning, 1950 - 2000, NASA Monographs in Aerospace History Series, Number 21, February 2001. Available as NASA SP-2001-4521. It has also been proposed for uncrewed Mars sample return plans. Mars Sample Return: The Medium-Lift Approach, Morris Jones, Sydney - July 1, 2000. Mars Orbit Rendezvous Strategy for the Mars 2003/2005 Sample Return Mission, DAmario, Louis A.; Bollman, Willard E.; Lee, Wayne J.; Roncoli, Ralph B.; Smith, John C., Technical Report, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, 1999-02, accessed 2010-09-16. In one mission proposal, MOR was planned for a Mars Descent-Ascent Vehicle (DAV) and Mars Transit Habitat, where a crew would transfer to the DAV after traveling to Mars on the habitat.Hoppy Price - Austere Human Missions to Mars (2009) - JPL This allowed the Mars DAV to be launched separately from the transit habitat, and without any crew. MOR is analogous to Lunar orbit rendezvous (LOR) used on the United States NASA Apollo program missions to Earth's moon during 1969 to 1972, as opposed to Earth orbit rendezvous (EOR) or Direct ascent. A related concept is a Mars flyby rendezvous, where spacecraft do not enter orbit but rendezvous near the planet. Mars flyby rendezvous was evaluated at NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center in the 1960s. At that time NASA developed designs for a combination of a Mars lander, short-stay surface habitat, and ascent vehicle called a Mars Excursion Module (MEM); the ascent stage performed the rendezvous. Compared to MOR, a flyby rendezvous means one spacecraft does not have to orbit Mars. Mars orbit rendezvous was utilized in Austere Human Missions to Mars, a tweak of DRA 5.0.

Arnold's three-year-old daughter, who was mascot on the first train to pull into the new station. A local post office was opened in 1892, and by 1896 the community had three churches, a district school, and 125 residents. In 1903 the school had two teachers and eighty students. In the 1920s the population of Ben Arnold rose to 250; it remained fairly stable until the late 1960s, when it fell to 148. The Ben Arnold school system was consolidated with the Cameron Independent School District by the early 1970s.

Lightstone has invested directly in individual real estate assets and in real estate operating companies. The company was founded by David Lichtenstein in 1988. The company's portfolio of real estate properties spans 20 U.S. states, and includes more than 11,000 multifamily units and approximately 9 million square feet of commercial space in the office, industrial, hotel, and retail sectors. The company has more than 450 employees, and is headquartered in New York City with regional offices in New Jersey, Maryland, and Illinois. Beacon Management is a Lightstone subsidiary, which manages the company's residential apartment business. Baltimore, Maryland-based Paragon Outlets is an affiliate of Lightstone, and manages the company's retail portfolio. Lightstone REITs In 2006, the company offered a $300 million real estate investment trust, which allowed Lightstone to raise money from outside investors for the first time. The non-traded Lightstone Value Plus REIT invested in office, retail, and other commercial properties, and by the end of 2009, was fully invested in a total of 30 properties. By the end of 2011, Lightstone Value Plus I was the 18th largest non-traded U.S. REIT. In the summer of 2010, the company offered second, non-traded REIT, Lightstone Value Plus II, committing capital to the hospitality, retail, multi-family, and commercial segments.

Extended Stay Hotels The Lightstone Group acquired Extended Stay Hotels (now trading as Extended Stay America) in June 2007 from The Blackstone Group for US$8 billion. The deal, financed with US$7 billion of debt, was one of several multibillion-dollar hotel and casino sales made that year. On June 15, 2009, Extended Stay America filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. After the Great Recession decimated leisure and business travel, Extended Stay faced shortages in liquidity stemming from the leveraged buyout by Lightstone two years before. Through debtor-in-possession financing, it was able to continue operating rather than to face liquidation. In July 2010, an investment consortium made up of Blackstone, Paulson & Co., and Centerbridge Partners bought Extended Stay America through a bankruptcy auction for US$3.93 billion. After its successful reorganization, Extended Stay America emerged from bankruptcy in October 2010\\\\. A year after the bankruptcy, Blackstone was sued by creditors of Extended Stay America alleging that Blackstone \\"skimmed\\" US$2.1 billion off of the sale to Lightstone and knew that the amount of debt would have been unsustainable for the hotel chain; Blackstone settled the lawsuit in June 2013 for US$10 million.  Affordable hotel investment  In 2019, The Lightstone Group, a real estate investment management business, is gambling on inexpensive New York City hotel developments. The company has launched a Moxy Hotels catering chain to the business sliver and will operate two more shortly, the Moxy Lower East Side and Moxy Williamsburg.

Dott Cornwall was created by Design Council as an innovation programme from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. The Dott programme produced two publications 'Common Sense' by Design Week and 'Wouldn't It Be Great' published by Design Council in 2007. The first Dott was held in the North East of England during 2007, led by Programme Director John Thackara. The second, and final programme was in Cornwall during 2009/10 was led by Andrea Siodmok. The key attributes of both programmes was a series of twenty citizen projects, a skills programme and policy recommendations.  Dott Cornwall  The Design Council, Cornwall Council, University College Falmouth and the Technology Strategy Board were partners behind Dott (Designs of the time) in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly during 2009/10. Dott worked with citizens to help them to co-design solutions to every day issues that they face. The programme director, Dr Andrea Siodmok, was previously chief design officer at the Design Council in London, and the executive director of both was Robert O'Dowd.  Project overview  Eco Design Challenge The challenge explored what design could do to reduce our ecological footprint. Dott worked with schools across Cornwall in the challenge, the winner of the Challenge was St Ives School. This challenge asked Year 8 pupils in Cornwall: ‚ÄòWhat is the size of your school's ecological footprint and how could design make it smaller?‚Äô Students across the county calculated the carbon footprint of their schools and came up with design solutions to reduce it. As well as studying different aspects of school life, participants also looked at the impact of journeys to and from school, school meals, water use and waste disposal. Led by Matt Hocking of Leap Media, the project aimed to encourage creative thinking, raise environmental awareness and throw innovative ideas into the way we approach a more sustainable future. The eco design challenge was supported by the Real Ideas Organization and The Learning Partnership. RSA Design Directions Dott collaborated with the Royal Society of Arts on a National design competition for design students in universities across the UK and Europe. The brief was entitled ‚ÄòDesign for Social Inclusion'. The challenge put to the students, was to design a product or service for a group of people of their choice, who are currently excluded from mainstream design practice. From Cornwall with Love From Cornwall with Love looked for radical and inventive ways to promote the values of Cornwall through its produce and products. The project worked with local producers and existing initiatives, such as Made in Cornwall, Hidden Art Cornwall and Taste of the Southwest, to use design to help push quality Cornish produce into the local and global spotlight. From Cornwall with Love focused on both products by local designers and makers as well as food produce, seeking to increase their availability and visibility. By establishing a link between the future brand and aspirations of the county, From Cornwall with Love aimed to stimulate growth in the dynamic businesses that will underpin Cornwall's future economy. Mark Irlam and Tom Tobia, founders of Something From Us, were the senior producers on this project. New Work Targeting groups at real or perceived risk of redundancy, New Work sought to improve signposting to new employment opportunities relevant to the economy and society of 21st century Cornwall. The project focused on boosting future employment opportunities by improving awareness of, and signposting to, new jobs. Sponsored by the Learning Skills Council, the team worked with workless people, removing barriers (real or perceived) that prevented them from accessing skills and future employment opportunities in Cornwall. The project worked with people across Cornwall to demonstrate how they can achieve personal success and nurture individual talents in positive ways that are relevant to the economy and society of modern-day Cornwall. Robert Woolf & Kathryn Woolf from Sea Communications, a creative digital marketing agency, were the senior producers. Cornwall Works 50+ Dott also worked with people and businesses to co-create ways to help older people find new work and stay in their jobs for longer. Cornwall's workforce is getting older and by 2017 about 34.4% of the workforce is predicted to be over 50. As the demographic of the workplace changes, its provisions for older workers will need to adapt. Working hand-in-hand with businesses and communities, Cornwall Works 50+ looked at all sorts of ways to improve and extend employment opportunities for older people. Its key concerns included how to encourage employers to take on older workers and how to overcome barriers faced by older people wanting to return to the workforce. Deborah Szebeko and Ian Drysdale from ThinkPublic were the senior producers. Serious Play Through Serious Play, Designers co-design a playground that could potentially supply power to the National Grid and inspire new a whole new generation of play. The Serious Play project set out to inspire the next generation by putting this energy to positive use in these energy-hungry times. At its outset, the project sought to discover whether we can harness the energy of children at play, and feed it into the energy supply. Making energy generation community- based and seriously good fun, the focus of the project is to co-design playground equipment, co-create sustainable power and co-build an adventure playground. Mike Hawes of Mor Design was senior producing this project. Big Design Challenge The final project of Dott was the Big Design Challenge that encouraged citizens to co-design and get involved in the co-production of solutions to local challenges. Big Design Challenge was subsequently selected by NESTA to be part of its Creative Councils programme.

The user base was geared towards teens. In August 2009, the site was reported to have over 3 million unique visitors a month with a growth rate of about 35% a month. On 11 November 2012, it was announced that the site would be closing down on 14 November, with users able to access and download their content until 31 December, at which point the site would be deleted completely. DailyBooth was funded by the startup funding firm, Y Combinator.  History  DailyBooth was founded and opened in February 2009 by Jon Wheatley and lead developer Ryan Amos, gaining popularity after several YouTube stars and Internet celebrities, such as Ashton Kutcher and his wife Demi Moore joined and encouraged their viewers and readers to join. On 7 September 2009 the site passed the 1,000,000 photo mark1,000,000th picture and the user who posted the 1,000,000th photo won a Throwboy pillow.DailyBooth Throwboy Competition In early 2010, the website reached 3,000,000 photos and 10,000,000 comments.

Y Combinator stated that they had once considered a name change for DailyBooth, but were afraid it would cause a revolt with the community. In April 2012 it was announced that Airbnb will take over the team of DailyBooth in their search for talent. On 11 November 2012, members were sent an e-mail stating that no more content could be uploaded after 14 November and that all content will be permanently deleted on 31 December 2012.

Sidewiki was a browser extension that allowed anyone logged into a Google Account to make and view comments about a given website in a sidebar.

Anyone could look up a contributor's Google profile and assess their credibility. Caesar Sengupta of Google argued that the link to Google Profiles would help increase comment quality, because \\"People stop making trivial comments when it ties back to them.\\" Website owners could \\"claim\\" their site, giving them the right to the first comment on the Sidewiki for that site. Sidewiki also linked to \\"relevant posts from blogs and other sources\\", a feature that was potentially gameable. Sidewiki was available for Internet Explorer and Firefox through Google Toolbar, and on the Google Chrome browser through an add-on.

Jeff Jarvis complained that Sidewiki \\"takes comments away from my blog and puts them on Google. That sets up Google in channel conflict vs me.

Mark Borkowski predicted that \\"SideWiki is going to challenge PR by providing the masses with the tool for the ultimate expression of people power, something uncontainable that will need constant monitoring...

Rates of population growth, usually expressed as a percentage, vary greatly. The immigrating population has increased by a huge margin in the past few years. Due to this rising trend of migration it is important that we look into how migration has affected the population, and the trends that follow with it. The countries that are to be looked into are Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. The Western European countries under discussion are England, Wales, France, the Netherlands, Scotland, Switzerland, and Italy from Southern Europe. During the whole conducted study it appears that six countries had negative conclusions for net migration. Every Nordic country other than Denmark, Italy, and Scotland had values that are close to zero. The countries that had a positive migrating population are Denmark, England, Wales, Netherlands, France, and Switzerland. In the early 19th century it appeared all countries had an outflow of immigrants leaving the country but in the 20th century it became a positive inflow. Due to this push and pull these countries experienced during the 21st century there was a positive flow of immigration into the countries. Due to this increased migrating population soon countries will begin to start persuading individuals to move into a more rural area other countries because the big cities will begin to start see an overcrowding population. For example, Australia is beginning to see this overcrowding that would soon follow for other countries. Because of this Australia has begun to place a cap on the amount of citizens allowed into the bigger cities which will force citizens to live in the less populated rural areas. This idea is called the Strategic Plan which sets a cap on the amount of population that is allowed in certain cities. This is a prime example of what will happen to other countries due to the exceeding immigrant population growth they will soon start to experience. Caps will be placed on big cities and force those who are already living in the city to be moved to the rural areas. References Murphy, M. (2016).

Background In Portugal, the death of King Sebastian of Portugal in 1578, with only an elderly childless great uncle to succeed him, plunged the country into a succession crisis. King Philip II of Spain was one of seven who laid claim to the Portuguese throne, and in June 1580 a Spanish army of about 40,000 menDauril Alden p.90 (about half of which were German and Italian mercenaries)Jeremy Black p.119Thomas Henry Dyer p.287 invaded Portugal, under the command of Don Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba. Two years earlier, the Portuguese army had been decimated at the Battle of Ksar El Kebir (1578),David S. Katz p.51 causing the death and imprisonment of tens of thousands of Portuguese soldiers and nobles. Dom Ant√≥nio also lacked support from what was left of the Portuguese nobility and high clergy, which chose to support Philip II instead.David Eggenberger p.10Peter N. Stearns, William Leonard Langer p.296 Dom Ant√≥nio was therefore forced to recruit an irregular army composed mainly of local peasants and townspeopleTony Jaques p.25Cathal J. Nolan p.10David Eggenberger p.10 as well as 3,000 African slaves who fought for Ant√≥nio in exchange for their freedom.History of Portugal: pamphlet collection p.267Newton de Macedo p.96 Battle The Duke of Alba met little resistance and in July landed his forces at Cascais, west of Lisbon. By mid-August, the Duke was only 10 kilometers from the city. West of the small brook Alc√¢ntara, the Spanish encountered a Portuguese force on the eastern side of it, commanded by Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato (a grandson of King Manuel I of Portugal who had proclaimed himself King as Ant√≥nio I) and his lieutenant Francisco de Portugal, 3rd Count of Vimioso. The battle ended in a decisive victory for the Spanish army, both on land and sea. Two days later, the Duke of Alba captured Lisbon, and on March 25, 1581, Philip of Spain was crowned King of Portugal as Philip I. Aftermath The decimated Antonian army fled towards Porto with the intention of reassembling his troops, but was completely destroyed at Porto by the Spanish forces under the command of Don Sancho d'Avila.Espasa. Vol 6. p.1297 At the end of 1580, most of the Portuguese territory was in Spanish hands. Two more battles (1582 and 1583) over the succession were fought in the Azores. Spain and Portugal would remain united in a personal union of the crowns (remaining formally independent and with autonomous administrations) for the next 60 years, until 1640.

History  Entrance The Otter Centre originated in the Fischotter-Forschungsgehege Oderhaus (\\"Oderhaus Otter Research Station\\") which the Lower Saxon Forestry Commission established in 1979 near Sankt Andreasberg in the Harz mountains. Claus Reuther, an official of the Forestry Commission, played a leading role, setting up the Aktion Fischotterschutz in Braunlage in 1979 which took part in the scientific investigation programme. When the project ended in 1986 the group conceived the idea for an otter centre, which was opened in Hankensb√ºttel in 1988. As a result, it changed from an otter conservation group into a state-recognised nature conservation organisation. The instigator of the Otter Centre was Claus Reuther who became its head from the outset. The facility suffered a setback in 1993 when there was a serious fire in the main building. Reuther was accused of causing the fire but was cleared by the court in 1995. He died in 2004.\\"Claus Reuther\\" at cms.otterzentrum.de , \\"Aktion Fischotterschutz A.G.\\",.

Accessed on 2009-10-01.  Environment  Otter Centre The Centre provides environmental education through practical learning and experimentation. Visitors are given a closer insight into environmental and nature conservation throughout the entire site based on the motto Play and Learn. To that end there is a range of mechanical equipment, which help to illustrate various facts - for example, visitors can feed a wooden beech marten with magnetic picture plate in order to find out which food this animal actually eats. The educational games vary considerably. A 'red thread' leads through the Otter Centre past a series of folding question boards where visitors can put their own knowledge to the test.  Research  In addition to disseminating information, the Otter Centre is also dedicated to research, most of which takes place on land separated from the public areas. The research enclosures are focused on the requirements of otters and are all provided with ponds, whilst the smaller internal enclosure of the attached quarantine station is also suitable for other species. In addition the young animals born in captivity are generally conceived and born on the research terrain in order to ensure the pregnant females can give birth in an environment which is as peaceful as possible.\\"Tierforschung\\" at cms.otterzentrum.de , \\"Aktion Fischotterschutz A.G.\\". Accessed on 2009-10-01.  Biotope conservation  The Otter Centre buys or rents land with running water at various places in Lower Saxony in order to develop secluded habitats for otters. For example, a canalised water system on the Ise has been revitalised and made to resemble a natural environment. This pilot project was promoted by the Federal Environment Ministry. An important principle with this type of biotope conservation is not to put large areas out of bounds, but to work in cooperation and understanding with local residents. So agricultural use is not banned, but encouraged along lines compatible with nature. This means in practice that only the strips along the river banks must remain completely out of bounds, whilst the remainder of the land can be used for grassland cultivation.\\"Naturschutz und Bildung f√ºr nachhaltige Entwicklung\\" at cms.otterzentrum.de , \\"Aktion Fischotterschutz A.G.\\".

Ottoman merchants can be seen on this painting by Gerrit Berckheyde. Corneli(u)s Haga (Schiedam, 28 January 1578 ‚Äì The Hague, 12 August 1654) was the first ambassador of the Dutch Republic to the Ottoman Empire.  Biography  Cornelius Haga was born in Schiedam. His father was Dirk Lambrechtszoon, merchant and member of the town council of Schiedam, and organist of the church there. Haga was educated at the Latin school in Schiedam before he studied law at the University of Leiden. He went into diplomatic service and became an envoy in Stockholm. After this he became the first diplomatic representative of the republic in Constantinople from 1612 to 1639. He was accompanied on his adventurous journey by Cornelis Pauw (son of the Amsterdam mayor Reinier Pauw), Ernst Brinck, secretary, and Cornelis Sijms, both also sons of regents and Andries Suyderhoeff, who later replaced Brinck as secretary of the delegation, and Lambert Verhaer, who had been a goldsmith in Constantinople and was the only member of the group who had made the journey before.Haga Biography in the NNBW Haga laid the foundations of diplomatic relations and he erected numerous consular posts at the most important ports and trade-centra in the Ottoman Empire; Patras, Thessaloniki, Athens, Gallipoli, Izmir, Aleppo, Sidon, Dairo, Tunis and Algiers. Haga, who was married to Alithea Brasser, received the capitulation of the Ottoman Sultan, Ahmed I in 1612. This allowed the Dutch to trade with the Ottoman Empire under their own jurisdiction. The sultan also granted the Dutch several privileges, including exemption of certain taxes and limited autonomy within the empire. In 1639 Haga returned to the Netherlands. In 1645 he became president of the High Council of Holland, Zeeland and West- Friesland, a function that he kept until his death in 1654. His portrait by an unknown painter is in the collection of the Mauritshuis, on loan to the Rijksmuseum. His wife's portrait by Michiel van Mierevelt is in the collection of the KMSK of Antwerp.one of two Mierevelt portraits of Aletta Brasser in the database of the RKD Cornelius Haga and his wife Alithea Brasser were buried in the Great church of Schiedam.

It lies on the north border of Lake Yojoa.Marcus 1976: 583 It is significant to the region because of its implications on determining where the Mayan frontier existed, as well as which ancient peoples were in contact and what relations between \\"tribes\\" may have been like. Whether or not the Maya influenced the people of the Lake Yojoa region is disputed. Archaeological excavations In 1935, Frans Blom and Jens Yde conducted an excavation of a large mound at Los Naranjos. They found a large collection of polychrome pottery. They believed the large mound, which was one of many, was a burial mound because the bowls and pots they found were deliberately buried there. J.B. Edwards, a former Harvard botanist, helped Blom and Yde in their exploration of the site. He had excavated there in the past and had a large collection of antiquities. Yde purchased many of the specimens for the Danish National Museum. One particular vessel that Yde purchased became a topic of interest and was coined \\"the Yde Vessel\\".Neilsen & Brady 2006: From 1967 to 1969, archaeologists Claude F. Baudez and Pierre Becquelin periodically excavated the region. The two published the work Archeologie de Los Naranjos as a field guide for their findings. The work was written in French and an English translation is not readily available. The book includes both pictures of artifacts and tables that explain periods and locations of uncovered antiquities. They found sherds of ceramic vessels that came from four different periods, suggesting prolonged use of the site. They used four phases from which the artifacts they discovered came: Jaral (800‚Äì400 B.C.), Eden which is divided into Eden I (400‚Äì100 B.C.) and Eden II (100 B.C.‚ÄìA.D. 550), Yojoa (A.D. 550-950) and Rio Blanco (A.D. 950-1250). Various antiquities found at the site include jade figurines, clay pottery and a jadeite hand axe, many of which suggest relation to Olmec origin. Clay pottery included findings of polychrome, monochrome and Ulua bichrome coloration. Each varying coloration seems to have existed in different periods. The stratigraphy, or way that strata separate periods, suggests that the region had been occupied for a long period. The oldest layers of strata contained monochrome pottery with little or no design. Sherds of pottery in the nearby La Sierra site seem to have direct ties with the pottery of Los Naranjos in the Late Classic period. Newer layers of strata showed polychrome pottery that was more advanced. Most of the pottery found in the region was made locally, although some may have been traded for.Henderson et al. 1979: Radiocarbon dating of seven sherds from the excavation site provided the basis for the periods. The white-slipped polychrome pottery of the Terminal Classic period at Los Naranjos is \\"Las Vegas\\" polychrome, similar to types of \\"Las Vegas\\" polychrome at Comayagua. It is in close stylistic relation to sherds from Rivas Papagayo but earlier in date.Healy 1980: 323‚Äì324 The Yde Vessel A clay vessel that is of particular interest was discovered at Los Naranjos. The vessel, in comparison with other pottery found at the site, is large and extraordinarily decorated. The remaining fragment is 24.4 cm high and the rim appeared to have a diameter of about 23 cm. The decoration of the pottery is in black and red with the base of the vessel being orange. The designs depict \\"dancing figures\\" which is a common theme of art from the time period. The figures are seen in a cave. Archaeologist and historians attribute the setting of the cave as part of a common motif, incorporating ideas of the first humans and genesis of humankind. Nielsen and Brady believe that a deity, represented by a crocodilian figure outside the cave, is a symbol of fertility and was believed to preside over the genesis of mankind. In The Couple in the Cave Jesper Nielsen and James E. Brady propose that the people of Los Naranjos may have believed that Lake Yojoa and the Cave of Taulab√© were the birthplace of humans. They go on to say that in MesoAmerican cultures, having territory near the birthplace of mankind was invaluable.Nielsen & Brady 2006 Ditches The site contained two large ditches, one that stretched from Lake Yojoa to a pool just north of an encampment, made during the Jaral phase. The second ditch was probably constructed during the Eden phase. The purpose of the ditches is disputed, however there is evidence to support the idea that they were probably used as a defense mechanism. Another possibility was that they were filled with water, however the bedrock at the bottom of the ditches is seemingly too porous for a water well. People of Los Naranjos The Lake Yojoa region of Honduras lies about from what was defined as a probable boundary of the Maya territories.Thompson 1975: 321 It is presumed that the people of Los Naranjos spoke Lenca, a language that is indigenous to Honduras and El Salvador. The Lenca language is nearly extinct in modern times and there is a movement to preserve and restore the language, as there are still people of Lenca origin.Campbell 1976, passim. Baudez and Becquelin found evidence for a hierarchical society at Los Naranjos. Among the buried, there was a varying array of antiquities, some more advanced than others. People having been buried differently suggested to Baudez and Becquelin that a hierarchy may have been in place.Marcus 1976: 583; Thompson 1975: 321 Affiliations with other Mesoamerican cultures It appears that the people of Los Naranjos had temporal variations in cultural relations with other Mesoamerican societies. Antiquities from the Jaral phase suggest relation with the Olmec. Jade workings and Olmec influenced sherds were present during the time period and trade may have been possible. During the phase Eden II, the pottery of the region had little or no similarities with Tzakol pottery. The region may have been on the periphery of Maya and other Mesoamerican peoples during the Eden phase. Strata from the Late Classic Period, however, revealed that half of the pottery that the people used was of Maya relation. The Maya-related pottery was Polychrome.

The route was a former alignment of U.S. Route 206 and New Jersey Route 39 in the downtown portions of Mansfield Township and Columbus. Route 170 began at an intersection with U.S. Route 206 in Mansfield Township, headed northward along Atlantic Avenue and New York Avenue in Columbus before merging with U.S. Route 206 at a wye connection further north. The highway was assigned as part of Route 39 in the state highway renumbering in 1927. The route remained intact, receiving a concurrency through the two communities when U.S. Route 206 was assigned in the mid-1930s. The two routes remained intact until the state highway renumbering on January 1, 1953, when Route 39 was decommissioned in favor of just U.S. Route 206. The highway was bypassed in 1957, with Route 206 heading to the outside of the communities. The original alignment became Route 170, and lasted until 1986, when it was removed from the state maintenance. The state turned the alignment over to Burlington County, who re-designated it as County Route 690.  Route description  The northern terminus of Route 170 at U.S. Route 206 in Columbus *This route description is written as the route exists today. Burlington County Route 690 (also known as Atlantic Avenue) begins at an wye intersection with U.S. Route 206 in the community of Mansfield Township. The route heads northward, intersecting with the southbound portion of the road. Route 690 becomes surrounded by several residential homes for a distance, becoming more commercial as the route heads northward, entering the community of Columbus. Route 690 continues through the business district of Columbus, intersecting with County Route 543 (Main Street) in the center of the community. At County Route 543, County Route 690 shifts to the east a bit, changing names from Atlantic Avenue to New York Avenue, where it returns to the residential progression in Columbus. The route, which parallels Route 206 to the west, intersects with Locust Avenue, a one-way road towards several local businesses. A short distance after Locust Avenue, Route 690 reaches a gap in the residential homes, turning to fields and rural areas a short distance later. Although the route parallels several homes to the west, the route remains lightly developed, entering another wye at County Route 678, where the route merges into U.S. Route 206 once again in Columbus.  History  Blade sign depicting County Route 690, which is what was designated along the alignment after Route 170 was decommissioned The alignment of Route 170 dates back to the 1927 state highway renumbering as an alignment of New Jersey Route 39.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. When Route 39 was assigned, the route went from U.S. Route 30 and New Jersey Route 54 in Hammonton northward along present-day U.S. Route 206 to County Route 524 in Hamilton Township, where it turned off Route 206 towards the Yardley-Wilburtha Bridge. Route 39 remained intact, and received a large concurrency with U.S. Route 206, when assigned in the mid-1930s. The two remained concurrent for several years, until the second state highway renumbering on January 1, 1953. On that day, Route 39 was decommissioned in its entirety, leaving the alignment fully U.S. Route 206. In 1957, the New Jersey State Highway Department built a bypass of U.S. Route 206 around the community of Columbus, heading to the west of the community. Upon completion of the bypass, Route 206 was replaced by Route 170, which ran along Atlantic Avenue and New York Avenue through the community. The route remained intact for several decades, lasting until May 15, 1986 when jurisdiction of the route was transferred to Burlington County. The route still continued to appear in state documents by 1988. When the route was turned over, it became Burlington County Route 690.

A descendant of Damascus, he was sired by Private Account by breeder Equigroup Thoroughbreds. Corporate Report was a grade one stakes winning millionaire who won the Travers Stakes and finished second to dual classic winner Hansel in the 1991 Preakness Stakes.Pedigee Online, Thoroughbred Database website;  Early career  Corporate Report developed shin conditions late in his two-year-old season and did not race that year. In the early part of his three-year-old season, he broke his maiden. Trainer D. Wayne Lukas then decided to take him to Oaklawn Park Race Course and put him on the Arkansas track through the Triple Crown trail. After winning an allowance race, Corporate Report placed second in the grade two Rebel Stakes. He was entered in the grade two Arkansas Derby and placed second to Olympio. His owners at Overbrook Farm were encouraged by the two graded stakes placings and entered Corporate Report in the 117th Kentucky Derby in 1991. In that race, Corporate Report shot to just off the lead and battled on the front end in third for most of the race. Coming down the long Churchill Downs stretch, many closers passed him in the lane as he faded to ninth. It was the only time in his career that he finished out of the money. Strike the Gold and Best Pal finished one-two.  Preakness Stakes  Two weeks later, Corporate Report ran in the second jewel of the Triple Crown. The three top finishers in the Derby, along with Arkansas Derby winner Olympio, took most of the public support. Corporate Report was an 11-1 longshot in the grade one 1991 Preakness Stakes. All eight colts broke from the starting gate in good order. Passing the stands for the first time, Corporate Report battled with Olympio for the lead, with stalker Hansel one length back. Corporate Report led around the clubhouse turn and down most of the backstretch. Hansel then took the lead and won by seven lengths. Corporate Report finished second, earning $100,000. The Derby winner, Strike the Gold, was never a factor and finished a distant sixth. In addition to runner-up finishes in the Preakness Stakes, Arkansas Derby and Rebel Stakes, Corporate Report placed second in the grade one Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park later that summer and placed second in the grade two Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park in the autumn.  Travers Stakes  On a muggy summer afternoon before 48,170 spectators at Saratoga Race Course, Corporate Report led almost wire to wire and beat Hansel by a neck in the Travers Stakes. Two and a half lengths back in third place came Fly So Free, last year's juvenile champion, and three lengths back in fourth place was the favorite, Strike the Gold.

Their class composition was Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs, Dogras, Hill Rajputs and Gurkhas. The regiment took part in the Bhutan War of 1864-66, the Second Afghan War of 1878-80, and the Siege of Malakand in 1895-97. At Malakand, Sir Winston Churchill, who was covering the campaign as a war correspondent for the Daily Telegraph, was temporarily attached with the regiment. The future Prime Minister of Great Britain cut an impressive figure on his grey charger, being in the thick of action everywhere. He, however, was disappointed when he was not allowed to take over the command of the regiment!Qureshi, Col HU. (1985). History of DoSolah: 14th Battalion The Punjab Regiment 1857-1985.

During the First World War, the 31st Punjabis served in Mesopotamia and Salonika in Greece. It then served at Constantinople, Turkey as part of Allied occupation forces. Subsequent history In 1921‚Äì22, a major reorganization was undertaken in the British Indian Army, leading to the formation of large infantry groups of four to six battalions. Among these was the 16th Punjab Regiment, formed by grouping the 31st Punjabis with the 30th, 33rd and 46th Punjabis, and the 9th Bhopal Infantry. The battalion's new designation was 2nd Battalion 16th Punjab Regiment. During the Second World War, the battalion fought in the Malayan Campaign and was taken prisoner by the Japanese on Singapore Island following the British surrender on 15 February 1942. It was re-raised in 1946. In 1947, the 16th Punjab Regiment was allocated to Pakistan Army. In 1956, it was merged with the 1st, 14th and 15th Punjab Regiments to form one large Punjab Regiment, and 2/16th Punjab was redesignated as 14 Punjab.

(New Jersey Route 59 is the shortest recorded route in the state at long.) Route 177 went for a short, state-maintained portion of Bridge Street in Somerville. One of only three state highways in Somerset County after the 1953 state highway renumbering, Route 177 was the only one to be decommissioned later on. (The other two highways are Route 27 further south and Route 28 further north) The short-lived designation went from U.S. Route 206 in Somerville, up Bridge Street near the Old Cemetery to Fifth Street, where state maintenance terminated. In 1974, the Department of Transportation turned maintenance of this short highway over to the borough of Somerville for future use.  Route description  Route 177's former northern terminus at 5th Street viewed from Somerville Old Cemetery Route 177 began at a traffic light intersection with U.S. Route 206 in the city of Somerville. At the intersection, southbound traffic on Route 206 had to use a jughandle to connect to Route 177\\\\. The state highway went northeastward, progressing along as South Bridge Street through a curve. Heading northward, the route passed the Somerville Old Cemetery before intersecting with Fifth Street. There, state-maintenance ended, and the designation of Route 177 terminated. Entering downtown Somerville, South Bridge Street continued northward into a large residential community. Passing to the east and west of several residential homes, South Bridge Street continued into the downtown portion, crossing the current-day Raritan Valley Line tracks maintained by New Jersey Transit and served the Somerville train station. After a couple of blocks of residential homes and businesses, South Bridge Street came to an intersection with New Jersey Route 28, where it switched to North Bridge Street.  History  The alignment of Route 177 was a former alignment of State Highway Route 31 through Somerville. The highway was instated in 1926 as U.S. Route 206 and 1927 as State Highway Route 31 by the New Jersey State Highway Department and the Federal Highway Administration respectively.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. By 1930, Routes 206 and 31 was shifted off of Bridge Street, running along a partially completed bypass of Somerville. By 1938, this was completed and Route 206 was shifted to the southern terminus of Bridge Street south of the old cemetery.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1938, Section 1 Bridge Street remained unnumbered until the second state highway renumbering on January 1, 1953. That day, the unnumbered alignment became Route 177, running from US 206 to Fifth Street, where it met US 206's former alignment. The route remained intact for a couple of decades, as one of three state highways in Somerset County (along with Route 28 and Route 27) until 1974, when the route was decommissioned and turned over to the borough of Somerville.

The highway ran along a former alignment of Route 39 and U.S. Route 206 (US 206) called Mission Road in Bordentown Township. The route began at an intersection with US 206, paralleling the four-lane highway to the east and serving local residences before turning to the northwest and serving a strip mall. The highway merged with US 206 further north past an intersection with Hilltop Road. Route 160 was assigned in the 1953 state highway renumbering over a realigned portion of Routes 39 and 206 eleven years before, which was made to bypass Mission Road. The designated highway ran along Mission Road's entire length for several years until being decommissioned by 1980 by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT).

The former alignment of U.S. Route 206 southbound is noticeable to the west *This route description is written as the route exists today. Mission Road, the former alignment of Route 160 begins at an intersection with US 206 in the Parsonville community of Bordentown Township. Mission Road heads northward, intersecting with Groveville Road (a connector to US 130), passing several residential homes. Passing far to the east of Northern Community Park, the highway intersects with several dead-end residential streets. Paralleling US 206 to the east, Mission Road continues northward, forking to the left at an intersection with Liberty Avenue. At the fork, Hilltop Road begins to the right. Mission Road, after the fork, heads on a northwest direction, serving as a frontage road to US 206\\\\. A short distance later, US 206 intersects via an offramp to Mission Road and the local strip mall. After passing the strip mall, Mission Road completes a large bend and intersects with Hilltop Road once again. Just after Hilltop Road, Mission Road turns to the west and merges back onto US 206's alignment. History The short alignment of Route 160 dates back to the 1927 state highway renumbering as an alignment of Route 39.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. Route 39 was designated to run from the Yardley-Wilburtha Bridge (demolished during Hurricane Diane in 1955) in Wilburtha southward along a semi-circlular path of Trenton before turning on to US 206 southward to Hammonton, where it followed US 30 to DaCosta. The alignment of Route 39 was joined by the designation of Route 206 in the mid-1930s, and remained intact for several years. In 1942, the alignment of Routes 39 and 206 was realigned to the east of Mission Road. No designation replaced the roadway until the second state highway renumbering on January 1, 1953. On that day, Route 39 was decommissioned in its entirety, leaving the divided highway only US 206, and the alignment of Mission Road received the designation of 160. Route 160 remained intact for several years and was eventually decommissioned by NJDOT by 1980. During the time the road existed as a state highway, access was provided to and from Route 160 from both directions of US 206 but by 1971, the road was accessible only to and from northbound US 206.

There was also an interchange with U.S. Route 30, and the entire roadway was near Interstate 676's Interchange 5A. Route 151 ran along South Tenth Street for eastbound traffic and South Eleventh Street for westbound traffic west of Mount Ephraim Avenue. From there, South Tenth was known as Flanders Avenue and South Eleventh was known as Memorial Avenue. At U.S. Route 30, the route continued bi-directionally as Flanders Avenue until its end at County Route 537. Route 151 originated in 1946 law, when the state took over maintenance of the local streets. The route ran from State Highway Route 25 in Camden to a ferry at Market and Green Streets for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Route 151's eastbound lanes continued eastward through the Camden Gateway, crossing over U.S. Route 30 (Admiral Wilson Boulevard), then interchanging with the westbound lanes of the boulevard. There, the westbound lanes (Memorial Avenue) ended, and Route 151 continued as one set of bi-directional roadways, along Flanders Avenue heading northbound from Admiral Wilson Boulevard to the route's terminus at County Route 537 (Federal Street) in Camden. History The alignment of Route 151 originates to 1946, when the state took over jurisdiction of South Tenth Street, South Eleventh Street and Flanders Avenue from an entrance road on State Highway Route 25 near the Cooper River. It ran through the Camden business center to a ferry for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on Market Street and Federal Street. The route survived the state highway renumbering on January 1, 1953. The route remained in commission until the 1960s, when it was turned back over to the city of Camden for maintenance. The alignment of former Route 151 is currently part of the New Jersey Department of Transportation's Camden Central Gateway project. The $10.8 million (2008 USD) project will involve several roadway improvements along South Tenth Street and South Eleventh Street. Along South Tenth Street, the department plans to turn the portion of South Tenth Street from Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard to Mount Ephraim Avenue to a bi-directional roadway. Along South Eleventh Street, the department plans to convert the entirety of the roadway to bi-directional. South Eleventh Street will also receive a ramp from Interstate 676 on interchange 5A. With the change in direction, the directional loops connecting both roadways are planned to be removed. The entire project ran from December 2008 to February 2010.

It is bordered by the American Colony to the north, Wadi al-Joz to the east, Herod's Gate and Damascus Gate on its south, and Mas'udiyyah and Mea Shearim to the west. Herod's Gate, which is called Bab az-Zahra in Arabic, lent its name to this neighborhood. History At the end of the Second Temple Period, the building of the so-called Third Wall of Jerusalem, started under the reign of Herod Agrippa I (r. 41-44 CE), finished by the rebels around 66 CE and destroyed by the Romans at the end of the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War in 70 CE, meant that the area was included for a short while behind the protective walls of the city.

Features The main thoroughfares of the neighborhood, Nablus Road, Salah ad-Din Street (pictured at right), A-Zahara Street and surrounding streets are major commercial centers. Branches of the main banks and restaurants have offices there. The commercial area continues uninterrupted through Damascus Gate with the open market in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City. In the eastern part of the neighborhood resides the Rockefeller Museum of Archaeology, which was opened in 1937. Also on Salah a-Din Road are located the district court, the judiciary office, and the legal counsel for the government. Another famous building in this neighborhood is the Orient House.

The shadow puppetry-inspired game play focuses on manipulating and combining the shadows of objects in order to create a larger shadow that resembles a particular thing, specifically animals, items, and symbols. The game was released on the Wii Shop Channel in North America on January 11, 2010, and is one of the first WiiWare games to utilize the Wii MotionPlus accessory.  Gameplay  In ShadowPlay, the player's objective is to create a shadow that matches a shadow target on a backdrop by manipulating given objects using the Wii Remote. Objects can be rotated to change the shape of their shadows, or the object's distance from the light source is changed to enlarge or shrink the shadow's size. Players are scored on how fast they can arrange the objects to match the given shadow target, and how accurately the created shadow matches the target. There are 100 puzzles available, divided amongst 10 distinct \\"themes.\\" A sandbox mode is available where players can freely experiment with all the game's available objects in order to create their own shadow art. The game offers two modes of control: the Wii Remote with the Nunchuk accessory, or with the Wii MotionPlus accessory. The Nunchuk gives the player the ability to rotate objects using the Nunchuk's analog stick, while the Wii MotionPlus allows players to fully rotate the entire controller in order to rotate individual objects. Players may play as a single player or with more than one player in local co-op mode where players can collaboratively work on challenges together.  Reception  ShadowPlay received generally positive reviews. IGN awarded the game a 7.5 out of 10, praising the decision to include Wii MotionPlus compatibility, calling it \\"spot-on\\" and \\"well-suited,\\" but criticized the game's longevity, specifically the small number of available puzzles.

Some of her more notable subjects are Hillary Clinton, Jim Morrison, Hugh Hefner, Ellen DeGeneres, and King Hussein of Jordan. Her work is influenced by Andy Warhol and Keith Haring. Personal life Allison Lefcort was born the daughter of Robert and Ronni Lefcort, a Yale University alumni and a visual artist. When she was a little girl, Lefcort created a portrait of Dan Marino, which is displayed in her studio in Boca Raton, Florida. She attended Spanish River High School in Boca Raton. While there she made a painting of the band The Doors, which was the genesis of her \\"pop art\\" style. She graduated from high school in 1993. Lefcort attended Skidmore College and majored in art. She decided to drop out of college when, successfully selling her works, an art teacher told her and her classmates to forget all they knew about art so that she could be taught properly. Her parents made a deal with her: If she attended the New York Art Expo and her work was recognized, she could pursue her career rather than return to college. She sold made beneficial contacts and sold three paintings at the expo. She didn't return to college and her mother, a supporter throughout her artistic career, is her publicist and manager. Seeds of Peace, GLAAD and United Cerebral Palsy are charities that have benefited from Lefcort's artwork donations for fundraising. She has shared her love of art by teaching children's art classes. Career Celebrity portraits In 1992, when she was 17 years old, Lefcort's work was exhibited at the Greenwich Village Art Gallery, her first professional exhibition. Starting in 1991, Lefcort made paintings of the recipients of the Musicares's Humanitarian of the Year award. They are hung next to works by Peter Max at the Musicare's office in Los Angeles. In 1998, Lefcort presented the portrait of the recipient, Luciano Pavarotti, at the awards ceremony. She was made a portrait of Hillary Clinton on 4' by 4' canvas. Lefcort also made a portrait that size for Ellen DeGeneres, who autographed a second painting Lefcort had made for herself. She made portraits of Barbra Streisand, and Mikhail Baryshnikov. Lefcort's painting of Roy Orbison is owned by the man who produced concerts for him, Brian Carabet. In 1998, she made a portrait of Sigmund Freud that was presented for auction at the \\"Freud Amongst the Arts\\" show and auction, Southeast Florida Association for Psychoanalytic Psychology. By 2003, she made a portrait of Queen Noor and Hussein bin Talal, The King of Jordan, that were hung in the king and queen's palace. Lefcort also painted the portraits of Hugh Hefner, Charlie Chaplin, Ray Charles, Jodie Foster, Jim Morrison, and James Dean. Walt Disney In 2003 she was commissioned by Disney Fine Art to create paintings of characters, like Tigger and Mickey Mouse from Disney films. Lefcort created Abracadabra for Disney's publisher, Collector's Editions, to mark the 75th anniversary of Mickey Mouse. It was released in November, 2004. Events were held in stores in Europe, Japan and the United States to market the limited edition paintings. Themes, subjects and methods Her work is noticeable for its monochromatic scheme of black, white and grey in the foreground, and bright bold colors of the background. She uses acrylic paints exclusively on paper, wood, or canvas to create her pop art portraits. She spends more time designing and drafting a portrait than painting the work. Lefcort‚Äôs says \\"boldness and simplicity are the keys to unlocking the imagery.\\" Her work is influenced by Keith Haring and Andy Warhol. She says that \\"Boldness and simplicity are the keys to the success of my portraits. The vibrant color of the background accents the shapes and shadows and enhances the three-dimensional appearance.\\" Lefcort refers to images of celebrities from photographs, books or magazines to formulate the original image that she will make. She does not have her works reproduced to avoid licensing issues, instead, if she wants a second or more copies, she'll paint each separately. For instance, she made a copy of a Mikhail Baryshnikov painting, one of her first and favored, for a couple who wished to have the painting. Disney, though, does make reproductions of her work for their enterprise. She generally paints portraits on 4' by 4' canvas, but has also painted images on guitars, like one made of Elvis and on smaller canvases.

It is in Salvale√≥n de Hig√ºey. The basilica is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Altagracia en Hig√ºey. The cathedral was raised to the honor of a minor basilica by Pope Paul VI on December 17, 1970. It was visited by Pope John Paul II during his visit to the country in 1992. Among many legends, one stands out. A long time ago a young girl from Salvale√≥n de Hig√ºey asked her father for a portrait of the Virgin Mary. Her father (name unknown) brought the picture as gift for her. It is believed that the portrait was placed at the house of this girl. For some reason, at the break of dawn of each day, the portrait was always found outside the house, beneath a small tree. Every day this portrait was moved back inside by the girl, until she told her parents about it. The place became sacred, and the basilica was built on that same spot as reference of Mary's grace. The painting has been on display since 1571 and it was brought to the basilica in 1970. More than 800,000 visit the Basilica to see the image of Our Lady of Altagracia each year. The Feast of Our Lady of High Grace is celebrated as a national holiday on January 21; depending on the day of the week it can be on the Friday before or the Monday after. The feast day was originally held on August 15 (Assumption of Mary) but was moved to January 21 to celebrate a victory over the French in 1690.

Irja Margareta Hagfors (November 4, 1905 in Helsinki ‚Äì February 28, 1988 in Helsinki) was a Finnish dance artist, choreographer and dance teacher.Makkonen, Anne: One Past, Many Histories: Loitsu (1933) in the Context of Dance Art in Finland. (Part IV: Problems of the Modern and the National in Dance Art in Finland.) Ph.D. thesis. University of Surrey. Biography Hagfors initially studied dance in Finland, at the Gripenberg School and Salminen-Naparstok School. In 1926 she began her studies in Hellerau Laxemburg-school of dance in Laxenburg, near Vienna. She received a diploma in dance from there in 1928. She returned to Finland in 1928 and was a dance teacher in the autumn of action at Helvi Salminen's dance school. The November of that year was her first public dance performance in Finland. The following year, Hagfors went to Finland and worked for the next few years in many different theatrical and dance groups in Central Europe, including Berlin and Zurich. She was also known by her work in the Harald Kreutzberg and Trudi Schoopin dance groups. After the Second World War broke out she returned to Finland and then worked as a choreographer, dance teacher and dance critic. Hagfors was one of the pioneers of modern dance and a great defender of Finland. She participated actively in the new dance interpretation of the public polemic, achieving this most prominently in the Tulenkantajat, in the 5th to 10th editions of the journal in 1929, together with Antti Halonen and Raoul af H√§llstr√∂m. Hagfors readily acknowledged that a new dance (freedom of dance, dance of expression) is not fitted in the molds of classical ballet in that it is better technically than artistically. But unlike her opponents, she was able to clearly see the potential for a new dance classical ballet a deeper and more diverse expression. In a newspaper editorial, Tulenkantajat stated its admiration for her speech in this debate, in which Hagfors had shown in that her own work made her claims valid, so she could come out of this important cultural debate as a clear winner. Hagfors studied for a few years in Central Europe in the Rudolf von Laban movement analysis and the German dance theatre. These arrived to Finland and became more widely known only in 1960 and 1970s, mainly thanks to Marjo Kuusela. Hagfors made a significant cultural act when she translated Bertolt Brecht's book on theater theory into Finnish (1954). Hagfors' father, Dr. Edwin Hagfors, was a teacher and translator from Helsinki, and her mother, Ulla Charlotta Marchander, was from Sweden. Hagfors also had an older sister, Aino Elisabet Hagfors. In 1954 Irja Hagfors married Atos Wirtanen, a writer and Member of Parliament, he died in 1979.Eduskunnan matrikkeli Hagfors was awarded the Pro Finlandia medal in 1969.

It stands on the site of the old Church of Reconciliation (de) (), on Bernauer Strasse in the Mitte district.  Church of Reconciliation  The church was completed in 1894 as an imposing brick-built building by the architect Gotthilf Ludwig M√∂ckel, in the Gothic revival style. It sustained some damage in the Second World War, and still had a deactivated American bomb in the basement discovered during its reconstruction in 1999, but the church survived the war. With the Division of Berlin in 1945, the church building found itself within the Soviet sector, with most of the parishioners in the neighbouring French sector. This meant that when the Berlin Wall was constructed in 1961, it ran directly in front of the church on its western side and behind it on the eastern side, preventing access to everyone except the border guards, who used its tower as an observation post. The church building was destroyed in 1985 in order ‚Äòto increase the security, order and cleanliness on the state border with West Berlin‚Äô according to the official justification by the East German (GDR) government. The cross on the tower fell off the church when it was blown up and the members of the church hid it from the Soviets until the end of the Cold War. Four years later in 1989, the Wall fell.

While the general trend was to get rid of the physical evidence of Berlin‚Äôs division, the Reconciliation Parish considered the most suitable use for the site, in a way that commemorated its past whilst looking towards the future. The result was to build a chapel on the site; a modern construction that considered ecological and historical concerns as well as the needs of its parishioners. The Berlin architects Rudolf Reitermann and Peter Sassenroth were commissioned to design the chapel. Wooden columns were used for the outer oval wall, which recreates the shape of the chapel‚Äôs predecessor and the inner oval of the chapel is made from pressed clay and follows the usual east-west orientation of churches. The chapel was constructed in 1999 under the leadership of the Austrian clay artist Martin Rauch. Volunteers from Open Houses (a German charity founded in 1989 that specialises in preserving endangered historical monuments in east Germany, with the help of foreign volunteers) came from fourteen eastern and western European countries to support the building project. To construct the walls, 30 cm of moist clay was put into position and then compressed by 8 cm, giving the wall‚Äôs structure its strength. Within the clay, pieces of stone and even glass are visible and these came from the rubble of the previous church. It is the first clay-built public building to be built for over 150 years in Germany and the first clay-built German church. On 9 November 2000, on the eleventh anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Chapel of Reconciliation was consecrated. Statue of reconciliation The chapel unites architectural and ecological modernity with remembrance, standing as a triumph against its predecessor's destruction. Its memorial and reconciliation roles are recognised by the chapel being part of Berlin Wall Memorial (Gedenkstaette Berliner Mauer) and with it being included in Coventry Cathedral‚Äôs Community of the Cross of Nails: a world symbol for reconciliation and peace. The chapel also has a replica of Coventry Cathedral‚Äôs Statue of Reconciliation, a gift of the Cathedral found in Hiroshima and Belfast too ‚Äì also places emerging from the destructiveness of war. After helping with the construction, Open Houses has continued its involvement with the chapel. Every year volunteers from around the world work at the chapel and help the parish with their work.

The name the Richmond Flying Squirrels was chosen through a Richmond Times-Dispatch readers' \\"name-the-team-contest,\\" which ended on October 15, 2009. The name was submitted by Brad Mead of Prince George, Virginia. Other finalists were the Rock Hoppers, Hambones, Rhinos, Flatheads, and Hush Puppies. (The name Hambones was later ruled out of the contest after the city's uproar and the NAACP finding that \\"the Hambones\\" could be seen as a derogatory term directed towards the African-American community.)

The concept originated from entrepreneur Edward A. Blake in his attempt to quickly explain the purpose of a resource he was promoting to online service providers. Categorization In order for an item to be classed as an FVAR, Edward A Blake, who originated the concept, set out the following three requirements: #The item must be fixed in nature. That is, an item to be found on a constant basis within the core product, #The item must not be directly related in content to that of the core product.

It was under construction under contract for the Bharat Aluminium Co Ltd (BALCO). Construction had reached when the chimney collapsed on top of more than 100 workers who had been taking shelter from a thunderstorm. At least 45 deaths were recorded.\\">  Incident and rescue  Plans specify a chimney for the construction of a thermal power plant by Balco, which is owned by Vedanta Resources. The incident happened during extreme weather conditions involving lightning and torrential rainfall. Workers sought shelter from the rain in a nearby store room, and a lightning strike at approximately 16:00 brought the chimney down on top of them.< A rescue attempt was initiated following the collapse. Ongoing rain obstructed efforts to retrieve the trapped workers. At least seven of the wounded were hospitalised. A Gannon Dunkerley & Co Ltd employee was allegedly lynched by angry workers; his corpse was located near the scene. It was originally thought he had fallen from the chimney, but wounds indicate he was attacked.  Reaction  An investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of the collapse. Balco initially did not discuss the incident at length, stating only that \\"[t]here is an accident and some people are injured\\"; claiming to be too busy with the rescue effort to make a longer statement. The state government believes that Balco had been \\"overlooking security aspects\\". District superintendent of police, Ratanlal Dangi, described it as \\"a massive accident\\". Rs.100,000 (US$2084) in compensation will be granted to relatives of each of the dead. In November 2009, the project manager from GDCL was arrested, as well as three officials from Vedanta Resources which manages Balco. Later the National Institute of Technology (NIT) Raipur observed that the materials were of substandard quality and technically faulty in design. NIT also concluded that there was improper water curing and that soil at the site was not up to code. Additionally, supervision and monitoring was found to be negligent. On 11 January 2010, as a result of these findings, three senior officials of Sepco, the Chinese company contracted to build the chimney, were arrested and are being held without bail.  Litigations  The 2009 Korba Chimney Collapse case was headed by Judge Mahadev Katulkar. On 26 November 2009, he rejected bail pleas of BALCO officials, including Vice-President and AGM[clarification needed] of BALCO. He then sent the pair into judicial custody. Later, on 18 January 2010, Katulkar rejected the bail pleas of three Chinese nationals who were contracted by SEPCO to build the power plant by BALCO.

Biography He was born on August 10, 1947 and was reared in Hoboken. He was serving as president of the Hoboken City Council at the time of the death of Mayor Thomas Vezzetti in 1988. Pasculli was elected by the city council to serve as acting mayor. He resigned his seat on the Council, and was elected to a full term in 1989. He ran for mayor in 1989 on the promise to open the Hoboken waterfront to development. Pasculli's campaign led to the formation of the Coalition for a Better Waterfront which opposed his plan to lease city-owned land to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for commercial development. In 1992, when General Foods announced the closing of a 600 employee facility, Pasculli noted that the departure left the city with little business on the property immortalized in On the Waterfront. In 1990 he proclaimed that Hoboken's Elysian Fields was the site of the first game of baseball on June 19, 1846, dismissing the claim by Cooperstown, New York.

They were part of Marine Aircraft Group 42 and were decommissioned on 19 June 1999. The squadron is best known as the first Marine squadron to fly the F4U Corsair during World War II and also the first squadron to be based on an aircraft carrier. They were known as the ‚ÄúWild Aces‚Äù and ended World War II with 78 air-to-air victories against Japanese aircraft. History World War II Squadron logo from World War II VMF-124 was formed on September 2, 1942 at Camp Kearney, San Diego, California. They were declared fully operational on December 28, 1942 even though the squadron‚Äôs pilots had only an average of 25 hours each in the plane. They arrived on Guadalcanal on the morning of February 12, 1943 led by their commanding officer, Major William Gise. The squadron flew their first mission before lunch that day, with twelve F4Us escorting a PBY Catalina on a 230 mile mission to pick up two downed pilots at Sandfly Bay, Vella Lavella.Tillman Corsair, p. 29. VMF-124 Corsairs on Guadalcanal. The first F4U pilot to be decorated with the Medal of Honor came from VMF-124 -- 1st Lt Kenneth A. Walsh for a mission on August 30, 1943, during which he shot down four Japanese Zeros before ditching his borrowed Corsair. The squadron remained in the Solomon Islands until September 1943, fighting over the Russell Islands, New Georgia and Vella Levella. Following the fighting in the Solomons, the squadron was disbanded and reconstituted back in the United States where it trained in the Mojave Desert at Marine Corps Auxiliary Airfield Mojave for the next year. When they received their orders for carrier assignments they had 5 combat experienced pilots as their training nucleusCondon Corsirs and Flattops, p. 11-12. VMF-124 left the States again on September 18, 1944, heading to Hawaii. While in Hawaii they were attached to Navy Air Group 4 who were operating off the USS Essex (CV-9). Along with VMF-213, 124 became the first Marine squadron to be based on an aircraft carrier. While deployed aboard the Essex, they took part in fighting over Lingayen, Luzon, Formosa, Tokyo, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. On January 3, 1945 VMF-124 and VMF-213 struck Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands in the first Marine land strike off a carrier. Reserve activity The squadron was reformed shortly after the war at Naval Air Station Memphis and were equipped with the F4U-4 Corsair. They were the first squadron in the newly formed Marine Air Reserve Training Command to reach full strength. The squadron was redesignated Marine Attack Squadron 124 (VMA-124) on May 1, 1965 and were subsequently equipped with the A-4 Skyhawk. During the 1970s and 1980s they flew various versions of the A-4 until 1994 when the squadron was moved to Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth and redesignated Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 124 (VMFA-124). The squadron existed as a paper squadron only for two years while awaiting F/A-18 Hornets that would never materialize. The squadron existed on paper only until they were finally deactivated on 19 June 1999.Ginter & Albright (2001), p. 8 Squadron aces An A-4E of VMA-124 The following members of VMF-124 were credited with at least 5 enemy aircraft shot down during World War II: * William E.

It's one of the oldest and most prestigious medical schools in China. It is consistently ranked, as its parent Zhejiang University, among the elite schools in China and Asia. In 2018, Zhejiang University was ranked 3rd overall in China.http://www.shanghairanking.com/Chinese_Universities_Rankings/Overall- Ranking-2018.html History Zhejiang University School of Medicine is one of the first modern medical schools in China, and the first medical school combined with teaching hospital. ZJU Med has mainly two preexistences. The first one was Zhejiang Medical School (Traditional Chinese: ÊµôÊ±üÈÜ´Â≠∏Â∞àÈñÄÂ≠∏Ê†°; Simplified Chinese: ÊµôÊ±üÂåªÂ≠¶‰∏ìÈó®Â≠¶Ê†°), which was founded in June 1911 (some resources mention as on 1 June 1912), by Han Qing-quan; this school was one of the first medical school in China, and later it was renamed for several times, such as the mostly-common-known Zhejiang Provincial College of Medicine (Traditional Chinese: ÊµôÊ±üÁúÅÁ´ãÈÜ´Â≠∏Èô¢; Simplified Chinese: ÊµôÊ±üÁúÅÁ´ãÂåªÂ≠¶Èô¢). The second root of ZJU Med was the National Chekiang University School of Medicine (Traditional Chinese: ÂúãÁ´ãÊµôÊ±üÂ§ßÂ≠∏ÈÜ´Â≠∏Èô¢; Simplified Chinese: ÂõΩÁ´ãÊµôÊ±üÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÂåªÂ≠¶Èô¢; Chekiang is the old spelling/romanization for Zhejiang) which was founded in August 1945. In February 1952, the Zhejiang Provincial College of Medicine and the National Chekiang University School of Medicine were merged to form Zhejiang Medical College (Traditional Chinese: ÊµôÊ±üÈÜ´Â≠∏Èô¢; Simplified Chinese: ÊµôÊ±üÂåªÂ≠¶Èô¢). In April 1964, Zhejiang Medical College was promoted to Zhejiang Medical University (Traditional Chinese: ÊµôÊ±üÈÜ´ÁßëÂ§ßÂ≠∏; Simplified Chinese: ÊµôÊ±üÂåªÁßëÂ§ßÂ≠¶).General introduction to the Zhejiang University School of Medicine In 1998, the four separated universities (which shared the same root: National Chekiang University), namely Hangzhou University, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang Agricultural University, and Zhejiang Medical University were reunified to establish the new Zhejiang University, and the faculty of Zhejiang Medical University became the medical faculty of the new Zhejiang University after this reunification. The old campus of ZJU Med was just next to the famous West Lake, called Hubin Campus of Zhejiang University. The new or present medical campus is ZijinGang Campus, which is currently the main campus of Zhejiang University. Faculties In the past more than one hundred years, ZJU Med never stopped gathering magnificent masters and educating excellent medical talents. Up to now, the total number full-time professors has reached to 966 including 451 Ph.D supervisors, 1001 Master Degree supervisors. Among them there are 3 members of China Academy of Sciences, 4 members of China Academy of Engineering, 9 members of Cheung Kong Chair Professor, 43 State\\"1000-elite Program\\" Experts (including \\"1000 Young Talent Plan\\" Professors), and 14 winners of National Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar. The current Dean of ZJU Med is Duan Shumin. Currently, ZJU Med has accommodates a total of over 5,800 students, including 2500 undergraduates, 1700 Master's Candidates, 1500 Doctoral Candidates and 600 international students.  Education and Research  Zhejiang University School of Medicine has been pursuing high quality education and aiming at developing extraordinary medical practitioners. The school is composed of 5 major departments: Basic Medicine, Public Health, Clinical Medicine, Dental Medicine and Nursing. Apart from these academic departments, there are 7 affiliated teaching hospitals. Currently, ZJU Med has 4 national key disciplines, 45 national key clinical specialties, 1 national key laboratory, 23 provincial key laboratories and ‚ÄúMedical Technology and Diseases Prevention‚Äù 985 Technology Innovation Platform. Zhejiang University School of Medicine has a great platform for international cooperation and exchanges. It established collaboration with University of California, Los Angeles School of medicine in the field of talents education, faculty development, scientific research in Translational Medicine and other medical engineering areas. It also built wide collaboration with over 20 leading medical schools overseas including Columbia University, The University of Melbourne and University of Toronto. In the year of 2015, Zhejiang University and University of Edinburgh Joint Institute started to enroll students together in Haining Campus. In recent years, Zhejiang University School of Medicine leaped to the top rank among all medical schools in terms of research fundings and research output. Up to date, 19 programs have won National Science & Technology Awards including one special prize in 2017 (The oretical Innovation and Technological Breakthrough on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, including preventing and controlling the spread of the H7N9 bird flu virus led by Dr. Lanjuan Li)Ôºåone first prize in 2015 (The Innovation Group of Comprehensive Diagnosis and Treatment for End- Stage Liver Diseases led by Dr. Shusen Zheng and Dr. Lanjun Li) and one first prize in 2013 (The oretical Innovation and Technological Breakthrough on Diagnosis and Treatment of Severe Hepatic Diseases project led by Dr. Lanjuan Li).

Batonga‚Äôs goal is to go ‚Äúbeyond the paved road‚Äù by targeting the most excluded girls and equipping them with the knowledge and skills they need to live healthy, financially independent lives. Batonga‚Äôs data-driven approach allows them to target the hardest-to-reach girls, recruit them to the Girls Clubs, provide them a safe space to learn, convene, connect, and improve their livelihoods. In this, Batonga remains true to its core mission‚Äî to shine a light on the most overlooked girls in Francophone West Africa and empower them to be agents of change in their communities and their own lives. Mission The Batonga Foundation empowers the hardest-to-reach girls and women with the knowledge and skills necessary to become agents of change in their own lives and communities  Vision  Batonga envisions a safer, healthier and more equitable world in which all girls and women can thrive. History Growing up, Angelique Kidjo was one of few girls in Benin to receive an education. She invented the word ‚ÄúBatonga‚Äù as a joyfully defiant response to those who told her that girls did not belong in the classroom. Later, it would become the title of a hit song for the Grammy-winning singer/songwriter and the name of her non-profit organization. In 2006, Kidjo founded the Batonga Foundation with the goal of empowering and educating adolescent girls in sub-Saharan Africa. Batonga has since provided girls in five African countries (Mali, Benin, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, and Cameroon) with 5,000 academic years of education through scholarships and in-kind support, supplied 8,727 students access to wells and latrines across 7 schools in Benin, and offered 222,000 students in Benin‚Äôs poorest regions TOMS shoes for the walk to school. In 2015 and 2016, under the guidance of the intentional design team at Population Council, Batonga began to shift away from the scholarship model and formal education initiatives that tended to leave behind society‚Äôs most vulnerable. Batonga began instead focusing on innovative education programs geared toward the most excluded young women and girls. Today, Batonga focuses primarily on providing girls with safe spaces and mentors, equipping them with life and financial literacy skills, and helping them start small businesses.

An improvised explosive device which he was investigating exploded injuring Lockett and two other soldiers. Lockett died before he reached hospital. In June 2008 Lockett was presented the Military Cross by Queen Elizabeth II, for his efforts in an attempt to recover the bodies of Pte. Johan Botha and Sgt. Craig Brelsford, as well as successfully rescuing four other injured soldiers. He is the first soldier to die on operations who has been awarded the Military Cross since World War II. Early life Lockett studied at Longcroft School in Beverley. He had spent the majority of his career as a machine gunner, when, in 1996, he joined the 1st Battalion of the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment in Tidworth Camp. At this time he held many qualifications, such as the Jungle Warfare Instructor and Military Tracking Instructor. Military Cross While fighting in Afghanistan during Operation Herrick VI in September 2007, Lockett, then a corporal, and the rest of his unit, were commanded to penetrate enemy lines, and ruin their posts. The soldiers dubbed the mission 'Operation Certain Death', but carried it out nonetheless. However, they were ambushed by Taliban troops. The ambush caused the death of Private Johan Botha and Sergeant Craig Brelsford, as well as inflicting injuries on four other soldiers. Michael led the remaining soldiers in an attempt to retrieve the bodies, and rescue the four injured soldiers. For his \\"leadership, command, control and supreme courage\\", Lockett was awarded the Military Cross on 7 March 2008, which he later received from Queen Elizabeth II. Death At the time of his death on 21 September 2009, Lockett was working with the Afghan National Army, at Patrol Base Sandford. He had volunteered to stay at the base because new soldiers were due to arrive, and he wanted to ensure they knew as much about the local area as possible. He was investigating an improvised explosive device, when it detonated, killing him, and injuring two nearby soldiers. As well as being the 217th British soldier to die in Afghanistan since October 2001, he is the first soldier who has been awarded the Military Cross to later die there. Memorial and tribute Lockett's body was flown back to Britain on 29 September, where hundreds filled the streets to pay tribute to him. Lockett's school friends Kate Atkinson, Rochelle Booth, Kelly Jackson and Rebecca Knowles started up The Lockett Fund, which has raised hundreds of pounds for the charity Help for Heroes.

He was reelected in 2007, then in 2011 made an unsuccessful bid for governor of the state. Senator Joel Danlami Ikenya was nominated as a ministerial nominee to replace Darius Ishaku who resigned to contest for the Governorship election in Taraba State. In January, he was appointed the Minister of Labour and Productivity till May 2015. Background Joel Danlami Ikenya was born on 17 July 1962. He has an Advanced Diploma in Public Administration, and was an Undergraduate (Business Administration), at the Federal University of Technology, Yola in Adamawa State. He was a member of the Taraba State House of Assembly from 1992‚Äì1993, and again from 1999‚Äì2003. Was a member Federal House Of Representative from 2003- 2007 Senate career Joel Danlami Ikenya was elected to the National Senate for the Taraba South constituency in 2007 and He was appointed Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, and also sat on the Senate Committee on Appropriation from 2007- 2011 In May 2008, Senator Ikenya was appointed to the Senate committee to review the amendment of the 1999 constitution. Sports In December 2007, Ikenya was appointed to a four- man panel set up by Senator Heineken Lokpobiri's Committee on Sports to take action in a crisis that was then rocking Nigerian football. As a member of the sports committee, he blamed the Nigeria Football Federations for \\"ineptitude, corruption, inefficiency and total incompetence\\". He also accused the federal government of wasting N1.24 billion on a bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games, saying the money would have been better used in building sports facilities. Political disputes In June 2008, Senator Ikenya stated that President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua had not been prepared for the job when he was hurriedly pushed forward by former president Olusegun Obasanjo, but expressed confidence that Yar'Adua would find his feet. In December 2008, after the controversial dismissal of Nuhu Ribadu, former Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, from the police, Ikenya said the decision was correct because Ribadu had let himself be used to track down opponents of former President Olusegun Obasanjo. In August 2009, he was invited to a meeting to try to resolve a political feud between the former governor of Taraba State, Reverend Jolly Nyame, and his successor Danbaba Suntai. Senator Ikenya was said to be a supporter of Nyame. Trade In March 2008, Ikenya called on the Ghanaian government to reopen shops owned by Nigerian businessmen, citing the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) free trade zone agreement. In May 2008, he was among those who rejected a proposal to appropriate N80 billion for import of rice, saying the money should be spent on agricultural improvement, and that Nigeria should learn from countries which were turning deserts to green areas. In November 2008, he blamed the Nigerian Customs Service, Immigration Service and Nigeria Police Force for allowing counterfeit goods into the country, saying this had caused retrenchment of 75 per cent of workers in the manufacturing sector. In May 2009, he said Nigeria would not be rushed into signing the Economic Partnership Agreement aimed to liberalise trade between Africa and the European Union (EU), seeing a risk that they would flood the market with imports and destroy local businesses. Finance and regulation In June 2008 he was among those who successfully opposed introduction of a bill sponsored by Senator Iyabo Obasanjo-Bello for an act to establish the excess Crude Oil Fund, which would create an investment vehicle to bolster the country's financial strength in the future. In June 2009, Senator Joel Danlami Ikenya urged stakeholders in the financial reporting sector to support the proposed Financial Reporting Council (FRC) Bill, which he said would improve accounting standards in the private and public sectors, and thus encourage investment. In September 2009, he said he fully supported the Corporate Affairs Commission in its efforts to build zonal offices in all the states of the federation, rather than using rental premises.

Aldershot: Gale & Polden. Early history The regiment was raised during the upheaval of the Indian Mutiny, by Lieutenant EH Longmore at Allahabad on 23 December 1857, as the Allahabad Levy. The regiment took part in the Third Anglo-Burmese War of 1885‚Äì87. 33rd Punjabis Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, the regiment's designation was changed to 33rd Punjabis. During the First World War, the 33rd Punjabis served in Egypt, France, Aden and German East Africa. In 1917, the regiment raised a second battalion, which was disbanded after the war. In 1919, the 33rd Punjabis participated in the Third Afghan War. Subsequent history In 1921‚Äì22, a major reorganization was undertaken in the British Indian Army leading to the formation of large infantry groups of four to six battalions. Among these was the 16th Punjab Regiment, formed by grouping the 33rd Punjabis with the 30th, 31st and 46th Punjabis, and the 9th Bhopal Infantry. The battalion's new designation was 3rd Battalion 16th Punjab Regiment. During the Second World War, the battalion fought in the Malayan Campaign and was taken prisoner by the Japanese on Singapore Island following the British surrender on 15 February 1942. It was re-raised in 1946. In 1947, the 16th Punjab Regiment was allocated to Pakistan Army. In 1956, it was merged with the 1st, 14th and 15th Punjab Regiments to form one large Punjab Regiment, and 3/16th Punjab was redesignated as 15 Punjab. In 1948, the battalion fought in the war with India in Kashmir, while during the 1965 Indo- Pakistan War, it fought at the Rann of Kutch and Chhamb-Jaurian.

He was also an accomplished artist. Life Yew was born in Fuzhou, China in 1898,s appointed an MBE in 1955 forng. Scouting Yew was a Scout leader in Fuzhou from 1919-1923. In 1923 he received his warrant (formal appointment) and after moving to North Borneo he joined the 1st Sandakan Scout Troop as a Scout leader under Reverend Thomas Cecil Alexander, who had founded Scouting in North Borneo in 1913.http://www.sabah.gov.my/events/2007Sunrise/Article.pdf In 1930 Yew formed the first Wolf Cub Pack in 1930 at St. Michael's Church, Sandakan. North Borneo's first official camping ground for Scouts was opened at Lok Kawi Scout Camping Ground in 1935, and the next year Yew brought 30 Sandakan Scouts there - a significant journey at the time - to camp. After the disruption to Scouting caused by the Japanese invasion of Borneo during the Second World War, Yew revitalised the Troop at All Saint's Church, Jesselton. He was appointed as West Coast District Commissioner in 1950 and travelled extensively visiting troops across this large and predominantly jungle district. He published a district magazine Scouting in Picture and introduced the Scouting Job Week, similar to the British Scouts' \\"Bob-a-job Week\\". Yew was awarded a Medal of Merit in 1939. In recognition of his services to Scouting in North Borneo, he was awarded a Silver Acorn in 1953 by the then- Chief Scout of the British Commonwealth and Empire, Lord Rowallan, and two years later he was appointed a MBE by Queen Elizabeth. He was also appointed Datuk, a title roughly equivalent to a knighthood, after the independence of Sabah. Yew retired from Scouting in 1959, but continued to serve on the Local Association, West Coast Council as a Lay member, and was made Honorary Commissioner. In 1963 he received a Silver Wolf award from the then Chief Scout Sir Charles Maclean.

Released for desktop web browsers and devices using iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry 10 operating systems, the game requires players to route a supply of water to an alligator. Where's My Water? has been praised for its gameplay and its graphical style, with special recognition of its lead character, Swampy, the first original Disney character for a mobile game, voiced by actor, Justin T. Bowler. The game has inspired multiple spin-offs including: Where's My Perry?, Where's My Mickey?,Marc Graser. Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄòWhere‚Äôs My Mickey?‚Äô is Newest Spin-off of ‚ÄòWhere‚Äôs My Water?‚Äô Franchise. June 18, 2013. Variety. Accessed June 18, 2013. Where's My Water? featuring XYY and Where's My Valentine?. This game was also released on Microsoft Windows im 2011. More mobile versions continued to be released through 2013. In September 2013, a sequel titled Where's My Water? 2 was released. Gameplay Swampy, an alligator living in a city sewer system, hates being dirty, but whenever he tries to take a bath, Cranky, another alligator living in the sewers, disrupts the water flow to Swampy's home. Located somewhere on the level is a supply of water, either a finite amount pooled at various locations or an infinite amount flowing from a pipe. Players use the touch screen on their device to dig through the dirt and redirect the water towards an inlet leading to Swampy's bathtub. Occasionally, the water must be routed through other pipes or must interact with machines in order to open up a route to the inlet. When the required amount of water reaches the bathtub, the level is completed and the next level is unlocked. If all of the water flows away the player loses the level. Also scattered around the level are three rubber ducks that can be collected when they absorb an amount of water. Select levels also include items hidden in the dirt that will unlock bonus levels when three-item collections are completed. Certain levels are also populated by hazards that must be avoided or removed. For example, some levels contain algae that will absorb water and grow. Other types of fluids will sometimes appear, such as purple poison, reddish mud, and green ooze. A single drop of poison will contaminate pure water, turning it into poison as well, while the ooze will erode through the dirt, pop balloons, and react with water, destroying both fluids. Mud eventually hardens into dirt, unless water reaches it, in which case the water turns to mud instantly. If either poison, ooze or mud reaches the inlet, the level will be lost and will automatically restart. The first fluid is water, the second fluid is poison, the third fluid is ooze, the fourth fluid is steam and the fifth fluid is mud. And also, bombs will kill all the rubber ducks on contact (regular water kills Cranky Ducks, both poison kills Allie Ducks and Swampy Ducks) . However, poison and ooze will also destroy the invasive algae on contact. The poison will eliminate it, while the ooze will cause it to solidify, creating a new barrier‚Äîand they will react explosively if they touch each other, potentially opening up parts of the level to the benefit or detriment of the player. Points are awarded for the amount of time taken to complete the level, for collecting rubber ducks, and for delivering more than the minimum amount of water to Swampy's tub. Collecting a certain number of rubber ducks will also unlock new groups of levels. Development Where's My Water? was developed by Creature Feep, a team of designers within the Disney Mobile division of Disney Interactive Studios. Creature Feep is headed up by game design director Tim FitzRandolph, whose earlier works included the popular game JellyCar that Disney would later acquire and distribute. In an October 2011 interview, FitzRandolph explained that the goal for the development of Where's My Water? was \\"to contribute a new character to the company, while making a really fun game in the process\\". The earliest phase of development centered around the concept of the game, which was players using their fingers to guide water to a goal. According to FitzRandolph, \\"We had a whole bunch of ideas, and at some point along the line, it kept coming back that water, water was very fresh and people hadn't done a lot of physics around water.\\" Designers invested time in making sure the water flowed naturally and as a player might expect it would in real life, thus making the gameplay easier to learn for newcomers. In actuality, the water is rendered as many individual \\"drops\\" that interact with each other. The place players were routing water towards became a bathtub, at which point the designers had to devise a reason for having a bathtub underground. That reason came from the urban legend of alligators living in city sewers, so the game's lead character became a \\"hygiene-conscious alligator\\". Unlike many mobile games released by Disney, where characters from the company's films are used, Where's My Water? represents the first time that Disney has produced an original character for a mobile game. In designing that character, Disney Mobile wanted one \\"that felt like it belonged when lined up with other Disney characters\\". Release Where's My Water? was launched with four chapters - \\"Meet Swampy\\", \\"Troubled Waters\\", \\"Under Pressure\\" and \\"Sink or Swim\\" ‚Äî each containing 20 levels. New chapters are rolled out with updates, each featuring new gameplay mechanics. An October 2011 update added \\"Change is Good\\", a 20-level expansion that added the ability to change fluid types from one to another in order to complete levels. \\"Boiling Point\\", the game's sixth 20-level chapter, was released in a November 2011 update and included levels where players must convert steam into liquid water. A version for devices equipped with the Android operating system was released on the Android Market in North America on November 23, 2011 and included all six chapters available up to that point. In December 2011, \\"Stretched Thin\\" was released to both platforms, adding 20 new levels, a Christmas overlay for the title screen and new water balloon obstacles. A free, ad-supported version of Where's My Water? was also released to both iOS and Android in December 2011. The free version includes 25 unique levels, plus the ability to unlock five popular levels taken from the main game. \\"Caution to the Wind\\", a new 20-level chapter, was launched in March 2012, adding fans and vacuums that move water and other game elements around the level. In April 2012, \\"Rising Tide\\" was added, which introduced valves that can redirect water and the other fluids as needed to complete the chapter's 20 levels. In May 2012, a total of 20 levels that originally appeared in the free version were added to the full version, collectively known as \\"The Lost Levels\\". The levels in question are grouped into two holiday-themed chapters, \\"10 Days of Swampy\\" (Christmas) and \\"Hearts and Crafts\\" (Valentine's Day). June 2012 saw the release of \\"Out to Dry\\", which included levels involving wet mud that sets into dirt. The update also included two new in-app purchases: the \\"Mystery Duck\\" mode (see below) and Locksmith Duck, which would unlock a chapter without having to collect a certain number of ducks within the main game. In connection, Where's My Perry, a version of the game featuring Perry the Platypus from Phineas and Ferb, was released the same day as the \\"Out to Dry\\" update. On September 19, 2012, a new update brought a special Birthday Level, \\"Make a Wish\\", to Where's My Water and Swampy's 1 Year Birthday. 10 more Lost Levels were also added for free. An infographic of Where's my Water's history teased a new update with a black- and-white and Frankenweenie-based levels. Cranky's Story In January 2012, \\"Cranky's Story\\", a new subset of levels within the game, was added initially to the iOS version and later to the Android version. The gameplay in \\"Cranky's Story\\" is basically the same as the main game, in that players must route a fluid to an inlet goal. However, this time the player must help Cranky by bringing the purple poisonous water into his lair to melt algae that is covering his food. This time, the ducks are now purple and can only be collected by being splashed with poison, while other fluids (including clean water) will kill it. If water or any of the other fluids enter the inlet, the level is failed (the water causes Cranky's food to be covered with more algae, surprising him, while ooze will turn it into a rock and being kicked away, the same is true with mud). If all of the poison is lost, then Cranky will get very angry. The first five levels in the first chapter, \\"Cranky's First Course\\", are free to play, while the rest of the chapter and the whole the second chapter, \\"Hunger Pains\\", are accessible through a one-time in-app purchase. The update also includes \\"Cranky's Challenge\\", a set of 12 challenges and four bonus stages for the player to accomplish. If those challenges are failed, then Swampy will cry as if you lost all the water. An all new Food Groups and the third episode \\"Bulking Up\\" were released on April 5, 2012 and adds 6 challenges and two bonus stages. The final episode, \\"Overstuffed\\", was released on May 18, 2012. Cranky is also voiced by Justin T. Bowler. Mystery Duck In June 2012, a new game mode called \\"Mystery Duck\\" was introduced. It is a revisit of previous levels from the main game except the player has to deal three special kinds of ducks. They are the MegaDuck, a large duck that requires a large amount of water to fill; Ducklings, a group of 10 tiny ducks (which can easily be filled with a drop of water); and the tuxedo-clad Mystery Duck, which goes around an entire level either by disappearing and reappearing in certain spots or physically moving up and down and side to side. Like \\"Cranky's Story\\", a one-time in-app purchase was required to play beyond the first five levels. On September 19, as part of the Birthday update, 40 more levels were added to Mystery Duck. On October 30, as part of the release of Swampy's Underground adventures, 20 more levels were added to Mystery duck. On November 15, as part of the levels of the week, the last 40 levels were added to Mystery Duck. Allie's Story In May 2013, a new subset of levels called \\"Allie's Story\\" was added in a May 25 update, Allie is Swampy's girlfriend. The gameplay in this mode is the same as the other modes, but this time, it requires players to direct steam to operate Allie's makeshift pipe organ. Ducks are blue and can only be covered in steam, while other fluids (except clean water) will kill them. If water or other fluids get in the inlet, the level is failed. So far, only two episodes in this mode, \\"Warming Up\\" and \\"Tuning In\\" were available in the update. The last two chapters \\"Rising to the Top\\" and \\"Symphony in Steam\\" were added on September 11, 2013. As with Cranky's Story and Mystery Duck, a one-time in-app purchase is required to play beyond the first five levels. Allie is voiced by Rebecca Metz Spin-offs Disney has released several spin-off games under the Where's My moniker. They include: *Where's My Perry? is a game starring Perry the Platypus from Phineas and Ferb who 'needs' water to enter in the O.W.C.A. HQ. *Where's My Mickey? (released June 19, 2013) is a game starring Mickey Mouse (as seen in the Disney Channel shorts) who 'needs' water. *Where's My Valentine? (released February 1, 2013) is a game starring Swampy and Perry. *Where's My Holiday? (December 1, 2012 - January 21, 2013) was another game starring Swampy and Perry. It also contained the old version of Where's My Valentine?. *Where's My Summer? is a game starring Perry. *Where's My Water? featuring XYY (April 2014) stars the popular Chinese cartoon character Pleasant Goat. The game was retired on August 29, 2014. Reception Where's My Water? has received universal acclaim from critics. Mike Thompson of Gamezebo said \\"anyone who enjoys physics puzzle titles would be out of their mind to miss picking this up\\". IGN's Justin Davis said players \\"will have a ton of fun figuring out how to get Swampy clean level after level\\". Chris Reed, writing for Slide To Play, called the game \\"a highly polished and appealing physics puzzler that nearly everyone can enjoy\\". Along with the gameplay, reviewers have made special mention of the game's graphical presentation. Gamezebo said the graphics \\"are particularly great, featuring crisp and cartoon-like visuals that look like something out of ... well, out of a Disney cartoon\\", and IGN said that Swampy \\"animates wonderfully and always appears incredibly adorable\\". Pocket Gamer's Steve McCaskill praised its visual design, stating that it gave \\"the impression of an interactive cartoon\\". After only one day on Apple's U.S. App Store, Where's My Water? ascended to the top of the list of paid apps, surpassing Angry Birds. In its first month of release, Where's My Water? was downloaded more than one million times. The game remained on top of the App Store charts for three weeks, and it has also reached #1 on App Stores in 30 other countries. In March 2012, Apple announced that a copy of the free version of Where's My Water?, downloaded by a user from China, was the 25 billionth application downloaded from the App Store. During WWDC 2012, the app was awarded a 2012 \\"Apple Design Award\\" for iPhone apps. Impact The popularity of Where's My Water?, and of Swampy in particular, has led Disney to develop a web series based on Swampy and other characters introduced in the game's cutscenes, including Allie, a female alligator who is the object of both Swampy's and Cranky's affection. Where's My Water?: Swampy's Underground Adventures debuted with a teaser August 31, 2012 on the Disney.com website and will feature a 12-episode season, with each episode running around two minutes. The series is animated by Animax Entertainment. According to Mark Walker, the senior vice-president of Disney.com, the series will \\"build out the world and tell Swampy's story and that of other characters\\". Fluids Water Water is the first fluid that you can see in the game. Water approaching algae will cause more algae to grow. Poison Water Poison Water dubbed ‚ÄúPurple Water‚Äù by the fan- community. It is the second fluid to meet throughout the game. Any amount of poison approaching water will cause the water to become poison. Poison also removes algae. Ooze Ooze is the third fluid. It slowly dissolves dirt. Approaching with water will cause both fluids to dissolve. Approaching algae will transform the algae into stone. Mixing with poison will cause an explosion. Steam Steam is the fourth fluid. Unlike the other fluids, steam floats upwards instead of falling. Mud Mud is the fifth fluid. It gradually dries itself into dirt. Dry mud can be changed to wet mud by adding water or poison. However, dirt cannot be changed back to mud.

From 1921 to 1924, they played in the Southwestern League, and in 1925 they played in the Western Association. They played in the Western Association from 1928 to 1932 as well. The 1921 Producers were recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time. Perhaps their most notable alumnus was Cy Blanton.Cy Blanton statistics Glenn Wright, another notable Producer, made an unassisted triple play when playing Major League Baseball in 1925. History According to a historical marker, the first night game in organized baseball was played in Independence on April 28, 1930, between the Independence Producers and the Muskogee Chiefs. Since there are some people that are not familiar with the term Organized Baseball, it is important to explain the term. It is a specific group of baseball teams, those that are part of Major League Baseball, and the minor league teams associated with Major League Baseball. Organized Baseball games must follow specific rules in order to be Organized Baseball games. The commissioner of Baseball has authority over Organized Baseball. An Organized Baseball game is an official Organized Baseball game. Prior to Independence playing night baseball, there was a baseball game played at night in 1880. It was an experimental game between two department store teams, and it would take another fifty years before Organized Baseball would sanction night baseball. There were a couple of exhibition night baseball games in the early 1900s between Organized Baseball teams. One was in 1909, and the other in 1927, but the games did not count in league standings. In 1929, the president of the Des Moines, Iowa baseball club announced to the National Association convention his intent to play night baseball in 1930. However, the first official minor league game actually took place in Independence, Kansas on April 28, 1930. There was also a novel, incomplete night baseball game on July 4, 1896 between the Wilmington, Delaware and Paterson, New Jersey clubs. Doc Amole pitched an explosive device instead of a baseball to Honus Wagner, which exploded when Wagner hit it. That ended the game in the sixth inning, with many fans demanding their money back. It was an exhibition game played during the regular season, and the firecracker pitched to Wagner ended the game after it went off. An article in the April 1931 edition of Baseball Magazine stated that Independence was the first team in America to play a league night baseball game. In addition to that, in 1935, The Sporting News pointed out that Des Moines was not the first to install permanent lights, but it was in fact Independence that did so. The Independence Producers were a Class C minor league baseball team. They had purchased lights from the Giant Manufacturing Company and installed them on light towers constructed on their field, making Independence the birthplace of professional night baseball. By the end of the 1930 season there were thirty-eight minor league teams with lights installed on their fields. Independence was not the first team to play night baseball, or the first professional team to play night baseball. Independence was the first to play an official minor league or major league night baseball game, and they were also the first minor or major league team to install permanent lights on their field. There are many stories about the night baseball game in Independence. Some claim the lights used were portable, temporary, or borrowed. What Larry Bowman did differently in his research was to look at the actual historic documents for his sources. Bowman found the 1930 newspapers documented the planning, purchasing, construction, and game information as it played out at the time. Many more historic documents and photos are referenced in the National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for the baseball stadium. All fifty-five night baseball games played in Independence in 1930 were documented at the time. Bob Rives, in his research article, states that Independence \\"was the world leader in baseball field lighting\\". Rives also mentioned that the pitcher for the Producers made the first pitch ever under the lights in a regular season Organized Baseball game. Jan Sumner stated that \\"The first night baseball game in Organized Baseball took place in Independence on the night of April 28, 1930\\". Sumner visited Independence in 2014 for researching his planned book. He said the lights Independence used were permanent lights, and they played fifty-five night baseball games at home in 1930. Sumner adds that Organized Baseball is Major League Baseball and the minor leagues. The National Baseball Hall of Fame has recognized Independence as playing the first night game in the history of Organized Baseball. The Smithsonian displays an art gallery label that gives credit to Independence for playing the first official minor league at night. There have even been newspapers, like the Chicago Tribune, that have stated that Independence played the first Organized Baseball game under lights. The Sporting News disputes this claim, citing earlier professional examples going back to an 1896 game in which Honus Wagner played. It is, however, true that in 1930 Negro league teams, including the Independence Producers, were carrying portable light setups with them and playing night games on a regular basis.

Bauer (born February 22, 1952) is an American attorney who previously served as White House Counsel under President Barack Obama. Early life and education Bauer was raised in a Jewish family and graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1970, from Harvard College in 1973, and received his J.D. degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1976. White House Counsel In November 2009, he was named to be the next White House Counsel, upon the resignation of Gregory Craig. Bauer was President Obama's personal attorney and the general counsel of the Obama for America presidential campaign prior to his appointment as White House Counsel. He has also previously served as the general counsel to the Democratic National Committee, and had advised President Obama since Mr. Obama came to Washington, D.C. in 2005 as U. S. Senator. As general counsel for the 2008 campaign, Bauer asked the Justice Department to investigate the officers and donors of American Issues Project after it ran a negative ad about Obama. On Thursday, June 2, 2011, the White House Press Office stated that Bauer would be returning to private practice at Perkins Coie, and that Principal Deputy Counsel to the President Kathryn Ruemmler (his deputy, in that office since January 2010 and before that since January 2009 as Principal Associate Deputy U.S. Attorney General) would succeed him. The position, because it is part of the Executive Office staff that personally advises the President and is not an agency or Cabinet department or military head, does not require Senate confirmation despite the prominence of the office. Bauer returned to private practice to again represent the president's election team and the Democratic National Committee. \\"Bob was a critical member of the White House team,\\" Mr. Obama said. \\"He has exceptional judgment, wisdom, and intellect, and he will continue to be one of my close advisers.\\" Obama chose Bauer and Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a Republican, in 2013 to co-chair the Presidential Commission on Election Administration, a yearlong investigation into voting problems. Their findings, \\"The American Voting Experience: Report and Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on Election Administration,\\" were published in 2014. Current career Bauer currently serves as Professor of the Practice and Distinguished Scholar in Residence at NYU School of Law. He teaches classes including \\"The Role of the Lawyer in Public Life\\" and \\"Political Reform\\". In April 2020, it was announced that Bauer will assist with vetting efforts for the selection of Joe Biden's running mate in the 2020 presidential election.

Lecesne was on a committee to improve the rights of free men of colour. He was arrested twice, and transported for life from Jamaica with John Escoffery. Their case was taken up by Dr. Stephen Lushington. Lecesne was compensated after successfully having the case reversed by the British government.Seizure and Imprisonment in Jamaica‚Äî Petition of L.C.Lecesne and J.Escoffery, Hansard, 21 May 1824, vol. 11 cc796-804, accessed 9 October 2008. Lecesne became an activist against slavery and attended the world's first anti-slavery convention.The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840, Benjamin Robert Haydon, 1841, National Portrait Gallery, London, NPG599, Given by British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society in 1880. He named his son after the British Member of Parliament who had fought for his case. Lecesne was a supporter when the 1839 Anti-Slavery Society was formed. Disputed birth Lecesne was the son of Charlotte Celeste and Louis Nicholas Lecesne, and was born in either Port au Prince or Kingston in 1796 or 1798. His mother and father had arrived in Jamaica on 25 August 1798 with a child called Figge. Lecesne's father was French and had left St Domingo, whilst his mother was said to have African ancestry. According to some, his mother was pregnant, Figge died and Louis was born. The Jamaican authorities believed however that Louis was the child who arrived on the brig Mary with his mother. Lecesne's date of birth was given as 30 August 1798 in Kingston, but he wasn't baptised until 5 March 1814. His place and date of birth were the subject of later court cases. At these cases it was noted that Lecesne's mother and the midwife said that he was born a few months (or days) after their arrival in Jamaica.Letter to the Right Honorable Sir George Murray Relative to the Deportation of Lecesne and Escoffery from Jamaica, William Burge, 1829, accessed 8 October 2008 Others disagree with this version as his mother said that when they arrived in Jamaica they did have a two-year-old child but he died just after the birth of this child. Lecesne had two younger brothers Lamorette and Louis Nicholas Lecesne. His mother was manumised by Lescesne's father. The date of the birth was important as a later law gave privileges to children born on the island. He was taken to Mr Goff's school for \\"children of colour\\" in 1802 when his father asked for him to be given \\"the best English education\\". Mr Goffe signed an affidavit later to say that he thought Lecesne to be four years old at the time but others think this a very young age to send such a child to school in Jamaica. Others said that when Charlotte Celeste arrived she had a two-year-old son called Figge. They claim Lecesne was born in Port a Prince in St Domingo \\"opposite the post office\\". When his father made a will and died in 1816 he made Lecesne his executor. Some claim that this means that his father knew he was 21 years of age, and therefore born before elsewhere. Marriage Louis Celeste Lecesne married Hannah Escoffery (born 15 November 1797 and also known as Anette), the sister of John Escoffery.Various Escoffery family reports, from Anglican and Roman Catholic RegistersB0089 Kingston Anglican Parish Registers VI and Burials I & II, II, p. 281, Name listed as \\"Jane M.\\" in Registrar's Copy Register. At least three children were born to Louis Celeste Lecesne and Hannah Escoffery in Kingston. The first was Louise Amelia Lecesne (born 20 June 1817), followed by Elizabeth Adeline Lecesne (born 24 July 1818) and Celestine Agla√© Lecesne (19 June 1820 ‚Äì 11 August 1821).B0089 Kingston Anglican Parish Registers VI and Burials I & II, II, p. 405. On 7 May 1823 Louis Celeste Lecesne was a witness to the marriage of his wife's brother, Edward Escoffery to Marie Montagnac in the Roman Catholic Church, Kingston.B0064 Roman Catholic Marriages 1802-1839, pp. 83-84. Lecesne and John Escoffery came to notice as members of a committee who were intent on changing the law such that free men \\"of colour\\" would be given free and equal rights to white people. Arrest Louis Celeste Lecesne and John Escoffery were arrested on 7 October 1823 under the Alien Act by a warrant of the Duke of Manchester, the Governor of Jamaica. William Burge, the Attorney General, considered them to be of \\"dangerous character\\"; they were also considered to be aliens, because of claims that they were Haitian. Luckily they had time to raise a writ of Habeas Corpus in the Supreme Court of JamaicaThe Anti-slavery Reporter, Zachary Macaulay, Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery, pp. 27-31,accessed 12 October 2008 While Lecesne and Escoffery were held in gaol, petitions made to the Governor were rejected as it was claimed that the signatories were all owed money by the accused. Later investigations showed that the largest debt involved was 25 pounds. After consideration by the judges, the two were released as they were considered to be British-born despite the arguments described earlier. Chief Justice Scarlett released them without bail as there were no charges.Monthly Comments, Jamaica , Ansell Hart, Volume 5. (August 1962 ‚Äì July 1964), accessed September 2009 Barnet Burns - Portrait in later life (after Burns returned (tattooed) from New Zealand). Later, a member of the House of Representatives moved that a secret committee be formed to look at this case. This man, Hector Mitchell, was made the chair of this committee, comprising three others including the Mayor of Kingston. Their investigations resulted in the forced exile of Lecesne and Escoffery to St Domingo. It had been said that Lecesne had sold arms to an insurrection in St George and that the two of them kept correspondence with people in Haiti for treasonable purposes. Having been separated from their families and possessions, the pair had to sell their watches and with this money and the help of British people on the island they set out for England. With Lecesne and Escoffery deported, the free coloureds movement did not collapse in Jamaica. Instead, other campaigners, such as Edward Jordon, Robert Osborn (Jamaica), and Richard Hill (Jamaica) continued to agitate for equal rights for free coloureds, and they were finally successful when the Jamaican Assembly passed legislation allowing them to vote in elections and run for public office.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 183. A young English sailor boy, Barnet Burns, had been found ill in Jamaica and was cared for by Lecesne and his family. Following the deportation of Lecesne, Burns followed Lecesne's family to London, where he received an education under the patronage of Lecesne.Barnet Burns, Dictionary of New Zealand Biography, accessed 25 January 2009. England The case of Lecesne and Escoffery was raised in the House of Commons by Stephen Lushington who was a known abolitionist and anti-slavery campaigner. Lushington spoke to the house on 16 June 1825. This resulted in a number of publications: #Debate in house of commons 16 June 1825 regarding deportation of two persons of colour Bibliographia Jamaicensis, by Institute of Jamaica Library, Frank Cundall #A Reply to the Speech of Dr. Lushington, in the House of Commons by Mr Barret of the House in Jamaica, 1828A Reply to the Speech of Dr. Lushington, in the House of Commons on the state of the people of Jamaica, by Mr Barret of the House in Jamaica, 1828. There was a libel case against John Murray, not because he was the author, but because he was the publisher of a book that libelled Lecesne and Escoffery.Full text of \\"Report of the trial of Mr. John Murray: in the Court of King's Bench, at Westminster- Hall, the 19th December, 1829, on an indictment for a libel of Messrs. Lecesne and Escoffery, of Jamaica\\" , archive.org, accessed 11 October 2008. The case was based on the fact that the book recorded that the politicians in Jamaica considered Lecesne and Escoffery guilty of a criminal conspiracy. This case was held in Britain in order that it should not be biased. If they were guilty of a conspiracy, then under the 1818 Alien Act they could be transported for life if they were born elsewhere. The book concerned was \\"The annals of Jamaica, Volume 2\\" by the Reverend George Wilson Bridges. Bridges combined leading worship at St Annes and speaking up for the value of slavery.The annals of Jamaica, Volume 2, George Wilson Bridges, Pub. John Murray (III), accessed September 2009 The libel case was successful and Lecesne was therefore innocent. Parliament ruled that they should both be allowed to return and be given compensation. Lecesne believed in the law. In 1832, Lecesne was living in England at the Fenchurch buildings in Fenchurch Street, London and on 26 June while walking outside his residence Lecesne was the victim of a pickpocket, Thomas Fielder, who had stolen a handkerchief. For this crime, Fielder, aged 15, was sentenced to transportation for life.Proceedings of the Old Bailey, Thomas Fielder, Theft, pocketpicking, 5 July 1832, Reference Number t18320705-19, www.oldbaileyonline.org, accessed 7 September 2009.

Louis Celeste Lecesne and his wife had a son whilst they were in London whom they christened Stephen Lushington Macauley Lecesne. He was born on 6 March 1834 and was christened at Saint Matthew Church, Bethnal Green, London, on 25 June 1834.Birth record of Stephen Lecesne, FamilySearch.org, accessed 1 October 2008.

First conceived in November 1970, the Sunrise first flew on 4 November 1974 from Bicycle Lake, a dry lakebed on the Fort Irwin Military Reservation, California, United States. The first prototype was destroyed on its 28th flight by turbulence. The improved Sunrise II flew the following year. Development While working as an engineer at Hughes Aircraft, Roland Boucher began design work on an electric-powered aircraft concept in November 1970, calculating that the contemporary nickel-cadmium batteries available would be sufficient to sustain flight using a radio-control model glider. Early experimental projects proved the concept sound and in 1973 Boucher turned his attention to the creation of a high-altitude solar-powered aircraft that would have unlimited endurance. Boucher explained the project to his superiors at Hughes Aircraft in 1972 and after reviewing it, the company released the project to Boucher in 1973. Boucher took a leave of absence from Hughes to pursue the project and joined his brother, Bob Boucher, at AstroFlight, a small model airplane manufacturer in Venice, California. After successfully flying an electric drone carrying a payload on a DARPA project for Northrop Corporation, they then moved onto Project Sunrise. Using commercially available off-the-shelf solar cells producing only 10% efficiency, Boucher calculated that his project would need to be able to fly on about . The aircraft was envisioned as an unmanned sailplane that would have an operating altitude of , powered by a single Samarium‚Äìcobalt magnet electric motor, the first motor of its kind in the world. The aircraft would use no batteries and, instead, would descend at night from its operating altitude to about at dawn, before solar energy was once again available for climb. Boucher saw the Sunrise as a proof of concept for a follow on aircraft that would be capable of remaining aloft for months at an altitude of . Project Sunrise was funded by DARPA commencing in January 1974 and administered by Lockheed Aircraft Corporation of Sunnyvale, California, with the contract specifying a \\"proof of concept aircraft powered solely by incident sunlight on the wing surfaces.\\" Roland Boucher took on the task of the structural design, aerodynamics, telemetry, control and navigation. He also designed the integration of the solar panel, electric motors, gearbox and the propeller. He selected an Eppler 387 airfoil for the wing. The solar cells were round commercial units provided by Heliotech. The actual airframe was constructed by a team under expert model builder Phil Bernhardt. The Sunrise's wing span was and the aircraft had a gross weight of . The wing loading was a very low 4 ounces per square foot (0.011 kg/sq m). The aircraft structure was built from spruce, balsa and maple. Due to their roughness the solar cells were only mounted on the aft two-thirds of the wing's upper surface. The wing spars were built from spruce spar caps with maple doublers at all attachment points and two balsa shear webs attached to balsa strips on the wing spars. The ribs were made from balsa. This construction resulted in a balsa spar box with tapered spruce caps. The leading edge was covered with balsa to form a leading edge D spar. The trailing edge was formed by two wide sheets forming a triangle with vertical spar sections in between the ribs. The covering was 1/2 mil Mylar. The span wing weighed and was capable of loads up to 100 pounds. Control was via an S & O Radio designed and built telemetry transmitter and receiver. The standard S&O; six channel radio had channels for elevator, rudder, motor on and off and solar cell operating mode. The solar cells could be set for either series or parallel operation. The telemetry functions provided gave data on motor current, motor voltage, motor RPM, airspeed and two heading references from a sun compass for navigation. Operational history Flight testing commenced in 1974 at Bicycle Lake, California. The first flights were conducted on battery power, using a bungee cord launch to . On its first flight the aircraft reached 500 feet, before returning for a landing. A lack of sunny days delayed flight testing, but in all, 28 flights were made. The Sunrise would climb slowly at first until its solar cells cooled down and their efficiency increased. On its 28th flight the aircraft was destroyed when it was flown too close to a cumulus cloud at about and the associated turbulence broke the aircraft's structure. Aftermath The success of the flights that had been completed allowed Boucher to state: DARPA and Lockheed proposed a follow-on design to the Sunrise to be powered at night by batteries instead of just gliding. Roland Boucher designed the second aircraft using higher efficiency solar panels that were more aerodynamically smooth. Roland Boucher had become physically exhausted from his work on the initial Sunrise and he suffered from congestive heart failure. He was admitted to intensive care at Santa Monica Hospital. While in hospital he resigned from AstroFlight and sold his interests in the company to his brother Bob Boucher who continued work on the second Sunrise aircraft. After recuperating, Roland Boucher returned to work at Hughes Aircraft on classified military programs. The Sunrise II first flew on 27 September 1975 from Nellis AFB, near Las Vegas, Nevada.

Menso Alting was born in Eelde and was raised in a Catholic family. After visiting several schools in the Netherlands and Germany, he studied theology at Cologne. In 1564 he was named vicar to Haren. A few months later he was named pastor of Sleen. Menso Alting probably never visited Sleen and Haren, instead using the functions, which had been given thanks to influential family-members, as a source of income. In 1565, during his study Menso joined the Protestant Reformation. He continued his studies in Heidelberg. After finished his studies Menso Alting travelled back to Helpen, now a district of Groningen and Sleen, this time to convert the inhabitants to Calvinism. As a result of the Protestant persecutions in the Netherlands after the Beeldenstorm, Menso Alting fled to Germany in July 1567. Travelling through Leiselheim (at Worms), Dirmstein (at Frankenthal) and Heidelberg he eventually reached Emden in East-Frisia in 1575. Around this time about half of the city's inhabitants were Protestant refugees from the Netherlands; an estimated 6000 Dutch people went to Emden during the second half of the 16th century. In October 1575 he became preacher of the Great church in Emden, as well as a political leader. He succeeded the Dutch reformer Albertus Risaeus, who had died in 1574. Alting caused a breakthrough for Calvinism in Emden. Shortly after he became preacher, countess Anna von Oldenburg died. Menso Alting led the Calvinistic funeral services. Count William Louis, stadtholder of Friesland, invited Menso Alting to Drenthe in 1594 to preach there. From this period Menso Alting received his nickname the reformer of Drenthe. It is known that he used a hunebed as pulpit for his sermons. This hunebed is still locally known as the Popeless church. In March 1595, Menso Alting played a large role in the rebellion of the Calvinistic inhabitants of Emden against the Lutheran count of East-Frisia, Edzard II. Menso, who hoped that Emden would join the Dutch Republic, roused the population. Not long after the city declared itself independent from East- Frisia. In the treaty of Delfzijl on 15 July 1595, Emden received a semi- autonomous status, which it would keep until 1744. Menso Alting died at the age of seventy in Emden.

Oil on canvas, 158 cm √ó 254 cm. Alte Nationalgalerie. Begun in the same year as Studio Wall, Iron Rolling Mill may have been inspired by Friedrich Eggers' description of steel mills.Keisch, et al, 357 Studio Wall (1872) is an oil painting by the German artist Adolph Menzel, now in the collection of the Hamburger Kunsthalle. It is considered one of the \\"masterpieces of Menzel's maturity\\", and the artist deemed it his best painting.Fried, 241 The painting depicts a red colored wall of the artist's studio at night, upon which are hung a series of plaster casts illuminated from below. The casts include portrait busts, death masks and life masks of friends of the artist, children, classical personae such as Dante, Schiller, and possibly Goethe or Wagner, a dog, and male and female torsos;Fried, 241 art historian Werner Hofmann saw this assemblage as a conscious blurring of \\"the dividing line between fame and anonymity.\\"Keisch, et al, 97 Numerous commentators have noted that the array of dramatically lit casts \\"convey an uncanny impression of quasi-animateness.\\"Fried, 245 Studio Wall was preceded by a work of the same title painted in 1852, an oil on paper now in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin. That painting features casts of two arms and a separate hand, the arms arranged so as to suggest a relationship to a body from which they have been removed.Fried, 249 Studio Wall is also seen as related to Menzel's larger painting Iron Rolling Mill (1872‚Äì1875), for which it may have served as a study in dramatic lighting, yet it has greater import than that of a merely preparatory exercise, and may have functioned as a kind of memorial: the central death mask is that of the artist's friend Friedrich Eggers, the first critic sympathetic to Menzel's work.Keisch, et al, 357‚Äì358 Eggers died in August 1872, and the painting is dated from October of that year.Keisch, et al, 357 A contemplation on the transience of life, Studio Wall is also a bravura piece of alla prima painting.Keisch, et al, 358Fried, 242 Interpretations of the work vary greatly. For art historian Julius Meier- Graefe, Studio Wall was a harmonious example of pictorial unity; to the contrary, Hofmann saw the painting as a \\"coded manifesto\\", a rejection by Menzel of academic canons in favor of an aesthetic that celebrated the fragmentary and disjointed, and symbolic of the triumph of painting over sculpture.Fried, 242Keisch, et al, 259 Fried rejects Hofman's view of fragmentariness and anti-academicism, seeing the picture as a structured composition of objects arranged in successive rows.Fried, 242 For Fried the likeliest allegorical meaning would be the sublimation of tangible existence to that of \\"phantasmagorias\\", a world inhabited by ghosts in the form of plaster casts.Fried, 246 Notes References * Fried, Michael.

They formed a significant part of England's educational systems from the mid-seventeenth to nineteenth centuries. Background After the Uniformity Act 1662, for about two centuries, it was difficult for any but practising members of the Church of England to gain degrees from the old English universities, at Cambridge and Oxford. The University of Oxford, in particular, required ‚Äì until the Oxford University Act 1854 ‚Äì a religious test on admission that was comparable to that for joining the Church. The situation at the University of Cambridge was that a statutory test was required to take a bachelor's degree. English Dissenters in this context were Nonconformist Protestants who could not in good conscience subscribe (i.e. conform) to the beliefs of the Church of England. As they were debarred from taking degrees in the only two English universities, many of them attended the dissenting academies. If they could afford it, they completed their education at the universities of Leyden, Utrecht, Glasgow or Edinburgh, the last, particularly, those who were studying medicine or law. Many students attending Utrecht were supported by the Presbyterian Fund.C. G. Bolam, Jeremy Goring, H.L. Short and Roger Thomas; The English Presbyterians from Elizabethan Puritanism to Modern Unitarianism; London, George Allen & Unwin, 1968. While the religious reasons mattered most, the geography of university education also was a factor. The plans for a Durham College of Oliver Cromwell provided an attempt to break the educational monopoly of Oxbridge, and while it failed because of the political change in 1660, the founder of Rathmell Academy was Richard Frankland, who may have been involved in the Durham College project. Almost as soon as dissenting academies began to appear, Frankland was backed by those who wished to see an independent university-standard education available in the north of England. Tutors in the academies were initially drawn from the ejected ministers of 1662, who had left the Church of England after the passing of the Uniformity Act, and many of whom had English university degrees. After that generation, some tutors did not have those academic credentials to support their reputations, although in many cases other universities, particularly the Scottish institutions that were sympathetic to their Presbyterian views, awarded them honorary doctorates. Funding There were several sources of funding. Some of these funds gave their trustees the option of sending young men either to dissenting academies, or to universities abroad. An academy, to attract such students, had to offer a course of instruction approved of by the Board for its purposes. Funding might be central or local, and there could be doctrinal as well as practical reasons why a given academy was sent students with financial support. The Common Fund Board, founded in 1689, gave scholarships to Presbyterian and Congregational candidates for the ministry; its successor, the Presbyterian Fund Board, continued into the middle of the nineteenth century. An education at a dissenting academy was not the only option for the Fund Board, since a candidate could also be sponsored at a Scottish university, or elsewhere. A gap opened up between the Presbyterians and Congregationalists, as the Independents started to be called, for reasons of doctrine. The Independent or Congregational Fund Board was established in 1695 to assist poor ministers, and to give young men who had already received a classical education, the theological and other training preparatory to the Christian ministry. An early sign of the division between Presbyterians and Independents was the fate of the Rathmell Academy after the death of Frankland in 1698: it migrated to Manchester under John Chorlton, while another academy under Timothy Jollie, an Independent, operated at Attercliffe (one of the locations of Frankland's migratory academy) from the 1690s onwards. In 1730, the King's Head Society was founded by laymen in London (after the pub behind the Royal Exchange at which they met) who were dissatisfied with the management of the Congregational Fund Board. The chief point of objection was the Academies' rule which limited students to those who had already passed through a classical training, including the demanding and lengthy training period required for learning to read Greek and Latin texts. The King's Head Society resolved to found an academy where young men without a general classical education would receive it during their first two years and could then proceed to the usual classical-theological course. The Coward Trust from 1743 funded Daventry Academy and a London academy under David Jennings, but was distinct from the ordinary Congregational funding. Legal position The letter of the law could make the running of a dissenting academy difficult or impossible. In the general framework according to which schools must be licensed by the bishop, and ministers (who made up most of the teaching staff) could be in legal trouble for the activities that held together their congregations, some academies simply shut down. For a short period (1714 to 1719) the Schism Act was in force, and aimed precisely to do that; but the troubles of the academies were mostly before this legislation. Proceedings in ecclesiastical courts were quite common in the 17th century, for example in the case of the tutor Benjamin Robinson. The degree of religious toleration in the later half of the seventeenth century varied considerably according to laws passed by Parliament, and also in line with the public mood. Some academies, such as that of John Shuttlewood, operated in remote areas of the countryside, and some tutors were required to leave towns where they had previously performed their ministry, for example under the Five Mile Act. The Toleration Act of 1689 under the reign of William III and Mary II did not mention the dissenters' academies, and proceedings continued against dissenting tutors throughout the 1690s. There were also cases of actions against dissenting grammar schools, for example the proceedings against Isaac Gilling in the 1710s. In 1723 the regium donum, initially a grant to support Irish Presbyterians, became a national subsidy, and subsequently dissenting academies were more generally accepted. Nature of the academies Several early academies became associated with particular theological positions. Richard Frankland of Rathmell Academy and Timothy Jollie of Attercliffe, founders of two of the most celebrated early academies, opposed any departure from Calvinist theology. It was rumoured that Jollie even forbade mathematics \\"as tending to scepticism and infidelity\\", although several of his students later became extremely proficient in the mathematics. Some academies were more broadminded in their teaching methodology, and in their attitudes towards possible methods of church governance. Indeed, several students at dissenting academies later became Anglicans. The dissenters themselves argued that their academies had stricter discipline than the universities, and were perceived by many to have promoted a more contemporary curriculum based on the practical sciences and modern history. In some of the larger academies French and High Dutch (German) were taught. The tutors and the students of the dissenting academies contributed in fundamental ways to the development of ideas, notably in the fields of theology, philosophy, literature, and science. These academies were funded partly by fees for tuition and lodging, as many of them were run in large houses as boarding establishments. They were also funded by philanthropic Dissenters such as William Coward (1647‚Äì1738), whose \\"will set up a trust fund ‚Äòfor the education and training up of young men ‚Ä¶ to qualify them for the ministry of the gospel among the Protestant Dissenters‚Äô, thus continuing the financial support he had given to such students in his lifetime\\". Sometimes this funding was organised along the lines of subscribers.Samuel Lewis in A Topographical Dictionary of England (1831), under the entry for Highbury The Independent or Congregational Fund Board was established in 1695 (i) to assist poor ministers, (2) to give young men who had already received a classical education, the theological and other training preparatory to the Christian ministry. In 1730, the King's Head Society was founded by laymen in London who were dissatisfied with the management of the Fund Academies. The chief point of objection was the Fund Academies rule which limited its students to those who had already passed through a classical training. The founder of the King's Head Society resolved to found an academy with a six years' course, where young men, without a general classical education, would receive it during the first two years and could then proceed to the usual classical-theological course. In the nineteenth century the academies‚Äô original purpose to provide a higher education was largely superseded by the founding of the University of London and the provincial universities, which were open to dissenters, and by the reform of Oxford and Cambridge. Notable examples London area Newington Green, in those days a village north of London, had several academies. Charles Morton (1626‚Äì1698), the educator and minister who ended his career as vice-president of Harvard College, ran an influential academy; the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography judges Morton's \\"probably the most impressive of the dissenting academies [prior to 1685], enrolling as many as fifty pupils at a time\\". The ODNB goes on to describe its advanced and varied curriculum (religion, classics, history, geography, mathematics, natural science, politics, and modern languages) and a well-equipped laboratory, and even \\"a bowling green for recreation\\". Lectures were given in English, not Latin, and Daniel Defoe, one of Morton's students, praised its attention to the mother tongue. Samuel Wesley the elder, a contemporary of Defoe's, described his teacher \\"as universal in his learning\\", although he also attacked the academy on uncertain grounds for promoting king-killing doctrines. James Burgh, author of The Dignity of Human Nature and Thoughts on Education, opened his dissenting academy there in 1750.Gordon, Lyndall (2005), Vindication: A Life of Mary Wollstonecraft. Virago Press. Page 42. (His widow helped Mary Wollstonecraft establish her school in the village. ) Anna Laetitia Barbauld, so closely associated with other leading dissenting academies, chose to spend the latter third of her life in Newington Green. Homerton College, Cambridge started life as the dissenting academy Independent College, Homerton, then another village north of London. West Country The Tewkesbury Academy, set up by Samuel Jones, had as its students both dissenters such as Samuel Chandler and those who became significant establishment figures such as Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Secker and Joseph Butler.W. Davies, The Tewkesbury Academy with sketches of its tutor and students [1905] Sheriffhales Academy, Shropshire (1663‚Äì1697) under John Woodhouse. Midlands Philip Doddridge was chosen in 1723 to conduct the academy being newly established at Market Harborough. It moved many times, and was known as Northampton Academy, Doddridge died in 1751 and the academy continued. and is probably best known as Daventry Academy, which Joseph Priestley attended. The academy ended up in London under the name of Coward College, as it was largely supported by the bequest of William Coward who died 1738. The college was one of three that amalgamated in 1850 into New College London. Hugh Farmer was educated at this college in its earlier days. Shrewsbury Academy was started by James Owen in 1702. Owen died 1706 and his place was filled by Samuel Benion. The academy continued until Benion's death in 1708. North of England Warrington Academy led eventually, via Manchester and York, to Harris Manchester College, Oxford. In 1757, John Seddon, a young minister in Warrington, established the academy. Among the tutors were Joseph Priestley (1761‚Äì67) and Johann Reinhold Forster, a German scholar and naturalist. Forster went with Captain Cook in his second voyage round the world. Rathmell Academy, which had half a dozen homes, was set up by Richard Frankland in 1670. The school moved to Attercliffe, a suburb of Sheffield, Yorkshire, leaving it at the end of July 1689, in consequence of the death of his favourite son, and returning to Rathmell. His pupil Timothy Jollie, independent minister at Sheffield, began Attercliffe Academy,\\"Jollie, Timothy\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography on a more restricted principle than Frankland's, apparently excluding mathematics \\"as tending to scepticism\\".

He came to Texas as a boy from Mississippi in 1880. He grew up on a farm in Trinity County where he later built a lumber business. He married Jessie Gertrude (n√©e Dudley) in 1895. He built a business empire that included ranching, banking, lumber, oil, real estate, and newspaper publishing. He was heavily involved in politics both in Houston and at the state level. He served as an officer and board member for various banks, universities, and other business interests. He later became a publisher of the Dallas Journal and the Austin Tribune in part because of his interest in politics. Personal life West was born in Waynesboro, Mississippi, on May 2, 1871 to Silas Wesley and Mattie (n√©e Clark) West. He moved with his family to Texas at the age of nine. His family settled on land in Trinity County and began a life of subsistence farming. Times were not easy and the family struggled financially through his early years. West would leave school early at the age of 13 due to the financial stress his family endured. He would subsequently begin a career that would lead him to become a millionaire many times over by the early 20th Century.Whatley Clarke, M. (1952). Jim West of Houston, The Cattleman, December, 1952, pp. 74, 76, 78, & 80. Jessie Gertrude (n√©e Dudley) West He married a school teacher from Josserand, Texas, named Jessie Gertrude (n√©e Dudley) on July 3, 1895 in the Groveton Methodist Church. Together, they had two sons, James Jr. born on September 26, 1903, and Wesley, born on June 6, 1906, and a daughter Mildred. A quiet individual who enjoyed the outdoors, ranching, and his privacy, West was a tall man of over six feet with trademark West blue eyes and dark black hair that turned gray in his later years. Shrewd, but not callous, he was modest despite his vast wealth. West was a conservative both in his business dealings and in his politics, where he was a noted Republican.Whatley Clarke, M. (1952). Jim West of Houston, The Cattleman, December, 1952, pp. 74, 76, 78, & 80. West died on August 24, 1941, while on a business trip to Kansas City. His son Wesley was by his side when he died. He is buried in the Forest Park Cemetery in Houston.Whatley Clarke, M. (1952). Jim West of Houston, The Cattleman, December, 1952, pp. 74, 76, 78, & 80. Business ventures and associations Financial stress on his family forced West to leave school in 1884 at the age of 13 to work as a water boy at the Trinity County Lumber Company in Groveton, TX, owned by Peter Josserand Jr. West saved money from this position, using the funds to later buy a drug store in Groveton where he would work after spending the day at the lumber mill. The store would later burn to the ground, but the experience left in him the desire to run his own company. He eventually went into business with Josserand and subsequently bought the mill outright. Shortly thereafter he began raising longhorn cattle on the side, a business he would also later grow into a veritable empire. From this beginning, West Lumber would grow to more than a two dozen mills across Texas and Louisiana including sites in Saron in Trinity County, the communities of Dayton and Milvid in Liberty County, the towns of Latexo and Lovelady in Houston County, Connell in Jefferson County, the Benford, Corrigan, Onalaska, and Stanley communities in Polk County, and Houston in Harris County. His interests in these mills led him to become a millionaire many times over.Whatley Clarke, M. (1952). Jim West of Houston, The Cattleman, December, 1952, pp. 74, 76, 78, & 80. A notable business acquisition saw West acquire the competing William Carlisle & Company of Onalaska which included over one billion feet of stumpage, a number of associated saw mills, and a railroad. He acquired the South Texas Lumber Company from Jesse Jones in 1910.Whatley Clarke, M. (1952). Jim West of Houston, The Cattleman, December, 1952, pp. 74, 76, 78, & 80. Shortly after World War I, West Lumber sawed over 400,000 feet of lumber daily in some 24 mills, while employing over 1,500 people (some 6% of the lumber workforce in Texas at the time). West remarked frequently that he was a cattleman at heart and he built a fortune in ranching across Texas. He owned multiple ranches in the state including the 48,000 acre Fort Terrett Ranch in Sutton County, the 203,000 acre Longfellow Ranch in Pecos County, the 155,000 acre Chupadero Ranch (purchased in 1932), the Indio Ranch (in Maverick and Webb counties; purchased in 1940), the 175,000 acre Figure 2 Ranch in Hudspeth and Culberson counties, the 30,000 acre West Ranch in Harris County, and the 40,000 West Ranch in Blanco County.,Whatley Clarke, M. (1952). Jim West of Houston, The Cattleman, December, 1952, pp. 74, 76, 78, & 80. West also maintained two ranches in New Mexico including one in Logan, NM. Additional land was leased by his company West Securities as part of the ranching business. All of these fell under the management of The West Cattle Company, later renamed the West-Pyle Cattle Company after West‚Äôs death when sons James Jr. and Wesley took over the company and ran it with noted cowman Forest Barnett ‚ÄúBuck‚Äù Pyle. He was as successful in the cattle business as he was in the lumber industry and increased his wealth with these operations greatly. West was elected to a two-year term as 16th President of the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, but resigned after one year in office. He actively campaigned to have Dolph Briscoe Sr. (father of future Governor Dolph Briscoe Jr. of Uvalde) elected to succeed him.Whatley Clarke, M. (1952). Jim West of Houston, The Cattleman, December, 1952, pp. 74, 76, 78, & 80. The favor would be returned many years later when Dolph Jr., by then governor of the state, appointed West's daughter-in-law Neva to the Texas Commission on the Arts for a four-year term beginning in 1975. West ventured into the oil business in the 1920s. He acquired large holdings in the Pierce Junction Field in present-day Houston (which produced nearly 89 million barrels of oil through 1984) and the Thompson Field (part of the Frio Deep- Seated Salt Dome Fields which produced over 2.4 billion barrels through the early 1990s) with his two young sons and friend Hugh Roy Cullen in the late 1920s. He would also develop and run an independent oil company, West Production Company. After oil was discovered on his ranch in present-day Clear Lake City, he sold the ranch to the Humble Oil Company, a forerunner of today's ExxonMobil in 1937 for $8.5 million cash (worth some $139,400,607 in February, 2013 dollars) and a substantial amount of stock. In 1939, West was appointed by then Governor W. Lee \\"Pappy\\" O'Daniel to be Chairman of the Texas Highway Commission (now the Texas Department of Transportation). However, as a Republican, a vocal supporter of failed Republican Presidential candidate Alf Landon, and opponent of Franklin D. Roosevelt, West could not garner sufficient support to be confirmed by the Democratically controlled Texas Senate. Feeling the failure to be motivated by politics rather than his ability to do the job, West entered the world of publishing to leverage his political beliefs and might. He bought the Dallas Dispatch-Journal newspaper in 1939, subsequently renaming it the Dallas Journal. He later bought the Austin Tribune newspaper and the KBTC radio station in Austin (later sold by son Wesley to family friends Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson).Whatley Clarke, M. (1952).

Jim West of Houston, The Cattleman, December, 1952, pp. 74, 76, 78, & 80.

The Big Rich: The Rise and Fall of the Greatest Texas Oil Fortunes. Penguin Press: NY. Involvement in higher education and charity West was appointed to the Board of Directors (now Board of Regents) of Texas Technological College (Texas Tech University) in 1935 and served in the position from 1935 through 1941, Chairing the Board from 1940 to 1941.. West Hall on the Texas Tech campus is named in his honor.Spurrier, J. (2003). Foundations: The Names on the Bricks, Texas Techsan, July‚ÄìAugust, 2003, p.10-11. West was also a Director of the Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas.Whatley Clarke, M. (1952). Jim West of Houston, The Cattleman, December, 1952, pp. 74, 76, 78, & 80. He was a trustee of the Methodist Hospital, Houston, and a steward of Saint Paul's Methodist Church, Houston. In 1938 he established the West Foundation (now the West Endowment), a Houston-based charity which continues to donate to a variety of causes. Homes Front of Jim West Mansion - 2012. Cannot be seen from highway. James and Jessie West Mansion, Harris, County, Texas, in 2012 His main home was the West Ranch in the Galveston Bay Area occupying what is now Clear Lake City and NASA's Johnson Space Center. His home there, an Italian Renaissance Revival style mansion of some 17,000 square feet, was one of the largest mansions in the Houston area. Designed by noted Houston architect Joseph Finger, the house was the centerpiece of the 30,000 acre ranch. The home was listed as a Texas Historic Landmark in 1993. West stipulated in his will that it not be used as a residence after his death; subsequently, the mansion has been used by both NASA and the University of Houston. West sold most of the ranch after oil was found on the property to Humble Oil. It was Humble Oil (via the Friendswood Development Company) that later created Clear Lake City.Whatley Clarke, M. (1952). Jim West of Houston, The Cattleman, December, 1952, pp. 74, 76, 78, & 80. West Mansion was later owned by Hakeem Olajuwon, used for a time as a showroom, before being demolished in 2019.

Background Gornji Vakuf is a town to the south of the La≈°va Valley, which had a population of about 10,000 Croats and 14,000 Bosniaks. On 11 January 1993 the first clashes between the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) took place. There are conflicting reports as to how the fighting started and what caused it; a bomb placed in a Muslim owned hotel used as a headquarters or an all-out attack by ARBiH forces on HVO positions. On 16 January 1993 the HVO demanded that the ARBiH in Gornji Vakuf subordinate its troops to the HVO, which was rejected. On 18 January the HVO attacked ARBiH positions in Gornji Vakuf.

During the attack, the HVO artillery fired several shells from a nearby village, one of which hit the house of Enver ≈†viljo and killed 7 civilians, including three children, three women, and an older man who died as a result of his wounds. Many Bosniak houses were damaged from the shelling. After the ARBiH surrendered, the women, children, elderly and handicapped people were sent to the nearby village of Paloƒç, where a doctor examined the wounded and sent the seriously injured to a hospital in Bugojno. Others remained in Paloƒç for several days until they were moved by the UNPROFOR. There is no evidence about the detention conditions in Paloƒç.

It is a romantic drama about a brief, unexpected love affair that catches two people completely off-guard. The film won the \\"Best Canadian Feature Film\\" at the Toronto International Film Festival 2009.http://sidcity.net/?p=260 Plot Juliette is a Canadian magazine editor who arrives in Cairo for a vacation with husband Mark, a UN official working at refugee camps in the Gaza Strip. Their children have grown and Juliette is looking forward to spending more time with Mark. Delayed, Mark asks his friend‚Äîa handsome Egyptian named Tareq‚Äîto watch over Juliette. Mark is continually delayed in Gaza, during which time Juliette makes friends with Cairo locals, North American and European residents like Kathryn, explores the city and the surrounding area, and finds herself falling in love with the city during her \\"Cairo Time\\". Tareq is a regular (but not constant) companion during Juliette's extended time waiting for Mark, leading to a very close relationship between the two. While their relationship remains platonic, it is steadily headed to a stronger connection. After travelling to Alexandria with him to attend the wedding of the daughter (Hanan) of a girlfriend from his university days (Yasmeen), she admits that she will miss him when she returns to Canada. The two visit the Great Pyramids‚Äîsomething Mark had insisted should be \\"just for us\\" on his sporadic calls to Juliette at her hotel room.

Production When Ruba Nadda finished writing the script for Cairo Time she showed it to producer Daniel Iron of Foundry Films. Daniel, remembering Ruba's previous feature Sabah, loved the script and decided to work with her. Atom Egoyan gave the screenplay for Cairo Time to Christine Vachon and Charles Pugliese at Killer Films in New York in 2005. Vachon saw there was a lot of potential in the script and decided to meet Nadda with Pugliese. After meeting Nadda they wanted to get involved in the project and thereby became executive producers. Because Canada did not have co-production treaties with Egypt they needed to find a way to shoot in Egypt anyhow. Iron was introduced to David Collins of Samson Films in Ireland by Ruba Nadda. Collins met Nadda at a film festival in Mannheim and in Rotterdam and was familiar with her work. Samson decided to join the project, making it a Canada-Ireland co-production, which allowed them to shoot in Egypt. Cast  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes certified the movie \\"fresh\\" with 82 as of August 2010. The film was received with great reviews. The Wall Street Journal said \\"Clarkson makes taking 'Cairo Time' well worth it\\", while CTV News gave the movie a positive review stating that the movie as \\"A masterful look at repressed romance\\" giving it 3 stars out of 4 Picktainment.com said \\"Ruba Nadda's Cairo Time is a passive, delicate film with a mature respect for its surroundings and a profound understanding of neglect, especially in its subtle form.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Cairo Time \\"a fragile romance\\" and said about Nadda, \\"Just when you think you know what's coming, the canny writer-director Ruba Nadda (Sabah) makes sure you won't. Nadda lets the sensuous tempos of Cairo life seep into Juliette's system, and ours. It's a haunting and hypnotic film.

The town physician, Dr. Paul Christian, reacts to Parker's promises to the women in town of dramatic weight loss, if they followed his advice. The head of the town women's club, Mrs. Browning, is charmed by the questionable professor. Parker and invites him to her home and to have a lecture when the club is meeting. He is welcome to use the club as his forum for his teachings. The professor starts teaching the women about strict diet being the best road to self-satisfaction. Dr. Christian, on the other hand, begins to warn the women about the dangers with wholesale diets, claiming that all diets should be tailored to fit the individual and advising the women not to listen to the professor. The professor's teachings result in the disruption of the town women's eating routines. They also disrupt the peace and quiet in the Browning family life, causing Mrs. Browning and her husband to argue about the professor's teachings and intrusions on the town life. The Browning's daughter, Kitty, has taken an interest in the professor's assistant, Bill Ferris, and started an extreme diet to seem more pleasing to him. Kitty soon collapses from starvation.

In December 2006, the U.S. Army's Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) solicited proposals for the 3000 shp Advanced Affordable Turbine Engine (AATE) free-turbine turboshaft to replace the GE T700 that currently power the UH-60 Black Hawk and AH-64 Apache rotorcraft, leveraging the DoD/NASA/DOE VAATE program. Refitting the existing fleet of twin-engine Black Hawks and Apaches would require a total of 6,215 engines, including spares. Any aircraft that currently uses the T700 or its commercial derivative, the CT7, also could be re-powered by the AATE, including commercial rotorcraft like the Sikorsky S-92. Sikorsky is considering it for the single-turbine S-97 Raider instead of its single GE CT7/T700; in addition, AATE could also power the Joint Multi-Role (JMR) helicopter. In 2007, Honeywell and Pratt & Whitney formed the Advanced Turbine Engine Company (ATEC) joint venture. The science & technology phase to subsidize development of AATE consisted of two contracts: one was awarded in May 2008 to ATEC for $108 million to develop the HPW3000, and the other was awarded to GE Aviation in late 2007 for the GE3000. The four-and-a-half year science and technology phase covered durability and performance demonstration testing and was scheduled to conclude in 2013, but tests continued through 2014. In July 2009, the United States Army announced the development of AATE would continue under the Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP); ITEP would result in an engine that would improve the AH-64 and UH-60 hot and high capacities and increase combat radius. In August 2016, ATEC and GE were awarded 24-month contracts under ITEP to take their engines through preliminary design review; this phase culminated in April 2018 with ATEC and GE demonstrating their prototypes to the Army. On 1 February 2019, the US Army selected the GE T901 as the winner of the ITEP program, awarding the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract for $517 million. Later that same month, ATEC protested the selection of the GE T901 over its T900 in a filing with the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The GAO denied the protest in a filing posted on May 30, 2019. Critical design review in the second quarter of 2020 will lead to first engine testing in the third quarter of 2021 before flight tests, and a production decision in 2024. Design and performance goals In addition to 3,000-shp output, the targets for AATE were a 25% reduction in fuel consumption (less than ), a 65% improvement in power to weight (more than ), a 20% improvement in design life (more than 6000 hours and 15000 cycles), a 35% reduction in production (less than $650k per engine) and maintenance cost, and a 15% reduction in product development cost. The 3,000-shp goal for AATE is a 50% increase over the most powerful T700-701D variant, but would also require upgrades to gearbox, transmission, rotor blades, and tail rotor. Both the ATEC and GE designs can start without an auxiliary power unit (APU), using the battery alone. The UH-60 and AH-64 are currently equipped with Honeywell GTCP 36-150 APUs. Using ITEP, the combat radius is projected to increase by . The hot and high service ceiling will be increased from at . Performance targets have been determined in part by operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as growing airframe weights. Contenders Diagram of a simplified single-spool free-turbine turboshaft engine The major difference between the ATEC HPW3000 (T900) and the GE3000 (T901) engines is in the number of rotating compressor/turbine assemblies in the gas generator stage. The ATEC T900 is a dual-spool turboshaft, while the GE T901 is a single-spool design. In the single-spool design, the compressor is driven by a single turbine; the dual- spool design uses a separate shafts for a two-stage compressor, requiring two turbines. Both are free-turbine turboshafts, where an independent turbine is used in the exhaust stream downstream of the gas generator to extract power. Although the dual-spool design allows each compressor stage to run in their optimal ranges, it makes the machine more complex. ATEC HPW3000 (T900) ATEC is a 50/50 joint venture created in 2007 between Honeywell Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney Military Engines. ATEC completed a Core Engine (High Pressure system only) test in mid-2011 on the two-spool HPW3000 and completed Gas Generator (both High and Low Pressure systems) testing in January 2012. Durability testing of the first HPW3000 completed in October 2013. A second HPW3000 was tested for performance and sand ingestion during late summer 2014. In February 2017, the Army designated the HPW3000 design as the T900-HPW-900 engine. General Electric GE3000 (T901) Since 2010, GE has been developing and testing T901-specific technologies. The second GE3000 was tested for performance, endurance, and sand ingestion in late spring 2014. In 2016, the Army awarded GE Aviation a 24-month contract for the T901 preliminary design review, and the prototype six month testing was completed in October 2017. The GE3000 engine was officially designated as the T901-GE-900 engine in January 2017.

The line provided connection between Warsaw, the capital of Vistula Land (Russian - controlled Poland), and Kalisz, which was located near the border of Russian Empire and German Empire. It was nationalized by the Imperial Russian government in 1912, and in 1914, converted into standard gauge. Two years later, German occupational authorities added a second track. In 1906, Warsaw - Kalisz Railway was connected with the system of German railways, thanks to a newly constructed line Kalisz - Nowe Skalmierzyce (a village which served as a border checkpoint). In 1910, German government built another line, from Ole≈õnica, via Odolan√≥w, to Ostr√≥w Wielkopolski, which shortened the rail distance between Wroc≈Çaw and Kalisz.

It is the second WiiWare game to use the Wii MotionPlus. The gameplay is similar to the gameplay of Punch-Out.Nintendo Life article In 2017, it has been reported that the Android version was removed from the Google Play Store for unknown reasons. Plot The game begins in the arena, but the story is told in cut scenes after boss battles. The Gracius (the player) is the twin son of the King of Avalance, Marius making him a prince. Avalance is a Greco- Roman style City State, teeming with mythical creatures. The King took Gracius's mother, Maia, as a bride by defeating the nearby city of Angalore. Gracius was born minutes before his twin brother, Luthor. Maia died in child birth, but prayed to the gods for her sons to be blessed with great strength and valor. A week prior to the start of the game Gracius and Luthor were made aware of their father's death. King Marius had been killed in his sleep, and witnesses claimed Gracius was the murderer. Gracius's own soldiers handcuffed him and took him away. Luthor told them to stop, but was restrained and ignored. It is eventually revealed that Luthor had framed Marius to take the throne for himself, and Marius bitterly accepts his own naive nature at not seeing the truth. Overview Rage of the Gladiator is a fantasy-based first- person perspective fighting game. You play the role of Gracius, battling for his life in the arena.Rage of the Gladiator Homepage According to an interview with Joystiq, Ghostfire Games CEO Ed Roman states \\"The game consists entirely of boss fights. After all, boss fights are the most interesting aspects of most video games. So we skipped the \\"fodder\\" creatures. Each boss is essentially a little \\"puzzle\\" that you need to figure out how to defeat. Some require dexterity, others require memorization, and some require listening to what they're saying very carefully so that you react to their attacks appropriately.\\" In the same interview, Ed Roman cited a little-known 1990 Neo Geo game Crossed Swords as inspiration for the first-person fighting concept, in addition to influences from several popular games, such as the combat system in Punch-Out!!, the combo system in God of War, the cutscenes in Final Fantasy, and the tech trees in Diablo or World of Warcraft, as well as the background music in films such as 300. Gameplay To win, the player must wait for the right moment, then dodge, jump, or block the enemy‚Äôs attacks. After avoiding an attack, the player may retaliate. Additionally, the player may counter-attack while the enemy is performing an attack. Once you learn to exploit the weakness of each enemy with the proper timing and agility, you can use this knowledge to defeat them. In the Wii version, once you‚Äôve beaten the first 10 opponents in \\"Normal Mode\\", you must face them all again in \\"Challenge Mode\\". In this mode, the opponent gain new powers and are much more difficult. The final opponent is only unlocked at the end of Challenge Mode. This results in a total of 21 battles in the game.Rage of the Gladiator FAQ page In the iOS and Android versions, the same opponents are used, but the player must fight each of them three times, and Lord Vensor III, the penultimate unique opponent, is faced after fighting the first two variations of the previous opponents. A star system is used to control when players are allowed to fight the next few opponents, and stars are earned from winning standard matches, as well as two challenge matches for each opponent where the player must fulfill (a) certain condition(s) to win, such as a time limit and/or performing a certain number of counterattacks. This version features a new armory where players can customize their weapons and armor, which feature stronger gear sets that must be purchased with \\"gems\\", a premium currency that is accrued mostly through in-app purchases. One notable difference in the plot is that Prince Luther manages to escape capture after the final fight and Gracius is haunted by his \\"betrayal\\", unlike in the WiiWare version, where he was caught. In all versions, after each fight, the player is able to upgrade their abilities before moving on to the next opponent, using a Skill tree. Completely filling the skill tree in the WiiWare version will unlock the Brutal Victory move, which can be used to instantly knock out opponents for one round if the player's mana gauge is full and has an open opportunity to attack. The Brutal Victory skill is unlocked in the mobile versions by starting up the game at a certain time of day for four sets of five consecutive days. Skill Tree The player is awarded \\"skill points\\" after each victory, which they can use to upgrade their character in one of three ways. Offense: Focuses on hitting harder, gaining critical strikes, leeching health from opponents, and conjuring spells. Defense: Focuses on taking less damage, improved blocking, the ability to heal yourself in combat, and the ability to resurrect from death. Magic: Focuses on generating more energy to perform combos, channeling electricity into opponents, and summoning spells like lightning and tornados. Media According to Cheat Code Central's Jonathan Marx, \\"Rage of the Gladiator looks like it's shaping up to be a premium title for WiiWare.\\", and \\"Ghostfire Games is set to deliver an engaging gaming experience later this year\\".Preview by Cheat Code Central's Jonathan Marx In an interview with GameZone, Michael Lafferty states \\"The games streaming in as downloads are getting better and better and Ghostfire Games has a real treat in store for Wii fans.

Multiple control schemes offer something for both fans of old school and motion controls, the game looks great, and lots of voice acting brings these bosses to life.\\"IGN Review NintendoLife.com gave the game a 9/10, stating: \\"Rage of the Gladiator is the kind of WiiWare game we'd like to see more often, with excellent control, great design and bags of fun.\\"NintendoLife Review GameZone's Dan Liebman gave the game an 8 out of 10, saying \\"Ghostfire Games offers a new twist on the classic boxing simulator with Rage of the Gladiator. The mechanics are fairly familiar, and easy to grasp even if you‚Äôre a newcomer. Using the first-person perspective, the player is thrust into the sandals of Gracius, a comically melodramatic aristocrat-turned-brawler who must face a slew of bizarre enemies in the arena.\\" and \\"With an emphasis on feel-good playability, it‚Äôs hard to go wrong with Rage of the Gladiator.

Once a character has been unlocked, players can switch between them in real time. Plot The Righteous Indignation is attacked in space by the Toads and Bucky's crew; Blinky, Jenny, Dead-Eye and Willy DeWitt scatter to four planets.

The idea behind establishing Carriglea was that it would be \\"Artane on a small scale\\".

The D√∫n Laoghaire College of Art and Design moved to the site in the early 1980s, expanding into the D√∫n Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology (IADT) in 1997 with several more buildings constructed over the years. Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Physical abuse The Commission concluded that when discipline had broken down, the Congregation approved the appointment of a man known to practice excessive corporal punishment and that they considered this an appropriate approach.Chapter 10, Carriglea Park Industrial School, Dun Laoghaire (‚ÄòCarriglea‚Äô), 1894‚Äì1954, section 10-90, Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Sexual abuse The Commission concluded that there was a problem with abuse of boys by other boys.Chapter 10, Carriglea Park Industrial School, Dun Laoghaire (‚ÄòCarriglea‚Äô), 1894‚Äì1954, section 10-110, Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse They noted that a Brother had been transferred from Artane Industrial school to Carriglea after concerns had been expressed about his friendship with a particular boy in Artane ‚Äì this was condemned as \\"ill-judged and dangerous\\".

He had committed offences at Carriglea and Marino. The Commission found that the records of the General Council showed that they regarded his offences as being much more serious than the submission to the Commission by the Christian Brothers had indicated. Brother Lancelins offences were serious enough to be described with language that would be used of criminal offences, contradicting the submission made by the Congregation to the Commission. The Commission described one offence in particular as a \\"serious case of sexual abuse\\". Unusually for the 1940s, the boys made written statements about the abuse. Emotional abuse and neglect Carriglea Park was \\"dilapidated and run-down\\" for most of the period of the Commissions remit.Chapter 10, Carriglea Park Industrial School, Dun Laoghaire (‚ÄòCarriglea‚Äô), 1894‚Äì1954, section 10-140, Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Boys were badly clothed and went barefoot in summer despite adequate funds being available.

Chronic mismanagement and a harsh regieme caused abuse. Discipline was enforced by harsh and violent means to introduce order, with no regard for the boys welfare. Sexual abuse by two Brothers was noted. Primary education was good, but trades preparation was poor. The school was dilapidated and poorly run.

Early life and education Vilmos Nagy was born into a family of country nobility of Sz√©kely ancestry. His ancestors received their patent of nobility in 1676 from Apafi Mih√°ly I, a ruling prince of Transylvania, and the title of Nagybaczoni (Transl: of Nagybaczon) refers to his ancestral home in Covasna County, Transylvania. He lost his father, Nagy Zsigmond (Sigmund Nagy), a mining engineer of little means at an early age, and his widowed mother could not provide for the children's education. Thus, with no other options, together with his brother B√©la he decided to pursue a military career. In 1902, he graduated with honours from the Kun Koll√©gium high school in Sz√°szv√°ros, and his exemplary record gained him tuition free admittance, with continuing financial support, to the prestigious Ludovica Military Academy. Military career After his graduation in 1905, he elected to serve with the Royal Hungarian Army rather than joining the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Army. This was considered to be a career limiting choice, since there were fewer possibilities for advancement. His outstanding service surpassed that of his fellow officers and four years after receiving his first commission, he completed the Imperial War College in Vienna (1909‚Äì1912). Thus, in his thirtieth year, he was appointed to the Imperial General Staff with the rank of major. World War I and its aftermath As a young Staff officer in World War I, he participated in operations against Serbia, in the battles of the Carpathian front, the breakthrough at Gorlice, and operations in Volhynia. In 1919, after the end of the war and collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, his extensive military experience and expertise was utilized by the Hungarian Red Army of the Hungarian Soviet Republic and he was again assigned to the General Staff with the rank of major. Between World Wars The career of Major Vilmos Nagy continued its uninterrupted rise following the collapse of the short lived Socialist Republic, as he was reassigned to the general staff of the newly formed Royal Hungarian Army. Vilmos Nagy marches to Marosv√°s√°rhely on 10 September 1940 Between 1927 and 1931, he served as the commanding officer of the 1st Mounted Infantry. This was followed by his appointment as chief adjutant to the Commander in Chief of the military forces. On 1 May 1934, he was promoted to Colonel, and assigned command of the Quartermaster Corps. Then, on 1 May 1937 he was promoted to Brigadier General, and in the following year, was assigned the command of the 1st Mounted Infantry Corps. Following the First Vienna Award concerning Slovakia, he commanded the forces occupying the city of Ko≈°ice (Hungarian: Kassa). Within a short while and on a temporary basis, he was assigned to be the Inspector General of the Infantry. Within a year, in March 1940, he was appointed as the commanding officer of the 1st Hungarian Army, and two months later, he was promoted to the rank of Major General. Following the Second Vienna Award, on September 1940, he led the 1st Hungarian Army into the city of Marosv√°s√°rhely (T√¢rgu Mure≈ü). His responsibilities included strengthening the borders of the re-conquered territory, and overseeing the distribution of food supplies to the population at large. In a completely unexpected move on 31 March 1941, the High Command retired him with the rank of Lieutenant General, and at this point it seemed that the military career of Vilmos Nagy of Nagybaczon has ended. World War II On 21 September 1942 the Regent, Mikl√≥s Horthy, offered General Nagy the portfolio of the Minister of Defense. In this position, and true to his convictions, Nagy did everything to keep the military out of politics, and struggled to modernize and preserve the remaining Hungarian military stationed at home to prevent the repeat of another debacle which followed the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918. Prior to his appointment, the government committed the 2nd Hungarian Army to the Eastern Front, where they eventually met a tragic end by their complete annihilation at Voronezh. While Nagy couldn't bring back the troops from the front, he made every effort to preserve and safeguard the troops back home and ameliorate the conditions of the forced labour battalions. He issued numerous orders for the improvement of their conditions. These actions met with opposition from the officers' corps at the ministry and politicians of the extreme right. His political effectiveness diminished as he sought to curb the military's culture of Antisemitism and the inhumane treatment of the forced labourers. He strenuously objected to the German request of sending Jewish forced labourers to the copper mines at Bor, Serbia, and in February 1943, he opposed acquiescing to the German request of sending Hungarian troops to the Balkans. Due to his position on these issues, he was viewed as increasingly dangerous by his enemies. He was ridiculed, accused of being a 'Jewish lackey' (Zsid√≥b√©renc), of being anti-Axis, and was under constant attack by the extreme political right. Seeing that neither Regent Horthy, nor the Prime Minister K√°llay were able or willing to defend him, on 8 June 1943, he submitted his resignation. He was succeeded by Colonel-In-Chief Lajos Csatay, and the daily press praised the person of the departing minister. On 16 June, the social democratic daily N√©pszava (Voice of the People) published an exceptionally warm appraisal. Endre Bajcsy-Zsilinszky, in his memoirs on government related matters, he wrote that in his 10 June submission to the Regent, he praised the service of the departing minister. The city of Marosv√°s√°rhely named him an honorary citizen but, due to 19 March 1944 occupation of Hungary by the Germans, the ceremony was cancelled. The war's end From behind the scenes, Vilmos Nagy continued to support the efforts of those who wished to achieve a separate peace with the Allies. Hungary lay in the direct path of the Nazi armies retreating from the onslaught of the Red Army and, based on past experience, he foresaw the utter destruction to be visited upon the land and the people as the fighting moved ever closer to the borders of Hungary. The extreme right was not satisfied with distancing him from a position of power and authority, and after the government's takeover by the fascist Arrow Cross, on 16 November 1944, the gendarmerie (csend≈ër√∂k) arrested him at his Piliscsaba home. After being held for two days at Hotel Lomnic on Sv√°bhegy, which served as a prison facility of the Arrow Cross, together with his brother B√©la and other prisoners, he was transferred to the prison in Sopronk√∂hida. As the Red Army approached, the prisoners, under the command of lieutenant colonel √Årp√°d Barcsay of the gendarmes, were transported to Passau Bavaria, then to Pfarrkirchen, and finally force marched to Gschaid. The Ministry of Defense discovered the constantly moving prisoners in Simbach, and their intervention forced the prisoners' transport to the ministry compound in Tann where they were released. From Tann, on Sunday 28 April 1945, together with his brother, he moved to where he found accommodations on a Bavarian farm until the US forces reached them on 1 May. Later life He managed to return to Hungary in 1946, and in the initial period of the governing coalition of the various political factions, he participated as a committee member for the assessment of military pensions. After the Communist takeover of 1948, together with many of his peers, he was unjustly attacked, his apartment confiscated, and his pension revoked. He found employment as a gardener and caretaker at the tree nursery of Pilisi Parkerd≈ë gazdas√°g (hu), where he tended to the planting and care of seedlings and, later, he found employment as a metalsmith. At the beginning of 1950s a singularly unexpected event transpired. He received an invitation to the fiftieth graduation reunion of his high school. The invitation came from his former classmate and fellow graduate, Dr. Petru Groza, who at the time was the President of Romania. Nagy replied that he could not participate due to his lack of funds and a passport. The President then used his influence with the Hungarian government, and the Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party, M√°ty√°s R√°kosi, was obliged to provide the means to attend the reunion. Further intervention by the President saw the general's pension reinstated. He gained a measure of comfort and fulfillment when he was selected in 1965 as the first Hungarian Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem Institute of Jerusalem. The aging general remained mentally active until his death by spending his time writing, editing, and reading. In 1964, he re-edited his work, V√©gzetes esztend√∂k (\\"Fateful Years\\"), which was originally published in 1947. The long-lived soldier died in Piliscsaba on 21 June 1976, shortly after his ninety-second birthday. Works In addition to his military expertise, Vilmos Nagy of Nagybaczon was also a military theorist and a historian. Based on his personal and extensive battlefield and General Staff experience, his valuable contributions to our knowledge of the times has been invaluable. His works include: * The Campaign Against Romania (A Rom√°nia elleni hadj√°rat), Budapest, 1923. * The Attack (A t√°mad√°s), Budapest, 1926. * Conquest of Serbia (Szerbia megh√≥d√≠t√°sa), Budapest, 1929 * The Fateful Years 1938‚Äì1945.

In memoriam * In retirement, Vilmos Nagy lived under very modest circumstances and recognition was denied until the 1990s, when changes in the political landscape made this possible. * As part of Hungary's millennium celebrations on 9 September 2000, his hometown organized The first World Meet of Piliscsaba, during which he was posthumously honoured as an 'Honorary citizen of Piliscsaba', an act that pleased his old neighbours and fellow townsmen. The honour was accepted by his grandchildren, Mrs. Andr√°s F√°y and Mrs. K√°roly Nagy. * On 18 June 2003, with the active promotion of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Hungary, in hand with the Hungarian Federation of Forced Laborers, and the National Memorial and Reconciliation Commission of Hungary, dedicated a memorial plaque in honour of the former Minister of Defense. * On the 120th anniversary of his birth in 2004, Nagybaczon in Transylvania also dedicated a memorial plaque in his honour. * On 9 September 2006, with a military guard of honour present, his burial place was declared a part of the National Cemetery of Hungary.

It is based on the premise that organizations are complex systems. As such, changes in one aspect of performance in an organization necessarily affects performance in another parts of an organization. A primary goal of BSA is to create a balanced applications in which areas of poor performance are improved, areas of high performance are maintained, and employee performance outcomes are directed towards organizational goals. This is done through the careful use of behavioral and systems theories, and the application of research based principles of behavior, such as reinforcement, punishment, stimulus control, discrimination and generalization.

Masaryk (founder and first president of the State of Czechoslovakia) who was skeptical about the plan since he did not believe that England and France would accept the idea of the total abrogation of the Empire, and was therefore was in favor of a confederation.Masaryk on Croatian separatist movement In 1918, due to disagreements over the Yugoslav issue, Lorkoviƒá left the Croato-Serb coalition and joined the newly founded community of Croatia (1919). Along with Stjepan Radic and others he entered the so-called \\"Hrvatski blok\\" or \\"Croatian Bloc\\" formed on 14 January 1922, when the Croatian Republican Peasant Party, the Croatian Community, and the Croatian Party of Rights went into alliance. It existed until November of that year. On 13 September 1925, at a conference of Croatian Community representatives and dissidents from the Croatian Peasant Party in Split, the Croatian People's Federalist Union was founded. On 11 January 1926, the Croatian Federalist Peasant Party was founded in Zagreb, and Lorkoviƒá became the head of its Presidency. Following the 1928 assassination of Stjepan Radiƒá, the party started to largely support the opposition Peasant- Democratic Coalition. As part of the 6 January Dictatorship, the party was formally banned on 20 January 1929. His son was Usta≈°e minister Mladen Lorkoviƒá.

At public workers meetings it would condemn the Yevsektsia, the Jewish Section of the Communist Party. As of 1920, there was a Kiev-based All-Ukrainian General Committee of Bund (S.D.). In February 1921, mass arrests to Bund (S.D.) members took place in Vitebsk, Odessa, Kharkov, Rostov and Kiev. The Moscow Bund Club was raided on two occasions and materials confiscated. By March 1921 the party was largely defunct inside Russia. In 1922, the Social Democratic Bund representation abroad took part in a protest against a trial of Socialist-Revolutionary leaders in Moscow. As late as February 1923 it published Biuleten tsentralnogo komiteta Bunda ('Bulletine of the Bund Central Committee') from Moscow. The February 1923 issue spoke of Bund sections active in Moscow and Vitebsk. In Vilno After Vilna/Wilno (present-day Vilnius) was annexed by the Second Polish Republic in 1922, the Wilno Social-Democratic Bund hesitated to join the General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland.

In CPAM, usually an entire lobe of lung is replaced by a non-working cystic piece of abnormal lung tissue. This abnormal tissue will never function as normal lung tissue. The underlying cause for CPAM is unknown. It occurs in approximately 1 in every 30,000 pregnancies.http://synapse.koreamed.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/0003TRD/trd-72-501.pdf In most cases the outcome of a fetus with CPAM is very good. In rare cases, the cystic mass grows so large as to limit the growth of the surrounding lung and cause pressure against the heart. In these situations, the CPAM can be life-threatening for the fetus. CPAM can be separated into five types, based on clinical and pathologic features.Nihal Kilin√ß et al., \\"Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation: Case Report\\". Perinatal Journal, vol. 15, issue 1 (April 2007) CPAM type 1 is the most common, with large cysts and a good prognosis. CPAM type 2 (with medium-sized cysts) often has a poor prognosis, owing to its frequent association with other significant anomalies. Other types are rare.Robbins and Cotran, Pathologic Basis of Disease 7th ed. Signs and symptoms  Three quarters of affected patients are asymptomatic. However, 25% develop cyanosis, pneumothorax, and show signs of increased breathing difficulty (tachypnoea and intercostal retractions). At examination, they may show hyper-resonance at percussion, diminished vesicular murmur and an asymmetrical thorax. Cause The cause of CPAM is unknown. Diagnosis CPAM on chest radiograph in a newborn. Large cystic changes in the left lung, leading to a mediastinal shift to the right due to their mass effect. CPAMs are often identified during routine prenatal ultrasonography. Identifying characteristics on the sonogram include: an echogenic (bright) mass appearing in the chest of the fetus, displacement of the heart from its normal position, a flat or everted (pushed downward) diaphragm, or the absence of visible lung tissue. CPAMs are classified into three different types based largely on their gross appearance. Type I has a large (>2 cm) multiloculated cysts. Type II has smaller uniform cysts. Type III is not grossly cystic, referred to as the \\"adenomatoid\\" type. Microscopically, the lesions are not true cysts, but communicate with the surrounding parenchyma. Some lesions have an abnormal connection to a blood vessel from an aorta and are referred to as \\"hybrid lesions.\\" Imaging Congenital pulmonary airway malformation in a fetus, ultrasound at 19 weeks -sagittal. Stomach top right of image, heart displaced to bottom left of image (anatomically on the right side of fetus.) Congenital pulmonary airway malformation in a fetus, ultrasound at 19 weeks - transverse. Stomach on left image; heart on right image: displaced to right by cystic mass The earliest point at which a CPAM can be detected is by prenatal ultrasound. The classic description is of an echogenic lung mass that gradually disappears over subsequent ultrasounds. The disappearance is due to the malformation becoming filled with fluid over the course of the gestation, allowing the ultrasound waves to penetrate it more easily and rendering it invisible on sonographic imaging. When a CPAM is rapidly growing, either solid or with a dominant cyst, they have a higher incidence of developing venous outflow obstruction, cardiac failure and ultimately hydrops fetalis. If hydrops is not present, the fetus has a 95% chance of survival. When hydrops is present, risk of fetal demise is much greater without in utero surgery to correct the pathophysiology. The greatest period of growth is during the end of the second trimester, between 20‚Äì26 weeks. A measure of mass volume divided by head circumference, termed cystic adenomatoid malformation volume ratio (CVR) has been developed to predict the risk of hydrops. The lung mass volume is determined using the formula (length √ó width √ó anteroposterior diameter √∑ 2), divided by head circumference. With a CVR greater than 1.6 being considered high risk. Fetuses with a CVR less than 1.6 and without a dominant cyst have less than a 3% risk of hydrops. After delivery, if the patient is symptomatic, resection is mandated. If the infant is asymptomatic, the need for resection is a subject of debate, though it is usually recommended. Development of recurrent infections, rhabdomyosarcoma, adenocarcinomas in situ within the lung malformation have been reported. Treatment In most cases, a fetus with CPAM is closely monitored during pregnancy and the CPAM is removed via surgery after birth. Most babies with a CPAM are born without complication and are monitored during the first few months. Many patients have surgery, typically before their first birthday, because of the risk of recurrent lung infections associated with CPAMs. Some pediatric surgeons can safely remove these lesions using very tiny incisions using minimally invasive surgical techniques (thoracoscopy). However, some CPAM patients live a full life without any complication or incident. It is hypothesized that there are thousands of people living with an undetected CPAM. Through ultrasound testing employed in recent years, many more patients are aware that they live with this condition. Rarely, long standing CPAMs have been reported to become cancerous. Very large cystic masses might pose a danger during birth because of the airway compression. In this situation, a special surgical type of delivery called the EXIT procedure may be used. In rare extreme cases, where fetus's heart is in danger, fetal surgery can be performed to remove the CPAM. If non-immune hydrops fetalis develop, there is a near universal mortality of the fetus without intervention. Fetal surgery can improve the chances of survival to 50-60%. Recently, several studies found that a single course of prenatal steroids (betamethasone) may increase survival in hydropic fetuses with microcystic CPAMs to 75-100%. These studies indicate that large microcystic lesions may be treated prenatally without surgical intervention. Large macrocyst lesions may require in utero placement of a Harrison thoracoamniotic shunt.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on October 11, 2009. The episode pays homage to the 1985 comedy film Spies Like Us, featuring baby Stewie and anthropomorphic dog Brian as they discover that American spies Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd have moved into their neighbor Cleveland Brown's old house; they eventually follow them on a secret mission to Russia. Meanwhile, Peter, Joe, and Quagmire attempt to start an improv comedy group with very little success. The episode was written by Alec Sulkin and was directed by Cyndi Tang-Loveland. It received positive reviews from critics. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 8.88 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, Gary Cole, Dimitri Diatchenko, James Lipton, Henriette Mantel, Chris Parson, Nicole Sullivan, and Mae Whitman, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \\"Spies Reminiscent of Us\\" was released on DVD along with seven other episodes from the season on June 15, 2010. Plot Peter loses to Lois in a race for the bathroom and finds their other bathroom is occupied by a transfer student (a talking elephant) from Africa. Angered, Peter begins frequenting the toilet at Cleveland's old house, which he has vacated after moving to Virginia. He tells this Lois before proceeding to use Cleveland's bathroom while dancing to Jennifer Lopez's \\"Let's Get Loud.\\" The house is eventually rented to actors Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, and Peter invites the two actors to his house for dinner. Peter shows them some of his comedy bits, including a crude impersonation of John Wayne, which Chase, Aykroyd and Lois find painfully unfunny. Suspicious as to why Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd are living in their neighborhood, Stewie and Brian investigate the house and discover a secret underground military facility, eventually learning that the two actors were made real spies by Ronald Reagan after he saw their film Spies Like Us. Chase and Aykroyd explain that during the Cold War, the Soviet Union turned dozens of American citizens into sleeper agents who would fall into a trance and do the bidding of the KGB upon hearing the phrase, \\"Gosh, that Italian family at the next table sure is quiet\\" ‚Äì a phrase no one would normally use. They later explain that one of the sleeper agents resides in Quahog, and they are looking for him/her. Chase and Aykroyd ask Brian and Stewie to help them in their mission, noting that they know several people acting very strangely in Quahog. Brian and Stewie accept the offer. The four spies head to City Hall to warn Mayor West about the sleeper agent, but they discover that the mayor is the sleeper agent when Aykroyd inadvertently uses the trigger phrase. During the ensuing fight, Aykroyd plants a homing beacon on Mayor West's leg. West escapes to Russia and the four follow him. However, they immediately stand out as US agents, and are subsequently arrested and brought into the office of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who explains that the sleeper agent plan would be an embarrassment to their government if revealed to the public. He offers to help them stop West from fulfilling his pre-programmed mission by providing them transportation. When the four find West, they see him launch a nuclear missile aimed at the United States before he snaps out of his trance. Mayor West holds himself responsible for America's fate, though Brian comforts him with the knowledge that West was not in control of his actions, having been brainwashed by the Soviets. Aykroyd realizes that he can hack into the missile's guidance system. This allows him to aim the missile's warhead high above the Earth's atmosphere and harmlessly explode, saving the US. The fuselage, though, crashes into Cleveland's house in Stoolbend, Virginia, while Cleveland was taking a bath, eliciting confusion from his neighbor, Tim the Bear. The episode ends with Brian and Stewie in the family living room as they recount their adventure and repeat the activation phrase, which reveals Meg to be another sleeper agent. Meanwhile, Peter spends the rest of the episode working in an improv comedy group with Quagmire and Joe. Quagmire attempts to educate the others on the fine art of improv comedy but when they try to do a live show, Peter's lack of conscious comedic knowledge completely gives way to his John Wayne impersonations, which the audience finds hilarious. This, along with Joe's fecal incontinence, forces Quagmire to end the show early and conclude that this is something that should never have been attempted. Production and development The episode was written by series regular Alec Sulkin and directed by Cyndi Tang-Loveland in her first episode for the eighth production season. The episode was originally intended to be a \\"Road to\\" episode, entitled \\"Road to '85\\", but was switched with \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" instead. Series creator Seth MacFarlane was convinced by \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" director Greg Colton to make the change, due to the subplot that involved Peter, which caused it to \\"not feel like a Road show\\". Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors, and series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane and David Zuckerman served as the episode's staff writers. At the end of the episode, when Meg is revealed to be another sleeper agent by speaking Russian, it gave Mila Kunis an opportunity to voice a line in her native language. \\"Spies Reminiscent of Us\\", along with the seven other episodes from Family Guys eighth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on June 15, 2010. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Seth MacFarlane and various crew and cast members for several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes, a special mini-feature which discussed the process behind animating \\"Road to the Multiverse\\", and a mini-feature entitled Family Guy Karaoke. The episode saw the second re-appearance, the first being a brief appearance in \\"Road to the Multiverse\\", by former main cast member and writer Mike Henry as the voice of Cleveland Brown. The actor had previously left the role on Family Guy to star as the character in his own spin-off The Cleveland Show, co-created by Seth MacFarlane, Mike Henry, and Richard Appel. In addition to the regular cast, actors Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, and Gary Cole; voice actors Dimitri Diatchenko and Chris Parson; writer, actor, and television host James Lipton; actresses Henriette Mantel and Mae Whitman; and voice actress Nicole Sullivan guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Johnny Brennan, actor Ralph Garman, writer and showrunner Mark Hentemann, writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener also made minor appearances. Actors Adam West and Patrick Warburton made appearances as well. Cultural references Actor and writer James Lipton appeared in this episode. The episode was largely based upon the 1985 film Spies Like Us, which starred Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, and the movie is mentioned in the episode itself. The episode was also based on the 1977 spy film Telefon about brainwashed Russian spies in the U.S. who can be activated by a special code phrase. When Peter has to go to the bathroom, he runs to Cleveland's empty home, which has been put up for sale since he left to live in Virginia with his new family. A montage of Peter going to the bathroom is shown, while Jennifer Lopez's \\"Let's Get Loud\\" plays. When Peter becomes aware that Cleveland's house is being rented by actors Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, he mentions that he is honored to have dinner with \\"two of the three Ghostbusters.\\" Chase then replies that he was not in that movie; Peter also notes that he is honored to meet \\"two of the Three Amigos,\\" a movie starring Chase but not Aykroyd. After dinner, Stewie is seen drawing and coloring Sebastian the crab, a character from the Disney film The Little Mermaid. When Aykroyd and Chase ask Stewie and Brian if they want to be \\"spies like us\\", Stewie asks if they can be \\"spies like them\\" and points to Black Spy and White Spy from Spy vs. Spy, one of the head comic strip features of MAD magazine. When Aykroyd and Chase explain to Stewie and Brian how they were recruited as official spies by Reagan, a cutaway is shown of an event in which 1985 is awarded the \\"Awesomest Year of the 80's\\" prize and all characters spontaneously start dancing to the 1983 song \\"(Keep Feeling) Fascination.\\" Later, Brian and Stewie agree to become agents, and Stewie asks if \\"Ron Howard's weird-looking brother is here.\\" There is a cutaway to The Brady Bunch, in which it is revealed Mike Brady killed his first wife, and housekeeper Alice walks in and demands a raise. Back in Quahog, when Peter, Joe, and Quagmire discuss how to prove to Chase and Aykroyd that they know what is funny, Quagmire asks what the most consistent form of comedy is, to which Joe responds \\"improv.\\" This causes Peter, Joe, and Quagmire to yell \\"improv\\" repeatedly, until live-action footage of James Lipton saying the word \\"improv\\" is shown. When Stewie, Brian, Chevy, and Dan land in Russia, the device Dan uses to track the beacon in Adam West's ankle looks like a PKE meter from Ghostbusters. Vladimir Putin makes an appearance in the episode, and asks if Brian and Stewie would like to see a Russian Cutaway Gag. They agree and the viewers are presented with a hedgehog in a foggy forest. The hedgehog then goes on to say, \\"What kind of idiots would make a porcupine sandwich without bread? These no-good bastards!\\" and laughs. This is a nod to the Russian-made animated film Hedgehog in the Fog. Reception In its initial broadcast, this episode received a Nielsen rating of 5.1/8, totaling 8.88 million viewers in the 18‚Äì19 demographic. The episode ranked one of the lowest in the 9:00PM timeslot, behind The Amazing Race on CBS, Sunday Night Football on NBC, and Desperate Housewives; however, it was ahead of fellow Fox animated sitcom American Dad!, which was shown immediately after Family Guy. Reviews of the episode were mostly positive. The A.V. Club's Emily VanDerWerff noted her enjoyment of the storyline, but she mostly enjoyed the episode's inclusion and voice work of Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd and commented favorably on the gags that describe Russia as filled with bears on unicycles and that Adam West turns out to be the Russian sleeper agent. She criticized the improv comedy storyline, and commented that improv troupes and 1980s comedies are lazy targets, and ultimately graded the episode a B, tying that The Simpsons and American Dad!, and beating its spin-off The Cleveland Show. IGN Television critic Ahsan Haque gave the episode a mixed review, stating that he did not like the improv storyline, and he was not amused with Peter's usage of Joe's American flag as toilet paper. However, he praised the scene that involved Stewie's, Brian's, Chevy Chase's, and Dan Aykroyd's travel to Russia, and he ultimately gave the episode 7.7 out of 10.

Beckett (born in Yuma, Arizona on January 3, 1953) is an American paleoanthropologist, and Professor Emeritus in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at Quinnipiac University. In 1999, he and Gerald Conlogue founded the Bioanthropology Research Institute at the university. He is a Fellow of the American Association for Respiratory Care (FAARC) and is a Fulbright Scholar Senior Specialist in Anthropology. Life Beckett began his career as a respiratory therapist and became a supervisor at Tucson General Hospital in Tucson, Arizona, in 1977. While there he was an instructor for the Pima Community College's program in respiratory care, as well as an instructor to medical interns and residents regarding topics in mechanical life support. As part of his teaching responsibilities, Beckett taught endoscopy assisting to students of respiratory therapy. Beckett began working closely with physicians, primarily pulmonologists, to develop and perfect endoscopy procedures in the medical setting. Among the procedures developed were how to maximize the yield of tissue biopsies of the human lung. In addition, Beckett was involved with developing ways to maximize both the diagnostic and therapeutic applications of endoscopy. Beckett moved to Rhode Island in 1983, where he established the first college-based program in Respiratory Care in the state at the Community College of Rhode Island. Not long after the program was accredited, Beckett moved to Hamden, Connecticut, where he became director of the bachelor's degree program in Respiratory Care at Quinnipiac University. He soon became Chairman of the department of Cardiopulmonary Sciences and Diagnostic Imaging, a position he held for 23 years. While at Quinnipiac University, Beckett developed programs in Cardiovascular Perfusion and laid the groundwork for the Graduate program for Physician Assistants. He also served as Chairman of the All-College Senate. In addition to his primary responsibilities in teaching in the cardiopulmonary sciences, Beckett taught courses in Anatomy and Physiology and Pathophysiology. During this period, Beckett also worked as a bedside Respiratory Care practitioner at Yale-New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut, where he helped guide physicians in bronchoscopic techniques on patients who were being mechanically ventilated. His interest in pulmonary medicine and xenotransplantation led him to conduct research on swine lung anatomy. With input from Conlogue, Beckett modeled the internal swine lung anatomy using vinyl and silicone molding methods. Internal examinations of the swine lung were conducted using varied endoscopic methods. In 1996 he completed his PhD in Educational Leadership with a focus on critical thinking and autonomous learning from the University of Connecticut. Following a conversation with co-author Conlogue regarding mummy research, Beckett realized the endoscopic imaging potential in bioanthropological settings. He began conducting experiments using the combination of radiography and endoscopy in the laboratory setting. Finding that the techniques were complementary, Beckett began to work with Conlogue on projects involving the paleoimaging of mummified remains in 1996. Following the initial work in the Cardiopulmonary Sciences laboratory, Beckett began to apply endoscopy in concert with radiography on the Max Uhle collection of mummies from Pachacamac Peru at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Techniques were further developed through paleoimaging projects involving mummified remains at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven, Connecticut. As Beckett and Conlogue began to present their work at professional symposia, in particular the Paleopathology Association annual meetings, it became apparent that the ‚Äòhouse call‚Äô approach to paleoimaging was greatly desired by the Bioanthropological community of scientists. Adopting the field approach, Beckett and Conlogue received many invitations to varied global locations to conduct on-site paleoimaging projects. Beckett continued to refine and develop new field techniques and skills in bioanthropological data collection using endoscopic instrumentation. In 1999, Beckett, along with Conlogue, co-founded the Bioanthropology Research Institute at Quinnipiac University. Beckett‚Äôs work with mummified remains has been featured in many television documentaries regarding paleoimaging on the Discovery and Learning Channels. Beckett and Conlogue‚Äôs field paleoimaging work caught the interest of the National Geographic Channel and they served as co-hosts for a three-year, 40 episode documentary series called The Mummy Road Show. Their work with National Geographic took them to over 13 countries conducting paleoimaging research on mummified remains and artifacts. In 2005, they published Mummy Dearest (Lyons Press), a behind the scenes look and in depth account of their experiences producing the series. In the fall of 2009 CRC Press published their second book, Paleoimaging, Field Applications for Cultural Remains and Artifacts. Beckett has developed and teaches academic courses in Mummy Science. He continues to be an invited speaker at many universities as well as at domestic and international scientific symposia. He continues to conduct paleoimaging research and gives public presentations for museums and civic organizations.

Initially released on July 3rd, 2009, and later re-released for Steam on July 4th, 2014, it was voted to be released through Steam Greenlight on 16 October 2012. The game presents itself in a dystopian setting, with inspiration drawn from Akira, Deus Ex and Ghost in the Shell for its art-style, music and aesthetics. Gameplay The player fires an HRV ZR68C assault rifle at the enemy team. NeoTokyo uses a round-based structure similar to Counter-Strike, with players only respawning between rounds. Three character classes are available, differing from each other in speed, health and available weaponry. Each class has a different auxiliary vision mode (light amplification, motion detection and thermal vision) with the two lightest classes possessing thermal and optical cloaking. The gameplay of NeoTokyo is slow-paced and balanced towards the tactical approach, with players generally being able to dispose of each other with a single burst of concentrated fire. The map design reflects this, with most maps giving numerous opportunities for ambushes and flanking. NeoTokyo has two game-types: Team Deathmatch (TDM), and Capture The Ghost (CTG), with the majority of maps designed for the latter. Capture The Ghost is similar to one-flag CTF, with two teams competing to pick up the Ghost (a dismembered gynoid torso) and carry it to a designated 'retrieval zone' on the other side of the map. Unlike regular CTF, a team can also win the round by eliminating the other team. The Ghost is useful for this as it allows the player carrying it (and only that player) to see the position of the still remaining enemy team members, even through walls. In-game VoIP communication and a compass allows a Ghost carrier to communicate this information to their own team. While carrying the Ghost brings great benefits to a team, there are severe downsides to picking up the Ghost. With the Ghost's exact location visible to everyone at all times, a carrier's position is instantly revealed to the enemy team. Being required to drop their primary weapon before being able to pick it up and being unable to sprint are just some of the severe disadvantages of picking up the Ghost. Plot NeoTokyo is set in Tokyo, approximately 30 years in the future. After the failure of a proposal to alter the Japanese constitution to allow foreign deployment of Japanese soldiers, a military coup d'√©tat is attempted by extreme Japanese nationalist factions in the Japan Self-Defense Forces. In response, the Prime Minister of Japan pools former military intelligence operatives and police officers into a sub-group of the Interior Ministry's National Security Force (NSF), called Group Six, to seek out subsequent coup plotters and uphold the law in both domestic and international soil. Immediately, rumours surface that an unknown faction in the JGSDF's special forces unit \\"Jinrai\\" is preparing for another coup attempt against the government. According to the information, the said members of this group are from Special Operations Group 43, fierce ultranationalists determined to succeed with the coup once more. The ensuing strife between these two factions sets the backdrop for the game. Development NeoTokyo has been in development since October 2004. Originally designed as a mod for Unreal Tournament 2004 as a deathmatch game with capture points, NeoTokyo's development was later switched to Valve's 2006 Source engine, where the game was remade from scratch and released in 2009. Ghost in the Shell and Akira were cited as main sources of inspiration behind the game's art style and cyberpunk aesthetic. The Radi-8 team ceased development of the game soon after its release on the Steam platform, however, remaining fans have attempted multiple times to revive the game with community content. Many are full rewrites or reworks of the game, such as rewriting the game in a newer branch of the Source Engine. Soundtrack The soundtrack of NeoTokyo was composed by Ed Harrison, and was described as \\"haunting\\" by Jeff Fleming of Game Set Watch. After being recruited from a forum, he also contributed to early sound design before focusing entirely on music. A soundtrack CD was released through CD Baby. He has since self-released the album as a free digital download. Reception NeoTokyo was featured in the \\"Mod World\\" section of the September 2009 issue of Game Informer. The game has also been featured on gaming website Kotaku, where it was stated that the game \\"looks completely amazing.\\" It won second place for the 2008 Upcoming Mod of the Year Award. In February 2010, NeoTokyo placed third in Mod DB's competition for mod of the year. In August 2012, Glasseater, the lead tester for NeoTokyo, placed an entry for the game in the Steam Greenlight. The game quickly became popular, ranking among the top 15 games on Greenlight. The following October the game was approved, eventually seeing release on the Steam platform on 4 July 2014. Since its Steam release, NeoTokyo's player counts have declined drastically. Besides during semi-organized events on Friday each week, the game servers will generally be dead at any given time. Sequel In July 2019, Neotokyo community leader Rain began work on an open-source reimplementation of Neotokyo in the Source 2013 engine. This project is currently being worked on, and is funded through a Patreon. The goal of the project is to allow the community to maintain and expand the game despite the absence of the original development team, rather than to create an actual sequel.

History   1980s  The band was formed in 1986, by Boban Petroniƒá (bass guitar, vocals), who previously worked with Vrisak Generacije, Fritz (guitar), and Pavke (drums), and having intensively rehearsed, they recorded their first demo recording, the song \\"Za Novi Sad\\" (\\"For Novi Sad\\"), the following year, at Pavke's Studio M. Due to the audience positive reactions to the recordings, the band, in an altered lineup, which featured Petroniƒá (vocals), ƒåeta (bass guitar), and P.J. (drums), and Slobodan Fekete \\"Barbun\\" (guitar), started performing, mainly in clubs. The selected recordings from the performances from this period were later released on the band's first official demo recording Oi Ain't Dead, released in early 1990 by the Belgrade record label Predskazanje Records. The demo, available only on compact cassette, beside live recordings, also featured studio material, recorded at the Barbaro and Matrix studios.Ritam Nereda history at the official site  1990s  The recordings from the debut studio album, Nikog nema (There Is No One), released in 1991, was sent to many European record labels, eventually being released in 1991 by German label Dim Records in LP and CD formats. The album, with live versions of \\"Skinheads\\" and \\"Sama\\" (\\"Alone\\"), was released in Serbia by Ghost House Records. Due to the worldwide catalog sales of the album, the band appeared on several various artists compilations, and was charted on several independent European top lists. The album was promoted live in major Serbian cities, including Novi Sad, Belgrade and Kragujevac. After the album release, the band got another guitar player, Milan Krajnoviƒá \\"ƒÜomi\\", a former Mr Joint and Lo≈° Spoj member. The new lineup recorded the second studio album, Breaking, released by the German record label Walzwerk Records, and the funds from the album sales were used for humanitarian purposes, helping children endangered by the Yugoslav Wars. Before the album release, the German authorities took over the album recordings, claiming that the label was breaking the economic sanctions imposed to Yugoslavia by the United Nations, but, after a compromise, made with the help of UNICEF, the album release was allowed. Beside the songs with lyrics in Serbian language, including the hit \\"Put beznaƒëa\\" (\\"Road of Despair\\"), the album featured five songs with English language lyrics. The album was also released in Serbia, entitled Razbijanje (Breaking), and was released by Music YUser, available on compact cassette only, and featuring lyrics entirely in Serbian language. After the album release, P.J. left the band, being replaced by former Annathema drummer Miodrag Balaban \\"Stavra\\", and the new lineup recorded the live album Pogo Live, featuring material recorded live at the Belgrade KST, Studio M, and the Novi Sad Spens Sports Center, during the late 1994. At the time, the band often got invitations to perform at various European festivals, however, due to the visa issues, the band did not perform abroad. However, the lineup did not last long as, in 1996, both Balaban and ƒåeta left the band, being replaced by bassist Kiƒáa and P.J, who returned to the band. The lineup recorded the album Zvuci bola (Sounds of Pain), with lyrics dealing with the current political situation in the country. The band recorded promotional videos for the songs \\"Tuƒëi glasovi\\" (\\"Other Voices\\") and \\"Va≈° svet\\" (\\"Your World\\"). On early November 1997, at the time of conflicts of Romani people and skinheads in Belgrade, the band's performance at the Belgrade Studentski kulturni centar was nearly canceled, because band was accused, by the state media, for spreading hatred and racism.

Gulella systemanaturae was described by Adolph Cornelis van Bruggen in 2008 based on collections from 1975 in Royal Museum for Central Africa, Tervuren, Belgium and 1985 collection in Nationaal Natuurhistorisch Museum, Leiden. The specific name systemanaturae was given in honor of the 250th anniversary of the publication of Linnaeus‚Äô book, Systema Naturae.  Distribution  The type locality is Dedza Mountain in Dedza District in South-Central Malawi.  Shell description  Gulella systemanaturae is characterized by a medium-sized shell with little prominent costulation, seven to seven and three-quarter whorls and fourfold apertural dentition consisting of angular lamella, labral process, and outer and inner columellar processes; labrum sharply angulate at its point of attachment to the body whorl near the angular lamella. The shell is medium- sized, cylindriform to subcylindriform, greatest width at about the middle of the shell, glossy and transparent when fresh, with narrowly open umbilicus to more or less rimate. Spire produced, sides straight to very slightly convex and (sub)parallel, apex obtusely conical. Whorls seven to seven and three- quarters, very slightly convex, covered with fairly close, straight, oblique and little prominent costulae, interstices wider than (at most as wide as) costulae, smooth but with clear traces of spiral sculpture, apical whorls smooth with faint traces of spiral engraving; sutures fairly shallow to somewhat incised, crenellate. Labrum incrassate and reflected, sharply angulate at its point of attachment to the body whorl near the angular lamella. The aperture is fairly large, roughly triangular in shape, little obstructed by fourfold dentition: a strong, almost perpendicular, inrunning angular lamella, (almost) free from apex of labrum; a more or less horizontal, triangular mid-labral process, protruding as far as angular lamella, corresponding to noticeable outside depression; a small, but noticeable superficial tubercle above or on the middle of the columella; a deeply situated, little prominent, almost vertical, inside columellar process. The width of the shell is 3.2-3.6 mm. The height of the shell is 7.1-8.2 mm. The ratio length/major diameter of shells is 2.05-2.50. The length of the last whorl is 3.7-4.2 mm. The height of the aperture is 2.4-3.0 mm. The width of the aperture is 2.1-2.5 mm. The shell has 7-7¬æ whorls. The species is particularly characterized by its double columellar processes in the apertural dentition, a splendid discriminating character in shell morphology in this group. In addition, the labrum is sharply angulate at its point of attachment to the body whorl near the angular lamella. This may be an overlooked character as this has not been checked or noticed in other taxa with similar types of shell until the type description of Gulella systemanaturae. Also, sometimes the labrum is very slightly concave where it joins the body whorl on the columellar side.  Anatomy  Gulella systemanaturae has red tentacles and cream body. Other detail on anatomy is so far undescribed.  Habitat  Gulella systemanaturae was found in leaf litter in Syzygium forest in the Dedza Mountain in altitudes approximately from 1700 m to 2100 m above sea level. According to Chapman & White (1970)Chapman J. D. & White F. (1970). The evergreen forests of Malawi. Commonwealth Forestry Institute, University of Oxford. 1-190 pp., p. 147. all localities where the Gulella systemanaturae has been found are above the Brachystegia woodland belt. Chapman & White (1970: 147-151) well described forest habitats of Dedza Mountain. The colour photo on the top of p. 34 in Dowsett-Lemaire & Dowsett (2006)Dowsett-Lemaire F. & Dowsett R. J. (2006). The birds of Malawi. An atlas and handbook. Tauraco Press & Aves, Li√®ge, 1-556 pp. gives a good impression of the area, depicting ‚ÄúLow-canopy montane forest near the summit of Dedza Mountain (2150 m).‚Äù. In view of the geographic position of Dedza Mountain it is not unlikely for the species to occur in neighbouring Mozambique as well.

It is the official international humanitarian agency of the Catholic community in the United States. The agency provides assistance to people in 99 countries and territories based on need, regardless of race, nationality or creed. Catholic Relief Services is a member of Caritas Internationalis, a confederation of 162 Catholic relief, development and social service organizations operating in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. Caritas Internationalis is the official humanitarian agency of the global Catholic Church. CRS has worked in Pakistan since 1954. CRS Pakistan has enhanced its emergency activities to respond to the drought, the Afghan refugee crisis and earthquake emergency response and rebuilding process. The CRS office is located in Islamabad and has 227 staff. Work in Pakistan CRS promotes peace, justice and reconciliation by improving access to food and credit, and by increasing the capacity of community-based organizations. CRS fosters harmony and collaboration between people of different faiths, supports education and human capacity development, and assists those unable to provide for themselves. Pakistan has issues regarding poverty, poor access to health care and education, and inadequate hygiene facilities. Working with local partner organizations and Caritas, CRS has implemented four strategic objectives to achieve their goal to serve the communities affected by the 2005 earthquake: * Earthquake-affected families live in a secure environment in their community of origin * Earthquake-affected communities have improved access to water and sanitation facilities * Earthquake-affected children have resumed their primary education in their communities of origin * Earthquake-affected communities have resumed their livelihoods In addition, CRS has strengthened its focus on nonformal education, care and support to people living with HIV and AIDS, and teaching people how to support themselves in the long term in drought-prone areas. Some specific examples of the other work include: Drought Mitigation Program The U.S. Department of Agriculture funds this program, which is serving over 21,000 individuals in the provinces of Sindh and Balochistan. The program improves people's access to water for consumption and production, with a particular emphasis on the role of women. Nonformal Education This program improves education opportunities for out-of-school children and adolescents in four provinces by developing stronger parent- teacher associations; creating nonformal schools to serve older and otherwise marginalized children, and training teachers in modern, participatory education methods. Recognition On 21 September 2006, Pakistan President General Pervez Musharraf presented Catholic Relief Services with the prestigious Sitara-i-Eisaar (Star of Sacrifice) award honoring the agency's response to the devastating 2005 earthquake. The 7.6 magnitude earthquake that struck on 8 October 2005, killed an estimated 73,000 people in Pakistan and left nearly 3 million homeless. In the past year, CRS has provided more than 166,000 people with emergency supplies, shelter, education, water and sanitation materials, and livelihood support. The CRS President Ken Hackett, personally accepted the award during a ceremony at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington DC. With more than 50 years experience working in Pakistan, CRS was among the first agencies to respond. To date, CRS has repaired or opened 130 schools, provided support for semi-permanent shelters for 130,000 people, built latrines and washrooms for 89,000 people, restored water sources for more than 18,000 people and helped tens of thousands restart their economic livelihoods. With private and public funds totaling more than $32 million, CRS assistance in Pakistan is one of the largest disaster response efforts in the agency's history. Current situation The agency lost its license in 2018 when thousands of non-governmental organisations' licenses were revoked allegedly to prevent terrorist organisations from receiving funding.UCANews December 17, 2019 References Category:Catholic Church in Pakistan Category:Charities based in Pakistan ","title":"Catholic Relief Services, Pakistan"},{"id":"24451115","title":"Kim Min-jung (actress)"},{"id":"24451123","text":"Bassetts is an unincorporated community in Sierra County, California, United States.

Hanna (July 1, 1903 ‚Äì December 23, 1993, known as \\"Jack\\" Hanna) was a University of California-Davis agronomy professor who helped revolutionize the tomato-growing industry. He won the John Scott Award in 1976 for his development of a tomato variety capable of being machine-harvested.John Scott Award Award Recipients 1971-1980, accessed 29 September 2009 The variety came to be known as the \\"square tomato,\\" being slightly blockier, preventing it from rolling off conveyor belts.Columbus Dispatch, 25 March 2008, Shape shifting Career Harvestable tomato variety In the early 1940s, California‚Äôs tomato industry was threatened due to a lack of laborers to harvest the crops. In response, the UC Davis Agricultural Engineering department developed a mechanical tomato harvester. Unfortunately, the machine crushed the tomatoes. The University of California-Davis's Vegetable Crops department, led by Hanna, came to the rescue by breeding a firmer-skinned tomato. However, he was tight-lipped about much of his early work. ‚ÄúWhen he first began trying to breed such a tomato in 1942, Hanna kept his idea to himself, unsure of what others at the university would think of it‚Äù.UC Davis Plant Sciences, Major Figures in the History of Plant Breeding at UC Davis: Gordie (\\"Jack\\") C. Hanna , accessed 29 September 2009 ‚ÄúPerhaps for good reason: when his concept started to circulate, it was met with little support, in terms of both its technical feasibility and its anticipated negative impact on California agricultural labor.‚Äù Hanna's creation, variety VF145, became known as the square tomato, not because it was really square, but because its blockier shape prevented it from rolling off conveyor belts. Tomato harvester The development of the world‚Äôs first mechanical harvesting tomato wasn‚Äôt Hanna‚Äôs only contribution to tomato production. With the harvestable tomato in hand, in 1961 he teamed up with UC Davis agricultural engineer Coby Lorenzen (who also won the John Scott Award in 1976) to develop a harvester to reap the hardier variety of tomato. Engineering the equipment was no small challenge because tomato harvesting requires multiple functions, including cutting and lifting the vines, then separating the tomatoes from the vines.UC Tomato Harvester Designated as Historic Landmark, UC Davis News & Information, Oct. 27, 2005 During the 1950s, the UC Davis team refined the experimental harvester and in 1959 convinced a California company, Blackwelder Manufacturing, to commercialize the design. Within three years of its introduction, the proportion of California's tomato acreage planted with mechanically harvestable tomatoes rose from 7 percent to 85 percent. While mechanical harvesting was initially controversial because it seemingly displaced human labor, it reduced harvesting costs by nearly one half and eliminated an economic constraint on the US processing tomato industry, resulting in large increases in tomato acreage and yield. Those increases, in turn, provided additional employment in field work, transportation and processing that more than offset the displaced harvesting jobs. Hanna also bred most of California‚Äôs disease-resistant asparagus and developed several internationally produced sweet potato varieties.

The Colombian government-funded Colombia is Passion advertisement campaign as an attempt to improve Colombia's image abroad, with mixed results hoping for more positive views on Colombia. Aside from the Colombia is passion campaign, Soccer has been known for being a major part in creating positive views as perhaps the most important to Colombians. Movies Depictions of Colombia in foreign films Failings in the background research and the reproduction of the country are very common in films depicting Colombia. Some of these mistakes include showing Bogot√° or Medell√≠n as sylvatic or coastal regions, using Mexican or Puerto Rican actors (with noticeable accents), Mexican costumes, anachronisms and a general inaccuracy regarding the depiction of how the conflicts between government and drug-trading cartels work. Some examples of fictional Colombian settings are: * Bedazzled: The Devil makes Brendan Fraser¬¥s character a Colombian Drug Lord, loosely resembling Pablo Escobar. Most of the Spanish phrases are at times very hard to make out, and with a lot of grammar and pronunciation mistakes. Traditional Spanish music is heard in the background, not Colombian. Beginning with the butler, almost everyone speaks with a clear Spanish accent and slang, and certain elements belong to the Spanish culture, like the \\"Bota bag\\", the traditional leather bag in the shape of a boot, used to drink alcoholic beverages. Medell√≠n is depicted as a tropical jungle. * Behind Enemy Lines: Colombia: 2009 war film about a brigade of United States Navy SEALs mounting an attack on Colombian special forces to clear their names and rescue a hostage. Peruvian folk songs are heard in the background including \\"Mi Llamita\\". Filming locations were actually in Puerto Rico. * Blow: 2001 drama/biopic film about the American cocaine smuggler George Jung. It is based on the real-life stories of George Jung, Pablo Escobar, Carlos Lehder, and the Medell√≠n Cartel. * Clear and Present Danger Jack Ryan is appointed Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Acting Deputy Director and discovers that he is being kept in the dark by colleagues who are conducting a covert war against Cali Cartel drug lords in Colombia. Filming locations were actually in Quito, Ecuador and Cuernavaca, Mexico. The Colombian drug lord lives in \\"Tepoztlan\\" Hotel (aztec word). In the backgrounds can be seen a billboard of Mexican politician Luis Donaldo Colosio, and a portrait of Mexican statesman Miguel Lerdo de Tejada. * Collateral Damage: Gordon Brewer (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger), looks to avenge his son's and wife's deaths at the hands of a guerrilla commando, by traveling to Colombia. Gordy enters Colombia through the Dari√©n Gap. This Gap is in the Colombian department called Choc√≥, the most Afro-Colombian populated region of the country. However, throughout the whole movie, a black person is never shown. The National Police of Colombia and army forces use blue uniforms, instead the green they actually use. The accent of the native \\"Colombians\\" is actually Mexican. There is a scene of a soccer match, between America and Chivas, two popular teams from Mexico which are mistakenly set in Colombia. * Colombiana: In the film, Cataleya Restrepo (Zoe Saldana) is a Colombian who had her parents killed in Bogot√° by a drug lord (Beto Benites) and his partner (Jordi Moll√†) when she was nine years old. She goes to her criminal uncle (Cliff Curtis) in Chicago and is trained as an assassin to try to get revenge. Filming was done in Mexico, Chicago, New Orleans and France and the use of the Cattleya orchid was depicted in the film. * Lord of War: Nicolas Cage plays an illegal arms dealer, which during a business deal with a Colombian drug lord, gets paid in cocaine instead of cash. Again, the accent and slang words used by the 'Colombian' drug lord are Mexican. * Mr. & Mrs. Smith: A couple of assassins tell the story of their first meeting in Bogot√°, Colombia, where they met during a crossfire, while both were secretly on the run from Colombian authorities. The film depicts Bogot√°, the capital of Colombia as a small town, when in reality Bogot√° is one of the biggest and most populous cities in Latin America. Also, Bogot√° is portrayed as a warm/hot city while in reality it is located over the Andean cordilleras and has an average temperature of 58 ¬∞F all year long and has an altitude of . Filming locations were actually in California. * Bruce almighty: In the morning, Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) states \\"I'd better manifest some coffee\\", and uses his god powers to conjure fictional Colombian coffee icon character Juan Valdez who pours him a cup of coffee while stating his enjoyment for fresh grown coffee in the hills of Colombia. * Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection: Colonel Scott McCoy (Chuck Norris) fights against Colombian drug lord Ramon Cota (Billy Drago), the richest drug kingpin in the world, who controls the cocaine industry with an iron fist. Filming locations were actually in the Philippines. * Love in the Time of Cholera: 2007 motion picture directed by Mike Newell. Based on the novel of the same name by Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, it tells the story of a love triangle between Fermina Daza (played by Giovanna Mezzogiorno) and her two suitors, Florentino Ariza (Javier Bardem) and Doctor Juvenal Urbino (Benjamin Bratt), which spans 50 years, from 1880 to 1930. It was filmed in Colombian locations. * The Specialist: Ray Quick (Sylvester Stallone) and Ned Trent (James Woods), CIA explosives experts, are in charge of a mission to blow up a South American drug dealer. Filming locations were actually in Miami. * Romancing the Stone: Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) is a romance novelist who receives a package from her dead brother-in-law Eduardo, who was recently murdered and dismembered in Colombia. Her widowed sister, Elaine (Mary Ellen Trainor) calls Joan and begs her to come to Colombia with the package; Elaine has been kidnapped, and the package is the ransom. Though supposedly set in Colombia, all the Hispanic actors speak with a distinct Mexican accent. The supposed Colombian jungle features non-Colombian animals such as Australian Sulphur crested cockatoos. Filming locations were actually in Xalapa, Mexico. * xXx: Xander Cage (Vin Diesel), is a law-breaking extreme sports enthusiast, which is dropped in a cocaine-producing area of rural Colombia, where Xander is captured, tied, gagged and tortured by Colombian drug lord \\"El Jefe\\" (Danny Trejo). Filming locations were actually in California. * Miami Vice: Posing as drug smugglers \\"Sonny Burnett\\" and \\"Rico Cooper\\", Miami-Dade Police detectives James Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs offer their services to a Colombian cartel.

Depictions of Colombia in Colombian films Child on the street, screenshot from Gamin film by Ciro Duran, 1978 The mainstream of Colombian cinema follows the trend of the foreign cinema, depicting mostly narcotrafficking related issues, hit men stories, and films with a high content of poverty and human misery. Criticism of this type of film-making argued that these films did not treat their subject with profoundness, instead taking a superficial approach to the issues.

The story was originally published in 1984 in volume two of Barker's Books of Blood short story collections. Plot At a small college, Quaid and his friend Stephen do a \\"fear study\\" as a school project, recording people talking about their greatest fears. Quaid, however, is quite psychopathic and wants to take the fear to 'the next level'. Quaid had seen his parents killed by an axe murderer as a child; this is his greatest fear, and he wants to learn what others dread and how they deal with it, in order to find a way to defy his own dread. Stephen's brother had died while drunk-driving, and Stephen wonders if his brother would still be alive if he had driven instead. Cheryl, who is the project's editor, was molested by her father as a little girl. He worked at a meat-packing plant and smelled of meat while molesting her; to this day, she can't stand the smell of meat and refuses to eat it. Quaid kidnaps her and locks her in a room with a slightly salted, well cooked steak on a plate. After about a week, she finally eats the entire piece of rotten beef. Joshua is a student whose fear is becoming deaf again because he temporarily lost his hearing after a childhood accident. The following night, Quaid knocks him out and fires a gun next to his ears, shattering his eardrums and leaving him deaf again. Abby, another student, has a dark birthmark covering half her face and body, which she doesn't want anyone to see, terrified of being teased or shunned because of it. Quaid sets up video footage of her stripping naked before sex on every TV on campus, showing her naked and covered in birth marks. Humiliated, Abby fills her bathtub with bleach and starts scrubbing off her skin with steel wool. Stephen finds her naked and bleeding and gets her to the hospital. He then goes after Quaid with a fire axe. Joshua follows him, assuming Stephen and Quaid are working together. When Stephen confronts Quaid, Stephen is knocked out and awakens tied to a chair. He manages to break free but runs into Joshua, who stabs him with the fire axe. Quaid shoots Joshua, killing him, and watches Stephen die from the axe wound. He drags the body to a room in the basement, where Cheryl is. He throws Stephen's body in along with a switchblade and says, \\"Let's see how hungry you have to be to get through that.\\" He leaves her crying with Stephen's dead body with only a matter of time before she starts eating his flesh from hunger. Cast * Jackson Rathbone as Stephen Grace * Shaun Evans as Quaid * Hanne Steen as Cheryl Fromm * Laura Donnelly as Abby * Jonathan Readwin as Joshua Shaw * Paloma Faith as Clara Thornhill * Siobhan Hewlett as Quaid's mother Production The 104 page script was shot in just 28 days. The paintings in the film were created by Nicole Balzarini. Release The film had its world premiere at the 2009 Montreal Fantasia Festival, where it picked up a distributor in After Dark Films. It was announced that Dread would be included in the films in the fourth After Dark Horrorfest in 2010. The film was released on 29 January 2010 in US Cinemas. Reception Allan Dart of Fangoria called it \\"a mixed but overall positive\\" adaptation of Barker's story. Scott Weinberg of Fearnet called it \\"a clever balancing act between basic scares, a creepy concept, and something a little more (dare I say) cerebral.\\" Paul McCannibal of Dread Central rated it 4/5 stars and called it \\"a well made adaptation of the short story\\" that \\"is well worth your time.\\" Dennis Harvey of Variety said that the film \\"intrigues, even if it doesn‚Äôt entirely satisfy\\". Noel Murray of The A.V. Club called it \\"overwritten and more than a little pretentious\\". Brett Cullum of DVD Verdict called it a good Barker adaptation that is \\"certainly worth checking out\\".

Plot Cousteau is narrating about the ocean. As he starts talking about coral reefs, Dory starts bothering him by entering the frame. The scene then cuts to an anemone that Nemo and Marlin come out of and Cousteau sighs for not being able to do his documentary. The scene cuts to real cuttlefishes, which Dory tries to speak to. When Cousteau tells Dory to stop it, the scene cuts to a live Spanish dancer. This makes Marlin think of dancing and soon all three animated fish are dancing to some music. This infuriates Cousteau so much that he yells \\"Stop!\\" and proceeds to make a quick rant about the water cycle, concluding that \\"Everyone, everywhere, affects the ocean!\\". Dory expresses amazement and at first, Cousteau is satisfied, but when it is revealed that she was listening to the echo inside a conch shell, Cousteau loses his temper and starts ranting in French. For about six seconds, a cartoon still image of Cousteau in a swimming suit appears while Musak-style music plays, on a title card which reads \\"Please Stand By\\". When Cousteau comes back, however, he has calmed down and talks with the three fish about coral that have suffered from coral bleaching, while the whitened coral appears on screen. The next topic is coral reproduction. Dory frantically swims to every new egg to say \\"Happy Birthday\\", Marlin paternally covers Nemo's eyes and Cousteau talks about how there are so many eggs, that even the hungriest fish cannot possibly eat all of them. He concludes by talking all about how we must all work hard in order to preserve the beauty of the coral reef. Suddenly, Nemo and the other two fish interrupt him, inadvertently summarizing the message of the entire film during their arguing. Jean-Michel gets mad again and the camera cuts to him aboard his boat by night. Humiliated that he has been \\"up-staged by fish\\", Cousteau mutters that \\"this would have never happened to Papa.\\" In a before-credits scene, Nemo tells the viewer about Jean-Michel Cousteau's website: oceanfutures.org.

H7 was the royal cypher of the Norwegian head of state, King Haakon VII, who reigned from 1905 to 1957. When Germany invaded Norway in 1940 as a part of World War II, the royal family fled the country and Haakon VII later spearheaded the Norwegian resistance in-exile in the United Kingdom. H7 became one of several symbols used by the Norwegian populace to mark solidarity with and loyalty to the King, and adherence to the Norwegian resistance movement. World War II According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Bj√∏rn Tore Godal, speaking at the 50th anniversary for Victory in Europe Day, Norway was the only country in which the initials of the head of state became a resistance symbol. The monogram, with H superimposed on 7, was drawn on fences, walls, houses, roads, in the snow and otherwise in the public sphere. It was also used in illegal art. Coins with the H7 symbol were also attached to clothes. Such coins were confiscated by the Nazi authorities. It was also used in the private sphere, among others on the inside of blinds. A symbol used in a similar way was the \\"V for victory\\", as popularised by Winston Churchill. However, the Axis attempted to usurp this sign, supposedly with the new meaning of \\"V for Viktoria\\". While this campaign was successful in most of Nazi-occupied Europe, it failed in Norway: Despite continued official use, the opposition also adopted the V-sign as an abbreviation of ' (German for \\"to lose\\"), and filled in the Nazi V's with the H7 monogram. In fact, this popularized the use of H7, which was soon drawn without the V. The act of drawing or creating a H7 symbol in German-occupied Norway was punishable by imprisonment. Another possible sanction was terror from Nazi paramilitary groups, to which the police were ordered not to respond. Post-war use The symbol was also evoked after World War II to have a commemorative effect, among others at the first post-war Holmenkollen ski jump event, when the symbol was formed in large scale by people. It was also used on post-war coins. Gallery File:Norway 1 Krone 1940 obverse H7 monogram.jpg|A 1940 Norwegian krone featuring the H7 monogram.

He is the first man from the Czech Republic to join the professional sport in Japan. He reached the third highest makushita division in 2004, but due to his light weight he had difficulty in regularly beating his opponents, despite his skill. However, in May 2011 he finally earned promotion to the sekitori ranks. After becoming only the third new sekitori since 1958 to pass through j≈´ry≈ç division in just one tournament, he made his debut in the top makuuchi division in September 2011. He retired on 24 July 2014. Early life and sumo background In 2012 Bojar practised judo in the Czech Republic before becoming interested in sumo. Sumo is more popular in the Czech Republic than in any other European country, with ten sumo clubs containing some 600 members, and he was trained by Jaroslav Po≈ô√≠z, president of the Czech Sumo Association. After winning the bronze medal in the 2000 Junior World Sumo Championships in Tokyo, he was accepted by Naruto stable, a heya in Chiba run by former yokozuna Takanosato. After passing the physical exam, he made his official debut in November 2001. Professional career He was given the shikona of Takanoyama, meaning \\"noble mountain.\\" He reached the sandanme division in January 2003, and the third highest makushita division in March 2004. He fell back to sandanme after only two tournaments but returned to makushita in March 2005 and largely remained there for the next six years, unable to break through to the elite sekitori ranks. Takanoyama was hampered mostly by an inability to put on weight. His height of and weight of make him among the lightest sumo wrestlers in the modern era. In November 2008 he climbed as high as makushita 13, beating his previous high of makushita 15 set in November 2005, and he moved up to makushita 9 in January 2009. After compiling a 5‚Äì2 record in the July tournament, which included a win over the former maegashira Ry≈´h≈ç, he reached a new highest rank of makushita 4 in September 2009. He produced another good score of 5‚Äì2 in May 2010 from makushita 6, which included wins over J≈´monji and H≈çchiyama. In January 2011 a 6‚Äì1 score saw him promoted to a new highest rank of makushita 2 for the May \\"technical examination tournament.\\" There he scored 5‚Äì2, guaranteeing promotion to the j≈´ry≈ç division for July. When the banzuke was released on June 27, Takanoyama was at #5 West, the tenth highest rank in the 26 man division. It took him 57 tournaments from his professional debut to reach j≈´ry≈ç, the second slowest among foreign born wrestlers after the Brazilian Wakaazuma. He had a successful j≈´ry≈ç debut, winning seven of his first eight bouts and finishing on 10-5. This earned him immediate promotion to the top makuuchi division for the September 2011, only the third time since the six tournaments a year system was established in 1958 that a j≈´ry≈ç debutant has achieved this (the other two were Daikiko and Ichihara). Weighing in before the tournament at just , he is the first wrestler under 100 kilos in the top division since Mainoumi in 1997. Takanoyama had a difficult start to his makuuchi career, losing his first five matches and then only winning the sixth when his opponent inadvertently stepped out of the ring first (isamiashi). However, he picked up a legitimate win on Day 7, downing the 166 kg Yoshiazuma with a hooking inner thigh throw (kakenage) and instantly becoming a favourite with the tournament crowd. He finished on 5‚Äì10, which sent him back to j≈´ry≈ç in November, but he responded with a 9‚Äì6 record which returned him immediately to the top division for the January 2012 tournament. He was unable to produce a kachi-koshi score in either January or March, but in the May tournament he managed an 11‚Äì4 record in j≈´ry≈ç which earned him a 2nd place and a return to the makuuchi division in the July tournament. However he had yet to earn a winning record in five tournaments in makuuchi and was demoted to j≈´ry≈ç once again for November. His 7‚Äì8 record in July 2013 was his seventh consecutive losing score, pushing him towards the bottom of the j≈´ry≈ç division. In September 2013, he finished on 5‚Äì10, his weakest performance in j≈´ry≈ç so far, which sent him back to makushita 2 for the November tournament. Afterwards, he skirted the border between the two divisions, being relegated twice and promoted twice. Retirement from sumo Takanoyama announced his retirement on Day 12 of the July 2014 tournament, where he had withdrawn after losing his first match, guaranteeing a large fall down the makushita division. He said, \\"I mount the dohyo to win, and I can no longer win.\\" He indicated that he would return to the Czech Republic with his family, and try to make use of his Japanese language skills. Takanoyama's danpatsu-shiki or retirement ceremony was held at his stable on 7 September 2014. Fighting style Takanoyama during the May 2014 tournament Due to his exceptionally light frame, Takanoyama relied heavily on throws to defeat his much heavier opponents. His most common winning kimarite was uwatenage, or overarm throw, followed by shitatenage (underarm throw) and kakenage (hooking inner thigh throw). He had knowledge of a wide variety of techniques, having used at least 37 different winning kimarite in his career. Personal life In an effort to improve his understanding of Japanese culture, Takanoyama devoted his spare time to watching historical dramas and reading manga. After reaching j≈´ry≈ç, he returned to the Czech Republic in the summer of 2011 for the first time since leaving ten years earlier. After the September 2011 tournament, he announced his engagement to a 32-year-old domestic helper from Chiba Prefecture. The couple's first child, a girl, was born in May. Takanoyama became a sekitori at around the same time as (temporarily) breaking through the 100 kg barrier, and attributed his gain in weight to the Naruto Oyakata (and the stablemaster's wife) giving him special dishes and snacks at night. However, in November 2011, he was given a warning by the Sumo Association for injecting himself with insulin that had been prescribed to his stablemaster.

He was sired by Roberto by breeder Joan Phillips. Brian's Time was a grade one stakes-winning millionaire who is probably most remembered for his win in the Florida Derby and a solid runner-up finish to Dual Classic winner Risen Star in the 1988 Preakness Stakes.Pedigee Online, Thoroughbred Database website; He later became a very successful breeding stallion in Japan.  Early career  Brian's Time was a late bloomer and raced only twice as a two-year-old, breaking his maiden in his second attempt. The Roberto colt placed second at Gulfstream Park in a very strong field of sophomores in an allowance race in the winter of his three-year-old season, so his trainer, John M. Veitch, gave him a shot in the grade two Fountain of Youth Stakes. In that race, he faced stakes winners and colts that had won three to five previous starts. He finished fourth, but came back to race in a grade one Florida Derby against ten other three-year-old colts. He won against stiff competition, including Forty Niner and Notebook. Three weeks after the Florida Derby, Brian's Time placed third in the Jim Beam Stakes at Turfway Park in Florence, Kentucky. His trainer and his owner, Joan Phillips, were encouraged by his Florida Derby finish and decided to enter him in the 114th Kentucky Derby in 1988. In that race, Brian's Time broke poorly and was badly outrun going into the first turn, being bumped several times in close quarters. He was dead last in the field of 17 and was forced widest of seven around the first turn. Coming out of the far turn at Churchill Downs, Brian's Time closed from seventeenth to sixth. Filly Winning Colors won that day.  Preakness Stakes  John Veitch could not dismiss his colt and his ability because of the way that he closed strongly at the end of the Derby. He also had three very good excuses as to why he got behind so early (the poor break, being bumped, and going very wide around the turn), so Veitch decided to wheel him back in three weeks into the second jewel of the Triple Crown. The three top finishers of the Derby took most of the public support in the grade one Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course. Brian's Time was a lukewarm 7-1 at post time. Eight colts and the filly broke without any problems. The top two from the Derby, Forty Niner and Winning Colors, shot out to the lead. Brian's Time sat back in seventh but was much closer than he had been in any other of his prior races. Throughout the backstretch and around the far turn, Forty Niner and Winning Colors remained in front. At the top of the stretch, a menacing Risen Star squeezed by on the rail and turned the Preakness into what looked like a romp. Risen Star finished three lengths in front of Winning Colors and 23 lengths in front of Forty Niner. Under Angel Cordero, Brian's Time closed from seventh to second, making up nine lengths in the last furlong as he passed every other horse except dual classic winner Risen Star, who won by a length. Derby winner Winning Colors held on for third, Private Terms was fourth and Forty Niner faded to seventh in the field of nine.  Later career  Later that summer, Brian's Time placed third in the Belmont Stakes, won the grade two Jim Dandy Stakes at Saratoga Race Course and finished third in the grade one Travers Stakes, also at Saratoga. Late in the year, he won the grade three Pegasus Handicap run in October at Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, New Jersey. At age four, Brian's Time raced five times and managed three third place finishes in the grade two Nassau County Handicap at seven furlongs at Belmont Park, the grade two Bernard Baruch Handicap at 1 1/8 miles on the turf at Saratoga Race Course, and the grade one Ben Ali Handicap at Keeneland.  Retirement  Brian's Time was retired after the 1989 racing season and was sold to a breeding syndicate in Japan. He was regularly one of the leading sires in that country.Pedigee Online, Thoroughbred Database website; His offspring included Narita Brian and Mayano Top Gun both of whom were voted Japanese Horse of the Year, as well as Time Paradox (Japan Cup Dirt), Sunny Brian (Japanese Derby), Tanino Gimlet (Japanese Derby), Silk Justice (Arima Kinen), Dantsu Flame (Takarazuka Kinen), Furioso (Japan Dirt Derby) and Phalaenopsis (Queen Elizabeth II Cup). On April 4, 2013, Brian's Time sustained a fractured femur in a paddock accident and was euthanized, he was 28.

Appearances In the Metal Gear series, The Boss is a legendary American soldier, founder and leader of the Cobra unit, the biological mother of Ocelot, mentor and mother figure to Naked Snake, and is known as the mother of the U.S. special forces.\\"Snakes and Gears: A Metal Gear Overview,\\" Game Informer 182 (June 2008): 108. In June 1944, during World War II, she led the Cobra unit to victory at the Battle of Normandy. The Boss appears as one of the main antagonists in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. She moved to the Soviet Union with Colonel Volgin alongside the Cobra Unit. Throughout the game, Naked Snake repeatedly encounters The Boss to kill her as ordered by his superiors. Following Volgin's death, The Boss reveals she is the daughter of one of the original members of the Philosophers behind the Philosophers' Legacy. After one final fight, Snake fights and kills The Boss who gives him the Philosophers' Legacy hidden by Volgin. The whole mission is later revealed to be a coverup by the United States so that The Boss would steal Volgin's treasure and give it to Snake but then die at his hands to avoid a conflict between America and the Soviet Union. EVA reveals in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker that The Boss infiltrated a sleeper agent into the USSR's OKB-1 from 1959 to 1961 to gather more information about the Sputnik program with a little help from the Philosophers. She was eventually commissioned into Project Mercury to test the Mercury capsule and launched into space at roughly the same time as Yuri Gagarin's flight on April 12, 1961. However, the capsule suffered heavy damage upon reentry. The Boss, dubbed within the program as the \\"Mercury Lady\\", survived the crash but was rendered comatose for six months. All evidence of her role in the program was erased, including airbrushing her out of an official picture of the Mercury astronauts, of whom she was the eighth member.EVA: Meanwhile, Washington could only grit its teeth into silence. They decided there was no value making The Boss' flight public, that it would only make matters worse. So they buried it instead, labeling it a dark mission. NASA and the CIA did everything in their power to erase all traces of the Boss from Project Mercury. The result was the photo before you. Not a bad job, huh? (Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker) The Boss's entire personality is also reconstructed in a special AI system developed by Strangelove for the Peace Walker weapon. Character design The Boss' likeness was modelled on actress Charlotte Rampling. In the finished game, she wears a pale-colored combat outfit; Kojima originally planned to have her in a blue sneaking suit similar to Solid Snake for the finale of the game, but this idea was ultimately cut. During the shooting of the final scene between The Boss and Naked Snake, Eriko Hirata (The Boss's motion capture actress), having read the script beforehand, was so moved by the scene that she broke down into tears. Hideo Kojima said in 2012, he would \\"love\\" to create a new prequel game starring The Boss as the protagonist. Reception The character was very well received by media. According to Eurogamer, \\"The Boss is often touted as being one of the strongest female characters in gaming.\\" In 2007, Tom's Games included The Boss among the 50 greatest female characters in video game history, proposing that she should be portrayed in a live-action adaptation by \\"Sharon Stone, who reportedly served as the inspiration for the character's design.\\" In 2008, Chip ranked her as the 12th top \\"girl of gaming\\". In 2011, UGO included her on their list of the 50 top \\"video game hotties\\", commenting that \\"The Boss is a bit of a tough one because we instantly find her attractive, but we can't find a hint of sexuality to her at all,\\" and adding that \\"of all the ladies on our list, she's the one we'd be the most wary to mess with.\\" That same year, GamingUnion.net included The Boss on their list of top ten video game heroines for \\"her sheer strength and determination\\", similarly commenting \\"we will simply say the Boss is one chick you do not want to mess with which is why we've given her the number 7 spot.\\"Lauren Alessandra, Top 10 Video Game Heroines , GamingUnion.net, July 17th, 2011. In 2013, Chillopedia placed this \\"heroic American martyr\\" 11th on their list of the best female video game characters ever, while Stealthy Box called her \\"arguably the single most amazing female character in all of video games.\\" That same year, The Boss was also ranked as the ninth best female protagonist in gaming by the staff of GamesTM despite her role as an antagonist.GamesTM 133, page 149. In 2014, Entertainment Weeklys Darren Franich listed her as one of 15 \\"kick-ass women in videogames\\", asserting that \\"in the gloriously crazypants pantheon of Metal Gear baddies, no one can compete with The Boss.\\" In 2008, the staff of GameSpy placed her at the top of Metal Gear boss battles. She was also included on IGN's 2008 lists of the Metal Gear series' top ten villains (ranked seventh) as well as its top ten boss battles (ranked ninth). That same year, Destructoid ranked this \\"beautiful\\" yet \\"haunting\\" battle as sixth on their list of top Metal Gear boss fights.

The grant included Fort Ross. Dise√±o del Rancho MunizMexican Land Grants in Sonoma County History The Mexican government, which had been concerned about the Russian presence at Fort Ross, was happy to see them leave in 1841, but less pleased when the Russian-American Company sold it to John Sutter. The position of the Mexican government had been that neither land nor improvements had ever belonged to the Russians and hence they could not legally be transferred to anyone else. Within two years after the purchase of Fort Ross, everything Sutter considered salvageable had been removed to his Rancho New Helvetia. In 1843, William (Wilhelm) Benitz, from Baden, Germany, became manager of Sutter's Fort Ross holdings. In 1844 Sutter leased the land to Benitz and a partner, Ernest Rufus, from W√ºrttemberg. Both Benitz and Rufus had been in Sutter's militia. That transaction again brought into question the validity of Sutter's title to the property, and Governor Manuel Micheltorena granted Rancho Bodega in part of the southern half of the former Russian claim to Captain Stephen Smith in 1844, and Governor Pio Pico granted the coastal four square league Rancho Muniz in the northern half of the former Russian claim to Manuel Torres in 1845.Ranch Era excerpted from Fort Ross, published by the Fort Ross Interpretive Association, 2001 Manuel Torres (1826‚Äì1910) was born in Lima, Peru, and came to California in 1843 on a merchant ship with his brother-in- law, Captain Stephen Smith who was married to his sister, Manuela Garcia Torres. Torres married Mariana (Maryanna) Richardson the daughter of William A. Richardson.Daughters of Spain, Mariana Richardson Manuel Torres leased Rancho Muniz to Benitz and Rufus, who also owned Rancho German on the Muniz‚Äô northern border, and in 1849, he sold the entire rancho to them. Manuel Torres later operated the Estudillo House in San Leandro, and also the Marin Hotel in San Rafael. Torres was elected to the California State Assembly in 1858-9.Bailey Millard, 1924, The San Francisco Bay Region, Vol. 3 page 279-280, The American Historical Society, Inc.Marin Pioneer Dies in Alameda, Obituary, The Marin Journal, Thursday, March 31, 1910 With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Muniz was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852,United States.

Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 Benitz and Rufus now owned approximately two thirds of the Sonoma County coastline, from the Gualala River in the north to the Russian River in the south. Rufus left the partnership in June, 1849. William Benitz took another partner, German immigrant, Charles Theodore Meyer. In 1867, John Rule bought in the southern half of the rancho.

It is visible to the naked eye as a faint, blue-white point of light with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.81. The star is moving closer to the Earth with a heliocentric radial velocity of ‚Äì12 km/s. This object is notable for being \\"a rare, nearby example of a young planetary system just entering the last phase of planet formation\\". There is uncertainty about the stellar classification of this star. It has the nominal classification of B9.5IIIe, a B-type giant star with emission lines. However, it has also been classified as an A0 II-IIIe star and as a Herbig Ae/Be star. 51 Ophiuchi is about 300,000 years old with 3.3 times the mass of the Sun and a polar radius 5.7 times the Sun's radius. It is radiating three times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 9,772 K. The star is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 267 km/s, close to the critical rotation rate. Dust and gas disk 51 Ophiuchi has a disk of dust and gas that appears to be a young debris disk and is probably a planetary system in the late stages of formation. This system resembles Beta Pictoris, a well known star with a large debris disk, in several ways: spectral type, the presence of an edge-on disk with both gas and dust, and the presence of variable blue-shifted absorption lines suggesting in-falling comets. The distance to 51 Ophiuchi is much greater than the distance to Beta Pictoris, and its debris disk is relatively compact. As a consequence, the disk around 51 Ophiuchi requires an interferometer to resolve, in contrast to that of Beta Pictoris, which has been observed using visual spectrum imaging. Recent observations of 51 Ophiuchi made with the Keck Interferometer Nuller at the W. M. Keck Observatory show that the disk has two components: a central cloud of large particles (exozodiacal dust) surrounded by a much larger cloud of small silicate particles extending to about 1,000 astronomical units. The inner disk has a radius approximately four times the distance between the sun and the Earth, with a density of around 100,000 times that of the dust in the Solar System. The spectra taken by 2020 have indicated the circumstellar disc is similar in composition to interstellar medium. The dominant species in atomic numbers are hydrogen, helium, oxygen, nitrogen, silicon and iron. Surprisingly, the disk was found to be strongly depleted of carbon and carbon monoxide.

Dise√±o del Rancho GermanMexican Land Grants in Sonoma County History The Mexican government, which had been concerned about the Russian presence at Fort Ross, was happy to see them leave in 1841, but less pleased when the Russian-American Company sold it to John Sutter. The position of the Mexican government had been that neither land nor improvements had ever belonged to the Russians and hence they could not legally be transferred to anyone else. Within two years after the purchase of Fort Ross, everything Sutter considered salvageable had been removed to his Rancho New Helvetia. In 1843, William Benitz, from Baden, Germany, became manager of Sutter's Fort Ross holdings. In 1844 Sutter leased the land to Benitz and a partner, Ernest Rufus, from W√ºrttemberg. Both Benitz and Rufus had been officers in Sutter's militia. That transaction again brought into question the validity of Sutter's title to the property.Ranch Era excerpted from Fort Ross, published by the Fort Ross Interpretive Association, 2001 In 1845 Wilhelm Benitz and Ernest Rufus petitioned the Mexican governor P√≠o Pico for a grant of five square leagues. Before the award of the land grant, Rufus invited German immigrants Frederick H√ºgal and Henry Haeger to assist him in developing the grant. Rufus, a naturalized Mexican citizen, went to Los Angeles to petition for the land, which in 1846 was granted to Rufus in his name alone. At that time, the Mexican authorities did not like making grants to multiple owners. Rufus gave one and a quarter square leagues each to H√ºgal and Haeger, leaving one and a quarter square leagues each to Benitz and Rufus. In 1849, Manuel Torres, grantee of Rancho Muniz on Rancho German's southern border, sold Rancho Muniz to Benitz and Rufus. Benitz and Rufus now owned approximately two thirds of the Sonoma county coastline, from the Walhalla (Gualala) river in the north to the Russian River in the south. Rufus left the partnership in June, 1849. William Benitz took another partner, Charles Theodore Meyer, also a German immigrant. In July, 1849, Benitz and Meyer bought out H√ºgal. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho German was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852,United States. District Court (California : Northern District) Land Case 15 ND and the grant was patented to William Benitz, Charles Meyer, Carlos F. Glein, Joshua Hendy, and Samuel M. Duncan in 1872. Report of the Surveyor General 1844‚Äì1886 Samuel Duncan and Joshua Hendy established a sawmill on the ridge behind Salt Point, in 1853. In 1855 Joshua Hendy sold his share to Alexander Duncan, brother of Samuel. Before the official survey was made, Glein, Hendy, and Duncan sold their shares of the rancho to Henry B. Platt. However the official survey area of the rancho was about four square leagues - less than the five square leagues of the original grant. This led to several lawsuits adjusting boundaries.Platt vs Jones, 1872, Reports of cases determined in the Supreme Court of the State of California, Volume 43, California Supreme Court, Bancroft-Whitney Company, pp219-224Bihler vs Platt, 1878, Reports of cases determined in the Supreme Court of the State of California, Volume 52, California Supreme Court, Bancroft-Whitney Company, pp550-552 By 1855, German immigrants William Bihler and Charles Wagner acquired title to the northern 2 square leagues of Rancho German. Bihler bought out Wagner's interest in 1857. William Bihler (1828 -) was born in Eppingen, Baden, Germany, and emigrated, with parents, to America, settling in Baltimore. Bihler arrived in San Francisco in 1849, where he apprenticed as a butcher in for a couple of years before becoming a partner in a cattle ranch operation on Rancho Huichica in western Napa County in 1852. Bihler remained at Rancho Huichica until 1859, when he purchased a ranch Lakeville.J. P. Munro-Fraser, 1880,History of Sonoma County, Alley, Bowen & Co., San Francisco When Bihler acquired his Rancho German property in 1855, he sent back to Baltimore for his two young nephews to join him and manage his two cattle ranches. The younger, Christian Stengel, along with Adam Knipp, would operate the Rancho German property. Beginning in the 1860s, Knipp and Stengel gradually bought from Bihler. Between 1872 and 1882, Robert Rutherford bought from Bihler, but lost it 13 years to foreclosure.Tom Gregory, 1911,History of Sonoma County, California , Historic Record Co., San Los Angeles In 1903, Knipp and Stengel began selling off their land to Bender Brothers Mill and Lumber Co., which also acquired the Rutherford ranch.

Life and career Born to a prominent French noble family, Lascaris d'Urf√© was a brother of Louis Lascaris d'Urf√©, Count of Sommaviva, whose son was Louis Lascaris d'Urf√©, Bishop of Limoges. He held the title of Marquis de Baug√© and was also Abb√© of Ard√®che. In 1660, he was admitted to the seminary of Saint-Sulpice in Paris, and ordained in 1665.

Lascaris d'Urf√© replaced his cousin there in 1674. His support for F√©nelon gave rise to his own problems with Governor Frontenac. He accompanied back to France, where he wrote to Minister of Finance Jean-Baptiste Colbert, whose daughter-in-law was Lascaris d'Urf√©'s first cousin, of his mail being opened and other slights. Lascaris d'Urf√© returned to Quebec in 1686, and soon after re-joined the Sulpicians at Montreal. He then founded the mission of Saint-Louis-du-Haut- de-l'√éle in the west end of Montreal Island at Pointe-Caron (site of the present-day Baie-D'Urf√© Yacht Club).

Fiberglass grating does not corrode like steel grating and is therefore used in corrosive environments to reduce maintenance costs. It is used in a variety of applications including walkways and overhead platforms. FRP grating is a structural product that can be weight-bearing between spans.  Types  Molded FRP grating is composed of alternating directional layers of continuous glass fiber for strength, with resin to consolidate the fibers and provide the shape and corrosion-resistance. Due to its bidirectional strength, molded grating can tolerate cutouts in the panel to allow pipe or equipment penetrations without requiring additional support around the opening. Molded grating has very high impact tolerance, as well as the highest chemical resistance of any fiberglass grating. It can be made slip-resistant by adding grit to the surface. Pultruded FRP grating consists of continuous glass strands encased in resin and wrapped in a surfacing veil which protects the fibers and allows resin to saturate the outermost part of the bar as well as penetrate between the glass fibers. This ensures a smooth and corrosion- resistant surface, with a higher glass/resin ratio than molded products. The individual bars are then assembled using cross bars and epoxy to mechanically join the load bars. Pultruded grating has unidirectional strength, with its much higher glass content resulting in a greater span capability than molded products. This product is usually specified in applications requiring larger spans or heavier loading. FRP/GRP Composite materials are replacing conventional materials and major asset-owners are fostering innovation and steadily increasing the use in so many applications. By combining fibreglass rovings with a thermosetting resin, these are proven to withstand the effects of corrosion and are highly impact resistant, and each day newly found applications are discovered. They meet the same specified load requirements as steel and are more resistant to impact.  Resins  Many resin types may be used in pultrusion including polyester, polyurethane, vinylester epoxy, isophthalic polyester, Orthophthalic and phenolics.  Applications  Fiberglass grating is often used when there are safety concerns due to liquids or oils on the floor and more corrosive environments needing chemical resistance. Many different applications can benefit from Fiberglass Grating, such as: Walkways, Platforms, Protective Shielding, Machinery Housings, Raised Floors and Stairways In addition, Industries that use Molded Fiberglass Grating can include bottling lines, food processing plants, lift stations, commercial aquariums, lube oil facilities, plating shops, beverage canning facilities, chemical plants and pulp and paper plants.  Fiberglass reinforced plastic stair tread panels  Stair tread panels can also be manufactured using FRP technology. Molded stair treads provide corrosion resistance, durability, and ease of fabrication and maintenance.

Chalkboard is the first initiative of Foundations for a Better Oregon, a collaboration of six of Oregon's leading foundations: The Collins Foundation, the Ford Family Foundation, JELD-WEN Foundation, Meyer Memorial Trust, The James F. and Marion L. Miller Foundation and The Oregon Community Foundation.  History  For years, Oregon's most influential foundations had been spending millions on education reform by fighting individual battles with isolated results. Frustrated by the slow pace of change that failed to impact the system statewide, they decided to come together to form an independent, nonpartisan, charitable organization for Oregon schools. The Chalkboard Project was founded in 2004 and with the idea that combining grassroots engagement with Oregonians and best practices research would lead to policy to raise student achievement in grades K‚Äì12. In its first two years, Chalkboard collected data nationally and internationally on best practices to raise student achievement. They had more than 400 conversations with citizens in every one of Oregon's 36 counties to learn what priorities they had for Oregon schools. Their June 2005 action plan emerged from this intersection of public will and best practices. Chalkboard's work continues on three fronts; citizen engagement, independent projects and advocacy.Our Voices, Our Schools: 2008‚Äì2009 Education Report to Oregonians. Chalkboard Project.

He represented the region of Vojvodina at the first season that was played after the end of the Second World War, that was played in a particular way, being the players distributed by the internal republics and autonomous provinces. That was the only season played in that peculiar way, returning the league to its normal clubs format in the next, 1946-47 season. He was playing in his hometown club Spartak Subotica. In 1948, he moved to Partizan where he played until 1952, having won the 1948‚Äì49 championship. Afterwards, he returned to Spartak where he played until 1957, when he ended his playing career. National team After having moved to Partizan, he played for the Yugoslav national team four times. His debut was on 21 August 1949 in Belgrade against Israel (a 6-0 win) and his last match was on 13 November of the same year, also in Belgrade, against Austria (this time a 5-2 defeat). Manager career He was the manager of the club where he started and ended his playing career, Spartak Subotica, having managed to take them to the 1962 Yugoslav Cup final where they lost 4-1 against the much bigger OFK Belgrade.

Motorized wheelchairs are useful for those unable to propel a manual wheelchair or who may need to use a wheelchair for distances or over terrain which would be fatiguing in a manual wheelchair. They may also be used not just by people with 'traditional' mobility impairments, but also by people with cardiovascular and fatigue-based conditions. History Harding electrically propelled invalid chair (1930s) George Klein and others with his Klein Drive Chair 1953 An electrically propelled tricycle was developed by the R.A. Harding company in England in the 1930s. The electric-powered wheelchair was invented by George Klein who worked for the National Research Council of Canada, to assist injured veterans after World War II.Canadian Science and Technology Museum Design Powerchair design may be categorized by drive system/chassis, battery, controller, seat, and use. Because of their use as the primary method of locomotion, they must be of the utmost reliability both electrically and structurally, and are classified as Durable medical equipment by Medicare in the United States. Drive System/Chassis Powerchairs are generally four-wheeled or six-wheeled and non-folding, however some folding designs exist and other designs may have some ability to partially dismantle for transit. Four general styles of powerchair drive systems exist: front, centre or rear wheel drive and all-wheel drive. Powered wheels are typically somewhat larger than the trailing/castoring wheels, while castoring wheels are typically larger than the castors on a manual chair. Centre wheel drive powerchairs have castors at both front and rear for a six-wheel layout. Former US President Bill Clinton, Dean Kamen and the iBot Powerchair chassis may also mount a kerb-climber, a powered device to lift the front wheels over a kerb of 10 cm or less. Some manual wheelchairs may also be fitted with an auxiliary electric power system. This can take one of three forms: integrated with the hub of hand-propelled wheels, so that any force on the pushrims is magnified by the drive system, or mounted under the wheelchair and controlled as for a powerchair, but with the motive force either transmitted to the main wheels via a friction drive system, or delivered directly through an auxiliary drive wheel. Some experimental all-terrain powerchair designs have been produced with tracks rather than wheels, but these are not in common use. Other experimental designs have incorporated stair-climbing abilities and Dean Kamen's iBOT design featured both stair climbing and the ability to 'stand' on its upended chassis via the use of advanced gyroscopic sensors. The iBOT was at one time a production model, but is no longer marketed. Battery The electric motors of powerchairs are usually powered by 12 to 80 ampere hour rechargeable deep-cycle batteries, the smaller batteries are used in pairs to give the chair enough power to last at least one day between charges. These are available in wet or dry options. As wet-cell batteries may not legally be carried on an aircraft without removing them from the wheelchair and securing them in a shipping container, dry-cell batteries are preferred for powerchair use. Many powerchairs carry an on-board charger which can be plugged into a standard wall outlet; older or more portable models may have a separate charger unit. Controller A typical joystick controller Controllers are most commonly an arm-rest mounted joystick which may have additional controls to allow the user to tailor sensitivity or access multiple control modes. The controller may be swing-away to aid in side-transfers. For users who are unable to use a hand controller various alternatives are available such as sip-and-puff controllers, worked by blowing into a sensor. In some cases the controller may be mounted for use by an aide walking behind the chair rather than by the user. Capabilities include turning one drivewheel forward while the other goes backward, thus turning the wheelchair within its own length. 'Thought-control' of powerchairs, actually working by the detection of brainwaves or nerve signals via sensors on the scalp or elsewhere, has been demonstrated in the laboratory environment. Seat The seating on a powerchair can vary in design. Starting with a basic sling seat and backrest made of vinyl or nylon, some chairs have an optional padding, some have more comfortable cushion and backrest options which may include a head rest. There are companies which can fit their own backrests and seat cushions for people with increased need for stability in the trunk, or at increased risk of pressure sores from sitting out. Finally, specialist seating solutions are available for users who need individually tailored support. Leg rests may be integrated into the seating design and may have powered adjustment for those users who need to vary their leg position. Powerchairs may also have a tilt- in-space, or reclining facility for users who are unable to maintain an upright seating position indefinitely. This function can also help with comfort by shifting pressure to different areas for a while, or with positioning in a wheelchair when a user needs to be hoisted in. Certain high- end powerchairs feature a 'standing' capability in which either the entire seat elevates to bring the user to standing height or the seat-base, seat-back and leg rests move in conjunction to bring the user into an upright position. The powerchair may or may not be able to move while in the elevated position. Environment A large ATV-style outdoor chair Powerchairs may be designed for indoor, outdoor or indoor/outdoor use. A typical indoor powerchair will be narrow and short, to enable better manoeuvring around tight environments. Controls are usually simple, and due to the smaller design, the chair would be less stable outdoors. Tyres are often smoother (once called carpet tyres) to look after the flooring in a home. Indoor/outdoor powerchairs again will be as small in design as possible, but with a reasonable range in the batteries, some grippy tyres (but not big knobbly off-road tyres), these often include a kerb-climber to assist with manoeuvres where there are no drop kerbs. Intended for pavement use only. Outdoor powerchairs have a considerable range, a large wheelbase to help with stability, and large tyres which improve the comfort and handling of the chair. These can sometimes be driven indoors in adapted environments, but not around a typical home. Some very large outdoor powerchairs have been designed with cross-country mobility in mind and show design convergence with other types of cross-country vehicle. Transportation Most wheelchairs are crash tested to standards 7176, and ISO 10542. These standards mean that a wheelchair can be used facing forward in a vehicle if the vehicle has been fitted with an approved tiedown or docking system for securing the wheelchair, and a method of securing the occupant of the wheelchair. Use Powerchairs are generally prescribed for use by users who are unable to use a manual wheelchair. However, in both the US (Medicare and some private insurers) and the UK (National Health Service) powerchairs are generally not prescribed to users who have any ability to walk within the home, even if that ability is so functionally constrained as to be practically useless and where the user is unable to use a manual wheelchair independently. Disability rights activists are campaigning for prescription procedures to focus on an individual needs based assessment rather than on inflexible application of prescription rules. The restricted prescribing leads to many users being forced to procure a solution privately, in some cases settling for a powerchair or a mobility scooter that is less than ideal to their needs but which falls within their budget. The use of powerchairs is not restricted solely to users unable to use manual chairs. Any disabled person with a mobility, fatigue or pain-based impairment or cardio-vascular issues may find a powerchair advantageous in some circumstances; however, existing prescription practices generally mean that powerchairs for such use must be privately procured or hired for the occasion. Limitations Access adaptations such as wheelchair spaces on public transport and wheelchair lifts are frequently designed around a typical manual wheelchair (in the UK referred to as a 'reference wheelchair'). Powerchairs, however, frequently exceed the size and weight limits of manual wheelchairs as they are not constrained by the ability of the user to self-propel. Some designs are too large or heavy for certain wheelchair spaces and lifts. However, there are new designs and innovations seeking to overcome these issues.

The grant extended along the Pacific coast from the Russian River on the north to Estero Americano on the south, and included the present-day town of Bodega Bay.Dise√±o del Rancho Bodega Only a small part of Bodega is within the grant (most of Bodega in on Rancho Estero Americano).Mexican Land Grants in Sonoma County History The Mexican government, which had been concerned about the Russian presence at Fort Ross, was happy to see them leave in 1841, but less pleased when the Russian- American Company sold it to John Sutter. The position of the Mexican government had been that neither land nor improvements had ever belonged to the Russians and hence they could not legally be transferred to anyone else. Within two years after the purchase of Fort Ross, everything Sutter considered salvageable had been removed to his Rancho New Helvetia. In 1844 Sutter leased the land to William (Wilhelm) Benitz, from Baden, Germany, manager of Sutter's Fort Ross holdings and a partner, Ernest Rufus, from W√ºrttemberg. That transaction again brought into question the validity of Sutter's title to the property, and Governor Manuel Micheltorena granted Rancho Bodega in part of the southern half of the former Russian claim to Captain Stephen Smith in 1844. Governor P√≠o Pico granted Rancho Muniz in the northern half of the former Russian claim to Manuel Torres in 1845.Ranch Era excerpted from Fort Ross, published by the Fort Ross Interpretive Association, 2001 Captain Stephen Smith (1782-1855), a sea captain from Massachusetts, sailed along the Pacific Coast, north of San Francisco in 1841. Local settlers had been shipping their lumber for houses from Hawaii, and Smith saw the timber growing along the shoreline as a business opportunity - particularly with the Russians leaving Fort Ross. Captain Smith returned to California in 1843, with sawmill machinery from Baltimore and built the first steam-powered saw mill in California in the redwoods north of the town of Bodega, on Salmon Creek. On the voyage to California in 1843, Smith married Manuela Torres (1828-1871), a Peruvian. It was her brother Manuel Torres, who joined them, who was granted Rancho Muniz, directly north of Rancho Bodega in 1845. Bodega Bay was Smith's shipping port, and he helped develop the area into a commercial port. Captain Smith owned a small vessel called the Fayaway, which he sailed between the Port of Bodega and San Francisco.Captain Stephen Smith The Maritime Heritage Project In 1844 Smith successfully petitioned the Mexican Governor of California, Manuel Micheltorena, to grant him 8 square leagues. Smith purchased the buildings on the land from John Sutter, who had claimed them under his purchase of Fort Ross from the Russians.J. P. Munro-Fraser, 1880,History of Sonoma County, Alley, Bowen & Co., San Francisco Stephen Smith bought Rancho Blucher directly to the south from Jean Jacques Vioget in 1847. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican- American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Bodega was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1853 by Victor Prudon (-1868), who claimed that he was granted the property by Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo in 1841. Lieutenant Colonel Victor Prudon, a Frenchman, was secretary to General Vallejo. The claim was rejected by the Land Commission in 1854.United States. District Court (California : Northern District) Land Case 310D When Captain Smith died in San Francisco in 1855, he owned the 8 square league Rancho Bodega with his wife, Manuela Torres and the 6 league Rancho Blucher. Smith left a life interest in one third of Rancho Bodega to his wife and two thirds to his three children - Stephen Manuel Smith (1843‚Äì1924), Manuelita Garcia Smith (1846‚Äì1942) and James B. Smith (1852 - ?) by Manuela Torres. Smith's widow, Manuela Torres, married Tyler Curtis on December 18, 1856 at Old Saint Mary's Cathedral in San Francisco. A claim was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852,United States. District Court (California: Northern District) Land Case 35 ND and the grant was patented to Manuela Torres Curtis in 1859. Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 When Tyler Curtis received the patent for Rancho Bodega in 1859, he tried to oust settlers who were farming parcels of the rancho. Many of these settlers had rented their land from Captain Smith, and had continued to pay rent. Others were squatters who were holding on to their claims until the property would be put upon the market. Failing to get the settlers to leave by peaceful means, Curtis went to San Francisco and hired militia of about forty men. However, in an event known as the \\"Bodega War\\" or the \\"Tyler Curtis War\\", two hundred settlers with farm tools and shotguns, confronted Curtis and the hired militia, and he was defeated in his effort to evict them. Tyler Curtis succeeded in getting the California State Legislature to passed an act in 1861, giving him the right as guardian to sell the three children's interest in the rancho. Curtis sold the grant in parcels of mostly 150 to each on through the early 1860s. Curtis did not manage to keep his fortune and the rancho passed into other hands. In 1877 James B. Smith, the youngest son, sued to recover the rancho, but the California Supreme Court ruled the sales by Curtis to be legal.Reports of cases determined in the Supreme Court of the State of California, 1877, James V.

Turbo-Boost-enabled processors are the Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, Core i9 and Xeon series manufactured since 2008, more particularly, those based on the Nehalem, and later microarchitectures. The frequency is accelerated when the operating system requests the highest performance state of the processor. Processor performance states are defined by the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specification, an open standard supported by all major operating systems; no additional software or drivers are required to support the technology. The design concept behind Turbo Boost is commonly referred to as \\"dynamic overclocking\\". When the workload on the processor calls for faster performance, the processor's clock will try to increase the operating frequency in regular increments as required to meet demand. The increased clock rate is limited by the processor's power, current, and thermal limits, the number of cores currently in use, and the maximum frequency of the active cores. Frequency increases occur in increments of 133 MHz for Nehalem processors and 100 MHz for Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell and Skylake processors. When any electrical or thermal limits are exceeded, the operating frequency automatically decreases in decrements of 133 or 100 MHz until the processor is again operating within its design limits. Turbo Boost 2.0 was introduced in 2011 with the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture, while Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 was introduced in 2016 with the Broadwell-E microarchitecture. A feature of Turbo Boost 2.0 is that it introduced time windows with different levels of power limits, so that a processor can boost to a higher frequency for a few seconds. These limits are configurable in software for unlocked processors. Some motherboard vendors intentionally use values higher than Intel's default for performance, causing the processor to exceed its thermal design power (TDP). Some Intel Core X Series (HEDT) Processor and some 10th Gen Intel Core Processor (10th Gen Desktop Core i7 and Core i9) support Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 Technology. Newer version Windows 10 and Linux kernel support Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 Technology.  History  An Intel November 2008 white paper discusses \\"Turbo Boost\\" technology as a new feature incorporated into Nehalem-based processors released in the same month. A similar feature called Intel Dynamic Acceleration (IDA) was available on many Core 2 based Centrino platforms. This feature did not receive the marketing treatment given to Turbo Boost. Intel Dynamic Acceleration dynamically changed the core frequency as a function of the number of active cores. When the operating system instructed one of the active cores to enter C3 sleep state using the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI), the other active core(s) dynamically accelerated to a higher frequency. Intel Turbo Boost Technology Monitor, as a GUI utility, could be used to monitor Turbo Boost; this utility has reached the end-of-life state by no longer supporting Intel processors released after Q2 2013, and is no longer available.

It is the fifth episode of the show's sixth season and aired on October 25, 2009. Plot While on a play date Juanita and Rachel slide down the stairs in a suitcase, Laura arrives to pick up Rachel and Gaby tells her they were just playing and that she cannot watch them every second so she accuses Gaby of almost killing her daughter and being a lousy mother. Gaby is offended by the accusation and tells her Rachel was only invited because Juanita felt sorry for her. Laura tells Gaby she will not be bringing Rachel over anymore and will not be attending Juanita's birthday party because she feels her daughter is not safe in Gaby's care. Shortly after, Gaby starts getting calls from parents saying they have to back out of the party and she knows Laura is telling everyone their children are not safe in Gaby's care. Later, she goes to the park and tells the kids who are not going to Juanita's party that she is having a clown, a monkey, and a bouncy house so they all start begging to go. During the birthday party, the trainer tells Gaby the monkey needs to take a nap but Gaby refuses so while she and Susan are drinking margarita's all the kids run screaming and M.J. tells them the monkey is attacking the clown. That night, Carlos tells Gaby she is a great mother. Two weeks after being attacked, Julie returns home from the hospital and is greeted with a \\"Welcome Home\\" party by all the residents of Wisteria Lane. Nick tries to talk to Julie, but she tells him they are not doing that anymore and it's over. Danny saw Nick and Julie talking so when he tries to talk to Danny about it, he threatens to tell Angie if he ever saw the two of them together. Nick refuses to let him hold that over his head and tells Danny that the only thing that will hurt Angie is him knowing about the affair. While Julie is looking at the spot where she got attacked, Danny catches her by surprise and Julie tells him she knows he is not the one who attacked her. He asks her if the person she was seeing is the one who did it, but she thought about it and is sure he did not do it because he is not that kind of person. When Julie tells Danny she has not been able to sleep and is constantly worried the attacker will show up, he gives her their gun. That night, Susan is awakened by Julie claiming someone is outside and she is shocked that Julie has a gun. When the person walks past the window, Susan gets startled and the gun goes off. Susan looks out the window to see Katherine lying on the ground with a bullet wound on her shoulder. Hearing the gunshot, everyone runs over to Susan's and Katherine tells them Susan tried to kill her. When Nick tells Angie and Danny that Susan just shot Katherine, Danny tells them it was their gun. Since it is registered in their real name they cannot have the police investigating so Nick retrieves the gun and Angie convinces Katherine to not call the cops by telling her she believes Mike is in love with her also. At the party, Bree tells the other housewives that she fired Katherine and they all agree she needs help. Thinking Mike told Susan, Bree asks if she told them about Katherie hitting on Mike so Susan goes to ask Mike. Mike tells her it was nothing and he kept it from her because he knew it would upset her and Katherine means nothing to him. Later, at the Neighborhood Watch meeting Susan sees Katherine staring at Mike so she goes over to him and kisses him in front of her and everyone else. While asking for volunteers for one of the night shifts, Susan blatantly ignores Katherine. When Katherine confronts her, Susan tells her she is a liar and insane. Susan tells Katherine the only problem they have is her and if she doesn't stay away she'll be sorry. Karen tells Lynette that Roy is living on a fixed income and wants her and Tom to hire Roy as a handyman so he can have some extra money. Lynette wants Roy to build some flower boxes for the bedroom windows, Tom does not want them in their children's rooms as they will never water them, but Lynette doesn't care. Lynette is surprised when Roy goes over her head and asks Tom for his opinion. Later, Lynette asks him to hang a birdhouse but he tells her that Tom wanted it on the other side of the yard. Lynette comes back to see Roy talking to Tom on his cell phone and he tells her he wants to treat Tom with some respect since he is the man of the house. Lynette is offended that Roy think she emasculates Tom so she fires him. Tom goes over to talk with Roy and explains to him that Lynette's need of controlling everything is a result of her childhood. He tells Roy that he lets Lynette control him because it makes her feel safe and it's his job to make her feel safe as her husband. While Bree and Karl are kissing, the motel maid walks in to clean the room. Bree goes back because she lost an ear ring and when the maid overhears Bree lying to Orson on the phone about where she is, the maid gives her a disapproving look. While having dinner with Orson, Bree tells him she encountered a waitress who was rude and superior at a cafe so Orson tells her to go back and demand some courtesy. The next day, Bree goes back to the motel to talk with the maid. Bree tells her she should not be making judgements about people and that if she knew about her marriage she would see her differently. While waiting for Karl to arrive, Bree has the maid change a light bulb and she tells Bree she also had an affair and when it was over she had no husband or boyfriend and is now cleaning motel rooms. When the maid asks if Bree feels guilty she confesses that she feels guilty all the time and wishes Orson would stop loving her because she is not worth it anymore. Despite her constant guilt, Bree continues her affair with Karl.
