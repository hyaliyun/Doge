It has smooth bark, narrow lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds that are square in cross-section arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils, creamy white, sometimes pink flowers, and fruit that are square in cross-section.flowers and budsfruit Description Eucalyptus calycogona is mallee that typically grows to a height of , or rarely a small tree, and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth cream-coloured grey, pinkish, sometimes powdery bark and sometimes has rough bark near the base. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull greyish green leaves arranged in opposite pairs, lance-shaped to oblong, long and wide. The adult leaves are arranged alternately, narrow lance-shaped, the same glossy green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oblong, square in cross-section, long and wide with four ribs along their sides. Flowering occurs between May and November and the flowers are creamy white or sometimes pink. There are two rows of stamens, the outer ring of stamens not producing pollen. The fruit is a woody capsule long and wide, barrel-shaped or urn-shaped in side view and more or less square in cross section with four ribs along the sides. Taxonomy Eucalyptus calycogona was first formally described by Nikolai Turczaninow in 1852 and the description was published in the Bulletin de la Classe Physico-Math√©matique de l'Acad√©mie Imp√©riale des Sciences de Saint- P√©tersbourg. Four subspecies have been formally described and accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus calycogona Turcz. subsp. calycogona has smooth bark throughout, small buds and fruit with moderate ribbing and sometimes dark pink flowers; * Eucalyptus calycogona subsp. miraculum Nicolle & M.E.French has a waxy covering on the branches, buds and fruit; * Eucalyptus calycogona subsp. spaffordi Nicolle has broad, thick leaves and prominently ribbed buds and fruit; * Eucalyptus calycogona subsp. trachybasis Nicolle usually has rough bark on the base of the main stems, and larger buds and fruit. Distribution and habitat Gooseberry mallee grows in mallee woodlands and shrublands in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. Subspecies calycogona is the most widespread of the subspecies and occurs in all these states, especially in Western Australia where it grows in the southern and central wheatbelt, Great Southern and southern Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia extending eastwards almost to Balladonia. It is found on the Eyre Peninsula and south-eastern Mount Lofty Ranges of South Australia, the Big Desert area of Victoria and the Koraleigh area in the far south-west of New South Wales. Subspecies trachybasis is found from the eastern side of Spencer Gulf in South Australia, westwards to Boort and Kerang and north from Edenhope in Victoria. Subspecies spaffordii is restricted to southern parts of the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia and subspecies miracula in an area to the south of Southern Cross in Western Australia. This species is associated with the chenopod mallee subgroup. The chenopod mallee subgroup has E. calycogona along with other trees including Eucalyptus gracilis, Eucalyptus dumosa and Eucalyptus oleosa the understorey includes species of Maireana, Sclerolaena, Enchylaena, Chenopodium and Zygophyllum. Use in horticulture E. calycogona is cultivated as an ornamental or shade tree that is suitable for coastal or inland areas. The tree is tolerant of drought, lime and moderate frost and is bird and insect attracting.

It has rough, fibrous bark on the lower part of the trunk, smooth bark above, elliptic to lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy-yellow flowers and conical to bell-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus calyerup is a tree that typically grows to a height of and rarely forms a lignotuber. It has smooth pale cream to pale pink bark above a dark grey stocking of rough bark on the lowest of the trunk. Young plants have leaves that are bluish green, egg-shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves are egg-shaped to elliptic, sometimes lance-shaped, the same glossy green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a flattened peduncle long, the individual flowers on a pedicel long. Mature buds are long, wide with a horn- shaped operculum that is narrower than, but about twice as long as the floral cup. Flowering occurs between October and December and the flowers are creamy yellow. The fruit is a woody, conical to bell-shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel long. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus calyerup was first formally described in 2002 by Nathan K. McQuoid and Stephen Hopper from a specimen collected from near Calyerup Rocks, east of Jerramungup. The description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (calyerup) refers to the type location. The ending -ensis is a Latin suffix \\"denoting place, locality [or] country\\". This species is possibly a stabilised hybrid between E. occidentalis and E. platypus, although the latter species does not occur in the same location. Distribution and habitat This eucalypt is found around rocky outcrops in the Great Southern region of Western Australia between Katanning and Jerramungup where it grows in sandy-loam soils over granite. Conservation This species is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk. Use in horticulture Eucalyptus calyerup has been used extensively by the local Landcare group and has been shown to be resistant to lerp attack.

F. Watts Emelia Russell Gurney (1823‚Äì1896) was an English activist, patron and benefactor. After her marriage she was generally known as Mrs. Russell Gurney.  Life  She was born Emelia Batten, daughter of the Rev. Samuel Ellis Batten (1792‚Äì1830), master at Harrow School, and Caroline Venn, daughter of John Venn. A friend of the children of John William Cunningham, and close to James Fitzjames Stephen, she was present in March 1851 when Stephen met Mary Richenda Cunningham, his future wife, for the second time, and fell in love. She herself married Russell Gurney in 1852. He was from the London Baptist family of parliamentary shorthand writers, rather than the Norwich Quaker banking Gurney family of Earlham Hall. The Gurneys lived in London at 8 Kensington Park Gardens, from around 1854. She was a founder of the Kensington Society of 1865‚Äì8, a group of feminists, reformers and suffragists. A committee was set up after Elizabeth Blackwell lectured on medical training for women, in 1859, and Gurney belonged to it. She helped Elizabeth Garrett, the medical pioneer, with an introduction to William Hawes (1805‚Äì1885) (as a grandson of William Hawes (1736‚Äì1808) he was related to Russell Gurney); and the Gurneys supported the dispensary Garrett set up in 1866. Emelia confided to Elizabeth Garrett her ambivalence about the use of \\"feminine arts\\" to get ahead. In 1865 she travelled with her husband to Jamaica, a commissioner investigating the handling of the Morant Bay rebellion; and wrote of conditions there, in the form of a journal addressed to her mother. In December 1867 Gurney was one of the initial members of Emily Davies's executive committee, that raised funds for Girton College. With Maria Georgina Grey and Emily Shirreff she founded The Girls' Public Day School Company. Before her husband died, in 1878, she was reticent about her activist views.  Legacy  Gurney commissioned murals for the Chapel of the Ascension, Hyde Park Place, Bayswater, London. They were designed by Herbert Percy Horne, and executed by Frederic Shields. She funded the building of the red brick chapel, which replaced the chapel of St George's Fields, Westminster, a burial ground. It was damaged in World War II and demolished in 1952. Man Repels the Appeal of Conscience, Ascension Chapel mural Octavia Hill had been a friend in early life: but the two women then lost touch. Gurney left Hill a block of buildings in Westbourne. These Hill combined with properties in Horace Street, to form a housing trust that has endured. When Hill in 1898 was formally presented with a portrait, she made a speech of thanks in which she mentioned particular supporters who were dead: Emelia Gurney with Sydney John Cockerell, F. D. Maurice, Jane Senior and William Shaen.  Associations  The Gurneys knew Francis Galton, through his wife Louisa Jane (n√©e Butler). It was at their house that Gerard Manley Hopkins met Christina Rossetti and William Holman Hunt. The Gurneys bought works by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Emelia was a supporter of Emily Ford. She had been taken to Rossetti's studio in 1862 by Ellen Heaton, a friend. While on good terms with her mother, who had brought her up, Gurney considered that her evangelical background had been strict. A prominent member of the \\"Cowper-Temple\\" or Mount Temple religious circle, a loose evangelical and ecumenical Christian group around William Cowper-Temple, 1st Baron Mount Temple and his wife Georgina, she attended their \\"Broadlands conferences\\" from 1874 to 1888. Georgina was a particular friend. Emelia visited the lay theologian Thomas Erskine of Linlathen many times, both before and after her marriage. She corresponded with Andrew Jukes, Hannah Whitall Smith and Victoria, Lady Welby. Staying with Lady Welby in 1883, she met Joseph Henry Shorthouse and his wife Sarah, who became lifelong friends. Julia Wedgwood was a close friend. The Gurneys hosted at their house meetings of the Ladies' Sanitary Association, a health organisation founded in 1857 by Mathias Roth. Its supporters were an eclectic mixture: feminists, politicians' wives, wives of medical men. Emelia organised a series of lectures given by the writer and theologian George MacDonald, in 1858, and the first of these was in the Gurneys' home. Raeper calls Emelia \\"Ellen\\".  Works  * Dante's Pilgrim's Progress (1897), dedicated to Robert Bickersteth, a lecturer on Dante. * The Chapel of the Ascension: a descriptive handbook (1897), published under the name of Frederic Shields, is attributed to Gurney.  Family  The Gurneys had no children of their own; they fostered the five children of John Hampden Gurney, Russell's brother, from 1862 to 1865. They included the brothers Frederick, Alfred and Edmund.  Notes   External links  * Margaretta S.

She was credited by Shinz≈ç Abe, prime minister of Japan, with having coined the term \\"womenomics\\".Goldman Sachs‚Äô Matsui Challenges ‚ÄòMyths‚Äô of Womenomics. Yoko Sudo, Wall Street Journal, 10 July 2014. Retrieved 12 June 2016. She is a graduate of Harvard University and survived breast cancer in 2001. She is a TEDx speaker. Life and career Matsui's parents were Japanese Christians who immigrated from Nara Prefecture in Japan to the United States in the early 1960s. She was born in California in 1965, where her parents ran a commercial flower nursery in Salinas Valley. She has three siblings, Teresa, William, and Paul. Growing up, she worked in the family business while attending school and taking Japanese classes on Saturdays. Matsui is a 1982 graduate of Gonzales High School. A small rural school district at the time served Gonzales, CA; Soledad, CA; Chualar, CA and the surrounding ranches and farm in central Salinas Valley. Matsui earned degrees in social studies from Harvard University and international affairs from Johns Hopkins University. In 1986 she visited Japan for the first time‚Äîtwo years on a Rotary scholarship at the International Christian University in Tokyo. Before this, she had only a weak command of the Japanese language. Matsui joined the Japan Strategy team of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities in spring 1990, just after the Japanese bubble economy peaked. She joined Goldman Sachs Japan in 1994, where she became managing director in 1998 and the first female partner there in 2000. In August 1999 Matsui published a report in which she coined the term \\"womenomics\\", in which she argues increasing the participation of women in the workforce as a better solution to Japan's economic stagnation than increasing immigration or the birthrate. At the time, 56.7% of working-age women participated in the workforce in Japan, where women's status and opportunities have ranked low compared to most other nations. She likened such low participation to \\"running a marathon with one leg\\". In 2001, Matsui was diagnosed with breast cancer. She returned to California for chemotherapy and recuperation. She wore a wig when she returned to Goldman Sachs eight months later. In 2006, the Bangladeshi-American lawyer Muktadir Kamal Ahmad convinced Matsui to become involved with Asian University for Women, a liberal arts college opened in 2008 in Bangladesh to increase women's education in Asia, where education rates for women remain low. Matsui has promoted investment in the university from Japanese companies, arguing, \\"Educating women in developing countries is probably the highest return on one‚Äôs investment yen or dollar.\\" Japanese Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe incorporated Matsui's womenomics research into his Abenomics economic reforms announced in 2012. On 1 January 2015 she was appointed a vice chair of Goldman Sachs Japan.

It has smooth, shiny bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and cup-shaped or conical fruit. Description Eucalyptus campaspe is a tree or mallet that typically grows to a height of and has smooth, shiny, silver to coppery bark. The stems are twisted and a lignotuber is not formed. The leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long, wide and covered with a powdery white bloom. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. They are also dull, glaucous to grey-green and weather to glossy with age. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a flattened peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature flower buds are oval, long, wide and glaucous with a conical operculum. Flowering occurs between January and March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a glaucous, woody, cup-shaped to hemispherical or conical capsule long and wide with a broad disc and the valves protruding. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus campaspe was first formally described by the botanist Spencer Le Marchant Moore in 1899 in a paper entitled The Botanical Results of a Journey into the Interior of Western Australia, published in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society. The type specimen had been collected by Moore in 1895 from near Gibraltar in the Goldfields area of Western Australia. The specific epithet (campaspe) refers to Campaspe, the mistress of Alexander the Great, but the allusion is not known. Eucalyptus campaspe is one of the six true gimlet species that have buds in groups of seven. The other true gimlets are E. ravida , E. effusa , E. salubris, E. terebra and E. tortilis. The non-glaucous E. salubris is easily distinguished from E. ravida and E. campaspe both of which have conspicuously glaucous branchlets. Distribution Silver gimlet is found on stony hillsides and flats in the Goldfields-Esperance region between Kalgoorlie and Norseman where it grows in sandy-loam-clay soils. It is often part of low woodland communities on calcareous plains or alluvial flats. Associated species in this environment include trees such as: E. salubris, E. gracilis often with E. salmonophloia and Casuarina cristata. Also included in these woodlands are shrubs like Santalum acuminatum, Atriplex vesicaria, Atriplex nummularia and species of Eremophila and Dodonaea. Ground species in these communities include Plantago debilis, Helipterum strictum, Gnephosis brevifolia, Ptilotus exaltatus and Senecio glossanthus.

Giuseppe Mangiarotti passed on his fencing knowledgeSource: TRECCANI BIOGRAPHY - MANGIAROTTI, Dario e Edoardo Capitolo Carriera magistrale di Dario e ultime olimpiadi di Edoardo Giuseppe Mangiarotti passed on his fencing knowledge[1] ,enabling Marcello Lodetti to graduate on 31 May 1959, when his official career as a fencing master started. The young Marcello became an expert in two weapons (foil and √©p√©e) and was selected several times for the most important post-war competitions, where he was also part of the Italian national youth team. But his true vocation was teaching.Sport ed educazione giovanile - published by Ghedini, Milan 1994, pages 54-55 He was involved in training for the World Championships in 1959. On that occasion he wrote the notes that became the basis for the official teaching manual published in 1970 of the Italian Fencing Federation's school (Scuola dello Sport-Fis). The manual was also used to establish the National Qualification Standards (Snaq) for √©p√©e teaching. Marcello Lodetti was an energetic coach during the Rome Olympics in 1960. With the fencing master Vincenzo Canizzo, who had taught Saccaro, Beonio Brocchieri and Pellegatta and had trained people like Pellegrino, Breda, Carpaneda and Delfino during joint training sessions of the Italian national team, Lodetti worked in Novara (1960‚Äì61). Also for the first time (the second time was from 1973 to 1975‚Äì76) he worked at Busto Arsizio, where he taught the Pellegatta brothers (Bruno Achille and Massimo), Sergio Fabrizi, Carlo Dell'Acqua for the fencing association Pro Patria Scherma. His relationship with Canizzo that was based on mutual admiration was further strengthened when they both found themselves working at the Mangiarotti school in Via Solferino where they formed a teaching team with the fencing masters Dario Mangiarotti and Ponzi. Together with Elio Cucchiara and Lancia, he was the promoter and co-founder of the international summer centres for young people at Pievepelago and Zocca (1961 and 1963), . Here, he met the Hungarian head instructors Balogh and Kevey who introduced him to the study of the sabre and also trained him in the use of this double-edged weapon. The first Italian fencing masters teaching in the centres included Bassetti, Dante Galante, Lomele, Turrio, Livio Di Rosa, Augugliaro, Sommacal, Roberto, La Feltra, Bonato, his cousin Gianluigi Lodetti, La Mastra and Dario Mangiarotti. From 1961 to 1967, Marcello Lodetti was the coach at the introductory fencing courses run by the Italian National Olympic Committee (Coni) in Milan together with the coach Bruna Colombetti. In Pavia, from 1963 to 1965 he taught at Cus Pavia, where he trained Canevari, Ottini, Fantoni, and Francavilla (who was invited in 1964 to the world youth championships). In Bologna from 1967 he was at Virtus Bologna with Lancia, where he was entrusted with the group of young √©p√©e specialists who included Taviani. He was then with Felsinea until 1969. In 1965, together with Giuseppe Mangiarotti he founded the first association of Italian fencing masters, which was the forerunner of today's AIMS. In 1968 he started working at Mangiarotti Milano (1968‚Äì78), where he honed his craft to create champions like Gianfranco Mochi, Stefano Bellone, Ettore Bianchi and Sandro Resegotti. From 1970 to 1980 he was called upon continuously by the Italian National Team for joint coaching of both adult and youth teams for the Universiadi (World University Games ), both adult and youth teams for the Universiadi (World University Games ), Olympics and World Championships.

In 1973 and 1977, at the Moscow and Sofia Universiadi (World University Games ) he was the only master fencer for all three disciplines.

Her role in the creation (in the 1950s) of the paper diaper was noteworthy, as was her appointment as the first female board member in a Swedish public limited company, Husqvarna AB, 1n 1970.  Biography  Dagmar Drangel was born on 20 May 1924 as third child (all daughters) of Hugo Drangel and May Gustafson. She died on 21 November 2008 in Stockholm. In 1946 she married her co-student and lawyer Ola Wettergren (died in 1981), with whom she had four children. From 1981, she was married to Arvo Karhola, the vice president of the Finnish heavy manufacturer Tampella. The couple then settled in Helsinki . After her husband's death in 2003, she moved back to Sweden and Stockholm. Lil Karhola Wettergren died at the age of 84 years on May 21, 2008.  Career  After studying law and clerkship (1946, University of Uppsala),and work in the provincial government of √Ñlvsborg Countyin V√§nersborg, she moved with her husband to Stockholm in 1949 to work at Pauli's tissue mill. Her father had worked in the paper mill since 1927 and subsequently transformed the old mechanical pulp mill to a paper tissue mill. The initiative came at the right time because of World War II shortage of cotton and bandages in Europe. This combined with the shortage of both textiles and detergents, gave birth to the idea of the paper diaper. In 1956, Lil bought out Paulistr√∂m from the family and began producing paper diapers in Sweden's first diaper machine, which is constructed on the mill. Her own children served as test panel for the new product. During the period 1959 - 1965 she was president of the company, a pioneer in the male-dominated process industry. Then she sold the company to Mo and Domsj√∂ AB, which she continued to serve as head of Modo's tissue division. The overall male-dominated corporate culture made it difficult to accept her as a leader, and after a few years she resigned from the company to start her own company, Paper Lil AB. In 1969 Lil Wettergren (the name of her husband) became the first female (not belonging to the founding family) member of the Board of Directors of a Swedish listed company, namely Husqvarna AB. At that time, the company was shifting away from the production of weapons at Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag to more \\"soft\\" products like sewing machines and white goods, with which the men on the Board thought a woman as CEO would do well. Following this job, she became a Board member of the companies Abbas AB (1975‚Äì86), MoDo (1976), Mo & Domsj√∂ AB (1982-1991), Gota Bank (1980-1991; first woman in a bank board). In 1987 she wrote her memoirs in \\"Raised to the world of men\\" (Fountain , ), about a woman's experiences in a male business world. Between 1983-2003 she managed the family estate Horns V√§sby.

History Scott Picken and Hennie Bezuidenhoudt founded Wealth Migrate in 2009. The company is an online real estate marketplace that allows individuals to invest in property around the world. The company allows for investors to make both residential and commercial investments, dependent on the country where the investment is taking place. The concept was a spin-off idea from Picken's university thesis, which discussed the use of technology in financial markets during the late 1990s. The company initially assisted South African's with their overseas investments, before expanding to other markets. The CEOs of Wealth Migrate and its competitors predict that the real estate crowdfunding market will grow over the next decade. In 2014, The Huffington Post listed Wealth Migrate as one of the top United States Real Estate Crowdfunding Platforms. Later that year, it was stated that the crowdfunding market had made over $2.5 billion in a single year, with predictions that crowdfunding would continue to grow as a way of investing in real estate. In 2015, the company announced investment of over $4 million, as funding for further expansion. During an interview with CNBC, Picken stated that Wealth Migrate was looking at purchasing pubs in the London-area and then converting them into convenience stores. Such moves by investment companies and large British-based supermarkets, has frequently received coverage in the United Kingdom. Later that year, CrowdfundingInsider announced that the company was expanding its offices in Asia. With offices already located in Singapore and Hong Kong, they announced they were expanding their operations to Shanghai.. In 2016, Wealth Migrate was selected as the only South African company to be featured in the Top 50 of KPMG‚Äôs 2016 Fintech 100 List.KPMG 2016 Fintech 100 Investments Wealth Migrate investments are suggested to be 70% commercial and 30% residential. The platform was developed to give investors the opportunity to make alternative investments in a property when compared to more traditional routes. The concept was developed when statistics suggested that large equity companies would often invest a small percentage of their funds into real estate. Wealth Migrate summarized that by using technology and crowdfunding, investments in large developments could be made by individuals acting in groups, allowing them to receive a much higher return on investment, compared to the individual acting alone. One of the major examples that were quoted on CNBC Africa, was the investment made in the medical market. The company CEO stated that they invested close to hospitals geographically, which allowed a steady return on the investment. Another example given was the investment and purchasing of commercial property around London, where they would then rent the property to a convenience store company once it had been purchased.

They were later renumbered in the 94.2‚Äì4 by Deutsche Reichsbahn History The development of the T16 locomotives was influenced by the ideas of Karl G√∂lsdorf. The design included three G√∂lsdorf axles ‚Äì the first, third, and fifth ‚Äì and enabled elimination of the articulated frame that had been used on the Prussian T 15. While mainly bought for banking trains up steep gradients, they were also used for freight trains and shunting. They proved to be more powerful and economical than the T 15 class. Between 1905 and 1913, 343 T 16 locomotives were built by Berliner Maschinenbau for the Prussian State Railways, and 12 by Els√§ssische Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Grafenstaden for the Imperial Railways in Alsace- Lorraine. During construction, some design changes were made; for example the drive was moved from the fourth axle to the third in order to reduce the length and weight of the connecting rod and therefore to reduce hammer blow. These early locomotives were sometimes referred to as \\"T 16.0\\". After the World War I, 65 locomotives were surrendered, including 57 to Poland, and three to the Free City of Danzig. The PKP classified its T 16 and T 16.1 as TKw1 (the T 16.1s were not split out into TKw2 until 1949). Belgium received 17 T16.0 as war reparations (17/53 of the SNCB Type 98). The Deutsche Reichsbahn renumbered the T 16s 94 201‚Äì467, although the last three were actually T 16.1s ‚Äì this error was corrected in 1934. In addition one T 16 locomotive had been renumbered as a T 16.1 in error, but 94 501 was withdrawn in 1931 before the error was corrected. Locomotives 94 462‚Äì464 came from Alsace-Lorraine. Eight T 16s remained in Alsace-Lorraine and eventually became SNCF 1-050.TA.101 to 112. In addition the SNCF inherited five T 16s from the Chemins de fer du Nord (2-050.TB.1 to 5) and twelve from the Chemins de fer de Paris √† Lyon et √† la M√©diterran√©e (5-050.TA.1 to 12) that the two railway companies had received as war reparations. Many of the DR locomotives were retired in the 1930s. During World War II, a number of Polish locomotives, and one Belgium locomotive were taken into stock, as 94 468‚Äì490. One Belgian locomotive was in the Soviet zone at the end of the war and became 94 1811 in the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn fleet. In Poland, there were 39 TKw1 class locomotive in the PKP fleet; the last TKw1 locomotive was retired in 1970. Preservation Most T 16s stayed in the west; the last Deutsche Bundesbahn 94.2 was retired in 1955. The few locomotives that stayed in the east had been retired by 1968. The last locomotive, 94 249 was transferred to the Dresden Transport Museum. In 1983, it was de-accessioned and traded to Heiligenst√§dter Eisenbahnverein (Heiligenstadt Railway Club) for 60 tonnes of scrap. On 26 May 1994, the State of Thuringia declared it a listed monument.

Most of his fame came in the later years of his life, as he developed his career as a writer when he was almost 80. Life =Theater Director= Orsenigo started working in the Italian artistic panorama after the Second World War. Following the invitation of Elio Vittorini, he presented a selection of theatrical works by Christopher Isherwood, Bertold Brecht and Wystan Hugh Auden, whose works were not yet popular in Italy in that period. In 1950 Orsenigo started working at Piccolo Teatro di Milano thanks to its director Paolo Grassi. He directed Alfred Jarry's piece Ubu Roy and Guillaume Apollinaire. In that occasion, Orsenigo met Pierluigi Pizzi, who was a beginner at that time. The two started working together and Pizzi drew scenography and costumes for Orsenigo's works. Later in the Eighties, Salvatore Quasimodo stated he was interested in Orsenigo's theatrical works.Salvatore Quasimodo, Il poeta a teatro in Spirali, 1984: \\"La compagnia del 'TB 49' ha presentato la sera del 27 giugno sul palcoscenico del Piccolo Teatro di Milano \\"Ubu Roi\\" di Alfred Jarry. La sala non aveva tutti i posti occupati, √® vero; forse l'inizio dell'estate allontana il pubblico dagli spettacoli di teatro puro o la diffidenza verso quel 'TB 49' ermetico ha reso pi√π intima e polemica la rappresentazione di Ubu-Roi. C'erano giovani, per√≤: il gruppo pi√π pericoloso della cultura in movimento: i pittori astrattisti e neorealisti, poeti e scrittori accesi da fuochi sinuosi e ironici, esistenzialisti votati alla chitarra degli chansonniers e ragazze vibranti, senza noia e nausea.\\" In the Fifties, Orsenigo also met the writer and critic Raffaele Carrieri. Orsenigo was also a good painter and Carrieri loved his works. Because of this, in 1981 Orsenigo had his first exhibition in Milan for which Achille Bonito Oliva wrote the catalogue.Achille Bonito Oliva, Vittorio Orsenigo, Studio Ennesse, Milano, 1982 Orsenigo exhibited again in 1984 in MilanVittorio Orsenigo, Catalogo della mostra, 16 aprile 1984.

Testo di G√®rard-George Leimaire. Stralci critici di Raffaele Carrieri, Franco russoli, Achille Bonito Oliva, Italo Mussa. Con 5 ill. a colori, Comune di Ferrara, 1985 =Writer= In the Fifties, Orsenigo had already developed some interest in writing. His first book was a collection of poems named Come gli occhi di sabbia; later in 1954 he published the tale La demenza di giacomo. But only in the Nineties he restarted his activity with La linea gotica and published some works on the Italian magazines Resine Letterarie and La nuova prosa. In the same years Orsenigo also performed translations for the Sellerio and Archinto. In 2001 his friend Giuseppe Pontiggia wrote the preface of Settore editoriale; Orsenigo exchanged the courtesy five years later for Pontiggia's Lettere. The Italian critic Massimo Onofri started looking at Orsenigo's work in 2004. One year after, when Commedianti a Milano was published, he stated that \\"more than a memorial, it is a milanese meditation. [...] if Visite Referring to the novel Visite guidate concerns the irremediabile loss of the only loved son, Commedianti would look as a book of euphoric and utopica youthness, filled with uncompleted novels and never published books, uncompleted as it is life itself. But remain the fact that writing for true writers always turns around few obsessions: Quasimodo got a Nobel Prize and disappeared. Vittorini, Banfi, Carrieri ‚Äì a part from the Nobel ‚Äì made the same joke. It is not their fault, but the raging of deaths makes the search for the detail more difficult\\".\\"pi√π che una memoria, √® una meditazione milanese. [...] se le Visite hanno a che fare con la perdita irrimediabile dell'unico e amatissimo figlio, i Commedianti parrebbe il libro di un euforica e utopica giovinezza, folta di romanzi incompiuti e di volumi mai pubblicati, incompiuta essa stessa come la vita. Ma rimane il fatto che la scrittura dei veri scrittori ruota sempre attorno a poche ossessioni: Quasimodo si √® preso il Nobel ed √® sparito di scena. Vittorini, Banfi, Carrieri ‚Äì Nobel a parte ‚Äì stesso scherzo. Non sar√† colpa loro ma l'imperversare delle morti rende la ricerca del dettaglio pi√π difficile\\". Massimo Onofri, Il Diario della settimana, n¬∞ 36, anno X, 23 settembre 2005 In 2008, Orsenigo was already 83 years old and succeeded to extend his fame with two best-sellers: L'uccellino della radio and La camera d'ambra, the latest published with a preface by Sergio Romano. His novels were published for the publishers Archinto and Rizzoli Imprimatur; in 2015 was the time for A Enea Finzi non sparano in fronte, set during the war period. =Style= Orsenigo has a direct realistic style, but filled with imaginations and frequent digressions. He wrote about places where he used to live: Milan during the Second World War (Commedianti a Milano, L'uccellino della radio), mountains and woods (Il pizzini di amblar) and exotic lands (Una camera tutta d'ambra, Tanti viaggi). Daniela Marcheschi noted that Orsenigo is \\"Bizzar and digressive following a humoristic tradition that, through Porta and Rajberti, had prosperous developments in Milan's cultur and in the Italian literature of the XIX century afterwords\\".Afterword for Cosa trovi nell'acqua, 2014, Archinto Works =Poetry= * Come gli occhi di sabbia, anni '50 =Narrative= * La demenza di Giacomo, 1954 * La linea gotica, Marietti, 1990 * I libri di Sfax, Greco&Greco;, 1991 (con lo pseudonimo di Claude Solenzara) * Fotografie, rivista Nuova Prosa (romanzo a puntate) * E... venti racconti appena incominciati, Greco&Greco;, 1995 * Mulino da preghiera, Greco&Greco;, 1996 * Il verme solitario e altri animali quasi domestici, Greco&Greco;, 1997, with Guido Almansi, Roberto Barbolini, Lucio Klobas, Roberto Pazzi, Giovanni Pederiali * Centotre storie di seduzione (e una postilla), Mobydick, 1998 * In Africa con Alain, Greco&Greco; * Dreyfus, Collana Cristallo di Rocca n. 10, Greco&Greco;, 1999, , with Giangilberto Monti * Piuma danzante, Greco&Greco;, 1999 * Messaggi dal piccolo zoo, Archinto, 1999 * Storie zoppe, Lupetti e Manni, 1995 * Corpo, Mobydick, 2001 * Settore editoriale, Archinto, 2001 * Visite guidate, Archinto, 2004 * Commedianti a Milano, Aliberti, 2005 * Telefono, Gaffi, 2006 * Lettere a Giuseppe Pontiggia: il cercatore di funghi in Carinzia, Archinto, 2006 * L'uccellino della radio, Gaffi, 2008 * Vittorio Imbriani, Dio ne scampi dagli Orsenigo & Vittorio Orsenigo, Dio ne scampi dagli Imbriani, Aragno editore * Rina ne uccide quattro, Aliberti, 2009 * Collezioni: un amoroso safari, Archinto, 2009 * Spiagge, Greco & Greco, 2010 * Tanti viaggi, Archinto, 2011 * La camera d'ambra, Greco & Greco, 2013 * I pizzini di Amblar, Lietocolle, 2013 * Cosa trovi nell'acqua, Archinto, 2014, * A Enea Finzi non sparano in fronte, Imprimatur RCS libri, 2015, =Translations and curatorships= * Guillaume Apollinaire, Il poeta assassinato, Greco&Greco;, 1991 * Carlo Collodi, Giannettino * Carlo Collodi, Pip√¨ lo scimmiottino color di rosa * Angelo Maria Ricci, Gli sposi fedeli * Samuel Johnson, La storia di Rasselas Principe di Abissinia, Sellerio, 1993 * A Giacomo Casanova.

It was set up as an online scheme in July 2014, attracted funds of about 50 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) from 900,000 investors, and ceased to trade in December 2015. On 1 February 2016, the scheme was closed down and 21 involved people were arrested. Zhang Min, the president of the parent company, Yucheng Global, told investigators that the company operated as a Ponzi scheme. Ponzi scheme Individuals who wanted to take part in the scheme invested their money in the expectation that the money would be lent to borrowers and repaid, with interest, over time. Investors would be matched with borrowers over the Internet. The scheme promised to pay investors around seven times the interest rates that could be obtained by depositing the money with a bank in the normal way, with interest rates of between 9% and 14.6% being promised. The company sponsored the online broadcasts of the National People's Congress and placed advertisements on the state-run China Central Television, both of which gave people confidence in the scheme. Over a thousand sales agencies were established across the country to promote the scheme to the general public, and tens of thousands of customers were joining each week. Many of its customers were small investors from rural areas. Several factors encouraged people to think the scheme was \\"approved\\" by the authorities: the prominent positioning of its ads just before the main evening CCTV news bulletin, its participation in the 12th China-Association of Southeast Asian Nations Expo, its announcement of the formation of a militia at an event attended by senior officials of the People's Liberation Army, and its doing business nationwide across China and in neighbouring Burma. Downfall Ezubao unexpectedly stopped trading in December 2015. Worried customers started complaining and the police started investigating. The official Xinhua News Agency reported on 1 February 2016 that 21 people involved in the scheme had been arrested, including Ding Ning, chairman of the Yucheng Group. Chinese police reported that they were investigating the peer- to-peer lending company and had frozen and seized its assets, and those of the companies linked to it. The president of the parent company, Zhang Min, had told them that the company operated as a Ponzi scheme, with money from new investors used to pay money due to earlier investors; it is reported that about 50 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) had been invested in the scheme by about 900,000 investors. The authorities announced in early February that Ezubao clients could register their grievances on the web site of the Ministry of Public Security. Xinhua reported that Ezubao had been under scrutiny since December 2015. An investigation into the company by local authorities had found that about 95% of the investments made were fake and that the purpose of the lending platform was to enrich senior executives. Chairman Ding Ning, for example, was reported to have recently spent $150 million on gifts, designer goods, luxury cars, and property. Xinhua further reported that, in an effort to conceal their fraudulent activities, the perpetrators had concealed 1,200 documents in 80 bags, and had buried these underground on the edge of the provincial capital, Hefei. The police had managed to unearth the documents after twenty hours of work with two excavators. Analytical commentary Victor Shih, associate professor of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego commented: \\"The awkward truth is that Chinese regulators either knew about the scam and did nothing, or they completely missed the massive fraud\\". He added \\"Did provincial regulators know? They had to know\\".

A member of an aristocratic family within the ruling circle of the Fatimid Caliphate, he helped suppress the great revolt of Abu Yazid in 943‚Äì947 and was the sent as governor of Sicily from 948 until 953, when he returned to Ifriqiya. He was succeeded in Sicily by his son Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Kalbi, but led several campaigns in Sicily and southern Italy against the Byzantines in 955‚Äì958, as well as the raid against Almeria that sparked a brief conflict with the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba in 955. He died at Palermo in 964, during another campaign against the Byzantines. Biography As evidenced by his nisba, Hasan hailed from the Arab Banu Kalb tribe, and belonged to an aristocratic family established in Ifriqiya since the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. The family had evidently embraced the Fatimid regime after the overthrow of the Aghlabids in 909, and his father Ali had served the Fatimids with distinction, being killed by the rebellious populace in Agrigento in 938, and both Hasan and his brother Ja'far were close associates of Jawdhar, the powerful chamberlain and chief minister of Caliph al-Mansur bi-Nasr Allah. Hasan first came to prominence during the Kharijite revolt of Abu Yazid, which lasted from 944 to 947 and spread across Ifriqiya, almost resulting in the downfall of the Fatimid Caliphate. During this conflict, Hasan made Constantine his base, and with the aid of the Kutama Berbers was able to reclaim for the Fatimids the north of Ifriqiya, including B√©ja and Tunis, of which he was appointed governor. =Governorship of Sicily= Following the death of Abu Yazid and the end of his revolt, Caliph al-Mansur sent him to Sicily, where another revolt had broken out in Palermo in April 947, overthrowing the Fatimid governor, Ibn Attaf. At the same time the Byzantines, encouraged by Fatimid weakness, had stopped paying the tribute agreed in 932 for their possessions in Sicily and southern Italy. Sailing to Sicily, Hasan suppressed the rebellion in Palermo with such swiftness and severity that the Byzantines hastened to pay three years' worth of arrears of the tribute, although it is unclear whether this was done by the central government in Constantinople or was a local initiative. At the same time, the Byzantines came into contact with the Fatimids' western rivals, the Umayyad Caliphate of C√≥rdoba in al-Andalus, for joint action against the Fatimids. Emperor Constantine VII also sent reinforcements to Italy under the commanders Malakenos and Makroioannes, which arrived at Otranto and united with the local forces of the theme of Calabria under its strategos, Paschalios. In response, Hasan notified al-Mansur and asked for reinforcements. An army of 7,000 cavalry and 3,500 infantry was prepared, and under the command of the eunuch Faraj Muhaddad arrived at Palermo in June 951. A year later, in June/July, the two Fatimid commanders sailed from Sicily and invaded Calabria, attacking several towns, including Gerace and Cassano. The Byzantine troops not only failed to confront them, but withdrew to Bari, and the besieged towns preferred to ransom themselves than suffer the consequences of a sack. After Cassano, the Fatimids withdrew to their winter quarters at Messina, although al-Mansur had commanded them to remain in Italy. The Caliph sharply rebuked the commanders and ordered them to return to the Italian mainland, but this did not happen until the next spring. On 7 May 952, Hasan defeated the Byzantine army under Malakenos and Paschalios at Gerace. He then laid siege to the town and sacked Petracucca. Following the defeat at Gerace, Constantine VII sent an envoy, John Pilatos, who arranged a truce with Hasan, followed by a treaty concluded on 7 September before al-Mansur. Not only did the Byzantines agree to resume payment of tribute, but before leaving Calabria, Hasan erected a mosque at Reggio and had the Byzantines swear to respect the Muslims' right to worship and call the prayer there, and that any Muslim prisoner who sought refuge there would be set free. The treaty also stipulated that \\"as much as a single stone\\" were removed from it, all churches in Sicily and Ifriqiya would be razed. Following the death of al-Mansur on 19 March 953, Hasan returned to Ifriqiya to present himself to the new ruler, al-Mu'izz li- Din Allah. There he remained thereafter, retaining his position as one of the chief commanders, and as head of the Kalbid family. His post as governor in Sicily passed to his son Ahmad. This dynastic succession heralded the beginning of Kalbid rule over Sicily as Fatimid viceroys, which lasted until the civil strife and the political fragmentation of the island in the 1030s. =Naval war against the Umayyads and Byzantines= Gold dinar of al-Mu'izz In 955, war was renewed, when an Andalusian merchant ship intercepted a Fatimid ship carrying diplomatic correspondence; fearing that it would alert Fatimid privateers, the Andalusians not only removed its rudder, but took along the case containing the dispatches it carried. Enraged, al-Mu'izz ordered Hasan to pursue, but he was unable to catch the ship before it reached the port of Almeria. Without hesitating, Hasan took his squadron into the harbour, plundered it and the arsenal, burned the Umayyad ships anchored there, and returned to Ifriqiya. The Umayyads responded by sending admiral Ghalib with a fleet of 70 vessels to Ifriqiya. The Umayyad fleet raided the port of al- Kharaz and the environs of Susa and Tabarqa. Fatimid sources report that the Umayyads proposed joint action with Byzantium, but although an expeditionary force under Marianos Argyros was sent to Italy, it occupied itself with suppressing local revolts rather than engaging the Fatimids, and the Byzantine envoys offered to renew and extend the existing truce. Al-Mu'izz however, determined to expose the Umayyads' collaboration with the infidel enemy and emulate the achievements of his father, refused. The Caliph dispatched two fleets to Sicily, the first under Hasan's brother Ammar ibn Ali al-Kalbi, and the second later under Hasan himself and Jawhar al-Siqilli. The Fatimid sources report that the Byzantine fleet was heavily defeated in the Straits of Messina, and that the Fatimids plundered Calabria, whereupon Marianos Argyros visited the caliphal court and arranged for a renewal of the truce. In 957 however the Byzantines under the protokarabos Basil destroyed the mosque at Reggio and raided Termini, near Palermo. Hasan suffered heavy losses in a storm off Mazara, which dispersed his fleet and killed many of the crews; the survivors were then attacked by the Byzantines, who destroyed 12 ships. Another effort by Argyros to renew the truce in autumn failed, and in the next year, Hasan and Ammar defeated his forces in Sicily. However, Emperor Constantine VII sent reinforcements to Italy and soon after, as it was returning from Calabria to Sicily, the Fatimid fleet was again wrecked in a storm, in which Ammar perished (on 24 September 958, according to the Cambridge Chronicle). As a result, al-Mu'izz accepted the proposals for a renewed five-year truce in 958. =Rometta campaign= Following the Byzantine reconquest of Crete in 960‚Äì961, where the Fatimids, constrained by their truce with the Empire and the distances involved, were unable or unwilling to interfere, the Fatimids once more turned their attention to Sicily, where they decided to reduce the remaining Byzantine outposts: Taormina, the forts in the Val Demone and Val di Noto, and Rometta. Taormina fell to Hasan's son Ahmad on Christmas Day 962, after more than nine months of siege, and in the next year his cousin, al-Hasan ibn Ammar al-Kalbi, laid siege to Rometta. The garrison of the latter sent for aid to Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas, who prepared a major expedition, led by the patrikios Niketas Abalantes and his own nephew, Manuel Phokas, which landed at Messina in October 964. At the same time, Hasan led Berber troops as reinforcements to Sicily to assist the efforts to capture Rometta. While the Fatimid army defeated the Byzantines before Rometta and then destroyed their fleet at the Battle of the Straits, Hasan himself remained in Palermo, where he died in November/December 964 at the age of 53.

The town was mainly developed in the mid-19th century, when it served as the main winter port for Bangor, and features a high concentration of Greek Revival and Italianate architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history Winterport is located in northeastern Waldo County, on the west bank of the Penobscot River. Its village center is located in the southeastern part of town, on the banks of the river. Unlike the city of Bangor, to the north at the river's head of navigation, the river at Winterport was always free of ice in winter. Winterport was part of Frankfort until 1860. As Bangor's lumber industry boomed, Winterport also grew, as its major supply and shipping point in the winter. Its fortunes were largely ended by the Panic of 1857, resulting in a significant concentration of buildings in the village that were built in the preceding decades. The historic extends mainly along Main Street (United States Route 1A), from Holmes Street in the south to Cove Brook (just north of Merrill Lane). Additional properties lie in the district on the roads leading toward the river, and inland along Lebanon and Elm Streets, the major roads leading into the town's interior. The district covers and includes 150 primary buildings. Many of these are residential properties in the Greek Revival style, and were built between the 1830s and 1850s. Notable non-residential buildings include Winterport's Italianate Town Hall, and four 19th-century churches, including the Winterport Congregational Church, whose design is credited to the regionally significant architect Calvin Ryder.

The project represents phase II of the 4 year Vertical Shaft Brick Kiln (VSBK) project and was launched in November 2013 with a duration of another 4 years. About the Project The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) funded ‚ÄúEnergy Efficient Clay Brick (EECB)‚Äù Project aims to foster sustained and broad-based Energy Efficiency (EnE) in the Clay Brick Sector, by targeting the entire market system. Based on this market system approach, the EECB Project ‚Äì which has evolved from and forms the second phase of the Vertical Shaft Brick Kiln Project (2009 ‚Äì 2013) ‚Äì invests in a diverse set of stakeholders within the Clay Brick Sector of South Africa, by supporting and capacitating clay brick makers and industry service providers in adopting a systematic approach to energy management. The Project not only contributes to technology transfer, but also addresses sector constraints within the enabling environment as well as the demand levels of the clay brick market system. Project Objectives The overall objective of the EECB Project is to facilitate EnE within the Clay Brick Sector, reducing CO2 emissions and thereby contributing towards the country‚Äôs overall targets in increasing EnE and lowering carbon emissions. By October 2017, the EECB Project expects to reach 50 producers who reduce their CO2 emissions by 320,000 tCO2 annually and reach a 10 percent reduction in overall input energy. On the supply side, the project engages actively with clay brick producers and related service providers, equipping them with the necessary capacity and knowledge needed to shift to more energy efficient production practices including the Vertical Shaft Brick Kiln (VSBK) and Habla Zig Zag Kiln (HZZK) http://www.hablakilns.com/ technologies. With regards to a more enabling environment, EECB facilitates a close cooperation between private and public stakeholders and facilitates the access to specific financial products and funding schemes. On the demand side of the bricks sub-sector, the project promotes the use of energy efficient clay brick among the building sector in an effort to grow market share and create a pull effect for the main drivers of change - the buyers. Achievements Since its implementation in November 2013, the EECB has gained recognition amongst the South African Clay Brick Sector through its close partnership with the South African Clay Brick Association http://www.claybrick.org (CBA) as well as the Energy Efficiency Sector. Notable Successes * The successful transfer of the VSBK technology to the South African Clay Brick Makers * total reduction of 7.200tCO2 per year by mid 2015 since 2013 * Completed construction of 24 VSBK shafts and an additional 22 shafts to be constructed in 2016 * 88% of brick makers have sought out energy efficient measures since the projects inception * An increasing number of brick makers are conducting energy audits * Establishment of the Clay Brick Sector Energy Guidelines and Best Practices with the assistance of Carbon Trust Reference Page References Category:Energy conservation ","title":"Energy efficient clay brick project"},{"id":"49300191","text":"St Alban's, Cheam, also known as the Church of St Alban the Martyr, is one of three Church of England churches in the parish of Cheam in the London Borough of Sutton.

The law, known as the \\"Criminal Nature of the Communist Regime\\", requires that signs and items created during the communist regime glorifying the former communist party and its leaders be removed from public places.

Joint amicus curiae brief, p. 13 = Estonia = In early 2007 the Riigikogu was proceeding a draft bill amending the Penal Code to make the public use of Soviet and Nazi symbols punishable if used in a manner disturbing the public peace or inciting hatred. The bill did not come into effect as it passed only the first reading in the Riigikogu. = Georgia = In Georgia the use of Soviet-era symbols on government buildings is prohibited, as is their display in public spaces, although this law is rarely enforced by authorities. A ban on communist symbols was first proposed in 2010, but it failed to define the applicable sanctions. In 2014, there was a proposal to amend the ban to introduce clearer parameters. = Germany = The Flag of East Germany was outlawed as an unconstitutional and criminal symbol in West Germany and West Berlin, where it was referred to as the (secessionist flag) until the late 1960s, when the ban was lifted. The emblem and flag of the Communist Party of Germany are still banned in the country under section 86a of the German criminal code. = Hungary = Hungary had a law (Article 269/B of the Criminal Code (2000)) that banned the use of symbols of fascist and communist dictatorships.Hungarian Criminal Code 269 / B. ¬ß 1993 The same year the Constitutional Court upheld the law when it was challenged, claiming that the involved restriction of the freedom of expression was justified.Joint amicus curiae brief, p. 9 In July 2008 the European Court of Human Rights considered the challenge of Attila Vajnai who was charged with a misdemeanor for use of the red star and declared the Hungarian law to be in violation of the freedom of expression. The Court recognised the gross violations by the Nazi and communist regimes; however, it noted that modern Hungary is a stable democracy with negligible chance of dictatorship, therefore restrictions on the freedom of expression have no justification in the country in the form of a \\"clear, pressing and specific social need\\". Eventually the law was annulled in 2013 by the Constitutional Court, citing the lack of precise definition and the European Court of Human Rights. In March 2017, Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n introduced a draft law that outlaws merchandise featuring symbols like the Nazi swastika or the communist five-pointed red star, including the one used by the Dutch brewing company Heineken. = Indonesia = Anti-communist propaganda leaflets and literature, blaming the Indonesian Communist Party for being the actor of 30 September Movement Communism, alongside Marxism and Marxism-Leninism, was officially banned in Indonesia following the aftermath of the 30 September coup attempt and the subsequent anti-communist killings, by adoption of TAP MPRS no. 25/1966 in 1966 and Undang Undang no. 27/1999 in 1999, which are still in force. The law does not explicitly declare a ban on symbols of communism, but Indonesian police frequently use the law to arrest people displaying them.Police chief explanation on banned hammer and sickle symbol in Indonesia (in Indonesian) Some of its violators were people with no knowledge of symbols of communism, in which cases the authorities frequently freed them with only minor punishment or small fine applied.Farmer arrested after wearing shirt with hammer and sickle (in Indonesian) The display of such symbols in an attempt to propagate communist and/or Marxist-Leninist ideals are considered a high treason, and could be punished by up to 20 years of prison.Explanations on banning communism and Marxism-Leninism in Indonesia (in Indonesian)Undang Undang no.27/1999, laws on Communism and Marxism-Leninism (Indonesian) This makes Indonesia a country with a very strict anti-communist policy compared to other countries that also practised anti-communism. Other socialist and left- wing related symbols, while not officially prohibited by law (as democratic socialism itself remained acceptable in the country) are still widely condemned by the Indonesian people and considered as being closely related to Communism in general. These include the red star, the socialist heraldry, the red flag, and anthems or slogans such as The Internationale and \\"Workers of the world, unite!\\". Despite this, The Internationale was still remained in use during International Labour Day. In addition, since the New Order regime was established in 1967, the hammer and sickle has become stigmatised in the country, which itself is very similar to how Nazi symbolism is treated in the West in general. As such, displaying the symbol in public, even without any political intentions, is still regarded as highly offensive, especially among Indonesian Muslims and Christians due to a widespread allegation of religious persecution by the Indonesian Communist Party in the years leading up to the 1965 purges. Indonesia is the one of the first countries in the world to introduce a ban on communist symbols, not including the Axis countries during World War II. In April 2017, Indonesian police detained a Malaysian tourist at a hotel in Mataram for wearing a T-shirt with an image of the hammer and sickle symbol. The tourist was not aware that communist symbols were banned in Indonesia. The police seized the T-shirt and released the tourist after giving him a warning. In May 2018, a Russian tourist was also detained by police in Bali for displaying a Soviet victory banner, which also contains the symbol. = Iran = Communist symbols along with the Marxist-Leninist and communist ideologies are banned in Iran since 1949 and again in the early 1980s following the Iranian Revolution. This included the Tudeh Party of Iran and the People's Mojahedin of Iran. = Latvia = In June 2013, the Latvian parliament approved a ban on the display of Soviet and Nazi symbols at all public events. The ban involves flags, anthems, uniforms, Nazi swastika, and the Soviet hammer and sickle. = Lithuania = Lithuania banned Soviet and Nazi symbols in 2008 (Article 18818 of the Code of Administrative Offences) under the threat of a fine. Article 5 of the Law on Meetings prohibits meetings involving Nazi and Soviet imagery.Joint amicus curiae brief, p. 11 As of 2015, the laws were in effect. = Moldova = In 2009, such a ban was proposed in Moldova by parliamentarian Oleg Serebryan, and the law came into effect in 2012. The Constitutional Court of Moldova found it unconstitutional. = Poland = In 2009, in Poland ¬ß 2 to 4 were added to Article 256, which ban \\"fascist, communist or other totalitarian symbols\\" unless used \\"as part of artistic, educational, collecting or academic activity.\\" On 19 July 2011, the Constitutional Tribunal of Poland found this ban partly unconstitutional due to the violation of freedom of expression.Joint amicus curiae brief, p. 12 In June 2017, Poland updated its \\"decommunization\\" legislation to include Soviet propaganda monuments, prompting negative reactions from the Russian government. However, communist symbols are not prohibited by law in Poland. = Romania = Law 51/1991, article 3. h) on the National Security of Romania considers the following as threats to national security: \\"the initiation, organisation, perpetration, or the supporting in any way of the totalitarian or extremist actions of a communist, fascist, iron guardist, or of any other origin, of the racial, anti-Semitic, revisionist, separatist actions that can endanger in any way the unity and territorial integrity of Romania, as well as the instigation to deeds that can put in, danger the order of the state governed by the rule of law\\". However, symbols are not specifically mentioned in the Law. = South Korea = Similar to West Germany's ban on the East German flag, the North Korean flag and its Worker's Party flag are prohibited in South Korea as an unconstitutional symbol though some exceptions exist. = Taiwan = Communist symbols along with the Marxist-Leninist and communist ideologies are banned in Taiwan since May 2020 after dissolution of Taiwan Democratic Communist Party. = Ukraine = In April 2015 the Verkhovna Rada passed a law banning communist and Nazi symbols. Earlier, in 2012, the city of Lviv in Western Ukraine banned the public display of communist symbols. On 17 December 2015, all communist parties were officially banned in Ukraine. Singing or playing the former anthem of the Soviet Union or any other former anthems of the Soviet Republics is punishable with a sentence of up to five years in prison. In July 2019, the Constitutional Court upheld the law, equating communism to Nazism. = United States = During the Red Scare of 1919‚Äì20 in the United States, many states passed laws forbidding the display of red flags, including Minnesota, South Dakota, Oklahoma,Zechariah Chafee, Jr., Freedom of Speech (NY: Harcourt, Brace and Howe, 1920), 180ff., Appendix V and California (mostly due to the reaction of the Vietnamese Americans community at Californiain the 1919-20?). In Stromberg v. California, the United States Supreme Court held that such laws are unconstitutional.Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359 (1931).  European Union  In January 2005, Vytautas Landsbergis, backed by other Members of the European Parliament, such as J√≥zsef Sz√°jer from Hungary, urged a ban on the communist symbols in the European Union, in addition to Nazi symbols. In February 2005, the European Commission rejected calls for a proposed Europe-wide ban on Nazi symbols to be extended to cover communist symbols as well on the basis that it was not appropriate to deal with this issue in rules aimed at combatting racism. However, this rejection did not rule out the individual member states having their own laws in this respect.JOINT AMICUS CURIAE BRIEF, p. 24 In December 2010, the European Commission published a report titled \\"The memory of the crimes committed by totalitarian regimes in Europe\\" addressed to the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, in which it mentions the banning of communist symbols by some Member states (Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, and Lithuania) and concludes that \\"the European Union has a role to play, within the scope of its powers in this area, to contribute to the processes engaged in the Member States to face up to the legacy of totalitarian crimes\\". In September 2019, the European Parliament approved a joint motion for a \\"Resolution on the importance of European remembrance for the future of Europe\\" with 535 votes in favour, 66 against and 52 abstentions. Specifically, in points 17 and 18 of the resolution \\"expresses concern about the continued use of symbols belonging to totalitarian systems in the public sphere and for commercial purposes\\", as well as noting \\"the continued existence in public spaces in some Member States of monuments and memorials (parks, squares, streets etc.) glorifying totalitarian regimes, which paves the way for the distortion of historical facts about the consequences of the Second World War and for the propagation of the totalitarian political system\\".

The civilian GP-4u gas mask consists of the face-piece, the hose and a cylinder-shaped filter, which is screwed onto the end of the hose. As the wearer breathes in air, the filter gets rid of certain poisonous materials as well as toxins and microorganisms. The face-piece of the mask consists of rubber that comes in three colors: Black, White and green, the green being the most common color found on GP-4u gas masks, as well as two round glass lenses attached to the face-piece via metal. On the bottom side of the gas mask is the inhale-valve (on the front) which is where the hose starts, and an exhale valve behind it.

By being excluded from the CNS, drugs may act on the rest of the body without producing side-effects related to their effects on the brain or spinal cord. For example, most opiates cause sedation when given at a sufficiently high dose, but peripherally selective opiates can act on the rest of the body without entering the brain and are less likely to cause sedation.

Despite coming from a simple family background, he became one of the most prominent members of Crimea's Karaim community in his era. Ilya Kazas was a highly educated man who knew 11 languages, including 4 ancients.  Biography  After graduating from the model Aben-Yashar Lutsk's school and \\"writing a poem on the majestic language of the Bible\\" he worked for 6 months as a clerk in one of the most fashionable stores in Odessa. From 1853 to 1855 Kazas studied at Moscow University, but in October 1855 before completing his studies, he entered the Faculty of Oriental Languages of St. Petersburg University. On September 16, 1859, Kazas graduated from the course, by defending his Ph.D., and became the first of the Crimean Karaites to be educated to that level with a scientific higher education degree. From St. Petersburg, Kazas moved to Odessa where, in 1859, he opened a private school, working there only for a short time. In 1863 he moved to Simferopol taking up a position as a history teacher at Simferopol gymnasium ‚Ññ1, where he worked for 18 years. In 1872, Kazas was the author of the project to create Simferopol Tatar Teachers' School. From 1881 to 1894 he worked as an inspector. Furthermore, he held the post of censor the newspaper \\"–ü–µ—Ä–µ–≤–æ–¥—á–∏–∫- –¢–µ—Ä–¥–∂–∏–º–∞–Ω\\" (before 1905) and chaired the \\"Tsar Alexander Karaim Spiritual Academy\\". His high prestige among the Crimean Karaites is clearly evidenced by the fact that he was an adviser to Hakham S. M. Pampulov. He has published books such as \\"◊ú◊®◊í◊ú ◊î◊ô◊ú◊ì◊ô◊ù\\" (\\"Guide for children\\") (written in Hebrew in 1868‚Äì1869) and \\"Russian textbook for elementary schools Tatar\\", written in 1873‚Äì1875. Ilya Ilyich distinguished himself vividly as a brilliant translator. Thanks to his efforts his contemporary compatriots gained access to many famous literary works, such as \\"Torat Gaadam\\" (\\"Principles of Ethics\\") and \\"Kivshono Shel Olam\\" (\\"World Secrets\\"), in which Kazas summarized and processed the works of French authors Paul Janet and Jules Simon. He edited the Odessa published Karaim Journal \\"Davul\\" (\\"Drum\\") and Simferopol newspaper \\"Tauris\\". He died in Yalta on the 14th of January 1912 and was buried in the Yevpatorian Karaim cemetery. The tombstone from the grave of Kazas is located in the lapidarium Karaim Kenesa in Yevpatoria.  Family  He was married to Byubyush Berahovne Panpulovoy a cousin of Hakham S. M. Pampulov.

These are largely woven with Kachchhi motifs in Bhujodi village of Kutch. Traditionally Kachchhi weavers belong to Marwada and Maheswari communities. Kachchhi shawls have received geographical indication tag under the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999. Origin There are two stories about the migration of weavers into the Kutch region around 500 years ago. According to the first story a girl belonging to a rich Rabari family was married to a man in Kutch and she was given a weaver in dowry. This family of weavers grew into a large community in the following years. The second story is related to Ramdev Pir who came to Kutch from Rajasthan. Soon enough some of his followers built a temple in his praise and asked him to bring some of his kin from Marwar, Rajasthan to take care of the temple. This led to the settlement of the Meghwal community of weavers in Kutch.

The building is situated in the N√∏rre Stenbro neighborhood on Kystvejen 59-65 and Mejlgade 92 in the city center. It was the first large, privately built apartment complex in the city and a social hub for the upper class in the early 20th century. Mejlborg is named for the adjacent Mejlgade street. \\"Mejl\\" is derived from the old-Danish word for middle and \\"borg\\" means castle making Mejlborg the middle- castle or the castle in the middle.  History  The ruins of the first Mejlborg under artillery fire after the fire that burned it down in 1897. Mejlborg was built in 1896-98 by drawings of architect Sophus Frederik K√ºhnel. It was built on the site of the former Mejlgade city gate where the city walls had marked the limit of the city prior to 1871. Mejlborg was the first building of its size in the city and it towered above the nearby merchants houses in the nearby Latin Quarter. Mejlborg was designed with expansive apartments on the east side facing Kystvejen with a commanding view of the Bay of Aarhus. The ground floor had a fashionable restaurant initially operated by the restaurateur Christian Madsen. In 1899 a fire broke out in a sawmill in Mejlgade and the fire razed 14 buildings in the north end of the street, including Mejlborg, left with only its outer shell standing. Aarhus was at the time home to an artillery regiment housed in Langelandsgade Barracks and the soldiers subsequently used the ruins for target practice in a questionable bid to safely pull down the remains of the building. Mejlborg was rebuilt the same year of the fire and was completed in an almost identical form. The restaurant was re-established with a new owner and functioned until 1960 when it closed. Mejlborg functioned as a hotel for a brief period in the early 20th century but never with much success. Today Mejlborg only has residential units apart from the former restaurant on the ground floor which is used for offices.  Architecture  The building is characterized by a historicist Gothic Renaissance style with richly decorated facades. The facade facing the coast is divided in 3 sections each with a row of 3 windows. The outermost sections protrude slightly and have large Gothic crow-stepped gables, bay windows, avant-corps and balconies. The middle section share many features but lack the gables and instead have dormer windows in the ridged roof. The main entrance is an octagonal tower topped with an onion dome with a small bell tower and spire on top of it.

During his career, R√§ty served e.g. in Brussels during 1994‚Äì1997 as the military attach√© and as a liaison officer with NATO, and in the KFOR operation in Kosovo in 2000, as the head of the Finnish battalion. In 2006, R√§ty was in a committee recommended that Finland purchase Airbus A330 MRTT jets that could be used both by Finnair and the Finnish Defence Forces. They would have been used primarily by Finnair, but they could have been modified in 24 hours to suit the needs of the military, both as cargo planes and tanker planes. This would have enabled the Finnish Defence to train its F-18 Hornet pilots to refuel while airborne. The recommendation was not adopted by the state.

Career Katulkar joined Judicial Services for Madhya Pradesh in 1985. During the formation of Chhattisgarh, he opted to stay at Chhattisgarh. He has dealt with several high profile cases during his time in Chhattisgarh, India. =2009 Korba Chimney Collapse= Katulkar was appointed as Principal District & Session Judge in April 2009, and assigned a post at Korba. After taking the post, he was assigned the 2009 Korba chimney collapse Case, which is to date the most deadly industrial disaster in Chhattisgarh, claiming more than 40 lives. On November 26, 2009, he rejected bail pleas of BALCO officials, including Vice President and AGM of BALCO. He then sent the pair into judicial custody. Later, on 18 January 2010, Katulkar rejected the bail pleas of three Chinese nationals who were contracted by SEPCO to build the power plant by BALCO. In February, 2010, Katulkar was transferred from Korba to Kanker, North Bastar, retaining his role as Principal District & Session Judge. = Naxal Cases = While at Kanker, he heard record number of cases involving Naxals, and convicted and sentenced many naxal leaders and hardcore naxals. =Jhaliamari Rape Case= In May 2013, Katulkar initiated the hearing of the Jhaliamari Rape Case. In this case, 15 tribal girls aged between 10 and 13 years were raped by hostel officials over a two year period in a government run Tribal Hostel in Jhaliamari Village, Kanker. Although the whole village knew about the crimes, the matter was covered up. During the trial, nearly 100 witnesses were examined, as well as a paper record totaling over 1,000 pages. He decided the case after less than six months, and on 30 October 2013, he delivered a 250 page judgment convicting all of the accused in the case, saying, ‚ÄúThe ghastly inhuman act of convicts cannot be condoned and a substantive and stern sentence if not imposed will be miscarriage of justice. The message to be sent by court has to be loud and clear and that is ‚ÄúDon't Mess with a Child‚Äù and any person who meddles with the child in any manner shall not be spared as children are nation's most precious assets and most vulnerable citizens‚Äù. Further, stating that the victims came from poor tribal families that were mercilessly gang-raped by public servants, he ordered State Government to pay a compensation of Rs. 1.5 Crores (15 million), the highest compensation ever awarded in a rape case in India. This compensation was paid in addition to any other relief granted by the state. In the judgment he made the following comment on the stigma of rape in society: > Women are told not to get raped; they must stay out of rapist's way. Attempt > is to prevent the sexual assault by focusing on altering the behaviour of > the victim. They are expected to learn martial arts, not go through parks > alone and other ways make themselves as less accessible to sexual assault as > is humanly possible. This is often extended to children also. This results > not in the prevention of sexual assault but, the prevention of sexual > assault on cautious women and children. The attacker continues to victimise > the young, weak, vulnerable and uninformed. Sexual assaults are not > prevented from this approach but, rather displaced‚Ä¶Secondary victimization > of a victim can be far worse if not as bad as the actual sexual abuse > itself. It's a general experience that rather than lending a helping hand to > such people, a significant part of our society chooses to humiliate and push > them into darkness of loneliness and agony. They are viewed as ‚Äúdamaged‚Äù and > every attempt is made to force them to recall their ghastly experiences. > This is the key reason for non-reporting of such offences, which acts as > impunity to perverted criminals and they remain a constant danger to the > society especially to women and children. For every rational mind it is hard > to accept ‚ÄúWhy a victim should be blamed for what have been done to her?‚Äù > They are people who are suffering beyond description. They are innocent > people, they didn't bring this upon themselves, they are the victims of the > sins of other people, and had been punished for no reason. As Joseph De > Maistre said ‚ÄúFalse opinions are like false money, stuck first of all by > guilty men and thereafter circulated by other people who perpetuate the > crime without knowing what they are doing‚Äù. Stigmatisation of rape victims > is one such opinion prevalent in our society, created by guilty and > perpetuated by others and is violation of mankind's most fundamental duty to > protect the innocent. It is essential to renounce such practices to build a > progressive society based on virtue of equality. Later, he spoke on the mandatory reporting of sexual offences against children stating Section 21 of POSCO, Act, observing that ‚Äúin child sexual abuse cases public is generally unaware that trials are the exception rather than the rule. Only a small fraction of the cases that come to official attention end in trials. Indian society has tried very hard to sweep the issue of child sexual abuse under the carpet. Many people don't want to believe that child abuse exists, or only willing to belive [sic] that certain kinds of abuse go on. They don't want to consider that something so horrific, and yet so widespread, is taking place in their community, perhaps only a door away, a few steps from their lives or even in their lives if they would only open their eyes. In the present case, Panchayat was called off, the whole village knew about rape of minor girls but they kept mum for long time and left the children to suffer the horror. Child Sexual abuses are dark realities in Society.‚Äù He further observes that the ‚Äúrape of a child or woman not only affects her alone but such and incident leaves a devastating impact on her entire family who equally suffers in silence. Sexual abuse happens because the system of silence around the act perpetuates it. It happens as this system of silence encourages some more people to want it to happen, and so social and cultural attitudes which serve to underestimate woman and child especially, the female child, create an environment in which abuse can flourish...[sic] The rights of women and children and provisions for their protection will be circumscribed into statute books and remain a mere rhetoric until and unless people near them help in their enforcement.‚Äù As a result of this case, he asked free medical aid be provided to acid attack and rape victims. He further directed the Government to ensure proper, regular monitoring of Tribal Hostels to prevent any future incidents. =2013 Naxal Attack in Darbha Valley Case= In February 2014, Katulkar took over as Principal District and Session Judge, Bilaspur and Special Judge (NIA) for state of Chhattisgarh. Katulkar was presiding over trial of 2013 Naxal attack in Darbha valley, in which 29 people were killed by naxals including State Congress President Nandkumar Patel, his son, Former Union Minister Vidhya Charan Sukhla and Leader of Opposition and Salwa Judum Founder Mahendra Karma. In April 2014, in a major move, he ordered NIA to record voice sample of alleged Mastermind of 2013 Naxal attack in Darbha valley, Gudsa Usendi who had surrendered before Andhra Pradesh Police in Jan, 2014 and induct him as accused in the case. NIA filed the charge-sheet in the case on 26 Sep 2014. But, Special Public Prosecutor was only appointed in June, 2015. =2014 Chhattisgarh Sterilisation Deaths Case= He then presided over the 2014 Chhattisgarh Sterilization Deaths Case. The case covered the deaths of 15 women as a result because of botched sterilization procedures. He sentenced the Dr. R.K. Gupta, accused of performing the operations, to jail without bail, saying, ‚Äúoperations were carried out in an unruly manner, violating all guidelines and norms at a high speed for merely meeting out targets with unsuitable and contaminated instruments in unhygienic atmosphere despite of knowledge of the fact that it may cause death of patients. In the manner operations were conducted more like animals being slaughtered in slaughter house without the least respect to human lives. Thus, intent of operations were not treatment and an action in good faith, rather merely meeting out targets and forming records.‚Äù Katulkar further observed that, ‚Äúpoor people are not experimental apparatus for doctors rather they are as human as any rich man and their lives are equally precious...The incident had not only claimed lives of women, but also ruined several families and most importantly had deprived infants of their mothers‚Äù. He also rejected a bail plea from drug manufacturers. Later, the Supreme Court of India also denied bail to drug manufacturers. =Human Trafficking Case= After he was moved to Bilaspur, he presided over human trafficking and kidnapping case involving a 7-year-old girl. the girl had been kidnapped for forcing her into begging. The case was closed in less than one month with a guilty verdict, with the accused sentenced to seven years imprisonment. Threats Judge Katulkar has been receiving death threats from Naxals after he oversaw the conviction and sentencing of several naxal leaders and hardcore naxal figures. On 12 June 2015, an explosion was reported at his residence in Bilaspur. A threatening letter was later found at the site of blast. The letter asked him to step down from his role in the 2013 Naxal attack in Darbha valley case, which he ignored. Later on, it was discovered that he had received a similar threat in July, 2014. On 24 August 2015, another letter was thrown at his residence. Once again, the letter demanded he either step down from the 2013 Naxal attack in Darbha valley case, or to transfer the case to Jagdalpur, Bastar. The letter cited his previous convictions of naxal leaders, and threatened to kill him and his whole family should he fail to comply.

Portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence The history of King's College London, on its own, spans over 190 years since it was founded by Royal Charter. King George IV granted such charter on 14 August 1829. The full history, however, includes the medical schools than now constitute GKT School of Medical Education. This incorporates St Thomas's Hospital Medical School, one of the oldest medical schools in Britain, with a history of medical teaching that can be traced back to at least 1561. St Thomas' Hospital itself dates back to 1173, and has roots in the establishment of St Mary Overie Priory in 1106.  19th century  right = Foundation = King's College was founded in 1829 in response to the theological controversy surrounding the founding of \\"London University\\" (which later became University College London) in 1826. London University was founded, with the backing of Utilitarians, Jews and non-Anglican Christians, as a secular institution, intended to educate \\"the youth of our middling rich people between the ages of 15 or 16 and 20 or later\\"Hearnshaw (1929), p. 38 giving its nickname, \\"the godless college in Gower Street\\".Hibbert, Weinreb, Keay, Keay (2008), p. 958 The seeds of the idea that would become King's College were planted in a sermon in October 1826 by Hugh James Rose ‚Äì then Christian Advocate at the University of Cambridge, later the first Professor of Divinity at Durham University and the second Principal of King's. A year later, on 30 October 1827, a letter from 'Alpha' appeared in the Morning Post (a London newspaper of the time) which criticised London University strongly for its lack of religion and called for 'the establishment of a London University upon legitimate and constitutional principles'. This 'true and genuine \\"London University\\"' was to be established by royal charter and act of Parliament, it would have professors \\"attached to the natural religion of the State\\", and was 'to be called the \\"Academia Georgii Quarti qu√¶ Londini est,\\" the same as the University of Edinburgh is called the \\"Academia Jacobi Sexti\\"'. The next day another letter in the Morning Post from 'Omega' promised that 'whenever such a project may be attempted, my mite shall be forthcoming'. A leading article on 1 November said that the letter from 'Alpha' had 'been the predecessor of a host of others' agreeing with him in his criticism of London University. This brought forth a response from 'Alpha' starting that 'it will soon be seen whether which takes as the of its foundation, and the as its of , or the self-styled \\"University of London,\\"‚Ä¶will produce to this yet happy empire the most fertilising stream', adding that 'measures are in progress for forming a legitimate \\"London University\\"' (emphases in original). The concept of the College was defined publicly in early 1828 by George D'Oyly, Rector of Lambeth, in an open letter to Sir Robert Peel, the then Home Secretary and Leader of the House of Commons. The letter advocated establishing a second university in London, which would be like London University in teaching modern subjects but would have a distinctly Christian ethos, and was decisive in winning the backing of the Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington, for the scheme. The King's College project was officially launched at a public meeting at the Freemasons' Hall on 21 June 1828, chaired by the Prime Minister and attended by the archbishops of York, Canterbury and Armagh, Charles James Blomfield, the Bishop of London, and a number of other bishops (including, William Van Mildert, Bishop of Durham, who founded Durham University a few years later, and John Banks Jenkinson, Bishop of St David's and Dean of Durham, who had secured the Royal Charter for St David's College, Lampeter earlier that year) and two other members of the Cabinet (Peel and the Earl of Aberdeen). The meeting passed resolutions to found the College, to request permission from the King to name it 'King's College, London', to approve the general scheme that had been drawn up, to appoint a provisional committee of twenty-seven (chaired by Bishop Blomfield) to raise funds and to frame regulations and building plans, and to open books for donations and subscriptions at the major banks. After the Duke had withdrawn, along with the Archbishops and the Bishops of London, Durham and Carlisle, the Bishop of Chester took the chair to deny reports that the College would be open only to Anglicans. While the College was to be Anglican, and its professors would have to belong to the established church, it would be open to students of any religion, although they would have to submit to the regulations of the College. At the meeting, some ¬£20,000 of the total of ¬£100,000 needed (elsewhere said to be ¬£150,000) was pledged. By the start of July, this had risen to over ¬£50,000. However, disputes over Wellington and Peel's support for Catholic emancipation (see below) meant that many of the project's backers withdrew their pledges, leading to a shortfall in the sum raised by subscriptions and donations. Several potential sites for King's were discussed by the provisional committee, including Buckingham Palace and Regent's Park.Thompson (1990), p. 5 In December 1828, Peel proposed to the Bishop of London that the College be granted a site between the Strand and the Thames, running parallel to the yet unfinished Somerset House at a peppercorn rent in perpetuity. This was accepted, despite concerns of the effect of the nearby slums and theatres on the Strand on students' health and morals, and the grant was made in June 1829, with the condition that the river-front be completed in five years, matching the design of Somerset House, and the rest of the College in ten.Thompson (1990), p. 6 Schedule of Grants in Perpetuity of Parts of the Land Revenue of the Crown: \\"A piece of Ground in the parish of St. Mary-le-Strand, on the East side of Somerset house bounded on the West side by the area next the Building on the East side of Somerset house occupied by the Audit, Tax, and other Offices, on the North side by houses in the Strand on the East side by Strand Lane, and on the South side by the River Thames, except such right of Carriageway and Footway as therein mentioned as a Site for a College to be erected thereon, and called 'King's College, London'\\". The architect Robert Smirke was selected to design the building, and plans were approved (scaled back from the original budget of ¬£150,000) in July 1829. Royal charter of King's College London. Coloured engraving by H.D. Smith With the site selected and construction ready to begin, a royal charter incorporating King's College, London was granted by George IV on 14 August 1829, stating the intention of the new educational institution: Now the College was established as a legal entity with a defined constitution, the provisional committee handed over the management of the project to the College Council. The charter vested the government of the College in this council, consisting of nine official governors, five of whom were clergy, eight life governors, a treasurer, and 24 other members of the Corporation. King's College, as established by the royal charter, was a for-profit college with dividends payable to proprietors of up to four percent of profits, similar (save for King's being incorporated) to the joint stock company of London University. Despite it not being a charity, the Archbishop of Canterbury was appointed Visitor to the College by the charter. King's College London in 1831. Engraved by J. C. Carter On 26 November 1829, the contract for the building work was let. Under this contract, the body of the building was to cost just under ¬£64,000 and was to be completed by 1 December 1831. As it happened, work on the \\"carcass\\" of the building was completed by late 1830 and fitting out began. The main building, including the hall and the chapel, was finished for the opening of the College on 8 October 1831, although a lot of building and fitting remained to be completed elsewhere on the site. The cost so far had been ¬£85,900 out of ¬£113,600 raised.  1829 Duel in Battersea Fields  The Duke of Wellington's simultaneous support for an Anglican King's College London and the Roman Catholic Relief Act, which was to lead to the granting of almost full civil rights to Catholics, was challenged by George Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea, in early 1829. Winchilsea and his supporters wished for King's to be subject to the Test Acts, like the universities of Oxford, where only members of the Church of England could matriculate, and Cambridge, where non-Anglicans could matriculate but not graduate, \\"Londoners who did study, for example in Oxford or Cambridge, had to be quite rich and also members of the Anglican Church.\\" but this was not Wellington's intent. Winchilsea and about 150 other contributors withdrew their support of King's College London in response to Wellington's support of Catholic emancipation. Accusations against Wellington were published in a letter to The Standard newspaper on 14 March where Winchilsea charged the Prime Minister with insincerity in his support for King's College London.Harte (1986), p. 73 In a letter to Wellington he wrote, \\"I have come to view the college as an instrument in a wider programme designed to promote the Roman Catholic faith and undermine the established church.\\" Winchilsea also accused the Duke to have in mind \\"insidious designs for the infringement of our liberty and the introduction of Popery into every department of the State\\".Holmes (2002), p. 275 The letter provoked a furious exchange of correspondence and Wellington accused Winchilsea of imputing him with \\"disgraceful and criminal motives\\" in setting up King's College London. When Winchilsea refused to retract the remarks, Wellington ‚Äì by his own admission, \\"no advocate of duelling\\" and a virgin duellist ‚Äì demanded satisfaction in a contest of arms: \\"I now call upon your lordship to give me that satisfaction for your conduct which a gentleman has a right to require, and which a gentleman never refuses to give.\\" King's College London to Wit. The duel in Battersea Fields on 21 March 1829 by Thomas Howell Jones The result was a duel in Battersea Fields on 21 March 1829. Winchilsea did not fire, a plan he and his second almost certainly decided upon before the duel; Wellington took aim and fired wide to the right. Accounts differ as to whether Wellington missed on purpose. Wellington, noted for his poor aim, claimed he did, other reports more sympathetic to Winchilsea claimed he had aimed to kill. Honour was saved and Winchilsea wrote Wellington an apology. \\"Duel Day\\" is still celebrated on the first Thursday after 21 March every year, marked by various events throughout King's, including re-enactments. =Early years= William Otter (1831‚Äì36), the first Principal of King's College London King's opened in October 1831 with the cleric William Otter appointed as first principal and lecturer in divinity. In keeping with the intention stated back in 1828, and despite the chapel at the heart of its buildings, the initial prospectus permitted, \\"nonconformists of all sorts to enter the college freely\\".Hearnshaw (1929), p. 80 William Howley, the Archbishop of Canterbury, presided over the opening ceremony in which sermons was given in the chapel by the Archbishop on the importance of charity and by Charles James Blomfield, the Bishop of London, on the subject of combining religious instruction with intellectual culture. The governors and the professors, except the linguists, had to be members of the Church of England but the students did not,Hibbert, Weinreb, Keay, Keay (2008), p. 462 though attendance at Chapel was compulsory.Prospectus of King's College, London: academical year 1854-5, p. 7 King's was divided into a senior department and a junior department, also known as King's College School, which was originally situated in the basement of the Strand Campus. The Junior department started with 85 pupils and only three teachers, but quickly grew to 500 by 1841, outgrowing its facilities and leading it to relocate to Wimbledon in 1897 where it remains today, though it is no longer associated with King's College London. Within the Senior department teaching was divided into three courses. A general course comprised divinity, classical languages, mathematics, English literature and history. Secondly, there was the medical course. Thirdly, miscellaneous subjects, such as law, political economy and modern languages, which were not related to any systematic course of study at the time and depended for their continuance on the supply of occasional students. In 1833 the general course was reorganised leading to the award of the Associate of King's College (AKC), the first qualification issued by King's. The course, which concerns questions of ethics and theology, is still awarded today to students and staff who take an optional three-year course alongside their studies. The Embankment terrace entrance to the Strand Campus overlooking the right Following a further appeal for funds in 1832, the river frontage was completed in April 1835 at a cost of ¬£7,100,Thompson (1986), p. 6 its completion a condition of King's College London securing the site from the Crown. Unlike those in the school, student numbers in the Senior department remained almost stationary during King's first five years of existence. During this time the medical school was blighted by inefficiency and the divided loyalties of the staff leading to a steady decline in attendance. One of the most important appointments was that of Charles Wheatstone as professor of Experimental Philosophy. At this time, neither King's, nor \\"London University\\", had the ability to confer degrees, nor did the Medical schools at the London hospitals. Henry Brougham, chairman of the governors of \\"London University\\", became Lord Chancellor in 1830, in which position he automatically became a governor of King's. \\"London University\\" applied for a Royal Charter in 1830 that would (unlike King's charter as a college) recognise it as a university, thus giving it the right to grant degrees. This charter was approved by the government lawyers, but blocked by Oxford and Cambridge before it could receive the Great Seal. The application was renewed in 1833 and debated by the Privy Council in 1834. King's did not join Oxford, Cambridge and the Medical schools in objecting to the charter, but it was clear that if \\"London University\\" received degree awarding powers and official status as a university, the same would be expected for King's. However, before the issue could be resolved the Whig government fell, removing Brougham from office. In 1835, following a \\"prayer\\" to the King from the House of Commons to grant \\"London University\\" their charter, the government announced that it would establish a separate examining board to grant degrees, with \\"London University\\" and King's both being affiliated colleges in Arts and Laws. This became the University of London in 1836, the former \\"London University\\" becoming University College, London (UCL). The governors at King's were offended at the exclusion of divinity from the syllabus of the University, and advised students to take the Oxford or Cambridge examinations. However, the power of the University to confer degrees marked a period of limited expansion at King's. In early 1836, Bishop van Mildert of Durham died. The new Bishop of Durham was Edward Maltby, one of the founders of UCL and then Bishop of Chichester. William Otter was appointed Bishop of Chichester in his place, leaving a vacancy as Principal of King's that was filled by Hugh James Rose, who had been Professor of Divinity at Durham. Both Maltby and Otter were named to the Senate of the new University of London in late 1836. Maltby had resigned as preacher of Lincoln's Inn in 1835, his replacement there was John Lonsdale, a member of King's College's Council who had been offered, but refused, the post of Principal at the foundation of the College. When Rose's health failed in 1838, Lonsdale stepped in as acting principal of King's, taking the job on a permanent basis in 1839 when news of Rose's death in Italy reached England. He held the post until 1843, when he was appointed Bishop of Lichfield. His successor as Principal was Richard William Jelf, a canon of Oxford Cathedral, who held the post until 1868. In 1838, King's set up only the second engineering course in Britain, which was (as the course established at Durham closed after only a few years) the oldest department of engineering in the country until its closure in 2013. The study of English Literature as a distinct subject was also pioneered by King's. Also in 1838, the Pluralities Act was passed, making it illegal for Church of England clergy to live outside of their parish. An exemption was, however, made for the \\"Principal of King's College, London, during the Time for which he may be required to reside and shall actually reside therein\\", allowing the Principal to hold a benefice elsewhere yet reside in the College. = Mid 19th Century Development = In 1839, the first degrees of the University of London were awarded to King's and UCL students. The Principal, John Lonsdale, stated publicly at the College prizegiving that year that \\"it was probable that the greater number of pupils educated in King's College for the three learned professions might proceed from that place to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and that therefore it would not be a matter of surprise of but a few degrees were conferred by the London University upon their pupils\\". Throughout the 19th century, the Calendar of King's College listed \\"University Distinctions\\" gained at Oxford and Cambridge (and later Durham) before those gained at London. By 1845, King's had reached an agreement with the University of Edinburgh whereby medical students could spend three of the four years necessary for the degree of MD at the College, only having to pass one year in residence in Edinburgh. In 1840, King's opened its own hospital on Portugal Street near Lincoln's Inn Fields, an area composed of overcrowded rookeries characterised by poverty and disease. The governance of King's College Hospital was later transferred to the corporation of the hospital established by the King's College Hospital Act 1851, and eventually moved to new premises in Denmark Hill, Camberwell in 1913. The appointment in 1877 of Joseph Lister as professor of clinical surgery greatly benefited the medical school, and the introduction of Lister's antiseptic surgical methods gained the hospital an international reputation. In 1845, the Military Department was established following the identification of a need for more educated officers, the Army being \\"the only profession excluded from collegiate advantages\\". The department was advertised as \\"intended for the benefit of the numerous class of Gentlemen who may be expecting Commissions in the Army, or direct appointments in the Honourable East India Company's service\\". King's established a Theological Department to train Anglican priests in 1846, predating those at Oxford or Cambridge. This recognised degrees from Oxford, Cambridge and Durham, and the AKC, but did not recognise London degrees. The Theological AKC, awarded by the King's Theological Department until 1976, was from 1862 marked by a silk hood lined with mauve silk by special permission of the Archbishop of Canterbury (John Sumner). This was very similar to the Durham MA hood, leading to protests. Following representations to the Archbishop of Canterbury (Edward White Benson) in 1884 by the Durham University Association, the hood was revised to conform with the pattern approved for theological colleges, with the change backdated to 1882. The new hood was poplin, rather than silk, with a 1-inch edging of mauve silk, rather than fully lined. In 1851 F. D. Maurice, professor of theology and of English literature and history at King's, was accused of heterodoxy over his story of Christian Socialism. Jelfs suggested he should resign his professorships, but accepted Maurice's denial of some of the charges. With Lonsdale supporting Maurice, committee of investigation found in his favour. In 1853, Maurice published his Theological Essays, and once again was placed under investigation. This time, with Lonsdale having failed to receive an invitation to attend the meeting, Council agreed with Blomfield's motion that \\"the continuance of Professor Maurice's connection with the College ‚Ä¶ would be seriously detrimental to its usefulness\\". Maurice asked the Council to say which of the 39 articles his teaching contradicted, bit they declined to answer and he was forced to leave immediately, without completing the courses he was then teaching. Lonsdale was very critical of the proceedings, saying there was no authority for the Council's condemnation of Maurice as heretical, and Maurice's treatment was regarded by many as \\"a gross injustice\\". In 1855, King's pioneered evening classes in London. That King's granted students at the evening classes certificates of College attendance to enable them to sit University of London degree exams was cited as an example of the worthlessness of these certificates in the decision by the University of London to end the affiliated colleges system in 1858 and open their examinations to everyone. The controversy over the hoods did not stop the Theological Department becoming affiliated to Durham University in 1876, allowing holders of the Theological AKC to take Durham BAs with only a year of residence in Durham. This and the addition of evening classes to the Theological Department enabled it to recover from only 24 students in 1876 to 79 in 1881, overtaking the General Department, which fell to 39 students in 1884. = Government Funding = In 1874 the fifth report of the Royal Commission on Scientific Instruction and the Advancement of Science found that the pay for teaching staff at King's was inadequate and that the main obstacle to figure success was \\"that it is so extremely poor\\". The commissioners concluded that \\"[King's and UCL] have established a claim to the aid of government that ought to be admitted\\", recommending that both colleges should receive an annual grant to cover their running costs and capital grants to cover buildings and equipment. They also recommended that before King's received such a grant, the College should apply for a new charter or an Act of Parliament to remove the proprietary rights of the shareholders and to remove religious restrictions on professors of science and on privileges granted to students. In 1882 the King's College London Act amended the constitution. The act removed the proprietorial nature of the College, changing the name of the corporation from \\"The Governors and Proprietors of King's College London\\" to \\"King's College London\\" and annulling the 1829 charter (although the College remained incorporated under that charter). The act also changing the College from a (technically) for-profit corporation to a non-profit one (no dividends had ever been paid in over 50 years of operation) and extended the objects of King's to include the education of women. The Ladies' Department of King's College London was opened in Kensington Square in 1885, which later in 1902 became King's College Women's Department.. The 1882 act did not, however, remove the religious restrictions on the staff, as recommended by the Royal Commission. Despite this, in 1889 King's became one of 11 university colleges to be awarded funding through the \\"Grant to University Colleges in Great Britain\\". King's received ¬£1,700, the same as UCL and more than any other institution except Owens College, Manchester. = Reform of the University of London = In 1884, King's allied with UCL and the London medical schools to launch the Association for Promotion of a Teaching University for London. After attempts to reform the University of London failed, the idea was proposed that King's, UCL and the medical schools would join to form a federal university, to be known as the Albert University. A Royal Commission was established in 1888 to look into the matter. This reported in 1889, recommending reform of the University of London, with a minority report favouring the granting of a charter to the Albert University. It was agreed that if reform of the existing University failed, the new University should be established. A complicated scheme for reform of the University was drawn up in 1891 but was rejected by Convocation, leading to a renewal of the petition to form the Albert University. This was approved by the Privy Council later in 1891 and was (in accordance with an 1871 law) laid in the Houses of Parliament for comment, with the name now changed to the Gresham University after Gresham College joined the scheme. In response to opposition to the charter, a second Royal Commission was established in 1892. The new commission recommended another attempt at reform of the University of London rather than establishment of a new body, and that this be carried out by Act of Parliament rather than by Royal Charter. This was accepted by Convocation in 1895 and passed Parliament (at the third attempt) in 1898. The University of London became a federal institute in 1900 under new statutes drawn up under this act, with King's becoming one of the schools of the University.  20th century  See also Contribution of King's College London to the discovery of the structure of DNA and Photo 51 =1900‚Äì1939= In 1902 the College launched an appeal for ¬£500,000. The main aims of the appeal were to pay off the debt, to maintain the quality of labs and equipment, and to secure adequate pay for the professors. The Bishop of London read a message from the king at the launch of the appeal: \\"His Majesty is thoroughly in sympathy with the proposal to raise by subscription a large fund for the endowment of King's College as a constituent of the newly-developed University of London, and wishes the movement for that purpose all success.\\" At the same time, the College Council voted in favour of removing religious restrictions, except within the Theological Department. The King's College London Act 1903 effected the abolition of the religious tests for staff, except within the Theological Department, bringing King's in line with Oxford, Cambridge and Durham, where religious tests had been similarly removed by the Universities Tests Act 1871 (again, with the exception of their theological staff). At this time, King's had 1,385 students, but only 324 were matriculated in the University of London to pursue degrees, the vast majority were either preparing for professional examinations or for entry to Oxford or Cambridge. 1908 saw the relocation of King's College Hospital from its original site on Portugal Street to its current location on Denmark Hill. This led to the separation of pre-clinical studies at the College and clinical studies at the Hospital. On 1 January 1910, the College followed UCL in being merged (with the exception of the Theological Department) into the University of London under the King's College London (Transfer) Act 1908, losing its legal independence. The Theological Department continued under the control of the Council of King's College and, under the same act, became a school of the University. The Women's Department was incorporated as a distinct College from King's, under the name King's College for Women. The merger gave the College a corporate say in the business of the University that the 1900 statutes did not give to the unincorporated schools. This and other defects in the University's governance led to the Haldane Commission of 1909‚Äì1913, but the outbreak of World War I in 1914 meant its recommendations were not implemented. During World War I the Medical school was opened to women for the first time. 415 students from King's College and from Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals were killed in the war. Most of the departments of King's Culture for Women were incorporated back into King's in 1915, with the exception of the Household and Social Science Department. The end of the war saw an influx of students, with numbers more than doubling from 1,775 in 1917‚Äì18 to 3,879 two years layer. This strained the existing facilities to the point where some classes were held in the Principal's house. A government proposal to relocate the premises of King's to Bloomsbury was considered, but finally rejected in 1925.Harte (1986), p. 203 Instead, the Strand campus was extended, including the acquisition of land above Aldwych underground station and the addition of a two-storey building atop the roof of the Main Building. It was suggested at this time that King's take over the east wing of the neighbouring Somerset House, occupied by government offices, but this was refused. In 1928 the King's College for Women Household and Social Science Department became independent of the University of London as the King's College of Household and Social Science. =1939‚Äì1980= Evacuated King's College London students at the University of Bristol during the Second World War During the Second World War most students and staff were evacuated out of London to Bristol and Glasgow. Students from King's College of Household and Social Science were evacuated first to Cardiff and then to Leicester. The buildings of King's College London were used by the Auxiliary Fire Service with a number of King's staff, mainly those then known as college servants, serving as firewatchers under the leadership of Robert Hutton, the College librarian. Parts of the Strand building, the quadrangle, and the roof of apse and stained glass windows of the chapel suffered bomb damage in the Blitz.Heulin (1979), p. 2 During reconstruction, the vaults beneath the quadrangle were replaced by a two-storey laboratory, which opened in 1952, for the departments of Physics and Civil and Electrical Engineering. In 1948 the creation of the National Health Service meant the separation of the Guy's, King's and St Thomas's Medical Schools from their respective hospitals. In 1953 the King's College of Household and Social Science received a Royal Charter under the name of Queen Elizabeth College and admitted men for the first time. In 1956 or was recognised as a school of the University of London. After plans to move into the east wing of Somerset House were again rejected, the Strand Building was commissioned in 1954. Planning permission was granted in 1961 and the building was constructed in 1966‚Äì71. It is described by Historic England as \\"a modest and relatively undistinguished example of its type, relating awkwardly to its historic surroundings and embodying ‚Äì in contrast with other, more ambitious post-war university buildings ‚Äì no particular innovations in functionality or architectural design\\". One of the most famous pieces of scientific research performed at King's were the crucial contributions to the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA in 1953 by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, together with Raymond Gosling, Alex Stokes, Herbert Wilson and other colleagues at the Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics at King's.Maddox (2002), p. 124 Major reconstruction of King's began in 1966 following the publication of the Robbins Report on Higher Education. The Strand Building, designed by E. D. Jefferiss Mathews, was opened in 1972. The Macadam Building was then built over 1972‚Äì75. Planning permission for further new buildings on the Strand campus, linking the Macadam Building to the Strand Building (Phase III) and the Strand Building to Somerset House (Phase IV), was refused following the listing of older buildings on the area and the designation, in 1974, of the Strand Conservation Area. Renewed efforts were made in the 1960s and 70s to acquire the east wing of Somerset House, but these were again unsuccessful. =1980‚Äì1999= In 1980 King's regained its legal independence under a new Royal Charter. In 1993 King's, along with other large University of London colleges, gained direct access to government funding (which had previously been through the University) and the right to confer University of London degrees itself. This contributed to King's and the other large colleges being regarded as de facto universities in their own right. The College and associated institutes underwent several mergers in the late 20th century. In 1983 Guy's Hospital Medical School and St Thomas's Hospital Medical School re- merged (having previously been united until 1825) to form the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals. In the same year the King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry re-merged with King's College. In 1985 Queen Elizabeth College re-merged with King's, along with Chelsea College of Science and Technology. The Institute of Psychiatry joined King's in 1997, and in 1998 the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals merged with King's Medical School to form the GKT Medical School within King's College. Also in 1998, Florence Nightingale's original training school for nurses merged with the King's Department of Nursing Studies as the Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery. The same year King's acquired the former Public Record Office building on Chancery Lane and converted it at a cost of ¬£35 million into the Maughan Library, which opened in 2002. 21st century The Maughan Library. Following a ¬£35m renovation, it is the largest new university library in the United Kingdom since World War IIO'Leary (2010), p. 404 In 2002 the Academic Board recommended to the College Council that King's apply for degree awarding powers, following the proposed merger of UCL and Imperial College. The application was delayed while the UK government reviewed the criteria but when the new criteria were published in 2004 the Board renewed its recommendation. In April 2005, King's formally applied for degree awarding powers. In the same year, the Academic Board recommended that King's begin using its delegated degree awarding powers from the University of London to award research degrees in addition to taught degrees, rather than having research degrees awarded centrally. In July 2006, King's College London was granted degree-awarding powers in its own right, as opposed to through the University of London, by the Privy Council. This power remained unexercised until 2007, when King's announced that all students starting courses from September 2007 onwards would be awarded degrees conferred by King's itself, rather than by the University of London. The new certificates however still make reference to the fact that King's is a constituent college of the University of London. All current students with at least one year of study remaining were in August 2007 offered the option of choosing to be awarded a University of London degree or a King's degree. The first King's degrees were awarded in summer 2008. In 2007, for the second consecutive year, students from the School of Law won the national round of the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition. The Jessup moot is the largest international mooting competition in the world. The King's team went on to represent the UK as national champions. In 2009, King's finally gained one of its objectives since 1831 ‚Äì it acquired the east wing of Somerset House. King's secured a 78-year lease for the building and launched a ¬£20M fundraising drive to pay (along with a ¬£7.5M grant from HEFCE) for its restoration. The refurbished East Wing was officially reopened by the Queen in 2012. In 2010 King's announced that 205 jobs were put at risk in response to government funding cuts. Among the proposed cuts was the UK's only chair of palaeography, two leading computational linguists, and the department of Engineering, believed to be the oldest in the UK (established in 1838), sparking an international campaign from academics. In November 2010, King's launched a fundraising campaign to raise ¬£500 million by 2015 for research into five areas: cancer, global power, neuroscience and mental health, leadership and society and children's health. Over ¬£400 million has been raised as of March 2013. In 2011 the Chemistry department was reopened following its closure in 2003. In April 2011 King's became a founding partner in the UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation, subsequently renamed the Francis Crick Institute, committing ¬£40 million to the project. In June 2014, King's announced plans for large-scale redundancies, potentially affecting up to 15% of staff in biomedical sciences and at the Institute of Psychiatry. Commentators noted that many senior academics as well as students were highly critical of the plans, on the grounds that they were being rushed through without adequate consultation, threatened to leave students without adequate teaching staff, and would weaken the research capacity and damage the reputation of the university. A spokesperson for King's argued that the numbers of planned redundancies were fewer than critics claimed, but in so doing came in for further criticism, because staff had not been told of this information. It was subsequently noted that the redundancy plan also went against explicit advice in a commissioned report on the university's finances. Around the same time as these developments, an article in the Times Higher Education noted that, in an apparently unrelated development, King's was contesting a freedom of information request for details of salaries of its top professors. In October 2014, Ed Byrne replaced Rick Trainor as Principal of King's College London, the latter having served for 10 years. In December 2014, King's announced its plans to rebrand its name to 'King's London'. It was emphasised that there were no plans to change the legal name of King's, and that the name 'King's London' was designed to promote King's and to highlight the fact that King's is a university in its own right. King's announced that the rebranding plans had been dropped in January 2015. On 10 March 2015, King's acquired a 50-year lease for the Aldwych Quarter which includes the historic grand Bush House building. King's will occupy Bush House and Strand House on a phased basis from September 2016, and adjacent buildings King House and Melbourne House from 2025. Once King's takes full occupation of the four main buildings, the Aldwych Quarter will provide approximately 300,000 square feet of additional space for student study and social space, new teaching facilities and academic accommodation Historical Estate The estate of King's College London, particularly the Strand Campus, includes a number of historic buildings, many listed at various grades. These include the main King's Building, constructed in 1828 to complete the riverside frontage of Somerset House, and the current east wing of Somerset House (both Grade I listed), the Maughan Library (Grade II* listed), 152 and 153 Strand (Grade II listed), and Bush House (Grade II listed). The Strand Campus mostly falls within the Strand Conservation Area, with the Strand Building and Macadam Building having been granted certificates of immunity. The Maughan Library falls within the Chancery Lane Conservation Area.

It is used in particular to describe isotopic enrichment or depletion as material moves between reservoirs in an equilibrium process. Rayleigh fractionation holds particular importance in hydrology and meteorology as a model for the isotopic differentiation of meteoric water due to condensation.  The Rayleigh equation  The original Rayleigh equation was derived by Lord Rayleigh for the case of fractional distillation of mixed liquids. This is an exponential relation that describes the partitioning of isotopes between two reservoirs as one reservoir decreases in size. The equations can be used to describe an isotope fractionation process if: (1) material is continuously removed from a mixed system containing molecules of two or more isotopic species (e.g., water with 18O and 16O, or sulfate with 34S and 32S), (2) the fractionation accompanying the removal process at any instance is described by the fractionation factor a, and (3) a does not change during the process. Under these conditions, the evolution of the isotopic composition in the residual (reactant) material is described by: \\\\frac{R}{R^0} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{X}{X^0} \\\\right)^{a-1} where R = ratio of the isotopes (e.g., 18O/16O) in the reactant, R0 = initial ratio, X = the concentration or amount of the more abundant (lighter) isotope (e.g.,16O), and X0 = initial concentration. Because the concentration of X >> Xh (heavier isotope concentration), X is approximately equal to the amount of original material in the phase. Hence, if f = X/X^0 = fraction of material remaining, then: R = R^0 f^{a-1} For large changes in concentration, such as they occur during e.g. distillation of heavy water, these formulae need to be integrated over the distillation trajectory. For small changes such as occur during transport of water vapour through the atmosphere, the differentiated equation will usually be sufficient.

Her work focuses on the female slave experience by emphasizing narratives of black women during slavery.  Early life  Jessica Millward was born in American Fork, Utah. She was raised in West Valley City, near Salt Lake City, in a Mormon household. As a child, Millward's hobbies included water skiing, cheerleading, and dancing. Millward attended school from elementary through high school in West Valley City, Utah, and spoke during her graduation ceremony.  Education  At the University of Utah, Millward majored in history and minored in African American studies to earn her bachelor's degree. After completing her bachelor's degree, a four-year scholarship was awarded to Millward to teach in secondary school in Utah. However, Millward decided to attend the University of California, Los Angeles, where she received her master's degree in African American studies and where she earned her doctorate. Millward was the first person on either side of her family to attend college and earn her Ph.D. Maya Angelou's book, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, first sparked Millward's interest in studying African American history. Once in her master's program, Brenda Stevenson became an advisor to Millward. Stevenson's research intrigued Millward and encouraged her to study the slave experience. Newly learned knowledge from personal accounts and interacting with Stevenson's research became the foundation to Millward's book, Finding Charity's Folk.  Career  Millward is an assistant professor in the history department in the School of Humanities at the University of California, Irvine.

He is remembered, in particular, as the organiser of K√∂penick's week of bloodshed which took place in June 1933 and subsequently came to be seen as an early harbinger of the Shoah, He was implicated in the killing of Johannes Stelling. Life Herbert Ottokar Gehrke was born in Lichtenberg, a suburb of Berlin on the city's eastern side. His father was a telegraph worker who later became a local councillor at K√∂penick, a short distance to the south. The boy attended junior school locally and a single-sex middle school at Neuk√∂lln nearby. He moved on to the Friedrich-Werdersche Senior School, but had to leave after a year in order to embark on an apprenticeship as a brick-layer. He managed to pass his School final exams (Abitur) three years later. At the same time he successfully qualified as a brick-layer while working on the construction of a police accommodation block in K√∂penick. Over the next few years he worked as a freelance brick-layer, but his employment was punctuated by periods of unemployment and he also took other forms of building work, worked for the postal service and undertook factory work. Gehrke joined the Hitler Youth organisation in 1927, and in July 1928 he joined the Nazi Party. He performed various political leadership roles within the party locally, also serving at one stage as treasurer and as deputy section leader for K√∂penick. At the start of 1929 he also joined the Sturmabteilung (SA) which operated as the Nazi Party's quasi-military wing. He was assigned to the SA's \\"Troop 37\\". In October 1930 he was promoted to the rank of \\" Scharf√ºhrer\\" (\\"squadron leader\\"), and early in 1931 he was promoted again, becoming leader of the SA Troop in K√∂penick. During this period he developed a close personal bond with Wilhelm Sander, at this time a leader within the SA (though Sander would be purged and murdered in 1934). Early in 1931 the so-called Stennes Revolt represented a violent split within the Sturmabteilung (SA). Sander secured control over the local SA head office (\\"Gauhaus\\") with his SA people, and Gehrke was given leadership of SA \\"Storm Troop 37\\". In December 1931 this Storm Troop was uprated, becoming the \\"Standard 55\\" troop. Gehrke retained leadership of it. Rapid increases in membership accompanied the Nazi rise to power and the party's successful power grab at the start of 1933, and this triggered a succession of organisational changes to the structure and hierarchy of the SA. Early in 1933 Gehrke's group was upgraded again, becoming an autonomous SA unit (\\"Sturmbann\\"), finally promoted again on 6 August 1933 to \\"Standard 15\\" troop. By this time Gehrke and his unit had acquired notoriety for their savage rounding up of left-wing extremists. An exercise later known as K√∂penick's week of bloodshed (die \\"K√∂penicker Blutwoche\\") had taken place in June 1933, and involved known political opponents of the Nazi government. Raids on people's homes had included not merely searches for weapons, but also approximately 500 arrests. Some of the detainees were tortured and at least 23 died. It was only much later, after the fall of the Nazi regime, that the events of that week could be presented to a court of law, at which point it was confirmed that the killings had constituted murders. Victims included the Social Democratic former minister president of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Johannes Stelling and Anton Schmau who died later from gunshot wounds. The shots were thought to have been fired by Gehrke himself. Directly after the events, however, in July 1933 Gehrke was promoted to the rank of \\"SA-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer\\" (\\"Senior SA unit leader\\") in recognition of his contribution to implementing the [Nazi] national revolution\\" (\\"in Anerkennung seiner Verdienste um die Durchf√ºhrung der nationalen Revolution\\"). On February 1934 another promotion followed for Gehrke, this time to the rank of SA \\"Standartenf√ºhrer\\". This piut him in charge of around 3,000 SA men in the K√∂penick district. He continued to lead the \\"Standard 15\\" troop toll 30 April 1935 after which, on 1 May 1935, he became an SA leader, allocated the SA Brigades 28 and 29. He retained these responsibilities till 31 July 1939. Outside the Nazi paramilitary world, in 1933 Herbert Gehrke became deputy chairman of at the K√∂penick office of the local health insurance (\\"Ortskrankenkasse\\") provider. After 1941 Gehrke took part in World War II as a soldier. By 1945 he had reached the rank of Oberleutnant. Shortly before the war ended he was killed in battle. He is buried in a military cemetery in Sandweiler in the south-eastern part of Luxembourg. Justice in East Berlin The end of the war in May 1945 was accompanied by the collapse of the Nazi regime. A large part of what remained of Germany, including East Berlin, now fell under Soviet administration: official interest in the \\"K√∂penicker Blutwoche\\" resurfaced. Between 19 and 21 June 1947 four SA men found themselves charged with crimes against humanity in connection with the events in K√∂penick fourteen years earlier. Two of these were found guilty and sentenced to terms of respectively eight years and eighteen months: the third was acquitted and the fourth managed to escape before the trial. Two more were tried, convicted and sentenced to short prison terms in August 1948. It was not until after the Soviet occupation zone had given way to the German Democratic Republic that a larger number of those allegedly complicit in the massacre faced trial. Between 5 June and 19 July 1950, a trial of 61 formally identified defendants took place in the Fourth Criminal Chamber at the District Court in East Berlin. Only 32 Sources differ over some of the precise numbers, however. of the 61 indicted were actually present, and the remaining 29 were tried in absentia. 47 of the 61 were identified as SA men, 3 were identified as Nazi Party members and one as an SS man. For the remaining ten, no equivalent affiliation was recorded. Of those tried in absentia, the whereabouts of 13 was unknown, while another ten were in West Germany, which since 1949 had been separated from East Germany politically and, increasingly, physically. Three others of the accused managed to escape before the trial and one was known to have died young. Those who had escaped to West Germany never faced trial. Most or all of those tried were found guilty. 15 were sentenced to death and a further 13 received life sentences. 25 received prison sentences of between ten and twenty-five years and four others were sentenced to five years each of forced labour.A typed version of the 328 page judgement was published in East Berlin under the title \\"Landgericht Berlin.

Located on Vermont Route 7A at West Mountain and Tunic Roads, near the town's geographic center, it was the town's main civic center through the middle of the 19th century. It is now a modest village with agricultural and tourist-oriented economic interests. Most of the village is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Center Shaftsbury Historic District. Geography Shaftsbury Center is located near the geographic center of the town of Shaftsbury, stretched out for about along Vermont Route 7A on either side of its junctions with West Mountain and Tunic Roads. The road runs on the eastern flank of the Taconic Range, and offers fine views across the valley to the Green Mountains further east. History The town of Shaftsbury was chartered in 1761 by Benning Wentworth, the colonial governor of New Hampshire, who laid claim (along with the neighboring Province of New York) to the area that is now Vermont. The dispute over the status of Vermont (then sometimes called the New Hampshire Grants) would ultimately lead to its independence in 1777, and its eventual statehood as the 14th state. Part of the history of those events was played out in Shaftsbury Center, where the inn of Jonas Galusha, an eventual Governor of Vermont, was a meeting point for both those events, and the participation of Vermont men in the American Revolutionary War. Shaftsbury also sheltered rebels involved Shays' Rebellion (1786‚Äì87) in Massachusetts. As the town's civic center, it housed its first church and town meetinghouse. It developed as a predominantly agrarian community in the 19th century, but was bypassed by the railroad when it was laid through the town in 1850. This resulted a shift of economic and civic activity to South Shaftsbury, where a new town hall was built in 1880. Shaftsbury Center declined economically until the early 20th century, when the advent of automobile-propelled tourism brought new economic activity. Most of the village's buildings were built before 1880, and its oldest house, the 1764-5 Abiathar Waldo House, was built by one of its first settlers. Most of the village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district in 1988.

McDowell, University of Chicago Settlement, Stock-Yards District, 1900‚Äì1916 Mary Eliza McDowell (November 30, 1854 ‚Äì October 14, 1936) was an American social reformer and prominent figure in the Chicago Settlement movement.  Early life  Mary Eliza McDowell was born on November 30, 1854 to Malcolm and Jane Welch Gordon McDowell in Cincinnati, Ohio as the oldest of six children. Her father was recognized for his distinguished service in the Civil War and support for the presidency helped to establish her political conviction. After the war, the family left for Chicago where her father opened and managed a steel rolling mill and the family joined the Methodist Church. The changes led her mother to become an invalid, no longer able to care for the family, and McDowell became responsible for her five brothers. In the family's first few years in Chicago, McDowell was involved in various relief efforts and religious involvement. During the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, McDowell and her father worked to help refugees by transporting people and their belongings to the makeshift camp away from the fire. When aid was received from Ohio, McDowell took the lead in the relief effort and was later recognized by President Rutherford B. Hayes for her service. She later organized religious classes for young people that attracted prominent figures in the temperance movement, students from Northwestern University, and residents of Chicago.  Career  McDowell first began work for Frances Williard, founder of the Women's Christian Temperance Movement, where she met Elizabeth Harrison. With Harrison's support, McDowell started teaching kindergarten classes at the Hull House and helped to organize the women's club under Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Star. In 1893, The University of Chicago was in its second year of existence and wanted to start an initiative to become involved in the city and looked to the Settlement movement to do so. Working with the university's Christian Union, Jane Addams, and Professor J. Laurence Laughlin, the university established the University of Chicago Settlement House in the Stock Yard District on January 1, 1894 at 4688 South Gross Avenue. Under Addams' recommendation, the university hired McDowell to head a larger Back of the Yards settlement house. The settlement house plan was composed of a colony of houses throughout the ethnically diverse immigrant neighborhood, instead of from the norm of a single house within the community, in order to wield more influence. In 1894, McDowell opened the University of Chicago Settlement House to alleviate the crowded, unsanitary housing immigrant and African American families often faced. There, she organized classes, provided kindergarten education and accesses to vocational schools, bathing facilities, concerts, lectures. She formed clubs for both men and women, including the Bohemian Women's Club and the Settlement Women's Club. She began to feel that the low wages these families received directly correlated to the low standard of living and welcomed the burgeoning union organizing started in 1901 by labor organizer Michael Donnelley. In 1902, a small group of 20 women became Local 183 of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America. Standing with workers during the stockyard strike of 1904, she counseled on peaceful protests and urged unions to admit African Americans feeling that newer groups were used to break strikes and if different eccentricities were incorporated, the union would become stronger. For her work during the strike, she gained the name \\"Fighting Mary.\\" In 1896, the Settlement houses in the U.S. held their first conference to showcase to public officials and institutions the knowledge gained by these communities. McDowell presented a paper on the need to recognize the humanity of charity work and to work directly with individuals in need. In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt passed along a letter from McDowell to the Agriculture Committee of the House of Representatives, recommending her knowledge of the poor conditions of the Chicago Stock Yards. McDowell worked with residents to improve their neighborhood as well through education of politic rights and civic consciousness. The garbage dump nearby invited rodents and spread disease and the stagnant water of Bubbly Creek greatly needed cleanup in the neighborhood. She worked with the suffrage movement to put pressure on city officials to clean up the issues. In 1913, Chicago established the Chicago Commission on Waste where McDowell served researching garbage collection methods. Her recommendations were a combination of incineration and reduction plants. Fearing public backlash after the publication of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, the city allocated funds for garbage disposal facilities. Civic consciousness projects brought her into close proximity with local politicians and in 1923, became the Commissioner of Public Welfare under Mayor William Emmett Dever. In this role, she created a bureau of employment and social surveys. During World War I, McDowell joined the Council of National Defense, becoming the chairman on the committee on foreign-born women and a member of the executive committee of women in industry. McDowell helped to found the Women's Trade Union League of Chicago and lobbied the U.S. government to establish the Women's Bureau to study living and working conditions of women and children in 1920. She died on October 14, 1936 in Chicago, suffering from a paralytic stroke.

Oishei (18 January 1886 ‚Äì 27 January 1968) was a successful businessman who founded Trico products and became one of Buffalo‚Äôs wealthiest citizens and philanthropists. Early life John R. Oishei was born in Buffalo in 1886 to Charles Humbert Oishei and Julia (Roffo) Oishei. Oishei's grandfather, Giuseppe \\"Joseph\\" Oishei, immigrated to the United States from Lombardy, Italy in 1859. By 1868, Joseph owned a saloon on Buffalo's Prime Street and by 1861, owned another saloon and restaurant on Ohio Street in Buffalo. Joseph married Adelheide Von Wildt and had three children: Charles (John's father), Aurelia and Amelia. At the time of Joseph's death in 1878, he owned the Golden Gate Hotel at 160 Exchange Street in Buffalo. Charles, aged 19, took over responsibility for the family for his deceased father and by 1890, graduated from Buffalo Law School and set up a law practice. Oishei was one of eight children to Charles and Julia: John R. Oishei, Stella Oishei, Camilla Oishei, Bertha Oishei, Charles Oishei Jr., Bernard Oishei, Florence Oishei, and William Oishei. Julia died, aged 40, in 1904, and Charles remarried to Leonora Oishei and had three more children: Muriel Oishei, Harriet Oishei, and Willis Oishei. Career In 1916, Oishei was driving down Delaware Avenue near Virginia Street in downtown Buffalo during a rainstorm. A bicyclist ran into the National Roadster he was driving at the time. Oishei never saw him coming, and even though the cyclist was not seriously injured, Oishei vowed to never let that happen again. He sought out the best technology available at the time to create the first automobile wiper blades and grew the idea from a simple fix to worldwide use. In 1917, John R. Oishei founded Trico Products Corporation He looked around for a way to clear moisture from a driver's line of vision, and decided to invest in the national marketing of an edged, hand-pulled rubber squeegee that was produced in Buffalo by an engineer named John Jepson. Within three years, Oishei's sales team had successfully sold the accessory to Packard, Lincoln, Cadillac and Buffalo's own Pierce- Arrow. =Buyout of Jepson= Through those sales, Oishei raised enough capital to buy out Jepson in 1919 and when World War I ended, he expanded availability of the product to Europe and beyond. Although maintaining cash flow to service early loans made Trico's initial survival a dicey proposition, its success was assured following the immediate post-World War I automotive boom. Early on, most Trico sales were the easily refitted squeegee that fit in the slot of two-piece windshields. For one-piece glass, Trico offered a spring-loaded arcing wiper that was operated by hand and pivoted across the field of vision. Although Trico did not invent the wiper motor, it did come up with a reliable unit run by an engine's manifold vacuum that quickly became the industry standard, especially in the aftermarket. Cadillac was the first to make these powered wipers standard. In 1934, that refillable wiper was redesigned to fit the new curved windshields, complete with internal springs to ensure constant pressure across the glass. Two years later, Trico introduced a powered windshield washer. In 1937, its wipers were standard across the entire U.S. auto industry. Trico eventually became one of the world's leading manufacturers of automotive windshield wiping equipment. Personal life Oishei married Estelle Low on April 21, 1908. Together, they had: *R. John Oishei (born 1910) *Julian Oishei (born 1910) *Patricia Oishei (born 1916) Estelle died of a heart attack on August 11, 1938. He was a member of the Country Club of Buffalo, the Saturn Club, president of the Buffalo Club (elected in 1948) where he participated in an elite group within the Club designated the \\"Society of the Buffalo.\\" At his death in Buffalo in 1968, Oishei had $44 million () in stocks and bonds and approximately $1 million () in insurance policies. The John R. Oishei Foundation In 1940, Oishei established the Foundation, formerly known as the \\"Julia R. and Estelle L. Foundation.\\" He funded it with annual contributions and with charitable remainder trusts. Oishei served as President of the Foundation from its founding until his death in 1968. The Foundation concentrated its support to hospitals and schools in the Buffalo area with the balance being directed to cultural and social services needs. Until 1997, all Foundation contributions were made on an anonymous basis. This was consistent with the procedures Oishei followed with regard to the substantial charitable gifts he personally made during his lifetime. His penchant for total anonymity was driven by his strong sense of modesty and of equally strong belief that anonymity allowed him to make his philanthropic decisions with greater objectivity. As of December 2015, the Foundation has $300 million in assets and gives away nearly $20 million annually. It is among the region‚Äôs most well-known grantmakers, providing resources for programs, capital projects and nonprofit executive development and in the last few years alone, it provided multimillion-dollar gifts to the largest health and education projects in Western New York.

It was made in 1947‚Äì48, and exhibited at London County Council's first Open-Air Sculpture Exhibition at Battersea Park in 1948. Donated to the council, it has been exhibited at the park since 1950. It became a Grade II listed building in 1988. Description The high stone statue comprises three standing women, draped in flowing garments: two standing closer together, observed by the third. Each has rudimentary facial features, such as eye holes. Moore's draped figures developed from a series of drawings inspired by his observations of people in underground bomb shelters during the Second World War. Somewhat reminiscent of the Three Graces, it may also draw from a drawing of the Three Fates made by Moore in 1948. In 1968, Moore commented that \\"it is as though the three women are standing there, expecting something to happen from the sky\\" Sylvester published an essay in The Burlington Magazine in 1948 with an unusual interpretation, as a family group: the protective mother, the stern father, and the child on the far right. History Moore began with a terracotta model made c.1945; its present location is unknown, but there are two known plaster copies, one at the Henry Moore Foundation and one on long-term loan to the Tate Gallery. Moore also cast a bronze edition of four (plus one artist's copy) between 1948 and 1949; an additional artist's cast was made in 1985. Examples of these sculptures are held in the Smith College Museum of Art in Massachusetts and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice. The work in Battersea Park was carved between August 1947 and May 1948 from Darley Dale sandstone, one of the last statues that Moore made from English stone. It was originally conceived to fulfil a commission from the Museum of Modern Art in New York, but it was instead exhibited at London County Council's first Open-Air Sculpture Exhibition at Battersea Park in 1948. (MOMA took instead a cast of Moore's first large bronze, Family Group from The Barclay School in Stevenage, itself originally intended for Walter Gropius's Impington Village College.) Moore was a member of the selection committee for the Open-Air Exhibition, and his sculpture was used on the publicity poster. It was sited in a prominent position, at the top of a slight rise in ground, with trees behind. Moore's reputation grew dramatically from 1948, when he was a selected as Britain's greatest living artist for the 24th Venice Biennale and won the sculpture prize. The stone sculpture was lent for the Open-Air Exhibition in 1948, and then bought by the Contemporary Art Society and donated to London County Council. It has been permanently sited in Battersea Park in Battersea, London, in 1950, but has been moved from its original site. The sculpture featured in the 1991 Mr. Bean episode Mr. Bean Goes to Town; Bean tries to take a selfie with a polaroid camera, with the sculpture in the background. Being unsuccessful, he asks a passerby to take his photo, but the man runs off with Bean‚Äôs camera.

As part of the UK Government's Robotics and Autonomous Systems Strategy (RAS) this is one of the initiatives that is supporting development and growth in remote handling. RACE uses the broad range of expertise from UKAEA and CCFE's past experience in remote handling used on JET (Joint European Torus). RACE defines a ‚Äòchallenging environment‚Äô as one in which conditions make it impossible or unacceptable for people to conduct useful work. The physical challenges to overcome might include high radiation, extreme temperatures, limited access, operation in vacuum and magnetic fields. Combinations of such conditions are routinely found in sectors including nuclear, space, petrochemical, construction and mining. RACE is partnering with industry and academia to use other skills in robotics and remote handling to develop solutions that work reliably, safely and cost effectively in the most extreme environments imaginable. RACE‚Äôs long-term goal is to design and operate plant and machinery for long periods with zero manual intervention. History Created in 2014, RACE is the new branded name for the UKAEA remote handling unit. This unit has been around since the 1990s supporting the Joint European Torus nuclear fusion experiment. Now RACE uses all the gained knowledge in Remote Handling (also known as Telerobotics), from more than 30,000 hours of unique and diverse operations in the vessel of JET. Remote operations in-vessel at JET have included, cutting, welding, bolting and handling of approximately 7000 components in the change of all the tiles in JET to the ITER-like wall. Directors *2014‚Äìpresent: Dr Rob Buckingham Current activities = Typical RACE activities = * Use extensive design, application and operations expertise to develop solutions that work reliably, safely and cost effectively. * Develop complete operational management systems that allow critical, delicate and complex components to be maintained and replaced, reliably and remotely. * Collaborate with academia to create an innovation pipeline for new ideas. * Partner with industry, offering technical consultancy, mechanical design, control systems and operations expertise. =Supporting the Remote Handling of JET= JET is the world's largest operation experimental tokamak nuclear fusion reactor. Bombardment by high- energy neutrons produced in the nuclear fusion reactions are able to activate some components and support structures, rendering them radioactive for long periods of time. This was most severe after the first DT (Deuterium/Tritium) experiments on JET in 1997. Furthermore, many plasma facing tiles are covered in beryllium, which, if breathed in as dust, poses a further hazard to anyone working inside the reactor. Therefore, JET has always placed great emphasis on its Remote Handling, to ensure a maximum of tasks can be carried out fully remotely. Two 12m long snake-like booms reach into the vacuum vessel delivering cameras and tools to enable operators to work remotely. The primary tool is MASCOT, a haptic master-slave manipulator, that allows the operator to feel every action from carrying a new component to tightening a bolt. Nine lengthy shutdowns have been completed that have relied on this system and the operators have become highly skilled at the most dexterous of tasks. The JET machine is a complex device where the detailed configuration changes as the physics experimental requirements dictate. The Remote Handling system is required to fulfil two functions: *Repair of any system failure stops the experiment *Modification of torus components for new experiments Experience shows that Remote Handling interventions achieve higher precision and introduce less impurities than sending people inside the torus as they did in the past. JET is a seriously challenging environment for robotics: high radiation dose, elevated temperatures, limited access, large complex equipment and some very challenging critical path inspection and maintenance procedures that must be completed reliably and without failure. MASCOT Telemanipulator in JET (Joint European Torus) vessel = Development for ITER = RACE will be developing robotics solutions for the ITER international fusion experiment in Cadarache, France. Remote operations and maintenance will be critical for the effective and efficient operation of the ITER machine in the full nuclear phase. Some areas that require inspection or maintenance will not be manually accessible due to radiation and lack of space and will require deployment of bespoke remote maintenance systems. RACE is supporting industry in the development of a number of critical remote handling systems including the Divertor Remote Handling System (RHS), Neutral Beam RHS and Cask & Plug RHS. =Developing the Remote Handling strategies for DEMO= DEMO is the conceptual demonstration fusion power plant using all of the knowledge gained in nuclear fusion to create a commercial power plant. After ITER, DEMO will supply fusion electricity to the grid and will demonstrate fusion‚Äôs feasibility as a power source. RACE plays a leading role in developing DEMO‚Äôs Remote Handling concepts. It is recognised that remote maintenance will be device defining and mission critical for future fusion power plants. A fusion reactor must be designed to be maintained remotely by bespoke remotely operated tools. Furthermore, during operations any failure of these tools will affect plant availability and hence impact commercial viability. RACE has refurbished a large manipulator, called the Telescopic Articulated Remote Manipulator (TARM), to use as a research test bed for heavy payload manipulation with a flexible, hyper redundant mechanism. This research will establish whether the concepts have potential to be developed into validated engineering designs that can be delivered within cost and reliability parameters required to deliver commercially viable base load electricity from fusion. = European Spallation Source Active Cell Facility = RACE in partnership with the Science & Technology Facilities Council is facilitating a major contract to design, manufacture and install remotely operated equipment in the Active Cell Facility of the European Spallation Source (ESS) which is under construction in Lund, Sweden. The Active Cell Facility will receive activated components from the ESS target station which contains a rotating tungsten target wheel. The target wheel will need to be exchanged every few years. It needs to be processed and packaged before being shipped to a long- term waste store. Due to the size of the target wheel the Active Cell Facility is a 12m by 12m by 12m reinforced concrete cell. Operations within a closed box of this size cannot be conducted using through-wall manipulators so the design relies on remotely operated equipment delivered by two remotely operated cranes. The cell has no windows, so operators sat in adjacent rooms will use multiple cameras to control the various handling and size reduction processes. Equipment in the cell will consist of cutting equipment for size reduction, power manipulators (aka robots), cranes, shielding and transit cases. Tasks to be conducted include processing, repair, refurbishment, testing and disposal of large activated components. = System of systems control = A common thread in all of RACE‚Äôs activities is ‚Äòsystem of systems‚Äô control. JET, ITER, DEMO and ESS are examples of complex systems reliant on efficient, collaborative operation of multiple robotic devices. As the complexity of robotics and autonomous systems grows, systems will need to be adapted and combined in different ways to achieve unique functionalities. Furthermore, the ability to plan to cope with regular software and hardware updates and equipment obsolescence is required. RACE has developed integrated digital tools including virtual reality, augmented reality, haptics, operations management and condition monitoring for simulation and real hardware control. At the heart of this digital toolkit is a ‚Äòsystem of systems‚Äô network protocol. This software has been designed to enable ‚Äòself- describing‚Äô hardware to offer and request data from other members. This addresses the perennial problem of obsolescence and rapidly changing networks and it also enables software tools, including user interfaces, to access and control the full range of hardware devices and sensors. The prototype software has been used to control bespoke and commercial off-the shelf equipment from multiple vendors. It enables the use of all modern technologies regardless of the vendor or the platform type. = Hosting autonomous vehicle testing = Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) are expected to provide huge social, industrial and economic benefits to the world. These innovative vehicles offer the potential to expand our industrial base, increase productivity, improve safety, decrease congestion and free up space usually devoted to vehicles in urban areas. Autonomous vehicles may also change where people live and work and will affect the design of transport systems, our homes, towns and cities. With such a far-reaching new technology it is essential to establish comprehensive test facilities that allow interested stakeholders to explore the technical, commercial, ethical, legal and social issues. RACE has access to 10 kilometres of roads, junctions, roundabouts traffic lights and pedestrian crossings within the secure Culham site. In partnership with Millbrook (part of Spectris Plc) RACE has won funding from the Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles to host part of the UK‚Äôs CAV Testbed. Four locations will be promoted globally by Meridian and used to explore all issues regarding the deployment of autonomous vehicles including mobility as a service. RACE is also part of the DRIVEN consortium which is developing a fleet of six vehicles which will drive autonomously (with an onboard safety driver) from Oxford to London in 2019. Oxbotica, the autonomous vehicle spin out from Oxford University, has been using the roads around RACE for more than 12 months and has accumulated more than 5000 km of Level 4 autonomous vehicle driving. Additional investment has been secured to develop a ‚ÄòCAV Pit Lane‚Äô for use by developers. RACE will become a hub for autonomous vehicle testing working with vehicle manufacturers, software companies, insurers, regulators, councils, service providers and the public. = RACE TEST - Testing, Evaluating, Standardising and Training = The comprehensive suite of standard test methods enables independent evaluation of robotic capabilities with quantifiable results. Standards have been developed to measure remote systems‚Äô mobility, sensors, energy consumption, communications, dexterity, durability, reliability, logistics, safety, autonomy, and operator proficiency. These methods will help robotics developers evaluate performance against user needs, help guide purchasing and deployment decisions, and provide focused training for operators. This facility is unique in the UK providing robotic developers with an internationally recognised benchmarking system. RACE TEST is a neutral test facility that is independent from manufacturers, enabling an open comparison of system performance.

Proteins of the KUP/HAK/KT family include the KUP (TrkD) protein of E. coli and homologues in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. High affinity (20 ŒºM) K+ uptake systems (Hak1, TC# 2.A.72.2.1) of the yeast Debaryomyces occidentalis as well as the fungus, Neurospora crassa, and several homologues in plants have been characterized. Arabidopsis thaliana and other plants possess multiple KUP family paralogues. While many plant proteins cluster tightly together, the Hak1 proteins from yeast as well as the two Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial proteins are distantly related on the phylogenetic tree for the KUP family. All currently classified members of the KUP family can be found in the Transporter Classification Database. Structure and function = Escherichia coli = The E. coli protein is 622 amino acyl residues long and has 12 established transmembrane spanners (440 residues) with a requisite hydrophilic, C-terminal domain of 182 residues, localized to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Deletion of most of the hydrophilic domain reduces but does not abolish KUP transport activity. The function of the C-terminal domain is not known. The E. coli KUP protein is believed to be a secondary transporter. Uptake is blocked by protonophores such as CCCP (but not arsenate), and evidence for a proton symport mechanism has been presented. The N. crassa protein was earlier shown to be a K+:H+ symporter, establishing that the KUP family consists of secondary carriers. = Yeast = The yeast high affinity (KM = 1 ŒºM) K+ transporter Hak1 is 762 amino acyl residues long with 12 putative TMSs. Like the E. coli KUP protein, it possesses a C-terminal hydrophilic domain, probably localized to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Hak1 may be able to accumulate K+ 106-fold against a concentration gradient. The plant high and low affinity K+ transporters can complement K+ uptake defects in E. coli. = TRK = TRK transporters, responsible for the bulk of K+ accumulation in plants, fungi, and bacteria, mediate ion currents driven by the large membrane voltages (-150 to -250 mV) common to non-animal cells. Bacterial TRK proteins resemble K+ channels in their primary sequence, crystallize as membrane dimers having intramolecular K+-channel-like folding, and complex with a cytoplasmic collar formed of four RCK domains. Fungal TRK proteins possess a large built- in regulatory domain and a highly conserved pair of transmembrane helices (TMSs 7 and 8, ahead of the C-terminus), postulated to facilitate intramembranal oligomerization.These fungal HAK proteins are chloride channels mediating efflux, a process suppressed by osmoprotective agents. It involve hydrophobic gating and resembles conduction by Cys-loop ligand-gated anion channels. Possibly, the tendency of hydrophobic or amphipathic transmembrane helices to self-organize into oligomers creates novel ionic pathways through membranes: hydrophobic nanopores, pathways of low selectivity governed by the chaotropic behavior of individual ionic species under the influence of membrane voltage. Transport reaction The generalized transport reaction for members of the KUP family is: :K+ (out) + energy ‚Üí K+ (in).

It began operations in December 2002. It belongs to the Fundaci√≥n Montemadrid (the formal title of which is Fundaci√≥n Obra Social y Monte de Piedad de Madrid), a social responsibility entity set up by the Spanish bank Caja Madrid. Among its activities are avant-garde art exhibitions, and running courses and workshops on social matters, culture and the environment. The cultural programme includes performance art, film, exhibitions and other forms of contemporary creativity. It developed as a place which particularly supports young artists. The name La Casa Encendida ('The Burning House' in English) is taken from the eponymous book of the poet Luis Rosales Camacho, whose heirs gave their permission for its use. History and construction of the building It was designed by the architect Fernando Arb√≥s y Tremanti and the first stone was laid on 1 May 1911. In its early years the building was used as the office of the bank Caja de Ahorros y Monte de Piedad de Madrid (the formal name of Caja Madrid). It was known as El Monte ('The Mount') and also as La Casa de Empe√±os ('The Pawnshop') because the Monte de Piedad ('Mount of Piety') in Spain had been an institutional pawnbroker run as a charity (i.e. no interest was charged on its loans) until its merger with Caja de Ahorros de Madrid ('Savings Bank of Madrid') in 1869. The building is organized around a central courtyard. Its symmetrical facade is aesthetically novel when compared with other banking buildings of the period. The facade blends brick and granite using a mixture of Italianate and Neo-Mud√©jar styles.

The venture was started by York Potash Ltd, which became a subsidiary of Sirius Minerals plc whose primary focus is the development of the polyhalite project. The project will mine the world's largest deposit of polyhalite ‚Äì a naturally occurring mineral. Because the project would require mining to be undertaken in the North York Moors National Park, many objections were raised to the mine and the proposed conveyor that would be installed to transport the raw material offsite to a plant on Teesside away. The mine is expected to have a life of 100 years and has been labelled the biggest mining project in Britain for decades; its twin shafts will be the deepest commercial mineshafts in Britain. The project is expected to generate over ¬£100 billion for the UK economy over a period of 50 years. When the project is up and running, it will be the deepest mine in Europe and have the longest tunnel in Great Britain. History =Potash in North Yorkshire= Deposits of potash in North Yorkshire have been well known about since the 1930s when boreholes drilled for gas and oil also discovered the mineral. At least three submissions to mine the mineral were submitted in 1971 and a further one in 1978. Such was the belief of the venture in the Whitby area, that even after the railway line between Whitby and had closed, a small section between Prospect Hill at Whitby and was left in-situ for a commercial potash venture near to the village of Stainsacre. =Sirius Minerals= The initial proposal was forwarded from York Potash to the North York Moors National Park Authority in 2011. This enabled the Authority to allow test drilling at various sites along the coast between Whitby and Scarborough. The company decided to develop a site next to Doves Nest farm near to the hamlet of Sneatonthorpe. The geological survey pointed to a resource that is the world's largest and highest grade polyhalite deposit. Sirius withdrew its initial planning application in 2013 to re- examine key elements, particularly the project's environmental impact. Plans were resubmitted in 2014 with notable changes including an underground system of conveyor belts to transport the dry mineral, instead of a slurry pipeline, and other mitigation efforts. Originally, the transport methods for delivering the product from the mine were conveyor, pipeline and by rail on the Esk Valley line. The decision from members of the North York Moors National Park Authority to resolve to grant planning permission for the mine and mineral transport system, was made at a public meeting on 30 June 2015. When complete, the Project would be among the largest mining projects ever built in the United Kingdom. Sirius intend to have the mine and associated tunnel operational by 2021, with preferred bidder status on construction being announced in June 2016. Schematic of Woodsmith Mine operations The project requires the company to construct two shafts to reach the mineral seam which includes a mineable area of around . The twin shafts have been labelled as the deepest commercial mineshafts in Britain, and the mine will also be the deepest in Europe.Pyh√§salmi Mine in Finland is said to be the deepest at ; Woodsmith will exceed that depth by . To minimise the amount of visible infrastructure within the North York Moors National Park, a protected area, the polyhalite will then be transported at an average depth of in a tunnel to the company's processing plant at Teesside. The tunnel will consist of two conveyors: the first will be long and the second will be . There will be an interchange point between the two conveyors at Lockwood Beck, near Guisborough. After granulation and drying, the finished product‚Äî marketed by Sirius Minerals as POLY4‚Äîwill be exported from the nearby harbour facilities. The mine will produce 20 million tonnes a year of polyhalite, potash and POLY4 and is expected to be in production for 100 years. Woodsmith Mine has been projected as contributing over ¬£100 billion for the UK economy over a period of 50 years. In August 2017, the deep tunnels were being constructed on the site. The Times said that the project was the \\"biggest mining project Britain has seen in decades\\". Orders for the mineral have already been agreed with third-party distributors in America and South-East Asia to receive and respectively each year. In September 2018, Sirius Minerals revealed that had signed a seven-year deal with a Brazilian fertiliser distributor to export per year to South America. All mineral supplies will be delivered from a new harbour area on Teesside. The company acquired a site adjacent to the defunct Redcar Steelworks site in December 2017, which will serve as the northern portal of the conveyor. The site will be known as Bran Sands with initial building taking place in 2019. However, the site was assessed as not have satisfactory loading facilities for shipping, so in May 2018, Sirius signed an agreement with the South Tees Site Company, to option the site which lies from the Bran Sands site, but offers better access to the River Tees. In November 2018, Sirius agreed a multi-million pound contract to use the site next to the Redcar Bulk Terminal instead. Engineers will install a storage area and ship loading facilities to allow the product to be exported from the original site. In September 2019 the project was in doubt when Sirius shelved a ¬£400 million junk bond sale, citing a lack of government support and Brexit uncertainty. In November 2019 the company announced that it was in talks with potential investors to raise $600 million needed to fund the first phase of the development. In January 2020 Anglo American plc confirmed it was considering making a bid to buy Sirius Minerals, and then made a 5.5p per share offer to buy the project for ¬£400 million. In salvaging the financially troubled project, Anglo American envisaged spending around ¬£230 million to keep construction going through to at least 2022. Sirius advised shareholders that if the offer was rejected the company could face entering administration within weeks. Subject to approval by at least 75% of Sirius shareholders, the deal was expected to become effective by 31 March 2020. The sale was approved by shareholders on 4 March 2020. =Objections= Woodsmith Mine cairn with official opening date Many groups and campaigners objected to the project. An open letter signed by 29 different groups, including the Caravan Club, the RSPB and the Campaign for National Parks, was sent to the national park authority, whose own internal report stated that the economic benefits of the mine did not outweigh the environmental damage it would cause. Initially, the Ministry of Defence lodged an objection to the mine as its use of dynamite blasting had the potential to cause damage to the sensitive equipment at RAF Fylingdales which is only south west of the mine head. This objection was withdrawn when the company agreed to the MoD's conditions and monitoring of the mine's workings. However, some local people supported the venture. The farmer who works the land that will be adjacent to the minesite wrote to the NPA in support of the project stating Another local man stated that there was nothing in the area other than pot washing or working in the local fish and chip restaurant. =Naming and ground works= In February 2017, the project was given the name Woodsmith Mine in an unveiling by Andrew Percy MP, the Northern Powerhouse Minister. The name of the mine is a portmanteau of the surnames of Peter Woods and Dr Frederick Smith, who were two of the original geologists on the project. The mine head is situated on Doves Nest farm, a former beef farming site. Digging works at Woodsmith Mine Ground works on the mine and initial building was due to start in April 2017 whilst preparatory work on the access roads (including building new filter lanes on the A171 road) was undertaken in February and March 2017. In May 2017, Sirius minerals confirmed that construction work had officially started at the site with production of minerals starting in late 2021. Mineral transport tunnel In June 2018, work was started on the tunnel that would convey the polyhalite from the mine site to Teesside. The tunnel was originally due to be in diameter, but after the initial groundworks and with an enhanced understanding of the geological strata, this was changed to in diameter with the increased lining thickness too. This meant the company needed ¬£3.6 billion of stage 2 funding as opposed to the estimated ¬£3 billion it had projected for the tunnelling and mineshaft phase. Sirius issued a warning about the financial situation so that \\"everybody is clear of the significance of the stage-two funding for us to continue.\\" The first tunnel boring machine (TBM) arrived at Teesport in February 2019. The TBMs will number three with one working from Teesside southwards towards Whitby, whilst the other two will work from the mine site northwards towards Teesside. Each TBM weighs and will progress between and per day. The TBMs at the mine site will start off underground at a depth of around with the whole tunnel being at an average depth of . Tunnelling started from Teesside on 12 April 2019 and when completed, the tunnel will be the longest wholly within Great Britain.The Channel Tunnel is long, but only one end of the tunnel is in Britain.

She was the first Bahamian woman to contest an election in the Bahamas, the first female Senate appointee, and the first woman granted a leadership role in the Senate. Once in the legislature, she was the first woman to be made a government minister and then was elected as the first woman President of the Senate. She was the first woman to serve as Acting Governor General of the Bahamas, and was honored as Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II. Born on New Providence Island, she completed her secondary education and became a teacher. After teaching for 17 years, Johnson returned to school to earn a master's and doctorate degree in educational administration. During this period, she traveled back and forth between school and her Bahamian home organizing labor and suffrage efforts. Upon graduation, Johnson was unable to find work because of her activism. She made a compelling speech to the Bahamian legislature in 1959, pleading for women's suffrage and subsequently made a similar plea to the Colonial Office in London. Once the right to vote had been secured, Johnson immediately entered politics in 1961, running in the first election in which women were allowed to participate. Though she lost her bid, she worked with the Progressive Liberal Party to gain Bahamian independence. When the country gained its freedom from colonial rule, Johnson was appointed to the Senate and served the government until her death, a decade later. Background and education Doris Louise Sands was born on 19 June 1921 in St. Agnes, New Providence, The Bahamas, to Sarah Elizabeth (n√©e Fyne) and John Albert Sands. After completing her secondary education, Sands began teaching at the age of 15. On 3 January 1943 at Zion Baptist Church in Nassau, Sands married Ratal Allen Johnson. They subsequently had one son and Johnson worked for 17 years to earn the money to further her education. Around 1953, she was able to enroll at Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia, graduating with a bachelor's degree in education. She returned to the Bahamas in 1956 and joined the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP). Granted a four-year government scholarship to further her education in Canada, Johnson enrolled in a master's degree program in educational administration. Beginning her studies at MacDonald College of Education of McGill University, she earned her master's degree and began work on her doctorate at the Ontario College of Education at the University of Toronto. In the midst of her studies, the government terminated the scholarship during her third year of studying abroad, under the guise that her master's degree had been completed. Johnson believed that the scholarship was terminated because she had been active in organizing. She helped found the Women‚Äôs Suffrage Movement in the Bahamas, and in 1958 both the Bahamian Federation of Labour and the National Council of Women, traveling home intermittently during her studies to work towards enfranchisement. She returned home, but was advised that the only available positions for teaching administrators were in outlying islands. Political rise Feeling that her employment opportunities were being blocked, that same year, on 19 January 1959, Johnson asked to address the members of the Bahamian House of the Assembly, but was told she could only speak after the session adjourned, to which she agreed. In her speech, she pointed out that a petition had been submitted to the House in 1958 for suffrage, which Members had claimed showed only 13 petitioners and 529 signatories. She provided mimeographed copies showing the actual number was 2,829 people and included people from Abaco, Andros, Cat Island, Eleuthera, Exuma, Grand Bahama, Long Island, and New Providence. She went on to complain that women were being taxed without representation and reasoned that should the vote not be extended to them, they should no longer have to pay taxes. She insisted that women were working members of society and were ready, willing, and able to participate as full citizens. Though the Members of Parliament were impressed with the speech, they did nothing. In 1960, Johnson, as leader of the Women's Suffrage Movement, and Eugenia Lockhart, the organization's secretary, went to London to plead the case for suffrage. They met with the London branch of the International Alliance of Women to discuss the situation in the Bahamas, claiming that though they had the support of the majority of Bahamian women, many women could not voice their approval because they were employed by merchants and the government who were opposed to the cause. They also sought an audience at the Colonial Office to air their grievances, accompanied by the chairman of the PLP, Henry Milton Taylor. They met with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Iain Macleod, and two women British Parliamentarians, Baroness Joan Vickers and Baroness Eirene White. The Bahamians were assured that their case was accepted and that change would soon follow. They returned, but no change was forthcoming. Bahamian Parliament Building Supporters rallied and collected funds for Johnson to complete her education in the United States, and she enrolled at New York University, completing her Doctor of Education in 1962. When suffrage passed in 1961, Johnson immediately entered the fray, accepting a nomination as a PLP candidate for the Eleuthera District. She wrote a booklet entitled The Next Step: Votes for Women in which she explained useful information for voting, such as how to register to vote and cast a ballot. She lost the race, but three years later participated in a debate in the push for majority rule on the parliamentary imbalance in the Bahamas with a delegation from the PLP at the United Nations. At that meeting, she met the president of her alma mater from Virginia Union, and agreed to accept a teaching post at Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A little over a year later, Johnson left Louisiana and came back to the Bahamas to participate in the 1967 elections. The PLP won the majority of seats and she became the first woman appointee to serve in the Bahamian Senate. One of her first acts was to form a committee to help the Haitian diaspora who had fled to the Bahamas because of unrest in their own country. With an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 refugees and a government decree to stop issuing work permits to Haitians, the situation was critical. The following year, PLP had a landslide victory in the 1968 election and Johnson was reappointed to the Senate, and appointed as the first woman to lead government business. From 1968 to 1973, Johnson was the Transportation Minister and her appointment was the first time a woman had served in the Bahamian Cabinet. In 1972, Johnson published a book entitled The Quiet Revolution in the Bahamas, which discussed the struggle for racial parity and independence, likening the efforts in the Bahamas to the American Civil Rights Movement and Martin Luther King Jr.'s fight. The book has been called \\"one of the most important accounts of the events and personalities involved in the attainment of Majority Rule and Independence in The Bahamas\\". The following year, when the Bahama's gained independence from Britain, Johnson resigned from her post as Minister and was elected as the first female President of the Senate. In 1977, shortly after being reelected to the presidency, Johnson received Queen Elizabeth II. In 1979, she briefly served as acting Governor General of the Bahamas, the first woman ever to do so, and that same year was honored as Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. Besides her official roles, Johnson served as a founding member of the Bahamas Folklore Group and spoke at various women's groups in the Bahamas and United States. She also served as president of the National Women's Housing Association and coordinator of the Bahamas Baptist Missionary and Educational Convention's Women's Auxiliary. Johnson died aged 62 on 21 June 1983. Posthumously, a high school that bears her name was dedicated in 2002 in Nassau, and officially opened in 2011.  Selected works  * Contained in .

Early experience  Born in Limehouse in the East End of London, she married John Scurr in 1900, who was an accountant, trade unionist and associate of George Lansbury. A mother of three children born over four years, she also became a prominent activist for working women in the East End, and was the main organiser of a large demonstration against unemployment in 1905, following which she met the then Prime Minister, Arthur Balfour. In 1907, she was elected to the Poplar Board of Guardians, representing the Labour Party.\\"Poplar councillors\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography  Role in suffrage movement  An associate of Sylvia Pankhurst, Scurr joined her East London Federation of Suffragettes. She was one of the delegation of six women (Daisy Parsons, Jane Savoy, Jessie Payne, Mrs Bird and Mrs Watkins) from the East End who met with Prime Minister H. H. Asquith on 20 June 1914 following Pankhurst's hunger strike. This was just two weeks after her husband had made his fourth attempt to become an MP, unsuccessfully contesting Ipswich by-election. alt= Scurr's plea to the Prime Minister was for the demand for suffrage coming from East London working women (and men) living in poverty, who died young, and for the widows without support. She also asked about childcare, schooling and housing. Scurr said in reference to Mrs Pankhurst's hunger strike \\"We are here today to demand a vote for every woman over the age of twenty-one\\". The Prime Minister's response included some positive remarks about 'no disposition in any quarter to be vindictive' but in return asking for women's militancy to be condemned by the delegation. Scurr said their organisation were not arsonists, but did not want to criticise others nor should they ignore the 'all sorts' of methods that men had used in the past. Also in February 1914 she was a founder member of the United Suffragists. This became her primary area of activism and she was elected as one of its vice-presidents.  Political career and later life  She opposed British involvement in the First World War, but served on a food control committee during the conflict. In 1919, she was elected to Poplar Borough Council, playing a leading role in the Poplar Rates Rebellion of 1921, and she served as Mayor of Poplar in 1923/4. Scurr was elected to London County Council, representing Mile End, in 1925, but resigned early the following year. She died in April 1927. East London Federation of Suffragettes  Recognition  Her name and picture (and those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018.

Duncan's mother took a job on the wait staff at a Howard Johnson's in New York City. Duncan grew up in modest circumstances, yet because of the hard work of his parents he was able to focus on building a better life and to live the American dream. Dedicated to his studies, Duncan worked his way through school and became the first person in his family to achieve a higher education degree. Graduating from Marist College in 1969, he decided to follow in his father's footsteps and joined the military serving in the Army National Guard for five years. In business, he found his home in the emerging high-tech industry. Duncan began working in the High Tech equipment leasing and Disaster Recovery Services after college. He worked hard and became successful in his field. He was recognized by Fortune magazine as one of America's greatest sales people.

Design In 1930 the Direection G√©n√©rale Technique issued a programme for an aircraft to operate in the French Colonies. It was to have three Lorraine 9N Algol engines and an all-metal structure, capable of reconnaissance, observation, policing and bombing as well as medical evacuations or general transport. The Romano R.16 was one of nine prototypes built to this programme. Despite the all-metal requirement, the Romano R16 initially flew with a wing of mixed construction which was originally built for the rather similar Romano R.6 civil passenger aircraft. It is not known if the intended wing, all-metal and expected to be lighter, ever replaced it. On each side the high wing was in two parts, with a rectangular inner section attached to the top of the fuselage. The outer panels were straight tapered to rounded tips. The wing had two wooden box spars and spruce ribs and was entirely plywood covered. The centre section, over 40% of the span, was braced at its outer ends with a pair of parallel steel wing struts between the wing spars and the lower fuselage longerons, so that the R.16's wing was a semi-cantilever one. High aspect ratio ailerons occupied the whole outer panel trailing edge and camber changing flaps filled those of the centre section. The R.16 was powered by three Lorraine 9N Algol nine cylinder radial engines enclosed by long chord NACA-type cowlings. One was in the nose of the fuselage and the other were mounted under the wing centre section from the forward wing struts, aided by bracing struts rising inwards to the wing root and short vertical struts to the forward spar. Long nacelles behind the outer engines tapered to the rear wing strut. Structurally the R.16's fuselage was built around steel tube longerons, giving it a simple rectangular cross-section. The pilots' enclosed cabin was below and just ahead of the wing leading edge, fitted with side-by-side seating and dual controls. Behind them there was a generous cabin, accessed via a large port side door. Aft of the cabin, just behind the trailing edge was a dorsal gunner's position. At the rear the fixed surfaces were approximately triangular and carried a balanced rudder and elevators, also balanced. Each tailplane was braced on the vertex of a V-strut from the lower fuselage. The tail surfaces were steel tube structures with fabric covering The colonial aircraft were expected to have to use basic or unprepared strips, so needed a robust undercarriage. The R.16 had large diameter wheels, independently mounted and fitted with brakes that could be use for steering, enclosed under large fairings. Each wheel was on a cranked steel half axle from the lower fuselage with a trailing recoil strut and a vertical oleo leg to the engine mounting. Development The R.16 flew for the first time in February 1933. By May the initial development tests at Romano's Cannes factory were complete. It then went to Villacoublay for its official tests, which were completed by early September. The Colonial trimotor contract was awarded to the Bloch MB.120, so no more R.16s were built. The sole example appeared in the prototypes section of the French civil aircraft register as F-AKGE, with the type name Romano 160 and was used by the Commander of the 5th Aerial Region of French North Africa as his personal transport. A photograph taken at Cannes in 1937 shows that by then it had been adapted to carry passengers, the cabin now lit by long, continuous windows on each side. It also had a revised vertical tail with an unbalanced rudder.

Hintz (May 31, 1976 ‚Äì December 24, 2017), known professionally as Mathew \\"boo\\" Hintz, was an American painter who painted and drew in the impressionist style. He focused on motorcycles and motorcycle cultures, specifically Harley-Davidson.  Education  In 1994, Mathew \\"boo\\" Hintz enrolled at The Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design (MIAD) and graduated in 1998 with a BFA in Painting. During his studies, Hintz interned at The Harley- Davidson Motor Company and was introduced to the motorcycle world of styling and design. Hintz's internship continued with Harley-Davidson for two years (1996‚Äì98).  Career  After graduating from MIAD, Mathew \\"boo\\" Hintz followed his passion and relationship with Harley-Davidson and co-founded Studios 304 (1998). As a sub-contractor for Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Hintz provided design, graphics, artwork and digital photo retouching services. Establishing and proving his talent as a styling and graphic designer, Hintz continued his work with the motorcycle giant, working closely with others in the Styling Department and Creative Services, creating motorcycle paint designs, helmet graphics, and tank medallions. As a steward of the brand, his works provided numerous contributions to the legend that is Harley-Davidson. One of Hintz's first assignments was to work on the design of the tank medallion for the Softail Deluxe. He then worked with styling and marketing to design additional medallions and graphics for Harley-Davidson. Mathew \\"boo\\" Hintz's professional portfolio boasted rocker patches, t-shirts, logos and graphics for HOG, Buell, Motorclothes, Harley-Davidson anniversary merchandise and models. He painted the cover art for all of the Harley- Davidson Owner Manuals from 2008 to 2017. In 2005, and at the request of friends and co-workers, he began painting portraits of the iconic motorcycles. As the demand for his work grew, Hintz discovered the powerful fusion of his artistic talents with a shared fervor for all things Harley-Davidson. In 2013, Hintz co-created a painting of a purple Harley-Davidson Softail Breakout motorcycle with Reagan Imhoff, who was the Muscular Dystrophy Association Ambassador for Wisconsin. The painting raised $3,500 for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. The pair collaborated again in 2014, and that painting raised more than $10,000 for MDA. In 2014, Hintz became one of Harley- Davidson's licensed fine artists and formed Hintz Studios. As an official Harley-Davidson artist, Hintz was able to use his work to better support the brand and allow the motorcycle enthusiasts a new artistic outlet for their passions. In 2014, Mathew \\"boo\\" Hintz knew he could spend more time behind the canvas doing what he was trained to do: paint. Hintz's motorcycle portraits were inspired by the special details that make each model special. Brushstrokes heavily laden with acrylic paint allowed Hintz to \\"sculpt\\" as he painted, creating a unique three-dimensional sculptural surface. The process of Hintz's paint application process results in a signature, impressionistic style that make his paintings distinctive. Like a clear coat finish on a motorcycle, Hintz's paintings are finished layer upon layer with glaze for a glossy shine. Beginning in 2014, Hintz created series of limited edition prints to offer enthusiasts a more affordable way to collect his work. On January 19, 2016 at a Harley-Davidson Dealership Show in Phoenix Arizona, Hintz released his Aluminum Series prints. The Aluminum Series utilized the most technologically advanced printers to print directly on an aluminum sheet material. Harley-Davidson and motorcycle enthusiasts alike have a unique passion for their bikes, their culture, and the spirit of life on the road. Hintz shared that passion, and it is visible in every stroke of his brush.  Death  Mathew Hintz died unexpectedly on December 24, 2017.

Career In 1967, Remsen earned his high-school diploma at the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. In summer 1968 he worked for the Denver Wildlife Research Center.The American Ornithologists' Union: William Brewster Memorial Award, 2013: J. V. (‚ÄúVan‚Äù) Remsen Jr. In: The Auk, 130(4):819‚Äì820. In 1971, he graduated both to Master of Arts and Bachelor of Arts in biology at Stanford University. In 1978, he received his PhD in zoology at the University of California, Berkeley under the direction of Frank Pitelka with his dissertation \\"Geographical ecology of Neotropical Kingfishers\\", based on almost two years of fieldwork in Amazonian Colombia and Bolivia. In the same year he became a professor and curator of birds at Louisiana State University. Remsen published his first scientific paper at age 20, and published other technical papers during his graduate student years, including the article \\"On taking field notes\\" in the journal American Birds which became much-noticed by field observers and American birders in the following decades. While at LSU, Remsen spent a total of two years in the remote areas of the Amazon and the Andes, which became the basis for the book An Annotated List of the Birds of Bolivia (), which was published in 1989 in collaboration with Melvin Alvah Traylor Jr.. In 1991, Remsen published the monograph Community Ecology of Neotropical Kingfishers, and in 1997 produced the monograph \\"Studies in Neotropical Ornithology Honoring Ted Parker\\" \\"Ornithological Monographs\\"\\" No. 48: 1-917), a collection of 51 peer-reviewed papers. In 2007, he co-edited with Carla Cicero another monograph honoring the career of his mentor Ned K. Johnson: \\"Festschrift to Ned K. Johnson: Geographic Variation and Evolution in Birds.Ornithological Monographs\\" 63: 1-114. To start a standardized classification and nomenclature of the Neotropical avifauna, Remsen sent a proposal to the American Ornithologists' Union in 1997 to create a South American counterpart to the already known AOU Check-list Committee which covered the avifauna of the Western Hemisphere from Panama and north to the Caribbean. In 1999, the proposal for the constitution of the South American Classification Committee (SACC) has been approved and in October 2000 the first classification on the split of the Huayco Tinamou (Rhynchotus maculicollis) from the Red-winged Tinamou (Rhynchotus rufescens) was available online.Proposal (1) to South American Classification Committee Elevate \\"Rhynchotus maculicollis\\" to species rank The system that Remsen invented for SACC was to place all proposals for change online and open access, as well as comments and votes concerning those proposals; thus, the system is completely transparent and qualified non-committee members are invited to contribute. Remsen is also a member (since 1984) of the American Ornithologists' Union's North American Classification Committee and thus co-author of the printed version of that classification.Banks, R. C., B.

It is a salt tolerant plant and dominates many of the plant communities in which it grows. Description Tetraena alba is a low, much- branched shrub. The leaves have paired obovoid, fleshy leaflets which are whitish with mealy pubescence. The small flowers are solitary and grow in the axils of the leaves; they have white, clawed petals. The fruit is a five- lobed, pear-shaped capsule containing elliptical seeds with wart-like projections. Distribution This species is found in Spain, Crete, Northern and Northeast Africa, Mauritania, Western Asia (including southern Cyprus, the Eastern Aegean Islands and the Sinai Peninsula) and the Arabian Peninsula. Ecology Tetraena alba is a salt-tolerant plant; it does not have glands to secrete the excess salt it takes up, instead it concentrates the salt in its leaves and then sheds them, also shedding its petioles when necessary. It is found in a number of different habitats; one of these is \\"phytogenic hillocks\\", hummocky landforms typical in areas with blown sands; another is in saline depressions, sometimes as pure stands, and other times as the dominant plant in its community. Other plants in the salt-tolerant communities in which it lives include Halocnemum strobilaceum, Nitraria retusa and Limonium axillare. At the Moghra Oasis in the Qattara Depression there is a brackish lake and a Phragmites swamp, and T. alba grows at the perimeter, where the desert plains start. In the innermost part of this zone it forms hummocks and grows with Tamarix nilotica, Alhagi maurorum and Nitraria retusa. In the outermost part the plants are scant, do not form mounds and are progressively smaller.

The story is of a smith who makes a pact with a malevolent being‚Äîcommonly the Devil (in later times), Death or a genie‚Äîselling his soul for some power, then tricks the devil out of his prize. In one version, the smith gains the power to weld any material, he then uses this power to stick the devil to an immovable object, allowing the smith to renege on the bargain. The tale was collected by Giambattista Basile in Lo cunto de li cunti of 1634, then the Brothers Grimm in their Children's and Household Tales (published in two volumes in 1812 and 1815), although they removed it in editions of 1822 and later, substituting \\"Brother Lustig\\" and relegating references to it to the notes for \\"Gambling Hansel\\", a very similar tale. Edith Hodgetts' 1891 book Tales and Legends from the Land of the Tsar collects a Russian version, while Ruth Manning-Sanders included a Gascon version as \\"The Blacksmith and the Devil\\" in her 1970 book A Book of Devils and Demons.. Richard Chase presents a version from the Southern Appalachians, called \\"Wicked John and the Devil.\\" According to George Monbiot, the blacksmith is a motif of folklore throughout (and beyond) Europe associated with malevolence (the medieval vision of Hell may draw upon the image the smith at his forge), and several variant tales tell of smiths entering into a pact with the devil to obtain fire and the means of smelting metal. According to research applying phylogenetic techniques to linguistics by folklorist Sara Gra√ßa da Silva and anthropologist Jamie Tehrani, \\"The Smith and the Devil\\" may be one of the oldest European folk tales, with the basic plot stable throughout the Indo-European speaking world from India to Scandinavia, possibly being first told in Indo-European 6,000 years ago in the Bronze Age. Folklorist John Lindow, however, notes that a word for \\"smith\\" may not have existed in Indo-European, and if so the tale may not be that old.

The show follows the investigators in real time as they try to solve the crime, which took place in June 1997. This is the first true crime series developed by Discovery. The show is executive produced by Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana among others. The Crime In June 1997 in Iberville Parish, Louisiana, Eugenie Boisfontaine disappeared. Her body was found two months later in a nearby ditch. Her head had blunt force trauma. Was it a singular murder or from a string of serial murders in the area? (There were 60 cases of missing and murdered women in the area during that time period and several serial murderers lived in nearby Baton Rouge.) Detective Rodie Sanchez was the first investigator assigned to the case in 1997. Because he could never stop thinking about it, he came out of retirement to try to solve the crime. Detective Aubrey St. Angelo is a young detective who is helping Sanchez on the case. His father worked with Sanchez for many years before he retired. Both detectives are joined by many other detectives in the Iberville Parish Sheriff's office. Suspects during the investigation featured in the show were: Derrick Todd Lee, also known as the Baton Rouge Serial Killer, an unidentified male named Robert that Eugenie may have dated at the time of her murder and Michael Schmidt, her ex-husband.

Poole William J. Shankle, Jason P. Schein, David Parris, Jason C. Poole (2016). Bighorn Basin Dinosaur Project 2016 Field Guide. Trenton, New Jersey. The Bighorn Basin Dinosaur Project (BBDP) is a paleontological research and education group focusing on the Mesozoic ecosystems of the Bighorn Basin in northern Wyoming and southern Montana, U.S.A. BBDP is headquartered in the Bureau of Natural History at the New Jersey State Museum (NJSM) in Trenton, New Jersey, United States, but has welcomed increasing research and educational collaborations with paleontologists from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Wyoming Dinosaur Center in Thermopolis, Wyoming, and The Woods Project of Houston, Texas.  History  The New Jersey State Museum‚Äôs activities in the Bighorn Basin of northern Wyoming and southern Montana continues a long tradition of paleontological research in the region by some of the science's founding fathers in North America, including many with ties to Princeton University. William Berryman Scott, Francis Spier, and Henry Fairfield Osborne all visited the region in the 1880s, though these expeditions were largely unsuccessful. W. B. Scott's student and successor, William J. Sinclair, first teamed with American Museum of Natural History paleontologist Walter W. Granger in 1910 which resulted in numerous, far more successful expeditions to the region. Together, Sinclair and Granger established the Bighorn Basin as a significant region for Cenozoic fossils. Sinclair continued his expeditions into the region through the 1920s with additional Princeton students, including Glenn Jepsen, who dedicated the remainder of his professional career to the study of Paleocene mammals of the Bighorn Basin. Jepsen, in turn, introduced many more Princeton paleontology students to the region, including present-day paleontologists Philip D. Gingerich, Barbara Grandstaff, and David Parris. David Parris has continued the tradition, spending much of his nearly 50-year career studying the fossil ecosystems of the northern Bighorn Basin, almost entirely as a paleontologist in the Bureau of Natural History at the New Jersey State Museum. As the Curator of Natural History at the NJSM, David Parris began leading students, colleagues, and volunteers to the region on paleontological expeditions to the Bighorn Basin annually from 2001 through 2010. Jason Schein, Assistant Curator of Natural History at the New Jersey State Museum, has continued the efforts, leading the annual expeditions since 2011, with Parris taking more of an advisory role in the expeditions and research projects. In 2015, the NJSM‚Äôs research efforts in the Bighorn Basin were formalized under the name \\"Bighorn Basin Dinosaur Project.\\" The field headquarters for the BBDP are located at the Yellowstone-Bighorn Research Association in Red Lodge, Montana. The stated research goals of the BBDP are to study and understand, to the greatest extent possible, the ecosystems that existed throughout that region during the Mesozoic and the early Cenozoic eras. The BBDP is equally dedicated to educating students and lay people about paleontology and Earth and natural sciences through hands-on, field-based experiences. The mission of the BBDP is to maintain a highly respected research group, and to provide world-class educational opportunities.

Gripenberg's 1925 poetry collection Den hemliga gl√∂den, published under the pseudonym √Öke Erikson, is a parody of modernist poetry. He also translated English and Finnish works into Swedish. Among his more prominent translations are Johannes Linnankoski's novel The Song of the Blood-Red Flower and Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology. From an early age Gripenberg had a disdain for egalitarian thought and parliamentary democracy, and participated on the White side in the Finnish Civil War. His 1918 poem \\"Den dr√∂mda arm√©n\\" (\\"the dreamed army\\") has been interpreted as a prediction of the Winter War. He joined the Lapua Movement but looked down on the Fascist and National Socialist movements which he found to be plebeian. He participated in the Peasant March to Helsinki in the summer of 1930, but after that rarely took part in any public political activity.

There are two important dimensions: (1) whether the object of control is in the past or the future and (2) whether the object of control is over outcome, behavior, or process.  History  The cognitive revolution which was completed around the 1940s changed Psychology. Being influenced by the idea of Pavlov and other physiologists, scientists turned their interest in direction of the observable. Away from subjectivity, the objective investigation of behavior became trustworthy and allocable. This revolution helped developing fields of the study of perceived control. Goal seeking and human motivation became important in many theories. In 1959, White introduced a theory called \\"effectance motivation\\", in which human drive for control is explained through an innate need to be able to handle a situation and the obtainment of control over the environment. In 1966 Julian Rotter published his Publication:\\"Generalized Expectancies for Internal versus External Control of Reinforcement.‚Äù in which he used the term \\"perceived control\\" for the very first time. His work influenced multiple disciplines such as psychology, sociology, economics and health care. After his publication, the scientific work on his concept of perceived internal control differed mostly into two branches. One believed perceived control to be a fixed personality trait, and therefore refers to concepts like self efficacy and competence, the other spoke about perceived control as a cognitive process, influenced from environmental clues that could be manipulated systematically. This relates to concepts as illusion of control, learned helplessness and mindfullness. ‚ÄúA series of studies provide strong support for the hypotheses that the individual who has a strong belief that he (sic) can control his own destiny is likely to be alert to those aspects of the environment, which provide useful information for his future behavior; (b) take steps to improve his environmental condition; (c) place greater value on skill or achievement of reinforcements and be generally more concerned with his ability, particularly his failures; and (d) be resistive to subtle attempts to influence him.‚Äù Rotter 1966 From this perspective perceived control can either be seen as a personality trait or a cognitive processing, which in either case enhances functioning and survival. = Historical research = In the year 1975, Martin E.P. Seligman coined the term \\"learned helplessness\\". In Terms of perceived control, Seligman's term of \\"learned helplessness\\" described that the perceived control of a situation leads to a specific outcome of behavior. Seligman confronted dogs with a situation accompanied by a total lack of perceived control, which ultimately lead the dogs to give into the situation. They learned passiveness, helplessness. Seligman transferred his experiments to humans, speculating that perceived control is related to the development of, for instance, depression. Research by Schulz and Hansua on Perceived Control focuses on the causal relationships between one's own control and his psychological and physiological well-being and not only on the correlation of these factors. In a study done in 1978, pensioners living in a retirement home participants were about to gain control or lose control. They could either decide themselves when they wanted students to visit them or had no influence on scheduling the student's visit. The results show that pensioners who have control over when they will be having visitors felt better and were healthier than pensioners in the \\"no influence\\"-group. This study describes perceived control as a cognitive process that manipulates the person's health and motivation. Therefore, self-efficacy is an important factor influencing the effectiveness of perceived control. Blittner, Goldberg and Merbaum reasoned in 1978 that only if the person believes in his/her abilities and success, he/she can perform better or change behavior. A study by Sastry and Ross in 1998 concluded that there are cultural differences on perceived control, too. According to the researchers, perceived control is seen as more important by people living in Western Countries than by Asians. Additionally, Asians do not make an association between perceived control and mental well-being. This difference is explained by different focuses of the cultures. Western Culture appreciates individualism and personal success which leads the people to feel the urge of controlling the own process and performance. People are more likely to understand perceived control as a personality trait.  Scientific models  = Two Process Model of Perceived Control = The Two Process Model of Perceived Control was first proposed by Rothbaum, Weisz and Snyder. According to the Two-Process Model People attempt to gain control not only by bringing the environment into line with their wishes (primary control) but also by bringing themselves into line with environmental forces (secondary control). Four manifestations of secondary control are considered: # Attributions to severely, limited ability can serve to enhance predictive control and to protect against disappointment. # Attributions to chance can reflect illusory control since people often construe chance as a personal characteristic akin to an ability (\\"luck\\"). # Attributions to powerful others permit vicarious control when the individual identifies with these others. # All of the preceding attributions may foster interpretive control, in which the individual seeks to understand and derive meaning from otherwise uncontrollable events in order to accept them. Four Factor Model of Perceived Control In December 1989 Fred B. Bryant published his research, introducing his ‚ÄúFour-Factor Model of Perceived Control‚Äù. He referred to the Two-Process Model of Perceived Control proposed by Rothbaum et al. which states that people‚Äôs controlling responses are classified as either attempts to change the world (I e, primary control) or attempts to change oneself to fit in with the world (I e, secondary control). Bryant added two more factors to that model; positive and negative experience. He explained that perceived control results from a self-evaluation of one‚Äôs ability to: * Avoiding ‚Äì Primary-Negative Control Avoiding, according to Bryant is defined as ‚ÄúThe perceived ability to avoid negative outcomes‚Äù. It is dependent on the 1. The degree of personal control over bad things, 2. The Frequency of bad things occurring and 3. The Likelihood of bad things occurring. * Coping ‚Äì Secondary-Negative Control Coping, according to Bryant is defined as ‚ÄúThe perceived ability to cope with negative outcomes‚Äù. It is dependent on 1. The ability to cope with bad things, 2. How much one is bothered by bad things and 3. How long bad things affect one‚Äôs feelings. * Obtaining ‚Äì Primary-Positive Control Obtaining, according to Bryant is defined as ‚ÄúThe perceived ability to obtain positive outcomes‚Äù. It is dependent on 1. The degree of personal control over good things, 2. The personal responsibility for good things, 3. The frequency of good things to occur and 4. The likelihood of good things to occur. * Savouring ‚Äì Secondary- Positive Control Savouring, according to Bryant is defined as ‚ÄúThe perceived ability to savor positive outcomes‚Äù. It is dependent on 1. The ability to enjoy good things, 2. How much one is pleased by good things, 3. How long good things affect one‚Äôs feelings, 4. The frequency of feeling on top of the world and 5. The frequency of feeling overjoyed.  Applications and clinical perspective  In a study conducted by Wallston et al. (1997)Wallston, K., Ph.D., Wallston, B., Smith, S., & Dobbins, C. (1987). Perceived control and health. Current Psychology: A Journal for Diverse Perspectives on Diverse Psychological Issues it was stated that perceived control can influence health in two conscious forms: health behavior (e.g. eating healthy) and health status (e.g. obesity). Furthermore, it can also affect it in an unconscious way by impacting the physiological processes directly, as proven by Rodin (1986).Rodin, J. (1986). Aging and health: Effects of the sense of control. Science, 233 He states that internal events such as unpredictability and loss of control can affect catecholamine, neurohormonal and immune changes. Wallston et al. go on explaining that there is also a connection between the locus of control and perceived control on health outcomes. Locus of control, a concept developed by Julian B. Rotter in 1954,Rotter, J. (1954). Social learning and clinical psychology (Prentice-Hall psychology series). New York: Prentice-Hall. says that a person can attribute certain events in their life internally, as they themselves being responsible for them, or externally, as outside sources being accountable for them. The study by Kaplan, Atkins, and Reinsch (1984)Kaplan, R.M., Atkins, C.J., & Reinsch, S. (1984). Specific efficacy expectations mediate exercise compliance in patients with COPD. Health Psychology, 3 dealt with these ideas. They wanted to see if individual differences in loci of control can predict the amount of exercise tolerance and health status criteria in pulmonary disease patients. The results showed that for health internals, the more efficient and in control they felt, the higher their exercise tolerance and in turn the better their overall health status was. On the other hand, there was no relationship between efficiency beliefs and outcomes in the case of health externals. There have also been several studies about the relationship between perceived control and cancer. A cancer diagnosis can greatly reduce the Perceived Control a patient beliefs to have. This loss of perceived control has been found to correlate with greater psychological distress.

History  Yankee Publishing, Inc. (YPI) was founded by Robb Sagendorph with his wife, Beatrix, in 1935 with the publication of the first issue of Yankee Magazine. Four years later, in 1939, Sagendorph purchased the Old Farmer's Almanac, the country's oldest continuously published periodical. Now 200+ years old, the publication is more widely read than at any time in its history. YPI is still a privately-held family business run out of the same barn-red building where it was founded. In 2013, YPI expanded their offerings by acquiring McLean Communications, which includes New Hampshire magazine and New Hampshire Business Review. The company has shifted some of its focus into offering custom publishing services. In July 2019, Yankee Publishing acquired Family Tree Magazine. After the sale, Yankee President and CEO Jamie Trowbridge stated Family Tree fit well with the company's suite of brands, which include Yankee, The Old Farmer's Almanac, and New Hampshire magazines.

One of the best-known arts of the Mapuche is their textiles. The tradition of Mapuche textile production dates back to pre-Hispanic times and continues up to this day. Prior to the 20th century Mapuche textiles and ponchos in particular were important trade items. History In Andean societies, textiles had a great importance. They were developed to be used as clothing, as tool and shelter for the home, as well as a status symbol.Murra, 1975. In the Araucan√≠a region in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as reported by various chroniclers of Chile, the Mapuche worked to have Hispanic clothing and fabrics included as a trophy of war in treaties with the Spanish. They dressed their dead in their best clothes and finest textiles for their funerals.Palermo, 1994; M√©ndez, 2009b. The oldest data on textiles in the southernmost areas of the American continent (southern Chile and Argentina today) are found in some archaeological excavations, such as those of Pitr√©n Cemetery near the city of Temuco, and the Alboyanco site in the Biob√≠o Region, both of Chile; and the Rebolledo Arriba Cemetery in Neuqu√©n Province (Argentina). researchers have found evidence of fabrics made with complex techniques and designs, dated to between AD 1300-1350.Brugnoli y Hoces de la Guardia, 1995; Alvarado, 2002 The oldest historical documents that refer to textile art among the indigenous peoples of southern Chilean and Argentine territory, date from the sixteenth century and consist of chronicles of European explorers and settlers. These accounts say that at the time of European arrival in the region of the Araucan√≠a, local natives wore textiles made with camel's hair (alpaca and llamas), which they had made from the fur of these animals. Later, after the Spanish introduced sheep, the Indians began breeding these animals and using their wool for their weaving. Gradually it replaced the use of camelid hair. By the end of the sixteenth century, the indigenous people had bred sheep with more robust bodies and thicker and longer wool than those imported by the Europeans. These new breeds were better suited to local conditions.Joseph, 1931; Palermo, 1994; M√©ndez, 2009a. =Production= The Mapuche women were responsible for spinning and weaving. Knowledge of both weaving techniques and textile patterns particular to the locality were usually transmitted within the family, with mothers, grandmothers, and aunts teaching a girl the skills they had learned from their own elders. Women who excelled in the textile arts were highly honored for their :accomplishments and contributed economically and culturally to their kinship group. A measure of the importance of weaving is evident in the expectation that a man give a larger dowry for a bride who was an accomplished weaver.Wilson, 1992; Mendez, 2009a. =Trade= In addition, the Mapuche used their textiles as an important surplus and an exchange trading good. Numerous 16th-century accounts describe their bartering the textiles with other indigenous peoples, and with colonists in newly developed settlements. Such trading enabled the Mapuche to obtain those goods that they did not produce or held in high esteem, such as horses. Tissue volumes made by Aboriginal women and marketed in the Araucan√≠a and the north of the Patagonia Argentina were really considerable and constitute a vital economic resource for indigenous families.Guaravaglia, 1986; Palermo, 1994; Mendez, 2009b. The production of fabrics in the time before European settlement was clearly intended for uses beyond domestic consumption.M√©ndez, 2009b. 19th century Mapuche ponchos were clearly superior to non-indigenous Chilean textiles and of good quality when comparing to contemporary European wool textiles. According to reports of the time a poncho could be traded for several horses or up to seventy kilos of yerba mate. Current use and production At present, the fabrics woven by the Mapuche continue to be used for domestic purposes, as well as for gift, sale or barter. Most Mapuche women and their families now wear garments with foreign designs and tailored with materials of industrial origin, but they continue to weave ponchos, blankets, bands and belts for regular use. Many of the fabrics are woven for trade, and in many cases, are an important source of income for families.Wilson, 1992; Alvarado, 2002; Mendez, 2009a. Many Mapuche women continue to weave fabrics according to the customs of their ancestors and transmit their knowledge in the same way: within domestic life, from mother to daughter, and from grandmothers to granddaughters. This form of learning is based on gestural imitation, and only rarely, and when strictly necessary, the apprentice receives explicit instructions or help from their instructors. Knowledge is transmitted as fabric is woven, the weaving and transmission of knowledge go together.

He is an artist of Fantastic Realism.  Life  While growing up in Augsburg, Michael Maschka came into contact with Renaissance and Baroque art at an early age. Although he hardly received artistic impulses from his middle-class family environment he soon discovered his passion for drawing and painting. After he completed his artistic education at the Staatliche Fachoberschule Augsburg (technical college), Maschka went to Berlin in 1983. He began to study social pedagogy after he was rejected by the Berlin University of the Arts (UdK). This was his profession until 1993. At the same time he exhibited his works in Augsburg and Berlin. As a follower of Surrealism and Fantastic Realism he met his great idol the Austrian artist Ernst Fuchs, who was one of the founders of the Vienna School of Fantastic Realism, in 1994. Fuchs promoted Maschka. As his assistant Maschka worked with him on several projects such as the Fuchs' church in Thal near Graz.Gerhard Habarta: Lexikon der phantastischen K√ºnstler. Books on Demand GmbH, Norderstedt 2010, p. 320, Since then he has participated in exhibitive projects in Europe and further afield. Until 2014 he was a member of \\"Dali's heirs\\", a group which was founded by Roger M. Erasmy in 2003, and celebrated successes in France and Germany with the Dali railway wagon.Roger M. Erasmy, see: :fr:Roger Michel Erasmy As one of the founders of Labyrinthe (Association for Phantastic and Visionary Arts, founded 2001), Michael Maschka has made it his goal to care for the life's work of Edgar Ende and to make it available to the public by means of exhibitions. In this framework he wants to bring young artists and promoters of Fantastic Realism together. Nowadays he lives in N√∂rdlingen, Bavaria, Germany.  Work  Michael Maschka is a representative of Fantastic Realism. The formal approach in his pictures is realistic and is influenced by the care that the Old Masters took. He meticulously applies the techniques of the Old Masters to underline the message in his pictures. The viewer should be beguiled by the puzzles that his fantastic pictures present and by the sensuality that is tangible. He uses the vocabulary of the visible reality to trace the invisible structures of a spiritual reality that he has perceived. The motif nudity which appears in many of his pictures does not represent a projection surface for sexuality but is a symbol for naturalness and vulnerability. The female figure appears in his pictures in the form of the anima, the unconscious side of the soul of the male. By means of painting and etching he tries to bring out the unveiled and vulnerable self and to present it pictorially. In doing so he wants to bring the inner and outer picture into harmony. Maschka wants to sharpen the perception of the observer so that he looks behind the scenes of his personally constructed world. In his pictures Maschka often refers to motifs of German and Greek Mythology, because for him they include the universal language of the archetypes, a language which over thousands of years has remained uninfluenced by time and cultural influences and is understood intuitively by mankind. These motifs, that always rotate around the topics of destruction and renewal within nature or mankind, form a basic part of his pictorial language. This should lay bare conceptual approaches that have been long believed forgotten but have lived on in our subconscious. The symbolism of his pictures aims to cause the viewer to ponder and discover anew appreciation for the world that is not immediately available behind the visible reality.Press, see: Michael Maschka: PresseLife and Work, see: Elena Sigmantowitsch: \\"Introduction\\": Kulturverein Kitzingen und Umgebung PAM e.V.: Michael Maschka.

Information sites at Southern Beekeeper's include the Molah Hill vista point and Hill River. The reserve is bordered to the southeast by Cervantes, Western Australia, and to the southwest by Nambung National Park. A large area of vacant Crown Land is found along much of the eastern edge.  History  From 1889 until it was officially closed in 1971, a stock route between Dongara and Perth ran through what is now Southern Beekeeper's Nature Reserve and Nambung National Park. Southern Beekeeper's was gazetted by the Department of Lands and Surveys, Western Australia in 1979, \\"for the purpose of 'Apiculture and Conservation of Flora'.\\" Officially the reserve did not have a name, but was known locally as Southern Beekeeper's as beekeeping had been taking place in the area for generations, with beekeepers starting on the coastal plains during the spring, then moving on as the season progressed.  Natural features  Starting at Southern Beekeeper's in the north, and extending south across Nambung National Park and Wanagarren Nature Reserve, the area has 18 beaches along of coastline. Some sandy areas have large, active parabolic dunes.  Flora and fauna  The vegetation in the reserve is made up primarily of scrub heath and Kwongan heath. Both Banksia woodlands and clumps of tuart exists, however they are near their northern range limit. At least 18 species of invasive plants have been reported in the reserve. Animals observed in Southern Beekeeper's Nature Reserve include six species of native mammals. Additionally 56 species of birds were identified, as well as three species of frogs and eleven of reptiles.  Challenges  Cervantes is completely surrounded by protected areas, with Southern Beekeeper's Nature Reserve north of the town, and Nambung National Park south of it. In order to better protect Nambung from encroachment, excision of land from Southern Beekeeper's has been proposed in order to allow for future expansion of the townsite. Additionally mining tenements occur in the reserve.

Some researchers have defined book deserts by linking them to poverty and low income, while others use a combination of factors that include census data, income, ethnicity, geography, language, and the number of books in a home. Initiatives that increase the availability of books by such measures as bookmobiles and librarians on bicycles have been offered as possible solutions to book deserts, as have Little Free Libraries and offering children's literature available online, free of charge.  Background and research  In the past, researchers have studied how the absence or scarcity of books impact how a child's early literacy and language skills develop. The term \\"book desert\\" came into regular use in the mid-2010s and the social enterprise Unite for Literacy is credited as having coined the term. Unite for Literacy created an operational definition of a book desert when they published the U.S. Book Desert Map: A geographic area (country, state, county, census tract) where it is predicted that a majority of homes have less than 100 printed books. In March 2014, James LaRue, director of the American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom and the Freedom to Read Foundation, used the term in an issue of American Libraries, where he described the term as applying to houses with 25 or fewer books in them and discussed ways to lessen or eradicate the problem. In July 2016, professors Susan B. Neuman and Naomi Moland published a study in Urban Education, where they examined how the lack of printed reading material among low-income and poverty stricken neighborhoods impacts early childhood development and used the term to describe areas and homes with little access to written materials. This study built upon other research Neuman had conducted in 2001 on the same topic and the researchers found few stores in Detroit, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C.; the focus areas of their research had print resources for children ages 0 through 18. Of those stores, many were dollar stores. The Atlantic reported that in 2015 Neuman and JetBlue Airways held an experiment to foster literacy by providing book vending machines in a low-income Washington D.C. neighborhood. Over 20,000 books were given away, prompting Neuman to conclude that the neighborhood's parents did care about their children's education but lacked \\"the resources to enable their children to be successful.\\" = Contributing factors = Multiple factors are credited as contributing to the formation of book deserts, the most frequently highlighted of which tends to be poverty and low income. Other factors tend to include language and geography, as some areas lack access to bookstores or public or community school libraries that would provide books. Book store closures due to bankruptcy or other financial difficulties are also occasionally cited as a contributing factor, when the closure leaves the area without a bookseller.  Depictions  US Book Desert map from Unite for Literacy Unite for Literacy has developed a book desert map of the United States powered by Esri's ArcGIS platform, which provides a visual presentation of the lack of books in the nation, states, counties and census tracts. To create the map, Unite for Literacy performed a statistical analyses of data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the American Community Survey. Data used in the map includes the number of books in 4th graders' homes, average community income, ethnic diversity, geographic location and home language. Unite for Literacy unveiled the map during the Clinton Global Initiative America (CGI America) meeting held in Denver, Colorado, in June 2014.

On 2 February 2016, an explosion occurred on board the aircraft 20 minutes after it took off from Mogadishu. The aircraft was able to return to the airport safely, with one fatality (the bomber) reported. A subsequent investigation indicated that the explosion was caused by a bomb, detonated in a suicide attack. The Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab later claimed responsibility for the bombing. A total of ten people were convicted in relation to the plot.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved was a 19-year-old Airbus A321-111, SX-BHS, owned by Hermes Airlines, and operated by Daallo Airlines at the time of the incident. The aircraft was delivered to Daallo Airlines on 5 January 2015. The aircraft had previously been operated by Hermes Airlines, Air M√©diterran√©e, Myanmar Airways International and Swissair. The aircraft's manufacturer serial number (MSN) is 642 and it first flew on 6 January 1997. The aircraft was delivered to Swissair on 21 January 1997. It is equipped with two CFM International CFM56 engines and has a 220-seat economy-only configuration. In March 2013, it experienced a runway excursion after landing at Lyon‚ÄìSaint-Exup√©ry Airport. On 9 August 2016 the aircraft was ferried at low altitude to Queen Alia International Airport for storage.  Incident  On 2 February 2016, 20 minutes after taking off from Mogadishu, Somalia, at 11:00 local time, en route to Djibouti City, at an altitude of about , an explosion occurred aboard the aircraft, opening a hole in the fuselage behind the R2 door. It was reported that day that the explosion was most likely close to seats 15/16F, abeam the forward wing root and the fuel tanks. There were 74 passengers and 7 crew on board at the time of the incident. Reacting to the explosion, flight attendants moved passengers to the rear of the aircraft. The pilots alerted Mogadishu tower, reporting a pressurisation problem, but did not declare an emergency. The aircraft returned to Aden Adde International Airport and performed an emergency landing. Two injuries were reported, and the burnt body of the suicide bomber fell from the aircraft, landing in the town of Dhiiqaaley near Balad, Somalia; it was found by nearby residents. The flight had been delayed before departure, so at the time of the explosion the aircraft was not yet at cruising altitude and the cabin was not yet fully pressurized. It was thought that a laptop had been rigged with a timer device to explode the bomb mid-flight. According to Mohamed Ibrahim Yassin Olad, the CEO of Daallo Airlines, the suicide bomber and 69 of the 73 other passengers on board were meant to board a Turkish Airlines flight, which was cancelled on the morning of 2 February due to poor weather conditions. This resulted in Daallo Airlines rerouting the passengers to Djibouti, where they would be transferred to a Turkish Airlines flight. The cancellation of the Turkish Airlines flight was confirmed by Yahya Ustun, a spokesman for the company.  Investigation  Somalia's Air Accident Investigation Authority (SAAIA) stated on 3 February that one person was missing from the aircraft once it had returned to Mogadishu and later confirmed that the missing person's body was found near Balad. An investigation into the bombing was carried out by the National Intelligence and Security Agency, with the cooperation of airport authorities and local police. Daallo Airlines, in a statement, said that a technical team of Hermes Airlines, the owner of the aircraft, as well as the aircraft's manufacturer, Airbus, played a role in the active investigation. The FBI also contributed its efforts to the investigation. Initial tests of the damage on Flight 159 confirmed traces of explosive residue. It is thought that a bomb, possibly hidden within a laptop, was carried onto the aircraft by a person in a wheelchair. The passenger was believed to have been transferred into a regular seat after being brought onto the plane. Two passengers on the plane, including one who was sitting in the next seat, were arrested on suspicion of being accomplices. On 6 February, Transport Minister Ali Ahmed Jama confirmed that the explosion was caused by a bomb that \\"was meant to kill all onboard\\". Somali authorities identified the deceased passenger as Abdullahi Abdisalam Borleh, a 55-year-old male from Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland region of Somalia, but did not confirm that he was suspected of being the suicide bomber. Borleh was a teacher at an Islamic school, and said he was going abroad for health reasons, according to Sheikh Mohamed Abdullahi, a mosque imam in Hargeisa. A Somali federal official stated that Borleh had been monitored by security agents, \\"but we had never considered him to be dangerous\\". A senior Somalia immigration official said that Borleh had obtained a Turkish visa to work in Turkey as an adviser for the foreign ministry. A letter was allegedly sent from the Somali Embassy in Ankara to the Turkish Embassy in Mogadishu, asking the Turkish Embassy to facilitate a visa for Borleh to be \\"an adviser to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Investment Promotions\\". The Somali Embassy in Ankara denied sending any such letter. A security camera recording from the airport shows two men, seemingly airport workers, giving a laptop to Borleh. US officials have said that investigators believe the bomber had some type of connection to airline or airport personnel. At least 20 people, including government officials and the two airline employees, were arrested on suspicion of being linked to the attack. A Serbian pilot, Vlatko Vodopivec, criticised the lack of security around the aircraft at the airport, describing the facility as \\"chaotic\\". In an interview with the Associated Press, Vodopivec explained that \\"the security is zero. When we park there, some 20 to 30 people come to the tarmac ... No one has a badge or those yellow vests. They enter and leave the aircraft, and no one knows who is who... They can put anything inside when passengers leave the aircraft.\\" Mohamed Ibrahim Yassin Olad, the CEO of Daallo Airlines, stated that the airline would keep flying to Somalia, despite the incident. \\"We have been there for 25 years,\\" he said. \\"Our efforts to keep Somalia linked to the rest of the world will continue.\\" On 13 February, eleven days after the incident, the Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab, in an email statement, claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it was \\"retribution for the crimes committed by the coalition of Western crusaders and their intelligence agencies against the Muslims of Somalia.\\" Al-Shabaab also said that it targeted Turkish Airlines because Turkey is a NATO state supporting Western operations in Somalia and that they were targeting Western intelligence officials and Turkish NATO soldiers who were on board. Criminal convictions On 30 May 2016, a Somali military court found two men guilty of planning the plot and of being members of al-Shabab and sentenced them to life in prison. One of the two men was a former security official at the airport and the other, who financed the attack, had eluded arrest and was tried in absentia. Eight other airport workers were convicted of aiding the plot, but were not convicted of being members of al-Shabab, and were given prison sentences ranging from six months to four years. They worked a range of jobs at the airport, including security screeners, a police officer, a porter and immigration officers.

It is found in arid parts of North Africa and the Middle East, particularly areas with high salinity. It forms part of the dune stabilisation process. Description Tamarix nilotica is a much-branched shrub or small tree up to high. The twigs are slender and are half-clasped by the tiny, narrow, lanceolate leaves, up to long. The inflorescence is a raceme long, with many small white or pink flowers, each with a short pedicel, five sepals, five petals and five stamens. Distribution and habitat Tamarix nilotica is found in Lebanon, Palestine, Egypt, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya. In the Nile Valley in Egypt, this tree grows beside the river and the irrigation channels. It can form dense thickets in suitable locations. It is also found as part of a salt-tolerant community in saline depressions in the Western Desert, and on coastal dunes where its deep roots are able to extract saline water from the subsoil; it has salt-excreting glands to rid itself of the excess salts that would otherwise accumulate. Ecology At the Moghra oasis, in the Qattara Depression, there is a brackish lake and a Phragmites swamp, and T. nilotica dominates a zone on the edge of the oasis where the vegetation ceases and the surrounding arid plains start. Here it grows in association with Alhagi maurorum, Nitraria retusa Zygophyllum album and Cressa cretica. Uses Tamarix nilotica can help stabilise sand and may form nabkhas as part of the dune forming process. Wind blown sand comes to rest at the foot of the shrub and accumulates, gradually creating a hummock; the shrub's extensive root system continues to extract moisture from the underlying saline substrate and grows at a faster rate than the mound rises. In Egypt, T. nilotica has been used in traditional medicine as an antiseptic, an antipyretic, for alleviating headaches and reducing inflammation. It also has a reputation as an aphrodisiac.

Biography  He was born in Eutaw, Alabama in 1850. Creswell's father was David Creswell, a judge, and his mother was Gertrude Creswell. He was educated at the Greene Springs School in Hale County. After that, Creswell was educated in law. In 1870, he moved from Louisiana to San Francisco. Four year later, Creswell moved to Belmont, Nevada and became admitted to the bar in Nevada. It was then that his career began. Creswell was elected District Attorney of Nye County that same year and his term ended in 1876. On November 7, 1876, Creswell was elected member of the Nevada Senate as a Democrat. He represented Nye County in the Senate and his term started the following day. Creswell served in two regular sessions and his term ended in November 1880. After that, he moved to Lander County and Creswell served as District Attorney of that county from 1880 to 1887. He was candidate for district judge of Nevada, but was not elected. At the end of the 1880s, Creswell moved to San Francisco and continued with practicing law. He was admitted to the bar in California in 1888. In 1890, Creswell was a candidate for City and County Attorney of San Francisco, but he was defeated. During the next elections in 1892, however, he was elected to that office. Creswell served as City and County Attorney between 1893 and 1898. That office entailed membership to the Board of City Hall Commissioners. Back then, the San Francisco City Hall was being constructed and Creswell insisted on the use of materials from California to build the city hall. Creswell resigned in his last term to become a member of the law firm \\"Garber, Creswell & Garber\\", that was founded in 1897. He kept working there until Judge Garber died, after which he worked independently.

In July 1906, he was appointed member of the Police Commission of San Francisco by Mayor Eugene Schmitz, but resigned during his term, in March 1907, to work as a civil lawyer. In 1912, Creswell was a delegate from California to the Democratic National Convention of that year. At the Convention, he was a member of the Credentials Committee as well. Creswell died in San Francisco on December 29, 1914 at the age of 64. He was married to Lucy Crittenden Nesbitt and they got two children, Harry and Gertrude.

He is considered a representative of the generation of the Executed Renaissance. Biography Boychuk was born in Romanivka, then in Austria-Hungary, and currently in Ternopil Oblast of Ukraine. He studied painting under Yulian Pankevych in Lviv, and subsequently in Krak√≥w, Vienna, and Munich. Between 1907 and 1910 he lived in Paris where, in 1909, he founded his own studio- school. The group of Ukrainian artists who studied and worked with him was known as the Boychukists. In 1910, Boychuk returned to Lviv, where he worked as a conservator at the National Museum. In 1911, he travelled to the Russian Empire, but, after World War I started, he was interned there as an Austrian citizen. After the war, Boychuk remained in Kyiv. In 1917, he became one of the founders of the Ukrainian State Academy of Arts, where he taught fresco and mosaic, and in 1920 was a rector. In 1925, he co-founded the Association of Revolutionary Art of Ukraine. At the time, he already performed a number of high-profile monumental works, and formed a school of monumental painters which existed until his death. The school included renowned artists such as his brother Tymofiy Boychuk and Ivan Padalka. Due to the Great Purge, the Association of Revolutionary Art of Ukraine was disestablished, and Boychuk was executed. His wife, Sofiia Nalepinska, also an artist, was executed several months after Boychuk. Works Many of the works by Boychuk, which mainly involved frescoes and mosaics, were destroyed after he was executed. Even his paintings which were kept in museums of Lviv, were destroyed after World War II. The main projects carried out or coordinated by Boychuk and his school‚Äîwhich included his brother Tymofii Boichuk, Ivan Padalka, Vasyl Sedliar, Sofiia Nalepinska, Mykola Kasperovych, Oksana Pavlenko, Antonina Ivanova, Mykola Rokytsky, Kateryna Borodina, Oleksandr Myzin, Kyrylo Hvozdyk, Pavlo Ivanchenko, Serhii Kolos, Okhrym Kravchenko, Hryhorii Dovzhenko, Onufrii Biziukov, Mariia Kotliarevska, Ivan Lypkivsky, Vira Bura-Matsapura, Yaroslava Muzyka, Oleksandr Ruban, Olena Sakhnovska, Manuil Shekhtman, Mariia Trubetska, Kostiantyn Yeleva, and Mariia Yunak‚Äîare an important contribution to Ukrainian and world art. Right after the 1917 October Revolution, Boychuk and a group of students after his direction made frescoes for the Kyiv Theater of Opera and Ballet (1919), the Kharkiv Opera Theater (1921), the Ukrainian SSR's pavilion at the First All-Russian Cottage Industry and Agriculture Exhibition in Moscow, and the Kyiv Co-operative Institute (1923). Later, he switched to the socialist realism style, in which the main works of his group were the Peasant Sanatorium in Odessa (1927‚Äì28) and the Kharkiv Chervonozavodskyi Ukrainian Drama Theater (1933‚Äì35). Some of Boychuk's art works are stored in the National Art Museum of Ukraine.

With a length of of which would pass through Danish, German, Dutch and British waters it would cross and be longer than the world's currently longest submarine power cable, the long NorNed. Specification The interconnector would be capable of transmitting up to 1,400 MW at 525 kV i.e. an annual transmission capacity of 12.3 TWh. It is similar in capacity, completion date and length to the UK‚ÄìNorway North Sea Link. Ownership The project is a cooperation between British National Grid and Danish Energinet. Project status In July 2020, consturction commenced with the construction of an access road at Bicker Fen. Future plans the cable was expected to be operational by the end of 2023, increasing the UK's electricity interconnection level (transmission capacity relative to production capacity) from 6%. COM/2015/082 final: \\"Achieving the 10% electricity interconnection target\\" Text PDF page 2-5. European Commission, 25 February 2015. Archive Mirror Project history In November 2015 Viking Link was put on the EU \\"Projects of Common Interest\\" list, along with the COBRAcable between Jutland and the Netherlands, and the Krieger offshore wind turbine cable to Germany. In January 2017 Viking Link announced a ‚Ç¨1.3 billion tender for seven contracts that detail all aspects of constructing and later maintaining both the land and sea components of the link. In March 2017 Fugro announced the completion of their contract to survey the seabed for the subsea section of the interconnector. According to some experts including National Grid's head of strategy the UK's decision to leave the EU can negatively influence the effort to link the UK power grid with the continent and may put planned interconnectors such as Viking Link on hold. In reaction to the Brexit referendum Viking Link stated that the plans to build and operate the interconnector remain unchanged and that they consider the project unlikely to be influenced since it has a strong business case, while National Grid claims that leaving the internal energy market would jeopardize interconnector projects such as Viking Link. In July 2019 Viking Link announced three contracts totaling ‚Ç¨1.1 billion, one with Siemens for the two onshore substations and two for the manufacture and laying of the undersea cables to be done by Prysmian Powerlink S.r.l. and NKT HV Cables AB. Construction work is scheduled to start mid-2020 and expected to be complete by 2023. In December 2019, contracts were awarded for the UK onshore construction works. In November 2019, it was announced that preparation work had started on the beach in Denmark. In July 2020, Viking Link announced that work had started on the 475 mile interconnector. Economic impact The Viking Link will give the UK access to the west Denmark bidding area (DK1) of Nord Pool Spot. An analysis in 2016 showed a DKK 5.6 billion overall benefit for the society using Viking Link, and a DKK 20 billion benefit for heat pumps in district heating. Combining the two yields a benefit of DKK 22.8 billion. By 2022 prices in Denmark are projected to rise by 15 DKK/MWh, and fall in England. The investment is estimated at 13.4 billion DKK. A new 400kV supporting power line in Denmark is expected to increase internal transmission capacity and reduce overhead power lines from 324 km to 145 km.

Finding inspiration in the natural world and in science, she is fascinated by the vibrational frequencies of natural phenomena, ranging widely from the microscopic (elements, DNA) to the macroscopic (body rhythms, water, stars, time). She has created a microtonal system based on the frequencies of DNA, transforming natural vibrational patterns into sounds to create music. She has collaborated with both scientists and artists, and her compositions have been performed both nationally and internationally. Education Alexjander received a B.A. in English Literature, with teaching credentials, in 1966. She received a master's degree in Theory and Composition from San Jose State University, California in 1982. Although her initial musical training was classical, she became interested in the gamelan and explored Indian classical music, studying and performing with Lou Harrison. Teaching Alexjander has taught at San Jose State and Goddard College and has been an adjunct faculty member of Union Institute in Sacramento, California. She also presents workshops on the physics and metaphysics of sound. She is the Director of Science & The Arts, founded in Aptos, California to investigate the frequencies of the universe and their musical properties. Compositions and collaborations In one of her earliest collaborations, with biologist David W. Deamer from the University of California, Alexjander created music based on movements of the atoms and molecules that make up human DNA. An infrared spectrophotometer was used to measure the wavelength of infrared light absorbed by sections of DNA and to identify frequencies for each DNA molecule. The ratios of the light frequencies were then converted into perceptible ratios of sound frequencies, often involving microtonal changes, to create \\"strange, beautiful music\\". The resulting album Sequencia, a pioneering experiment in sound creation, was recorded on Earth Day, 1990. Its tuning system, a type of Just intonation, is based on the molecular frequencies of the four bases of DNA: adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine.

The other high schools include, Harnett Central, Triton, Overhills, the alternative school and Harnett Early College, located in Dunn, NC. WHHS is located approximately 11 miles southwest of Lillington, the county seat on N.C. Highway 27. The school was officially dedicated in May 1978, along with Harnett Central High School. The mascot for WHHS is the eagle. History Ground was broken for Western Harnett High School in October 1975. Those present at this ceremony were Superintendent R. A. Gray, Harnett County Commissioners, and the three student council presents from the three high schools that would compose Western Harnett: Boone Trail, Benhaven, and Anderson Creek. Construction on Western Harnett took two years. The doors opened for students on September 7, 1977. Ross Lane had been hired by HCS to be the first principal, but before the school year even started he left for another position. Bob Beasley, principal at Angier High School was chosen to be the first principal at Western Harnett High School. He remained as principal until 1987 when he was elevated to the position of Assistant Superintendent of Harnett County Schools. Beasley was followed by Donny Hunter, 1987-1988; G Steve McNeill, 1988-1990; Henry Holt, 1990-1999; David Stewart, 1999-2000; David Pugh, 2000-2001; Jackie Samuels, 2001-2003; Terry Hinson, 2003-2008; William Wright, 2008-2011; Stan Williams, 2011-2013; Chris Pearson 2013-2018; Matthew Price 2018-Present. In 2002, it was entered into U.S. Congressional testimony that Western Harnett had so increased size that 22 trailers were being used to accommodate the large student body. After swelling to more than 1,900 students in 2003-04,http://carolinapreps.com/teams/frontend/teampage/teamDetails/284 Overhills High School was opened to help accommodate the large number of students in the area, which encompassed the Anderson Creek and part of the Benhaven school district. Demographics Western Harnett is ethnically diverse, with about a fifth of the student population of black ethnicity, another fifth of Hispanic ethnicity and just over half of the student population of white ethnicity. About 9 percent of the student population participates in Advance Placement (AP) programs.

According to the book \\"Religion and Women in Britain, c. 1660‚Äì1760\\" she is remembered for her devotion to the Virgin MaryApetrei (2014), p93 and for a series of visions that she experienced throughout her life.Hardman 1937, p.90-109Bedingfeld 1878, p.72-106, p.120-148  Early life and vocation  Margaret Mostyn was one of four sisters and three brothers, born to John Mostyn Esq of Talacre Hall and Anne Fox, daughter of Henry Fox of Hurst. Her youngest brother, Edward Mostyn, became the first baronet of the family in 1670. From an early age, Mostyn was brought up and educated by her grandmother. From as young as six, she is described as showing a spiritual temperament,Hardman 1937, p.4-6 spending long hours gazing at religious pictures and was reported as often being \\"favoured with the visible presence of her angel guardian\\".Bedingfeld 1878, p.18 In her teens, she expressed a desire to follow a monastic vocation, but was dissuaded by her grandmother who asked Margaret to stay and look after her.Hardman 1937, p.5 Following the death of her grandmother, Mostyn returned to live with her mother. After a period of denying her growing sense of vocation, Margaret described experiencing a vision of the Virgin Mary and St. Teresa of Avila, whilst walking in the garden at home.Bedingfeld 1878, p.19 Mostyn reports Mary as saying: \\"My child, if you will be happy, follow your first vocation ‚Äì St. Teresa will help you\\". She entered the religious life, along with her sister Elizabeth (in religion Sister Ursula), around one year later.  Religious life  On account of the anti-Catholic sentiment in England at the time, the sisters opted to join the Carmelite community in Antwerp, Belgium. Following a dangerous and eventful journey via Weymouth and Le Havre,Bedingfeld 1878, p26-30 the two sisters, accompanied by their brother Edward, arrived in Antwerp on 10 August 1644 and were received by the Prioress of the Antwerp Carmel, Reverent Mother Ann of the Ascension. Both Margaret and Ursula were clothed on the feast of St. Lawrence by His Lordship, Gasper Nemius, Bishop of Antwerp. At first, Margaret reportedly found the austerity of the order difficult and prayer challenging and often dull.Bedingfeld 1878, p.33-34 She also developed doubts about the authenticity of her vocation shortly before her solemn profession,Hardman 1937, p.19 but describes a vision of Christ that put her mind at ease over the validity of her decision to join the order.Bedingfeld 1878, p.21 She made her solemn profession on St Clare's day, 12 August 1645. During communion she reported having a vision of Mary \\"inspiring her to become her slave by voluntarily renouncing all satisfaction she might feel in anything she did\\".Hardman 1937, p.22 After four years in Antwerp, Mostyn and 11 other nuns left the Convent on 26 August 1648 and founded a new Carmel in the town of Lierre. Mostyn was unwilling to leave Antwerp at first, but was encouraged by a vision of Mary that told her \\"Lierre was the directed way for her to heaven\\".Bedingfeld 1878, p.53 Following a short period in buildings belonging to the neighbouring Abbey of Bernadine Dames called Nazareth, the community bought their own premises in Lierre and moved in during the summer of 1651. After a period serving as Mistress of Novices, Mostyn was elected as sub-prioress of the community in 1954, three years after the inauguration of the new foundation. A year later, at the third election after the beginning of the Foundation, she was unanimously elected as the Prioress. After the declaration of the result by the local Bishop, it is reported that Mostyn \\"humbly besought his lordship not to confirm the election, alleging many reasons, and want of abilities\\".Bedingfeld 1878, p.180 As Prioress, Mostyn gained a reputation for humility, never shirking any observance, and performing the lowliest of the jobs in the community.Hardman 1937, p.50-51 By explanation, Mostyn noted that \\"it would be a strange thing to see a God become so little and humble and not to strive to imitate Him\\".Bedingfeld 1878, p.184 Mostyn remained as Prioress of the Lierre community for 24 years until her death. She was succeeded by her sister, Ursula.  Visions and condolences  Mostyn described a series of visions she experienced throughout her life, many of which she reported at the request of her confessor at the Carmel, Canon Edmund Bedingfeld.Hardman 1937, p.91 Margaret describes these experiences as being extremely vivid, often lasting many hours.Hardman 1937, 97-108 The majority were of the Virgin Mary, though Margaret also often experienced visions of the Infant Christ, St Teresa and other saints, as well as reporting hearing \\"heavenly music\\".Hardman 1937, p.118Bedingfeld 1878, p.72, 73, 82, 102, 152 Initially Mostyn was concerned that these visions were the result of hallucination or invention, but later in life came to accept them as genuine.Bedingfeld 1878, p.86 Mostyn also wrote of being tormented by demons a number of times, including one haunting lasting some months, and is reported to have born the physical marks of this torment.Bedingfeld 1878, p.170  Death  Mostyn became ill on the feast of St Lawrence, 9 August 1679, and deteriorated in health until her death on 29 August 1679. On her deathbed, she received communion and holy oils, and requested to be buried in the poorest habit in the house.Bedingfeld 1878, p.250 After blessing each member of the community, it is reported that she predicted the hour of her death, counting the hours in the early morning until her death at 07:00.Bedingfeld 1878, p.251 Following her death, many people came to the convent and begged pieces of her habit. A series of miraculous events were reported following her death, including that of the convent being filled with an \\"odoriferous and heavenly fragrance\\" on the first anniversary of her profession.Bedingfeld 1878, p.255 It was also reported her corpse showed no signs of decay following a flooding of the crypt two and a half years after her death.Hardman 1937, p.84 A fellow Carmelite of the same community, Anna Maria of St. Joseph, described being cured following her intercession to Mother Margaret during a grave illness.Hallett 2013, p.172  Notes   References  * Bedingfeld, Edmund. \\"The Life of Margaret Mostyn (Mother Margaret of Jesus): Religious of the Reformed Order of Our Blessed Lady of Mount Carmel, 1625-1679\\".

He is the owner and head guide of Himalayan Rides, a mountain bike tour company that operates advanced level trips primarily in the Mustang region of Nepal.  Mountain bike exploration  Since 2008, Mandil has explored the Himalayas of Nepal seeking to connect the various trails that traverses the region. He sought to develop biking routes in the mountainous Northern region in order to encourage mountain biking tourism in Nepal. He initially started the exploration as a consultant for other Nepalese tour companies and continued this with the formation of Himalayan Rides in 2010. In 2010, he spent 10 months in the remote Mustang district searching for cattle paths that had the potential to be used as riding trails. During this period, he discovered various trails that have since become popular amongst mountain bikers who travel to the region. In April 2011, Mandil along with Australian mountain biker Grant Dansie and Nepalese photographer Gaurav Man Sherchan became the first people to ride downhill from the Kyanjin Valley to Syafru Besi in the Langtang Region of Nepal.  Tour operation  Mandil's tour company Himalayan Rides launched in 2010. The company works on a business-to- business only model focussing solely on ground handling and has partnered with international companies for sales and marketing purposes.

Mountain bike videos  Mandil has ridden in three popular mountain bike videos since 2012. The first video was Himalayan High, a video that showcases a blend of culture and adventure in the Mustang Valley. The video gathered worldwide recognition with over 1 million views through various online platforms. It was a finalist at the UK Adventure Film Festival, selected by Red Bull as one of the Awesome Videos of 2012. and featured on Outside Magazine. The second video Colors of Kathmandu was released in 2013 and was also able to garner attention in the mountain biking media, including a feature on Bike Magazine and popular mountain biking portal Pinkbike. The third video was called Nepal Through My Eyes and was shot completely on a GoPro point-of-view camera over a period of 3 years. The video was reviewed by The Daily Telegraph and mountain biking website Singletracks.  Sponsors / partners  Mandil is sponsored by Canadian mountain bike company Banshee Bikes, Nepalese mountain gear manufacturer Sherpa Adventure Gear, Italian helmet and protection company Met Bluegrass and Canadian component manufacturer Race Face.  Other careers  Prior to becoming a professional mountain biker, Mandil started an event management company called Party Nepal at just 18 years old. Mandil sold the company to his partners in 2008, aged 25 to pursue a full-time career in mountain biking.

It has smooth, grey bark, lance-shaped to elliptic adult leaves, spindle-shaped flower buds in groups of nine to thirteen, white flowers and barrel-shaped to cylindrical fruit.flower buds of subsp. capillosafruit of subsp. capillosa Description Eucalyptus capillosa is a tree or mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, sometimes powdery grey bark with pink or pale orange patches. The leaves on young plants are lance- shaped, glaucous, long and wide. Adult leaves are the same dull green on both sides, linear to elliptic, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of nine, eleven or thirteen on a peduncle long, the individual flowers on pedicels long. The mature buds are spindle- shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum about twice as long as the floral cup and the same width at the join. The flowering period is from December to May and the flowers are white. The fruit is a conical to barrel- shaped capsule long and wide with the valves usually level with the rim. Eucalyptus capillosa is a closely related and very similar to E. wandoo but differs in having hairy seedlings with more leaves arranged in opposite pairs, and adult leaves that are green rather than blue-green or glaucous. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus capillosa was first formally described by the botanists Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper in 1991 from a specimen near Merredin and the description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (capillosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"hairy\\", referring to the hairy seedlings. Brooker and Hopper described two subspecies that have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus capillosa subsp. capillosa is a small to medium-sized tree; * Eucalyptus capillosa subsp. polyclada is a mallee to . The name polyclada is derived from the Ancient Greek words polys meaning \\"many\\" and klados meaning \\"branch\\", \\"twig\\" or \\"stem\\", referring to the mallee habit of this subspecies. Distribution and habitat Wheatbelt wandoo (subspecies capillosa) is found in the central and eastern wheatbelt where it grows in low, open heath, mainly east of Pithara, Kellerberrin, Western Australia and Corrigin.

It is a small shrub with many fine, tangled branches, tiny leaves and purple to lilac-coloured flowers. Description Eremophila homoplastica is a shrub growing to a height of less than with many thin, tangled branches. The leaves are arranged alternately and are pressed against the branches, long, wide, oblong in shape, with a wrinkled, lumpy surface. The leaf attachment is between the leaf and the branch. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a long stalk. There are 5 green, egg-shaped, thick, pointed sepals which are long and covered on both surfaces by short white hairs. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is a shade of lilac or purple, a lighter shade of lilac on the petal lobes and faint spots inside the tube. The outside of the tube and petal lobes have scattered hairs are hairy but the inside of the lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is woolly. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from June to September and is followed by fruits which are fleshy, reddish to blackish- brown, oval-shaped to almost spherical, smooth, shiny and long.Leinster Taxonomy and naming Eremophila homoplastica was first formally described in 1899 by Spencer Le Marchant Moore who gave it the name Pholidia homoplastica. The description was published in Journal of the Linnean Society, Botany. In 1931, Charles Gardner changed its name to Eremophila homoplastica. The specific epithet (homoplastica) is derived from the ancient Greek homo- meaning \\"alike\\" and plasticos meaning \\"fit for moulding\\", possibly alluding to the similarity of habit and leaf form to E. gibbifolia. Distribution and habitat This eremophila grows in a variety of soils usually in mulga woodland. It is widespread between Sandstone and Lake Rason in the Great Victoria Desert and Murchison biogeographic regions. Conservation status Eremophila homoplastica is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This eremophila has not been grown successfully in southern Australia and is rarely grown in gardens elsewhere. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting and grown in well-drained soil in full sun. It is drought tolerant but needs protection from frost.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. The historic district includes 59 properties. It includes, as contributing properties, 40 buildings, one site, one structure, and three objects. There are also 14 buildings that are non-contributing. The district contains both frame and brick structures that are from one to three stories tall. Significant structures were built in the Queen Anne and Italianate styles. Most of the buildings in the historic district were builder/contractor designed. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries local builders H. Quandahl and James McQuarrie are associated with commercial construction. A few buildings, however, were the designs of trained architects. The Holland- Haraldson Block and the Odd Fellows-Erickson Block, were designed respectively by St. Paul, Minnesota architects Omeyer & Thori and J.L. Rood. Rood may have been designed the Index Building as well. The Emery Building was designed by Glenn L. Saxton and Hans Enger, who also had an office in St. Paul. The site is its location adjacent to a bend on the north shore of the Shell Rock River. A staircase pathway that leads to flanking stone piers along the river are the contributing structure and one of the objects. The L.T.

Early life  Ridola was born to Gregorio Ridola and noblewoman Camilla de Gemmis of Terlizzi. In 1865, he graduated in Medicine from the University of Naples Federico II, and then continued his studies in Italy and abroad.  Career  He opened a private practice in his home-town, Matera. In 1872 he discovered a new pediatric disease, called \\"sindrome del Ridola\\", a particular sublingual neoformation. Ridola was mayor of Matera and a provincial councillor for many years. He was nominated for the Council of Matera after the premature death of Michele Torraca in 1906. He was re-elected in 1909, defeating Nicola De Ruggieri. In 1913, at age 72, he was elected Senator at the Parliament of Regno d'Italia. Ridola was a keen archaeologist, making many excavations around Matera and Murge. His discoveries included material dating to the Paleolithic era, in particular in the Grotta dei pipistrelli. He unearthed villages of the Neolithic era, an ancient necropolis and a prosperous stips votiva in Timmari, the neolithic site of Serra d'Alto and some tombs belonging to the Age of metals. In 1911, Ridola donated his discoveries to the State, now conserved in a museum dedicated to his memory, the Museo archelogico nazionale Domenico Ridola. Ridola was a member of the Istituto Archeologico Germanico, of the Accademia Francese di Archeologia, of the Accademia Pontaniana and of the Societ√† Magna Grecia. He was nominated as the inspector of ancient monuments in Matera. Ridola died in 1932 in Matera and is buried in the Cimitero vecchio with his brother Leonardo.

Early life James McNulty was born on January 1, 1890, in Feymore, Creeslough, County Donegal, Ulster, Ireland. James was one of seven children born to Patrick McNulty and Catherine Murray.National Archives of Ireland: 1902 Census Residents of a house 19 in Faymore (Creeslough, Donegal) http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1901/Donegal/Creeslough/Faymore/1172924/Ancestry.com: James McNulty (1890‚Äì1977): http://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/james- mcnulty_208570265 (Note: James' mother is listed as 'Kathleen' but 1901 census has her name as 'Catherine') Emigration to the United States and Apprenticeship James McNulty emigrated to the United States in about 1908 to join family members in Philadelphia, PA. He apprenticed as a stonemason with John B. Kelly Sr., US Olympian and the father of actress, Grace Kelly. They often worked together and became lifelong friends. During his time in Philadelphia, James became interested in Irish politics. In March 1914, McNulty joined the Irish Volunteers and was an active member of the Clan na Gael. He became acquainted with Joseph McGarrity, an important financier for Irish independence, who introduced James to many principal leaders in the cause. Return to Ireland and Easter Rising At the request of John Devoy, the leader of the Clan na Gael, and Tom Clarke, the architect of the Easter Rising, James returned to Ireland in 1915, while recovering from Typhoid fever He served as a company captain, recruiter, organiser, trainer and the Commandant of the Doe Battalion in Donegal County. In February, 1916, in an effort to improve morale and attract new recruits to the Volunteers, James, along with IRB member Daniel Kelly, organised a rally at Doe Castle at Sheephaven Bay, near Creeslough. Patrick Pearse, the spokesman of the Rising, was scheduled to attend, however the planning of the forthcoming events in Dublin prevented him from travelling at that time. Two months later, on Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, during the Easter Rising, Contrary to instructions from Eoin MacNeill, James and Daniel mobilised a group of 33 men in Creeslough and awaited further orders, which never arrived. Due to poor communication and conflicting commands, the group never mobilised. Although similar groups formed throughout the country, the bulk of the fighting was contained within the city limits of Dublin.\\"The Donegal Awakening\\", Liam O'Duibhir, 2009 (Pages 39, 45, 76, 104, 255, 289, 292)\\"Donegal & The Civil War The Untold Story\\", Liam O'Duibhir, 2011 (Pages 42‚Äì44)  Continued Activism and Arrest  McNulty was also a recruiter and member of the local club of the Sinn F√©in political party during this time known as the Irish revolutionary period. Early in 1919, while conducting inspections with the Irish Volunteers, McNulty was shot in the shoulder by Andrew Wilkinson, J.P. (Justice of the Peace) and seriously wounded. Wilkinson had refused to admit McNulty and his group into his home or surrender his weapons. James was initially taken to nearby Carrigart and examined by Dr. McClusky, who ordered for McNulty's immediate transfer to Dublin to have the bullet extracted at the Mater Hospital. He stayed there for an extended amount of time until he was fully recovered. McNulty remained active in the years following the Rising, known as the \\"Irish War of Independence\\". James' knowledge of construction was instrumental with Volunteer attempts to stop the transport of British troops into the region. On 7 February 1921, Volunteers removed a section of the railway line on the train bridge at Drumacart Creeslough. A train carrying British troops was derailed and 15 men were injured, James was consequently arrested on 12 February 1921 by the Royal Irish Constabulary (a.k.a. \\"The Black and Tans\\"). He was interned in Derry Prison \\"Derry Gaol\\", where he remained for the next two years and was scheduled for execution. On 6 December 1921, the same night as the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, James was one of 14 prisoners involved in a failed escape attempt plotted locally by the Derry IRA., in which two prison guards were killed. In 1923, James was brought to trial and released due to never actually being charged with a crime. Disheartened with the terms of the Anglo- Irish Treaty, James soon departed to the United States with his family. Emigration and death In October 1924, after his release from Derry Gaol, James, his wife, Anne (Nelis), whom he married in February, 1917, soon emigrated to the United States with their children, partly to avoid any retaliation from the British.

Main characters ; : :The male protagonist and a student at Taishu High School. His father has a habit of sending him Cursed artifacts to remove the curses within, as their home is in a blessed location, a focal point for positive energy which gradually removes curses, and thus makes him immune to any curses. Due to the fact that his mother was never seen or mentioned in the series and his father is traveling, he developed a talent in cooking and is highly independent. He has a very stubborn but friendly personality, and does not hesitate when it comes to protecting his friends. Haruaki is somewhat aware of all the girls' feelings towards him, but never acts upon taking steps towards a serious relationship with any of them. ; : :The female protagonist, she's actually a Cursed Tool, whose full name is Fear-In-Cube, a torture device that resembles a solid metal cube. Fear-In-Cube has 32 torture capabilities which include an Iron maiden, and a Guillotine among other things. Fear was developed during the height of the Inquisitions, and has caused countless people's agonizing deaths to the point where she risks going homicidally insane upon hearing someone scream in pain. Eventually she developed a curse of her own, causing anyone who owns her to go insane, driving the owner to want to use her to torture people and revel in their pain and screams. Due to her extended time in the depths of a Spanish castle Fear has also developed animosity for spiders, as they would build cobwebs around her original form. Out of disgust at her past, Fear prefers to stay in human form. She regards Haruaki as her owner, and her anxiety is eased by his assurances that her curse can not affect him. Fear's torture abilities are over time neutralized by things called indulgence disks which hare found in other cursed tools. She appears to have a developing crush towards Haruaki but responds to him in a Tsundere type of way when she gets shy. Fear's favorite catchphrase is \\"I'll curse you\\", and has an addiction to rice crackers. ; : :A long resident at the Yachi compound, Konoha is also a Cursed Tool in the true form of a katana. In human form, she still retains her powers of slicing clean through objects, which are her sword characteristics. Her curse towards her owner differs between adaptations but does not play an essential role in the story due to Haruaki's immunity to curses. Konoha's status as a Cursed Tool has almost been lifted, but when she sees blood for an extended period of time a relapse can occur towards a blood-thirsty personality with blue hair and eyes similar to Fear. Konoha tends more though to faint at the sight of blood as a result of hypnosis that was self induced in order to keep her blood lust from overwhelming her. She also wears special glasses to help block her vision of too much blood. Little is known of her history before the start of the story other than she is a childhood friend to Haruaki. He sometimes calls her \\"onee-san\\" (older sister) as he did when they were kids in order to obtain a special favor from her. To the outside world she and Haruaki are related cousins, and she goes to a different classroom than him. She doesn't get along well with Fear whom she refers to as a \\"child\\", and is jealous when she gets too close to Haraki due to Konoha's crush on him. She is also aware that Kirika not only loves but is a rival for him. ; : :Kirika is a classmate of Haruaki, and is also the Student Council Presidentl. She is in possession of two Cursed Tools, one called Ginistrang's Love, and the other The River of Black Strings (or Tragic Black River). Both of these tools give her advantages in battle including the ability to not be killed by a fatal injury, though in exchange they come with terrible effects. She will die if she ever removes Ginistrang's Love which looks like a bdsm-style outfit, as for the other tool she satisfies the curse by using herself as a victim since the bondage suit will heal the injuries that Black River inflicts. Kirika feels disgusted with her body as she did not choose to have these cursed items placed upon her. She is also a reluctant member of a group founded by her older brother that has more than one name depending on the adaptation. This group studies and researches Cursed Tools as the ultimate mysteries to explore. She has a crush on Haruaki, and often competes with him over whose cooking is better during lunch period. He later finds out about her Cursed Tools, and what she must do in order to satisfy the curse of Black River. He isn't bothered by it though, and the trust further strengthens their relationship. Kirika's catchphrase is \\"Absolutely ridiculous!\\" which she uses on more than one occasion. ; : :Kuroe is a Cursed Tool in the form of a doll who has recently returned to Haruaki's house. She is a Japanese doll with extendible hair, and chose the 'e' kanji of her name to give the impression of \\"pretty as a picture\\". Kuroe has a very friendly and calm personality but usually seems emotionless, those that know her well though like Haruaki, can tell if she's feeling a particular emotion. She can freely control her hair like tentacles or hands for many purposes such as moving things or healing others using her life energy. She recharges by running a salon where she cuts peoples hair and then feeds on the residual life energy inherent in the cut hair after closing, partly to keep her life energy up and partly because she finds the hair delicious. Due to the trust and thanks from her customers and fellow shopkeepers she has completely removed her curse. Her original curse was that she would attempt to steal her owners' life energy at night by cutting off bits of their hair, and absorbing it until they died. It is shown that Kuroe finds amusement in her practical jokes and playful flirting towards Haruaki. Taishuu High School ; : :The eccentric superintendent of Taishuu High School who wears a gas mask over his face for unknown reasons. Gabriel constantly spins different stories as to why he wears the mask, but Fear and Shiraho just think he's perverted. Volume 8 of the Light Novels reveals the reason he wears the mask along with the fact that he feels nervous without it after having worn it for so long. He is a busy person, allowed the freedom to do many things besides show up to run the school. Usually he is off on travel and rarely in the office. When first seen in Vol. 2 he had only gotten back to the school at 11:00 am, and had to catch a flight on another trip that afternoon; he would return in a week. His interest is in collecting what he thinks are cursed objects, however he claims that Haruaki's father is far ahead of him in identifying them. He is currently looking for a way to heal and bring back to life a destroyed Cursed Tool due to a past incident with the Draconians. This prompts him to go on numerous trips seeking Cursed Tools but usually getting junk as he can't identify whether something is a Cursed Tool or not. Due to the incident his health is poor so while he can do one strong attack he's completely wiped out and would be unable to do anything other than walk away after the one attack. Zenon and her sister have been his subordinates since before the incident. He is very skilled with throwing things and seems to have a lot of clout and pull with important people in the city. ; : :The superintendent's secretary who manages the office when he is absent. She has a deadpan personality. However, she has a soft spot for cute things, as her cellphone ringtone is a jingle in the series' fictional children's show called \\"Meow Meow Paradise Hell\\". She has a strong interest in cute things, especially outfits, whether for herself or someone else (like Fear or Sovereignty) and tries to hide this from others. Unfortunately for her, her figure and appearance is better suited for mature, serious, business type outfits rather than cute things. She is skilled with throwing knives and was also involved with Gabriel's incident with the Draconians. A running gag involves her letter of resignation. In the first example, after the trunk she had custody of proved empty, Gabriel mused about docking her pay, but since he had a camera handy proposed taking a picture of her smiling instead. She then pulled a Letter of Resignation with intent to use it, and declared that her severance pay could be swinging her fist at him. Gabriel declared he was just joking, and she put the letter back in her pocket. She is aware of the existence of Cursed Tools along with the fact that Konoha, Fear and Sovereignty are Cursed Tools as well as Kirika's and Izoey's involvement with Lab Chief's Nation. ; : :The (incredibly lazy) school nurse of Taishuu High School, who is Zenon's sister. Has developed her own method of fighting that resembles Drunken Mastery which makes it seem she is doing one thing while actually doing the exact opposite such as appearing to be withdrawing while actually attacking and vice versa. Likes to sleep and drink while finding any activity to be too bothersome and tiring. Although when need be she can actually be reliable occasionally such as giving Haruaki a 10,000 Yen bill (about $100 in US,) calling a taxi and giving him Kirika's address after she fainted. Like her sister she is aware of the existence of Cursed Tools along with the fact that Konoha, Fear and Sovereignty are Cursed Tools as well as Kirika's and Izoey's involvement with Lab Chief's Nation. ; : :A former talented performer in a famous theatrical group whose family owns an antique shop. She is lonely and cold-hearted and likens herself to a 'doll', but after Sovereignty addressed her during one of her wanderings in the antique shop she takes a liking to him, asking from the first \\"Can dolls fall in love?\\". In the novel, volume 2, she is first seen at the door of an empty classroom. Haruaki, Konoha and Fear mistake her for Sovereignty, and she chooses to use that mistake to her advantage. She was found out when Haruaki and Fear check her medical form at the school nurse's office. Shiraho was enrolled but never attended classes at Haruaki's high school up until Sovereignty got his/her Killing Organ destroyed. After that, as part of the punishment for all the trouble they caused she has to attend school normally. While her grades are terrible she is a top class actress who can capture an audience's attention with her exceptional performance even if she had no time to prepare or rehearse beforehand. Her personality is still cold from being treated as a doll by her mother to perform on stage, being highly praised for performances she put minimal effort into, and talks like she is a doll and humans are beneath her. Although she has lightened up somewhat and able to talk to Haruaki's group fairly normally, it's still with scathing remarks and treating Haruaki as a miserable excuse for a human whose only value to the world would be dying. She still loves and lives with Sovereignty despite the curse still being present. Even though Sovereignty's curse makes the owner fall in love with him/her she doesn't want to relinquish ownership so her love for Sovereignty won't decrease at all in case some or all of her love for Sovereignty is from the curse. She is one of the few female characters of Haruaki's age group not head over heels in love with him. ; : :Her/his true name is Sovereignty-Perfection-Doll. An androgynous cursed doll (which Shiraho refers to as a male) whose curse causes his/her owner to fall in love with him/her unto death. Is able to appear as a beautiful boy with blue hair and eyes or a cute girl with pink hair and eyes. Sovereignty says the female form can decrease and increase the size of her breasts by having them rubbed, and in the Light Novel used this on self the first time Haruaki and the rest witnessed Sovereignty change from male to female. She/he possesses a killing mechanism called Killing Organ with blades hidden in her/his body, specially designed to activate only when the Killing Organ detects a certain level of love from the owner which activates \\"Last Embrace.\\" Last Embrace is where Sovereignty unwillingly embraces his/her owner while numerous blades pop out to kill the owner. This was because his/her creator had wanted to create the most perfect doll for any owner, (hence the ability to switch genders as some people prefer female dolls and others male dolls for various reasons) but before finishing went insane and included the Killing Organ and blades in order to have the \\"perfect doll\\" bring a conclusive \\"end\\" to the romance between doll and owner. While she/he is able to resist the urge to kill somewhat, it gets harder and harder the more love between the two exists until she/he can't stop the Killing Organ from killing the owner. Sovereignty is able to confuse the Killing Organ somewhat by taking the strong feelings of love from others causing the victims to faint and suffer a condition similar to anemia, although being with or touching the person they love speeds their recovery. Sovereignty also has the ability to control \\"replicas of life\\". This can control anything vaguely humanoid, whether a bent bedframe, Cursed Tool in Human Form (if the Tool cooperates and doesn't resist,) straw dolls, skeleton and anatomical models, puppets, etc. :Konoha used her special ability to destroy the Killing Organ and break all the knives after Fear staged a performance in order to fully draw out all of the knives. Afterwards Sovereignty still loves and lives with Shiraho. Sovereignty is still cursed. As feelings of love accumulate Sovereignty must embrace Shiraho. With the Killing Organ excised it is not fatal, and the curse is sufficiently satisfied that Sovereignty can let go, instead of embracing Shiraho forever. Shiraho calls it a curse to hug. The Superintendent's requirement for Sovereignty is that she must work as the Secretary's (Zenon's) Assistant, doing and wearing what Zenon directs; her first job is to dress as a maid and serve tea treats. In the anime she is a major klutz. In the Light Novels she shows a mix of klutz and poise, tripping and falling on her face while serving tea treats, yet holding onto the tray so that only one cream puff was lost. Because of her job she is obliged to be female on the job and at school. She apparently carries the obligation over to her dealings with Haruaki's household. During a side story with a stalker it seems that while Sovereignty loves Shiraho most, s/he might also be developing feelings for Haruaki as well. ; : :Haruaki's friend and classmate. While not as eccentric as Kana, Taizo gets extremely jealous when he discovers Fear is living with Haruaki. Has a bit of a crush on Konoha and completely unaware of the existence of Cursed Tools. Is one of the judges for Haruaki's and Kirika's lunch battles. ; : :Kana is another classmate of Haruaki. She takes an instant liking to Fear, constantly obsessing over her like she's a cute animal. Kana served as class captain of the dance team for the upcoming sports festival. She is completely unaware of the existence of Cursed Tools much less the fact that Fear and Konoha are Cursed Tools. She is one of the judges for Haruaki's and Kirika's lunch battles. Antagonists ; : :Known as the Balancing Toy, Peavey is a member of the Battlefront Collection Knights. Because of a traumatic childhood experience Peavey became a masochistic, violent woman. In the novels it involved her father bringing home a cursed whip from an antique store. In the anime it involved a serial killer slaughtering her family with a Wathe (later revealed to be Ueno's \\"River of Black Strings\\"). Her only goal in life is to destroy all cursed tools, hence why she joined the Battlefront Collection Knights. Even Mummy Maker states that Peavey has by far the most hatred for Cursed Tools out of anyone in the organization. She has a habit of calling out Bitch and is a heavy smoker. Peavey is eventually captured by Ueno after she attacks Haruaki and company for the second time. She is the principal antagonist of the novel volume 1. Her first weapon is a powerful machine armor for her arms that's similar to a Cursed Tool, but not cursed that greatly increases her arm strength so she can smash concrete with one punch, however, using causes severe damage to her arms in the process. Also, it's extremely heavy causing her to wobble when moving earning her the nickname \\"Balancing Toy.\\" The second weapon after losing an arm and half the armor is a Cursed Tool called \\"Dance Time.\\" It's an Ax that can replicate every swing or blow it's ever made, or make illusions to strike different blows at the same time as the real one. However, it keeps swinging on its own once it starts on its own and requires it to be used to murder someone before its special abilities can be used. In the Light Novels and Anime Peavey only uses it as a last resort but is so sickened mentally using it that she has to pause to throw up a few times. ; aka : :An Auxiliary who often speaks like a machine, Mummy Maker aids Peavey in her missions. She is attired in a bandage, like a mummy, wearing a mantle over it. The bandage is a worst called 'chupacabra bandage' and has wound-closing healing powers, but at the cost of painfully sucking blood from the persons bandaged. Mummy-maker has burns over half her body because her parents had locked her in a closet while setting the house on fire for the insurance money. After being rescued her mother tried to strangle her in the hospital screaming \\"Why didn't you die, now we can't collect on the Insurance!\\" In return for affection Peavey showed her she attempted to convince Haruaki to either turn over Fear to the Battlefront Collection Knights, or to not interfere when Peavey returns to destroy her. This was all to protect Peavey, the first person to ever treat her kindly as most people are sickened or afraid to get near her due to her burns. After being tricked over Amanda's intentions Peavey kills her in a rage, claiming there is no compromise and that she will have revenge. In the Light Novels it's discovered that while on the brink of death, Amanda survived but is broken mentally. ; : :Alice, also known as the \\"Mother of Canonical\\" or \\"Matriarch\\", is the founder of the Vivolio Family, an organization that adores the curses of the Wathe and believes that they were saved by Wathe. And to affirm a Wathe's existence it shouldn't hold back on embracing their curses or any impulses they have, even if it results in death. If a Wathe's curse drives someone mad it should happily drive them mad, if they have urges or hatred they should act on them without holding back even if it means killing or torturing someone to death. In fact, the members embrace this so much that they consider it an honor to sacrifice their lives to Wathe and are even willing to help secure victims according to a Wathe's preferences. Alice originally hoped to talk Kuroe into joining the Vivolio family, but after she discovers Fear in Cube she turns her attention to making Fear join the Vivolio family instead. Alice carries two cursed tools: Carnival Cooker and Suicidal-Beautification-Mirror. The Carnival Cooker, in spite of its name, more closely resembles a combined butcher's knife and meat tenderizer. It can remember any action it has taken and repetitively reenact the process again, in a very rapid succession that almost overwhelms Fear. The Mirror has three uses: the ability to make the user beautiful, render a target immobile and create countless clones of the owner and anything they're carrying (except the mirror.) The drawbacks to using the mirror is that Alice must cut herself on the wrist every once in a while, and the clones only last for 10 minutes from the moment they came into being. The drawback to Carnival Cooker is that since it was used to chop up and cook human bodies, its curse forces the user to want to kill and eat people. Alice often hides Carnival Cooker inside a massive viola, as she claims it would attract too much attention from the police if she walked around with it in the open. She has no conscience as she is the owner of Abyss (true form a large cross,) aka the Patriarch, whose curse completely suppresses the conscience of his owner allowing them to do anything they desire without reservations or guilt. Abyss is first seen at the end of novel volume 3, and of anime episode 12, with a speaking role, and again in cameo during the closing credits. :Another member of the Family is Kururi Nikaidou, a young female juvenile delinquent murderer possessing a knife wathe. She was picked up by Abyss and joined the family off-stage during volume 3 / anime episode 12. She is first seen in volume 4 chapter 2 part 3 & in cameo in anime episode 12. ; : :Math teacher at the school and homeroom teacher of Shiraho's class 7. Also a member of the Laboratory Emirate and Kirika Ueno's partner. He often uses his superior position to torment Ueno by constantly goading and flirting with her, much to her disgust. Most confrontations between the two usually lead to Ueno hitting him or nearly choking him to death with her River of Black Strings. It's later revealed that he is literally obsessed with Kirika and had gained her trust and respect before snapping and doing something terrible to betray that trust and respect. His original mission was to observe and record Haruaki's attempts to dispel the curses on Wathe, and the actions of Haruaki and Konoha in school. He installed a multitude of surveillance devices in Haruaki's and Shiraho's homes. Kirika insists that he disable the ones in Shiraho's home. :Himura possesses a Wathe called \\"He in the Bastille\\" (named after the first person to use it), which is a large helmet that can render the user and one other person imperceptible. Whether it is sight, sound, smell, touch or taste when activated the user isn't detected. However, its curse causes the user to become more and more imperceptible after each use even when not wearing the Wathe. Like their presence or acknowledgement of their existence fades away from everybody's, including the user, perception. So extensive use would cause the user to forget their own existence. In the Light novels it's noted by all the students that he has very little presence at all. As time passes he tries to make Kirika his in various ways such as blackmail and trying to get Haruaki killed without revealing any connections to the deed. :Himura and Ueno work for Kirika Ueno's older brother, who has vainly renamed himself Yamimagari Pakuaki and runs a institute that researches cursed tools. Yamimagari Pakuaki and his assistant Un Izoey are first seen in volume 5 of the novel and in cameo in the closing scenes of anime episode 12. Yamimagari Pakuaki is well aware of Himura exceeding his authority, and in volume 5 changes assignments and reduces Himura's authority. He says that he will assign another worker, partly to replace Kirika and partly to watch Himura. Reception The characters from C3 have received various reviews. In a first impression review, Chris Walden from Japanator stated that he thought that Haruaki has the personality of a \\"wet flannel\\". In conclusion though he stated that with the exception of Haruaki, and Konoha the characters were pretty \\"well fleshed out and interesting\\". Walden cited a lack of explanation of Konoha's cursed past, and Haruaki's boringness as issues, but praised Kirika's character for being well explained. Andy Hanley from UK Anime gave a different take saying that the characters dip in, and out of plot advancement as the story suits without giving the viewer a chance to care about them too much. In a review of episode five from the anime, Josh Tolentino from Japanator said it was strange that Kirika could obtain a personality in less than ten minutes while the series still had two \\"bland\\" main characters.

Plot  Anita is a career woman who works as a manager of the pharmaceutical company Fanelli. Cold and determined, she has decided to sacrifice relationships with others for freedom, work and power: she does not even hesitate to throw the goldfish named Napoleon into the toilet, entrusted to her by a neighbor girl who left for the holidays. Within a day, however, she discovers she is pregnant with her boss Paris, is promoted to an important position, but the next day hastily fired. Convinced that she was fired by Paris because she was pregnant, she meditates revenge with the help of a group of women she meets in the park in front of the company: Olga, former secretary of a medical office that sells medicines, Gianna and Filippa, desperate and unemployed women and finally Enrica, a stressed-out lawyer who takes her dismissal for unjust cause to heart. Also helping her is Biagio, a shy lawyer who is secretly in love with her and who is part of the board of directors of the Fanelli company. Thanks to him, Anita discovers the thefts of money in the company against Paris and tries to exploit the news for her revenge. Thanks to the women and to Biagio, Anita succeeds in her aim and after having fired every other possible candidate as Paris's right-hand man on the board of directors she succeeds with a gimmick in getting Biagio to choose. The two finally convince Paris to confess the theft and the man is fired on the spot. Anita is so austere due to a childhood spent in the complete indifference of her parents, both artists, who finally separated. During the pregnancy Anita and Biagio, chosen by her as a putative father towards the family, get closer and closer until they get married and give the child the name of Dora, like the beloved deceased grandmother of Biagio, who had raised him after disappearance of parents. She shows herself more and more sweet and submissive towards him, even giving up the lawsuit brought by Erica against the pharmaceutical company, because she is convinced that Biagio will take her back as soon as possible. In reality, Biagio is a profiteer with psychiatric problems, who used Anita for his rise to power in the company. Anita can no longer do anything against him because Biagio can blackmail her for having given a slimming product not yet on the market to her friends, in particular to Gianna who felt ill and was hospitalized. Her husband blocks her money in the bank and throws her out of the house with the child. Thanks to Enrica, it turns out that Biagio lied to everyone about his parents, who are actually alive and successful managers and also about his grandmother Dora, who actually never existed. Anita asks Paris for help and it turns out that the dismissal of the woman, which took place months before, was not her will, but it was wanted by the other members of the board of directors who had voted against her: including Biagio. With a ruse, Anita manages to enter the house from the terrace and discovers that Biagio wants to kill Gianna. Together with the other friends, Anita manages to frame Biagio while he is trying to poison her. However, Biagio manages to escape. Months later, the situation is different: sentimentally Anita seems to be linked to Paris, while in the workplace, flanked by Olga as her new secretary and with a goldfish named Waterloo in the office, she was hired back into the company after saving her from the slimming scandal. . Anita is a career woman again. Meanwhile in Paris, Biagio puts his modus operandi into action again with another manager.

The Artist's Vision. He initially painted landscapes, cityscapes and genre scenes. After a few more lessons with Gerson, he went to Munich in 1889, where he studied with the portrait painter Conrad Fehr for two years and was influenced by the Munich School. He returned to Warsaw, but continued to travel, making a major study trip to Italy around 1898. At this time, he began providing drawings for several periodicals in Warsaw, including the famous Tygodnik Ilustrowany, and illustrated works by Ignacy Krasicki. He also exhibited widely, including a showing at the Exposition Universelle (1900). Shortly after, he developed a severe lung ailment and moved to Krak√≥w, making it easier to take convalescent trips to the mountains. During the middle part of the 1900s, he moved about frequently, including stays in Zakopane and Szczawnica. In 1907, he finally decided on Olszanka, where he and his wife Gabriela built a house that became a gathering point for painters and writers. It was there that he concentrated on landscapes and produced some of his best-known works. During World War I, he made numerous drawings of events relating to the German occupation for the Warsaw press. Some of these were issued as Pro memoria. Prusak w Polsce (Prussia in Poland), a series of 20 lithographs that were used as propaganda during the Silesian Uprisings. He died of complications from influenza at the age of fifty-eight.

In 1969 she became the first woman and first African American television news anchor in Colorado, co-anchoring a newscast at KOA-TV (later renamed KCNC-TV) in Denver. In 1980 she was part of the first group of anchors on CNN. She is the winner of many awards, including an Emmy Award, and has been inducted into numerous halls of fame. The Reynelda Muse Television Journalism Scholarship, annually awarded to an African American student majoring in television journalism, was established in her honor by the Colorado Association of Black Journalists. Early life and education She was born Reynelda Ware in Ohio, the daughter of Arthur Allan Ware, originally of Pittsburgh, and Evelyn Cook. She has one sister. She attended Ohio State University, graduating with a bachelor's degree in English in 1968. Career Fresh out of college and newly married to a University of Denver law student, Muse joined KOA-TV (Channel 4) in 1968 as a general assignment reporter. Her hiring represented a commitment to diversity by the station's new owner, General Electric, but her reception in the newsroom was frosty: the first reporter assigned to work with her told her, \\"I have a friend who has been trying to get into broadcasting for a long time, but they told him if he was a black woman he would've gotten hired\\". Muse said, \\"After we went out, he threw all his notes at me and told me to write the story\\". She also felt the other newscasters were \\"protective\\" of her taking on \\"hard news\\" stories. A few months after taking the anchor seat, she decided to assert her identity by wearing an Afro, which was criticized by staff and viewers alike. At one point, she submitted her resignation rather than edit a story that reflected poorly on an employee of one of the station's advertisers. General Electric ordered her rehired immediately. In 1969 she was promoted to co-anchor a 12:00 noon news program with Clyde Davis. Thus she became the first woman and first African American television news anchor in Colorado. In 1974 Muse and Davis were named co- anchors of the key 5:00 pm and 10:00 pm newscasts. In 1980 Muse left Channel 4 to become one of the first 12 anchors on CNN in Atlanta, Georgia. Following rehearsals in May, CNN went on the air on June 1, 1980, with Muse co-anchoring the 8:00 pm broadcast segment with Lou Waters. For the next four years, she commuted between Atlanta and her home and family in Denver. In 1984 Muse returned to Channel 4 to co-anchor the station's new Colorado Evening News program at 6:30 pm with Bill Stuart, a post she filled until November 1997. In addition to her news anchoring and reporting, Muse appeared on public television as the co-host, with Harry Smith, of the weekly interview show Smith & Muse, which debuted on the KRMA-TV public television station in September 1980. She also hosted the American Skyline series exploring \\"cultural events, music and art around the United States\\" for Denver's Pacific Mountain network, and narrated the 1981 Spoonful of Loving documentary series on childhood development for KRMA-TV. For many years, hers was one of the pre- recorded voices greeting and directing passengers on the underground trains at the Denver International Airport. In October 1997 Muse announced her decision to retire from television news; her last newscast was on November 26, 1997. She cited changes in programming at the station, which planned to replace the 6:30 pm news program with the game show Hollywood Squares, as influencing her decision. She added that she had become \\"somewhat disenchanted\\" with television news: > If you look at recent shows, there's a lot more promotional material, > promoting the network shows, promoting this and that. If you look at the > actual story content for hard news, it's going down. It's just not as > satisfying. This bottom-line economy and market we find ourselves in is > perhaps driving these decisions. They're probably cost effective, but I > don't think they're good journalism. After her retirement, Muse took on freelance projects, including doing voice- overs, producing documentaries, and media consulting. Other activities Cherry Creek Arts Festival Muse maintained a close association with the Denver arts community, being the spokesperson for Arts for Colorado and a member of the advisory boards of the Mayor's Commission on the Arts, Culture and Film; the Cherry Creek Arts Festival; the Metro State College Center for the Visual Arts; the Denver International Film Society; and the black theater company Shadow Theatre. She produced a weekly spot for KCNC-TV called \\"City Beats\\" spotlighting the arts. She was also a guest lecturer at the University of Colorado School of Journalism and other schools. Awards and honors Muse won an Emmy Award in 1988 for writing and reporting the documentary Ramses II on KCNC-TV. She received Emmy nominations in 1990, 1993, and 1996. In 1993 she was the first female recipient of the Broadcaster of the Year award from the Colorado Broadcasters Association. She also won the First Amendment Freedom Prize from the Anti-Defamation League. The Colorado Black Journalists Association gave her their Lifetime Achievement Award in 1993. In 1976 the Colorado Press Women named her their annual Woman of Achievement. She was inducted into several halls of fame: the Denver Press Club Hall of Fame (1996), the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame (1997), the Silver Circle of the Heartland Chapter of NATAS (1997), and the Broadcast Pioneers of Colorado Hall of Fame (1999). Fifteen years after her retirement as a news anchor, she was among 75 finalists selected by readers in a Denver Post survey as one of \\"Colorado's most influential women\\". The Reynelda Muse Television Journalism Scholarship was established in her honor in 1998 by the Colorado Association of Black Journalists. The one-year scholarship is awarded annually to an African American student majoring in television journalism at an accredited Colorado college. Personal life Reynelda Muse's first husband was Daniel Muse, a fellow Ohioan and University of Denver Law School graduate who served as Colorado Assistant Attorney General from 1975 to 1979 and Colorado Public Utilities Commissioner from 1979 to 1984. They married in 1969 and divorced in 1991. They have three children. From 1974 to 1987 the family lived in the Schulz-Neef House, an historic home built in 1881 in the Whittier neighborhood of Denver. Muse remarried to Marion Iverson in 1997. Following her retirement from television news, Muse relocated to Gary, Indiana, where Iverson was a professor of labor studies at Indiana University Northwest.

Distribution Tubercuoolithus is so far known only from the Two Medicine Formation in Montana, which is dated to the Campanian. The fossils were found in Teton County, at a locality dated to 80 million years old. Discovery Fossil eggs are very common at the Two Medicine Formation, including the eggs of Troodon and Maiasaura. However, until 2010 no eggs were known from the lower half of that formation. Then, two paleontologists at the University of Montana, Frankie D. Jackson and David J. Varricchio, discovered a fossil egg site at Sevenmile Hill near the base of the formation. These discoveries included Tubercuoolithus, and constituted the oldest fossil eggs known from the Two Medicine. Description Tubercuoolithus is similar to the Mongolian elongatoolithids in that its eggshell is composed of calcite and has two layers, a mammillary layer and a cryptoprismatic layer. However, it has quite distinctive ornamentation; the outer surface of Tubercuoolithus's eggshell is covered with domed nodes, arranged in long wavelike patterns (anastomotuberculate)Carpenter, Kenneth (1999). Eggs, Nests, and Baby Dinosaurs: A Look at Dinosaur Reproduction (Life of the Past), Indiana University Press; . p. 144 or irregular chains (ramotuberculate). The eggshell thickness (including ornamentation) ranges between 831 ¬µm and 1186 ¬µm. The cryptoprismatic layer is roughly three times thicker than the mammillary layer. The pores are thin and straight. Because it is known only from fragments, the size and shape of a complete Tubercuoolithus egg are unknown. Classification It is uncertain which oofamily Tubercuoolithus should be classified in. It is similar in microstructure to Elongatoolithidae, but different in ornamentation. Its ornamentation is similar to that of Montanoolithus.

The work was commissioned by the American Composers Orchestra and was composed in 1989. It was first performed at Carnegie Hall on January 28, 1990, by the flutist Carol Wincenc and the American Composers Orchestra under the conductor Hugh Wolff. The piece is dedicated to Carol Wincenc. Composition The Flute Concerto has a duration of roughly 15 minutes and is composed in one continuous movement. Tower briefly described the piece in the score program notes, writing, \\"The 15-minute work starts with the low register of the flute alone before the orchestra comes. As the flute gets more active, the chamber-size orchestra provides competitive tension which is matched phrase by phrase as the piece heads relentlessly towards to a finale where the \\"music blows wide open\\" (Wincenc) in a virtuosic display of flute scales and arpeggios.\\" =Instrumentation= The work is scored for solo flute and a small orchestra comprising an additional flute (doubling piccolo), oboe, clarinet (doubling bass clarinet), bassoon, trumpet, bass trombone, two percussionists, and strings. Reception The Flute Concerto has been praised by music critics. Reviewing the world premiere, Bernard Holland of The New York Times wrote, \\"It is a one-movement work that makes a musical virtue of its technical cleverness. The flute's natural reticence in big formats is a problem met head on, not simply avoided by separating solo instrument from orchestra.\\" He added: In a later review, Martin Bernheimer of the Financial Times similarly praised \\"the mad coloratura\\" of the piece.

The Wall Street Journal. p. D5. Recording and music The Cherry Thing was recorded at Harder Sound Studios in London and Atlantis Studios in Stockholm. The album contains eight tracks. The two originals are \\"Sudden Moment\\" by Gustafsson and \\"Cashback\\" by Cherry. The nine-minute version of Suicide's \\"Dream Baby Dream\\" \\"is no less ethereal than the original, but far more sinister; Cherry [...] keeps the beautiful melodic core intact, even as she becomes ever more insistent, showing her dominant authority. Her accompanists build a gorgeous wall of atmospheric tension behind her\\". Martina Topley- Bird's \\"Too Tough to Die\\" \\"begins sparsely and slowly before Cherry and Gustafsson enter and begin pushing, [...] Cherry's vocal is emboldened with risk, turning the melody in on itself and ululating against the baritone horn. The rhythm sections answers with syncopated breaks and funk.\\" MF Doom's \\"Accordion\\" and the Stooges' \\"Dirt\\" \\"are sparse, threatening, and poignant, the former tinged with implied violence, and the latter [...] smolders with raw, dark sensuality.\\" Don Cherry's \\"Golden Heart\\" is \\"an otherworldly meld of Middle Eastern modes and textures and a skeletal lyric frame that displays this group's command of diverse musical languages.\\" On Ornette Coleman's \\"What Reason\\", the \\"nearly mournful presentation, with gorgeous jazz singing by Cherry and restrained yet adventurous soloing by Gustafsson and H√•ker Flaten, make the tune drip with longing.\\" Release The album was released on 19 June 2012.

Teoli had been scalped by a cotton-twisting machine at the age of 13, requiring several months of hospitalization. Decades later, a reporter named Paul Cowan revived Teoli's long-forgotten story, generating renewed interest in the history of the strike and prompting discussions on the nature of historical memory.  Biography  Adrienne Pagnette, a French girl working as a doffer. Winchendon, Massachusetts. Lewis Hine 1911. Carmela Teoli (also known as Camella Teoli) was born in Rocca d'Evandro, Italy on July 2, 1897 and grew up in Lawrence, Massachusetts. In A Place at the Table: Struggles for Equality in America by Maria Fleming, Oxford University Press in association with Southern Poverty Law Center (2001), we can read: Most of the workers, including Carmela Teoli and her father, were recent immigrants from Europe . Carmela had one sister and three brothers. In 1911, when she was 13 years old, a recruiter from the American Woolen Company persuaded her father to let her drop out of school and go to work in the mill. To circumvent child labor laws, the recruiter offered to forge a birth certificate for a bribe of $4, showing that Carmela was 14, old enough to work. Working conditions in the Lawrence mills were grim: the hours were long, the air was filled with lint, and workers were not paid a living wage. The average life expectancy for mill workers was 39.6; one third of mill workers died before the age of 25. Teoli went to work as a doffer in the Washington Mill. She had been working for about three weeks when her hair got caught in a machine used to twist cotton into thread, and part of her scalp was torn off. The injury was so severe she had to be hospitalized for seven months. The company paid her medical bills, but did not provide any sick pay. When she returned home in January 1912, the Great Lawrence Textile Strike (also known as the Bread and Roses strike) had just begun. Workers in the Industrial Workers of the World, or \\"Wobblies\\", issued a proclamation demanding \\"the right to live free from slavery and starvation.\\" Teoli joined the strike because, as she explained later, she was not getting enough to eat. That March, socialist organizer Margaret Sanger arranged for a group of workers to testify before the United States House Committee on Rules, which was investigating the causes of the strike. Significantly, first lady Helen Taft attended the hearing. Several workers addressed the committee: Josephine Lis testified about being charged for a dipper of water at work, and Victoria Winiarczyk told of being shortchanged in her weekly pay; but it was the soft- spoken Carmela Teoli whose testimony made the deepest impression on the committee as she matter-of-factly described what had happened to her. After the hearing, President and Mrs. Taft invited her and the other children from Lawrence to lunch at the White House, and the Tafts donated a thousand dollars to the strike relief fund. Teoli's story made national headlines. This latest bout of bad publicity put additional pressure on the mill owners to concede to the workers' demands, and a few days later, on March 13, the strike was settled. In addition to the 27,000 Lawrence workers, nearly all textile workers in New England received raises as a result of the strike. According to the Boston Globe, at least 500,000 people had their standard of living raised. A year later, Massachusetts passed the 1913 Child Labor Bill, which mandated shorter hours for children so that they could attend school, and set minimum ages for dangerous jobs. Teoli went back to work in the mill. She was never promoted, while workers who had not joined the strike were rewarded for their loyalty with better paying jobs.  Posthumous recognition  Camella Teoli Way in 2017 In 1976, a Village Voice reporter named Paul Cowan went to Lawrence to research the strike. Hoping to contact Teoli, he learned from her daughter that she had died a few years earlier. The daughter agreed to be interviewed but asked not to be named; Cowan used the pseudonym \\"Mathilda\\" for her in his article. For years, Mathilda had helped her mother arrange her hair in a bun to cover up a six-inch bald spot. When Cowan asked her about the strike, he was surprised to find that she knew nothing about her mother's role in it: > But Mathilda knew nothing at all about Camella Teoli's political past > nothing about her trip to Washington, nothing about Mrs. Taft's presence, > nothing about the sensational impact her mother had made on America's > conscience. Neither, it turned out, did her brother. The subject had never > been mentioned in her home. Cowan's front-page article in the Village Voice in 1979 helped spark renewed interest in the strike among Lawrence residents, many of whom had been hesitant to discuss it. Since 1986, the city of Lawrence has held an annual Bread and Roses Heritage Festival on Labor Day to commemorate the strike. The story of Teoli and the city's \\"amnesia\\" has also inspired discussion and writings on the subject of historical memory. Camella Teoli Way in downtown Lawrence is named in Teoli's honor. Her grandson, Frank Palumbo, Jr., self- published a book about her titled Through Carmela's Eyes in 2011.

The southern half of the route mostly uses the wide grass verges alongside roads. From Manchester city centre, the route is shared with the Altrincham Line as far as , and then the South Manchester Line as far as . The Airport Line proper starts at a junction just south of St Werburgh's Road stop, where the line leaves the former railway trackbed, and runs off to the south-west. It joins Mauldeth Road, running along the central reservation to stop. It then runs on street along Hardy Lane for a short distance, before crossing onto a tram only viaduct crossing the River Mersey and the Mersey Valley flood plain. Tram running on tracks alongside Simonsway. Between Robinswood Road and Peel Hall. The line then continues on a low embankment to Sale Water Park stop, serving the Sale Water Park; this stop is also near Junction 6 of the M60 motorway and has park and ride facilities. The line then runs parallel to the M60 for a short distance before turning south-west and crossing it on a tram only bridge. After crossing the motorway the line serves stop. Between Northern Moor stop and stop the line runs on a strip of land which was originally reserved for a road scheme.

The total distance between St Werburgh's Road and Manchester Airport is 9 miles (14.5 km). History The line was opened as part of the third phase of the system's development, which also included new lines to East Didsbury, Ashton-under-Lyne, and Rochdale. Construction work for all Phase 3b lines began in March 2011. On the Airport Line, a 580-tonne steel bridge was erected in Wythenshawe over the M56 motorway on 25 November 2012. The Airport Line opened on 3 November 2014, more than one year early, and at a cost of ¬£368 million. Proposed future development =Wythenshawe Loop= The original plans for the line included a loop from Roundthorn tram stop to the existing line at Manchester Airport via Wythenshawe Hospital and Newall Green. The line would have had stops at , and . Although axed in 2005 to control costs, the Wythenshawe Loop remains an aspiration of TfGM. The route could link with HS2 Manchester Interchange. TfGM have submitted a bid for funding to extend the Airport Line to Terminal 2. Services As of January 2018, trams operate from Manchester Airport every 12 minutes, and terminate at in the City Zone. At opening, Airport Line services had terminated at and later due to lack of capacity through the city-centre, which was remedied by the opening of the second city crossing.

Born in Florence, he fled Italy to avoid the Roman Inquisition in 1542. He lectured on the Bible in Strasbourg, Z√ºrich and at the University of Oxford. Vermigli was primarily a professor of the Bible, especially the Old Testament. His lectures on I Corinthians, Romans, Judges, Kings, Genesis, and Lamentations were turned into commentaries. Beginning in 1549, Vermigli became involved in controversy regarding the Eucharist. He published his disputation with Catholics at Oxford University along with a tract on the subject. He later wrote treatises on the Eucharist against Catholics as well as Lutherans. After Vermigli's death, Robert Masson collected the doctrinal passages scattered throughout these commentaries into a systematic theology called the Loci Communes, which became Vermigli's most well-known work. Several of Vermigli's letters and shorter treatises were also published during and after his life. Beginning in 1994, scholars began translating his works into modern English in a series called the Peter Martyr Library. Biblical commentaries alt=Title page of Vermigli's Romans commentary with printer's mark of woman with lamp and staff, text in Latin Vermigli published commentaries on I Corinthians (1551), Romans (1558), and Judges (1561) during his lifetime. He was criticized by his colleagues in Strasbourg for withholding his lectures on books of the Bible for years rather than sending them to be published. Calling his lecture notes on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus and the Minor Prophets \\"brief and hasty annotations\\", he found it difficult to find time to prepare them for publication. His colleagues edited and published some of his remaining works on the Bible after his death: prayers on the Psalms (1564) and commentaries on Kings (1566), Genesis (1569), and Lamentations (1629). Vermigli followed the humanist emphasis on seeking the original meaning of scripture, as opposed to the often fanciful and arbitrary allegorical readings of the medieval exegetical tradition. He occasionally adopted an allegorical reading to interpret the Old Testament as having to do with Christ typologically, but he did not utilize the quadriga method of medieval biblical interpretation, where each passage has four levels of meaning. Vermigli's command of Hebrew, as well as his knowledge of rabbinic literature, surpassed that of most of his contemporaries, including John Calvin, Martin Luther, and Huldrych Zwingli. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" style=\\"margin-right: 0;\\" + Vermigli's biblical commentaries - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Book of Bible ! scope=\\"col\\"  Latin short title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year of first publication ! scope=\\"col\\"  First edition publisher ! scope=\\"col\\"  Notes - ! scope=\\"row\\"  First Corinthians  In selectissimam D.

Iacobus Bodmerus } Major theological and philosophical works alt=Title page of Vermigli's Loci Communes, burning bush in center, text in Latin Vermigli's best known work is the Loci Communes (Latin for \\"commonplaces\\"), a collection of the topical discussions scattered throughout his biblical commentaries. The Loci Communes was compiled by Huguenot minister Robert Masson and first published in 1576, fourteen years after Vermigli's death. Vermigli had apparently expressed a desire to have such a book published, and it was urged along by the suggestion of Theodore Beza. Masson followed the pattern of John Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion to organize it. Fifteen editions of the Loci Communes spread Vermigli's influence among Reformed Protestants. Anthony Marten translated the Loci Communes into English in 1583, with considerable additional excerpts from Vermigli's works. Vermigli published an account of his disputation with Oxford Catholics over the Eucharist in 1549, along with a treatise further explaining his position. The disputation largely dealt with the doctrine of transubstantiation, which Vermigli strongly opposed, but the treatise was able to put forward Vermigli's own Eucharistic theology. Vermigli's Eucharistic views, as expressed in the disputation and treatise, were influential in the changes to the Book of Common Prayer of 1552. Vermigli weighed in again on Eucharistic controversy in England in 1559. His Defense Against Gardiner was in reply to Stephen Gardiner's 1552 and 1554 Confutatio Cavillationum, itself a reply to the late Thomas Cranmer's work. At 821 folio pages, it was the longest work on the subject published during the Reformation period. Vermigli's Eucharistic polemical writing was initially directed against Catholics, but beginning in 1557 he began to involve himself in debates with Lutherans. Many Lutherans during this time argued that Christ's body and blood were physically present in the Eucharist because they are ubiquitous, or everywhere. In 1561, Johannes Brenz published a work defending such a view, and Vermigli's friends convinced him to write a response. The result, the Dialogue on the Two Natures in Christ, was written in the form of a dialogue between Orothetes (\\"Boundary Setter\\"), a defender of the Reformed doctrine that Christ's body is physically located in heaven, and Pantachus (\\"Everywhere\\"), whose speeches are largely taken directly from Brenz's work. Brenz published a response in 1562, to which Vermingli began to prepare a rebuttal, but he died before he was able to complete it. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" style=\\"margin- right: 0;\\" + Vermigli's theological and philosophical works - ! scope=\\"col\\"  English title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Latin short title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year of first publication ! scope=\\"col\\"  First edition publisher ! scope=\\"col\\"  Notes - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Tract and Disputation on the Eucharist  Tractatio de sacramento eucharistiae, habita in universitate Oxoniensi.

It rises on the Shawangunk Ridge, in the town of Wawarsing, and flows southwards through the town of Shawangunk, toward the Shawangunk Kill, itself a major tributary of the Wallkill River. Ultimately it is a part of the Hudson River's watershed. It is best known for Verkeerder Kill Falls, a waterfall located on its headwaters just below its source, on the border between the two towns. The falls are a popular hiking destination along the Long Path, a long-distance hiking trail from New York City to the Capital District that traverses the area. Course The Verkeerder rises as two small streams a short distance apart in the dwarf pine barrens of Sam's Point Preserve atop the Shawangunk Ridge near the southern boundary of the town of Wawarsing. The higher of the two, on the east, has its source at . After flowing roughly south from their respective sources, they converge into the stream's main stem. After another 500 feet, with the stream flowing on a bed of white stone, the Verkeerder Kill Falls Trail, part of the Long Path, fords the stream. Shortly afterwards, it reaches the distinctive cliffs of the Shawangunks and tumbles over Verkeerder Kill Falls, dropping and entering the town of Shawangunk. Below the falls it continues to descend steeply down a wooded gorge, passing some remote houses as it continues to the south. Almost a mile (1.6 km) below the falls, it receives from the northwest its first tributary, the Lake Maratanza outlet brook. After descending another 100 feet (30 m) in its next quarter-mile (), it reaches more gently sloping ground, having dropped in elevation during its first . A half-mile (800 m) further to the south and 150 feet (50 m) below the foot of the ridge, still surrounded by woods, it flows under Indian Springs Road for its first road crossing. From here it veers to the southeast, crossing under two long dead-end roads in its next mile of woodlands with some cleared areas near the stream. The surrounding terrain levels out. alt=A waterfall in a wooded area against striated grayish rock For its next mile, the Verkeerder Kill returns to its southerly heading through unbroken forest. Shortly before reaching a wetland just under in elevation, it turns to the southwest. Half a mile downstream it turns southeast just before receiving its next tributary, the Murrays Pond outlet stream, from the west as well. Shortly afterwards, it begins flowing closely along Sinsabaugh Road, paralleling it as it bends back to the southwest and then southeast again over the next mile. Here the woods begin to be broken by farmland. When the stream reaches the town's Verkeerderkill Park on its west a half-mile below the Murrays Pond tributary confluence, a thin wooded buffer stands between it and open fields on either side. At the southeast corner of the park the stream crosses under New York State Route 52, having descended to . It meanders slightly as the surrounding woodlands increase, then resumes its southern course as it flows under Johns Estate Road. Once again a corridor of trees sheath it through fields as it begins a loop around the small hamlet of Ulsterville, curving south to cross under Burlingham Road (County Route 7), then back to the northeast briefly and then east through woods again to where it crosses under Ulsterville Road. It runs parallel to that street, turning southwest and crossing Seely Road twice, then Pirog Road, before it empties into the Shawangunk Kill just north of the Ulsterville Road bridge, at the Orange County line, south of the hamlet of Pine Bush, above sea level. History If the Iroquois or any of the other Native American tribes in the area had a name for the stream, it was never recorded before European colonization. The first known mention of it is in a 1717 land patent application by Johannes Hardenbergh, in which the stream is referred to as Verkerde Kill. Hardenbergh also notes that it was also known as Pakanasink Creek, a name now used for a tributary that flows into the Shawangunk just downstream of the Verkeerder from the other side, in Orange County. According to Shawangunks historian Marc Fried, the words \\"Verkeerder Kill\\" came from the Dutch for \\"wrong brook\\". Dutch was the first language of Hardenburgh and other settlers who had moved into the Shawangunk Valley since the 1680s. The reason for this name has always been something of a mystery. Since it can also have the sense of \\"perverse\\", he had at first speculated that perhaps the stream had been at flood stage when the first explorers came to it, or someone had fallen into it and inadvertently named it with an ensuing ill-tempered outburst. But then Fried consulted with an expert on the New Netherland era, who told him that if that strongly pejorative meaning had truly been intended, a word more fully conveying that sense like slecht or quaad (spelled kwaad in modern Dutch) would have been used instead. This led him to propose that perhaps the name merely indicated an inaccuracy. \\"Pakanasink\\" had been used since 1684 to refer to the land around the Verkeerder Kill's lowest reaches, where Ulsterville is now, and by extension the Shawangunk Kill was also known during that time as Pakanasink Creek. It was possible that a later group of explorers had reached the area, and originally believed the stream flowing in from the west to be the Pakanasink, only to later learn that that name was already used for the Shawangunk above the confluence. They might, he reasoned, have then begun referring to that western tributary as \\"the wrong brook\\", a name that might well have persisted after the distinction no longer needed to be made. During the 19th century the stream took on a different alternate name, one that persists today, according to Fried. Locals began calling it Kaidy Kill or Cater Kill, finding the full name too challenging. An 1899 map gives both the long and short names for the stream.

The story follows Kira Argounova, a young woman living in the Soviet Union in the 1920s. Her lover Leo Kovalensky develops tuberculosis. To get money for his treatment, Kira has an affair with a Communist official, Andrei Taganov. After recovering from his illness, Leo becomes involved with black market food sales that Andrei is investigating. When Andrei realizes that Kira loves Leo, he helps his rival avoid prosecution, then commits suicide. Leo leaves Kira, who decides to risk her life escaping the country. Rand sold an option for the adaptation to producer Jerome Mayer and wrote a script, but he was unable to stage the play. Upon learning about the script, Russian actress Eugenie Leontovich recommended it to producer George Abbott. He staged the play on Broadway in February 1940. The production was troubled by problems with the script and the cast, including the firing of Leontovich and other actors before the premiere. When the play opened at the Biltmore Theatre, it was a critical and financial failure, and closed in less than a week. It was the last of Rand's plays produced during her lifetime. The script was published in 2014. History Ayn Rand was born in 1905 in Saint Petersburg, then capital of the Russian Empire, to a bourgeois family whose property was expropriated by the Bolshevik government after the 1917 Russian Revolution. Concerned about her safety due to her strong anti-Communist views, Rand's family helped her emigrate to the United States in 1926. She moved to Hollywood, where she obtained a job as a junior screenwriter and also worked on other writing projects. Her play Night of January 16th opened on Broadway in September 1935 and ran until early April 1936. Later that month, her debut novel, We the Living, was published by Macmillan. She drew on her experiences to depict life in the Soviet Union in the 1920s, and expressed her criticisms of the Soviet government and Communist ideology. Shortly after We the Living was published, Rand began negotiations with Broadway producer Jerome Mayer to do a theatrical adaptation. They reached an agreement by July 1936. By January 1937, Rand had completed a script, but Mayer had difficulty casting the production because of the story's anti-Communist content. Without a recognized star in the cast, Mayer's financing fell through. George Abbott produced the play on Broadway. In 1939, Russian-born actress Eugenie Leontovich, who had read We the Living and heard that an adaptation had been written, approached Rand. Like Rand, Leontovich came from a family that suffered after the revolution; the Bolsheviks tortured and killed her three brothers, who served in the anti-Communist White Army. Leontovich asked for a copy of the script, which she sent to her friend George Abbott, a successful Broadway producer. Abbott decided to produce and direct the adaptation; he hired scenic designer Boris Aronson, who was also a Russian immigrant, to create the sets. Rand hoped the theatrical adaptation of her novel would create interest among Hollywood producers in doing a film version. This hope was bolstered when Warner Bros. studio invested in the stage production, which was retitled The Unconquered. Rand had a bad experience with the Broadway production of Night of January 16th because of script changes mandated by the producer, so she insisted on having final approval of any revisions to The Unconquered. The production was quickly troubled as Abbott requested many changes that Rand refused. To facilitate rewrites, Abbott asked experienced playwright S. N. Behrman to work with Rand as a script doctor. Abbott also decided to replace actor John Davis Lodge, who was hired to play Andrei. Although she was much older, Leontovich planned to star as college- aged Kira. Abbott and Rand developed concerns about Leontovich's approach to the role during rehearsals. Rand later described Leontovich's performance as \\"ham all over the place\\", which Rand attributed to Leontovich's background with the Moscow Art Theatre. A preview production opened in Baltimore on December 25, 1939, with Leontovich playing Kira alongside Onslow Stevens as Leo and Dean Jagger as Andrei. Rand's husband, Frank O'Connor, was cast in a minor role as a GPU officer. The opening night was complicated by a last- minute accident when Howard Freeman, who was playing Morozov, fell from the theatre's upper tier and fractured his pelvis. No replacement was ready, so his part was read from the script rather than performed. The Baltimore production closed on December 30. After negative reviews for the preview, Abbott cancelled a Broadway debut planned for January 3, 1940, so he could recast and Rand could make script changes. Rand and Abbott agreed to fire Leontovich. Rand delivered the news so that Abbott did not have to confront his longtime friend. Abbott made several other cast changes, including replacing Stevens with John Emery and replacing Doro Merande with Ellen Hall as Bitiuk. For the Broadway production, Helen Craig took the lead role as Kira. Rand made the updates to the script that Abbott requested, but she had lost confidence in the production. She did not usually drink, but got drunk before the dress rehearsal to \\"cut off any emotional reaction\\" to the \\"disaster\\". A final preview performance was staged on February 12, 1940, as a benefit for the Home for Hebrew Infants, a New York orphanage. The play opened on Broadway the next day at the Biltmore Theatre, but closed after five days following scathing reviews and just six performances. For more than 70 years after its production, the play was unpublished and available only as a typescript stored at the New York Public Library. In 2014, Palgrave Macmillan published a volume with both the final script and an earlier version, edited by Robert Mayhew. Plot In the Russian winter of 1924, Leo Kovalensky returns to his apartment in Petrograd after spending two months in jail. The Soviet government has executed his father and expropriated his family's property, including the apartment building. Leo's lover, Kira Argounova, welcomes him home and moves in with him, despite his status as a suspected counter-revolutionary. A few months later, a panel led by Pavel Syerov questions Kira. They are evaluating the ideological suitability of students at the college where she studies engineering. She admits her bourgeois heritage and refuses to become an informant against Leo. Andrei Taganov, a GPU officer, expels her. After the meeting, Andrei tells Kira that he admires the bravery she showed in defying the panel. He hopes that in a future world everyone can express themselves openly, but until then people like her must suffer. Since she will lose her ration card for being expelled, he offers to get her a job in a railroad office. Kira begs officials in the railroad office to help Leo go to a Crimean sanatorium for treatment of tuberculosis he contracted while in jail. They refuse to help a former aristocrat. Andrei comes to the office with Stepan Timoshenko to confront Andrei's old friend Syerov with evidence that he helps smuggle black market goods. Syerov promises to end his involvement. Kira asks Andrei for his help with Leo. He refuses, but when Kira becomes upset, he kisses her and admits he has been thinking about her since their previous meeting. Kira tells Andrei she loves him, but no one must know of their affair. The second act begins six months later. Syerov is in charge of the railroad office and conspires with another official, Karp Morozov, to divert food shipments for the black market. They arrange for Leo, who has just returned from his treatment in Crimea (secretly funded by Andrei's gifts to Kira), to open a store that will sell the stolen goods. Kira warns Leo that his involvement could lead him to a firing squad. Andrei, who has supported Kira as his mistress, proposes marriage. In response, she suggests they should break up. He tells her it is too late for them to separate, because she has changed his view of life. Timoshenko brings Andrei evidence of Syerov and Morozov's ongoing black market activities. Kira realizes this will implicate Leo as well. She asks Andrei to drop the case, but he refuses. Syerov and Morozov are arrested, but are not charged because they have influence with the local GPU chief. The chief orders Andrei to arrest Leo for a show trial and execution. Andrei is disillusioned by the corruption he has witnessed. When he goes to Leo's home to make the arrest, he discovers that Kira also lives there. In the third act, after Leo's arrest, Kira finds Andrei preparing for a speech to a Communist Party meeting. She declares she is proud that she did what was necessary to save Leo from tuberculosis, and she expresses contempt for the Communist ideology that would have let him die. Andrei says he understands and accepts responsibility for making her suffer. When she leaves, Andrei confronts Syerov and insists that he use his influence to secure Leo's release. When Andrei gives his speech, he deviates from his prepared remarks to speak in favor of freedom and individualism. Andrei commits suicide, and afterwards Kira admits to Leo that she was Andrei's mistress. Leo tells her that he is leaving town with Antonina Pavlovna, Morozov's former mistress, to be her gigolo. Kira says she will also leave to attempt an escape across the border. Leo warns that she will be killed, but she says she has already lost everything that matters, except her human spirit.

The plot in both is about a woman having an affair with a powerful man in order to save another man she loves. Rand acknowledged that similar plots had been used in many previous works of fiction, citing the opera Tosca as an example. She varied from traditional versions of the plot by making the powerful man an idealist who is in love with the woman and unaware of her other lover, rather than a villain who knowingly exploits her. The play significantly streamlines the story: Kira's family is omitted, and the plot begins with her living with Leo. Some of the characterizations are also changed: Leo is more passive, and Andrei is portrayed less sympathetically. Aronson's sets were elaborate and expensive. He designed them to evoke pre- revolutionary Czarist architecture, but with a red color theme to reflect the use of that color by the Communists. A press report described them as \\"massive\\" and \\"decadent\\". The sets were placed on two 18-foot turntables that could be spun around to allow rapid changes between scenes. Reception and legacy The play ran at the Biltmore Theatre for less than a week. The play was a box office failure and received mostly negative reviews. Critics were positive about the acting and Aronson's set design, but strongly negative about the writing and direction. Reviewer Arthur Pollock called the play \\"slow-moving, uninspired soup\\". The New York Times described it as a \\"confusing\\" mixture of \\"sentimental melodrama\\" and political discussion. A syndicated review by Ira Wolfert complained the story had \\"complications ... too numerous to mention\\". A reviewer for The Hollywood Reporter quipped that the play was \\"as interminable as the five-year plan\\". Politically minded reviewers attacked the play from viewpoints across the political spectrum. In the Communist Party USA magazine The New Masses, Alvah Bessie said the play was \\"deadly dull\\" and called Rand \\"a fourth-rate hack\\". More centrist reviewers described the play as unrealistic, even when they sympathized with its message. In the Catholic magazine Commonweal, Philip T. Hartung called the play \\"a confused muddle\\" and recommended the movie Ninotchka as better anti- Soviet entertainment. From the right, New York World-Telegram drama critic Sidney B. Whipple complained the play understated the dangers of Communism. After the play's failure, Rand concluded her script was bad, and it was a mistake to attempt a theatrical adaptation of We the Living; she decided the novel \\"was not proper stage material\\".Rand, Ayn. \\"The Publishing History of \\". Unpublished essay quoted in She thought that Abbot was more suited to comedy than drama, and that his efforts as producer and director had made the play even worse. Biographers of Rand have described the play as \\"a complete failure\\", \\"a resounding flop\\", and a \\"critical fiasco and professional embarrassment\\". Theatre historian William Torbert Leonard described it as a \\"turgid adaptation\\" that \\"failed to enchant even the curious\\". The Unconquered was the last of Rand's plays to be produced in her lifetime, and she did not write any new plays after 1940. She turned her attention to finishing her novel The Fountainhead, which was published in 1943 and became a bestseller. Abbott, who had a long track record on Broadway, was not strongly impacted by the failure of The Unconquered. His next production, the crime drama Goodbye in the Night, written by Jerome Mayer, opened a few weeks later.

Rather than perceiving and encoding single features of a face (nose, eyes, mouth, etc.), we perceive and encode a human face as one holistic unified element.Tanaka, J. W., & Farah, M. J. (2003). The holistic representation of faces. In M. A. Peterson, G. Rhodes, M. A. Peterson, G. Rhodes (Eds.) , Perception of faces, objects, and scenes: Analytic and holistic processes (pp. 53-71).

A., & Rhodes, G. (2003). Perception of faces, objects, and scenes: Analytic and holistic processes. New York, NY, US: Oxford University Press. However, this effect is limited to perceiving upright faces and does not occur when a face is at an unusual angle, such as when faces are upside-down or contorted in phenomena like the Thatcher effect and Pareidolia.McKone, E. (2010). Face and object recognition: How do they differ?. In V. Coltheart, V. Coltheart (Eds.) , Tutorials in visual cognition (pp. 261‚Äì303). New York, NY, US: Psychology Press. Early history In 1879, Galton's researchGalton F. Composite portraits, made by combining those of many different persons into a single, resultant figure. Journal of the Anthropological Institute. 1879;8:132‚Äì144. was some of the first to indicate that the face is ‚Äúthe sum of a multitude of small details, which are viewed in such rapid succession that we seem to perceive them all at a single glance.‚Äù This innate ‚Äúholistic‚Äù perception is one of the main factors that differentiates face recognition from object recognition. To test this and further face superiority research in general, Tanaka and FarahTanaka JW, Farah MJ. Parts and Wholes in Face Recognition. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology. 1993;46A(2):225‚Äì245. conducted a study where they assessed individuals‚Äô ability to recognize facial features holistically. Participants were given an allotment of time to study several faces and then were tested on their ability to recognize one feature of the face. As the researchers predicted, participants were better able to recognize the feature when it was presented with the whole face, rather than when it was presented in isolation. Other studies confirming the holistic processing theory involve the inversion condition, similar to the Thatcher Effect, where inverted, distorted, or disoriented faces are not as easily recognized. Yin's 1969 researchYin RK. Looking at upside-down faces. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General. 1969;81:141‚Äì145. demonstrated this and supported his hypothesis which stated that familiar faces would not be recognized if the face is presented at an inverted state. While most objects in general are difficult to recognize when inverted, Yin exhibited that inverted faces caused a particular impairment in recognition. Similarly, the Thatcher Effect presents a face that is both distorted and upside-down, which individuals typically can't detect until they are presented the same image right-side-up, and are then able to see the obvious contortions. Neuroscience behind face superiority Evidence from neurophysiology studies with humans and monkeys also support face superiority. Neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies in humans shows the effects of holistic face recognition. In particular, when humans are shown normal upright faces, neuroimaging displays higher brain activity and response rates in the middle fusiform gyrus (MFG), and the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) than when shown scrambledKanwisher N, McDermott J, Chun MM.

Face perception: Domain specific, not process specific. Neuron. 2004;44(5):889‚Äì898. Additionally, experiments computing event-related scalp potentials (ERPs) reveal higher brain responses 180ms after presenting the normal face, than in inverted/scrambled conditions.Rossion B, Gauthier I, Tarr MJ, Despland P, Bruyer R, Linotte S, Crommelinck M.

This ‚Äúfeed-forward‚Äù theory states that the part-face information precedes and leads into the whole-face perception. However, the reverse model of this hierarchy states that the perception of the whole face leads to the perception of the parts.Ahissar M, Hochetein S. Perceptual learning.

Prosopagnosia face blindness Prosopagnosia is a \\"selective impairment in the ability to recognize individual faces due to brain damage of the visual cortex.\\"Tanaka, J. W., & Simonyi, D. (2016). The ‚Äúparts and wholes‚Äù of face recognition: a review of the literature. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology (2006), 69(10), 1876‚Äì1889. http://doi.org/10.1080/17470218.2016.1146780 Essentially, this neurological deficit impairs an individuals ability to recognize faces, even faces of those who should be familiar, such as family members. This is the result of damage to the visual cortex. In terms of the holistic view, the inability to recognize faces stems from a failure to integrate the individual face parts into a whole.Busigny T, Joubert S, Felician O, Ceccaldi M, Rossion B. Holistic perception of the individual face is specific and necessary: evidence from an extensive case study of acquired prosopagnosia. Neuropsychologia. 2010;48(14):4057‚Äì92. A study done by Busigny, Joubert, Felician, Ceccaldi, & Rossion (2010) looked at a prosopagnosia patient, GG, in reference to unimpaired control participants in matching/recognition tasks. Participants were either asked to study a whole face and select a part from the studied face presented in isolation, or study an isolated part and then select the same part when presented in a whole face. The researchers hypothesized that holistic interference would be demonstrated in the \\"part-to-whole\\" and \\"whole- to-part\\" conditions relative to the \\"part-to-part\\" and \\"whole-to-whole\\" conditions. These results were confirmed in the control participants, however, patient GG performed equally well in both conditions. The researchers suggest this is due to her recognition of face parts is unaffected by surrounding facial features in encoding or retrieving it from memory. Similar studies have also been conducted to show that prosopagnosia results from an individual's inability to form a holistic facial representation. Sequential lineup superiority effect In criminology, the sequential lineup superiority effect refers to the process presented to eye-witnesses during criminal investigations that has to do with suspect \\"line ups\\". This can include the use of photographs of multiple individuals including a suspect (or absent of one), or a line up with living members in an effort to identify a suspect of a crime.Steblay, N. K., Dysart, J. E., & Wells, G. L. (2011). Seventy-two tests of the sequential lineup superiority effect: A meta-analysis and policy discussion. Psychology, Public Policy, And Law, 17(1), 99-139. doi:10.1037/a0021650 It is used mainly to assist eye-witnesses more accurately decide on an individual within the line up who most represents the suspects description. The Sequential Lineup process includes a system that shows only one suspect (photograph or live person) at a time, and forcing a decision from the witness viewing the lineup. According to the research done by Steblay, Nancy, Dysart, Jennifer, and Wells, Gary L., there were fewer incidents of false identifications when the Sequential Lineup method was used.

The conventional gamma curve was based on the limits of the cathode ray tube (CRT) which allows for a maximum luminance of 100 cd/m2. The first CRT television sets were manufactured in 1934 and the first color CRT television sets were manufactured in 1954. Technical details The dynamic range that can be perceived by the human eye in a single image is around 14 stops. SDR video with a conventional gamma curve and a bit depth of 8-bits per sample has a dynamic range of about 6 stops, assuming a luminance quantisation threshold of 5% is used. (A threshold of 5% is used in the paper (instead of the standard 2% threshold) to allow for the typical display being dimmer than ideal.) Professional SDR video with a bit depth of 10-bits per sample has a dynamic range of about 10 stops. Conventional gamma curves include Rec. 601 and Rec. 709. The linear part of the conventional gamma curve was used to limit camera noise in low light video but is no longer needed with high dynamic range (HDR) cameras. An example of a conventional gamma curve would be Rec. 601: E=\\\\begin{cases} 4.500L & L < 0.018\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1.099 L^{0.45} - 0.099 & L \\\\ge 0.018 \\\\end{cases} Limitations While conventional gamma curves are useful for low light video and are compatible with CRT displays, they have a limited dynamic range. A transfer function that is closer to Weber's law allows for a larger dynamic range, at the same bit depth, than a conventional gamma curve. HDR standards such as Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG) and SMPTE ST 2084 allow for a larger dynamic range by using a different transfer function. HLG is compatible with SDR displays.

It was built to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the first Penton KTM motorcycle. It was inspired by the 175 cc Penton Jackpiner, named for the Michigan Jack Pine Endurance Run. It came with Penton blue plastics and a sticker attached to the front fender bearing John Penton's signature. It was outfitted with √ñhlins Forks and was the first bike with PDS no-linkage rear suspension developed by √ñhlins, and was also one of the first bikes to incorporate a hydraulic clutch. A year later the first production KTM 200 MXC was fitted with Marzocchi 45 forks and the trademark orange plastics. =2000‚Äì2002= The 2000 EXC was upgraded to 43 mm inverted forks with 295 mm of wheel travel. The White Power rear shock and PDS non-linkage suspension combine to provide 300 mm of wheel travel. The 2001 model started to appear with semi-clear fuel tanks, however well into 2002 some continued to be delivered with orange tanks. =2003 - 2011= The 2003 year model 200s were upgraded with White Power USD 48 mm forks increasing wheel travel to 300 mm. Rear wheel travel was also increased to 325 mm. The front axle was enlarged to 26 mm and hubs increased in diameter from 36 to 52 mm front and from 48 to 64 mm rear. The 2004 got a new tank, seat and air box and the new one piece rear fender. In 2005, the seat height was 925 mm and the handlebars were supplied by Renthal. The hydraulic clutch was fitted with a flexible steel hose. A Trip Master digital speedometer was added. The transmission was given a new, wider, more load-resistant 2nd gear and smoother shifting overall. The motor was given a new crank shaft, reconfigured transfer ports and the paper head gasket was replaced with a silicone o-ring. In 2006, the US version of the 200 EXC was rebranded the 200 XC-W. For 2007, the carburetor was changed from 38 to 36 mm and had some internal changes to the suspension. The cdi went to dual position, race & rain mode. The 2008 200s changed from the 125 frame to a bigger frame similar to the 250, swing-arm and shock based on the 250SXF motocrosser and its own new sub-frame. The bike is a featherweight which greatly affects its handling. =2012‚Äì2016= The 2012 200s received a completely revamped frame, a new, lighter, cast aluminum swing arm, a new 7 mm longer PDS rear shock with adjustable rebound and compression settings, the latest WP forks with a wider adjustment range and new settings. The wheels came with CNC-machined hubs, Excel brand rims, zinc/nickel-coated spokes and aluminum spoke nipples. The new bodywork had a slimmer seat, a longer rear fender and a translucent fuel tank. There was a newly redesigned kick-starter. A redesigned air box and filter that can be replaced without the use of tools and a flow-optimised intake flange was between the airbox and the carburetor. The 2013 200s gained electric start. In 2014, the battery and starter were improved. The bike received more resilient seat foam, a new front fender, an altered bottom triple-clamp, a better headlight (using a common H4 bulb) and new handguards. The bike retained the older spring-type clutch providing a lighter lever action than other KTMs. The 2014 was provided with a new master cylinder/reservoir with a smaller diameter piston and new lever for a lighter pull. The 2015 200s received KTM orange paint for the frame, Neken handlebars, black anodized rims, a new MAE speedometer and a new, lighter 3Ah battery. The 2016 front axle was reduced from 26 mm to 22 mm to reduce weight. The bike got another change to the frame, a new skid plate, orange anodized rear sprocket, more orange plastics and a new seat cover. The KTM 200 was discontinued for the 2017 model year.

What is Atman (ƒÅtmana, ‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§® or the Self within Jiva) = The individual Self (ƒÅtmana,‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®) is of the nature of existence (sata ‡§∏‡§§), consciousness(chita ‡§ö‡§ø‡§§) and bliss (ƒÅnanda ‡§Ü‡§®‡§®‡•ç‡§¶) as the supreme Brahman.  A. Brahman as the source of Bliss  Love for self and object world is due to unmanifested Brahman (Creator) within the creation. The bliss of Atman is known yet unknown is explained below.  B. The Dual character of Self (Atman, ƒÅtmana,‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®)  Example of indistinct voice of son in a chorus of Vedic chant explain how the large noise of the senses and the desires appears to drown the little voice of the Self within. Supreme blissful nature of the Self is indistinctly revealed and not revealed. If it is not revealed, no self love is possible. If it is revealed, object-love is not possible (attraction for worldly objects). Duality of Atman is caused by a. ƒÅvarana (‡§Ü‡§µ‡§∞‡§®) the concealing the consciousness form our perception as in deep sleep and b. vik·π£epa (‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•á‡§™) is feeling of body and sense as Self in wake state. This is the cause of delusion and bondage the cause of suffering The cause of the delusion of Reality is due to avidyƒÅ (‡§Ö‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ, ignorance). = 3. Cosmology =  Prakriti (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø) and Brahman (‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®)  Prakriti (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø, prak·πõti, primordial substance) is that in which there is the reflection of Brahman (‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç, brahman) that is pure consciousness and bliss and is composed of sattva (‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ), rajas (‡§∞‡§ú‡§∏‡•ç) and tamas (‡§§‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç) in a state of homogeneity, which works in dual way. When a predominance of cosmic sattva (‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ), overwhelming rajas (‡§∞‡§ú‡§∏‡•ç) and tamas (‡§§‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç), reflects the Universal Brahman (‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç) in itself, that reflected consciousness in the universal sattva(‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ) is Ishvara (‡§à‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞). a. Maya (mƒÅyƒÅ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ) When the element of sattva (‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ) is pure, prak·πõti (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø) is known as mƒÅyƒÅ (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ). The universal sattva(‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ) itself is called mƒÅyƒÅ (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ). The prak·πõti (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø) operates cosmically and reflects the Universal (Brahman ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç) consciousness in it. Maya is under the control of Ishvara (‡§à‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞). b. Avidya (avidyƒÅ (‡§Ö‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ) is impure prak·πõti, being mixed up with rajas (‡§∞‡§ú‡§∏‡•ç) and tamas (‡§§‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç). The jƒ´va ( ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ), which is brahman (‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç) reflected in avidyƒÅ (‡§Ö‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ) is subjected to impure sattva. The jƒ´va ( ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ) is of different grades due to (degrees of) admixture (of rajas (‡§∞‡§ú‡§∏‡•ç) and tamas (‡§§‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç) with sattva (‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ). The avidyƒÅ (‡§Ö‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ, nescience) is the causal body. The avidyƒÅ (‡§Ö‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ) controls the jƒ´va ( ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ), but avidyƒÅ (‡§Ö‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ) is not under the control of the jƒ´va ( ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ) or the individual, while ƒ´≈õvara (‡§à‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞) controls mƒÅyƒÅ (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ). That is the difference between ƒ´≈õvara (‡§à‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞) and jƒ´va ( ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ), God and the individual. When the jƒ´va (‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ) identifies himself with this causal body (ƒÅnandamaya ko≈õa, ‡§Ü‡§®‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§Æ‡§Ø ‡§ï‡•ã‡§∂) in deep sleep it is called prƒÅj√±a (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û). During the dream state is called taijasa (‡§§‡•à‡§ú‡§∏), and in the waking state is called vi≈õva (‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ).  Evolution of s≈´k·π£ma (‡§∏‡•Ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•ç‡§Æ) ≈õarƒ´ra (‡§∂‡§∞‡•Ä‡§∞)  At the command of ƒ´≈õvara (‡§à‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞) from the tamas (‡§§‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç) part of prak·πõti (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø) arose five subtle elements, ether, air, fire, water and earth in sequence. From the sattva (‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ) part of the five subtle elements of prak·πõti (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø) arose in turn the five subtle sensory organs of hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell. A combination of them all (i.e. sattva (‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ) portions of the five subtle elements) arose the organ of inner conception called anta·∏•kara·πáa (‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§É‡§ï‡§∞‡§£). Due to difference of function it is divided into two. manas (‡§Æ‡§®‡§∏‡•ç, mind) is that aspect whose function is doubting and buddhi (‡§¨‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§ø, intellect) is that whose functions are discrimination and determination. From the rajas (‡§∞‡§ú‡§∏‡•ç) part of the five subtle elements of prak·πõti (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø) arose in turn the organs of actions known as the organ of speech, the hands, the feet, and the organs of excretion and generation. From the combination of arajas (‡§∞‡§ú‡§∏‡•ç) part of the five subtle elements of prak·πõti (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø) arose the vital air (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§£). Which has five fold functions, Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana and Vyana. The five sensory organs, the five organs of action, the five vital airs, mind and intellect, all the seventeen together from the subtle body, which is called the s≈´k·π£ma (‡§∏‡•Ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•ç‡§Æ) ≈õarƒ´ra (‡§∂‡§∞‡•Ä‡§∞).

There is a widespread assumption that aged homeless people are rare,Cohen, Carl I., Jay Sokolovsky, and Maureen Crane. \\"Aging, homelessness and the law.\\" In Aging: Caring for Our Elders, pp. 219-235. Springer Netherlands, 2001. but this is not true. Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom show increases in their populations of aging homelessness. Increased Elderly adults who straddle the poverty line are at greater risk of falling into pathways of homelessness. When a homeless person enters their later years, or becomes homeless for the first time in older age, health issues can become difficult to address and compound as age progresses. Research Research in the older homeless population varies in age classification. The experiences that accompany homelessness, especially in the older population, require a lower age cut off point than is typically used for the older housed population. A specific age for which is considered elderly homeless varies in research, however, there is a general consensus that those older homeless that are between the ages of 50 and 65 years are at greater risks. Those between the ages of 50 and 65 are at greater risks because they fall between viable working age and governmental safety nets. This age group typically experiences poor physical health, poor nutrition and severe living conditions that put them in a greater risk category than those who are younger than 50 and older than 65 years of age. Studies consider this age group of the elderly homeless too old to benefit from employment services and too young for social safety net benefits. A University of California study has followed 350 participants in Oakland since 2013. Their conclusions were that the majority had worked in low-paid low- skill occupations. 80% were African American. They were at greater risk of homelessness because they spent over 50% of their income on rent. Most were sicker to begin with and therefore spent more on medication. Once homeless, they died at a rate four to five times what would be expected in the general population, from the same causes as do other people ‚Äì heart disease and cancer ‚Äì but they do so 20 to 30 years earlier. A 2013 report commissioned by the Australian Government found that while general homelessness had increased by 3% since 2011, for those over 55 it had increased by 14%. And this is despite Australia having a comprehensive social safety net. The main reasons were Financial difficulties (22%) Domestic and family violence (15%) Housing crisis (14%). The differences between the housed and homeless living conditions are significant to life expectancy of the older population. Under the conditions of homelessness, it is typical for those 50 and older to resemble similar health conditions to those of a 70 year old housed person. Homelessness has been found to be a factor in dramatically shortening a person's life expectancy. Premature death is most often the result of the combination of acute and chronic medical conditions aggravated by situations of homelessness. The health of the elderly homeless population is often neglected until the severity of an illness requires emergency room treatment. Economic factors create pathways to homelessness for an increasing population of elderly. The elderly homeless face difficulties that compound with age such as lack of a permanent place to receive health care services, medicine, and medical equipment Health factors Older adults who are faced with living on the streets are more at risk for developing chronic and debilitating diseases such as diabetes, heart and related respiratory diseases, and others as a result of premature aging.Sorrell, J. M. (2016). Aging on the street: Homeless older adults in America. Journal Of Psychosocial Nursing And Mental Health Services, 54(9), 25-29. doi:10.3928/02793695-20160817-04 The effects of premature aging can cause older adults who are homeless to have developed earlier illness in their life than they previously would. Often these individuals are saddled with limited or no access to proper healthcare and are faced with a cycle of living on the streets, being institutionalized or even jailed.Sorrell, J. M. (2016). Aging on the street: Homeless older adults in America. Journal Of Psychosocial Nursing And Mental Health Services, 54(9), 25-29. doi:10.3928/02793695-20160817-04 As a result of the fluctuating economy, many older adults are finding themselves at risk of homelessness. A group that was once able to live off of savings, retirements, or pensions are finding it increasingly harder to do so. Individuals aged 50‚Äì64 have little to no savings and as a result of the Great Recession of 2008 many saw a loss in the value of their property.Goldberg, J., Lang, K., & Barrington, V.

The reasons for homelessness can be characterized into three groups: those who lack stable, social relationships and are \\"predisposed to personal vulnerabilities\\", those who lack access to affordable housing, and those who can not afford or receive proper healthcare.Brown, R.

Those who do not have strong familial relationships with kids or other family members and do not have strong friend relationships are more at risk of becoming homelessness than those that do.Brown, R.

Seniors Housing & Care Journal, 21(1), 126-135. Resources in the community To assist with the growing homeless elderly population in the United States there has been several programs initiated. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 2008 began to provide permanent housing for those who were living on the street and showed proof of disability (mental, physical) and an inability to find affordable housing.Brown, R.

Many local and national organizations such as the Hearth Outreach Program (located in Boston), the National Coalition for homelessness, the National Alliance to End Homelessness, and Justice in Aging and others, seek ways to raise money and improve the lives of the elderly living in homelessness.

The same year Wiser showed him in the World Grand Championship for the first time, but the pair were defeated by Midnight Sun. Wiser and Merry Go Boy returned to the World Grand Championship in 1947 and won. They repeated the following year, which was the first time the Celebration was held on its specifically-built Celebration Grounds in Shelbyville. Wiser won his fourth World Grand Championship on Go Boy's Shadow, a son of Merry Go Boy, in 1955. The next year, 1956, he and Go Boy's Shadow won the class again.

Prized high-quality stibnite crystals produced at the mine can be found in museums and private collections around the world. History As recorded in The History of Ichinokawa Mine (1901), antimony was first discovered at Ichinokawa in 1679 by Chikanobu Uemonnojo of the Sogabe family. Chikanobu opened the first mines in the area, which were managed privately until 1841, at which point ownership was assumed by Komatsu Domain. Ownership was transferred to Ishizuchi Prefecture (later Ehime Prefecture) in 1871. It was sold to private owners in 1874. After a decade of strife surrounding ownership claims beginning in 1879, government mediation established mining and ownership rights for a group of private stakeholders in 1889. Due to antimony's use in artillery production, the mine's most prosperous years coincided with the Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, and World War I. The mine went into a long period of decline after World War I. Sumitomo Group assumed ownership after World War II and closed the mine permanently in 1957. While the Ichinokawa area is mostly uninhabited today, during the mine's peak years there were over 4,000 residents and 2,000 structures in the mountain community. Unlike Besshi copper mine in nearby Niihama, little external proof of the Ichinokawa mine's existence remains. The main landmark is the portal of the Senga-k≈ç (\\"deposit of 1,000 loads of ore\\"), which has been sealed off with concrete. The Ichinokawa Community Center, which sits on the grounds of the former Ichinokawa Elementary School and is a short walk from the Senga-k≈ç portal, has a reference room with historical materials related to the mine. Other exhibits can be seen at the Saij≈ç City Local History Museum and the Ehime Prefectural Science Museum. Ichinokawa stibnite Large stibnite crystals produced at Ichinokawa can be found in museums and private collections across the world. Crystals were exhibited at the Kyoto Exhibition (1871) and the 1878 Paris World's Fair, where they were awarded silver medals. A large specimen can be seen in the mineral collections of the Natural History Museum, London. The hammer-and-chisel mining method used at Ichinokawa is one reason that so many high-quality stibnite crystals were extracted.

There, he lived and worked for about 2 years but was not permitted to become a monk. As he rang the bell for prayer one day, the rope broke and after this he was required to leave this monastery. He walked to the nearby Monastery of Saint Anthony in November 1941 where the head of the monastery accepted him. After some years Naguib received the veil of a monk. Subsequently, he became known for his saintly life, silence and asceticism. In particular, he was known for frequently asking, \\"What time is it?\\" to remind people to be careful about every deed as this life is short and we must give an account to God for it. During his life, Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria said of Saint Yustos that \\"he is the living example of the 4th century monks\\". Veneration The feast day of St Yustos is celebrated on 8 Kiahk according to the Coptic Calendar used by the Coptic Church. Throughout the 20th century, this will correspond to 4 December of the Julian Calendar and 17 December of the Gregorian Calendar or the day after on both if the previous year of the Coptic Calendar was a leap year.

Its commander is General Zhao Zongqi and its political commissar is General Wu Shezhou. In May 2016, the PRC raised the rank and status of its western Tibet Military Command to widen its scope for missions and combat preparedness, in a move analysts in Beijing said was aimed in part at fortifying the border with India. The Xinjiang Military Command may also be elevated in the future, the report said. Both commands are under the newly created Western Theater Command, the largest of five newly reorganised military regions of the PLA. The Party-run Global Times reported the change would allow the command ‚Äúto shoulder more combat assignments‚Äù. The Western Theater Command's air forces included the 6th, 33rd, 37th, and 44th Fighter Divisions, 4th Transport Division and the 36th Bomber Division. In 2012 the 109th Aviation Regiment was reorganised as a brigade reporting to the PLAAF's Urumqi Base. It now flies the Shenyang J-11 fighter.

Like other mutation models, the ISM provides a basis for understanding how mutation develops new alleles in DNA sequences. Using allele frequencies, it allows for the calculation of heterozygosity, or genetic diversity, in a finite population and for the estimation of genetic distances between populations of interest. The assumptions of the ISM are that (1) there are an infinite number of sites where mutations can occur, (2) every new mutation occurs at a novel site, and (3) there is no recombination. The term ‚Äòsite‚Äô refers to a single nucleotide base pair. Because every new mutation has to occur at a novel site, there can be no homoplasy, or back-mutation to an allele that previously existed. All identical alleles are identical by descent. The four gamete rule can be applied to the data to ensure that they do not violate the model assumption of no recombination. The mutation rate (\\\\theta) can be estimated as follows, where \\\\mu^* is the number of mutations found within a randomly selected DNA sequence (per generation), N_e is the effective population size. The coefficient is the product of twice the gene copies in individuals of the population; in the case of diploid, biparentally-inherited genes the appropriate coefficient is 4 whereas for uniparental, haploid genes, such as mitochondrial genes, the coefficient would be 2 but applied to the female effective population size which is, for most species, roughly half of N_e. \\\\theta=4N_e\\\\mu^* When considering the length of a DNA sequence, the expected number of mutations is calculated as follows \\\\mu^*=k\\\\mu Where k is the length of a DNA sequence and \\\\mu is the probability a mutation will occur at a site. Watterson developed an estimator for mutation rate that incorporates the number of segregating sites (Watterson's estimator). One way to think of the ISM is in how it applies to genome evolution. To understand the ISM as it applies to genome evolution, we must think of this model as it applies to chromosomes. Chromosomes are made up of sites, which are nucleotides represented by either A, C, G, or T. While individual chromosomes are not infinite, we must think of chromosomes as continuous intervals or continuous circles. Multiple assumptions are applied to understanding the ISM in terms of genome evolution: * k breaks are made in these chromosomes, which leaves 2k free ends available. The 2k free ends will rejoin in a new manner rearranging the set of chromosomes (i.e. reciprocal translocation, fusion, fission, inversion, circularized incision, circularized excision). * No break point is ever used twice. * A set of chromosomes can be duplicated or lost. * DNA that never existed before can be observed in the chromosomes, such as horizontal gene transfer of DNA or viral integration. * If the chromosomes become different enough, evolution can form a new species. * Substitutions that alter a single base pair are individually invisible and substitutions occur at a finite rate per site. * The substitution rate is the same for all sites in a species, but is allowed to vary between species (i.e. no molecular clock is assumed). * Instead of thinking about substitutions themselves, think about the effect of the substitution at each point along the chromosome as a continuous increase in evolutionary distance between the previous version of the genome at that site and the next version of the genome at the corresponding site in the descendant.

History Cashmore was born in England, and emigrated to New South Wales in 1836, working initially for a Mr. Emanuel in George Street, Sydney near The Rocks, then went into business on his own account in the same street. In June 1840 he left Sydney on the Bright Planet for Port Phillip to investigate commercial possibilities in the newly founded town of Melbourne. He returned to Sydney in October on the Water Lily. Cashmore married Elizabeth \\"Betsy\\" Solomon (1821‚Äì1898) in Sydney on 9 December 1840, and later that month boarded the PS Clonmel, bound for Port Phillip. The ship was famously wrecked on 2 January 1841; all survived but their considerable cargo was lost. He, in partnership with Samuel Emmanuel, opened a shop in the first brick building in Melbourne, owned by Alexander Brunton on Elizabeth Street, on the north-east corner of the Collins intersection. Cashmore called it \\"Victoria House\\", but it was better known as \\"Cashmore's Corner\\", and there they also lived before establishing a home at Albert Park, Victoria. From 1844 Cashmore ran the business alone. A newspaper's comment on this advertisement was: \\"We should explain that Cashmore is a real name. If the syllables were transposed it would, of course, be more appropriate, as, like ail true traders, he is tolerably anxious [for a profit]\\" In 1843 Cashmore, Solomon Benjamin and Asher Hymen Hart were, as trustees, allocated an acre (0.40 ha) of land in Melbourne for a Jewish cemetery and the following year, 76 perches (a little under ¬Ω acre or 0.2 ha) for a synagogue. Hart was, in 1841, the founder of the Jewish Congregational Society, with Cashmore its first President.Suzanne D. Rutland The Jews in Australia Cambridge University Press, 2005 p. 20 In 1841 he was elected to the Melbourne City Council (for the Latrobe ward), the first Jew to achieve such a position. He resigned in 1848 for reasons not declared, but apparently distressing for him. He was the first Jewish Justice of the Peace appointed in the colony. He was appointed Justice of the Peace and Police Magistrate, again the first Jew. He was appointed Inspector of the Elizabeth Street Meat Market for the City Council of Melbourne sometime before May 1874, also associated with the Central Board of Health. He retired from business around the same time, and the building was taken over by William Alston, a tobacconist, who rebuilt the premises, and gradually \\"Cashmore's Corner\\" got to be called \\"Alston's Corner\\". Alston purchased the adjoining block on Collins Street and enlarged the building yet again, and in 1912 purchased the corner block from the Brunton estate. He was a leading spokesman for Jewish faith, who felt snubbed when omitted from an 1854 grant to churches. In 1855 he was a member of a committee formed to establish a Jews' seminary. He was president of the Jewish Mutual Aid Society. In February 1886 he was compelled to cease work due to ill health, and was granted leave with full pay for twelve months. He died six months later, leaving a widow and eight grown up children. Other interests He was a director and major shareholder in the Melbourne Gas and Coke Company. He was also a promoter and director of the National Bank of Australasia. He was connected with a number of societies and charitable institutions, and a longtime member and past master of the Lodge Of Australia Felix (founded 1939 in Melbourne). Family Michael Cashmore (7 March 1815 ‚Äì 17 October 1886) married Elizabeth \\"Betsy\\" Solomon (14 June 1821 ‚Äì 9 February 1898) in Sydney on 9 December 1840. mis-reported as \\"Solomons\\" Betsy was a half-sister of Emanuel Solomon MLC (1800‚Äì1873) and Vaiben Solomon (1802‚Äì1860).

Due to insights given by her and her colleagues' work, Chroococcidiopsis is considered as a model genus when studying the current or past habitability of Mars (see for example ). She and her colleagues also suggested that Chrooccoccidiopsis could be used in manned missions on Mars for the production of resources for astronauts.

Balser, together with co-director Jack Stokes, are best known as the animation directors for the 1968 film, Yellow Submarine, which was inspired by the music of the Beatles. He also directed the animated \\"Den\\" sequence of the 1981 film, Heavy Metal. Early life Balser was born on March 25, 1927 in Rochester, New York. He moved to Los Angeles with his parents, where he attended high school and enrolled in classes at the Chouinard Art Institute. He served in the United States Navy's Office of Strategic Services (O.S.S.) Office of Research and Inventions in New York City from 1945 to 1946 during the eve of World War II. Following the war, Balser, using the G.I. Bill, studied at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he majored in advertising art and earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1950. During his senior year at UCLA, Balser signed up for his final required course, an animation class taught by Bill Shull, an animator for the Walt Disney Company, which sparked his interest in a career in animation. He decided to take additional animation classes and created three films as part of his course work: Old King Cole, Richard Corey, and I Like to See It Lap the Miles. His three films were later released by the theater arts department of the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. Career Balser's career spanned more than five decades. He began as a freelance animator, working on television commercials and documentaries. He worked as a layout artist for Norman Wright Productions during the 1950s. Balser also worked under Saul Bass, a graphic designer, to help create Bass' seven minute animated title sequence for the film, Around the World in 80 Days, released in 1956. In 1959, Balser and his wife left Los Angeles for a six month work sabbatical. They purchased two one-way tickets for the SS Maasdam ocean liner from New York City to Le Havre, France. While in Europe, the Balsers obtained press passes to the Cannes, Moscow, and the Venice Film Festivals, where they wrote film reviews for Film Quarterly, a UCLA film journal. The couple ran out of income after five months, but Balser was offered a job with Laterna Films in Copenhagen, Denmark. He relocated to Finland one year later, where he founded the animation department at the now-defunct Fennada-Filmi. Several of Balser's films at Fennada-Filmi won awards. He traveled to West Germany and Italy before returning to Copenhagen. In 1964, Balser directed El Sombrero, an animated short film written by Alan Shean, for Estudios Moro, a Spanish production company. He is perhaps best known for his work on the 1968 British animated film, Yellow Submarine, which was Balser's first feature film. Balser, who was one of the only American animators to be hired for the film, served as the animation director of Yellow Submarine with Jack Stokes. Balser and Stokes oversaw a staff of more than 100 artists and animators, who hand- drew the film's animation over the course of eleven months. They also co- directed and created the storyboards for the animated sequences of the film. The total budget for the Yellow Submarine was less than one million dollars. Following the success of Yellow Submarine, Balser founded a production company, Pegbar Productions, headquartered in Barcelona, Spain, where he produced animated television shows and films. Balser produced ABC's The Jackson 5ive, a Saturday morning cartoon which aired for one season from 1971 to 1972; the 1979 animated television movie The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the BBC's children's series Barney, as well as several episodes of The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show, which aired on CBS during the mid-1980s. He also directed more than 175 television commercials and documentaries, which were aired throughout Europe, as well as countries as far away from Barcelona as Iran. Balser served on the board of directors for the International Animated Film Association (ASIFA) from 1978 to 1994, and helped to establish ASIFA-Spain in 1980. In 1986, Balser and his wife, Cima, joined with four other couples to establish the Benjamin Franklin International School in Barcelona. Their school now has more than 500 students, as of 2016. In 1993, Balser closed Pegbar Productions, his production company in Barcelona. He then directed The Triplets, a Catalan animated series for Cromosoma Productions. Balser left Spain in 1996. Next, Balser lived in Cairo, Egypt, for several months, where he worked as an animation consultant for the International Executive Service Corporation. He then moved to Ankara, Turkey, for two years, where he directed television series that aired in Germany and the United States.  Personal life  Balser met his wife, Cima, while attending UCLA. Bob and Cima Balser married on June 25, 1950, just one week after graduating from UCLA. In 1999, Robert and Balser retired to Marina del Rey, California, a coastal suburb of Los Angeles. He became a consultant and lecturer. Balser also served on the \\"Short films and Animation Feature Branch\\" of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and remained an active member of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA).  Death  Balser was hospitalized for respiratory failure during mid-December 2015. He died from complications of respiratory failure at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, on January 4, 2016, at the age of 88. Balser was survived by his wife of 65 years, Cima Balser, and their son, Trevel. His memorial service was held at the Marina City Club in Marina del Rey, California, on January 16, 2016.

After serving for a year aboard the USS Texas he entered flight training in Pensacola Naval Air Station in 1931 and won his Naval Aviator wings in January 1932. He was assigned to Scouting Squadron 3 aboard the aircraft carrier USS Lexington (CV-2) for the next three years. He subsequently served a two-year tour at Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida as a flight instructor. While at Pensacola, he married Marjorie Drake Kelsey, the widow of Lieutenant (j.g.) James Kelsey, a 1931 graduate of the US Naval Academy. In June 1937, Lieutenant (jg) Massey reported to Observation Squadron 3 aboard the battleship USS New Mexico (BB-40), whose home port was Long Beach, California. In August 1937, he was promoted to lieutenant. In January 1940, Observation Squadron Three was transferred to the USS Idaho (BB-42), where he stayed until July 1940, when he was sent to Naval Air Station, Pensacola. In October 1941, he was reassigned to the USS Enterprise (CV-6) as the Executive Officer of Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6), the post he held at the time the United States was attacked by Japan in December 1941. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander in January 1942. His sole combat mission from Enterprise occurred on February 1, 1942, during the Marshalls-Gilberts raids, when he led VT-6's Second Division in the first airborne torpedo attack in U.S. Naval history. His nine TBD torpedo bombers attacked Japanese shipping at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, with Massey personally sinking the 18,000-ton Japanese transport Bordeaux Maru. For this action, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Midway On April 14, 1942, he took command of Torpedo Squadron Three (VT-3), a Saratoga squadron then based at Kaneohe Naval Air Station. On May 27, 1942, VT-3 was transferred to USS Yorktown following the Battle of the Coral Sea, replacing that ship's own Torpedo Squadron 5 (VT-5). The USS Yorktown sailed with VT-3 for Midway Island and entered battle on June 4, 1942. During this crucial encounter, Massey was killed while leading his squadron in a low-level attack against the Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry≈´. Despite being escorted by six F4F Wildcat fighters led by Lieutenant Commander John Thach, ten out of VT-3's twelve TBD's were lost. For his heroism in pursuing the attack on Hiryu, Massey was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. In memory of his actions at the Battle of Midway, the U.S. Navy christened the destroyer USS Massey (DD-778) on August 19, 1944, with his widow Marjorie Massey christening the ship. In addition to his widow, he was survived by two sons, Lance Bradford Massey and Walter Drake Massey, both whom graduated from the Severn School. Lance B. Massey graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958 and retired as a Commander in 1984.

His last name is sometimes recorded as \\"Bossart\\" or \\"Bussart\\". Biography Busserts octagonal spire on Aarhus Cathedral Bussert's family ties are not known but he was married to daughter of Hans Mikkelsen, mayor of Malm√∏. When King Christian II was forced from the throne and exiled Hans Mikkelsen stayed loyal and followed the king. Bussert who lived in Copenhagen from 1523 instead pledged his loyalty to Frederik I who secured Bussert's house in the city. The majority of the property of Bussert's in-laws was confiscated. In 1529 the king gave Bussert Slangerup Kloster for life and Bussert remained loyal to his king through the tumultuous reign. During the siege of Copenhagen in 1535‚Äì36 he joined the political party seeking a settlement with Christian III. Bussert attempted to have the confiscated property returned with little success but was granted the right to manage some of it by Christian III. Bussert is mentioned for the last time on 2 December 1552 and may have died during the plague in Copenhagen in 1553. Slangerup Kloster was given to Bussert's son that year. Royal Master Builder Bussert was the Royal Master Builder from the early 1520s and must have worked on some royal projects but his name can only be connected to some works on Copenhagen Castle and buildings connected to it, the new Aalborghus, a spire for Aarhus Cathedral and the drawing for the fortress at Krempe with Jacob Binck in 1550. Some works during this period may have been mistakenly attributed to Bussert. The type of Manor House said to usher in a breakthrough in renaissance architecture in Denmark, such as Hesselagerg√•rd, was thought to be works by Bussert but today it is believed Jacob Brinck may be the true architect. Bussert and Brinck worked together on the fortress at Krempe so a partnership is not improbable. Sculptor Bussert is mentioned in early documents as a sculptor. The National Museum of Denmark contains a stone from the Copenhagen castle with a relief of Christian IIs queen Elisabeth from before 1523 is thought to be the work of a young Martin Bussert.

The bridge crosses a gorge near the creek's mouth, about south of Depoe Bay in Lincoln County. Built in 1927, the bridge originally carried U.S. Route 101 (the Oregon Coast Highway) over the creek. After a stretch of the highway was relocated to make it straighter, the abandoned piece of the old highway became Otter Crest Loop Road, a bypass west of the new highway. Designed by Conde McCullough, the arch bridge is long. McCullough, the state bridge engineer from 1919 to 1936, designed many bridges along the Oregon Coast Highway, which extended north‚Äìsouth from Washington to California. Jones was a lawyer who helped establish Lincoln County in 1893, who served as mayor of the Oregon cities of Toledo and Newport, and who introduced legislation at the state level that led to construction of the coast highway. The Oregon Department of Transportation repaired and reconstructed parts of the deteriorating bridge in 2001 and added safety features. The Oregon State Historic Preservation Office assisted with the project, and the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

The show is about supernatural love story of fictional characters Aparajita Gosh and Malay Mittal. Plot Aparajita is born as a Vishkanya, a venomous girl, whose body including her bodily fluids is poisonous which could prove fatal to anyone on contact. Initially she was not aware of the fact that she is a poisonous girl or that she was used as a pawn to destroy Mittal's family by her maternal aunt (Kalpana Ghosh) who she thought was her mother. Her mother kept her locked in her room since she was a little girl, avoiding any contact with the outsiders. This ignited curiosity from her neighbors, especially Malay. The first time she was allowed out was for a party in Mittal's mansion where she met Malay for the first time. Malay was instantly smitten by her beauty and delicate grace despite her mysterious aura. Due to some series of event, Aparajita beguns to question her true identity. She demanded answers from her mother about the unexplained facts such as her skin turning into bright blue whenever she felt conflict. Kalpana revealed that she is indeed a descendant of Vishkanya. For generations, daughters in her family were used as a weapon to destroy kingdoms and cities. Kalpana urges her to kill each and every member of Mittal's family, especially Malay to hurt his mother. Years ago, Malay's father married Kalpana despite having another wife, Malay's mother. Enraged, Malay's mother gun-hired a man to kill Kalpana but he mistakenly harms Kalpana's sister and Aparajita's mother causing Malay's father and Aparajita's mother to be paralyzed. Kalpana swore revenge on Nandhita Mittal by planning to make Malay fall in love with Aparajita and then dispose of him later. Aparajita was disturbed by the fact but she could not find in her heart to do as her mother asked and distanced herself from him. Malay, however, kept relentlessly pursuing her without knowing the reason. Against all the odds, they both fell for each other, but Malay's mother plotted many evil schemes to separate them. In the end, Malay reluctantly marries Vardaan due to some misunderstanding caused by his mother and under the influence of the rest of his family. In the sequences of the story, Malay had a change of heart and begins to love Vardaan much to Aparajita's dismay as he instantly breaks up with her after that. By some tricks she had up her sleeves and with Kalpana's aid, Aparajita (Appu) managed to marry Malay but at this point he does not love her anymore and still remains unaware of her supernatural identity. Vardaan divorces Malay under the influence of Appu, and Malay is then forced to marry Appu but Vardaan saves Apu's life and Appu let's Vardaan and Malay to be together. Apu tells her about her supernatural identity. Just before Malay and Vardaan's wedding, Kasturi (Assistant of Black Shadow, the head of all evil) come to kill Appu but Vardaan comes in the way and then Appu kills Kasturi. Vardaan makes Appu promise to take care of Malay after her and she passes out. The show takes a 3-month leap and introduce Mandira, Nandita Mittal's sister who is killed by the Black Shadow. The Black Shadow takes Mandira's form and comes to Mittal Mansion where she kills Chiki, Avi Mittal's fiancee. Black Shadow (who is made up of smoke) calls her another assistant, Yakshini who is the embodiment of lust. Yakshini comes to Mittal Mansion as Laila which is soon to marry Avi. Appu find them suspicious and she manages to burn Yakshini's house i.e. tree. (It is believed that a Yakshini's powers are in it house) and then Black Shadow kidnaps Kalpana and orders Apu to get intimate with Malay as Appu's offspring will free the Black Shadow from old- age curse and will give it powers. Malay heard them talking and Malay and Appu pretend that they got intimate and fake Malay's death (as getting intimate with a Vishkanya results in death). Appu tells Black Shadow to let her meet her aunt and she agreed. There, Appu kills Black Shadow and she decides to go to Himalayas and spend her life there. Malay realises his love for Appu and stops her. Then Baba (Priest) comes with a rabbit and orders Appu to kill it. Appu scratches it but nothing happens, then Baba tells her that Goddess has taken her venom out of her body in return to Black Shadow's death and now she can live in peace. Appu and Malay get married and they live together, happily.

Brewer is also a practicing attorney in Columbia, South Carolina. He has released three studio albums through Illect Recordings ‚Äì Simple Moves (2003), Curb Appeal (2007), and Prince with a Thousand Enemies with DJ Kurfu (2011) ‚Äì and two studio albums, Qoheleth with Beat Rabbi (2010) and The Last Unicorn with Sir Chamberlain (2015), independently. Brewer, originally under the moniker ipoetlaurate and later The Press Junket, runs a blog for which he writes articles and composes songs discussing current social and political events. He released three compilation albums containing these songs in 2011, 2012, and 2013. Early life and legal career Brewer was born Daniel Josev Brewer, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and grew up in the cities of Baltimore and Washington, D.C. before going on to earn his baccalaureate from Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. His Juris Doctor degree was earned at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, South Carolina, and he was admitted to the bar association in 2001. Described by the Houston Chronicle as \\"lawyer by day, rapper by night\\", Brewer practices law in Columbia, South Carolina and is a licensed federal attorney. He specializes in defending companies involved in commercial litigation, a profession which he jokingly has described as regularly ensuring \\"that companies can discriminate, steal, and maim with impunity\\". Music career His music career began in 1993, with a demoed mixtape produced by DJ Dove, formerly of Gospel Gangstaz. He founded the hip hop group The Pride with Manchild and Recon. In 1997, at a hip-hop conference called Cruvention, the three subsequently co-founded Deepspace5 with Listener and Sev Statik, and released an EP. They later would be joined by DJ Dust, Freddie Bruno, Playdough, Beat Rabbi, Illtripp, DJ Manwell, and Sivion. The group released its first studio album, The Night We Called It a Day, in 2002. This was followed up by Unique, Just Like Everyone Else in 2005, Deepspace5oul with Beat Rabbi and Bakesale in 2008, and The Future Ain't What It Used to Be in 2010. Brewer has released three solo studio albums. The first, Simple Moves, came out on July 8, 2003, through Illect Recordings. The subsequent studio album, Curb Appeal, was released on December 12, 2006, also through Illect Recordings. He collaborated with Beat Rabbi for his third release, Qoheleth, in 2010, an released the album independently. A fourth album, Prince with a Thousand Enemies, a collaboration with DJ Kurfu, was released through Illect on June 21, 2011. On December 28, 2015, on Bandcamp, Brewer released The Last Unicorn, a collaboration with the producer Sir Chamberlain. Dubbed an \\"evolving play\\" and \\"living play,\\" additional songs were added to the recording after the initial release date. Brewer also creates what the Houston Chronicle described as \\"audible essays\\" and he calls song-blogs, songs for which he will write content based on various societal issues discussed in the news. Each song typically requires between two and four hours for him to craft, record, and upload to his dedicated website. In a TEDx Talk in 2012 at Greenville, South Carolina, outlined his recording process for this project and explained that this approach allows him to react much more spontaneously to current events, bypassing the several month delay typical for traditionally-released recordings. For this endeavor he originally used the name ipoetlaurate and subsequently The Press Junket, and released the songs in a series of compilations, Year One, Year Two, and Year Three, in December 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively.  Musical style  Brewer performs a very underground style of hip hop music, preferring darker styles of production. On Simple Moves, his style was described as hardcore, and his lyrics featured vulnerable, deeply emotional lines mixed with an often self- deprecating sense of humor. Brewer's vocal delivery, considered rather unusual, has been compared to that of his frequent collaborators Playdough and Manchild, as well as KJ-52.

Queensland independently claimed war against Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire, uncertain if the Australian Constitution enabled a declaration of war by the Commonewealth of Australia. In the first few weeks that followed the declaration of war, existing militia were deployed to the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force which attacked and occupied German New Guinea. Heightened patriotism resulted in 2500 Queensland men volunteering for the Australian Imperial Force. German military reservists were arrested and detained.  Before war was declared  The Queensland sugar industry harvested a record crop in 1913, and hopes were held for a similar outcome in 1914. There had also been an increase in tropical fruit production in the state's north. The dairy industry was also expanding, particularly in the production of exportable butter. Pastoralists farmed over 21 million sheep, only 15% of which were used for local meat consumption. Wool production remained a major industry in 1914, boosted by sales to European countries preparing for the possibility of war. Wheat production was down however, and the state was not self-sufficient in cereals. Of most concern to food production was the lack of agricultural labourers in Queensland. The population of Queensland was approximately 600,000 - the majority of whom lived in regional urban centres. Immigration had been steadily decreasing prior to the war, with only 1168 people entering in the quarter to October 1914. A high percentage of the non-British immigrants were Russians, but rather than being farm labourers that Queensland required, many were political activists fleeing their home country. The Queensland liberal conservative government was strongly anti-socialist and regarded the Russian immigrants with suspicion. Digby Denham had been Premier of Queensland since 1911. In that year the powerful Amalgamated Workers Association had flexed its muscle in the sugar industry, raising the ire of the government. In 1912, the Brisbane Tramway Company's anti-unionist actions created the grounds for a general strike across many industries. Almost 20,000 Queensland workers withheld their labour, but the anti-union Denham government used its police force and special constables to contain the action in a series of violent confrontations. The general strike collapsed quickly and the Government was not slow in introducing anti-strike legislation. Declaration of war  In late May 1893 the Australian press enthusiastically covered the local tour of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir-apparent of the Habsburg Empire. His official visit to King George V in October 1913 was also widely reported in Australia. The announcement of his assassination in Sarajevo on 26 June 1914 was noted with regret. This event sparked World War I in which over 60,000 Australian men were killed and more than 130,000 wounded or incapacitated. On 29 July 1914, Governor-General Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson received a cable from the British government stating that Australia should \\"adopt precautionary phase\\" for war with the \\"names of powers will be communicated later if necessary\\". The steps to take in the eventuality of hostilities had been laid down in 1907 through Imperial Defence arrangements. Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August and proceeded to invade neutral Belgium. On 3 August, the Governor-General proclaimed \\"the danger of war\\" and called upon the enlistment of the military Citizen Forces. The federal Cabinet discussed the crisis that day. The following morning, the British Secretary of State for the Colonies asked if vessels of the Australian Navy were available for the Admiralty, along with an expeditionary force of 20,000 men. The federal Cabinet assented. Later that day, Britain declared war on Germany. This declaration of the act of war remained a royal prerogative. None of the Dominions were consulted. The Dominions were not represented in crucial decision making until the establishment of the Imperial War Cabinet in 1917. Until 1942, Australia had no independent foreign affairs' policies. Moreover, the Australian Constitution - formulated in 1901 - was silent on the matter of the declaration of war and did not denote who was responsible for deploying troops overseas. Section 51(vi) was concerned with defence powers, elaborated in the Defence Act of 1903. Under Section 61, the Governor-General exercised executive power as representative of the monarch. As Mr Justice Isaac Isaacs confirmed in the High Court in 1916 \\"the creation of a state of war and the establishment of peace necessarily reside in the Sovereign himself as the Head of the Empire\\". In keeping with this office, several proclamations were issued by the Governor-General on 5 August 1914 relating to shipping and the declaration of war by the King. In the next few days, several more proclamations were issued relating to trading with the enemy and enemy shipping. Digby Denham, Queensland Premier in 1914 When the cable was sent from London at 12.30 am on 5 August, it stated that \\"War has broken out with Germany. Send all State Governors\\". Prime Minister Joseph Cook telegrammed Queensland's Premier, Digby Denham, that day. Later that afternoon, the Lieutenant-Governor of Queensland also conveyed this news to the Premier. This process whereby information was conveyed by both the King's representatives and the Prime Minister reflects the lack of clarity on who was responsible - the declaration of war was an unprecedented act for the new Commonwealth and its wider powers of defence and national security had yet to be tested. Even when it was clear by implicit understanding that the Australian Constitution was an arrangement between the monarch, the six sovereign states and the Commonwealth, there was no clear line of demarcation of powers. The Commonwealth and States needed to cooperate to manage the war effort. On 6 August 1914, the Australian Agent-General in London sent a coded telegram to the Federal government: \\"Home Government will tonight accept offer of Australian contingent ... Shall endeavour to arrange for steamer carrying troops to also bring meat\\". The supply of meat was a state matter while the mobilisation of the armed forces was a Commonwealth issue. Here they were entwined seamlessly. Though the matter appeared to reside within the powers of the Governor-General, the Queensland government - led by Liberal Digby Denham - took the extraordinary measure of issuing its own proclamations in its role as a sovereign state. Furthermore, the Queensland Constitution Act of 1867 properly did not refer to declarations of war - being concerned with the consolidation of laws relating to the new colony. Moreover, the Admiralty Court in Queensland was not vested in the Supreme Court of Queensland but was exercised by a single judge of the Court acting as the British Vice-Admiralty Court. Arthur Morgan, Lieutenant-Governor of Queensland in 1914 On 20 August 1914, Queensland took a remarkable step. Sir Arthur Morgan - Lieutenant- Governor, the President of the Legislative Council and Vice-Admiral of the State of Queensland - issued an independent proclamation that war had broken out between His Majesty and the German Emperor and that all enemy shipping could be confiscated under the Prize Act of 1894. This Imperial legislation, amended in 1908 and effective in all British jurisdictions, was concerned with the property of declared enemies that could be rightfully claimed as war prize. All members of the Cabinet initialled the order. The Governor-General was informed three days later. On 19 August, the Governor-General issued a proclamation under the Imperial Prize Courts Act regarding the outbreak of war with Austria and Hungary. On 27 August, a further Queensland proclamation stated that a state of war existed between King George V and the Emperor of Austria and Hungary Francis Joseph I. Approved by the Queensland Cabinet, the order to prepare the proclamation was sent to the Lieutenant-Governor, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and to the judge in the Admiralty Court. On 4 November, the Queensland Governor, Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams, issued a proclamation stating that war had been declared between the King George V and the King of Bulgaria. Further on 11 November - acting in the capacity of Lieutenant-Governor of Queensland - Morgan declared that war had broken out between King George V and the Sultan of Turkey Mehmed V. After war was declared Cattle parading in the show ring in front of a large crowd at the Exhibition Ground, Brisbane, 1914 Despite the declaration of war, life in Queensland appeared to continue during the first month of war much as it had previously. The 38th Annual Show, the Brisbane Exhibition, went ahead as planned from 10 August. It was a success, with more exhibits and prize money, perfect weather and record attendance figures. The event showcased the pastoral and agricultural industries on which the state's economy was based. Parliament was already in session when war was declared in 1914, and it remained in session and active for nearly six months. The Brisbane Industrial Council had urged the Government to prevent exploitive price increases on the outbreak of war, and the Denham government considered legislation almost immediately. It introduced a Bill to set a process for determining the price at which food commodities could be sold. The subsequent Act was not popular with either end of the political spectrum; merchants and unions alike finding fault with its implementation. It was one of many actions that contributed to the unpopularity of the government. On the outbreak of war former British servicemen in Australia who had remained on their country's Reserve list were expected to join the armed services. The Commonwealth devolved the responsibility for ensuring these enlistments happened to the States. The Queensland Police were tasked with locating the reservists and reminding them of their duty. German or Austrian residents of Queensland who were reservists in their national armies came under immediate suspicion, and instructions were issued for their arrest and detention ‚Äì again, a role that the Queensland Police were undertaking within the second week of August. A small number of German passenger and merchant vessels in Queensland ports were not allowed to leave once war was declared. The crews were initially confined to their ships and later interned as prisoners of war. Dr Eugen Hirschfeld voluntarily resigned from the Queensland Legislative Council; the German-born medical practitioner had naturalised as a British subject in May 1893 but had continued to take a leading role in the German community of Queensland, including his appointment as German Consul in 1906. Although his loyalties were never in doubt in 1914, he was interned in February 1916. In Queensland, the most immediate physical impact of the war was the early mobilisation of the local militia forces - an action which went largely unnoticed. The Kennedy Regiment in Townsville was sent to Thursday Island where it was garrisoned until the end of August. From there it joined the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force attack on German New Guinea in the following month, the first engagement of Australian troops in the war. Group of Queensland men waiting to enlist, 1914 War also engendered a heightened sense of patriotism across many sections of Queensland society. Recruiting for the Australian Imperial Force, the volunteer force which was to form the bulk of Australia's military contribution to the war, commenced on the same day the Brisbane Exhibition opened. Queensland was set an initial quota of approximately 2500 men based on its population, which it had met by September 1914. Military service increased the labour shortage in Queensland. Patriotic feelings were also expressed by making direct contributions towards the welfare of fighting troops, or to the war effort generally. Patriotic fundraising organisations formed rapidly across the state during August 1914, and the general public willingly supported them. For example, the Queensland Public Service organised their own Patriotic Fund to aid the families of public servants who volunteered for active service. Also in August 1914, Queensland railway employees established the Queensland Railways Patriotic Fund. Collectively, these organisations had raised almost ¬£100,000 by the end of the month of August.

Both ships were built in Massachusetts in the second decade of the 20th century, and wound up under one owner by 1932. Despite efforts to make use of the two schooners, this last owner went bankrupt and died shortly afterwards. Both ships were now essentially abandoned where their owner had left them in Wiscasset. Despite efforts to save the ships as tourist attractions, both were finally demolished in 1998 having by that time been reduced to piles of debris by the elements. History The Hesper, and Luther Little were both built in Somerset, Massachusetts in the later half of the 1910s, each having a different career. Both ships had donkey engines that were used for things like the capstan, and hoisting the anchor, but no auxiliary power. Their usage was primarily to ship coal and lumber, but by the mid 1920s new steam powered vessels were making cargo sailing ships obsolete. One by one the ships were taken out of service, and found their way to Wiscasset where they were placed up for auction. The two ships were purchased by Frank Winter in 1932, he was an entrepreneur who had also bought the Wiscasset And Quebec Railroad in order to operate a Boston-to-Wiscasset coal and lumber business. He had the idea to have the ships bring coal north to Wiscasset, and bring lumber back to the south. The railroad was to be used to bring lumber, and coal to the interior parts of Maine. This idea never came to pass though as Frank's business suffered through a series of bad events that led to the railway being ripped up in 1934 in order to pay debts owed. The two schooners were left abandoned in Wiscasset Harbor by Frank who died shortly after his business became defunct. As time went by both ships deteriorated at different rates, the Hesper suffered the most from the decay having been set on fire at least twice. There were efforts made to try and preserve the ships, but the town of Wiscasset did not want to spend the money to do so. For decades the ships sat where they had been left becoming a tourist attraction as they were highly visible from U.S. Route 1. Both ships kept their shapes until the mid 1990s when the remains bore more resemblance to piles of debris. The Hesper, and Luther Little were finally demolished, and carried off to a local landfill in the late 1990s after a storm had destroyed what was left of them. People were allowed to take whatever remains they wanted from the landfill until what was left was finally run through a wood chipper. =Hesper= The Hesper was built in 1918 by Crowninshield Shipbuilding which was located in Somerset, Massachusetts. Her launch on July 4, 1918 was met with a delay that lasted a month, the Hesper made several voyages after that to Europe and South America. In 1925, she was grounded while entering Boston but was freed with the assistance of tugs. She then was moved around different ports in Maine in the late 1920s before she finally ended up in Portland. Frank Winter bought the Hesper in 1932, and had her towed to Wiscasset where she arrived in September of that year. After her abandonment she had her masts cut down in 1940, and five years later her aft deckhouse was burned to celebrate the end of World War II. Despite the damage she was able to be boarded as late as the 1960s, a few explorers were even able to access her lower decks. In 1978 another fire further damaged the ship, a salvager though was able to make off with a wooden plank of the ship that said \\"Hesper\\" on it possibly saving it from destruction. By the early 1990s the Hesper had disintegrated into a pile of debris, her end came in 1998 when it was decided by the town to demolish what was left of the ships. =Luther Little= Luther Little during launch day (1917) The Luther Little was built in 1917 by Read Brothers Co which was also located in Somerset, Massachusetts. Unlike the Hesper though, her small coal boiler also provided heat and hot water to the ship‚Äôs forward and main cabins in addition to mechanical work. In June, 1918 her crew managed to rescue two balloonists who had crashed in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Delaware. Other than this event, she was used in coastal/deep water trades early on in her career but was nearly lost in 1920 when she was grounded in Haiti. By the mid 1920s she was laid up until she was purchased in 1932 by Frank Winter who had her towed alongside the Hesper in Wiscasset. After Winter's death both ships were forgotten until 1965 when the Wiscasset Industrial Development Committee looked into possibly restoring the Luther Little as a tourist attraction. The plan would have involved burning her to the waterline in order to preserve the ship, but this was never done. By the 1970s the deckhouse fixtures had been stripped, and water had made its way into the 200 ft cargo hold. In 1995 her masts collapsed in a storm, soon after her hull which had stood intact finally gave way as well. In 1998 she was demolished along with the Hesper, with the remains going to the local landfill. In popular culture In 1985, folk singer/songwriter Gordon Bok did a song called Wiscasset Schooners. Included in the group singing were Lois Lyman (the song's author), and her husband. Bok included the song on his albums Schooners, and Harbors of Home.

Meaza has held a position with the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. She helped lead the development of the first women's bank in Ethiopia, Enat Bank, which was established in 2011 and as of 2016 chairs its board of directors. Political positions In a 2009 speech Meaza was outspoken on the stereotypes that women face in Ethiopian society, blaming Amharic proverbs for the way women are perceived, portraying them mostly as delicate and weak. The communications tradition over time has used these proverbs to advance men and degrade women. Some of the ideas given by these proverbs are that a woman's place is only in domestic duties and that women in general lack common sense and are irresponsible. One of these Amharic proverbs that Meaza is alluding to says that a woman can not to be trusted and another conveys the idea that the companionship of a woman is dispersed by a mouse. Another proverb indicates that even if a woman is smart, only a man can be practical to apply knowledge ‚Äì hinting at gender based roles in urban Ethiopian society, especially in Addis Ababa. Still another of the proverbs she alludes to is of emotional characteristics where the proverb speaks of the courage of a woman as about as useless as a shy priest or a blind donkey. Recognition Meaza has received numerous awards for philanthropy and leadership, including the African Leadership Prize; and is an active member of several women's rights advocacy organizations. In 2003, she became a Hunger Project Award laureate, winning the Grassroots Ethiopian Women of Substance Africa Prize, Two years later, she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Her most famous case was turned into the 2014 Ethiopian film Difret, which was promoted by Angelina Jolie as executive producer and went on to win the World Cinematic Dramatic Audience Award at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival.

Los Angeles County, California (Vernon) Recycling lead in a lead-acid battery recovery facility A battery recycling plant in southeast Los Angeles County, California, United States, emitted toxic metal dust over decades that contaminated as many as 10,000 homes in half a dozen working- class, Latino communities near the plant. Lead is a neurotoxin that causes harm to most organs, but it most commonly causes cognitive deficits, neurodevelopmental delays, and psychological impairments. Exide Technologies, owner of the lead-acid battery smelter located in Vernon, agreed in 2015 to close the facility during the massive cleanup of the contaminated soil, which will take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. =Background= The 15-acre battery recycling plant (6.1 ha) is located in Vernon, CA ‚Äì a heavily industrialized city in Southeast Los Angeles county. The smelter was issued an ‚Äúinterim status document‚Äù by the California Department of Health Services in 1981 and operated under a provisional permit while documented violations were occurring. Exide took ownership of the smelter when they purchased the Gould- National Battery and its assets in 2000. In 2013, Exide was under federal criminal investigation for emitting high levels of harmful pollutants from its battery recycling plant in Vernon, CA. Hundreds of residents had complained for years about Exide's toxic emissions before state and federal agencies acted. In March 2015, the company signed an agreement with the U.S. attorney's office to close permanently. The deal allowed Exide and its employees to avoid prosecution for years of environmental crimes, including illegal storage, disposal and shipment of hazardous waste, while agreeing to pay $50 million to demolish and clean the plant and surrounding communities, including $9 million set aside for removing lead from homes. =Environmental impact= The soil beneath the facility tests high for toxic metals. The groundwater was also polluted from the operation of the plant and corrosive and irritating sulfates drained onto public streets. Studies have indicated that as many as 10,000 homes in half a dozen working-class, Latino communities near the plant have had their homes and yards contaminated by the lead emissions. The decades of air pollution from the Exide Technologies facility has potentially contaminated the nearby communities of Boyle Heights, Maywood East Los Angeles, Commerce, Bell, and Huntington Park. Residents had long been concerned about the air pollution from the plant that was found to have emitted lead, arsenic and other dangerous pollutants over decades. Lead is a potent neurotoxin that puts children at-risk for learning disabilities, lower IQs and other developmental problems who may have acquired lead poisoning from playing outdoors. = Public Health Impacts in East Los Angeles = Throughout history, lead exposure has led to public health problems, specifically for workers in factories or other industrial entities. While past measures that prevent lead exposure in the first place have been successful, ‚Äúsecondary prevention‚Äù is emphasized by public health agencies now, leaving the people who have already been exposed or who will continually be exposed at risk because lead is still used in the manufacture of batteries, buses, trucks, tractors, and motorcycles. As a result, Low income communities and communities of color face a major gap in the public health system for lead exposure prevention. According to ‚ÄúIndustrial Lead Poisoning in Los Angeles: Anatomy of a Public Health Failure‚Äù in the Journal of Environmental Justice, Southeastern Los Angeles has similar gaps and failures of lead prevention as in the Flint Michigan Water Crisis. Since the 1970‚Äôs, Exide had been operating in Vernon. In 2013, AQMD explained that upwards of 250,000 residents in East Los Angeles face a chronic health hazard from lead and arsenic exposure from Exide.South Coast Air Quality Management District, Lead Monitoring at Exide Technologies, 2014. Communities living near Exide such as Boyle Heights and Maywood are more than 90% Latino and rank among the top 10% of most environmentally burdened areas in California. More than 90% of homes in the area were built before the 1978 ban on lead paint and many directly neighbor freeways and truck routes which resulted in decades of exposure to leaded gasoline which contaminated soil.Mielke, HW, et al, Science of the Total Environment 408; (2010) 3965‚Äì3975Laidlaw MAS, Zahran S, Pingitore N, Clague J, Devlin G, Taylor MP. 2014. Identification of lead sources in residential environments: Sydney, Australia. Environ Pollut 184: 238‚Äì246. Lead exposure is especially prevalent in soil, water, and dust; it has the most impact on the children and workers around Vernon. In 2019, a study conducted by the University of Southern California found a high amount of lead in baby teeth of children in Boyle Heights, Maywood, East Los Angeles, Commerce, and Huntington park. The lead in the baby teeth matched with soil contamination data from the California Department of Toxic Substances Control. The Truth Fairy study revealed that children in Boyle Heights and East L.A. have the highest exposure to lead, which most likely came through winds carrying soil in utero from their mother or post birth. The study urges legislators to create initiatives to prevent lead exposure. Jill Johnston, co author of the study and professor of preventive medicine explains, ‚Äúhigher lead in teeth means higher lead in the brain, kidney and bones. Testing women for lead during pregnancy, or even earlier, as they enter child-bearing age, may be needed to decrease lead exposure to their future offspring.‚Äù =Testing and clean-up= DTSC Preliminary Area of Investigation map The facility closure is overseen by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) and the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). The closure includes dismantling the former recycling facility under a full enclosure tent, under negative pressure, preventing emissions from leaving the premises. Hazardous materials from the facility are recycled or disposed of under DTSC oversight.American Integrated Services, Inc. (2017, October 22). Closure Implementation Plan. Retrieved February 25, 2020, from https://dtsc.ca.gov/wp- content/uploads/sites/31/2018/03/Closure-Implementation-Plan_10-22-17.pdf The cleanup of the soil contaminated with lead is being overseen by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control. In August 2015, the department announced that soil testing had shown that the toxic dust had deposited lead in as many as 10,000 homes. Department officials said that they had not previously been involved in a lead cleanup case in which the number of properties was this high. Nineteen homes received first priority for cleanup starting in December 2014 based on the test results. The residents of two neighborhoods in Boyle Heights and Maywood were notified in August 2015 that they could have their soil tested for lead after being identified by the South Coast Air Quality Management District as the communities most likely to have been contaminated by the lead emissions. Contaminated soil was removed and replaced at 146 of the homes closest to the facility in these communities. In October 2015 the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, frustrated with the slow pace by the state, designated $2 million to ‚Äúfacilitate\\" the cleanup effort by hiring contractors and consultants, performing soil testing at 1,000 homes during the following two months, and sending community outreach workers to neighborhoods around the plant. A timeline and strategy was also included in the resolution to force state regulators, Exide \\"and other responsible parties to fully fund and undertake this cleanup.‚Äù The state had used all but $1 million of $9 million Exide placed in a trust fund for residential cleanup. By the end of February 2016, county crews began testing soil at homes in Commerce. The state allocated $176.6 million for the cost of testing and cleanup of about 2,500 of the most contaminated yards. Job training program for community members to be employed in cleanup has been planned by the Department of Toxic Substances Control. It is also establishing a local office to improve and coordinate information-sharing efforts. Local community groups are working with the agency for outreach in signing up residents for testing. High lead levels were found in the soil at Lorena and Rowan Elementary Schools in the summer of 2015 by the Department of Toxic Substances Control. In fall 2017, the Department of Toxic Substances Control began to implement their plans to remove lead-contaminated soil from 2,500 residential properties near the closed Exide Technologies lead acid battery plant in Vernon. It is believed to be the largest environmental cleanup effort of its kind in California history, encompassing seven (7) Los Angeles County neighborhoods. California state regulators estimate that Exide's operations may have threatened the health of an estimated 100,000 people and 10,000 residential properties. A total of $192 million has been authorized by the state for the massive cleanup effort; $176.6 million of which was approved by Governor Jerry Brown in April 2016. The $192 million set aside by the State will only allow for cleanup of 2,500 of the estimated 10,000 homes and properties believed to have been contaminated by Exide's decades of pollution. Total costs to clean up the estimated 10,000 homes contaminated by Exide's pollution is believed to be over $500 million. By August 2016, over $42 million of the $192 million had already been spent. Facing mounting pressure from community activists, residents, and elected officials, to hold Exide, and not taxpayers, accountable for millions of dollars of additional money needed to clean up Exide's toxic lead mess in east L.A. County, the South Coast Air Quality Management District filed claims against Exide totaling over $80 million. Exide filed its own lawsuit in 2016 seeking blood lead data on people tested in L.A. County, including each person's age, city and ZIP Code; the age of the home in which each person lived; and any causes of lead poisoning. The state is fighting the lawsuit in court, calling it an attempt by Exide to dodge financial responsibility and blame the contamination on lead paint and gasoline. Paying for the cleanup might admit guilt that could lead to criminal charges and jail time for executives. On January 31, 2018, Exide Technologies told a bankruptcy judge that their company is not responsible for the $80 million in additional cleanup costs the state of California is trying to recoup, and that the State's claim should be discharged as part of the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan in 2015. Unless the bankruptcy judge rules against Exide, it is likely that taxpayers will be pay for the clean up. California‚Äôs state auditor will investigate how the Department of Toxic Substances Control is handling cleanup after the Joint Committee on Legislative Audit voted in February 2020 to probe contracts, cleanup times, and other issues. =Legislation= The state had dedicated about $7 million to test and clean up homes in 2015. The state assembly voted in 2016 to provide $176.6 million for the cleanup. State legislators held an informational hearing at the Capitol on January 26, 2016 where Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez (D-Echo Park) noted the rapid mobilization for the Porter Ranch gas leak near a wealthier community while the slow progress in these neighborhoods where most residents are Latino and low-income should be disheartening to all legislators. Gomez said \\"We don't want to send the wrong message. That if you live ... in Porter Ranch that you're more important than the folks that live in East ... or Southeast Los Angeles.\\" At the January 26, 2016 hearing, Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood) said the Department of Toxic Substances Control \\"has not done a good job\\" and that he would urge officials to act more urgently on the clean-up. The extent and duration of the lead contamination has raised concerns about longstanding problems at the department. The Governor and state legislators saw this as an wake-up call to seek new laws, hold oversight hearings, and work on other reform efforts. In May 2018, the CA state Assembly approved a budget action and legislation, AB 2189, to commit $16 million in funds for cleaning public parkways. The funding would come from a bill the CA state legislature passed in 2016 to raise about $176 million to help clean-up Exide's toxic lead contamination mess in Vernon, and surrounding neighborhoods, by levying a fee on batteries for all battery manufacturers and consumers. If AB 2189 is made law, it would raise the cost of the taxpayer-funded Exide cleanup to over $200 million. Exide contamination record elsewhere in the U.S. Environmental contamination record The EPA's Lead National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) Non- attainment Designations list designates a total of 21 areas and parts of 22 counties across 15 states and Puerto Rico that are in violation of federal air quality health standards for lead emissions. Exide has operations in six (6) out of the 21 areas that do not meet safe air quality laws; accounting for nearly one-third of the violators (more than any other company). The Exide plants in violation of EPA lead emission standards are in Frisco, TX, Vernon, CA, Muncie, IN, Salina, KS, Reading, PA, and Bristol, TN. Muncie, IN Between 1989 and 2015, Exide Technologies released more than 227,275 pounds of toxic pollutants, including dangerous lead, sulfuric acid and arsenic, into the air and water in Muncie, Indiana where they operate a secondary lead acid battery smelter. In November 2010, the City of Muncie, Indiana and Delaware County were placed on the U.S. EPA's nonattainment list for concentrations of toxic lead in the air that are too high to meet national air quality standards for lead due to emissions from the Exide plant in Muncie. In March 2015, Exide Technologies agreed to pay an $820,000 civil penalty to settle a lawsuit for violating the Clean Air Act at its Muncie lead smelter plant. According to the U.S. EPA, the violations resulted in increased emissions of lead and particulate matter and may have resulted in increased emissions of total hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds and dioxin/furans. In October 2015, the Department of Justice and Exide Technologies rejected pleas from the mayor of Muncie, environmental/health groups and three neighborhood associations to install a $31 million in pollution-control equipment at the company's battery recycling facility; like their competitor Quemetco did for their similar lead acid battery plant in nearby Indianapolis. More than a dozen public health, neighborhood, environmental, and public health organizations, led by the Hoosier Environmental Council, had urged the U.S. Department of Justice to add additional pollution controls to the proposed settlement to better protect people in Muncie from lead and arsenic released into the air by Exide. The organizations also asked the DOJ to require Exide to include monitoring for pollutants at Exide's fenceline. In February 2017, the Exide plant in Muncie experienced three explosions and leakage issues that were not fully or timely disclosed to the relevant state and federal agencies responsible for ensuring Exide's compliance with state and federal laws and safety protocols. Local residents were not made aware of these explosions until nearly a year later, January 2018, raising concerns about any risks to the environment and to the health and safety of hundreds of families that live near the Exide facility. A year later, in February 2018, it was reported that a local pediatrician and the Delaware County Health Department had informed Indiana state officials in 2017 of cases of Exide Technologies‚Äô workers tracking lead home on their clothing and exposing their children to the toxic metal It was also reported that the local health department made a complaint on June 20 to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management about \\"a recent increase in the amount of elevated blood lead level cases\\" reported to local health officials in the community, and that \\"several of these cases have revealed connections to the Exide plant‚Äù with the ‚Äúbusiness's activities‚Äù being a ‚Äúlikely source of this lead exposure.\\" Following reports that Exide workers may have exposed their families to lead contamination in Muncie, residents there have expressed broader concerns about Exide's lead-acid battery plant and the toll that Exide's decades of toxic emissions of lead and other contaminants may have had on the health and safety of hundreds of residents that live near the plant. In response to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's (IDEM) decision not to hold a public meeting on Exide's five-year general operating permit in 2018, dozens of residents took to the streets near the Exide plant in Muncie to decry IDEM's decision and to push for testing of the air, soil and water at the hundreds of homes and properties located near the lead-acid battery plant Salina, KS (Elevated lead levels in children) Exide Technologies operates a large lead-acid battery plant in Salina, KS. Between 1987 and 2015, Exide released over 166,077 pounds of lead, antimony, arsenic and other contaminates into the air and water in Salina. Between 2010-2013, and in 2016, Exide exceeded allowed lead concentration release limits over 18 times, in violation of the Clean Air Act, and in 2010, the plant was largely responsible for the area being designated as one of 16 areas in the nation with concentrations of toxic lead in the air too high to meet national air quality standards for lead according to the EPA. Given Exide's occupation and long history of violations for excessive lead emissions and safety in Salina, several residents over the years have expressed concerns about the plant and have asked about possible correlations to troubling reports and data showing higher numbers of blood lead levels in children in Saline County, where Exide operates, than in surrounding counties and communities in Kansas. Between 2000-2010, the mean blood lead levels in Saline Co. averaged 16.5 ug/dL, more than double that of all other counties in Kansas which averaged 7.5 ug/dL and children living in the city of Salina, had a significantly higher mean blood lead level (3.00 ¬µg/dL) compared to children living in all other Kansas zip codes (2.86 ¬µg/dL In 2016, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) organized a meeting after tests by local doctors in 2016 found elevated lead levels in the blood of 32 Saline County children ‚Äî most of them from Salina. This came on the heels of reports of elevated blood levels being found in 84 Saline County children between 2013-2015. A few residents at the 2016 community meeting asked whether local officials and agencies were investigating any potential correlation or links to the number of children in Salina with elevated levels of toxic lead in their blood, and Exide's lead acid-battery plant in Salina. However, representatives at KDHE tried to avert the inquires by noting that the Exide plant had reduced their lead emissions each year since 2012, following the EPA's stricter requirements on lead emissions, and some plant renovations, and glossed over the fact that Exide still sent a total of 6,720 pounds of lead into the air during that period (2012-2015). KDHE also failed to mention the potentially bigger problem of cumulative lead and other toxic contaminate build up in the soil and water within a 1-3 mile radius of the plant over the decades the plant has been in operation, and did not demonstrate any intention to test the soil or groundwater of homes and public spaces near the plant for elevated levels of lead and other toxic contaminants. KDHE representatives also helped point the arrow away from Exide by releasing a map showing where the 32 children with elevated blood levels live, many not adjacent to Exide's plant. However, KDHE representatives failed to mention that no comprehensive blood testing was conducted for families that live near the plant, that results included only reported cases from local doctors whose parents brought their child in for a medical issue or check-in, and that the children of employees who work at the plant, who are exposed daily to lead, live all over the city and not just adjacent to the plant. To date, no substantive government action has been taken to address this issue. The contamination source(s) for the disproportionate number of children with elevated blood lead levels in Salina, KS and Saline County, remains an apparent mystery. Columbus, GA Exide used to operate a secondary lead recycling plant in Columbus that was taken out of service in 1999 and now the plant continues to operate as a lead-acid battery manufacturing facility at 3639 Joy Road. Between 1987-2015, Exide released 362,102 pounds of toxic pollutants, including lead and arsenic, in the air and water near their plant in Columbus. In 1988, Exide was forced to clean up contaminated groundwater in Columbus resulting from their plant and practices. Costs for supplemental investigations, remediation and site closure are ongoing and currently estimated at $13.5 million. In 2009, Exide received $34.3 million in federal taxpayer money and over $15 million in local tax incentives to boost production of next gen batteries and create more jobs at their plants in Columbus and Bristol, TN but came under fire after shuttering their plant in Bristol not long after taking the taxpayer money and incentives. In 2017, Georgia's Environmental Protection Division fined Exide Technologies $41,000 for violating federal emissions standards on lead at their Columbus lead acid battery plant in November and December 2016 and January 2017. l Just recently, in 2018, Exide Technologies was fined $11,328 by the state of Georgia for once again not being in compliance with toxic emissions standards and safety. Inspectors found that Exide was emitting high levels of lead particulate into the air; over 200% more than the legal limit allows. News of Exide's excessive lead emissions has raised concerns among thousands of residents and families that live near Exide's plant on what Exide's practices mean for their health and safety. Several residents have asked that something be done to ensure they and their families are safe and are not exposed to dangerous levels of lead contamination in the air, soil and water where they live. Reading, PA (Toxic contamination and ongoing cleanup) Exide operates a lead smelter and recycled lead batteries in Reading, PA. The EPA found that Exide contributed to lead emissions and toxic contaminant releases that impacted the soils in the surrounding community and conditions at the site that required extensive cleanup and remediation of toxic contaminants in the area in 1996. In 2012, Exide announced plans to idle their lead-recycling operations in Reading/Laureldale and laid off 150 workers with plans to keep their permits active should they decide to re-open in the future. In 2015, Berks County pursued legal action to strengthen air-pollution monitoring near the Exide facility to better protect residents‚Äô health and safety but a federal appeals court denied the County's request to relocate a pollution monitor or install an additional air monitor near the plant. County Commissioner Mark C. Scott noted that the appeal was filed as a preemptive measure to protect the community from air pollution if the Exide plant decides to reopen. =Lead contamination from Exide Plant resurfaces after cleanup= In 2017, the Reading Eagle newspaper published a series of stories that focused on a study that found lead levels remain high in the borough despite remediation efforts ordered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency about two decades ago at hundreds of properties near the Exide plant. A team of reporters worked in collaboration with a chemistry professor at Metropolitan State University in Denver to conduct soil studies in Laureldale and found strong signs that decades of toxic emissions from the Exide Technologies' battery factory in Reading are taking their toll on neighboring properties. News of the study has raised strong concerns from residents in the community about Exide's past practices and pollution and any impacts it may have had on the health and safety of residents that live near the plant. For example, there was a story about one Reading family's plea for help on social media for an investigation into the cause of lead poisoning in their family. And there was a story about a local high school reunion and ‚Äúa darker truth‚Äù that ‚Äúlocal industry and the pollutants it creates may be to blame‚Äù for the above average loss of many classmates over the years. In response to the study and findings of elevated levels of lead near the idled Exide plant, State Sen. Judy Schwank called for review of the original Reading/Laureldale cleanup. A bipartisan group of lawmakers also created a task force to assess the scope of Pennsylvania's lead problem and recommend changes to the way the state tests and remediates lead contamination. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers grabbed soil samples from six residential properties in Laureldale and Muhlenberg Township to test whether lead concentrations pose a public health risk as part of a federal follow-up to a recent soil study that found high lead concentrations in properties that should have been remediated a decade ago near a now idled battery plant owned by Exide Technologies Inc. In late 2017, the federal EPA commenced cleanup of soil contaminated with lead from the idled Exide plant. The breadth and cost of the cleanup is ongoing and there is no reporting to suggest that Exide is being held financially accountable for the toxic cleanup; taxpayers appear to be on the hook for the new remediation and cleanup costs. Bristol, TN In 2008, it was reported that Exide was emitting two times the amount of pollutants allowed into the environment at their secondary lead acid battery smelter plant in Bristol, TN. Instead of correcting their behavior, Exide asked the state to raise the emissions limit by two times. It was also reported that Exide was doing its own testing and that the Tennessee Division of Air Pollution Control appeared to have no idea of the level of pollution coming from the Bristol plant. In 2013, Exide idled the facility and laid off hundreds of Bristol employees after having received $34.3 million in federal taxpayer stimulus money and as much as $15 million in state tax incentives for their plants in Bristol, TN and Columbus, GA. Instead of investing that taxpayer money, as promised, in Bristol, and creating new jobs, Exide closed the plant \\"as part of a strategic initiative to have other manufacturing locations running near capacity.\\" In March 2017, Exide filed an application with the State of Tennessee to resume partial operations at the idled facility in Bristol, TN. Hundreds of residents expressed concerns about Exide's resumed operation of the plant in Bristol and demanded a public meeting on Exide's application.; Giving in to mounting pressure for a public meeting and a cry for more safety monitoring in light of Exide's long record of fines and violations for emissions and safety practices, Exide elected to withdraw their application to resume operations in Bristol in April 2017. Frisco, TX (Toxic contamination and cleanup) From 2001 to 2012, Exide Technologies received 50 written notices of violation for unsafe working conditions at their Frisco lead-acid battery recycling plant. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) found 27 violations at the plant that occurred between March 31, 2009 and June 30, 2010. The TCEQ listed 12 violations which included soil and water contamination and evidence of toxic discharges that raised concerns about effects on downstream waters. Between May and June 2011, the TCEQ conducted four separate investigations on Exide's Frisco facility and found dangerous levels of lead and cadmium compounds that qualify the facility for Superfund site status. The Exide plant ceased operations in 2012 following a $45 million agreement with the city of Frisco to transfer a 180-acre buffer zone surrounding the plant to the city while the company would keep the 90 acres of land the plant occupies. As part of the requirements of the deal, Exide is required to clean the land to federally acceptable standards before transferring it to the city. Exide has been unwilling to cooperate with the City of Frisco who has shown that Exide has been downplaying the amount of pollution on its site to minimize the cost of the remediation that is required for the site closure. In addition, Frisco's spokesperson Dana Baird, said that the city's estimated $20 million allocated for remediation would not be enough to for the cleanup cost. Community's responses Community activists are driving a growing national conversation about environmental justice, the idea that communities of all races and incomes should have the same kind of environmental quality and protection. One of the leaders of this movement, mark! Lopez, recently received the 2017 Goldman Environmental Prize, for the work he did with his Southeast L.A. based community group, East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice addressing the devastating lead contamination in east and southeast L.A., where the Exide lead-acid battery recycling plant had violated environmental regulations for more than 30 years as state regulators turned a blind eye. Lopez et al. pressured state lawmakers to take action on the Exide plant after decades of complaints about the plant from residents went unanswered. Community activists and environmental scholars, have effectively argued that major industrial polluters, like Exide, have been able to release massive amounts of pollution by exploiting government inaction regarding poor and minority populations that often live near these major sources of pollution. Specifically, it has been proposed that Exide has been protected by local regulatory agencies so that the company has little responsibility in low-income, minority communities. For example, at a South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) board hearing, the mayor of Maywood, Oscar Magana, thought that the Department of Toxic Substances Control and the SCAQMD, would have closed the Exide plant in Vernon much sooner if it had been placed in Beverly Hills, or another affluent community. Sears Battery fraud scandal In March 2001, Exide plead guilty to fraud conspiracy charges and agreed to pay a fine of $27.5 million to end a federal criminal investigation into auto battery sales to customers of Sears, Roebuck & Company. The case arose from investigations and accusations that Exide conspired with Sears to sell used batteries as new to Sears customers and that Exide officials had paid bribes to conceal the fraud. In 2002, two former top executives of Exide Technologies were sentenced to prison for their scheme to sell defective batteries to Sears, Roebuck & Co. Former Exide president Douglas N. Pearson was sentenced to five years and four months in prison and ordered to pay a $150,000 fine. Pearson's accomplice, former Exide chief executive Arthur M. Hawkins, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and ordered to pay a $1 million fine. The two were convicted of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a huge scheme to sell defective Exide batteries to Sears for its Die-hard battery line.

The work was commissioned by the pianist Jacob Lateiner with support from the Ford Foundation. It was composed between 1964 and 1965 and was first performed at Symphony Hall, Boston on January 6, 1967, by Lateiner and the Boston Symphony Orchestra under the conductor Erich Leinsdorf. The piece was dedicated to the composer Igor Stravinsky for his 85th birthday. Composition The concerto has a duration of roughly 25 minutes and is composed in two numbered movements. The work is built upon techniques from two previous Carter's pieces: his String Quartet No. 2 (1959) and the Double Concerto for Harpsichord and Piano with Two Chamber Orchestras (1961). Carter elaborated on this in the score program notes, writing: =Instrumentation= The work is scored for a solo piano and an orchestra comprising three flutes (two doubling piccolo), two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, two percussionists, and strings. Reception The concerto has been highly praised by music critics and is regarded as one of the composer's best works. Reviewing a 2013 performance of the piece, Andrew Clark of the Financial Times called it \\"a classic of his high modernist phase\\" and remarked, \\"The piece hasn't become any 'lighter' with the years, but the inexorable sweep of this reading helps to mitigate the dense thickets of such complex music.\\" In a guide to Carter's music, Tom Service of The Guardian similarly lauded: In a thank you letter to Carter, the composer Igor Stravinsky described the composition as \\"a masterpiece,\\" despite admitting that he at one point had trouble hearing everything that was happening in the score.

Only 10 kilometers from the city of Meerut, the village was settled in 1952 and incorporated in 1987. The village received national attention in Fall 2015, when it was added to the electric grid after 63 years of existing without power.  History  In 1952, some residents of Kanshi, a village two kilometers away, founded the settlement, hoping for better life. Named Reda Basti, in the early years, the only structures were \\"kuchcha\\" houses and straw huts. However, according to village elder Kirachant Kashyap, by the 1980s, it was \\"a proper settlement with pucca houses.\\" This led to the 1982 renaming of the village as Kashyap Colony. With more permanent structures came attention from the Meerut Nagar Nigam, or Municipal Corporation, who deemed the settlement illegal and took the villagers to court. The village won, and received incorporation as an urban village in 1987. While Kashyap Colony was now legally recognized, it still lacked basic necessities. Electricity was never added, despite its legal and incorporated status. Residents were forced to use a kerosene-powered generator to pump water from the village's only tube well. Schoolchildren were unable to study after dark, and a school was never able to be built, causing high dropout rates. On 5 July 2015, an article by The Times of India reported that a local NGO working with the village and municipal government to solve the issue. P.K. Nigam, an engineer associated with the project, said: > \\"I am aware of the problems faced by the residents of Kashyap Colony. Last > month, there was a meeting between Meerut MP Rajendra Agarwal, DM Pankaj > Yadav and PVVNL officials. Kashyap Colony will be made a part of the > Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), which is for urban areas.\\" When asked when the village was likely to get power, he stated, \\"The scheme is not ready yet but it will happen soon.\\" Three months later, electric poles were installed in Kashyap Colony. Pankaj Sharma, representing Meerut Nagrik Adhikar Manch (MNAM), the local NGO that had been supporting the village in its effort, said: > \\"For years, the villagers had approached various authorities and made rounds > to the corridors of power. But all they got were empty promises. Whomever > the villagers approached said they would ensure that the village got > electricity, but nobody gave them a timeline. When we met the villagers, we > advised them to launch an organized protest, and only after that the > authorities woke up and promised the villagers that they would get > electricity supply by Diwali. But, villagers, who had earlier got only empty > promises, would not be satisfied till they actually saw something concrete. > On Monday, electric poles were finally erected in the area, bringing the > hope to the villagers that they won't have to celebrate Diwali in the dark > this year.\\" V. V. Panth, managing director of Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), the engineering company in charge of the project, said: > \\"The work was initially thrown off schedule for a while, but now we are back > on track. The poles that were given to us earlier were of substandard > quality. We rejected those poles. After about a week's delay, the work is > back on track. Poles have been erected and it will take about a month to > complete the work. We are not too far behind the schedule. A lot depends on > the commitment of the contractor, and we are constantly supervising the > work.\\" Ultimately, the village was first lit up on the eve of Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights. In mid-November 2015, the first residents, around 30 families, applied for power connections to their homes. Following Kashyap Colony's addition to the electrical grid, residents began calling for construction of a primary school in the village. The same NGO that helped them receive power announced it was working with the village on this project, as well as an effort to have the village's roads paved. The state of Uttar Pradesh in India.  Geography  The settlement is located 10 kilometers north of Meerut, and only two kilometers away from Kanshi.  Demographics  The Meerut district of Uttar Pradesh in which Kashyap Colony is located. Kashyap Colony has a population of 2,000. = Religion = There is a significant Muslim population in the village. During the 63 years without electricity, they were unable to fast due to heat.  Government  Kashyap Colony is classified as an urban village by the Meerut Municipal Corporation since 1987. The village government consists of a council of elders.  Economy  Most villagers work as masons or farmers.  Education  Kashyap Colony has no schools, and children from the village have to travel to either Kanshi, a village two kilometers away, or Partapur, a town around five kilometers away. Not all children are able to attend primary school because of this distance, and most end up dropping out as they grow older. Shortly after the installation of electricity in the village, residents began calling for the construction of a primary school. Mohit Kumar, a resident of Kashyap Colony, was quoted in a Times of India article addressing the issue, saying: > \\"There seems to be a consensus in the village that we should demand a school > after we get power lines running here. Not a lot of people get to send their > children to school. Children have to either go to Kanshi village, which is > two kilometers away, or to Partapur town, which is around five kilometers > away.

He led the French Army in 1911, but following his opposition to the French strategy for war with Germany was replaced by General Joseph Joffre in July 1911. In August 1914, he was the Military governor of Paris, but was replaced later that month by General Joseph Gallieni. Early career Michel was born in the village of Auteuil (now part of the 16th arrondissement of Paris), the son of a policeman. He attended the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr from 1867 to 1869. On 1 January 1870, he entered the √âcole d'√©tat-major (Staff College), but the Franco-Prussian War made him leave school in October 1870 to join the 13th Army Corps and he served at the Siege of Paris as a Lieutenant. In November 1870, he was assigned to the 3rd Division of the 2nd Army of Paris as a Lieutenant. During the Battle of Villiers on 30 November 1870, he was wounded in the face. After the war, Michel was part of the forces that suppressed the Paris Commune. Michel was appointed Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in May 1871. He returned to Staff College becoming a Captain on 31 December 1873, he joined the headquarters of the 1st Infantry Division in February 1878, and the staff of 15th Corps in April 1880. In February 1882, he joined the staff of General Billot, then Minister of War. In January 1883, he joined the staff of the Military governor of Paris. He was appointed Battalion Chief of the 1st Infantry Regiment in April 1884, then the 43rd Infantry Regiment, he joined the staff of the 1st Corps in 1886, and the War College in 1888. Appointed Lieutenant-Colonel in 1890, he then returned to the 43rd Infantry Regiment. On December 13, 1893, he was appointed to the staff of the deputy head of the new Minister of War, General Mercier. Appointed Colonel on 26 February 1894, he received the command of the 67th Infantry Regiment. Appointed Brigadier on 28 December 1897, he commanded the 10th and then 22nd Infantry Brigades. Appointed G√©n√©ral de Division on 30 December 1902, he assumed command of the 42nd Infantry Division. On 26 March 1906, he was given command of the 2nd Army Corps and made Inspector of Reserve Regiments. General Michel was appointed to the Superior War Council on 22 December 1907, which was largely concerned with strategic planning.Cole, 1979. Chief of Staff and Plan XVII Michel was highly successful in training reservists, a goal that especially appealed to the Republican political element in France. They succeeded in pushing him to the top level. Michel was appointed Vice President High Council of War on 10 January 1911, making him Commander in Chief designate of the French Army. However, the more conservative elements to largely dominated the senior ranks of the French army were deeply suspicious of the Republicanism of the reservists, and believe they would be inferior soldiers. They distrusted Michel's competence. Ralston, p. 330.Cole, 1979. Soon after taking office Michel reviewed the current French Army mobilization and war plan in the event of a war with Germany. Under the current Plan XVI French planners predicted the main German offensive to come in Lorraine with a secondary attack through south-eastern Belgium and Luxembourg towards M√©zi√®res. Plan XVI specified the response: a French offensive to retake Alsace through two lines of advance, one on the right between the Vosges and the Moselle below Toul the other, on the left, north of a line Verdun‚ÄìMetz. Michel correctly predicted the main elements of the German Schlieffen Plan. He argued that that the major German offensive would probably come through central Belgium, because of the obstacle of French defences in Lorraine, the terrain in eastern Belgium and German railway building. At a meeting of the Superior War Council on 19 July 1911 he presented these views and proposed a new strategy to be called Plan XVIIa defensive strategy of deploying a large defensive force on a line Verdun- Namur-Antwerp to counter the anticipated German offensive. Michel's plan called for 1,290,000 men to defend against the expected German invasion through Belgium. There would be 770,000 men in two \\"Mass of Maneuver\\" formations along the Belgian border, backed by a reserve of 220,000 men centered around Paris. The third Mass Maneuver, of 300,000 men, would be along the German border. In order to field an army of this size French reserve units would need to be integrated with the active army immediately on mobilisation. Although Michel was prescient in predicting the German plans, his appreciation of artillery was deficient, and France entered the war with a severe weakness in long-range artillery tubes and shells.Cole, 1979. Michel's proposal was met with hostility by conservatives in the government and Army. They were alarmed at Michel's dependence on the use of reserves, which would enhance the political power of the Republicans. They denied that Germany would be aggressive and violate the neutrality of Belgium, which supposedly was guaranteed by Great Britain as well as friends. They complained that Michel's approach was strategically too defensive and ran against the offensive spirit of the French Army. The War Minister Adolphe Messimy stood opposed. On 28 July 1911 Messimy replaced Michel with General Joffre and dismissed Michel from the Supreme War Council. The new Plan XVII drafted by Joseph Joffre that was now adopted. It rejected Michel's ideas and emphasized a massive French attack in Lorraine.Cole, 1979. General Michel was then appointed Military governor of Paris where he would not have responsibility for strategy.Kiesling, pp 97-98. World War I Despite his vindication as to German intentions, General Michel's service in World War I was short - less than a month. On 26 August 1914, War Minister Messimy dismissed him as Military Governor of Paris, and replaced him with General Joseph Gallieni. He did not receive any command for the remainder of the conflict. Later life Michel retired to Meulan where he died on 8 November 1937.

Early life Young Roddy was born and raised in Kenner, Louisiana, New Orleans Metropolitan Area in Jefferson Parish. Growing up, Roddy was an avid basketball player and aspired to play professionally. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Roddy's mother, with whom he lived at the time, moved to Texas. Roddy did not want to leave New Orleans, however, and moved in with a friend who made beats and had a home studio. At this time, Roddy began to freestyle in cyphers with his friends. Roddy's friends were impressed by his skills, encouraged him to continue freestyling for them, and eventually suggested that he invest more time in his music. Despite this positive feedback and Roddy's genuine passion for music, he still did not see rap as a serious pursuit. Although he enjoyed freestyling, he was not recording music and resisted his cousin's repeated attempts to get him in the studio. Roddy was only goaded into visiting the studio when his cousin told him that Young Money would be recording in the same space. Roddy would go on to meet Curren$y at this studio. After hearing Roddy freestyle, Curren$y asked Roddy to join a new group that he was assembling and the two began to collaborate.\\"Video: Young Roddy - The Kenner Loop Documentary (Part 1)\\" iHipHop Distribution, December 14, 2015\\"Video: Young Roddy - The Kenner Loop Documentary (Part 2)\\" iHipHop Distribution, December 14, 2015Young Roddy - The Kenner Loop Documentary (Part 3)\\" iHipHop Distribution, December 14, 2015Young Roddy - The Kenner Loop Documentary (Part 4)\\" iHipHop Distribution, December 14, 2015  Career  = 2007‚Äìpresent = In 2007, Young Roddy appeared on two songs, \\"Money Gone To My Head\\" and \\"Lysol,\\" from Curren$y's mixtape Life At 30,000 Feet.

During World War I in Queensland, Australia, enemy aliens (people from enemy nations) were frequently arrested and detained. Strong anti-German sentiment resulted in many arrests and investigations. German place names in Queensland were frequently renamed with British names.  Before World War I  Before the outbreak of the World War I in August 1914, German migrants were held in high esteem for their industriousness and agricultural skills. Successive Queensland Governments actively encouraged German immigrants, who came to dominate rural communities in the Logan River district, Lockyer Valley, Darling Downs, Binjour Plateau in the Burnett, and centres in Far North Queensland.J Perkins and J Tampke, 'Two Pastors and their Flocks: An Episode in the European Settlement of Queensland', Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, Vol.12, No.5, August 1986, pp.379‚Äì381. During World War I The British Empire and its allies ‚Äì including Australia ‚Äì had four major combatants: Germany, the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman (Turkish) Empires and Bulgaria, which together formed the Central Powers. While there were relatively few Turks, Bulgarians and Austro-Hungarians residing in Queensland, Germans and their descendants constituted a major segment of the population.G Fischer, 'The Darkest Chapter: Internment and Deportation of Enemy Aliens in Queensland, 1914‚Äì1920', in M Jurgensen and A Corkhill (eds), The German Presence in Queensland Over The Last 150 Years, Albion Press, Brisbane, 1988, p.23. As such they were the most visible \\"enemy aliens\\". Despite initial calls for restraint, the release in 1915 of the Bryce Report on alleged German atrocities, the sinking of the liner Lusitania by a German U-boat and the growing casualty lists from Gallipoli, all contributed to hardening attitudes against Germans and other former residents of the Central Power countries.R Evans, Fighting Words: Writing about Race, University of Queensland Press, St Lucia Queensland, 1999, p.103. As a precautionary measure, suspicious enemy alien military reservists were incarcerated in the Enoggera Internment Camp from September 1914, while non-reservists were registered and released on parole.R Evans, Loyalty and Disloyalty: Social Conflict on the Queensland Homefront, 1914‚Äì18, Allen & Unwin, North Sydney, 1987, pp.44‚Äì45. The process of internment was selectively widened to embrace Lutheran pastors and other influential leaders of the German community.Fischer, 'The Darkest Chapter', pp.33‚Äì34. The steadily growing number of internees ultimately led to the closure of Enoggera in April 1916 and the transfer of 325 enemy aliens south to Holsworthy on the outskirts of Sydney. They would be joined there by others as a curious social phenomenon took hold on the Queensland home front. With hostilities on the far side of the world, propaganda and a determination to contribute to the Allied cause resulted in the manufacture of war within Australia itself.J McQuilton, 'German Australians in Rural Society 1914‚Äì1918', Journal of Australian Studies, Vol.23, No.1, 1999, p.178. Towns and street names of Germanic origin were altered to make them more \\"British\\",J W Chadwick, 'A Plea for Wecker- Street', The Brisbane Courier, 17 October 1914:15R Evans, 'The Pen and the Sword. Anti-Germanism in Queensland during the Great War and the Worker', in Jurgensen and Corkhill (eds) The German Presence in Queensland Over The Last 150 Years, p.10. while many people of direct British descent became ultra- loyalists, seeking out the \\"enemy\\" wherever they could be found. Their activities were reinforced from February 1916 by Commonwealth legislation which classified even the Australian-born as \\"aliens\\" if they had fathers or grandfathers born in a hostile country.J T Stock, 'South Australia's \\"German\\" Vote in World War I', Australian Journal of Politics and History, Vol.28, No.2, 1982, p.254. Nor did naturalisation necessarily provide any protection as it was not recognised beyond Australian shores and came to mean little within.G Fischer, Enemy Aliens: Internment and the Homefront Experience in Australia 1914‚Äì1920, University of Queensland Press, St Lucia Queensland, 1989, p.24. As Jurgen Iwers of Mackay found, applying for naturalisation was itself fraught with danger. Iwers was provided with a good character reference by local police only to become the object of suspicion when a horse was shot dead near his property. A subsequent police raid uncovered prohibited firearms and ammunition, with the Commissioner of Police concluding that Iwers was \\"a dangerous man\\" and recommending his internment. Others were watched closely by their \\"British\\" neighbours who sought any evidence of disloyalty. Even the famed \\"Beachcomber\\" of Dunk Island, Edmund Banfield, was not immune from the prevailing war psychosis. In December 1915 Banfield informed the Under Secretary for Home Affairs that a German named Henschel was preparing to purchase 300 acres of land on adjacent Clump Point, the frontage offering commanding views of the coast. Although conceding that Henschel appeared to be \\"a decent sort\\", Banfield reminded the Under Secretary of the \\"perfidy of the race and its duplicity\\", suggesting that the sale should be blocked. It was, and Henschel was interned.Evans, Fighting Words, p.102. In the Boonah district of South-East Queensland police investigated claims that German farmers were stockpiling gold and silver to aid their homeland, an allegation soon found to be patently false. The mere presence of enemy aliens was also held to be an important factor in falling enlistment rates, and loyalist bodies such as the Kedron Recruiting Committee in Brisbane argued that \\"persons of enemy origin\\" should \\"pay a special War Tax\\". Under the provisions of the War Precautions Act authorities seized company shares held by enemy aliens, including those of 85-year-old C Reese of Fortitude Valley, who had been resident in Australia since 1852. Idle chat put many at risk. At the Leyburn Cheese Factory Australian-born William George Greisheimen innocently remarked to a fellow milk supplier in December 1914 that with hostilities underway \\"I am afraid England will have a rough time of it\\". His comments were reported to military authorities, who ordered local police to investigate. Constable John Reed found no evidence of \\"disloyalty\\". As the archival records show, there were occasions when the Queensland Police and the Queensland Government sided with enemy aliens against vindictive loyalists. Demands to purge the Queensland Public Service of all enemy aliens were unsuccessful, largely owing to the sheer number of the people involved. In January 1916, 65 \\"Germans\\" were serving police officers, while another 192 were employed on the railways. No distinction was made, however, between the naturalised, non-naturalised or Australian-born. Owing to their homelands being under the control of belligerent nations, Syrians and Poles were among other ethnic groups caught up in the home front conflict. Their numbers, however, were relatively insignificant. Bulgarians and Turks were similarly few in number: in November 1915 authorities identified just 14 Bulgarians residing in Queensland. Yet, such was the prevailing fear that Bulgarians and Turks were arrested and interned, later being transferred from Enoggera to Holsworthy in April 1916. Dr Eugen Hirschfeld After the war many of the internees were deported to their country of origin, including the most prominent internee of all ‚Äì Eugen Hirschfeld, the honorary German consul to Queensland. A gifted medical man and naturalised British subject, Hirschfeld moved in society's highest circles and on the eve of the First World War he was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council, a position from which he felt obligated to resign after the outbreak of the war. Unfortunately, Hirschfeld was an ardent advocate for the maintenance of German language and culture, contributing in no small measure to his persecution.E Scott, Australia During the War, Angus & Robertson, Sydney, 1938, pp.156‚Äì157. Very few women and children were interned, as authorities found it cheaper to pay the wives of internees 10 shillings per week, with an additional 2/6d per week for each child under 14 years of age, leaving these families in poverty. Until 1917 it was possible to escape increasing persecution by fleeing to the United States of America, which was also a destination for deportation. However, the United States was not always willing to accept deportees such as Paul Freeman. The origins of Paul Freeman are obscure: at different times he claimed to be either American or Canadian. His guttural accent suggested that he was German.R Evans, 'Radical Departures: Paul Freeman and Political Deportation from Australia following World War One', Labour History, No.57, November 1989, p.20. Freeman was also a member of the proscribed radical labour organisation, Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), foreign-born members of which had already experienced incarceration and deportation.F Cain, The Wobblies at War: a history of the IWW and the Great War in Australia, Spectrum, Melbourne, 1993, pp.284‚Äì285. In January 1919 Freeman was arrested at his lonely prospecting camp near Cloncurry and taken under armed guard to Sydney, from where he was deported to the United States. The Americans refused entry and Freeman was sent back to Sydney. The Australian Government authorities tried again ‚Äì with the same result:Cain, The Wobblies at War, pp.284‚Äì285. Freeman was finally deported to Rotterdam in the Netherlands.Evans, 'Radical Departures', p.19.  German Australians in the Australian forces  Despite the concern about Germans and German descendants in Australia, many German Australians were very loyal to Australia and enlisted in the Australian armed forces. Some attempted to disguise their German heritage by adopting a more \\"British\\" name, often an Anglicisation of their German name. For example, Private John Jacob Bond enlisted in January 1916, using his step-father's surname Bond in preference to his own more Germanic surname Funk. He also listed his mother as his next of kin as simply \\"Mrs S Bond\\" avoiding the use of her Germanic given names Matilda Augusta.
